      <field name="fulltext">To my honoured friend M? R.H. on his rich Poems and Satyrs. Thou'rt gone, and yet Thou'rt here, to let us see The pow'r of verse, how't makes Ubiquitie: Thus th'husbandman away the Harvest bears, And leavs the Poor to glean som scatter'd ears; Thus we enjoy the Tap-wort of thy Muse, Whilst others quaff off thy Diviner juyce: That thou wilt drop these Crums, 'tis Comfort yet To them that Cann't deserve thy Cates to eat; Thy Dainties are for forreign pallats, wee Are bless'd with scraps, That too, no thank to thee; For had not Fate, or Providence thrown us These, Hunger had been our Fare—and without Ease. But I have seen thy choycest cheer, and wish Thy several Arts to th'making up one dish: Thy rich Composures. I have seen Thee Frame Varietie in that, which was the same: But much-good-do't-you Friends! for Wee're not right, Either in Pallat, or in Appetite. Ne'r fewer Raptures in an Age, less wit, Less Judgement, Fancie, Poetry, and yet Th'unthrifty science ne'r more credit gain'd, Nor Poesie in greater triumph raign'd: The Laurel fades on Mercenary browes, But on the neck of Honour spreads her boughes. When Salary and profit rul'd the Age, Some few, would, now and then, ride post, a stage; But Now 'tis otherwise—the Nobler steed Fames fleetest Coursers, Pegasus own breed Do stately praunce 'bout Helicons Lov'd Brink, And at the Muses-Well would daily drink. The Alteration of the Times is such, Great ones turn Poets now—and so grow rich. All witt at Livery stood before, but now The Gentry are at leisure, a Lord too Can spare his great attendance, whilst hee sits And Votes—Happy the man 'Can Live by's wits. And such art Thou— Had'st thou breath'd, then, thine Ayres, so pure and free Th'adst won the VVench, that now enjoy'st the Tree; Apollo, then, would ha' been forc'd t'resign, His Courtship (friend) would have come short of Thine: The greater favour, thine, I take to bee, While Hee grasps Her, shee twines Her Arms 'bout Thee. G.H. POEMS, &amp;c. The Temple of Virtue. Reach me an Eagles plume! or take From Mercurie's Æthereal wing Some highborn quil my pen to make, Whilst I of Virtue sing! Th'Imperial Bay which Poets wore In Saturn's age, and humbly grew From base ignoble earth, is poore; My Temples some more new Unheard-of garland shall invest; One of Apollo's burnish'd hair Twisted with threds of life, and drest With Sol's bright raies, Ile weare. Hence all prophaner ears! my Lyre Exalted to Seraphick height, Ecchoes streins worthy such a Quire, And scorns a lower flight. Mounted me thinks on Pegasus, From the despised world I flie Aloft in clouds, where soaring thus I view this Deitie. There sits she crown'd in glorious state, And whitest robes of Innocence; Not in that poore despis'd estate As she was banisht hence. I'th' midst of a fair temple, there Unto her Honour consecrate, Her handmaids 'bout her Royal chair Adorn'd with Trophies wait. Oh did blind mortals but behold, How she dispenseth gifts each where To her attendants, I'd be bold They would with greater care Serve at her Altars! but alas! They fondly sleight her here below, And think her nothing worth because Shee doth so meanly go. They do not know what Conquest 'tis To have o'rcome one Rebel vice, What crowns of joy he purchases Who gets such victories. Virtue rewardeth sure, though late; Who growes soon rich by policie And thriving Arts, doth purchase hate, And robs his market, he Thus by forestalling it. Light gains Make heavie purses: Honestie That doth it self reward, disdains Boones oft in modestie. For Virtues sake lets her affect And not for praise or benefit Accruing thence, such by-respect Robs both our selves, and it. Oh what a glorious Court doth there Of all the Graces Virtues too In female shape and dresse appear! As if they would out-doe The Heav'ns in splendour, and confine All worth unto that sex! behold Where Modestie in blush divine With Roses set in gold Triumphant shines! and close by her, Silence that Pythagorean grace Hee taught his scholars, but by far More becomes female race. Next her sits Innocence arrai'd In snow-white robes, and on her head A Chaplet wears of Love all made And Lillies mingled. Hard by this Peer sits Chastitie, Her ears close bound about, for fear (Though crown'd with Lillies too) lest she Should ought offensive hear. By her with book in hand, her eies Fixt upwards sits true Pietie, As she with Prai'r cou'd pierce the skies, Crown'd with a Galaxie. There Love, here Affabilitie, And by her, noble Gentleness; By whom sits faithful Constancie, Each deckt in several dresse: Lowest of all Humilitie Stands gravely by, as who wou'd say (Though She were crowned too) that shee Serv'd waitingmaid that day. More do I Laureate view among These holy Nymphs: but oh! I see High above all this sacred throng, A richer Deitie, To whom these homage did, so fair, That I'l approach and neerer prie; Chiefly our eies delighted are With Curiositie. Nor is't enough one Grace to know; The way's all pav'd with stars, to blisse; We must from one to th'other go, And climb to perfectness. I'l through each Glorie then, and see What mighty Goddesse dwelleth there, Ruling with so much Majestie In this diviner sphere. It must be she, and Shee alone, (Unless my dazled eies mistake) Whom all these Virtues wait upon, And their Queen Regent make. 'Tis shee: lov'd Clarastella, she These Virtues court: with whose faire store All mankind might enriched be, And yet not leave her poor. Thy pardon yet dear Quintessence Of all perfection! if I— In this thy holy conference Intruding presse too nigh. 'Twas Love did guide me to thy shrine, Where I'l adoring serve alone Thee, Virtues self, whose soul divine doth make these all, but one. On a dust got in Clarastella's eie. Can I with patience this my rival see Courting those flames so long ador'd by mee? Forcing her shut her eies from me, and thaw A tear, which all my sighes ne'r thence could draw? Canst thou small crum of earth eclips my Sun, And make it set in clouds e'r day be done? Could ought but Atomes to this Orb aspire? Durst ought but dust approach so great a fire? Hence thou unluckie beam, but more unkind, That mak'st at once me and my Stella blind! What have I said? my pious rage hath burn'd Too hot, and hath on the wrong object turn'd: Forgive me little moat; I know thou'rt free; How hath my angry zeale accused thee? 'Las thou wast thither onely sent by me, My guiltless loves unhappy Mercurie. Wouldst know then (Fairest?) whence this dust doth rise? 'Tis caus'd by th'flaming sparkles of thine eies, Which like the lightning through my veins have shot Such ardent flames of love, so scorching hot, My heart's ev'n burnt to ashes; hence it flies, Dust as you made it, back into your eies. On Clarastella singing to the Eccho at Aythorn Church in Kent. 'Twas when the Sun had purpled all the West, And newly stole into his Rosie nest To bring the Tartars morn; our Nymph was grown Weary with walking, and did lay her down Upon the tender trefoiles, glad to yield Unto so soft a pressure, in a field Neer Aythorns holy Church, to satisfie Our joynt requests with her sweet harmonie; In a serene stil Summers evening, Fair Stella did exalt her voyce and sing. And as the torrent of her melodie Did genly flow in new varietie Of melting streins, in whose swoln rapsodies Shee cool'd the dayes heat, and thus fann'd the skies, The sacred walls, but streight was answer'd too; As if her Angel voyce had eccho'd bin By the blest musick of some Cherubin: Whilst from the Church the listning Spirit there Through envie of her phansies chirp't to her, And with distinguisht tones in ev'ry mood And skilful accent made her murmurs good. 'Twas in the Church this Rival dwelt; 'tis there A better Eccho wil our sighings hear And answer too, though ne'r so softly groand: (Where live thou stil in this thy sphere enthron'd) Soon as Shee did perceive her Art out-done By the invisible division Of the Reporters voyce, she stretcht her throat And warbling daunced on a treble noat In loftier measures. These th'Eccho likewise sent More perfect back, than from her first they went. Shame now 'twixt grief and anger plac'd, did raise Our Stella, and provoke to second laies: One whiles she soars like the morns Lark on high, As with exalted voyce shee'd pierce the skie, Then with a sullen flat and deeper base, As she would marrie her Immortal laies With her diviner Odes, she humbly dwels O th'Gamut. Th'Eccho too this lesson spels, And thus repeating descants on each strein Much more distinctly relish'd and more plain. How have I lov'd Church-musick e'r since I First there heard this so heav'nly harmonie? Thus by alternate strivings as they had Ev'n sung the Sun asleep, and made us sad In their behalf, scarce knowing which t'admire, And count the Mistresse of this holy Quire: Our Stella did attempt it once again To get the conquest; but alas! in vain She striving tir'd, and tir'd was fain to yield, While the Church-Saint was heard the last i'th' field. On Loving at first sight. So smiles the Sun indeed with cheerful eie On the bright gold his raies inform'd; and so Doth that its borrow'd beams reflect. But why Our hearts turn'd Solar, should each other wooe In silence by aspect, I wonder, I. The Heliotrope that marks with watchful eie His Sol's beloved face, and gathers thence Those am'rous features which he there did spie, Preserving them by secret influence, Waits on him with religious Loyaltie. By sighes and groans so wooe the Turtles, and Thus doe the Mutes by signes articulate Mysteriously each other understand; And in this Brachygrapie can relate Their wils, with onely help of eie and hand. Nature and Art doth these instruct, but we Led with more reason do our loves expresse By louder organs tongues: though the eie be The souls true speaking index I confesse, Yet do we more believe the ear, than eie. Our formes in mirrours weep with us, or smile; So at these christal casements of the eies, Our other selves are represented, while Each visual beam by repercussion is First met, and so retort by joynt recoyle. Thus from the sparkling beam of eithers eie, Fann'd by their medium air, their hearts prepar'd, Like tinder, catch Loves fire by sympathie, And mingle flames. Let Lovers then award Cupid his eies, since theirs so wel can see. On a black mole on Clarastella's faire check. How fair a Character hath Nature wrot! And printed on her cheek in black and white! While this i'th' fairer Copie is no blot, But a ful period; that the Reader might The better understand the sence, and know That here Shee stopt, and could no further go. As when the skilful Artist hath exprest With lively colours a fair countenance, Yet he at last doth shadow forth the rest, And so with shades the beauty much advance: So Nature having drawn this lovely piece, VVith this last shade perfects her Artifice. 'Tis like the mark o'th' richer text: or hand O'th' margent leading to some Paradise, VVhere't points at some choise flow'r i'th' garden, and Bids you there fix, and feast your greedie eies: This molehil's Cupids throne, on which he sits, And with his love-arm'd shafts each breast he hits. Let meaner beauties patch their painted faces, Studying the black art of complection, Nature hath here without Arts helping Graces, Firmly engraved all perfection. Stella's the pattern which they imitate; They have no form but what they do create. Bleeding at the nose at Clarastella's approach. So at the Murtherers approach we see The Corps weep at its wounds again; And I who first was slain And rob'd of Reasons soul by thee, Walk but a living Corps, and drawing nigh, Thus doth my guiltless blood thy murther crie. From my dead heart it flowes, and boldly there It stares thee in thy guiltie face (Fair cruel Murtheresse!) Soon as I thee approach more neat: While thus the spirits all emitted are, And for thee blushing in my face appear. Yet back thou smal remainder of my life And bid my drooping heart revive Which thus again may live, Could it but some remorseful grief Raise in thee at this horrid sight, that then You may be quit, and I no Ghost agen. Seeing Her Dancing. Robes loosly slowing, and aspect as free, A carelesse carriage deckt with modestie; A smiling look, but yet severe: Such comely Graces 'bout her were. Her steps with such an evenness she wove, As shee could hardly be perceiv'd to move; Whilst her silk sailes displaied, shee Swam like a ship with Majestie. As when with stedfast eies we view the Sun, We know it goes though see no motion; So undiscern'd she mov'd, that we Perceiv'd shee stirr'd, but did not see. To her having got a great Cold. What blasting dewes are these That on thy active spirits seize? And tie that tongue, did make Musick to all that heard it speak? As by the fire Ice is Made by Antiperistasis; So doth thy hearts flame within And th'warm ayr ambient 'bout thy skin And colder self, congeal it To such a coldnesse you scarce feel it. 'Tis so: the heat is more intense And glowes by th'numness of each sense. But oh! that vital part Kil not (thou cruel frost!) her heart! May th'Elemental fire That burns there purely through desire, Scorch, like our fires below More fiercely, for the frost and snow! The Invocation to Cupid. Oh do not look me dead, fair eies! Do not allure and then despise! Be kind but as your picture! that Will look and smile, though you will not. Ye Gods! or women make lesse fair! Or else lesse cruell then they are! Or strike me Cupid blind like thee, So I my torment shal not see. To one blaming my high-minded Love. Too great? wherein? is it in wealth or bloud? Or is she any way too good? The sacred treasure that I bring, is Love, Angels enjoy nor wish no more; 'Tis Sovereign too, and sans allay will prove As rich as both her Indies doubled o're. Love makes equality; nor wil admit Finites should bound an Infinite: Who sets no value on himself, shal ne'r By others much esteemed be. Blind Cupid doth assist the bold, while fear Unman's the heart, and shuts the Lovers eie. But she is high and wel-discended; true; My birth stiles me as freeborn too; No peasant bloud doth stein or chil my veins, And the proud Youth that warms them, he Was of a Goddesse born, and thus disdeins I should adore lesse than a Deitie. My loves diviner flames do upwards flie By nature like their sparks on high; Base heavy things do only downward tend To the dull center gave them birth; But heav'n-deduced spirits there ascend: Whilst low ignoble minds fix to their earth. Mans sight erected looks to Heav'n, that so His thoughts he there might level too: She is the Empyræum of my love; Whose Glories though they blast mine eys, Yet shall my Eagles singed feathers prove Bright Trophæes of a gallant enterprise. On Clarastella's Picture drawn very like her. Fair shadow of a fairer substance! when Thy lively second self I see, Nature doth blush that by Arts pow'rful pen Stella agen create should bee. See where She all identifi'd appears Except that soul we cannot see! Whilst this, her eys, forme, shape, and colour wears, And 'cud it breath, w'ud say 'twere She. Bright Image of my Saint! to thee I'd bow, Were it not flat Idolatrie, To think thoult hear what scarce deaf she wil do, In hope thy lips can answer, I. Yet will I make this holy use of thee: The looking oft on thee may mind Me of that more respectfull Deitie That to my prai'rs may be enclin'd. On Mrs. E. H. having red haire on her head, and on her left side a pure white lock growing. Tell me no more of Helen fair, Of Daphne, or that famous pair Of lovely Dames whom Jove did court And tempted to his bed of sport. Such a fair wonder I shal tel The Golden age cann't paralel: Her hair the richest Metal yields, Whilst she like Ceres gilds the fields: And her smooth flesh with red and white So fitly mixt, so purely bright, While the choise flow'rs there smile so gay, She's fair as Flora fresh as May. Lillie and Rose dwell in her face, In ev'ry look and smile a Grace, And in whom all is understood What we count either Fair or Good. As is the Saints more precious head With gilded raies environed; So 'bout this Comet you shal see The Embleme of her Deitie. Such light surrounds, that all may say 'Tis she not Phœbus rules the day; While those loose flames about her spread, Irradiate, not shade her head. Let me adore this Saint-like Shrine, Ther's treasure in this golden mine: It was not Jason, no; 'twas She That got the Golden Fliece, not he. She whose sweet looks and glorious hair Dart like warm lightning through the air: That in this golden show'r of love She seems like Danae fit for Jove; And the gilt threads which twisted lie Wreathed with Arts Embroaderie, About her Temples, in her praise A Garland and a Crown do raise. Why should fond Phansie then compare The sadder with the brighter haire? Black tresses 'come the browner hue To set it off the better: you Need no such foile; your Angel face Wants neither beauty, worth, nor grace. But here! behold a silver beam Which from this Blazing-star doth stream, And in such curling waves doth flow About her Ivory breast below; White as the soul she wears within, Doth speak her pure and free from sin! Not the blancht snow or Pearly dew Of Morn, affords a brighter hue. Here is that Christal milky way Which leads (like morning to the day) To Heav'n: oh thither let me come And climb to loves Elysium! So fitly on her left side plac't, And with such beauty it is grac'd, That Nature sure when this she gave her, Bid her there wear it as her favour. As in our Heraldry we deem These colors of the best esteem, With Sol and Luna blazing forth The nobler Arms of higher worth: So Nature having drawn this piece (Then which was never artifice So neatly pen'd and polisht o'r With skilful art and beauty more) Resolv'd for its great worth and fame, To put it in a Golden frame. If in these outward parts we find Such worth; what bears her richer mind? May this fair grove then never fade! Or be by blasting time decaid! May age ne'r hoar that lovely hair, Or leave that golden mountain bare! May not thy envious kemb presume To pluck from thee one precious plume! But if you shed a hair let't prove A chain to lead thy captiv'd love Or let 't a holy Relique be Preserv'd to after ages free. That the succeeding times may tell, This from the Queen of Beauty fell. Amoris Somnium. To Clarastella. Love is a waking dream, where both the mind And all the senses drownd in sleep we find: Only the Phansie worketh, that doth range And to a thousand strange Idæas change. For as in dreams we often turn, and sigh, And groan, as if we were about to die, Sometimes we startle as we were afraid, Then breath distracted words, and cry for aid: So in a trance true Lovers restles are, Fraught with disorder'd thoughts, and ful of care, So speechles too, when they with grief opprest Speak somewhat, and in sighs do vent the rest. Stella! when thus you see me, wake me pray; You know what ayles me, though I nothing say. On Clarastella singing. Ye that in love delight Approach this sacred Quire, and feast your ears! Whilst she the sweetest Syren sings, Whose musick equals the harmonious spheres, And perhaps richer pleasure brings! The dying Swan or Philomel O'th' wood, not warble's half so wel; Observe the cadence where each dying sound, Creates new Eccho's to a sift rebound. Here's musick to the sight: She looks and sings with such Majestick grace, That when I Clarastella hear, She more than woman seems, her voice and face Taking at once both eie and eare, That which of these two senses may Be most refresht, is hard to say. To glorifie her after death, Shee'l ne'r Need change; She's Angel now, and Heav'n is here. A Love Dialogue between Damon and Stella. Dam. I prithee Stella why so coy? Be free as fair, and wee'l enjoy New pleasures to Eternitie. Stel. —O no: I dare not, I. Dam. Nature's Apostate wilt thou prove, That cements all with love? When all her creatures coupled are, Will you be singular? Stel. Though all were Male and Female made, Yet none shal me invade. Dam. View but our mother earth whose fruit Ads all the glory to it! Where all things generate with delight, And feeling appetite. Stel. I don't abjure societie, 'Tis fate commands Antipathie. Dam. The Sun whose powr'full influence Actuates each soul with sence, Inflames chast Turtles with desires; And can you want such fires? Stel. Yes: and that bird shal imitate That lives without a mate. Dam. Th'Arabian foul is chast alone Because it is but one: For had wise Nature made them two, They wu'd like Doves and Sparrows do. Stel. Yet the chast Phænix is admir'd, And thought the rarest bird. Dam. No: she is Natures wonder, 'cause She only breaks her laws; For which a Martyr in desire, She penance doth in fire. Stel. But I shall die with cold. Dam. How then Can you inflame us men? Stel. Although mine eie may sparkle, yet My heart is frozen quite. Chorus. With warm embraces, hot desires, And with loves soft yet active fires, Let's warme each other til we prove One flaming sacrifice to Love. Clarastella playing sweetly on the Lute. That empty guts of beasts, and hollow wood, So rare a sound should make, what mortal wu'd Believe? did he not see what heav'nly hand Made the strings move and breath, at whose command They died, or Ecchoed from the sacred Quire Lays, did our souls as wel as them, inspire? His lost Euridice when Orpheus won, Alas, his skil compar'd with thine, was none: He only taught the rocks to dance, you move Each stony heart, inflam'd by you, to love; Then with your powr'ful and enchaunting hand Turn us to stones agen, and make us stand Like unmov'd Statues, whilst amazed we Attend the voice of heav'ns blest harmonie, How the Gods listen to her graceful ayrs Attentive as to Saints devouter pray'rs? Wishing shee'd in those dying sounds expire In swanlike extasie, to fil their quire! Hark how she whispers from that holy bow'r, An Ep'taph for each wounded Auditour! While from her sweeter hand the warbling lyre Borrows that sweetnes we so much admire. Toucht by her quickning joints the active strings Leap to expresse their joys, whilst the sound brings Such new delight; I could but wish this blisse, That hearing her, I had no sense but this. To Clarastella. Loves enterteinment. When Love was exild Heav'n, and to and fro For want of friends did here a begging go, To seek relief, in this sad pilgrimage I entertein'd the Youth my mænial page. And though he was of many held in scorn, Yet knew I he was of a Goddesse born. For whose fair sake I took him home, and laid Him in the fairest lodging that I had. I cloath'd the hunger sterved wretch when he Was almost dead for cold and misery: Daily I fed him with my sighs, and in My tears he quencht his thirst and bath'd his skin. Encourag'd thus the lad-grew sawcie, he Would from a servant now a Master be. First he entic'd my thoughts and cuningly Wrought their consent to the Conspiracie; Then he fast bound my senses by surprise, That so he might at th'Porthole of mine eys Bring in's Associate; then set th'fort on fire, Having betraid the breastworks to desire. You are that Goddesse hatcht and sent this spie, I therefore do forgive his treacherie. (Fair Empresse) now y'have got it by a wile, I'l teach you how to keep it: with a smile. On Clarastella walking in the Snow that dissolved assoon as it came near her or the ground she trod on. When Heav'ns Mercurial drops flew gently down, As they would cloath not pierce the ground; Yet they no sooner landed and faln near Her Glories, but 'twixt grief and fear Lest by her candor their's should be outvyd, In Envies tears dissolving di'd. So have I seen bright falling Stars in show, Quench in dark gellies here below, When they false Meteors did (descended) spie A truer light in Stella's eie: Thus not hearts only when her warmth is felt But Snow and fire it self do melt. To Clarastella. Loves Silence. Ay me! when I Am blind with passion why Should my best reason speechlesse prove? Doth joyes excesse (Which words can nere expresse) In silent Rhetorick speake my love? If so; each smother'd sigh wil vent my smart, And say, I love not with my tongue, but heart. But oh! if She (Blind boy!) should chance to be As deaf, as my discourse is dumb, Ile never more Thy Deitie adore, Or to thee 'ere for refuge come. O when thou see'st me stand thus mute and blind, For pitties sake (my Stella!) then be kind! Know that such love Like Heav'ns comes from above, And is beyond expression large; Language is weak, And should I strive to speak Words would but lessen not discharge. My Loves deep Sea's as silent as profound: Ful Caskes stand mute, only the empty sound. Clarastella distrusting. You say you love me, nay can swear it too, But stay Sir t'wil not doe; I know you keep your oathes Just as you wear your cloathes; Whilst new, and fresh in fashion; But once grown old you lay them by, Forgot like words you speak in passion, I'le not believe you, I. To Clarastella affrighted at the sight of a Cats fiery eies in the dark, which caused her to shreik. Thy shril voyce pierc'd each apprehensive ear Deep, as thy heart could smitten be with fear; That, if I had not known the tongue, I could Ha 'wisht it out: but since fate pleas'd I should Be thus o'th' sudden thunder-strucken, why Saw I no lightning from thy troubled eie? Forewarnd thus had I been forearm'd, and though Prevented not, I had foreseen the blow. Ne'r weeping Stag, thus frighted, cry'd so loud Though by his thirstie foes so close pursu'd, As thou (fair) Stella at the sight of that Some Heathen worship as their God, a Cat, VVhose glaring eies did unexpected shine But with like wonder for to gaze on thine. And as they at ful Moon encrease: so now The fulness of your glory swell'd them too. Since lightning flew from each amazed eie, I mar'l not such a clap did follow, I. On a Fleabite espied on her fair hand. Behold how like a lovely fragrant Rose Midst a fair Lillie bed, Or set in Pearl like a bright Rubie shows, This little spot of red! Art could not die a Crimson half so good As this was made by th'tincture of her bloud. The cunning Leech knew that the richest bloud In azure veins did lie; Choosing thy young soft tender flesh for food Resolv'd thus to feed high: Thus being Nectar-fill'd and swell'd with pride, He thinks he's now to you by bloud alli'd. O how I envy thee smal creature, and Ev'n wish thy shape on me, That so I might but kisse that sacred hand That giveth life to thee! That which I hardly now can cover'd kisse, Then I might naked touch and tast my blisse. And though for drawing so much guiltles bloud Thou wel deserv'st to die, With a gold chain about thy neck, I wu'd Have thee kept daintilie As Scaliger's was in a box; and shown As Stella's gentle Fairie up and down. On the taking of an Amethist ring from off Clarastella's finger as she was sleeping. Thou sacred stone whose native heat preservs Man as he was created, rational, Infuse thy virtues through my Optick nervs! Thus while thy temp'rance I behold, I shal In stupid draughts my health and reason ne'r enthral. Rubies that most resemble flames, are so Devoid of heat no fire can warm them, wine Thus though this cheerful stone resembles too Scorns yet to stoop to Bacchus reeling Vine Or let his Oppium prey upon his sprite divine. Thou more enchanted than was Gyges ring Keep then my souls eys ope while others lie Steept, or transform'd in wild Lyæus sing Io's to madness, yet do thou let me Unseen but to my self approach this Deitie. How't blushes for me at the guilt of this High sacrilege! Yet though from her I got This virtue sleeping, she not plundred is. Fair Stella wears a better Antidote Both for and 'gainst the falling sickness: wot you wat? Loves Expiration. By custom who so bold as he That cannot see? Yet I by sad experience find, My love's most modest when mine eies are blind: Why should my coward tongue else fear to tel My she Physician I'm not wel, Whose only art Can cure the passion of the heart? Why dost thou show such crueltie (Young Boy) on me? Wast not enough to wound my heart? Then to add blindness to my former smart, But make me speechless that I cann't complain? Thus hopeless to be wel again? What punishment Is grief that cannot find a vent? Ah Cupid! if thou wilt that I For her must die Let me but tel her first 'twas she, She only that did cause my maladie. Assist my tongue with so much courage, I May tel her 'tis for her I die! Perhaps my grief May thus discharg'd, find some relief. On a Christal Watch presented to Clarastella. Thou careful Steward of my precious time I now transmit thee to a hand sublime And heav'nly, that wil guide thy measures wel, See that to her thou truth dost alwaies tel. When she lies down to rest, then Watch to chuse Let thy soft motion quiet sleep infuse. But when she waking turns her in her bed Then be thou nimbly busie 'bout her head. Put her in mind of me! and to her say Though she lies stil, yet the time poasts away: Charge her not lose it then! but to her show When it is time to love! then let her know That as thou so I restless watch her, and My watchful thoughts a guard about her stand. Stand, at that happy hour, I find her kind, Then let thy speedy wings no motion find. Go only fast when she retards in love, Then poast to short the time, then nimble prove! True Emblem of my love this Watch I send, Which to your careful keeping I commend: The ballance like my heart, when that beats slow Then fast, doth my disorderd passions show: The string that holds al, is from Cupids bow, If that should break alas it would not go: The Christal case that keeps it, is mine eie, Through which you may the sev'ral motions spie. The Wheels are my affections which wil stand, If you not move them with your gentle hand: Oh when it slowly goes then raise it higher, That from thy touch it may new life acquire! 'Tis in your power to make it by a trick Go fast or slow, by turning of the nick. Let it not once go down! Watches you know With little rest they oft forget to go: Love like the Sun should ever active be, Which when 't declins, it riseth instantly. Of Love and Liking. To like or not to like, doth lie In the election of a curious eie: But should I only what I see approve, This were but liking and not love. Or t'would be general, as Boys At the first sight long for their glorious toys, Which they embrace til fresh varietie Shews fairer objects to the eie. Go Muse! and let my Stella know I like her person wel: but tel her too! I love her soul with mine, and thus I find When out of sight she's in my mind. Dialogue between Sylvio and Mirtillo. Syl.Tel me (if ever you did feel The pow'r of Cupids fatal steel) Why the young Tyrant ads disdein Thus to compleat a true loves pain? Why faithful Lovers seldom prove Belov'd again of those they love? Myrt. Oh 'tis because true Lovers are Too servil fond, and Women care For things though good if easie, lest: The dear and hard to get please best. For should we them but less adore, They'd punish less and love us more. Syl. But when the Amorist doth find His love rebukt by some unkind Repulse, why doth he yet admire? And with sick hopes stil feed desire? Himself afflicting thus in vain With hopes of what he cann't obtein? Myrt. Ah Sylvio! Love is a disease That doth o'th' vital spirits ceaze, Whose dregs time only must expel: Hunger in sick folks doth foretel Deaths sad approach, so lovesick men When that's a dying rave agen. Syl. Why doth he not then strugling trie Or to shake off this Lethargie, Or as some peevish sick men use, Deny'd what they would have, refuse All comfort, and with like disdein Since She despises hate again? Myrt. True lov's not like an Ague fit That doth of cold and heat admit; 'Tis a quotidian feaver that With constant heat doth thirst create. That with its warmth doth make each day Summer, and knows no Month but May. Repent not then thy wel plac't love, though she With the like coyness slight its modestie! For who asks doubting lest he should obtein, Instructs his Mistress to a coy disdein. To Clarastella. Loves Constancie. 'Tis no terrestrial fire Doth with such heat my brest inspire, For then your beauties Sun Had lookt it to pale ashes long agon. 'Tis a Promethean flame Bright as the Orbs from whence it came, So heav'nly and divine, Immortal too, that feeds this heart of mine. Think not (fair Stella) then That I can be inconstant, when That love can never die That borrows flames from your celestial eie. To Clarastella upon a favour received from her which she tied in my hat. Madam! the favour I received from you I have it in such high esteem That men might justly deem Me proud of it, 'cause to the open view, I wear it alwaies in my hat, There to be wondred at. Ruling in chief there in bright Majestie It doth command all caps to vail And say to it, all hail: As if they spi'd in that some Deitie, The colours they are so divine And with such raies do shine. As forreign ships yield homage whey they see Great Britains streamers spread on high And purpling all the skie: So when these Rosie royal colours be Displaid, then each Spectatour knows That they are yours, and bows. Juno's gay bird boasts not so brave a plume Nor in its greatest pride doth shine Like this fair flow'r of thine. Me thinks I look like Memnon, could assume A generals place and overthrow Englands resisting foe. A Hector fit for Mars or Venus war Under these colours I could fight Me thinks both day and night; Attempt bold deeds, kil those my rivals are, And through revenge on each black tongue That shal thy honour wrong. Wonder not at this valour! for I know Under your favour, I would conquer you. Clarastella's Indictment. My heart was slain when none was by But only you and I: Durst it self do this act? No: a strange hand did shoot that dart Which peirc'd so deep my heart, Nor could I do the fact. Then I'm o'th' fact acquitted, now The guilt must lie on you; I wil enquire no further; The proof is plain, the Boy that lies Hid in your cruel eies, Did do this wicked murther. Witness your lips all staind with red, They speak who did the deed, The Crimson bloud sticks there, And makes them at each blush confess (For they dare do no less) And cry we guiltie are. Your pale and self-accusing look As soon as ere he strook Proclam'd you accessorie: And your distorted angry brow Your ful assent did show, To make my death a Storie. In your hearts trembling doth appear Your more than guilty fear: You'r by your tongue bewraid, Which silently accusing, tels That 'twas by you, none els, My heart was first betraid. By signs thus murther's oft reveal'd Though it lie long conceal'd: This doom I wish you then, If stil a cruel mind you bear, May each man prove, when ere You love, unkind agen. On the loss of a Gold-open-ring in which some of Clarastella's hair was enclosed. Dear Gold not in thy own self precious now, But for that more intrinsic value thou Enclosest, which rich treasure makes thee more Refin'd, and hallow'd than thou wast before, (Though had that finger dropt, thou once didst grace, I had susteind that fatal loss with less Regret) Farwel! Yet thou dear Relique that Li'st here entombd and buried in this vaut Of Indian clay, which now thy corps must hold, Thou didst deserve a richer urn than gold. May then that happy he shal find thee; kiss, And then adore this unknown Shrine of bliss! Whose worth, since he can never know, but fear Some magick spels within, and so not dare To wear thee: thus afflicted, may he bring It back to me, and I'l uncharm the Ring. But thee in vain on earth, I hope to see, Ile search the Heavens, for there thou next wilt be: And whereas Berenices hair was cut, And at the Lyons seavn-stard tail was put, Thy hair shal shine yet higher in his head, And's neck shal with this Ring be collared. To Clarastella saying she would commit her selfe to a Nunnerie. Stay Clarastella, prithee stay! Recal those frantick vows again! Wilt thou thus cast thy self away As wel as me in fond disdain? Wilt thou be cruel to thy self? chastise Thy harmless body, 'cause your pow'rful eies Have charm'd my senses by a strange surprise? Is it a sin to be belov'd? If but the cause you could remove Soon the effect wou'd be remov'd: Where Beautie is, there wil be love. Nature that wisely nothing made in vain, Did make you lovely to be lov'd again: And when such beauty tempts, can love refrain? When Heav'n was prodigal to you, And you with beauties glory stor'd, He made you like himself for view, To be beheld, and then ador'd: Why should the Gold then fear to see that Sun, That form'd it pure? why should you live a Nun, And hide those raies Heav'n gave to you alone? Oh do not exile Natures bliss! Do not Eclipse so great a Sun! Imprison not a Paradise In a Religious dungeon! Let the foul witch laze in her smokie cel; Onely black toads in recluse vaults do dwel: Fair Angels live in light, the soul in Hel. I know 'twas you fair thief that stole My heart away; nor thus content Your cruel eies then pickt a hole In that which ne'r before was rent. And dost thou now this heart hence think to carrie? Or being guilty darst no longer tarry, And so to shreive thee, fly'st to Sanctuarie? Nor is this all; your theft was higher Than was Prometheus, who did take From Heav'n that quick inspiring fire, Of clods, us, living men to make: You to Heav'ns treasurie did find a way Where all the Beauties and the Virtues lay, And thence by rapine didst them all convey. Guiltie of which high sacrilege, Dost thou now mean to satisfie The Gods, and give thy body pledge To expi'ate thy souls theeverie? Stay Votresse! enter not this Nunnerie! For thus thou wilt but draw more guilt on thee, By tempting others to Idolatrie: For when thy Glory they shal see, Either they'l all forget to pray; Or what's as bad, they'l pray to thee, And turn devotion to play: Nor wil the Gods unto thy prai'rs incline, If thou shouldst stil continue deaf to mine. Stay then fair Saint! and make my bed thy shrine! Thy self a holy Temple art Where Love shal teach us both to pray, I'l make an Altar of my heart, And Incense on thy lips wil lay. Thy mouth shal be my Oracle; and then For beads we'l tel our kisses o'r agen, Til they breath'd from our souls, shal cry Amen. The Quære. What is Love? 'Tis a child of Phansies getting, Brought up between Hope and Fear, Fed with smiles, grown by uniting Strong, and so kept by Desire: 'Tis a perpetual Vestal fire Never dying, Whose smoak like Incense doth aspire, Upwards flying. It is a soft Magnetick stone, Attracting hearts by sympathie, Binding up close two souls in one, Both discoursing secretlie: 'Tis the true Gordian knot that ties Yet ne'r unbinds, Fixing thus two Lovers eies Aswel as minds. 'Tis the spheres heavenly harmonie Where two skilful hands do strike; And every sound expressively Marries sweetly with the like: 'Tis the worlds everlasting chain That all things ti'd, And bid them like the fixed wain Unmov'd to bide. 'Tis Natures law inviolate, Confirm'd by mutual consent Where two dislike, like, love, and hate, Each to the others ful content: 'Tis the Caress of every thing; The Turtle-dove; Both birds and beasts do offrings bring To mighty Love. 'Tis th'Angels joy, the Gods delight, Mans bliss, 'Tis all in all: without love nothing is. To Clarastella on St. Valentines day morning. Hark how the Lyrick Choristers o'th' wood Warble their cheerful noats! which understood Would make us think they woo'd and spake In pure Tibullus phrase, when he did take His Lesbia to him! how they sing And chirp it merrily To welcome in that verdant spring. Which makes our blood run high! Arise then heavy Muse! now winter's done And the warm pleasant Summer is begun; Arise! and charge Aurora wake, And weare her best array for this daies sake! Salute her first whom I'd injoy, And then let all the nine To their sweet musick dance and sing That this daies Valentine. Great Bishop! whose more sacred memorie Crowns this blest day with due solemnitie, Let me invoke thy holy Shrine To guide me to another Valentine! Lend me thy urns fair light awhile With the Morns brighter eies, To find that happy Shee, and steal Upon her by surprise. Assist me Jove! in thy gilt showrs convey Me to the bed to my bright Danae! Lest I be blasted or betrai'd By the quick eies of some crackt chambermaid, Got up on purpose to be seen; And though she stand i'th' way, Blind me t'all but my Valentine! Til I approach her day! Or lend me Gyges old enchanted ring That I may walk invisible! and bring Me thus lockt up in close disguise To the blest place where this fair beauty lies! Thus undiscern'd I'l pass the street, Nor see, nor yet be seen Of any until we two meet (My dearest Valentine.) Some draw their Valentines by lotterie Whom they perhaps ne'r saw before, but I Make a far wiser choice in mine, Where Love elects discreetly by design: Some on their hats in wafer scrowl Their names have charact'red, I on my heart thy name enroul, More easie to be read. See the true windows of the perfum'd East! Breathing such odours that each sense may feast To luxurie! oh 'twould suffice To live but one hour in this Paradise! Then haste to kisse her balmie hand, To kiss her shal I fear? I'l gently draw the curteins, and Let the bright day appear. Behold where Innocence her self doth lie Clad in her white array! Fair Deitie! I'l onely print upon her dewy lip One loving kiss and so away will part. Shee wakes, and blushes on each cheek So red, that I may say There on each side doth truly break The dawning of the day. Startle not Fairest! It is I am come Like th'Persian to adore the rising Sun: I'm come to view that sight wou'd make The good old man ev'n for thy onely sake Wish him alive agen, to see Such a fair Saint of's name, Whose virtues propagate in thee To his eternal fame. 'Tis I am come, who but a Friend before Am hap'ly now by fate adopted more, A brother or what els you deem To be more neer, or of more high esteem. I'm come to joyn in sacrifice To our dear Valentine; Where I must offer to thine eies, Knowing no other Shrine. Large Hecatombs of kisses I wil lay On th'altar of thy lips, that men may say By their continuance we are true, And wil keep so this year, nor change for new. The birds instruct us to do so, The season too invites; When spring comes they a billing go, As we to our delights. Each am'rous Turtle now his Mate doth chuse, Whom Nature for that year by pow'rful use Taught to be constant: shal not wee Who love with reason be as firm and free? Here then our league let us begin, And from this minute count Thousands of kisses that within This year shal thus amount. How sweet shee breaths! the Zephyre wind that blows Fresh fragrant odours on the modest Rose Sends forth not half so pure a smel As that which on thy chaster lips doth dwel: Here in this holy Temple I Could fix eternally, And pay these vows until I die Pitied of none but thee. Me thinks my arms now grasp a treasure more Worth than both Indies valued double o'r. 'Tis pitty we should ever part, I should be poor, if rob'd of thee my heart: The t'other kiss, and though I surfet on The sweetness of thy breath, The blame shal lie me on alone: Who'd not die such a death? To Clarastella in a storme at Sea. Be not afraid (fair Venus of the Sea) These waves but haste to view thy Majestie; Glad to receive thee thus in shoals they croud With plaudities expressing joys aloud: Neptune results and with his watry lip Gladly saluteth that more happy ship That bears so rich a treasure; knowing that He a more precious gem did ne'r create: Thus Triton and the Seagreen Gods do wear Their fresh and best array when you appear; As Virgins welcom spring; whereas before With sad stil blackness they stood clouded o'r: Thus the proud billows come but to admire, To raise thy worth and thus advance thee higher; While they obsequiously about you throng To guard your person, not to do you wrong: Thus they approach with pure affection Offering their backs for you to ride upon; Where if the waters troubled do appear 'Tis 'cause they in your brow suspect a fear. You great Commandress both by Sea and Land, Why should you then fear ought? at whose command Rough Boreas and the Ocean doth obey, And to its Queen thus tribute strives to pay. I am this Ship tost in the waves of fear, You the Pole-star by which I only steer: Love the unskilful Pilot cannot sail Homewards if you not blow a gentle gale From your sweet Zephire breath and send relief, 'Twil suffer shipwrack in a Sea of grief. In your smooth face let but a calm appear, Both shal be happy and both free from fear. To her, the Storm ceasing. How Neptune smiles to view this Deitie Which all the hoarie Gods amaz'd to see, Are at a stand and cannot move When they behold this Queen of Love! Thy brow not wrinkled now with fear, the sea Resumes its smoothness by a Sympathie: And whilst thou smil'st the rougher main Is levell'd to a verdant plain. A happy Halcyon calmness sits upon The equal face of all the Ocean: And not a wave his head dares show While thus in triumph you do go. With such fair Wind and Weather, oh let me Sail alwaies! and I ne'r shal sea-sick be! On Clarastella walking in her Garden. See how Flora smiles to see This approaching Deitie! Where each herb looks young and green In presence of their comming Queen! Ceres with all her fragrant store, Could never boast so sweet a flow'r; VVhile thus in triumph she doth go The greater Goddess of the two. Here the Violet bows to greet Her with homage to her feet; There the Lilly pales with white Got by her reflexed light; Here a Rose in Crimson die Blushes through her modestie; There a Pansie hangs his head 'Bout to shrink into his bed, 'Cause so quickly she past by Not returning suddenly; Here the Currans red and white In yon green bush at her sight Peep through their shady leaves, and cry Come eat me, as she passes by; There a bed of Camomil, VVhen she presseth it doth smel More fragrant than the perfum'd East, Or the Phœnix spicie nest; Here the Pinks in rowes do throng To guard her as she walks along, There the flexive Turnsole bends Guided by rhe raies shee sends From her bright eies, as if thence It suckt life by influence; VVhilst She the prime and chiefest flow'r In all the Garden by her pow'r And onely life-inspiring breath Like the warm Sun redeems from death Their drooping heads, and bids them live To tel us Shee their sweets did give. On the loss of Clarastella's black fan. Tel me (fair wonder!) when the gentle air Courted your wanton hair, And hov'ring 'bout your face did beg a kiss, Proud of so great a bliss, Why did your envious Fan to it denie So chast a libertie? Nor yet contented onely thus to do Why did you hide it too? Why did you blind those lamps which both adorn, And can mislead the Morn? Believe me 'twas unkindly done to skreen That light was to be seen. Though the bright lustre of your orient eies Like the more pow'rful skies Or dazles me or sets my heart on fire When I so high aspire, Your Bas'lisk look with its bewitching art Though it strike dead my heart, And I stand Planet-struck when e'r I view So fair a star as you; Yet do I languish like the drooping night In absence of your light: (For by your beams such warmth I do receive By which alone I live) That if you draw a cloud before this light, 'Tis with me darkest night. VVhen Morpheus once had on my drowsie bed His sable mantle spread And drawn the curtains of Heav'ns Canopie, Had veild the starry skie, In this Cimmerian slumber as I lay, Me thought I wisht for day, Expecting when the rosie-fingred Morn Should the black earth adorn, When with his early raies he should affright The mistie shades of night, At last he came, and I beheld his steeds Deckt in their Royal weeds, And fair Aurora purpling all the skie, Enlightned ev'ry eie, How glad was I? and wisht that never night Might mask so great a light. You were that Phospher I thus long'd to see Hid in obscuritie; And now your lustre breaks forth like the day Clad in her best array. Oh happy loss! by which I gain a sight As precious as the light! To Clarastella on a Nosegay of flowers which she wore at her bosome. If Bees extract their sweetness from each flow'r, As these, theirs, from your breast; I thee devour Alive then (Stella!) when I honey eat; Rare food! than Attick-flow'rmel far more sweet! Yet as rob'd flow'rs preserve their smel, stil fair, So these fresh in thy bosomes garden are, Though blown on, whose sweet dewes and Sun above, Make them grow there feed us, stil fragrant prove. There's scarce a sense, but those thy flow'rs delight, They please the touch, the tast, the smel, the sight; Yet thou the choisest dost this all, and moe, Thou sweetly dost our hearing ravish too. Since like those subtle Chymists then, you take Sweetness from them too, one more exact to make, Thy self, which Nectar art, oh hiv'd might I Feed on thy Honey, and there melting lie! Song. [Invest my head with fragrant Rose] Invest my head with fragrant Rose That on fair Flora's bosome grows! Distend my veins with purple juyce That mirth may through my soul diffuse! 'Tis Wine and Love, and love in wine, Inspires our youth with flames divine. Thus crown'd with Paphian myrtle, I In Cyprian shades wil bathing lie, Whose snow if too much cooling, then Bacchus shal warm my blood agen. 'Tis Wine and Love, &amp;c. Life's short, and winged pleasures flie; Who mourning live, do living die: On down and flouds then Swan-like I Wil stretch my limbs, and singing die. 'Tis Wine and Love, and love in wine Inspires our youth with flames divine. On Clarastella discovered sleeping in her bed. Sleep gentle soul! and may a quiet rest Crown the sweet thoughts that harbour in thy brest! Keep her ye pow'rs divine! let no foul sight Afflict her mind! no horrours of the night, No fearful shapes or Apparitions Disturb her slumbers through sad visions! I charge thee Morpheus thou pale God of sleep, See thou from her distempers, startings keep! Let all her dreams be Golden! let them taste Of heav'nly pleasures! let them all be chast Delights, Embraces, Wishes, and such new And prosp'rous hopes, as may at length prove true! Show her rich Crowns and Garlands! then let love Chast as her sleep, such as the Gods above Enjoy, steal in her mind, and represent The perfect Image of her blest content! There let her fix and entertain awhile A parley with her thoughts! then let her smile As pleas'd at th'conference, or some other way By a soft sigh let her her love betray! Thus please each sense with various delight And with fresh sights prevent her appetite! Thus let her sleep secure, that she may find At once both ease in body and in mind! I charge you wake her not! no noise draw neer Her bed to whisper in her quiet ear! See how my charms have workt! behold she lies Like Innocence her self in white! her eies Shut 'gainst all worldly vanitie, do show How little she regards this earth below: Her soul within, though active, yet is stil, Which speaks the calmness of her inward will. The Zephyre wind doth not more gently blow Nor with so soft or stil a motion slow As her sweet breath from her; here we may find The even pace of a wel-temper'd mind. Bless me! what thoughts possess my ravisht soul, And stir my blood, I can them not controul! I'm all enflam'd; and yet I dare not do What the fair harmless object prompts me too. She stirrs; Oh! I must vanish quickly hence, Lest I should wake her, with some violence. To her at departure. They erre That think we parred are Two souls in one we carry, Half of which though it travel far Yet both at home do tarry. The Sun When farthest off at Noon Our bodies shade draws higher: My soul your's shadow, when I'm gone, Waits closer through desire. Dear heart Then grieve not 'cause we part, Since distance cannot sever: For though my body walks apart Yet I am with you ever. Elegiack Song. Lend me ye flouds your tears! oh more! Lend me al Neptun's watry store When he drownd all mankind! that I May in this deluge drown and die! She's dead to me: unhappy fate, That love, which burnt so clear of late, Is now extinct: oh help! and I Wil weep hers and mine obsequie. To Cupid. Song. Thou that hast shot so many hearts With thy enchanted darts! (Young Archer!) if thou hast one more In all thy store, Send it, oh send it to my Love, Wing'd with the feathers of thy Mothers Dove! Or head it with the same desire, Thou didst my shaft enspire! Or take thine arrow back from me! 'Tis crueltie Sometimes not to be cruel: Oh! Or smite both hearts, or els unbend thy bow! To a Lady wearing a Looking-glass at her girdle. Gaze not on that fair Mirrour, where you see Nought but the shadow of your frailtie lie, VVhere beautie staies no longer then you look On the gilt outside of that rotten look Your self; where all's but dust without, and such Foul leaves within: why then admir'd so much? Since nothing can be lov'd but what hath been Known to the sence, or to the eie bin seen, VVhy should you doat upon that face which you Never yet saw, nor have the pow'r to do? VVhose very shape when you have often pri'd And re-examin'd every part, and spi'd VVith strictest eie each line, and symmetrie, Is clean forgot, when you remove your eie: Which usual instance may instruct you not To studie that, which is so soon forgot. Since you nor see your self, nor look upon That form but thus by meer reflection: How know you? or why think you are fair? Is it, 'cause fond admirers say you are, For want of judgement? or some flattring Asse, Or this a great deal more dissembling glasse Tels a fair storie to your cred'lous eie, VVil you believe such Romance historie? VVhen the spruce gallant courts your hand, and vows Saluting it, he nothing whiter knows, Then gazing upward on that heav'nly sphere, Swears you are Angel-like beyond compare, Excelling all your sex, can you conceive That to be true, which he did least believe? VVhen th'am'rous youth looks Babies in your eies And through Loves flatt'ring optick he espies At the wrong end a world of beautie there, Blinded with passion thus 'twixt hope and fear, VVhen he protests he thinks he sees in you Some God-like form, can you believe it too? VVhen knowing men dissemble truth; alas! VVil you then trust a dumb deceitful glass? Embrace your selfe? and like Narcissus pore Upon that Chrlstal til you start a flow'r? (VVhich fades as soon as blown,) admiring more That part your selfe, then others all the store? Then quit that coz'ning beam! nor imitate The Mermaid to be onely upwards neat VVith comb and glass in hand, when we all know You'ar either fish or what is worse, below. The blanched Swan with whitest plumes arrai'd Til by her own black skin and legs betraid Did think her self the fairest bird, do you But look about you, you'l appear so too. VVhat boots a comly presence, graceful eie, If all be foul except the Phisnomie? Wise men admire not beauty, birth or blood, How rich or fair, they ask not, but how good? First dresse your soul! see that be fair and clear, And then you'l truly beautiful appear. To Clarastella. 'Tis not your beautie I admire, Nor the bright star-light of each eie, Nor do I from their beams take fire My loves torch to enlighten, I: No: 'tis a Glorie more divine Kindles my tapour at your shrine. Your comly presence takes not me, Nor your much more inviting meen; Nor your sweet looks; the Graces be (Fair Creature!) in your picture seen. No: 'tis your soul to which I bow, 'Tis none of these I love, but you. How blind is that Philosophie Doth onely nat'ral bodies know? That views each Orb o'th' glorious skie, But sees not him that made it so. I love thy informing part, i'th' whol And every part, thy all; thy soul. The Farewel to Clarastella. Passion o' me! why melt I thus with griefe For her whose frozen heart denies reliefe? Find out some other way to punish me Yee Gods! and let me not the Author be Of mine own death! make me forget that e'r I lov'd! at least that e'r I loved her! Yet I must love her stil: O cruel Fate! That dost true love so il requite with hate! Why e'r I saw her didst not make me blind? Then had she as before continued kind Without pow'r to displease, her Charitie Warm as my Love, and I had stil been I: But now alas! my distant bliss I see, Which like my courted shadow flieth mee As fast as I pursue: ay mee! she's gone, And with her all my winged hopes are flown. But oh! if you one drop of mercy have, Let me request you shed it at my grave When y'hear I died for you! Oh let there be One tear at least shed from your pious eies In mem'ry that I fel your sacrifice! Where though I cannot, yet my marble wil 'Gainst these soft show'rs for me some tears distil. Fairest farewel! and by my living love, Maist thou to me when dead thus loving prove! Shed from your eies perhaps one faithful tear May make my ashes quick again, how e'r My shipwrackt love in these drops bath'd, at last May drowning grasp what's next, and hold thee fast, Which whilst I liv'd it could not; thus I wil Alive and dead (my Stella!) love thee stil. On the Report of Clarastella's death. Shee dead? forgive me Heav'n! I'ad almost swore That she 'bout her had nothing mortal wore: Her soul's immortal, and her body too Since't knew no actual sin, must needs be so. Our sins do drag us to our graves, but she Had no such harbingers; her Pietie Made her a Monarch in Divinitie, And taught her how to live eternally. It is not likely, guilty death shou'd take Such Innocence away from us, or make Immortal Virtue die: old Adam sure Had liv'd til now, could he have liv'd as pure And free from either act or thought of vice, Hee had surviv'd this age in Paradice. Our sins are our diseases; onely they Invoke pale death, whom we all must obey When he arrests us for these debts, we know Life's the cheap ransome for the sums we owe, VVhich she ne'r forfeited 'cause no disease Upon her body or her soul could seize, She was so sound and perfect: why should I Believe that Clarastella then could die? If wantonnesse durst steal into her mind 'Midst her sweet dreams, leaving a touch behind Of phansied pleasure, yet she wakt a maid, And blushing, that she should be thus betrai'd, By her own guiltlesse thoughts, she feard to tel Ev'n what her visions were; nor knew she wel What was their pleasant meaning; or if shee Did but by chance two Lovers kissing see; Shee thought they did but imitate the Dove Thus to affect with chast Platonick love. Her salutations deckt with modestie, Did like her smiles expresse humilitie. Thus was she perfect Virgin, whilst her love Knew n'other object but the Gods above. How then durst death, tow'rds her his dart advance, Whose onely sin was harmless ignorance? Why should I fondly drooping let mine eies Yeild at the news, a liquid sacrifice? Or let her dying rumour wound my years Whose virtue did deserve a Nestors years? I'l not believe then she is dead, since I Know she hath merited Eternitie: For were't, as envious Fame reports her gone, 'Twere but a happy transmigration, To Heav'n; where stil she lives a Saint, and we Do stil adore her living Deitie. To a Painter limning a Curtezan. Leave off fond Artist, can't your wanton eie Glance on a pleasant face, but presently You must go court her with your pencil, and Thus spoil th'invention of a witty hand? What need you paint her when the wicked Elfe, Fearing no colours, daily paints her self? What mean those naked dresses silks and lawn? When shee's much fitter to be hang'd then drawn? Wouldst thou expresse thy art and judgement? say Wouldst thou be fam'd? I'l tel you; thus you may. Paint me to life, a chast and virtuous Dame, Whose spotless honour speaks her stil the same, In whose smooth forehead let there be exprest What Virgin thoughts she harbours in her breast! Set forth her severall Graces! and her eie Make to betray a cheerful modestie? Her sober looks, and her aspect is free, Let them both innocent and simple be! Then in her cheeks express that blushing grace Which Vestal vows have printed in her face! Then let thy Phansie through her purer skin Transparent make her chaster soul within! When you have drawn this piece, then Painter see You not expose it to each common eie That cannot judge! to Lovers onely those, And not to lustful eies this piece expose? On the young and fair M?? M.H. her hair being unfortunately burnt by chance in the candle as she was Combing her head at night. Unluckie Traitour! could thy greedy flame Feed on such fuel, and not devoure the same? How durst thy dul pale flames so high aspire, And mix its lazie heat with Vestal fire? Oh how I grieve this direful chance? to see These fresh leaves falling from the blooming tree, And that the spring which was but now begun, Should thus o'th' sudden into Autumne run! Ah cruel Atropos! why so soon would you Thus rudely cut those threads of life in two; Those neat dishevel'd locks whose every grace Scorning arts help, set forth a neater face? With what pale horrour do I wondring see This sight, and fear what the event will be! Methinks it now portends some overthrow, Threatens some great mans ruine, and doth show Like lightning 'fore the thunder, bidding all Be arm'd against the stroak: or now I call To mind fair Helen Troy did so admire, Me thinks it represents that town on fire. Had this but Lillie seen he would have said It was some blazing Comet; and that head Which was thus crisped o'r with purest raies Was all a heav'nly Meteor, that did blaze Her Virtues forth to the worlds open eie As Emblem of her rare divinitie. Or had mistook thee in this borrow'd light For brightest Phœbe Mistresse, of the night, By those bright Star-like tapours of thine eies. Oh may another lovely Phœnix rise From these sweet ashes, whose sad fun'ral pile With fragrant odours thus perfumes our Isle! But thou curst light that wroughtst this Tragedie, In thy own flames maist thou a martyr die. Writ on Clarastella's Busk. Might I o' nights in thy room lie 'Twixt Stella's warmer mounts of snow, So neer her heart dissolving, I No higher Paradise would know: Such envi'd bliss would make me stray, VVhither the Gods themselves would bow, And leave heav'ns upper milkie way, To breath in happier shades below. Deploring Clarastella's Inconstancie. Fair and yet cruel? strange me thinks that art Should act amiss, where Nature plai's her part! Can you a gentle Saint, a Tyrant prove? Can your diviner soul forget to love? Can Winter set in such a love-warm brest Which was with so much heat but now possest? Are the flames dying, and loves active fires Congeal'd to frosts, and freez'd to cold desires? And those fair Violet veins the verdant Spring Did so enliven now no heat can bring? Can you that carried Summer in your lips Red as the Cherrie suffer an Eclipse? That in the Apples of your cheeks did wear A fertile Autumn now no fruit can bear? All heat extinguisht? not one spark of fire— Now left, but to inkindle new desire? Strange mixture this, when I at once may view— All the four seasons of the year in you! Some health for pitty to my hopes restore? Or love me not at all, or love me more! Under this Equinox my shadows are Quite round me; whilst I live in black despair; Frigid nor torrid zones can I endure: They bred cold Agues, these a Calenture. Loves Hæsitation. To Clarastella. Why should I love that thing Can no affection bring? Since reason doth from liking draw Reciproque friendship, shall I thaw When her love freezeth? tel me why When she disdaineth, should not I? Yet Loves Religion Bids me love, though she frown; By whose more sacred lawes Heav'n knowes We are enjoyn'd to love our foes: Though she reject me then, yet I Must love my Stella, til I die. Love! I your pow'rs obey True love can ne'r decay: And since that Virtue lives in you Which made me like, and love you too At first; I am oblieg'd, and I Must love thee to Eternitie. To Clarastella admiring her black Eies and Hair. Let others Court the Cyprian Queen, Gilt tresses, or the Amber skin! Give me black eies and hair, Presum'd the face be fair, And a Seraphick soul within! The Swan though black below, above Is the white object of our love, So is Juno's prouder bird, For her black eies admir'd And 'cause they are so, I yours approve, Apelles limning a faire maid, Let fall by chance his pen, and said That though he meant it not, Yet could not mend the blot, It did expresse so rare a shade. If shadowes best set forth a face, Adorning it with beauties grace, Then are you onely fair, Whose form beyond compare, Excels the birth of humane race. In your bright eies decipher'd are The Ev'ning and same morning star, Sole Glorie of the Night, Deckt with such raies of light, No day can boast so rich by far. The Lovers Torch doth burn most bright Like Comets in the darkest night; And the black Boy stil roves, In sap and shadie groves, And like you crowns Loves sweet delight. To Clarastella complaining of my long kisses. Madam! I vow I never knew One creature of your sex till you, Find fault with what was long in men. Oh do not geld my Phansie then! Nor blame my pleasures extasie, That when each sense is feasted, I Thus tast each pure Ambrosiack kisse, And by degrees melt down my blisse. Oh those smooth, soft, and Rubie lips, That fright the Sun to an Eclipse, Whose Rosie and Virmilion hue Betray the blushing thoughts in you: Whose fragrant Amoratick breath Wou'd revive dying Saints from death, Whose Syren-like harmonious air Speaks musick and enchants the ear; VVho would not hang? and fixed there VVish he might know no other sphere? Oh for a charm to make the Sun Drunk, and forget his motion! Oh that some palsie or lame gout Would cramp old times diseased foot! Or that I might, or moult or clip His speedy wings, whilst on her lip I quench my thirsty appetite With the life honey dwels on it! Oh for a Crane-like neck that may This Nectar slowly thence convey! Then on this holy Altar, I Would sacrifice eternally, Offring one long continued mine Of Golden pleasures to thy shrine. I mean not Pompeys biting kiss Flora did so commend: nor his Venerious sip Catullus us'd Where lip-salve was from each infus'd No: a more holy chast impresse, May th'image of each mind expresse As perfect as the wax the seal: Such kisses do not wound, but heal. Kissing, thou sacred kissing art Onely the intellective part Of pleasure; by which union Our souls discourse and meet in one Fixt Center, whilst in a ful kiss Each am'rous line concentred is: Nor doth it violate Chastitie, Or forfeit like Adulterie. The dowry now, as heretofore, (when but to speak, or see, was more Immodest deem'd, at least as much, A Woman; as 'tis now to touch.) Thus with chast lips we blow Loves fire To a live coal; thus fan it higher: Thus do we seal affections band, VVhich onely death can cancel: and VVhilst both our hearts and lips do meet Thus do our souls each other greet: Thus we engender speaking Love Peculiar only to the Dove: Whereas all other bodies heat Of Lust doth them incorporate But only in the act; yet we Thus renew love t'eternitie With fresh unsated appetite, And without shame or sad regret; Which true experience doth prove The difference betwixt Lust an Love. Then let us kiss like Turtles, close Until we both seem one: til those That see our hearts saluting thus Shal not disturb, but envy us. Coyness in women makes men more Suspect they'l do behind the door: If thus you think I kiss too much; Know that my love to you is such, That whensoe'r it pleaseth you I'l closer kiss, drink deeper too. To Clarastella. Why Lovers walk round. 'Tis oft observ'd that those who are in love Do, when they walk, in spherick circle move; A motion to its nature genuine: So move the Heav'ns and Love that is divine And heav'n-deduced draws like that his gest A round, because that figure is the best. Love is a Labyrinth wherein wandring men Tread the same pensive measur's o'r agen: The Soul her feet th'affection guides, and moves To the same object that she truly Loves. Thus when I walk so often round, I move To thee the Center Nature bids me love. A Pastoral Protest of Love by Damon to Stella. When I thee all o'r do view I all o'r must love thee too. By that smooth forehead wher's exprest The candour of thy peaceful breast: By those fair twin-like-stars that shine, And by those apples of thine eyn: By the Lambkins and the Kids Playing 'bout thy fair eie-lids: By each peachie blossom'd cheek, And thy Sattin skin more sleek And white then Flora's whitest Lillies Or the maiden Daffadillies: By that Ivorie porch thy nose: By those double blanched rows Of teeth, as in pure Coral set: By each azure rivolet, Running in thy temples, and Those flowrie meadows 'twixt them stand: By each Pearl-tipt ear by Nature, as On each a Jewel pendant was: By those lips all dew'd with bliss, Made happy in each others kiss: By those pure Vermilion cherries Thy red nipples, and those strawberries Swimming there as set in cream: By those two curld locks, that seem To wreath thy Lover in wav'd art That from thee he ne'r should part: By those silk tresses soft as down Of tender Eunuches newly blown, That vail your body round when e'r In your own shades you'd less appear: By that silver stately neck Doth thy gems more grace and deck Then they can it: by those two Soft and wool-warme mounts of snow: By each Alablaster hand, And those slender joynts that stand So streight and closely set, each palm Seems a young tree, distilling balm: Midst that pregnant Hemisphear By the fair knot that's planted there: By those moving columns bear This Globe and the lov'd frame uprear: By those pretty nimble feet Wont in skilful measures meet: By the neat fabrick of the whole, Fair as the world from either Pole, Whose each part is Paradise, And Heav'n both in, and round, it is. By thy self, when thee I view I love thy all, and each part too.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Occasional POEMS Majores majora sonent, mihi parva locuto Sufficit, in vestras sæpe redire manus. Mart. li. 9. Ep. 1. To an old Gentlewoman that would have her Picture drawn. What strange impossibles are those That one fam'd Myron you impose? Drawn to the life you'd be you say, When you are dying every day; In colours too, when there's but one All o'r your face, and that is dun. Heel draw 'tis like thy shadows true, For thou art all but shadow'd blue. If fair then thou wu'dst counted be His pigments let him lay on thee, And with a trowel dawb and sleek The wroughcast of each wrinkled cheek, Else but in vain he shal on you Spend both his oyl and labour too. Drawn with black lead or with a coal Over some Alehouse chimney wal, Thy picture best wil semble thee By some rough Dialler; when he, Shal underwrite in meeter, this The widow of Sarepta is. Or 'twil shew best through lattice-work, Here an old woman, there the Turk. Yet if thou needs must have it done Let me say this in caution Unto thy Painter, that he plie And speed his work, or thou wilt die Before the third dayes sitting: when (If thou canst live so long) that then, (Because thoult ne'r be at th'expence To take thy il lookt figure thence) He would but send the piece to me; I'd rather have it far then thee, To hang up 'mongst my Sybels, or Foul Hags, lest some mistake thee for One of the Fatal Destinies Or Helbred Furies worse then these. But I'm afraid 'tis his design To sel thee for some Tavern sign, (If he not hang thee out a loof Oth' back oth' Change as weather proof) And I shal see thee thy ruin'd face Hang out in Southwark, old Queen Bess. Epithalamium Amatorium To Aurora. Why peeps the envious Morne so soon upon The pleasures of our bed? Pul back thy fierie coursers Phaeton! And drive not til I bid! And lest thy headstrong steeds their reins shu'd break, That Virgin girdle take I now unti'd! too soon for you it is And me, our rosie nests to leave, and rise. Have I so many tedious Suns beheld And nights in sighing spent, E'r to temptation I could make her yield? And would you now prevent The long-wisht harvest of my joys delight? Nor grant as long a night? Go back to thy lov'd Thetis bosome! go! Whilst in our beds wee'l sport it longer too. I'd have the world til we our curtains ope, Expect the Morning star, And from my glorious Darlings blushes, hope The Day may once appear: 'T shud be then alwaies night she saies, that we Might ne'r discover'd be. So might it be! for whilst she's in mine arme, In her Suns shade I'd keep me ever warme. On the strange unfortunate breaking of a Glass in a Tavern. Happy mischance! if happy I may cal What by so strange misfortune did befal! The Ganymede that had perform'd its trust, Discharg'd so many healths and them so just, Brok of it self, and falling to the ground, Foretold our fortunes if we kept the round. Had it surviv'd the Nectar thence did flow Our brains had crackt or els we faln as low. But tel me little glass my quondam friend! How didst thou come to this untimely end? Did any fatal or unluckie hand Throw thee to ruine 'gainst thy Joves command? No: 'twas a stranger fal; I rather think, The wine did make thee fal which thou didst drink. Though the diviner sack Immortal bee, The glasse that holds it yet may die I see. Drinking on a rainy day. Oh: 'tis a rainy drinking day! Come let it pow're Weel drink these clouds all drie away Suck every show'r The envious Earth shal not drink all, for we Our plants wil water too aswel as she. The clouds that fatness drop from heav'n Descend to us Ev'n to invite us reach them to enliven Our spirits thus: Then sink or swim, weel moisten thirsty care, And though the weather's foul, weel drink it fair. To one that hearing I had some faculty in Poesie, simply requested me to write somewhat on his dear wife lately dead. Had I so wel but known thy Ligbie, as Sire Adam once his Eve did know Then I might say thy wife a good one was: But I ne'r saw, nor knew her so. Wu'dst ha' me then extol her beauties fire? Most say she lookt, and painted wel! Should I her unknown secret parts admire, Or hidden qualities forthtel? Troth I ne'r heard one good she had, for what, Thou falsely thoughtst one, loving thee; Now's out of fashion, and esteem'd a fault. Then in her praise, I'l silent be; Since Silence best suits me as each of them: For Womens pride affecteth such Grosse flatt'ry, that who undertakes the theam; Speaks both too little, and too much. On Copernicus his opinion of the earths turning round. Copernicus was of opinion That the Earths globe by spherick motion Turn'd round, and that the Heav'ns were fixt: the man Was drunk sure or on shipboard, when his brain Hatcht this Mæander; for to such the land Doth only seem to move when they do stand. When Noahs floud had turn'd the land to Sea And the earth seem'd one floating Isle to be, The world then rid on waves indeed, and then Ith' Ark there was no terra firma seen: Yet true we find what was but Phansie then, (For th'world if we but understand the men That live therein) for they alas turn round And scotomized sail on firmest ground: Or drunk with madnes, with their poreblind eies Think States wel setled totter though they rise. A strange Vertigo or Delirium, Oth' brain it is, that thus possesses 'um; Whilst like to fashions grown Orbicular, Kingdomes thus turn'd, and overturned are: Nothing but fine Eutopian worlds ith' moon Must be new form'd by revolution. Nor doth the State alone on fortuns wheels Run round, alas our rock Religion, reels: We have saild so far the Antipodian way That into darkness we have turnd our day. Amidst these turnings 'tis some comfort yet, Heav'n doth not flie from us, though we from it. To one that was so impatient with the tooth-ach that he would not rest til all his teeth were drawn forth. How! branch and root? that's too severe, Let penal laws suffice! howe'r Do not extirpate the whole breed, Which one day you may so much need! That is the last and worst extream To 'stroy all, cause some are too blame. If your right hand offend, I know You may cut't off, your right eie too If that offend, pluck out: but 'sooth, I find not so you may one tooth: Unless perhaps in drink and heat With pots or candlesticks y'have beat Teeth out of this or that mans head, Then eie and tooth, for tooth indeed Should be repaid. But tel me when Your teeth are gone, what wil you then For grinders do? youl' learn to chew The cud, drink, and eat spoon-meat too? Suck agen wil you not? I'm sure That self-preservation Nature Commands: what should we more preserve Then teeth, whose want would make us sterve? Do we not live by them? who w'ud Deprive himself of's livelihood? But since you have an aking tooth To leave no jacks within your mouth, And are so far run mad with pain You are resolv'd to have all drane: Let not the Barbar-surgion set Them string'd on scarlet forth, but let Them in a box be kept, and shown For those that fel from that jawbone That Samson fought with; and I'l swear, That they the very Asses were. On Whip the Preaching Coachman. Drive right thou furious Jehu! that hast stept From the square coach-box and profoundly leapt To a round Preaching tub! O how he feels, With learning that he rub'd from horses heels, Himself inspir'd oth' sudden! now for th'cause And overthrow of all good humane laws! So Phaeton drove his car, which overturn'd Through headless furie, thus, the world it burnd. What a strange Metamorphosis is this? A frock turn'd to a linnen Ephod is; No Tailour Iohn of Leiden exstant now To consecrate this groom a Prophet too, As Becold did Tuscoverer? that then He in reward may crown him King agen. Like as Caligula when he did fein Himself a God, his great horse did ordein His Priest; a God and Prophet much alike, Both might have learnt of Baalams Ass to speak. Yet see how Muncers spirit reigns in him! And like phanatick Phifers makes him dream More revelations in one night, then th'old Patriarchs and Prophets visions did behold! Which phansied novels he doth oft obtrude To the weak faith oth' giddy multitude. Rotman or Cniperdolin never knew Such marks oth' godly as this Saint can shew: Whilst thus like Iohn Matthias, he contemns All books except the Bible, and condemns Each human Authour to the flames, that all Ith' mist of ignorance may prove mistical. Polygamie of Churches he doth cal, A fornication spiritual: When he expoundeth oh 'tis strange to see After large sighs, in what an extasie He speechless prays! just as the Darvises Amongst the Turks, so in a trance he is; These Prophets as they stile them, having run Round til they loose their breath, fal senceless down; And after some short sleep awaking tel Their studied dreams as from an Oracle. So this Enthusiast after many sighs And turnings of the egs of his twinckling eies, Streight Epileptick in this rapture grows, Where after many yawns and feined shows Of a transported mind, at last the Elf, Delivers nonsence like the mouth of Delph. Leave, leave thou russet Rabbi! leave for shame! And do not thus abuse that holy name And function of a Preacher! drive agen! Currie thy horses and not Christian men! Else prophane huckster with thy whip thou maist E'r long be scourg'd, and forth the Temple cast. On the unusual cold and rainie weather in the Summer. 1648. Why puts our Grandame Nature on Her winter coat, e'r summers done? What hath she got an ague fit? And thinks to make us hov'ring sit Over her lazie Embers? else why should Old Hyems freeze our vernal bloud? Or as we each day, grow older, Doth the world wax wan and colder? 'Tis so: See how nakt Charitie Sterves in this frozen age! whilst we Have no other heat but glow-worm zeal Whose warmth we see but cannot feel. All chang'd are Ceres golden hairs To clouded grey, and nought appears In Flora's dresse: our hopes do die And oth' sudden blasted lie. Heav'ns glorious lamps do wast away, The Elements themselves decay, And the mixt bodies mutinie By a rebellious sympathie; Whilst the distemper'd world grows pale, And sickning threatens death to all: So in an instant waters swept The old worlds monsters, whilst they wept It's funeral: but the new world's sins Are so deep di'd no floud can rinse. Nothing but lightning and Heav'ns fire Can purge our pestilential aire. Farewel to passionate Love. Farewel fond Love! I'l never bow Slave like unto my fetters I, Fair Sex! I'l not adore you now Yet love you as my libertie: Love grown adust with Melancholy, To madness turns or extream folly. About and with your fires I'l play But with as loose and gentle touch As boys from hand to hand toss away Live coals, lest they should burn too much. Too ne'r his heart who lets love come Suffers a wilful Martyrdome. Stout Souldiers in an Enemies land March not too far sans fear or wit, E'r they resolve or to withstand, Or wisely make a safe retreat. Bodies when joyn'd engaged are, Piqueering's better sport by far. The Excuse. To the Ladie E. B. Your lovely fair did first invite Me to that strange demand, Your wanton eie big with delight, Made me to understand You pleasant as your looks, where every glance Did raise and court my warm bloud to advance. Then blame not me for loving you, Who if alow'd would not do so? Henceforth I'l sit demure by you, Nor speak when you w'ud hear, Just as I w'ud your picture view, Behold you and admire. For if I speak, you prompt my tongue with love, And 'cause I tel 't you, you unkind reprove. Then blame not me for saying so, Since 'twas your beauty bid me woe. Equalitie To two fair Mistresses. Shal I freize between two fires? Or doth a numness ceaze on me? Each star inflames me with desires, Yet which to chuse I cannot see Since reason admires equally. Then give me both For faith and troth I should be loath Each should not pleased be. Or you who so perfect are, That nature hath her self outdone In making you bright lights so fair! Rule by your turns! that so each one May cool the heat oth' to'other Sun! And Love me both! For faith and troth I should be loath, Each should not pleased be. To a friend. Ode. Affect not aierie Popularitie! But what thou wouldst be thought, that strive to be! Praise is but Virtues shadow; who court her Doth more the handmaid then the Dame admire. Who only doth wel, wel spoke of to bee, Studies the praise and not the virtue, he. To blaze thy virtues ne'r bespeak thy friend! If good, they speak thee and themselves commend. Now men but judge by heare-say, thus, they'l know, And see thy worth, and judge it greater too. True worth is best displaid by modestie The greatest rivers slide most silentlie, Only the shallow brooks do prattle, they Make a great noise and go but little way. Fame that doth feed oth' vaine applause of men, Gapes to its Eccho to be heard agen: And like this, lives awhile by others breath; Which being stopt is husht to silent death. Good actions crown themselves with lasting baies, Who deserves wel, needs not anothers praise. Virtue's her own reward; though, Euge, none Wil cry, 'tis Guerdon yet to have wel done. A sudden Phansie at Midnight. How ist we are thus melancholie? what Are our rich ferkins out? or rather that Which did inspire them, the Immortal wine, That did create us, like it self, divine? Or are we Nectar-sated to the hight? Or do we droop under the aged night? If so: weel vote it ne'r to be eleven Rather then thus to part at six and seaven: Moult then thy speedy wings old Time! and be As slow-pac't as becomes thy age! that we May chirp awhile, and when we take our ease, Then flie and poast as nimbly as you please! Play the good fellow with us, and sit down A while, that we may drink the to'ther round! I'l promise here is none shal thee misuse, Or pluck thee by the foretop in abuse. Time saies he wil nor can he stay, 'cause he Thinks him too grave for your young companie. It makes no matter—Sirs How say you yet toth' tother Subsidie? Yes yes: And let our Ganymede nimbly flie And fil us of the same Poetick sherrie Ben-Iohnson us'd to quaffe to make him merrie. Such as would make the grey-beard botles talk Had they but tongues, or, had they legs, to walk: Such as would make Apollo smile, or wu'd Draw all the Sisters to our Brotherhood. And though the bald Fool staies not, let him know Weel sit and drink as fast as he shal go. So as the salt Anchovis swam in oyl, Wee'l make them swim again in sacks sweet spoil. On a Map of the World accidentally faln into the water and spoiled. The world drown'd once agen? sure holy text Saies it should be by fire dissolved next. Deucalion then weeps for this world, as much As once for th'old he did, it's sins are such: And as before he drown'd a world of men, In figure thus by chance it sinks agen. Who Plato's book of Commonwealth did view By mice devour'd and thought thence would ensue A fatal Period of the publick State; Would ha' presag'd the like unhappy fate (Had but he seen this) were attending us, And construed this dire chance as ominous I'l not obtrude for truths Prophetick dreams; Yet Mara's waters like Nil's seavnfold streams 'Tofore that gently did but wet this Land Now in a purple lake of bloud do stand And quite o'rwhelm't: and which is worse we fear No Olivebranch wil e'r agen appear. The Microcosme of individual man See how that wavers in an Ocean Of perillous inconstancie! whilst phlegme And crude raw humours quench the fires in him; That his split-sailes bear not the gentlest blast See how the Moral world in strife doth wast! And by like jarring doth decay! whilst we From il to worse stil slide, and in a sea Of Error drown at last! Since then we see Both these and the material world must be I'th end dissolv'd: I grieve the lesse for thee, That art all theirs but thin Epitomie. Upon the sight of an old but very deformed woman. I saw a woman: Bless me! did I say A woman or a Witch? or what you may Or can more horrid think, a Furie; she Was more deform'd then Deaths Anatomie Nor the black ink, nor this more ragged quil Can dawb her forth, she look't so monstrous il. A Camel-back with a crookt baker-knee, Bow'd like a token for the earth was she: Her eies two inches buried in her head Like leaden bullets seem'd, they lookt so dead: Her nose did like a Promontorie, threat With its appendant drop the chin to meet. Her eie brows hairie, and her rougher brow Furrow'd with wrinckles did like trenches show; Her parched hair did hang like wither'd hay, About her ears, it was so drie and grey: Her lean chops rough and hollow as the earth When chopt for rain in a drie summers dearth: The mark was out of her coney-mumping mouth, Where if a tongue yet was there ne'r a tooth; Which when she op't, 'twas but to fart a cough, Where who stood by would wish him farther off: Her lips like th'Monkies hairy hard and thin And in her bosome hung her forked chin. Thus monstrous uglie and deform'd was she; From such a wainscoat face, Deliver me! On the late Sect of the Adamites. A sect of Adamites of late's reviv'd, Who seem more innocent then e'r Adam liv'd. Such as will naked go, and think't a sin To wear a garment, they're so hot within VVith Lust, that they all cloathing do disdain; Aarons old Vestments they account prophane, Elisha's double mantle when they hear But nam'd, they sweat agen: they nought wil wear, Not holy lawn to keep them from the air, Nor St. Johns raiment, made of Camels heir: These Vestal garments though they holy be, Yet they do smel of strong hypocrisie, Dimas must leave his cloak, not any thing Must here be worn, no not a wedding ring, Nor fig-leaves, such as Adam wore long since, VVhen he had lost his Robe of Innocence. The whore of Babels smock they all detest, All Antichristian Reliques with the rest. All must be barely naked; 'cause they say Truth it self naked goes, and so should they. Naked as from their mothers wombs, they wear Nothing that covers onely skin and hair; Thus marching naked Sister, with a brother, For want of clothes they cover one another In some dark Grange thus meet they, where 'tis fit That they the deeds of darkness should commit: The candles are put out, because they say They are enlightned all, and so they pray; Here they begin; and thus divide the text, Handling in order whosoe'r comes next. They feel a womans faith, tel by th'spirit (VVhich doth possess them) which shal heav'n inherit. Each Saint his fellow-feeler chuseth there, As at the spring each bird doth choose his Peer. And when they all grow proud with hot desires, Thus they correct and quench the rising fires. To a Ladie on the Death of her little Dog. Madam, that any dog should die, I not at all do wonder, I; Nor can I yours bemoane indeed, Since like it self a dog it died. Yet 'twas a pretty dog, I vow, Descended wel, welfavoured too; Kept clean, and cleanly with the maid Ayr'd it self every day, 'tis said: Then it would smiling fawn, and at Your trencher with much dutie waite; Bark when it wanted chicken, and Would take no meat but from your hand; And like your shadow follow you Close wheresoever you would go: Then to your bed 'twould duly come And lick you where you pleas'd, whose room Many good Christians would have tane With willing hearts, and there have lane. Lastly (which must not be forgot) 'Twas good condition'd; was it not? A Dog of wax assoon it was; It did not Tobits dog surpass, In mood and form that wag'd his taile As 'twould ha' said to his master, haile! When bold Ulisses after ten Whole years to Ithaca agen Return'd his dog yet him did know And welcom'd home; your dog had no Such memorie I think; nor would Ha' shown such daintie tricks as could The Tinkers cur of Wapping, that Did pray and dance on two, and what More wondrous is, with taile in's mouth Trip the Canaries round forsooth. Your dog I grant was better bred, Brought up at hand; and better fed Then taught, for this same stately wretch Scorn'd ought to carry or to fetch. What worth was in it then, that you So much should prize and love it too? For I'l be bold the last great fal Of men where Death had conquer'd all The field almost, and you did loose On each side friends, that none of those Nor, all so much afflicted you As your dogs fatal end doth now. Oh! it did love you: wel it might, So 'twould whoe'r made much of it. But let me tel you by the way (Not to offend you) I heard say, Your dog so fed with sweetmeats was, Cakebread, and Almondbutter, as It's breath did shrewdly stink: but let That pass; t'had a worse qualitie yet, T'would stil be barking with it self, That I have joy'd to see the Elf How finely it would turn, when down It rowld it self upon the ground: For then t'would quiet lie awhile. But since 'tis now more quiet; I'l Not pitty it, but you, to grieve 'Cause your dog could not ever live. Dogs have their daies, 'tis true: and though A dog-star shins above, below They die. Yet since you lov'd its sight VVee'l pourtrayt e'r you bury it: And for his Epitaph shal be This underwrit in memorie; His Mistresse chiefest joy and griefe, Lov'd too almost as her own life; Here lies the best of Dogs, and lest, That Album Græcum made the best To cure sore throats with; for 'tis said The Isle of Dogs such never had. But dead doth now so worthless prove His skin wil hardly make one glove For a childs itchy hand: yet hee Lives famous in Effigie. In Crumenâ Vacuum an non? Nature as saies Philosophie Admits no vacuum; yet I (O the sad fate of Codrus curse!) Find there's a Vacuum in my purse. Or Nature errs sure, or the gold VVhich my now empty purse did hold. VVhen the last mite's exhausted, wou'll You then perswade me yet 'tis ful? VVhen Taverns and the Mercers book Have pickt my pocket, shall I look Then for gold there? I can't I tro Both eat my cake and have it too? Yet to make good this Axiome, Here's one in charitie throwes some Small crums of comfort in: he tels Mee its ful of air, but nothing els: Alas! I'm no Chamœlion, Nor can I live by air alone. If all thy gold dissolved be To liquid and Petabile; Wil not your strings stretch for one pint Of Sack? all gone? is nothing in't? Oh thou my dear and quondam friend That in my need didst money lend, How do I grieve thy skeliton Reduc'd thus soon to skin and bone! Sure some wil think that see thy thin And aierie Corps, that thou hast bin Some Poets purse, thus made refine By th'Alchimie of wit and wine: And that thy Angel gold may bee Still there, though it we cannot see, It is so sublimated, and So pure; for since we understand The Angels to be Spirits, then Thou'rt become spiritual agen. Well then Philosophie in truth, I find thou speakst the naked truth; For though for coine it empty be Yet there is no vacuitie. Though no bright Angel do appear In this dispised Hemisphear; Yet the Div'ls in't without all doubt There's ne'r a crosse to keep him out. De sunt nonnulla. To a Friend wishing peace. Let's all be friends! a happy peace Would make us prize that 'bove our ease: Then we wou'd home, and marrie too, To keep that corner of the house Yet left unsackt by civil foe, And drink a round in dear carouse. Oh what a happy thing it were, To live secure, and free from fear Of plunder! when the dul hind may With pig in hand his yearly rent To his old Landlord justly pay In stead of King or Parliament! No hurrie then of dread Alar'ms; From sleep should fright us into Arms: Gaols shou'd stand emptie then, and wee Enlarged as the winds may breath Each where, and as in Jubilee Live free from fear of sudden death. The Trumpet then shal onely blaze In Christmas or at Puppet plaies; Or serve the Clowns to summon o're To wait o'th' Judge, at grand Assize; And the drum onely beat before A muzled Bear, or harmless prize. Then shal we see no arms, but such As in the great Hall hang o'th' crutch All rust with cobwebs, which to clear The Grooms and Coachmen, (as you know It was the custome) once a year Must at the Country training show. In the Kings highway then wee'l ride, (Not skulking lest we should be spi'd In private lanes or by-waies cut By hardy Pioneer) a gentle pace, In stead of marching to a hut Or hedge, unto some warmer place. O'th' week-daies then wee'l bowle and chat Of our dear loves, and you know what, But not one syllable of State, Amidst our pleasant mirth; and then (If that Religion bear date) Wee'l pray on Sundaies once agen. If Oliv'd peace should once more smile And say, be happy! to this Isle, (Dear friend!) as who knows but she may?) I dare presume that you and I Shal kiss her feet, and wish her stay; And he that doth not, may he die! Song in a siege. Fil, fill the goblet full with sack! I mean our tall black-jerkin Jack, Whose hide is proofe 'gainst rabble-Rout, And will keep all ill weathers out. What though our plate be coin'd and spent? Our faces next we'l send to th'mint: And 'fore wee'l basely yield the town, Sack it our selves and drink it down. Accurst be he doth talk or think Of treating, or denies to drink, Such drie hopsucking narrow souls Taste not the freedome of our bowles. They onely are besieg'd, whilst we By drinking purchase libertie. Wine doth enlarge, and ease our minds, Who freely drinks no thraldome finds. Let's drink then as we us'd to fight, As long as we can stand, in spight Of Foe or Fortune! who can tel? Shee with our cups again may swell; Hee neither dares to die or fight, Whom harmless fears from healths affright: Then let us drink our sorrows down, And our selves up to keep the town. On the Creeple souldiers marching in Oxford in the Lord Thr. Cottington's Companie. Stay Gentlemen! and you shal see a very rare sight; Souldiers who though they want arms, yet wil fight: Nay some of them have never a leg but onely Will: Their Governour, and yet they'l stand to it stil. The birds call'd Apodes they resemble, and seem To be without either wing or leg, like them. Oh the courage of a drunken and valiant man! For each wil be going when he cannot stand! Then room for Criples! here comes a companie, Such as before I think you ne'r did see: Here's one like a Pidgion goes pinion'd in spight Of old Priapus, the birds to affright: Another limps as if he had got the Pharse, With his half leg like a Goose close up to his arse. Yet mistake me not! this is no Puppet play; You shal onely see the several motions to day. Ran: tan: tan: with a spanish march and gate Thus they follow their Leader according to his wonted state. A Snaile or a Crablouse would march in a day. If driven as led with the white staffe as far as they, What I should cal them I hardly do know, Foot they are not as appears by the show: By the wearing of their Musquets to which they are ty'd, They should be Dragooners had they horses to ride. And yet now I think on't, they cannot be suc; Because each man hath his rest for his crutch, To these their Officer need not to say at alar'ms, Stand to your Colours, or handle your arms: Yet that they are Souldiours, you safely may say, For they'l die before they wil run away: Nay, they are stout as ever were Vantrumps, For like Widdrington they'l fight upon their very stumps. They have keen Estridge stomacks, and wel disgest Both Iron and Lead, as a Dog wil a breast Of Mutton. But now to their Pedigree; That they are sons of Mars, most writers agree; Some conceive from the Badger old Vulcan they came, Because like him they are Mettle-men and lame, The moderns think they came from the Guyes of Warwick; and Some think they are of the old Herculean band: For as by his foot he was discover'd, so By their feet you their valour may know. And though many wear wooden legs and crutches, Yet, by Hercules, I can assure you, such is Their steeled resolution, that here You'l find none that wil the woodden dagger wear. They're true and trustie Trojans all believe me, And stride their wooden Palfreis well: t'would grieve me To see them tire before they get Unto the Holy-bush; but yet If they should faint, at that end of the town, They may set up their horses and lie down. Most of these fighters, I would have you to know, Were our brave Edgehil Mermidons awhile agoe. Who were their limbs like their looser rags Ready to leave them at the next hedge, with brags, That through the merit of their former harms, They die like Gentlemen though they bear no arms. Now some wil suspect that my Muse may be, 'Cause she is so lame, of this Companie: And the rather, because one verse sometimes, Is much shorter then his fellows to hold up the rithmes; I confess before Criples to halt is not good: Yet for excuse shee pleads, she understood That things by their similies are best displaid, And for that cause her feet are now Iambick made. Refrigerium. Now through each vein my blood doth run Hot as the Summers scorching Sun, Whilst on what side so e'r I turn, With double frying flames I burn. To cool both Ætna's first I'l have An Arbour coole as is the grave, And with green shadie branches wove As covert as Dodona's grove. So that the Sun may not appear At all in this close Hemisphere. With Curran-bushes I'l hav't made Vail'd o'r with Sycamores coole shade, And mixt with Rasps and Cherrytrees, Whose choice fruit may my pallat please. I'th' midst of which next shal be spread Upon a large and spacious stead, A frost-upon-green tabbie Quilt Water'd, as if't had there bin spilt, Strew'd o'r with Roses where I may Naked my lazie limbs display; And underneath't a Christal stream Of fresh Rose-water still'd from them Through th'limbeck of my body, that My smelling Sense may recreate. A marble Fountain next I'l have Close by in a large hollow cave Springing with Nilus seav'nfold streams, Til they all meet in one fair Thames: Washing in whose pure waters we Diana and her Nymphs may see: With other lively Pictures, that My Seeing sense may recreate. Next I wil have Arion play Upon a Dolphins back, whose lay Shal teach each bird to chirp and trie How to excel his harmonie. Orpheus his harp, Apollo's lyre Shal with the Syrens fill the Quire. With other sorts of Musick, that My hearing Sense may recreate. A Mirmaid next I'l have in stead O th'Barber for to kemb my head: All the four Winds too shal conspire With gentle breize to coole my fire Till I being fann'd with Ladies love, Then their cold Sex shall colder prove. Last, because nought cools better then A Maid who warms and cooles agen. I'l have a young plump amorous Queen, Ripe though she be not yet fifteen. 'Twixt whose close arms and snowie breast I may diffuse my heat, and rest: Then bath my self in kisses, that My Feeling Sense may recreate. Thus when at once I all my Senses please, Me thinks I feel my self in Paradise.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ELEGIES. On the Death of the young and pious Ladie M?? C. P. So yong and ripe in judgement? fit for heaven A Saint shee was on earth, before eleven. What Virtue was there lodg'd in this smal world, Whose soul grew faster then the body could? Sins shee had none, but what curst Nature gave, Yet e'r she knew't, shee long'd this world to leave, Where but new enter'd, she with pious rage Her Prologue spoke, doth bravely quit the stage. Oh happy growth, that in so short a time, This early blossome thus to heav'n could climb! Epicedium On the beautiful Lady M?? A. K. unfortunately drowned by chance in the Thames in passing the Bridge. Drown'd? and i'th' Thames? oh how I grieve to see Such fair streams act so foul a Tragedie! Not all thy main which twice a day doth flow, Can wash this guilt from off thy conscious brow. Like the dead sea thou look'st; whilst every wave Thou wear'st, now seems to be another grave. Forgetful Leche, or the Stygian Lake, As thou foul Tyber, looks not halfe so black. How horrid thou appear'st! and thou dost tast Sowre, and not half so pleasant as thou wast; Rome now wil fear to drink thee, since thou'rt dyde With such chast guiltlesse blood, and none wil ride More on thy ruder waves, thy crueltie Since 't would not spare so fair a Saint as shee. How I could flow with anger! chide thee too, But thou art innocent, as pure, I know: 'Las 'twas her Fate, unhappy Destinie! Thus to thy streams, to adde more puritie. Thou'rt become white agen; an Element Fit to receive a soul so innocent; Whose body buried in thy Christal tomb Transparent lies, scorning earths baser womb. Gilt Tagus banks, nor the Pectolian Can boast such Golden treasures as you can. Thou didst but lend her to the Earth awhile, Thou hast thy Pearl again, now Thamis smile. 'Tis fit such gems should by the makers hands Shine thus transplanted to their native sands. On the Death of the excellent fair Lady, the Lady A.R. How blindly erring were those Painters, that Did without eies grim Death delineate? Did he not ayming shoot, and shooting hit 'Midst the Arcadian Nymphs this fairest white, This whitest Venus Dove? without his light How had he found this mark, or shot so right? Thus as he aiming stood, and in his heart Relenting doubted, whether his fel dart He should or spare or send, so long he gaz'd Upon her Beauties splendour all amaz'd, That the bright raies she darted, did so shine And dazle the beholding Archers eyne, That whilst he trembling shot and made her light Extinct, the beams of that put out his sight. And so e'r since Death hath been blind indeed; On her fair Tomb this Epitaph shal be read: Beautie here on Death reveng'd, Triumphant lies, Whose Glories won all hearts, put out all eies. On the losse of M? N.W. his three finggers cut off at the battel of Edgehil, he being both a Poet and a Musitian. By some it hath been said, That the best Musick is by discord made; But here, (I grieve to see) By discords we have lost our harmonie. How cruel was that hand Depriv'd thee of thy cunning fingers? and At one unhappy blow Cut off an Orpheus, and a Poet too? How sadly the strings rest E'r since those fingers which before exprest On them such lively art, Were thus dissected from their constant part? Yet though these joynts be gone To quiet ease, two fingers stil are on, Which with dexteritie Can write the Epitaph o'th' t'other three. And though you cannot play; Yet stil both sing, and versifie you may. Nænia Upon the death of my dear friend T.S. Esquire, slain at the first fight at Newbery, 1645. Pale Ghost! I weep, not 'cause thy precious blood Honour'd when spilt, a cause so just, so good; Nor grieve I 'cause so much that suffer'd too, I'th' losse of such a Champion as you: This makes my heart afresh with thy wounds bleed, A Loyal Subject, and my friend, is dead. One, whose unborrow'd native Wit proclaim'd Him sole Apollo's heire; whose Vertues fam'd Him with Pandora's gifts endow'd; whose parts Did stile him Master of all noble Arts. One whose Youths sprightful valour did encline To acts Heroick without help of wine, One who prefer'd the cause he had in hand Above his life, before his fathers land: One that was forward, yet not desp'rate bold, A coward in ill acts, yet durst behold Death in his uglyest vizar. This was Hee Who lov'd his friend, and feard no Enemie. Who nobly thus did seek an early grave, Because he scorn'd to live a subjects slave. Wide was the Orifice sure of thy large wound, Els had thy great and gallant soul ne'r found So easie passage thence to sallie out, And leave her so lov'd seat to range about Th'Elesian groves. My souls best part adieu, I'l bathe thy wound in tears, though wounded too. Drie eies forbear this urn! oh come not neer To read this Epitaph without a tear. Spirit of Wit and Valour here doth lie Doubly entomb'd i'th' Readers heart and eie. Upon the lingring death of the Virtuous M?? L.H. Death! I not blame thy subtiltie In cutting off this Happy Shee: Ne'r didst thou yet in thy black list enroul So fair a soul. Thy Envie snatcht her hence, lest wee By her example taught, should be Immortaliz'd by virtue, and live stil Against thy wil. For hadst thou spar'd her yet awhile, And not prevented by this wile Our grand design, thou'adst lost thy sting, and wee Not feared thee. Coward thou didst by slow degrees Upon her Vital spirits ceaze, Els had shee summon'd pow'r, enough to stand Thy armed hand. Subtile and envious Coward, thus Thou 'ast spoiled Nature, robbed us: Yet I not blame thee, thou'adst no other way, To get thy prey. Upon the Death of the truly valiant Sir Bevil Grenvil slain. See where in Western clouds our Sun is set! Whilst those thick groves of Pikes of him beset To guard his Valour, trembled all and shoke With Aspen fear, soon as this stately Oke Was cleft with fatal thunder! every head Droops like pearl'd Violets now Grenvil's dead. Wee need no Gods of Egypt to exhale Salt rivers from our eies, and force us waile His sorrowed absence; no sowre peele, or Rue To damp our looks to Pharisaick hue. From Grenvil's Herse each cheek is watered, And scorns to wear a smile now he is dead. Did I not view Heav'ns great unarmed bow, I might suspect Deucælion would o'r-flow The drenched world again, and in his name Erect a new eternal Ark of Fame. What sudden inundation else could thus As in a second deluge bury us Alive? and waft us by a quick return To shades? what fire but that of his bright urne Could melt each Muse to liquified verse, And thus dissolve in Elegiack tears? What Ocean but his Virtues could have drunk So many flouds from weeping eies, or sunk, So many drowning hearts? at whose sad fall A deep groan'd Diapason drowneth all, And blends at once our Harmonie— Oh I could curse that Planet that did reign At thy first birth, and e'r since smiling shine Til this unluckie hour it frown'd on thee, Prompting our Stars to bode us miserie. For if our hopeful cause should gasping lie, I'de swear it languisht, since she saw thee die. Upon the unfortunate death of the truly gallant and noble Gent. Ed. Sackvil, Esquire. Thy pow'r pale envious death I now defie, Thy rage is spent in this one Tragedie. Thou'ast purloin'd our chief wealth, and in one hour Rob'd Honours Garland of its choisest flow'r. Now do thy worst! thy life-depriving dart, Can no more Conquest bring, nor deeper smart. Oft his tri'd. Valour in the open field Dar'd thee, where since thou couldst not make him yield, Now by a weak and clandestine surprize Thou smit'st him unawares by cowardize. Yet went he arm'd against that fatal blow, Which sin did print upon his flesh, not you. Then be not proud of this thy spoil, since he Did wish to, more then you could make him, die. For now he lives fam'd to posteritie, Both for his Virtues and his Loyaltie. The gallant spirit of whose youthful heat Doth with his urnes clear oyle perpetuate. VVe weep not then, because he dy'd; but thus; The strange chance, doth strange wonder claim in us. Hee that but newly chang'd his mortal life In sacred wedlock, with a happy VVife, Is forc'd by th'ignorant malice of worse men To change it for a happ'er once agen: Hee whose rich Virtues gain'd each man his friend That knew them both, to his untimely end Thus brought by foes (if any he could have) Hath with his precious corps enricht the grave. Hee, Hee, is gone; and nought but sorrow left To mind us of the good we are bereft. For 'tis not onely Hee; we all are dead As when the Sun sets flow'rs seem withered: Nor doth his Fam'ly onely lose a stem, The Kingdome suffers in the losse of him. More I should say; but sullen griefe denies, I'l sigh, and vent the rest with weeping eies. Elegie Upon the death of that thrice valiant Lord, the Lord Bernard Stewart, slain in the fight neer VVest-Chester. Boast not proud death of this thy Victorie! In killing him who thus resolv'd to die! Hadst thou a life to lose, I would on thee Revenge his too too early Destinie. But Coward! thou nor spirit hast nor heat; Els thou wouldst neer ha' smit so brave, so great A Person, that on thy dread Tragick stage Fought on thy side, and in that bloodie rage To thy black shades so many breathlesse sent. Perhaps thou feardst his highborn furie meant With fierce assault thy conqu'ring selfe disarm, Sans fear of death he fought so; at which alar'm, Lest he thy territories should invade, And so usurp thy pow'r, thou wast afraid, So 'caus thy jealous fear would admit none, A Rival in thy Empire, thou so soon Didst cut him off. Happy unhappy he Right noble born, and dying; here doth lie, Whose single Death-despising Valour made His greatest enemie, Death it selfe afraid. On the Death of that most famous Musician M? VV. Lawes, slain in this unhappy Civil Warr. Such is the strange Antipathie between The Wolfe and sheep; that a Drum with Wolves skin Headed and beat, the partchment bottome breaks, And soundless to the stick no answer makes: So the Wolfe's by, the Sic Alciatus putavit in illo eleganti Emblemate. Cœtera mutescent coriumq; silebit ovillum Si confecta lup? tympana pelle sonent, &amp;c. Tanta quippe est antipathia, ut ne morte quidem finiatur; sed vel tum quoq; Lupus Ovi formidolosus existat. Lambstrings break; so Ideoq; Lupinas fides si jungas agninis, illas dissilere scribit Martinus del Rio. lib. 1. Disqui Magic. c.4. dumb Is th'other, when you sound a Wolves-skin'd Drum. By Wolves our Orpheus thus oppos'd was slain; His Lyres offended strings thus crackt in twain, At their harsh foes approach, and rang his knell. Such untun'd souls, who discord lov'd too well, Knew not the Heav'n of Musicks harmonie (And who not love't dull or il-natur'd be.) But more enraged grew. Else like those Wild beasts Amphion tam'd, they wou'd ha' rose Inspir'd with love, and kist those hands, whose aires Ravisht the birds, and taught the heav'nly Spheres To move in pleasing consort. But e'r sin' Our Lawes expir'd, this Common-wealth hath bin Quite out of tune. Could his surviving laies Yet 'swage our Genius (as Pythagoras VVith his soft accents, and sweet streins subdu'd And well appeas'd a mad-brain'd multitude) I'de swear they were Divine, whose pow'rful breath Could Eccho his rare concords after death, And in Loves Symphonie unite each part. This had been done by Lawes hid hand and Art, (Had he but liv'd;) e'r now. Melpomene, Mourn then! for earth hath lost her harmonie.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">EPIGRAMS. The first Book. Quam nihil, hoc aliud, vel malé, præstat agam. To the Reader of my Epigrams and Satyrs. Reader! that we may stil be friends be wise! And read no more of me, I thee advise! Somewhere thou'lt find thy selfe abus'd, and hate My naked truths, and so repent too late: Some sawcie line, if they, not give offence, The duller yet, wil vex thy patience. Why wrot I then, me thinks I hear it sed, If I not meant the Satyrs should be read? Read on then at your peril! but see you Read as I writ, having nought els to do. To a lacivious Blackamoore Woman. 'Tis Night in thine, in my face day: but yet Should wee joyn; wee might mongrel twilight get; A Tawny-moore that would of both partake: Haunt me not Shade! I'l no new monster make. To Cosmus. Wouldst know who 'tis that makes his knife his plough? Reaps with encrease, and yet doth never sow? That hath no Granarie to inn an eare, And yet 'tis harvest with him all the year? That without fear of Statute, doth ingrosse All th'corn hee can, and lives by others losse? Nor buyes nor sels, nor eats it? then know (Sir?) 'Tis Gemurcide, your humble Corn-cutter. On Lieutenant Catch. Catch brags much of his learning; and how wel In letters verst, he many doth excel: Thou wert indeed a cunning letter'd knave, Thy learning from the gallowes thee did save: No Samian e'r so letter'd was, as you, Twice thou wast burnt i'th' hand, and once i'th' brow. To one that after ten years studie, brought forth a lamentable work. Ten years you say 'tis, since you 'gan to write: So long in bringing forth so little wit? So after ten years siege the Græcians won But a dry ravisht Helen, and burnt town: So Elephants bring forth, having ten years gone, A fœtuous monster, such as you have done. On rich Lock. Rich Lock's maids stay not long with him, yet they Laden all, though not Maiden, go away: Some to his tenants eldest sons are wed, Some to his menial servants married; With th'first he gives some monie, and to these A Rent-free farme or Copyhold he gi'es. Well their short service thou rewardest Lock: Young Tenants cann't begin without a stock. Sure a more gracious Landlord ne'r was known Lock's now more like a father to his town. To the Printer. I prithee spoil-sheet! through resolv'd mistake Don't in my book more new Errata's make! And force, ith' latter sheet thy Reader so With thy faults and smal sense more pennance do! Hee'l not forgive thee, since he knows ful wel You made them now, that it might better sel. On Galla her going to a Nunnerie. E'r her Probation year was finished, She not approv'd that life; Improve she did: The first year Galla only said she meant To prove: She prov'd indeed, with child, and went. On Marcus. Homers Stentorian that had the voice Of fifty men, made not so great a noise As Marcus, when he pleads; no Judge can sleep Or Officer, he doth such bawling keep. Who but loud Marcus the Court practice hath? His clients cause he carries with a breath. To Sullen. Sullen, when it is vext' wil angry sit, 'Twil neither eat nor drink, but pout and fret: Fast! you do wel, in Gallen I have read Such scurvie humours should be sterv'd, not fed. On Cleombrotus. Soon as Cleombrotus th'Ambraciot read Grave Plato's Phædo that discours'd how dead This life is; after which the soul should be Cloath'd with a robe of Immortalitie. Mistaking him; himself did fondly drown, And cryd thus chang'd my crook is for a Crown. Alas! poor blind deceived Mortal? he Made too much hast to Immortalitie: Who'd take by force what may be giv'n him? since Heav'n ne'r was purchas'd by such violence? To a Travellour. You talk of Silarus that turns wood to stone; Of a Fount flows with wax, and then of one That streams with pitch; and of the Andrian spring That store of wine and oyl doth daily bring; All this I'l first beleive, then travaile I, To see how wide you and your fountains lie. On the Ladie Seem-pol. Drest like her self, her feat discourse is drawn Latinify'd in fine spun Cobweb lawn; Each flatuous word swels with verbositie, And speaks how skild she is in Sophistrie: How wise your babes would be, if they, so young, Should learne from you to speak their mother tongue? Nay she learn'd Aristotle; dares confute Or, with Bengeli, of the Stars dispute? Far above humane, much more, womans reach Or laugh at him that did oth' Sunday preach: Thus at her tongue most rarely good is she: She's at her tail as good, or fame doth lie. On Sir Gervas Loftie. What what a Spanish gate this portly tal And glorious Ship doth through the Ocean sail Of its vast boundless pride? at which the smal And weaker pinnace must or break or vail? He wil know no man; this the cause may be, He hardly knows himself, for every day He or his garment's not the same, whilst he Turns shapes like Proteus, looking big and gay. Poor ship although your sails so wide you bear, I know ther's twenty have in thee a share. To the Reader. Dost wonder Reader why my Satyr-Muse Hath got no lines ith' front as others use To set her forth, and so conceive her poore 'Cause friendless as not worth the reading o'r? Why I bespoke not other men to write Encomium's there, whose empty praises might Make the enlarged Preface swel and look Like Mindus porch, as big as all the book? She scornd to beg applause, or trouble friends, Except those she gets: Good wine it self commends. Why shud a stranger at her feast say grace? She bids you welcome, fall to, if you please! Epitaph on a Poor Alchymist. The ashes of a Golden Ass, Not worth a monument of brass, Or Chymist subtle as his gold Reader this earthen urn doth hold; Who, his gold vanisht all to air And dear-bought cinders, through despair And Deaths more certain Chimestrie, The Quintessence of Fool did die, Thus sublimated and calcin'd To nothing, but poor dust refin'd. Why men are so unlike. Why one man is not like another', this; No one is like himself, and so it is. To Madam Moyle on her Picture. Madam! their judgments I commend who said, Your Pictur's like your self, for it is made Of fading colours which wil wear away, To be gaz'd on a while, and then decay; An empty shadow with a rouling sight, Looks wantonly on all that look on it; A wel drest statue, yes; and painted too; 'Tis very like you, Madam! so are you. Epitaph on a very fat man. Under this pebble stone, Here fast sleepeth one, And that is not two; Yet was without doubt Far bigger about, Then both I, and you. His kidneys encreast So much, that his wast Was hooped all round: So his girdle Death cuts, And down fel his guts, 'Bouts heels to the ground. To Clois. I know you rich; you are an heir, You'r courteous, liberal, and fair, You'r wise too, as most women are, Jolly, and friendly, debonair: I like this freedom; but they say You are to free another way. Clois farewel! your gold s too light; And so I may too dearly buy't. On the English Mounsieur. An English Mounsieur lately came from France, Where he had learnt to make a leg, to dance, To kiss his little finger, ride the Barbe, And wear his cloaths in the authentick garbe. Seeing him thus ith' mode, I did demand In French, how long 'twas since he came to land? He answer'd not, but said he had been long In France, but never car'd to learne the tongue. How many are there whom we thus mistake, That travel only thus for fashion sake? On Philautus. Philautus thinks each woman that doth view His proper person, streight must love him too: Alas Town cladder thou'rt mistane I see, Thou lov'st thy self, and them, they laugh at thee. On Nab and Plodwel. Nab gone to Sea two years or more, and dead Reported since, his wife did Plodwel wed: Return'd Nab found his wife with child, and though Her he must keep, the child he would not too. Plodwel ejected of's new home and wife, Laid the case thus: Tenant for years or life When that his time expires, what e'r he leaves Unto the Freehold fastned, the Law gives All to the Landlord; and who ploughs, and sowes Anothers ground, at his own peril do's The same, and looses all the crop: since I Have trespass'd, reap the same! he made reply, The barn and ground's your own; good land should not Lie fallow. Nab thus gain'd what Plodwel got. To Lupa. Thy daughter-Whore, begets a Bawd her mother, As Ice and water each engender other: Though thy age freize with her salt mixt like snow Before her lustfull fires, it thaweth too By the same heat inflam'd: when she grows ice So you can warme her bloud with Bawdes advice. On Priske and Galla. Some think Prisk's great with Galla; but say I, She is grown great with him, or fame doth lie. To a fat Usurer. Fat folks we say by nature are most free: You and your purse are fat, and yet I see Your hand and that stil shut, the reasons this; In costive flesh thy lean soul buried is. On Wylde. His father sick and dying, Wylde mourn'd sore, But 'twas because he died not before: At's burial he in mourning weeds was clad, This was cause th'Mother was not also dead: She dead, sad soul! he cloath'd himself in Sack (Cloath I not mean) for th'belly, not the back. Oh Viperous age! when children shal so soon Through envy wish their parents dead and gone! On Smart. A puritan once; Smart, since conform'd did bow, Wore a Canonick cassock to his shooe: Turn'd with the tide he rails 'gainst Bishops now; This for a quiet living Smart can do: Instead of Cassock now a cloack he wears, A broad hat with short hair and longer ears. As th'Sun moves he sets his Horoscope: Smart's both a turn coat now, and Heliotrope. On Brisk. Brisk brag'd of's ready wit; I tempting him But for one distick, did propound this theam, Nothing: It cannot be, he wondring said That out of Nothing ought shu'd e'r be made. Dul Brisk thou ne'r couldst tune Apollo's lyre: A puresteeld wit, wil strike Mercurial fire Out of the flintiest subject: but thy head Is all compos'd of softer mettle, lead. On Mopsa a Chambermaide. Mopsa advanc'd from th'dairie to her Dame, With her black bag conceal'd from whence she came: Mopsa o'r her bodie had a tan'd goose skin, Yet her cloaths hid it, so that was not seen; Mopsa her face was chinkt and uglie too, Yet that she salv'd with Arts adulterate hue: Mopsa's pretended simpring modestie Hid her foul thoughts: Stil good she seem'd to be: Mopsa's wemb swell'd, that fault was also hid By th'Chaplains cassock whom she married: But Mopsa's child did like her Master grow: Alas! poor Mopsa was discover'd now. To fat Apicius. Apicius leave! scratch thy bald pate no more Hark how thy Muse supine doth sleeping snore In thy diseas'd and bedred soul! She lies Slumbring resolv'd neither to wake or rise. Not all thy sprightly Sack or far fetcht chear Can help as midwives to deliver her. The fumes from thy ful paunch ascending fil Thy head with vapours, whose dul mists do kil And suffocate thy vitals, hurt thy brain, Where all thy genitive faculties are lane. The Muses live in hungry air, feed clean, So must you; els your wit wil ne'r be keen. As 'tis in Nature so in Poesie, Seldom or nev'r fat bodies pregnant be. On a deaf man and his blind wife. The husband's deaf, the wife cann't see a wink She's ears to him' and now he's eies to her: Which hath the happier time on't do you think? He; since her parlous tongue he cannot hear, Her noise 'tis thought deaft him; howe'r it be, Happy is that loss that made them thus agree. On Lena. Lena a virgin was so pure, So holy, sober, chast, demure, So all o'r mild, as in good sooth Butter would hardly melt in mouth. But Lena married grew a scold Outragious, impudent, and bold; And when her lustful fires went out, A Bawd, she threw the sparks about. Her early goodness did presage She would degenerate with age. The double blossom'd Apple-tree Never bears any fruit we see: And a forward promising Spring, Doth but a sterile Autumne bring. The Proverb thus she verifies, A young Saint an old Divel is. Why Justice is painted blind. Who painted Justice blind did not declare What Magistrates should be, but what they are; Not so much 'cause they rich and poor shud weigh In their just scales alike; but because they Now blind with bribes are grown so weak of sight. They'l sooner feel a cause then see it right. Of Love Sonnets. Why love so often theams each writers pen Is this: 'tis spreading Love o'rcomes all men: Which sicknes though most would hide fr? their friends, Like Agues, yet 'twil work at th'fingers ends. To Sir Gregorie Nonsense. When you to little purpose much do talk Repeating stil the same thing, and I baulk Your weaker argument to avoid delay; Angry you'd have me hear you out, you say, I'have heard thee out too long, where you ha' bin Wide from the purpose, now lets hear thee in. To spend-fast a Gamster. The famous Lers of Belestat that flows And for four months doth ebb each hower, shows What tides thy wavering fortune bears, whilst you By play wax rich, and wain as often too. But Spend-fast this hath a full Sea to feed It's thirstie current when it stands in need: You han't an Ocean of wealth I think, When all your bags grow drie to make them drink. To the Ingenious Reader. Reader be wise! and don't abuse the Poet! Say not his wit is old, stole; or, I know it! If nought worth praise you here shal find or see, Be silent then; Hee'l do as much for thee. On Sullen. Sullen wil eat no meat but peevishly Replies I care not nor I will not, I: Troth I commend his abstinence, 'tis great, When having such a stomack hee'l not eat. To Pistor. When Pistors bread is found too light, 'tis sent To the poor Prisoners for his punishment: I not approve't, 'tis Charity mistane, Pistor you ar' stil an errant Knave in graine. On a fruitful Merchants wife. A merchant newly married went to Sea; Returning after three years voyage, he Found his wife busied midst her children two, And with a third as big as she could goe. She to prevent a storme said husband! you By Sea, and I by land have travail'd too. To a painted Whore. As rotten worms do breed in gilded books, So thrives thy carkas under painted looks: Who reads thy soul shal find that too within In every line and letter black with sin. To Brisk. Brisk when thour't drunk, then in thy own conceit, Thour't Valiant, Wise, Great, Honest, Rich, Discreet. Infus'd at once so many qualities? Oh Virtuous sack from whence all these arise! Troth! Brisk be alwaies drunk! for wel I know When you are sober you are nothing so. To Jeffry the Kings dwarfe. Smal Sir! me thinks in your lesse self I see Exprest the lesser worlds Epitomie. You may write man, ith' abstract so you are, Though printed in a smaller Character. The pocket volume hath as much within't As the broad Folio in a larger print, And is more useful too. Though low you seem Yet you'ar both great and high in mens esteem. Your soul's as large as others, so's your mind: To greatness Virtue's not like strength confin'd. To Overwise. Before a jeast is crackt he laughs and swears Good before—oh apprehensive ears! That do like lightning thus prevent the stroke And conceive thunder e'r the cloud is broke. On Mounsieur Finedress. Sr. do but marke yon crisped Sir you meet! How like a Pageant he doth stalk the street? See how his perfum'd head is powderd o'r! Twu'd stink else, for it wanted salt before. On Philautus. Philautus with himself is much in love, Doth his own actions ever best approve; Nay his own picture he doth look upon, ('Cause 'tis like him,) with admiration: How wel may he be said and truly too To court a shadow? he himself is so. To Gripe. Gripe to me all when he is dead wil give, Wil part with nothing whilst he is alive: What thanks is that to gape for dead mens shoos? To give them only when you cannot chuse? Give now; 'tis left then 'gainst your wil I know: It is twice giv'n, what living we bestow. He leavs a good name who givs whilst he livs, And only carries with him what he givs. On Lurch the match-contriver. Lurch th'old match-maker with his hunting nose All the young Heirs both Male and Female knows In town or Country, widows too, or men Once married, he can help to wed agen: Saves them the labour too of wooing, whilst He bids the bans, and sends them to the Priest For further copulation: thus doth Lurch Prey on each party that he brings to Church. But oh how oft this marriage-Pimp is curst! 'Fore I'd grow rich thus, I'd be hanged first. To the Reader. Reader! my Muse thinks not, as beggars do, Boldly with importunitie to wooe A farthing worth of praise, no: her desire Is only, passing, that you'd look on her. She proudly says on alms she scorns to live: And as good as you bring she back wil give. On Proud. Proud swels like Boreas, with face red as fire, And keeps a blustring stir in fuming ire, So Rubies; do resemble flames, and yet Are neither hot or capable of heat, Since ther's no fire can warm them: So art thou As cold with inward fear, as hot in show. 'Tis but false fire thy seeming Passion givs; Then thine, there's not a tamer spirit livs. To his dear friend H. N. With what strange Philtrum's thou didst charm the wine, Whose powr'ful influence made our souls combine And melt into our loving cups; or how First thou didst win me to thee, I not know; Wast 'cause thou'rt pleasant thinkst thou? with discreet And harmless mirth setting an edge to wit? Or 'cause thou'rt liberal, courteous, and free, The friend and Genius of the companie? Was't for thy person, wealth, or valour I So lov'd thee? or was't only sympathie? Was't this, or altogether made me doate Upon thee first? no sure, nor this nor that: I can no certain cause assign thee why, But this, I love thee without reason, I. To Gripe and Holdclose. Gripe sais Rags cloaths are lousie, but Holdclose Sais they'r so poor, they are not worth a louce: Though your phrase differ; thus agree you may, Give him fresh cloaths, heel shift his lice away. To Gallus. What's in three bellies in one day, wu'dst know? 'Tis the new egge thou eatst, each morning to Thy breakfast: first 'twas in the hens, and then In thine, at night 'tis in thy hen's agen. On Bib. Bibs in a seaver alwaies, hot and drie, Yet I ne'r saw him sick: the reason why? Lifes liquor sack he drinks, whose healthful sp'rit Expels both sickness, death, and fear of it. Oh never dying juyce of th'pow'rful vine! Thou makst men like thy Immortal self, divine. Of Loving Husbands. We observe each loving Husband when the wife Is labouring, by a strange reciproque strife Doth sympathizing sicken, and't may be: In Law their one, and in Divinity. On Luscus. Luscus is never wel, but changing stil, And though he loose by th'bargain change he wil: No marle he's grown so poor, how shud he els? Too dear he buys repentance when he fels. On Stut. The more Stut strives to speak, he stams the more; But his cold tongue wel oyld, and hot with store Of wine, he speaks not like an Oracle then, But much, and loud, and plain as other men: Such Eloquence hath pow'rful wine: but he Drinks oft til he can neither speak nor see. The Remedie here is worse then the disaese, Better then none, a tongue imperfect is. On the strange Death of Eschylus a Poet. Eschylus foretold by a diviner, he By th'downfal of a house should ruind be: Fondly that day to 'void this Destinie Did keep the field, not yet resolv'd to die: There, as he stood, a Faulcon in his beak Having a Tortoys which he meant to break, Suppos'd his bald pate, as he barehead stood, To be a stone, on which to get his food He let it fal: the Tortoys did remain By this chance safe, and Eschylus was slain. Oh the unalterd Persian Laws of fate! Whose fixt decrees none can anticipate! Bold Poets hence prove mortal, whilst that crown (Whose radiant temples, laurent with renown, And deckt with tresses like Apollo's brows) Is safe from Envies crack, or Deaths fel blows. On Cob. From th'College Cob sent to the Ins of Court Half codled, wu'd seem wise though he pay for't: A pretty study he hath fil'd with books; Yet he in that or them but seldom looks. Not to him but his heire Cob learning buys: These are Cobs new Fee simple purchases. On Cleopatra. Rich Cleopatra striving to outvie In luxuries excess Mark Anthonie, A Pearl in value worth three hundred crown Dissolv'd in vinegar first did swallow down At one proud draught; and but prevented wu'd At the next draught have swallowed one as good. Oh monstrous stomack that could in one houre Consume an Empire, and a State devoure? On an Inveighing Poetaster. See where a snarling Scribler doth inveigh In toothless jeasts against my Poesie! The toothach sure torments his head and wit; Which makes him show his teeth that cannot bite. Bees when they wound, disarm themselvs: this Ca[illeg.] So breaks his teeth when he doth biting snarle. The Dedication to Momus. I to Mæcenas dedicate my book, Hee'l read it with no supercilious look; To each Ingenious Reader I transmit The same, he best knows how to judge of it; To th'simple that he may admire't, I give, Whom 'cause he understands not, I forgive; To all my Poetizing friends I send it, But to you only (Momus) I commend it. On Dul. Dul readeth much, many a leaf turns o'r, Yet grows no wiser than he was before; Can tel you many Authors names by roat, Which upon all occasions he wil quoat: Forgets the text, which he ne'r understood, Thus he eats much, but cann't disgest his food. Be not too greedie Dul! first learn to spel! Who rides too fast, at first, he rides not wel. On Accismus. Foolish Accismus hath a qualitie To deny offer'd things in modestie: By chance one offer'd him an injurie, He took it: Bless me! what a fool was he? On Tucca. Tucca e'r while went to a Bawdy house, Where for his entrance he not paid a sous: Oh conscience Tucca! 'las! it is their trade; I care not he replies, I'm sure I'm paid. 'Tis just; who e'rs caught stealing in the act If he scape death, shu'd be burnt for the fact. To Rash. Rash swear not! think not 'cause you swear that I Believe you! no: he that wil swear will lie. To Crispinus. Crispinus 'cause you lately writ a play, And then didst put't in print the other day, You think your self to be a profest Poet, And where you come, believe, that all men know it: By which smal work you now are grown so proud, That now you dare amidst the Homers croud; And 'cause you'have sipt a little, think you'are free Oth' learned Arts, and of their companie: Intrude not yet Crispinus! thou'rt not fit For th'Muses quire, thine is but suburb wit. On Howdee. When at the Court a fashions quite wore out, And come to Longlane walks the town about, Then doth my Ladies Howdee get intoi't, And thinks him gallant in this new old suite: No matter Howdee, thour't in fashion yet, For though a great way off, thou follow'st it. To Brave. VVher'er he comes, Brave like a Valiant Scot Freely discharges all, and paies the shot; Else none wu'd care for's idle companie; When th'reck'ning comes, then Brave, I'l send for thee. On Venterwit. He scrapes up verses, shows them up and down, And where they are likt, he saies they are his own: If none commend them, then he swears he found Them by chance, walking in the Temple round. He by chance met with some of mine, which he Had spoild with interlining ribauldrie: Who showing askt we how I like't the strein? I told him 'twas a poor and empty vein: He wondring at my censure, boldly said They were the best lines that he ever made. Yes: so they were I told him 'fore the text Was by his comment thus perplext. Fool thou'rt discover'd; therfore take advise! Spoil mine no more, or I'l proclaim thy lies! On Braggadochio Cit. Cit now he's rich doth boast his Pedigree How he's allied to this great familie And to'ther, whom as customers he knew; Thus both his kinred and acquaintance grew. Peace Cit! or I'l proclaim thy stock; I know That no more arms (poor thou) then legs can'st show. On Wylde. Wylde drinks to drown his sorrows, and't may be, The more he drinks, the more foregetful he. On Childish love. Children their mothers more than fathers love. The cause is plain: the fathers often prove Uncertain and unknown, and so it is: For who can love what he nor knows, nor sees? On M? Spendall. I asked Spendall why he spent so fast? Why he his coin did so profusely wast? Hee repli'd moneys were but crosses to him, And gold a gilded bait that would undo him: Why he sold all his land, I askt agen? Hang't 'twas but durt, why should he keep it then? To purchase Heav'n he wou'd sel that and moe, Where til he left his earth, he could not goe: Then, why he sold his bed? troth hee did tell Mee, whilst he kept his bed, he ne'r was well: At last, I askt him why his clothes he sold? All to his naked shirt? he was, he told Me now about to bid to every friend And th'world good-night, and so hee made his end. Troth Spendall, I do like each smart reply, But not thy witty foolish povertie. On Lawyer Say-much. Saymuch by chance in's feet had got the gout, Yet pleaded stil; there hee wou'd ne'r be out, But talkt apace, though his feet gouty bee, Yet hee may have a running tongue I see. To Medicus on Tucca. When Tucca's sick, then straight he sends for thee, Look to his water! hee'l give nothing, hee. To Vetus an old Antiquary. Vetus upon a Manuscript doth pore, Tiring himself in reading Hist'ry o'r; What Noah eat before the floud, or how Learning increas'd, is all his care to know: Out of Troys ashes here he rakes a Storie, Makes him admire its strength, &amp; Priams glorie: Tels you who Athens built, then talks of Rome, How many Consuls she hath had, and whom; The oldest books and writings him best please, As many love to feed on mouldie cheese: Thus he remembers things forgot, doth know All that is past, but knows not what is now. 'Troth now 'tis time to know thy selfe; go die! Converse with th'dead! here's none can make reply. On Fine. Fine carries 'bout him strong perfumes to please The Ladies sweeter comp'nie, nothing els? Yet: his breath stunck before of's old disease, Hoping to hide which, now as strong he smels. On the Drunkards lavishness. I'l tel you why the drunk so lavish are, They have too much, nay more then they can bear. On Poetizing Momus. Momus when any Poem he doth read, Though it deserve just praise, and doth exceed In wit and judgement; yet he sighs it o'r, Saying hee has read as good as it before: Wil ne'r commend it; and if any by Ask how he likes it? then he makes reply, 'Tis good, indifferent; there's something in't, Or it may pass, but 'tis scarce worth the print. Thus though his wisdome can no fault espie, Yet he denies it praise, in policie: 'Troth Momus if thou had'st, no better friend, None would thy verses read, much lesse commend. On Linus. Linus his Peruque's made of womens hair, Thus what was lost by women, they repair: But not long after Linus nose did drop; 'Las! that was such a breach they could not stop. On Gallus. Troubled in conscience Gallus weds his whore, Hopes shee'l as honest prove as she was poore; What skils saies hee? 'tis but as 'twas before, I kept her then, and now I do no more: For better and for worse our wives we take, A Whore purchance an honest wife may make. On Histrio. Though Histrio on the stage doth often die, Thus put in mind of his mortalitie, Yet reclames not, but lives licenciously, As if he were to act eternally. Believe me Histrio death at last wil come, Though for a while hee keeps the tyring room. To a Tobaccoseller. Men buy thy smoak, but leave it all behind, Thou sellest nought, grow'st rich, 'cause fools are kind. To the Reader. Reader! I am no Epigramatist, No carping Momus, or fel Satyrist: I touch no man, but in the generall, And modest look, like equal day, on all; I personate none; if you then guilty bee 'Tis your own fault t'apply it; I am free. To Bankes. When Spendall asks to borrow, you reply, You know not when hee'l pay you; troth nor I. To the Physicians. Of all the several Professions I best approve the wise Physicians, You can kill men, nor fear a Jury for't, And get experience by anothers hurt; You can take fees, whether you cure or no, And large ones too; few other trades do so: Your shop is alwaies ope in war or peace, All times alike conspire to your encrease: Then y'have the opportunity you know To feel a Ladies tender pulse, or so: Thus you both purge the purse and body too, Are counted wise, 'cause fools makes use of you. To Lupa. You are a medler Lupa, rotten too, That's 'cause you are an open-arse you know. Epitaph on Bibulus. Here, who but once in's life did thirst, doth lie, Perhaps the dust may make him once more drie. On Histrio. Histrio would needs go write a play of's own, But could write nought but what's already known, For hee like th'leaden cisterne held no more Water, then what the Poet dropt before. To Gut. Gut eats and drinks, doth nothing els but swill, His teeth do grind, his mouth's the water-mil. To Simple. Simple you know I gave you good advice; Little to say, that men might think you wise; If you'l proclaim your self a fool you may: I onely tel you now what others say. To Brisk. Brisk is in love, yet saies a single life Is best and freest from sorrow, care, or strife: What e'r you think, beleeve't 'tis true you say, Marry! you'l find it so another day. On Nano being angry. How Nano swels? how big he looks and high? What a large spleen he bears? so hath the flie. To my Reader. Wonder not why I humbly do not write, Flatt'ring Encomium's to this Lord, that Knight! And each known friend, as hungry Poets use! Mine is a substantive unpension'd Muse; Nor e'r was hir'd to write an Epigram In praise of this fool Lord, or that proud Dame. To one that asked me why I would write an English Epigram after B. Johnson. How! dost thou ask me why my ventrous pen Durst write an English Ep'gram after Ben? Oh! after him is manners, though it would 'Fore him, have writ, if how, it could have told. On Galla. Galla Hobgoblins fears, she saies, at night, And Ghostly Sprights, yet nought can her affright When any man is with her; shee's afraid More by the next daies light to be betrai'd. To Nab. Nab! thy small wits stil shrink i'th' wetting, why Then drinkst thou so? I'd have thee sow up, I Thy lips, but that thy tongue's the fiddle to The company, drink then! so that but go! Certain modest deprecations against my malevolent Detractour. May hee be proud, yet poor against his wil! May hee be forked, and yet jealous stil! May his wife beat him sober, when he's drunk! May his Xantippe prove, what's worse, a punk! May not the King reign in his purse a day! May he have ne'r a crosse when he shou'd pay! May no man mind him what he saies! and hee May he have neither friend or enemie! May no man read his lines! may none at least Commend, or laugh, when ere he breaks a jeast! May he eat much, and yet stil hungry feed! May no man lend him, when he stands in need! May he be deep in love, and ne'r obtain! May all his hopes be frustrate, and in vain! May his horse in his haste of business tire! May he be envious stil, and yet admire! Epigrams. Lib. 2. To the gentle Reader. 'Cause second thoughts are best, perhaps you'l look For higher Gusto in this second book: If so; read on! fine stomacks pleased are Better with second cates, though lighter fare. Sawce here perhaps you'l find unto your meat, I'l bring the Tart, if you'l but make it sweet. To the Lady Phanton. Madam! you wear a feather in your head, Your face is all Mosaick, coloured With shining unguents; next your linnen's white, Your garments too are, as your carriage, light; Your heel's are cork you walk on: I'l avow't, That Madam! now y' are light from head to foot. On Lying. Poets and Painters by authoritie As wel as Travellers we say may lie: Peripateticks lie, few know 'tis so; Painters for lying have some colour too; But Bolder Poets when they falsifie, They do't as neatly, they in Print do lie. Epitaph on John Newter. Reader! John Newter who erst plaid The Jack on both sides, here is laid, Who like th'herb John Indifferent Was nor for King or Parliament; Yet fast and loose he could not play With death, he took him at a Bay; What side his soule hath taken now God or Div'l? we hardly know: But this is certain; since he dy'd, Hee hath been mist of neither side. A Question about Law. One ask'd why th'Law was now so much neglected! Marry (said I) it never was respected, But stil declin'd ee'r since the Judges ruffs Were turn'd to little falling bands and cuffs. To my Book-seller. I'ave common made my book; 'tis very true; But I'd not have thee prostitute it, too; Nor show it barefac'd on the open stall To tempt the buyer: nor poast it on each wall And corner poast close underneath the Play That must be acted at Black-Friers that day: Nor fee some Herring-cryer for a groat To voice it up and down, with tearing throat. Nor bid thy 'prentice read it and admire, That all i'th' shop may what he reads enquire. No: profer'd wares do smel: I'd have thee know Pride scorns to beg: Modestie fears to wooe. On M? Fanning the Engastrometh. To speak within, and to ones selfe, and yet Bee heard, is much, yet Fanning doth it: So tall and stout a man, 'tis strange to see't So like a coward should his words down eat: The belly hath no ears they say; yet his Hath ears to hear, and tongue to talk, I wis. On the Invention of Printing and Guns. A souldier found at first the way to Print, And 'twas a German Munk did Guns invent: Thus like arm'd Pallas, learning doth depend On arms, nor can they without this, defend. To Megæra. Megæra! since thy ugly face would fright The Div'l himselfe, and all that look on it; Prithee why dost thou wear a looking-glasse? I cast a figure for that cause, she saies, To fright him from me, and each lustful eie: Fear't not! I'l warr'nt thee none shal tempt thee, I; For he that should on thy face doar, I'd swear, Both blind, and mad, bewitcht indeed he were. On Plot. Plot now he's married, and keeps house, I hear Is like his butter, mad but twice a year: In Hymens sheets good-fellowship may lie Thus bedred, and in time expiring die. To VV.B. a smal Poet. One distick well-made's worth two Poems ill; Prithee contract then thine to disticks Will. The Stonie Age. 'Tofore there was a Golden Age, next that A Silver one, but now 'tis Iron all: To what I tro wilt next degenerate? To stone I think in stead of Minerall. To Captain Nym. Betimes thou findst me e'r I stir, and sai'st Thy mornings draught o'r night thou promis'd wast, But thou nor car'st so much for that or me, My breeches in the chair thou com'st to see; Thy plot prevented thus thou fliest hence, In hast to th'next friend with the like pretence, Whose pockets, you surprising, borrow there Without his leave a crown perhaps, for fear More mist, might be discover'd, for thy friend Shouldst thou but ask it, would not six pence lend: Thus each friends hinder Phob thy want supplies, Whence thou dost raise thy daily subsidies, And pick some crums of comfort; but alas! Nym th'other night by Festus couzned was, With whom he needs would lie; for Festus did Not think his money safe though under's bed, But hid it in Nyms pocket: thought he, ne'r Wil, shifting Nym, look once for money there. Thus Nym protected, what he els had stole; Better to venter thus, then lose the whole. To Mutus. Mutus where e'r he comes in companie Sits stil, observes, speaks not a word to any: Are you a spie or State-informer grown? Set to pick treason, when we are high flown, From out our harmless mirth? forgive me pray! I'ave wrong'd you Mutus, you can nothing say. To Jealous. Jealous if any laughs is angry straight, Suspects they jeer at him; oh foolish Wight! Because another smiling wries his nose Wilt thou betray thy selfe, and so expose Thee to more laughter? though you guilty bee, Yet I dare say there's no man thought of thee. On Taurus. I Taurus told that his wife many lov'd; Hee lov'd her better 'cause she was approv'd: I said they us'd her; then he made reply, I care not so they use her wel, not I. Oh wilful Cuckold! who wil pittie thee, That when you're told, won't believe til you see? On Swill. On fasting-daies Swill eats and drinketh fast, Plaies fast, hopes thus the world wil alwaies last: Thus Swil doth fast, while the rule Fast and Pray, Hee onely changes into feast and play! On Resolute Bat. As rough as bear-skins for behaviour, Abisket face as hard for favour, As blunt as back of knife, as dul As whetstone, or cram'd capon ful, His talk as women backward flat, And though laught at, he's Resolute Bat; Hee'l to the Club, and prate his share Or more, pay lesse than any there; Oh what a pretty thing is it To be but bold though without wit? To Veta an old Shrew. Your husband musters old things quite forgotten, As men eat Medlers when they are quite rotten; All th'rags of time he hangs up, he can see; Keep out of's sight! or els he'l hang up thee! To Big. Big why hast got so smal a wife? 'tis best Thou sai'st, of evils we should chuse the least: Thou hop'st to overlay her, that's thy plot, Kil her and get another, is it not? To Mæchus. To be most idle thou maist well be sed, Whilst lazily thou dost thy work abed. On Captain Sharke. Sharkes Creditor promis'd oft, at length did say, Hee now begun to fear hee ne'r wou'd pay: You need not fear it Sir! Sharke made replie, I ne'r intended to repay it, I. To Boldface. Boldface I wonder at thy impudence, That dar'st affirm things so against all sence: For shame be n't impudent and foolish too! And think all men are fooles 'cause you are so! To Phydias a Painter. I Phydias askt how he could paint a maid? Find mee but one! I'l paint her then he said. On Chœril. Chœril because his wife is somewhat il, Uncertain in her health indifferent stil Hee turns her out of doors without reply: Wondring at which, I askt the reason why? In sickness and in health saies he, I'm bound Onely to keep her, either weak or sound; But now shee's neither, he replies: you'l see, Shee'l quickly now or mend or end, saies hee. On Stupro. Stupro on horseback saies hee'l ride no more, 'Tis 'cause hee hath been jaded much before: Hee may the Trojan Palfrey now bestride, The living jades are fiery hot, to ride. On Swillmore. Swillmore grown dry with talking, drinks til hee Was got so drunk he could nor speak nor see: His windy words foxt him; some drunk have bin, As well by letting out as taking in. On Brave. Braves money melt's in's pocket, 'tmay be so 'Twas warm before, but now 'twil colder grow. On Pure. His text no sooner nam'd, but Pure inveigh'd 'Gainst Rome, and run quite from't as one afraid: A sudden rapture 'twas; his text and hee I fear wil ne'r again meet, or agree. On Dull. So many men, so many minds there be; Yet in dispute Dull wil not disagree, But alwaies is on's neighbours mind, 'cause hee Cannot tel how to contradict, I see. On Sir Sullen Haughtie. When I thankt Haughtie for his curtesie, He said he not expected it from me: Nor I from him that kindness, wherefore I Thankt him 'cause't came so unexpectedly. To his worthy friend T.S. Esquire. If to be mild be Generositie; To scorn to give or take an injurie; If to be patient, and yet valiant too Be truly noble, then (Sir!) you are so: Virtu's the best Nobilitie is known, You're virtuous noble too, in this alone. To Pantagus. None can say ought, but you'l say something to't, There's nought another doth, but you can do't: You're cunning Pantagus, and singular, Good at all things, but no particular. To Lautus. Lautus thy palate can be pleas'd with nought But the best cates far-fetcht, and dearest bought; Sicilian Lampreys, and the Thuscan Boar, With witty dainties ne'r heard of before Vitelleus age, such as Minerva's shield, A dish made of Scares livers, and then fil'd With milt of Sturgeon, and with brains of Railes, Pheasants and Peacocks, and Egyptian Quailes, With tongues of Nightingales, and those more rare And seld-seen Crimson birds, his usual fare: Mullets and Celsey Coccles, the Severn Trout, And what more daintie novels can be bought: Botargo, Anchovois, Puffins too, to taste Thy Maronæan wines, at meals thou hast. Thus all thy lands thou eat'st and drinkest down, In thy fair Boggards buried lie, thus grown With dear-bought soil so rich, to dung the small Acre that's left unsold, and that is all. On Prophane. Prophane ne'r speaks of God, but in his oathes, Which he doth change more often than his cloathes: Nor thinks he on him when he vainly swears, Oh Atheist, that nor God, nor Devil fears. On Bib. Wisedome doth teach us silence, now Bib is With drink made speechless, is he not then wise? The effects of Brainsick's letters. Your lines were all so sweet, and work't so wel, So purg'd me too, that I can hardly tel Whether they wrought on my affections more Or on my body, I drew thence such store Of precious Elixer, and so much Compounded Cates, whose qualitie was such, That where my Physick promis'd me but seven, By virtue of your lines I had eleven, But yet I'l tel you; troth 'twas een forgot It purg'd and scar'd and wipt off you know what; It griev'd mee your fair hand should undergo So foul an office as to wipe it too; But rather then your hand or paper bee Stain'd with this act, let the guilt lie on mee. I did it 'cause I know that you could write Such lines again as fast as I could— Write to me oftner pray! so I may save Physicians fees, and may bum-fodder have. On M? Ap-Taffie Shentilman of Wales. The way to make proud Taffie down on's knees Is tel him that the Moon's made of green cheese; Hee then in Heav'n would bee, and wil desire Nought but to tost his bobbie by her fire. To an Irish-man. When I do sneeze, God blesse you, you do say, Why not the same when I do fart, I pray? Are not both sudden ruptures that do make As with an earthquake the whole body shake? To break before, at Irish, you do find To be less dang'rous then to break behind; Besides, this brings a good report you see, Why is not this as welcome then to thee? When I break forward, you (Christ help you) say, But when I backwards break, you backwards pray. Pardon me Sir! 'tis my infirmitie, 'Tis the windcholick that thus troubles me. To Spruce. Spruce wears a comb about him, alwaies he To prune and smooth his polisht haire: The Cock's ne'r too without his comb you see, Spruce 'tis a Coxcomb then you weare. To Formall. When Formal knows not what to say, then hee Oh Lord, Sir! cries with much tautologie: Now the Lord help thee Formal, 'twas wel meant, Though you but spoke of him in compliment. On Swift. Swift though h'has bin but once 'mongst Gentlemen, And hath learnt what their Christen names are, then He speaks to them in such familiar phrase, As if th'had long acquainted been, and saies, If any speak of them, he knows 'um wel, And cals them Jack, Dick, or the like, wil tel You when, and where he saw them last, and how Their intimate acquaintance first did grow. Swift thy too much familiaritie May breed contempt. Believ't they know not thee. The Wisdome of this age. The Wise-men were but seven: now we scarce know So many fools, the world so wise doth grow. On Priscus. Priscus doth poetize now he's in love; Strange each blind Lover should a Poet prove! He is inspired sure, how els could he Be such a Chymist in Loves Poetrie? He courts his Mistris out of Ovids art Has th'Amadis and Spencer all by heart, Whence he extracts his sonnets, and his rime, And speaks them, dreaming, in and out of time. Such sudden raptures seldome constant be, His love is blind, and so's his Poetrie. On Proud. Proud quarrels in his cups, and then wil fight, Is beaten sober, 'troth he is served right. On Doctor Emperick. Wise Emperick can all diseases cure, His Physick though't be strong it worketh sure: A litte mors in ollâ which expels Disease and life together, nothing els. Happy thy patient, you dispatch him quick; Your mighty art won't let him long be sick. On Bib. To quench his sorrows Bib drinks very free, Sorrow is drie, he saies, and so is hee. On Nokes. One askt why Nokes discoursing shakt his head? A Rattle-head 'twas 'cause he was, I sed: Therefore he shakt his empty sconce, to find Whether within with any braines 'twer lin'd: To his friend and Companion M? H.N. Wit's all the younger sons inheritance, A small estate, which cannot much advance: Virgil may talk of Bees, and dunging land, But 'tis the Heir that has them in his hand: To him th'indulgent father all doth give, While they alas have nought wherewith to live But what Dame Nature, like a careful mother, Laid up, and said 'twas for a younger brother. A store of Wit, heav'n knowes 'tis all she gave, And yet you're rich enough, while this you have. A Fico for thy brothers lands! thou'ast more In Mount Pernassus, than is all his store: There with Apollo thou maist sit and dine With heav'nly Nectar, sup with th'Muses nine; The lustie Gods and Goddesses wil be With all the Graces there in companie: There we have fields to walk in; oh what fine Mirth there is in good company and wine! Lastly to make you fully happy, Bettie; Will meet i'th' arbour; oh shee's wondrous prettie! Now tel me friend, is not this better sport, Than to have money, and no pleasure for't? To Levinus. I have lent Sharke monies, which Levinus, you Perswade me, long put off, he'l pay me now: When tro? at the Greek Calends? when the Fleet Wants guests? when he and I; two Sundaies meet? If he solve he, deceives me, if not, he Cozens me worse; stil I deceiv'd must be Whither he pay or not: I'ad rather tho Be thus deceiv'd then cozend: tel him so! On Vulpe. As Ravens 'bout the breathless Carkass flie, So swarm Vulpe's friends, now he but seems to die: Each greedy angler hook and line doth lay, Baited with gifts to catch this Aurata Which swallows both, escapes, takes all they give, Thus old get heirs each day, and stil doth live: Vulpe preys o'th, living, he most Vulter is; These Harpies hope for prey, but when Vulpe dies, Blessed Ignorance. Hee is most happy sure that knoweth nought, Because he knows not that he knoweth not. To a poore Begger. If thou hadst said th'hadst had no money, I Would then have thee believed, but now you lie, 'Cause you do say you want it, for 'tis mad To say one wants that which he never had: A word wel plac't may serve one at a need, Learn to beg right, or you may want indeed. On Thais her Bastard. Thais the mother, but the father who? Thais her self nor any else doth know: Can th'son oth' people want a father? when For parents he can claime so many men? On Gamster. Play fair and swear not? burn the tables! I Wil neither th'one nor th'other by this die: Gamester I'l now believe thee valiant too, 'Cause you'l not swear less then you mean to do. Epitaph on the Preaching Cobler How. Translated here lies Cobler How, Who, when he liv'd could rip and sow Divide and stitch a text together Just as he us'd to spoil his leather. Or rather here he's underlaid, Who oft o'rlay two chairs and praid, That his inspired tongue might mend More souls then e'r his Coblers end Or hands could cure: he often said Walk ye uprightly in your trade! And when your soles do tread awry Bring them to me I pray! and I Wil set them streight: be mending stil As I am! 'Tis Gods heav'nly wil. Many were wrought on thus, but th'time was past, And so he finisht when death brought his last. Cobler thou hast set up enow That since can prate like Cobling How. On Sir John Lackland. Jack Lackland bringing gracious news to Court, The King was hap'ly pleas'd to Knight him for't: He proud of's honour writes to all his friends, And with—Yours Sir Iohn Lackland—Knight—he ends. 'Tis fit he shud, for wer't not under's hand None would believe him Knight, that had no land. On Cosmo. Cosmo in's new and holiday array, Then to be sure he walks abroad that day; Goes to a play, wil stand i'th' pit, and talk, Whiffe smoak, or to be markt, out often walk. 'Tis pitty Cosmo wears no oftner new, For then he oftner would appear in view. On Lowsi-Patch. Who saies Patch low sie vestments weareth, when They are so threadbare that no vermin can Upon them stick? Yes: though that they be thin His loving lice stick closer to his skin. On Light. Light steals a jeast, and then to mak't his own He walks from one to th'other, up and down; By oft repeating thus he prostrates it; Light hath a common, though a running wit. On a fire in a Town. One night through all the streets the men did crie Fire fire! at which I wak't and wondred by; Not that drie wood should burn, but because all Did crie fire, when they should for water call. Epitaph on Hocas Pocas. Here Hocas lies with his tricks and his knocks, Whom Death hath made sure as his Juglers box: Who many hath cozen'd by his Leiger demein, Is presto convey'd and here underlain: Thus Hocas he's here, and here he is not, While death plaid the Hocas, and brought him toth' pot. To one that talked finely. How prettily it talks as you would say His speech did wear her holiday array? With fine spun language drest is his discourse, It talks in print where not a word of course Drops from his tongue, but all so finely wove So smooth so soft as you would swear he strove To outdo the silkworm, whilst each word he saies Was studied for before, for th'better grace. Speak like a man stil to be neatly drest Is womanish: your homespun cloath is best, Because 'twil longer last and finer wear, Labour'd invention holds not out the year. To Cosmo on his fair scolding wife. Smoak makes one fair, yet saies the Proverb, where It alwaies smoaks, 'tis a soul sign that there A dangerous Scold doth dwel, whose fiery tongue Outdo's the fire and draws the smoak along. The troubled house. Cosmo th'hast light upon A fair scold to thy wife, the Question Whither her tongue, that charm'd these clouds to rise, Or the smoak, cause so many crying eies. On Silly. Silly observes the company and hears How each man throws about his jeasts and jeers, Lest any spie him he about him looks And forth his pocket steals his table-books. To glean those crums which wise men throw away, With which he feasts himself another day. Silly by chance did loose his Diarie Of wit, which he had got o'th' companie: No marl he now so mute and pensive sits, How can he chuse, since he hath lost his wits? To Momus. Because I no Mæcenas get To patronize my verse as yet Nor wooing e'r bespok my friend To swear them witty or wel pen'd; Momus dares say they'ar poor, not worth The owning, silly, and so forth: Ingenious Readers are my Judges here, But Momus you are none of those I fear. On Bib. A drunken man can catch no harme they say, How then came drunken Bib so poxt I pray! He was not drunk enough when that he caught, He could not so have done or suffer'd ought. To Moore. A Pockhold-lean-swarth-face with ugly hair And yet be trim'd each morn to make thee fair? If 'bout that face thoult keep so much ado, Get thee a Barbar, a Facemender too? To Madam Cr. wearing a lookinglass at her Girdle. Madam! you look so often on your glass, I fear you doubt whither or no your face Be stil your own, or the same yesterday It was: for colours change or fade away. Then view no more thy own fair Physnomie! Because I'd have thee look the more on me. On Squire Huffe. Squire Huffe had got a vap'ring trick to talk High ranting words, then 'bout the room to walk Like bold Andrea acting on the stage Often in speech would personate his rage: Sometimes he grew Satyrick and would strein To jeer each man in King Cambyses vein. Blunt being toucht grew angry, made reply Though I cann't prate yet you shal find that I Can fight, and beat him soundly: 'tis the way Thus to cure madmen, as I have heard say. On Philip Soupe and Jone his wife. Lo I the tragick story sing o'th' life And death of Philip Soupe and Ione his wife; A friendly pair of Turtles that did love Goodfellowship and lusty ale above All earthly good: for why? they oft wu'd say 'Tis high and mighty Ale doth griefs allay, And when 'tis nappy and spirituall, Ale is both meat and drink, and cloath, and all, For all's included in this sentence Ale: Lets drink it then they cryd, or new or stale. It hap't these two once wanting companie Which made them sad, and sadness made them drie, Set foot to foot, and tryd the masterie, Each lookt to th'to'ther too with narrow eie, Phil drunk to Iug, and Iug cryd Phil again Til none could stand or speak one sentence plain, Fild up toth' throat when both could drink no more And th'rest o'th' drink left running 'bout the floor, 'Cause neither could the spicket wield aright, Resolving as 'twas time to sleep that night, They shok their cloaths off both at last, and so Stumbled into their beds with much ado: But oh the sad disasters that befel them At this encounter! You anon shal smel them: For when Iug rows'd to buss her Philip, she Her stomack being o'r-charg'd did rain a sea Of pow'rful Ale in poor Phil's face and breast, Whose gaping mouth, and stomack thus opprest With the receipt of his wives spew'd-up liquor Grew sick, no vomit could have made him sicker, He turn'd and groan'd as if he were to die, Then straightwaies fac't about, and furiously Reverst, he charg'd her body with his rear On her right flanck all-to-bedighting her, Then he drew up and spew'd, then charg'd agen Til he had routed all her bodie, then After a Parley sounded, Iug did say Thou'rt pestlence hot, draw off now, Philip, pray; The place soon grew too hot indeed for them, For the foul Stygian lake did never steam With such gross vapours as did thence arise, Ready to choak them both in woful wise. At last Phil reacht for th'Iordan where he might Convert his Ale to Lees, but missing it He fel a ground: the like did Iug bety'd Who reaching for the drink o'th' other side Fel down with th'chamberpot upon her head, Beside themselves, and both beside the bed; Nak'd and asleep i'th' morning both were found In pickle prostrate on the spawled ground: Sad chance! this loving couple never were Known until now to fal out any where: Oh cursed Ale could thus part man and wife! 'Twas in their cups, let that excuse the strife. On Poet Cordus a Rimer. When Poet Cordus writes, he oftentimes Doth wier draw his matter to his rimes, Provide but reason, rime wil flow; but he Harps more upon the words, then sence, I see. On Fusk. Why should Fusk of his wife so jealous be Unless his own sins taught him jealousie? (For we are often more suspicious far Of that wherein our selves most guilty are:) Some rather think Fusk insufficient, And 'cause he cannot give his wife content Therefore he fears she seeks abroad, for why Women they wil be satisfi'd, or cry: Some say he thinks she's wiser far then he, And so turns Envie into jealousie: Stil the fault lies in him not her, you see, While Fusk grows lean with triple jealousie. To an old deformed Woman. Thou art a Remedie for love, for he That thee beholds, in love shal never be. To Cit. I wonder Cit thou art so confident Sure I ne'r gave thee such encouragement, I never borrowed of thee, nor was I Ever once drunk in thy base companie, Nor did you e'r pimp for me, or bid me come To dinner with your friendly wife at home, You ne'r yet offer'd to be bound for me Nor canst claim kinred by affinitie: How dare you then be so familiar With me? what! do you think because you are Free of the City, and in time may be The grave Cinquater of your Companie Or 'cause sometimes you walk in scarlet gowne, Reverenc'd by boys and watermen oth' town, Or 'cause your sattin doublet's girt with gold, I'm therefore bound to you? are you thus bold Because you are grown rich by wicked gain? To your shop Squundrel! and your wares again! And converse there with thy Apprentices. If thou'lt oblige me with true curtesies And lend gentilely, then perhaps I'l own Thee for a friend, else thou'rt a Cit: be gone. To Plagiarie. Feloniously thou stealst anothers wit, 'Cause sure thou art to have thy book for it: Thou art no learned thief yet, for although Thou readest wel thou canst not write wel too. To Lysippus a Barber. Lysippus! some mistane, have said that you Are a Barbarian, but I think a Jew, You circumcise so much, and for your ends So smoothly stroak the faces of your friends, Making young novices of all that you Can circumvent: thus you are a Barbarous Jew. To a corrupt Judge. Why thou so dear dost law and Justice sel, Dost hear and take on either side so wel, I wonder not: the Court Seianus made Thee buy thy place so dear as some have said; Great reason then that who so dear doth buy, Should th'price enhance when he doth sel, as high. Lydia encountered. Francis and Lydia in a jeasting way Each other strove to jeer; he won the day At last, and silenc'd her; at which she grew So vext, that in her passion she flew Upon young Francis, and 'twixt rage and fear Saluted him with a fair box o'th' ear, He threw her down o'th' bed, and kist her 'til She cri'd agen, for madness, 'gainst her wil: Oh sweet revenge! who would not thus fall out If he might have but such a kissing bout? Kiss and be friends was the old way you know Of reconciling, so it seems 'twas now. On Gaming. Some play for gain, to pass time others play For nothing, both do play the Fool I say: Nor time or coin I'l lose or idly spend; Who gets by play, proves loser in the end. On Brag. Brag his right glove draws often off and on, To show his wounds on each occasion: Tel not for shame, Brag, where thou gotst those scars; A tavern broil did mark thee, not the wars. To Cosmo. Reading my verses Cosmo wonders why They swel not with Poetique Historie, Why I not use their pretty fables, whence I may suck matter to enlarge my sence? As now to speak of Danae's golden show'r, Then of Narcissus turn'd into a flow'r, Ixions wheel, or Sysiphu his stone, Or how the Moon kiss'd lov'd Endymion; Then to display Medusa's snakie locks, Or talk of wise Pandora and her box, Or him that wisht that all he toucht were gold, And how this granted all his meat resolv'd At the first touch to gilded baits, and he Not able to disgest them, forc't to die: Then of slain Pelops Ivory shoulder, how Io by jove was turn'd into a cow: Of th'Minotaur's born of Pasiphe And of Leucothee turn'd into a tree Of frankincense: or of Tiresias Who sometimes man and sometimes woman was: Then of Minerva born of Jupiters brain Or by his wife how Hercules was slain With Nessus poison'd shirt: or of the maid Turn'd to a spider, how she first was said To invent spinning: these he did conclude With many more you may ofttimes allude Unto your purpose, where each fiction By allegoricall allusion Becomes your own, and thereby also you Are both Historian and Poet too. Troth I wil tel thee why I did omit Such fabulous phansies, first because I writ Not only to be read but understood; And next 'cause lies, down not with all, for food. The finest web is by the spider spun; He's poor that borrows his invention. On Mounsieur Congee. A proper handsome courtly man indeed, And wel set out with cloaths, can for a need Discourse with legs, and quarter congies, and Talk half an howr with help of foot and hand. But when I viewd this Mounsieur clean throughout I found that he was only man without. On Gripe. Gripe to himself talks of the sums he lent And of the debts he ows, but to prevent Others from borrowing more; away you Iew Dost think I'd ask of such a knave as you? Besides if I of thee to day should borrow, I know th'whole town should hear of it to morrow. To Harsh. Musick that once could move each rock and tree Not a whit moves thee Harsh, or pleaseth thee; Thy inharmonious soul how wilt thou bring To Heav'n, where Angels nothing else but sing? A Hellish sure and untun'd soul hath he That is not rapt with musicks extasie: Knowst not what evil-spirits it expels? It cur'd afflicted Saul, and nothing else: It doth inspire the soul and heighten it; Tho' hadst better lose thy ears than once be bit By a Tarantula whose deadly wound Is only healed by soft musicks sound. To Cupid. His Armes blazoned. Luna he bears, in a cross Saturn plain A flaming heart transfixed Sol; thus slain In the wounds orifice it bleeds Mars, from whence Bloudie drops flow, and under the pretence For Motto this inscribed more is, Sanat Amor vulnus amoris. Thy Arms do speak thee Noble, Cruel too, Else thou wouldst ne'r so many hearts undo: How much thou dost degenerate I find, For thy fair Goddesse Mother was more kind. On proud M??. Minx. Pride takes no cold, yet Pride oft takes a fal: Both which are true in this our finical Proud Mrs. Minx fair Madams waiting maid For though she went like her spruce Dame arraid In her cast gowns, bare, all the neck and breast Down to the shoulders, and sometimes the rest; Yet took no cold, pride and lust kept her warm Though she went stript up above half the arm. Yet did the pride of this She-goat at last Catch a shrewd fal, for by a stumbling cast I'th' Lobby room her heels flew 'bove her head And so she broke her elboe 'gainst the bed. Yet though she fel her belly riss: what else? Pride naturally when 'tis at lowest swels. On three Knights without spurs. Sir Iohn in's spurs no rowels had, because There was no need, his horse twice roweld was: Sir George but one spur wore, for if one side Will go, to'ther wil follow he reply'd: I askt Sir Lancelot why no spurs he wore? Because saies he, a free horse needs no spur. If spurs shew Knights and Horsemen; then I fear 'Mongst them was neither Knight or Chivalier. On Copernicus his opinion who thought the earth went round. In vain did Drake with pains the Earth sail round, Here's one could do it easier on the ground. On Doctour Love-Self. Love-Self when th'Plague in London reigned sore, Grown rich himself shuts up and wu'd no more When most his help was wanted: it seems then Hee'd not his patients keep as married men Must keep their wives in Sickness and in Health, Such is the fearful cowardize of wealth. Though thou with th'Plague would'st nothing ha' to do, A Plaguy cunning Doctour yet wer't thou. To my smal friend with a great beard. Thy face and self are smal, but large thy beard: Lop't off! thy wood wil hide thee I'm afferd. To Ignorant Zoile. Zoile I am told you pish and pough, when e'r You any do my lines commending hear: Pish on! 'cause you stil in the wrong place pish, Aspersing most the best, as I could wish. To the Reader. It is enough: but if you think too much, Then Reader! say you saw me not! for such As I for writing what is bad, will you By others be for reading counted too.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">SATYRS. SATYR 1. The Argument. Several phantastick Humors here Of Sea-sick minds described are, Wedded to spend their time in vain: Whence th'Authour woos them to refrein. Oh men! oh manners! what a medly's this When each mans mind more than face diff'rent is? For by forms only we distinguisht be One from another: but! alas! to see! We varie from our selves each day in mind, Nor know we in our selvs our selvs to find. Sure had Erasmus liv'd til now, he wu'd Without an Oedipus ne'r have understood The riddles of this dark phantastick age, Where each Ape alters with the scæne the stage. Had I thy razour Actius to dissect These Gordian knotty humours men affect, I'd sharp my pen, and after steep it all In wormwood vinegar and Stygian gal. Lend me thy whip Alecto! that I may Scourge the prepost'rous times, as Boys at play Do whip their eggshels! yet don't I wel know Whether my anger they deserve or no, But rather pittie; whether rather I Should with scorn laugh at them, or for them crie. Ev'n Heraclitus spleen would tickled be To view Welch bobbie and Garlick eat, or see A French grenovillio fricas with young mice And mushroms mixt, or the low-dutch device Of roasted sprats and Herrings, or th'Irish Tough bonyclabber, or that German dish Of pickled snails and tender Grashoppers, Or the Jews Locusts with their Elder ears, As much as see an Asse eat thistles; who Would not admire that every Country so Should vary phansies, and thus strangely affect A nouvell diet with their Dialect? But stomacks like our minds are sickly too, Both are best pleas'd with quelquechoses vain so new. So have I seen a travaild Squire discourse On several sawces, spin out second course With a picktooth in's mouth, and chafindish To stew his raw roast fowl and codled fish, Til we had lost our stomacks, and new got: Learn'd in the art of eating was he not? Yet this at home most galls my patience To see so humorous a difference Of more phantastick giddy minds that draw Like Mules and Oxen each another way. Here's one writes more than some good Scholars read, And quoats more Authours than Pryn ever did, Or in the whole world necessary be; Whilst in one Tome a Vatican thus he Erects; so have I seen a Pampleter That rails 'gainst Bishops, make his margin far Exceed his senceless Thesis, whilst he swels His leaf with texts of Scripture little else, And those false cited or as heterogene And wide from's purpose as is Po from Seine. Such swarmes of scribled Rapsodies begot Ragmen to enrich, Typographers, and not The Understanding; since they more distract Each weakned judgement, wu'd they were by Act Condemn'd to flames! Learning is more profound When in few solid Authours 'tmay be found. A few good books disgested wel do feed The mind, much cloys or doth ill humours breed. Seempol sets down in his Ephemeris The trifles of each how'rs vain exercise, Toys that should be Ephemera indeed Dying the same day they were born and bred. Things of so smal concern or moment, who Would stuffe his Diarie with, or care to know? As what he wore, thought, laugh't at, where he walkt, When farted, where he pist, with whom he talkt. Memento's more ridiculous than those The City Chronicler made at Lord Mayors shows; As who his Hinchboys were, who wav'd the sword, Who brought the Custard to his Honours boord, What year a Lyon whelpt i'th' Tower dy'd, Pepper or corn was dear, whose child bestride Each gilt Colossus Pageant in Cheapside, Or in what year Bartholomie Fair forbid. (Whereas Historians only things of weight, Results of Persons or affairs of State, Briefely with truth, and cleerness should relate) Laconick shortness memorie feeds. I hate A long spun story of one drawn toth' stake Would reach from Newgate to Smithfield, and make The martyr'd reader sweat as much or more Than Latimer i'th' flames, with a bald score Of phars'd (Quoth he's) in every page at least; As without them 'twere not to be exprest. But Dulman barren of invention, wears His time and books in reading only. Here's Squire Topas spends his daies in killing flies, And like Domitian such a drone he dies. Rare was th'Italians Art, who writ so smal Three pence hid Pater Noster, Creed and all; And made our Charls but half way drawn to shine With most Majestick Holyness when each line Of th'admir'd purtraict breath'd such heav'nly flames, That the smal piece spoke all the Reading Psalms, Without a magnifying glass what eie Could yet discern the letter'd Physnomie? Oh most laborious losse of time! So rare Callicrates his Ivorie Emmets were, With's Elegiack verses writ so smal That a Hart cherrystone contein'd them all; As Homers Iliads in a nutshel were; Th'whole world describ'd in a young Orenge sphere. Archytas wooden dove Agellius nam'd, Or that same wooden Eagle Bartas les jour. 1. semain. Bartas fam'd, Or th'Iron flie his Salust mentions, Regiomontanus his Inventions: Ælians rig'd ship or his ???????? made So little that they each might be convey'd Under a Bees smal wing unseen, what are They all but witty trifles? sans compare Industrious follies? who would loose so much Dear precious time to be accounted such A precious indefatigable Asse? Pantagons art sure no lesse subtile was Who muzzled fleas and gold chains made to lead Them captiv'd in. But oh my sides and head Would ake with laughter, should I muster all Such vain Sysiphian toils. Yet must I cal To mind Belanch, who as ill spent his time I'th' mysterie of moustraps and birdlime. These fond ()?????????? labours were By Alexander witt'ly scoffed, where To one who on a needles point each time Could throw a pea, he gave a peck of them. Our time was lentus to be employd in high And nobler Projects, not thus fruitleslie. Yet better tis thus to mispend it stil, Than nought to do, or what is worser, il. Wel then!— Since each mans humour is his minds delight, Let him persu't! mine is to laugh at it. SATYR 2. The Argument. A Female Synod is conven'd Of holy Sisters that pretend To Sanctitie in dress and show, But are discover'd nothing so. Hel and damnation! what Imposture's this? A She white linnen Saint without, yet is Incarnate Devil: i'st not that same Fiend Was found besieg'd by her Apostle friend In Antlin's porch the other morn? before The Sexton rose they 'ad knocking forc't the door, Had not the grave disturber of dead bones And bels, there stumbled o'r them both at once. Out you unhallow'd whore! is this the way To enter heav'n at thy streight gate I pray? D'you sanctifie your Cuckold dormant? must Your mother Church be bawd to goatish lust? Yet goes she in and sitting prays and hears With as observing eies, attentive ears The Lecture, as the holiest Matron there: As though her cleanstarcht handkerchieve was ne'r With close embraces rumpled. Oh what front Of impudence that sex can put upon't! As shee'd suck in nothing that day but grace, Mark how she eies the Preacher in the face! Able to stare suspicion thence! as I Have seen hoarse ranting Gape with stedfast eie, Boldly out-face a petty lurie, when The Iudge was after dinner sleeping. Then She having glean'd in her spruce table book Such crums of comfort as the Caiaphas took First upon trust, with the next Sisterhood 'Mongst marrow bones and other lustie food, She scatters them for breakfast, where must be The moyling Priest (for 'tis not fit that he Should spend his lungs, oyl, labour too in vain:) Great pleasures justly do attend great pain. Their bellies fill'd like windstuft bagpipes, so Their squeaking Organs must be going too: Such strange disputes here controverted be Would puzzle a Scotch-lay-Presbyterie. Whether that Bigamie been't as lawful now As 'twas 'tofore? Speak Sister Ruth! we know You have two husbands now, besides that one Who next stands fairly in election. Truly and verily, I professe you may, How should the Church be built up else, I pray? Her doctrine Hannah did approve, and doubt Whether not in the Church as wel as out Women might speak? the Priest resolv'd they should Speak out as much and often as they would, But never in. A Female Synod is Resolv'd on to convene: the way was this; Each truth-inspired She forthwith to meet Either in Marklane or near Criplegate, In Eutichus the Taylours chamber, there Each Monday 'bout Religion to conferre. Th'Assembly meets and sits: a pretty sight Fair smooth chin'd Gospellers in aprons white: Cathedral lawn not half so learned is. No Prolocutour here was made, I wis: They were all speakers. First grave Abigail The Sempstresse having first pronounc'd them all A holy Convent: damned in one word Arminians with their books to fire and sword. Such Tyrants women are: when they in stead Of distaffs scepters take, they'l rule their head. Peace! Peace! said busie Martha, we not know Nor the She-Burgers in Geneva how These Schollards tenets to confute: let's talk Of things we better understand, and balk Their Heathnish Problems! I had rather know Whether the world in ninty seav'n or no, (As Hoord affirms) shal be dissolv'd? for this More fit and to be known more easie is. My husband's now about some land to buy And I'd not have him throw't away said she; By no means let him do't, said Sarah, no: But rather in Reversion let him 'stow His money at that fatal period, when The world for certein must dissolve, for then Th'earth for a thousand years shal leased be To us the Saints for little, saied She. To quit this was a learned Quære made, By a thin antiquated Chambermaid, Run mad with reading Dod and Broughton, where She scruples whether Aarons Ephod were Of the skie colour of seawater green; The dyers all of Amsterdam have been Long in dispute about the question. Next the point of Prædestination Was startled to perplex the more: in haste From this to Freewil these Heav'n drivers past, And Squirrel-like as nimbly leapt from this As o'r one bog to another wild Irish: Like th'dogs that lapt at Nilus seav'nfold stream They lick the flouds now they have troubled them; Or as young Scepticks in Philosophie From Air to Water, Fire to Earth wil flie, Peripateticks in Divinitie O'r all its Elements thus they likewise hie, As nimbly with their tongues, as standing stil O'r th'world a man in a map travel wil, With's eie in one short minute, yet not know Where the Moguls rich country stands, or how His own is rul'd. In every doubt at last All unresolv'd each to their homes do haste, With their boss'd Bibles truss'd beneath their arms, Thumb'd in the Revelation and the Psalms. Bodie O death! who should they meet at door But Grace the waitingmaid that saltchin'd whore? Who before shethe Pædagogue had wed Took all preventives, and when e'r she sped Toucht Sowbread, Gladdon us'd, and Savin, food To slink her spurious and abortive brood, Procur'd for her dear Madams daughters, taught Them to leap oft, soon as their wombs were fraught: Yet with her cloak as holy face now wears Where little hair much Sanctitie appears. Lord! how she sighs in direful accents, that Private affairs had made her come so late! What matter ist? How d'ee; her quondam friend Her Ladies gentle Go-before doth find Her there, renews acquaintance, and thence brings Her to his Laundresse private house and flings Her down on the refreshing mat: the bed Being ta'ne away and nothing but the sted There left to hold the sport up, since the poor Old Bawd her bedcloaths found too fast were wore. Each met their comforters before they went To their tup Cuckolds: so the day was spent. But I am no Sir Pandarus of Troy, To sent each City stop or close dequoy: I am no Pimp or Constable; if more Sinners you'd find, search Bridewel! there be store, Who though they been't all sanctifi'd alike, Yet are as right for the cause Catholick. SATYR 3. The Argument. The formal breeding of an heire I'th' City is described here, Where the more formal States-man his Admired creature pourtraid is. Man is a laughing Creature, who in this, And a soul rational distinguisht is From brutish beasts: yet even they not have Like use of Reason seem they wise or grave. Follies in them pitty or laughter move In men of wiser judgement: to reprove Whose open Errours with as publike smiles Is best: for silent pitty but beguiles And hardens follie by connivance; we By precept and example taught must be. Yet both are scarce enough to instruct or wean Some from the Simples which they first suckt in With their flit nurses milk: for sure it is Midwives and Nurses make men fools or wise. Why should not Cosmus els that City heir, Whose education was the onely care Of his indulgent parents wiser prove? For see how like a Puppet he doth move, Or Quarter-striker turns upon his toe, As in a frame when he saluteth you! Good manners are not bought at th'Change or Schools: Art's Nature servant; Fools wil stil be fools Yet wasters could he manage for Pruans wel At Islington on Sundayes, and to tel You truth had learnt to dance, but that his ear And he both so inapprehensive were. But he is rich, hath fin'd for Sheriff twice, And wears good cloathes; yet out of them, or his Mean rabscab companie, looks like what he was First born and bred, that is a precious Asse. So there's a river in Boetia Wherein the fishes shine like gold they say; But taken thence look but as other frie. The City seldome breeds Gentilitie Til three or four discents. No Oake can be Upon a Peartree graft so contrarie And wide their Natures are. But see his friend Whom he so often walks with to Mile-end, The Fencer Peregrin that brags he can Kil at Duello more than any man; Has rules to print the flesh, as the Stoccata, Passada, Punto, and the Imbroccata, With more Italian postures; by a groom, Yet was disarm'd, beat and kickt out o'th' room, The other Morn at th'Trumpet: could not skil Guard him from such a sawcie foot as wel? Hang't, this is horse-play, saies he; oh the sence Of discreet manhood valiant patience! Thus men discover'd are by th'companie They keep, and throughly known: els why wou'd he Delight in Dabcok, that Town-gul, whose nose And face are as ridiculous as cloathes? Marrie to laugh at; that himself might bee Thought wiser, though God knows, but one degree. As ugly Ladies waiting faces get More ugly them the better off to set. Many o'th' City have such properties To worship them, and with forc't laughter please. For is't not brave to be the best i'th' room, Pay all, have all respect, and after come To be admir'd by Squndrels? Formal I Am most incens'd with yet, whose gravity Outweighs all other parts, his speech is cream Starcht as his beard, takes his hat off by th'brim Methodically 'twixt two fingers, while His face of Essayes seldom deigns to smile; Like one i'th' Isle of eggs he nicely walks, Affects strange sawces, like a Sophister talks, Respects none that wear worser cloathes than he, And thinks himself the rare Academie; More proud of's little wit, neat hose, than e'r Incæptor was of's gown the first whole year, Loves to be eied, yet looks nor drinks below The salt, seems gravely wise, is nothing so. How practis'd is this policie? for most men Study more how to seem judicious, than To be so, herein whilst their best wisdome lies To hide their follies in Scholastick guise: This is a fit companion, Cosmus wear This Bristol Diamond in thy copper ear! 'Fore him, that young proud Statist I must hate, Whose face is all Mosaick, intricate, And ful of artificial gravitie, Talks to himself where e'r he goes, with eie By speculation downward fixt, though he Looks higher than his foretop, hopes to be O'th' Privie Councel: and wil whispring tel News known as doubtful as an Oracle. This is that other earwig crept into Cosmus acquaintance, whom he graceth too; Hee onely bids him welcome for his tongue, With which he feeds him all the dinner long; Lends what he asks, though he ne'r thanks him for't, And hardly owns him when he comes to Court. Yet oft his wife he visits, swears by Jove He'l place her at next Mask neer or above The Maids of Honour, tels her too he'l get Her Husband Knighted; thus his debts hee'l quit While Cos. buyes honour. Oh what Emphasis And weight his words bear while 'mongst men he is! Each line he speaks looks like a Pyramis, On whose three sides one undiscover'd is. His Janus Hieroglyphick double front Speaks him an Oedipus: oh out upon't! The Guelphs and Gibellines not so factious were, As the confused thoughts and projects here In's Machiavellian noddle; now he dreams Waking of Crowns and Kingdoms, Stratagems To subvert Mahomet, or for private gain Patents for Pins or Soape, or els his brain Sweats with Monopolies of bones, or tough Calves-skins wel drest to sel for Irish Buff. Passant he deign'd me once a nod and smile, To be but known to these Court earwigs, I'l Be sworn is ev'n as great a grace or mo Than had I kist his Holinesses toe. His Cæsar Hawks-nose his ambition shows, While thus like Niles tal Crocodile he grows As long as e'r he lives: he'l surely sup With one o'th' Secretaries o'th' State, and up With some great Lord, or other at each word, To gain the audience of all the board, Whom he names as familiarly, as he Were his Compeer, and not his propertie. His foot-boy comes and whispers him in haste: The news? I'm set, so soon as supper's past, Go tel my Lord I'l wait on him. How now? A sweating Porter bring a Letter too? Directed to th'most accomplisht Gentleman? Oh it's from the Lady—he replies, the hand I know, and business: wel he might, he wrote The letter all himself, a pretty plot. E'r he goes thence a prentice with a noat Seal'd from his Creditour finds him, he opes it not, But loudly tels the youth his Masters suit To morrow shal be granted, that he'l do't, Bids him be confident. Emploi'd he is In every sceene thus with new business. SATYR 4. The Argument. A Silly Zelot gets a living, Grows fat upon't: while Gripe by thriving Too fast and ill, doth dearly get His death; for such a balter's fit. Go search Niles deeps, and find me if you can, A thing so ugly as this monster man! I mean that lean-chopt fellow, whose white face And night-cap make him look like th'Ace Of Spades, so formal is his pickdevant, While hee so meagre looketh, and as wan As Adam 'gainst the hedge in clay, when he Was set a drying fore the Sun, to be Inspir'd with breath: no Ananias e'r Painted on Countrie tapistrie could appear So Ghostly or precise; as he had fed On roots alone, for those he studied, As Hebrew with a Chaldee paraphrase, Or Syriack, while the Greek and Latine was Prophane and modern language counted: but Behold his clean-starcht ruff o'th' holy cut And pure Geneva set! whose every one With the bright steel of Revelation Was throughly open'd: but to say no more, Most pure he was from head to foot all o'r: I could have wisht this Hypocrite had bin But half so pure, and so sincere within. Such hollow falshood in a Prophet guide, Confirms the errours of the world beside. Did he not roundly pay for's Benefice By symoniack contract e'r 'twas his? Did he not wed his Patrons niece? some say Hee sprung her mine too e'r the marriage day: And puts her portion now to usurie. But oh! what an egregious dunce is he? And when ordain'd examining did fear More than a young thief caught, and made appear Before a Justice for his first offence: But his preventive wit and impudence Wrought wel with th'Bishops Chaplain I believe, Whom he had fed on Ordination Eve To say as th'Ordinary to th'Judge is wont, Legit ut clericus, my Lord: though he don't One letter know. 'Tis usual this: while so By such cheats knaves and fools get livings too. But oh! how drunk for joy hee got that night I'th' Bishops sellar! now the thankful wight Having his fees discharg'd goes home, looks worse Austere and graver than his Lordships horse; Wrangles and sues his neighbours, keeps no house Of hospitalitie, nor gives one sous Throughout the year to th'poor. Gripe comes to be Resolv'd a case of conscience, if Usurie Of ten i'th' hundred may be lawful ta'n? Yes, yes: your talent must not up be lain But to the most improved. Hear you me! The tithe of all your coines encrease must be Paid mee your Parson! Nay, then Gripe replies, I'l rather let't at nine per cent. as is My usual course: my sows shal farrow too No more than nine at a time: I wil go Sel all my land, and stock, and into gold Convert it for encrease; all shal be sold Before I'l give one doight away: the King Sha'nt have a subsidie, the poor nothing For mee. Thus Gripe is now a Chymist grown, What he should eat, drink, wear the miching hound Turns into metal, whose each new Image He sacrificing doth adore: no Age E'r such a muckworm bred: he never wil Marry; children are charges, Women il. Hee buyes bread, pares it, sends it back again For staler, for which cause the Baker's lain I'th' Pillorie: he ne'r at home wil eat; But at anothers board until he sweat Again, he swils like any thresher, and Communion wine he drinks til's neighbours stand Amaz'd, and think as if in stead of's own Hee drinking were his Saviour's health around. Hee won't part with a hair, and for that cause No Shaver neer him comes; and hates the Lawes 'Cause they forbid ingrossing: and is dumb When Cosk wou'd borrow; nay shou'd Christ once come On Earth again, the Wretch would not lend him One tester, wer't the whole world to redeem Without securitie of Angels. The Jew So circumcis'd his silver he was brought Before the Judge to answer for his fault. Hold up thy lean hand Gripe! Guiltie or not? Not guiltie my good Lord: the Jurie that Shal trie. These clippings all I found In's trunk. 'Twas but to make the money round, Gripe pleads, which first the coyners did neglect; Onely Rix dollars which I did elect 'Cause they were too square, and broad, for that respect. Hence take him Jaylour! oh the sad effect Of covetizing! Can't I ransom'd be? Take all my goods! save but my life and me. No: sentence is past: how the hangman swears And curses 'cause no better cloathes he wears. FINIS.</field>
