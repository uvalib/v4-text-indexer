      <field name="fulltext">ADDRESS TO PLENTY IN WINTER Oh, thou Bliss! to riches known, Stranger to the poor alone, Giving most where none's requir'd, Leaving none where most's desir'd; Who, sworn friend to miser, keeps Adding to his useless heaps Gifts on gifts, profusely stor'd, Till thousands swell the mouldy hoard: While poor, shatter'd Poverty, To advantage seen in me, With his rags, his wants, and pain, Waking pity but in vain, Bowing, cringing at thy side, Begs his mite, and is denied, Oh, thou Blessing! let not me Tell, as vain, my wants to thee; Thou, by name of Plenty styl'd, Fortune's heir, her favourite child. 'Tis a maximâhunger feed, Give the needy when they need; He whom all profess to serve The same maxim did observe: Their obedience here, how well, Modern times will plainly tell. Hear my wants, nor deem me bold, Not without occasion told: Hear one wish, nor fail to give; Use me well, and bid me live. 'Tis not great, what I solicit; Was it more, thou couldst not miss it: Now the cutting winter's come, 'Tis but just to find a home, In some shelter, dry and warm, That will shield me from the storm. Toiling in the naked fields, Where no bush a shelter yields, Needy Labour dithering stands, Beats and blows his numbing hands; And upon the crumping snows Stamps, in vain, to warm his toes. Leaves are fled, that once had power To resist a summer shower; And the wind so piercing blows, Winnowing small the drifting snows, The summer shade of loaded bough Would vainly boast a shelter now; Piercing snows so searching fall, They sift a passage through them all. Though all's vain to keep him warm, Poverty must brave the storm. Friendship none, its aid to lend; Health alone his only friend, Granting leave to live in pain, Giving strength to toil in vain, To be, while winter's horrors last, The sport of every pelting blast. Oh, sad sons of Poverty! Victims doom'd to misery; Who can paint what pain prevails O'er that heart which want assails? Modest shame the pain conceals; No one knows, but he who feels. Oh, thou charm which Plenty crowns, Fortune! smile, now winter frowns: Cast around a pitying eye; Feed the hungry, ere they die. Think, oh! think upon the poor, Nor against them shut thy door; Freely let thy bounty flow On the sons of want and woe. Hills and dales no more are seen In their dress of pleasing green; Summer's robes are all thrown by, For the clothing of the sky; Snows on snows in heaps combine, Hillocks, rais'd as mountains, shine, And at distance rising proud, Each appears a fleecy cloud. Plenty! now thy gifts bestow; Exit bid to every woe; Take me in, shut out the blast, Make the doors and windows fast; Place me in some corner, where, Lolling in an elbow chair, Happy, blest to my desire, I may find a rousing fire; While in chimney-corner nigh, Coal, or wood, a fresh supply, Ready stands for laying on, Soon as t'other's burnt and gone. Now and then, as taste decreed, In a book a page I'd read; And, inquiry to amuse, Peep at something in the news; See who's married, and who's dead, And who, though bankrupt, beg their bread: While on hob, or table nigh, Just to drink before I'm dry, A pitcher at my side should stand, With the barrel nigh at hand, Always ready as I will'd, When 'twas empty, to be fill'd; And, to be possess'd of all, A corner cupboard in the wall, With store of victuals lin'd complete, That when hungry I might eat. Then would I, in Plenty's lap, For the first time take a nap; Falling back in easy lair, Sweetly slumb'ring in my chair, With no reflective thoughts to wake Pains that cause my heart to ache, Of contracted debts, long made, In no prospect to be paid, And, to want, sad news severe, Of provisions getting dear: While the winter, shocking sight, Constant freezes day and night, Deep and deeper falls the snow, Labour's slack, and wages low. These, and more, the poor can tell, Known, alas, by them too well, Plenty! oh, if blest by thee, Never more should trouble me. Hours and weeks will sweetly glide, Soft and smooth as flows the tide, Where no stones or choking grass Force a curve ere it can pass: And as happy, and as blest, As beasts drop them down to rest, When in pastures, at their will, They have roam'd and eat their fill, Soft as nights in summer creep, So should I then fall asleep; While sweet visions of delight, So enchanting to the sight, Sweetly swimming o'er my eyes, Would sink me into ecstasies, Nor would pleasure's dreams once more, As they oft have done before, Cause be to create a pain, When I woke, to find them vain: Bitter past, the present sweet, Would my happiness complete. Oh! how easy should I lie, With the fire up-blazing high (Summer's artificial bloom), That like an oven keeps the room, Or lovely May, as mild and warm: While, without, the raging storm Is roaring in the chimney-top, In no likelihood to drop; And the witchen-branches nigh, O'er my snug box towering high, That sweet shelter'd stands beneath, In convulsive eddies wreathe. Then while, tyrant-like, the storm Takes delight in doing harm, Down before him crushing all, Till his weapons useless fall; And as in oppression proud Peal his howlings long and loud, While the clouds, with horrid sweep, Give (as suits a tyrant's trade) The sun a minute's leave to peep, To smile upon the ruins made; And to make complete the blast, While the hail comes hard and fast, Rattling loud against the glass; And the snowy sleets, that pass, Driving up in heaps remain Close adhering to the pane, Stop the light, and spread a gloom, Suiting sleep, around the room: Oh, how blest 'mid these alarms, I should bask in Fortune's arms, Who, defying every frown, Hugs me on her downy breast, Bids my head lie easy down, And on winter's ruins rest. So upon the troubled sea, Emblematic simile, Birds are known to sit secure, While the billows roar and rave, Slumbering in their safety sure, Rock'd to sleep upon the wave, So would I still slumber on, Till hour-telling clocks had gone, And, from the contracted day, One or more had click'd away. Then with sitting wearied out, I for change's sake, no doubt, Just might wish to leave my seat, And, to exercise my feet, Make a journey to the door, Put my nose out, but no more; There to village taste agree, Mark how times are like to be, How the weather's getting on, Peep in ruts where carts have gone. Or, by stones, a sturdy stroke, View the hole the boys have broke, Crizzling, still inclin'd to freeze; And the rime upon the trees. Then, to pause on ills to come, Just look upward on the gloom; See fresh storms approaching fast, View them busy in the air, Boiling up the brewing blast, Still fresh horrors scheming there. Black and dismal, rising high From the north, they fright the eye: Pregnant with a thousand storms Huddled in their icy arms, Heavy hovering as they come, Some as mountains seemâand some Jagg'd as craggy rocks appear Dismally advancing near; Earth unable seems to bear The huge mass that's moving there. Fancy, at the cumbrous sight, Chills and shudders with affright, Fearing lest the air in vain Strives her station to maintain, And wearied, yielding to the skies, The world beneath in ruin lies. So may Fancy think and feign; Fancy oft imagines vain; Nature's laws, by wisdom penn'd, Mortals cannot comprehend; Power Almighty Being gave, Endless Mercy stoops to save; Causes, hid from mortals' sight, Prove âwhatever is, is right.â Then to look again below, Labour's former life I'd view, Who, still beating through the snow, Spite of storms their toils pursue, Forc'd out by sad necessity, That sad fiend that forces me. Troubles, then no more my own, Which I but too long had known, Might create a care, a pain; Then I'd seek my joys again, Pile the fire up, fetch a drink, Then sit down again and think; Pause on all my sorrows past, Think how many a bitter blast, When it snow'd, and hail'd, and blew, I have toil'd and batter'd through, And how many a lengthen'd day, Half the night as one may say, Weary lowking in a barn, Humble twenty pence to earn. Then to ease reflective pain, To my sports I'd fall again, Till the clock had counted ten, When I'd seek my downy bed, Easy, happy, and well fed. Then might peep the morn, in vain, Through the rimy misted pane; Then might bawl the restless cock, And the loud-tongued village clock; And the flail might lump away, Waking soon the dreary day: They should never waken me, Independent, blest, and free; Nor, as usual, make me start, Yawning sigh with heavy heart, Loath to ope my sleepy eyes, Weary still, in pain to rise, With aching bones and heavy head, Worse than when I went to bed. With nothing then to raise a sigh, Oh, how happy should I lie Till the clock was eight, or more, Then proceed as heretofore. Best of blessings! sweetest charm! Boon these wishes while they're warm; My fairy visions ne'er despise; As reason thinks, thou realize: Depress'd with want and poverty, I sink, I fall, denied by thee. A SUNSET Ah, just as well as if but yesternight I do remember on that self-same hill I dropt me down with exquisite delight; The very hawthorn bush is standing still From whence I sought a twig of blooming may And stuck it to my bosom when at rest. Oh, 'twas a lovely eve; the lambs at play Scampt round and round the hill, and in the west The clouds of purple and of crimson dye Were huddled up together in a heap, And o'er the scented wide world's edge did lie Resting as quiet as if lulled to sleep. I gazed upon them with a wishing eye, And longed but vainly for the painter's power To give existence to the mingling dye And snatch a beauty from an evening hour. But soft and soft it lost itself in night, And changed and changed in many a lumined track; I felt concerned to see it leave the sight And hide its lovely face in blanking black. ON CRUELTY Compassion sighs, and feels, and weeps, Retracing every pain Inhuman man, in vengeance, heaps On all the lower train. Ah, Pity! oft thy heart has bled, As galling now it bleeds; And tender tears thy eyes have shed To witness cruel deeds. The lash that weal'd poor Dobbin's hide, The strokes that cracking fall On dogs, dumb cringing by thy sideâ Ah! thou hast felt them all. The burthen'd asses, 'mid the laugh To see them whipp'd, would move Thy soul to breathe in their behalf Humanity and love. E'en 'plaining flies to thee have spoke, Poor trifles as they be; And oft the spider's web thou'st broke, To set the captive free. The pilfering mouse, entrapp'd and cag'd Within the wiry grate, Thy pleading powers has oft engag'd To mourn its rigid fate. How beat thy breast with conscious woes, To see the sparrows die: Poor little thieves of many foes, Their food they dearly buy. Where nature groans, where nature cries Beneath the butcher's knife, How vain, how many were thy sighs, To save such guiltless life. And ah! that most inhuman plan, Where reason's name's ador'd, Unfriendly treatment man to man Thy tears have oft deplor'd. Nor wise nor good shall e'er deride The tear in Pity's eye; Though laugh'd to scorn by senseless pride, From them it meets a sigh. CRAZY NELL A TRUE STORY The sun was low sinking behind the far trees, And, crossing the path, humming home were the bees; And darker and darker it grew by degrees, And crows they flock'd quawking to rest: When, unknown to her parents, Nell slove on her hat, And o'er the fields hurriedâscarce knew she for what; But her sweetheart, in taking advantage and that, Had kiss'd, and had promis'd the best. Poor maidens! of husbands so much they conceit, The daisy scarce touch'd rose unhurt from her feet, So eager she hasten'd her lover to meet, As to make him to wait was unjust; On the wood, dim discover'd, she fixed her eyesâ Such a queer spot to meet inâsuspicions might rise; But the fond word âa sweetheartâ such goodness implies, Ah, who would a lover distrust! More gloomy and darkerâblack clouds hung the wind, Far objects diminish'd before and behind, More narrow and narrow the circle declin'd, And silence reign'd awfully round, When Nelly within the wood-riding sat down; She listen'd, and lapp'd up her arms in her gown; Far, far from her cottage, and far from the town, And her sweetheart not yet to be found. The minutes seem'd hoursâwith impatience she heard The flap of a leaf, and the twit of a bird; The least little trifle that whisper'd or stirr'd, Hope pictur'd her lover as nigh: When wearied with sitting, she wander'd about, And open'd the wood-gate, and gave a look out; And fain would have halloo'd, but fear had a doubt That thieves might be lurking hard by. Far clocks count elevenââHe won't be long now,â Her anxious hopes whisper'dâhoarse wav'd the wood bough; ââHe heeds not my fears, or he's false to his vow!â Poor Nelly sat doubtful, and sigh'd: The man who had promis'd her husband to be, And to wed on the morrowâher friends all could see That a good-for-naught sort of a fellow was he, And they hoped nothing worse might betide. At length, as in fear, slowly tapp'd the wood-gate; 'Twas Ben!âshe complain'd so long painful to wait: Deep design hung his looks, he but mumbled, â'Tis late,â And pass'd her, and bid her come on. The mind plainly pictures that night-hour of dread, In the midst of a wood! where the trees overhead The darkness increasedâa dungeon they spread, And the clock at the moment toll'd one! Nell fain would have forc'd, as she follow'd, some chat, And trifled, on purpose, with this thing and that, And complain'd of the dew-droppings spoiling her hat; But nothing Ben's silence would break. Extensive the forest, the roads to and fro, And this way and that way, above and below, As crossing the ridings, as winding they goâ âAh! what road or way can he seek?â Her eye, ever watchful, now caught an alarm; Lights gleam, and tools tinkle, as if nigh a farm: âOh, don't walk so fast, BenâI'm fearful of harm! She said, and shrugg'd closer behind. âThat light's from my house!â 'twas the first word she caught From his lips, since he through the dark wood had her brought. A house in a wood! Oh, good God! what a thought; What sensations then rush'd on her mind! The things which her friends and her neighbours had said Afresh at that moment all jump'd in her head; And mistrust, for the first time, now fill'd her with dread: And as she approach'd, she could see How better, for her, their advice to have ta'en; And she wish'd to herself then she hadâbut in vain: âA heap of fresh mould, and a spade, she saw plain, And a lantern tied up to a tree. âHere they come!â a voice whispers;ââHaste! put out the light.â âNo: dig the grave deeper!âââVery dark is the night.â Slow mutterings mingled.âOh, dismal the sight! âThe fate of poor Nelly was plain. Fear chill'd through her heartâbut Hope whisper'd herâFly! Chance seiz'd on the moment, a wind-gust blew high, She slipt in the thicketâhe turn'd not his eye, And the grave-diggers waited in vain. At that fearful moment, so dreadfully dark, How welcome the song of the shepherd, or lark; How cheery to listen, and hear the dog bark, As through the dark wood she fled fast: But, horror of horrors, all nature was hush! Not a sound was there heardâsave a blackbird, or thrush, That, started from sleep, flusker'd out of the bush, Which her brushing clothes shook as they past. Fear now truly pictur'd: she ne'er turn'd her head Either this way or that wayâstraight forward she fled; And Fancy, still hearing the horrors with dread, On faster and fearfuller stole. The matted leaves rustleâthe boughs swiftly part, Her hands and her face with the brambles did smart; But, oh! the worst anguish was felt at her heartâ Ben's unkindness struck death to her soul. Now glimmering lighter the forest appears, And Hope, the sweet comforter, soften'd her fears; Light and liberty, Darkness! thy horror endears; Great bliss did the omen impart: The forest, its end, and its terrors gone by, She breath'd the free air, and she saw the blue sky; Her own fields she knewâto her home did she fly, And great was the joy of her heart. Oh, prospect endearing! the village to view, The morn sweet appearing,âand gay the cock crew, When, mangled by brambles and dabbled in dew, She gave a loud rap at the door: The parents in raptures wept over their child; She mutter'd her terrorsâher eyes rolled wildâ âThey dig the grave deeper!âYour Nelly's beguil'd!â She said, and she siled on the floor. Poor Nell soon recover'd; but, ah! to her cost, Her sense and her reason for ever were lost: And scorch'd by the summer, and chill'd by the frost, A maniac, restless and wild, Now crazy Nell rambles; and still she will weep, And, fearless, at night into hovels will creep. Fond parents! alas, their affliction is deep, And vainly they comfort their child. A SCENE The landskip's stretching view, that opens wide, With dribbling brooks, and river's wider floods, And hills, and vales, and darksome lowering woods, With grains of varied hues and grasses pied; The low brown cottage in the shelter'd nook; The steeple, perking just above the trees Whose dangling leaves keep rustling in the breeze; And thoughtful shepherd bending o'er his hook; And maidens stript, haymaking too, appear; And Hodge a-whistling at his fallow plough; And herdsman hallooing to intruding cow: All these, with hundreds more, far off and near, Approach my sight; and please to such excess, That language fails the pleasure to express. TO RELIGION Thou sacred light, that right from wrong discerns; Thou safeguard of the soul, thou heaven on earth; Thou undervaluer of the world's concerns; Thou disregarder of its joys and mirth; Thou only home the houseless wanderers have; Thou prop by which the pilgrim's woes are borne; Thou solace of the lonely hermit's cave, That beds him down to rest on fate's sharp thorn; Thou only hope to sorrow's bosom given; Thou voice of mercy when the weary call; Thou faith extending to thy home in heaven; Thou peace, thou rest, thou comfort, all in all: O sovereign good! on thee all hopes depend, Till thy grand source unfolds its realizing end. TO MY MOTHER With filial duty I address thee, Mother, Thou dearest tie which this world's wealth possesses; Endearing name! no language owns another That half the tenderness and love expresses; The very word itself breathes the affection, Which heaves the bosom of a luckless child To thank thee, for that care and that protection, Which once, where fortune frowns, so sweetly smil'd. Ah, oft fond memory leaves its pillow'd anguish, To think when in thy arms my sleep was sound; And now my startled tear oft views thee languish, And fain would drop its honey in the wound: But I am doom'd the sad reverse to see, Where the worst pain I feel is loss of helping thee. HOLYWELL Nature, thou accept the song, To thee the simple lines belong, Inspir'd as brushing hill and dell I stroll'd the way to Holywell. Though 'neath young April's watery sky, The sun gleam'd warm, and roads were dry; And though the valleys, bush, and tree Still naked stood, yet on the lea A flush of green, and fresh'ning glow, In melting patches 'gan to show That swelling buds would soon again In summer's livery bless the plain. The thrushes too 'gan clear their throats, And got by heart some two'r three notes Of their intended summer-song, To cheer me as I stroll'd along. The wild heath triumph'd in its scenes Of goss and ling's perpetual greens; And just to say that spring was come, The violet left its woodland home, And, hermit-like, from storms and wind Sought the best shelter it could find, 'Neath long grass banks, with feeble powers Peeping faintly purple flowers: While oft unhous'd from beds of ling The fluskering pheasant took to wing, And bobbing rabbits, wild and shy, Their white tails glancing on the eye, Just prick'd their long ears list'ning round, And sought their coverts underground. The heath was left, and then at will A road swept gently round the hill, From whose high crown, as soodling by, A distant prospect cheer'd my eye, Of closes green and fallows brown, And distant glimpse of cot and town, And steeple beck'ning on the sight, By morning sunbeams painted white, And darksome woods with shadings sweet, To make the landscape round complete, And distant waters glist'ning by, As if the ground were patch'd with sky; While on the blue horizon's line The far-off things did dimly shine, Which wild conjecture only sees, And fancy moulds to clouds and trees, Thinking, if thither she could fly, She'd find the close of earth and sky; But as we turn to look again On nearest objects, wood and plain, (So truths than fiction lovelier seem), One warms as wak'ning from a dream. From covert hedge, on either side, The blackbirds flutter'd terrified, Mistaking me for pilfering boy That doth too oft their nests destroy; And âprink, prink, prink,â they took to wing, In snugger shades to build and sing. From tufted grass or bush, the hare Oft sprung from her endanger'd lair; Surprise was startled on her rout, So near one's feet she bolted out. The sun each tree-top mounted o'er, And got church-steeple height or more: And as I soodled on and on, The ground was warm to look upon, It e'en invited one to rest, And have a nap upon its breast: But thought upon my journey's end, Where doubtful fancies did depend, Urg'd on my lazy feet to roam, Like truant school-boy kept from home, I oped each gate with idle swing, And stood to listen ploughmen sing; While cracking whip and jingling gears Recall'd the toils of boyish years, When, like to them, I took my rounds O'er elting moulds of fallow groundsâ With feet nigh shoeless, paddling through The bitterest blasts that ever blew, And napless beaver, weather'd brown, That want oft wore without its crown: A poor, unfriended, ragged boy, Prest ere a child with man's employ. 'Tis pastâ'tis gone!âin musings lost So thought I, leaning o'er the post; And even jump'd with joy to see Kind fate so highly favour meâ To clear the storms of boyish hours, And manhood's opening strew with flowers; To bid such hopes man's summer blow, As boy's weak spring dare never sow; And every day desires, at will, To make each hope bloom brighter still. With joys as sweet as heart could melt, With feelings dear as e'er were felt, I met at last, as like a spell, The 'witching views of Holywell; Where hills tower'd high their crowns with pride, And vales dropp'd headlong by their side, Bestriped with shades of green and gray, The firdale and the naked spray; While, underneath their mingling grains, The river silver'd down the plains, And bolted on the stranger's sight, As stars blink out from clouds at night. Beside the stream a cotter's shed Low in the hollow heav'd its head: Its tenants seem'd as snug to dwell As lives a bee within its cell; Its chimney-top high ash embowers; Beside its wall the river pours Its guggling sounds in whirling sweep, That e'en might lull a child to sleep. Before the door, untrod wi' pads, The greensward many a beauty adds; And daisy there, and cowslip too, And buttercups of golden hue, The children meet as soon as sought, And gain their wish as soon as thought; Who oft, I ween, the children's way, Will leap the threshold's bounds to play, And spite of parents' chiding calls Will straggle where the water falls, And 'neath the hanging bushes creep For violet-bud and primrose-peep, And sigh with anxious, eager dream, For water-blobs amid the stream; And up the hill-side turn anon, To pick the daisies one by one: Then anxious to their cottage bound, To show the prize their searches found, Whose medley flowers, red, white, and blue, As well can please their parents too; And as their care and skill contrive, In flower-pots many a day survive. Ah, thus conjecturing, musing still, I cast a look from off the hill, And loll'd me 'gainst a propping tree, And thought for them as 'twas with me: I did the same in April time, And spoilt the daisy's earliest prime, Robb'd every primrose root I met, And oft-times got the root to set, And joyful home each nosegay bore, And feltâas I shall feel no more. SOLITUDE Now as even's warning bell Rings the day's departing knell, Leaving me from labour free, Solitude, I'll walk with thee: Whether 'side the woods we rove, Or sweep beneath the willow grove; Whether sauntering we proceed 'Cross the green, or down the mead; Whether, sitting down, we look On the bubbles of the brook; Whether, curious, waste an hour, Pausing o'er each tasty flower; Or, expounding nature's spells, From the sand pick out the shells; Or, while lingering by the streams, Where more sweet the music seems, Listen to the soft'ning swells Of some distant chiming bells Mellowing sweetly on the breeze, Rising, falling by degrees, Dying now, then wak'd again In full many a 'witching strain, Sounding, as the gale flits by, Flats and sharps of melody. Sweet it is to wind the rill, Sweet with thee to climb the hill, On whose lap the bullock free Chews his cud most placidly; Or o'er fallows bare and brown Beaten sheep-tracks wander down, Where the mole unwearied still Roots up many a crumbling hill, And the little chumbling mouse Gnarls the dead weed for her house, While the plough's unfeeling share Lays full many a dwelling bare; Where the lark with russet breast 'Hind the big clod hides her nest, And the black snail's founder'd pace Finds from noon a hiding-place, Breaking off the scorching sun Where the matted twitches run. Solitude! I love thee well, Brushing through the wilder'd dell, Picking from the ramping grass Nameless blossoms as I pass, Which the dews of eve bedeck, Fair as pearls on woman's neck; Marking shepherds rous'd from sleep Blundering off to fold their sheep, And the swain, with toils distrest, Hide his tools to seek his rest: While the cows, with hobbling strides, Twitching slow their fly-bit hides, Rub the pasture's creaking gate, Milking maids and boys to wait. Or as sunshine leaves the sky, As the daylight shuts her eye, Sweet it is to meet the breeze 'Neath the shade of hawthorn trees, By the pasture's wilder'd round, Where the pismire hills abound, Where the blushing fin-weed's flower Closes up at even's hour: Leaving then the green behind, Narrow hoof-plod lanes to wind, Oak and ash embower'd beneath, Leading to the lonely heath, Where the unmolested furze And the burdock's clinging burs, And the briers, by freedom sown, Claim the wilder'd spots their own. There while we the scene survey Deck'd in nature's wild array, Swell'd with ling-clad hillocks green Suiting the disorder'd scene, Haply we may rest us then In the banish'd herdsman's den; Where the wattled hulk is fixt, Propt some double oak betwixt, Where the swain the branches lops, And o'erhead with rushes tops; Where, with woodbine's sweet perfume, And the rose's blushing bloom, Loveliest ceiling of the bower, Arching in, peeps many a flower; While a hill of thyme so sweet, Or a moss'd stone, forms a seat. There, as 'tween-light hangs the eve, I will watch thy bosom heave; Marking then the darksome flows Night's gloom o'er thy mantle throws; Fondly gazing on thine eye As it rolls its ecstasy, When thy solemn musings caught Tell thy soul's absorb'd in thought; When thy finely folded arm O'er thy bosom beating warm Wraps thee melancholy round; And thy ringlets wild unbound On thy lily shoulders lie, Like dark streaks in morning's sky. Peace and silence sit with thee, And peace alone is heaven to me: While the moonlight's infant hour Faint 'gins creep to gild the bower, And the wattled hedge gleams round Its diamond shadows on the ground. Oh, thou soothing Solitude, From the vain and from the rude, When this silent hour is come, And I meet thy welcome home, What balm is thine to troubles deep, As on thy breast I sink to sleep; What bliss on even's silence flows, When thy wish'd opiate brings repose. And I have found thee wondrous sweet, Sheltering from the noon-day heat, As 'neath hazels I have stood In the gloomy hanging wood, Where the sunbeams, filtering small, Freckling through the branches fall; And the flapping leaf the ground Shadows, flitting round and round: Where the glimmering streamlets wreathe Many a crooked root beneath, Unseen gliding day by day O'er their solitary way, Smooth or rough, as onward led Where the wild-weed dips its head, Murmuringâdribbling drop by drop When dead leaves their progress stopâ Or winding sweet their restless way While the frothy bubbles play. And I love thy presence drear In such wildernesses, where Ne'er an axe was heard to sound, Or a tree's fall gulsh'd the ground, Where (as if that spot could be) First foot-mark'd the ground by me, All is still, and wild, and gay, Left as at creation's day. Pleasant too it is to look For thy steps in shady nook, Where, by hedge-side coolly led, Brooks curl o'er their sandy bed, On whose tide the clouds reflect, In whose margin flags are freckt; Where the waters, winding blue, Single-arch'd brig flutter through, While the willow-branches grey Damp the sultry eye of day, And in whispers mildly sooth Chafe the mossy keystone smooth; Where the banks, beneath them spread, Level in an easy bed; While the wild-thyme's pinky bells Circulate reviving smells; And the breeze, with feather-feet, Crimping o'er the waters sweet, Trembling fans the sun-tann'd cheek, And gives the comfort one would seek. Stretching there in soft repose, Far from peace and freedom's foes, In a spot, so wild, so rude, Dear to me is solitude! Soothing then to watch the groundâ Every insect flitting round, Such as painted summer bringsâ Lady-fly with freckled wings, Watch her up the tall bent climb; And from knotted flowers of thyme, Where the woodland banks are deckt, See the bee his load collect; Mark him turn the petals by, Gold dust gathering on his thigh, As full many a hum he heaves, While he pats th'intruding leaves, Lost in many a heedless spring, Then wearing home on heavy wing. But when sorrows more oppress, When the world brings more distress, Wishing to despise as then Brunts of fate, and scorn of men; When fate's demons thus intrude, Then I seek thee, Solitude, Where the abbey's height appears Hoary 'neath a weight of years; Where the mouldering walls are seen Hung with pellitory green; Where the steeple's taper stretch Tires the eye its length to reach, Dizzy, nauntling high and proud, Top-stone losing in a cloud; Where the cross, to time resign'd, Creaking harshly in the wind, Crowning high the rifted dome, Points the pilgrim's wish'd-for home; While the look fear turns away, Shuddering at its dread decay. There let me my peace pursue 'Neath the shades of gloomy yew, Doleful hung with mourning green, Suiting well the solemn scene; There, that I may learn to scan Mites illustrious, called man, Turn with thee the nettles by Where the grave-stone meets the eye, Soon, full soon to read and see That all below is vanity; And man, to me a galling thing, Own'd creation's lord and king, A minute's length, a zephyr's breath, Sport of fate, and prey of death, Tyrant to-day, to-morrow gone, Distinguish'd only by a stone, That fain would have the eye to know Pride's better dust is lodg'd belowâ While worms like me are mouldering laid, With nothing set to say âthey're deadââ All the difference, trifling thing, That notes at last the slave and king. As wither'd leaves, life's bloom when stopt, That drop in autumn, so they dropt; As snails, which in their painted shell So snugly once were known to dwell, When in the schoolboy's care we view The pleasing toys of varied hue, By age or accident are flown, The shell left empty, tenant goneâ So pass we from the world's affairs, And careless vanish from its cares; So leave, with silent, long farewell, Vain lifeâas left the snail his shell. All this when there my eyes behold On every stone and heap of mould, Solitude, though thou art sweet, Solemn art thou then to meet; When with list'ning pause I look Round the pillar's ruin'd nook; Glooms revealing, dim descried, Ghosts, companion'd by thy side; Where in old deformity Ancient arches sweep on high, And the aisles, to light unknown, Create a darkness all their own; Save the moon, as on we pass, Splinters through the broken glass, Or the torn roof, patch'd with cloud, Or the crack'd wall, bulg'd and bow'dâ Glimmering faint along the ground, Shooting solemn and profound, Lighting up the silent gloom Just to read an ancient tomb, 'Neath where, as it gliding creeps We may see some abbot sleeps; And as on we mete the aisle, Daring scarce to breathe the while Soft as creeping feet can fall, While the damp green-stained wall Swift the startled ghost flits by, Mocking murmurs faintly sigh, Reminding our intruding fear Such visits are unwelcome here. Seemly then, from hollow urn, Gentle steps our steps return; E'er so soft and e'er so still, Check our breath or how we will, List'ning spirits still reply Step for step, and sigh for sigh, Murmuring o'er one's weary woe, Such as once 'twas theirs to know, They whisper to such slaves as me, A buried tale of misery: âWe once had life, ere life's decline, Flesh, blood, and bones, the same as thine; We knew its pains, and shar'd its grief, Till death, long wish'd-for, brought relief; We had our hopes, and like to thee, Hoped morrow's better day to see, But like to thine, our hope the same, To-morrow's kindness never came: We had our tyrants, e'en as thou; Our wants met many a scornful brow; But death laid low their wealthy powers, Their harmless ashes mix with ours: And this vain world, its pride, its form, That treads on thee as on a worm, Its mighty heirsâthe time shall be When they as quiet sleep by thee!â Oh, here's thy comfort, Solitude, When overpowering woes intrude! Then thy sad, thy solemn dress Owns the balm my soul to bless; Here I judge the world aright, Here see vain man in his true light, Learn patience, in this trying hour, To gild life's brambles with a flower, Take pattern from the hints thou'st given, And follow in thy steps to heaven. THE LAST OF MARCH WRITTEN AT LOLHAM BRIGS Though o'er the darksome northern hill Old ambush'd winter frowning flies, And faintly drifts his threatenings still In snowy sleet and blackening skies; Yet where the willow leaning lies And shields beneath the budding flower, Where banks to break the wind arise, 'Tis sweet to sit and spend an hour. Though floods of winter bustling fall Adown the arches bleak and blea, Though snow-storms clothe the mossy wall, And hourly whiten o'er the lea; Yet when from clouds the sun is free And warms the learning bird to sing, 'Neath sloping bank and sheltering tree 'Tis sweet to watch the creeping spring. Though still so early, one may spy And track her footsteps every hour; The daisy with its golden eye, And primrose bursting into flower; And snugly, where the thorny bower Keeps off the nipping frost and wind, Excluding all but sun and shower, There children early violets find. Here 'neath the shelving bank's retreat The horse-blob swells its golden ball; Nor fear the lady-smocks to meet The snows that round their blossoms fall: Here by the arch's ancient wall The antique eldern buds anew; Again the bulrush sprouting tall The water wrinkles, rippling through. As spring's warm herald April comes, As nature's sleep is nearly past, How sweet to hear the wakening hums Of aught beside the winter blast! Of feather'd minstrels first and last, The robin's song's again begun; And, as skies clear when overcast, Larks rise to hail the peeping sun. The stirtling peewits, as they pass, Scream joyous whizzing overhead, Right glad the fields and meadow grass Will quickly hide their careless shed: The rooks, where yonder witchens spread, Quawk clamorous to the spring's approach; Here silent, from its watery bed, To hail its coming, leaps the roach. While stalking o'er the fields again In stripp'd defiance to the storms, The hardy seedsman spread the grain, And all his hopeful toil performs: In flocks the timid pigeon swarms, For scatter'd kernels chance may spare; And as the plough unbeds the worms, The crows and magpies gather there. Yon bullocks low their liberty, The young grass cropping to their fill; And colts, from straw-yards neighing free, Spring's opening promise 'joy at will: Along the bank, beside the rill The happy lambkins bleat and run, Then weary, 'neath a sheltering hill Drop basking in the gleaming sun. At distance from the water's edge, On hanging sallow's farthest stretch, The moor-hen 'gins her nest of sedge Safe from destroying schoolboy's reach. Fen-sparrows chirp and fly to fetch The wither'd reed-down rustling nigh, And, by the sunny side the ditch, Prepare their dwelling warm and dry. Again a storm encroaches round, Thick clouds are darkening deep behind; And, through the arches, hoarsely sound The risings of the hollow wind: Spring's early hopes seem half resign'd, And silent for a while remain; Till sunbeams broken clouds can find, And brighten all to life again. Ere yet a hailstone pattering comes, Or dimps the pool the rainy squall, One hears, in mighty murmuring hums, The spirit of the tempest call: Here sheltering 'neath the ancient wall I still pursue my musing dreams, And as the hailstones round me fall I mark their bubbles in the streams. Reflection here is warm'd to sigh, Tradition gives these brigs renown, Though heedless Time long pass'd them by Nor thought them worthy noting down: Here in the mouth of every clown The âRoman roadâ familiar sounds; All else, with everlasting frown, Oblivion's mantling mist surrounds. These walls the work of Roman hands! How may conjecturing Fancy pore, As lonely here one calmly stands, On paths that age has trampled o'er. The builders' names are known no more; No spot on earth their memory bears; And crowds, reflecting thus before, Have since found graves as dark as theirs. The storm has ceas'dâagain the sun The ague-shivering season dries; Short-winded March, thou'lt soon be done, Thy fainting tempest mildly dies. Soon April's flowers and dappled skies Shall spread a couch for lovely May, Upon whose bosom Nature lies And smiles her joyous youth away. A LOOK AT THE HEAVENS Oh, who can witness with a careless eye The countless lamps that light an evening sky, And not be struck with wonder at the sight! To think what mighty Power must there abound, That burns each spangle with a steady light, And guides each hanging world its rolling round. What multitudes my misty eyes have found! The countless numbers speak a Deity: In numbers numberless the skies are crown'd, And still they're nothing which my sight can see, When science, searching through her aiding glass, In seeming blanks to me can millions trace; While millions more, that every heart impress, Still brighten up throughout eternal space. O Power Almighty! whence these beings shine, All wisdom's lost in comprehending thine. IN AUTUMN The fields all cleared, the labouring mice To sheltering hedge and wood patrol, Where hips and haws for food suffice That chumbled lie about the hole. And squirrel, bobbing from the eye, Is busy now about its hoard, And in old nest of crow and pie Its winter store is oft explored. The leaves now leave the willows grey And down the brook they wind: So hopes and pleasures whirl away And vanish from the mind. COUNTRY SWEETHEARTS âI'll ne'er walk at even grim When the night is glimpt wi' grey; When the light is waxing dim; Deeds are done at closing day. Ever sin' by blossom'd bean While the gnats were dancing by, Ye did on my bosom lean, Aye the tear's bin in my eye. âEver sinâ ye pass'd the morn When ye little dreamt a spy, Meeting Dolly 'hind the thorn, Aye the tear's bin in my eye. Ever sin' ye vow'd to wed, And I prov'd wi' heavy sigh Ye'd the vow to many made, Aye the tear's bin in my eye.â âSweet the tear shines on thee, love, Which I soon will wash away; Tenderness has won me, love, Fear thou not the even grey. Sin' we sat by beans in bloom, I have bin the ring to buy; Think no harm from that shall come, Wipe the tear from either eye.â MORNING Oh, now the crimson east, its fire-streak burning, Tempts me to wander 'neath the blushing morn, Winding the zig-zag lane, turning and turning, As winds the crooked fence's wilder'd thorn. Where is the eye can gaze upon the blushes, Unmov'd, with which yon cloudless heaven flushes? I cannot pass the very bramble, weeping 'Neath dewy tear-drops that its spears surround, Like harlot's mockery on the wan cheek creeping, Gilding the poison that is meant to woundâ I cannot pass the bent, ere gales have shaken Its transient crowning off, each point adorningâ But all the feelings of my soul awaken, To own the witcheries of most lovely morning. A LAIR AT NOON The hawthorn gently stopt the sun, beneath, The ash above its quiv'ring shadows spread, And downy bents, that to the air did wreathe, Bow'd 'neath my pressure in an easy bed; The water whirled round each stunted nook, And sweet the splashings on the ear did swim Of fly-bit cattle gulshing in the brook, Nibbling the grasses on the fountain's brim: The little minnows, driv'n from their retreat, Still sought the shelving bank to shun the heat, I fain had slept, but flies would buzz around; I fain had looked calmly on the scene, But the sweet snug retreat my search had found Waken'd the muse to sing the woody screen. TO THE MEMORY OF JOHN KEATS The world, its hopes, and fears, have pass'd away; No more its trifling thou shalt feel or see; Thy hopes are ripening in a brighter day, While these left buds thy monument shall be. When Rancour's aims have past in naught away, Enlarging specks discern'd in more than thee, And beauties 'minishing which few displayâ When these are past, true child of Poesy, Thou shalt survive. Ah, while a being dwells, With soul, in nature's joys, to warm like thine, With eye to view her fascinating spells, And dream entranced o'er each form divine, Thy worth, Enthusiast, shall be cherish'd here, Thy name with him shall linger, and be dear. FEBRUARY The snow has left the cottage top; The thatch-moss grows in brighter green; And eaves in quick succession drop, Where grinning icicles have been, Pit-patting with a pleasant noise In tubs set by the cottage-door; While ducks and geese, with happy joys, Plunge in the yard-pond brimming o'er. The sun peeps through the window-pane; Which children mark with laughing eye, And in the wet street steal again To tell each other spring is nigh: Then, as young hope the past recalls, In playing groups they often draw, To build beside the sunny walls Their spring-time huts of sticks or straw. And oft in pleasure's dreams they hie Round homesteads by the village side, Scratching the hedgerow mosses by, Where painted pooty shells abide, Mistaking oft the ivy spray For leaves that come with budding spring, And wond'ring, in their search for play, Why birds delay to build and sing. The milkmaid singing leaves her bed, As glad as happy thoughts can be, While magpies chatter o'er her head As jocund in the change as she: Her cows around the closes stray, Nor ling'ring wait the foddering-boy, Tossing the molehills in their play, And staring round with frolic joy. The shepherd now is often seen Near warm banks o'er his hook to bend, Or o'er a gate or stile to lean, Chattering to a passing friend: Ploughmen go whistling to their toils, And yoke again the rested plough; And, mingling o'er the mellow soils, Boys shout, and whips are noising now. The barking dogs, by lane and wood, Drive sheep afield from foddering ground; And Echo, in her summer mood, Briskly mocks the cheering sound. The flocks, as from a prison broke, Shake their wet fleeces in the sun, While, following fast, a misty smoke Reeks from the moist grass as they run. No more behind his master's heels The dog creeps on his winter-pace; But cocks his tail, and o'er the fields Runs many a wild and random chase, Following, in spite of chiding calls, The startled cat with harmless glee, Scaring her up the weed-green walls, Or mossy mottled apple-tree. As crows from morning perches fly, He barks and follows them in vain; E'en larks will catch his nimble eye, And off he starts and barks again, With breathless haste and blinded guess, Oft following where the hare hath gone, Forgetting, in his joy's excess, His frolic puppy-days are done. The hedgehog, from his hollow root, Sees the wood-moss clear of snow, And hunts the hedge for fallen fruitâ Crab, hip, and winter-bitten sloe; But often check'd by sudden fears, As shepherd-dog his haunt espies, He rolls up in a ball of spears, And all his barking rage defies. The gladden'd swine bolt from the sty, And round the yard in freedom run, Or stretching in their slumbers lie Beside the cottage in the sun. The young horse whinnies to his mate, And, sickening from the thresher's door, Rubs at the straw-yard's banded gate, Longing for freedom on the moor. The small birds think their wants are o'er, To see the snow-hills fret again, And, from the barn's chaff-litter'd door, Betake them to the greening plain. The woodman's robin startles coy, Nor longer to his elbow comes, To peck, with hunger's eager joy, 'Mong mossy stulps the litter'd crumbs. 'Neath hedge and walls that screen the wind, The gnats for play will flock together; And e'en poor flies some hope will find To venture in the mocking weather; From out their hiding-holes again, With feeble pace, they often creep Along the sun-warm'd window-pane, Like dreaming things that walk in sleep. The mavis thrush with wild delight, Upon the orchard's dripping tree, Mutters, to see the day so bright, Fragments of young Hope's poesy: And oft dame stops her buzzing wheel To hear the robin's note once more, Who tootles while he pecks his meal From sweetbrier hips beside the door. The sunbeams on the hedges lie, The south wind murmurs summer-soft; The maids hang out white clothes to dry Around the elder-skirted croft: A calm of pleasure listens round, And almost whispers winter by; While Fancy dreams of summer's sound, And quiet rapture fills the eye. Thus Nature of the spring will dream While south winds thaw; but soon again Frost breathes upon the stiff'ning stream, And numbs it into ice: the plain Soon wears its mourning garb of white; And icicles, that fret at noon, Will eke their icy tails at night Beneath the chilly stars and moon. Nature soon sickens of her joys, And all is sad and dumb again. Save merry shouts of sliding boys About the frozen furrow'd plain The foddering-boy forgets his song, And silent goes with folded arms; And croodling shepherds bend along, Crouching to the whizzing storms. APRIL Now infant April joins the spring, And views the watery sky, As youngling linnet tries its wing, And fears at first to fly; With timid step she ventures on, And hardly dares to smile, Till blossoms open one by one, And sunny hours beguile. But finer days are coming yet, With scenes more sweet to charm, And suns arrive that rise and set Bright strangers to a storm: Then, as the birds with louder song Each morning's glory cheer, With bolder step she speeds along, And loses all her fear. In wanton gambols, like a child, She tends her early toils, And seeks the buds along the wild, That blossoms while she smiles; Or, laughing on, with naught to chide, She races with the Hours, Or sports by Nature's lovely side, And fills her lap with flowers. The shepherd on his pasture walks The first fair cowslip finds, Whose tufted flowers, on slender stalks, Keep nodding to the winds. And though the thorns withhold the may, Their shades the violets bring, Which children stoop for in their play As tokens of the spring. Those joys which childhood calls its own, Would they were kin to men! Those treasures to the world unknown, When known, are wither'd then! But hovering round our growing years, To gild Care's sable shroud, Their spirit through the gloom appears As suns behind a cloud. Since thou didst meet my infant eyes, As through the fields I flew, Whose distance, where they meet the skies, Was all the world I knew; That warmth of fancy's wildest hours, Which fill'd all things with life, Which heard a voice in trees and flowers, Has swoon'd in reason's strife. Sweet month! thy pleasures bid thee be The fairest child of spring; And every hour, that comes with thee, Comes some new joy to bring: The trees still deepen in their bloom, Grass greens the meadow-lands, And flowers with every morning come, As dropt by fairy hands. The field and garden's lovely hours Begin and end with thee; For what's so sweet, as peeping flowers And bursting buds to see, What time the dew's unsullied drops, In burnish'd gold, distil On crocus flowers' unclosing tops, And drooping daffodil? To see thee come, all hearts rejoice; And, warm with feelings strong, With thee all Nature finds a voice, And hums a waking song. The lover views thy welcome hours, And thinks of summer come, And takes the maid the early flowers, To tempt her steps from home. Along each hedge and sprouting bush The singing birds are blest, And linnet green and speckled thrush Prepare their mossy nest; On the warm bed thy plains supply, The young lambs find repose, And mid thy green hills basking lie Like spots of ling'ring snows. Thy open'd leaves and ripen'd buds The cuckoo makes his choice, And shepherds in thy greening woods First hear his cheering voice: And to thy ripen'd blooming bowers The nightingale belongs, And, singing to thy parting hours, Keeps night awake with songs. With thee the swallow dares to come, And primes his sooty wing; And, urged to seek his yearly home, Thy suns the martin bring. O lovely month! be leisure mine Thy yearly mate to be; Though May-day scenes may brighter shine, Their birth belongs to thee. I waked me with thy rising sun, And thy first glories viewed, And, as thy welcome hours begun, Their sunny steps pursued. And now thy sun is on thee set, Like to a lovely eve, I view thy parting with regret, And linger loath to leave. Though at her birth the northern gale Come with its withering sigh, And hopeful blossoms, turning pale, Upon her bosom die, Ere April seeks another place, And ends her reign in this, She leaves us with as fair a face As e'er gave birth to bliss. NOVEMBER The landscape sleeps in mist from morn till noon; And, if the sun looks through, 'tis with a face Beamless and pale and round, as if the moon, When done the journey of her nightly race, Had found him sleeping, and supplied his place. For days the shepherds in the fields may be, Nor mark a patch of skyâblindfold they trace The plains, that seem without a bush or tree, Whistling aloud by guess to flocks they cannot see. The timid hare seems half its fears to lose, Crouching and sleeping 'neath its grassy lair, And scarcely startles, tho' the shepherd goes Close by its home, and dogs are barking there; The wild colt only turns around to stare At passer by, then knaps his hide again; And moody crows beside the road, forbear To fly, tho' pelted by the passing swain; Thus day seems turn'd to night, and tries to wake in vain. The owlet leaves her hiding-place at noon, And flaps her grey wings in the doubting light; The hoarse jay screams to see her out so soon, And small birds chirp and startle with affright; Much doth it scare the superstitious wight, Who dreams of sorry luck, and sore dismay; While cow-boys think the day a dream of night, And oft grow fearful on their lonely way, Fancying that ghosts may wake, and leave their graves by day. Yet but awhile the slumbering weather flings Its murky prison roundâthen winds wake loud; With sudden stir the startled forest sings Winter's returning songâcloud races cloud, And the horizon throws away its shroud, Sweeping a stretching circle from the eye; Storms upon storms in quick succession crowd, And o'er the sameness of the purple sky Heaven paints, with hurried hand, wild hues of every dye. At length it comes among the forest oaks, With sobbing ebbs, and uproar gathering high; The scared, hoarse raven on its cradle croaks, And stockdove-flocks in hurried terrors fly, While the blue hawk hangs o'er them in the sky. The hedger hastens from the storm begun, To seek a shelter that may keep him dry; And foresters, low bent the wind to shun, Scarce hear amid the strife the poacher's muttering gun. The ploughman hears its humming rage begin, And hies for shelter from his naked toil; Buttoning his doublet closer to his chin, He bends and scampers o'er the elting soil, While clouds above him in wild fury boil, And winds drive heavily the beating rain; He turns his back to catch his breath awhile, Then ekes his speed and faces it again, To seek the shepherd's hut beside the rushy plain. The boy, that scareth from the spiry wheat The melancholy crow, in hurry weaves, Beneath an ivied tree, his sheltering seat Of rushy flags and sedges tied in sheaves, Or from the field a shock of stubble thieves. There he doth dithering sit, and entertain His eyes with marking the storm-driven leaves; Oft spying nests where he spring eggs had ta'en, And wishing in his heart 'twas summer-time again. Thus wears the month along, in chequer'd moods, Sunshine and shadows, tempests loud and calms; One hour dies silent o'er the sleepy woods, The next wakes loud with unexpected storms; A dreary nakedness the field deformsâ Yet many a rural sound and rural sight Lives in the village still about the farms, Where toil's rude uproar hums from morn till night, Noises in which the ears of Industry delight. At length the stir of rural labour's still, And Industry her care awhile forgoes; When Winter comes in earnest to fulfil His yearly task, at bleak November's close, And stops the plough, and hides the field in snows; When frost locks up the stream in chill delay, And mellows on the hedge the jetty sloes For little birdsâthen Toil hath time for play, And naught but threshers' flails awake the dreary day. DECEMBER Glad Christmas comes, and every hearth Makes room to give him welcome now, E'en want will dry its tears in mirth, And crown him with a holly bough; Though tramping 'neath a winter sky, O'er snowy paths and rimy stiles, The housewife sets her spinning by To bid him welcome with her smiles. Each house is swept the day before, And windows stuck with evergreens, The snow is besom'd from the door, And comfort crowns the cottage scenes. Gilt holly, with its thorny pricks, And yew and box, with berries small, These deck the unused candlesticks, And pictures hanging by the wall. Neighbours resume their annual cheer, Wishing, with smiles and spirits high, Glad Christmas and a happy year To every morning passer-by; Milkmaids their Christmas journeys go, Accompanied with favour'd swain; And children pace the crumping snow, To taste their granny's cake again. The shepherd, now no more afraid, Since custom doth the chance bestow, Starts up to kiss the giggling maid Beneath the branch of misletoe That 'neath each cottage beam is seen, With pearl-like berries shining gay; The shadow still of what hath been, Which fashion yearly fades away. The singing waits, a merry throng, At early morn, with simple skill, Yet imitate the angels' song, And chant their Christmas ditty still; And, mid the storm that dies and swells By fits, in hummings softly steals The music of the village bells, Ringing round their merry peals. When this is past, a merry crew, Bedeck'd in masks and ribbons gay, The âMorris-dance,â their sports renew, And act their winter evening play. The clown turn'd king, for penny-praise, Storms with the actor's strut and swell; And Harlequin, a laugh to raise, Wears his hunchback and tinkling bell. And oft for pence and spicy ale, With winter nosegays pinn'd before, The wassail-singer tells her tale, And drawls her Christmas carols o'er. While prentice boy, with ruddy face, And rime-bepowder'd, dancing locks, From door to door with happy pace, Runs round to claim his âChristmas box.â The block upon the fire is put, To sanction custom's old desires; And many a faggot's bands are cut, For the old farmers' Christmas fires; Where loud-tongued Gladness joins the throng, And Winter meets the warmth of May, Till feeling soon the heat too strong, He rubs his shins, and draws away. While snows the window-panes bedim, The fire curls up a sunny charm, Where, creaming o'er the pitcher's rim, The flowering ale is set to warm; Mirth, full of joy as summer bees, Sits there, its pleasures to impart, And children, 'tween their parents' knees, Sing scraps of carols o'er by heart. And some, to view the winter weathers, Climb up the window-seat with glee, Likening the snow to falling feathers, In fancy's infant ecstasy; Laughing, with superstitious love, O'er visions wild that youth supplies, Of people pulling geese above, And keeping Christmas in the skies. As tho' the homestead trees were drest, In lieu of snow, with dancing leaves, As tho' the sun-dried martin's nest, Instead of ickles, hung the eaves, The children hail the happy dayâ As if the snow were April's grass, And pleas'd, as 'neath the warmth of May, Sport o'er the water froze to glass. Thou day of happy sound and mirth, That long with childish memory stays, How blest around the cottage hearth I met thee in my younger days! Harping, with rapture's dreaming joys, On presents which thy coming found, The welcome sight of little toys, The Christmas gift of cousins round: The wooden horse with arching head, Drawn upon wheels around the room, The gilded coach of gingerbread, And many-colour'd sugar-plum, Gilt-cover'd books for pictures sought, Or stories childhood loves to tell, With many an urgent promise bought, To get to-morrow's lesson well; And many a thing, a minute's sport, Left broken on the sanded floor, When we would leave our play, and court Our parents' promises for more. Tho' manhood bids such raptures die, And throws such toys aside as vain, Yet memory loves to turn her eye, And count past pleasures o'er again. Around the glowing hearth at night, The harmless laugh and winter tale Go round, while parting friends delight To toast each other o'er their ale; The cotter oft with quiet zeal Will musing o'er his Bible lean; While in the dark the lovers steal To kiss and toy behind the screen. Old customs! Oh! I love the sound, However simple they may be: Whate'er with time hath sanction found, Is welcome and is dear to me. Pride grows above simplicity, And spurns them from her haughty mind, And soon the poet's song will be The only refuge they can find. WANDERINGS IN JUNE The season now is all delight, Sweet smile the passing hours, And Summer's pleasures, at their height, Are sweet as are her flowers; The purple morning waken'd soon, The midday's gleaming din, Grey evening with her silver moon, Are sweet to mingle in. While waking doves betake to flight From off each roosting bough, While Nature's locks are wet with night, How sweet to wander now! Fast fade the vapours cool and grey, The red sun waxes strong, And streaks on labour's early way His shadows lank and long. Serenely sweet the Morning comes O'er the horizon's sweep, And calmly breaks the wakening hums Of Nature's nightly sleep. What rapture swells with every sound Of Morning's maiden hours! What healthful feelings breathe around! What freshness opes the flowers! Each tree and flower, in every hue And varied green, are spread, As fair and frail as drops the dew From off each blooming head; Like to that beauty which beguiles The eyes of wondering men, Led blushing to perfection's smiles And left to wither then. How strange a scene has come to pass Since Summer 'gan its reign! Spring flowers are buried in the grass, To sleep till spring again: Her dew-drops Evening still receives To gild the morning hours; But dew-drops fall on open'd leaves And moisten stranger-flowers. The artless daisies' smiling face My wanderings find no more; The kingcups that supplied their place, Their golden race is o'er; And clover bottles' ruddy bloom, That blossom where these fell, Ere autumn's fading mornings come Shall meet their grave as well. Life's every beauty fades away, And short its worldly race; Change leads us round its varied day, And strangers take our place: On summers past, how many eyes Have waken'd into bliss, That death's eclipsing hand denies To view the charms of this! The open flower, the loaded bough, The fields of spindling grain, Were blooming then the same as now, And so will bloom again: When with the past my being dies, Still summer suns shall shine, And other eyes shall see them rise When death has darkened mine. Reflection, with thy mortal shrouds When thou dost interfere, Though all is gay, what gloomy clouds Thy musings shadow here! To think of summers yet to come That I am not to see, To think a weed is yet to bloom From dust that I shall be! The misty clouds of purple hue Are fading from the eye, And ruddy streaks, which morning drew, Have left a dappled sky; The sun has call'd the bees abroad, Wet with the early hour, By toiling for the honey'd load Ere dews forsake the flower. O'er yonder hill, a dusty rout Wakes solitude from sleep; Shepherds have wattled pens about, To shear their bleating sheep; Less pleasing is the public way, Traced with awaken'd toil; And sweet are woods shut out from day, Where sunbeams never smile. The woodbines, fresh with morning hours, Are what I love to see; The ivy-spreading darksome bowers Is where I love to be: Left there, as when a boy, to lie And talk to flower and tree, And fancy, in my ecstasy, Their silence answers me. While some desire tumultuous joys, And shun what nature wears, Give me the choice which they despise, And I'll not sigh for theirs: The shady wild, the summer dreams Enjoying there at will, The whispering voice of woods and streams That breathe of Eden still. How sweet the fanning breeze is felt, Breathed through the dancing boughs! How sweet the rural noises melt From distant sheep and cows! The lovely green of wood and hill, The hummings in the air, Serenely in my breast instil The rapture reigning there. To me how sweet the whispering winds, The woods again how sweet, To find the peace which freedom finds, And from the world retreat; To stretch beneath a spreading tree, That far its shadow shoots, While by its side the water free Curls through its twisted roots. Such silence oft be mine to meet In leisure's musing hours; Oft be a fountain's brink my seatâ My partners, birds and flowers: No tumult here creates alarm, No pains our follies find; Peace visits us in every calm, Health breathes in every wind. Now cool the wood my wanderings shrouds, 'Neath arbours Nature weaves, Shut up from viewing fields and clouds, And buried deep in leaves; The sounds without amuse me still, Mixt with the sounds withinâ The scythe with sharpening tinkles shrill, The cuckoo's soothing din. The eye, no longer left to range, Is pent in narrowest bound, Yet Nature's works, unnamed and strange, My every step surround; Things small as dust, of every dye, That scarce the sight perceives, Some clad with wings fly droning by, Some climb the grass and leaves. And flowers these darksome woodlands rear, Whose shades they yearly claim, That Nature's wond'rous mystery wear, And bloom without a name: What different shapes in leaves are seen That o'er my head embower, Clad in as many shades of green As colours in the flower! My path now gleams with fairer light, The side approaches near, A heath now bolts upon the sight, And rabbit-tracks appear: I love the heath, though mid the brakes Fear shudders, trampling through, Oft check'd at things she fancies snakes Quick nestling from the view. Yet where the ground is nibbled bare By rabbits and by sheep, I often fearless loiter there, And think myself to sleep. Dear are the scenes which Nature loves, Where she untamed retires, Far from the stretch of planted groves Which polish'd taste admires. Here oft, though grass and moss are seen Tann'd brown for want of showers, Still keeps the ling its darksome green, Thick set with little flowers; And yonder, mingling o'er the heath, The furze delights to dwell, Whose blossoms steal the summer's breath, And shed a sultry smell. Here threat'ning ploughs have tried in vain To till the sandy soil; Yon slope, already sown with grain, Shows Nature mocks the toil; The wild weeds choke the straggling ears, And motley gardens spread; The blue-cap there in bloom appears, And poppies, lively red. But now my footsteps sidle round The gently sloping hill, Now falter over marshy ground, Yet Nature charms me still: Here moss, and grass, and flowers appear Of different forms and hues; And insects too inhabit here, Which still my wonder views. Here horsetail round the water's edge In bushy tufts is spread, With rush, and cutting leaves of sedge That children learn to dread; Its leaves, like razors, mingling there Oft make the youngster turn, Leaving his rushes in despair, A wounded hand to mourn. What wonders strike my idle gaze, As near the pond I stand! What life its stagnant depth displays, As varied as the land: All forms and sizes swimming there, Some, sheath'd in silvery den, Oft siling up as if for air, Then nimbling down agen. Now rising ground permits the plain To change the restless view, The pathways leading down the lane My pleasures still renew. The osier's slender shade is by, And bushes thickly spread; Again the ground is firm and dry, Nor trembles 'neath the tread. On this side, ash or oak embowers; There, hawthorns humbler grow, With goatsbeard wreath, and woodbine flowers, That shade a brook below, Which feebly purls its rippling moans With summer draining dry, Till struttles, as I step the stones, Can scarcely struggle by. Now soon shall end these musing dreams In solitude's retreat; The eye that dwelt on woods and streams The village soon shall meet: Nigh on the sight the steeple towers; The clock, with mellow hum, Counts out the day's declining hours, And calls my ramblings home. I love to visit Spring's young blooms When wet with April showers; Nor feel less joy, when Summer comes, To trace her darker bowers; I love to meet the Autumn winds Till they have mourn'd their last; Nor less delight my journey finds In Winter's howling blast. THE APPROACH OF SPRING Now once again, thou lovely Spring, Thy sight the day beguiles; For fresher greens the fairy ring, The daisy brighter smiles: The winds, that late with chiding voice Would fain thy stay prolong, Relent, while little birds rejoice, And mingle into song. Undaunted maiden, thou shalt find Thy home in gleaming woods, Thy mantle in the southern wind, Thy wreath in swelling buds: And may thy mantle wrap thee round, And hopes still warm and thrive, And dews with every morn be found To keep thy wreath alive. May coming suns, that tempt thy flowers, Smile on as they begin; And gentle be succeeding hours As those that bring thee in: Full lovely are thy dappled skies, Pearl'd round with promised showers, And sweet thy blossoms round thee rise To meet the sunny hours. The primrose bud, thy early pledge, Sprouts 'neath each woodland tree, And violets under every hedge Prepare a seat for thee: As maids just meeting woman's bloom Feel love's delicious strife, So Nature warms to find thee come, And kindles into life. Through hedgerow leaves, in drifted heaps Left by the stormy blast, The little hopeful blossom peeps, And tells of winter past; A few leaves flutter from the woods, That hung the season through, Leaving their place for swelling buds To spread their leaves anew. 'Mong wither'd grass upon the plain, That lent the blast a voice, The tender green appears again, And creeping things rejoice; Each warm bank shines with early flowers, Where oft a lonely bee Drones, venturing on in sunny hours, Its humming song to thee. The birds are busy on the wing, The fish play in the stream; And many a hasty curdled ring Crimps round the leaping bream; The buds unfold to leaves apace, Along the hedgerow bowers, And many a child with rosy face Is seeking after flowers. The soft wind fans the violet blue, Its opening sweets to share, And infant breezes, waked anew, Play in the maidens' hairâ Maidens that freshen with thy flowers, To charm the gentle swain, And dally, in their milking hours, With lovers' vows again. Bright dews illume the grassy plain, Sweet messengers of morn, And drops hang glistening after rain Like gems on every thorn; What though the grass is moist and rank Where dews fall from the tree, The creeping sun smiles on the bank And warms a seat for thee. The eager morning earlier wakes To glad thy fond desires, And oft its rosy bed forsakes Ere night's pale moon retires; Sweet shalt thou feel the morning sun To warm thy dewy breast, And chase the chill mist's purple dun That lingers in the west. Her dresses Nature gladly trims, To hail thee as her queen, And soon shall fold thy lovely limbs In modest garb of green: Each day shall like a lover come Some gifts with thee to share, And swarms of flowers shall quickly bloom To dress thy golden hair. All life and beauty warm and smile Thy lovely face to see, And many a hopeful hour beguile In seeking joys with thee: The sweetest hours that ever come Are those which thou dost bring, And sure the fairest flowers that bloom Are partners of the Spring. I've met the Winter's biting breath In Nature's wild retreat, When Silence listens as in death, And thought its wildness sweet; And I have loved the Winter's calm When frost has left the plain, When suns that morning waken'd warm Left eve to freeze again. I've heard in Autumn's early reign Her first, her gentlest song; I've mark'd her change o'er wood and plain, And wish'd her reign were long; Till winds, like armies, gather'd round, And stripp'd her colour'd woods, And storms urged on, with thunder-sound, Their desolating floods. And Summer's endless stretch of green, Spread over plain and tree, Sweet solace to my eyes has been, As it to all must be; Long I have stood his burning heat, And breathed the sultry day, And walk'd and toil'd with weary feet, Nor wish'd his pride away. But oft I've watch'd the greening buds Brush'd by the linnet's wing, When, like a child, the gladden'd woods First lisp the voice of Spring; When flowers, like dreams, peep every day, Reminding what they bring, I've watch'd them, and am warn'd to pay A preference to Spring. TO THE COWSLIP Once more, thou flower of childish fame, Thou meet'st the April wind; The selfsame flower, the very same As those I used to find. Thy peeps, tipt round with ruddy streak, Again attract mine eye, As they were those I used to seek Full twenty summers by. But I'm no more akin to thee, A partner of the spring; For time has had a hand with me, And left an alter'd thing: A thing that's lost thy golden hours, And all I witness'd then, Mix'd in a desert, far from flowers, Among the ways of men. Thy blooming pleasures, smiling, gay, The seasons still renew; But mine were doom'd a stinted stay, Ah, they were short and few! The every hour that hurried by, To eke the passing day, Lent restless pleasures wings to fly Till all were flown away. Blest flower! with spring thy joy's begun, And no false hopes are thine; One constant cheer of shower and sun Makes all thy stay divine. But my May-morning quickly fled, And dull its noon came onâ And happiness is past and dead Ere half that noon is gone. Ah! smile and bloom, thou lovely thing! Though May's sweet days are few, Still coming years thy flowers shall bring, And bid them bloom anew. Man's Life, that bears no kin to them, Past pleasures well may mourn: No bud clings to its withering stemâ No hope for Spring's return. THE LAST OF AUTUMN Come, bleak November, in thy wildness come: Thy mornings clothed in rime, thy evenings chillâ E'en these have power to tempt me from my home, E'en these have beauty to delight me still. Though Nature lingers in her mourning weeds, And wails the dying year in gusty blast, Still added beauty to the last proceeds, And wildness triumphs when her bloom is past. Though long grass all the day is drench'd in dew, And splashy pathways lead me o'er the greens, Though naked fields hang lonely on the view, Long lost to harvest and its busy scenes, Yet in the distance shines the painted bough, Leaves changed to every colour ere they die, And through the valley rivers widen now, Once little brooks which summer dribbled dry. Here ragged boys, pleased with the change of scene, Try new inventions of their infant skill, Leaving their leap-frog races on the green, To watch the waves and build the dashing mill; Or where the molehill island lifts its head, There form the castle with its guarding moat, And o'er the jumping waves, with little dread, Turn nutshell boats and paper ships afloat. On bridge-wall sitting, by such scenes as these, I meet with pleasures that can please for hours; Mix'd in the uproar of those little seas, That roll their floods where summer left her flowers. A wild confusion hangs upon the ear, And something half romantic meets the view; Arches half fill'd with wither'd leaves appear, Where white foam stills the billow boiling through. Those yellow leaves that litter on the grass, 'Mong dry brown stalks that lately blossom'd there, Instil a mournful pleasure as they pass: For melancholy has its joy to spareâ A joy that dwells in autumn's lonely walks, And whispers, like a vision, what shall be, How flowers shall blossom on those wither'd stalks, And green leaves clothe each nearly naked tree. Oft in the woods I hear the thundering gun; And, through the brambles as I cautious creep, A bustling hare, the threatening sound to shun, Oft skips the pathway in a fearful leap; And spangled pheasant, scared from stumpy bush, Oft blunders rustling through the yellow boughs; While farther off, from beds of reed and rush, The startled woodcock leaves its silent sloughs. Here Echo oft her autumn ditty sings, Mocking the cracking whip and yelping hounds, While through the woods the wild disorder rings, Chorus'd with hunter's horns of mellower sounds, And bawling halloos of the sporting train, Who dash through woodland, in their gay parade, And leap the ditch, and sweep the level plain, Fresh wildness adding to the chequer'd shade. The timid sheep that huddled from the wind 'Neath the broad oaks, beside the spinney rails, Half mad with fear such hue and cry to find, In rattling motion chase adown the vales: And, falsely startled by unheeding dogs, From where the acorns patter bright and brown, Through the thorn hedges burst the random hogs, Who grunt and scamper till they reach the town. The playing boys, to eke the rude uproar, Turn hunters some, some mock the yelping hounds, Whose real barkings urge their noise the more, And keck-made bugles spout their twanging sounds, But soon foot-foundered, youngster hunters lag, By mounted sportsmen distanced far away, Yet still they chase the fancied fox or stag, And feel as happy in the cheat as they. Ah! sweet is boyish joy in memory's eye; An artless tale with no attending pains, Save the sad thoughtâto feel such pleasures fly; And the vain hopeâto wish them back again. How many autumns brought the woods their guest, With mimic horns, in hunting sports to join! How many autumns since that time have past, Stretching the distance when such joys were mine! Still joys are mine, uncertain paths to take Through the wild woods, to hide and walk at will, Rustling aside the brown and wither'd brake, To rest on roots, and think, and linger still. Though trumpet-kecks are passed unheeded by, Whose hollow stalks inspired such eager joy, Still other trifles other sports supply, Which manhood seeks as eager as the boy. To meanest trifles pleasure's hold will cling; 'Tis even felt to view that greening moss; These simple wrecks of summer and of springâ Like other children I regret their loss. But there is something in that wind that mourns, And those black clouds that hide the heav'n as well, And in that sun, that gilds and glooms by turns, Which leaves a pleasure that's unspeakable. Though nuts have long been glean'd by many crews Of shatter'd poor, who daily rambled there, And squirrels claim'd the remnant as their dues, Still to the woods the hungry boys repair, Brushing the long dead grass with anxious feet, While round their heads the stirr'd leaves patter down, To seek the bramble's jet-fruit, lushy sweet, Or climbing service-berries ripe and brown. Amidst the wreck of perishable leaves, How fresh and fine appears the evergreen! How box, or holly, garden-walks relieves! How bright the ivy round the oak is seen! And on old thorns the long-leaved mistletoe Regains fresh beauties as its parent dies; While dark spurge-laurel, on the banks below, In stubborn bloom the autumn blight defies. But garden shades have long been doom'd to fall, Where naked fruit-trees drop their constant showers: All blooms are fled, save on the wet moss'd wall As yet may peep some faded gilliflowers. The mist and smoke, in shadows mingling deep, Around each cottage hover all the day; Through the dim panes the prison'd children peep, And look in vain for summer and for play. Now this heath's eminence extends the views, How sweet yon hill-tops on the distance rise, Crowned with stretched woods of many-coloured hues, And wildly hung with autumn's changing skies, Where dark black clouds come slowly rolling on, By others close pursued of lighter stain, Dull shadows glooming dreary: and anon Blue skies and sunlight brighten up again. Light streaks yon sandy road far o'er the grounds, Lost in the vales and peeping with the hills, While in the mist the distance daily bounds, Spires dimly rise and turning sails of mills. And near at hand, aside yon spreading oak, Midst furze and ling and tufts of withered grass The gipsy's dwelling curls its feeble smoke, Where its scant bounty nips the weary ass. O'er yon brown stubble-field which nature shuns, What gaudy views the year did once command When yellow carlock glittered in the sun And crimson cornflowers blazed about the land For furlongs round! when tufty blades of wheat Hid the coy wanderings of the timid hare, That now for furlongs vainly seeks a seat And flies to woods to skulk from danger there. And in the lane, along its hedgerow bank, Where naught shines now but littered yellow leaves, And withered weeds, which summer spindled rankâ Save round old stulps, where ivy wildly weavesâ There once the spring one's pleasant walks beguiled With swarms of violet flowers both white and blue; There mid broad leaves the primrose meekly smiled, And cowslip roots, less plenteous, often grew. Dull seems the town which one's return receives, Where naught is heard around but twanking flails, Save chirping sparrows on our cottage eaves Or twittering robins on some garden pales. There's nothing there one's bounded views can meet But gabbling geese and battling swine's uproar, Where stepping-stones along the dirty street Are laid as bridges to each cottage door. THE LAST OF SUMMER A beauty on the scene attends Ere autumn comes and summer ends, When summer's glory first we see As stained with its mortality. Each morn wakes wan, its sunlight wanes On yellowing leaves and fading plains; Green fields no more the summer views, All sickened into ripened hues Of brown and grey and darksome glooms That mark the path where autumn comes; And in each woodland's buried way The dewdrop lives for half the day. Dank mists oft creep 'twixt earth and sky, And dreaming dim the morning's eye, And dullness wears along the while As if the sun was loath to smile. Yet at midday his feebled powers Will brighten up in sultry hours, And sweating toil, that often stops To wipe aside the falling drops, Pierced with his downward daily ray, Wishes the lagging hours away. By swallows we may plain perceive When summer's on the point to leave, Who skim the pond and rippling spring Where oft they dipt their sutty wing, And green lanes where from morn till night They joyed to wheel their curling flight; Now perched on cottage tops to rest, They twit and prime each dingy breast, Or flock together in the sky As if to learn their young to fly, Preparing each unpractised wing For flight, to seek another spring. Each orchard now is smiling gay, Glittering in the morning ray: Rich clustering plums of varied hue, Of freckled red and misty blue, And sun-tanned pears with ruddy streak, Brown as was summer's lusty cheek, And blushing apples round and red, Whose loaded branches pat the head Of longing maid who hither goes To hang on lines the bleaching clothes. And boys will often slive from play And in the orchard find a way, Hurling up stones with jerking spring, Or sticks with many a sturdy swing, Till on the foot-marked, battered ground The pears and apples patter round. And truant schoolboy, stealing play, Oft sneaks along some secret way; Though ne'er a nest his eye perceives, Though pooties hide in falling leaves, Yet are there hips and haws to seek, And sun-tanned crabs with ruddy cheek, And with harsh grin and wrinkled frown He chews the unpleasant prizes down; And arching o'er the woodland way, Blackberries tempt his thoughts astray. Sloes, powdered o'er with misty down, From hedges too he scrambles down, By shepherds deemed a pleasant treat, Though not till winter makes them sweet; When frost-nipped, they awake desire, And anxious to his cottage fire On the clear blaze each branch he throws, And roasts the hissing, spluttering sloes. Now mushrooms with the morning light Above the wet grass glisten white; Nor are the summer's farewell hours Always left without their flowers; The marjoram oft in shady lane Night's plenteous dews revive again; Long scorched in summer's earlier hours, It now will freshen into flowers. On hills and roads and everywhere, The ragwort blossoms half the year, And thistles on each rushy balk Are constant blushing in our walk, That tower in scornful majesty O'er oddling daisies peeping nigh, Untouched by sheep that hither stray, Who from its prickles sneak away; And endive flowering closely by, That steals its colours from the sky. The old man's beard too in its prime Covers the hedges like a rime, With downy flowers that, thickly twined, Oft shield the swain from rain and wind. These live till summer's last decay, And lingering oft in fond delay With autumn, if she enters mild, Are sought and found by many a child, Who sort their blooms in posies fair, And garlands glad her yellow hair. O Autumn, now thy reign is nigh, I fain would hail thy majesty, But hollow winds and tumbling floods, And surging showers and yellow woods, These are thy mighty minstrelsy, Who, maddening into life with thee, Would make, amid their strains divine, Unheard the song so tame as mine. A SUNDAY WITH SHEPHERDS AND HERDBOYS The shepherds and the herding swains Keep their sabbaths on the plains; For them the church bells vainly call; Fields are their church and house and all; They'll lie and catch the passing sound That comes from steeples shining round, Enjoying in the service time The happy bells' delightful chime, And, if they sit on rising ground, To view the landscape spreading round, Swimming from the following eye In greens and stems of every dye O'er wood and vale and fen's smooth lap Like a richly coloured map; Square plots of clover red and white Scented with summer's warm delight, And cinquefoil of a fresher stain, And different greens of warmÃ¨d grain; Wheat spindles bursting into ear And browning gently; grasses sere In swathy seed-pods dried by heat, Rustling when brushed by passing feet; And beans and peas of deadening green, And cornland's ribbon strips between, And stretching villages that lie Like light spots in a deeper sky. And from the fields they'll often steal The green peas for a Sunday meal, And in snug nooks, their huts beside, The gipsy blazes they provide, Shaking the rotten from the trees, While some sit round to shell the peas, Or pick from hedges pilfered wood To boil on props their stolen food; Sitting on stones or heaps of brakes, Each of the wild repast partakes, Telling to pass the hours along Tales that to fitter days belong, While one within his scrip contains A shattered Bible's thumbed remains, O'er whose blank leaf with pious care A host of names is scribbled there. The herdboys, anxious after play, Find sports to pass the time away, Fishing for struttles in the brooks With thread for lines and pins for hooks, And stripping 'neath the willow shade In warm muddy ponds to bathe, And pelting with unerring eye The heedless swallows slanting by; Oft breaking boughs from trees to kill The nest of wasps beside a hill, Till one gets stung, then they resort And follow to less dangerous sport (Leaving to chance their sheep and cows), To thread the brakes and forest boughs To scare the squirrel's lively joys With stones and sticks and shouting noise, That sat within its secret place Upon its tail to clean its face; When found, they shout with joy to see It hurly-burly round a tree; And as they turn in sight again, It peeps and squats behind a grain; And oft they'll cut up sticks to try The holes where badgers darkling lie, Looking for footmark prints about The fresh mounds not long rooted out; And peep in burrows newly done Where rabbits from their noises run; Where oft in terror's wild affright They spyâand startle at the sightâ Rolled like a whipthong round and round, Asleep upon the sunny ground, A snake, that wakens at their play And starts as full of fear as they; And newt-shaped swifts that nimbly pass And rustle in the brown, lank grass. The herder too is peeping round To find a tenant for his ground; Heedless of rest or parson's prayers, He seldom to the church repairs, But thinks religion hath its due In paying yearly for his pew. Soon as fair morn puts night away And has put on her mantle grey, Before one sunbeam o'er the ground Spindles its light and shadow round, He's o'er the fields as soon as morn To see what stock are in the corn: A neighing colt that tries to catch A gate at night left off the latch By traveller seeking home in haste Or the clown by fancies chased, That, lasting while he made a stand, Opens each gate with fearful hand, Fearing a minute to remain And put it on the latch again; And cows, who often with their horns Toss from the gaps the stuffing thornsâ These, like a fox upon the watch, He in the morning tries to catch And drives them to the pound for pay, Careless about the sabbath day. THE INSECT WORLD The insect world amid the suns and dew Awake and hum their tiny songs anew, And climb the totter-grass and blossom's stem As huge in size as mighty oaks to them; And rushy burnets on the pasture rise As tall as castles to their little eyes; Each leaf's a town and the smooth meadow grass A mighty world whose bounds they never pass; E'en spots no bigger than the husbandman's Or shepherd's noontide dwarf-shrunk shadow spans âOr e'en the milkmaid tripping through the dew, Each space she covers with her slender shoeâ Seem to their view high woods in which they roam As lorn, lost wanderers many miles from home, Creeping up bents and down whole weary hours And resting oft on the soft breasts of flowers; Till age, in minutes long as years, creeps on, Or waning summer warns them to be gone. FLOWERS Ere yet the year is one month old, In spite of frost and wind and snow, Bare-bosomed to the quaking cold, Spring's little selfsown flowers will blow; And ever kin to early hours Peep aconites in cups of gold, With frilled leaves muffled round their flowers Like tender maidens shunning cold; And then as winter's parting pledge, Like true love in his crabbed reign, The violets 'neath the naked hedge Peep thro' the rustling leaves again, Soon as from off the thicket's moss The sunshine clears the doubting snow, And the o'erjoyed and neighing horse Can find a patch of green to blow. Like jewels brought by early hours, These little littered blossoms come; Like wanderers from fairy bowers, They smile and gladly find a home; And on the threshold of the spring, Like timid children out of doors, They lie and wait the birds to sing, And laugh upon the splashy moors. In April's smiling-frowning weather, Like younkers to a holiday, The young flowers bud in troops together To wait the feast of merry May; In sunny nooks and shelter nurst, Buds all their early blooms display, Where sunbeams show their faces first And make when there the longest stay. TO THE SNIPE Lover of swamps And quagmire overgrown With hassock-tufts of sedge, where fear encamps Around thy home alone, The trembling grass Quakes from the human foot, Nor bears the weight of man to let him pass Where thou, alone and mute, Sittest at rest In safety, near the clump Of huge flag-forest that thy haunts invest Or some old sallow stump, Thriving on seams That tiny islands swell, Just hilling from the mud and rancid streams, Suiting thy nature well; For here thy bill, Suited by wisdom good, Of rude unseemly length, doth delve and drill The jellied mass for food; And here, mayhap, When summer suns have drest The moor's rude, desolate and spongy lap, May hide thy mystic nestâ Mystic indeed; For isles that oceans make Are scarcely more secure for birds to build Than this flag-hidden lake. Boys thread the woods To their remotest shades; But in these marshy flats, these stagnant floods, Security pervades. From year to year Places untrodden lie, Where man nor boy nor stock hath ventured near, Naught gazed on but the sky And fowl that dread The very breath of man, Hiding in spots that never knew his tread, A wild and timid clan, Widgeon and teal And wild duckârestless lot, That from man's dreaded sight will ever steal To the most dreary spot. Here tempests howl Around each flaggy plot, Where they who dread man's sight, the water fowl, Hide and are frightened not. 'Tis power divine That heartens them to brave The roughest tempest and at ease recline On marshes or the wave. Yet instinct knows Not safety's bounds:âto shun The firmer ground where skulking fowler goes With searching dogs and gun, By tepid springs Scarcely one stride across (Though bramble from its edge a shelter flings Thy safety is at loss) âAnd never choose The little sinky foss, Streaking the moors whence spa-red water spews From pudges fringed with moss; Freebooters there, Intent to kill or slay, Startle with cracking guns the trepid air, And dogs thy haunts betray. From danger's reach Here thou art safe to roam, Far as these washy flag-sown marshes stretch A still and quiet home. In these thy haunts I've gleaned habitual love; From the vague world where pride and folly taunts I muse and look above. Thy solitudes The unbounded heaven esteems, And here my heart warms into higher moods And dignifying dreams. I see the sky Smile on the meanest spot, Giving to all that creep or walk or fly A calm and cordial lot. Thine teaches me Right feelings to employâ That in the dreariest places peace will be A dweller and a joy. SUMMER IMAGES Now swarthy summer, which rude health embrowns, Takes precedence of rosy-fingered spring And litters from her lap A world of varied hues. Joy, never silent with her laugh and song, And health robust with bosom soft as down, And patient industry Still plying busy toilsâ These in her merry path run jovial on, Or hang upon her arm in smiling guise, And from her happy face Steal smiles that grace their own. Thee with thy sultry locks all loose and rude, And mantle laced with gems of tawdry hues, I love thee, and as wont Win pleasure from thy smiles. And thus delighted, on I thread with thee Rude wood, wild heath, and cornfield laced with streams, And feel life's stirring pulse Throb into genial song. Me not the noise of brawling pleasure cheers, In mighty revels or in city streets, But joys which soothe And not distract mine ear, That one at musing leisure ever meets In the green woods and meadows summer-shorn, Or fields where gadfly sounds Its small and tiresome horn. Jet-black and shining, from the dripping hedge Slow peeps the fearful snail, And from each tiny bent Withdraws his timid horn. The yellow frog from underneath the swath Leaps startling as the dog with heavy feet Brushes across the path And runs the timid hare. And mark the bird-boy peep from out the corn, Bawling aloud to know the passing hour, And at the lessening day To list his louder song. The aspen leaves, enamoured of the wind, Turn up their silver lining to the sun, And rustle on the ear Like fast-approaching showers. The south-west windâI love the sudden sound, And then to feel it gush upon my cheek, And then with weary pause Await the creeping storm. To me right luscious sing the stirring leaves, Just bade to dance attendance on the storm, That blackens in the south And threatens hasty showers. I love the wizard noise, and rave in turn, Half-vacant thoughts in self-imagined rhymes, Then hide me from the shower, And mutter to the winds. Now sound the village bells; how musical, Across the valley of that winding flood, Upon the listening ear Comes the soft pealing chime; As glad and healthful as the morning sun, The shepherd boy leans o'er the meadow bridge To list their mellow sounds And muse in vacant joy. Woods, meadows, cornfields, all around Glow in their harmony of varied greens, While o'er them, lost in light, Far spreads the laughing sky. THE DREAM Thou scarest me with dreams. Job. When night's last hours, like haunting spirits, creep With listening terrors round the couch of sleep, And midnight, brooding in its deepest dye, Seizes on fear with dismal sympathy, âI dreamed a dreamâ something akin to fate, Which superstition's blackest thoughts createâ Something half natural to the grave that seems, Which death's long trance of slumber haply dreams; A dream of staggering horrors, and of dread, Whose shadows fled not when the vision fled, But clung to memory with their gloomy view, Till doubt and fancy half believed it true. That time was come, or seemed as it was come, When Death no longer makes the grave his home; When waking spirits leave their earthly rest To mix for ever with the damned or blest; When years, in drowsy thousands counted by, Are hung on minutes with their destiny: When Time in terror drops his draining glass, And all things mortal, like to shadows, pass, As 'neath approaching tempests sinks the sunâ When Time shall leave Eternity begun. Life swoon'd in terror at that hour's dread birth As in an ague, shook the fearful Earth; And shuddering Nature seemed herself to shun; Whilst trembling Conscience felt the deed was done. A gloomy sadness round the sky was cast, Where clouds seemed hurrying with unusual haste; Winds urged them onward, like to restless ships, And light dim faded in its last eclipse, And Agitation turned a straining eye, And Hope stood watching like a bird to fly, While suppliant Nature, like a child in dread, Clung to her fading garments till she fled. Then awful sights began to be revealed, Which Death's dark dungeons had so long concealed; Each grave its doomsday-prisoner resigned, Bursting in noises like a hollow wind; And spirits, mingling with the living then, Thrilled fearful voices with the cries of men. All flying furious, grinning deep despair, Shaped dismal shadows on the troubled air: Red lightning shot its flashes as they came, And passing clouds seemed kindling into flame; And strong and stronger came the sulphury smell, With demons following in the breath of hell, Laughing in mockery as the doomed complained, Losing their pains in seeing others pained. Fierce raged destruction, sweeping o'er the land, And the last counted moment seemed at hand: As scales near equal hang the earnest eyes In doubtful balance which shall fall or rise, So, in the moment of that crashing blast, Eyes, hearts, and hopes paused trembling for the last. Loud burst the thunder's clap, and yawning rents Gashed the frail garments of the elements; Then sudden whirlwinds, winged with purple flame And lightnings' flash, in stronger terrors came; Burning all life and nature where they fell, And leaving earth as desolate as hell. The pleasant hues of woods and fields were past, And nature's beauties had enjoyed their last: The coloured flower, the green of field and tree, What they had been for ever ceased to be: Clouds, raining fire, scorched up the hissing dews; Grass shrivelled brown in miserable hues; Leaves fell to ashes in the air's hot breath, And all awaited universal death. The sleepy birds, scared from their mossy nest, Beat through the evil air in vain for rest; And many a one, the withering shades among, Wakened to perish o'er its brooded young. The cattle, startled with the sudden fright, Sickened from food, and maddened into flight; And steed and beast in plunging speed pursued The desperate struggle of the multitude. The faithful dogs yet knew their owners' face, And cringing followed with a fearful pace, Joining the piteous yell with panting breath, While blasting lightnings followed fast with death; Then, as destruction stopt the vain retreat, They dropped, and dying licked their masters' feet. When sudden thunders paused, loud went the shriek, And groaning agonies, too much to speak, From hurrying mortals, who, with ceaseless fears, Recalled the errors of their vanished years, Flying in all directions, hope-bereft, Followed by dangers that would not be left, Offering wild vows, and begging loud for aid, Where none was nigh to help them when they prayed. None stood to listen, or to soothe a friend, But all complained, and sorrow had no end. Sons from their fathers, fathers sons did fly, The strongest fled, and left the weak to die; Pity was dead: none heeded for another; Brother left brother; and the frantic mother For fruitless safety hurried east and west, And dropped the babe to perish from her breast: All howling prayers that would be noticed never, And craving mercy that was fled for ever. While earth, in motion like a troubled sea, Opened in gulphs of dread immensity, Amid the wild confusions of despair, And buried deep the howling and the prayer Of countless multitudes, and closedâand then Opened, and swallowed multitudes agen. Stars drunk with dread rolled giddy from the heaven, And staggering worlds like wrecks in storms were driven; The pallid moon hung fluttering on the sight, As startled bird whose wings are stretched for flight; And o'er the east a fearful light begun To show the sun riseânot the morning sun, But one in wild confusion, doomed to rise And drop again in horror from the skies; To heaven's midway it reeled, and changed to blood, Then dropped, and light rushed after like a flood. The heaven's blue curtains rent and shrank away, And heaven itself seem'd threaten'd with decay; While hopeless distance with a boundless stretch Flashed on despair the joy it could not reach, A moment's mockeryâere the last dim light Vanished, and left an everlasting night: And with that light Hope fled, and shrieked farewell, And hell in yawning echoes mocked that yell. Now Night resumed her uncreated vest, And chaos came again, but not its rest; The melting glooms, that spread perpetual stains, Kept whirling on in endless hurricanes; And tearing noises, like a troubled sea, Broke up that silence which no more would be. The reeling earth sank loosened from its stay, And nature's wrecks all felt their last decay. The yielding, burning soil, that fled my feet, I seemed to feel, and struggled to retreat; And midst the dreads of horror's mad extreme I lost all notion of its being a dream: Sinking, I fell through depths that seemed to be As far from fathom as Eternity; While dismal faces on the darkness came, With wings of dragons, and with fangs of flame, Writhing in agonies of wild despairs, And giving tidings of a doom like theirs. I felt all terrors of the damned, and fell With conscious horror that my doom was hell: And Memory mocked me, like a haunting ghost, With light and life and pleasures that were lost. As dreams turn night to day, and day to night, So Memory flashed her shadows of that light That once bade morning suns in glory rise, To bless green fields and trees and purple skies, And wakened life its pleasures to behold;â That light flashed on me, like a story told; And days misspent with friends and fellow men, And sins committedâall were with me then. The boundless hell, where tortures never tire, Glimmered beneath me like a world on fire: That soul of fire, like to its souls entombed, Consuming on, and ne'er to be consumed, Seemed nigh at handâwhere oft the sulphury damps O'er-awed its light, as glimmer dying lamps, Spreading a horrid gloom from side to side, A twilight scene of terrors half descried. Sad boiled the billows of that burning sea, And Fate's sad yellings dismal seemed to be; Blue rolled its waves with horrors uncontrolled, And its live wrecks of souls dashed howling as they rolled. Again I struggled, and the spell was broke, And midst the laugh of mocking ghosts I woke; My eyes were opened on an unhoped sightâ The early morning and its welcome light, And, as I pondered o'er the past profound, I heard the cock crow, and I blest the sound. THE NIGHTMARE Her steps take hold of hell. âSolomon. My dream began in bliss and lifted high My sleeping feelings into fancy's joy; Though like one wandering in a sweet far land I seemed to hear and could not understand Among the many voices humming by, Nor knew one face where many met my eye. That dim-seen mystery which in dreams appears Was mine, a feeling of joy, hopes, and fears, Mingling together; yet I knew not why, Where all was beauty, trouble should be by. The place was lightâand yet no sun was there To cause itâpale and beautifully fair, Nor glare nor gloom but like eternity Mild, like what spirits may expect to see; But there was earth and sky and trees and flowers, Different in kind and yet resembling ours; And mightiest objects that the eye surveyed, No light they clouded and they cast no shade; But in that sky no cloud crossed east and west, No storm crept frowning o'er its crystal rest. At length a mighty mansion gathered high, Whose bounds seemed almost boundless to the eye, A place that wakened fancy's wonders there, As mystery's mask left half her shadow bare; A shapeless shape and semblance faint of things That earth calls palaces, the place of kings. Here all seemed entering; yet there was no crowd, No anxious rushing, and no noises loud. All seemed intent on matters yet unknown, And every other's interest seemed their own, Like as a brook pursues its gliding way, Urged by an impulse which they could not stay. Fear shrank to silence now and hovered round, Till wandering steps seemed listening for their sound. Restless as waves in their eternal race, Where one crowd passed another took its place. The gathering throngs that seemed to make one spot, I seemed to know some and then knew them not; Some more familiar seemed; I turned again And they were strange and left a lonely pain; And other eyes on my inquiries came And seemed they knew me, but to feel the same; As birds seek nests which idle boys have got, They sought what had been and they found it not; What memory's shadows dimly might displayâ Friends, loves, and kinâfound none and turned away. At length one singled from the mighty throng Where I had gazed on vacant looks so long, With flowing robes, blue eyes, and face divine, Came forth and fixed her tender gaze on mine. It looked familiar as I'd seen the same; But recollections of her earthly name Were lost, if e'er she had a claim to one; She joined my steps and seemed to lead me on. We entered with the rest, and by my side She stood, my all companion, friend, and guide. Arches empillared like the rainbow's height Went sweeping up and almost left the sight; And yet o'er them a covering met the eye, As earth seems covered with surrounding sky. At last the silence with a murmur broke Like the first hum when organs are awoke, And every face seemed turned towards the sound Where hope would soothe and mystery would confound; Fate seemed as writing upon every brow A fearful question, âWho'll be summoned now?â Yet woman seemed (though beauty's face beguiles One's heart to favour) checking fears with smiles; And my companion seated by my side Seemed checking mine and strove her own to hide; Her long white hand pressed mine with cheering power As offering safety in a dangerous hour; She looked and spake not yet, her lips the while Closed mid the tumult in a timid smile; And as the mystery waking gathered near, Looked as one dares a danger, âNever fear.â More loud the music rose and yet more loud Chorused with humming of a mighty crowd; And through the mild light that at first clothed all A brighter streamed, like sunbeams on a wall, Growing more bright and losing it away Like creeping sunrise on a summer's day; A light that dazzled not, and yet it threw Around o'erpowering splendour as it grew; More high the music seemed, more strong the fear, And awful symptoms rousing gathered near; Voices awoke from many a troubling tongue, But no words came distinctly from the throng; Fears grew within me, and I fain had tried To search the purpose of my angel guide. Anxiety turned on her quiet face, And recollections would [old] memories trace, As one I'd witnessed once or else the same, The looks of one I had not power to name; She seemed at first as living beauty seems, Then changed more lovely in the shade of dreams; Then faded dim, confused, and hurrying by Like memory waning into vacancy. The music rose in terror's ecstasies, In gradual swells like winds in summer trees, Gathering and gathering to its highest bound, And burst at last in mystery's mightiest sound. Millions of hopes, hung on a spider's tie 'Tween time's suspense and fate's eternity, Seemed cut at once, and all around the host Felt at that moment if his own was lost; And in a moment sudden changes rang Confusion's uproarâdiscord's jarring clang, Harsh noises, stunning crush, and thrilling yell, As the whole mansion on their shoulders fell. A light glowed round with horror's staggering sound, And all seemed giddy, reeling, sinking round; A weight plopt on me with a sudden crush, A noise like waters that for freedom rush; I could not move, nor speak; yet reason's power Seemed wide awake in that spell-prisoning hour; I felt as tried, whate'er the lot might be, And strove and struggled with my destiny; And then my eyes in hopeless wandering spied That lovely shadow which had been my guide, Seemly bent o'er me, offering mercy's plea, 'Tween death's dark hell and life's eternity. Her face grew pale and awful, yet a shade Of beauty hung in every change it made. Her eyes o'er mine hung beautiful and bright, Like the sun setting upon deepening night; And love, fear, hopeâall mortals can recallâ I felt none separate, but I felt them all. Her white round arms threw back her streaming hair, And smiles hung o'er me as in death's despair. Something drew near me and my guide withdrew, Beauteous as ever but in terror too; Her bright eyes lessened dim but not with tears, Heavy with sorrows and the gloom of fears; And scarce I turned her desert flight to trace Ere a foul fiend seemed standing in her place. 'Twas Mary's voice that hung in her farewell; The sound that moment on my memory fellâ A sound that held the music of the past; But she was blest and I alone was cast; My dangers dimmed the glory of her eyes, And turned her smiling and her hopes to sighs. The gloomiest pictures fear could ever make, The fiend drew near to make my terrors acheâ Huge circles lost to eyes, and rotten hulls Raised with dead groans from the dread âplace of skullsâ,â Then turned with horrid laugh its haggard head To where the earth-loved shadow dimly fled, As mockeryâwaking hell with horrid sound Like many murmurs moving underground. I shuddering struggled from his horrid glare And snapped my bonds and ended my despair, Andâas woke reason from the vision crept, She seemed to start as one that ne'er had slept; Horror and joy and mystery when by Seemed less of vision than reality, A nightmare mystery of a sealing doom, A feeble picture of the dread to come. I wish to acknowledge that whatsoever merit this and The Dream may be thought to possess they owe it in part to the English Opium Eater, as they were written after (though actual dreams) the perusal of that singular and interesting production. THE ROBBER Yet what am I? A robber: and why bring In robbers' haunts so fair and sweet a thing? Men who will steal a purse a heart will steal, And beauty wakes the roughest hearts to feel. Why did I wrong her with the name of wife And hate her as the dearest thing in life? For love like mine is nothing else but hateâ To link bright beings to so dark a fate; Who if she knew one link that holds that tie, Her heart would chill with terrors all and die, Her ears would grow too adamant to hear One word related of that tale of fear, Her soul would be on fire could she but see One shadow of a robber's history. 'Tis night, 'tis midnight!âhark, the horse's tramp Comes plashing through the old heath's hollow swamp. We tied the gateâand ere that gate we tied, Or held that weapon, would that I had died! The traveller heard one whistle shrill and clear, And muttered: âPoachers! come on, Dobbin, never fear!â The horse could see us at the wood gate stand And snorted at the weapon in my hand; But the old farmer checked the trembling steed To try the gateâand midnight knew the deed. The shot was firedâdead silence pausedâthen groans That would have fretted human hearts to stones; And that last groan of uttermost despair, I hear it nowâor did I stir the chair? That last groan waked an echo which I hear Now and for ever, here and everywhereâ A howlâa shriekâa hoarse unearthly callâ 'Twas this and that and all made up of all; Just from our lair it came within the wood: âThey're mine; they've sealed the bond in death and blood.â The gun dropt from my hand, and where it fell The ground seemed opening like the mouth of hell. I was not drunk but sober all, yet fear Could see that sight and still that sound could hear; And though I stopt my ears and held my breath, The wind and grass and bushes muttered âDeath!â âDo good and good shall come,â the parson said; But I was poaching while he preached or prayed. And when he read his lessons and his prayers, My mind was busy after dogs and hares. âDo good and good shall come.â I know it now. Oh, could I wipe this murther from my brow! And good had come, but harm blocks all the way, And I must suffer, for I cannot pray. Look! there's the wood gateâdon't you see it tied? Untie it nowâand throw that gun aside! No; all's too lateâyou help me all in vain; Blood will for ever on its bands remain. I hear the groan again, the midnight yell; Guns may go off half cockedâbut ere mine fell The shot was fired; yet when it met the ground A sputtering fire one moment blazed around; Trees trembled to their trunks, a dreadful sign, When that unearthly hoarseness muttered âMine!â I hear't again! Oh, wipe that stain away, That stains that dreadful place this very day. Nay, chop the bushes up, they speak so loud. Look! now 'tis there upon that dismal cloud: A giantâno a monsterâsails; look there! He'll swallow up the moon, stars, allâbeware! He hears the muttering guns; well, never fear; 'Tis but a hareâthe crime is not severe. There, now 'tis changed!âa dragon from his hole, His body black, his head a burning coal: Oh, what a horrid picture! don't you see? He darts his venom fangs and mocks at me. Ah, that's the horrid demon of the heath! Chop down those treesâI choke for want of breath. Nay, take that bullet outâ'twill burst the gun! The gun's not bursted, but the deed is done. Grub up the bushes! âDeath,â they sighed and sighed. I stopt my ears to hear; he groanedâand died. The robber's wife had all that women heir, A form all lovely, and a face so fair In nature's sunny lap she seemed as nursed, Until the robber into misery cursed Her poor forsaken presence. Wonder stared On that sweet face that sorrow sadly marred, And marvelled how a flower of winning grace Could trust itself in such a dangerous place As the affections of a robber's heart. But in love's faith suspicion bears no part; They could not feel, while wasting idle breath, That love like ivy clings to life and death. Yet when the law's decision met her ears, The last hope [fell] that propt up all her fears; So young, so beautiful, she was not born To stand against the world's down-trampling scorn. Rich beauty ne'er was made for thorny ways, That only blooms and thrives on smiles and praise. It could not bear the withering frowns of scorn; As well might blossoms bear a frosty morn. She withered into death for nothing done, And shunned her life that had no sin to shun. Then pity's hand was held before its eyes, And scorn itself grew tender in disguise; âSo young, so beautiful, and thus to die!ââ So pity sighed; scorn uttered no reply. LIFE, DEATH, AND ETERNITY A shadow moving by one's side, That would a substance seemâ That is, yet is notâthough descried Like skies beneath the stream; A tree that's ever in the bloom, Whose fruit is never rife; A wish for joys that never comeâ Such are the hopes of Life. A dark, inevitable night, A blank that will remain; A waiting for the morning light, Where waiting is in vain; A gulph, where pathway never led To show the depth beneath; A thing we know not, yet we dreadâ The hornÃ¨d thingâ'tis Death. The vaulted void of purple sky That everywhere extends, That stretches from the dazzled eye, In space that never ends; A morning whose uprisen sun No setting e'er shall see; A day that comes without a noonâ Such is Eternity. ANTIQUITY Antiquity, thou dark sublime, Though mystery wakes thy song, Thou dateless child of hoary Time, Thy name shall linger long! In vain Age bared Destruction's arm To blight thy strength and fame; Learning still keeps thy embers warm, And kindles them to flame. Nay, learning's self may turn to dust, And ignorance again May leave its glimmering lamp to rust; Antiquity shall reign! Creation's self thy date shall be, And Earth's age be as thine; The sun and moon are types of thee, Nor shall they longer shine. Though Time may o'er thy memory leap, And Ruin's frowns encroach; Eternity shall start from sleep To hear thy near approach. Though bounds are for thy station set, Still, ere those bounds are past, Thy fame with Time shall struggle yet, And die with Time the last. Whene'er I walk where thou hast been, And still art doomed to be, Reflection wakens at the scene, As at eternity; To think what days in millions by Have bade suns rise and set On thy unwearied gazing eye, And left thee looking yet! While those that raised thy early fame With hope's persisting hand, During as marble left thy name And graved their own on sand: That same sun did its smiles impart, In that same spreading sky, When thou wert left; and here thou art, Like one that cannot die! On the first page that Time unfurled, Thy childhood did appear, And now thy volume is the world, And thou art everywhere. Each leaf is filled with many a doom Of kingdoms past away, Where tyrant power in little room Records its own decay. Thy Roman fame o'er England still Swells many a lingering scar, Where Caesars led, with conquering skill, Their legions on to war: And camps and stations still abide On many a sloping hill; Though Time hath done its all to hideâ Thy presence guards them still. The moss that crowns the mountain stone, The grass that greens the plain, All love to make thy haunts their own, And with thy steps remain. And ivy, as thy lasting bower, In gloomy grandeur creeps, And, careless of life's passing hour, Its endless summer keeps. I walk with thee my native plains, As in a nobler clime, Rapt where thy memory still remains, Disciple unto Time, Whose foot in ruins crushed Power's fame, And left its print behind, Till Ruin, weary of its name, Their fate to thee resigned. And 'neath thy care, in mist sublime, They reign and linger still; Though ivy finds no wall to climb, Grass crowns each swelling hill; Where slumbering Time will often find His rebel deeds again, And turn a wondering look behind To see them still remain. Thus through the past thy name appears, All hoary and sublime, Unburied in the grave of years, To run its race with Time; While men, as sunbeams gild the brook, Shine till a cloud comes on, And then, ere Time a stride hath took, Their name and all is gone. Temple and tower of mighty name, And monumental bust, Neglect the errands of their fame, And mingle with the dust: The clouds of ruin soon efface What pride had told in vain; But still thy genius haunts the place, And long thy steps remain. Lorn Silence o'er their mystery dreams, And round them Nature blooms Sad, as a May-flower's dwelling seems With solitary tombs! Round where their buried memory sleeps, Spring spreads its dewy sky In tender mood, as one that weeps Life's faded majesty. Time's frost may crumble stubborn towers, Fame once believed its own; Thou still art reigning, past his powers, And ruin builds thy throne: When all is past, the very ground Is sacred unto thee; When dust and weeds hide all around, That dust thy home shall be. THE TOPER'S RANT Give me an old crone of a fellow Who loves to drink ale in a horn, And sing racy songs when he's mellow, Which topers sung ere he was born. For such a friend fate shall be thankÃ¨d, And, line but our pockets with brass, We'd sooner suck ale through a blanket Than thimbles of wine from a glass. Away with your proud thimble-glasses Of wine foreign nations supply, A toper ne'er drinks to the lasses O'er a draught scarce enough for a fly. Club me with the hedger and ditcher Or beggar that makes his own horn, To join o'er an old gallon pitcher Foaming o'er with the essence of corn. I care not with whom I get tipsy Or where with brown stout I regale, I'll weather the storm with a gipsy If he be a lover of ale. I'll weather the toughest storm weary Altho' I get wet to the skin, For my outside I never need fear me While warm with real stingo within. We'll sit till the bushes are dropping Like the spout of a watering pan, And till the cag's drained there's no stopping, We'll keep up the ring to a man. We'll sit till Dame Nature is feeling The breath of our stingo so warm, And bushes and trees begin reeling In our eyes like to ships in a storm. We'll start it three hours before seven, When larks wake the morning to dance, And we'll stand it till night's black eleven, When witches ride over to France; And we'll sit it in spite of the weather Till we tumble dead drunk on the plain, When the morning shall find us together, All willing to stand it again. ENCLOSURE Far spread the moory ground, a level scene Bespread with rush and one eternal green, That never felt the rage of blundering plough, Though centuries wreathed spring blossoms on its brow. Autumn met plains that stretched them far away In unchecked shadows of green, brown, and grey. Unbounded freedom ruled the wandering scene; No fence of ownership crept in between To hide the prospect from the gazing eye; Its only bondage was the circling sky. A mighty flat, undwarfed by bush and tree, Spread its faint shadow of immensity, And lost itself, which seemed to eke its bounds, In the blue mist the horizon's edge surrounds. Now this sweet vision of my boyish hours, Free as spring clouds and wild as forest flowers, Is faded allâa hope that blossomed free, And hath been once as it no more shall be. Enclosure came, and trampled on the grave Of labour's rights, and left the poor a slave; And memory's pride, ere want to wealth did bow, Is both the shadow and the substance now. The sheep and cows were free to range as then Where change might prompt, nor felt the bonds of men. Cows went and came with every morn and night To the wild pasture as their common right; And sheep, unfolded with the rising sun, Heard the swains shout and felt their freedom won, Tracked the red fallow field and heath and plain, Or sought the brook to drink, and roamed again; While the glad shepherd traced their tracks along, Free as the lark and happy as her song. But now all's fled, and flats of many a dye That seemed to lengthen with the following eye, Moors losing from the sight, far, smooth, and blea, Where swopt the plover in its pleasure free, Are banished now with heaths once wild and gay As poet's visions of life's early day. Like mighty giants of their limbs bereft, The skybound wastes in mangled garbs are left, Fence meeting fence in owner's little bounds Of field and meadow, large as garden-grounds, In little parcels little minds to please, With men and flocks imprisoned, ill at ease. For with the poor scared freedom bade farewell, And fortune-hunters totter where they fell; They dreamed of riches in the rebel scheme And find too truly that they did but dream. THE LAMENT OF SWORDY WELL I'm Swordy Well, a piece of land That's fell upon the town, Who worked me till I couldn't stand And crush me now I'm down. There was a time my bit of ground Made freeman of the slave, The ass no pounder'd dare to pound When I his supper gave. The gipsy's camp was not afraid, I made his dwelling free, Till vile enclosure came, and made A parish slave of me. Alas, dependence, thou'rt a brute Want only understands; His feelings wither branch and root Who falls in parish hands. The muck that clouts the ploughman's shoe, The moss that hides the stone, Now I'm become the parish due, Is more than I can own. The silver springs are naked dykes, With scarce a clump of rushes; When gain got nigh, the tasteless tykes Grubbed up trees, banks, and bushes. Though I'm no man, yet any wrong Some sort of right may seek, And I am glad if e'en a song Give me the room to speak. I've got among such grubbling gear And such a hungry pack, If I brought harvests twice a year, They'd bring me nothing back. And should the price of grain get high âLord help and keep it low!â I shan't possess a butterfly Nor get a weed to grow, I shan't possess a yard of ground To bid a mouse to thrive; For gain has put me in a pound, I scarce can keep alive. Ah me!âthey turned me inside out For sand and grit and stones, And turned my old green hills about And picked my very bones. The bees fly round in feeble rings And find no blossom by, Then thrum their almost weary wings Upon the moss, and die. Rabbits that find my hills turned o'er Forsake my poor abode; They dread a workhouse like the poor, And nibble on the road. If with a clover bottle now Spring dares to lift her head, The next day brings the hasty plough And makes me misery's bed. I've scarce a nook to call my own For things that creep or fly; The beetle hiding 'neath a stone Does well to hurry by. And if I could but find a friend With no deceit to sham, Who'd send me some few sheep to tend, And leave me as I am, To keep my hills from cart and plough And strife of mongrel men, And as spring found me find me now, I should look up agen. And save his Lordship's woods, that past The day of danger dwell, Of all the fields I am the last That my own face can tell; Yet what with stone-pits' delving holes, And strife to buy and sell, My name will quickly be the whole That's left of Swordy Well. TO ANNA, THREE YEARS OLD My Anna, summer laughs in mirth, And we will of the party be, And leave the crickets in the hearth For green fields' merry minstrelsy. I see thee now with little hand Catch at each object passing by, The happiest thing in all the land Except the bee and butterfly. The weed-based arches' walls that stride O'er where the meadow water falls Will turn thee from thy path aside To gaze upon the mossy walls. And limpid brook that leaps along, Gilt with the summer's burnished gleam, Will stop thy little tale or song To gaze upon its crimping stream. Thou'lt leave my hand with eager speed The new-discovered things to seeâ The old pond with its water-weed And danger-daring willow-tree, Who leans, an ancient invalid, O'er spots where deepest waters be. In sudden shout and wild surprise I hear thy simple wonderment, As new things meet thy childish eyes And wake some innocent intent; As bird or bee or butterfly Bounds through the crowd of merry leaves And starts the rapture of thine eye To run for what it ne'er achieves; The simple reasoning arguments Shaped to thy fancy's little view, The joys and rapturous intents That everywhere pursue. So dreamed I over hope's young boon, When merry summer was returning, And little thought that time so soon Would change my early hope to mourning. I thought to have heard thee mid the bowers To mock the cuckoo's merry song, And see thee seek thy daisy flowers That's been thy anxious choice so long. But thou art on the bed of pain, So tells each poor forsaken toy. Ah, could I see that happy hour When these shall be thy heart's employ, And see thee toddle o'er the plain, And stoop for flowers, and shout for joy. POESY Oh! I have been thy lover long, Soul-soothing Poesy; If 'twas not thou inspired the song, I still owe much to thee: And still I feel the cheering balm Thy heavenly smiles supply, That keeps my struggling bosom calm When life's rude storms are high. Oh! in that sweet romance of life I loved thee, when a boy, And ever felt thy gentle strife Awake each little joy: To thee was urged each nameless song, Soul-soothing Poesy; And as my hopes waxed warm and strong, My love was more for thee. 'Twas thou and Nature bound, and smiled, Rude garlands round my browâ Those dreams that pleased me when a child, Those hopes that warm me now. Each year with brighter blooms returned, Gay visions danced along, And, at the sight, my bosom burned, And kindled into song. Springs came not, as they yearly come To low and vulgar eyes, With here and there a flower in bloom, Green trees, and brighter skies: Thy fancies flushed my boyish sight, And gilt its earliest hours; And Spring came wrapt in beauty's light, An angel dropping flowers. Oh! I have been thy lover long, Soul-soothing Poesy, And sung to thee each simple song, With witching ecstasy, Of flowers, and things that claimed from thee Of life an equal share, And whispered soft their tales to me Of pleasure or of care. With thee, life's errand all perform, And feel its joy and pain; Flowers shrink, like me, from blighting storm, And hope for suns again: The bladed grass, the flower, the leaf, Companions seem to be, That tell their tales of joy and grief, And think and feel with me. HOPE SPRINGS ETERNAL We well may wonder o'er the change of scene Now summer's contrast thro' the land is spread, And turn us back where winter's tempest fled And left naught living but the ivy's green. The then bare woods, that trembled overhead Like spectres mid the storm of what had been And wrecks of beauty, ne'er to bloom again, Are now all glory. Nature smiles as free As the last summer had commenced its reign And she were blooming in eternity. So in this life, when future thoughts beguile And from past care our spirits get relieved, Hope cheers us onward with as sweet a smile As if before she never had deceived. PROVIDENCE (II) It hides the future, and leaves room for hope To smile and promise joys that may not come; And cares from which our fortunes can't elope Are robbed of half their terrors, being dumb And all unable to foretell their speed. This blessed ignorance is half the sum Of providence; thus all are blest indeed, The weak and strong, the timid and the bold; Thus will the hare feel safe in its retreat, Where lay the murdering fox an hour before; And upon boughs warm with the falcon's feet, The wren will perch, and dream of harm no more. Kind providence amid contending strife Bids weakness feel the liberty of life. AUTUMN Autumn comes laden with her ripened load Of fruitage and so scatters them abroad That the fern-smothered heath and mole-hill waste Are black with bramble berriesâwhere in haste The chubby urchins from the village hie To feast them there, stained with the purple dye; While painted woods around my rambles be In draperies worthy of eternity. Yet will the leaves soon patter on the ground, And death's deaf voice awake at every sound: One dropsâthen othersâand the last that fell Rings for those left behind their passing-bell. Thus memory everywhere her tidings brings How sad death robs us of life's dearest things. TO THE MEMORY OF BLOOMFIELD (I) Sweet unassuming minstrel! not to thee The dazzling fashions of the day belong; Nature's wild pictures, field, and cloud, and tree, And quiet brooks, far distant from the throng, In murmurs tender as the toiling bee, Make the sweet music of thy gentle song. Well, Nature owns thee: let the crowd pass by; The tide of fashion is a stream too strong For pastoral brooks, that gently flow and sing: But Nature is their source, and earth and sky Their annual offering to her current bring. Thy gentle muse and memory need no sigh; For thine shall murmur on to many a spring, When prouder streams are summer-burnt and dry. TO THE MEMORY OF BLOOMFIELD (II) The shepherd musing o'er his summer dreams, The May-day wild flowers in the meadow grass, The sunshine sparkling in the valley streams, The singing ploughman and haymaking lassâ These live, the summer of thy rural themes; Thy green memorials these, and they surpass The cobweb praise of fashion; every May Shall find a native Giles beside his plough, Joining the skylark's song at early day; And summer, rustling in the ripening corn, Shall meet thy rustic lover as sweet as now, Offering to Mary's lips âthe brimming hornâ; And seasons round thy humble grave shall be Fond lingering pilgrims to remember thee. OLD POESY (II) To turn from pages of this modern art To fame's old pages that real life impart, We seem as startled from unnatural dreams To hear the summer voice of woods and streams, And feel the sunny air, right green and young, Breathe music round as though a siren sung; And greet, as art's vain painted scenes are by, The soul-stirred impulse of a living sky, As in long droughts of summer's parchÃ¨d hours Falls the refreshment of great rains and showers. The birds resume their song, the leaves their green, And brooks, that long dry as the land have been, Brim-full of the sky's bounty gladly go, Seeming to sing and wonder why they flow. TO MARY (II) The flower that's gathered beauty soon forsakes; The bliss grows feeble as we gain the prize; Love dreams of joy, and in possession wakes, Scarce time enough to hail it ere it dies: Life intermingles, with its cares and sighs, And rapture's dreams are ended. Heavenly flower, It is not so with thee! Still fancy's power Throws rainbow haloes round thee, and thine eyes, That once did steal their sapphire blue from even, Are beaming on; thy cheeks' bewitching dye, Where partial roses all their blooms had given, Still in fond memory with the rose can vie; And thy sweet bosom, which to view was heaven, No lily yet a fairer hue supplies. A FAVOURITE NOOK DESTROYED Poor outcast refugees of mother earth, Condemned in vain for rest and peace to roam, Ye birds and beasts of fate's despited birth, Forced from the wilds which nature left your home By vile invasions of encroaching men, By whom wild nature's nearly dispossestâ The rabbit has no waste to make his den, And the coy pheasant has not where to rest, And cawing rook, as spring returns again, Scarce finds a tree whereon to build its nest. Ah, tyrant knaves, while preaching freedom's laws, Crying down tyranny in stronger power, You glut your vile unsatiated maws And freedom's birthright in the weak devour. BEAUTY'S DECAY Youth speeds its springtide like a princely flower, And beauty is the jewel of its hour, That blooms exulting in its triumph there, âThis work is mine and where is aught so fair?â Nature looks on and doth in raptures move, Feeling the earnest of delight is love; Its pains and happiness are sighs and smiles, And life in bud with opening hope beguiles; While scarce a pulse beats 'neath the fickle reign Of present happiness and future pain. For what hath beauty's self to boast and wear, A lily skin, a cheek of rose, dark hair, Bright eyes and ruby lipsâtime's poor displayâ When every hour can steal a charm away? A SPRING MORNING The Spring comes in with all her hues and smells, In freshness breathing over hills and dells, O'er woods where May her gorgeous drapery flings, And meads washed fragrant by their laughing springs. Fresh are new-opened flowers, untouched and free From the bold rifling of the amorous bee. The happy time of singing birds is come, And love's lone pilgrimage now finds a home; Among the mossy oaks now coos the dove, And the hoarse crow finds softer notes for love. The foxes play around their dens and bark In joy's excess, mid woodland shadows dark. The flowers join lips below, the leaves above, And every sound that meets the ear is love. NOVEMBER Sibyl of months, and worshipper of winds, I love thee, rude and boisterous as thou art; And scraps of joy my wandering ever finds Mid thy uproarious madnessâwhen the start Of sudden tempests stirs the forest leaves Into hoarse fury, till the shower set free Stills the huge swells. Then ebb the mighty heaves, That sway the forest like a troubled sea. I love thy wizard noise, and rave in turn Half-vacant thoughts, and rhymes of careless form: Then hide me from the shower, a short sojourn, 'Neath ivied oak; and mutter to the storm, Wishing its melody belonged to me, That I might breathe a living song to thee. MAY (II) Birds sing and build, and Nature scorns alone On May's young festival to keep a widow; The children too have pleasures all their own, A-plucking lady-smocks along the meadow. The little brook sings loud among the pebbles, So very loud that water-flowers, which lie Where many a silver curdle boils and dribbles, Dance too with joy as it goes singing by. Among the pasture mole-hills maidens stoop To pluck the luscious marjoram for their bosoms; The greensward's smothered o'er with buttercups, And whitethorns, they are breaking down with blossoms! 'Tis Nature's livery for the bonny May, Who keeps her court, and all have holiday. MAY (III) Princess of months!âso Nature's choice ordains, And lady of the summer still she reigns, In spite of April's youth, who charms in tears, And rosy June, who wins with blushing face, July, sweet shepherdess, who wreathes the shears Of shepherds with her flowers of winning grace, And sun-tanned August, with her swarthy charms, The beautiful and rich, and pastoral gay September, with her pomp of fields and farms, And wild November's sibylline array;â In spite of beauty's calendar, the year Garlands with beauty's prize the bonny May. Where'er she goes, fair Nature hath no peer, And months do lose their queen when she's away. MAY (IV) Up like a princess starts the merry morning, In draperies of many-coloured cloud; And skylarks, minstrels of the early dawning, Pipe forth their hearty anthems long and loud. The bright enamoured sunshine goes a-maying, And every flower his laughing eye beguiles; And on the milkmaid's rosy face a-playing, Pays court to beauty in its softest smiles. For May's divinity of joy begun Adds life and lustre to the golden sun; And all of life, beneath its glory straying, Is by May's beauty into worship won; Till golden eve ennobles all the west, And day goes blushing like a bride to rest. MORNING The morning now right earlily in dew Bathed her sweet naked limbs of fairest hue, While like a veil all careless thrown aback On her white shoulders hung her hair so black; And when the sun a minute earlier rose The lovely morning sought her cloudy clothes, But finding none she hasting shrank away; For night abashed had startled into day. The sun reigned absolute in cloudless sky And wooed morn's timid beauty to comply, And scarlet as the dress she earlier wore Her white face turned that was so fair before; While fear in every limb diffused its charms As soft she sighed and melted in his arms.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The Poems of JOHN CLARE INSECTS These tiny loiterers on the barley's beard, And happy units of a numerous herd Of playfellows, the laughing summer brings, Mocking the sunshine in their glittering wings, How merrily they creep, and run, and fly! No kin they bear to labour's drudgery, Smoothing the velvet of the pale hedge-rose; And where they fly for dinner no one knowsâ The dew-drops feed them notâthey love the shine Of noon, whose sun may bring them golden wine. All day they're playing in their Sunday dressâ Till night goes sleep, and they can do no less; Then, to the heath-bell's silken hood they fly, And like to princes in their slumbers lie, Secure from night, and dropping dews, and all, In silken beds and roomy painted hall. So merrily they spend their summer day, Now in the cornfields, now the new-mown hay, One almost fancies that such happy things, With coloured hoods and richly burnished wings, Are fairy folk, in splendid masquerade Disguised, as if of mortal folk afraid, Keeping their merry pranks a mystery still, Lest glaring day should do their secrets ill. CHILDHOOD When we look back on what we were And feel what we are now, A fading leaf is not so drear Upon a broken bough; A winter seat without a fire, A cold world without friends, Doth not such chilly glooms impart As that one word portends. Like withered wreaths in banquet halls When all the rout is past, Like sunshine that on ruins falls, Our pleasures are at last; The joy is fled, the love is cold, And beauty's splendour too, Our first believings all are old, And faith itself untrue. How oft we clomb the porch to cut Our names upon the leads, Though fame or anything akin Was never in our heads; Where hands and feet were rudely drawn And names we could not spell, We thought no artist in the world Could ever do as well. We twirled our tops that spun so well They scarce could tumble down, And thought they twirled as well again When riddled on the crown; And bee-spell marbles, bound to win As by a potent charm, Were often wetted in the mouth To show the dotted swarm. We pelted at the weathercock, And he who pelted o'er Was reckoned as a mighty man And even something more. We leapt across âcat-gallows sticks,â And mighty proud was he Who overshot the famous nicks That reached above his knee. And hopscotch too, a spur to joyâ We thought the task divine To hop and kick the stone right out And never touch a line. And then we walked on mighty stilts, Scarce seven inches high, Yet on we stalked and thought ourselves Already at the sky. Our pride to reason would not shrink In these exalted hours; A giant's was a pigmy link To statures such as ours. We even fancied we could fly âAnd fancy then was true: So with the clouds upon the sky In dreams at night we flew. We shot our arrows from our bows, Like any archers proud, And thought when lost they went so high To lodge upon a cloud; And these seemed feats that none before Ourselves could e'er attain, And Wellington with all his feats Felt never half so vain. And oft we urged the barking dog, For mischief was our glee, To chase the cat up weed-green walls And mossy apple-tree; When her tail stood like a bottle brush With fearâwe laughed again. Like tyrants, we could purchase mirth And ne'er allow for pain. Our fancies made us great and rich, No bounds our wealth could fix, A stool drawn round the room was soon A splendid coach and six. The magic of our minds was great, And even pebbles, they, Soon as we chose to call them gold, Grew guineas in our play. And carriages of oyster shells, Though filled with naught but stones, Grew instant ministers of state, While clay kings filled their thrones. Like Cinderella's fairy queen, Joy would our wants bewitch; If wealth was sought, the dust and stones Turned wealth and made us rich. The mallow seed became a cheese, The henbanes loaves of bread, A burdock leaf our table-cloth On a table-stone was spread. The bindweed flower that climbs the hedge Made us a drinking-glass, And there we spread our merry feast Upon the summer grass. A henbane root could scarcely grow, A mallow shake its seeds; The insects that might feed thereon Found famine in the weeds. But, like the pomp of princely taste That humbler life annoys, We thought not of our neighbours' wants While we were wasting joys. We often tried to force the snail To leave his harvest horn By singing that the beggar-man Was coming for his corn. We thought we forced the lady-cow To tell the time of day, 'Twas one o'clock and two o'clock. And then she flew away. We bawled to beetles as they ran That their children were all gone, Their houses down and door-key hid Beneath the golden stone. They seemed to haste as fast again While we shouted as they past With mirth half mad to think our tale Had urged their speed so fast. The stonecrop that on ruins comes And hangs like golden ballsâ How oft to reach its shining blooms We scaled the mossy walls! And weedsâwe gathered weeds as well, Of all that bore a flower, And tied our little posies up Beneath the eldern bower. Our little gardens there we made Of blossoms all arow, And though they had no roots at all We hoped to see them grow; And in the cart-rut after showers Of sudden summer rain We filled our tiny waterpots And cherished them in vain. We pulled the moss from apple-trees And gathered bits of straws, When weary twirling of our tops And shooting of our taws. We made birds' nests and thought that birds Would like them ready made, And went full twenty times a day To see if eggs were laid. The long and swaly willow row Where we for whips would climbâ How sweet their shadows used to grow In merry harvest time! We pulled boughs down and made a swee, Snug hid from toil and sun, And up we tossed right merrily Till weary with the fun. On summer eves with wild delight We bawled the bat to spy, Who in the âI spyâ dusky light Shrieked loud and flickered by. And up we knocked our shuttlecocks And tried to hit the moon, And wondered bats should fly so long And they come down so soon. We sought for nuts in secret nook We thought none else could find, And listened to the laughing brook And mocked the singing wind. We gathered acorns ripe and brown That hung too high to pull, Which friendly winds would shake adown Till all had pockets full. Then, loading home at day's decline, Each sought his corner stool; Then went to bed till morning came And crept again to school. Yet there by pleasure unforsook In nature's happy moods The cuts in Fenning's spelling-book Made up for fields and woods. Each noise that breathed around us then Was magic all and song; Wherever pastime found us then Joy never led us wrong. The wild bees, in the blossom hung, The coy bird's startled call To find its home in dangerâthere Was music in them all. And o'er the first bumbarrel's nest We wondered at the spell That birds who served no prenticeship Could build their nests so well; And, finding linnets moss was green, And finches choosing grey, And every finchs nest alike, Our wits were all away. Then blackbirds lining theirs with grass And thrushes theirs with dungâ So for our lives we could not tell From whence the wisdom sprung. We marvelled much how little birds Should ever be so wise; And so we guessed some angel came To teach them from the skies. In winter too we traced the fields And still felt summer joys. We sought our hips and felt no cold; Cold never came to boys. The sloes appeared as choice as plums When bitten by the frost, And crabs grew honey in the mouth When apple time was past. We rolled in sunshine lumps of snow And called them mighty men, And, tired of pelting Buonaparte, We ran to slide agen; And ponds for glibbest ice we sought With shouting and delight, And tasks of spelling all were left To get by heart at night. And when it came, and round the fire We sat, what joy was there! The kitten dancing round the cork That dangled from a chair; While we our scraps of paper burnt To watch the flitting sparks, And Collect books were often torn For parsons and for clerks. Naught seemed too hard for us to do But the sums upon our slate, Naught seemed too hard for us to win But the master's chair of state. The âTown of Troyâ we tried and made When our sums we could not try, While we envied e'en the sparrows wings From our prison house to fly. When twelve o'clock was counted out, The joy and strife began, The shut of books, the hearty shout, As out of doors we ran. Sunshine and showers who could withstand? Our food and rapture they; We took our dinners in our hands To lose no time in play. The morn when first we went to schoolâ Who can forget the morn When the birch whip lay upon the clock And our horn-book it was torn? We tore the little pictures out, Less fond of books than play, And only took one letter home And that the letter âA.â I love in childhood's little book To read its lessons through, And o'er each pictured page to look Because they read so true; And there my heart creates anew Love for each trifling thingâ Who can disdain the meanest weed That shows its face at spring? The daisy looks up in my face As long ago it smiled; It knows no change, but keeps its place And takes me for a child. The chaffinch in the hedgerow thorn Cries âpink, pink, pinkâ to hear My footsteps in the early morn, As though a boy was near. I seek no more the finch's nest Nor stoop for daisy flowers; I grow a stranger to myself In these delightful hours. Yet when I hear the voice of spring I can but call to mind The pleasures which they used to bring, The joys I used to find. The firetail on the orchard wall Keeps at its startled cry Of âtweet, tut, tut,â nor sees the morn Of boyhood's mischief by; It knows no change of changing time, By sickness never stung, It feeds on hope's eternal prime Around its brooded young. Ponds where we played at duck-and-drake, Where the ash with ivy grew, Where we robbed the owl of all her eggs And mocked her as she flew, The broad tree in the spinney hedge 'Neath which the gipsies lay, Where we our fine oak-apples got On the twenty-ninth of Mayâ These all remain as then they were And are not changed a day, And the ivy's crown's as near to green As thine is to the grey; It shades the pond, o'erhangs the stile, And the oak is in the glen; But the paths to joy are so worn out I can't find one agen. The merry wind still sings the song As if no change had been; The birds build nests the summer long, The trees look full as green As e'er they did in childhood's joy, Though that hath long been by, When I a happy roving boy In the fields had used to lie, To tend the restless roving sheep Or lead the quiet cow. Toils that seemed more than slavery then, How more than freedom now, Could we but feel as then we did When joy, too fond to fly, Would flutter round as soon as bid And drive all troubles by. But rainbows on an April cloud And blossoms pluckt in May And painted eves that summer brings Fade not so fast away; Though grass is green, though flowers are gay, And everywhere they be, What are the leaves on branches hung Unto the withered tree? Life's happiest gifts and what are they? Pearls by the morning strung, Which ere the noon are swept away, Short as a cuckoo's song. A nightingale's the summer is; Can pleasure make us proud To think when swallows fly away They leave her in her shroud? THE VOICE OF NATURE There is a language wrote on earth and sky By God's own pen in silent majesty; There is a voice that's heard and felt and seen In spring's young shades and summer's endless green; There is a book of poesy and spells In which that voice in sunny splendour dwells; There is a page in which that voice aloud Speaks music to the few and not the crowd; Though no romantic scenes my feet have trod, The voice of nature as the voice of God Appeals to me in every tree and flower, Breathing his glory, magnitude and power. In nature's open book I read, and see Beauty's rich lesson in this seeming-pea; Crowds see no magic in the trifling thing; Pshaw! 'tis a weed, and millions came with spring. I hear rich music wheresoe'er I look, But heedless worldlings chide the brawling brook; And that small lark between me and the sky Breathes sweetest strains of morning's melody; Yet by the heedless crowd 'tis only heard As the small warbling of a common bird That o'er the plough teams hails the morning sun; They see no music from such magic won. Yet I see melody in nature's laws, Or do I dream?âstill wonder bids me pause: I pause, and hear a voice that speaks aloud: 'Tis not on earth nor in the thundercloud; The many look for soundâ'tis silence speaks, And song like sunshine from her rapture breaks. I hear it in my bosom ever near; 'Tis in these winds, and they are everywhere. It casts around my vision magic spells And makes earth heaven where poor fancy dwells. I read its language, and its speech is joy; So, without teaching when a lonely boy, Each weed to me did happy tidings bring, And laughing daisies wrote the name of spring, And God's own language unto nature given Seemed universal as the light of heaven And common as the grass upon the plain, That all may read and meet with joy again, Save the unheeding heart that, like the tomb, Shuts joy in darkness and forbids its bloom. WALKS IN THE WOODS Oh, I do love to force a way Through woods where lone the woodman goes, Through all the matted shades to stray, The brambles tearing at my clothes; And it may tear; I love the noise And hug the solitary joys. The woodman, he from top to toe In leathern doublet brushes on; He cares not where his rambles go, Thorns, briers, he beats them every one; Their utmost spite his armour foils; Unhurt, he dares his daily toils. Knee-deep in fern he daily stoops And loud his bill or hatchet chops, As snug he trims the faggot up Or gaps in mossy hedges stops; While echo chops as he hath done As if she counted every one. Through thickest shades I love to go Where stovens, foiled to get above, Cramp, crook, and form so thick below Fantastic arbours.âOh, I love To sit me there till fancy weaves Rich joys beneath a world of leaves. The moss stump grows the easiest chair; Agen its grain my back reclines; And woodbine's twisted fragrance there In many a yellow cluster shines; The lonesome bees that hither stray Seem travellers that lose their way. The speedy hawthorn, first of all To show the spring its tender green, Here in the way, where branches fall Thornless and smooth, is vulgar seen; Yet in its roots of safety sure The rabbit burrow lies secure. A quiet comes across the mind With every ruffled thought subdued When fields and light are left behind And twilight leadeth through the wood; Parting the branches as we go, We sometimes meet a path below, A little path that shadows plain That other feet have gone before; Yet through such boughs it creeps again As if no feet could find it more; Yet trodden on till nearly bare It shows that feet oft trample there; Where stickers stroll from day to day And gather loads of rotten wood, And poachers left in safety stray When midnight wears its darkest mood; When badgers howl and foxes bark, Then plops the gun; the thicket dark Seems frighted at unwonted sound, That echo scarcely dares again To call, but mutters slowly round What day would answer loud and plain; She seems in fear and dread to lie When by their dens the badgers cry. But day has naught to do with fears, The green light every sound enjoys; Boys on the woodside gate he hears And echo shouts as well as boys; They tumble down and laugh amain And wonder who can laugh again. I brush alongâthe rustling sound Makes jay-birds scream and swop away, A warning to the birds around That danger rustles in the way; The blackbird answers, but the rest Start silent from each mossy nest, So manyâup one starts agen, A blackbird with its spotted breast From hazels o'er a badger's den; Here's five warm eggs within the nest With spots of brown and bluish grey; No boys will find them out to-day. Where open spots can meet the sky, Sweet resting-places seldom found, Wild strawberries entertain the eye With crimson berry shining round, Uncropt, unlooked-for, and unknown, So birds have gardens of their own. Hid round with taper ashen poles, Where deep in earth the stoven shoots, There grunting badgers burrow holes And bare the twisted mossy roots; In the fresh mould are plainly seen Footmarks when daylight hurried in. A noise in oaks above the head Keeps tapping on from day to day; Woodpeckers' nests are nearly made, And patient carpenters are they; In hardest oaks their whimbles go And dust like sawdust lies below. Where ashen stovens taper grow, The squirrels' nest upon the top Is seenâand if one shakes below, From branch to branch they out and hop, And up the oak trunks, mealy white, They're in a moment out of sight. Those sweet excesses oft will start When happy feelings cross the mind, That fill with calmness all the heart When all around one boughs are twined, When naught but green leaves fill the eye When brushing ash and hazel by, Cornel and thorn and spindle tree, And hazel with the nuts in bud, And crab and lime that well agree To make a host of underwood; It doth one's spirits good to go Through beds of fern that fan below. The rustle that the branches make While giving way to let me through, The leaves that for a moment shake As out a blackbird hasty flewâ Oh, there is stillness in the noise That brings to quiet many joys. Yes, as the bouncing branches start And backward hurry to their place, A rapture rushes at the heart, A joy comes flushing in the face; I feel so glad I can't explain My joy, and on I rush again. And now I meet a stoven full Of clinging woodbines all in flower; They look so rich and beautifulâ Though loath to spoil so sweet a bowerâ My fingers itch to pull them down To take a handful to the town. So then I mix their showy bloom With many pleasant-looking things, And fern leaves in my posy come; And then so beautifully clings The heart-leaved bryony round the tree, It too must in a posy be. Enchanter's nightshade, some few sprigs âSo sweet a spot it blossoms inâ And within reach the leafiest twigs Of oak, if such my reach can win; And still unwilling to give o'er I stoop till I can hold no more. Then by the sun I homeward stray, And then the woodman at his toil I hear him chop and guess the way, Who when I reach the side will smile And wonder why a man should roam And take such childish trifles home. WILL-O'-WISP I've seen the midnight morris-dance of hell On the black moors while thicker darkness fell, Like dancing lamps or bounding balls of fire, Now in and out, now up and down, now higher, As though an unseen horseman in his flight Flew swinging up and down a lamp alight; Then fixed, as though it feared its end to meet, It shone as lamps shine in a stilly street; Then all at once it shot and danced anew, Till mixed with darkness out of sight it grew. The simple shepherd under fear's eclipse Views the dread omens of these will-o'-wisps And thinks them haunting spirits of the earth That shine where midnight murders had their birth; With souls of midnight and with heads of fire To him they shine, and bound o'er moor and mire, Blazing like burning, crackling wisps of straw; He sees and hears them, then with sudden awe He pictures thieves with lanthorn light in hand, That in lone spots for murder waiting stand. Upon the meadow bridge's very wall He sees a lanthorn stand, and pictures all The muttered voices that derange his ears; And when more near the spot, his sickening fears See the imagined lanthorn, light and all, Without a plash into the water fall, And in one moment on his stifled sight It blanks his hopes and sets his terrors right. For furlongs off it simmers up and down, A will-o'-wisp; and breathless to the town He hastes, and hardly dares to catch his breath, Existing like a doubt of life or death Until the sight of houses cools his fears And fireside voices greet his happy ears. And then he rubs his hands beside his fire, And quakes, and tells how over moor and mire The jack-o'-lanthorn with his burning tails Had like to led him; and he bites his nails With very fear to think out how the blaze Had like to cheat him into dangerous ways: How that he thought he heard some people stand As likely thieves with lanthorn in their hand, When in a momentâyet he heard no fallâ Down went the lanthorn from the arches' wall Into the flood; and on that brig alone How his heart seemed as growing into stone. THE MOLE-CATCHER I When melted snow leaves bare the black-green rings, And grass begins in freshening hues to shoot, When thawing dirt to shoes of ploughmen clings, And silk-haired moles get liberty to root, An ancient man goes plodding round the fields Which solitude seems claiming as her own, Wrapt in greatcoat that from a tempest shields, Patched thick with every colour but its own. With spud and traps and horsehair string supplied, He potters out to seek each fresh-made hill; Pricking the greensward where they love to hide, He sets his treacherous snares, resolved to kill; And on the willow sticks bent to the grass, That such as touched jerk up in bouncing springs, Soon as the little hermit tries to pass, His little carcass on the gibbet hings. And as a triumph to his matchless skill, On some grey willow where a road runs by, That passers may behold his power to kill, On the bough's twigs he'll many a felon tie; On every common dozens may be met, Dangling on bent twigs bleaching to the sun, Whose melancholy fates meet no regret, Though dreamless of the snare they could not shun. On moors and commons and the pasture green, He leaves them undisturbed to root and run, Enlarging hills that have for ages been Basking in mossy swellings to the sun; The pismires too their tip-tops yearly climb To lay their eggs and hunt the shepherd's crumbs, Never disturbed save when for summer thyme The trampling sheep upon their dwelling comes. II He leans on nature's offerings for supply, Like a sick child upon a mother's breast; He feebly watches her unheeding eye, And takes her givings with no vain request To urge them better; he with aught is blest; For the to-morrow he ne'er feels a fear, His hopes upon to-day have all their rest; When labour fails, the workhouse fare is near; And thus on misery's edge he potters round the year. Spring yearly meets him with his shouldered rake To drag the crowding cresses from the brook, And soon as May's first mornings are awake, He threads the pasture, pewit's eggs to look; And when these fail, the moor-pond's flaggy nook Is beat for leeches; then the mushrooms start In black-green fairy ring; thus nature's book Is turned till he earth's lesson knows by heart, In life's rude patchwork play to act the allotted part. And in the meadows when the grass is mown, He haunts the holes torn up by many a flood, With swordy flag and reed and rush o'ergrown, Progging the bladed greave about the mud, Scaring full oft the moor-hen's summer brood, Trying to catch the slipping eels in vain; While, watching by the hedge's crowding wood Of reeds, starts up the solitary crane, Like hermit pilgrim [wandering] on some lonely plain. And while his snuff-box offers its supply, Complaint can never o'er his heart prevail; Pulled out and pinched by every passer-by, It always doth his weary walks regale, And adds a tiresome length to every tale; But in its need he mopes o'er field and town, His strength sinks in him and his spirits fail; In silent pace he potters up and down, And scarcely says good-morn to passing maid or clown. Want often makes him on the folded land Stoop down a turnip from the sheep to steal, Borrowing the shepherd's knife with palsied hand To clean and peel it for a morning meal. Pride's unconcern that hath no heart to feel Full often in his pottering pace appears, From whom his turnip-thefts he will conceal, Who as a tyrant wakes his humble fears, Whose proud and threatening taunts will fill his eyes with tears. For ever in his creeping path appears A waffling cur, in colour sandy grey, With curling tail and sharp fox-pointed ears, Who shows his teeth and threatens sore dismay; But if a stranger sets his rage at bay, Or stoops adown a threatening stone to throw, Will drop his tail and whine and sneak away, And linger for a while in motions slow Behind the old man's heels till past the dreaded foe. Then quickly he resumes his cheering pace, And 'gins in jealous threats his ears to prick, And barks and looks his master in the face, Who in his leisure learns him many a trick, To carry in his mouth his walking-stick, Or watch and run to fetch a pelted stone, Or from the pond whatever's thrown to pick, And on his legs to rear himself alone To beg at dinner hour for proffered crust and bone. APPROACH OF SPRING Dear heart, I love to see the quiet spring Come teaching first the little birds to sing, Then loitering in the sunny field and street Like people telling stories when they meet, And often pausing in a shower's delay As if she feared some danger in the way, Sending her heralds forward one by one To try the journey she herself is on; Now starts a daisy, then a buttercup, And then a little primrose trembles up; And thus she comes like to a timid maid Of ruffling winds and dirty roads afraid. THE PLOUGHBOY Soon the night in mantle dark Disperses at the singing lark, When the morning breaks the cloud, And the yard dog, barking loud, Calls the men and maidens up; And the fowl, a noisy crowd, From the hen-roost cackle loud, When the farm-boy blundering up Drives the old hens 'neath the coop, And from the stack, at maid's desire, Throws the faggot for the fire, Then in the hovel milks the cow And from the stackyard drives the sow; And when the chimney smokes, goes in Till breakfast's ready to begin, And in the corner grunts to stoop And does his unlaced hightops up; Then off behind the plough afield He goes, the whalebone whip to wield. DAWN Dun-grey and high the morning lies, And light spreads widely through the skies, And o'er the sloping fields of corn Gentle and sleeping lies the morn; And through the grain one's walk may go And not a dewdrop moist the shoe, For not a blade or leaflet green Deckt with a single drop is seen; The deepest woodland path is dry And not a cloud is in the sky, And yet the dun spreads far away As if 'twas all a cloud of grey. APPROACHING NIGHT Approaching night to dusky shadows grows And one dun covering huddles o'er the sky; The grey owl hoo-hoos in the elms just by, And one lone couple of unwearied crows To distant woods in sluggish motion fly Amid the fading foliage to repose. Yet still the west a streak of radiance throws Enough to see the horizon's distant rim, While all beside in aimless masses rest, Trees, fields and cottages all fading dim In seeming nothingness, by glooms deprest. FAIRY THINGS Grey lichens, mid thy hills of creeping thyme, Grow like to fairy forests hung with rime; And fairy money-pots are often found That spring like little mushrooms out of ground, Some shaped like cups and some in slender trim Wineglasses like, that to the very rim Are filled with little mystic shining seed; We thought our fortunes promising indeed, Expecting by and by ere night to find Money ploughed up of more substantial kind. Acres of little yellow weeds, The wheat-field's constant blooms, That ripen into prickly seeds For fairy curry-combs, To comb and clean the little things That draw their nightly wain; And so they scrub the beetle's wings Till he can fly again. And flannel felt for the beds of the queen From the soft inside of the shell of the bean, Where the gipsies down in the lonely dells Had littered and left the plundered sheels. FRAGMENTS Where go the swallow tribes? the pathless main Ne'er chronicles their flight; we ask in vain. Yet their light lives familiar, and the sun Is by the call of loneliest nature won To smile; and woods where man hath never been Are clothed in joy and beautified in green; Spots blooming on from time's unwitnessed springs Are fanned by these aerial wanderers' wings. The daisy wan, the primrose pale, Seem naught but white and yellow flowers To every heedless passer-by, When they attend the spring's young hours; But they are loves and friends to me, That tell me in each short sojourn Of what they felt and I did feel In springs that never will return. Where'er the present leads us, there we spy The past in mourning; how can memory die Where every foot we set or look we give Meets some crushed memory that hath ceased to live? So busy hath death been in mortal strife, Earth even fattens with the wrecks of life. How many friends death steals, how many more Doth time prove false that seemed so true before! Where's those with yesterday so warm?âgone, gone Like summer birds when winter cometh on. Gay nature's always laughing: folks may dieâ She never goes in mourning where they lie, And richest monuments that wonder reads Like common ones soon overrun with weeds; Nor should we look for troubles ere they rise: The greatest griefs will often wipe their eyes, The roughest days find out their journey's end, And those most lonely find at last a friend. Night lies as fast asleep as innocence, While the moon journeys her unnoticed way. Envy and hatred from the world's rude pack Follow success in almost every track, Like lurking winters that are sure to bring Storms to discomfort the young green of spring, Crispt brown and icicled o'er with frosty chill; But spring gets green at last as poesy will. How strange the wood appears in dark and white, And every little twig is hung with snow; The old oak tops, crampt, gnarled, and dark below, Upon their upper sides are fringed in light. Happy as ballads of a brawling boy, Who, when the wood gate bangs, we know 'tis joy That shuts it, for when shut by pain He shuts it without sound and creeps again. The sun seemed resting on the hill, Before he took his final leave, And through the leaves we saw him still Shine dropping in the dews of eve. When Pilgrim with a heavy pack Marched on for glory's town, His burthen fell from off his back And he received the crown; But poets have a donkey's fame; With little rest they tarry; For the stronger they are made by fame The heavier loads they carry. VIRTUE LIVES ON Fame will grow old like garments; time will tear The scutcheoned tinsel and make worse for wear The proudest trials to prolong their power; E'en marbles, by and by, with sculpture deckt, Shall mingle with the ashes they protect; Brass eats itself away in canker rust; Names writ on adamant shall creep to dust. A good name only has the longest run, As virtue graves it on the golden sun, Peering its influence on the happy dayâ While bad ones in night's darkness meet decay. THE SHEPHERD'S SONG Mary! let us Love employ, Among the happy smiles of May; And let us bind the wings of Joy, And keep him captive for a day. Nature in love doth now disclose Her flowers, in full ripe smiles to thee; 'Twill be too late to seek the rose When autumn-leaves have left the tree: So let us wreathe Joy's brows to-day, To-morrow he may speed away. While on this meadow-bank we sit, Mark thou the sights that might thee move; Hear how the winds, in amorous fit, Woo things inanimate to love. The bulrush bows in graceful art To kiss the river's lesser weeds; And flags in many a merry start Rustling whisper to the reeds: Shall things inanimate agree To love, unmoving thee and me? See yonder skylark from the corn Rises to sing his wedding lay; For he was wed at early morn, And twilight gave the bride away. The church above the trees doth climb, Love, promise, and we'll soon be there; 'Tis best to borrow haste from Time, If Time has present joys to spare; Nor leave Love's lot until the morrow, Who oft pays backward debts in sorrow. A WORLD FOR LOVE Oh, the world is all too rude for thee, with much ado and care; Oh, this world is but a rude world, and hurts a thing so fair; Was there a nook in which the world had never been to sear, That place would prove a paradise when thou and Love were near. And there to pluck the blackberry, and there to reach the sloe, How joyously and happily would Love thy partner go; Then rest when weary on a bank, where not a grassy blade Had e'er been bent by trouble's feet, and Love thy pillow made. For Summer would be ever green, though sloes were in their prime, And Winter smile his frowns to Spring, in beauty's happy clime; And months would come, and months would go, and all in sunny mood, And everything inspired by thee grow beautifully good. And there to seek a cot unknown to any care and pain, And there to shut the door alone on singing wind and rainâ Far, far away from all the world, more rude than rain or wind, Oh, who could wish a sweeter home, a better rest to find? Than thus to love and live with thee, thou beautiful delight! Than thus to live and love with thee the summer day and night! The Earth itself, where thou hadst rest, would surely smile to see Herself grow Eden once again, possest of Love and thee. DECAY Oh, Poesy is on the wane, For Fancy's visions all unfitting; I hardly know her face again, Nature herself seems on the flitting. The fields grow old and common things, The grass, the sky, the winds a-blowing; And spots where still a beauty clings Are sighing, âGoing! all a-going!â Oh, Poesy is on the wane, I hardly know her face again. The bank with brambles overspread, And little mole-hills round about it, Was more to me than laurel shades, With paths of gravel finely clouted; And streaking here and streaking there, Through shaven grass and many a border, With rutty lanes had no compare, And heaths were in a richer order. But Poesy is on the wane, I hardly know her face again. I sat beside the pasture stream, When Beauty's self was sitting by, The fields did more than Eden seem, Nor could I tell the reason why. I often drank when not adry To pledge her health in draughts divine; Smiles made it nectar from the sky, Love turned e'en water into wine. Oh, Poesy is on the wane, I cannot find her face again. The sun those mornings used to find, Its clouds were other-country mountains, And heaven looked downward on the mind, Like groves, and rocks, and mottled fountains. Those heavens are gone, the mountains grey Turned mistâthe sun, a homeless ranger, Pursues alone his naked way, Unnoticed like a very stranger. Oh, Poesy is on the wane, Nor love nor joy is mine again. Love's sun went down without a frown; For very joy it used to grieve us. I often think the West is gone; Ah, cruel Time, to undeceive us! The stream it is a common stream, Where we on Sundays used to ramble, The sky hangs o'er a broken dream, The bramble's dwindled to a bramble! Oh, Poesy is on the wane, I cannot find her haunts again. Mere withered stalks and fading trees, And pastures spread with hills and rushes, Are all my fading vision sees; Gone, gone are rapture's flooding gushes! When mushrooms they were fairy bowers, Their marble pillars overswelling, And Danger paused to pluck the flowers That in their swarthy rings were dwelling. Yes, Poesy is on the wane, Nor joy nor fear is mine again. Ay, Poesy hath passed away, And Fancy's visions undeceive us; The night hath ta'en the place of day, And why should passing shadows grieve us? I thought the flowers upon the hills Were flowers from Adam's open gardens; But I have had my summer thrills, And I have had my heart's rewardings. So Poesy is on the wane, I hardly know her face again. And friendship it hath burned away, Like to a very ember cooling, A make-believe on April day That sent the simple heart a-fooling; Mere jesting in an earnest way, Deceiving on and still deceiving; And hope is but a fancy-play, And joy the art of true believing; For Poesy is on the wane, Oh, could I feel her faith again! DEATH The winds and waters are in his command, Held as a courser in the rider's hand. He lets them loose, they triumph at his will: He checks their course and all is calm and still. Life's hopes waste all to nothingness away As showers at night wash out the steps of day. Death hides all failings in the lowly grave; Existence ceases, with the all we have Said, done, or thought of; there thro' years we lie More blank than shadows 'neath the smiling sky, Leaving eternity to keep the key Till judgment sets all hopes and terrors free. The tyrant, in his lawless power deterred, Bows before death, tame as a broken sword. One dieth in his strength and, torn from ease, Groans in death-pangs like tempests in the trees. Another from the bitterness of clay Falls calm as storms drop on an autumn day, With noiseless speed as swift as summer light Death slays and keeps her weapons out of sight. The tyrants that do act the gods in clay And for earth's glories throw the heavens away, Whose breath in power did like to thunder sear, When anger hurried on the heels of fear, Whose rage planned hosts of murders at a breathâ Here in sound silence sheathe their rage in death. Their feet, that crushed down freedom to its grave And felt the very earth they trod a slave, How quiet here they lie in death's cold arms Without the power to crush the feeble worms Who spite of all the dreadful fears they made Creep there to conquer and are not afraid. BIRDS' LAMENT Oh, says the linnet, if I sing, My love forsook me in the spring, And nevermore will I be seen Without my satin gown of green. Oh, says the pretty-feathered jay, Now my love is fled away For the memory of my dear A feather of each sort I'll wear. Oh, says the sparrow, my love is gone, She so much that I doted on, And e'er since for that selfsame thing I've made a vow I ne'er will sing. Oh, says the water-wag-my-tail, I courted a fair one but could not prevail, I could not with my love prevail, So that is the reason I wag my tail. Oh, says the pretty speckled thrush, That changes its note from bush to bush, My love has left me here alone And I fear she never will return. Oh, says the rook, and eke the crow, The reason why in black we goâ Because our love has us forsook, So pity us, poor crow and rook. Oh, says the owl, my love has gone, It was her I doted on; Since she has gone I know not where to follow, But after her I'll whoop and hollo. LANGLEY BUSH One summer's day in happiest mood I sat beside old Langley Bush, And o'er the furze in Hanglands Wood I listened at the singing thrush; Naught did my idle mind engross, The tiny flixweed's only flower Was there, and little beds of moss Swelled pleaching to the sunny hour. I passed it in a sicker day. The golden furze-blooms burnt the wind With sultry sweetsâand there I lay Tormented with the saddest mind; The little hill did naked lie, The old old bush was broke and gone, My heart had felt it glad to die To miss life's sorrows coming on. I looked upon its naked stump, And pictured back the fallen tree To days I played hop, skip and jump As happy as a boy could be. I turned me to that happy day I streaked beneath its mossy bough, And there came shadows of dismay, So dismally, I feel it now. I thought o'er all life's sweetest things Made dreary as a broken charm, Wood-ridings where the thrush still sings And love went leaning on my arm. I thought, and felt as desolate As want upon a winter scene, While by that broken stump I sat, The type of broken hopes within. PRAYER Thou power from whom all pleasure springs, From thraldom set the feeble free, Aid good intents on angels' wings And make each purpose worthy thee: That whatsoe'er I do or think My helpmate to life's good may be, That, like the body's meat and drink, May keep the soul in health for thee, True temperance: that in thine eyes I still may live thy daily guest, And when from table I arise Be found in thy eternal rest. I seek it in no public mood Of show, as many do their dress, I seek it with a heart subdued To almost utter hopelessness. Nor will it weaken thy esteem Or lessen favours meant for me; Hypocrisy can never seem In silence only heard by thee. HONESTY (II) The rich man claims it; but he often buys Its substitute, that is not what it seems; While poverty, ennobled in disguise, Its simple bloom oft worships and esteems. Knaves boast possession, but they forge its name; Mobs laud and praise it, but with them 'tis noise, Or the mere passport to some hidden game, Beneath whose garb self-interest lurks and lies. 'Tis by the good man only deemed a prize Too valued to be scoffed at or oppressed; 'Tis ever more respected by the wise, Though thousands treat it as a common jest: And that thou mayst not slight so grand a dower, 'Tis Honesty. Go thou, and wear the flower. SLANDER (II) It feeds on falsehood and on clamour lives, And Truth, like sunshine, dims its watering eyes; It cannot bear the searching light she gives, But in her splendour struggles, writhes, and lies A crushed and wounded worm, that vainly turns All ways for rest and ease, yet findeth none. Of its own venom-breath it wastes and burns Away, like putrid waters in the sun. It stains, as footmarks in a frosty morn, Left on the bruising grass by early swain; Truth's spring soon comes, and laughs them all to scorn; Stains disappearâthe grass is green again; And hearts that feed the falsehood Slander brings Are all that feel at last the venom of its stings. BOSTON CHURCH (II) Smiling in sunshine, as the storm frowns by, Whose dreadful rage seems to thy quiet thrall As small birds' twitterings, that beneath thee fly. Winds call aloud, and they may louder call, For, deaf to danger's voice, sublime and grand Thou tower'st in thy old majesty o'er all. Tempests, that break the tall masts like a wand, Howl their rage weary round thee; and no more Impression make than summer winds that bow The little trembling weeds upon thy wall. Lightnings have blazed their centuries round thy brow, And left no print-marks:âso in shadows hoar Time decks and spares thee, till that doom is hurled That sears the ocean dry and wrecks the world. ETERNITY OF TIME Amazing, grand eternity of time! Where things of greatest standing grow sublime, Less from long fames, and universal praise, Than wearing as the âancient of old days.â âOld days,â once spoken, seems but half the way To reach that night-leap of eternal day. Miltonic centuries, each a mighty boast, Shakespearian erasâworlds, without their host, Engraved upon the adamant of fame By pens of steel, in characters of flameâ To which the forest oaks' eternal stay Are but as points and commas in their way,â These less than nothings are to ruin's doom, When suns grow dark, and earth a vast and lonely tomb. FLATTERY Go, flattery, go, thou nothing clothed in sound, The voice of ages lives not on thy tongue; Time treads thee like a shadow on the ground As nothing were, and laugheth at the wrong. Thou ten days' wonder of an idle noise, Cease teasing truth with subtleties and lies; Truth, that thy every spider-web destroys, With higher aim bids upward thoughts arise, Where past the storm of strife, the sickly praise, The barefaced lie, in secret hatched and bred, Is left unto the storm of after days, And thy gay-fluttering streets untenanted Of friendships, age-swept, silent and alone, Buried and chilled like cities into stone. TO HEALTH Mild health, I seek thee; whither? Art thou found Mid daisies sleeping in the morning dew, Along the meadow paths where all around May smells so lovely? Thither would I go. Where art thou, envious blessing? now the cold Is gone away, and hedge and wood is seen All lovely, and the gay marsh marigold Edges the meadow lakes so freshly green, My straining eye is anxious to behold Thee up and journeying on the swallow's wing, To see thee up and shining everywhere Among the sweet companions of the spring. ENGLAND, 1830 These vague allusions to a country's wrongs, Where one says âAyâ and others answer âNoâ In contradiction from a thousand tongues, Till like to prison-cells her freedoms grow Becobwebbed with these oft-repeated songs Of peace and plenty in the midst of woeâ And is it thus they mock her year by year, Telling poor truth unto her face she lies, Declaiming of her wealth with gibe severe, So long as taxes drain their wished supplies? And will these jailers rivet every chain Anew, yet loudest in their mockery be, To damn her into madness with disdain, Forging new bonds and bidding her be free? MAY All nature breathes of joy and hails the May; The very flowers nod dances to the wind, The fluttering birds about the bushes play That shine like sheets of snow with flowers belined, Thro' schoolhouse door; in wandering fancy's way, The boy repeats his play-games in his mind, And builds anew his huts of stone and clay, That freedom left, when school hours called away, By some barn wall or low cot's sunny side. Among the pasture mole-hills madly play The wool-wrapt-leggÃ¨d lambs, and in gay pride The wild foal gallops with excess of joy, And happy moos the calf in colours pied, Ignorant of cares that human peace destroy. SPRING MORNING How beautiful is daybreak! light betimes Threads thro' the clouds; the red sun sweetly climbs Up to our chamber windows; thwart the sky The clouds like bright volcanoes slumber by Slowly and grand. Toil, early out of doors, Goes praising the sweet time devoid of sorrow And prophesies the cuckoo's song to-morrow. Birds hop about each hedge, and by the stack The small wren twits with tail cocked o'er his back, Building his nest right early 'neath the shed Where cows in winter found a pleasant bed. Flowers thicken everywhere; the very tops Of walls are thronged with spring's delicious crops Of tiny snow-white blossoms thickly spread. SPRING SONGS The blossom-burthened, never-weary May Again with nature's folks keeps holiday; Trees hide themselves in green, and happy birds Sing sweeter songs that can be breathed in words; The very winds sing sonnets to the sky, And sunshine bids them welcomeâso that I Feel a new being, as from healthier climes, And shape my idle fancies into rhymes Of nature's ecstasy in bursting flowers, And birds nest-building, and sunshiny showers That on the south-west wind in singing moods Sprinkle their drops like manna o'er the woods, Where I still love my careless limbs to fling Among the shadows of young leafy spring. LIFE IN LONE PLACES I've felt the loneliest pictures in my mind When in a nook, a very dread by day, I've found a scarce-dead night-fire left behind Where robbers hurdled or where gipsies lay; And I have turned me round a different way, Half fearing lest a danger lingered still, And almost dreaded further on to stray Lest lurking mischief hid, devising ill; Feeling like someone in a dreadful book, Thinking how dismal such a spot would be In midnight darkness, when lone travellers look Up to their hands and yet can nothing see, While all is black and deep and still as death, And fear e'en startles at its stifled breath. THE BOYS' PLAYGROUND Here lies the germ and happiness of lifeâ The foot-beat playground of the village boys; Echo is weary of the rapturous strife, And almost fades 'neath the excessive noise; Some race at leap-frog o'er each other's back, Some chase their shadows in the evening sun, Some play at hare and hounds, a noisy pack, Or âDuck, duck under waterâ shout, and run; Others at hopscotch try their cautious skill, Or nine-peg morris cut on grassy hill; Astraddle upon clapping gates some swee, Or tie the branches down of willow tree. A passing-bell scarce makes a deeper sigh Than the remembrances of days gone by. WINTER SNOWSTORM (II) One almost sees the hermit from the wood Come bending with his sticks beneath his arm, And then the smoke curl up its dusky flood From the white little roof his peace to warm; One shapes his books, his quiet, and his joys, And in romances' world-forgetting mood The scene so strange so fancy's mind employs It seems heart-aching for his solitude: Domestic spots near home and trod so oft, Seen daily, known for yearsâby the strange wand Of winter's humour changed; the little croft Left green at night, when morn's loath looks obtrude, Trees, bushes, grass, to one wild garb subdued, Have gone and left us in another land. ASHTON LAWN (II) In Ashton Lawn, condemned to slow decay, Close to the south-east nook, a ruined hill Lies choked in thorns and briers: yet to this day Reality may trace the castle still. A fragment of the moat still forms a pond, Beset with hoof-tracked paths of horse and cow, That often go to drink; and all beyond Greensward with little mole-hills on its brow, And fairy-rings in its old mystery dark, Still wears its ancient name, and shepherds call The closen all around it still âOld Park,â Still traced by buried fragments of a wall. The castle's self will soon be nothing's heir, Peckt up to mend old roads, old garden walls repair. JUNE Go where I will, naught but delight is seen; The blue and luscious sky is one broad gleam Of universal ecstasy; the green, Rich, sweeping meadows and the laughing stream, As sweet as happiness on heaven's breast, Lie listening to the never-ceasing song That day or night ne'er wearies into rest But hums unceasingly the summer long. The very grass, to music's rapture stirred, Dances before the breeze's wanton wing, While every bush stirs with a startled bird Who eager wakes morn's dewy praise to sing. Yet mid this summer glee I cannot borrow One joy, for sadness chills them all to sorrow. SUMMER AMUSEMENTS I love to hide me on a spot that lies In solitudes where footsteps find no track To make intrusions; there to sympathize With nature: often gazing on the rack That veils the blueness of the summer skies In rich varieties; or o'er the grass Behold the spangled crowds of butterflies Flutter from flower to flower, and things that pass In urgent travel by my still retreat, The bustling beetle tribes; and up the stem Of bents see lady-cows with nimble feet Climb tall church-steeple heightsâor more to themâ Till at its quaking top they take their seat, Which bows, and off they fly fresh happiness to meet. FIELD FLOWERS Hark from amid the corn that happy brawl! 'Tis village children running after flowers. To this void bosom how the sounds recall Memories again of childhood's merry hours; When thro' the garden pales or o'er the wall We reached at garden flowers with eager hands, Or boldly sought the field flowers free for all, Wading breast-high amid the green corn-lands For crimson poppies and corn-bottles blue, Startling the partridge covey unawares, That o'er our head in wild disorder flew. Here we, like them, were blest; life laid no snares To rob our joys; he was a partner too. Why did he turn a foe and fill our path with cares? SUMMER The woodman's axe renews its hollow stroke, And barkmen's noises in the woods awake, Ripping the stained bark from the fallen oak, Where crumpled fox-fern and the branching brake Fade 'neath their crushing feet. The timid hare Starts from its mossy root or sedgy seat, And listening foxes leave their startled lair And to some blackthorn's spinney make retreat. Haymakers with their shouldered rakes sojourn To hedgy closes, and amid the wheat The schoolboy runs, while pleasures thickly burn Around his heart, to crop corn-bottle flowers, Scaring the partridge from its quiet bourn, That hides for shelter from the summer heat. THE WOODLAND STILE When one's been walking in the open plain, Where the sun ne'er winks his eye, 'tis sweet awhile To meet the shadows of a narrow lane Or quiet arbour of a woodland stile, To sit and hear the little bees complain Among the woodbine blossoms o'er their toil, And the hoarse murmurs of the distant swain, Driving his horses o'er the sunburnt soil; While shadows hide me and leaves entertain My fancies with their freaks around my seat, Dancing and whispering with the wooing wind Like lovers o'er their secrets; while the heat Glimmers without and can no passage find To hurt the joys which rest so longed to meet. A HARVEST MORNING The mist hangs thick about the early field, And many a shout is heard while naught appears Till close upon the gaze, so thick concealed Are things in morning's mistâmayhap her tears For summer's sad departure. Silence hears Brown harvest's ditties that disturb full soon Her restâtoil's lusty brawl that daily cheers Its ignorance of sorrow with the boon Of pastoral tunes. Ere morn's red sun appears, Till dreary evening's ruddy harvest moon Hangs its red lamp to light them home again, The little children in their harvest dress Among the stubs of trifling ills complain. STEPPING-STONES Those stepping-stones, that stride the meadow-streams, Look picturesque amid spring's golden gleams, Where steps the traveller with a weary pace; And boy, with laughing leisure in his face, Sits on the midmost stone, in very whim, To catch the struttles that beneath him swim. Even stones across the hollow lakes are bare, And winter floods no more rave dangers there; But, mid the scum left where it roared and fell, The schoolboy hunts to find the pooty shell. Yet there the boisterous geese, with golden broods, Hiss fierce and daring in their summer moods: The boys pull off their hats, while passing by, In vain to frightâthemselves being forced to fly. THE FAIRY-RINGS (I) Here on the greensward, mid the old mole-hills, Where ploughshares never come to hurt the things Antiquity hath charge of, fear instils Her footsteps, and the ancient fairy-rings Shine black, and fresh, and round; the gipsy's fire, Left yesternight, scarce leaves more proof behind Of midnight sports, when they from day retire, Than in these rings my fancy seems to find Of fairy revels; and I stoop to see Their little footmarks in each circling stain, And think I hear them, in their summer glee, Wishing for night, that they may dance again; Till shepherds' tales, told 'neath the leaning tree While shunning showers, seem Bible-truths to meâ THE FAIRY-RINGS (II) Ay, almost Scripture-truths! My poorer mind Grows into worship of these mysteries, While fancy doth her ancient scrolls unbind That time hath hid in countless centuries; And when the morning's mist doth leave behind The fuzz-ball round, and mushroom white as snow, They strike me, to romantic moods inclined, As shadows of things modelled long ago: Halls, palaces, and marble-columned domes, And modern shades of fairies' ancient homes, Erected in these rings and pastures still, For midnight balls and revelry; and then Left like the ruins of all ancient skill, To wake the wonder of mere common men. THE FLOOD (II) Those wrecky stains dart on the floods away More swift than shadows on a stormy day. Things trail and turn and steadyâall in vain; The engulfing arches shoot them quickly through; The feather dances, flutters, and again Darts through the deepest dangers still afloat, Seeming as fairies whisked it from the view And danced it o'er the waves as pleasure's boat, Light-hearted as a merry thought in May. Trays, uptorn bushes, fence-demolished rails, Loaded with weeds, in sluggish motions stray; Like water monsters lost, each winds and trails Till near the archesâthen as in affright It plunges, reels, and shudders out of sight. THE FLOOD (III) Waves trough, rebound, and furious boil again, Like plunging monsters rising underneath, Who at the top curl up a shaggy mane, A moment catching at a surer breath, Then plunging headlong down and down and on, Each following boil the shadow of the last; And other monsters rise when those are gone, Crest their fringed waves, plunge onward, and are past. The chill air comes around me ocean-blea, From bank to bank the water-strife is spread; Strange birds like snow-spots o'er the huzzing sea Hang where the wild duck hurried past and fled. On roars the flood, all restless to be free, Like troubles wandering to eternity. SHEPHERD'S HUT (II) Those rude old tales!âman's memory augurs ill Thus to forget the fragments of old days, Those long old songs; their sweetness haunts me still, Nor did they perish for my lack of praise. But old disciples of the pasture sward, Rude chroniclers of ancient minstrelsy, The shepherds, vanished all; and disregard Left their old music, like a vagrant bee, For summer's breeze to murmur o'er and die. And in these ancient spots mind, ear, and eye Turn listeners, till the very wind prolongs The theme, as wishing, in its depths of joy, To recollect the music of old songs, And meet the hut that blessed me when a boy. A WOODLAND SEAT (II) Observe the flowers around us, how they live Not only for themselves, as we may feel, But for the joy which they to others give; For Nature never will her gifts conceal From those who love to seek them. Here amid These trees, how many blooms disclose their pride, From the unthinking rustic only hid, Who never turns him from the road aside To look for beauties which he values not. It gives one greater zest to feel the joys We meet in this sweet solemn-suited spot; And with high ecstasy one's mind employs To bear the worst that fickle life prepares, Finding her sweets as common as her cares. A WOODLAND SEAT (III) In every trifle something lives to please Or to instruct us. Every weed and flower Heirs beauty as a birthright, by degrees Of more or less; though taste alone hath power To see and value what the herd pass by. This common dandelionâmark how fine Its hue!âthe shadow of the day's proud eye Glows not more rich of gold: that nettle there, Trod down by careless rustics every hourâ Search but its slighted blooms, kings cannot wear Robes prankt with half the splendour of a flower, Pencilled with hues of workmanship divine, Bestowed to simple things, denied to power, And sent to gladden hearts as mean as mine. SWORDY WELL I've loved thee, Swordy Well, and love thee still. Long was I with thee, tending sheep and cow, In boyhood ramping up each steepy hill To play at âroly-polyâ down; and now, A man, I trifle on thee, cares to kill, Haunting thy mossy steeps to botanize And hunt the orchis tribes, where nature's skill Doth, like my thoughts, run into phantasies, Spider and bee all mimicking at will, Displaying powers that fool the proudly wise, Showing the wonders of great nature's plan In trifles insignificant and small, Puzzling the power of that great trifle, man, Who finds no reason to be proud at all. MARCH The insect world, now sunbeams higher climb, Oft dream of spring, and wake before their time: Bees stroke their little legs across their wings, And venture short flights where the snowdrop hings Its silver bell, and winter aconite Its buttercup-like flowers that shut at night, With green leaf furling round its cup of gold, Like tender maiden muffled from the cold; They sip and find their honey-dreams are vain, Then feebly hasten to their hives again. The butterflies, by eager hopes undone, Glad as a child come out to greet the sun, Beneath the shadows of a sunny shower Are lost, nor see to-morrow's April flower. ADIEU TO MY FALSE LOVE FOR EVER The week before Easter, the days long and clear, So bright shone the sun and so cool blew the air, I went in the meadow some flowers to find there, But the meadow would yield me no posies. The weather, like love, did deceitful appear, And I wandered for joy when my sorrow was near, For the thorn that wounds deeply doth bide the whole year, When the bush it is naked of roses. I courted a girl that was handsome and gay, I thought her as constant and true as the day, Till she married for riches and said my love nay, And so my poor heart got requited. I was bid to the bridal; I could not say no; The bridemen and maidens they made a fine show; I smiled like the rest, but my heart it was low, To think how its hopes they were blighted. The bride started gaily, the weather was fine, Her parents looked after, and thought her divine; She smiled in their faces, but looked not in mine; Indeed, I'd no heart to regard her. Though love like the poplar doth lift its head high, The top it may fade and the root it may die, And they may have heart-aches that now live in joy, But Heaven I'll leave to reward her. When I saw my false love in the merry church stand, With her ring on her finger and her love in her hand, Smiling out in the joy of her houses and land, My sighs I strove vainly to smother. When my false love for dinner did take the first seat, I sat me down also, but nothing could eat; I thought her sweet company better than meat, Although she was tied to another. When my false love had gone to her bride-bed at night, My eyes filled with water made double my sight; I thought she was there when she'd bade us âGood nightâ And her chair was put by till the morrow. I drank to her joy with a tear on my face, And the wineglass as usual I pushed in the space, Nor knew she was gone till I looked at the place, Such a fool was I made of by sorrow. When the maidens went laughing to see her to bed, To untie her apron and undress her head, I sighed out aloud, for my heart it was dead To think not a kiss I might give her. Now make me a bed in yon river so deep, Let its waves be my mourners; naught living will weep; And there let me lie and take a long sleep, So adieu to my false love for ever. A FAITHLESS SHEPHERD A faithless shepherd courted me, He stole away my liberty. When my poor heart was strange to men, He came and smiled and stole it then. When my apron would hang low, Me he sought through frost and snow. When it puckered up with shame, And I sought him, he never came. When summer brought no fears to fright, He came to guard me every night. When winter nights did darkly prove, None came to guard me or to love. I wish, I wish, but all in vain, I wish I was a maid again. A maid again I cannot be, Oh, when will green grass cover me? I wish my babe had ne'er been born, I've made its pillow on a thorn, I wish my sorrows all away, My soul with God, my body clay. He promised beds as fine as silk And sheets for love as white as milk, But when he'd won my heart away Left me to want a bed of clay. He kept his sheep on yonder hill, His heart seemed soft but it was steel; I ran with love and was undone, Oh, had I walked ere I did run! He has two hearts and I have none, He'll be a rogue, when I am gone, To thee my baby, unto thee, As he has been too long to me. I weep the past, I dread the gloom Of sorrows in the time to come, When thou without a friend shalt be, Weeping on a stranger's knee. I wish, my child, thou'dst ne'er been born, I've made thy pillow on a thorn, I wish our sorrows both away, Our souls with God, our bodies clay. O SILLY LOVE! O CUNNING LOVE! O silly love! O cunning love! An old maid to trepan: I cannot go about my work For loving of a man. I cannot bake, I cannot brew, And, do the best I can, I burn the bread and chill the mash, Through loving of a man. Shrove Tuesday last I tried and tried To turn the cakes in pan, And dropt the batter on the floor, Through thinking of a man. My mistress screamed, my master swore, Boys cursed me in a troop; The cat was all the friends I had, Who helped to clean it up. Last Christmas Eve, from off the spit I took the goose to table, Or should have done, but teasing love Did make me quite unable; And down slipt dish, and goose, and all, With din and clitter-clatter; All but the dog fell foul on me; He licked the broken platter. Although I'm ten years past a score, Too long to play the fool, My mistress says I must turn o'er My service for a school. Good feth! what must I do, and do, To keep my service still? I'll give the winds my thoughts to lose, Indeed and so I will. And if the wind my love should lose, Right foolish were the play, For I should mourn what I had lost, And love another day. With crosses and with losses Right double were the ill, So I'll e'en bear with love and all, Alack, and so I will. NOBODY COMETH TO WOO On Martinmas Eve the dogs did bark, And I opened the window to see, When every maiden went by with her spark, But ne'er a one came to me. And, oh dear, what will become of me? And, oh dear, what shall I do, When nobody whispers to marry meâ Nobody cometh to woo? None's born for such troubles as I be: If the sun wakens first in the morn âLazy hussyâ my parents both call me, And I must abide by their scorn, For nobody cometh to marry me, Nobody cometh to woo, So here in distress must I tarry meâ What can a poor maiden do? If I sigh through the window when Jerry The ploughman goes by, I grow bold; And if I'm disposed to be merry, My parents do nothing but scold; And Jerry the clown, and no other, E'er cometh to marry or woo; They think me the moral of mother, And judge me a terrible shrew. For mother she hateth all fellows, And spinning's my father's desire, While the old cat growls bass with the bellows If e'er I hitch up to the fire. I make the whole house out of humour, I wish nothing else but to please, Would fortune but bring a good comer To marry, and make me at ease! When I've nothing my leisure to hinder I scarce get as far as the eaves; Her head's instant out of the window, Calling out like a press after thieves. The young men all fall to remarking, And laugh till they're weary to see't, While the dogs at the noise begin barking, And I slink in with shame from the street. My mother's aye jealous of loving, My father's aye jealous of play, So what with them both there's no moving, I'm in durance for life and a day. Oh, who shall I get for to marry me? Who will have pity to woo? 'Tis death any longer to tarry me, And what shall a poor maiden do? FARE-THEE-WELL Here's a sad good-bye for thee, my love, To friends and foes a smile: I leave but one regret behind, That's left with thee the while, But hopes that fortune is our friend Already pays the toil. Force bids me go, your friends to please. Would they were not so high! But be my lot on land or seas, It matters not where by, For I shall keep a thought for thee, In my heart's core to lie. Winter shall lose its frost and snow, The spring its blossomed thorn, The summer all its bloom forgo, The autumn hound and horn Ere I will lose that thought of thee, Or ever prove forsworn. The dove shall change a hawk in kind, The cuckoo change its tune, The nightingale at Christmas sing, The fieldfare come in Juneâ Ere I do change my love for thee These things shall change as soon. So keep your heart at ease, my love, Nor waste a joy for me: I'll ne'er prove false to thee, my love, Till fish drown in the sea, And birds forget to fly, my love, And then I'll think of thee. The red-cock's wing may turn to grey, The crow's to silver white, The night itself may be for day, And sunshine wake at night: Till thenâand then I'll prove more true Than nature, life, and light. Though you may break your fondest vow, And take your heart from me, And though my heart should break to hear What I may never see, Yet never canst thou break the link That binds my love to thee. So fare-thee-well, my own true love; No vow from thee I crave, But thee I never will forgo, Till no spark of life I have, Nor will I ever thee forget Till we both lie in the grave. MARY NEELE My love is tall and handsome; All hearts she might command; She's matchless for her beauty, The queen of all the land. She has my heart in keeping, For which there's no repeal, For the fairest of all womankind Is my love, Mary Neele. I felt my soul enchanted To view this turtle-dove, That lately seems descended From heavenly bowers of love; And might I have the fortune My wishes could reveal, I'd turn my back on splendour And fly to Mary Neele. She is the flower of nations, The diamond of my eye; All others are but glow-worms That in her splendour die. As shining stars all vanish When suns their light reveal, So beauties shrink to shadows At the feet of Mary Neele. I ask no better fortune Than to embrace her charms; Like Plato I would laugh at wealth While she was in my arms; And if I cannot gain her From grief there's no appeal; My joy, my pain, my life, my all Are fixed with Mary Neele. The stone of vain philosophers, That wonder-working toy, The golden fleece of Jason, The Helen stole from Troy, The beauty and the riches That all these fames conceal, Are nothing all, and less than that, Compared to Mary Neele. Oh, if I cannot gain her Right wretched must I be, And caves and lonely mountains Must be the life for me, To pine in gloom and sorrow, And hide the deaths I feel, For light nor life I may not share When lost to Mary Neele. LOVE SCORNED BY PRIDE Oh, far is fled the winter wind, And far is fled the frost and snow, But the cold scorn on my love's brow Hath never yet prepared to go. More lasting than ten winters' wind, More cutting than ten weeks of frost, Is the chill frowning of thy mind, Where my poor heart was pledged and lost. I see thee taunting down the street, And by the frowning that I see I might have known it long ere now, Thy love was never meant for me. Oh, had I known ere I began That love had been so hard to win, I would have filled my heart with pride, Nor left one hope to let love in. I would have wrapped it in my breast, And pinned it with a silver pin, Safe as a bird within its nest, And 'scaped the trouble I am in. I wish I was a happy bird, And thou a true and timid dove: Oh, I would fly the land of grief, And rest me in the land of love. Oh, I would rest where I love best; Where I love best I may not be: A hawk doth on that rose-tree sit, And drives young love to fear and flee. Oh, would I were the goldfinch gay! My richer suit had tempted strong. Oh, would I were the nightingale! Thou then hadst listened to my song. Though deep thy scorn, I cannot hate; Thy beauty's sweet, though sour thy pride; To praise thee is to love thee still, And it doth cheer my heart beside. For I could swim the deepest lake, And I could climb the highest tree, The greatest danger face and brave, And all for one kind kiss of thee. Oh, love is here, and love is there: Oh, love is like no other thing: Its frowns can make a king a slave, Its smiles can make a slave a king. BETRAYED Dream not of love, to think it like What waking love may prove to be, For I dreamed so and broke my heart, When my false lover slighted me. Love, like to flowers, is sweet when green; The rose in bud aye best appears; And she that loves a handsome man Should have more wit than she has years. I set my back against an oak, Thinking it to be some lusty tree; But first it bowed and then it broke, And so did my false love with me. I put my finger in a bush, Thinking the sweetest rose to find; I pricked my finger to the bone, And left the sweetest rose behind. I threw a stone into the sea, And deep it sunk into the sand, And so did my poor heart in me When my false lover left the land. I watched the sun an hour too soon Set into clouds behind the town; So my false lover left, and said âGood nightâ before the day was down. I cropt a lily from the stalk, And in my hand it died away; So did my joy, so will my heart, In false love's cruel grasp decay. THE MAIDEN'S WELCOME Of all the swains that meet at eve Upon the green to play, The shepherd is the lad for me, And I'll ne'er say him nay. Though father glowers beneath his hat, And mother talks of bed, I'll take my cloak up, late or soon, To meet my shepherd lad. Aunt Kitty loved a soldier lad, Who left her love for war; A sailor loved my sister Sue, Whose jacket smelt of tar; But my love's sweet as land new ploughed, He is my heart's delight, And he ne'er leaves his love so far But he can come at night. So father he may glower and frown, And mother scold about it; The shepherd has my heart to keep, And can I live without it? I'm sure he will not part with it, In spite of what they say, And if he would, as sure I am It would not come away. So friends may frown, while I can smile To know I'm loved by one Who has my heart, and him to seek What better can be done? And be it spring or summer both, Or be it winter cold, If pots should freeze upon the fire I'd meet him at the fold. I'm fain to make my wedding-gown, Which he has bought for me, But it will wake my mother's thoughts, And evil they will be, Although he has but stole my heart, Which gives me naught of pain, For by and by he'll buy the ring, And bring my heart again. THE FALSE KNIGHT'S TRAGEDY A false knight wooed a maiden poor, And his high halls left he To stoop in at her cottage door, When night left none to see. And, well-a-day, it is a tale For pity too severeâ A tale would melt the sternest eye, And wake the deafest ear. He stole her heart, he stole her love, 'Twas all the wealth she had; Her truth and fame likewise stole he, And eke her maidenhead. And he gave gold, and promised moreâ That she his name should bear, That she should share his love for aye, And live his lady fair. But he ne'er meant a maid so low Should wear his haughty name, And much he feared his guilty love Would work him muckle shame. So underneath the mask of love He went to work her woe; And he did name the bridal day, And she prepared to go. He brought her silks, unseen, to wear, And a milk-white steed to ride, And not a word was to be known Till she was made a bride. He brought for her a milk-white steed, And for himself a grey, And they are off none knoweth where, Three hours before the day. And as they rode she wished him speak, And not a word spoke he. âYou were not wont, loved knight,â she said, âTo be thus cold to me.â And they rode on, and they rode on; Far on this pair did ride, Till the maiden's heart with fear and love Beat quick against her side. And on they rode till rocks grew high. âSir Knight, what have we here?â âUnsaddle, maid, for here we stopâ: And death's tongue smote her ear. Some ruffian rude she took him now, And wished she'd barred the door, Nor was it one that she could read Of having heard before. âThou art not my true love,â she said, âBut some rude robber loon; He'd take me from the saddle-bow, Nor leave me to get down.â âI ne'er was your true love,â said he, âFor I'm more bold than true; Though I'm the knight that came at dark To kiss and toy with you.â âI know ye're not my love,â said she, âThat came at night and wooed; Although ye try and mock his speech, His way was ne'er so rude. âHe ne'er said word but called me dear, And dear he is to me: Ye spake as ye ne'er knew the word, Rude ruffian as ye be. âYe never was my knight, I trow, Ye pay me no regard, But he would take my arm in his If we but went a yard.â âNo matter whose true love I am; I'm more than true to you, For I'll ne'er wed a shepherd wench, Although I came to woo.â And on to the rock's top they walked, Till they stood o'er the salt sea's brim. âAnd there,â said he, â's your bridal bed, Where you may sink or swim.â A moonbeam shone upon his face, The maid sunk at his feet, For 'twas her own false love she saw, That once so fond did greet. âAnd did ye promise love for this? Is the grave my priest to be? And did ye bring this silken dress To wed me with the sea.â âOh, never mind your dress,â quoth he, â'Tis well to dress for sea; Mermaids will love to see you fine; Your bridesmaids they will be.â âOh, let me cast this gown away, It's brought no good to me, And if my mother greets my clay Too wretched will she be. âFor she, for my sad sake, would keep This guilty bridal dress, To break and tell her bursting heart She had a daughter less.â So off she threw her bridal gown, Likewise her gold-clasped shoon: His looks frowned hard as any stone, Hers pale turned as the moon. âO false, false knight, you've wrapped me warm Ere I was cold before, And now you strip me unto death, Although I'm out of door. âOh, dash away those thistles rude, That crowd about the shore; They'll wound my tender feet, that ne'er Went barefoot thus before. âOh, dash those stinging-nettles down, And cut away the brier, For deep they wound those lily arms Which you did once admire.â And he nor briers nor thistles cut, Although she grieved full sore, And he nor shed one single tear, Nor kiss took evermore. She shriekedâand sank, and is at rest, All in the deep, deep sea; And home in base and scornful pride, With haunted heart, rode he. Now o'er that rock there hangs a tree, And chains do creak thereon; And in those chains his memory hangs, Though all beside is gone. LOVE'S RIDDLE âUnriddle this riddle, my own Jenny love, Unriddle this riddle for me, And if ye unriddle the riddle aright, A kiss your prize shall be, And if ye riddle the riddle all wrong, Ye'll treble the debt to me: âI'll give thee an apple without any core; I'll give thee a cherry where stones never be; I'll give thee a palace without any door, And thou shall unlock it without any key; I'll give thee a fortune that kings cannot give, Nor any one take from thee.â âHow can there be apples without any core? How can there be cherries where stone never be? How can there be houses without any door? Or doors I may open without any key? How canst thou give fortunes that kings cannot give, When thou art no richer than me?â âMy head is the apple without any core; In cherries in blossom no stones ever be; My mind is love's palace without any door, Which thou canst unlock, love, without any key. My heart is the wealth, love, that kings cannot give, Nor any one take it from thee. âSo there are love's riddles, my own Jenny love, Ye cannot unriddle to me, And for one kiss you've so easily lost I'll make ye give seven to me. To kiss thee is sweet, but 'tis sweeter by far To be kissed, my dear Jenny, by thee. âCome pay me the forfeit, my own Jenny love; Thy kisses and cheeks are akin, And for thy three sweet ones I'll give thee a score On thy cheeks, and thy lips, and thy chin.â She laughed while he gave them, as much as to say, â'Twere better to lose than to win.â THE BANKS OF IVORY 'Twas on the banks of Ivory, 'neath the hawthorn-scented shade, Early one summer's morning, I met a lovely maid; Her hair hung o'er her shoulders broad, her eyes like suns did shine, And on the banks of Ivory, oh, I wished the maid was mine. Her face it wore the beauty of heaven's own broken mould; The world's first charm seemed living still; her curls like hanks of gold Hung waving, and her eyes glittered timid as the dew, When by the banks of Ivory I swore I loved her true. âKind sir,â she said, âforsake me, while it is no pain to go, For often after kissing and such wooing there comes woe; And woman's heart is feeble; oh, I wish it were a stone; So by the banks of Ivory I'd rather walk alone. âFor learned seems your gallant speech, and noble is your trim, And thus to court an humble maid is just to please your whim; So go and seek some lady fair, as high in pedigree, Nor stoop so low by Ivory to flatter one like me.â âIn sooth, fair maid, you mock at me, for truth ne'er harboured ill; I will not wrong your purity; to love is all my will: My hall looks over yonder groves; its lady you shall be, For on the banks of Ivory I'm glad I met with thee.â He put his hands unto his lips, and whistled loud and shrill, And thirty-six well-armÃ¨d men came at their master's will. Said he, âI've flattered maids full long, but now the time is past, And the bonny halls of Ivory a lady own at last. âMy steed's back ne'er was gracÃ¨d for a lady's seat before; Fear not his speed; I'll guard thee, love, till we ride o'er the moor, To seek the priest, and wed, and love until the day we die.â So she that was but poor before is Lady Ivory. THE MAID OF OCRAM: or, LORD GREGORY Gay was the Maid of Ocram As lady e'er might be Ere she did venture past a maid To love Lord Gregory. Fair was the Maid of Ocram And shining like the sun Ere her bower key was turned on two Where bride-bed lay for none. And late at night she sought her loveâ The snow slept on her skinâ âGet up,â she cried, âthou false young man, And let thy true love in.â And fain would he have loosed the key All for his true love's sake, But Lord Gregory then was fast asleep, His mother wide awake. And up she threw the window sash, And out her head put she: âAnd who is that which knocks so late And taunts so loud to me?â âIt is the Maid of Ocram, Your own heart's next akin; For so you've sworn, Lord Gregory, To come and let me in. âOh, pause not thus, you know me well, Haste down my way to win. The wind disturbs my yellow locks, The snow sleeps on my skin.â âIf you be the Maid of Ocram, As much I doubt you be, Then tell me of three tokens That passed with you and me.â âOh, talk not now of tokens Which you do wish to break; Chilled are those lips you've kissed so warm, And all too numbed to speak. You know when in my father's bower You left your cloak for mine, Though yours was naught but silver twist And mine the golden twine.â âIf you're the lass of Ocram, As I take you not to be, The second token you must tell Which passed with you and me.â âOh, know you not, oh, know you not 'Twas in my father's park, You led me out a mile too far And courted in the dark? âWhen you did change your ring for mine My yielding heart to win, Though mine was of the beaten gold, Yours but of burnished tin, Though mine was all true love without, Yours but false love within? âOh, ask me no more tokens For fast the snow doth fall. 'Tis sad to strive and speak in vain, You mean to break them all.â âIf you are the Maid of Ocram, As I take you not to be, You must mention the third token That passed with you and me.â â'Twas when you stole my maidenhead; That grieves me worst of all.â âBegone, you lying creature, then This instant from my hall, Or you and your vile baby Shall in the deep sea fall; For I have none on earth as yet That may me father call.â âOh, must none close my dying feet, And must none close my hands, And may none bind my yellow locks As death for all demands? You need not use no force at all, Your hard heart breaks the vow; You've had your wish against my will And you shall have it now. âAnd must none close my dying feet, And must none close my hands, And will none do the last kind deeds That death for all demands?â âYour sister, she may close your feet, Your brother close your hands, Your mother, she may wrap your waist In death's fit wedding-bands; Your father, he may tie your locks And lay you in the sands.â âMy sister, she will weep in vain, My brother ride and run, My mother, she will break her heart; And ere the rising sun My father will be looking outâ But find me they will none. I go to lay my woes to rest, None shall know where I'm gone. God must be friend and father both, Lord Gregory will be none.â Lord Gregory started up from sleep And thought he heard a voice That screamed full dreadful in his ear, And once and twice and thrice. Lord Gregory to his mother called: âO mother dear,â said he, âI've dreamt the Maid of Ocram Was floating on the sea.â âLie still, my son,â the mother said, â'Tis but a little space, And half an hour has scarcely passed Since she did pass this place.â âO cruel, cruel mother, When she did pass so nigh How could you let me sleep so sound Or let her wander by? Now if she's lost my heart must breakâ I'll seek her till I die.â He sought her east, he sought her west, He sought through park and plain; He sought her where she might have been But found her not again. âI cannot curse thee, mother, Though thine's the blame,â said he, âI cannot curse thee, mother, Though thou'st done worse to me. Yet do I curse thy pride that aye So tauntingly aspires; For my love was a gay knight's heir, And my father wed a squire's. âAnd I will sell my park and hall; And if ye wed again Ye shall not wed for titles twice That made ye once so vain. So if ye will wed, wed for love, As I was fain to do; Ye've gi'n to me a broken heart, And I'll give naught to you. âYour pride has wronged your own heart's blood; For she was mine by grace, And now my lady-love is gone None else shall take her place. I'll sell my park and sell my hall And sink my titles too; Your pride's done wrong enough as now To leave it more to do. âShe owneth none that owned them all And would have graced them well; None else shall take the right she missed Nor in my bosom dwell.â And then he took and burnt his will Before his mother's face, And tore his patents all in two, While tears fell down apaceâ But in his mother's haughty look Ye naught but frowns might trace. And then he sat him down to grieve, But could not sit for pain; And then he laid him on the bed And ne'er got up again. THE LOST MAID âSay, stranger, did you see my love? I prithee tell to me; I left her down in the beechen grove While I sought the strawberry; And when wild strawberries I did gain The woody hills upon, I sought her in the grove in vain, For the gentle maid was gone. âThen prithee, stranger, kindly say, Did ye see the maid I seek?â âAnd tell me what she wore, I pray, Before that I can speak.â âOh, what she's like were hard to say, Kind stranger, well I wot; Like the sun, when she exists is day And night where she is not.â âWhat clothes then did this maiden wear? I prithee tell to me.â âOh, for her dress I do not care, For naught like her it be; Her gown it was as white as snow, And her kerchief it was green, Oh, stranger, tell me if you know Where my true love was seen.â âWhat were her looks, that I may know If I saw the maid ye seek?â âOh, her eyes they were as like the sloe, And rosy was her cheek, And auburn were her curls that fell O'er a forehead white and high; If I lose the maid I love so well, Kind stranger, I mun die.â âHow did she speak, that I may tell If such one spoke to me?â âOh, on the softest music dwell Of olden minstrelsy, The wild harp's softer ditty play, And the lute's soft trill, And if you heard her voice ye'll say That it was sweeter still.â THE MOTHER'S LULLABY Hush! lullaby, my baby, nor mix thy tears with mine; I grieve to think my parents would be no friends of thine; I grieve to think thy fatherâoh, grief doth words oppose, To think thy helpless innocence should find so many foes. Hush! lullaby, my baby, upon thy mother's arm; My prayers shall still the storm to rest to leave my baby warm, While to thy father's hall we go, who fast asleep doth lie: Did he know his door was locked on thee, it might unclose his eye. Hush! lullaby, my baby; he yet thy friend may be, And by and by I hope to find a friend again in thee; So hush, my little baby, the day comes by and by, The storm is gone, the moon is up, so hush and lullaby! Hush! lullaby, my baby; I wake thee when I sigh, To think my parents turned their back, nor bade thee one âgoodbyeâ; Nor sighed to see thy breath nigh gone, to meet the storm so high, But God has heard, and the storm is gone, so hush and lullaby! A MAID'S TRAGEDY âOh, ope thy doorâloud howls the wind On my naked misery; Though thou to me hast proved unkind, I meant no harm to thee. I'm loath to break thy peaceful rest, But chilly falls the rain; The storm cuts deep my barÃ¨d breast But not like thy disdain. âLove's tender pledge within my arms Is numbed and breathes no more; Oh, if thy heart with pity warms Awake and ope thy door. I have no clothes to shelter me; A father's scorn I fly; Worse pelts the storm; love, pity me, Or at thy door I die.â Thus wailing o'er her woes, a maid To her [false lover] came, Who won her heart, her love betrayed, And left her to her shame. The shelter of her house denied, Her father's scorn she bore; Here to her false love's house she hied, âOh, William, ope thy door! âThe storm I longer cannot stand; My covering is but thin; My babe falls from my numbing hand, Oh, wake and let me in. That once red cheek is cold to touch That warmed with thy embrace When kissed and praised by thee so much And owned a lovely face. âBut cropt by thee, the bloom is gone; Love's pledge in death doth sleep; Oh, bitter cold the storm keeps on; I wouldâbut cannotâweep. Ah, wilt thou not, my false love, wake?â In vain the maiden cried: Benumbed with cold, her heart did break; She sat her down, and died. THE TRIUMPHS OF TIME. Emblazoned vapour! half-eternal shade! That gathers strength from ruin and decay; Emperor of empires! for the world hath made No substance that dare take thy shade away; Thy banners naught but victories display; In undisturbed success thou'rt grown sublime; Kings are thy subjects, and their sceptres lay Round thy proud footstool; tyranny and crime Thy serving vassals are. Then hail, victorious Time! The elements that wreck the marble dome, Proud with the polish of the artisanâ Bolts that crash shivering through the humble home, Traced with the insignificance of manâ Are architects of thine, and proudly plan Rich monuments to show thy growing prime: Earthquakes that rend the rocks with dreadful span, Lightnings that write in characters sublime, Inscribe their labours all unto the praise of Time. Thy palaces are kingdoms lost to power; The ruins of ten thousand thrones thy throne; Thy crown and sceptre the dismantled tower, A place of kings, yet left to be unknown, Now with triumphing ivy overgrownâ Ivy oft plucked on victory's brow to shineâ That fades in crowns of kings, preferring stone; It only prospers where they most decline, To flourish o'er their fate, and live alone in thine. Thy dwellings are in ruins made sublime. Impartial monitor, no dream of fear, No dread of treason for a royal crime, Deters thee from thy purpose; everywhere Thy power is shown; thou art arch-emperor here; Thou soil'st the very crowns with stains and rust; On royal robes thy havoc doth appear; The little moth, to thy proud summons just, Dares scarlet pomp to scorn, and eats it into dust. Old shadows of magnificence, where nowâ Where now and what your grandeur? Come and see Busts broken and thrown down, with wreathless brow, Walls stained with colours, not of paint, but thee, Moss, lichens, ferns, and lonely elder tree, That upon ruins gladly climb to bloom, And add a beauty where 'tis vain to be, Like to soft moonlight in a prison's gloom, Or lovely maid in youth death-smitten for the tomb. What now are grandeur's heirs? Things dull and drear, The vassals of thy mockery and will; Like Banquo's ghosts to pride their forms appear And turn ambition's memory winter-chill. Where kings once ruled, now spiders work their skill In cobwebs, nor yet feel their royal fate; There mopes the bat with triumph small and shrill, And wise satiric owl pops out elate From trellised architrave to show who slept in state. Pride may build palaces and splendid halls; Power may display its victories and be brave; The eye finds weakest spots in strongest walls, And meets no strength that can outwear the grave. Nature, thy handmaid and imperial slave, The pomp of splendour's finery never heeds: Kings reign and die: pride may no respite crave; Nature in barrenness ne'er mourns thy deeds: Graves, poor and rich alike, she overruns with weeds. In thy proud eye, imperial arbiter, An insect small to prize appeareth man; His pomp and honours have o'er thee no spell, To win thy purpose from the little span Allotted unto life in nature's plan; Trifles to him thy favour can engage; High he looks up, and soon his race is run, While the small daisy upon nature's page, On which he sets his foot, gains endless heritage. Look at the farces played in every age By puny empires, vaunting vain display, And blush to read the historian's fulsome page, Where kings are worshipped like to gods in clay. Their pride the earth disdained and swept away, By thee, a shadow, worsted of their allâ Legions of soldiers, battle's dread array, Kings' speeches, golden bribes, naught saved their fall; All 'neath thy feet are laid, thy robe their funeral pall. How feeble and how vain, compared to thine, The glittering pageantry of earthly kings, Though in their little light they would outshine Thy splendid sun: yet soon thy vengeance flings Its gloom around their crowns, poor puny things, What then remains of all that great hath been? A tattered state, that as a mockery clings To greatness, and concludes the idle sceneâ In life how mighty thought, and found in death how mean. Thus Athens lingers on, a nest of slaves, And Babylon's an almost doubted name: Thou with thy finger writ'st upon their graves, On one obscurity, the other shame. The richest greatness or the proudest fame Thy sport concludeth as a farce at last: They were and would be, but are not the same: Tyrants, that made all subject where they passed, Become a common jest for laughter at the last. Here where I stand thy voice breathes from the ground A buried tale of sixteen hundred years, And many a Roman fragment, littered round, In each new-rooted mole-hill reappears. Ah! what is fame, that honour so reveres? And what is Victory's laurel-crowned event When thy unmasked intolerance interferes? A Caesar's deeds are left to banishment, Indebted e'en to moles to show us where he went. A mighty poet thou, and every line Thy grand conception traces is sublime: No language doth thy godlike works confine; Thy voice is earth's grand polygot, O Time! Known of all tongues, and read in every clime, Changes of languages make no change in thee: Thy works have worsted centuries of their prime, Yet new editions every day we seeâ Ruin thy moral theme, its end eternity. A satirist, too, thy pen is deadly keen; Thou turnest things that once did wonder claim To jests ridiculous and memories mean; The Egyptian pyramids, without a name, Stand monuments to chaos, not to fame, Stone jests of kings which thou in sport didst save As towering satires of pride's living shame, Beacons to prove thy overbearing wave Will make all fame at last become its owner's grave. Mighty survivors! Thou shalt see the hour When all the grandeur that the earth contains, Its pomp, its splendour, and its hollow power, Shall waste like water from its weakened veins, And not a shadow or a myth remainâ When names and fames of which the earth is full, And books, with all their knowledge urged in vainâ When dead and living shall be void and null, And nature's pillow be at last a human skull. E'en temples raised to worship and to prayer, Sacred from ruin in all eyes but thine, Are laid as level, and are left as bare, As spots with no pretensions to resign; Nor lives one relic that was deemed divine By thee, great sacrilegious shade; all, all Are swept away, and common weeds enshrine That place of tombs and memories prodigalâ Itself a tomb at last, the record of its fall. All then shall mingle fellowship with one, And earth be strewn with wrecks of human things, When tombs are broken up and memory's gone Of proud aspiring mortals, crowned as kings, Mere insects, sporting upon waxen wings That melt at thy all-mastering energy; And, when there's naught to govern, thy fame springs To new existence, conquered, yet to be An uncrowned partner still of dread eternity. 'Tis done, o'erpowering vision! And no more My simple numbers chronicle thy fame; 'Tis gone: the spirit of my voice is o'er, Adventuring praises to thy mighty name. To thee an atom am I, and in shame I shrink from these aspirings to my doom; For all the world contains to praise or blame Is but a garden hastening out of bloom To fill up nature's wreckâmere rubbish for the tomb. Imperial moralist! Thy every page, Like grand prophetic visions, doth install Truth for all creeds. The savage, saint, and sage In unison may answer to thy call. Thy voice, as universal, speaks to all; It tells us what all were and are to be; That evil deeds will evil hearts enthral, And virtue only change the dread decree, That whoso righteous lives shall win eternity. THE HEART THAT'S SMIT The heart that's smit with the white and red That rosy cheeks do entertain, And on a bosom's lily bed Longs for to lie and be well again, The wounded that doth pains endure From star-like eyes and snowy skin Is stung by toys that admit no cure If there's no heart within. In vain they love, in vain may glow At beauty that is all display, Love without roots can never grow But like cropt flowers decay. The scentless flower that in show exceeds But pleases for an hour, Then's tost aside like children's weedsâ And such is beauty's power. The heart's the soil where love doth grow, Its virtue doth all charms excel, Their union is true bliss below, Love must be where they dwell. The finest jewels so rich and rare Are always cased in a meaner skin, Nor would the casket be locked with care But for the gem within. MAN'S VANITY AND LIFE Man is an insect, life his cell, Nor lives he till death breaks the shell; He dreameth here, and waketh there, So what, forsooth, hath life to heir? A painted nothing of the mind, Whose peace we hunt, and never find; A fairy-tale of what hath been, Where all is heard and nothing seen; A mystic show which thoughts devise, A rumour clothed in prophecies; A dream unmarred, a hope deferred, Here all is fancy, nothing heard. Anon, man peeps behind the screen; The spell is out, the show is seen, The rumour proved, and so belied, The prophecy nigh thrown aside, The dream half faded, woke too soon, The hope torn up, and wellnigh done. Anon, he lets the curtain fall; The past's forgot, the present all, The dream renews, the scene beguiles, And hope's torn blossom lives and smiles. The clouds seem gone, the skies are blue, The sun is outâit must be true; The dread of former storms and rain Are naught, as they'd be ne'er again; The flower is open, leaves are green, The summer reigns, the air serene; The bird hath sung and built its nest, Love's bowers too made, and they at rest, All nature seems in pleasure's span, Insects seem blest, and so does man, In spirits high, in joyance loud, In fancy great, in nature proud, And all but wanting wings to fly To mingle with eternity. Anon he feasts: life's viands shine, Mirth flutters, and prepares to dine: The hall's decked out, the guests are come, Eyes serve for suns and roses bloom; The dance is off, the music sweet, And loud the prate of merry feet. Aye doth my ear deceive my willâ I turn to join, and all is still: That moment revel's sons were gay, And this is silentâwhere are they? 'Twas then their morn, but now 'tis noon, So guests are fed and dinner done, The wine drank up and bottle drained, The riddle told though unexplained, The songs all sung, the jests all said, The dance is done and all is sped. The insect fares as summer faresâ Its joys are short, and so were theirs. Sleep came ere mirth did well begin, Death, where they feasted, owns the inn; So in he went to claim his pay And clear the wasted scraps awayâ When eyes grew dim, the roses wan, The rooms all still: and where is man? Gone like a star from heaven's face, Nor e'en his shadow heirs his place. VERSES ON LIFE Life was and is and still will be Of cares the endless history, By hopes conceived, by trouble penned, Which joys began and sorrows end. If at the first a smile appears 'Tis but the prologue unto tears, Where each leaf is, when turnÃ¨d o'er, The echo of those turned before. Life was and is and will be on A ruin with its glory gone, A wreck that braves the storms in vain, For calms it ne'er shall know again, A dream enjoyed with fancy's eyes, Where hope awakes without a prize, A path whose starting all admire, That leads to naught but thorn and brier. Life is a game where thousands choose To hazard even all, and lose; A lottery, where millions pawn Their chance, though blanks are death when drawn, One prize is all, and they are wise Who let their reason choose that prize; The gem of life it proves when got, And poor are they who have it not; Its value at the last shall be A passport for eternity. SONG [I dreamed of love and thought it sweet] I dreamed of love and thought it sweet And took the winter for the spring; A maiden's charms won me to woo Where beauty's blooms so thick did hing That I from thence did fear no blast To bid young hope's frail bud decay, Till tenderest words met bitter scorn And then I wished myself awayâ But all too late; and such as she Might well deceive the wisest mind, For love sure ne'er met one before So scornful bent, so seeming kind; For fair as spring, as summer warm, Her young blood it did seem to flow; And yet her heart did prove so cold Love's bud died there and could not blow. Her face looks open as the day, And in her lips and in her eyes Smiles and goodwill do seem to play, That are love's deaths in green disguise; Her breasts peep from her kerchief folds Like sunshine thro' a parting cloud, And yet love finds within that bed Naught but a dead and wintry shroud. All hopes are gone that wished her mine; And now her mind I prove and know I'm gladâand yet methinks those hopes That then did cheat did cheer me so I almost wish I ne'er had sued, But still hoped on and still believed; For it were best to dream of joy Than thus to wake and be deceived. SONG [Whence comes this coldness, prithee say!] Whence comes this coldness, prithee say! If woman's love be this, Ah, woe is me and welladay! A changing thing it is: To love at morn, and doubt at noon, And at a little shower Shut up their smiles, and so be done, Like any other flower. Alack! the smile did me betray The hour we ever met; For, woe is me and welladay! Thee I may ne'er forget. Upbraiding I can offer none, Nor scorn for scorn allow; I had not loved as I have done If I could hate thee now. THE LOVER'S SONG I've heard thee sing of plaintive things, And as thy fingers swept the strings, Thy eyes have wept most tenderly; Then list awhile till I beguile Thy heart with sorrow's melody. A young heart tried a maid to move And pined to death for very love; The maiden naught but scorn returned Nor dropt one tear upon his bier; He died unhonoured and unmourned. I knew thou'dst mourn so sad a thing; Oh, touch, my Anna, touch the string With sprightlier airs, nor grief endure; That heart you weep, though wounded deep, Is yet not past your cure. THE WORLD'S END To hunt birds' nests on summer morns, So far my leisure seemed to run, I've paused to wonder where I'd got And thought I'd got beyond the sun; It seemed to rise another way, The very world's end seemed as near; Some strange bush pointed where it lay, So back I turned for very fear With eager haste and wonder-struck, Pursued as by a dreaded spell, Till homeâOh, could I write a book, I thought, what wonders I could tell! And when again I left the town To the world's end I thought I'd go And o'er the brink just peep adown To see the mighty depths below. THE BLACKCAP The blackcap is a singing bird, A nightingale in melody; Last March in Open Wood I heard One sing that quite astonished me; I took it for the nightingaleâ It jug-jugged just the same as heâ So creeping through the mossy rail I in the thicket got to see: When one small bird of saddened green, Black head, and breast of ashy grey, In ivied oak tree scarcely seen, Stopt all at once and flew away; And since, in hedgerow's dotterel trees, I've oft this tiny minstrel met, Where ivy flapping to the breeze Bear ring-marked berries black as jet; But whether they find food in these I've never seen or known as yet. THE MISSEL-THRUSH'S NEST In early March, before the lark Dare start, beside the huge oak tree, Close fixed agen the powdered bark, The mavis' nest I often see; And mark, as wont, the bits of wool Hang round about its early bed; She lays six eggs in colours dull, Blotched thick with spots of burning red. KINGFISHERS Look where two splendid feathered things Sit on that grey and stretching bough, That from the leaning willow hings Half o'er the gulling flood below. Like foreign birds' their plumage shines In splendour's rich and varied hue; The peacock's tail is scarce as fineâ Rich-shaded, orange, green, and blue. No finer birds are known to fly Than these gay-dressed kingfishers are, Who live on fish and watch the fry Of minnows nimbly passing there; And there they'll sit whole hours away In that same lone and watching spot, And when they dart to seize their prey Drop down as sudden as a shot. Sandmartin-like, they make a hole A steepy headlong bank beside, As well as ever did the mole, And there their many eggs they hide. And as is natural to their kind, Where mill-dam waters wildly foam, Places more hard to reach than find They choose, a safe and quiet home. Their hole a full arm's length is made, Turned at the last with sudden bend, Where lots of fishes' bones are laid Close to the large and furthest end; Their eggs are white as wrynecks' be And much about that middle size, And boys oft skulk behind a tree To watch the old one where she flies, And then pull out their knives in glee And delve in vain to reach the prize. THE SPIDER-CATCHER There is a stranger comes with May To haunt the homestead's orchard tree, Sings âeejip, eejipâ all the day, And many cheated folks there be, Whose fancies lead their ears astray, Think Bible Egypt is its home, A marvel of the mighty way That birds without a guide will come. It sings its strange and foreign call All day in motion and at rest, And in the orchard's hollow wall It makes a large and curious nest Of straws that from the yard it gains, Of cobwebs fine as very down, And lays six eggs of tawny stains, Besprent with dots of darker brown. Its back is of a slaty blue, Its paler bosom ashen grey, Its wings are of a darker hue, And now and ever all the day The orchard trees are its retreats; And there this ever busy guest A something every moment meets To catch and carry to its nest. 'Neath cot and hovel eaves it drops, And flies and insects often gets, And round the barn-hole fluttering stops Where spiders spread their flimsy nets; And boys from what they've seen and heard Them oft as spider-catchers call; But yet the busy âeejip birdâ Remains a guess and doubt with all. THE LANDRAIL (II) I've listened, when to school I've gone, That craking noise to hear, And crept and listened on and on But ne'er once gotten near; I've trampled through the meadow grass And dreaded to be caught, And stood and wondered what it was, And very often thought Some fairy thing had lost its way, Night's other worlds to find, And hiding in the grass all day Mourned to be left behind; But I've since found their eggs, forsooth, And so we may agen, But great the joy I missed in youth As not to find them then; For when a boy a new nest meets Joy gushes to his breast, Nor would his heart so quickly beat Were guineas in the nest. I've hunted till the day has been So vanished that I dare Not go to school nor yet be seen That I was playing there; So mid the wheat I've made a seat Upon an old meer-stone, And hid, and all my dinner eat, Till four o'clock was gone. THE REDCAP The redcap is a painted bird And beautiful its feathers are; In early spring its voice is heard While searching thistles brown and bare; It makes a nest of mosses grey And lines it round with thistle-down; Five small pale spotted eggs they lay In places never far from town. I've seen them build on eldern bough And tip-top of our russeting, But never did I see till now A bird's nest in a garland hing; In this old princifeather tree, As hiding from the sudden showers, The redcap's nest delighteth me, Hid in a bunch of lilac flowers. THE WILLOW-BITER Beside a mole-hill, thickly topt With wild rock-roses' lemon blooms, I stooped, and out a something popt, A very mouse in russet plumes; So low and nimble was its flight It rather seemed to run than fly, And in a furze bush out of sight It in a moment left my eye. A lapt-up ball of withered grass Appeared its little tiny house; And sure enough my early guess Thought it the dwelling of a mouse; At length I found a little hole I scarce could get a finger through, And eggs, a dozen on the wholeâ I wanted them to tell it trueâ As large as is a large white pea, And less than wrens' in hovels are, With spots scarce big enough to see Most finely freckled here and there. The woodmen call them, in their way, The willow-biters, 'cause they see Them biting in the month of May The young shoots of the willow tree; But what they are in learning's way Is all unknown to them or me. THE LARK'S NEST From yon black clump of wheat that grows More rank and higher than the rest, A larkâI marked her as she roseâ At early morning left her nest. Her eggs were four of dusky hue, Blotched brown as is the very ground, With tinges of a purply hue The larger ends encircling round. Behind a clod how snug the nest Is in a horse's footing fixed! Of twitch and stubbles roughly dressed, With roots and horsehair intermixed. The wheat surrounds it like a bower, And like to thatch each bowing blade Throws off the frequent falling shower âAnd here's an egg this morning laid! THE SWALLOW'S NEST Here down the meadow runs a path Snake-winding through the pleasant hay, That leadeth over many a swath Which shed their fragrance all the way. At last the eye beholds the view Of many arches all a-row, That leads the traveller safely through When floods are roaring loud below. There 'neath an arch, as like to drop, Two hermit swallows yearly fix Their nest beneath the freestone topâ You'd almost wonder how it sticks. And through and through the brig they whipâ Thoughts hardly can the pace maintainâ Then âtwitâ and in the water dip, And âtwitâ and hurry back again. THE MOOR-HEN'S NEST I in my summer rambles love to see A flood-washed bank support an aged tree, Whose roots are bare; yet some with foothold good Crankle and spread and strike beneath the flood; Yet still it leans as safer hold to win On t'other side, and seems as tumbling in. Yet every summer finds it green and gay And winter leaves it safe as did the May; Nor does the moor-hen find its safety vain, For on its roots their last year's homes remain; And once again a couple from the brood Seek their old birthplace, and in safety's mood Build up their flags and lay; though danger comes, It dares and tries and cannot reach their homes; And still they hatch their eggs and sweetly dream On their shelfed nest hung just to touch the stream; And soon their sooty brood from fear elope Where bulrush forests give them sweeter hope; Their hanging nest that aids their wishes well Each leaves for water as it leaves the shell; They dive and dare and every gambol try Till they themselves to other scenes can fly. THE FIRETAIL Around the old and ruined wall, About the dead and hollow tree, The firetail's âtweet-tutâ fretting call Keeps up a teasing melody. It starts at every passer-by, And boys that by its dwelling roam Well know its danger-daunting cry And watch it till its ventures home. Its nest is made of hair and moss And down and cobwebs very fine; Its eggs are blue withouten gloss, I've found as many oft as nine. The female has a fiery tail, And is a dull and sandy brown, But beautiful appears the male With crimson breast and jetty crown. THE GREEN WOODPECKER AND THE WRYNECK Hark! heard ye not the gentle rap Like one tip-tapping at a door? Then look above that woodland gap The old oak dotterel leaneth o'er, Upon whose rough and powdered rind The green woodpecker eager clings; And now it screams aloud to find Us near, and round the tree it springs. In touchwood trees it taps for food, And in those holes of tiny size Which insects make in rotten wood It thrusts its slender tongue and cries; Its tongue, a finger's length or more, Fast glues them if they do but move; But hardest oaks its bill can boreâ E'en birds will labour hard for love. It knocks and craunches in the wood For half the April, soon and late, And though as sounds were understood It screams and cackles to its mate, Who quickly mocks the tuneless noise; And then, as cheered, it bores in glee, Snug-hid from mischief-wandering boys, Who wonder what the sound may be. And when the hole is deep enough, It seeks its moss and wool and hair And all the scraps of downy stuff That field and forest have to spare; And here the wryneck often comes And finds a snug nest ready made And layeth siegeâwhose hissing hums May make the larger birds afraid. The green woodpecker's eggs are grey, Scarce larger than a sparrow's are, And spotted in the self-same way, Save that the spots are rather spare. The wryneck's are a snowy white, At whose large ends a simple ring Still whiter shines when in the light; I've often found them in the spring. And one nest in an apple tree That o'er an orchard path did lean, Where I went every morn to see, Had eggs as many as sixteen. She'd raise her feathers on her crown And hiss as if to frighten boys; E'en crouching cats would jump adown Nor dared to meet the dreaded noise. I've seen it raise its copple crest, For I have watched it day by day, And though I've found it on its nest It never tried to get away, But waved its speckled head awry And hissed as if a snake to feign, And waited till its brood could fly Yet never sought the tree again. THE FERN-OWL Hark! there's that churring noise we heard And thought it some wild frolic boy; 'Tis sure enough an unknown bird, I've seldom heard so strange a cry. 'Tis like a âskreekerâ quickly turned, Which nurses twine the child to please, A cricket's note more loudly churned, And yet but little like to these. I've heard it at the fall of eve, Just after gentle showers of rain, At early morn it would deceive My ear, and here it calls again. 'Tis always hidden in the woods, I never heard it on the plain, And seldom in its singing moods, So all inquiry ends in vain. I've heard it in the April showers What time the sun was going bed, And in May's early morning hours, When dews have bent the blossom's head. But whether it the fern-owl be, Or, as may hap, a stranger bird, Is still a hidden mystery Whose truth as fact I've never heard. I've read in books but found it not, I've talked with men of mickle skill, To hunt it I've in thickets got, But all remains a mystery still. THE CHIFF-CHAFF See at yon flitting bird that flies Above the oak tree tops at play, Uttering its restless melodies Of âchipichapâ throughout the day. Its nest is built in little bush Scarcely a foot above the ground, Or hid in clumps of sedge or rush In woods where they are rarely found. Its nest is like an oven made With moss and leaves and bits of grass, And all so nice and snugly laid That hands may spoil but not replace. It enters by a little hole, Its inside is a feather bed From yards and poultry hovels stole; Its eggs are small and spotted red. And all the spring and all the May, If I forbore the gate to clap, Down that wood-riding day by day We heard it singing âchipichap,â And o'er the tree-tops saw it fly, Dancing about, a fairy thing, But never yet could come so nigh To tell the colour of its wing. The bushes they are dripping wet, Or we would seek its curious nest, There oft in bushy places met, Where sedges mingle with the rest. LONE HAPPINESS âThese birds, how happy must they be!â I muttered, as I reached to pull The woodbine twisting round the tree In spots so wild and beautiful; The furze flowers, spread on either hand, Shine one broad shower of gleaming gold, And on this mole-hill where I stand To look, 'tis luscious to behold. I've oft been glad at heart to see A footpath winding through the grass O'er narrow stiles 'neath spreading tree, Not wide enough for two to pass; But now no ownership I fear, Nor path to keep nor stile to climb, I feel myself a monarch here, My very fancies grow sublime. Yon bird that winnows in the sky On narrow, pointed, quivering wings, These sheep that in the mole-hills lie, Are all the hermit living things I seeâand from the world away I feel what she can never give, So happy at my heart to-day That from the world I wish to live. THE FLIGHT OF BIRDS The crow goes flopping on from wood to wood, The wild duck wherries to the distant flood, The starnels hurry o'er in merry crowds, And overhead whew by like hasty clouds; The wild duck from the meadow-water plies And dashes up the water as he flies; The pigeon suthers by on rapid wing, The lark mounts upward at the call of spring. In easy flights above the hurricane With doubled neck high sails the noisy crane. Whizz goes the pewit o'er the ploughman's team, With many a whew and whirl and sudden scream; And lightly fluttering to the tree just by, In chattering journeys whirls the noisy pie; From bush to bush slow swees the screaming jay, With one harsh note of pleasure all the day. THE WOODLARK (II) Yet chance will sometimes prove a faithless guest, Leading some wanderer by her haunts to roam; And startled by the rustle, from her nest She flutters out and so betrays her home; Yet it is seldom accident can meet With her weed-hidden and surrounded nest; I've often wondered, when agen my feet She fluttered up and fanned the anemone That blossomed round in crowds, how birds could be So wise to find such hidden homes again; And this in sooth oft puzzled meâthey go Far off and then return; but nature's plainâ She giveth what sufficeth them to know That they of comfort can their share retain. ON SEEING TWO SWALLOWS LATE IN OCTOBER (II) But, little lingerers, old esteem detains Ye haply thus to brave the chilly air When skies grow dull with winter's heavy rains And all the orchard trees are nearly bare; Yet the old chimneys still are peeping there Above the russet thatch where summer's tide Of sunny joys gave you such social fare As makes you haply wishing to abide In your old dwelling through the changing year. I wish ye well to find a dwelling here, For in the unsocial weather ye would fling Gleanings of comfort through the winter wide, Twittering as wont above the old fireside, And cheat the surly winter into spring. THE BUMBARREL'S NEST The oddling bush, close sheltered hedge new plashed, Of which spring's early liking makes a guest First with a shade of green though winter-dashedâ There, full as soon, bumbarrels make a nest Of mosses grey with cobwebs closely tied, And warm and rich as feather-bed within, With little hole on its contrary side That pathway peepers may no knowledge win Of what her little oval nest containsâ Ten eggs and often twelve, with dusts of red Soft frittered; and full soon the little lanes Screen the young crowd and hear the twitting song Of the old birds who call them to be fed, While down the hedge they hang and hide along. THE FLITTING I've left my own old home of homes, Green fields and every pleasant place; The summer like a stranger comes, I pause and hardly know her face. I miss the hazel's happy green, The bluebell's quiet hanging blooms, Where envy's sneer was never seen, Where staring malice never comes. I miss the heath, its yellow furze, Mole-hills and rabbit tracks that lead Through besom-ling, and teazle burrs That spread a wilderness indeed; The woodland oaks and all below That their white-powdered branches shield, The mossy paths: the very crow Croaks music in my native field. I sit me in my corner chair That seems to feel itself from home, And hear bird music here and there From hawthorn hedge and orchard come; I hear, but all is strange and new: I sat on my old bench in June, The sailing puddock's shrill âpeelewâ On Royce Wood seemed a sweeter tune. I walk adown the narrow lane, The nightingale is singing now, But like to me she seems at loss For Royce Wood and its shielding bough. I lean upon the window-sill, The trees and summer happy seem; Green, sunny green they shine, but still My heart goes far away to dream Of happiness, and thoughts arise With home-bred pictures many a one, Green lanes that shut out burning skies And old crook'd stiles to rest upon; Above them hangs the maple tree, Below grass swells a velvet hill, And little footpaths sweet to see Go seeking sweeter places still, With by and by a brook to cross O'er which a little arch is thrown: No brook is here, I feel the loss From home and friends and all alone. The stone pit with its shelvy sides Seemed hanging rocks in my esteem; I miss the prospect far and wide From Langley Bush, and so I seem Alone and in a stranger scene, Far, far from spots my heart esteems, The closen with their ancient green, Heaths, woods, and pastures' sunny streams. The hawthorns here were hung with may, But still they seem in deader green, The sun e'en seems to lose its way Nor knows the quarter it is in. I dwell on trifles like a child, I feel as ill becomes a man, And still my thoughts like weedlings wild Grow up to blossom where they can. They turn to places known so long I feel that joy was dwelling there, So home-fed pleasures fill the song That has no present joys to heir. I read in books for happiness, But books are like the sea to joy; They changeâas well give age the glass To hunt its visage when a boy. For books they follow fashions new And throw all old esteems away, In crowded streets flowers never grew, But many there hath died away. Some sing the pomps of chivalry As legends of the ancient time, Where gold and pearls and mystery Are shadows painted for sublime; But passions of sublimity Belong to plain and simpler things, And David underneath a tree Sought when a shepherd Salem's springs, Where moss did into cushions spring, Forming a seat of velvet hue, A small unnoticed trifling thing To all but heaven's hailing dew. And David's crown hath passed away, Yet poesy breathes his shepherd-skill, His palace lostâand to this day The little moss is blooming still. Strange scenes mere shadows are to me, Vague impersonifying things; I love with my old haunts to be By quiet woods and gravel springs, Where little pebbles wear as smooth As hermits' beads by gentle floods, Whose noises do my spirits soothe And warm them into singing moods. Here every tree is strange to me, All foreign things where'er I go, There's none where boyhood made a swee Or clambered up to rob a crow. No hollow tree or woodland bower Well known when joy was beating high, Where beauty ran to shun a shower And love took pains to keep her dry, And laid the sheaf upon the ground To keep her from the dripping grass, And ran for stooks and set them round Till scarce a drop of rain could pass Through; where the maidens they reclined And sung sweet ballads now forgot, Which brought sweet memories to the mind, But here no memory knows them not. There have I sat by many a tree And leaned o'er many a rural stile, And conned my thoughts as joys to me, Naught heeding who might frown or smile. 'Twas nature's beauty that inspired My heart with raptures not its own, And she's a fame that never tires; How could I feel myself alone? No, pasture mole-hills used to lie And talk to me of sunny days, And then the glad sheep resting by All still in ruminating praise Of summer and the pleasant place; And every weed and blossom too Was looking upward in my face With friendship's welcome âHow do ye do?â All tenants of an ancient place And heirs of noble heritage, Coeval they with Adam's race And blest with more substantial age. For when the world first saw the sun These little flowers beheld him too, And when his love for earth begun They were the first his smiles to woo. There little lambtoe bunches springs In red-tinged and begolden dye For ever, and like China kings They come but never seem to die. There may-bloom with its little threads Still comes upon the thorny bowers And ne'er forgets those pinky heads Like fairy pins amid the flowers. And still they bloom as on the day They first crowned wilderness and rock, When Abel haply wreathed with may The firstlings of his little flock, And Eve might from the matted thorn To deck her lone and lovely brow Reach that same rose that heedless scorn Misnames as the dog rosey now. Give me no high-flown fangled things, No haughty pomp in marching chime, Where muses play on golden strings And splendour passes for sublime, Where cities stretch as far as fame And fancy's straining eye can go, And piled until the sky for shame Is stooping far away below. I love the verse that, mild and bland, Breathes of green fields and open sky, I love the muse that in her hand Bears flowers of native poesy; Who walks nor skips the pasture brook In scorn, but by the drinking horse Leans o'er its little brig to look How far the sallows lean across, And feels a rapture in her breast Upon their root-fringed grains to mark A hermit moor-hen's sedgy nest Just like a naiad's summer bark. She counts the eggs she cannot reach, Admires the spot and loves it well, And yearns, so nature's lessons teach, Amid such neighbourhoods to dwell. I love the muse who sits her down Upon the mole-hill's little lap, Who feels no fear to stain her gown And pauses by the hedgerow gap; Not with that affectation, praise Of song, to sing and never see A field flower grow in all her days Or e'en a forest's aged tree. E'en here my simple feelings nurse A love for every simple weed, And e'en this little shepherd's purse Grieves me to cut it up; indeed I feel at times a love and joy For every weed and every thing, A feeling kindred from a boy, A feeling brought with every spring. And why? this shepherd's purse that grows In this strange spot, in days gone by Grew in the little garden rows Of my old home now left; and I Feel what I never felt before, This weed an ancient neighbour here, And though I own the spot no more Its every trifle makes it dear. The ivy at the parlour end, The woodbine at the garden gate, Are all and each affection's friend That rendered parting desolate. But times will change and friends must part, And nature still can make amends; Their memory lingers round the heart Like life, whose essence is its friends. Time looks on pomp with vengeful mood Or killing apathy's disdain; So where old marble cities stood Poor persecuted weeds remain. She feels a love for little things That very few can feel beside, And still the grass eternal springs Where castles stood and grandeur died. BOYHOOD PLEASURES Oh, could I feel my spirits beat As once they did when life, a boy, Went everywhere with dancing feet, Met everything with joy; Got nuts before the shells were brown, Shells, pith and all to eat, And dragged the crab-tree bushes down, And thought the bitter sweet; Ah, could I feel as I did then And so be glorious once agen! To think it fame to clamber up The highest tree to rob the crow, To think it worth the while to stoop For every weed that used to grow, To take home pockets-full of shells, Hurded as manhood hurds his wealth, To steal in where the cowslip dwells And crop quick handfuls up by stealth, Lest they who owned the close should come And threaten whips and drive us home. The hurry and the look behind, The valued prize of yellow flowers, The panting haste a tree to find When overtook by sudden showers; And then in spite of all the rain, When all the hedges hung with drops, We scrambled up the bush to gain A pink's nest almost at the top, Till shook boughs soaked us to the skin, And then the trouble we were in! Our cowslips soon were thrown away, And if the rain kept in the sky We in some hovel sneaked to play Until our jackets seemed as dry. How glad those days! look back agen, Man's spirits can't imagine how; For sorrows which we reckoned then Grow sweeter than our pleasures now; Time writes them with a golden pen But never lives them back agen. APPROACHING NIGHT Oh, take this world away from me! Its strife I cannot bear to see, Its very praises hurt me more Than e'en its coldness did before, Its hollow ways torment me now And start a cold sweat on my brow, Its noise I cannot bear to hear, Its joy is trouble to my ear, Its ways I cannot bear to see, Its crowds are solitudes to me. Oh, how I long to be agen That poor and independent man, With labour's lot from morn to night And books to read at candle-light; That followed labour in the field From light to dark when toil could yield Real happiness with little gain, Rich thoughtless health unknown to pain: Though leaning on my spade to rest, I've thought how richer folks were blest And knew not quiet was the best. AUTUMN MORNING The storm is heaving up the sky, The south is dark and dreary That smiled so brightâas once did I; But now I'm sad and weary, Heart-sick of what the world contains, Its pleasing and its smiling. Its pay's not half its cost in pains, For pleasure grows beguiling. The old wood heaves a massy wave Like rivers overflowing, And now the wind begins to rave And loud the storm is growing; So heaved the pleasures of the past In life's bright crowded morning, But oh, I long for peace at last, And trouble gives me warning. Heart-sick of every joy and care That darken and enlighten, I sink down in my elbow chairâ Oh, when will memory brighten? The storm has rattled down the wind, The sun again is dawning, O God, give me the joy to find A calm in autumn's morning. THE SECRET I loved thee, though I told thee not, Right earlily and long, Thou wert my joy in every spot, My theme in every song. And when I saw a stranger face Where beauty held the claim, I gave it like a secret grace The being of thy name. And all the charms of face or voice Which I in others see Are but the recollected choice Of what I felt for thee. IDLE FAME I would not wish the burning blaze Of fame around a restless world, The thunder and the storm of praise In crowded tumults heard and hurled. I would not be a flower to stand The stare of every passer-by; But in some nook of fairyland, Seen in the praise of beauty's eye. I would not be the common song For all the world to shout and praise, But just a theme remembered long By beauty in its sweetest days. I would not be applause's guest Where crowded praises fall in showers, But just a joy in beauty's breast, The music of her silent hours. I would not be the common talk, But just a choice in beauty's song, A whisper muttered in her walk, A rapture dropping from her tongue. I would not give a wish to see The praise that fashion has to bring, But feel it more than praise to be The song that beauty loves to sing, The kerchiefs that her bosom deck, Her airy garments' easy flow, And, wavering round her taper neck, Dark ringlets falling upon snow. I would not be the gaze of all, A tale for every mouth to tell, But oh, where beauty's glances fall In rapture, I'd be fain to dwell. Oh, I would be, as beauty's guest, The blossom which she tends and ties, The oftenest by her finger pressed, Gazed on the oftenest by her eyes; The arbour where she loves to rest, The page turned down to read and read, The sweetest thought within her breast That gives the poet beauty's meed. Go, envy, with thy gay parade, The worship and the scorn of praise! Leave me the solitary glade Where beauty in its pleasure strays. SONG'S ETERNITY What is song's eternity? Come and see. Can it noise and bustle be? Come and see. Praises sung or praises said Can it be? Wait awhile and these are deadâ Sigh, sigh; Be they high or lowly bred They die. What is song's eternity? Come and see. Melodies of earth and sky, Here they be. Song once sung to Adam's ears Can it be? Ballads of six thousand years Thrive, thrive; Songs awakened with the spheres Alive. Mighty songs that miss decay, What are they? Crowds and cities pass away Like a day. Books are writ and books are read; What are they? Years will lay them with the deadâ Sigh, sigh; Trifles unto nothing wed, They die. Dreamers, list the honey-bee; Mark the tree Where the bluecap, âtootle tee,â Sings a glee Sung to Adam and to Eveâ Here they be. When floods covered every bough, Noah's ark Heard that ballad singing now; Hark, hark, âTootle tootle tootle teeââ Can it be Pride and fame must shadows be? Come and seeâ Every season owns her own; Bird and bee Sing creation's music on; Nature's glee Is in every mood and tone Eternity. The eternity of song Liveth here; Nature's universal tongue Singeth here Songs I've heard and felt and seen Everywhere; Songs like the grass are evergreen: The giver Said âLive and beââand they have been, For ever. âSTILL UNCHANGEABLEâ Love can melt the stony-hearted, Love's a tie that can't be parted, Though so often crossed and thwarted. Love from coldest hopes can borrow Joys that shall be bright to-morrow, Though it often meets with sorrow. Love in every limb is blooming In that witching angel woman, Though age's storm is slowly coming. Joy, tripping light as any feather, Leads on in love's divinest weather, And one seat holds them all together. Cheek to cheek is pressed so tender, Love should from all ills defend her In every walk, and never wander. But how many have their meetings, Smiling lips and happy greetings, Tender looks and bosom-beatings, That shall part! and time, concealing, Tries to conquer every feeling: But memory will her sighs be stealing. There are faces thought the dearest, There are hearts once linked the nearest, That oft meet with lot severest: That met in love's divinest weather And ere their choice could part would rather Dieâand yet not come together! 'Tis more than love for this and t'other, Dearer than sister feels for brother, And earth but seldom owns another. And though the mind is crossed and thwarted And love's first thraldom cut and parted, It seems the dearest where it started. WITH GARMENTS FLOWING Come, come, my love, the bush is growing, The linnet sings the tune again He sung when thou with garments flowing Went talking with me down the lane, Dreaming of beauty ere I found thee, And musing by the bushes green; The wind, enamoured, streaming round thee Painted the visions I had seen. I guessed thy face without the knowing Was beautiful as e'er was seen; I thought so by thy garments flowing And gait as airy as a queen; Thy shape, thy size, could not deceive me; Beauty seemed hid in every limb; And then thy face, when seen, believe me, Made every former fancy dim. Yes, when thy face in beauty brightened The music of a voice divine, Upon my heart thy sweetness lightened; Life, love, that moment, all were thine; All I imagined musing lonely, When dreaming 'neath the greenwood tree, Seeming to fancy visions only, Breathed living when I met with thee. I wander oft, not to forget thee But just to feel those joys again, When by the hawbush stile I met thee And heard thy voice adown the lane Return me its good-humoured greeting; And oh, what music met my ear! And then thy looks of wonder meeting, To see me come and talk so near! Thy face that held no sort of scorning, Thy careless jump to reach the may; That bushâI saw it many a morning And hoped to meet thee many a day; Till winter came and stripped the bushes, The thistle withered on the moors, Hopes sighed like winds along the rushesâ I could not meet thee out of doors. But winter's gone and spring is going And by thy own fireside I've been, And told thee, dear, with garments flowing I met thee when the spring was green; When travellers through snow-deserts rustle, Far from the strife of humankind, How little seems the noise and bustle Of places they have left behind! And on that long-remembered morning When first I lost this heart of mine, Fame, all I'd hoped for, turned to scorning And love and hope lived wholly thine; I told thee, and with rapture glowing I heard thee more than once declare, That down the lane with garments flowing Thou with the spring wouldst wander there. BEAUTY Beauty is nothing but the power Which the admirer gives, The shadow of the fading flower That in the fancy lives. A sun it is of feeble kind, Tho' bright its little reign, Yet if a cloud doth cross the mind All is put out again. The daisy comes at early spring To win our first esteem, Summers their blushing roses bring To wake a sweeter dream; And then comes autumn's painted reign, With winter in her way: Thus ere we know the joys we gain From beauty, they decay. AFTER-FAME Time's stream in light is flowing, Where fame goes stirring on, Where the mighty are agoingâ Yet they never shall be gone. Their names are earth's for ever, A breath for every mind, Everlasting as the river, Never-ceasing as the wind. DISTANT HILLS What is there in those distant hills My fancy longs to see, That many a mood of joy instils? Say, what can fancy be? Do old oaks thicken all the woods, With weeds and brakes as here? Does common water make the floods, That's common everywhere? Is grass the green that clothes the ground? Are springs the common springs? Daisies and cowslips dropping round, Are such the flowers she brings? Their brooms are they [the] yellow broom, Their briers the smelling brier? Questions from fancy seldom come But such are everywhere. Does day come with its common sky That's seen both near and far? Does night the selfsame moon supply With many a little star? Are cottages of mud and stone, By valley, wood, and glen, And their calm dwellers little known Men, and but common men, That drive afield with carts and ploughs? Such men are common here, And pastoral maidens milking cows Are dwelling everywhere. If so my fancy idly clings To notions far away, And longs to roam for common things All round her every day, Right idle would the journey be To leave one's home so far, And see the moon I now can see And every little star. And have they there a night and day, And common counted hours? And do they see so far away This very moon of ours? I mark him climb above the trees With one small cousin star, And think me in my reveriesâ He cannot shine so far. And o'er his face that ancient man Will ever stooping be; What else he in no sort of plan Could ever get to see. The poets in the tales they tell And with their happy powers Have made lands where their fancies dwell Seem better lands than ours. Their storied woods and vales and streams Grow up within the mind Like beauty seen in pleasant dreams We nowhere else can find. Yet common things, no matter what, Which nature dignifies, If happiness be in their lot, They gratify our eyes. Some value things from being new, Yet nature keeps the old; She watches o'er the humblest too In blessings manifold. The common things of every day, However mean and small, The heedless eye may throw away, But she esteems them all. The common things in every place Display their sweets abroad, The daisy shows a happy face On every common sward. Why need I sigh far hills to see If grass is their array, While here the little paths go through The greenest every day? Such fancies fill the restless mind, At once to cheat and cheer With thought and semblance undefined, Nowhere and everywhere. THE STRANGER When trouble haunts me, need I sigh? No, rather smile away despair; For those have been more sad than I, With burthens more than I could bear; Ay, gone rejoicing under care Where I had sunk in black despair. When pain disturbs my peace and rest, Am I hopeless grief to keep, When some have slept on torture's breast And smiled as in the sweetest sleep, Ay, peace on thorns, in faith forgiven, And pillowed on the hope of heaven? Though low and poor and broken down, Am I to think myself distrest? No, rather laugh where others frown And think my being truly blest; For others I can daily see More worthy riches worse than me. Ay, once a stranger blest the earth Who never caused a heart to mourn, Whose very voice gave sorrow mirthâ And how did earth his worth return? It spurned him from its lowliest lot, The meanest station owned him not; An outcast thrown in sorrow's way, A fugitive that knew no sin, Yet in lone places forced to strayâ Men would not take the stranger in. Yet peace, though much himself he mourned, Was all to others he returned. Rebuke from him no sinner mourned, He never judged a man for wrong. Mercy to all his smile returned, Yet mercy scorned him all along, Ay, scorned him to the last, and then Condemned him as the worst of men. His presence was a peace to all, He bade the sorrowful rejoice. Pain turned to pleasure at his call, Health lived and issued from his voice. He healed the sick and sent abroad The dumb rejoicing in the Lord. The blind met daylight in his eye, The joys of everlasting day; The sick found health in his reply; The cripple threw his crutch away. Yet he with troubles did remain And suffered poverty and pain. Yet none could say of wrong he did, And scorn was ever standing by; Accusers by their conscience chid, When proof was sought, made no reply. Yet without sin he suffered more Than ever sinners did before. And yet for sin he suffered all To set the world-imprisoned free, To cheer the weary when they callâ And who could such a stranger be? The God, the Saviour from on high That aids the feeble. Need I sigh? THE OLD COTTAGERS The little cottage stood alone, the pride Of solitude surrounded every side. Bean-fields in blossom almost reached the wall; A garden with its hawthorn hedge was all The space between.âGreen light did pass Through one small window, where a looking-glass, Placed in the parlour, richly there revealed A spacious landscape and a blooming field. The pasture cows that herded on the moor Printed their footsteps to the very door, Where little summer flowers with seasons blow And scarcely gave the eldern leave to grow. The cuckoo that one listens far away Sung in the orchard trees for half the day; And where the robin lives, the village guest, In the old weedy hedge the leafy nest Of the coy nightingale was yearly found, Safe from all eyes as in the loneliest ground; And little chats that in beanstalks will lie A nest with cobwebs there will build, and fly Upon the kidney-bean that twines and towers Up little poles in wreaths of scarlet flowers. There a lone couple lived, secluded there From all the world considers joy or care, Lived to themselves, a long lone journey trod, And through their Bible talked aloud to God; While one small close and cow their wants maintained, But little needing, and but little gained. Their neighbour's name was peace, with her they went, With tottering age, and dignified content, Through a rich length of years and quiet days, And filled the neighbouring village with their praise. COUNTRY LETTER Dear brother Robin, this comes from us all With our kind love, and could Gip write and all Though but a dog he'd have his love to spare, For still he knows, and by your corner chair The moment he comes in he lies him down And seems to fancy you are in the town. This leaves us well in health, thank God for that! For old acquaintance Sue has kept your hat Which mother brushes ere she lays it by And every Sunday goes upstairs to cry. Jane still is yours till you come back agen And ne'er so much as dances with the men; And Ned the woodman every week comes in And asks about you kindly as our kin; And he with this and goody Thompson sends Remembrances with those of all our friends. Father with us sends love until he hears And mother she has nothing but her tears, Yet wishes you like us in health the same And longs to see a letter with your name, So, loving brother, don't forget to write. Old Gip lies on the hearth stone every night; Mother can't bear to turn him out of doors And never noises now of dirty floors; Father will laugh but lets her have her way, And Gip for kindness get a double pay. So Robin write and let us quickly see You don't forget old friends no more than we, Nor let my mother have so much to blame To go three journeys ere your letter came. THE FENS Wandering by the river's edge, I love to rustle through the sedge And through the woods of reed to tear Almost as high as bushes are. Yet, turning quick with shudder chill, As danger ever does from ill, Fear's moment-ague quakes the blood, While plop the snake coils in the flood And, hissing with a forkÃ¨d tongue, Across the river winds along. In coat of orange, green, and blue Now on a willow branch I view, Grey waving to the sunny gleam, Kingfishers watch the ripple stream For little fish that nimble by And in the gravel shallows lie. Eddies run before the boats, Gurgling where the fisher floats, Who takes advantage of the gale And hoists his handkerchief for sail On osier twigs that form a mastâ And quick his nutshell hurries past, While idly lies, nor wanted more, The sprit that pushed him on before. There's not a hill in all the view, Save that a forkÃ¨d cloud or two Upon the verge of distance lies And into mountains cheats the eyes. And as to trees, the willows wear Lopped heads as high as bushes are; Some taller things the distance shrouds, That may be trees or stacks or clouds, Or may be nothing; still they wear A semblance where there's naught to spare. Among the tawny tasselled reed The ducks and ducklings float and feed. With head oft dabbing in the flood They fish all day the weedy mud, And tumbler-like are bobbing there, Heels topsy-turvy in the air, Then up and quack and down they go, Heels over head again below. The geese in troops come droving up, Nibble the weeds, and take a sup; And closely puzzled to agree, Chatter like gossips over tea. The gander with his scarlet nose When strife's at height will interpose; And, stretching neck to that and this, With now a mutter, now a hiss, A nibble at the feathers too, A sort of âPray be quiet, do,â And turning as the matter mends, He stills them into mutual friends; Then in a sort of triumph sings And throws the water o'er his wings. Ah, could I see a spinney nigh, A puddock riding in the sky Above the oaks with easy sail On stilly wings and forkÃ¨d tail, Or meet a heath of furze in flower, I might enjoy a quiet hour, Sit down at rest, and walk at ease, And find a many things to please. But here my fancy's moods admire The naked levels till they tire, Nor e'en a mole-hill cushion meet To rest on when I want a seat. Here's little save the river scene, And grounds of oats in rustling green, And crowded growth of wheat and beans, That with the hope of plenty leans And cheers the farmer's gazing brow, Who lives and triumphs in the plough. One sometimes meets a pleasant sward Of swarthy grass; and quickly marred, The plough soon turns it into brown, And, when again one rambles down The path, small hillocks meet the eye And smoke beneath a burning sky. Green paddocks have but little charms With gain the merchandise of farms; And, muse and marvel where we may, Gain mars the landscape every dayâ The meadow grass turned up and copt, The trees to stumpy dotterels lopt, The hearth with fuel to supply For rest to smoke and chatter by; Giving the joy of home delights, The warmest mirth on coldest nights. And so for gain, that joys repay, Change cheats the landscapes every day, Nor trees nor bush about it grows That from the hatchet can repose, And the horizon stooping smiles O'er treeless fens of many miles. Spring comes and goes and comes agen, And all is nakedness and fen. SPEAR-THISTLE Where the broad sheepwalk opens bare and brown With scant grass ever pining after showers, And unchecked winds go fanning up and down The little strawy bents and nodding flowers, There the huge thistle, spurred with many thorns, The sun-crackt upland's russet swells adorns. Not undevoid of beauty there they come, Armed warriors, waiting neither suns nor showers, Guarding the little clover plots to bloom While sheep nor oxen dare not crop their flowers Unsheathing their own knobs of tawny flowers When summer cometh in her hottest hours. The pewit, swopping up and down And screaming round the passer-by, Or running o'er the herbage brown With copple crown uplifted high, Loves in its clumps to make a home Where danger seldom cares to come. The yellow-hammer, often prest For spot to build and be unseen, Will in its shelter trust her nest When fields and meadows glow with green; And larks, though paths go clÃ²sely by, Will in its shade securely lie. The partridge, too, that scarce can trust The open downs to be at rest, Will in its clumps lie down, and dust And prune its horseshoe-circled breast, And oft in shining fields of green Will lay and raise its brood unseen. The sheep, when hunger presses sore, May nip the clover round its nest; But soon the thistle, wounding sore, Relieves it from each brushing guest, That leaves a bit of wool behind, The yellow-hammer loves to find. The horse will set his foot and bite Close to the ground-lark's guarded nest And snort to meet the prickly sight; He fans the feathers of her breastâ Yet thistles prick so deep that he Turns back and leaves her dwelling free. Its prickly knobs the dews of morn Doth bead with dressing rich to see, When threads doth hang from thorn to thorn Like the small spinner's tapestry; And from the flowers a sultry smell Comes that agrees with summer well. The bee will make its bloom a bed, The bumble-bee in tawny brown; And one in jacket fringed with red Will rest upon its velvet down When overtaken in the rain, And wait till sunshine comes again. And there are times when travel goes Along the sheep-tracks' beaten ways, Then pleasure many a praise bestows Upon its blossoms' pointed rays, When other things are parched beside And hot day leaves it in its pride. THE DESTROYER In suns and showers luxuriant May came forth And spread her riches as of nothing worth, Cowslips and daisies, buttercups and crowds Without a name as if they dropt from clouds, On green and close and meadow everywhere, So thick, the green did almost disappear To gold and silver hues, and blooms did vie With the rich grass' luxuriant mastery. The simple shepherd in his early hour With almost every footstep crushed a flower. The winds did all they could, though oft in vain, To raise and form them on their stalks again, Yet some were crushed so much they could not rise, Finding in poet's heart a room for sighs. And those his dog beat down did hardly mind But formed again as happy as the wind, Leaving a lesson sad with every day That harm falls most in man's destroying way: And who could think in such a lovely time And such a spot, where quiet seemed in prime, As ne'er to be disturbed, that strife and fear Like crouching tigers had howled havoc here? THE EARLY DAISY With all the pleasant things That come with spring, What time the mavis builds and sings, I love the daisy well; Ere hedges throw a sprout Of greenness out They peep and shine about And care not where they dwell. Beside the garden pales Their silver bloom prevails And glads the children's tales While sitting there at play; In the grass they come and crowd, Wherever weed's allowed A footing, they are proud In glad spring's early day. Sallows that by the little pond recline And sweetly shine In tasselled gold seem not so sweet as thine Low blooming at their foot! I've thought so when a boy In play's employ, Racing the lambs in joy And resting at its root. The blackthorns like a sheet And faintly sweet Pale March in hedges meet Like snows in bloom, But daisies came before On green and moor And ere snowstorms were o'er I saw them come. The mind will dream and cling To pleasant things That come again with spring, As when health used to go Down little paths and spy Cowslips so nigh That, as we wandered by, Would pat agen the shoe. VIOLET AND DAISY The little violets blue and white, Refreshed with dews of sable night, Come shining in the morning light In thorn-enclosÃ¨d grounds; And, whether winds be cold or chill, When their rich smells delight instil, The young lamb blaas beside the hill On young spring's happy rounds. But roads are mire and hedges brown When daisies greet me up and down, Some with a red spot on the crown Spread open to the sky, That often frowns, and yet will smile, And with spring's hopes its love beguileâ Oh, may I shape my life the while With such an humble eye. A FIRESIDE SKETCH Where does comfort's bosom glow? Where lives he a tenant now? In snug places out of doors, Fields, or woods, or rushy moors? No, for winter occupies Every bit of earth and skies; Overhead the clouds are dull, Underfoot the roads are full Of mire and sludge, and water too, That slushes in the ploughman's shoe, And spatters from the hasty horse, That has the meadow's floods to cross. So where is comfort? can it be, Underneath the woodland tree, Where the shepherd still about Found primrose buds ere March was out, And maidens in the summer lay On their elbows in the hay? And labour's self, that could not bear To wear his lazy jacket there, Complains as much as any one And puts another garment on; And still, do all he ever may, He cannot keep the cold away. He buttons up as on he goes, His hat he slouches o'er his nose, And, glad to keep the storm behind, He turns his back upon the wind, And knocks his hands, and stamps his toes, And in his pockets as he goes Will hide themâyet, do what he may, He can't get out of winter's way. No, 'tis not there: the trees around Have thrown their shelter on the ground. The sheep lie quaking underneath, And cows seem almost starved to death, That rest awhile, then up again, Then streak and try to bite in vain; But grass is short on hill and swamp, They bite ten times before they champ, Till storms come on with wild affray. Then turning heads another way They hurkle underneath the bushes Knee-deep among the whistling rushes, And let them hurkle where they will They're in the way of winter still. So where is comfort? does he roam, Or, what is likelier, keep at home? Where smoke its sooty flight ascends And green logs frizzle at both ends With sap until it blazes highâ Till summer seems as sitting by: When industry in haste to go Will just one moment hold a toe, And toil, whose clothes are on the drop, That has but little time to stop, Half warms his fingers where he may And knocks them as he goes away, To make them and to keep them warm While doing jobs about the farm. Where is comfort? maybe, here; Sitting in the elbow chair, With a pipe beneath his nose, While the smoke at leisure goes Up agen the mantel-tree In a wreath of silver-grey; With a jug of gingered ale, Or little book that owns a tale For merry-making, not too long, And what is better, shorter songâ While in the chimney-top the snow Falls right upon the fire below With just a little quench, and then It seems to burn as bright agen. And when that's gone, they look for more, A heap of roots is at the door; And now a song, and now a tale, And now and then a jug of ale! The gloomiest day and roughest weather, Care's foot falls lighter than a feather And joy holds both his sides together Before he laughs, and all's akin To comfort, who is host within; Who lays another billet on, Begins good cheer; and when it's gone, The world and he are wholly quits, The king of hearty mirth he sits. The news so full of greedy wars, Of struggling honours, stubborn scars, No sooner in his presence lies But wonder bustles with surprise, Leaving content with heart at ease, And noisy war as quiet peace. With not one argument to spend In contradicting foe or friend, Or one worth while to waste with care, Ease occupies his cushioned chair. The world at earnest is but whim, He's naught with it, or it with him. All things in common he receives, Nor doubts in earnest, nor believes: He hears the weekly paper read, Then lifts his hand above his head His pipe to reach, his thoughts to ease, And smokes earth's troubles into peace, That sheds its fragrance all about, Until he knocks the ashes out: Then o'er his knees he pants to stoop, And garters his loose stockings up, And seeks his stick, and leaves his room To take a walk till dinner's come. Here comfort, like the miser's pelf, Is self all occupied with self, Heedless of either praise or blame, The same in all and just the same, Whose mind amusement never lacks, Content with last year's almanacs; Paper and print are books with him And difference but another's whim. A mind so easily supplied Makes as it thinks of all beside. And gossip, who with industry Could never long agree to be, Although her tongue more toil commands Than he can do with both his hands, She leaves the news from door to door And every morning looks for moreâ In vain she taps the arm of ease And tells the likeliest tale to please; He scarcely turns his head awry And âhumphâ and âha'sâ his whole reply. She waiting keeps the empty chair, And cannot sit, but stands to hear The news looked o'erâand all the rest, Too long to listen to, is guessed; Then bids good-day, a grace for news, And busy idleness pursues, As satisfied with fools' deceit As honest people are with meat. Her whisper worries mischief on, Then waits until the noise is gone, And in the tempest will contrive To be the harmless'st thing alive, Playing bo-peep behind the screen At all the world, and still unseen. A grape on thistles never grows, And peace with gossip never goes; O comfort, be it mine to live, Far from the cure she has to give, A blameless and a quiet life, As comfort's partner all my life; And as to trouble, pain, or care, Let them not have a sigh to spare; But comfort, let me live with him, Right sound at heart and stout of limb! Then, comfort, edge thy chair away, I'll be thy votary, if I may. HARVEST RHYME The harvest morn, a busy manâ There's naught can do without himâ Has scarce a minute in his hands To rest and look about him. The wheat is shining in the stowk, The barley's flung together, The beans begin to black and drowk And merry is the weather. The mist is early forced to run, The sun it burns him early, And the dykes they reek before the sun Has dried the bearded barley: So by the hedge the shockers sat In the day's grey mellow dawning And with the snuff-box seasoned chat In the harvest's early morning. The morning, like the grazing horse Up, out, and stirring early, Their giant shadows stalk across Some three or four lands of barley; The boy with shouldered fork and rake Laughs loud and halloos earlyâ âWhat a soldier would my shadow make As he marches by the barley!â The milkmaid singing like a boy With her yokes upon her shoulder Has in her face such health and joy, All love her that behold her. The partridge where she nimbles past Whews up with sudden warning And the hare bolts from his bunch of grass, So early in the morning, But the lark sits on the barley swath As she passes to the pasture And though the mouse runs o'er her path He meets with no disaster; With not a thought to hurt or harm, All ways of mischief scorning, She sings along the busy farm The joy of every morning. Through the hedge the horse-boy rustles past Where the horses blundered through; O'er head and shoulders pattering fast He shakes down showers of dew. His dirty slop as dabbled shows As in a shower of rain, But careless as a song he goes And cracks them from the grain. ON A JOURNEY: FRAGMENT The coy hedge-sparrow flaps her wing And hops about the hedges, And soon to brood the early spring Will have some downy pledges; They'll lift their heads and cree and crow Hid by the dyke's bulrushes, Almost before the winter haw Has left the leafing bushes. The blackbird's wing was drabbling wet With the shower so sudden coming As on the whitethorn bush he sat Where the wild white rose was blooming; The young ones in a nest of love, Where the hedge the bramble hopples, Cree'd, cawed and stretched their necks above With their down all hung with dropples. The jay set up his copple crown And screamed to see a stranger And swopt and hurried up and down To warn the birds of danger; And magpies where the spinney was Noised five and six together, While patiently the woodman's ass Stood stretching round his tether. THE GREENWOOD SIDE The stray path rambles through the furze That gives the balmy smells of June, The glad wind all the bushes stirs, Brown linnet chitters o'er a tune: Then, maiden, walk and hear the lay, And be a friend with joy to-day. The wild heath spreads a table green, Health, hope, and joy are at the feast, Then on my arm in pleasure lean And journey here a welcome guest: Then come away and let us find Joys that for years will please the mind. What is there half so sweet and dear As sweet discourse from lips we love In earth's green spots and places where Joys breathe a blessing from above, And, free from care's disquiet ways, Find things to profit and to praise? Come, throw domestic cares aside, Home toils may wait another day; Delay waits by the greenwood side And stoops for blossoms by the way, Where arm in arm and side by side We'll dally o'er the heath so wide. Here's flowers of almost every kind, Blue little bells scarce reach your foot, Shake so enticing to the wind They'll make ye stoop to get the root; And there's the ling to tempt your stay, To get a load and take away. Briers crossing paths I'll trample down, And bur-balls which we wander through, I'll stoop to pluck them from thy gown And feel it honour so to do; Love has so many things to say, Come with the instant nor delay. Hasten and leave delay behind, The sun has half his journey gone; Haste bending to the summer wind While one hand holds thy bonnet on. E'en now thy vision fills my eye And beauty's garment flutters by. ROUND OAK AND EASTWELL In my own native field two fountains run All desolate and naked to the sun; The fell destroyer's hand hath reft their side Of every tree that hid and beautified Their shallow waters in delightful clumps, That sunburnt now o'er pebbles skips and jumps. One where stone quarries in its hills are broke Still keeps its ancient pastoral name, Round Oak, Although one little solitary tree Is all that's left of its old pedigree; The other, more deformed, creeps down the dell, Scarcely the shade of what was once Eastwell, While the elm-groves that groaned beneath no tax Have paid their tribute to the lawless axe, And the old rooks that waited other springs Have fled to stranger scenes on startled wings. The place all lonely and all naked lies, And Eastwell spring in change's symphonies Boils up its sand unnoticed and alone, To all its former happiness unknown, Its glory gone, its Sunday pastimes o'er, The haunts of shepherds and of maids no more. The passer-by unheeding tramples on Nor heeds the spring, nor trees nor bushes gone, While the stray poet's memory haunts the spot Like a friend's features time hath nigh forgot. WINTER IN THE FENS So moping flat and low our valleys lie, So dull and muggy is our winter sky, Drizzling from day to day with threats of rain, And when that falls still threatening on again; From one wet week so great an ocean flows That every village to an island grows, And every road for even weeks to come Is stopt, and none but horsemen go from home; And one wet night leaves travel's best in doubt, And horseback travellers ask if floods are out Of every passer-by, and with their horse The meadow's ocean try in vain to cross; The horse's footings with a sucking sound Fill up with water on the firmest ground, And ruts that dribble into brooks elsewhere Can find no fall or flat to dribble here; But filled with wet they brim and overflow Till hollows in the road to rivers grow; Then wind with sudden rage, abrupt and blea, Twirls every lingering leaf from off each tree. Such is our lowland scene that winter gives, And strangers wonder where our comfort lives; Yet in a little close, however keen The winter comes, I find a patch of green, Where robins, by the miser winter made Domestic, flirt and perch upon the spade; And in a little garden-close at home I watch for springâand there's the crocus come! MORNING SHOWERS Now the meadow water smokes, And the hedgerow's dripping oaks Pitter-patter all around And dimple the once dusty ground; The spinners' threads about the weeds Are hung with little drops in beads; Clover silver-green becomes, And purple-blue surrounds the plums, And every place breathes fresh and fair When morning pays her visit there. The waterfowl with suthering wing Dive down the river, splash and spring Up to the very clouds again That sprinkle scuds of coming rain, That fly and drizzle all the day Till dripping grass is turned to grey; The various clouds [now] move or lie Like mighty travellers in the sky, All mountainous and ridged and curled, That may have travelled round the world. When the rain at midday stops, Spangles glitter in the drops, And, as each thread a sunbeam was, Cobwebs glitter in the grass. The sheep all loaded with the rain Try to shake it off again, And ere dried by wind and sun The load will scarcely let them run. CLOUD SHAPES Clouds rack and drive before the wind In shapes and forms of every kind, Like waves that rise without the roar, And rocks that guard an untrodden shore; Now castles pass majestic by And ships in peaceful havens lie; These gone, ten thousand shapes ensue, For ever beautiful and new. The scattered clouds lie calm and still, And day throws gold on every hill; Their thousand heads in glory run, As each were worlds and owned a sun. The rime it clings to everything, It beards the early buds of spring; The mossy pales, the orchard spray, Are feathered with its silver-grey. THE MEADOW LAKE I've often gazed with pleasure by the edge Of the old meadow lake, floodwashed and crook'd, The water-rat slow rustling in the sedge, The fish-ring wavering in the clear; I've looked In rapture on the mellow summer shine Of the still water gleaming in the sun, Just wrinkled by the plash of quiet kine Who knee-deep in the flags would drinkâand done, Back to their feed on the shorn sward again; The flags, the bulrush, and the barbÃ¨d leaf Of water-weed, bethread with lighter vein, And water-lily giving flies relief, Who float half drowsy to its sheltering bayâ These lie close on the water and still dry: If dropples plash upon them from the spring Of playful fish, they scarce a moment lie But roll like water from the moor-hen's wing, Its oily green still sunny as before. Thus musing on the brink, a startled fright Comes with a sudden plunge from t'other side, And flags and rush in quick disorder start When, instant, musing shepherd is descried, Whose dog ran forward with a gladsome heart To hunt the water-rat and scared moor-hen Who dives and flounders and then dives agen; Till weary quite, once more he seeks the side, And shakes the water from his dripping hide, And rolls upon the grass and dances round The shepherd as he soodles round the ground. FRAGMENTS The hedgerow hips to glossy scarlet turn, Haws swarm so thick till bushes seem to burn, And blackthorn sloes, some hung in misty dew, True to the season, darken into blue. Morn comes again; the dark melts into grey, And all the heaven's spangles go away, Save one bright star that winks and twinkles still, Till the sun starts him off against his will; Then the heaven's mantle seems on earth to pass And buttercups turn stars amid the grass. The girning winds bit sharp and thin And made the early riser blow his nails, And crizzling frost shot needles in the dyke And crumpt beneath the feet down grassy vales. An ocean almost boundless to the mind Of yellow harvest rolls before the wind; Look where we will, the waves of plenty run, And light and shadow hurries from the sun That looks so gloriously; and by and by The farmer comes and rubs the ears to try Its ripeness; and at once the fields display The glittering hook that rustles every way. The burnet's tawny knopples Like little honeycombsâ Bees seeking honey dinners With many passing hums Would come and set them bowing And their sweets would so detain They'd turn again when gone away And bend them down again. The weeds beside the hedge dance Like so many drunken men, Then rest till breezes whisper, Then up and dance agen; The meadow-sweet in darksome green Shines in the merry light, Till winds lift up their undersides And then they change to white. The fieldling flower it thrives the best The furthest off from every eye, The bird is happier on her nest Where but the sheep go grazing by; Ah me, I think that I could rest And think and sleep deliciously, A time-worn forest's hermit-guest, And fix a tent beneath a tree. MYSTERY There is a vague oblivion, dark and vast As is the future, fruitless as the past To fathom and unravel to the end, Of great adventure's darings. Books are penned Mere guesses into truth, and at the last Mere guesses only, going where they came To that exhaustless blank that swallows all With shadows and with darkness overcast. There mystery lives indefinite and grand, Wed to a million fames: Perouse and all His gallant navigators left the land For earth's remotest depths, and where they fell Discovery's courage ne'er can understand, Nor rumour's thousand trumpets ever tell. PLEASURES OF POESY To me hath poesy been a recompense And pleasure not to be described but by The inward thought; words cannot tell from whence The feelings that the still heart profits by In brooding moods where fancy loves to lie Afar from all ambitions but her own, Picturing strange landscapes of delight and joy, Beauty's delightful places, where the eye Sees things more fair than earth hath ever known, Where the great masters of the past inherit Green memories and glad visions that atone For all the troubles and disquietude That spurning fortune leaveth with their merit, Marring their lives with tempests ever rude. SUNSET VISIONS The sunset even of a winter's day Leaves beauties every time it goes away, And in the west most gloriously weaves A world of visions, every time it leaves. Oh, when life's voyage in these storms is done, For such a city clothed in such a sun! For I have gazed, when day and toil were by, And saw such splendid places in the sky, Such cities, palaces, and golden hills, And seas that calmest happiness instils, And felt that surely fancy could not so Impose upon the mind with every glow That truth or fiction could invent or see, Seeming as rich, and yet as nothing be. No, something cometh to the gazing mind, And when the colours fade, bright hope remains behind. PASTORAL LIBERTY Oh, for the unshackled mood as free as air, And pleasure wild as birds upon the wing, The unwronged impulse won from seasons fair Like birds' perennial travels with the spring! Come, peace and joy, the unworn path to trace, Crossing ling-heaths and hazel-crowded glen, Where health salutes me with its ruddy face And joy breathes freely from the strife of men. Oh, lead me anywhere but in the crowd! On some lone island rather would I be Than in the world, worn knowledge noising loud, Wealth gathering up and losing; leave with me Calm joy and humble hope from quiet won, To live in peace unhurt and hurting none. THE CLUMP OF FERN Here underneath the stile's moss-covered post A little bunch of fern doth thrive and spring, Hid from the noisy wind and coming frost Like late-reared young 'neath the wood-pigeon's wing. I've seen beneath the furze-bush clumps of ling, So beautiful in pinky knots of bloom, That made the inmost heart's emotions breathe A favourite love for the unsocial heath, That gives man no inviting hopes to come To fix his dwelling and disturb the scene. So, in my loneliness of mood, this green Large clump of crimpled fern-leaves doth bequeath Like feelings; and wherever wanderers roam Some little scrap of happiness is seen. HEREAFTER The past we know; but hope can find no rest In what is gone; time's flood is rolling there; And childhood's play, green memories once so blest, And youth's love-bowers so ignorant of care Are overwhelmed in waters of despair. Hope's dreary visits there can find no rest, But turn again to this sad heart to sigh. The past is o'er, the present is distress; Hope sickens in the storms that pass not by, While deep as darkness fate's hid mysteries lie, Whose very shadows seem to startle fear, And shrinks from knowledge that approaches nigh, The knowledge where futurity sojourns, Where every traveller goes and none returns. LABOUR'S LEISURE Oh, for the feelings and the careless health That found me toiling in the fields, the joy I felt at eve with not a wish for wealth, When, labour done and in the hedge put by My delving spade, I homeward used to hie With thoughts of books I often read by stealth Beneath the blackthorn clumps at dinner-hour; It urged my weary feet with eager speed To hasten home where winter fire did shower Scant light, now felt as beautiful indeed Where bending o'er my knees I used to read With earnest heed all books that had the power To give me joy in most delicious ways And rest my spirits after weary days. THE MUSIC OF NATURE Children-like insects dancing in the sun; Bees like the busy crowds in labour's power; Rainfalls shed music in the drops that run Out from the brimful spring and wet each flower, Bending its features downward, like a nun Musing upon her shadow, by the light That makes the surface glass-like and conveys Reflection; dimpling streams give music bright To hushing showers, as echoes of sweet praise And instances of thought in wisdom's ways; The great Orion and the Pleiades Pervade the spheres and thrones celestial crowned, And all ascensive nature, by degrees, Is omnipresent with melodious sound. YOUNG LAMBS The spring is coming by a many signs; The trays are up, the hedges broken down, That fenced the haystack, and the remnant shines Like some old antique fragment weathered brown. And where suns peep, in every sheltered place, The little early buttercups unfold A glittering star or twoâtill many trace The edges of the blackthorn clumps in gold. And then a little lamb bolts up behind The hill and wags his tail to meet the yoe, And then another, sheltered from the wind, Lies all his length as deadâand lets me go Close by and never stirs, but beaking lies, With legs stretched out as though he could not rise. EARLY NIGHTINGALE When first we hear the shy-come nightingales, They seem to mutter o'er their songs in fear, And, climb we e'er so soft the spinney rails, All stops as if no bird was anywhere. The kindled bushes with the young leaves thin Let curious eyes to search a long way in, Until impatience cannot see or hear The hidden music; gets but little way Upon the pathâwhen up the songs begin, Full loud a moment and then low again. But when a day or two confirms her stay Boldly she sings and loud for half the day; And soon the village brings the woodman's tale Of having heard the new-come nightingale. WINTER WALK The holly bush, a sober lump of green, Shines through the leafless shrubs all brown and grey, And smiles at winter, be it e'er so keen, With all the leafy luxury of May. And oh, it is delicious, when the day In winter's loaded garment keenly blows And turns her back on sudden falling snows, To go where gravel pathways creep between Arches of evergreen that scarce let through A single feather of the driving storm; And in the bitterest day that ever blew The walk will find some places still and warm Where dead leaves rustle sweet and give alarm To little birds that flirt and start away. THE SOLDIER Home furthest off grows dearer from the way; And when the army in the Indias lay Friends' letters coming from his native place Were like old neighbours with their country face. And every opportunity that came Opened the sheet to gaze upon the name Of that loved village where he left his sheep For more contented peaceful folk to keep; And friendly faces absent many a year Would from such letters in his mind appear. And when his pockets, chafing through the case, Wore it quite out ere others took the place, Right loath to be of company bereft He kept the fragments while a bit was left. PLOUGHMAN SINGING Here morning in the ploughman's songs is met Ere yet one footstep shows in all the sky, And twilight in the east, a doubt as yet, Shows not her sleeve of grey to know her by. Woke early, I arose and thought that first In winter-time of all the world was I. The old owls might have hallooed if they durst, But joy just then was up and whistled by A merry tune which I had known full long, But could not to my memory wake it back, Until the ploughman changed it to the song. O happiness, how simple is thy track! âTinged like the willow shoots, the east's young brow Glows red and finds thee singing at the plough. SPRING'S MESSENGERS Where slanting banks are always with the sun The daisy is in blossom even now; And where warm patches by the hedges run The cottager when coming home from plough Brings home a cowslip root in flower to set. Thus ere the Christmas goes the spring is met Setting up little tents about the fields In sheltered spots.âPrimroses, when they get Behind the wood's old roots, where ivy shields Their crimpled, curdled leaves, will shine and hide. âCart-ruts and horses' footings scarcely yield A slur for boys, just crizzled and that's all. Frost shoots his needles by the small dyke side, And snow in scarce a feather's seen to fall. LETTER IN VERSE Like boys that run behind the loaded wain For the mere joy of riding back again, When summer from the meadow carts the hay And school hours leave them half a day to play; So I with leisure on three sides a sheet Of foolscap dance with poesy's measured feet, Just to ride post upon the wings of time And kill a care, to friendship turned in rhyme. The muse's gallop hurries me in sport With much to read and little to divert, And I, amused, with less of wit than will, Run till I tire.âAnd so to cheat her still, Like children running races who shall be First in to touch the orchard wall or tree, The last half-way behind, by distance vext, Turns short, determined to be first the next; So now the muse has run me hard and longâ I'll leave at once her races and her song; And turning round, laugh at the letter's close And beat her out by ending it in prose. SNOWSTORM (I) What a night! The wind howls, hisses, and but stops To howl more loud, while the snow volley keeps Incessant batter at the window-pane, Making our comforts feel as sweet again; And in the morning, when the tempest drops, At every cottage door mountainous heaps Of snow lie drifted, that all entrance stops Until the besom and the shovel gain The path, and leave a wall on either side. The shepherd, rambling valleys white and wide, With new sensations his old memory fills, When hedges left at night, no more descried, Are turned to one white sweep of curving hills, And trees turned bushes half their bodies hide. SNOWSTORM (II) The boy that goes to fodder with surprise Walks o'er the gate he opened yesternight. The hedges all have vanished from his eyes; E'en some tree-tops the sheep could reach to bite. The novel scene engenders new delight, And, though with cautious steps his sports begin, He bolder shuffles the huge hills of snow, Till down he drops and plunges to the chin, And struggles much and oft escape to winâ Then turns and laughs but dare not further go; For deep the grass and bushes lie below, Where little birds that soon at eve went in With heads tucked in their wings now pine for day And little feel boys o'er their heads can stray. SIGNS OF WINTER The cat runs races with her tail. The dog Leaps o'er the orchard hedge and knarls the grass. The swine run round and grunt and play with straw, Snatching out hasty mouthfuls from the stack. Sudden upon the elm-tree tops the crow Unceremonious visit pays and croaks, Then swops away. From mossy barn the owl Bobs hasty outâwheels round and, scared as soon, As hastily retires. The ducks grow wild And from the muddy pond fly up and wheel A circle round the village and soon, tired, Plunge in the pond again. The maids in haste Snatch from the orchard hedge the mizzled clothes And laughing hurry in to keep them dry. SUNRISE IN SUMMER The summer's morning sun creeps up the blue O'er the flat meadows' most remotest view: A bit at first peeps from the splendid ball, Then more, and more, until we see it all. And then so ruddy and so cool it lies, The gazer views it with unwatering eyes, And cattle opposite its kindly shine Seem something feeding in a land divine: Ruddy at first, yet ere a minute's told Its burning red keeps glowing into gold, And o'er the fenny level richly flows, Till seeded dock in shade a giant grows; Then blazing bright with undefinÃ¨d day He turns the morning's earnest gaze away. THE HERONRY Within a pleasant lawn where pleasure strays And I with friendship found her many days, Where summer comes in haste and leaves but slow And seems from such a place as loath to go, Where gravel walks creep under evergreens And lawns embosomed open lovely scenes, There on the fish-pond one small island lies Where a tall clump of firdales meet the eyes; And when the spring with joy the earth invests Each tree-top seems as bending down with nests; For there a troop of heronshaws repair And yearly pile a stack of dwellings there, Crank on the trees and on their branches stand, And the whole scene seems changed to foreign land. OLD DYKES I often wander by the ancient dykes, Flood-washed into unnumbered crooks and turns, Where many an antique tree my fancy strikes That as an ancient privilege sojourns Upon its banks: some wasted to a shell Where oft from sudden showers path-passers hide; Some twisted various ways as like to drop, And some half tumbled downâyet ere they fell Grew steadfastâwhere the shepherd climbs at top To shorten steps and jump on t'other side; Some with their trunks into the water lean, Then crooking like a bow turn up and throw A spreading bower of rich luxurious green Over the angler's head who sits below. SHOWERS The fitful weather changes every hour, And many a footstep hurries from the shower; The men at plough, the shepherd on the lea, Look up and scamper to the nearest tree; The ditcher, ere the last shower's hardly gone, Runs to the bush and puts his jacket on, And in escaping haste is often seen To where the ash hangs o'er the thistly green, An hollow dotterel wasted to a shell, Large as a little hut and known as well To all the outdoor tenants in the fields, That from the heaviest tempest shelter yields; Here two or three were met to shun the rain That slowly cleared and faster fell again. WINTER FIELDS Oh, for a pleasant book to cheat the sway Of winterâwhere rich mirth with hearty laugh Listens and rubs his legs on corner seat; For fields are mire and sludgeâand badly off Are those who on their pudgy paths delay; There striding shepherd, seeking driest way, Fearing night's wetshod feet and hacking cough That keeps him waken till the peep of day, Goes shouldering onward and with ready hook Progs oft to ford the sloughs that nearly meet Across the lands; croodling and thin to view, His loath dog followsâstops and quakes and looks For better roads, till whistled to pursue; Then on with frequent jump he hurkles through. RIVER SCENE Now came the river sweeping round the nooks, By thirsty summer's pilgrimage subdued; Dark and yet clear the glassy water looks, As slow and easy in majestic mood It sweeps along by osier-crowded glen Until it seems an almost naked flood Along the flats of the unwooded fen; Yet even there prolific summer dwells And garnishes its sides in vivid green Of flags and reeds, the otter's pathless den. Now lane without a guidepost plainly tells The homeward path, while from a stile is seen The open church tower and its little bells And chimneys low where peaceful quiet dwells. FOOTPATHS (II) Now tracking fields where passenger appears As wading to his waist in crowding grain, Wherever as we pass the bending ears Pat at our sides and gain their place again; Then crooked stile, with little steps that aid The climbing, meets us; and the pleasant grass And hedgerows old with arbours ready made For weariness to rest in pleasant shade Surround us; and with ecstasy we pass Wild flower and insect tribes that ever mate With joy and dance from every step we take In numberless confusion; all employ Their little aims for peace and pleasure's sake, And every summer's footpath leads to joy. FOOTPATHS (III) Now sudden as a pleasure unawares A wooden plank strides o'er a little brook, That unto thirst the sweetest boon prepares, Paved o'er with pebbles to the very brink; And so invitingly its waters look, Though not athirst, it urges us to drink; Then comes a sloping hill, and what's beyond? We stray to look and find a little pond, Where dotterel trees bend as if falling in, And sallow bushes, of their station fond, Stretch from each side and welcome meeting win, Where snug the hermit moor-hen loves to lie, Who from the passing footstep plunges in And from his old haunt seldom dares to fly. FOOTPATHS (IV) Now, almost hid in trees, a little gate Cheats us into the darkness of the wood; We almost think the day is wearing late, So dreamy is the light that dwells around; And so refreshing is its sombre mood, We feel at once, shut out from sun and sky, All the deliciousness of solitude, While sauntering noiseless o'er the leafy ground; The air we breathe seems void of every trace Of earth and all its trouble, and the mind Yearns for a dwelling in so sweet a place, From trouble's noise, such stillness seemeth by; But soon the ride brings some unwelcome spire To bid the charm of solitude retire. FOOTPATHS (V) Yet still the little path winds on and on Down hedgerow sides and many a pastoral charm; We soon forget the charm of poesy gone In the still woodland with its silent balm, And find some other joy to dream upon: A distant notice of some nestling farm, Crowded with russet stacks that peep between Huge homestead elms or orchard's squatting trees, Where apples shine sun-tanned and mellow green, Home comforts for dull winter reveries, When the long evening claimeth news and friends; Calm pleasures thus home-nearing fancy sees, That maketh banished fancies full amends As the crook'd footpath at the village ends. EARLY IMAGES (II) And mark the nimble swallow jerk and fling Its flight o'er new-mown meadows happily, And cuckoo, quivering upon narrow wing, Take sudden flitting from the neighbouring tree, And heron, stalking solitary thing, Mount up into high travel far away, And that mild indecision hanging round Skies holding bland communion with the ground In gentlest pictures of the infant day, Now picturing rainâwhile many a pleasing sound Grows mellower, distant in the mealy grey Of dewy pastures, and full many a sight Looms sweeter in its indistinct array Than when it glows in morning's stronger light. PEACEFUL SCENES Ay, there's a wholesome feeling out of doors That nourishes the heart with happy themes; The very cattle on the flaggy moors To the mind's eye a pleasant picture seems, And occupations of home husbandry, Some with the plough, some singing by the side Of the slow wagon; and when these I see, They give such blameless pictures void of strife, Such sweet employments 'neath a smiling sky, I even feel that better lot of life, That in such spots calm providence is by, And sweet domestic peace, whose quiet eye Feels most delight in its own humble home And checks the restless mood that often longs to roam. FIR-WOOD The fir-trees taper into twigs and wear The rich blue-green of summer all the year, Softening the roughest tempest almost calm And offering shelter ever still and warm To the small path that travels underneath, Where loudest windsâalmost as summer's breathâ Scarce fan the weed that lingers green below When others out of doors are lost in snow. And sweet the music trembles on the ear As the wind suthers through each tiny spear, Makeshifts for leaves; and yet, so rich they show, Winter is almost summer where they grow. FIELD PATH The beans in blossom with their spots of jet Smelt sweet as gardens wheresoever met; The level meadow grass was in the swath; The hedge-brier rose hung right across the path, White over with its flowers; the grass that lay Bleaching beneath the twittering heat to hay Smelt so deliciously, the puzzled bee Went wondering where the honey sweets could be; And passer-by along the level rows Stoopt down and whipt a bit beneath his nose. THE OLD MAN The stranger, striding down the paths of spring, Will turn half round a stooping man to see, And wonder why a man so old should sing Humming along as bums the bumble-bee; For though so old, a merry man is he, And where he goes right merry is the way; You hear him ere you see him down the grain, As sings the skylark at the peep of day, Or trudging on the narrow crooked lane. GRASSHOPPERS Grasshoppers go in many a thrumming spring And now to stalks of tasselled sour-grass cling, That shakes and swees awhile, but still keeps straight; While arching oxeye doubles with his weight. Next on the cat-tail grass with farther bound He springs, that bends until they touch the ground. BADGER When midnight comes a host of dogs and men Go out and track the badger to his den, And put a sack within the hole, and lie Till the old grunting badger passes by. He comes and hearsâthey let the strongest loose. The old fox hears the noise and drops the goose. The poacher shoots and hurries from the cry, And the old hare half wounded buzzes by. They get a forkÃ¨d stick to bear him down And clap the dogs and take him to the town, And bait him all the day with many dogs, And laugh and shout and fright the scampering hogs. He runs along and bites at all he meets: They shout and hollo down the noisy streets. He turns about to face the loud uproar And drives the rebels to their very door. The frequent stone is hurled where'er they go; When badgers fight, then every one's a foe. The dogs are clapt and urged to join the fray; The badger turns and drives them all away. Though scarcely half as big, demure and small, He fights with dogs for hours and beats them all. The heavy mastiff, savage in the fray, Lies down and licks his feet and turns away. The bulldog knows his match and waxes cold, The badger grins and never leaves his hold. He drives the crowd and follows at their heels And bites them throughâthe drunkard swears and reels. The frighted women take the boys away, The blackguard laughs and hurries on the fray. He tries to reach the woods, an awkward race, But sticks and cudgels quickly stop the chase. He turns agen and drives the noisy crowd And beats the many dogs in noises loud. He drives away and beats them every one, And then they loose them all and set them on. He falls as dead and kicked by boys and men, Then starts and grins and drives the crowd agen; Till kicked and torn and beaten out he lies And leaves his hold and cackles, groans, and dies. THE FOX The shepherd on his journey heard when nigh His dog among the bushes barking high; The ploughman ran and gave a hearty shout, He found a weary fox and beat him out. The ploughman laughed and would have ploughed him in, But the old shepherd took him for the skin. He lay upon the furrow stretched for dead, The old dog lay and licked the wounds that bled, The ploughman beat him till his ribs would crack, And then the shepherd slung him at his back; And when he rested, to his dog's surprise, The old fox started from his dead disguise; And while the dog lay panting in the sedge He up and snapt and bolted through the hedge. He scampered to the bushes far away; The shepherd called the ploughman to the fray; The ploughman wished he had a gun to shoot. The old dog barked and followed the pursuit. The shepherd threw his hook and tottered past; The ploughman ran, but none could go so fast; The woodman threw his faggot from the way And ceased to chop and wondered at the fray. But when he saw the dog and heard the cry He threw his hatchetâbut the fox was by. The shepherd broke his hook and lost the skin; He found a badger-hole and bolted in. They tried to dig, but, safe from danger's way, He lived to chase the hounds another day. THE VIXEN Among the taller wood with ivy hung, The old fox plays and dances round her young. She snuffs and barks if any passes by And swings her tail and turns prepared to fly. The horseman hurries by, she bolts to see, And turns agen, from danger never free. If any stands she runs among the poles And barks and snaps and drives them in the holes. The shepherd sees them and the boy goes by And gets a stick and progs the hole to try. They get all still and lie in safety sure, And out again when everything's secure, And start and snap at blackbirds bouncing by To fight and catch the great white butterfly. TURKEYS The turkeys wade the close to catch the bees In the old border full of maple trees, And often lay away and breed and come And bring a brood of chelping chickens home. The turkey gobbles loud and drops his rag And struts and sprunts his tail and then lets drag His wing on ground and makes a huzzing noise, Nauntles at passer-by and drives the boys And bounces up and flies at passer-by. The old dog snaps and grins, nor ventures nigh. He gobbles loud and drives the boys from play; They throw their sticks and kick and run away. MARTEN The marten cat, long-shagged, of courage good, Of weasel shape, a dweller in the wood, With badger hair, long-shagged, and darting eyes, And lower than the common cat in size, Small head, and ever running on the stoop, Snuffing the ground, and hind-parts shouldered upâ He keeps one track and hides in lonely shade Where print of human foot is never made, Save when the woods are cut: the beaten track The woodman's dog will snuff, cock-tailed and black, Red-legged, and spotted over either eye: Snuffs, barks, and scrats the lice, and passes by. The great brown hornÃ¨d owl looks down below, And sees the shaggy marten come and go. The marten hurries through the woodland gaps, And poachers shoot and make his skin for caps. When any woodmen come and pass the place, He looks at dogs and scarcely mends his pace. And gipsies often and bird-nesting boys Look in the hole and hear a hissing noise. They climb the treeâsuch noise they never heard, And think the great owl is a foreign bird; When the grey owl her young ones cloaks in down, Seizes the boldest boy and drives him down. They try agen and pelt to start the fray. The grey owl comes and drives them all away, And leaves the marten twisting round his den, Left free from boys and dogs and noisy men. THE SQUIRREL'S NEST One day, when all the woods were bare and blea, I wandered out to take a pleasant walk And saw a strange-formed nest on stoven tree Where startled pigeon buzzed from bouncing hawk. I wondered strangely what the nest could be And thought besure it was some foreign bird, So up I scrambled in the highest glee, And my heart jumped at every thing that stirred. 'Twas oval shaped; strange wonder filled my breast; I hoped to catch the old one on her nest When something bolted outâI turned to seeâ And a brown squirrel pattered up the tree. 'Twas lined with moss and leaves, compact and strong; I sluthered down and wondering went along. THE HEDGEHOG The hedgehog hides beneath the rotten hedge And makes a great round nest of grass and sedge, Or in a bush or in a hollow tree; And many often stoop and say they see Him roll and fill his prickles full of crabs And creep away; and where the magpie dabs His wing at muddy dyke, in aged root He makes a nest and fills it full of fruit, On the hedge bottom hunts for crabs and sloes And whistles like a cricket as he goes. It rolls up like a ball or shapeless hog When gipsies hunt it with their noisy dog; I've seen it in their campsâthey call it sweet, Though black and bitter and unsavoury meat. YOUNG RABBITS The idle boys the Sunday never heed And go to places where the rabbits breed; Where'er the moulds are fresh they try and stay And clap the dog to scrat the moulds away; He scrats and looks and barks and snuffs to find The sleepy young ones lapt in down and blind. They put them in again and look for more And lap them up as quiet as before. When any comes they skulk behind the tree. The gipsy joins them in his rags and glee And digs the holes out with a rotten stake And thrusts his hand and never cares for snake. The dog, that follows all that passes by, He ties him to his hand and makes him lie. BIRDS IN ALARM The firetail tells the boys when nests are nigh And tweets and flies from every passer-by. The yellow-hammer never makes a noise But flies in silence from the noisy boys; The boys will come and take them every day, And still she lays as none were ta'en away. The nightingale keeps tweeting-churring round But leaves in silence when the nest is found. The pewit hollos âchewritâ as she flies And flops about the shepherd where he lies; But when her nest is found she stops her song And cocks [her] coppled crown and runs along. Wrens cock their tails and chitter loud and play, And robins hollo âtutâ and fly away. DYKE SIDE The frog croaks loud, and maidens dare not pass But fear the noisome toad and shun the grass; And on the sunny banks they dare not go Where hissing snakes run to the flood below. The nuthatch noises loud in wood and wild, Like women turning skreeking to a child. The schoolboy hears and brushes through the trees And runs about till drabbled to the knees. The old hawk winnows round the old crow's nest; The schoolboy hears and wonder fills his breast. He throws his basket down to climb the tree And wonders what the red-blotched eggs can be: The green woodpecker bounces from the view And hollos, as he buzzes by, âkew kew.â QUAIL'S NEST I wandered out one rainy day And heard a bird with merry joys Cry âwet my footâ for half the way; I stood and wondered at the noise, When from my foot a bird did fleeâ The rain flew bouncing from her breastâ I wondered what the bird could be, And almost trampled on her nest. The nest was full of eggs and round; I met a shepherd in the vales, And stood to tell him what I found. He knew and said it was a quail's, For he himself the nest had found, Among the wheat and on the green, When going on his daily round, With eggs as many as fifteen. Among the stranger birds they feed, Their summer flight is short and low; There's very few know where they breed, And scarcely any where they go. AUTUMN BIRDS The wild duck startles like a sudden thought, And heron slow as if it might be caught; The flopping crows on weary wing go by, And greybeard jackdaws, noising as they fly; The crowds of starnels whizz and hurry by And darken like a cloud the evening sky; The larks like thunder rise and suther round, Then drop and nestle in the stubble ground; The wild swan hurries high and noises loud, With white necks peering to the evening cloud. The weary rooks to distant woods are gone; With length of tail the magpie winnows on To neighbouring tree, and leaves the distant crow, While small birds nestle in the hedge below. BLACKBIRD'S NEST The cloudy morning brought a pleasant day, And soon the busy mist was all away, When first I wandered out and chanced to see A woodbine twining round a stoven tree, That ventured up and formed a bush at top And bended leaning till it met a prop, And overhung with leaves so thick a shade You couldn't see the nest the blackbird made, Who fluttered o'er my head as if from boys; And soon her partner answered to the noise. The path went closely by, but seldom prest By passer-by, who never saw the nest; The old birds sat and sung in safety sure, And the young brood, pin-feathered, lay secure. THE PARTRIDGE One day across the fields I chanced to pass. Where chickens chelped and scuttled in the grass; And as I looked about to find the seat, A wounded partridge dropped agen my feet. She fluttered round and calling as she lay; The chickens chelped and fluttered all away. I stooped to pick her up, when up she drew Her wounded wing and cackled as she flew. I wondered much to hear the chickens lie As still as nothing as I wandered by; And soon she came agen with much ado And swept the grass and called them as she flew; But still they kept their seat and left no trace And old cows snorted when they passed the place. CROWS IN SPRING The crow will tumble up and down At the first sight of spring And in old trees around the town Brush winter from its wing. No longer flapping far away To naked fen they fly, Chill fare as on a winter's day, But field and valley nigh; Where swains are stirring out to plough And woods are just at hand, They seek the upland's sunny brow And strut from land to land, And often flap their sooty wing And sturt to neighbouring tree, And seem to try all ways to sing And almost speak in glee. The ploughman hears and turns his head Above to wonder why; And there a new nest nearly made Proclaims the winter by. THE NUTHATCH In summer showers a skreeking noise is heard, Deep in the woods, of some uncommon bird; It makes a loud and long-continued noise And often stops the speed of men and boys. They think somebody mocks and goes along, And never think the nuthatch makes the song, Who always comes along, the summer's guest; But bird-nest hunters never found the nest. The schoolboy hears the noise from day to day, And stoops among the thorns to find a way, And starts the jay-bird from the bushes green; He looks, and sees a nest he's never seen, And bears the spotted eggs with many joys, And thinks he's found the bird that made the noise. THE GROUNDLARK Close where the milking maidens pass, In roots and twitches drest Within a little bunch of grass A groundlark made her nest. The maiden touched her with her gown And often frit her out, And looked and set her bucket down But never found it out. The eggs were large and spotted round And dark as is the fallow ground; The schoolboy kicked the grass in play But danger never guessed; And when they came to mow the hay They found an empty nest. WILD DUCK'S NEST As boys were playing in their school's dislike And floating paper boats along the dyke, They laid their baskets down a nest to see And found a small hole in a hollow tree; When one looked in, and wonder filled his breast, And hallooed out, âA wild duck on her nest.â They doubted, and the boldest went before, And the duck bolted when they waded o'er And suthered up and flew against the wind And left the boys and wondering thoughts behind. The eggs lay hid in down and lightly prest, They counted more than thirty in the nest. They filled their hats with eggs and waded o'er And left the nest as quiet as before. THE BEAUTIFUL STRANGER I cannot know what country owns thee now, With France's fairest lilies on thy brow. When England knew thee thou wert passing fair: I never knew a foreign face so rare. The world of waters rolls and rushes by, Nor lets me wander where thy valleys lie. But surely France must be a pleasant place That greets the stranger with so fair a face; The English maiden blushes down the dance, But few can equal the fair maid of France. I saw thee lovely and I wished thee mine, And the last song I ever wrote is thine. Thy country's honour on thy face attends; Men may be foes, but beauty makes us friends. THE TRAMP He eats (a moment's stoppage to his song) The stolen turnip as he goes along; And hops along and heeds with careless eye The passing crowded stage-coach reeling by. He talks to none, but wends his silent way, And finds a hovel at the close of day, Or under any hedge his house is made. He has no calling and he owns no trade. An old smoked blanket arches o'er his head, A wisp of straw or stubble makes his bed. He knows a lawless law that claims no kin But meet and plunder on and feel no sinâ No matter where they go or where they dwell, They dally with the winds and laugh at hell. FARMER'S BOY He waits all day beside his little flock And asks the passing stranger what's o'clock, But those who often pass his daily tasks Look at their watch and tell before he asks. He mutters stories to himself and lies Where the thick hedge the warmest house supplies, And when he hears the hunters far and wide He climbs the highest tree to see them rideâ He climbs till all the fields are blea and bare And makes the old crow's nest an easy-chair. And soon his sheep are got in other groundsâ He hastens down and fears his master come, He stops the gap and keeps them all in bounds And tends them closely till it's time for home. BRAGGART With careful step to keep his balance up He reels on warily along the street, Slabbering at mouth and with a staggering stoop Mutters an angry look at all he meets. Bumptious and vain and proud, he shoulders up, And would be something if he knew but how; To any man on earth he will not stoop But cracks of work, of horses, and of plough. Proud of the foolish talk, the ale he quaffs, He never heeds the insult loud that laughs: With rosy maid he tries to joke and playâ Who shrugs and nettles deep his pomp and pride, And calls him drunken beast and runs awayâ King to himself and fool to all beside. MERRY MAID Bonny and stout and brown, without a hat, She frowns offended when they call her fatâ Yet fat she is, the merriest in the place, And all can know she wears a pretty face. But still she never heeds what praise can say, But does the work, and oft runs out to play. To run about the yard and ramp and noise And spring the mop upon the servant-boys. When old hens noise and cackle everywhere She hurries eager if the eggs are dear, And runs to seek them when they lay away To get them ready for the market day. She gambols with the men and laughs aloud, And only quarrels when they call her proud. SCANDAL She hastens out and scarcely pins her clothes To hear the news and tell the news she knows; She talks of sluts, marks each unmended gown, Herself the dirtiest slut in all the town. She stands with eager haste at slander's tale, And drinks the news as drunkards drink their ale. Excuse is ready at the biggest lieâ She only heard it and it passes by. The very cat looks up and knows her face And hastens to the chair to get the place; When once set down she never goes away, Till tales are done and talk has naught to say. She goes from house to house the village o'er, Her slander bothers everybody's door. MARKET DAY With arms and legs at work and gentle stroke That urges switching tail nor mends his pace, On an old ribbed and weather-beaten horse, The farmer goes jogtrotting to the fair, Both keep their pace that nothing can provoke, Followed by brindled dog that snuffs the ground With urging bark and hurries at his heels. His hat slouched down, and greatcoat buttoned close Bellied like hoopÃ¨d keg, and chuffy face Red as the morning sun, he takes his round And talks of stock: and when his jobs are done And Dobbin's hay is eaten from the rack, He drinks success to corn in language hoarse, And claps old Dobbin's hide, and potters back. âTHE LASS WITH THE DELICATE AIRâ Timid and smiling, beautiful and shy, She drops her head at every passer-by. Afraid of praise, she hurries down the streets And turns away from every smile she meets. The forward clown has many things to say And holds her by the gown to make her stay. The picture of good health she goes along, Hale as the morn and happy as her song. Yet there is one who never feels a fear To whisper pleasing fancies in her ear; Yet e'en from him she shuns a rude embrace, And stooping holds her hands before her faceâ She even shuns and fears the bolder wind, And holds her shawl, and often looks behind. THE LOUT (I) No sort of learning ever hurts his head; He buys a song and never hears it read; He gets the tune and never heeds the words; His pocket, too, a penny oft affords To buy a book, no matter what about, And there he keeps it till he wears it out. In every job he's sure to have a share, And shouts to haste his speed he cannot bear. He seldom seeks the house in leisure hour, But finds the haystack in a sudden shower, And hid from all he there contrives to lie, Rain how it will, to keep his garments dry. He owns one suit and wears it all the week, A dirty slop as dingy as his cheek. THE LOUT (II) For Sunday's play he never makes excuse, But plays at taw, and buys his Spanish juice. Hard as his toil, and ever slow to speak, Yet he gives maidens many a burning cheek; For none can pass him but his witless grace Of bawdry brings the blushes in her face. As vulgar as the dirt he treads upon, He calls his cows or drives his horses on; He knows the tamest cow and strokes her side And often tries to mount her back and ride, And takes her tail at night in idle play, And makes her drag him homeward all the way. He knows of nothing but the football match, And where hens lay, and when the duck will hatch. THE LOUT (III) He plays with other boys when work is done, But feels too clumsy and too stiff to run, Yet where there's mischief he can find a way The first to join and last [to run] away. What's said or done he never heeds or minds But gets his pence for all the eggs he finds. He thinks his master's horses far the best, And always labours longer than the rest. In frost and cold though lame he's forced to goâ The call's more urgent when he journeys slow. In surly speed he helps the maids by force And feeds the cows and hallos till he's hoarse; And when he's lame they only jest and play And bid him throw his kiby heels away. GIPSIES The gipsies seek wide sheltering woods again, With droves of horses flock to mark their lane, And trample on dead leaves, and hear the sound, And look and see the black clouds gather round, And set their camps, and free from muck and mire, And gather stolen sticks to make the fire. The roasted hedgehog, bitter though as gall, Is eaten up and relished by them all. They know the woods and every fox's den And get their living far away from men; The shooters ask them where to find the game, The rabbits know them and are almost tame. The aged women, tawny with the smoke, Go with the winds and crack the rotted oak. THE CLOWN With hands in pocket hid and buttoned up, The clown goes jogging merrily along; The wind blows in his face and makes him stoop, And rain beats hard and stops his merry song; His shaggy coat is buttoned with a loop, With whip held up for stroke robust and strong, And hat half stuffed with straw to keep it up; He gruffly hollos âwhopâ and lobs along; He never turns, but with a careless switch Whoos up his team that answers with a jerk; When friends are met he gives his coat a hitch And cocks his beaver up and talks of work; To lose no time he trails his whip along And bends it 'neath his arm to tie the thong. THE THRESHER With hand in waistcoat thrust, the thresher goes Early at morn to follow his employ; He nothing wants to know and nothing knows, And wearies life along with little joy; He lives without the world among the poor, And nothing sees but stock agen the door, And hears the felfare droves before the storm Stripping the hawthorn hedges round the farm. The shepherd seeks his door, but cannot stay, And tells his only newsâthe time of day; The milk[maid] stops awhile her hands to blow And shake her cloak and bonnet from the snow; Hard labour is the all his life enjoyed, His idlest leisure is to be employed. THE STUDENT He always tells a story plain and plump, And talks so loud he almost makes you jump; He asks a question and his learning shows, And takes his pocket-book to show he knows; The village all his learning will allow, And every boy he passes makes his bow; To such a man all will their manners show And if he is not proud he might be so; He meets with many but has naught to say And never talks with any by the way; Some say that study makes the man so pale, He shuns the toper and refuses ale, And takes a quiet journey every day And seems to gather knowledge by the way. THE MOLE-CATCHER Tattered and ragg'd, with greatcoat tied in strings, And collared up to keep his chin from cold, The old mole-catcher on his journey sings, Followed by shaggy dog infirm and old, Who potters on and keeps his steady pace; He is so lame he scarce can get abroad But hopples on and growls at anything; Yet silly sheep will scarcely leave the road. With stick and spud he tried the new-made hills And bears his cheating traps from place to place; Full many are the miners that he kills. His trotting dog oft looks him in the face; And when his toils are done he tries to play And finds a quicker pace and barks him on his way. THE FOWLER With boots of monstrous leg and massy strength, The fowler journeys on his weary way; With furry cap and gun of monstrous length, He hunts the reedy forest for his prey. The timid wild duck vainly hurries by, And when the wild-goose droves their place proclaim He stands behind his horse and gathers nigh, Who scorn to fear and fly from beast so lame. They plop and hurry from the noises loud; The wounded whirl and whirl and fall agen; They make vast slaughter in the varied crowds That haunt the watery fen; The others rise and hurry to the clouds And fly far distant from the haunts of men. THE PACKMEN Close by the road the traveller set his cart And clogged his horse's feet in journey slow, The ploughman's horses made a sudden start And snorted loud to see the fire below; And there they sat and hid them from the shower, From many a weary mile through thick and thin, And ate their meals and rested many an hour And found a pleasant bed at night within; And in the morning by the break of day Left the broke hedge and drove their house away. And panniered asses with an hungry eye Snatched the tall thistle as they wandered by. They travel over England far and wide And rarely in the balanced panniers ride. THE RETURNED SOLDIER The soldier, full of battles and renown, The gaping wonder of each quiet lown, And strange to every face he knew so well, Comes once again in this old town to dwell. But man alone is changed; the very tree He sees again where once he used to swee; And the old fields where once he tented sheep, And the old mole-hills where he used to leap, And the old bush where once he found a nest Are just the same, and pleasure fills his breast. He sees the old path where he used to play At chock and marbles many a summer day, And loves to wander where he went a boy, And fills his heart with pleasure and with joy. THE OUTCAST He goes about the fields from day to day And gathers wool to bother want away; But want as usual follows at his heels, He cannot labour and he never steals. But meddlers haunt and watch him by the way And hope to catch him with some stolen prey; While pilfered hedges broke and open lie They never see him bear the faggot by. He often passes by but never takes The rotten hedges that another breaks, While the rude ruffian stands upon a lie And throws his scorn at every passer-by. The weak and harmless often bear the blame But look in slander's face and feel no shame. He lives among the persecuted poor, And laughter jeers and passes by his door. He rarely meets a face without a frown, The poorest mortal laughs and runs him down; He never makes reply but holds his tongue And only mutters as he goes along. Yet when he wanders where the stranger strays, He often meets with kindness by the way, And labour often holds his bottle up And bids him drink and take a hearty sup; And wearing on for many a weary hour, He dithers, oft o'ertaken in the shower. The hedger looks and throws the noggin by And bids him take it home his clothes to dry. THE SLY MAID The ballad in the ploughman's pocket wears A greater fame than poets ever knew; The maiden claims his present from the fairs And gets it all by heart as lover's due. Timid and shy and full of maiden fears, She blushes deep at every praise she hears; Yet when she meets a sweetheart in the way, She's filled with thoughts and flurried all the day. She cannot do her work nor make her paste, But puts the miller's eye out in her haste. The roads are clean as pennies all the way And show the shoe-nails where the water lay; So without pattens forth the maiden goes To show her last new gown and Sunday clothes. THE GIDDY MAID She runs away and gathers up her gown And does her jobs and gallops down the town; She runs about so giddy all the day She loses half her errands by the way, And Goody tells her, when from work she steals, Her random head will never save her heels. Yet beauty's ever with her in the race, And health and laughter ever in her face. The stranger oft another book bestows And thinks her prettier than the maids he knows. Her cheeks so full of health are never white, Save once upon the harvest-supper night When she to fright the lad who loved her most Burnt brandy on a plate to act the ghost. THE SCHOOLBOY With slate and bag at back and full of books, The merry schoolboy saunters on and looks Fresh as the morn that meets him in the face; And often stops to play in many a place, To bawl at taw and hallo âknuckle downâ And hunt birds' nestes when he leaves the town. He hates the cuckoos singing all the day That suck birds' eggs and cheat him all the way, And often sets his basket down and runs To pelt the birds that nestle in the sun, And often keeps from school with vain excuse And then gets pence to buy him Spanish juice; And when his sum is hard he lounges on And pines for freedom till the day is gone. SUNDAY DIP The morning road is thronged with merry boys Who seek the water for their Sunday joys; They run to seek the shallow pit, and wade And dance about the water in the shade. The boldest ventures first and dashes in, And others go and follow to the chin, And duck about, and try to lose their fears, And laugh to hear the thunder in their ears. They bundle up the rushes for a boat And try across the deepest place to float: Beneath the willow trees they ride and stoopâ The awkward load will scarcely bear them up. Without their aid the others float away, And play about the water half the day. STONE-PIT The passing traveller with wonder sees A deep and ancient stone-pit full of trees; So deep and very deep the place has been, The church might stand within and not be seen. The passing stranger oft with wonder stops And thinks he e'en could walk upon their tops, And often stoops to see the busy crow, And stands above and sees the eggs below; And while the wild horse gives its head a toss, The squirrel dances up and runs across. The boy that stands and kills the black-nosed bee Dares down as soon as magpies' nest are found, And wonders when he climbs the highest tree To find it reaches scarce above the ground. FARM BREAKFAST Maids shout to breakfast in a merry strife, And the cat runs to hear the whetted knife, And dogs are ever in the way to watch The mouldy crust and falling bone to catch. The wooden dishes round in haste are set, And round the table all the boys are met; All know their own save Hodge who would be first, But every one his master leaves the worst. On every wooden dish, a humble claim, Two rude-cut letters mark the owner's name; From every nook the smile of plenty calls, And reasty flitches decorate the walls, Moore's Almanack where wonders never ceaseâ All smeared with candle-snuff and bacon-grease. WINTER 'Tis winter weather; up and down The schoolboy slurs again, The deepest pond in all the town Would bear a loaded wain. The little birds half-pined agen, Though dogs may blink and growl, Will come where Goody feeds the hen Half-tame as are the fowl. And signs of harder weather still Are noticed every day, The wild-geese droves in noises shrill Go floating far away; And cawdy-mawdies flit agen, In colour like the snow, They swop away from dreary fen And heed not where they go. On, on they go, and seldom stop, A warmer spot to find, And up the meadow floods they swop Like snowballs in the wind. 'Tis winter here and everywhere; In vain the robins sing, The eve comes in still more severe And nothing tokens spring. Cats curl their tails and watch no more The stackyard's squeaking mouse, But waiting for the open door They hurry in the house. The ickles on the eaves and that To sticks of silver run, And break upon the ploughman's hat When melted by the sun. They shorten till the day is done And lengthen every morn, When drops like diamonds in the sun Hang knobs on every thorn. Yet comfort still the heart surrounds, No matter how severe The weather is, when home abounds With comfort all the year. Where pleasant easy hearts can find, And pleasant books together, A shelter from the cold and wind, A fig for dreary weather! WOODCROFT CASTLE (I) Woodcroft, thy castle many a story yieldsâ How drunken rebels, scorning flood and fen, Turned up their horses in thy blooming fields And killed bold Hutchinson and all his men; They show the dangerous height from which he fellâ The narrow moat the naked wall surrounds; The staring towers in naked quiet dwell, And sheep and oxen fill the lonely grounds. The sailing puddock makes a lonesome cry, And strangers tell the tale while passing by: How rebels entered, and the master fell, And morts of riches buried in the well! The labourer wonders where the riches lay, Digs on, and thinks of money all the day. WOODCROFT CASTLE (II) Absorbing time, that all things overwhelms, Will round the castle ancient thoughts recall; The fragment of a moat, the triple elms, The cannon holes that pierce the mossy wall, The ancient arching gateway striding high, Where Cromwell's stubborn army entered through, The castle barn the stranger passes by, And the old house which many a pencil drew. Some dim-seen paintings triumph on the walls, And travellers still the antique rooms admire, Where my lord's parlour still the past recalls; Where Cromwell doubtless would from strife retire, The locked-up room where superstition sleeps And Cromwell's memory in dread mystery creeps. THE STONE The traveller journeying on the road alone Sees by the highway side an ancient stone And finds it pleasant in the weary day To sit him down and wear an hour away. The strongest hand of mischief needed more, And failed to move, or break, or turn it o'er. The man of ninety knew it when a boy, The only thing that nothing could destroy, And just the same as then it now appears, The fragment maybe of some hundred years. Beside the stone the wild flower gathers high, No grazing horse can bite or trample nigh, And smaller birds contented and alone Can sit and shelter by the ancient stone. A HILL-SIDE HOUSE There is a house stands in a lonely way, The hill seems falling on it all the day; It seems half-hidden, like a robber's den, And seems more safe for robbers than for men. The trees look bushes scarcely half as big, Seem taking root and growing on the rig. The cows that travel up with little heed Seem looking down upon the roof to feed, And if they take a step or stumble more They seem in danger then of tumbling o'er. The cocks and hens that fill a little space Are all that look like home about the place. The woods seem ready on the house to drop, And rabbits breed above the chimney-top. NOVEMBER The shepherds almost wonder where they dwell, And the old dog for his right journey stares: The path leads somewhere, but they cannot tell, And neighbour meets with neighbour unawares. The maiden passes close beside her cow, And wanders on, and thinks her far away; The ploughman goes unseen behind his plough And seems to lose his horses half the day. The lazy mist creeps on in journey slow; The maidens shout and wonder where they go; So dull and dark are the November days. The lazy mist high up the evening curled, And now the morn quite hides in smoke and haze; The place we occupy seems all the world. SPRING The cow-boy hears the spring and sees the crows, And cocks his hat, and whistles as he goes; The maidens hurry to the hedge and play To catch the clothes the shower has blown away. The horse leaps up, the cow's no longer dull, The maids bring home the buckets brimming full, The old cow tosses up the gate away And seeks the pasture where the summer lay. The ploughman often stops and wipes his brow, And sits and eats his luncheon on the plough. The traveller birds in all directions fly, And winds no longer moan a desert sky; The ploughman, blundering on robust and strong, Makes faces at the wind and lobs along. WILD BEES' NEST The mower tramples on the wild bees' nest, And hears the busy noise, and stops the rest; Who careless proggle out the mossy ball And gather up the honey, comb and all. The boy that seeks dewberries from the sedge, And lays the poison berries on the hedge, Will often find them in the meadow hay, And take his bough and drive the bees away. But when the maiden goes to turn the hay She whips her apron up and runs away; The schoolboy eats the honey, comb and all, And often knocks his hat agen the wall, And progs the stick in every hole he sees To steal the honey-bag of black-nosed bees. THE FEN The dreary fen a waste of water goes, With nothing to be seen but Royston crows; The traveller journeying on the road for hours Sees nothing but the dykes and water-flowers. The lonely lodges scattered miles away Lock up from fear and robbers all the day; The merry maiden that no place dislikes Runs out and fills her kettle from the dykes. She hurries wildly from the face of men And knows no company but cock and hen. Here highland maiden sees in Sunday's hour The glorious sight of sainfoin grounds in flower, And meets the savoury smells that wake the morn, The woodbine hedges and the poppied corn. GOING TO THE FAIR A stranger meets a many folks and knows A fair is somewhere by their Sunday clothes; The maiden goes with morning in her face, Healthy and happy at the wind's embrace. She hastens by the clown, who bids her stay, And begs to take her basket all the way. Though she refuses she oft looks behind As if to token she was half inclined. She has a look and smile for every one, And many a heart aches deeply when she's gone. Her face is beautiful, and every hind Feels loath to pass her without speaking kind. Another in such hurry to the fair Forgets her money till she's half-way there. AUTUMN MORNING The mist lies on the weeds, but clears away, And half the fields lie open to the day. The ditcher hollos out, and cleans his spade, To see the dogs go where his dinner's laid. They snuff about, and stare, and hurry by The silly sheep, that need not start and fly. They snuff the morning gale and hurry on, And only follow where the game is gone; And bite the weeds in wantonness and play, And leap along the stubbles all the day; Then sit on end with pointed foot, and eye The partridge brood that round the bushes fly; And soon the shooters' thunder loudly calls, And half the covey in the stubble falls. AUTUMN EVENING I love to hear the evening crows go by And see the starnels darken down the sky; The bleaching stack the bustling sparrow leaves, And plops with merry note beneath the eaves. The odd and lated pigeon bounces by, As if a wary watching hawk was nigh, While far and fearing nothing, high and slow, The stranger birds to distant places go; While short of flight the evening robin comes To watch the maiden sweeping out the crumbs, Nor fears the idle shout of passing boy, But pecks about the door, and sings for joy; Then in the hovel where the cows are fed Finds till the morning comes a pleasant bed. FARM SCENE (I) The noisy blathering calves are fed, and all The cows are fothered up and in their stall; Weary with toils and plodding through the mire, The ploughmen all are round the kitchen fire; One pats the shaggy dog between his legs, Another throws a crust to one that begs; One sings a song and strokes in highest glee The tabby cat that sits upon his knee; One cracks about his horses and his plough, One kisses Dolly 'cause he milked her cow; Another has a smutty word to say And makes the maiden blush and turn away; Till every song is sung and tale is said, Then maids lap up the fire and all to bed. FARM SCENE (II) The cow-boy shuns the shower and seeks the mat To clean his shoes, and swings his napless hat And drags his faggot in, a glad supply, While laughing maidens help his clothes to dry. The butter is made up, the bever set, And all the ploughmen in the kitchen met; One runs about the new-laid eggs to find, One gets the garden beans with flannel lined And pelts the laughing maidens with the shells; And in the brier bush where the robin dwells The tender maiden runs and carries crumbs; Close to the door the fighting sparrow comes; A maiden runs and shakes the damsons down And hides them in her apron for the clown; One takes a handful first and runs away, And so they keep half work, half holiday. MERRILY TO TOIL Lapt up in sacks to shun the rain and wind, And shoes thick-clouted with the sticking soil, And sideling on his horse, the careless hind Rides litherly and singing to his toil. The boy rides foremost where the sack is gone And holds it with his hands to keep it on; Then splashing down the road in journey slow Through mire and sludge with cracking whips they go. He lays his jacket with his luncheon by And drinks from horses' footings when adry; They pass the maiden singing at her cow And start the lark that roosted by the plough, That sings above them all the livelong day And on they drive and hollo care away. COW-BOY'S HUT The cow-boy's hut of straw neglected lies, Where the old tattered sheepskin hangs and dries, Two trays on end, half down, with stubble lined, And snugly thacked atop to block the wind, And all below with stubble thickly spread That served for chair, for table, and for bed, Where he, when cows were still, would lie at ease And eat his barley crust and shell his peas; And when the rain forbid his steps to roam Would lie and sleep till time to ramble home; The ballad from his pocket lost forlorn Lies bleaching to the weather, wet and torn, Till the rude bird-boy in the fields alone Repairs the hulk and claims the goods his own. THE FARMYARD Confusion's plenty lies in every way, And hogs and calves are noising all the day; The maiden serves them all with merry looks And often leaves the pattens in the mucks; Though Hodge is sent to keep the causeys clean, His idle toil scarce shows her where he's been; With surly speed he sings an idle song, And like a walking may-tree lobs along. The rattling bucket calls the hogs away; Calves toze the maidens' garments in their play; The hogs lie rooting underneath the straw, And ducks go waddling with a loaded craw; The ploughman loads the straw with chubby face, And carts and wagons stand in every place. THE POOL Where the clear water rises to the brink, Battered by cattle coming there to drink, Boys bring the mower's bottle to the fore And hold and fill it till it bubbles o'er; And eager ploughmen with a ruddy face Throw in a stone to reach the clearest place, And take a hearty soak and haste away, And cow-boys seek it twenty times a day; And when the idle boy has had his fill He sucks the bubbles with an oaten quill; While ever shy the timid maiden stands And stooping sips the water from her hands; Content to be adry she goes agen, Because she will not kneel before the men. DELUGE The maiden ran away to fetch the clothes And threw her apron o'er her cap and bows; But the shower catched her ere she hurried in And beat and almost dowsed her to the skin. The ruts ran brooks as they would ne'er be dry, And the boy waded as he hurried by; The half-drowned ploughman waded to the knees, And birds were almost drowned upon the trees. The streets ran rivers till they floated o'er, And women screamed to meet it at the door. Labour fled home and rivers hurried by, And still it fell as it would never stop; E'en the old stone-pit, deep as house is high, Was brimming o'er and floated o'er the top. HEN'S NEST Among the orchard weeds, from every search, Snugly and sure, the old hen's nest is made, Who cackles every morning from her perch To tell the servant girl new eggs are laid; Who lays her washing by, and far and near Goes seeking all about from day to day, And stung with nettles tramples everywhere; But still the cackling pullet lays away. The boy on Sundays goes the stack to pull In hopes to find her there, but naught is seen, And takes his hat and thinks to find it full, She's laid so long so many might have been. But naught is found and all is given o'er Till the young brood come chirping to the door. WINTER WEATHER The crows drive onward through the storm of snow And play about, naught caring where they go. The young colt breaks the fences in his play And spreads his tail and gallops all the way. The hunkÃ¨d ploughman goes without a song And knocks his hands and scarce can get along. Behind the thickest hedge the labourer stands And puts his gloves away to knock his hands. The traveller's stooping haste to get away Keeps both hands in his pockets all the day. The schoolboy often stops his hands to blow And loves to make rude letters on the snow. While tottering shepherd, though infirm and old, Faces the cutting wind and feels no cold. MORRIS DANCERS Deckt out in ribbons gay and papers cut Fine as a maiden's fancies, off they strut And act the morris dance from door to door; Their highest gain's a penny, nothing more. The children leave their toys to see them play, And laughing maidens lay their work away. The stolen apple in her apron lies To give her lover in his gay disguise. E'en the old woman leaves her knitting off And lays the bellows in her lap to laugh. Upon the floor the stool-made wagons lie, And playing scholars lay the lesson by. The cat and dog in wonder run away And hide beneath the table from the play. FARM TASKS All are employed: one's gone to seek the tup, And one is gone to fetch the horses up; One hastens off to seek the cackling hen, And one to let the sheep out from the pen; One runs and feeds the hens with barley bigg, Another goes and mends the wooden brig That maids may safely pass the meadow brook, So deep that fear dare scarcely stop to look. One with old Dobbin to the mill is gone And rides upon the sack to keep it on; One reaches down the gears to go to plough, Another cuts the stack to feed the cow. The hogs are fed and noising round for more, And dogs are sent to drive them from the door. TIT FOR TAT The old hens cackle and begin the day, And maidens run and drive the dogs away. The laughing maiden hurries in the house And twirls the mop the passing clown to souse, Who runs in turn and kicks the bucket down And splashes muddy water on her gown. Another maid with laughter in her eye Splashes him from the wash-tub passing by: She laughs at threats and pays him no regard; Her face protects her from an angry word; But holds her apron up to stop the blow When angry Hodge the turnip dares to throw. The other only claims a kiss for pay; She knows the claim and seldom runs away. BLACKBERRYING He fills his pockets, and his hat provides A plenteous space for what he gets besides; He climbs the hedge, and where the dyke is wide He sticks his fork and leaps on t'other side. The schoolboy often stands for half the day And tries to make excuses for his stay, And tempted stands the loaded bush to pull, And often tries to get his basket full, And eager marks of his intrusion bears, And tears his coat and hands and never cares. The maiden often pulls the berries off And stains her face and wonders why they laugh. The children, muffled from the cold for play, Go round and pick the hedges all the day. THE FORD The ploughman stops his wagon at the fore And sees the brook a river running o'er; He tries the depth and progs his whip about; The timid maiden sees the waters out And asks the ploughman's aid to ride across; The boy rides fearless on the foremost horse; The maiden trembles while she keeps her seat And screams to see the water at her feet; Fear brings the deepest blushes on her face, The wagon-boat swims in the deepest place, The boy holds fast to see the floating tray And thinks the horses will be swam away; But soon they gain the side, a merry throng, And lose their fears and talk and drive along. MOUSE'S NEST I found a ball of grass among the hay And progged it as I passed and went away; And when I looked I fancied something stirred, And turned agen and hoped to catch the birdâ When out an old mouse bolted in the wheats With all her young ones hanging at her teats; She looked so odd and so grotesque to me, I ran and wondered what the thing could be, And pushed the knapweed bunches where I stood; Then the mouse hurried from the craking brood. The young ones squeaked, and as I went away She found her nest again among the hay. The water o'er the pebbles scarce could run And broad old cesspools glittered in the sun. SHEEP IN WINTER The sheep get up and make their many tracks And bear a load of snow upon their backs, And gnaw the frozen turnip to the ground With sharp quick bite, and then go noising round The boy that pecks the turnips all the day And knocks his hands to keep the cold away And laps his legs in straw to keep them warm And hides behind the hedges from the storm. The sheep, as tame as dogs, go where he goes And try to shake their fleeces from the snows, Then leave their frozen meal and wander round The stubble stack that stands beside the ground, And lie all night and face the drizzling storm And shun the hovel where they might be warm. HIGH SUMMER The ground is hard, and o'er the fallows now The boys are forced to lean upon the plough; The ground is full of cracks and gapes for wet, And cobwebs hang on all the bushes met. The snakes lie beaking where the waters play And make the maiden almost faint away. The idle boy sits on the brigs at play And keeps a bough to knock the flies away; And ever followed by a lazy dog, He wades the flaggy dyke and pelts the frog And gets the great brier balls and likes them well And crops the coddled apples for the smell And fills his hands among the poppied corn With pleasant weeds that scent the gales of morn. BREAK OF DAY The lark he rises early, And the ploughman goes away Before it's morning fairly At the guessing break of day; The fields lie in the dawning, And the valley's hid in gold, At the pleasant time of morning When the shepherd goes to fold. The maiden laughs and hollos When she sees the feeding cows; They switch their tails and follow When she can't get over sloughs; I love the gentle dawning, And the valleys hid in gold, At the pleasant time of morning When the shepherd goes to fold. MARRIED TO A SOLDIER The pride of all the village, The fairest to be seen, The pride of all the village That might have been a queen, Has bid good-bye to neighbours And left the dance and play And married to a soldier And wandered far away. The cottage is neglected, Where young men used to go And talk about her beauty And see her come and go; The bench agen her cottage Where she used to work at eve Is vanished with the woodbine; And all are taken leave. Her cottage is neglected, Her garden gathers green, The summer comes unnoticed, Her flowers are never seen; There's none to tie a blossom up Or clean a weed away; She's married to a soldier And wandered far away. The neighbours wonder at her, And surely well they may, To think one so could flatter Her heart to go away. But the cocked hat and feather Appeared so very gay, She bundled clothes together And married far away. TRESPASS I dreaded walking where there was no path And prest with cautious tread the meadow swath, And always turned to look with wary eye, And always feared the farmer coming by; Yet everything about where I had gone Appeared so beautiful, I ventured on; And when I gained the road where all are free I fancied every stranger frowned at me, And every kinder look appeared to say, âYou've been on trespass in your walk to-day.â I've often thought, the day appeared so fine, How beautiful if such a place were mine; But having naught I never feel alone And cannot use another's as my own. THE SHY LOVER I often longed, when wandering up and down, To hear the rustle of thy Sunday gown; And when we met, I passed, and let thee go, And felt I loved, but dare not tell thee so: Snares are so thickly spread on woman's way, The common ballad teaches, men betray. I thought and felt it rudeness if I tried, And well-meant kindness might be misapplied. I longed to walk with thee, where waters play And lined with water-cresses all the way; And read the poets as I went along And thought they knew thy name in every song. The mind on thee and beauty's music dwells, And listens to the sound of Glinton bells. THE POET'S SONG The maid has beauty at her will Too often flung away, And broken down and lovely still Oh, who would betray? The wealthy have their wealth and power And almost all the world to spend; They seldom know a weary hour, And favour never wants a friend. The many have a home retreat To while away a weary hour; The poorest have a corner seat And only covet wealth and power. Despised and hated all along, The bard has nothing but a song. THE POET'S DEATH The world is taking little heed And plods from day to day: The vulgar flourish like a weed, The learned pass away. We miss him on the summer path The lonely summer day, Where mowers cut the pleasant swath And maidens make the hay. The vulgar take but little heed; The garden wants his care; There lies the book he used to read, There stands the empty chair. The boat laid up, the voyage o'er, And passed the stormy wave, The world is going as before, The poet in his grave. LOVE AND SOLITUDE I hate the very noise of troublous man Who did and does me all the harm he can. Free from the world I would a prisoner be And my own shadow all my company; And lonely see the shooting stars appear, Worlds rushing into judgment all the year. Oh, lead me onward to the loneliest shade, The dearest place that quiet ever made, Where kingcups grow most beauteous to behold And shut up green and open into gold. Farewell to poesyâand leave the will; Take all the world awayâand leave me still The mirth and music of a woman's voice, That bids the heart be happy and rejoice. SIGHING FOR RETIREMENT Oh, take me from the busy crowd, I cannot bear the noise! For Nature's voice is never loud; I seek for quiet joys. The book I love is everywhere, And not in idle words; The book I love is known to all, And better love affords. The book I love is everywhere, And every place the same; God bade me make my dwelling there, And look for better fame. I never feared the critic's pen, To live by my renown; I found the poems in the fields, And only wrote them down. And quiet Epping pleases well, Where Nature's love delays; I joy to see the quiet place, And wait for better days. FIRST LOVE No single hour can pass for naught, No moment-hand can move, But calendars an aching thought Of my first lonely love. Where silence doth the loudest call My secret to betray, As moonlight holds the night in thrall, As suns reveal the day, I hide it in the silent shades, Till silence finds a tongue; I make its grave where time invades, Till time becomes a song. I bid my foolish heart be still, But hopes will not be chid: My heart will beat, and burn, and chill, First love will not be hid. When summer ceases to be green, And winter bare and blea, Death may forget what I have been When I shall cease to be. When words refuse before the crowd My Mary's name to give, The muse in silence sings aloud: And there my love will live. WHAT IS LOVE? Say, what is love? To live in vain, To live, and die, and live again? Say, what is love? Is it to be In prison still and still be freeâ Or seem as free? Alone, and prove The hopeless hopes of real love? Does real love on earth exist? 'Tis like a sunbeam in the mist, That fades and nowhere will remain, And nowhere is o'ertook again. Say, what is love? A blooming name, A rose-leaf on the page of fame, That blooms, then fades, to cheat no more, And is what nothing was before? Say, what is love? Whate'er it be, It centres, Mary, still with thee. THE EXILE Love is the mainspring of existence. It Becomes a soul whereby I live to love. On all I see, that dearest name is writ; Falsehood is hereâbut truth has life above, Where every star that shines exists in love. Skies vary in their clouds, the seasons vary From heat to cold, change cannot constant prove; The south is brightâbut smiles can act contrary; My guide-star gilds the north, and shines with Mary. My life hath been one love:âno, blot it out; My life hath been one chain of contradictions, Madhouses, prisons, whore-shopsânever doubt But that my life hath had some strong convictions That such was wrong; religion makes restrictions I would have followedâbut life turned a bubble, And clomb the giant stile of maledictions; They took me from my wife, and to save trouble I wed again, and made the error double. Yet absence claims them both, and keeps them too, And locks me in a shop, in spite of law, Among a low-lived set and dirty crew: Here let the Muse oblivion's curtain draw, And let man thinkâfor God hath often saw Things here too dirty for the light of day; For in a madhouse there exists no law. Now stagnant grows my too refinÃ¨d clay; I envy birds their wings to fly away. Absence in love is worse than any fate; Summer is winter's desert, and the spring Is like a ruined city desolate; Joy dies and hope retires on feeble wing; Nature sinks heedless; birds unheeded sing. 'Tis solitude in city's crowds; all move Like living death, though all to life still cling. The strongest, bitterest thing that life can prove Is woman's undisguise of hate and love. How beautiful this hill of fern swells on, So beautiful the chapel peeps between The hornbeams, with its simple bell; alone I wander here, hid in a palace green. Mary is absent, but the forest queen, Nature, is with me; morning, noon, and gloaming, I write my poems in these paths unseen; And when among these brakes and beeches roaming, I sigh for truth and home and love and woman. Here is the chapel yard enclosed with pales, And oak-trees nearly top its little bell; Here is the little bridge with guiding rails That lead me on to many a pleasant dell; The fern-owl chitters like a startled knell To nature, yet 'tis sweet at evening still; A pleasant road curves round the gentle swell, Where nature seems to have her own sweet will, Planting her beech and thorn about the sweet fern hill. I have had many loves, and seek no more; These solitudes my last delights shall be. The leaf-hid forest and the lonely shore Seem to my mind like beings that are free. Yet would I had some eye to smile on me, Some heart where I could make a happy home in, Sweet Susan that was wont my love to be, And Bessy of the glenâfor I've been roaming With both at morn and noon and dusky gloaming. Cares gather round; I snap their chains in two, And smile in agony and laugh in tears; Like playing with a deadly serpent who Stings to the death, there is no room for fears, Where death would bring me happiness; his shears Kill cares that hiss to poison many a vein; The thought to be extinct my fate endears; Pale death, the grand physician, cures all pain; The dead rest well who lived for joys in vain. This twilight seems a veil of gauze and mist; Trees seem dark hills between the earth and sky; Winds sob awake, and then a gusty hist Fans through the wheat, like serpents gliding by. I love to stretch my length 'tween earth and sky, And see the inky foliage o'er me wave. Though shades are still my prison where I lie, Long use grows nature, which I easy brave, And think how sweet cares rest within the grave. Remind me not of other years, nor tell My broken hopes of joys they are to meet, While thy own falsehood rings the loudest knell To one fond heart that aches, too cold to beat. Mary, how oft with fondness I repeat That name alone to give my troubles rest; The very sound, though bitter, seemeth sweet; In my love's home and thy own faithless breast, Truth's bonds are broke and every nerve distressed. Life is to me a dream that never wakes; Night finds me on this lengthening road alone; Love is to me a thought that ever aches, A frost-bound thought that freezes life to stone. Mary, in truth and nature still my own, That warms the winter of my aching breast, Thy name is joy, nor will I life bemoan; Midnight, when sleep takes charge of nature's rest, Finds me awake and friendlessânot distressed. Friend of the friendless, from a host of snares, From lying varlets and from friendly foes, I sought thy quiet truth to ease my cares, And on the blight of reason found repose. But when the strife of nature ceased her throes, And other hearts would beat for my return, I trusted fate to ease my world of woes, Seeking love's harbour where I now sojourn; But hell is heaven, could I cease to mourn For her, for one whose very name is yet My hell or heaven, and will ever be. Falsehood is doubtâbut I can ne'er forget Oaths virtuous falsehood volunteered to me, To make my soul new bonds, which God made free. God's gift is love, and do I wrong the giver To plead affections wrong from God's decree? No, when farewell upon my lips did quiver And all seemed lost, I loved her more than ever. Now come the balm and breezes of the spring; Not with the pleasures of my early days, When nature seemed one endless song to sing Of joyous melody and happy praise. Ah, would they come agen! But life betrays Quicksands, and gulfs, and storms that howl and sting All quiet into madness and delays. Care hides the sunshine with its raven wing, And hell glooms sadness o'er the songs of spring. My mind is dark and fathomless, and wears The hues of hopeless agony and hell; No plummet ever sounds the soul's affairs; There death eternal never sounds the knell; There love imprisoned sighs the long farewell, And still may sigh, in thoughts no heart hath penned, Alone, in loneliness where sorrows dwell; And hopeless hope hopes on and meets no end, Wastes without springs and homes without a friend. Yet love lives on in every kind of weather, In heats and colds, in sunshine and in gloom; Winter may blight and stormy clouds may gather, Nature invigorates and love will bloom; It fears no sorrow in a life to come, But lives within itself from year to year, As doth the wild flower in its own perfume; As in the Lapland snows spring's blooms appear, So true love blooms and blossoms everywhere. The dew falls on the weed and on the flower, The rose and thistle bathe their heads in dew; The lowliest heart may have its prospering hour, The saddest bosom meets its wishes true; E'en I may love and happiness renew, Though not the sweets of my first early days, When one sweet face was all the loves I knew, And my soul trembled on her eyes to gaze, Whose very censure seemed intended praise. Flow on, my verse, though barren thou mayst be Of thought; yet sing, and let thy fancies roll; In early days thou swept a mighty sea, All calm in troublous deeps, and spurned control. Thou fire and iceberg to an aching soul, And still an angel in my gloomy way, Far better opiate than the draining bowl, Still sing, my muse, to drive care's fiends away, Nor heed what loitering listener hears the lay. Her looks were like the spring, her very voice Was spring's own music, more than song to me; Choice of my boyhood, nay, my soul's first choice, From her sweet thraldom I am never free. Yet here my prison is a spring to me, Past memories bloom like flowers where'er I rove, My very bondage, though in snares, is free; I love to stretch me in this shady grove And muse upon the memories of love. Hail, solitude, still peace, and lonely good, Thou spirit of all joys to be alone, My best of friends, these glades and this green wood, Where nature is herself, and loves her own; The heart's hid anguish, here I make it known, And tell my troubles to the gentle wind; Friends' cold neglects have froze my heart to stone, And wrecked the voyage of a quiet mind, With wives and friends and every hope disjoined; Wrecked of all hopes save one, to be alone, Where solitude becomes my wedded mate; Sweet forest! with rich beauties overgrown, Where solitude is queen and reigns in state; Hid in green trees I hear the clapping gate And voices calling to the rambling cows. I laugh at love and all its idle fate; The present hour is all my lot allows; An age of sorrow springs from lovers' vows. Sweet is the song of birds, for that restores The soul to harmony, the mind to love; 'Tis nature's song of freedom out of doors, Forests beneath, free winds and clouds above; The thrush and nightingale and timid dove Breathe music round me where the gipsies dwell; Pierced hearts, left burning in the doubts of love, Are desolate where crowds and cities dwell; The splendid palace seems the gates of hell. WRITTEN IN A THUNDERSTORM, 15 JULY 1841 The heavens are wroth; the thunder's rattling peal Rolls like a vast volcano in the sky; Yet nothing starts the apathy I feel, Nor chills with fear eternal destiny. My soul is apathy, a ruin vast; Time cannot clear the ruined mass away; My life is hell, the hopeless die is cast, And manhood's prime is premature decay. Roll on, ye wrath of thunders, peal on peal, Till worlds are ruins, and myself alone; Melt heart and soul, cased in obdurate steel, Till I can feel that nature is my throne. I live in love, sun of undying light, And fathom my own heart for ways of good; In its pure atmosphere, day without night Smiles on the plains, the forest, and the flood. Smile on, ye elements of earth and sky, Or frown in thunders as ye frown on me; Bid earth and its delusions pass away, But leave the mind, as its creator, free. HOMELESS I've wandered many a weary mile âLove in my heart was burningâ To seek a home in Mary's smile, But cold is life's sojourning; The cold ground was a feather-bed, âTruth never acts contraryâ I had no home above my head, My home was love and Mary. I had no home in early youth, When my first love was thwarted; But if her heart still beats with truth We'll nevermore be parted. And changing as her love may be, My own shall never vary; Nor night nor day I'm never free, But sigh for absent Mary. Nor night nor day, nor sun nor shade, Week, month, nor rolling year, Repairs the breach wronged love hath made: There madness, misery here. Life's lease was lengthened by her smiles, âAre truth and love contrary? No ray of hope my fate beguiles; I've lost love, home, and Mary. THE RETURN: NORTHBOROUGH, 1841 Now melancholy autumn comes anew With showery clouds and fields of wheat tanned brown; Along the meadow banks I peace pursue And see the wild flowers gleaming up and down, Like sun and light; the ragwort's golden crown Mirrors like sunshine when sunbeams retire, And silver yarrow: there's the little town, And o'er the meadows gleams that slender spire, Reminding me of one, and waking fond desire. I love thee, nature, in my inmost heart; Go where I will, thy truth seems from above; Go where I will, thy landscape forms a part Of heaven: e'en these fens, where wood nor grove Are seen, their very nakedness I love, For one dwells nigh that secret hopes prefer Above the race of women; like the dove, I mourn her absence; fate, that would deter My hate for all things, strengthens love for her. That form from boyhood loved and still loved on, That voice, that look, that face of one delight, Love's register for years, months, weeks, time past and gone, Her looks were ne'er forgot nor out of sight. Mary, the muse of every song I write, Thy cherished memory never leaves my own; Though care's chill winter doth my manhood blight, And freeze, like Niobe, my thoughts to stone, Our lives are two, our end and aim is one. 'Tis pleasant, now day's hours begin to pass To dewy eve, to walk down narrow close, And feel one's feet among refreshing grass, And hear the insects in their homes discourse, And startled blackbird fly, from covert close Of whitethorn hedge, with wild fear-fluttering wings, And see the spire and hear the clock toll hoarse, And whisper names and think o'er many things That love hurds up in truth's imaginings. Fame blazed upon me like a comet's glare; Fame waned and left me like a fallen star, Because I told the evil what they were And truth and falsehood never wished to mar; My life hath been a wreckâand I've gone far For peace and truth and hope, for home and rest; Like Eden's gates, fate throws a constant bar; Thought may o'ertake the sunset in the west, Man meet no home within a woman's breast. Though they are blazoned in the poet's song And all the comforts which our lives contain, I read and sought such joys my whole life long, And found the best of poets sung in vain. But still I read and sighed and sued again, And lost no purpose where I had the will; I almost worshipped; when my toils grew vain, Finding no antidote my pains to kill, I sigh, a poet and a lover still. Dull must that being live who sees unmoved The scenes and objects that his childhood knew; The schoolyard and the maid he early loved, The sunny wall where long the old elms grew, The grass that e'en till noon retains the dew Beneath the walnut shadeâI see them still, Though not such fancies do I now pursue; Yet still the picture turns my bosom chill, And leaves a void nor love nor hope may fill. After long absence how the mind recalls Pleasing associations of the past: Haunts of his youth, thorn hedges and old walls, And hollow trees that sheltered from the blast, And all that map of boyhood, overcast With glooms and wrongs and sorrows not his own, That o'er his brow like the scathed lightning past, That turned his spring to winter, and alone Wrecked name and fame and all, to solitude unknown. So on he lives in glooms and living death, A shade like night, forgetting and forgot; Insects, that kindle in the spring's young breath, Take hold of life and share a brighter lot Than he, the tenant of the hall and cot; The princely palace too hath been his home, And gipsy's camp when friends would know him not; In midst of wealth, a beggar still to roam, Parted from one whose heart was once his home. And yet not parted; still love's hope illumes, And like the rainbow, brightest in the storm, It looks for joy beyond the wreck of tombs, And in life's winter keeps love's embers warm. The ocean's roughest tempest meets a calm, Care's thickest cloud shall break in sunny joy; O'er the parched waste, showers yet shall fall like balm, And she, the soul of life, for whom I sigh, Like flowers shall cheer me when the storm is by. SEPTEMBER MORNINGS Sweet come the misty morning in September; Among the dewy paths 'tis sweet to stray, Greensward or stubbles, as I well remember I have done, and the mist it curleth grey And thick as smoke; like net-work on the spray Or seeded grass, the cobweb draperies run, Beaded with pearls of dew at early day; And on the pleachy stubbles peeps the sun, The lamp of day when that of night is done. The blackbird startles from the homestead hedge, Raindrops and leaves fall yellow as he springs; Such images are nature's sweetest pledge, To me there's music in his rustling wings. âPrink, prink,â he cries, and loud the robin sings; The small hawk like a shot drops from the sky Close to my feet for mice and creeping things, Then, swift as thought, again he suthers by, And hides among the clouds from each pursuing eye. The meadow flowers now rustle, bleached and dank And misted o'er with down as fine as dew. The sloe and dewberry shine along the bank Where weeds in bloom's luxuriance lately grew. Red rose the sun, and up the moor-hen flew; From bank to bank the meadow arches stride, Where foamy floods in winter tumble through And spread a restless ocean foaming wide, Where now the cow-boys sleep, nor fear the coming tide. MARY 'Tis autumn now, and nature's scenes, The pleachy fields and yellowing tree, Lose all their blooming hues and greens; But nature finds no change in me. The fading woods, the russet grange, The hues of nature may desert; But naught in me shall find a change To wrong the angel of my heart. For Mary is my angel still Through every month and every ill. The leaves they loosen from the branch And fall upon the gusty wind; But my heart's silent love is staunch, And naught can tear her from my mind. The flowers are gone from dell and bower, Though crowds from summer's lap were given; But love is an eternal flower, Like purple amaranths of heaven. To Mary first my heart did bow. And if she's true she keeps it now. Just as the summer keeps the flower Which spring concealed in hoods of gold, Or unripe harvest met the shower And made earth's blessings manifold; Just so my Mary lives for me, A silent thought for months and years; The world may live in revelry, Her name my lonely quiet cheers; And cheer it will, whate'er may be, While Mary lives in bloom for me. DEWDROPS The dewdrops on every blade of grass are so much like silver drops that I am obliged to stoop down as I walk to see if they are pearls, and those sprinkled on the ivy-woven beds of primroses underneath the hazels, whitethorns, and maples are so like gold beads that I stooped down to feel if they were hard, but they melted from my finger. And where the dew lies on the primrose, the violet and whitethorn leaves, they are emerald and beryl, yet nothing more than the dews of the morning on the budding leaves; nay, the road grasses are covered with gold and silver beads, and the further we go the brighter they seem to shine, like solid gold and silver. It is nothing more than the sun's light and shade upon them in the dewy morning; every thorn-point and every bramble-spear has its trembling ornament: till the wind gets a little brisker, and then all is shaken off, and all the shining jewelry passes away into a common spring morning full of budding leaves, primroses, violets, vernal speedwell, bluebell and orchis, and commonplace objects. SPRING'S NOSEGAY The prim daisy's golden eye On the fallow land doth lie, Though the spring is just begun: Pewits watch it all the day, And the skylark's nest of hay Is there by its dried leaves in the sun. There the pilewort, all in gold, 'Neath the ridge of finest mould, Blooms to cheer the ploughman's eye: There the mouse his hole hath made, And 'neath the golden shade Hides secure when the hawk is prowling by. Here's the speedwell's sapphire blue; Was there anything more true To the vernal season still? Here it decks the bank alone, Where the milkmaid throws a stone At noon, to cross the rapid, flooded rill. Here the cowslip, chill with cold, On the rushy bed behold, It looks for sunshine all the day. Here the honey-bee will come, For he has no sweets at home; Then quake his weary wing and fly away. And here are nameless flowers, Culled in cold and rawky hours For my Mary's happy home. They grew in murky blea Rush-fields and naked lea, But suns will shine and pleasing spring will come. OH, WERT THOU IN THE STORM Oh, wert thou in the storm, How I would shield thee! To keep thee dry and warm A camp I would build thee. Though the clouds poured again, Not a drop should harm thee; The music of wind and rain Rather should charm thee. Oh, wert thou in the storm, A shed I would build for thee, To keep thee dry and warm. How I would shield thee! The rain should not wet thee Nor thunderclap harm thee; By thy side I would set me To comfort and warm thee. I would sit by thy side, love, While the dread storm was over, And the wings of an angel My charmer would cover. LOVE CANNOT DIE In crime and enmity they lie Who sin and tell us love can die, Who say to us in slander's breath That love belongs to sin and death. From heaven it came on angel's wing To bloom on earth, eternal spring; In falsehood's enmity they lie Who sin and tell us love can die. 'Twas born upon an angel's breast. The softest dreams, the sweetest rest, The brightest sun, the bluest sky, Are love's own home and canopy. The thought that cheers this heart of mine Is that of loveâlove so divine, They sin who say in slander's breath That love belongs to sin and death. The sweetest voice that lips contain, The sweetest thought that leaves the brain, The sweetest feeling of the heartâ There's pleasure in its very smart. The scent of rose and cinnamon Is not like love remembered on; In falsehood's enmity they lie Who sin and tell us love can die. CHILDHOOD Oh, dear to us ever the scenes of our childhood, The green spots we played in, the school where we met, The heavy old desk where we thought of the wild wood, Where we pored o'er the sums which the master had set. I loved the old church school both inside and outside, I loved the dear ash-trees and sycamore too, The graves where the buttercups burning gold outvied, And the spire where pellitory dangled and grew, The bees in the wall that were flying about The thistles, the henbane and mallows all day, And crept in the hole when the sun had gone out And the butterfly ceased on the blossoms to play. Oh, clear is the round stone upon the green hill, The pinfold hoof-printed with oxen and bare, The old prince's-feather-tree growing there still, And the swallows and martins whirling round in the air; Where the chaff whipping outwards lodges round the barn door, And the dunghill cock struts with his hens in the rear, And sings âCock-a-doodleâ full twenty times o'er, And then claps his wings as he'd fly in the air; And there's the old cross with its roundabout steps, And the weathercock creaking quite round in the wind, And there's the old hedge with its glossy red hips, Where the green linnet's nest I have hurried to find To be in time for the school or before the bell rung; There's the odd martins' nest o'er the shoemaker's door; On the shoemaker's chimney the old swallows sung That had built and sung there in the season before; Then we went to seek pooties among the old furze On the heaths, in the meadows, beside the deep lake, And returned with torn clothes all covered wi' burs, And oh, what a row my fond mother would make! Then to play boiling kettles just by the yard door, Seeking out for short sticks and a bundle of straw; Bits of pots stand for teacups after sweeping the floor, And the children are placed under schoolmistress' awe; There's one set for pussy, another for doll, And for butter and bread they'd each nibble a haw, And on a great stone as a table they loll, The finest small tea-party ever you saw. The stiles we rode upon âall-a-cock-horse,â The mile-a-minute swee On creaking gate, the stools o' moss, What happy seats had we! There's naught can compare to the days of our childhood, The mole-hills like sheep in a pen, Where the clodhopper sings like the bird in the wild wood, All forgotten before we are men. TO MY WIFEâA VALENTINE Oh, once I had a true love, As blest as I could be: Patty was my turtle-dove, And Patty she loved me. We walked the fields together, By roses and woodbine, In summer's sunshine weather, And Patty she was mine. We stopped to gather primroses, And violets white and blue, In pastures and green closes All glistening with the dew. We sat upon green mole-hills, Among the daisy flowers, To hear the small birds' merry trills, And share the sunny hours. The blackbird on her grassy nest We would not scare away, Who nuzzling sat with brooding breast On her eggs for half the day. The chaffinch chirruped on the thorn, And a pretty nest had she; The magpie chattered all the morn From her perch upon the tree. And I would go to Patty's cot, And Patty came to mine; Each knew the other's very thought As birds at Valentine. And Patty had a kiss to give, And Patty had a smile, To bid me hope and bid me love, At every stopping stile. We loved one summer quite away, And when another came, The cowslip close and sunny day, It found us much the same. We both looked on the selfsame thing, Till both became as one; The birds did in the hedges sing, And happy time went on. The brambles from the hedge advance, In love with Patty's eyes: On flowers, like ladies at a dance, Flew scores of butterflies. I claimed a kiss at every stile, And had her kind replies. The bees did round the woodbine toil, Where sweet the small wind sighs. Then Patty was a slight young thing; Now she's long past her teens; And we've been married many springs, And mixed in many scenes. And I'll be true for Patty's sake, And she'll be true for mine; And I this little ballad make, To be her valentine. BONNY LASSIE O! Oh, the evening's for the fair, bonny lassie O! To meet the cooler air and walk an angel there, With the dark dishevelled hair, Bonny lassie O! The bloom's on the brere, bonny lassie O! Oak-apples on the tree; and wilt thou gang to see The shed I've made for thee, Bonny lassie O! 'Tis agen the running brook, bonny lassie O! In a grassy nook hard by, with a little patch of sky, And a bush to keep us dry, Bonny lassie O! There's the daisy all the year, bonny lassie O! There's the kingcup bright as gold, and the speedwell never cold, And the arum leaves unrolled, Bonny lassie O! Oh, meet me at the shed, bonny lassie O! With the woodbine peeping in, and the roses like thy skin Blushing, thy praise to win, Bonny lassie O! I will meet thee there at e'en, bonny lassie O! When the bee sips in the bean, and grey willow-branches lean, And the moonbeam looks between, Bonny lassie O! MARY It is the evening hour, How silent all doth lie: The hornÃ¨d moon she shows her face In the river with the sky. Prest by the path on which we pass, The flaggy lake lies still as glass. Spirit of her I love, Whispering to me Stores of sweet visions as I rove, Here stop, and crop with me Sweet flowers that in the still hour grewâ We'll take them home, nor shake off the bright dew. Mary, or sweet spirit of thee, As the bright sun shines to-morrow Thy dark eyes these flowers shall see, Gathered by me in sorrow, In the still hour when my mind was free To walk aloneâyet wish I walked with thee. STANZAS [Oh, the world keeps running round] Oh, the world keeps running round With contrariness to me; There's falsehood in the sound Of all I hear and see. My love, she's not so pretty As many others be, Nor talkative nor witty, Yet very dear to me. In the yellow gorse I see her, But that's wi' fancy's eye, For I'm longing to be wi' her While in prison bonds I lie. Furze-bushes like to gillyflowers More yellow are than gold; I've loved her there in summer hours With joyfulness untold. The furze-bush is a prickly tree Whose flowers attract the bees, But false love's often wounded me With sharper thorns than these. I met my love upon the heath In summer's pleasant hours, She wore no thorns to be my death, She brought me naught but flowers. And she shall be my only love, No other I'll prefer; For by that sun that shines above I'll love but only her. We'll walk the mole-hill banks between, Where wild thyme smells so sweet, And at the dewy close of e'en I there my love shall meet. SONG [Oh, haud yer tongues, ye sylvan elves] Oh, haud yer tongues, ye sylvan elves, Yer gladness is but waes, And keep yer sangs within yerselves For maybe better days; Another birdie sings to me, Maks ither music vain, And fills my heart with sorrow's glee Till pleasure springs frae pain. Sae haud yer tongues, ye sylvan elves, And keep yer singing to yerselves. I wish I lived in upper skies Beyond the golden starn; Angels wi' mercy in their eyes My secret thoughts might learn. Oh, for the luv of those bright een When you war sorrow's ain Makes me e'en sick o'places green, My heart cauld as a stane. Sae haud yer tongues, ye sylvan elves, And keep yer singing to yerselves. INVITATION TO ETERNITY Say, wilt thou go with me, sweet maid, Say, maiden, wilt thou go with me Through the valley-depths of shade, Of night and dark obscurity; Where the path has lost its way, Where the sun forgets the day, Where there's nor light nor life to see, Sweet maiden, wilt thou go with me? Where stones will turn to flooding streams, Where plains will rise like ocean's waves, Where life will fade like visioned dreams And mountains darken into caves, Say, maiden, wilt thou go with me Through this sad non-identity, Where parents live and are forgot, And sisters live and know us not? Say, maiden, wilt thou go with me In this strange death-in-life to be, To live in death and be the same, Without this life or home or name, At once to be and not to beâ That was and is notâyet to see Things pass like shadows, and the sky Above, below, around us lie? The land of shadows wilt thou trace, Nor look nor know each other's face; The present marred with reason gone, And past and present all as one? Say, maiden, can thy life be led To join the living and the dead? Then trace thy footsteps on with me; We are wed to one eternity. THE SLEEP OF SPRING Oh, for that sweet, untroubled rest That poets oft have sung!â The babe upon its mother's breast, The bird upon its young, The heart asleep without a painâ When shall I know that sleep again? When shall I be as I have been Upon my mother's breast Sweet nature's garb of verdant green To woo to perfect restâ Love in the meadow, field, and glen, And in my native wilds agen? The sheep within the fallow field, The herd upon the green, The larks that in the thistle shield, And pipe from morn to e'enâ Oh for the pasture, field, and fen! When shall I see such rest agen? I love the weeds along the fen, More sweet than garden flowers, For freedom haunts the humble glen That blest my happiest hours. Here prison injures health and me: I love sweet freedom and the free. The crows upon the swelling hills, The cows upon the lea, Sheep feeding by the pasture rills, Are ever dear to me, Because sweet freedom is their mate While I am lone and desolate. I loved the winds when I was young, When life was dear to me; I loved the song which nature sung, Endearing liberty; I loved the wood, the vale, the stream, For there my boyhood used to dream. There even toil itself was play; 'Twas pleasure e'en to weep; 'Twas joy to think of dreams by day, The beautiful of sleep. When shall I see the wood and plain, And dream those happy dreams again?</field>
