      <field name="fulltext">For Fools are Stubborn in their Way, As Coins are hardned by th' Allay, And Obstinacy's ne'r so stiff, As when 'tis in a wrong belief. Hudibras, Part 3. Canto 2.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">THE Jacobite Conventicle. Tedious have been our hopes, and long our Prayers, Within the compass of the three past Years, How oft in private have we met to Mourn, And whine and snivel for Our Lord's Return? Our Wishes too, how strangely were they crost, When the French Fleet drew near the English Coast, When we expected our Deliverance near, From Choaking Oaths and Taxes so Severe; A glimps of Heaven we having then in view, But ah! how soon that gawdy Scene withdrew, Leaving a dismal Prospect in its room, Of thousand Miseries are yet to come; Must still our thoughts endure the wracking pain, Always to hope, and wish, but yet in vain? Nay, Heaven it self, to add to our Dispairs, Seems to neglect and put by all our Prayers Is there no hopes that wretched, cheated we, Shall Once more taste of Luscious Liberty; Once more be thought the Favourites of the Nation, And trample o're the Men of Abdication? Those Rogues, who to increase their guilty score, Found out a word was never heard before. Yet there a time may come, (but when it will, Exceeds the reach of Learned Gadb'rys Skill) When Loyalty shall meet in due regard, And those that dare be honest, find reward. The time may come—when Right will have its place, And lie no longer under Black Disgrace. To Skill in Stars, tho I make no pretence, Methinks I view it in the Present Sense; Methinks I see th'Approaching smiling Years, Roul on a-pace to recompence our Tears. Fly fast, ye Weeks, ye Months, post quickly on, And settle J???once more upon his Throne. But hold—to what strange Notions am I brought By the too strong Impulses of my thought? To Church I'll go—that word, Good Heaven, forgive, The Church shall be my Odium while I live: I hate the Priest, who has a Double Face, Religion's Scandal, and his Gown's Disgrace. Give me the Man with Conscience void of blame, Is in all Turns of Government the same, Who hates Rebellion, nor can Treason bless, And does not judge of Actions by Success: That Man should never starve while I was able, I'de serve him with my Purse, my Bed, my Table; His Doctrine I much sooner would believe, Than a Spruce Bishop's in his white Lawn Sleeve: Such Men I've heard, and hope to hear agen. Bless me! 'tis late—the Clock has just struck ten. But hold—Before to Fetter Lane I go, 'Tis requisite the Entrance word I know: Last Sunday 'twas Commandement the fifth, And now St. Germains is the Shibboleth. 'Tis fo—and now with eager steps I fly To the true Church of England's Ministry, To hear a sort of Men who ever knew, Still to be faithful, loyal, firm and true, Who from their Souls detest the swearing Vice, Eeither to get or keep a Benefice. Thus I in Temple-Cloysters walking, O're heard a Man t' himself a talking: But if for Lye you this will Chalk; At least I thought he thus would talk; For by a Discontented Phiz, One sometimes reads a Thought which lies, Full Fifteen Fathom under Water: If this is false, thank Erra Pater For in his Book, the Fourteenth Chapter, About an Astrological Rapture, He says,—But why do I thus strive To tell you what you wont believe? But I my self being somewhat curious, Did follow this Old Huncks Penurious, Through Streets, Lanes, Alleys and By-ways, More than are found in Stow's Surveys, Traversing almost as much Ground, As on New-Market Heath is found, Leading me such a dainty jaunt, As if one on an Errand sent, Missing his way, which did not hap well, Should go by Lambeth to White-Chappel; How'ere at last, in Lane of Fetter, Than which, there is not many better, In Magpye-court, or Yard, or Alley, For which 'twas, Faith, I cannot tell ye, He stopt at Door, which stood at jar, And whisp'ring softly in the Ear, Of one whose looks declar'd Suspicion, Receiv'd into the House Admission: I seeing this, with Confidence, Whate're might be the consequence, Went boldly up, and gave the Sign, (The Word I mean) and so got in; But by their jealous Looks and Eyes, I plainly read their strange Surprize, To see one to their Meeting come, Whom they believ'd was none of Them; They Star'd—and I forgot to Blush, But boldly to the midst I rush, And sate me down upon a Hassock, Expecting Clergy-man in Cassock, That Holy Smith who blows the Coals Of Discontent, and Saves their Souls, By telling them that no Salvation Can be to Men of Abdication, And that a Hell is still appointed For those resist the Lord's Anointed. But he, it seems, was not come yet, But staid behind to take a Whet Of White Wine, in a brimming Taster, In Mem'ry of his Absent Master, Which might his Spirits better quicken; But now the Plot begins to Thicken, Folks to the Place in Clusters Trolling, (As Snow-balls gather by their Rolling, So fast, altho the Room was Large, 'T was cram'd as full as Gravesend Barge, 'Tho different Sexes, different Ages, (For some were Youths and some were Sages) Made up this private Congregation, Yet Envy, Discontent and Passion, In Face of every one appear'd, Both of smooth Chin and grisly Beard, As plain as is the Light in Phœbus, When he Looks down on Mortal Rebus. Nor could the grinning smile conceal The Passions, which in Breast they feel, As if these People took delight, Only to wait on God for Spite; Soft buzzing Whispers fill the Room, And into close Committees, some Retire, to give their Thoughts a Vent, And Drevil forth their Discontent, Which Poyson, as the one spits forth, The other Licks it up, in Troth. A Man perceiving of a Dry Nod, Came to a little Private Synod, Or Junto, which was just behind me, To prate they fall, and did not mind me; But not in words so soft and Butter'd, But I could hear each word they Vtter'd; Quoth one, I wonder what a Devil Should make the Parliament so civil, Such Taxes on the Land to Draw, We must make Bricks, yet have no Straw; If they go on, 'tis plain and clear, The French, which we so idly fear, As soon will make Descent on Finland, As e're Attempt to Land in England. Within three years we shall become The Poorest State in Christendom; All Nations will on us be Pissing, And we become the Scorn and Hissing, Of all the Kingdoms which are known, 'Twixt us and Land of Prester John. Besides, the Mony which is Rais'd Pays not the English, God be Prais'd; No, poor contented Villains, they Must venture on, yet have no Pay, Except a little small Subsistance, A very trifling small Assistance, Just to keep Life and Soul together, Against the force of Wind and Weather, Whilst Brandenburgers, Danes and Dutchmen, Sweeds, Germans, and all other such Men, Are duly paid off to a Penny, And long Arrears they have not any. You speak the very truth on't Neighbour, Replies his Friend (with Thought in Labour To be Deliver'd of some Matter, Which sore opprest his Pia Mater) If our forefathers were complaining, That Rome was still their Purses Draining; By Peter's Pence, and such Taxation, How just are now the Cries o'th' Nation? Four Shillings first in every Pound, Did fine Estates most largely wound, (Estates as well as Bodies needing, For their Healths sake a timely Bleeding) The Double Excise, which all men reckon'd, To hold but one year, lasts a Second, And it may still for ought that we know, Till Day of Judgment so continue; But that which was the topping sole Act Of the last Sessions, was the Poll Act, Where each man must, or nill, or willing, For's Head, pay quarterly a Shilling, When most Mens Brains in Head which rest, Sir, Are hardly worth a single Tester; But 'tis much better sure in one sense To Pay for Head, than Pay for Conscience, For Faith I should be very loth To Pay Two pounds or take an Oath. The Oaths!—As soon I'de swallow Ratsbane, Or any other Poyson that's Bane, (Rejoyns a third) O 'bomination, What swallow down my own Damnation; A Butter'd Hedg-hog I could better Digest, than of the Oaths a Letter. But pray what News have y' in the City? Sure matters there go very pretty, And Guineas into Guild-hall go, As if our Land were Mexico, Or as each Merchant there a Dweller, Had found a Golden Mine in's Celler: Well, if their Faith for things above, Like that for things below, does prove, 'Tis Ten to One, and Two to Eleven, They all of them will meet in Heaven. They say the King and all his Allies, (Speaks a fourth Man amongst these fellows) Intend, as folk's report most true is, To pull down Pride of Mighty Lewis, And William for a Wager carries His Arms into the Heart of Paris, And of the strange Opinion some are, That all this must be done this Summer: Well, they may please their idle Fancies, With such like Tales and State Romances; But I believe they'l find more Odds, Than Giants did that Fought with Gods; Alas, their mighty Preparations, Made of the Scum of several Nations, Are not to France so Formidable, As are to Us a City Rabble; You'll find their Mighty Hopes Defeated, And They most miserably Cheated. Hold, let's forbear our idle Tales, Hes come,—Who is't?—Why Mr. Sh??? A precious Man.—Hist, silence there, At which all instantly forbear, And looking at the Ministers,—God bless you, Sir. His Surplice on, and then prepare To Joyn with him in Common-Prayer, Nor Psalms nor Prayers does he omit any, Till coming to that place i'th' Littany, Wherein oblig'd by Name to Pray, For those who bear the Sovereign Sway; He did in's Prayers no Name put in, But those of Gracious King and Queen; Which Prayer, no sooner did it reach the Ears of them all,—but—We beseech thee, Echoed more loud by Persons there, Than the Responce to any Prayer, Which in the Liturgy we read, From the Lord's Prayer to Nicene Creed. The Service done, I then expected T'ave heard a singing Psalm directed; But having got the Pious Qualms, Their Souls were not in tune for Psalms, For how can ever Captives bring Their Minds into a Frame to Sing? Tho it is plain that Fetters none They had, but what themselves put on; But if they would have tun'd their throats, To Sternholds or to Hopkins Notes, It would, according as 'tis reckond, Have been to Psalm call'd Seventy Second, Lord give thy Judgments to the King, Therein Instruct him well, And with his Son that Princely thing, Lord, let thy Justice dwell. But now the Priest was to Pulpit gone, At least to what might pass for one; After a short Prayer, not forgetting Of King and Queen, to mind his Knitting, Who with a Zeal most mighty Fervent, Were thought of by their suffering Servant; Remembring likewise most Devoutly, To Pray for Mother Church most stoutly, The Church of England, which they fancy, None out of their Communion can see; The Church opprest, distrest and warried, And in a sence Spiritually carried Captive away, whilst its Adorners Are forc'd to Preach and Pray in Corners. This done, and th' Audience composing Themselves for Hearing, or for Dozing; To a Bible of Geneva size, Himself Devoutly Priest applies, And from a thousand various Texts, This part of Scripture strait Selects. ROM. 13. 1, 2. Let every Soul be Subject to the Higher Powers, &amp;c. Whosoever therefore Resisteth the Power, Resisteth the Ordinance of God, and they that Resist, shall receive to themselves Damnation. The Text (quoth he) beloved, plainly Holds forth, that every one should mainly Strive who should most Enriched be With the Dear Jewel Loyalty: I do not mean the Counterfeit, Which every one that Swears can get, To save their Purses, having a mind; Theirs is a Bristol Stone—no Diamond; But I do mean that Sacred Jewel, Which flattering Arts, nor open Cruelty of Men, e're with all their Bluster, Could make it lose its sparkling Lustre; A Good, by Holy Writ Commended, With thousand Blessings still attended, A Virtue which the very Angels Practise above, or it were strange else, None of them daring to Rebel, Since Lucifer, and his Crew fell, A Virtue all have here I hopen; But now my Text begins to Open. Let every Soul, &amp;c. Let every Soul, —Man, Woman, Child Be with this Holy Virtue fill'd, For there's not one in all the Nation Excepted in this Proclamation, Tho there are thousands senseless Elves, Who wickedly Except themselves, And foolishly suppose that they Were Born to Govern, not Obey; Ah! Parents, for I must be true t'ye, And tell you that it is your Duty, To let your Children hazard at all, Learn, as just as they can Prattle, The Criss-Cross-Row of Loyalty, Before they learn their A. B. C. Tell 'em the Dignity of Crown'd Heads, And make 'em learn to hate the Roundheads; Tell 'em, there nothing is in Nature, So, Monstrous as a Whiggish Creature; Tell 'em—Nay tell 'em any thing T' advance the Glory of a King; Indeed 'tis plain without Correction, That Loyalty implies Subjection. Let every Soul be Subject, &amp;c. That is, let every Soul be ready, With a fixt mind, resolv'd and steddy, To part with Life, Estate, and all, When e're it is his Prince's call; But never let him Hum and Haw, And Question if 'tis done by Law, His Princes Will to him should be The Rule of Law and Equity; But now Beloved let's Discourse Of what is meant by Higher Powers. Let every Soul be Subject to the Higher Powers. That is, that every Soul should be Subject alone to Monarchy; A Government which you and I know, Most certainly is Jur' Divino, Above all other Governments, Which are in Earths most wide Extents: Alas! what man a live is able T'endure the Ruling of a Rabble, But Common-wealths why should we rob, Of th' Glory of a Ruling Mob; Distinctions, they know no other, Than well met Friend, and hale well Brother; But amongst all the Ruling Powers Of Monarchy, there's none like ours; I say, not as 'tis now—alas! My meaning is, as once it was, When Good King—but I'll leave the rest By your Good Judgments to be guest, Whilst in few words I shall Rehearse The Meaning of the Second Verse: Whosoever therefore Resisteth, &amp;c. Beloved, 'tis a dreadful Curse, But good enough, were't ten times worse, For those who meddle in State-matters, And will be Kings and Monarch-haters; Tho most Men make a Recreation Of that so common word Damnation, But they will all to Hell be Carried, As sure as Judas call'd Iscariot, Who in the smallest point or thing, Or thought, Rebel against their King, To whom the Title still we give Of God's true Representative; No wonder then that God is Jealous, When 'gainst his Vice Roy they'r Rebellious; What mighty havock have ye done, Ye wicked Men of Forty One; Nay, I might farther here rejoyn, Ye Belial's Sons of Eighty Nine; Nay Laugh not, for, for all your Jearing, There`s not one Barrel better Herring: Fight `gainst your King!—How my Blood Curdles? Have you a mind to lay on Hurdles? And whether you are Low or High born, With a Psalm end your Days at Tyburn; But my Belov'd, 'tis plain and clear That there are no such Persons here, We are all— Here a sudden noise, To silence put the Preachers Voice, When instantly without much Rabble, An Officer that's call'd Constable, Attended by some Musqueteers, Entred the Room and spoil'd their Geers: Genteels (quoth he) without much Preface, You all my Prisoners are in the place; None Answering him upon that Score, Obedience Passive were all o're; Some few escap't, but those he guest, Were but blind Biggots to the rest; The Priest too, having slipt off Habit, Soon got away like Cased Rabit, The now Detected Conventiclers, Who are for Loyalty such Sticklers, Were carried 'fore a Magistrate, Where little `twould avail to prate; The Oaths were Tendred, and none willing To take `em, each pay Forty Shilling; Patient in Suffering with applause, Not for the Old, but good New Cause. FIIS. Postscript. Ah me! How great a Cordial's Hope, When sawcy Fear don't interlope? How sweetly at the Tett we tipple, Till Fear puts Wormwood on the Nipple? How hot was t'other day's Discourse, That mighty Force of Foot and Horse, Headed by ever Valiant J?s, Were come almost to mouth of Thames; Nay, some to carry on the Joke, Swore he would Land at Puddle-dock; But Expectation is a Blessing, Surmounts the pleasure of Possessing; Yet 'tis a question worth Solution, Who'd gain by such a Revolution? Unless we think Ropes, Fire and Axes, Are milder things than Modern Taxes; Or when from Pockets Rome takes Toll, Is better than a Quarter Poll, And think the Levies of Commission, More cruel than the Inquisition; If words, of mind, the true Intent is, These men are sure Non compos mentis, And Bedlam must be sure Enlarg'd, When 'tis with such State-blockheads charg'd, Where they themselves may hourly tickle, And keep each day a Conventicle.</field>
