      <field name="fulltext">VOLUME I THE HARMONIE of the Church. Containing, The Spirituall Songes and holy Hymnes, of godly men, Patriarkes and Prophetes: all, sweetly sounding, to the praise and glory of the highest. Now (newlie) reduced into sundrie kinds of English Meeter: meete to be read or sung, for the solace and comfort of the godly. TO THE GODLY AND VERTUOUS Lady, the Lady Jane Devoreux of Merivale. THE MOST NOTABLE SONG OF MOSES, containing Gods benefites to his people, which he taught the Children of Israell, a litle before his death: and commanded them to learne it, and teach it unto their children, as a witnesse betweene God and them. Deutronom. Chap. xxxii. Yee Heavens above, unto my speach attend, And Earth below, give eare unto my will: My doctrine shall like pleasant drops discend, My words like heavenly dew shal down distil, Like as sweet showers refresh the hearbs again Or as the grasse is nourish'd by the raine. I will describe Jehovahs name aright, And to that God give everlasting praise: Perfect is he, a God of woondrous might, With judgment he directeth all his waies. He onely true, and without sinne to trust, Righteous is he, and he is onely just. With loathsome sinne now are you all defilde, Not of his seed, but Bastards, basely borne: And from his mercie therefore quite exilde, Mischievous men, through follie all forlorne. Is it not he which hath you dearly bought: Proportion'd you, and made you just of nought? Consider well the times and ages past. Aske thy forefathers, and they shall thee tell, That when Jehovah did devide at last, Th'inheritance that to the Nations fel: And seperating Adams heires, he gave The portion, his Israell should have. His people be the portion of the Lord, Jacob the lot of his inheritance: In wildernesse he hath thee not abhorr'd, But in wild Deserts did thee still advance. He taught thee still and had a care of thee, And kept thee as the apple of his eie. Like as the Eagle tricketh by her neast, Therein to lay her litle birdes full soft, And on her backe doth suffer them to rest, And with her wings doth carie them aloft. Even so the Lord with care hath nourisht thee, And thou hast had no other God but he. And great Jehovah giveth unto thee, The fertilst soyle the earth did ever yeeld: That thou all pleasure mightst beholde and see, And tast the fruit of the most pleasant field: Honey for thee out of the flint he brought, And oile out of the craggie rocke he wrought. With finest butter still he hath thee fed, With milke of Sheep he hath thee cherished: With fat of Lambes, and Rammes in Bazan bred, With flesh of Goates he hath thee nourished. With finest wheat he hath refresht thee still, And gave thee wine, thereof to drink thy fill. But hee that should be thankfull then for this, Once waxing fat, began to spurne and kicke: Thou art so crancke, and such thy grosenesse is, That now to lust thy provender doth pricke. That he that made thee, thou remembrest not, And he that sav'd thee thou hast clean forgot. With Idols they offend his gracious eies, And by their sinne provoke him unto yre: To devils they doo offer sacrifice, Forsake their God, and other goddes desire. Gods whose beginnings were but strange &amp; new, Whom yet their fathers never fear'd nor knew. He which begat thee is cleane out of mind, The God which form'd thee thou doost not regard: The Lord to angre was therewith inclinde, His sonnes and daughters should him so reward. And there he vow'd his chearfull face to hide, To see their end, and what would them betide. For faithlesse they and froward are become, And with no God move me to jelousie: To angre they provoke me all and some, And still offend me with their vanitie: And with no people I will moove them then, And angre them with vaine and foolish men. For why? my wrath is kindled like the fire, And shall descend to the infernall lake: The earth shall be consumed in mine ire, My flames shal make the mighty mountains quake. With many plagues I wil them stil annoy, And with mine arrowes I will them destroy. With hunger, heat and with destruction, I wil them burne, consume and overthrow: They shal be meat for beasts to feed uppon, The ground invenom'd whereupon they goe. In field, in chamber stil my sword shall slay Man, maid &amp; child, with him whose head is gray. And I will scatter them both far and neare, And hence foorth make their memorie to cease, Save that the furious enemie I feare, And that his pride should thereby more increase. And they should say, and foorth this rumor ring, That they and not the Lord have done this thing. They are a nation void of counsell quite, To understand, there doth not one intend: But were they wise, in it they woule delite, And would consider of their latter end. Can one or two put thousands to the flight, Except the Lord do help them with his might? For with our God their Gods may not compare, Our foes themselves will still the same confesse: Their Vines of Sodome and Gomorra are, Their grapes of gaule, clusters of bitternesse. Their wine is like to Dragons poison sure, Or gaule of Aspes, that no man may endure. And have not I laid up in store this thing, Amongst my treasures doo I not it hide? The recompence with vengeance wil I bring, And all in time their foot awry shall slide. For their destruction (loe) is nowe at hand, And mischief here even at their heels doth stand. For why? the Lord doth judge the earth alone, And to his servants shew himselfe most kinde: When he shall see their power is past and gone, And none kept up in hold nor left behind. When men shal say, let us your goddes behold, Where be they now, whom ye so much extold? Which oft did eat the fatted sacrifice, And dranke the wine of the drinke offering: Unto your helpe now let us see them rise: Loe, I am God, and there is no such thing: I kil, give life, I wound, make whole againe, Out of my handes no man can ought retaine. I lift my hands on high to heaven above, Immortall I, and onely live for ever: My glittering sword I sharpe for my behoove, In righteous judgment still I doo persever. I wil send vengeance on mine enemies, And many plagues on them which me dispise. Mine arrowes then of blood shal have their fill, My sword shal eate the verie flesh of men: For such my Saintes as they doo slay and kill, And for the Captives they imprison then. And when I once begin revenge to take, From plague &amp; vengeance then I will not slake. Ye nations all, honour his people then, He will revenge his servantes guiltlesse blood, And surely plague the vile and wicked men, Which stoutlie have against him ever stood. He will shew mercie stil unto his land, And on his people, brought foorth by his hand. A SONG OF MOSES AND THE ISRAELITES, FOR THEIR DELIVERANCE OUT OF EGYPT. The xv. Chap. of Exodus. I will sing praise unto the Lord for aie, Who hath triumphed gloriously alone, The horse and rider he hath overthrowen, And swallowed up even in the raging sea. He is my strength, he is my song of praise, He is the God of my salvation. A Temple will I build to him alone, I will exalt my fathers God alwaies. The Lord Jehovah is a man of warre, Pharao, his chariots, and his mightie hoste Were by his hand in the wilde waters lost, His Captaines drowned in red Sea so farre, Into the bottom there they sanke like stones, The mightie depthes our enemies devour, Thy owne right hand is gloorious in thy power, Thy owne right hand hath bruised al their bones. And in thy glorie thou subverted hast The rebels rising to resist thy power, Thou sentst thy wrath which shall them all devour, Even as the fire doth the stubble wast. And with a blast out of thy nostrilles The flowing flood stood still as any stone, The waters were congealed all in one, And firme and sure as any rockes or hilles. The furious foe so vainly vaunteth stil, And voweth to pursue with endlesse toile, And not returne til he have got the spoile, With fire and sword they wil destroy and kill. Thou sentst the wind which overwhelm'd them all, The surging seas came sousing in againe, As in the water, so with might and maine, Like lead, unto the bottome downe they fall. Oh mightie Lord, who may with thee compare? Amongst the Gods I find none like to thee: Whose glorie's in holines, whose feares in praises be, Whose chiefe delights in working woonders are. Thou stretchest out thy right and holy arme, And presently the earth did them devour: And thou wilt bring us by thy mightie power, As thou hast promist without further harme. And for thy people (Lord) thou shalt provide, A place and seat of quietnesse and rest: The nations all with feare shall be opprest, And Palestina quake for all her pride. The Dukes of Edom shal hang downe the head, The Moabites shall tremble then for feare, The Cananites in presence shall appeare, Like unto men whose fainting heartes were dead, And feare and dread shall fall on them alas, Because thou helpest with thy mighty hand: So stil as stones amazed they shal stand, Oh mightie Lord, while thine elect doo passe. And thou shalt bring thy chosen and elect, Unto the mount of thine inheritance: A place prepared thy people to advance, A Sanctuary there thou shalt erect, Which thou (oh Lord) establish'd hast therefore, And there thy name shal raigne for evermore. THE MOST EXCELLENT SONG WHICH WAS SALOMONS, wherein is declared the true and unfained love betweene Christ and his Church, containing, viii. Chapters. Chap. 1. Let him imbrace his Deare, with many a friendly kisse, For why? thy love than any wine to me more pleasant is: In smel thou art most like, sweet odors unto me, Thy name like precious ointment is, so sweet as sweet may be: Therefore the Virgins al, of thee enamored are, Entice me on to follow thee, loe, we our selves prepare: The King hath brought me in, to chamber richly dight, He is my joy, his love is sweet, the good in him delight. Ye daughters of Jerusalem, although that browne I bee, Than Arras rich or Cedars fruits, I seemlier am to see, Disdaine me not although I be not passing faire, For why? the glowing sunny raies discolloured have my laire: My mothers darlings deare, with envie swelling so, Have me constrain'd to keep their Vine, thus I mine own forgoe. Tell me my sweet and deare, where thou thy flocke doost feed, Or where thy litle Lamblings rest, about midday indeed? Els shall I walke about, all wandring like a stray, And seeke thee after other flocks, through many an unknowne way: If that my pathes (oh Paragon) be so unknowen to thee, Go feed thy flock amongst the tents, wher none but shepherds be. My true and loyal Love, I may thee well compare To famous Pharaos horses great, which in his chariots are, Thy cheeks bedect with precious stone, most lovely to behold, About thy neck likewise do hang great massy chaines of gold. Fine costlie borders for my Love, of gold we wil prepare, With silver studs accordinglie of worke surpassing rare. Whiles he at table sat, perfumes then did I make Of Spicknard sweet and delicate, al for my true Loves sake: My love more sweet than Myrrhe, between my breasts doth ly, Or Camphere, that doth spring and grow in vine of Engady. How faire art thou my Love, my Dove, my Darling deare, Thine eies most like unto the Doves, in sight to me appeare. Oh how exceeding faire, and seemly to be seene, The bed where we together lie, is hung with pleasant greene: The beames our house uphold, they all of Cedar be, The reaching Rafters of the same, of Fyrre, that stately tree. The second Chapter. I am the fragrant Flower, of brave vermilion hue, And Lilie in the valey low, ysprong up fresh and new: As Lillie flower excels the thorne, or litle chyer of grasse, So far my Love the Virgins all in beautie doth surpasse. Or as the barren crooked stocke unto the straightest tree, No more the sonnes unto my Love may ought compared be: To rest by his sweet side, to mee a heavenly blisse, The fruit that springeth from my Love, exceeding pleasant is. To Celler he me brings, of wine aboundant store, His love displaied over me, how can I wish for more? Fil foorth your Flagons then, whereof the fume may flie, Bring forth your cates to comfort me, ah me, for love I die. His left hand clipping close, about my necke doth hold, His right doth sweetly me imbrace, and eke my corps enfold. I charge you by the Roes and Hinds, ye Jewish daughters all, Not once to stir nor wake my Love, until she please to call. But stay, me thinks this is, mine owne Loves voice I heare, Loe, how he skips from hill to hill, loe, yon he doth appeare. My Love is like a Roe, that frisketh in the wood, Or like the strong and stately Hart, in prime and lusty blood. He closely shroudes himselfe behind our wall I see, And through the gate he dooth disclose and shew himselfe to me. And calling then, he saith, come to thine owne my Deare, For lo, the clouds are past and gone, the skies are christal cleare: The flowers in the field, so faire and freshly spring, The birds do chant with merie glee, the Turtle now doth sing: The fig-trees bear such store, that boughs with waight are bent, The Vines with blossoms do abound, which yeeld a sweet accent. Come to thine owne my deare, my Darling and my Dove, Leave thou the place of thine abode, come to thine own true love: Let me behold thy face, most pleasant to the sight, And heare my best beloveds voice, that most doth me delight. Destroy the subtil Fox, that doth the grapes devoure, For loe, behold, the time is come, the vines do bud and floure. My Love to me is true, and I likewise his owne, Which in the Lilles takes repast, himselfe even all alone: Until the day doth spring, or shadowes fade away, Be as a Roe or like the Harts, which on the mountaines play. The third Chapter. By night within my bed, I romed here and there, But al in vain, I could not find my Love and friendly Fere. Then straight waies up I rose, and searching every street Throughout the city far and neer, but him I could not meete. The watchmen found me tho, to whom I then can say, Have ye not seen mine owne true Love, of late come this a way: Then passing them, I found my Love I long had sought, And to my mothers chamber then, my darling have I brought. I charge you by the Roes and Hinds, this vow to me you make, Ye Jewish daughters, not to call my Love till she doe wake. Who's that which doth from wildernes, in mighty smoke appeare, Like the perfumes of odors sweet, which Merchants hold so dear. About the bed of Salomon, behold, there is a band Of threescore valiant Israelites, which al in armour stand, All expert men of war, with sword stil ready prest, Least foes in night time should approch, when men suspect them least: King Salomon hath made of Liban tree so sure, A Pallace brave, whose pillers strong are al of silver pure: The pavement beaten gold, the hangings purple graine, The daughters of Jerusalem with joy to entertaine. Ye Sion daughters, see, where Salomon is set In Royall throan, and on his head, the princely Coronet, Wherewith his mother first, adorn'd him (as they say) When he in mariage linked was, even on his wedding day. The fourth Chapter. Behold, thou art al faire my Love, my hearts delight, Thine eies so lovely like the Doves, appear to me in sight, Thy haire surpassing faire and seemely to the eie, Like to a goodly heard of Goates, on Gilead mountaine hie. Thy teeth like new washt sheep, returning from the flood, Whereas not one is barren found, but beareth twinnes so good. Thy lips like scarlet thred, thy talke dooth breed delight, Thy temples like pomgranet faire doth shew to me in sight. Thy necke like Davids Tower, which for defence doth stand, Wherein the shieldes and targets be, of men of mightie hand. Thy brests like twinned Roes, in prime and youthfull age, Which feed among the Lillies sweet, their hunger to asswage. Until the day doe spring, and night be banisht hence: I will ascend into the mount of Myrrhe and Frankensence. Thou art all faire my Love, most seemly eke to see, From head to foot, from top to toe, there is no spot in thee. Come downe from Libanon, from Libanon above, And from Amanahs mountain hie, come to thine own true love. From Shevers stately top, from Hermon hil so hie, From Lions dens &amp; from the cliffes, where lurking Leopards lie. My Spouse and sister deare, thy love hath wounded me, Thy lovely eie and seemly neck, hath made me yeeld to thee. Thy love far better is, than any wine to me, Thy odors sweet doth far surpasse, the smell where spices be. Thy lips like hony combe, under thy tongue doth lie The honey sweet: thy garments smel, like Libanon on hie. My Spouse a garden is, fast under locke and kay, Or like a Fountaine closely kept, where sealed is the way. Like to a pleasant plot I may thee well compare, Where Camphere, Spicknard, dainty fruits, with sweet Pomgranets are. Even Spicknard, Saffron, Calamus &amp; Synamon do growe, With Incense, Myrrhe and Alloes, with many spices moe. Oh Fountaine passing pure, oh Well of life most deare. Oh Spring of loftie Libanon, of water christal cleare. Ye North and Southern winds upon my garden blow, That the sweet spice that is therein, on every side may flow. Unto his garden place, my Love for his repast Shall walke, and of the fruites therein, shal take a pleasant tast. The fift Chapter. Within my garden plot, loe, I am present now, I gathered have the Myrrhe &amp; spice, that in aboundance growe: With honey, milke and wine, I have refresht me here. Eat, drink my friends, be mery there, with harty friendly cheare. Although in slumbering sleepe, it seemes to you I lay, Yet heare I my beloved knock, me thinks I heare him say, Open to me the gate my Love, my hearts delight, For loe, my locks are all bedewed with drizling drops of night. My garments are put off, then may I not doo so, Shal I defile my feet I washt, so white as any snow. Then fast even by the dore to me he shew'd his hand, My heart was then enamoured, when as I saw him stand. Then straight waies up I rose, to ope the dore with speed, My handes and fingers dropped Myrrhe, upon the bar indeed. Then opened I the dore, unto my Love at last, But all in vaine, for why? before, my Love was gone and past. There sought I for my love, then could I crie and call, But him I could not find, nor he, nould answer me at all. The watchmen found me then, as thus I walk'd astray, They wounded me, and from my head, my vaile they took away. Ye daughters of Jerusalem, if ye my Love doo see, Tell him that I am sicke for love, yea, tel him this from me. Thou peerelesse Gem of price, I pray thee to us tell, What is thy Love, what may he be, that doth so far excell? In my beloveds face, the Rose and Lilly strive, Among ten thousand men not one, is found so faire alive. His head like finest gold, with secret sweet perfume, His curled locks hang all as black, as any Ravens plume. His eies be like to Doves, on Rivers banks below, Ywasht with milk, whose collours are, most gallant to the show. His cheeks like to a plot, where spice and flowers growe, His lips like to the Lilly white, from whence pure Myrrh doth flow, His hands like rings of gold, with costly Chrisalet, His belly like the Yvory white, with seemly Saphyrs set. His legs like Pillers strong, of Marble set in gold, His countenance like Libanon, or Cedars to behold. His mouth it is as sweet, yea, sweet as sweet may be, This is my Love, ye Virgins loe, even such a one is he. Thou fairest of us al, whether is thy Lover gone, Tel us, and we will goe with thee, thou shalt not goe alone. The sixt Chapter. Downe to his garden place, mine own true Love is gone, Among the Spice and Lillies sweet, to walke himselfe alone. True am I to my Love, and he my loving make, Which in the Lillies makes abode, and doth his pleasure take, With Tirzah or Jerusalem, thy beautie may be waide, In shew like to an Armie great, whose Ensignes are displaid. Oh turne away thine eies, for they have wounded me, Thy haires are like a heard of Goats, on Gilead mount that be, Thy teeth like new washt sheep, returning from the flood, Whereas not one is barren found, but beareth twins a good, The temples of thy head, within thy locks to showe, Are like to the Pomgranet fruit, that in the Orchards grow. Of Concubines four score there are, of Queens twice treble ten, Of Virgins for the multitude, not to be numbred then. But yet my Dove alone, and undefiled Fere, Her mothers only daughter is, to her exceeding deare. The Virgins saw my Love, and they have lik'd her well, The Queens and eke the Concubines, they say she doth excell. Who's she I doo behold, so like the morning cleare, Or like the Moon, when towards the ful, in pride she doth appear, Bright as the radiant raies, that from the Sun descend, Or like an Army terrible, when Ensignes they extend. Unto the nuts downe will I goe, and fruitfull valeyes lowe, To see if that the Vine doo bud, and the Pomgranets growe. My selfe I know not I, ne nothing knew I then, Let me be like a chariot, even of thy noble men. Return againe, oh make returne, thou Shulamite so deare, Let us enjoy thy company, I pray thee sojorne here. What see you in the Shulamite, in her what may you see, But like a troupe of warlike men that in the armies be. The seventh Chapter. How stately are thy steps with brave and lofty pace, Thou daintie princesse, darling deare, with comely gallant grace. The joints of thy fair thighs, the which so straight do stand, Are like to curious jewels wrought, by cunning workmans hand. Thy navell like a goblet is, which stil with wine doth flowe, Thy belly like an heape of wheat, about which, Lillies growe. Thy breasts I may compare like to two litle Roes, Which follow on their mothers steps, when forth to feed she goes. Thy necke like to a Tower, of costly Ivory fram'd, Thine eies like Heshbon waters clear, by that Bathrabbin nam'd. Thy nose like Libanon Tower, most seemly to the eie, Which towards Damascus citie faire, that stately town doth ly. Thy head like Scarlet red, thy haire of purple hue, The King in thee doth take delight, as in his Lady true. How faire art thou my Love, and seemly to the sight, The pleasures that abound in thee, they are my chiefe delight: Thy stature like the Palme, the tall and straightest tree, Thy brests, the which do thee adorne, most like to clusters be. Upon the pleasant palme, I said I wil take holde, And rest upon her pleasant boughes, I said I wil be bolde. Thy breasts are like a bunch of grapes, on the most fruitful vine, Thy nose in smel like to the fruit, of al most pure and fine. The roofe of thy sweet mouth, like purest wine doth tast, Which makes the very aged lagh, forgetting sorrowes past. I am unto my Love, a faithfull friendly Fere, And he is likewise unto me, most tender and most deare. Goe we into the field, to sport us in the plaine, And in the pleasant villages (my Love) let us remaine. Then early will we rise and see, if that the vine do flourish, And if the earth accordingly do the Pomgranets nourish. I feele the Mandrakes smell, within our gates that be: The sweetest things both new &amp; olde (my Love) I kept for thee. The eight Chapter. Oh that thou weart my brother borne, that suckt my mothers breast: Then sweetly would I kisse thy lippes, and by thee take my rest. Unto my mothers closet sure, mine own Love will I bring, And be obedient unto him in every kind of thing. There wil I give to thee (my Love) the daintie spiced wine, And pleasant liquor that distils from the Pomgranet fine. With his left hand he shal support, and eke my head upreare, And with the right most lovingly he shal imbrace his deare. Ye daughters of Jerusalem, doo not my Love disease, But suffer her to take her rest, so long as she shall please. Who's that which from the wildernes, yon commeth from above, And in this sort familiarly dooth leane upon her Love: Under a pleasant aple tree, from whence like fruit doth spring, Thy mother first conceived thee, even forth which did thee bring. Let it be like a privie seale, within thy secret heart, Or like a Signet on thy hand, thy secrets to impart: For jealousie is like the grave, and love more strong than death, From whose hot brands ther doth proceed a flaming fiery breath: The flouds cannot alay his heat, nor water quench his flame, Neither the greatest treasure, can countervaile the same. Our litle sister hath no breasts, what shal we doo or say, When we shal give her to her Spouse, upon her wedding day? If that she be a wall, on that foundation sure, A princely pallace wil we build, of silver passing pure. And if she be a doore, she shall inclosed be With brave and goodly squared boords, of the fine Cedar tree. I am a mightie wall, my breasts like Towers hie, Then am I passing beautifull in my beloveds eie. King Salomon a vinyard had, in faire Baalhamon field, Each one in silver yeerely dooth, a thousand peeces yeeld, But yet my vineyard (Salomon) thy vine doth far excell, For fruit and goodnes of the same, thou know'st it very wel. A thousand silver peeces are, even yearely due to me, Two thousand likewise unto them, the which her keepers be. Oh thou that in the garden dwell'st, learne me thy voice to know, That I may listen to the same, as thy companions doo. Flie my beloved hence away, and be thou like the Roe, Or as the Hart on mountaine tops, wheron sweet spices growe. THE SONG OF ANNAH, for the bringing foorth of Samuel her sonne. The second Chap. of the first booke of Samuel. My heart doth in the Lord rejoice, that living Lord of might, Which doth his servants horn exalt, in al his peoples sight. I wil rejoice in their despight, which erst have me abhord, Because that my salvation dependeth on the Lord. None is so holie as the Lord, besides thee none htere are: With our God there is no God, that may himselfe compare. See that no more presumptuously, ye neither boast nor vaunt, Nor yet unseemly speak such things, so proud and arrogant. For why? the counsell of the Lord, in depth cannot be sought, Our enterprises and our actes, by him to passe are brought. The bowe is broke, the mightie ones subverted are at length, And they which weake and feeble were, increased are in strength: They that were ful &amp; had great store, with labor buy their bread, And they which hungrie were &amp; poore, with plenty now are fed. So that the womb which barren was, hath many children born, And she which store of children had, is left now all for orne. The Lord doth kill and make alive, his judgments all are just, He throweth downe into the grave, and raiseth from the dust. The Lord doth make both rich &amp; poore, he al our thoughts doth trie. He bringeth low &amp; eke againe, exalteth up on hie. He raiseth up the simple soule, whom men pursude with hate, To sit amongst the mightie ones, in chaire of princely state. For why? the pillers of the earth, he placed with his hand, Whose mighty strength doth stil support, the waight of al the land. He wil preserve his Saints likewise, the wicked men at length He wil confound: let no man seem, to glory in his strength. The enemies of God the Lord, shal be destroied all, From heaven he shal thunder send, that on their heads shal fall. The mightie Lord shall judge the world, &amp; give his power alone Unto the King, and shal exalt his owne annointed one. THE SONG OF JONAH IN THE WHALES BELLIE. In the second Chap. of Jonah. In griefe and anguish of my heart, my voice I did extend, Unto the Lord, and he therto, a willing eare did lend: Even from the deep and darkest pit, &amp; the infernall lake, To me he hath bow'd down his eare, for his great mercies sake. For thou into the middest, of surging seas so deepe Hast cast me foorth: whose bottom is, so low &amp; woondrous steep. Whose mighty wallowing waves, which from the floods do flow, Have with their power up swallowed me, &amp; overwhelm'd me tho. Then said I, loe, I am exilde, from presence of thy face, Yet wil I once againe behold, thy house and dwelling place. The waters have encompast me, the floods inclosde me round, The weeds have sore encombred me, which in the seas abound. Unto the valeyes down I went, beneath the hils which stand, The earth hath there environ'd me, with force of al the land. Yet hast thou stil preserved me, from al these dangers here, And brought my life out of the pit, oh Lord my God so deare. My soule consuming thus with care, I praied unto the Lord, And he from out his holie place, heard me with one accord. Who to vain lieng vanities doth whollie him betake, Doth erre also, Gods mercie he, doth utterly forsake. But I wil offer unto him the sacrifice of praise, And pay my vowes, ascribing thanks unto the Lord alwaies. THE PRAIER OF JEREMIAH, bewailing the captivitie of the people. In the fift Chap. of his Lamentations. Cal unto mind oh mightie Lord, the wrongs we daily take, Consider and behold the same, for thy great mercies sake. Our lands &amp; our inheritance, meere strangers do possesse, The alients in our houses dwel, and we without redresse. We now (alas) are fatherlesse, &amp; stil pursude with hate, Our mourning mothers nowe remaine in wofull widdowes state. We buy the water which we drink, such is our grievous want, Likewise the wood even for our use, that we our selves did plant. Our neckes are subject to the yoke, of persecutions thrall, We wearied out with cruell toile, and find no rest at all: Afore time we in Egypt land, and in Assyria served, For food our hunger to sustaine, least that we should have sterved: Our fathers which are dead &amp; gone, have sinned wondrous sore, And we now scourg'd for their offence, ah, woe are we therefore. Those servile slaves which bondmen be, of them in fear we stand, Yet no man doth deliver us, from cruel Caitives hand. Our livings we are forc'd to get, in perils of our lives, The drie and barren wildernesse therto by danger drives. Our skins be scortcht as though they had, bin in an oven dride, With famine, and the penury, which here we doo abide. Our wives and maides defloured are, by violence and force, On Sion, and in Juda land, sans pity or remorce. Our kings by cruel enimies, with cordes are hanged up, Our gravest, sage and ancient men, have tasted of that cup. Our yoong men they have put to sword, not one at al they spare, Our litle boyes upon the tree, sans pitie hanged are. Our elders sitting in the gates, can now no more be found, Our youth leave off to take delight, in musicks sacred sound. The joy and comfort of our heart, away is fled and gone, Our solace is with sorrow mixt, our mirth is turn'd to mone. Our glory now is laid full low, and buried in the ground, Our sins ful sore do burthen us, whose greatnes doth abound. Oh holy blessed Sion hill, my heart is woe for thee, Mine eies poure foorth a flood of teares, this dismal day to see, Which art destroied and now lieth wast, from sacred use &amp; trade, Thy holie place is now a den, of filthy Foxes made. But thou the everliving Lord, which doost remaine for aye, Whose seat above the firmament, full sure and still doth stay. Wherefore dost thou forsake thine owne? shal we forgotten be? Turne us good Lord, and so we shall be turned unto thee. Lord cal us home from our exile, to place of our abode, Thou long inough hast punisht us, oh Lord, now spare thy rod. THE SONG OF DEBORAH AND BARACKE. The fift Chap. of Judges. Praise ye the Lord, the which revenge on Israels wrongs doth take: Likewise for those which offered up themselves for Israels sake. Heare this, ye kings, ye princes al, give eare with one accord, I wil give thanks, yea sing the praise, of Israels living Lord. When thou departedst (Lord) from Seir, and out of Edom field, The earth gan quake, the heavens rain, the cloudes their water yeeld. The mountains hie before the Lord, have melted every del, As Synay did in presence of, the Lord of Israell. In time of Sangar, Anaths sonne, and in old Jaels daies, The paths were al unoccupied, men sought forth unknown waies. The townes &amp; cities there lay wast, and to decay they fel, Til Deborah, a matrone grave, became in Israell. They chose them gods, then garboils did, within their gates abound, A spear or shield in Israel, there was not to be found. In those which govern Israel, my heart doth take delight, And in the valiant people there, oh, praise the Lord of might. Speak ye that on white Asses ride, &amp; that by Midden dwell, And ye that daily trade the waies, see forth your minds you tell. The clattering noise of archers shot, when as the arrowes flew, Appeased was amongst the sort, which water daily drew. The righteousnesse of God the Lord, shal be declared there, And likewise Israels righteousnes, which worship him in feare. The people with rejoicing hearts, then all with one consent: I mean the Lords inheritance, unto the gates they went: Deborah up, arise and sing, a sweet and worthy song, Baracke, lead them as Captives forth, which unto thee belong. For they which at this day remaine, do rule like Lords alone, The Lord over the mightie ones, gives me dominion. The roots of Ephraim arose, gainst Amalecke to fight, And so likewise did Benjamin, with all their power and might. From Macher came a company, which chiefest sway did beare, From Zebulon, which cunning clarks, &amp; famous writers were. The kings which came of Isacher were with Deborah tho, Yea Isacher and Barack both attend on her also. He was dismounted in the vale, for the devisions sake, Of Ruben the people there, great lamentation make. Gilead by Jorden made abode, and Dan on ship boord lay, And Asher in the Desart he, upon the shore doth stay. They of Zebulon and Nepthaly, like worthy valiant wightes, Before their foes even in the field, advanc'd themselves in fight. The kings themselves in person fought: the kings of Canaan, In Tanach plaine, wheras the streame, of swift Megido ran. No pay, no hyer, ne coine at all, not one did seem to take, They served not for greedy gain, nor filthy lucre sake. The heavens hy &amp; heavenly powers, these things to passe have brought, The stars against proud Sisera, even in their course have fought. The stream of Kishons ancient brook, hath overwhelm'd them there, My soule, sith thou hast done thy part, be now of harty cheare. The hardened hooves of barbed horse, were al in peeces broke, By force of mightie men which met, with many a sturdy stroke. The Angel hath pronounc'd a curse, which shal on Meroz fall, And those that doo inhabite there, a curse light on them all. Because they put not forth their hands to help the living Lord, Against the proud and mighty ones, which have his truth abhord. Jaell the Kenit Hebers wife, most happy shal be blest, Above al other women there, which in the tents do rest. He asked water for to drink, she gave sweet milk to him, Yea butter in a lordly dish, which was full tricke and trim. Her left hand to the naile she put, her right the hammer wrought, Wherewith presumptuous Sisera unto his death she brought. And from his corps his head she cut, with mortal deadly wound, When through the temples of his head, she naild him to the ground. He bowed then unto the earth, and at her feet can fall, And where he fell there still he lay, bereav'd of sences all. The mother then of Sisera, in window where she lay, Doth marveil much that this her sonne doth make so long a stay. Her Ladies then, they hearing that, make answer by and by. Yea, to her speaches past before, her selfe doth this replie: Hath he not gotten mightie spoiles, and now division makes, Each one a Damosell hath or twaine, which he as captive takes. Sisera of costly coloured robes, ful rich, with needle wrought, Hath got a pray, which unto him, as chiefest spoiles are brought. So let thine enemies (O Lord) sustaine and suffer blame, And let thy chosen blessed ones, that love and feare thy name, Be like the Son, when in the morne, his glorie doth increase: Or like the land, which many a yeare, hath bin in rest and peace. AN OTHER SONG OF THE FAITHFULL, FOR THE MERCIES OF GOD. In the xii. Chap. of the prophesie of Isaiah. Oh living Lord, I still will laude thy name, for though thou wert offended once with me: Thy heavy wrath is turn'd from me againe, and graciously thou now doost comfort mee. Behold, the Lord is my salvation, I trust in him, and feare not any power: He is my song, the strength I leane upon, the Lord God is my loving Saviour. Therefore with joy out of the well of life, draw foorth sweet water, which it dooth affoord: And in the day of trouble and of strife, cal on the name of God the living Lord. Extol his works and woonders to the sunne, unto al people let his praise be showne: Record in song the mervails he hath done, and let his glorie through the world be blowne. Crie out aloud and shout on Sion hill, I give thee charge that this proclaimed be: The great and mightie king of Israell, now onely dwelleth in the midst of thee. A SONG OF THE FAITHFULL. In the third Chap. of the prophesie of Habacucke. Lord, at thy voice, my heart for feare hath trembled, Unto the world (Lord) let thy workes be showen: In these our daies now let thy power be knowen, And yet in wrath let mercie be remembred. From Teman loe, our God you may behold, The holie one from Paran mount so hie: His glorie hath cleane covered the Skie, And in the earth his praises be inrolde. His shining was more clearer than the light, And from his hands a fulnesse did proceed, Which did contain his wrath and power indeed. Consuming plagues and fire were in his sight. He stood aloft and compassed the land, And of the Nations doth defusion make, The mountains rent, the hilles for feare did quake, His unknown pathes no man may understand. The Morians tentes even for their wickednes, I might behold the land of Midian: Amaz'd and trembling like unto a man, Forsaken quite, and left in great distresse: What, did the rivers move the Lord to ire? Or did the floods his Majesty displease: Or was the Lord offended with the seas, That thou camest forth in chariot hot as fire. Thy force and power thou freely didst relate, Unto the tribes thy oath doth surely stand, And by thy strength thou didst devide the land, And from the earth the rivers seperate. The mountaines saw, and trembled for feare, The sturdy streame, with speed foorth passed by, The mighty depthes shout out a hideous crie, And then aloft their waves they did upreare. The Sun and Moon amid their course stood still, Thy speares and arrowes forth with shining went, Thou spoilest the land, being to anger bent, And in displeasure thou didst slay and kill. Thou wentest foorth for thine owne chosens sake, For the savegard of thine annointed one: The house of wicked men is overthrowne, And their foundations now goe all to wracke. Their townes thou strikest by thy mightie power, With their own weapons, made for their defence: Who like a whyrl-wind came with the pretence, The poore and simple man quite to devoure. Thou madest thy horse on seas to gallop fast. Upon the waves thou ridest here and there: My intrals trembled then for verie feare, And at thy voice, my lips shooke at the last. Griefe pierc'd my bones, and feare did me annoy, In time of trouble, where I might find rest: For to revenge, when once the Lord is prest, With plagues he wil the people quite destroy. The fig-tree now no more shall sprout nor flourish, The pleasant vine no more with grapes abound: No pleasure in the citie shall be found: The field no more her fruit shal feed nor nourish. The sheep shall now be taken from the fold, In stall of Bullocks there shall be no choice. Yet in the Lord my Saviour I rejoice, My hope in God yet wil I surely hold. God is my strength, the Lord my only stay, My feet for swiftnesse, it is he will make Like to the Hinds, who none in course can take: Upon high places he will make me way. A SONG OF THANKES TO GOD, in that hee sheweth himselfe Judge of the world, in punishing the wicked, and maintaining the godlie. In the xxv. Chap. of the prophesie of Isaiah. Oh Lord my God, with praise I wil persever, Thy blessed name in song I wil record: For the great wonders thou hast done O lord, Thy trueth and counsels have bene certain ever. A mightie citie thou makest ruinat. The strongest townes thou bringest to decay: A place where strangers usually do stay, And shall not be reduc'd to former state. The proudest people therefore stoupe to thee, The strongest cities have thee still in feare: Thou strengthnest the poore man in dispaire: And helpest the needie in necessitie. Thou art a sure refuge against a shower, A shadow which doth from the heat defend: The raging blasts the mighty forth doth send, Is like a storme which shakes the stateliest tower. Thou shalt abate the forraine strangers pride, Like as the heat doth drie the moistest place, The glorie of the proud thou shalt deface, Like as the cloudes the sunny beames doo hide. The Lord of hostes shal in this mount provide, And to his people here shal make a feast, Of fatted things and dainties of the best, Of Marrow and wines finely purified. And in this Mountaine by his mightie hand, That same dark cloud the Lord wil cleane destroy, Even with the vaile which doth his folke annoy. And death no more before his face shall stand. The Lord will wipe out of his chosens eies, The teares which doo their faces so distaine: And their rebuke shal now no more remaine, Thus saith the Lord, these be his promises. And men shal say (then) loe, this same is he, This is our God, on whom we did attend, This is the Lord that will us stil defend, We will be glad and joyfull (Lord) in thee. Thy hand (oh Lord) here in this mount shall rest, And cursed Moab shall by thee be beaten, As in thy judgment thou of long doost threaten, As in Mamena straw of men is thresht. And over them the Lord his hand shal holde, As he that swimmeth, stretcheth him at length, And by his power and by his mighty strength, The proud and stout by him shal be controlde. Thy highest walles and towers of all thy trust, He shall bring downe and lay them all full lowe, Unto the ground his hand shall make them bow, And lay thy pride and glorie in the dust. AN OTHER SONG OF THE FAITHFULL, wherein is declared in what consisteth the salvation of the Church. In the xxvi. Chap. of the prophesie of Isaiah. And in that day, this same shal be our song, In Juda land this shall be sung and said, We have a citie which is woondrous strong, And for the walles, the Lord himself our aid. Open the gates, yea set them open wide, And let the godly and the righteous passe: Yea let them enter, and therein abide, Which keepe his lawes, and do his trueth imbrace: And in thy judgment thou wilt sure preserve, In perfect peace those which doo trust in thee: Trust in the Lord, which dooth all trust deserve, He is thy strength, and none but onelie he. He will bring downe the proud that looke so hie, The stateliest buildings he wil soone abase: And make them even with the ground to lie, And unto dust he will their pride deface. It shall be troden to the verie ground, The poore and needy downe the same shal tread: The just mans way in righteousnes is found, Into a path most plaine thou wilt him lead. But we have waited long for thee, oh Lord And in thy way of judgment we do rest: Our soules doth joy thy name still to record, And thy remembrance doth content us best. My soule hath long'd for thee (oh Lord) by night, And in the morn my spirit for thee hath sought: Thy judgments to the earth give such a light, As al the world by them thy trueth is taught. But shew thy mercie to the wicked man, He wil not learne thy righteousnes, to know, His chiefe delight is still to curse and ban, And unto thee, himselfe he will not bow. They doo not once at all regard thy power, Thy peoples zeale shall let them see their shame, But with a fire thou shalt thy foes devoure, And cleane consume them with a burning flame. With peace thou wilt preserve us (Lord) alone, For thou hast wrought great woonders for our sake And other Gods beside thee have we none: Only in thee we all our comfort take. The dead and such as sleep within the grave, Shal give no glorie, nor yeeld praise to thee: Which here on earth no place nor being have, And thou hast rooted out of memorie. Oh Lord thou doost this nation multiply, Thou Lord hast blest this nation with increase: Thou art most glorious in thy majesty, Thou hast inlarg'd the earth with perfect peace. We cride to thee, and oft our hands did wring, When we have seen thee bent to punishment. Like to a woman in childbyrth traveiling, Even so in paine we mourne and doo lament. We have conceiv'd and laboured with paine, But only wind at last we forth have brought: Upon the earth no hope there doth remaine, The wicked world likewise availes us nought. The dead shal live, and such as sleep in grave With their own bodies once shal rise againe: Sing ye, that in the dust your dwelling have, The earth no more her bodies shall retaine. Come, come my people to my chamber here, And shut the doores up surely after thee: Hide thou thy selfe, and doo not once appeare, Nor let thine eies mine indignation see. For from above the Lord is now dispos'd To scourge the sinnes that in the world remaine: His servants blood in earth shal be disclosde, And she shal now yeeld up her people slaine. Finis. HEREAFTER FOLLOWE CERTAIN OTHER SONGS AND PRAIERS of godly men and women, out of the Bookes of Apocripha. THE PRAIER OF JUDITH, FOR THE DELIVERANCE OF THE PEOPLE. In the ix. Chap. of the book of Judith. Oh Lord, the God of Simeon, my soveraigne Father deare: To whom thou gavest strength and might, the sword in hand to beare, To take revenge on those which first, the maidens wombe did tame, And spoiled her virginitie, with great reproch and shame. For which offence, thou gavest up, their princes to be slaine, So that their wounds with gory blood, their beds did all distain. Their servants with their lords ech one, have felt thy wrath alike, Who sitting in their roial seat, thou sparest not to strike. Their wives, their daughters, &amp; their goods, thou gav'st for thy behove As prais, as captives, &amp; as spoiles, to those whom thou didst love. Who moov'd with zeale, could not abide, their blood defil'd to see, Then heare me Lord, a widow poore, which here do cal to thee. Things past, &amp; things not yet discern'd, thy providence hath wrought, Things present &amp; the things to come, by thee to passe are brought. Each thing is present at thy call, thy wisdome doth devise, Thy secret judgments long before, thy knowledge doth comprise. Th'Assirians now in multitude, a mighty number are, Whose horsmen on their barbed horse, themselves to war prepare. Their hope in footmen doth consist, in sling, in speare and shield, They know not thee to be the Lord, whose force doth win the field. Let all their force, their strength &amp; power, be by thy might abated, Who vow thy Temple to defile, which thou hast consecrated. Yea, to pollute thy Tabernacle, thy house and holy place, And with their instruments of war, thine Altars to deface. Behold their pride, and poure on them, thy wrath and heavy yre, And strength my hand to execute, the thing I now desire. Smite thou the servant and the Lord, as they together stand, Abate their glory and their pride, even by a womans hand. For in the greatest multitude, thou takest not delight, Nor in the strong and valiant men consisteth not thy might. But to the humble, lowly, meeke, the succourlesse and poore, Thou art a help, defence, refuge, and loving saviour, My father in thy name did trust, O Israels Lord most deare, Of heaven, of earth, of sea and land, doo thou my praier heare. Grant thou me wit, sleight, power, strength, to wound them which advance Themselves over thy Sion hil, &amp; thine inheritance. Declare to nations far and neare, and let them know ful well, Thou art the Lord, whose power &amp; strength, defendeth Israell. THE SONG OF JUDITH, HAVING SLAINE HOLOPHERNES. In the xvi. Chap. of the book of Judith. Tune up the Timbrels then with laud unto the Lord, Sound foorth his praise on Simbals loud, with songs of one accord, Declare &amp; shew his praise, also his name rehearse, In song of thankes exactly pend, of sweet and noble verse. The Lord he ceaseth warres, even he the verie same, Tis he that doth appease all strife, Jehovah is his name. The which hath pitcht his tent, our surest strength and aide, Amongst us here, least that our foes, shuld make us once dismaid. From northern mountain tops, proud Assur came a downe, With warlike men a multitude, of famous high renowme. Whose footmen stopt the streams, where rivers woont to flowe, And horsmen covered all the vales, that lay the hilles belowe. His purpose was for to destroy my land, with sword and fire, To put my yongmen to the sword, did thirst with hot desire. My children to captivitie, he would have borne away, My virgins so by rape and force, as spoiles and chiefest pray, But yet the high and mighty Lord, his people doth defend, And by a silly womans hand, hath brought him to his end. For why? their mightie men, with Armes were not subdude, Nor with their blood our yoong mens hands, were not at al imbrude. No, none of Titans line, this proud Assirian slue, Nor any Gyants aid we crav'd, this souldier to subdue. But Judith she alone, Meraris daughter deere, Whose heavenly hue hath bred his baine, and brought him to his beere. She left her mourning weed, and deckt her selfe with gold, In royall robes of seemly showe, all Israell to behold. With odors she perfum'd her selfe, after the queintest guise, Her haire with fillet finely bound, as Art could wel devise. Her slippers neat and trim, his eies and fancie fed, Her beautie hath bewitcht his mind, her sword cut off his head. The Perseans were amaz'd, her modestie was such, The Medes at her bold enterprise, they marveiled as much. Amongst th'Assyrians then, great clamors can arise, When as the fact so lately done, apear'd before their eies. The sons which erst my daughters have, even on their bodies born Have slaine them as they fled in chace, as men so quite forlorne. Even at the presence of the Lord, the stoutest turn'd his backe, His power did so astonish them, that al things went to wracke. A song now let us sing, of thankes unto the Lord, Yea, in a song of pleasant tune, let us his praise record. Oh God, thou mightie Lord, who is there like to thee, In strength and power, to thee oh Lord, none may compared be. Thy creatures all obey, and serve thee in their trade, For thou no sooner spakst the word, but every thing was made. Thou sentest foorth the spirit, which did thy worke fulfill, And nothing can withstand thy voice, but listen to thy will. The mountains shal remove, wher their foundation lay, Likewise the floods, the craggy rocks, like wax shal melt away. But they that feare the Lord, and in him put their trust, Those will he love and stil impute, amongst the good and just: But woe be those that seeke, his chosen flocks decay, The Lord God wil revenge their wrongs, at the last judgement day, For he such quenchlesse fire, and gnawing wormes shal send, Into their flesh, as shal consume, them world without an end. A PRAIER OF THE AUTHOUR. In the xxiii. Chap. of Ecclesiasticus. Lord of my life, my guide and governour, Father, of thee this one thing I require, Thou wilt not leave me to the wicked power, Which seeke my fall, and stil my death desire. Oh, who is he that shall instruct my thought, And so with wisdom shall inspire my heart: In ignorance that nothing may be wrought By me with them whose sinne shall not depart. Least that mine errors growe and multiplie, And to destruction through my sinnes I fall: My foes rejoice at my adversitie, Who in thy mercie have no hope at all. My Lord and God, from whom my life I tooke, Unto the wicked leave me not a pray: A haughty mind, a proud disdainfull looke, From me thy Servant take thou cleane away. Vaine hope likewise, with vile concupiscence, Lord of thy mercie take thou cleane from me: Retaine thou him in true obedience, Who with desire daily serveth thee. Let not desire to please the greedy mawe, Or appetite of any fleshly lust: Thy servant from his loving Lord withdraw, But give thou me a mind both good and just. THE PRAIER OF SALOMON. In the ix. Chap. of the book of Wisdome. Oh God of our forefathers all, of mercie thou the Lord: Which heaven and earth, and al thinges els, createdst with thy word. And by thy wisdome madest man, like to thy selfe alone, And gavest him over thy workes, the chiefe dominion. That he shoud rule upon the earth, with equity and right, And that his judgments should be pure, and upright in thy sight. Give me that wisdome, which about, thy sacred throne doth stay, And from amongst thine own elect (Lord) put me not away. For I thy servant am, and of thy handmaid borne, A sillie soule, whose life alas, is short and all forlorne. And do not understand at all, what ought to be my guide, I mean thy statutes and thy lawes, least that I slip aside. For though a man in worldly things, for wisdome be esteem'd, Yet if thy wisdom want in him, his, is but folly deem'd. Thou chosest me to be a King, to sit on royall throne, To judge the folk which thou of right, dost chalenge for thy own. Thou hast commanded me to build, a Temple on thy hill, And Altar in the self same place, where thou thy selfe doost dwel. Even like unto thy Tabernacle, in each kind of respect, A thing most holy, which at first, thy selfe thou didst erect. Thy wisdome being stil with thee, which understands thy trade, When as thou framedst first the world, and her foundation laid. Which knew the thing that most of all, was pleasant in thy sight, Thy wil and thy commandements, wherein thou takst delight. Send her down from that heavenly seat, wheras she doth abide, That she may shew to me thy will, and be my onely guide. For she dooth know and understand, yea, al things doth foresee, And by her works and mighty power, I shall preserved bee. Then shal my works accepted be, and liked in thy sight, When I upon my fathers throne, shall judge thy folke aright. Who knoweth the counsell of the Lord, his deep and secret skil, Or who may search into his works, or know his holy will? For why? the thoughts of mortal men, are nothing els but care, Their forecasts and devises all, things most uncertaine are. The bodie is unto the soule, a waight and burthen great, The earthly house depresseth down, the mind with cares repleat. Salomons The things which here on earth remain, we hardly can discern, Praier To find their secret use and trade, with labor great we learne. For who doth search or seek to know, with traveill &amp; with care, The secrets of the mightie Lord, which hie in heaven are. Who can thy counsels understand, except thou doo impart Thy wisdome, and thy holy spirit doost send into his heart? For so the waies of mortal men, reformed are and taught, The things that most delighteth thee, which wisdom forth have brought. A SONG OF JHESUS THE SONNE OF SIRACH. In the last Chap. of Ecclesiasticus. I will confesse thy name O Lord, And give thee praise with one accord: My God, my King, and Saviour, Unto thy name be thankes and power. I have bene succoured by thee, And thou hast still preserved me: And from destruction kept me long, And from report of slaunderous tongue. From lips stil exercisde with lies, And from my cruell enemies, Thou me in mercie doost deliver, Thy blessed name be praisde for ever. From monsters, that would me devoure, From cruell tyrants, and their power: In all affliction paine and griefe, Thou succourest me with some reliefe. From the cruell burning flame, Poore I inclosde within the same: From the deepe infernall pit, From venom'd tongues that poison spit. From speeches that of malice spring, From accusation to the king, From all reproch and infamy, From slander, and like villanie. My soule, to death praise thou the Lord, And laud his name with one accord: For death was readie thee to take, And thou neare the infernall lake. They compassed me round about, But there was none to helpe me out: I look'd when succour would appeare, But there was none that would come neare. Upon thy mercies then I thought, And on the wonders thou hast wrought: How from destruction thou doost save, Such as in thee affiance have. In praier then I did persever, That thou from death wouldst me deliver: Unto the Lord I crie and call, That he would rid me out of thrall: Therefore I still will praise thy name, And ever thanke thee for the same: My praiers shall of thee be heard, And never from thy eares debard. Thou sav'st me from destruction, And other mischiefs more than one: Therefore wil I praise thee O Lord, And in my songs thy name record. THE PRAIER OF HESTER, for the deliverance of her and her people. In the xiiii. Chap. of Hester. O mighty Lord, thou art our God, to thee for aid I crie, To help a woman desolate, sith danger now is nie: Even from my youth I oft have hard my predecessors tel, That from amongst the nations all thou chosest Israell. And chosest those our fathers were, from theirs that went before To be thine owne and hast perform'd, thy promise evermore. Now Lord we have committed sin, most grievous in thine eies, Wherfore thou hast delivered us, unto our enemies. Because that to their heathen gods, with worship we have gone, Knowing that thou art God the Lord, the righteous Lord alone. Yet not content, nor satisfied, with these our captives bands, But with their Idols they themselves, have join'd &amp; shaken hands Quite to abolish and subvert, what thou appointed hast, And this thine owne inheritance even utterly to waste. To shut and stop the mouthes of those, that yeeld thee thanks and praise, Thy glorious temples to defile, thine Altars up to raise: And to induce the heathen folke, to laud their Idols might, To magnifie a fleshly King, a man, a mortall wight. Then let not such the Scepter sway, whose glorie is of nought, Least they deride us when that we, to miserie are brought. And those devises they have wrought, t'intangle us withall, May turne unto their owne decay, and on their heads may fall. Remember Lord, and shew thy selfe, to us in time of need, And strengthen me thou King of kings, &amp; Lord of power indeed. Instruct my tongue with eloquence, my speaches to impart. Before the Lions face, and by, thy wisdome turne his heart, To hate our deadly enemie, so wholly bent to ill, Destroy him, and al such as doo consent unto his will. But let thy hand deliver us, and help and succour me, Sith I am now left comfortlesse, and have no help but thee. Thou know'st right well all things O Lord, &amp; this thou knowest then, I hate the glory and the pompe, of wicked sinful men, And utterly detest the bed, of any heathen wight, Uncircumcised, most unpure, and odious in thy sight: Thou knowest my necessitie, and that with hate I beare This token of preheminence, which on my head I weare. And as a filthy menstruous cloath, I take thereof such shame, As being by my selfe alone, I never weare the same. And that at Hamans table yet, thy handmaid hath not fed, Nor tooke delight in princes feast, nor drank wine offered, And never joi'd in any thing, since first I hether came, Until this day but in the Lord thou God of Abraham. Oh thou the high and mightie God, heare thou the voice &amp; crie Of them, whose hope, whose trust and stay, only on thee doth lie. And now in need deliver us, out of their cruell hand, And from the dread and feare O Lord, wherin we dayly stand. THE PRAIER OF MARDOCHEUS. In the xiii. Chap. of Hester. Oh Lord, my Lord, that art the King of might, Within whose power all thinges their being have: Who may withstand that liveth in thy sight, If thou thy chosen Israell wilt save. For thou hast made the earth and heaven above, And al things els that in the same do moove. Thou madest all things, and they are all thine own, And there is none that may resist thy will: Thou know'st all things, and this of thee is knowne, I did not erst for malice nor for ill, Presumption nor vaine glorie els at all, Come nor bow downe unto proud Hamans call. I could have bin content for Israels sake, To kisse the soles even of his verie feet: But that I would not mans vaine honor take, Before Gods glorie, being so unmeet. And would not worship none (O Lord) but thee: And not of pride, as thou thy selfe doost see. Therefore (oh Lord) my God, and heavenly king Have mercie on the people thou hast bought: For they imagine and devise the thing, How to destroy and bring us unto nought. Thine heritance, which thou so long hast fed, And out so far from Egypt land hast led. Oh heare my praier, and mercie doe extend, Upon thy portion of inheritance, For sorrowe now some joy and solace send, That we may live thy glorie to advance. And suffer not their mouthes shut up oh Lord, Which stil thy name with praises doo record. A PRAIER IN THE PERSON OF THE FAITHFULL. The xxxvi. Chap. of Ecclesiasticus. Have mercie on us blessed Lord, Which madest all thinges with thy word: Behold us Saviour from above, Illuminate us with thy love. And let the wicked dread thy name, Which never sought unto the same: And knowe that thou art God alone, And like (in woonders) to be none. Oh Lord lift up thy mightie hand, The world thy power shall understand: As by us thou art sanctified, By them so be thou magnified. That they may learne thy power to knowe, As we that be thy servantes doo, Thou art the living Lord alone, And other Goddes besides thee none. Renew the signes (Lord) thou hast showne, And let thy woonderous woorks be knowne: Declare the strength of thy right hand, Let them thy power understand. Arise to judgment in thine yre, Poure out thy wrath as hot as fire: Destroy the cruell adversarie, To spoile our foes (Lord) doo not tarie. Shorten thou these wicked daies, Thinke on thine oath at all assaies: Let thy woonders (Lord) appeare. And be thou praised farre and neare. In burning fire (Lord) let them die, Which doe escape, and seek to flie: And let them perish with annoy, Which seeke thy people to destroy. Cleave thou the heads of mighty kings, Our enemies in godly things: And let the world behold and see, That we are chosen unto thee. Lord, gather Jacob unto thee, That they thy might &amp; power may see: That they thy wondrous works may show And to be thine themselves may know. Unto thy folke impute no blame, Which ever cald upon thy name: To Israel Lord be thou milde, Thy only heir thy first borne child. Unto Jerusalem shew pitie, Thy sanctuarie and thy citie: Blesse Sion where thy prophets live, Thy glorie to thy people give. And be thou witnesse unto those, Which have bene thine still to dispose: And raise them up oh Lord, on hie, Which in thy name doo prophesie. Reward them (Lord) that waite for thee, That they thy Prophets trueth may see: Heare thou thy servants praier oh Lord, As thou to Aaron gavest thy word. Guide us in way of righteousnesse, The earth thy glorie shall expresse: And to the world it shall be knowne: Thou are eternall and alone. A PRAIER OF TOBIAS, EXHORTING ALL MEN TO PRAISE THE LORD. Tobias. Chap. xiii. Bless'd be that king which evermore shal raign, So ever may his kingdome blessed be: Which punisheth and pittieth againe, Which sends to hell, and likewise setteth free. Before whose presence may no creature stand, Nor any thing avoid his heavie hand. Ye children of his chosen Israell, Before the Gentles stil confesse his name: With whom he hath appointed you to dwell, Even there (I say) extol and laude his fame: He is a Lord and God most gracious, And still hath bene a father unto us. He wil scourge us for our iniquitie, Yet mercie will he take on us againe, And from those nations gathered shall we be, With whom as strangers now we do remaine. Yf in your harts he shal repentance find, And turne to him with zeale and willing mind. When as your dealings shall be found upright, Then wil he turn his face from you no more: Nor thenceforth hide his presence from your sight, But lend his mercie, then laid up in store, Therefore confesse his name, &amp; praises sing, To that most great and highest heavenly King. I will confesse him in captivitie, And to a wicked people shewe his might, Oh turne to him, vile sinners that you be, And doo the thing is upright in his sight. Who's there can tell if he will mercie showe, Or take compassion on you, yea or noe? I will extoll and laude thy name alwaies, My soule, the praise of heavens King expresse: All tongues on earth shall spread abroad his praise, All nations shew foorth his righteousnesse. Jerusalem thou shalt be scourged then, But he wil spare the sonnes of righteous men. Faile not to give the Lord his praises due, And still extoll that everlasting King: And help to build his Tabernacle newe, In which his Saints shall ever sit and sing. In which the captives shall have end of griefe, In which the poore shall ever find reliefe. Many shall come from countries far and neare, And shall great giftes unto his presence bring, Many before his presence shall appeare, And shal rejoice in this great heavenly King, Cursed be those which hate thy blessed name, But bless'd be those which love &amp; like the same. Triumph with joy, ye that be good and just, Though scattered now, yet shall you gathered be: Then in the Lord fix all your hope and trust, And rest in peace till you these blessings see. Blessed be those which have bin touch'd with griefe When they have seen thee scourg'd, &amp; want reliefe. Those only shall rejoice with thee againe, And those shall be partakers of thy glorie: And shall in blisse for ay with thee remaine, Now passed once these troubles transitorie. Then (oh my soule) see thou rejoice and sing, And laud the great and highest hevenly King. And he will build Jerusalem full faire, With Emeralds and Saphyrs of great price, With precious stones he will her walles repaire, Her towers of golde with worke of rare device. And all her streetes with Berall will he pave, With Carbunckles and Ophirs passing brave. And all her people there, shall sit and say, Praised be God with Aleluiah. FINIS. IDEA THE SHEPHEARDS GARLAND, Fashioned in nine Eglogs. ROWLANDS SACRIFICE to the nine Muses. Effugiunt auidos Carmina sola rogos. TO THE NOBLE, AND VALEROUS GENTLEMAN, MASTER ROBERT DUDLEY: ENRICHED WITH ALL VERTUES OF THE MINDE, AND WORTHY OF ALL HONORABLE DESERT. Your most affectionate, and devoted, Michael Drayton. THE FIRST EGLOG. When as the joyfull spring When as the joyfull spring brings in the Summers sweete reliefe: Poore Rowland malcontent bewayles the winter of his griefe. Now Phœbus from the equinoctiall Zone, Had task'd his teame unto the higher spheare, And from the brightnes of his glorious throne, Sends forth his Beames to light the lower ayre, The cheerfull welkin, comen this long look'd hower, Distils adowne full many a silver shower. Fayre Philomel night-musicke of the spring, Sweetly recordes her tunefull harmony, And with deepe sobbes, and dolefull sorrowing, Before fayre Cinthya actes her Tragedy: The Throstlecock, by breaking of the day, Chants to his sweete, full many a lovely lay. The crawling snake, against the morning sunne, Now streaks him in his rayn-bow coloured cote: The darkesome shades, as loathsome he doth shunne, Inchanted with the Birds sweete silvan note: The Buck forsakes the launds where he hath fed, And scornes the hunt should view his velvet head. Through all the partes, dispersed is the blood, The lustie spring, in flower of all her pride, Man, bird, and beast, and fish, in pleasant flood, Rejoycing all in this most joyfull tide: Save Rowland leaning on a Ranpick tree, O'r growne with age, forlorne with woe was he. Oh blessed Pan, thou shepheards god sayth he, O thou Creator of the starrie light, Whose wonderous workes shew thy divinitie, Thou wise inventor of the day and night, Refreshing nature with the lovely spring, Quite blemisht erst, with stormy winters sting. O thou strong builder of the firmament, Who placedst Phœbus in his fierie Carre, And by thy mighty Godhead didst invent, The planets mansions that they should not jarre, Ordeyning Phebe, mistresse of the night, From Tytans flame to steale her forked light. Even from the cleerest christall shining throne, Under whose feete the heavens are low abased, Commaunding in thy majestie alone, Whereas the fiery Cherubines are placed: Receive my vowes as incense unto thee, My tribute due to thy eternitie. O shepheards soveraigne, yea receive in gree, The gushing teares, from never-resting eyes, And let those prayers which I shall make to thee, Be in thy sight perfumed sacrifice: Let smokie sighes be pledges of contrition, For follies past to make my soules submission. Submission makes amends for all my misse, Contrition a refined life begins, Then sacred sighes, what thing more precious is? And prayers be oblations for my sinnes, Repentant teares, from heaven-beholding eyes, Ascend the ayre, and penetrate the skies. My sorowes waxe, my joyes are in the wayning, My hope decayes, and my despayre is springing, My love hath losse, and my disgrace hath gayning, Wrong rules, desert with teares her hands sits wringing: Sorrow, despayre, disgrace, and wrong, doe thwart My Joy, my love, my hope, and my desert. Devouring time shall swallow up my sorrowes, And strong beliefe shall torture black despaire, Death shall orewhelme disgrace, in deepest furrowes, And Justice laie my wrongs upon the Beere: Thus Justice, death, beleefe, and time, ere long, Shall end my woes, despayre, disgrace, and wrong. Yet time shall be expir'd and lose his date, And full assurance cancell strongest trust, Eternitie shall trample on deathes pate, And Justice shall surcease when all be just: Thus time, beleefe, death, Justice, shall surcease, By date, assurance, eternity, and peace. Thus breathing from the Center of his soule, The tragick accents of his extasie, His sun-set eyes gan here and there to roule, Like one surprisde with sodaine lunacie: And being rouzde out of melancholly, Flye whirle-winde thoughts unto the heavens quoth he. Now in the Ocean Tytan quencht his flame, And summond Cinthya to set up her light, The heavens with their glorious starry frame, Preparde to crowne the sable-vayled night: When Rowland from this time-consumed stock, With stone-colde hart now stalketh towards his flock. Quid queror? &amp; toto facio convicia cœlo: Di quoque habent oculos, di quoque pectus habent. THE SECOND EGLOG. Wynken of mans frayle wayning age Wynken of mans frayle wayning age declares the simple truth, And doth by Rowlands harmes reproove Mottos unbrideled youth. Motto. Might my youths mirth delight thy aged yeeres, My gentle shepheard father of us all, Wherewith I whylome Joy'd my lovely feeres, Chanting sweete straines of heavenly pastorall. Now would I tune my miskins on this Greene, And frame my muse those vertues to unfold, Of that sole Phenix Bird, my lives sole Queene: Whose locks done staine, the three times burnisht gold. But melancholie grafted in thy Braine, My Rimes seeme harsh, to thy unrelisht taste, Thy droughthy wits, not long refresht with raigne, Parched with heat, done wither now and waste. Wynken. Indeed my Boy, my wits been all forlorne, My flowers decayd, with winter-withered frost, My clowdy set eclips'd my cherefull morne, That Jewell gone wherein I joyed most. My dreadful thoughts been drawen upon my face, In blotted lines with ages iron pen, The lothlie morpheu saffroned the place, Where beuties damaske daz'd the eies of men. A cumber-world, yet in the world am left, A fruitles plot, with brambles overgrowne, Mislived man of my worlds joy bereft, Hart-breaking cares the ofspring of my mone. Those daintie straines of my well tuned reed, Which manie a time have pleasd my wanton eares, Nor sweet, nor pleasing thoughts in me done breed, But tell the follies of my wandring yeares. Those poysned pils been biding at my hart, Those loathsome drugs of my youths vanitie, Sweete seem'd they once, ful bitter now and tart, Ay me consuming corosives they be. Motto. Even so I weene, for thy olde ages fever, Deemes sweetest potions bitter as the gall, And thy colde Pallat having lost her savour, Receives no comfort in a cordiall. Wynken. As thou art now, was I a gamesome boy, Though starv'd with wintred eld as thou do'st see, And well I know thy swallow-winged joy, Shalbe forgotten as it is in me. When on the Arche of thine eclipsed eies, Time hath ingrav'd deepe characters of death, And sun-burnt age thy kindlie moisture dries, Thy wearied lungs be niggards of thy breath, Thy brawne-falne armes, thy camock-bended backe, The time-plow'd furrowes in thy fairest field, The Southsaiers of natures wofull wrack, When blooming age must stoupe to starved eld, When Lillie white is of a tawnie die, Thy fragrant crimson turn'd ash-coloured pale, Thy skin orecast with rough embroderie, And cares rude pencell, quite disgrac'd thy sale, When downe-beds heat must thawe thy frozen cold, And luke-warme brothes recure Phlebotomie, And when the bell is readie to be tol'd, To call the wormes to thine Anatomie: Remember then my boy, what once I said to thee. Now I am like the knurrie-bulked Oke, Whome wasting eld hath made a toombe of dust, Whose wind-fallen branches feld by tempest stroke, His barcke consumes with canker-wormed rust. And though thou seemst like to the bragging bryer, As gay as is the mornings Marygolde, Yet shortly shall thy sap be drie and seere, Thy gaudy Blossomes blemished with colde. Even such a wanton, an unruly swayne, Was little Rowland, when of yore as he, Upon the Beechen tree on yonder playne, Carved this rime of loves Idolatrie. The Gods delight, the heavens hie spectacle, Earths greatest glory, worlds rarest miracle. Fortunes fayr'st mistresse, vertues surest guide, Loves Governesse, and natures chiefest pride. Delights owne darling, honours cheefe defence, Chastities choyce, and wisdomes quintessence. Conceipts sole Riches, thoughts only treasure, Desires true hope, Joyes sweetest pleasure. Mercies due merite, valeurs just reward, Times fayrest fruite, fames strongest guarde. Yea she alone, next that eternall he, The expresse Image of eternitie. Motto. Oh divine love, which so aloft canst raise, And lift the minde out of this earthly mire, And do'st inspire the pen with so hie prayse, As with the heavens doth equal mans desire. Thou lightning flame of sacred Poesie, Whose furie doth incense the swelling braines, As drawes to thee by heaven-bred Sympathie, The sweete delights of highest soaring vaines: Who doth not helpe to deck thy holy Shrine, With Mirtle, and triumphant Lawrell tree? Who will not say that thou art most divine? Or who doth not confesse thy deitie? Wynken. A, foolish boy, full ill is he repayed, For now the wanton pines in endles paine, And sore repents what he before missaide, So may they be which can so lewdly faine. Now hath this yonker torne his tressed lockes, And broke his pipe which sounded erst so sweete, Forsaking his companions and their flocks, And casts his gayest garland at his feete. And being shrowded in a homely cote, And full of sorrow as a man might be, He tun'd his Rebeck with a mournfull note, And thereto sang this dolefull elegie. Tell me fayre flocke (if so you can conceave) The sodaine cause of my night-sunnes eclipse, If this be wrought me my light to bereave, By Magick spels, from some inchanting lips Or ugly Saturne from his combust sent, This fatall presage of deaths dreryment. Oh cleerest day-starre, honored of mine eyes, Yet sdaynst mine eyes should gaze upon thy light, Bright morning sunne, who with thy sweet arise, Expell'st the clouds of my harts lowring might, Goddes rejecting sweetest sacrifice, Of mine eyes teares ay offered to thine eyes. May purest heavens scorne my soules pure desires? Or holy shrines hate Pilgrims orizons? May sacred temples gaynsay sacred prayers? Or Saints refuse the poores devotions? Then Orphane thoughts with sorrow be you waind, When loves Religion shalbe thus prophayn'd. Yet needes the earth must droupe with visage sad, When silver dewes been turn'd to bitter stormes, The Cheerefull Welkin once in sables clad, Her frownes foretell poore humaine creatures harmes. And yet for all to make amends for this, The clouds sheed teares and weepen at my misse. Motto. Woe's me for him that pineth so in payne, Alas poore Rowland, how it pities me, So faire a baite should breed so foule a bayne, Or humble shewes should cover crueltie. Winken. Beware by him thou foolish wanton swayne, By others harmes thus maist thou learne to heede, Beautie and wealth been fraught with hie disdaine, Beleeve it as a Maxim of thy Creede. Motto. If that there be such woes and paines in love, Woe be to him that list the same to prove. Wynken. Yes thou shalt find, if thou desir'st to prove, There is no hell, unto the paines in love. THE THIRD EGLOG. Rowland and Perkin both I feere Rowland and Perkin both I feere, in field upon a day, With little Robin redbrests Round, doe passe the time away. Perkin. Rowland for shame awake thy drowsie muse, Time plaies the hunts-up to thy sleepie head, Why li'st thou here as thou hadst long been dead, foule idle swayne? Who ever heard thy pipe and pleasing vaine, And doth but heare this scurrill minstralcy, These noninos of filthie ribauldry, that doth not muse. Then slumber not with foule Endymion, But tune thy reede to dapper virelayes, And sing a while of blessed Betas prayse, faire Beta she: In thy sweete song so blessed may'st thou bee, For learned Collin laies his pipes to gage, And is to fayrie gone a Pilgrimage: the more our mone. Rowland. What Beta? shepheard, she is Pans belov'd, Faire Betas praise beyond our straine doth stretch, Her notes too hie for my poore pipe to reach, poore oten reede: So farre unfit to speake of worthies deede, But set my stops unto a lower kay, Whereas a horne-pipe I may safelie play, yet unreproov'd. With flatterie my muse could never fage, Nor could affect such vaine scurrility, To please lewd Lorrels, in their foolery, too base and vile: Nor but a note yet will I raise my stile, My selfe above Will Piper to advance, Which so bestirs him at the morris dance, for pennie wage. Perkin. Rowland, so toyes oft times esteemed are, And fashions ever changing with the time, Then frolick it a while in lustie rime, with mirth and glee: And let me heare that Roundelay of thee, Which once thou sangst to me in Janeveer, When Robin-redbrest sitting on a breere, the burthen bare. Rowland. Well needes I must yet with a heavie hart: But were not Beta sure I would not sing, Whose praise the ecchoes never cease to ring, unto the skies. Pirken. Be blith good Rowland then, and cleere thine eyes: And now sith Robin to his roost is gone, Good Rowland then supplie the place alone, and shew thy arte. Rowland. O thou fayre silver Thames: ô cleerest chrystall flood, Beta alone the Phenix is, of all thy watery brood, The Queene of Virgins onely she: And thou the Queene of floods shalt be: Let all thy Nymphes be joyfull then to see this happy day, Thy Beta now alone shalbe the subject of my laye. With daintie and delightsome straines of sweetest virelayes: Come lovely shepheards sit we down &amp; chant our Betas prayse: And let us sing so rare a verse, Our Betas prayses to rehearse, That little Birds shall silent be, to heare poore shepheards sing, And rivers backward bend their course, &amp; flow unto the spring. Range all thy swannes faire Thames together on a rancke, And place them duely one by one, upon thy stately banck, Then set together all agood, Recording to the silver flood, And crave the tunefull Nightingale to helpe you with her lay, The Osel &amp; the Throstlecocke, chiefe musick of our maye. O see what troups of Nimphs been sporting on the strands, And they been blessed Nimphs of peace, with Olives in their hands. How meryly the Muses sing, That all the flowry Medowes ring, And Beta sits upon the banck, in purple and in pall, And she the Queene of Muses is, and weares the Corinall. Trim up her Golden tresses with Apollos sacred tree, ô happy sight unto all those that love and honor thee, The Blessed Angels have prepar'd, A glorious Crowne for thy reward, Not such a golden Crowne as haughtie Cæsar weares, But such a glittering starry Crowne as Ariadne beares. Make her a goodly Chapilet of azur'd Colombine, And wreath about her Coronet with sweetest Eglentine: Bedeck our Beta all with Lillies, And the dayntie Daffadillies, With Roses damask, white, and red, and fairest flower delice, With Cowslips of Jerusalem, and cloves of Paradice. O thou fayre torch of heaven, the dayes most deerest light, And thou bright-shyning Cinthya, the glory of the night: You starres the eyes of heaven, And thou the glyding leven, And thou ô gorgeous Iris with all strange Colours dyed, When she streams foorth her rayes, then dasht is all your pride. See how the day stands still, admiring of her face, And time loe stretcheth foorth her armes, thy Beta to imbrace, The Syrens sing sweete layes, The Trytons sound her prayse, Goe passe on Thames and hie thee fast unto the Ocean sea, And let thy billowes there proclaime thy Betas holy-day. And water thou the blessed roote of that greene Olive tree, With whose sweete shadow, al thy bancks with peace preserved be, Lawrell for Poets and Conquerours, And mirtle for Loves Paramours: That fame may be thy fruit, the boughes preserv'd by peace, And let the mournful Cipres die, now stormes &amp; tempests cease. Wee'l straw the shore with pearle where Beta walks alone, And we wil pave her princely Bower with richest Indian stone, Perfume the ayre and make it sweete, For such a Goddesse it is meete, For if her eyes for purity contend with Tytans light, No marvaile then although they so doe dazell humaine sight. Sound out your trumpets then, from Londons stately towres, To beat the stormie windes aback &amp; calme the raging showres, Set too the Cornet and the flute, The Orpharyon and the Lute, And tune the Taber and the pipe, to the sweet violons, And move the thunder in the ayre, with lowdest Clarions. Beta long may thine Altars smoke, with yeerely sacrifice, And long thy sacred Temples may their Saboths solemnize, Thy shepheards watch by day and night, Thy Mayds attend the holy light, And thy large empyre stretch her armes from east unto the west, And thou under thy feet mayst tread, that foule seven-headed beast. Perken. Thanks gentle Rowland for my Roundelay, And bless'd be Beta burthen of thy song, The shepheards Goddesse may she florish long, ô happie she. Her yeares and dayes thrice doubled may they bee: Triumphing Albion clap thy hands for joy, And pray the heavens may shield her from anoy, so will I pray. Rowland. So doe, and when my milk-white eawes have yeande, Beta shall have the firstling of the foulde, I'le burnish all his hornes with finest gould, and paynt his fleece with purple grayne. Perkin. Beleeve me as I am true shepheards swayne, Then for thy love all other I forsake, And unto thee my selfe I will betake, with fayth unfayn'd. Ipse ego thura dabo, fumosis candidus aris: Ipse feram ante tuos munera vota pedes. THE FOURTH EGLOG. Wynken bewayleth Elphins losse Wynken bewayleth Elphins losse, the God of Poesie, With Rowlands rime ecleepd the tears of the greene Hawthorne tree. Gorbo. Well met good Wynken, whither doest thou wend? How hast thou far'd sweet shepherd many a yeer? May Wynken thus his daies in darkenes spend? Who I have knowne for piping had no peere? Where been those fayre flocks thou wert wont to guide? What? been they dead? or hap'd on some mischance, Or mischiefe hath their master else betide, Or Lordly Love hath cast thee in a trance. What man? lets still be merie whilst we may, And take a truce with sorrow for a time, And let us passe this wearie winters day, In reading Riddles, or in making rime. Wynken. Ah woe's me Gorbo, mirth is farre away, Mirth may not sojourne with black malcontent, The lowring aspect of this dismall day, The winter of my sorrow doth augment. My song is now a swanne-like dying song, And my conceipts, the deepe conceipts of death, My heart becom'n a very hell of wrong, My breast the irksome prison of my breath. I loth my life, I loth the dearest light, Com'n is my night, when once appeeres the day, The blessed sunne seemes odious in my sight, No song may like me but the shreech-owles lay. Gorbo. What mayst thou be, that old Wynkin de word, Whose thred-bare wits o'rworne with melancholly, Once so delightsome at the shepheards boord, But now forlorne with thy selves self-wild folly. I think thou dot'st in thy gray-bearded age, Or brusd with sinne, for thy youths sin art sory, And vow'st for thy? a solemne pilgrimage, To holy Hayles or Patricks Purgatory. Come sit we downe under this Hawthorne tree. The morrowes light shall lend us daie enough, And tell a tale of Gawen or Sir Guy, Of Robin Hood, or of good Clem a Clough. Or else some Romant unto us areed, Which good olde Godfrey taught thee in thy youth, Of noble Lords and Ladies gentle deede, Or of thy love, or of thy lasses truth. Winken. Gorbo, my Comfort is accloyd with care, A new mishap my wonted joyes hath crost: Then mervaile not although my musicke jarre, When she the Author of her mirth hath lost, Elphin is dead, and in his grave is laid, Our lives delight whilst lovely Elphin lived, What cruell fate hath so the time betraid, The widow world of all her joyes deprived. O cursed death, Lives fearfull enemie, Times poysned sickle: Tyrants revenging pride: Thou blood-sucker, Thou childe of infamie: Devouring Tiger: slaughtering homicide: Ill hast thou done, and ill may thee betide. Naught hast thou got, the earth hath wonne the most, Nature is payd the interest of her due, Pan hath receav'd, what him so dearly cost, O heavens his vertues doe belong to you. A heavenly clowded in a humaine shape, Rare substance, in so rough a barcke Iclad, Of Pastorall, the lively springing sappe, Though mortall thou, thy fame immortall made. Spel-charming Prophet, sooth-divining seer, ô heavenly musicke of the highest spheare, Sweet sounding trump, soule-ravishing desire, Thou stealer of mans heart, inchanter of the eare. God of Invention, Joves deere Mercury, Joy of our Lawrell, pride of all our joy: The essence of all Poets divinitie, Spirit of Orpheus: Pallas lovely boy. But all my words shalbe dissolv'd to teares, And my tears fountaines shall to rivers grow: These Rivers to the floods of my dispaires, And these shall make an Ocean of my woe. His rare desarts, shall kindle my desire, With burning zeale, the brands of mine unrest, My sighes in adding sulphure to this fire, Shall frame another Ætna in my breast. Planets reserve your playnts till dismall day, The ruthles rockes but newly have begonne, And when in drops they be dissolv'd away, Let heavens begin to weepe when earth hath done. Then tune thy pipe and I will sing a laye, Upon his death by Rowland of the rocke, Sitting with me this other stormy day, In yon fayre field attending on our flock. Gorbo. This shall content me Wynken wondrous well, And in this mistie wether keepe us waking, To heare of him, who whylome did excell, In such a song of learned Rowlands making. Winken. Melpomine put on thy mourning Gaberdine, And set thy song unto the dolefull Base, And with thy sable vayle shadow thy face, with weeping verse, attend his hearse, Whose blessed soule the heavens doe now enshrine. Come Nymphs and with your Rebecks ring his knell, Warble forth your wamenting harmony, And at his drery fatall obsequie, with Cypres bowes, maske your fayre Browes, And beat your breasts to chyme his burying peale. Thy birth-day was to all our joye, the even, And on thy death this dolefull song we sing, Sweet Child of Pan, and the Castalian spring, unto our endles mone, from us why art thou gone, To fill up that sweete Angels quier in heaven. O whylome thou thy lasses dearest love, When with greene Lawrell she hath crowned thee, Immortall mirror of all Poesie: the Muses treasure, the Graces pleasure, Reigning with Angels now in heaven above. Our mirth is now depriv'd of all her glory, Our Taburins in dolefull dumps are drownd. Our viols want their sweet and pleasing sound, our melodie is mar'd and we of joyes debard, Oh wicked world so mutable and transitory. O dismall day, bereaver of delight, O stormy winter sourse of all our sorrow, ô most untimely and eclipsed morrow, to rob us quite of all delight, Darkening that starre which ever shone so bright: Oh Elphin, Elphin, Though thou hence be gone, In spight of death yet shalt thou live for aye, Thy Poesie is garlanded with Baye: and still shall blaze thy lasting prayse: Whose losse poore shepherds ever shall bemone. Come Girles, and with Carnations decke his grave, With damaske Roses and the hyacynt: Come with sweete Williams, Marjoram and Mynt, with precious Balmes, with hymnes and psalmes, His funerall deserves no lesse at all to have. But see where Elphin sits in fayre Elizia, Feeding his flocke on yonder heavenly playne, Come and behold, yon lovely shepheards swayne, piping his fill, on yonder hill, Tasting sweete Nectar, and Ambrosia. Gorbo. Oh how thy plaints (sweete friend) renew my payne, In listning thus to thy lamenting cries: That from the tempest of my troubled brayne, See how the floods been risen in mine eyes. And being now a full tide of our teares, It is full time to stop the streame of griefe, Lest drowning in the floods of our despaires, We want our lives, wanting our soules reliefe. But now the sunne beginneth to decline, And whilest our woes been in repeating here, Yon little elvish moping Lamb of mine, Is all betangled in yon crawling Brier. Optima prima ferè manibus rapiuntur avaris: Implentur numeris deteriora suis. THE FIFTH EGLOG. This lustie swayne his lowly quill This lustie swayne his lowly quill, to higher notes doth rayse, And in Ideas person paynts, his lovely lasses prayse. Motto. Come frolick it a while my lustie swayne, Let's see if time have yet revi'd in thee, Or if there be remayning but a grayne, Of the olde stocke of famous poesie, Or but one slip yet left of this same sacred tree. Or if reserv'd from elds devouring rage, Recordes of vertue, Aye memoriall, Left to the world as learnings lasting gage, Or if the prayse of worthy pastorall, May tempt thee now, or moove thee once at all. To Fortunes Orphanes Nature hath bequeath'd, That mighty Monarchs seldome have possest, From highest Heaven, this influence is breath'd, A most divine impression in the breast, And those whom Fortune pines doth Nature often feast. Ti's not the troupes of paynted Imagerie, Nor these worlds Idols, our worlds Idiots gazes, Our forgers of suppos'd Gentillitie, When he his great, great Grand-sires glory blases, And paints out fictions in base coyned Phrases. For honour naught regards, nor followeth fame, These silken pictures shewed in every streete: Of Idlenes comes evill, of pride ensueth shame, And blacke oblivion is their winding sheete, And all their glory troden under feete. Though Envie shute her seven-times poysned dartes, Yet purest golde is seven times try'd in fier, True valeur lodgeth in the lowlest harts, Vertue is in the minde, not in th'attyre, Nor stares at starres; nor stoups at filthy myre. Rowland. I may not sing of such as fall, nor clyme, Nor chaunt of armes, nor of heroique deedes, It fitteth not poore shepheards rurall rime, Nor is agreeing with my oaten reedes, Nor from my quill, grosse flatterie proceedes. Unsitting tearmes, nor false dissembling smiles, Shall in my lines, nor in my stile appeare, Worlds fawning fraud, nor like deceitfull guiles, No, no, my muse, none such shall sojourne here, Nor any bragges of hope nor signes of base despaire, No fatall dreades nor fruitles vaine desires, Nor caps, nor curtsies to a paynted wall, Nor heaping rotten sticks on needles fires, Ambitious thoughts to clime nor feares to fall, A minde voyd of mistrust, and free from servile thral. Foule slander thou suspitions Bastard Child, Selfe-eating Impe from vipers poysned wombe, Foule swelling toade with lothly spots defil'd, Vile Aspis bred within the ruinde tombe, Eternall death for ever be thy doombe. Still be thou shrouded in blacke pitchie night, Luld with the horror of night-ravens song, Let foggie mistes, clowd and eclipse thy light, Thy woolvish teeth chew out thy venomd tongue, With Snakes and adders be thy body stong. Motto. Nor these, nor these, may like thy lowlie quill, As of too hie, or of too base a straine, Unfitting thee, and sdeyned of thy skill, Nor yet according with a shepheards vayne, Nor no such subject may beseeme a swayne. Then tune thy reede unto Ideas prayse: And teach the woods to wonder at her name: Thy lowlie notes here mayst thou learne to rayse, And make the ecchoes blazen out her name, The lasting trumpe of Phebes lasting fame. Thy Temples then shall with greene bayes be dight, Thy Egle-soring muse upon her wing, With her fayre silver wings shall take her flight, To that hie welked tower where Angels sing, From thence to fetch the tutch of her sweete string. Rowland. Oh hie inthronized Jove, in thy Olympicke raigne, Oh battel-waging Marte, oh sage-saw'd Mercury, Oh Golden shrined Sol, Venus loves soveraigne, Oh dreadfull Saturne, flaming aye with furie, Moyst-humord Cinthya, Author of Lunacie, Conjoyne helpe to erect our faire Ideas trophie. Oh Tresses of faire Phœbus stremed die, Oh blessed load-starre lending purest light, Oh Paradice of heavenly tapistrie, Angels sweete musick, ô my soules delight, O fayrest Phebe passing every other light. Whose presence joyes the earths decayed state, Whose counsels are registred in the sphere, Whose sweete reflecting clearenes doth amate, The starrie lights, and makes the Sunne more fayre, Whose breathing sweete perfumeth all the ayre. Thy snowish necke, fayre Natures tresurie, Thy swannish breast, the haven of lasting blisse, Thy cheekes the bancks of Beauties usurie, Thy heart the myne, where goodnes gotten is, Thy lips those lips which Cupid joyes to kisse. And those fayre hands within whose lovely palmes, Fortune divineth happie Augurie, Those straightest fingers dealing heavenly almes, Pointed with pur'st of Natures Alcumie, Where love sits looking in loves palmistrie. And those fayre Ivorie columnes which upreare, That Temple built by heavens Geometrie, And holiest Flamynes sacrifizen theare, Unto that heavenly Queene of Chastitie, Where vertues burning lamps can never quenched be. Thence see the fairest light that ever shone, That cleare which doth worlds cleerenes quite surpasse, Brave Phœbus chayred in his golden throane, Beholding him, in this pure Christall glasse, See here the fayrest fayre that ever was. Delicious fountaine, liquid christalline, Mornings vermilion, verdant spring-times pride, Purest of purest, most refined fine, With crimson tincture curiously Idy'd, Mother of Muses, great Apollos bride. Earths heaven, worlds wonder, hiest house of fame, Reviver of the dead, eye-killer of the live, Belov'd of Angels, Vertues greatest name, Favors rar'st feature, beauties prospective, Oh that my verse thy vertues could contrive. That stately Theater on whose fayre stage, Each morall vertue actes a princely part, Where every scene pronounced by a Sage, Eternizeth divinest Poets Arte, Joyes the beholders eyes, and glads the hearers hart. The worlds memorials, that sententious booke, Where every Comma, points a curious phrase, Upon whose method, Angels joye to looke: At every Colon, Wisdomes selfe doth pause, And every Period hath his hie applause. Read in her eyes a Romant of delights, Read in her words the proverbs of the wise, Read in her life the holy vestall rites, Which love and vertue sweetly moralize: And she the Academ of vertues exercise. But on thy volumes who is there may comment, When as thy selfe hath Arts selfe undermined: Or undertake to coate thy learned margent, When learnings lines are ever enterlined, And purest words, are in thy mouth refined. Knewest thou thy vertues, oh thou fayr'st of fayrest, Thou earths sole Phenix, of the world admired, Vertue in thee repurify'd and rarest, Whose endles fame by time is not expired, Then of thy selfe would thy selfe be admired. But arte wants arte to frame so pure a Myrror, Where humaine eyes may view thy vertues beautie, When fame is so surprised with the terror, Wanting to pay the tribute of her duetie, With colours who can paint out vertues beautie. But since unperfect are the perfects colours, And skill is so unskilfull how to blaze thee: Now will I make a myrror of my dolours, And in my teares then looke thy selfe and prayse thee, Oh happy I, if such a glasse might please thee. Goe gentle windes and whisper in her eare, And tell Idea how much I adore her, And thou my flock, reporte unto my fayre, How she excelleth all that went before her, Tell her the very foules in ayre adore her. And thou cleare Brooke by whose fayre silver streame, Grow those tall Okes where I have carv'd her name, Convay her praise to Neptunes watery Realme, Refresh the rootes of her still growing fame, And teach the Dolphins to resound her name. Motto. Cease shepheard cease, reserve thy Muses store, Till after time shall teach thy Oaten reede, Aloft in ayre with Egles wings to sore, And sing in honor of some worthies deede, To serve Idea in some better steede. She sees not shepheard, no she will not see, Her rarest vertues blazond by thy quill, Nor knowes the effect the same hath wrought in thee, The very tuch and anvile of thy skill, And this is that which bodeth all thy ill. Yet if her vertues glorie shall decay, Or if her beauties flower shall hap to fall, Or any cloud eclipse her sun-shine day, Then looke (Idea) in thy pastorall, And thou thy vertues unto minde shalt call. Rowland. Shepheard farewell, the skies begin to lowre, Yon pitchie clowd which hangeth in the West, I feare me doth presage some sodaine showre, Come let us home, for so I think it best, For all our flocks been laid them downe to rest. Motto. And if thou list to come unto my Coate, Although (God knowes) my cheere be to too small, And wealth with me was never yet afloate, Yet take in gree what ever doe befall, And wee will sit, and sing a mery madrigall. Rowland. Per superos iuro testes, pompamque Deorum, Te Dominam nobis tempus in omne fore. Motto. Nos quoque per totum pariter cantabimur orbem, Iunctàque semper erunt nomina nostra tuis. THE SIXT EGLOG. Good Gorbo cals to mind the fame Good Gorbo cals to mind the fame, of our old Ancestrie: And Perkin sings Pandoras prayse, The Muse of Britanye. Perkin. All haile good Gorbo, yet return'd at last, What tell me man? how goes the world with thee? What is it worse then it was wont to be? Or been thy youthfull dayes already past? Have patience man, for wealth will come and goe, And to the end the world shall ebbe and flowe. The valiant man, whose thoughts on hie been placed, And sees sometime how fortune list to rage, With wisdome still his actions so doth gage, As with her frownes he no whit is disgraced, And when she fawnes, and turnes her squinting eye, Bethinks him then, of her inconstancie. When as the Cullian, and the viler Clowne, Who with the swine, on draffe sets his desire, And thinks no life to wallowing in the myre, In stormie tempest, dying layes him downe, Yet tasting weale, the asse begins to bray, And feeling woe, the beast consumes away. Gorbo. So said the Sage in his Philosophie, The Lordly hart inspir'd with noblesse, With courage doth his crosses still suppresse, His patience doth his passions mortifie, When other folke this paine cannot endure, Because they want this med'cine for their cure. Perkin. And yet oft times the world I doe admire, When as the wise and vertuous men I see, Be hard beset with neede and povertie, And lewdest fooles to highest things aspire, What should I say? that fortune is to blame? Or unto whome should I impute this shame. Gorbo. Vertue and Fortune never could agree, Foule Fortune ever was faire vertues foe, Blinde Fortune blindly doth her gifts bestowe, But vertue wise, and wisely doth foresee, They fall which trust to fortunes fickle wheele, But staied by vertue, men shall never reele. Perkin. If so, why should she not be more regarded, Why should men cherish vice and villanie, And maintaine sinne and basest rogerie, And vertue thus so slightly be rewarded, This shewes that we full deepe dissemblers be, And all we doe, but meere hypocrisie. Gorbo. Where been those Nobles, Perkin, where been they? Where been those worthies, Perkin, which of yore, This gentle Ladie did so much adore? And for her Impes did with such care purvey, They been yswadled in their winding sheete, And she (I thinke) is buried at their feete. Oh worthy world, wherein those worthies lived, Unworthy world, of such men so unworthy, Unworthy age, of all the most unworthy, Which art of these so worthy men deprived, And inwardly in us is nothing lesse, Than outwardly that, which we most professe. Perkin. Nay stay good Gorbo, Vertue is not dead, Nor all her friends be gone which wonned here, She lives with one who ever held her deere, And to her lappe for succour she is fled, In her sweete bosome, she hath built her nest, And from the world, even there she lives at rest. Unto this sacred Ladie she was left, (To be an heire-loome) by her ancestrie, And so bequeathed by their legacie, When on their death-bed, life was them bereft: And as on earth together they remayne, Together so in heaven they both shall raigne. Oh thou Pandora, through the world renoun'd, The glorious light, and load-starre of our West, With all the vertues of the heavens possest, With mighty groves of holy Lawrell cround, Erecting learnings long decayed fame, Heryed and hallowed be thy sacred name. The flood of Helicon, forspent and drie, Her sourse decayd with foule oblivion, The fountaine flowes againe in thee alone, Where Muses now their thirst may satisfie, And old Apollo, from Pernassus hill, May in this spring refresh his droughty quill. The Graces twisting garlands for thy head, Thy Ivorie temples deckt with rarest flowers, Their rootes refreshed with divinest showers, Thy browes with mirtle all inveloped, Shepheards erecting trophies to thy praise, Lauding thy name in songs and heavenly laies. Sapphos sweete vaine in thy rare quill is seene, Minerva was a figure of thy worth, Mnemosine, who brought the Muses forth, Wonder of Britaine, learnings famous Queene, Apollo was thy Syer, Pallas her selfe thy mother, Pandora thou, our Phœbus was thy brother. Delicious Larke, sweete musick of the morrow, Cleere bell of Rhetoricke, ringing peales of love, Joy of the Angels, sent us from above, Enchanting Syren, charmer of all sorrow, The loftie subject of a heavenly tale, Thames fairest Swanne, our summers Nightingale. Arabian Phenix, wonder of thy sexe, Lovely, chaste, holy, Myracle admired, With spirit from the highest heaven inspired, Oh thou alone, whome fame alone respects, Natures chiefe glory, learnings richest prize, Hie Joves Empresa, vertues Paradize. Oh glorie of thy nation, beauty of thy name, Joy of thy countrey, blesser of thy birth, Thou blazing Comet, Angel of the earth, Oh Poets Goddesse, sun-beame of their fame: Whome time through many worlds hath sought to find, Thou peerles Paragon of woman kinde. Thy glorious Image, gilded with the sunne, Thy lockes adorn'd with an immortall crowne, Mounted aloft, upon a Chrystal throne, When by thy death, thy life shalbe begun: The blessed Angels tuning to the spheares, With Gods sweete musick, charme thy sacred eares. From Fayrie Ile, devided from the mayne, To utmost Thuly fame transports thy name, To Garamant shall thence convey the same, Where taking wing, and mounting up againe, From parched banckes on sun-burnt Affricks shore, Shall flie as farre as erst she came of yore. And gentle Zephire from his pleasant bower, Whistling sweete musick to the shepheards rime, The Ocean billowes duely keeping time, Playing upon Neptunus brazen tower: Lovers of learning shouting out their cries, Shaking the Center with th'applaudities. Whilst that great engine, on her axeltree, Doth role about the vaultie circled Globe, Whilst morning mantleth, in her purple Robe, Or Tytan poste his sea Queenes bower to see, Whilst Phœbus crowne, adornes the starrie skie, Pandoras fame so long shall never die. When all our silver swans shall cease to sing, And when our groves shall want their Nightingales, When hils shall heare no more our shepheards tales, Nor ecchoes with our Roundelayes shall ring, The little birdes long listning to thy fame, Shall teach their ofspring to record thy name. Ages shall tell such wonders of thy name, And thou in death thy due desert shalt have, That thou shalt be immortall in thy grave, Thy vertues adding force unto thy fame, So that vertue with thy fames wings shall flie, And by thy fame shall vertue never die. Upon thy toombe shall spring a Lawrell tree, Whose sacred shade shall serve thee for an hearse, Upon whose leaves (in golde) ingrav'd this verse, Dying she lives, whose like shall never be, A spring of Nectar flowing from this tree, The fountayne of eternall memorie. To adorne the triumph of eternitie, Drawne with the steedes which dragge the golden sunne, Thy wagon through the milken way shall runne, Millions of Angels still attending thee, Millions of Saints shall thy lives prayses sing, Pend with the quill of an Archangels wing. Gorbo. Long may Pandora weare the Lawrell crowne, The ancient glory of her noble Peers, And as the Egle: Lord renew her yeeres, Long to upholde the proppe of our renowne, Long may she be as she hath ever beene, The lowly handmaide of the Fayrie Queene. Non mihi mille placent: non sum desertor Amoris: Tu mihi (si qua fides) cura perennis eris. THE SEVENTH EGLOG. Borrill an aged shepheard swaine Borrill an aged shepheard swaine, with reasons doth reproove, Batte a foolish wanton boy, but lately falne in love. Batte. Borrill, why sit'st thou musing in thy coate? like dreaming Merlyn in his drowsie Cell, What may it be with learning thou doest doate, or art inchanted with some Magick spell? Or wilt thou now an Hermites life professe? And bid thy beades heare like an Ancoresse? See how faire Flora decks our fields with flowers, and clothes our groves in gaudie summers greene, And wanton Ver distils rose-water showers, to welcome Ceres, harvests hallowed Queene, Who layes abroad her lovely sun-shine haires, Crown'd with great garlands of her golden eares. Now shepheards layne their blankets all awaie, and in their Jackets minsen on the plaines, And at the rivers fishen daie by daie, now none so frolicke as the shepheards swaines, Why liest thou here then in thy loathsome cave, As though a man were buried quicke in grave. Borrill. Batte, my coate from tempest standeth free, when stately towers been often shakt with wind, And wilt thou Batte, come and sit with me? contented life here shalt thou onely finde, Here mai'st thou caroll Hymnes, and sacred Psalmes, And hery Pan, with orizons and almes. And scorne the crowde of such as cogge for pence, and waste their wealth in sinfull braverie, Whose gaine is losse, whose thrift is lewd expence, and liven still in golden slavery: Wondring at toyes, as foolish worldlings doone, Like to the dogge which barked at the moone. Here maist thou range the goodly pleasant field, and search out simples to procure thy heale, What sundry vertues hearbs and flowres doe yeeld, gainst griefe which may thy sheepe or thee assaile: Here mayst thou hunt the little harmeles Hare, Or else entrap false Raynard in a snare. Or if thou wilt in antique Romants reede, of gentle Lords and ladies that of yore, In forraine lands atchiev'd their noble deede, and been renownd from East to Westerne shore: Or learne the shepheards nice astrolobie, To know the Planets mooving in the skie. Batte. Shepheard these things been all too coy for mee, whose lustie dayes should still be spent in mirth, These mister artes been better fitting thee, whose drouping dayes are drawing towards the earth: What thinkest thou? my jolly peacocks trayne, Shall be acoyd and brooke so foule a stayne? These been for such as make them votarie, and take them to the mantle and the ring, And spenden day and night in dotarie, hammering their heads, musing on heavenly thing, And whisper still of sorrow in their bed, And done despise all love and lustie head: Like to the curre, with anger well neere woode, who makes his kennel in the Oxes stall, And snarleth when he seeth him take his foode, and yet his chaps can chew no hay at all. Borrill, even so it fareth now with thee, And with these wisards of thy mysterie. Borrill. Sharpe is the thorne, full soone I see by thee, bitter the blossome, when the fruite is sower, And early crook'd, that will a Camock bee, rough is the winde before a sodayne shower: Pittie thy wit should be so wrong mislead, And thus be guyded by a giddie head. Ah foolish elfe, I inly pittie thee, misgoverned by thy lewd brainsick will: The hidden baytes, ah fond thou do'st not see, nor find'st the cause which breedeth all thy ill: Thou think'st all golde, that hath a golden shew, And art deceiv'd, for it is nothing soe. Such one art thou as is the little flie, who is so crowse and gamesome with the flame, Till with her busines and her nicetie, her nimble wings are scorched with the same, Then fals she downe with pitteous buzzing note, And in the fier doth sindge her mourning cote. Batte. Alas good man I see thou ginst to rave, thy wits done erre, and misse the cushen quite, Because thy head is gray and wordes been grave, thou think'st thereby to draw me from delight: What I am young, a goodly Batcheler, And must live like the lustie limmeter. Thy legges been crook'd, thy knees done bend for age, and I am swift and nimble as the Roe, Thou art ycouped like a bird in cage, and in the field I wander too and froe, Thou must doe penance for thy olde misdeedes, And make amends, with Avies and with creedes. For al that thou canst say, I will not let, for why my fancie strayneth me so sore, That day and night, my minde is wholy set on jollie Love, and jollie Paramore: Only on love I set my whole delight, The summers day, and all the winters night. That pretie Cupid, little god of love, whose imped wings with speckled plumes been dight, Who striketh men below, and Gods above, roving at randon with his feathered flight, When lovely Venus sits and gives the ayme, And smiles to see her little Bantlings game. Upon my staffe his statue will I carve, his bowe and quiver on his winged backe, His forked heads, for such as them deserve, and not of his, an implement shall lacke, And Venus in her Litter all of love, Drawne with a Swanne, a Sparrow, and a Dove. And under him Thesby of Babylon, and Cleopatra somtime of renowne: Phillis that died for love of Demophôon, then lovely Dido Queen of Carthage towne, Which ever held god Cupids lawes so deare, And been canoniz'd in Loves Calendere. Borrill. Ah wilfull boy, thy follie now I finde, and hard it is a fooles talke to endure, Thou art as deafe even as thy god is blinde, sike as the Saint, sike is the serviture: But wilt thou heare a good olde Minstrels song, A medicine for such as been with love ystong. Batte. Borrill, sing on I pray thee let us heare, that I may laugh to see thee shake thy beard, But take heede Borrill that thy voyce be cleare, or by my hood thou'lt make us all afeard, Or els I doubt that thou wilt fright our flockes, When they shall heare thee barke so like a foxe. Borrill. Oh spightfull wayward wretched love, Woe to Venus which did nurse thee, Heavens and earth thy plagues do prove, Gods and men have cause to curse thee. Thoughts griefe, hearts woe, Hopes paine, bodies languish, Envies rage, sleepes foe, Fancies fraud, soules anguish, Desires dread, mindes madnes, Secrets bewrayer, natures error, Sights deceit, sullens sadnes, Speeches expence, Cupids terror, Malcontents melancholly, Lives slaughter, deaths nurse, Cares slave, dotards folly, Fortunes bayte, worlds curse, Lookes theft, eyes blindnes, Selfes will, tongues treason, Paynes pleasure, wrongs kindnes, Furies frensie, follies reason: With cursing thee as I began, Cursing thee I make an end, Neither God, neither man, Neither Fayrie, neither Feend. Batte. Ah worthy Borrill, here's a goodly song, now by my belt I never heard a worse: Olde doting foole, for shame hold thou thy tongue, I would thy clap were shut up in my purse. It is thy life, if thou mayst scolde and braule: Yet in thy words there is no wit at all. And for that wrong which thou to love hast done, I will aveng me at this present time, And in such sorte as now thou hast begonne, I will repeat a carowlet in rime, Where, Borrill, I unto thy teeth will prove, That all my good consisteth in my love. Borrill. Come on good Batte, I pray thee let us heare? Much will be sayd, and never a whit the near. Batte. Love is the heavens fayre aspect, love is the glorie of the earth, Love only doth our lives direct, love is our guyder from our birth, Love taught my thoughts at first to flie, love taught mine eyes the way to love, Love raysed my conceit so hie, love framd my hand his arte to prove. Love taught my Muse her perfect skill, love gave me first to Poesie: Love is the Soveraigne of my will, love bound me first to loyalty. Love was the first that fram'd my speech, love was the first that gave me grace: Love is my life and fortunes leech, love made the vertuous give me place. Love is the end of my desire, love is the loadstarre of my love, Love makes my selfe, my selfe admire, love seated my delights above. Love placed honor in my brest, love made me learnings favoret, Love made me liked of the best, love first my minde on vertue set. Love is my life, life is my love, love is my whole felicity, Love is my sweete, sweete is my love, I am in love, and love in me. Borrill. Is love in thee? alas poore sillie lad, thou never couldst have lodg'd a worser guest, For where he rules no reason can be had, so is he still sworne enemie to rest: It pitties me to thinke thy springing yeares, Should still be spent with woes, with sighes, with teares. Batte. Gramercy Borrill for thy company, for all thy jestes and all thy merrie Bourds, I still shall long untill I be with thee, because I find some wisdome in thy words, But I will watch the next time thou doost ward, And sing thee such a lay of love as never shepheard heard. THE EIGHTH EGLOG. Good Gorbo of the golden world Good Gorbo of the golden world, and Saturns raigne doth tell, And afterward doth make reporte, of bonnie Dowsabell. Motto. Shepheard why creepe we in this lowly vaine, as though our muse no store at all affordes, Whilst others vaunt it with the frolicke swayne, and strut the stage with reperfumed wordes. See how these yonkers rave it out in rime, who make a traffique of their rarest wits, And in Bellonas buskin tread it fine, like Bacchus priests raging in franticke fits. Those mirtle Groves decay'd, done growe againe, their rootes refresht with Heliconas spring, Whose pleasant shade invites the homely swayne, to sit him downe and heare the Muses sing. Then if thy Muse hath spent her wonted zeale, with Ivie twist thy temples shall be crownd, Or if she dares hoyse up top-gallant sayle, amongst the rest, then may she be renownd. Gorbo. My boy, these yonkers reachen after fame, and so done presse into the learned troupe, With filed quill to glorifie their name, which otherwise were pend in shamefull coupe. But this hie object hath abjected me, and I must pipe amongst the lowly sorte, Those little heard-groomes who admir'd to see, when I by Moone-shine made the fayries sporte. Who dares describe the toyles of Hercules, and puts his hand to fames eternall penne, Must invocate the soule of Hercules, attended with the troupes of conquered men. Who writes of thrice renowmed Theseus, a monster-tamers rare description, Trophies the jawes of uglie Cerberus, and paynts out Styx, and fiery Acheron. My Muse may not affect night-charming spels, whose force effects th'Olympicke vault to quake, Nor call those grysly Goblins from their Cels, the ever-damned frye of Limbo lake. And who erects the brave Pyramides, of Monarches or renowned warriours, Neede bath his quill for such attempts as these, in flowing streames of learned Maros showres. For when the great worlds conquerer began, to prove his helmet and his habergeon, The sweat that from the Poets-God Orpheus ran, foretold his Prophets had to play upon. When Pens and Launces sawe the Olympiad prize, those chariot triumphes with the Lawrell crowne, Then gan the worthies glorie first to rise, and plumes were vayled to the purple gowne. The gravest Censor, sagest Senator, with wings of Justice and Religion, Mounted the top of Nimrods statelie Tower, soring unto that hie celestiall throne: Where blessed Angels in their heavenly queares, chaunt Anthemes with shrill Syren harmonie, Tun'd to the sound of those aye-crouding sphears, which herien their makers eternitie. Those who foretell the times of unborne men, and future things in foretime augured, Have slumbred in that spell-gods darkest den, which first inspir'd his prophesiyng head. Sooth-saying Sibels sleepen long agone, we have their reede, but few have cond their Arte, Welch-wisard Merlyn, cleveth to a stone, no Oracle more wonders may impart. The Infant age could deftly caroll love, till greedy thirst of that ambitious honor, Drew Poets pen, from his sweete lasses glove, to chaunt of slaughtering broiles &amp; bloody horror. Then Joves love-theft was privily discri'd, how he playd false play in Amphitrios bed, And how Apollo in the mount of Ide, gave Oenon phisick for her maydenhead. The tender grasse was then the softest bed, the pleasant'st shades were deem'd the statelyest hals, No belly-god with Bacchus banqueted, nor paynted ragges then covered rotten wals. Then simple love with simple vertue way'd, flowers the favours which true fayth revayled, Kindnes with kindnes was againe repay'd, with sweetest kisses covenants were sealed. Then beauties selfe with her selfe beautified, scornd payntings pergit, and the borrowed hayre, Nor monstrous formes deformities did hide, nor foule was vernisht with compounded fayre. The purest fleece then covered purest skin, for pride as then with Lucifer remaynd: Deformed fashions now were to begin, nor clothes were yet with poysned liquor staynd. But when the bowels of the earth were sought, and men her golden intrayles did espie, This mischiefe then into the world was brought, this fram'd the mint which coynd our miserie. Then lofty Pines were by ambition hewne, and men sea-monsters swamme the brackish flood, In waynscot tubs, to seeke out worlds unknowne, for certain ill to leave assured good. The starteling steede is manag'd from the field, and serves a subject to the riders lawes, He whom the churlish bit did never weeld, now feels the courb controll his angrie jawes. The hammering Vulcane spent his wasting fire, till he the use of tempred mettals found, His anvile wrought the steeled cotes attire, and forged tooles to carve the foe-mans wound. The Citie builder then intrencht his towres, and wald his wealth within the fenced towne, Which afterward in bloudy stormy stours, kindled that flame which burnt his Bulwarks downe. And thus began th'Exordium of our woes, the fatall dumbe shewe of our miserie: Here sprang the tree on which our mischiefe growes, the drery subject of worlds tragedie. Motto. Well, shepheard well, the golden age is gone, wishes may not revoke that which is past: It were no wit to make two griefes of one, our proverb sayth, Nothing can alwayes last. Listen to me my lovely shepheards joye, and thou shalt heare with mirth and mickle glee, A pretie Tale, which when I was a boy, my toothles Grandame oft hath tolde to me. Gorbo. Shepheard say on, so may we passe the time, There is no doubt it is some worthy ryme. Motto. Farre in the countrey of Arden, There wond a knight hight Cassemen, as bolde as Isenbras: Fell was he and eger bent, In battell and in Tournament, as was the good sir Topas. He had as antique stories tell, A daughter cleaped Dowsabell, a mayden fayre and free: And for she was her fathers heire, Full well she was ycond the leyre, of mickle curtesie. The silke wel couth she twist and twine, And make the fine Marchpine, and with the needle werke, And she couth helpe the priest to say His Mattens on a holyday, and sing a Psalme in Kirke. She ware a frock of frolicke greene, Might well beseeme a mayden Queene, which seemly was to see. A hood to that so neat and fine, In colour like the colombine, ywrought full featuously. Her feature all as fresh above, As is the grasse that growes by Dove, as lyth as lasse of Kent: Her skin as soft as Lemster wooll, As white as snow on peakish hull, or Swanne that swims in Trent. This mayden in a morne betime, Went forth when May was in her prime, to get sweete Cetywall, The hony-suckle, the Harlocke, The Lilly and the Lady-smocke, to deck her summer hall. Thus as she wandred here and there, Ypicking of the bloomed Breere, she chanced to espie A shepheard sitting on a bancke, Like Chanteclere he crowed crancke, and pip'd with merrie glee: He leard his sheepe as he him list, When he would whistle in his fist, to feede about him round: Whilst he full many a caroll sung, Untill the fields and medowes rung, and that the woods did sound: In favour this same shepheards swayne, Was like the bedlam Tamburlayne, which helde prowd Kings in awe: But meeke he was as Lamb mought be, Ylike that gentle Abel he, whom his lewd brother slaw. This shepheard ware a sheepe gray cloke, Which was of the finest loke, that could be cut with sheere, His mittens were of Bauzens skinne, His cockers were of Cordiwin, his hood of Meniveere. His aule and lingell in a thong, His tar-boxe on his broad belt hong, his breech of Coyntrie blew: Full crispe and curled were his lockes, His browes as white as Albion rocks, so like a lover true. And pyping still he spent the day, So mery as the Popingay: which liked Dowsabell, That would she ought or would she nought, This lad would never from her thought: she in love-longing fell. At length she tucked up her frocke, White as the Lilly was her smocke, she drew the shepheard nie, But then the shepheard pyp'd a good, That all his sheepe forsooke their foode, to heare his melodie. Thy sheepe quoth she cannot be leane, That have a jolly shepheards swayne, the which can pipe so well. Yea but (sayth he) their shepheard may, If pyping thus he pine away, in love of Dowsabell. Of love fond boy take thou no keepe, Quoth she, looke well unto thy sheepe, lest they should hap to stray. Quoth he, so had I done full well, Had I not seene fayre Dowsabell, come forth to gather Maye. With that she gan to vaile her head, Her cheekes were like the Roses red, but not a word she sayd. With that the shepheard gan to frowne, He threw his pretie pypes adowne, and on the ground him layd. Sayth she, I may not stay till night, And leave my summer hall undight, and all for long of thee. My Coate sayth he, nor yet my foulde, Shall neither sheepe nor shepheard hould, except thou favour me. Sayth she yet lever I were dead, Then I should lose my maydenhead, and all for love of men: Sayth he yet are you too unkind, If in your heart you cannot finde, to love us now and then: And I to thee will be as kinde, As Colin was to Rosalinde, of curtesie the flower: Then will I be as true quoth she, As ever mayden yet might be, unto her Paramour: With that she bent her snow-white knee, Downe by the shepheard kneeled shee, and him she sweetely kist. With that the shepheard whoop'd for joy, Quoth he, ther's never shepheards boy, that ever was so blist. Gorbo. Now by my sheep-hooke here's a tale alone, Learne me the same and I will give thee hier, This were as good as curds for our Jone, When at a night we sitten by the fire. Motto. Why gentle hodge I will not sticke for that, When we two meeten here another day, But see whilst we have set us downe to chat, Yon tikes of mine begin to steale away. And if thou wilt but come unto our greene, On Lammas day when as we have our feast, Thou shalt sit next unto our summer Queene, And thou shalt be the onely welcome guest. THE NINTH EGLOG. When cole-blacke night with sable vaile When cole-blacke night with sable vaile eclipsd the gladsome light, Rowland in darkesome shade alone, bemoanes his wofull plight. What time the wetherbeaten flockes, forsooke the fields to shrowd them in the folde, The groves dispoyl'd of their fayre summer lockes, the leaveles branches nipt with frostie colde, The drouping trees their gaynesse all agone, In mossie mantles doe expresse their moane. When Phœbus from his Lemmans lovely bower, throughout the sphere had jerckt his angry Jades, His Carre now pass'd the heavens hie welked Tower, gan dragge adowne the occidentall slades, In silent shade of desart all alone, Thus to the night, Rowland bewrayes his moane. Oh blessed starres which lend the darknes light, the glorious paynting of that circled throane, You eyes of heaven, you lanthornes of the night, to you bright starres, to you I make my moane, Or end my dayes, or ease me of my griefe, The earth is frayle, and yeelds me no reliefe. And thou fayre Phebe, cleerer to my sight, then Tytan is when brightest he hath shone, Why shouldst thou now shut up thy blessed light, and sdayne to looke on thy Endymion? Perhaps the heavens me thus despight have done, Because I durst compare thee with their sunne. If drery sighes the tempests of my brest, or streames of teares from floods of weeping eyes, If downe-cast lookes with darksome cloudes opprest, or words which with sad accents fall and rise, If these, nor her, nor you, to pittie move, There's neither helpe in you, nor hope in love. Oh fayr'st that lives, yet most unkindest mayd, ô whilome thou the joy of all my flocke, Why have thine eyes these eyes of mine betrayd, unto thy hart more hard then flintie rocke, And lastly thus depriv'd me of their sight, From whome my love derives both life and light. Those dapper ditties pend unto her prayse, and those sweete straynes of tunefull pastorall, She scorneth as the Lourdayns clownish layes, and recketh as the rustick madrigall, Her lippes prophane Ideas sacred name, And sdayne to read the annals of her fame. Those gorgeous garlands and those goodly flowers, wherewith I crown'd her tresses in the prime, She most abhors, and shuns those pleasant bowers, made to disport her in the summer time: She hates the sports and pastimes I invent, And as the toade, flies all my meriment. With holy verses heryed I her glove, and dew'd her cheekes with fountaines of my teares, And carold her full many a lay of love, twisting sweete Roses in her golden hayres. Her wandring sheepe full safely have I kept, And watch'd her flocke full oft when she hath slept. Oenon never upon Ida hill, so oft hath cald on Alexanders name, As hath poore Rowland with an Angels quill, erected trophies of Ideas fame: Yet that false shepheard Oenon fled from thee, I follow her that ever flies from me. Ther's not a grove that wonders not my woe, there's not a river weepes not at my tale: I heare the ecchoes (wandring too and froe) resound my griefe in every hill and dale, The beasts in field, with many a wofull groane, The birds in ayre help to expresse my moane. Where been those lines? the heraulds of my heart, my plaints, my tears, my vowes, my sighes, my prayers? O what avayleth fayth, or what my Artes? ô love, ô hope, quite turn'd into despayres: She stops her eares as Adder to the charmes, And lets me lye and languish in my harmes. All is agone, such is my endles griefe, and my mishaps amended naught with moane, I see the heavens will yeeld me no reliefe: what helpeth care, when cure is past and gone, And teares I see, doe me avayle no good, But as great showres increase the rising flood. With folded armes, thus hanging downe his head, he gave a groane as though his heart had broke, Then looking pale and wan as he were dead, he fetch'd a sigh, but never a word he spoke: For now his heart wax'd cold as any stone, Was never man alive so woe begone. With that fayre Cinthya stoups her glittering vayle, and dives adowne into the Ocean flood, The easterne brow which erst was wan and pale, now in the dawning blusheth red as blood: The whistling Larke ymounted on her wings, To the gray morrow, her good morrow sings. When this poore shepheard Rowland of the Rocke, whose faynting legges his body scarse upheld, Each shepheard now returning to his flocke, alone poore Rowland fled the pleasant field, And in his Coate got to a vechie bed: Was never man alive so hard bested.

Vouchsafe to grace these rude unpolish'd rymes, Which long (deer friend) have slept in sable night, And come abroad now in these glorious tymes, Can hardly brooke the purenes of the light. But sith you see their desteny is such, That in the world theyr fortune they must try, Perhaps they better shall abide the tuch, Wearing your name theyr gracious livery. Yet these mine owne, I wrong not other men, Nor trafique further then thys happy Clyme, Nor filch from Portes nor from Petrarchs pen, A fault too common in thys latter tyme. Divine Syr Phillip, I avouch thy writ, I am no Pickpurse of anothers wit. Yours devoted, M. Drayton. [Ankor tryumph, upon whose blessed shore] Ankor tryumph, upon whose blessed shore, The sacred Muses solemnize thy name: Where the Arcadian Swaines with rytes adore Pandoras poesy, and her living fame. Where first this jolly Sheepheard gan rehearse, That heavenly worth, upon his Oaten reede, Of earths great Queene: in Nectar-dewed verse, Which none so wise that rightly can areede. Nowe in conceite of his ambitious love, He mounts his thoughts unto the highest gate, Straynd with some sacred spirit from above, Bewraies his love, his fayth, his life, his fate: In this his myrror of Ideas praise, On whom his thoughts, and fortunes all attend, Tunes all his Ditties, and his Roundelaies, How love begun, how love shal never end. No wonder though his Muse then soare so hie, Whose subject is the Queene of Poesie. Gorbo il fidele. AMOUR. 1. Reade heere (sweet Mayd) the story of my wo, The drery abstracts of my endles cares: With my lives sorow enterlyned so, Smok'd with my sighes, and blotted with my teares. The sad memorials of my miseries, Pend in the griefe of myne afflicted ghost: My lives complaint in doleful Elegies, With so pure love as tyme could never boast. Receave the incense which I offer heere, By my strong fayth ascending to thy fame, My zeale, my hope, my vowes, my praise, my prayer, My soules oblations to thy sacred name. Which name my Muse to highest heaven shal raise, By chast desire, true love, and vertues praise. AMOUR. 2. My fayre, if thou wilt register my love, More then worlds volumes shall thereof arise, Preserve my teares, and thou thy selfe shalt prove A second flood downe rayning from mine eyes. Note but my sighes, and thine eyes shal behold, The Sun-beames smothered with immortall smoke: And if by thee my prayers may be enrold, They heaven and earth to pitty shall provoke. Looke thou into my breast, and thou shalt see Chaste holy vowes for my soules sacrifice: That soule (sweet Maide) which so hath honored thee, Erecting Trophies to thy sacred eyes. Those eyes to my hart shining ever bright, When darknes hath obscur'd each other light. AMOUR. 3. My thoughts bred up with Eagle-birds of love, And for their vertues I desierd to know, Upon the nest I set them, forth to prove, If they were of the Eagles kinde or no. But they no sooner saw my Sunne appeare, But on her rayes with gazing eyes they stood, Which proov'd my birds delighted in the ayre, And that they came of this rare kinglie brood. But now their plumes full sumd with sweet desire, To shew their kinde, began to clime the skies: Doe what I could my Eaglets would aspire, Straight mounting up to thy celestiall eyes. And thus (my faire) my thoughts away be flowne, And from my breast into thine eyes be gone. AMOUR. 4. My faire, had I not erst adornd my Lute, With those sweet strings stolne from thy golden hayre, Unto the world had all my joyes been mute, Nor had I learn'd to descant on my faire. Had not mine eye seene thy Celestiall eye, Nor my hart knowne the power of thy name, My soule had ne'r felt thy Divinitie, Nor my Muse been the trumpet of thy fame. But thy divine perfections by their skill, This miracle on my poore Muse have tried: And by inspiring, glorifide my quill, And in my verse thy selfe art deified. Thus from thy selfe the cause is thus derived, That by thy fame all fame shall be survived. AMOUR. 5. Since holy Vestall lawes have been neglected, The Gods pure fire hath been extinguisht quite: No Virgine once attending on that light, Nor yet those heavenly secrets once respected. Till thou alone to pay the heavens their dutie, Within the Temple of thy sacred name, With thine eyes kindling that Celestial flame, By those reflecting Sun-beames of thy beautie. Here Chastity that Vestall most divine, Attends that Lampe with eye which never sleepeth, The volumes of Religions lawes shee keepeth, Making thy breast that sacred reliques shryne, Where blessed Angels singing day and night, Praise him which made that fire, which lends that light. AMOUR. 6. In one whole world is but one Phœnix found, A Phœnix thou, this Phœnix then alone, By thy rare plume thy kind is easly knowne, With heavenly colours dide, with natures wonder cround, Heape thine own vertues seasoned by their sunne, On heavenlie top of thy divine desire: Then with thy beautie set the same on fire, So by thy death, thy life shall be begunne. Thy selfe thus burned in this sacred flame, With thine owne sweetnes al the heavens perfuming, And stil increasing as thou art consuming, Shalt spring againe from th'ashes of thy fame; And mounting up, shalt to the heavens ascend, So maist thou live, past world, past fame, past end. AMOUR. 7. Stay, stay, sweet Time, behold or ere thou passe From world to world, thou long hast sought to see, That wonder now wherein all wonders be, Where heaven beholds her in a mortall glasse. Nay, looke thee Time in this Celestiall glasse, And thy youth past, in this faire mirror see: Behold worlds Beautie in her infancie, What shee was then, and thou or ere shee was. Now passe on Time, to after-worlds tell this, Tell truelie Time what in thy time hath beene, That they may tel more worlds what Time hath seene, And heaven may joy to think on past worlds blisse. Heere make a Period Time, and saie for mee, She was, the like that never was, nor never more shalbe. AMOUR. 8. Unto the World, to Learning, and to Heaven, Three nines there are, to everie one a nine, One number of the earth, the other both divine, One wonder woman now makes three od numbers even. Nine orders first of Angels be in heaven, Nine Muses doe with learning still frequent: These with the Gods are ever resident: Nine worthy men unto the world were given. My Worthie, one to these nine Worthies, addeth, And my faire Muse, one Muse unto the nine: And my good Angell in my soule divine, With one more order, these nine orders gladdeth. My Muse, my Worthy, and my Angell then, Makes every one of these three nines a ten. AMOUR. 9. Beauty sometime in all her glory crowned, Passing by that cleere fountaine of thine eye: Her sun-shine face there chaunsing to espy, Forgot herselfe, and thought she had been drowned. And thus whilst Beautie on her beauty gazed, Who then yet living, deemd she had been dying, And yet in death, some hope of life espying, At her own rare perfections so amazed; Twixt joy and griefe, yet with a smyling frowning, The glorious sun-beames of her eyes bright shining, And shee on her owne destiny divining, Threw in herselfe, to save herselfe by drowning. The Well of Nectar, pav'd with pearle and gold, Where shee remaines for all eyes to behold. AMOUR. 10. Oft taking pen in hand, with words to cast my woes, Beginning to account the sum of all my cares, I well perceive my griefe innumerable growes, And styll in reckonings rise more millions of dispayres. And thus deviding of my fatall howres, The payments of my love I read, and reading crosse, And in substracting, set my sweets unto my sowres, Th'arerage of my joyes, directs me to my losse. And thus mine eyes, a debtor to thine eye, Who by extortion gaineth all theyr lookes, My hart hath payd such grievous usury, That all her wealth lyes in thy Beauties bookes. And all is thine which hath been due to mee, And I a Banckrupt quite undone by thee. AMOUR. 11. Thine eyes taught mee the Alphabet of love, To con my Cros-rowe ere I learn'd to spell: For I was apt a scholler like to prove, Gave mee sweet lookes when as I learned well. Vowes were my vowels when I then begun At my first Lesson in thy sacred name, My consonants the next when I had done, Words consonant, and sounding to thy fame. My liquids then were liquid christall teares, My cares my mutes so mute to crave reliefe, My dolefull Dypthongs were my lives dispaires, Redoubling sighes the accents of my griefe: My loves Schoole-mistris now hath taught me so, That I can reade a story of my woe. AMOUR. 12. Some Athiest or vile Infidell in love, When I doe speake of thy divinitie, May blaspheme thus, and say, I flatter thee: And onely write, my skill in verse to prove. See myracles, yee unbeleeving see, A dumbe-borne Muse made to expresse the mind, A cripple hand to write, yet lame by kind, One by thy name, the other touching thee. Blind were mine eyes, till they were seene of thine, And mine eares deafe, by thy fame healed be, My vices cur'd, by vertues sprung from thee, My hopes reviv'd which long in grave had lyne. All uncleane thoughts, foule spirits cast out in mee, By thy great power, and by strong fayth in thee. AMOUR. 13. Cleere Ankor, on whose silver-sanded shore, My soule-shrinde Saint, my faire Idea lyes: O blessed Brooke, whose milk-white Swans adore That christall streame refined by her eyes. Where sweet Myrh-breathing Zephyre in the spring, Gently distils his Nectar-dropping showers: Where Nightingals in Arden sit and sing, Amongst those dainty dew-empearled flowers. Say thus fayre Brooke when thou shalt see thy Queene, Loe, heere thy Shepheard spent his wandring yeeres: And in these shades (deer Nimphe) he oft hath been, And heere to thee he sacrifiz'd his teares. Fayre Arden, thou my Tempe art alone, And thou sweet Ankor art my Helicon. AMOUR. 14. Looking into the glasse of my youths miseries, I see the ugly face of my deformed cares, With withered browes, all wrinckled with dispaires, That for my mis-spent youth the tears fel from my eyes. Then in these teares, the mirrors of these eyes, Thy fayrest youth and Beautie doe I see, Imprinted in my teares by looking still on thee: Thus midst a thousand woes, ten thousand joyes arise. Yet in these joyes, the shadowes of my good, In this fayre limmed ground as white as snow, Paynted the blackest Image of my woe, With murthering hands imbrud in mine own blood. And in thys Image his darke clowdy eyes, My life, my youth, my love, I heere Anotamize. AMOUR. 15. Now Love, if thou wilt prove a Conqueror, Subdue thys Tyrant ever martyring mee, And but appoint me for her Tormentor, Then for a Monarch will I honour thee. My hart shall be the prison for my fayre, Ile fetter her in chaines of purest love, My sighes shall stop the passage of the ayre: This punishment the pittilesse may move. With teares out of the Channels of mine eyes, She'st quench her thirst as duly as they fall: Kinde words unkindest meate I can devise, My sweet, my faire, my good, my best of all. Ile binde her then with my torne-tressed haire, And racke her with a thousand holy wishes, Then on a place prepared for her there, Ile execute her with a thousand kisses. Thus will I crucifie my cruell shee, Thus Ile plague her which so hath plagued mee. AMOUR. 16. Vertues Idea in virginitie, By inspiration, came conceav'd with thought: The time is come delivered she must be, Where first my Love into the world was brought. Unhappy Borne, of all unhappy day, So luckles was my Babes nativity: Saturne chiefe Lord of the Ascendant lay, The wandring Moone in earths triplicitie. Now, or by chaunce, or heavens hie providence, His Mother died, and by her Legacie, (Fearing the stars presaged influence,) Bequeath'd his wardship to my soveraignes eye; Where hunger-starven, wanting lookes to live, Still empty gorg'd, with cares consumption pynde, Salt luke-warme teares shee for his drinke did give, And ever-more with sighes he supt and dynde. And thus (poore Orphan) lying in distresse, Cryes in his pangs, God helpe the motherlesse. AMOUR. 17. If ever wonder could report a wonder, Or tongue of wonder worth could tell a wonder thought, Or ever joy expresse, what perfect joy hath taught, Then wonder, tongue, then joy, might wel report a wonder. Could all conceite conclude, which past conceite admireth, Or could mine eye but ayme, her objects past perfection, My words might imitate my deerest thoughts direction: And my soule then obtaine which so my soule desireth. Were not Invention stauld, treading Inventions maze, Or my swift-winged Muse tyred by too hie flying, Did not perfection still on her perfection gaze, Whilst Love (my Phœnix bird) in her own flame is dying, Invention and my Muse, perfection and her love, Should teach the world to know the wonder that I prove. AMOUR. 18. Some when in ryme they of their Loves doe tell, With flames and lightning their exordiums paynt, Some invocate the Gods, some spirits of Hell, And heaven, and earth, doe with their woes acquaint. Elizia is too hie a seate for mee, I wyll not come in Stixe nor Phlegiton, The Muses nice, the Furies cruell be, I lyke not Limbo, nor blacke Acheron, Spightfull Errinis frights mee with her lookes, My manhood dares not with foule Ate mell, I quake to looke on Hecats charming bookes, I styll feare bugbeares in Apollos Cell. I passe not for Minerva nor Astræa, But ever call upon divine Idea. AMOUR. 19. If those ten Regions registred by Fame, By theyr ten Sibils have the world controld, Who prophecied of Christ or ere he came, And of hys blessed birth before fore-told. That man-god now of whom they dyd divine, This earth of those sweet Prophets hath bereft, And since the world to judgement doth declyne, In steed of ten, one Sibil to us left. Thys, pure Idea, vertues right Idea, Shee of whom Merlin long tyme did fore-tell, Excelling her of Delphos or Cumæa, Whose lyfe doth save a thousand soules from hell: That life (I meane) which doth Religion teach, And by example, true repentance preach. AMOUR. 20. Reading sometyme, my sorrowes to beguile, I find old Poets hylls and floods admire. One, he doth wonder monster-breeding Nyle, Another, mervailes Sulphure Aetnas fire. Now broad-brymd Indus, then of Pindus height, Pelion and Ossa, frosty Caucase old, The Delian Cynthus, then Olympus weight, Slow Arrer, frantick Gallus, Cydnus cold. Some Ganges, Ister, and of Tagus tell, Some whir-poole Po, and slyding Hypasis, Some old Pernassus, where the Muses dwell, Some Helycon, and some faire Simois, A fooles thinke I, had you Idea seene, Poore Brookes and Banks had no such wonders beene. AMOUR. 21. Letters and lynes we see are soone defaced, Mettles doe waste, and fret with cankers rust, The Diamond shall once consume to dust, And freshest colours with foule staines disgraced. Paper and yncke, can paynt but naked words, To write with blood, of force offends the sight, And if with teares, I find them all too light: And sighes and signes a silly hope affoords. O sweetest shadow, how thou serv'st my turne, Which still shalt be as long as there is Sunne, Nor whilst the world is, never shall be done, Whilst Moone shall shyne by night, or any fire shall burne. That every thing whence shadow doth proceede, May in his shadow my Loves story reade. AMOUR. 22. My hart imprisoned in a hopeles Ile, Peopled with Armies of pale jealous eyes, The shores beset with thousand secret spyes, Must passe by ayre, or else dye in exile. He framd him wings with feathers of his thought, Which by theyr nature learn'd to mount the skye, And with the same he practised to flye, Till he himselfe thys Eagles art had taught. Thus soring still, not looking once below, So neere thyne eyes celestiall sunne aspyred, That with the rayes his wafting pyneons fired. Thus was the wanton cause of hys owne woe. Downe fell he in thy Beauties Ocean drenched, Yet there he burnes, in fire thats never quenched. AMOUR. 23. Wonder of Heaven, glasse of divinitie, Rare beauty, Natures joy, perfections Mother, The worke of that united Trinitie, Wherein each fayrest part excelleth other. Loves Methridate, the purest of perfection, Celestiall Image, Load-stone of desire, The soules delight, the sences true direction, Sunne of the world, thou hart revyving fire. Why should'st thou place thy Trophies in those eyes, Which scorne the honor that is done to thee, Or make my pen her name imortalize, Who in her pride sdaynes once to looke on mee. It is thy heaven within her face to dwell, And in thy heaven, there onely is my hell. AMOUR. 24. Our floods-Queene Thames, for shyps &amp; Swans is crowned, And stately Severne, for her shores is praised, The christall Trent, for Foords &amp; fishe renowned, And Avons fame, to Albyons Clives is raysed. Carlegion Chester, vaunts her holy Dee, Yorke, many wonders of her Ouse can tell, The Peake her Dove, whose bancks so fertill bee, And Kent will say, her Medway doth excell. Cotswoold commends her Isis and her Tame, Our Northern borders boast of Tweeds faire flood, Our Westerne parts extoll theyr Wilys fame, And old Legea brags of Danish blood: Ardens sweet Ankor let thy glory be, That fayre Idea shee doth live by thee. AMOUR. 25. The glorious sunne went blushing to his bed, When my soules sunne from her fayre Cabynet, Her golden beames had now discovered, Lightning the world, eclipsed by his set. Some muz'd to see the earth envy the ayre, Which from her lyps exhald refined sweet, A world to see, yet how he joyd to heare The dainty grasse make musicke with her feete. But my most mervaile was when from the skyes, So Comet-like each starre advaunc'd her lyght, As though the heaven had now awak'd her eyes, And summond Angels to thys blessed sight. No clowde was seene, but christaline the ayre, Laughing for joy upon my lovely fayre. AMOUR. 26. Cupid, dumbe Idoll, peevish Saint of love, No more shalt thou nor Saint nor Idoll be, No God art thou, a Goddesse shee doth prove, Of all thine honour shee hath robbed thee. Thy Bowe halfe broke, is peec'd with olde desire, Her Bowe is beauty, with ten thousand strings, Of purest gold, tempred with vertues fire: The least able to kyll an hoste of Kings. Thy shafts be spent, and shee (to warre appointed) Hydes in those christall quivers of her eyes, More Arrowes with hart-piercing mettel poynted, Then there be starres at midnight in the skyes. With these, she steales mens harts for her reliefe, Yet happy he thats robd of such a thiefe. AMOUR. 27. My love makes hote the fire whose heat is spent, The water, moysture from my teares deriveth: And my strong sighes, the ayres weake force reviveth. This love, tears, sighes, maintaine each one his element. The fire, unto my love, compare a painted fire, The water, to my teares, as drops to Oceans be, The ayre, unto my sighes, as Eagle to the flie, The passions of dispaire, but joyes to my desire. Onely my love is in the fire ingraved, Onely my teares by Oceans may be gessed, Onely my sighes are by the ayre expressed, Yet fire, water, ayre, of nature not deprived. Whilst fire, water, ayre, twixt heaven &amp; earth shall be, My love, my teares, my sighes, extinguisht cannot be. AMOUR. 28. Some wits there be, which lyke my method well, And say my verse runnes in a lofty vayne, Some say I have a passing pleasing straine, Some say that in my humor I excell. Some, who reach not the height of my conceite, They say, (as Poets doe) I use to fayne, And in bare words paynt out my passions payne. Thus sundry men, their sundry minds repeate. I passe not I how men affected be, Nor who commend or discommend my verse, It pleaseth me if I my plaints rehearse, And in my lynes if shee my love may see. I prove my verse autentique still in thys, Who writes my Mistres praise, can never write amisse. AMOUR. 29. O eyes, behold your happy Hesperus, That luckie Load-starre of eternall light, Left as that sunne alone to comfort us, When our worlds sunne is vanisht out of sight. O starre of starres, fayre Planet mildly mooving, O Lampe of vertue, sun-bright, ever shyning, O mine eyes Comet, so admyr'd by loving, O cleerest day-starre, never more declyning. O our worlds wonder, crowne of heaven above, Thrice happy be those eyes which may behold thee, Lov'd more then life, yet onely art his love, Whose glorious hand immortall hath enrold thee. O blessed fayre, now vaile those heavenly eyes, That I may blesse mee at thy sweet arise. AMOUR. 30. Three sorts of Serpents doe resemble thee, That daungerous eye-killing Cockatrice, Th'inchaunting Syren, which doth so entice, The weeping Crocodile: these vile pernicious three. The Basiliske his nature takes from thee, Who for my life in secrete waite do'st lye, And to my hart send'st poyson from thine eye, Thus do I feele the paine, the cause, yet cannot see. Faire-mayd no more, but Mayr-maid be thy name, Who with thy sweet aluring harmony Hast playd the thiefe, and stolne my hart from me, And like a Tyrant mak'st my griefe thy game. Thou Crocodile, who when thou hast me slaine, Lament'st my death, with teares of thy disdaine. AMOUR. 31. Sitting alone, love bids me goe and write, Reason plucks backe, commaunding me to stay, Boasting that shee doth still direct the way, Els senceles love could never once endite. Love growing angry, vexed at the spleene, And scorning Reasons maymed Argument, Straight taxeth Reason, wanting to invent, Where shee with Love conversing hath not beene. Reason reproched with this coy disdaine, Dispighteth Love, and laugheth at her folly, And Love contemning Reasons reason wholy, Thought her in weight too light by many a graine. Reason put back, doth out of sight remove, And Love alone finds reason in my love. AMOUR. 32. Those teares which quench my hope, still kindle my desire, Those sighes which coole my hart, are coles unto my love, Disdayne Ice to my life, is to my soule a fire, With teares, sighes, &amp; disdaine, thys contrary I prove. Quenchles desire, makes hope burne, dryes my teares, Love heats my hart, my hart-heat my sighes warmeth, With my soules fire, my life disdaine out-weares, Desire, my love, my soule, my hope, hart, &amp; life charmeth. My hope becomes a friend to my desire, My hart imbraceth Love, Love doth imbrace my hart, My life a Phœnix is in my soules fire, From thence (they vow) they never will depart. Desire, my love, my soule, my hope, my hart, my life, With teares, sighes, and disdaine, shall have immortal strife. AMOUR. 33. Whilst thus mine eyes doe surfet with delight, My wofull hart imprisond in my breast, Wishing to be trans-formd into my sight, To looke on her by whom mine eyes are blest. But whilst mine eyes thus greedily doe gaze, Behold, their objects over-soone depart, And treading in thys never-ending maze, Wish now to be trans-formd into my hart. My hart surcharg'd with thoughts, sighes in abundance raise, My eyes made dim with lookes, poure down a flood of tears, And whilst my hart and eye, envy each others praise, My dying lookes and thoughts are peiz'd in equall feares. And thus whilst sighes and teares together doe contende, Each one of these, doth ayde unto the other lende. AMOUR. 34. My fayre, looke from those turrets of thine eyes, Into the Ocean of a troubled minde, Where my poore soule, the Barke of sorrow lyes, Left to the mercy of the waves and winde. See where shee flotes, laden with purest love, Which those fayre Ilands of thy lookes affoord, Desiring yet a thousand deaths to prove, Then so to cast her Ballast over boord. See how her sayles be rent, her tacklings worne, Her Cable broke, her surest Anchor lost, Her Marryners doe leave her all forlorne, Yet how shee bends towards that blessed Coast. Loe where she drownes, in stormes of thy displeasure, Whose worthy prize should have enritcht thy treasure. AMOUR. 35. See chaste Diana, where my harmles hart, Rouz'd from my breast, his sure and safest layre, Nor chaste by hound, nor forc'd by Hunters arte, Yet see how right he comes unto my fayre. See how my Deere comes to thy Beauties stand, And there stands gazing on those darting eyes, Whilst from theyr rayes by Cupids skilfull hand, Into his hart the piercing Arrow flyes. See how hee lookes upon his bleeding wound, Whilst thus he panteth for his latest breath, And looking on thee, falls upon the ground, Smyling, as though he gloried in his death. And wallowing in his blood, some lyfe yet laft, His stone-cold lips doth kisse the blessed shaft. AMOUR. 36. Sweete sleepe so arm'd with Beauties arrowes darting, Sleepe in thy Beauty, Beauty in sleepe appeareth, Sleepe lightning Beauty, Beauty sleepes darknes cleereth, Sleepes wonder Beauty, wonders to worlds imparting. Sleep watching Beauty, Beauty waking, sleepe guarding, Beauty in sleepe, sleepe in Beauty charmed, Sleepes aged coldnes, with Beauties fire warmed, Sleepe with delight, Beauty with love rewarding. Sleepe and Beauty, with equall forces stryving, Beauty her strength unto sleepes weaknes lending, Sleepe with Beauty, Beauty with sleepe contending, Yet others force, the others force reviving: And others foe, the others foe imbrace, Myne eyes beheld thys conflict in thy face. AMOUR. 37. I ever love, where never hope appeares, Yet hope drawes on my never-hoping care, And my lives hope would die but for dyspaire, My never certaine joy, breeds ever-certaine feares. Uncertaine-dread, gyves wings unto my hope, Yet my hopes wings are loden so with feare, As they cannot ascend to my hopes spheare, Yet feare gyves them more then a heavenly scope: Yet thys large roome is bounded with dyspaire, So my love is styll fettered with vaine hope, And lyberty deprives hym of hys scope, And thus am I imprisond in the ayre; Then sweet Dispaire, awhile hold up thy head, Or all my hope for sorrow will be dead. AMOUR. 38. If chaste and pure devotion of my youth, Or glorie of my Aprill-springing yeeres, Unfained love, in naked simple truth, A thousand vowes, a thousand sighes and teares: Or if a world of faithfull service done, Words, thoughts, and deeds, devoted to her honor, Or eyes that have beheld her as theyr sunne, With admiration, ever looking on her. A lyfe, that never joyd but in her love, A soule, that ever hath ador'd her name, A fayth, that time nor fortune could not move, A Muse, that unto heaven hath raisd her fame. Though these, nor these, deserve to be imbraced, Yet faire unkinde, too good to be disgraced. AMOUR. 39. Die, die, my soule, and never taste of joy, If sighes, nor teares, nor vowes, nor prayers can move, If fayth and zeale be but esteemd a toy, And kindnes, be unkindnes in my love. Then with unkindnes, Love revenge thy wrong, O sweet'st revenge that ere the heavens gave, And with the Swan record thy dying song, And praise her still to thy untimely grave. So in loves death shall loves perfection prove, That love divine which I have borne to you, By doome concealed to the heavens above, That yet the world unworthy never knewe, Whose pure Idea never tongue exprest, I feele, you know, the heavens can tell the rest. AMOUR. 40. O thou unkindest fayre, most fayrest shee, In thine eyes tryumph murthering my poore hart, Now doe I sweare by heavens, before we part, My halfe-slaine hart shall take revenge on thee. Thy Mother dyd her lyfe to Death resigne, And thou an Angell art, and from above, Thy father was a man, that will I prove, Yet thou a Goddesse art, and so divine. And thus if thou be not of humaine kinde, A Bastard on both sides needes must thou be, Our Lawes alow no Land to basterdy: By natures Lawes we thee a Bastard finde. Then hence to heaven unkind, for thy childs part, Goe Bastard goe, for sure of thence thou art. AMOUR. 41. Rare of-spring of my thoughts, my deerest Love, Begot by fancy, on sweet hope exhortive, In whom all purenes with perfection strove, Hurt in the Embryon, makes my joyes abhortive. And you my sighes, Symtomas of my woe, The dolefull Anthems of my endlesse care, Lyke idle Ecchoes ever aunswering: so, The mournfull accents of my loves dispayre. And thou Conceite, the shadow of my blisse, Declyning with the setting of my sunne, Springing with that, and fading straight with this, Now hast thou end, and now thou wast begun. Now was thy pryme, and loe, now is thy waine, Now wast thou borne, now in thy cradle slayne. AMOUR. 42. Plac'd in the forlorne hope of all dispayre, Against the Forte where Beauties Army lies, Assayld with death, yet arm'd with gastly feare, Loe thus my love, my lyfe, my fortune tryes. Wounded with Arrowes from thy lightning eyes, My tongue in payne, my harts counsels bewraying, My rebell thought for me in Ambushe lyes, To my lyves foe her Chieftaine still betraying. Record my love in Ocean waves (unkind,) Cast my desarts into the open ayre, Commit my words unto the fleeting wind, Cancell my name, and blot it with dispayre, So shall I be, as I had never beene, Nor my disgraces to the world be seene. AMOUR. 43. Why doe I speake of joy, or write of love, When my hart is the very Den of horror, And in my soule the paynes of hell I prove, With all his torments and infernall terror. Myne eyes want teares thus to bewayle my woe, My brayne is dry with weeping all too long, My sighes be spent with griefe and sighing so, And I want words for to expresse my wrong. But still distracted in loves Lunacy, And Bedlam like thus raving in my griefe, Now rayle upon her hayre, now on her eye, Now call her Goddesse, then I call her thiefe, Now I deny her, then I doe confesse her, Now doe I curse her, then againe I blesse her. AMOUR. 44. My hart the Anvile where my thoughts doe beate, My words the hammers, fashioning my desires, My breast the forge, including all the heate, Love is the fuell which maintaines the fire. My sighes, the bellowes which the flame increaseth, Filling myne eares with noyse and nightly groning, Toyling with paine, my labour never ceaseth, In greevous passions my woes styll bemoning. Myne eyes with teares against the fire stryving, With scorching gleed my hart to cynders turneth: But with those drops the coles againe revyving, Still more and more unto my torment burneth. With Sisiphus thus doe I role the stone, And turne the wheele with damned Ixion. AMOUR. 45. Blacke pytchy Night, companyon of my woe, The Inne of care, the Nurse of drery sorrow, Why lengthnest thou thy darkest howres so, Still to prolong my long tyme lookt-for morrow? Thou Sable shadow, Image of dispayre, Portraite of hell, the ayres black mourning weed, Recorder of revenge, remembrancer of care, The shadow and the vaile of every sinfull deed. Death like to thee, so lyve thou still in death, The grave of joy, pryson of dayes delight, Let heavens withdraw their sweet Ambrozian breath, Nor Moone nor stars lend thee their shining light. For thou alone renew'st that olde desire, Which still torments me in dayes burning fire. AMOUR. 46. Sweet secrecie, what tongue can tell thy worth? What mortall pen suffyciently can prayse thee? What curious Pensill serves to lim thee forth? What Muse hath power, above thy height to raise thee? Strong locke of kindnesse, Closet of loves store, Harts Methridate, the soules preservative, O vertue, which all vertues doe adore, Cheefe good, from whom all good things we derive. O rare effect, true bond of friendships measure, Conceite of Angels, which all wisdom teachest, O richest Casket of all heavenly treasure, In secret silence, which such wonders preachest, O purest merror, wherein men may see The lively Image of Divinitie. AMOUR. 47. The golden Sunne upon his fiery wheeles, The horned Ram doth in his course awake: And of just length our night and day doth make, Flinging the Fishes backward with his heeles. Then to the Tropicke takes his full Careere, Trotting his sun-steeds till the Palfrays sweat, Bayting the Lyon in his furious heat, Till Virgins smyles doe sound his sweet reteere. But my faire Planet, who directs me still, Unkindly, such distemprature doth bring, Makes Summer Winter, Autumne in the Spring, Crossing sweet nature by unruly will. Such is the sunne, who guides my youthfull season, Whose thwarting course, deprives the world of reason. AMOUR. 48. Who list to praise the dayes delicious lyght, Let him compare it to her heavenly eye: The sun-beames to that lustre of her sight, So may the learned like the similie. The mornings Crimson, to her lyps alike, The sweet of Eden, to her breathes perfume, The fayre Elizia, to her fayrer cheeke, Unto her veynes, the onely Phœnix plume. The Angels tresses, to her tressed hayre, The Galixia, to her more then white: Praysing the fayrest, compare it to my faire, Still naming her, in naming all delight. So may he grace all these in her alone, Superlative in all comparison. AMOUR. 49. Define my love, and tell the joyes of heaven, Expresse my woes, and shew the paynes of hell, Declare what fate unlucky starres have given, And aske a world upon my life to dwell. Make knowne that fayth, unkindnes could not move, Compare my worth with others base desert, Let vertue be the tuch-stone of my love, So may the heavens reade wonders in my hart. Behold the Clowdes which have eclips'd my sunne, And view the crosses which my course doth let, Tell mee, if ever since the world begunne, So faire a Morning had so foule a set? And by all meanes, let black unkindnes prove, The patience of so rare divine a love. AMOUR. 50. When first I ended, then I first began, The more I travell, further from my rest, Where most I lost, there most of all I wan, Pyned with hunger, rysing from a feast. Mee thinks I flee, yet want I legs to goe, Wise in conceite, in acte a very sot, Ravisht with joy, amidst a hell of woe, What most I seeme, that surest am I not. I build my hopes, a world above the skye, Yet with the Mole, I creepe into the earth, In plenty, am I starv'd with penury, And yet I surfet in the greatest dearth. I have, I want, dispayre, and yet desire, Burn'd in a Sea of Ice, &amp; drown'd amidst a fire. AMOUR. 51. Goe you my lynes, Embassadors of love, With my harts trybute to her conquering eyes, From whence, if you one teare of pitty move For all my woes, that onely shall suffise. When you Minerva in the sunne behold, At her perfection stand you then and gaze, Where, in the compasse of a Marygold, Meridianis sits within a maze. And let Invention of her beauty vaunt, When Dorus sings his sweet Pamelas love, And tell the Gods, Mars is predominant, Seated with Sol, and weares Minervas glove. And tell the world, that in the world there is A heaven on earth, on earth no heaven but this. FINIS. ENDIMION and Phœbe. IDEAS LATMVS. Phœbus erit nostri princeps, et carminis Author. TO THE EXCELLENT and most accomplish't Ladie: Lucie Countesse of Bedford. Great Ladie, essence of my cheefest good, Of the most pure and finest tempred spirit, Adorn'd with gifts, enobled by thy blood, Which by discent true vertue do'st inherit: That vertue which no fortune can deprive, Which thou by birth tak'st from thy gracious mother, Whose royall mindes with equall motion strive, Which most in honor shall excell the other; Unto thy fame my Muse her selfe shall taske, Which rain'st upon mee thy sweet golden showers, And but thy selfe, no subject will I aske, Upon whose prayse my soule shall spend her powers. Sweet Ladie then, grace this poore Muse of mine, Whose faith, whose zeale, whose life, whose all is thine. Your Honors humbly divoted, Michaell Drayton. [Rouland, when first I red thy stately rymes] Rouland, when first I red thy stately rymes, In Sheepheards weedes, when yet thou liv'dst unknowne, Not seene in publique in those former tymes, But unto Ankor tund'st thy Pype alone, I then beheld thy chaste Ideas fame, Put on the wings of thine immortall stile, Whose rarest vertues and deserved name, Thy Muse renown's throughout this glorious Ile, Thy lines, like to the Lawrells pleasant shade, In after ages shall adorne her Herse, Nor never can her beauties glory fade, Deckt in the collours of thy happy verse, Thy fiery spirit mounts up unto the skye, And what thou writ'st, lives to Eternitye. E. P. To Idea. Amidst those shades wherein the Muses sit, Thus to Idea, my Idea sings, Support of wisedome, better force of Wit: Which by desert, desert to honour brings, Borne to create good thoughts by thy rare woorth, Whom Nature with her bounteous store doth blesse, More excellent then Art can set thee forth; Happy in more, then praises can expresse: Which by thy selfe shalt make thy selfe continue, When all worlds glory shall be cleane forgot, Thus I the least of skilfull Arts retinue: Write in thy prayse which time shall never blot; Heaven made thee what thou art, till worlds be done, Thy fame shall florish like the rising Sunne. S. G. ENDIMION &amp; PHŒBE. Ideas Latmus. In I-ONIA whence sprang old Poets fame, From whom that Sea did first derive her name, The blessed bed whereon the Muses lay, Beauty of Greece, the pride of Asia, Whence Archelaus whom times historifie, First unto Athens brought Phylosophie. In this faire Region on a goodly Plaine, Stretching her bounds unto the bordring Maine, The Mountaine Latmus over-lookes the Sea, Smiling to see the Ocean billowes play: Latmus, where young Endimion usd to keepe His fairest flock of silver-fleeced sheepe. To whom Silvanus often would resort, At barly-breake to see the Satyres sport; And when rude Pan his Tabret list to sound, To see the faire Nymphes foote it in a round, Under the trees which on this Mountaine grew, As yet the like Arabia never knew: For all the pleasures Nature could devise, Within this plot she did imparadize; And great Diana of her speciall grace, With Vestall rytes had hallowed all the place: Upon this Mount there stood a stately Grove, Whose reaching armes, to clip the Welkin strove, Of tufted Cedars, and the branching Pine, Whose bushy tops themselves doe so intwine, As seem'd when Nature first this work begun, Shee then conspir'd against the piercing Sun; Under whose covert (thus divinely made) Phœbus greene Laurell florisht in the shade: Faire Venus Mirtile, Mars his warlike Fyrre, Minervas Olive, and the weeping Myrhe, The patient Palme, which thrives in spite of hate, The Popler, to Alcides consecrate; Which Nature in such order had disposed, And there-withall these goodly walkes inclosed, As serv'd for hangings and rich Tapestry, To beautifie this stately Gallery: Imbraudring these in curious trailes along, The clustred Grapes, the golden Citrons hung, More glorious then the precious fruite were these, Kept by the Dragon in Hesperides; Or gorgious Arras in rich colours wrought, With silk from Affrick, or from Indie brought: Out of thys soyle sweet bubling Fountains crept, As though for joy the sencelesse stones had wept; With straying channels dauncing sundry wayes, With often turnes, like to a curious Maze: Which breaking forth, the tender grasse bedewed, Whose silver sand with orient Pearle was strewed, Shadowed with Roses and sweet Eglantine, Dipping theyr sprayes into this christalline: From which the byrds the purple berries pruned, And to theyr loves their small recorders tuned. The Nightingale, woods Herauld of the Spring, The whistling Woosell, Mavis carroling, Tuning theyr trebbles to the waters fall, Which made the musicque more angelicall: Whilst gentle Zephyre murmuring among, Kept tyme, and bare the burthen to the song. About whose brims, refresht with dainty showers, Grew Amaranthus, and sweet Gilliflowers, The Marigold, Phœbus beloved frend, The Moly, which from sorcery doth defend: Violet, Carnation, Balme and Cassia, Ideas Primrose, coronet of May. Above this Grove a gentle faire ascent, Which by degrees of Milk-white Marble went: Upon the top, a Paradise was found, With which, Nature this miracle had crownd; Empald with Rocks of rarest precious stone, Which like the flames of Aetna brightly shone; And serv'd as Lanthornes furnished with light, To guide the wandring passengers by night: For which fayre Phœbe sliding from her Sphere, Used oft times to come and sport her there. And from the Azure starry-painted Sky, Embalmd the bancks with precious lunary: That now her Menalus shee quite forsooke, And unto Latmus wholy her betooke, And in this place her pleasure us'd to take, And all was for her sweet Endimions sake: Endimion, the lovely Shepheards boy, Endimion, great Phœbes onely joy, Endimion, in whose pure-shining eyes, The naked Faries daunst the heydegies. The shag-haird Satyrs Mountain-climing race, Have been made tame by gazing in his face. For this boyes love, the water-Nymphs have wept Stealing oft times to kisse him whilst he slept: And tasting once the Nectar of his breath, Surfet with sweet, and languish unto death; And Jove oft-times bent to lascivious sport, And comming where Endimion did resort, Hath courted him, inflamed with desire, Thinking some Nymph was cloth'd in boyes attire. And often-times the simple rural Swaines, Beholding him in crossing or'e the Plaines, Imagined, Apollo from above Put on this shape, to win some Maidens love. This Shepheard, Phœbe ever did behold, Whose love already had her thoughts controld; From Latmus top (her stately throne) shee rose, And to Endimion downe beneath shee goes. Her Brothers beames now had shee layd aside, Her horned cressent, and her full-fac'd pride: For had shee come adorned with her light, No mortall eye could have endur'd the sight; But like a Nymph, crown'd with a flowrie twine, And not like Phœbe, as herselfe divine. An Azur'd Mantle purfled with a vaile, Which in the Ayre puft like a swelling saile, Embosted Rayne-bowes did appeare in silk, With wavie streames as white as mornings Milk: Which ever as the gentle Ayre did blow, Still with the motion seem'd to ebb and flow: About her neck a chayne twise twenty fold, Of Rubyes, set in lozenges of gold; Trust up in trammels, and in curious pleats, With spheary circles falling on her teats. A dainty smock of Cipresse, fine and thin, Or'e cast with curls next to her Lilly skin: Throgh which the purenes of the same did show Lyke Damaske-roses strew'd with flakes of snow, Discovering all her stomack to the waste, With branches of sweet circling veynes enchaste. A Coronet she ware of Mirtle bowes, Which gave a shadow to her Ivory browes. No smother beauty maske did beauty smother “Great lights dim lesse yet burn not one another, Nature abhorrs to borrow from the Mart, “Simples fit beauty, fie on drugs and Art. Thus came shee where her love Endimion lay, Who with sweet Carrols sang the night away; And as it is the Shepheards usuall trade, Oft on his pype a Roundelay he playd. As meeke he was as any Lambe might be, Nor never lyv'd a fayrer youth then he: His dainty hand, the snow it selfe dyd stayne, Or her to whom Jove showr'd in golden rayne: From whose sweet palme the liquid Pearle dyd swell, Pure as the drops of Aganippas Well: Cleere as the liquor which fayre Hebe spylt; Hys sheephooke silver, damask'd all with gilt. The staffe it selfe, of snowie Ivory, Studded with Currall, tipt with Ebony; His tresses, of the Ravens shyning black, Stragling in curles along his manly back. The balls which nature in his eyes had set, Lyke Diamonds inclosing Globes of Jet: Which sparkled from their milky lids out-right, Lyke fayre Orions heaven-adorning light. The stars on which her heavenly eyes were bent, And fixed still with lovely blandishment, For whom so oft disguised shee was seene, As shee Celestiall Phœbe had not beene: Her dainty Buskins lac'd unto the knee, Her pleyted Frock, tuck'd up accordingly: A Nymph-like huntresse, arm'd with bow &amp; dart About the woods she scoures the long-liv'd Hart. She climes the mountains with the light-foot Fauns And with the Satyrs scuds it or'e the Launes. In Musicks sweet delight shee shewes her skill, Quavering the Cithron nimbly with her quill, Upon each tree she carves Endimions name In Gordian knots, with Phœbe to the same: To kill him Venson now she pitch'd her toyles, And to this lovely Raunger brings the spoyles; And thus whilst she by chaste desire is led Unto the Downes where he his fayre Flocks fed, Neere to a Grove she had Endimion spide, Where he was fishing by a River side Under a Popler, shadowed from the Sun, Where merrily to court him she begun: Sweet boy (qd. she) take what thy hart can wish, When thou doost angle would I were a fish, When thou art sporting by the silver Brooks, Put in thy hand thou need'st no other hooks; Hard harted boy Endimion looke on mee, Nothing on earth I hold too deere for thee: I am a Nimph and not of humaine blood, Begot by Pan on Isis sacred flood: When I was borne upon that very day, Phœbus was seene the Reveller to play: In Joves hye house the Gods assembled all, And Juno held her sumptuous Festivall, Oceanus that hower was dauncing spy'de, And Tython seene to frolick with his Bride, The Halcions that season sweetly sang, And all the shores, with shouting Sea-Nymphes rang, And on that day, my birth to memorize, The Shepheards hold a solemne sacrifice: The chast Diana nurst mee in her lap, And I suckt Nectar from her Downe-soft pap. The Well wherein this body bathed first, Who drinks thereof, shall never after thirst; The water hath the Lunacie appeased, And by the vertue, cureth all diseased; The place wherein my bare feete touch the mold, Made up in balls, for Pomander is sold. See, see, these hands have robd the Snow of white, These dainty fingers, organs of delight: Behold these lyps, the Load-stones of desire, Whose words inchant, like Amphyons well-tun'd lyre, This foote, Arts just proportion doth reveale, Signing the earth with heavens own manuel seale. Goe, play the wanton, I will tend thy flock, And wait the howres as duly as a clock; Ile deck thy Ram with bells, and wreathes of Bay, And gild his hornes upon the sheering day; And with a garlond crown thee Shepheards king, And thou shalt lead the gay Gyrles in a ring; Birds with their wings shall fan thee in the Sun, And all the fountaynes with pure Wine shall run, I have a Quier of dainty Turtle-doves, And they shall sit and sweetly sing our loves: Ile lay thee on the Swans soft downy plume, And all the Winde shall gently breath perfume, Ile plat thy locks with many a curious pleate, And chafe thy temples with a sacred heate; The Muses still shall keepe thee company, And lull thee with inchaunting harmony; If not all these, yet let my vertues move thee, A chaster Nymph Endimion cannot love thee. But he imagin'd she some Nymph had been, Because shee was apparrelled in greene; Or happily, some of fayre Floras trayne, Which oft did use to sport upon the Plaine: He tels her, he was Phœbes servant sworne, And oft in hunting had her Quiver borne, And that to her virginity he vowed, Which in no hand by Venus was alowed; Then unto her a Catalogue recites Of Phœbes Statutes, and her hallowed Rites, And of the grievous penalty inflicted, On such as her chast lawes had interdicted: Now, he requests, that shee would stand aside, Because the fish her shadow had espide; Then he intreats her that she would be gone, And at this time to let him be alone; Then turnes him from her in an angry sort, And frownes and chafes that shee had spoil'd his sport. And then he threatens her, if she did stay, And told her, great Diana came this way. But for all this, this Nymph would not forbeare, But now she smoothes his crispy-curled haire, And when hee (rudely) will'd her to refrayne, Yet scarcely ended, she begins agayne: Thy Ewes (qd. she) with Milk shall daily spring, And to thy profit yeerely Twins shall bring, And thy fayre flock, (a wonder to behold) Shall have their fleeces turn'd to burnisht gold; Thy batefull pasture to thy wanton Thewes, Shall be refresht with Nectar-dropping dewes, The Oakes smooth leaves, sirropt with hony fall, Trickle down drops to quench thy thirst withall: The cruell Tygar will I tame for thee, And gently lay his head upon thy knee; And by my spells, the Wolves jawes will I lock, And (as good Sheepheards) make them gard thy flock, Ile mount thee bravely on a Lyons back, To drive the fomy-tusked Bore to wrack: The brazen-hoofed yelling Bulls Ile yoke, And with my hearbs, the scaly Dragon choke. Thou in great Phœbes Ivory Coche shalt ride, Which drawne by Eagles, in the ayre shall glide: Ile stay the time, it shall not steale away, And twenty Moones as seeming but one day. Behold (fond boy) this Rozen-weeping Pine, This mournfull Larix, dropping Turpentine, This mounting Teda, thus with tempests torne, With incky teares continually to mourne; Looke on this tree, which blubbereth Amber gum, Which seemes to speak to thee, though it be dumb, Which being senceles blocks, as thou do'st see, Weepe at my woes, that thou might'st pitty mee: O thou art young, and fit for loves profession, Like wax which warmed quickly takes impression, Sorrow in time, with floods those eyes shall weare, Whence pitty now cannot extort a teare. Fond boy, with words thou might'st be overcome, “But love surpriz'd the hart, the tongue is dumbe, But as I can, Ile strive to conquer thee; Yet teares, &amp; sighes, my weapons needs must bee. My sighs move trees, rocks melting with my tears, But thou art blind; and cruell stop'st thine eares: Looke in this Well, (if beautie men alow) Though thou be faire, yet I as fayre as thou; I am a Vestall, and a spotles Mayd, Although by love to thee I am betrayd: But sith (unkinde) thou doost my love disdayne, To rocks and hills my selfe I will complaine. Thus with a sigh, her speeches of she broke, The whilst her eyes to him in silence spoke; And from the place this wanton Nymph arose, And up to Latmus all in hast shee goes; Like to a Nymph on shady Citheron, The swift Ismænos, or Thirmodoon, Gliding like Thetis, on the fleet waves borne, Or she which trips upon the eares of Corne; Like Swallowes when in open ayre they strive, Or like the Foule which towring Falcons drive. But whilst the wanton thus pursu'd his sport, Deceitfull Love had undermin'd the Fort, And by a breach (in spight of all deniance,) Entred the Fort which lately made defiance: And with strong siedge had now begirt about The mayden Skonce which held the souldier out. “Love wants his eyes, yet shoots he passing right, His shafts our thoughts, his bowe hee makes our sight. His deadly piles are tempred by such Art, As still directs the Arrowe to the hart: He cannot love, and yet forsooth he will, He sees her not, and yet he sees her still, Hee goes unto the place shee stood upon, And asks the poore soyle whether she was gon; Fayne would he follow her, yet makes delay, Fayne would he goe, and yet fayne would he stay, Hee kist the flowers depressed with her feete, And swears from her they borrow'd all their sweet. Faine would he cast aside this troublous thought, But still like poyson, more and more it wrought, And to himselfe thus often would he say, Heere my Love sat, in this place did shee play, Heere in this Fountaine hath my Goddesse been, And with her presence hath she grac'd this green. Now black-brow'd Night plac'd in her chaire of Jet, Sat wrapt in clouds within her Cabinet, And with her dusky mantle over-spred, The path the Sunny Palfrayes us'd to tred; And Cynthia sitting in her Christall chayre, In all her pompe now rid along her Spheare, The honnied dewe descended in soft showres, Drizled in Pearle upon the tender flowers; And Zephyre husht, and with a whispering gale, Seemed to harken to the Nightingale, Which in the thorny brakes with her sweet song, Unto the silent Night bewrayd her wrong. Now fast by Latmus neere unto a Grove, Which by the mount was shadowed from above, Upon a banck Endimion sat by night, To whom fayre Phœbe lent her frendly light: And sith his flocks were layd them downe to rest, Thus gives his sorrowes passage from his brest; Sweet leaves (qd. he) which with the ayre do tremble, Oh how your motions do my thoughts resemble, With that milde breath, by which you onely move, Whisper my words in silence to my Love: Convay my sighes sweet Civet-breathing ayre, In dolefull accents to my heavenly fayre; You murmuring Springs, like doleful Instruments Upon your gravell sound my sad laments, And in your silent bubling as you goe, Consort your selves like Musick to my woe. And lifting now his sad and heavy eyes Up, towards the beauty of the burnisht skies, Bright Lamps (qd. he) the glorious Welkin bears, Which clip about the Plannets wandring Sphears, And in your circled Maze doe ever role, Dauncing about the never-mooving Pole: Sweet Nymph, which in fayre Elice doost shine, Whom thy surpassing beauty made divine, Now in the Artick constellation, Smyle sweet Calisto on Endimion: The constellations neere the Pole ArtickAnd thou brave Perseus in the Northern ayre, Holding Medusa by the snaky hayre, Joves showre-begotten Son, whose valure tryed, In seaventeene glorious lights are stellified; Which won'st thy love, left as a Monsters pray; And thou the lovely fayre Andromida, Borne of the famous Etheopian lyne, Darting these rayes from thy transpiercing eyne, To thee the bright Cassiopey, with these, Whose beauty strove with the Neriedes, With all the troupe of the celestiall band, Which on Olimpus in your glory stand; And you great wandring lights, if from your Sphears You have regard unto a Sheepeheards teares, Or as men say, if over earthly things You onely rule as Potentates and Kings, Unto my loves event sweet Stars direct, Your kindest revolution and aspect, And bend your cleere eyes from your Thrones above Upon Endimion pyning thus in love. Now, ere the purple dauning yet did spring, The joyfull Lark began to stretch her wing, And now the Cock the mornings Trumpeter, Playd hunts-up for the day starre to appeare, Downe slydeth Phœbe from her Christall chayre, Sdayning to lend her light unto the ayre, But unto Latmus all in haste is gon, Longing to see her sweet Endimion; At whose departure all the Plannets gazed, As at some seld-seene accident amazed, Till reasoning of the same, they fell at ods, So that a question grew amongst the Gods, Whether without a generall consent She might depart their sacred Parliament? But what they could doe was but all in vaine, Of liberty they could her not restraine: For of the seaven sith she the lowest was, Unto the earth she might the easiest passe; Sith onely by her moysty influence, Of earthly things she hath preheminence, And under her, mans mutable estate, As with her changes doth participate; And from the working of her waning source, Th'uncertaine waters held a certaine course, Throughout her kingdome she might walk at large Wherof as Empresse she had care and charge, And as the Sunne unto the Day gives light, So is she onely Mistris of the Night; Which whilst shee in her oblique course dooth guide, The glittering stars apeare in all their pride, Which to her light their frendly Lamps do lend, And on her trayne as Hand-maydes doe attend, And thirteene times she through her Sphere doth run, Ere Phœbus full his yearly course have don: And unto her of women is assign'd, Predominance of body and of mind, That as of Plannets shee most variable, So of all creatures they most mutable, But her sweet Latmus which she lov'd so much, No sooner once her dainty foote doth touch, But that the Mountaine with her brightnes shone And gave a light to all the Horizon: Even as the Sun which darknes long did shroud, Breakes suddainly from underneath a clowd, So that the Nimphs which on her still attended, Knew certainly great Phœbe was discended; And all aproched to this sacred hill, There to awayt their soveraigne Goddesse will, And now the little Birds whom Nature taught, To honour great Diana as they ought, Because she is the Goddesse of the woods, And sole preserver of their hallowed floods, Set to their consort in their lower springs, That with the Musicke all the mountaine rings; So that it seemd the Birds of every Grove Which should excell and passe each other strove, That in the higher woods and hollow grounds, The murmuring Eccho every where resounds, The trembling brooks their slyding courses stayd, The whilst the waves one with another playd, And all the flocks in this rejoycing mood, As though inchaunted do forbeare their food: The heards of Deare downe from the mountains flew, As loth to come within Dianas view, Whose piercing arrowes from her Ivory bowe, Had often taught her powerfull hand to knowe; And now from Latmus looking towards the plains Casting her eyes upon the Sheepheards swaines, Perceiv'd her deare Endimions flock were stray'd And he himselfe upon the ground was layd; Who late recald from melancholy deepe, The chaunting Birds had lulled now asleepe: For why the Musick in this humble kinde, As it first found, so doth it leave the minde; And melancholy from the Spleene begun, By passion moov'd, into the veynes doth run; Which when this humor as a swelling Flood By vigor is infused in the blood; The vitall spirits doth mightely apall; The effect of Melancholie. And weakeneth so the parts organicall, And when the sences are disturbd and tierd, With what the hart incessantly desierd, Like Travellers with labor long opprest, Finding release, eft-soones they fall to rest. And comming now to her Endimion, Whom heavy sleepe had lately ceas'd upon, Kneeling her downe, him in her armes she clips, And with sweet kisses sealeth up his lips, Whilst from her eyes, teares streaming downe in showrs Fell on his cheekes like dew upon the flowrs, In globy circles like pure drops of Milk, Sprinckled on Roses, or fine crimson silk: Touching his brow, this is the seate (quoth she) Where Beauty sits in all her Majestie, She calls his eye-lids those pure Christall covers Which do include the looking Glasse of Lovers, She calls his lips the sweet delicious folds Which rare perfume and precious incense holds, Shee calls his soft smooth Allablaster skin, The Lawne which Angels are attyred in, Sweet face (qd. she) but wanting words I spare thee Except to heaven alone I should compare thee: And whilst her words she wasteth thus in vayne, Sporting herselfe the tyme to entertayne, The frolick Nymphes with Musicks sacred sound, Entred the Meddowes dauncing in a round: And unto Phœbe straight their course direct, Which now their joyfull comming did expect, Before whose feet their flowrie spoyles they lay, And with sweet Balme his body doe imbay. And on the Laurels growing there along, Their wreathed garlonds all about they hung: And all the ground within the compasse load, With sweetest flowers, wheron they lightly troad. With Nectar then his temples they be dew, And kneeling softly kisse him all arew; Then in brave galiards they themselves advaunce, And in the Tryas Bacchus stately daunce; Then following on fayre Floras gilded trayne, Into the Groves they thus depart agayne, And now to shew her powerfull deitie, Her sweet Endimion more to beautifie, Into his soule the Goddesse doth infuse, The fiery nature of a heavenly Muse, Which in the spyrit labouring by the mind The excellency of the soule:Pertaketh of celestiall things by kind: For why the soule being divine alone, Exempt from vile and grosse corruption, Of heavenly secrets comprehensible, Of which the dull flesh is not sensible, And by one onely powerfull faculty, Yet governeth a multiplicity, Being essentiall, uniforme in all; Not to be sever'd nor dividuall, But in her function holdeth her estate, By powers divine in her ingenerate, And so by inspiration conceaveth What heaven to her by divination breatheth; But they no sooner to the shades were gone, Leaving their Goddesse by Endimion, But by the hand the lovely boy shee takes, And from his sweet sleepe softly him awakes, Who being struck into a sodayne feare, Beholding thus his glorious Goddesse there, His hart transpiersed with this sodayne glance, Became as one late cast into a trance: Wiping his eyes not yet of perfect sight, Scarcely awak'd amazed at the light, His cheekes now pale then lovely blushing red, Which oft increasd, and quickly vanished, And as on him her fixed eyes were bent, So to and fro his colour came and went; Like to a Christall neere the fire set, Against the brightnes rightly opposet, The causes of the externall signes of passion Now doth reteyne the colour of the flame, And lightly moved againe, reflects the same; For our affection quickned by her heate, Alayd and strengthned by a strong conceit, The minde disturbed forth-with doth convart, To an internall passion of the hart, By motion of that sodaine joy or feare, Which we receive either by the eye or eare, For by retraction of the spirit and blood, From those exterior parts where first they stood, Into the center of the body sent, Returnes againe more strong and vehement: And in the like extreamitie made cold, About the same, themselves doe closely hold, And though the cause be like in this respect, Works by this meanes a contrary effect. Thus whilst this passion hotely held his course, Ebbing and flowing from his springing source, With the strong fit of this sweet Fever moved, At sight of her which he intirely loved, Not knowing yet great Phœbe this should be, His soveraigne Goddesse, Queene of Chastitie, Now like a man whom Love had learned Art, Resolv'd at once his secrets to impart: But first repeats the torments he had past, The woes indur'd since tyme he saw her last; Now he reports he noted whilst she spake, The bustling windes their murmure often brake, And being silent, seemd to pause and stay, To listen to her what she ment to say: Be kind (quoth he) sweet Nymph unto thy lover, My soules sole essence, and my sences mover, Life of my life, pure Image of my hart, Impressure of Conceit, Invention, Art, My vitall spirit, receves his spirit from thee, Thou art that all which ruleth all in me, Thou art the sap, and life whereby I live, Which powerfull vigor doost receive and give; Thou nourishest the flame wherein I burne, The North wherto my harts true tuch doth turne. Pitty my poore flock, see their wofull plight, Theyr Maister perisht living from thy sight, Theyr fleeces rent, my tresses all forlorne, I pyne, whilst they theyr pasture have forborne; Behold (quoth he) this little flower belowe, Which heere within this Fountayne brim dooth grow; With that, a solemne tale begins to tell Of this fayre flower, and of this holy Well, A goodly legend, many Winters old, Learn'd by the Sheepheards sitting by their folde, How once this Fountayne was a youthfull swaine, A frolick boy and kept upon the playne, Unfortunate it hapt to him (quoth he) To love a fayre Nymph as I nowe love thee, To her his love and sorrow he imparts, Which might dissolve a rock of flinty harts; To her he sues, to her he makes his mone, But she more deafe and hard then steele or stone; And thus one day with griefe of mind opprest, As in this place he layd him downe to rest, The Gods at length uppon his sorrowes looke, Transforming him into this pirrling Brooke, Whose murmuring bubles softly as they creepe, Falling in drops, the Channell seems to weepe, But shee thus careles of his misery, Still spends her dayes in mirth and jollity; And comming one day to the River side, Laughing for joy when she the same espyde, This wanton Nymph in that unhappy hower, Was heere transformd into this purple flower, Which towards the water turnes it selfe agayne, To pitty him by her unkindnes slayne. She, as it seemd, who all this time attended, Longing to heare that once his tale were ended, Now like a jealous woman she repeats, Mens subtilties, and naturall deceyts; And by example strives to verifie, Their ficklenes and vaine inconstancie: Their hard obdurate harts, and wilfull blindnes, Telling a storie wholy of unkindnes; But he, who well perceived her intent, And to remove her from this argument, Now by the sacred Fount he vowes and sweares, By Lovers sighes, and by her halowed teares, By holy Latmus now he takes his oath, That all he spake was in good fayth and troth; And for no frayle uncertayne doubt should move her, Vowes secrecie, the crown of a true Lover. She hearing this, thought time that she reveald, That kind affection which she long conceald, Determineth to make her true Love known, Which shee had borne unto Endimion; I am no Huntresse, nor no Nymph (quoth she) As thou perhaps imagin'st me to be, I am great Phœbe, Latmus sacred Queene, Who from the skies have hether past unseene, And by thy chast love hether was I led, Where full three yeares thy fayre flock have I fed, Upon these Mountaines and these firtile plaines, And crownd thee King of all the Sheepheards swaines: Nor wanton, nor lacivious is my love, Nor never lust my chast thoughts once could move; But sith thou thus hast offerd at my Shrine, And of the Gods hast held me most divine, Mine Altars thou with sacrifice hast stord, And in my Temples hast my name ador'd, And of all other, most hast honor'd mee, Great Phœbes glory thou alone shalt see. Thys spake, she putteth on her brave attire, As being burnisht in her Brothers fire, Purer then that Celestiall shining flame Wherein great Jove unto his Lemmon came, Which quickly had his pale cheekes over-spred, And tincted with a lovely blushing red. Which whilst her Brother Titan for a space, Withdrew himselfe, to give his sister place, Shee now is darkned to all creatures eyes, Whilst in the shadow of the earth she lyes, For that the earth of nature cold and dry, A very Chaos of obscurity, Whose Globe exceeds her compasse by degrees, Fixed upon her Superficies; When in his shadow she doth hap to fall, Dooth cause her darknes to be generall. Thus whilst he layd his head upon her lap, Shee in a fiery Mantle doth him wrap, And carries him up from this lumpish mould, Into the skyes, whereas he might behold, The earth in perfect roundnes of a ball Exceeding globes most artificiall: Which in a fixed poynt Nature disposed, And with the sundry Elements inclosed, Which as the Center permanent dooth stay, When as the skies in their diurnall sway, Strongly maintaine the ever-turning course, Forced alone by their first moover sourse, Where he beholds the ayery Regions, Whereas the clouds and strange impressions, Maintaynd by coldnes often doe appeare, And by the highest Region of the ayre, Unto the cleerest Element of fire, Which to her silver foot-stoole doth aspire, Then dooth she mount him up into her Sphere, Imparting heavenly secrets to him there, Where lightned by her shining beames hee sees, The powerfull Plannets, all in their degrees, Their sundry revolutions in the skies, And by their working how they simpathize; All in theyr circles severally prefixt, And in due distance each with other mixt: The mantions which they hold in their estate, Of which by nature they participate; And how those signes their severall places take, Within the compasse of the Zodiacke: And in their severall triplicities consent, The signes in their triplicities, participate with the Elements. Unto the nature of an Element, To which the Plannets do themselves disperce, Having the guidance of this univers, And do from thence extend their severall powers, Unto this little fleshly world of ours: Wherin her Makers workmanship is found, As in contriving of this mighty round, In such strange maner and such fashion wrought, As doth exceede mans dull and feeble thought, Guiding us still by their directions; And that our fleshly frayle complections, Of Elementall natures grounded bee, With which our dispositions most agree, Some of the fire and ayre participate, And some of watry and of earthy state, As hote and moyst, with chilly cold and dry, And unto these the other contrary; And by their influence powerfull on the earth, Predominant in mans fraile mortall bearth, And that our lives effects and fortunes are, As is that happy or unlucky Starre, Which reigning in our frayle nativitie, Seales up the secrets of our destinie, With frendly Plannets in conjunction set, Or els with other meerely opposet: And now to him her greatest power she lent, To lift him to the starry Firmament, Where he beheld that milky stayned place, By which the Twynns &amp; heavenly Archers trace, The dogge which doth the furious Lyon beate, Whose flaming breath increaseth Titans heate, The teare-distilling mournfull Pliades, Which on the earth the stormes &amp; tempests raise, And all the course the constellations run, When in conjunction with the Moone or Sun, When towards the fixed Articke they arise, When towards the Antaricke, falling from our eyes; And having impt the wings of his desire, And kindled him, with this cœlestiall fire, She sets him downe, and vanishing his sight, Leaves him inwrapped in this true delight: Now wheresoever he his fayre flock fed, The Muses still Endimion followed; His sheepe as white as Swans or driven snow, Which beautified the soyle with such a show, As where hee folded in the darkest Night, There never needed any other light; If that he hungred and desired meate, The Bees would bring him Honny for to eate, Yet from his lyps would not depart away, Tyll they were loden with Ambrosia; And if he thirsted, often there was seene A bubling Fountaine spring out of the greene, With Christall liquor fild unto the brim, Which did present her liquid store to him. If hee would hunt, the fayre Nymphs at his will, With Bowes &amp; Quivers, would attend him still: And what-soever he desierd to have, That he obtain'd if hee the same would crave. And now at length, the joyful tyme drew on, Shee meant to honor her Endimion, And glorifie him on that stately Mount Whereof the Goddesse made so great account. Shee sends Joves winged Herauld to the woods, The neighbour Fountains, &amp; the bordring floods, Charging the Nymphes which did inhabit there, Upon a day appoynted to appeare, And to attend her sacred Majestie In all theyr pompe and great solemnity. Having obtaynd great Phœbus free consent, To further her divine and chast intent, Which thus imposed as a thing of waight, In stately troupes appeare before her straight, The Faunes and Satyres from the tufted Brakes, Theyr brisly armes wreath'd al about with snakes; Their sturdy loynes with ropes of Ivie bound, Theyr horned heads with Woodbine Chaplets crownd, With Cipresse Javelens, and about their thyes, The flaggy hayre disorder'd loosely flyes: Th'Oriades like to the Spartan Mayd, In Murrie-scyndall gorgiously arayd: With gallant greene Scarfes girded in the wast, Theyr flaxen hayre with silken fillets lac'd, Woven with flowers in sweet lascivious wreathes, Mooving like feathers as the light ayre breathes, With crownes of Mirtle, glorious to behold, Whose leaves are painted with pure drops of gold: With traines of fine Bisse checker'd al with frets Of dainty Pincks and precious Violets, In branched Buskins of fine Cordiwin, With spangled garters downe unto the shin, Fring'd with fine silke, of many a sundry kind, Which lyke to pennons waved with the wind. The Hamadriads from their shady Bowers, Deckt up in Garlonds of the rarest flowers, Upon the backs of milke-white Bulls were set, With horne and hoofe as black as any Jet, Whose collers were great massy golden rings, Led by their swaynes in twisted silken strings; Then did the lovely Driades appeare, On dapled Staggs, which bravely mounted were, Whose velvet palmes with nosegaies rarely dight, To all the rest bred wonderfull delight; And in this sort accompaned with these, In tryumph rid the watry Niades, Upon Sea-horses, trapt with shining finns, Arm'd with their male impenitrable skinns, Whose scaly crests like Raine-bowes bended hye; Seeme to controule proud Iris in the skye; Upon a Charriot was Endimion layd, In snowy Tissue gorgiously arayd, Of precious Ivory covered or'e with Lawne, Which by foure stately Unicornes was drawne, Of ropes of Orient pearle their traces were, Pure as the path which dooth in heaven appeare, With rarest flowers in chaste and over-spred, Which serv'd as Curtaynes to this glorious bed, Whose seate of Christal in the Sun-beames shone, Like thunder-breathing Joves celestiall Throne, Upon his head a Coronet instald, Of one intire and mighty Emerald, With richest Bracelets on his lilly wrists, Of Hellitropium, linckt with golden twists; A bevy of fayre Swans, which flying over, With their large wings him from the Sun do cover, And easily wafting as he went along, Doe lull him still with their inchaunting song, Whilst all the Nimphes on solemne Instruments, Sound daintie Musick to their sweet laments. And now great Phœbe in her tryumph came, With all the tytles of her glorious name, Diana, Delia, Luna, Cynthia, Virago, Hecate, and Elythia, Prothiria, Dictinna, Proserpine, Latona, and Lucina, most divine; And in her pompe began now to approch, Mounted aloft upon her Christall Coach, Drawn or'e the playnes by foure pure milk-white Hinds, Whose nimble feete seem'd winged with the winds, Her rarest beauty being now begun, But newly borrowed from the golden Sun, Her lovely cressant with a decent space, By due proportion beautifi'd her face, Till having fully fild her circled side, Her glorious fulnes now appeard in pride; Which long her changing brow could not retaine, But fully waxt, began againe to wane; Upon her brow (like meteors in the ayre) Twenty &amp; eyght great gorgious lamps shee bare; Some, as the Welkin, shining passing bright, Some not so sumptuous, others lesser light, Some burne, some other, let theyr faire lights fall, Composd in order Geometricall; And to adorne her with a greater grace, And ad more beauty to her lovely face, Her richest Globe shee gloriously displayes, Now that the Sun had hid his golden rayes: Least that his radiencie should her suppresse, And so might make her beauty seeme the lesse; Her stately trayne layd out in azur'd bars, Poudred all thick with troopes of silver stars: Her ayrie vesture yet so rare and strange, As every howre the colour seem'd to change, Yet still the former beauty doth retaine, And ever came unto the same againe. Then fayre Astrea, of the Titans line, Whom equity and justice made divine, Was seated heer upon the silver beame, And with the raines guides on this goodly teame, To whom the Charites led on the way, Aglaia, Thalia, and Euphrozine, With princely crownes they in the triumph came, Imbellished with Phœbes glorious name: These forth before the mighty Goddesse went, As Princes Heraulds in a Parliament. And in their true consorted symphony, Record sweet songs of Phœbes chastity; Then followed on the Muses, sacred nyne, With the first number equally divine, In Virgins white, whose lovely mayden browes, Were crowned with tryumphant Lawrell bowes; And on their garments paynted out in glory, Their offices and functions in a story, Imblazoning the furie and conceite Which on their sacred company awaite; For none but these were suffered to aproch, Or once come neere to this celestiall Coach, But these two of the numbers, nine and three, Which being od include an unity, Into which number all things fitly fall, And therefore named Theologicall: And first composing of this number nine, Which of all numbers is the most divine, From orders of the Angels dooth arise, Which be contayned in three Hirarchies, And each of these three Hirarchies in three, The perfect forme of true triplicity; And of the Hirarchies I spake of erst, The glorious Epiphania is the first, In which the hie celestiall orders been, Of Thrones, Chirrup, and the Ciraphin; The second holds the mighty Principates, The Dominations and the Potestates, The Ephionia, the third Hirarchie, Which Vertues Angels and Archangels be; And thus by threes we aptly do define, And do compose this sacred number nyne, Yet each of these nyne orders grounded be, Upon some one particularity, Then as a Poet I might so infer, An other order when I spake of her. From these the Muses onely are derived, Which of the Angels were in nyne contrived; These heaven-inspired Babes of memorie, Which by a like attracting Sympathy, Apollos Prophets in theyr furies wrought, And in theyr spirit inchaunting numbers taught, To teach such as at Poesie repine, That it is onely heavenly and divine, And manifest her intellectual parts, Sucking the purest of the purest Arts; And unto these as by a sweet consent, The Sphery circles are equivalent, From the first Moover, and the starry heaven, To glorious Phœbe lowest of the seaven, Which Jove in tunefull Diapazons fram'd, Of heavenly Musick of the Muses nam'd, To which the soule in her divinitie, By her Creator made of harmony, Whilst she in frayle and mortall flesh dooth live, To her nyne sundry offices doe give, Which offices united are in three, Which like the orders of the Angels be, Prefiguring thus by the number nyne, The soule, like to the Angels is divine: And from these nines those Conquerers renowned, Which with the wreaths of triumph oft were crowned. Which by their vertues gain'd the worthies name First had this number added to their fame, Not that the worthiest men were onely nine, But that the number of it selfe divine, And as a perfect patterne of the rest, Which by this holy number are exprest; Nor Chivalrie this title onely gaynd; But might as well by wisedome be obtaynd, Nor in this number men alone included, But unto women well might be aluded, Could wit, could worlds, coulde times, could ages find, This number of Elizas heavenly kind; And those rare men which learning highly prized By whom the Constellations were devised, And by their favours learning highly graced, For Orpheus harpe nine starres in heaven placed: This sacred number to declare thereby, Her sweet consent and solid harmony, And mans heroique voyce, which doth impart, The thought conceaved in the inward hart, Her sweetnes on nine Instruments doth ground, Else doth she fayle in true and perfect sound. Now of this three in order to dispose, Whose trynarie doth justly nyne compose. First in the forme of this triplicitie Is shadowed that mighty Trinitie, Which still in stedfast unity remayne, And yet of three one Godhead doe containe; From this eternall living deitie, As by a heaven-inspired prophecy, Divinest Poets first derived these, The fayrest Graces Jove-borne Charites; And in this number Musick first began, The Lydian, Dorian, and the Phrigian, Which ravishing in their soule-pleasing vaine, They made up seaven in a higher strayne; And all those signes which Phœbus doth ascend, Before he bring his yearely course to end, Their several natures mutually agree, And doe concurre in thys triplicitie; And those interior sences with the rest, Which properly pertaine to man and Beast, Nature herselfe in working so devised, That in this number they should be comprized. But to my tale I must returne againe, Phœbe to Latmus thus convayde her swayne, Under a bushie Lawrells pleasing shade, Amongst whose boughs the Birds sweet Musick made, Whose fragrant branch-imbosted Cannapy, Was never pierst with Phœbus burning eye; Yet never could thys Paradise want light, Elumin'd still with Phœbes glorious sight: She layd Endimion on a grassy bed, With sommers Arras ritchly over-spred, Where from her sacred Mantion next above, She might descend and sport her with her love, Which thirty yeeres the Sheepheards safely kept, Who in her bosom soft and soundly slept; Yet as a dreame he thought the tyme not long, Remayning ever beautifull and yong, And what in vision there to him be fell, My weary Muse some other time shall tell. Deare Collin, let my Muse excused be, Which rudely thus presumes to sing by thee, Although her straines be harsh untun'd &amp; ill, Nor can attayne to thy divinest skill. And thou the sweet Museus of these times, Pardon my rugged and unfiled rymes, Whose scarce invention is too meane and base, When Delias glorious Muse dooth come in place. And thou my Goldey which in Sommer dayes, Hast feasted us with merry roundelayes, And when my Muse scarce able was to flye, Didst imp her wings with thy sweete Poesie. And you the heyres of ever-living fame, The worthy titles of a Poets name, Whose skill and rarest excellence is such, As spitefull Envy never yet durst tuch, To your protection I this Poem send, Which from proud Momus may my lines defend, And if sweet mayd thou deign'st to read this story, Wherein thine eyes may view thy vertues glory, Thou purest spark of Vesta's kindled fire, Sweet Nymph of Ankor, crowne of my desire, The plot which for their pleasure heaven devis'd, Where all the Muses be imparadis'd, Where thou doost live, there let all graces be, Which want theyr grace if onely wanting thee, Let stormy winter never touch the Clyme, But let it florish as in Aprils prime, Let sullen night, that soyle nere over-cloud, But in thy presence let the earth be proud, If ever Nature of her worke might boast, Of thy perfection she may glory most, To whom fayre Phœbe hath her bow resign'd, Whose excellence doth lyve in thee refin'd, And that thy praise Time never should impayre, Hath made my hart thy never moving Spheare. Then if my Muse give life unto thy fame, Thy vertues be the causers of the same. And from thy Tombe some Oracle shall rise, To whom all pens shall yearely sacrifice. FINIS. Peirs Gaueston EARLE OF CORNWALL. His life, death, and fortune. Effugiunt auidos carmina sola rogos. TO THE WORTHY AND HONORABLE Gentleman, Maister Henry Caundish, Esquire. From gloomy shaddowe of eternall night, Where cole-black darknes keeps his lothsome cel, And from those Ghostes, whose eyes abhorre the light, From thence I come a wofull tale to tell: Prepare the Stage, I meane to acte my parte, Sighing the scenes from my tormented hart. From Stygian lake, to gracelesse soules assign'd, And from the floud of burning Acheron, Where sinfull spirites are by the fier refinde, The fearefull Ghost of wofull Gaveston: With black-fac'd furies from the graves attended, Untill the tenor of my tale be ended. Wing-footed Fame now sommons me from death, In Fortunes triumph to advance my glorie, The blessed Heavens againe doe lend me breath, Whilst I reporte this dolefull Tragick storie: That soule and bodie, which death once did sunder, Now meete together to reporte a wonder. O purple-buskind Pallas most divine Let thy bright fauchion lend me Cypresse bowes, Be thou assistinge to this Poet of mine, And with thy tragicke garland girte his browes, Pitying my case, when none would heare me weepe To tell my cares hath layde his owne to sleepe. You mournfull maydens of the sacred nine, You destinies which haunt the shades beneath, To you fayre muses I my playnts resigne, To you black spirits I my woes bequeath, With sable pens of direfull ebonie To pen the processe of my tragedie. Drawe on the lines which shall report my life With weeping words distilling from thy pen, Where woes abound and joyes are passing rife, A verie meteor in the eies of men, Wherein the world a wonder-world may see Of heaven-bred joye and hell-nurst miserie. Declare my ebs, my often swelling tide, Now tell my calmes, and then report my showres, My winters stormes, and then my summers pride, False fortunes smiles, then her dissembling lowres, The height wherto my glorie did ascend: Then poynt the period where my joyes did end. When famous Edward wore the english crowne Victorious Longshankes flower of chivalrie, First of his name that raignd in Albion, Through worlds renownd to all posteritie: My youth began, and then began my blis, Even in his daies, those blessed daies of his. O daies, no daies, but little worlds of mirth: O yeares, no yeares, time sliding with a trice: O world, no world, a verie heaven on earth: O earth, no earth, a verie paradice: A King, a man, nay more then this was hee, If earthly man, more then a man might bee. Such a one he was, as Englands Beta is, Such as she is, even such a one was he, Betwixt her rarest excellence and his Was never yet so neare a Sympathy, To tell your worth, and to give him his due, I say my soveraigne, he was like to you. His court a schoole, where artes were daily red, And yet a campe where armes were exercised, Vertue and learning here were nourished, And stratagems by souldiers still devised: Heere skilfull schoolmen were his counsaylors, Schollers his captaines, captaines Senators. Here sprang the roote of true gentilitie, Vertue was clad in gold and crownd with honor, Honor intitled to Nobilitie, Admired so of all that looked on her: Wisedome, not wealth, possessed wisemens roomes, Unfitting base insinuating groomes. Then Machivels were loth'd as filthie toades, And good men as rare pearles were richly prized, The learned were accounted little Gods, The vilest Atheist as the plague despised: Desert then gaynd, that vertues merit craves, And artles Pesants scorn'd as basest slaves. Pride was not then, which all things overwhelms: Promotion was not purchased with gold, Men hew'd their honor out of steeled helms: In those dayes fame with bloud was bought and sold, No petti-fogger pol'd the poore for pence, These dolts, these dogs, as traytors banisht hence. Then was the Souldier prodigall of bloud, His deedes eternizd by the Poets pen: Who would not dye to doe his countrey good, When after death his fame yet liv'd to men? Then learning liv'd with liberalitie, And men were crownd with immortalitie. Graunt pardon then unto my wandring ghost, Although I seeme lascivious in my prayse, And of perfection though I seeme to boast, Whilst here on earth I troad this weary maze, Whilst yet my soule in bodie did abide, And whilst my flesh was pampred here in pride. My valiant father was in Gascoygne borne, A man at armes, and matchles with his launce, A Souldier vow'd, and to King Edward sworne, With whom he serv'd in all his wars in Fraunce, His goods and lands he pawnd and layd to gage To follow him, the wonder of that age. And thus himselfe he from his home exil'd, Who with his sword sought to advance his fame, With me his joy, but then a little child, Unto the Court of famous England came, Whereas the King, for service he had done, Made me a page unto the Prince his sonne. My tender youth yet scarce crept from the shell, Unto the world brought such a wonderment, That all perfection seem'd in me to dwell, And that the heavens me all their graces lent: Some sware I was the quintessence of nature, And some an Angell, and no earthly creature. The heavens had lim'd my face with such a die As made the curiost eie on earth amazed, Tempring my lookes with love and majestie, A miracle to all that ever gazed, So that it seem'd some power had in my birth, Ordained me his Image here on earth. O bewtious vernish of the heavens above, Pure grain-dy'd colour of a perfect birth, O fairest tincture adamant of love, Angell-hewd blush the prospective of mirth, O sparkling luster joying humaine sight, Lives joy, hearts fire, Loves nurse, the soules delight. As purple-tressed Titan with his beames, The sable cloudes of night in sunder cleaveth Enameling the earth with golden streames, When he his crimson Canopie upheaveth, Such was my beauties pure translucent rayes, Which cheerd the Sun, &amp; cleerd the drouping dayes. My lookes perswading orators of Love, My speech divine infusing harmonie, And every worde so well could passion move, So were my gestures grac'd with modestie, As where my thoughts intended to surprize, I easly made a conquest with mine eyes. A gracious minde, a passing lovely eye, A hand that gave, a mouth that never vaunted, A chaste desire, a tongue that would not lye, A lyons heart, a courage never daunted, A sweet conceit in such a cariage placed As with my gesture all my words were graced. Such was the worke which nature had begonne, As promised a gem of wondrous price, This little star foretold a glorious sunne, This curious plot an earthly paradice, This globe of bewtie wherin all might see An after world of wonders here in mee. As in the Autumnall season of the yeare, Some death-presaging comet doth arise, Or some prodigious meteor doth appeare, Or fearfull Chasma unto humaine eyes: Even such a wonder was I to behold Where heaven seem'd all her secrets to unfold. If cunning'st pensill-man that ever wrought By skilfull arte of secret sumetry, Or the divine Idea of the thought With rare descriptions of high poesy, Should all compose a body and a mind, Such a one seem'd I, the wonder of my kind. With this fayre bayte I fisht for Edwards love, My daintie youth so pleasd his princely eye: Here sprang the league which time could not remove, So deeply grafted in our Infancie, That frend, nor foe, nor life, nor death could sunder, So seldome seene, and to the world a wonder. O heavenly concord, musicke of the minde, Touching the heart-strings with such harmonie, The ground of nature, and the law of kinde, Which in conjunction doe so well agree, Whose revolution by effect doth prove, That mortall men are made divine by love. O strong combining chaine of secrecie, Sweet joy of heaven, the Angels oratorie, The bond of faith, the seale of sanctitie, The soules true blisse, youths solace, ages glorie, An endles league, a bond that's never broken, A thing divine, a word with wonder spoken. With this fayre Bud of that same blessed Rose, Edward surnam'd Carnarvan by his birth, Who in his youth it seem'd that Nature chose To make the like, whose like was not on earth, Had not his lust and my lascivious will Made him and me the instruments of ill. With this sweete Prince, the mirror of my blisse, My souls delight, my joy, my fortunes pride, My youth enjoyd such perfect happines, Whil'st tutors care, his wandring yeares did guide, As his affections on my thoughts attended, And with my life, his joyes began and ended. Whether it were my beauties excellence, Or rare perfections that so pleasd his eye, Or some divine and heavenly influence, Or naturall attracting Sympathie: My pleasing youth became his senses object, Where all his passions wrought upon this subject. Thou Arke of Heaven, where wonders are inroled, O depth of nature, who can looke unto thee? O who is he that hath thy doome controuled? Or hath the key of reason to undoe thee: Thy workes divine which powers alone doe knowe, Our shallow wittes too short for things belowe. The soule divine by her integritye, And by the functious agents of the minde, Cleer-sighted, so perceiveth through the eye, That which is pure and pleasing to her kinde, And by hir powrfull motions apprehendeth, That which beyond our humaine sence extendeth. This Edward in the Aprill of his age, Whil'st yet the Crowne sate on his fathers head, My Jove with me, his Ganimed, his page, Frolick as May, a lustie life we led: He might commaund, he was my Soveraigns sonne, And what I saide, by him was ever done. My words as lawes, Autentique he alloude, Mine yea, by him was never crost with no, All my conceite as currant he avowde, And as my shadowe still he served so, My hand the racket, he the tennis ball, My voyces echo, answering every call. My youth the glasse where he his youth beheld, Roses his lipps, my breath sweete Nectar showers, For in my face was natures fayrest field, Richly adornd with Beauties rarest flowers. My breast his pillow, where he laide his head, Mine eyes his booke, my bosome was his bed. My smiles were life, and Heaven unto his sight, All his delight concluding my desier, From my sweete sunne, he borrowed all his light, And as a flie play'd with my beauties fier, His love-sick lippes at every kissing qualme, Cling to my lippes, to cure their griefe with balme. Like as the wanton Yvie with his twyne, Whenas the Oake his rootlesse bodie warmes, The straightest saplings strictly doth combyne, Clipping the woodes with his lacivious armes: Such our imbraces when our sporte begins, Lapt in our armes, like Ledas lovely Twins. Or as Love-nursing Venus when she sportes, With cherry-lipt Adonis in the shade, Figuring her passions in a thousand sortes, With sighes, and teares, or what else might perswade, Her deere, her sweete, her joy, her life, her love, Kissing his browe, his cheeke, his hand, his glove. My bewtie was the Load-starre of his thought, My lookes the Pilot to his wandring eye, By me his sences all a sleepe were brought, When with sweete love I sang his lullaby. Nature had taught my tongue her perfect time, Which in his eare stroake duely as a chyme. With sweetest speech, thus could I syranize, Which as strong Philters youthes desire could move, And with such method could I rhetorize, My musick plaied the measures to his love: In his faire brest, such was my soules impression, As to his eyes, my thoughts made intercession. Thus like an Eagle seated in the sunne, But yet a Phenix in my soveraigns eye, We act with shame, our revels are begunne, The wise could judge of our Catastrophe: But we proceede to play our wanton prize, Our mournfull Chorus was a world of eyes. The table now of all delight is layd, Serv'd with what banquets bewtie could devise, The Sirens singe, and false Calypso playd, Our feast is grac'd with youthes sweete comœdies, Our looks with smiles, are sooth'd of every eye, Carrousing love in boules of Ivorie. Fraught with delight, and safely under sayle, Like flight-wing'd Faucons now we take our scope, Our youth and fortune blowe a mery gale, We loose the anchor of our vertues hope: Blinded with pleasure in this lustfull game, By oversight discard our King with shame. My youthfull pranks, are spurs to his desire, I held the raynes, that rul'd the golden sunne, My blandishments were fewell to his fyer, I had the garland whosoever wonne: I waxt his winges and taught him art to flye, Who on his back might beare me through the skye. Here first that sun-bright temple was defild, Which to faire vertue first was consecrated, This was the fruite, wherewith I was beguild, Heere first the deede of all my fame was dated: O me! even heere from paradice I fell, From Angels state, from heaven, cast downe to hell. Loe here the verie Image of perfection, With the blacke pensill of defame is blotted, And with the ulcers of my youths infection, My innocencie is besmer'd, and spotted: Now comes my night, ô now my day is done, These sable cloudes eclipse my rising sunne. Our innocence, our child-bred puritie Is now defilde and as our dreames forgot, Drawne in the coach of our securitie: What act so vile, that we attempted not? Our sun-bright vertues fountaine-cleer beginning, Is now polluted by the filth of sinning. O wit too wilfull, first by heaven ordayn'd, An Antidote by vertue made to cherish, By filthy vice, as with a mole art stayn'd, A poyson now by which the sences perish: That made of force, all vices to controule, Defames the life, and doth confound the soule. The Heavens to see my fall doth knit her browes, The vaulty ground under my burthen groneth, Unto mine eyes, the ayre no light allowes, The very winde my wickednesse bemoneth: The barren earth repineth at my foode, And Nature seemes to cursse her beastly broode. And thus like slaves we sell our soules to sinne, Vertue forgot by worldes deceitfull trust, Alone by pleasure are we entred in, Now wandring in the labyrinth of lust, For when the soule is drowned once in vice, The sweete of sinne, makes hell a paradice. O Pleasure thou, the very lure of sinne, The roote of woe, our youthes deceitfull guide, A shop where all confected poysons been, The bayte of lust, the instrument of pride, Inchanting Circes, smoothing cover-guile, Aluring Siren, flattering Crockodile. Our Jove which sawe his Phœbus youth betrayde, And Phaeton guide the sunne-carre in the skies, Knewe well the course with danger hardly staide, For what is not percev'd by wise-mens eyes? He knew these pleasures posts of our desire, Might by misguiding set his throne on fier. This was a corsive to King Edwards dayes, These jarring discords quite untun'd his mirth, This was the paine which never gave him ease, If ever hell, this was his hell on earth: This was the burthen which he groned under, This pincht his soule, and rent his heart in sunder. This venom suckt the marrow from his bones, This was the canker which consum'd his yeares, This fearfull vision, fild his sleepe with grones, This winter snow'd downe frost upon his hayres: This was the moth, this was the fretting rust, Which so consum'd his glorie unto dust. The humor found, which fed this foule disease Must needes be stay'd, ere help could be devys'd, The vaine must breath the burning to appease, Hardly a cure, the wound not cauterys'd: That member now wherein the botch was risen Infecteth all not cured by incision. The cause conjectur'd by this prodigie, From whence this foule contagious sicknes grue, Wisdome alone must give a remedie, For to prevent the danger to insue: The cause must end, ere the effect could cease, Else might the danger dayly more increase. Now those whose eyes to death envide my glorie, Whose saftie still upon my down-fall stood, These, these, could comment on my youthfull storie, These were the wolves which thirsted for my blood: These all unlade their mischiefes at this baye, And make the breach to enter my decaye. These curres that liv'd by carrion of the court, These wide-mouth'd hel-hounds long time kept at bay, Finding the King to credit their reporte, Like greedie ravens follow for their pray: Dispightfull Langton favorit to the King, Was he which first, me in disgrace could bring. Such as beheld this lightning from above, My Princely Jove from out the ayre to thunder: This earth-quake which did my foundation move, This boystrous storme, this unexpected wounder, They thought my sunne had bin eclipsed quite, And all my day now turn'd to winters night. My youth embowel'd by their curious eyes, Whose true reportes my life anatomis'd, Who still pursu'd me like deceitfull spyes, To crosse that which I wantonly devis'd: Perceave the traine me to the trap had led, And downe they come like haylestones on my head. My Sonne eclips'd, ech Starre becomes a Sunne, When Phœbus fayles, then Cynthia shineth bright, These furnish up the Stage, my act is done, Which were but Gloe-wormes to my glorious light, Those erst condemn'd by my perfections doome, In Phœbus chariot, now possesse my roome. The Commons swore, I led the Prince to vice, The Nobles said that I abus'd the King, Grave Matrons such as lust could not intice, Like women whispred of another thing: Such as could not aspire unto my place, These were suborn'd to offer me disgrace. The staffe thus broke, whereon my youth did stay, And with the shaddowe all my pleasures gone: Now with the windes my joyes fleete hence away, The silent night makes musik to my moane, The tatling ecchoes whispering with the ayre, Unto my wordes sound nothing but despayre. The frowning Heavens are all in sables clad, The Planet of my lives misfortune raineth: No musick serves a dying soule to glad, My wrong to Tirants for redresse complaineth: To ease my paine there is no remedie, So farre despayre exceeds extremitie. Why doe I quake my down-fall to reporte? Tell on my ghost, the storie of my woe, The King commaunds, I must depart the court, I aske no question, he will have it so: The Lyons roring, lesser beastes doe feare, The greatest flye, when he approcheth neare. My Prince is now appointed to his guarde, As from a traytor he is kept from me, My banishment already is preparde, Away I must, there is no remedie: On paine of death I may no longer stay, Such is revenge which brooketh no delaye. The skies with cloudes are all invelloped, The pitchie fogs eclipse my cheerfull Sunne, The geatie night hath all her curtaines spred And all the ayre with vapours overrun: Wanting those rayes whose cleernes lent me light, My sun-shine day is turn'd to black-fac'd night. Like to the birde of Ledaes lemmans die, Beating his breast against the silver streame, The fatall prophet of his destinie, With mourning chants, his death approching theame: So now I sing the dirges of my fall, The Anthemes of my fatall funerall. Or as the faithfull Turtle for her make Whose youth enjoyd her deere virginitie, Sits shrouded in some melancholie brake Chirping forth accents of her miserie, Thus halfe distracted sitting all alone, With speaking sighs, to utter forth my mone. My bewtie s'dayning to behold the light Now weather-beaten with a thousand stormes, My daintie lims must travaile day and night, Which oft were lulde in princely Edwards armes, Those eyes where bewtie sate in all her pride, With fearefull objects fild on every side. The Prince so much astonisht with the blowe, So that it seem'd as yet he felt no paine, Untill at length awakned by his woe, He sawe the wound by which his joyes were slaine, His cares fresh bleeding fainting more and more, No Cataplasma now to cure the sore. Now weepe mine eyes, and lend me teares at will, You sad-musde sisters help me to indite, And in your faire Castalia bathe my quill, In bloodie lines whilst I his woes recite, Inspire my muse O Heavens now from above, To painte the passions of a princely love. His eyes about their rouling Globes doe cast, To finde that Sunne, from whom they had their light, His thoughtes doe labor for that sweete repast, Which past the daye, and pleasd him all the night: He countes the howers, so sloly how they runne, Reproves the daye, and blames the loytring sunne. As gorgious Phœbus in his first uprise Discovering now his Scarlet-coloured head, By troublous motions of the lowring Skies His glorious beames with fogges are overspred, So are his cheereful browes eclips'd with sorrowe, Which cloud the shine of his youths-smiling morrow. Now showring downe a flud of brackish teares, The Epithemaes to his hart-swolne griefe, Then sighing out a vollue of dispayres, Which onely is th'afflicted mans reliefe: Now wanting sighes, and all his teares were spent, His tongue brake out into this sad lament. O breake my hart quoth he, O breake and dye, Whose infant thoughts were nurst with sweete delight; But now the Inne of care and miserie, Whose pleasing hope is murthered with despight: O end my dayes, for now my joyes are done, Wanting my Peirs, my sweetest Gaveston. Farewell my Love, companion of my youth, My soules delight, the subject of my mirth, My second selfe if I reporte the truth, The rare and onely Phenix of the earth, Farewell sweete friend, with thee my joyes are gone, Farewell my Peirs, my lovely Gaveston. What are the rest but painted Imagrie, Dombe Idols made to fill up idle roomes, But gaudie anticks, sportes of foolerie, But fleshly coffins, goodly gilded tombes, But puppets which with others words replie, Like pratling ecchoes soothing every lie? O damned world, I scorne thee and thy worth, The very source of all iniquitie: An ougly damme that brings such monsters forth, The maze of death, nurse of impietie, A filthie sinke, where lothsomnes doth dwell, A labyrinth, a jayle, a very hell. Deceitfull Siren traytor to my youth, Bane to my blisse, false theefe that stealst my joyes: Mother of lyes, sworne enemie to truth, The ship of fooles fraught all with gaudes and toyes, A vessell stuft with foule hypocrisie, The very temple of Idolatrie. O earth-pale Saturne most malevolent, Combustious Planet, tyrant in thy raigne, The sworde of wrath, the roote of discontent, In whose ascendant all my joyes are slaine: Thou executioner of foule bloodie rage, To act the will of lame decrepit age. My life is but a very mappe of woes, My joyes the fruite of an untimely birth, My youth in labour with unkindly throwes, My pleasures are like plagues that raigne on earth, All my delights like streames that swiftly run, Or like the dewe exhaled by the Sun. O Heavens why are you deafe unto my mone? S'dayne you my prayers? or scorne to heare my misse? Cease you to move, or is your pittie gone? Or is it you that rob me of my blisse? What are you blinde, or winke and will not see? Or doe you sporte at my calamitie? O happie climat whatsoere thou be Cheerd with those sunnes the fayr'st that ever shone, Which hast those Stars which guide my destinie, The brightest lamps in all the Horizon, O happie eyes that see which most I lacke, The pride and bewtie of the Zodiacke. O blessed fountaine source of all delight, O sacred sparke that kindlest Virtues fier! The perfect object of the purest sight, The superficies of true loves desire, The very touchstone of all sweete conceite, On whom all graces evermore awaite. Thus whilst his youth in all these stormes was tost, And whilst his joyes lay speechles in a traunce, His sweete content with such unkindnes crost, And lowring Fortune seem'd to looke askance: Too weake to swim against the streamfull time, Fore-told their fall which now sought most to clime. Camelion-like, the world thus turns her hue, And like Proteus puts on sundry shapes, One hastes to clime, another doth ensue, One fals, another for promotion gapes: Flockmell they swarme like flies about the brim, Some drowne whilst others with great danger swim. And some on whome the Sunne shon passing fayre, Yet of their summer nothing seeme to vaunte, They sawe their fall presaged by the ayre, If once this planet were predominant: Thus in their gate they flew with wings of feare, And still with care doe purchase honor deere. Thus restles Time that never turnes againe, Whose winged feete are sliding with the Sunne, Brings Fortune in to act another scene By whome the plot alreadie is begunne, The argument of this same tragedie, Is Virtues fall to raise up infamie. The brute is blowne, the King doth now pretend, A long-look'd voyage to the Holy-land, For which his subjects mightie sums doe lend, And whilst the thing is hotly thus in hand, Blinde Fortune turnes about her fickle wheele, And breaks the prop which makes the building reele. I feare to speake, yet speake I must perforce, My wordes be turn'd to teares even as I write, Mine eyes doe yet behold his dying corse, And on his hearse me thinkes I still indyte: My paper is hard sable Ebon wood, My pen of Iron, and my inke is blood. Loe here, the time drue on of Edwards death, Loe here, the dolefull period of his yeares, O now he yeeldeth up that sacred breath, For whom the Heavens do shower down fluds of teares, For whom the Sunne, even mourning hides his face, For whom the earth was all to vile and base. May I reporte his dolefull obsequie, When as my Ghost doth tremble at his name? Faine would I write, but as I write I die, My joyntes apald with feare, my hand is lame, I leave it to some sacred muse to tell, Upon whose life a Poets pen might dwell. No sooner was his body wrapt in lead And that his mournfull funerals were done, But that the Crowne was set on Edwards head, Sing I-o now my ghost, the storme is gone: The winde blowes right, loe yonder breakes my day, Caroll my muse, and now sing care away. Carnarvan now cals home within a while Whom worthie Long-shankes hated to the death, Whom Edward swore should dye in his exile, He was as deere to Edward as his breath, This Edward lov'd that Edward loved not, Kings wils performd: and dead mens words forgot. Now waft me winde unto the blessed Ile, Rock me my joyes, love sing me with delight, Now sleepe my thoughts, cease sorrowe for a while, Now end my care, come day, farwell my night: Sweet sences now act every one his part, Loe here the balme that hath recur'd my hart. Loe now my Jove in his ascendant is In the æstivall solstice of his glorie, Now all the Stars prognosticate my blis, And in the Heaven all eyes may reade my storie, My comet now worlds wonder thus appeers Foretelling troubles of insuing yeeres. Now am I mounted with fames golden wings, And in the Tropick of my fortunes height, My flood maintayned with a thousand springs, Now on my back supporting Atlas weight: All tongues and pens attending on my prayse, Sur-named now, the wonder of our dayes. Who ever sawe the kindest romane dame With extreame joye yeeld up her latest breath, When from the warres her sonne triumphing came, When stately Rome had mourned for his death: Her passion here might have exprest aright, When once I came into the Princes sight. Who ever had his Ladie in his armes, That hath of love but felt the miserie, Touching the fire that all his sences warmes, Now clips with joy her blushing Ivorie. Feeling his soule in such delights to melt, Ther's none but he can tell the joye, we felt. Like as when Phœbus darteth forth his rayes, Gliding along the swelling Ocean streames, Now whilst one billowe with another playes, Reflecteth back his bright translucent beames: Such was the conflict then betwixt our eyes Sending forth lookes as teares doe fall and rise. It seem'd the ayre devisde to please my sight, The whistling winde makes musick to my tale, All things on earth now feast me with delight, The world to me sets all her wealth to sale: Who now rules all in courte but I alone, Who highly grac'd but onely Gaveston? Now like to Mydas all I touch is gould, The cloudes doe shower downe gould into my lap, If I but winke the mightiest are controulde, Plac'd on the turret of my highest hap: My cofers now, even like to Oceans are, To whom all floods by course doe still repayre. With bountie now he franckly seales his love, And to my hands yeelds up the Ile of Man, By such a gifte his kingly minde to prove, This was the earnest wherewith he began: Then Walingford Queene Elnors stately dower, With many a towne, and many a goodly tower. And all those sums his father had preparde By way of taxes for the holy land, He gave me francklie as my due rewarde: In bountie thus, it seemd he pleasd his hand, Which made the worlde to wonder every houre, To see me drowned in this golden showre. Determin'd now to hoyst my sayle amaine, The Earle of Cornewall he created me, Of England then the Lord high Chamberlaine, Chiefe Secretarie to his Majestie: What I devisd, his treasure ever wrought, His bountie still so answered to my thought. Yet more to spice my joyes with sweete delight, Bound by his love aprentice to my pleasure, Whose eyes still level'd how to please my sight, Whose kindnes ever so exceeded measure, Devis'd to quench my thirst with such a drinke As from my quill drops Nectar to my inke. O sacred Bountie mother of content, Prop of renowne, the nourisher of arts, The Crowne of hope, the roote of good event, The trumpe of Fame, the joye of noble harts, Grace of the Heavens, divinitie in nature, Whose excellence doth so adorne the creature. He gives his Neece in mariage unto me, Of Royall blood, for bewtie past compare, Borne of his sister was this Bellamie, Daughter to Gilbert thrice renowned Clare, Chiefe of his house the Earle of Glocester, For Princely worth that never had his peere. Like Heaven-di'd Andromeda the fayre, In her embrodered mantle richly dight, With Starrie traine inthronis'd in the ayre, Adorns the Welken with her glittering light, Such one she was, which in my bosome rested, With whose deare love, my youthful yeres were feasted. As when fayre Ver dight in her flowrie rayle, In her new-coloured liveries decks the earth, And glorious Tytan spreads his sun-shine vaile, To bring to passe her tender infants birth: Such was her bewtie which I then possest, With whose imbracings all my youth was blest. Whose purest thoughts and spotles chaste desire, To my affections still so pleasing were, Never yet toucht with sparke of Venus fier, As but her breast I thought no Heaven but there: To none more like then fayre Idea she, The very image of all chastitie. O chastitie, that guifte of blessed soul's, Comfort in death, a crowne unto the life, Which all the passions of the minde controul's Adornes the mayde, and bewtifies the wife: That grace, the which nor death, nor time attaints, Of earthly creatures making heavenly Saints. O Virtue which no muse can poetize Fayre Queene of England which with thee doth rest, Which thy pure thoughts doe onely exercize, And is impressed in thy royall breast, Which in thy life disciphered is alone, Whose name shall want a fit Epitheton. The Heavens now seeme to frolick at my feaste, The Stars as handmayds, serving my desiers, Now love full fed with bewtie takes his rest, To whom content, for saftie thus retiers: The grounde was good, my footing passing sure, My dayes delightsome, and my life secure. Loe thus ambition creepes into my breast, Pleasing my thoughts with this emperious humor, And with this divell being once possest, Mine eares are fild with such a buzzing rumor, As onely pride my glorie doth awaite, My sences sooth'd with everie selfe-conceite. Selfe-love, prides thirst, unsatisfied desier, A flood that never yet had any boundes, Times pestilence, thou state-consuming fier, A mischiefe which all common weales confoundes, O Plague of plagues, how many kingdomes rue thee, O happie Empiers that yet never knew thee! And now revenge which had been smoothered long, Like piercing lightning flasheth from mine eyes, This word could sound so sweetely on my tonge, And with my thoughts such Stratagems devise, Tickling mine eares with many a pleasing storie, Which promist wonders and a world of glorie. For now began the bloodie-rayning broyles Betweene the barons of the land and me, Labouring the state with Ixion-endles toyles Twixt my ambition and their tyrannie, Such was the storme this diluge first begun, With which this Ile was after overrun. O cruell discord foode of deadly hate, O mortall corsive to a common weale, Death-lingring consumption to a state, A poysoned sore that never salve could heale: O foule contagion deadly killing fever, Infecting oft, but to be cured never. By courage now imboldned in my sinne, Finding my King so surely linkt to me, By circumstance I finely bring him in To be an actor in this tragedie, Perswading him the Barons sought his blood, And on what tearmes these earth-bred giants stood. And so advancing to my Princes Grace The baser sorte of factious qualitie, As being raised unto such a place Might counterpoyse the proude Nobilitie, And as my agents on my part might stand, Still to support what ere I tooke in hand. Suborning gesters still to make me mirth, Vile Sycophants at every word to sooth me, Time-fawning Spaniels, Mermaydes on the earth, Trencher-fed fools with flattering words to smooth me, Base Parasites, these elbowe-rubbing mates, A plague to all lascivious wanton states. O filthie monkies vile and beastly kinde, Foule pratling Parats berds of Harpie broode, A corasive to every noble minde, Vipers that suck your mothers deerest blood, Mishapen monster, worst of any creature, A foe to art, an enemy to nature. His presence grac't what ere I went about, His chiefe content was that which liked mee, What ere I did, his power still bare mee out, And where I was, there ever-more was hee: By byrth my Soveraigne, but by love my thrall, King Edwards Idoll all men did mee call. Oft would he sette his crowne upon my head, And in his chayre sit downe upon my knee, And when his eyes with love were fully fed, A thousand times he sweetly kissed mee: When did I laugh? and he not seene to smile? If I but frownd, hee silent all the while. But Fortune now unto my over-throwe, Intic't mee on with her alluring call, And still devising how to worke my woe, One bayte tan'e up, she let another fall. Thus Syren-like, she brings me to the bay Where long before shee plotted my decay. For now the King to Fraunce doth him prepare, For marriage with the Princesse Isabel, Daughter to Phillip then surnam'd the faire, Who like to him in beauty did excell; Of Tilts and tryumphs every man reports, And the uniting of these famous Courts. And now the King to rayse me higher yet, Makes me the Lord-protector of the Land, And in the Chayre of his estate I sit, Hee yeelds his Scepter up into mine hand. Devising still how he to passe might bring, That if he died, I might succeed as King. His treasure now stood absolute to mee, I dranck my pleasures in a golden cup, I spent a world, I had aboundantly, As though the earth had cast her bowels up. My reckonings cast, my summs were soone enroled, I was by no man once to be controled. Now being got as high as I could clyme, And Fortune made my foote-cloth as I gest, I paynt me brave with Tagus golden slyme, Because I would enjoy what I possest. Aluding stil, that he is mad and worse, Which playes the nyggard with a Princes purse. And now the King returning with his trayne, I summond all the chiefe Nobilitie, And in my pompe, went foorth to entertayne The Peers of Fraunce in all thys joylitie. Where, in my carridge were such honours placed, As with my presence, all the showes were graced. Guarded with troupes of Gallants as I went, The people crouching still with cap and knee, My port and personage so magnificent, That (as a God) the Commons honored mee. And in my pryde, loe thus I could devise, To seeme a wonder unto all mens eyes. In ritchest Purple rode I all alone, With Diamonds imbroidered and bedight, Which lyke the stars in Gallixia shone, Whose luster still reflecting with the light, Presented heaven to all that ever gazed: Of force to make a world of eyes amazed. Upon a stately Jennet forth I rode, Caparisond with Pearle-enchased plumes, Trotting as though the Measures he had trode, Breathing Arabian Civit-sweet perfumes; Whose rarenes seemd to cast men in a traunce, Wondred of England, and admir'd of Fraunce. Like trident-maced Neptune in his pride, Mounted upon a Dolphin in a storme, Upon the tossing billowes forth doth ride, About whose trayne a thousand Trytons swarme, When Phœbus seemes to set the waves on fire, To shew his glory and the gods desire. Or like unto the fiery-faced Sunne Upon his wagon prauncing in the West, Whose blushing cheeks with flames seeme over-runne Whilst sweating thus he gallops to his rest. Such was the glory wherin now I stood, Which makes the Barrons sweat their deerest blood. Thus when these gallant companies were met, The King heer present with his lovely Queene, And all the Nobles in due order set, To heare and see what could be hard or seene: Loe heer that kindnes easely is discride, That faithful love which hee nor I could hide. Even like as Castor when a calme begins, Beholding then his starry-tressed brother, With mirth and glee these Swan-begotten twins Presaging joy, the one embrace the other: Thus one the other in our armes wee fold, Our breasts for joy, our harts could scarcely hold. Or like the Nimphe beholding in a Well, Her deerest love, &amp; wanting words to wooe him, About his necke with clipped armes she fell, Where by her fayth the gods conjoynd her to him. Such was the love which now by signes we breake, When joy had tied our tongues, we could not speak. Thus arme in arme towards London on wee rid, And like two Lambes we sport in every place, Where neither joy nor love could well be hid That might be seal'd with any sweet embrace: So that his Queene, might by our kindnes prove, Though shee his Wife, yet I alone his love. The Barrons now ambitious at my raigne, As one that stoode betwixt them and the Sunne, They underhand pursue me with disdaine, And play the game which I before had wonne: And malice now so hard the bellowes blew, That through myne eares the sparks of fier flew. Where in revenge, the tryumphes they devisd To entertaine the King with wondrous cost, Were by my malice suddainly surprisd, The charge, their summons, and their honours lost; Which in their thoughts revenge so deeply raysed, As with my blood they vow'd should be appeased. As when within the soft and spungie soyle, The wind doth peirce the intrals of the earth, Where hurly burly with a restlesse coile Shakes all the center, wanting issue forth, Tyll with the tumor Townes and Mountains tremble, Even such a meteor doth their rage resemble. Or when the shapeles huge Leviathan, Hath thrust himselfe upon the sandie shore, Where (Monster like) affrighting every man, He belloweth out a fearefull hydeous rore: Even such a clamor through the ayre doth thunder, The dolefull presage of some fearefull wonder. Thus as a plague unto the government, A very scourge to the Nobilitie, The cause of all the Commons discontent, The Image of all sentialitie, I was reproched openly of many, Hated of all, not pittied now of any. And as a vile misleader of the King, A wastfull spender of his coyne and treasure, A secret theefe of many a sacred thing, A Cormorant, in whom was never measure; I seemed hatefull now in all mens eyes, Buzzing about me like a swarme of flyes. Lyke as a clowde, foule, darke, and ugly black, Threatning the earth with tempest every howre, Now broken with a fearefull thunder-crack, Straight poureth down his deep earth-drenching showre, Thus for their wrongs now rise they up in armes, Or to revenge, or to amend theyr harmes. The King perceiving how the matter stood, Himselfe, his Crowne, in this extremity, And how the Barrons thirsted for my blood, And seeing now there was no remedy, That I some vile untimely death must die, Or thus, must be exiled presentlie: A thousand thoughts he hammereth in his head, Thinking on this, and now againe on that; As one devise is come, another fled, Some thing he would, and now he knowes not what. To helpe me now, a thousand meanes he forgeth, Whilst still with sighes his sorrowes he disgorgeth. And for I was his very soules delight, He thought on this, the onely way at last, In Ireland to hide me out of sight, Untill these stormes were over-blowne and past. And in meane time t'appease the Barrons hate, And so reduce me to my former state. And to give place unto the Barrons rage, Which flamed like a burning-quenchles brand, Which nought but my exile could now asswage, He sendes me post away to Ireland: And to eschew all danger by the way, Me safely guarded thither doth convay. As one whose house in danger to be burn'd, Which he hath builded with exceeding cost, And all his wealth to earth-pale ashes turn'd, Taking one Jewell which he loveth most, To some safe place doth with the same retyre, Leaving the rest to 'he mercy of the fire. Or as a Nurse within besieged walls, Dreading each howre the Souldiours slaughtering knife, Within some place as fittest there befalls, Hides her sweet babe in hope to save his life, Loe thus the King provideth now for mee The joy and pride of his felicitie. He wanted words t'expresse what he sustain'd, Nor could I speake to utter halfe my wrong, To shew his griefe, or where I most was payn'd, The time too short, the tale was all too long: I tooke my leave with sighes when forth I went, He streames of teares unto my farewell sent. But sending lookes, ambassadors of love, Which as our postes could goe and soone retire, By whose quicke motion we alone might prove, Our equall love did equall like desire: And that the fire in which we both did burne, Was easely quencht in hope of safe returne. Lyke to a vessell with a narrow vent, Which is fild up with liquor to the top, Although the mouth be ever eminent, Yet is it seene not to distyll a drop: Even so our breasts, brim-full with pensive care, Stopping our tongues, with griefe wee silent are. But when my want gave breath unto his moane, And that hys teares had now untide hys tongue, With drery sighes all now cleane over-blowne, Which earst (like Fountaines) in abundance sprunge, Unto hymselfe, hee thus complaines his griefe, Sith now the world could yeeld him no reliefe. O cursed stars (quoth he) that guyde my byrth, Infernall Torches, Comets of mis-fortune, Or Genius heer that haunts mee on the earth, Or hellish fiend that doest my woes importune: Fate-guiding Heavens, in whose unlucky mooving, Stands th'effect of my mishaps approoving. Tide-ceasles sorrow, which doest over-flow, Youth-withering cares, past compasse of conceite, Hart-kylling griefe, which more and more doest grow, And on the Anvile of my hart doest beate, Death-thirsting rage, styll deadly, mortall, endles, O poorest Prince! left desolate and freendles. Sky-covering clowdes, which thus do over-cast, And at my noone-tide darken all my sun, Blood-drying sicknes, which my life doest wast, When yet my glasse is but a quarter run: My joy but a phantasme and elusion, And my delights intending my confusion. What Planet raignd in that unluckie howre, When first I was invested in the Crowne? Or hath in my nativitie such powre, Or what vile Furie doth attend my Throne? Or els, what hellish hags be these that haunt mee? Yet if a King, why should mis-fortune daunt mee? Am I a Prince? yet to my people subject, That should be lov'd? yet thus am left forlorne, Ordaynd to rule? respected as an object, Live I to see mine honor had in scorne? Base dunghill mind, that doest such slavery bring, To live a pesant, and be borne a King. The purest steele doth never turne at lead, Nor Oke doth bow at every winde that blowes, Nor Lyon from a Lambe doth turne his head, Nor Eagle frighted with a flock of Crowes: And yet a King want courage in his breast, Trembling for feare to see his woes redrest. It rather fits a villaine then a state, To have his love on others lykings placed, Or set his pleasures at so base a rate, To see the same by every slave disgraced; A King should ever priviledge his pleasure, And make his Peers esteeme it as theyr treasure. Then rayse thy thoughts, and with thy thoughts thy love, Kings want no means t'accomplish what they would, If one doe faile, yet other maist thou prove, It shames a King, to say, If that I could. Let not thy love such crosses then sustaine, But rayse him up, and call him home againe. Sweet Gaveston, whose prayse the Angels sing, Maist thou assure thee of my love the while? Or what maist thou imagin of thy King, To let thee lyve in yonder brutish Ile? My deer, a space this wery world prolong, He lives, that can and shal revenge thy wrong. Thus like a man growne lunatick with paine, Now in his torments casts hym on his bed, Then out he runns into the fields againe, And on the ground doth rest his troubled head. With such sharpe passions is the King possest, Which day nor night doth let him take his rest. As Lyon-skind Alcides, when he lost His lovely Hylas, on hys way from Thrace, Followes the quest through many an unknowne coast, With playnts and out-cryes, wearying every place, Thus lovely Edward fils each place with moane, Wanting the sight of his sweet Gaveston. Thus lyke a Barge that wants both steere and sayles, Forc'd with the wind against the streamefull tyde, From place to place with every billow hayles, And (as it haps) from shore to shore doth ryde: Thus doth my case, thus doth my fortune stand, Betwixt the King, and Barrons of the Land. On this Dilemma stood my tickle state, Thus pro et contra all men doe dispute, Precisely ballanc't twixt my love and hate, Some doe affyrme, some other doe confute: Untill my King, (sweet Edward) now at last, Thus strikes the stroke which makes them all agast. Now calling such of the Nobility, As he supposed on his part would stand, By theyr consent he makes me Deputy. And being seated thus in Ireland, Of gold and silver sendeth me such store, As made the world to wonder more and more. Lyke great gold-coyning Crassus in his health, Amidst his legion long-mayntaining store, The glory of the Romane Common-wealth, Feasting the ritch, and gyving to the poore. Such was th'aboundance which I then possest, Blessed with gold, (if gold could make me blest.) Where, (like Lucullus,) I maintaind a port, As great god Bacchus had been late come downe, And in all pompe at Dublin kept my Court, As I had had th'revenewes of a Crowne. In trayne, in state, and every other thing, Attended still as I had been a King. Of this my wondrous hospitality, The Irish yet, untill this day can boast, Such was the bounty of a King to mee, His Chequer then could scarce defray the cost. His gyfts were such, I joyd in what he sent, He freely gave, and I as freely spent. Few daies there past but some the Channell crost, With kindest Letters enterlynd with love, Wheras I stil receiv'd by every post, His Ring, his Bracelet, Garter, or his Glove: Which I in hostage of his kindnes kept, Of his pure love, which liv'd and never slept. With many a ritch and stately ornament, Worne by great Kings, of hie and wondrous price, Or Jewell that my fancie might content, With many a robe of strange and rare device. That all which saw and knew this wondrous wast, Perceiv'd his treasure long time could not last. And thus whilst Fortune friendly cast my Dice, And tooke my hazard, and threw at the maine, I saw it was but folly to be nice, That chaunceth once, that seldome haps againe. I knew such bounty had been seldom seen, And since his time, I think hath never been. And now the Barrons which repynd before, Because I was too lavish of the treasure, And saw my wast consuming ten times more, Which doth so far exceed all bonds of measure, This (as a knife) theyr very hart-strings cuts, And gnawes them like the Collick in the guts. Thus (all in vaine,) they seek to stop the source, For presently it over-flowes the bounds, Yet well perceive, if thus it held his course, No question then, the Common wealth it drowns: And thus lyke men that tread an endlesse Maze, Whilst Fortune sports, the world stands at a gaze. Like Souldiers in a Towne surpriz'd by night, Over their heads the houses set on fire, Sure to be slayne in issuing out to fight, Or els be burned if they doe retyre: Some curse the time, some other blame their fortune, Whilst black Dispaire their deaths doth thus importune. This gracious King, (which seemd to sleep the while,) Finding the yron thus fully had his heat, With sweet perswasions fitly frames his stile: Which in theyr wits doth such a temper beate, With kindest lookes, and sweetest vowes of love, As were of force a Rock of flint to move. His clowdy frownes be turnd to sun-shine smyles, And those on whom he lowerd, he friendly graces, Theyr moody cheer, with sporting he beguiles, His Lyons lookes, be turnd to sweet imbraces, That with his will, theyr thoughts seeme to accord, Such is the love of subjects to their Lord. And having found his kindnes tooke effect, He followeth on the quest with hote pursute, Nor day, nor night, he doth the same neglect, Until the graff was growne to bring forth fruite: And that the Barrons all with might and maine, Now condiscend to call me home againe. O frayle and slyding state of earthly things, Blind Fortune, chance, worlds mutability, Advauncing pesants, and debasing Kings, Od hap, good luck, or star-bred destinie: Which stil doest fawne, and flatter me so oft, Now casts me downe, then sett'st me up aloft. In all post-hast, the King to Ireland sent His Princely Letters, for my safe returne, To England now I must incontinent, It seemes that time all malice hath out-worne. The Coast is cleer, occasion cals away, The gale stands right, and drives me from the Bay. My whistling sayles make musick with the wind, The boystrous waves doe homage to mine eyes, The brutish sort of Eols Imps seeme kind, And all the clowdes abandoning the skyes Now lovely Lædas egg-borne twins appeare: Towards Albyons clives faire Fortune guides my steere. The King is come to Chester, where he lyes, The Court prepared to receive me there In all the pompe that wit could well devise: As since that time was seldome seene elswhere. Where setting once my dainty foote on land, He thought him blest that might but kisse my hand. In pleasures there we spend the nights and dayes, And with our revels entertaine the time, With costly Banquets, Masks, and stately Playes, Painting our loves in many a pleasing rime. With rarest Musick, and sweet-tuned voyces, (In which the soule of man so much rejoyces.) Like as the famous brave Egiptian Queene, Feasted the Romane great Mark Anthony, With Pearl-disolv'd carouses, seldom seene, Serv'd all in vessell of ritch Ivory: Such was the sumptuous banquets he prepard, In which no cost or curious thing was spard. Or like the Troyan Pryam, when as he Beheld his long-lost sonn returne to Troy, Tryumphing now in all his jolitie, Proud Ilion smokes with th'orges of his joy, Such are our feasts and stately tryumphs heer, Which with applauses, sound in every eare. Departing thence from Chesters pleasant side, Towards London now we travel with delight, Wher every Citty likewise doth provide To entertaine us, with some pleasing sight: Tyl all our trayne at length to London comes, Wher naught is hard, but Trumpets, bels and drums. As when Paulus Aemilius entred Roome, And like great Jove, in starlike tryumph came, Honored in Purple by the Senats doome, Laden with gold, and crowned with his fame. Such seems our glory now in all mens eyes, Our friendship honored with applaudities. Or when old Phillips time still-wondred son, In his worlds conquest surfetting with spoiles, The scourge of Kings, returns to Babilon, To sport and banquet after all his toiles, Such is our glory in our London Court, Whereto all Nations dailie make resort. And thus blind Fortune lulls mee in her lap, And rocks mee still, with many a Syrens song, Thus plac'd mee on the Atlas of my hap, From which shee means to cast mee downe ere long. Black ugly fiend, O foule mishapen evill, In shew an Angel, but in deed a divel. Even as a Lyon got into his pawes The silly Lambe, seems yet a while to play, Till seeking to escape out of his jawes, This beastly King now tears it for his pray. Thus having got mee in her armes so fast, Determins now to feed on mee at last. Or as the slaughter-man doth fat the beast, Which afterward he meaneth shall be slayne, Before provided to some solemne feast, The more therby he may increase his gaine, Loe, thus proud Fortune feeds mee for the knife, For which (it seems) shee had prepard my life. For thus ere long, between the King and mee, As erst before, our revels now begin, And now the Barrons taste theyr misery, Opening theyr eyes, which makes them see theyr sin, The plague once past, they never felt the sores, Till thus againe it haps within theyr dores. Like as a man made drunk with foule excess, Drowning his soule in thys vile lothly vice, Once being sober, sees his beastliness, Buying repentance with so deer a price; Thus they perceive the bondage they possest, In condiscending to the Kings request. The damned Furies heer unbong the source, From whence the Lethe of my vertues burst, The black-borne Fates heere labour in that course, By which my lyfe and fortune came accurst. My death in that star-guiders doome concealed, Now in the browes of heaven may be revealed. My youth spurrs on my fraile untam'd desire, Yeelding the raynes to my lascivious will, Upon the Ise I take my ful careire, The place too slippery, and my manidge ill, Thus like a Colt, in danger to be cast, Yet still runn on, the divel drives so fast. Now wandring in a Laborinth of error, Lost in my pride, no hope of my returne, Of sin and shame my life a perfect mirror, No spark of vertue once is seen to burne. Nothing there was could be discernd in me, But beastly lust, and censualitie. Black Hecate chaunts on her night-spell charmes, Which cast me first into this deadly sleep, Whilst fier-eyd Ate clips me in his armes, And hayles me down to dark Herebus deep. Foule sleep-god Morpheus, curtains up the light, And shuts my fame in everlasting night. The fixed starrs in their repugnacie, Had full concluded of these endles jarrs, And nature by some strange Antipathy, Had in our humors bred continuall warrs. Or the star-ceeled heavens by fatall doome, Ordaind my troubles in my Mothers wombe. Some hellish hagg in thys inchaunted cup, Out of the Tun of pryde this poyson drew, And those hote cinders which were raked up, Into the nostrils of the Nobles blew. Who now caroused to my funerall, And (with a vengeance) I must pledge them all. And now brake out that execrable rage, Which long before had boyled in theyr blood, Which neither tyme nor reason could asswage: But like to men growne lunatick and wood, My name and fame, they seeke to scandelize, And roote the same from all posterities. They all affyrme, my Mother was a Witch, A filthy hagg, and burnt for sorcery: And I her son, and fitting with her pitch, Shee had bequeath'd her damned Art to mee. Thys rumor in the peoples eares they ring, That (for my purpose) I bewitcht the King. They say, that I convayd beyond the Sea, The Table and the tressels all of gold, King Arthurs reliques, kept full many a day, The which to Windsor did belong of old. In whose faire margent (as they did surmize,) Merlin ingraved many prophecies. Some slaunderous tongues, in spightful manner sayd, That heer I liv'd in filthy sodomy, And that I was King Edwards Ganemed, And to this sinn hee was intic'd by mee. And more, (to wreck their spightfull deadly teene,) Report the same to Isabel the Queene. A Catilogue of tytles they begun, With which I had the Noble men abus'd, Which they avouch't I never durst have done, If by the King I had not been excus'd. And swore, that he maintaind against the state, A monster, which both God and man did hate. They swore, the King subbornd my villanie, And that I was his instrument of vice, The means wherby he wrought his tyranny, That to his chaunce I ever cast the dice; And with most bitter execrations ban, The tyme in which, our friendship first began. Loe, heer drawes on my drery dismall hower, The dolefull peryod of my desteny, Heer doth approch the black and ugly shower, Hence flowes the Deluge of my misery. Heer comes the clowde that shuts up all my light, My lowring Winter, and eternall night. The angry Barrons now assembled were, And no man left that on my part durst stand, Before the Popes pernitious Legate there, They forced mee for to abjure the Land. Forcing the King to further their intent, By solemne oth upon the Sacrament. Upon the holie Sacrament hee swears, Although (God knowes) ful much against his will, So over-come with silence, sighes, and teares, To make a sword the which himselfe should kill. And being done, (in doing then not long,) He seemes to curse his hand, his hart, his tongue. Like to a man that walking in the grass, Upon a Serpent suddainlie doth tread, Plucks back his foote, and turnns away his face, His couller fading, pale as he were dead: Thus hee the place, thus he the act doth shun, Lothing to see, what he before had done. Or as a man mistaking a receite, Some death-strong poyson happely doth taste, And every howre the vigor doth awaite, Apald with feare, now standeth all agast. Thus stands he trembling in an extasie, Too sick to live, and yet too strong to die. Hee takes his Crowne, and spurnns it at his feet, His princely robes hee doth in peeces teare, Hee straight commaunds the Queene out of his sight, Hee tuggs and rents his golden-tressed haire. He beates his breast, and sighes out pittious groans, Spending the day in tears, the night in moans. Lyke as the furious Paladine of Fraunce, Forsaken of Angelica the fayre, So like a Bedlam in the fields doth daunce, With shouts and clamors, filling all the ayre, Tearing in peeces what so ere hee caught, With such a furie is the King distraught. Or when the wofull Thrace-borne Hecuba, Saw Troy on fire, and Pryams fatall doome, Her sonns all slayne, her deer Polixina, There sacrifized on Achilles Tombe, Even like a Bore, her angry tusks doth whet, Scratching and byting all that ere shee met. With fearefull visions frighted in his bed, Which seemes to hym a very thorny brake, With ugly shapes which way he turnns his head: And when from sleep hee ever doth awake, Hee then againe with weeping mournfull cryes, In griefe of soule, complains hys miseries. Hee wants disgesture, and refrains his rest, His eyes ore-watched like eclipsed sunns, With bitter passions is his soule opprest, And through his eyes, his brayne disolved runns. And after silence, when with payne he speakes, A suddaine sigh his speech in sunder breakes. Hee starteth up, and Gaveston doth call, Then stands hee still, and lookes upon the ground, Then like one in an Epileps doth fall, As in a Spasmo, or a deadly sound; Thus languishing in payne, and lingering ever, In the Symptoma of his pyning fever. Lyke to a flower that droupeth in a frost, Or as a man in a Consumption pyning, Staynd like a Cloth that hath his culler lost, Or Poets-worne Lawrell when shee is declyning: Or lyke a Pecock washed in the rayne, Trayling adowne his starry-eyed trayne. To Belgia I cross the narrow seas, And in my breast a very sea of griefe, Whose tide-full surges never give me ease, For heaven and earth hath shut up all reliefe, The ayre doth threaten vengeaunce for my crime, Clotho drawes out the thred of all my time. Like as that wicked Brother-killing Caine, Flying the presence of his mighty God, Accurst to die, forbidden to be slaine, A vagabond, and wandring still abroad. In Flaunders thus I travell all alone, Still seeking rest, yet ever finding none. Or as the Monarch of great Babilon, Whose monstrous pride the Lord did so detest, As hee out-cast him from his princely throne, And in the field hee wandred like a beast: Companion with the Oxe and lothly Ass, Starv'd with the cold, and feeding on the grass. Thus doe I change my habite and my name, From place to place, I pass unknowne of any; But swift report so far had spred my fame, I hear my life and youth controld of many; The bouzing Flemings in their boistrous tongue, Still talking on me as I pass along. O wretched, vile, and miserable man, Besotted so with worldly vanitie, When as thy life is but a verie span, Yet everie howre full of calamitie. Begot in sinn, and following still the game, Living in lust, and dying oft with shame. Now working means to have intelligence, By secrete Letters from my Lord the King, How matters stood since I departed thence, And of the tearms and state of every thing, I cast about which way I might devise, (In spight of all) once more to play my prize. And still relying on King Edwards love, To whom before my life had been so deere, Whose constancie my fortune made me prove; And to my Brother, Earle of Glocester, And to my wife, who labored tooth and naile, My abjuration how shee might appeale. I now embarck mee in a Flemish Hoy, Disguised in the habite of a Muffe, Attended thus with neyther man nor boy, But on my back a little bagg of stuffe: Like to a Souldier that in Campe of late, Had been imployd in service with the state. And safely landed on thys blessed shore, Towards Windsor thus disguis'd I tooke my way, Wheras I had intelligence before, My wife remaind, and there my Edward lay. My deerest wife, to whom I sent my ring, Who made my comming known unto the King. As when old-youthful Eson in his glass, Saw from his eyes the cheerfull lightning sprung, When as Art-spell Medea brought to pass, By hearbs and charms, againe to make him young, Thus stood King Edward, ravisht in the place, Fixing his eyes upon my lovely face. Or as Muse-mervaile Hero, when she clips, Her deer Leanders byllow-beaten limms, And with sweet kisses seazeth on his lips, When for her sake deep Hellespont he swimms, Might by our tender-deer imbracings prove, Fayre Heros kindnes, and Leanders love. Or like the twifold-twynned Geminy, In their star-gilded gyrdle strongly tyed, Chayn'd by their saffrond tresses in the sky, Standing to guard the sun-coche in his pride. Like as the Vine, his love the Elme imbracing, With nimble armes, our bodies interlacing. The Barrons hearing how I was arrived, And that my late abjurement naught prevailed, By my returne, of all their hope deprived, Theyr bedlam rage no longer now concealed: But as hote coles once puffed with the wind, Into a flame outbreaking by their kind. Like to a man whose foote doth hap to light, Into the nest where stinging Hornets ly, Vext with the spleen, and rising with despight, About his head these winged spirits fly. Thus rise they up with mortall discontent, By death to end my life and banishment. Or like to souldiers in a Towne of war, When Sentinell the enemy discries, Affrighted with this unexpected jar, All with the fearefull Larum-bell arise, Thus muster they; (as Bees doe in a hyve, The idle Drone out of their combes to dryve.) It seemd the earth with heaven grew malecontent, Nothing is hard but warrs and Armors ringing, New stratagems each one doth now invent, The Trumpets shril their warlike poynts be singing, Each souldiour now, his crested plume advances, They manidge horses, and they charge their launces. As when under a vast and vaulty roofe, Some great assembly happily appears, A man (from thence) that standeth out a loofe, A murmuring confused rumor hears. Such is the noyse, from earth to heaven rebounding, With shrikes and clamors every where resounding. Lyke as the Ocean chafing with hys bounds, With raging billowes flyes against the Rocks, And to the shore sends forth his hydeous sounds, Making the earth to tremble with his shocks; Even thus the murmure flyes from shore to shore, Lyke to the Canons battering fearefull rore. By day and night attended still with spyes, The Court become the cause of al our woes, The Country now a Campe of enemies, The Citties, all be-peopled with our foes. Our very beds are snares made to enwrap us, Our surest guard (as Traytors) doe intrap us. Like to a cry of roring-mouthed hounds, Rouzing the long-liv'd stagg out of his layre, Pursue the chase through vastie forrest grounds, So lyke a thunder ratling in the ayre, Thus doe they hunt us, still from coast to coast, Most hated now, of those we loved most. Thys gracious Prince loe thus becomes my guide, And with a Convoy of some chosen friends, Brings mee to Yorke, where being fortified, To Balioll the King of Scots hee sends, And to the Welchmen, craving both their ayde, That by their help the Barrons might be stayd. But they which in their busines never slept, And (as it seemd) had well fore-seen thys thing, Cause all the Ports and Marches to be kept, That none should enter once to ayde the King: And by disswasive Letters still devise, To stay theyr neighbors from this enterprize. Loe, in this sort the King and I betrayd, And to their wills thus left as wofull thralls, And finding now no further hope of ayde, We shut us up within Yorkes aged walls, Untill we knew the Barrons full intent, And what all this rude hurly burly meant. This gracious King, for want of wonted rest, Fallen in these passions to an extasie, With grievous sicknes is so sore opprest, And grown in time to such extreamity, As he is forced to depart away, To take the ayre awhile upon the Sea. From Bedford now (the synod of their shame, The counsell house of all their villany,) These bloody Barrons with an Army came, Downe unto York, where they besieged mee: That now not able to resist their might, Am forst perforce, to flye away by night. To Scarborough with speed away I post, With that small force the Citty then could lend me, The strongest Castell there in all the coast, And (as I thought) the surest to defend me, Where as I might withstand them by my power, Hoping the Kings returning every howre. But now, like to a sousing suddaine raine, Forc'd by a strong and sturdy easterne blast, Or (like a hayle-storme) downe they come amaine, And in the Castell gert me now so fast, No way to scape, nor hope for mee to flie, My choyce was hard, or yeeld my selfe, or die. Away thus (like a prysoner) am I led, My costly robes in peeces rent and torne, Bound hand and foote, my haire disheviled, Naked and bare as ever I was borne, Save but for shame, to stop the peoples cryes, With griefe am clothed of mine enemies. Along the Land, toward Oxford they convay mee, Like bauling currs, they all about mee houle: With words of foule reproch they now repay mee, Wondring my shame, as byrds doe at an Owle. Cursing my life, my manners, and my birth, A scourge of God, ordaind to plague the earth. The King, now hearing how I was arested, And knew my quarrell cause of all this strife, He writes, he sends, he sues, he now requested, Using all means he could to save my life: With vowes and othes, that all should be amended, If that my death alone might be suspended. And being brought to Dedington at last, By Aymer Valence, Earle of Pembrook then, Who towards King Edward rode in all the hast, And left mee guarded safelie by his men. This gentle Earle with meer compassion moved, For Edwards sake, whom hee so deerly loved. But now Guy Beuchampe, whom I feared still, The Earle of Warwick, whom I called curr, Having fit time to execute his will, The Foxe thus caught, he vowes to teare my furr. And he for whom so oft he sett the trap, By good ill luck, is fallen into his lap. This bloody Beuchampe, (I may tearme him so,) For this was he that onely sought my blood, Now at the up-cast of mine over-throw, And on the chaunce wheron my fortune stood, To Dedington hee came, where as I lay, And by his force, hee tooke mee thence away. To Warwick thus along hee doth mee bring, And keeps me guarded in the Castell there, And doubting now my succour from the King, Hee rayseth up the power of Warwick-shiere. Thus from the Towne, to Blacklow I was led, And on a Scaffold there, I lost my head. Loe, heer the point and sentence of my time, My lives full stop, my last Catastrophe, The stipend of my death-deserved cryme, The Scene that ends my wofull tragedy. My latest Vale, knitting my conclusion, Mine utter ruine, and my fames confusion. Like as Adonis wounded with the Bore, From whose fresh hurt the life-warme blood doth spin, Now lyeth wallowing in his purple gore, Stayning his faire and Alablaster skin: My headles bodie in the blood is left, Now lying breathles, and of life bereft. O now my Muse, put on thy Eagles wings, O lend some comfort to my tired ghost, And with Apollos dolefull-tuned strings, Now help at need, for now I need thee most. Sorrow posses my hart, mine eyes, myne ears, My breath consume to sighs, my braine to tears. My soule now in the heavens eternall glass, Beholds the scarrs and botches of her sin, How filthy, uglie, and deformd shee was, The lothsome dunghill that shee wallowed in. Her pure Creator sitting in his glory, With eyes of justice to peruse her storie. Like as a stagg at bay amongst the hounds, The bloodie Mott still sounding in his ears, Feeling his breath diminish by his wounds, Poures downe his gummy life-preserving tears; Even thus my soule, now bayted by my sin, Consuming shewes the sorrow shee is in. Thus comfortles, forsaken and alone, All worldlie things unstable, and unsure, By true contrition flyes to him alone, In whose compare, the heavens are most impure. By whose just doome, to blessed soules revealed, Shee gets her pasport to Elisia sealed. And by repentance, finds a place of rest, Where passing to the faire Elisian plaine, Shee is aloud her roome amongst the blest, In those Ambrosian shadowes to remaine. Till summond thus by Fame, shee is procur'd, To tell my life that hath been thus obscur'd. This monster now, this many-headed beast, The people, more unconstant then the wind, Who in my life, my life did so detest, Now in my death, are of another mind: And with the fountains from their teareful eyes, Doe honor to my latest obsequies. Star-holding heaven hath shut up all her light, Nature become a stepdam to her owne, The mantled trouch-man of the Raven-hued night, In mournfull Sables clad the Horizon. The sky-borne Planets seeming to conspire, Against the ayre, the water, earth, and fire. Pearle-paved Avon, in her streamfull course, With heavy murmure floting on the stones, Mov'd with lament to pitty and remorse, Attempering sad musick to my moans, Tuning her billowes to Zephyrus breath, In watry language doth bewaile my death. Oke-shadowed Arden, fild with bellowing cries, Resounding through her holts and hollow grounds, To which the Eccho ever-more replies, And to the fields sends forth her hideous sounds, And in her Silvan rude untuned songs, Makes byrds, and beasts, for to express my wrongs. The heaven-dyed flowers in this happy clyme, Mantling the Medowes in their Summers pride, As in the wofull frostie winter time, Drouping with faintnes, hold their heads aside. The boystrous storms, dispoile the greenest greves, Stripping the Trees stark naked of their leaves. Death clad in liveries of my lovely cheeks, Layd in those beds of Lillyes and of Roses, Amaz'd with mervaile, heere for wonders seeks, Where he alone a Paradice supposes, Grew malcontent, and with himselfe at strife, Not knowing now if hee were death or life. And shutting up the casements of those lyghts, Which like two sunns, so sweetly went to rest, In those faire globes he saw those heavenly sights, In which alone he thought him onely blest. Cursing himselfe, who had deprived breath, From that which thus could give a life in death. With palenes touching that fayre rubied lip, Now waxing purple, like Adonis flower, Where Ivory walls those rocks of Curral keep, From whence did flow that Nectar-streaming shower, There earth-pale Death refresht his tired limms, Where Cupid bath'd hym in those Christall brimms. And entring now into that house of glory, That Temple with sweet Odors long perfumed, Where nature had ingraved many a story, In Letters, which by death were not consumed. Accursed now, his crueltie he curst, That Fame should live, when he had done hys worst. Now when the King had notice of my death, And that hee saw his purpose thus prevented, In greevous sighes hee now consumes his breath, And into tears his very eyes relented: Cursing that vile and mercy-wanting age, And breakes into this passion in his rage. O heavens (quoth hee) lock up the living day, Cease sunn to lend the world thy glorious light, Starrs, flye your course, and wander all astray, Moone, lend no more thy silver shine by night. Heavens, starrs, Sunn, Moone, conjoyne you all in one, Revenge the death of my sweet Gaveston. Earth, be thou helples in thy creaturs berth, Sea, break thou forth from thy immured bound, Ayre, with thy vapors poyson thou the earth, Wind, break thy Cave, and all the world confound. Earth, sea, ayre, wind, conjoyne you all in one, Bewaile the death of my sweet Gaveston. You savage beasts, that haunt the way-less woods, You Birds delighted in your Silvan sound, You scaly Fish, that swim in pleasant floods, You hartless Wormes that creep upon the ground, Beasts, birds, fish, wormes, each in your kind alone, Revenge the death of my sweet Gaveston. Faire Medowes, be you withered in the prime, Sun-burnt and bare, be all the goodly Mountains, Groves, be you leaveless in the Summer time, Pitchy and black be all the Christall Fountains: All things on earth, each in your kind alone, Revenge the death of my sweet Gaveston. You damned Furies, break your Stigian Cell, You wandring spirits, in water, earth, and ayre, Lead-boyling ghosts, that live in lowest hell, Gods, divels, men, unto mine ayde repayre, Come all at once, conjoyne you all in one, Revenge the death of my sweet Gaveston. Eyes, never sleep, untill you see revenge, Head, never rest, until thou plot revenge, Hart, never think, but tending to revenge, Hands, never act, but acting deep revenge. Just-dooming heavens, revenge mee from above, That men unborne may wonder at my love. You peerles Poets of ensuing times, Chanting Heroique Angel-tuned notes, Or humble Pastors Nectar-filled lines, Driving your flocks with musick to their coats, Let your hie-flying Muses still bemoane, The wofull end of my sweet Gaveston. My earth-pale body now enbalmd with tears, To famous Oxford solemnly convaid, There buried by the ceremonious Friers, Where for my soule was many a Trentall said. With all those rites my obsequies behoved, Whose blind devotion, time and truth reproved. But ere two yeeres were out and fully dated, This gracious King who still my fame respected, My wasted bones to Langley thence translated, And over mee a stately Tombe erected. Which world-devouring Time, hath now out-worne, As but for Letters, were my name forlorne. My ghost now hence to Ankor shall repayre, Where once the same appeared unto thee: And unto chaste Idea tell my care, A sacrifice both for thy selfe and mee. In whose sweet bosome all the Muses rest, In whose aspect our Clyme is onely blest. Thus having told my drery dolefull tale, My time expir'd, I now returne againe, Where Carons Barge hoyst with a merrie gale, Shall land mee on the faire Elisian plaine: Where, on the Trees of never dying fame, There will I carve Ideas sacred name. And thou sweet Dorus, whose sole Phœnix Muse, With Pegase wings doth mount unto the sky, Whose lines the gods are fittest to peruse. My lovelie Dorus, lend thine humble eye, To my harsh stile, (deer friend) at my request, In whose conceit my verse is onely blest. My deer Mæcenas, lend thine eyes awhile, From Meredian's sun-bred stately straine: And from thy rare and lofty flying stile, Looke downe into my low and humble vaine: On this same babe my Muse hath now brought forth, Till shee present thee with some lines of worth. Divers have been the opinions, of the byrth and first rysing of Gaveston, (amongst the Writers of these latter times:) some omitting things worthy of memory, some inferring things without probabilitie, disagreeing in many particulars, and cavelling in the circumstances of his sundry banishments; which hath bred some doubt amongst those who have but slightly run over the History of his fortune, seeing every man rove by his owne ayme in this confusion of opinions: Although most of them concluding in generall, of his exceeding credite with the King, of the maner of his death, and of the pompe wherin he lyved. Except some of those Writers who lyved in the tyme of Edward the second, wherin he onely florisht, or immediatly after, in the golden raigne of Edward the third, when as yet his memory was fresh in every mans mouth: whose authorities (in myne opinion) can hardlie be reproved of any, the same beeing within the compasse of possibility, and the Authors names extant, avouching what they have written. On whom I onely relyed in the plot of my History; having recourse to some especiall collections, gathered by the industrious labours of John Stow, a diligent Chronigrapher of our time. A man very honest, exceeding painfull, and ritch in the antiquities of this Ile: yet omitting some small things of no moment, fearing to make his Tragedy more troublesome, amongst so many currants as have fallen out in the same: framing my selfe to fashion a body of a hystorie, without maime or deformitie. Which if the same be accepted thankfully, as I offer it willingly, in contenting you, I onely satisfie my selfe. M. D. FINIS. MATILDA. The faire and chaste Daughter of the Lord Robert Fitzwater. THE TRVE GLORIE OF THE NOBLE HOVSE OF SVSSEX. Phœbus erit nostri princeps, &amp; carminis author. TO THE NOBLE AND VERTUOUS Gentlewoman, worthy of all honor, Mistres Lucie Harrington, Daughter to the Honorable Gentleman, Sir JOHN HARRINGTON, Knight. THE VISION OF MATILDA. Me thought I saw upon Matildas Tombe, Her wofull ghost, which Fame did now awake, And crav'd her passage from Earths hollow wombe, To view this Legend, written for her sake; No sooner shee her sacred Name had seene, Whom her kind friend had chose to grace her story, But wiping her chast teares from her sad eyen, Shee seem'd to tryumph, in her double glory. Glory shee might, that his admired Muse, Had with such method fram'd her just complaint: But proude shee was, that reason made him chuse, To patronize the same to such a Saint: In whom her rarest vertues might be showne, Though Poets skill should fayle to make them knowne. H. G. Esquire. [Thy learned Poeme (Friend) I will not prayse] Thy learned Poeme (Friend) I will not prayse, Nor will commend Matildas chastitie, Shee by thy Muse, her fame from grave doth rayse, And hie conceit, thy lines doth dignifie. But that in this, the honour thou doost give, To that sweet Maide in whose unspotted minde, Matildas rarest vertues yet doe live, As two so like the world can hardly finde. Fayre Lucie with Matilda but compare, In all regards of perfect modestie, And see how like in every good they are, And then thy choyce with judgement ratifie. And I who know the worth of thy fit choyce, Approve it good, both with my pen and voyce. Anonimos. [Teares in your eyes, and passions in your harts] Teares in your eyes, and passions in your harts, With mournfull grace vouchsafe Matildas story: The subject sad, a King to act the parts Of his owne shame, to others endlesse glory. But such is sinne, where lawlesse lust is raigning, Sweet to the taste, till all turnes to infection, When count is cast, a reckoning is remaining, Which must be payd, but not at our election. Perrill and Greefe, the interest of Pleasure, Spending the stock that Danger long was gayning, Makes soule and body banckrupt of that treasure, Which vainly spent, what helps our fond complayning? O that my lines could so the Author grace, As well his vertues merit prayse and place. R. L. Esquire. To. M. DRAYTON. I like thy worke, and doe allow thy wit, And prayse thy choyce in patronizing it: Yet more, that thou the honor doost impart, To Lucies prayse, a Mayd of such desart. Who for her rarest vertues doth exceede, Nor never age a better wit did breede. A blessed Impe, sprong from a noble race, Admir'd for gyfts, and beautified with grace; A Phenix deck, yet not with plumes of gold, But with true Jemmes of heavens eternall mould. Then happy man in thy Matildas fame, Happy Matilda in rare Lucies name, Devise of wit, by Graces onely graced, Adorned skill, in vertue highly placed, Yet subject, wit, and skill be all to fewe, In chast Matilda, for rare Lucies due. W. G. Esquire. MATILDA. If to this time some sacred Muse retaine, Those choise regards by perfect vertue taught, And in her chast and virgine-humble vaine, Doth kindly cherrish one pure Mayden thought, In whom my death hath but true pitty wrought, By her I crave my life may be reveald, Which blacke oblivion hath too long conceald. Or on the earth if mercy may be found, Or if remorce may touch the harts of men, Or eyes may lend me teares to wash my wound, Or passion be exprest by mortall pen, Yet may I hope of some compassion then: Three hundreth yeeres by all men over past, Now finding one to pittie mee at last. You blessed Impes of heavenly chastitie, You sacred Vestalls, Angels onely glory, Right presidents of imortalitie, Onely to you I consecrate my storie. It shall suffise for mee if you be sorie. If you alone shall deigne to grace his verse, Which serves for odours to perfume my hearse. Let your delicious heaven-distilling teares, Soften the earth to send mee from her wombe, With Conquerors Lawrell crowne my golden haires, With flowry garlands beautifie my tombe, Be you the Heralds to proclaime me roome, With sable Cypresse maske your lovely eyes, Mourning my death with dolefull Elegies. Faire Rosamond, of all so highly graced, Recorded in the lasting Booke of Fame, And in our Sainted Legendarie placed, By him who strives to stellifie her name, Yet will some Matrons say she was to blame. Though all the world bewitched with his ryme, Yet all his skill cannot excuse her cryme. Lucrece, of whom proude Rome hath boasted long, Lately reviv'd to live another age, And here ariv'd to tell of Tarquins wrong, Her chast deniall, and the Tyrants rage, Acting her passions on our stately stage, She is remembred, all forgetting me, Yet I as fayre and chast, as ere was she. Shores wife is in her wanton humor sooth'd, And modern Poets, still applaud her praise, Our famous Elstreds wrinckled browes are smooth'd, Call'd from her grave to see these latter daies, And happy's hee, their glory high'st can raise. “Thus looser wantons, still are praisd of many, “Vice oft findes friends, but vertue seldome any. O faire Charites, Joves most deere delight, O lend me now one heaven-inchanting lay, And you rare Nimphes which please Apollos sight, Bring spreading Palme and never-dying Bay, With Olive branches strew the pleasant way: And with your Viols sound one pleasing straine, To ayde his Muse, and raise his humble vaine. And thou ô Beta, Soveraigne of his thought, Englands Diana, let him thinke on thee, By thy perfections let his Muse be taught, And in his breast so deepe imprinted be, That he may write of sacred Chastitie: Though not like Collin in thy Britomart, Yet loves as much, although he wants his arte. O my dread Soveraigne, rare and princely Mayd, From whose pure eyes the world derives her light, In Angels robes with majestie arayd, In whom true vertue is defin'd aright: O let these lines be gracious in thy sight, In whom alone, as in a perfect glas, All may discerne how chast Matilda was. To brag of birth, or noblesse, were but vaine, Although I might compare me with the best: “To challenge that our Auncesters did gaine, “A royall minde such follie doth detest, Which I omit and here set downe my rest: “Of vertuous life I meane to boast alone, “Our birth is theirs, our vertues are our owne. “A shame to fetch our long discent from Kings, “And from great Jove derive our pedigree, “The brave atchivements of a hundred things, “Breathing vaine boastes the worlde to terrifie, “If wee our selves doe blot with infamie, “And staine that blood and honor which is theirs: “Men cannot leave their vertues to their heyres. The Heaven became a Midwife at my birth, A kind Lucina, gently helping Nature: Some sacred power then present on the earth, Fore-telling rare perfection in a creature, As all men judg'd by so divine a feature: Yet as my beautie seem'd to ravish all, Vertue made beauty more angelicall. Upon my brow, sate Honor in her pride, Tables containing heavens divinest law, Whose snowie margent quoted on each side, With such delights as all mens harts coulde draw, My thoughts (as Tutors) kept mine eyes in awe, From their rare Sun-beames darting forth such raies, As well the worke might shew the Arts-mans praise. These Cherubins, the Tree of life doe keepe, These Dragons, watch the faire Hesperian fruite, These fiery Serpents, guard the golden sheepe, These fixed stars, their rayes like lightning shute, At whose approch the wise were striken mute. These eyes, which onely could true vertues measure, Ordain'd by Nature to preserve her treasure. My words were gracefull, pleasing to the wise, My speech retayning modest decencie, Not fondlie vaine, nor foolishlie precize, But sweetlie tun'd, with such a simphony, Mooving all hearers with the harmonie. Gracing my tale with such an Emphasis, As never Musicke could delight like this. My face the sunne, adorning beauties sky, The Booke where heaven her wonders did enrole, A stately Pharus to each wandring eye, And like a Syren could enchaunt the soule, Which had the power the proudest to controle. To whom this gift my Maker had assigned, That there, all eyes like southsayers divined. Natures fayre Ensigne, roiallie displai'd, Map of Elisium, Eden without night, Ermins wherein rich Phœbus is arai'd, Right prospective, reflecting heavenly light, Hart-wounding arrow, pearcing with the sight. Bright mornings lustre, Joves high exaltation, Load-starre of love, rare Carde of admiration. True type of honor, fine dilicious varry, The richest coate that ever beautie bare, Pure colours, which the heavens doe onlie carry, O uncouth blazon, so exceeding rare, O curious lymming, passing all compare, First at my birth assigned unto mee, By that great King of heavenly Heraldrie. From hence my praise began to prove her wing, Which to the heaven could carry up my fame, Of all my glorie now began the spring, Through every Coast this still enlarg'd my name, From hence the cause of all my sorrowes came: “Thus to this Hydra are we subject still, “Who dares to speake, not caring good or ill. This jealous Monster hath a thousand eyes, Her ayrie body hath as many wings: Now on the earth, then up to heaven she flies, And heere and there with every wind she flings, From every Coast her rumors foorth shee brings; Nothing so secret but to her appeareth, And apt to credit every thing shee heareth. Foule blabbing tel-tale, secrets soone bewrayer, Thou ayre-bred Eccho, whisperer of lyes: Shril-sounding trumpet, trueths unkind betrayer, False larum-bel, awaking dead-mens eyes, Uncertaine rumor, wandring in the skyes: Fond pratling Parrat, telling all thou hearest, Oft furthest of when as thou should'st be nearest. “The Princes eares are open to report, “Ther's skill in blazing beauty to a King; “To censure, is the subject of the Court, “From thence Fame carries, thether Fame doth bring, “There, to each word a thousand ecchos ring: “A Lottery, where most loose, but few doe win, “Few love Religion, many follow sin. Loe, heere at first my beauty plaid her prize, Heere where my vertues seldome prized be, Yet that which most seem'd wondred of the wise, Confin'd by vertue, cleerelie made me see, What dangers were attending still on me: Which most desir'd, for why esteem'd most rare, Guarded I kept with most especiall care. This, whole possest the thoughts of princelie John, This, on his hart-strings Angels musick made, This, was the subject which he wrought upon, That deepe impression which could never fade, Reason which might sufficiently perswade: Hence sprong that greefe, which never gave him rest, This was the spirit wher-with hee was possest. This, had commission to commaund his Crowne, In all his course, conducted by this starre, This, with a smile could cleere each cloudie frowne, This, conquered him, which conquered all in warre, This, calm'd his thoughts in every bloody jarre, This, taught his eyes their due attendance still, This, held the raines which rul'd his princely will. Controuling Love, proud Fortunes busie Factor, The gaule of wit, sad Melancholies schoole, Hart-killing corsive, golden times detractor, Life-fretting canker, mischiefes poysoned toole, The Ideots idoll, but the wise mans foole: A foe to friendship, enemie to trueth, The wrong misleader of our pleasing youth. My vertuous father, famous then in Court, Who liv'd in pompe, and Lorded with the best, Whose minde was troubled with this strange report, As one enshrining honor in his brest, And as a man who ever lov'd me best: Fore-saw the danger of such secret spyes, Who still attended on the Princes eyes. And he, who in the Kings own bosome slept, Experience taught his deepest thoughts to sound, Yet in his brest, the same he secret kept, Nor would disclose the thing which he had found, Who being hurt must needs conceale his wound. “For why he knew, it was a dangerous thing, “In rule, or Love, but once to crosse a King. And finding lust had kindled all this fire, And his affections in extreames consisted, He greatly fear'd his youthfull vaine desire, Might grow impatient, being once resisted: Yet in his humor, sith he still persisted, With me his childe, thought fittest to perswade, Ere further he into the deepe durst wade. Sweete gyrle (quoth he) the glory of my life, The blessed and sole object of mine eyes, For whom the Heavens with Nature fell at strife, On whom the hope of all my fortune lies, Whose youth, my age with comfort still supplies. Whose very sight my drouping hart doth raise, And doth prolong thy aged fathers dayes. Thou seest, a world upon thy youth awaite, That Paradice, where all delightes do growe, Thy peerlesse Beautie made so faire a baite, The Bursse where Nature sets her ware to show, Where blushing Roses, sleepe in beds of snowe. The heavens have fring'd thy fore-head with their gold; That glasse where heaven her-selfe may well behold. “All gaze at Comets, choysest things be best, “The rarest pearles are ever dearest prized, “Seldom wants guests, where Beautie bids the feast, “Mens eyes with wonders never are suffised, “At fairest signes, best welcome is surmised. “The shrine of Love, doth seldom offrings want. “Nor with such counsel, Clyents never scant. “Honor is grounded on the tickle Ice, “The purest Lawne, most apt for every spot, “The path to hell, doth seeme a paradice, “Vices be noted, vertues oft forgot, “Thy fame once foild, incurable the blot. “Thy name defac'd, if toucht with any staine, “And once supplanted, never growes againe. “The Lechors tongue is never voyd of guile, “Nor Crocodile wants teares to win his pray, “The subtil'st Temptor hath the sweetest stile, “With rarest musick Syrens soon'st betray. “Affection, will like fire himselfe bewray. “Time offers still each hower to do amisse, “And greatest dangers, promise greatest blisse. “Deceit, still with a thousand sleights is fraught, “Art, hath a world of secrets in her power, “Who hopes a Conquest, leaves no meanes unsought, “Soft golden drops once peirc'd the brazen tower, “Care and Suspition is faire Beauties dower. “Guile, (like a Traytor) ever goes disguis'd, “Lust, oft is fild, but never is suffic'd. This wanton Prince, whose soule doth swim in vice, Whose lawlesse youth time never hath restrained, He leaves no meanes unprov'd, which may entice, The rytes of wedlock wantonly profained; His hands with blood of innocents distained. This Lyon, would thy chastity devoure, Which kept by Vertue, lyes not in his power. “Lacivious will, the sences doth abuse, “Birth is no shaddow unto tyranny, “No scepter serves dishonor to excuse, “Nor kinglie vaile can cover villanie, “Fame is not subject to authoritie. “No plaister heales a deadly poysoned sore, “No secret hid, where slaunder keeps the dore. “No subtile plea revokes dishonors error, “No law can quite, where Fame is once endited, “No armour proofe against the conscience terror, “Gainst open shame, no Text can well be cyted, “The blow once given, cannot be evited. “If once the fire be to the powder got, “Tis then too late to seeke to flie the shot. “His youthfull love, is like a sudden fire, “Whose heate extreame, of force decay it must, “The cause, proceeding from his lewd desire, “Is quickly out, and sooner turn'd to dust, “Yet frets the life, as iron frets with rust. “Sinne in a chaine, leads on her sister Shame, “And both in Gives, fast fettered to Defame. “The stately Eagle on his pitch doth stand, “And from the maine the fearfull foule doth smite, “Yet scornes to touch it lying on the land, “When he hath felt the sweet of his delight, “But leaves the same a pray to every Kite. “With much we surfet, plenty makes us poore, “The wretched Indian spurns the golden Ore. “Kinges use their Loves, as garments they have worne, “Weake stomackes loath, if once but fully fed, “The Saint once stolne, who doth the shrine adorne? “Or what is Nectar if it once be shed? “What Princes wealth can prize thy Maiden-head? “Which should be held as precious as thy breath, “Which once dissolv'd of force ensueth death. Loe, heere he makes a period with his teares, Which from his eyes now make a sudden breache, By which the weight of all his speech appeares, In words so grave as seemed still to preach, This Idioma with such power doth teach. Whose tuned cadence doth such rules impart, As deepely fixt each sentence in my hart. O sacred counsell, true hart-suppling balme, Soule-curing plaister, time preserving blisse, Water of life in every suddaine qualme, The heavens rich store-house, where all treasure is, True guide, by whom foule Errors den we misse. Night-burning Beacon, watch against mishaps, Fore-sight, avoyding many after claps. The King deluded in his love the while, His soule tormented in this quenchlesse fire, With flattering hope his sences doth beguile, Quickning the coales unto his fond desire; Affection growne too head-strong to retire, Controules his silence, hating to be mute, And still doth urge him to commence his sute. Thus carried on by his unbridled thought, He leaves no baite unprov'd that might allure, “Deceit, a schoole of common sleights hath taught, “Desire, hath philters which desires procure, “Lust, puts the most unlawfull things in ure: “Nor yet in limmets ever could be bounded, “Till he himselfe, himselfe hath quite confounded. But still perceiving all devices faile, His traines in Court yet never tooke effect, Now with his tongue determin'd to assaile, And to this end doth all his thoughts direct, Too much abused by his vaine suspect: To further daies, no longer would be posted, But finding time, me bravely thus accosted. Goddesse (quoth he) when Nature thee engrayned, With colours fetcht from heavens eternall spring, Little thought shee, herselfe shee could have stayned, Or grace the world with so divine a thing. But as a gifte to gratifie a King, Seal'd thee this Charter, dated at thy birth, To be the fair'st that ever liv'd on earth. Locke not thy treasure, heaven doth give the store, A thousand Graces at thine eyes are fed, Thy bosome, is the Angels secret dore, Thy breast, the pillowes of faire Venus bed: Regardes of honour on thy browes are red. Thy cheeks, the banquet where sweet Love doth feast, The royall Pawne of Beauties interest. Thy lyps, the Bath where sorrows wounds are healed, Where Abstinence keepes Vertue in a diet, And in thy wit, all wonders are revealed, Wisedom growne welthy, liveth there at quiet: Thy modest eye controules Loves wanton ryot. Thine eye, that planet clearer then the seaven, Whose radient splendour lights the world to heaven. From thy sweet lookes such streames of lightning glide, As through the eyes do wound the very hart, Killing, and curing, as they are applide, Hurting, and healing, like Achilles Dart: Which to the world do heavenly things impart. And thou alone, the spirit of all delight, Which like the sun, joy'st all things with thy sight. Could heaven allowe wher-with to lim thee forth, Or earth afford things of esteeme to praise thee, Were words sufficient to expresse thy worth, Or could invention to thy glory raise thee, Could Art devise a weight whereby to paize thee: But thy surpassing excellence is such, As eyes may gaze, but nothing els may tuch. Hee is thy King, who is becom thy subject, Thy soveraigne Lord, who onely seekes thy love, Thy beauty is his eyes commaunding object, Who for thy sake, a thousand deathes would prove: Sweet Maid let prayers, some compassion move. Let Wolves, and Beares, be cruell in their kinds, But women meeke, and have relenting minds. Love forc'd the Gods, to things for Gods unmeet, Behold a Monarch kneeling to a maide, Apollo, prostrate at his Daphnes feete, Great Atlas bowes, on whom the heaven is staide; Thy Jove his Scepter on thy lap hath laide, Thou in his throne doest sit as Chancellor, And hee become thy daylie Orator. Looke on these browes, the perfect Map of care, The truest mirrour of my miserie, In wrinckled lines where sorrowes written are, Where Time still reades on Loves Anotomy, My bloodlesse vaines with greefes Phlebotomy: A stanchlesse hart, dead-wounded, ever bleeding, On whom that nere-fild vulture Love sits feeding. Pitty this soule-evaporating smoke, The purest incense of most perfect zeale, These deep-fetcht sighes, confounding words halfe spoke, Where swoln-ey'd passion doth herselfe reveale: That ragefull fier, no reason can conceale. Where torments last, and joyes are still diluded, Where all infernall torture is included. Behold, the brim-full Cesterns of these eyes, With surging Tydes of brackist teares frequented, Where foodlesse Hope, still hunger-starven lies, In burning Pooles eternally tormented: Which to betray, my hart at first consented. Where as the spirit of woe, hath ever being, Blinded in teares, yet in teares only seeing. Shyne thou, like Cynthia under mine estate, Thy tresses deckt with Ariadnes Crowne, In pompe redubbling costly Junos rate, And cloud the world in sable with a frowne: Advaunce thy friends, and throw the mighty downe. Be thou admir'd through all this famous Ile, Thy name enrol'd with never-dated stile. Great troupes of Ladies shall attend my Gerle, Thou on thy brave tryumphing Chariot borne, Thy drink shall be dissolved orient Pearle, Thy princely Cup of rarest Unicorne: Then live at ease, and laugh the world to scorne. And if our musick cannot like thine eares, Thy Jove shall fetch thee musick from the Spheres. Thy name, as my Empreza will I beare, My well tun'd rymes, shall glory in thy praise, Upon my Crowne, thy favours will I weare, Figuring thy love a thousand sundry wayes: My power shall be thy shield at all assaies. And thou my Saint, Kings offering to thy shrine, Wondring thy beautie, as a thing divine. What if my Queene, Detractor of our blisse, Thee by her hundreth-eyed Heardsman keepe, Ile bring to passe, shee shall her purpose misse, My Mercurie shall lull him till he sleepe; “Love ever laughs, when Jelousie dooth weepe. “My providence, shall keepe her stomacke under, “She may raise stormes, but Jove doth rule the thunder. Thus having broke the Ice from whence might spring, Sweet streames of love in calme and fairer time, And afterward, might joyfull tydings bring, The staire begun by which he thought to clyme, Hoping due howres, now he had set the chyme; Leaves me, not knowing now which way to turne me, Warm'd with the fire, which unawars might burne me. Forth-with began strange factions in my thought, And in my soule a sudden mutinie, Feare and Desire, a doubtfull combat fought, The tytle stands upon extremity: My force was great, and strong mine enemie; Till Resolution, seeing all begun, Sent Succors in, by whom the field was won. As thus mine honour in the Ballance hung, Betwixt the worlds preferment and my fame, These in myne eares, like Syrens sweetly sung, That wisely still fore-warned me of shame: Till Grace divine from highest heaven came. Now must I loose the prize, or win the Crowne, Till Vertue (currant) lastly way'd mee downe. The time is come I must receive my tryall, His protestations subtilly accuse mee, My Chastitie sticks still to her deniall, His promises false witnes do abuse me, My Conscience cald, yet cleerly doth excuse me. And those pure thoughts, enshrined in my brest, By verdict quit mee, being on the Quest. And Wisedom now fore-warned mee of treason, That in the Court, I liv'd a Lyons pray, My tender youth in this contagious season, Still fear'd infection, following day by day: My Barck unsafe on this tempestious Sea. My Chastity in danger every hower, No succour neer to shroud me from the shower. With Resolution, hap what might be-tide, I leave the Court, the Spring of all my woe, That Court, which gloried in my Beauties pride, That Beauty, which my Fortune made my foe, To Baynards-Castell secretly I goe. Where, with his trayne, my noble Father lay, Whose gracious counsell was my onely stay. There, might my thoughts keepe holy-day a while, And sing a farewell to my sorrowes past, With all delights I might the time beguile, Attayn'd my wished liberty at last, No fearfull vision made mee now agast. But like a Birde escapt her Keepers charge, Glydes through the ayre with wings display'd at large. And hoping health thus cured of these qualmes, My hart in this fayre harbour rides at ease, The tempest past, expecting quiet calmes, My Shyp thus floting on these blisfull Seas, A sudden storme my Ankor-hold doth raise: And from the shore doth hoyse me to the maine, Where I (poore soule) my shipwrack must sustaine. And loe, the Autumne of my joyes approch, Whilst yet my spring began so faire to flourish, Black way-ward Winter, sets her stormes abroch, And kils the sap which all my hopes did nourish. Fortune once kind, growes crabbed now and currish. In my straight path, she layes a mighty beame. And in my course, she thwarts me with the streame. The King who saw his love unkindly crost, And by effect the cause had fully found, Since he the harvest of his hope had lost, Now on revenge his deepest thoughts doth ground: Desperate to kill, receiving his deaths wound. In reasons bounds strives but in vaine to hold, Head-strong desire, too proud to be controld. Like the brave Courser strugling with the raines, His foming mouth controld with Canons check, With lofty bounds his skilfull Ryder straines, Scorning to yeeld his stately crested neck: Nor of the bloody pearcing spurres doth reck. The King now warmed in this glorious fire, Thus roughly plungeth in his vaine desire. Hence-forth devising to disperse the Cloude, Which ever hung betwixt him and the light: His love not currant, nor to be allow'd, Whilst thus my Father held mee in his sight, Some-thing amisse, his Watch went never right. Of force hee must this Sentinell remove, If hee in time would hope to win my love. Ten thousand mischiefes now hee sets abroch, Treasons, invasions, civill mutinie, Black ignominie, slaunderous reproch, Rebellion, out-rage, vile conspiracie, Opening the intralls of all villanie. Causing my Lord, thereof to be accused, By Traytors, such as hee with gyfts abused. Foule Envie thou, the partiall Judge of right, Sonne of Deceit, borne of that harlot Hate, Nursed in Hell, a vile and uglie spright, Feeding on Slaunder, cherrish'd with Debate: Never contented with thine owne estate. Deeming alike the wicked and the good, Whose words be gall, whose actions end in blood. His service done to this ungratefull King, His worth, his valure, his gentilitie: What good so-ever might from vertue spring, Or could proceede from true Nobilitie, All buried now in darke obscuritie. His vertuous life, in doubtfull question brought, Which ever-more for fame and honour sought. Thou hatefull Monster, base Ingratitude, Soules mortall poyson, deadly-killing wound, Deceitfull Serpent, seeking to dilude, Black lothsome ditch, where all desert is drownd, Vile Pestilence, which all things doost confound; “At first created to none other end, “But to greeve those whom nothing could offend. Such as too well perceiv'd the Kings intent, In whom remayn'd yet any sparke of grace, Pittying a poore distressed innocent, Their safety still depending on my case, These in my wrongs participate a place. These, bound in friendship, and alied in blood, Fast to my Father in the quarrell stood. But as a Lyon in the wildes of Thrace, With darts and arrowes gauled at the bay, Kills man and beast incountring in the Chase, And downe on heapes, the fearfull Heards doth lay, His armed pawes each where doth make his way: Thus by his power, the King doth now surprise, Such as in armes resist his tyrannies. And given over to his vile desire, The spectakle of lothsome sinne and shame, Our strong-built Castels now hee sets on fire, And (like proude Nero) warmes him by the flame, Wasting themselves, augmenting his defame. Which like bright Beacons, blaze in every eye, Warning all other of his tyrannie. Our friends and followers thus are beaten downe, Whom every slave and pesant dare revile, And all reputed Traytors to the Crowne, Imprisoned some, some forc'd into exile; Yet worst of all, (remedilesse the while,) My Father sent a banish'd man to Fraunce, And heere perforce must leave mee to my chaunce. On shyp-bord now, with hands rear'd to the skyes, (All sigh'd and wept, could sigh nor weepe no more,) Hee turnes his sad eclipsed tearefull eyes, As retrograde unto the blessed shore; Rich Ile (quoth hee,) once Garner of my store, Taken from mee by yonder Tyrants theft, And I as poore as ere was Irus left. Tis not my wealth, that, I esteeme as light, Nor yet my Country, though so deere to mee, But thou alone Matilda, my delight, My lyfe, my soule, all my felicity, Left as a pray, vile Monster unto thee. Yet my laments are wasted all in vaine, And to these windes and billowes must complaine. But now the Wolfe is got into my fold, God help the Lambe that's in the Lyons power; Alas poore Maid, thus art thou bought and sold, Prepared for the slaughter every howre, This Minataure must all my hopes devoure. Yet forc'd by Fortune to endure this woe, And unreveng'd unto my grave shall goe. Within the furrowes of my aged browes, My joyes must their untimely buriall have, This fatall Tombe proude Fortune them alowes, Which thus with-holds mee from my wished grave. The heavens are deafe although I justly crave. My teares with greefe are frozen in mine eyes, Yet God, nor man, regards my miseries. Thrice famous Romaine, (fortunate to mee,) By whose owne hands thy deerest child was slaine, Deliver'd so from slavish tyrannie, But lyving, mine dishonor'd shall remaine, Blotting my Name with an immortall staine; Whose black reproch, for ever shall endure. “Ah vile disease that never tyme can cure. Even as the kinde sleep-breaking Nightingale, (The cruell Merlin ceaz'd her little one,) Unto the Thickets tells a wofull tale, Wearying the woods with her continuall mone, Thys poore Byrd chirpeth, hee poore Lord doth grone. Shee weepes all night, by day complaineth hee, Shee for her young one, hee laments for mee. Looke how the Sea, the Tyde once beeing past, Whose surges strove the continent to climbe, And bounding backe unto the Gulfe at last, Upon the Sands doth leave a clammie slime, Teares in his cheekes, such gutters worne in time. Wash'd with the floods of his stil-troubled braine, His eyes brim-full, as furrowes after raine. And thus my Father unawares betray'd, A thousand sorrowes mee at once assaile; What might I doe, a silly helplesse mayde, Tost and turmoyl'd in this tempestious gale? These boysterous flawes have broken down my saile. My succors thus (like shadowes) now are gone, Not one remaines to whom to make my mone. Now, like a Roe, before the hounds imbost, When over-toyl'd his swiftnes doth aslake, Forsakes the Plaines, to which hee trusted most, And to the covert doth himselfe betake, Where dubbling still, creepes on from brake to brake; Thus doe I flie before the Princes face, Who day and night pursues mee still in chase. The Coast is cleere, suspitious eyes at rest, And all things fadge which further his desire: Now royall hope keepes revels in his brest, The coales are quick, and Fancie blowes the fire: His love expects his long deserved hire. No clowde discern'd to hinder this his sunne, The watch discharg'd, he hopes the towne is wonne. “The Princes armes are strecht from shore to shore, “Kings sleeping, see with eyes of other men, “Craft findes a key to open every dore, What might I doe, or what availes mee then? The silly Lambe lives in the Lyons den. Loves wakefull eyes (too soone alas) discry'd mee, And found mee, where I surest thought to hide mee. My Jove, like Jove now seekes mee to invade, And roysting comes, in thunder-bolts and rayne, A Beast, a Byrd, a Satyre in the shade, A flood, a fire, a Serpent and a Swaine, Camelion-like, as fitt'st my love to gaine. Now like great Phœbus in his golden Carre, And then like Mars, the fearefull God of warre. Hee makes the Ayre to wooe me whilst I talk, The Wind to whistle many a pleasant Dittie, The dainty Grasse make musick as I walk, The prettie Flowers to move me still to pitty: All sencelesse things with reason seeming wittie. Before mine eyes hee ever dooth appeare, And if I call, still aunswers, I am heere. My steppes are told, my pathes by Spyes are noted, Mine eyes by Night-spells shut within the watch, My words are way'd by jelous Love that doted, And at my thoughts, Ill-meaning still doth catch: Into my counselles Treason drawes the latch. And at my gates, Suspition still doth ward, Sorrow my hand-maid, Falsehood on my gard. He weepes his words, but words could win no teares, “The raine doth cease or ere the Floods do rise, His wofull words his tongue awhile forbeares. Then doth he, his harts arrant with his eyes: His eyes ecclipz'd, he then with sighes supplies. Sighes faile, with smiles he then bewrayes his paine, Smiling, he weepes, yet weeping, laughes againe. Looke how the Peacock ruffes his flaunting tayle, And struts under his mooned Canapie, And how hee quivers with his plumed sayle; Yet when his Lead-pale legs hee haps to see, With shame abates his painted jolitie. The King, as proude as Peacock in my love, Yet droupes again, when words nor teares could move. My breast, of Flint, a rock impenitrable, My hart, that stone which never toole could perce, My thoughts, a center, and unsearchable, My words, judgement, which Law could not reverse, My frownes, such clowdes, as no joy could disperse, “Tygars are tam'd with patience and with skill, “All things made subject, but a womans will. The King like one sick of a strange disease, Whose cruell paine no phisick can asswage, Nor plaster can his torments once appease, Boyling his intrales, with such hellish rage, With his owne knife his horror doth engage. Thus desperate, he, fore-thinks to end this strife, Or else by poyson take away my life. But first, with lines hee bravely sitteth on, Words steep'd in syrop of Ambrosia, Sweet method, savored with invention, “What can be said that Lovers cannot say? “Desire can make a Doctor in a day. Each sentence seem'd a sweet inchaunting charme, A Trumpet sounding gentle Loves alarme. With rare hart-curing Phrigian harmonie, He tunes his strings, as not a trebble jarres, His straines so pleasant and melodious bee, As might appease the heat of fearefull warres: Distilling balme to cure the deepest scarres His pen, dilates his hartes Apologie, And shewes my sinnes, by loves Theologie. What curious thing did Nature ere bring forth, What glistering starre that yeelds his silver shine, To which hee doth not now compare my worth? Or what is there, that's mortall or divine? What sublimation doth not refine? Or what rare thing was ever yet devised, That unto mee, hee hath not lightly prized? Now mounts hee up with loftie straines of love, Then to sad vaines his pliant Muse doth bow, His humors serving, as his passions move: And as the Tydes, the numbers ebbe and flow; His hopes now wither, then againe they grow. Painting his greefe, in hope to quench desire, “But inck to love, like oyle unto the fire. And now of one hee had himselfe advis'd, Both red and practiz'd in thys wretched Arte, Within whose braine all mischiefes were compris'd, Whose words were venom, and his tongue a Darte: And this is hee must acte this damned part. To him the King, my poysoning doth commit, Who had before made tryall of his wit. Another Dagon, was this miscreant, A divell, walking in a humaine shape, Foule Dagon, borne true vertue to supplant, For whom th'infernall pit of Hell doth gape: Image of pride, of villany and rape, Be thou abhord of all posteritie, And let thy vile dishonor never dye. By him to Dunmow, hee these lines convayde, A Monestarie Juga had begunne, Juga, sometime a holie Vestall mayde, At whose great charge this Monument was donne, Where I had vow'd to live a holie Nunne. And in my Cloyster, kept amongst the rest, Which in this place virginitie profest. Now he which had this bloody acte in charge, Thether repaires, with letters from the King, Whose black Commission was but all too large, To execute so base and vile a thing: This messenger which now my death doth bring, To adde fit matter to my tragike storie, Finds meanes to boord mee in my oratorie. With courtly congies gently greeting mee, Gives mee the packet which the King had sent mee, Receive fayre Maide, these Letters heere (quoth hee,) The faithfull earnest of that good is meant thee: But craving that which never shall repent thee. His lines be love, the Letters writ in blood, Then make no doubt the warrant passing good. Kindly accept a Princes kingly offer, Tis more than follie if thou doe refuse it: Never hath Fortune made a fairer profer, The gyft too great, if fondly thou abuse it, Nor any reason serveth to excuse it. Be not a foe unto thine owne good hap, Refusing treasure throwne into thy lap. “If thou be wise, hold this as ominus, “The heavens not like disposed every hower: “The starres be still predominant in us, “Fortune not alwaies forth her bags doth poure, “Nor every clowde doth raine a golden shower. “Occasion's wing'd, and ever flyeth fast, “Comming, shee smyles, &amp; frownes once being past. Wrong not thy selfe, nor yet the worlde deprive, Of that rare good which Nature freely lent, Think'st thou by such base nygardize to thrive, In sparing that which never will be spent? And that is worst, in age shall thee repent. Playing the Churle, to hoord up Beauties pelfe, And live, and dye, and all unto thy selfe. Yet, were this all (quoth hee,) as would it were, But there is more, which needes I must reveale: Behold the poyson he hath sent thee here, Which on my life I dare not to conceale, Thus is the King determined to deale. I, onely waite upon thy resolution, To win thy love, or see thy execution. Leave off these humors, be not singuler, Make not an Idoll of thine owne perfection, Prize not this word (Virginitie) so deere, Seeme not so Saint-like, moov'd with no affection. “Beautie brings perrill, wanting safe protection. Forsweare this drousie melancholie Cell, Was never Gerle could grace a Court so well. This feare first sprong from foolish superstition, Which fond conceit into our eares hath blowne, Which wee receive from old folkes by tradition, And as a weede to choke our joyes is growne: Reason rootes out what Error erst hath sowne. A gentle jest to fright poore babes withall, Like to a Bug-beare, painted on a wall. Tush, these be triviall toyes of reputation, Whose Ceremonies have the world infected, Held in regard but onely for a fashion, Which frivolous, the wiser have neglected: And but as Dreames of doting age respected. Whose spleen-sick humors on their galls were fed, Thinking all true which they imagined. Dispatch, (quoth hee) loe, heere is pen and inck, Heere make the Prince assurance of thy love, Or els prepare thee to thy fatall drinke, Which is of force thy Fever to remove: Which (ah pore fondling) thou too soone maist prove. And if thy will be so fast chayn'd to thee, Let thine own hands the Executioners bee. And is (quoth I) the Princes pleasure thus? You are deceiv'd, hee doth but this to try mee, I know my Lord is kinde and gracious, Hee thinks my sexe &amp; weaknes will discry mee; I hope the King will deale more kindly by mee. Those blessed hands, which never did but good, Will not be stain'd with virgins guiltlesse blood. His thoughts be pure, as Christall, without spot, Hee is wisdom, honour, valure, chastitie: What excellence is there that hee is not? Or what may be, by him which cannot be? Hee's Vertues right superlative degree. From his affections, never shall proceede, One little thought of this so vile a deede. “Kings be the Gods Vizegerents heere on earth, “The Gods have power, Kings from that power have might, “Kings should excell in vertue as in birth, “Gods punish wrongs, &amp; Kings shold maintaine right, “They be the Sunnes from which we borrow light. “And they as Kings, should still in justice strive, “With Gods, from whom their beings they derive. Inrag'd with this, (in greefes extremitie,) Minion, (quoth hee,) tis now no time to prate, Dispatch, or els Ile drench you presently, Of this, nor that, I stand not to debate. Expects thou love where thou reward'st with hate? I passe not I, how ere thou like the motion, Have done at once, and quickly take the Potion. This sudden terror makes mee pause for breath, Till sighing out at length this sad reply: If it be so, welcom to mee my death, This is the utmost of extremitie, And yet when all is done, I can but die. His will be done, sith hee will have it so, And welcome Death, the end of all my woe. And thou my Deaths-man, slave unto his lust, Th'executioner of his lawlesse will, In whom the Tyrant doth repose such trust, Detract no time, his murthering minde fulfill; Doe what thou dar'st, the worst thou canst but kill. And tell the Tyrant this when I am dead, I loath'd his beastly and adulterous bed. Nor let the King thy Maister ever thinke, A vertuous Maid so cowardly and base, As to be frighted with a poysoned drinke, And live an abject in the worlds disgrace: All eyes with shame to gaze mee in the face. That ages which heer-after shall succeede, Shall hold mee hatefull for so vile a deede. Is this the greatest gyft he could bestowe? Is this the Jewell, wher-with hee doth present mee? I am his friend, what gives hee to his foe, If this in token of his love be sent mee? Remedilesse I am, it must content mee. Yet afterward, a proverbe this shall prove, The gift King John bestow'd upon his Love. Then of this conquest let thy Soveraigne boast, And make report with shame what hee hath done: A thing more easie then subdue an Hoast, Or conquer Kingdoms, as his Father wonne; O haplesse Sire, of this unhappy Sonne. And hee more shame shall carrie to his grave, Then Fortune honors to his Father gave. Thus spoke my minde, (as women use to doe,) Hoping thereby som-what to ease my hart, But words I found, did but increase my woe, Augment his rage, not mittigate my smart; And now comes in the reckoning ere wee part. And now my valure must be try'd, or never, Or famous now, or infamous for ever. Taking the poyson from his deadly hand, Unto the King caroust my latest draught; Goe wretch (quoth I) now let him understand, Hee hath obtayn'd what hee so long hath sought; Though with my blood, my fame I deerlie bought. And though my youth hee basely have betrayd, Yet witnes Heaven, I liv'd and dyed a Mayd. Then why repine I, sith hee thinks it meete, Hee is my Soveraigne, and my life is his, Death is not bitter, spyc'd with such a sweet, Which leades the way to everlasting blis; Hee's all my joy, hee all my glory is. Hee is the tuch by whom my gold is tryed, Onely by him my death is sanctified. For could my life have given life to mee, My youthes fayre flower, yet blooming, had not dyed, Then how should this but meritorious bee, When by my death, my life is sanctified? Could ever thing more fitly bee applied? In this is love, in this his care I finde, My Lord is just, my Lord is onelie kinde. Then let these teares, th'Elixars of my love, Bee to his soule a pure preservative, And let my prayers, be of such force to move, That by my death, my Soveraigne may survive: And from his raigne, let Fame herselfe derive His glorie, like the Sunnes translucent rayes, And as the heaven, eternall be his dayes. This mortall poyson, now beginnes to rage, And spreads his vigor thorough all my vaines, There is no phisick can my greefe aswage, Such is the torment which my hart destraines, Boyling my intrales in most hellish paines. And Nature, weakned of her wonted force, Must yeeld to death, which now hath no remorce. And those pure thoughts, which once I choisly fed, Now when pale death my sences doth surprize, I offer heere upon my dying bed, This precious, sweet, perfumed sacrifice: Hallowed in my almighty Makers eyes. Which from this Alter, lends me heavenly light, Guiding my soule amid this darkesome night. My glorious life, my spotlesse Chastity, Now at this hower bee all the joyes I have, These be the wings by which my fame shall flye, In memorie, these shall my Name engrave; These, from oblivion shall mine honour save. With Laurell, these my browes shall coronize, And make mee live to all posterities. “Our fond preferments, are but childrens toyes, “And as a shaddow, all our pleasures passe, “As yeeres increase, so wayning are our joyes, “And beautie crazed, like a broken glasse: “A prettie tale of that which never was. “All things decay, yet Vertue shall not dye, “This onely gives us immortalitie. My soule, thus from her pryson set at large, And gentlie freed from this poluted roome, This prize unloden from this lothsome Barge, (Such is the Heavens inevitable doome:) My body layd at Dunmow in my Toombe. Thus Baynards-Castle boastes my blessed birth, And Dunmow kindly wraps mee in her earth. Now scarcely was my breathlesse body cold, But every where my tragedy was spred: And Fame, abroad in every Coast had told, My resolution, beeing lately dead: The glorious wonder of all woman-head. And to my Father flyes with this report, Who liv'd an Exile in the French-Kings Court. His griefe, too great to be bewail'd with teares, Words, insufficient to expresse his woe, His soule, assaulted with a thousand feares, As many, sundry passions come and goe; His thoughts, uncertaine, wandring to and froe. At length, this fearfull extasie ore-past, Grones from his soule this passion at the last. O Heavens (quoth hee) why was I borne accurst? This onely comfort to mine age was left: But to despite mee, you have done your worst, And mee of all my worldly joyes bereft: I quite undone by your deceitfull theft. This was the Jewell I esteemed most, And loosing this, now all my treasurs lost. Yee powers Divine, if you be cleane and chast, In whom alone consists eternitie, Why suffer you, your owne to be disgra'st, Subject to death and black impuritie? If in your shield be no securitie? If so for Vertue these rewards be due? Who shall adore, or who shall honour you? What ment you, first to give her vitall breath, Or make the world proude by her blessed birth, Predestinating this untimely death, And of her presence to deprive the earth? O fruitlesse age, now starv'd with Vertues dearth. Or if you long'd to have her company, O why by poyson would you let her die? O Soile, with drops of mercy once bedew'd, When just men were instauled in thy throne, But now with blood of Innocents imbrew'd, Stayning the glory of fayre Albion, O lustfull Monster, ô accursed John. O heavens, to whom should men for justice cry, When Kings themselves thus raigne by tyrannie? O gyve mee wings Revenge, I will ascend And fetch her soule againe out of their power; From them proceeded this untimely end, Who tooke her hence before her dying hower, And rays'd that clowd which rayn'd this bloody shower. And from the grave Ile dig her body up, Which had her bane by that vile poysoned cup. O pardon Heavens these sacriligious words, This irreligious open blasphemie: My wretched soule no better now affords, Such is the passion of mine agonie, My desperate case in this extremitie. You harbour those which ever like you best, With blessed Angels let her spirit rest. No, no, Ile practise by some secret art, How to infect his pure life-breathing ayre, Or else Ile sheath my poyniard in his hart, Or with strong poyson Ile annoynt his Chayre: Or by inchauntment, will his dayes impayre. O no, revenge to God alone belongs, And it is hee which must revenge my wrongs. O heavens, perforce we must attend your time, Our succours must awaite upon you still, In your just waights you ballance everie crime, For us you know what's good, and what is ill; Who understands your deepe and secret skill? In you alone our destinies consist, Then who is hee which can your power resist? O, could my sighes againe but give thee breath, Or were my teares such balme as could restore thee, Or could my life redeeme thee from this death, Or were my prayers, but invocations worthy: Sighes, teares, life, prayers, were all to little for thee. But since the heaven, thus of my child disposeth, Ah me, thy Tombe now all my joyes incloseth. O what a wonder shall thy valure bring? What admiration to posteritie? What rare examples from thy vertues spring? O what a glorie to thy Progenie, To bee engrav'd in lasting memorie, When as applauding Fame in every Coast, Shall thus in honor of Fitzwaters boast? England, when peace upon thy shores shall flourish, And that pure Maiden sit upon thy Throne, Which in her bosome shall the Muses nourish, Whose glorious fame shal through the world be blown, (O, blessed Ile, thrice happy Albion;) Then let thy Poets in their stately rymes, Sing forth her praises to succeeding tymes. By this, the Kings vile bloody rage is past, And gentle time his choller doth digest, “The fire consumes his substance at the last, The greefe asswag'd which did his spirit molest: That fiend cast out wherewith he was possest. And now he feeles this horror in his soule, When loathsome shame his actions doth controule. “Black hell-bred-humor of revenging sin, “By whose inticements, murder we commit, “The end unthought of, rashlie we begin, “Letting our passion over-rule our wit: “Missing the marke, which most we ayme to hit. “Clogging our soules with such a masse of care, “As casts us downe oft times into Dispayre. Traytor to Vertue, Reprobate (quoth hee,) As for a King, no more usurpe the name: Staine to all honor, and gentilitie, Mark'd in the face with th'yron of Defame: The Picture of all infamie and shame. Dispis'd of men, abhor'd in every place, Hate to thy selfe, the very worlds disgrace. When all thy race shal bee in tryumph set, Their royall conquests and atchivements done, Henrie thy Father, brave Plantagenet, Thy conquering Brother, Lion-hart, his Sonne: The Crownes, &amp; spoyles, these famous Champions won; This still shall bee in thy dishonor said, Loe, this was John, the murderer of a Maide. This act enrold in Booke of black Defame, Where, men of death and tragick murders reed, Recorded in the Register of shame, In lines whose letters freshlie ever bleed, Where all the world shall wonder my misdeed. And quote the place, (thus ever) passing by, Note heere King Johns vile damned tyranny. Her blood exhal'd from earth unto the skye, A fearefull Meteor still hangs ore my head, Stayning the heavens with her Vermilion dye, Changing the Sunnes bright raies to gorie red, Prognosticating death and fearefull dread; Her soule, with houling, and revengefull steven, Shreeking before the gates of highest Heaven. Whose sacred Counsell, now in judgement set, And Shee, before them stands to plead her case, Her drearie words in bloody teares are wet, The evidence appeares before my face, And I condemn'd a catife wanting grace; Justice cryes out upon this sinfull deede, And to my death the fatall starres proceed. Earth, swallow me, and hide me in thy wombe, O let my shame in thy deepe Center dwell, Wrap up this murder in thy wretched Tombe, Let tender Mercy stop the gates of hell: And with sweet drops this furious heate expell. O let Repentance, just revenge appease, And let my soule, in torment finde some ease. O, no, her teares are now become a flood, And as they rise, increasing mine offence; And now the shedding of her guiltlesse blood, Even like a Cankar, gnawes my Conscience, O, ther's my greefe, my paine proceedes from thence. Yet never time weares out this filthy staine, And I dishonor'd ever shall remaine. Then doe I vow a solemne Pilgrimage, Before my wretched miserable end; This done, betake mee to some Hermitage, Where I the remnant of my dayes will spend: Where Almes and Prayer I ever will attend. And on the Tombe at last, where thou doost lye, When all is done, Ile lay me downe and dye. And for his Penance, lastly hee devis'd, Monthly to Dunmow would he take his way, And in a simple Palmers weede disguis'd, With deepe devotion kneele him downe to pray: Kissing the place, whereas my body lay. Washing my Tombe, with his repentant teares, And being wet, yet dryed it with his hayres. And now, before my spirit depart from hence, O let me see the Muses owne delight: Idea, mirrour of all patience, Whose sacred Temples are with Garlands dight; O let my soule bee blessed in her sight. Which so adorns this poore world with her birth, As where she is, still makes a Heaven on earth. O let mee once behold her blessed eyes, Those two sweet Sunnes which make eternall spring, Which banish drouping Night out of the skies, In whose sweet bosome quiers of Angels sing: To whom the Muses all their treasures bring. Her brest, Minervas ever hallowed shrine, Whose sainted thoughts are sacred and divine. Slyde still sweet Ankor on thy silver Sands, Play dainty Musick when she walkes by thee, With liquid Pearle wash those pure Lillie hands, And all thy Bancks with Laurell shaddowed be, And let sweet Ardens Nightingales with glee, Record to her in many a pleasing straine, Whilst all the Nimphes attend uppon her traine.

After the conquest of England, by William Duke of Normandy, his eldest son Robert, surnamed Short-thigh, much more then eyther of his bretheren, William Rufus, or Henry Beuclarke, beloved of the Commons, yet brought in disgrace with his Father, by meanes of Lanfranck Byshop of Canterburie, who greatlie affected the said William Rufus, as a man rightlie of his owne disposition. Robert beeing a man of a mightie spirit, finding himselfe disgrac'd, &amp; grown hatefull to his Father, and the Crowne of England assured to his Brother: whilst his Father maketh warrs in Fraunce, hee with a troupe of resolute Germains, invadeth Normandie. In the height of all these troubles, William Conqueror dyeth, leaving the kingdome of England to Rufus. Whilst Robert prepareth to make warre upon his brother, by the pollicies of Lanfrancke and his accomplices, they are friends, Robert peaceably enjoyeth Normandie, and if he over-lived his brother William, to succeed him in the kingdom of England. Nowe, the brute of the holy warrs called Robert to Palestine, with Peter the Hermit, and Godfrey of Bulloyne, for which, to pay his souldiours, hee engageth Normandie to his youngest brother Henry for summes of money. In his absence William dyeth, Henrie usurpeth the Crowne, and Duke Robert returning from the warrs with great honor, yet in his warrs at home most unfortunate, hee is taken by Henry in a battell in Normandy, brought a captive into England, and imprisoned in Cardiffe Castell in Wales, where Henry as a Tyrant, still fearing his escape, put out his eyes. 1 What time Sleeps Nurse the silent night begun To steale by minuts on the long-liv'd daies, The furious Dog-star chasing of the Sun, Whose scorching breath ads flame unto his raies, At whose approch the angry Lyon braies, The earth now warm'd in thys celestiall fire, To coole her heate, puts off her rich attire. 2 The deawy-tressed Morning newly wake, With golden tinsell scarce had crown'd her browes, Ryding in tryumph on the Ocean lake, Embellishing the honny-fringed bowes, Deepe mellancholly from my braine to rouze, To Isis banck my Genius guides the way, Amongst whose Reeds soft murmuring winds do play. 3 Zephyre, which courts faire Thames, his gentle love, On whose smooth brest the swelling billows flow, Which on a long the wanton tyde doth shove, And to keepe back he easilie doth blow, Still meets her comming, followes if shee goe; Shee, forcing waves to coole his hote embrace, Hee, fanning breath upon her christall face. 4 Still dallying in her often-turning source, She streaks a long the shores with her proud straine, And here, and there, she wantons in her course, And in her gate oft turneth back againe, Smiling to looke upon her silver traine, With pretty Anticks shee the faire soile greets, Till Medoas streame from famous Kent shee meets. 5 Thus careles wandring with this gliding streame, Whose fleeting told me of tymes flying howers, Delighted thus as in a pleasing dreame, Cropping small branches of the sweetest flowers: And looking back on Londons stately towers, So Troy (thought I) her stately head did beare, Whose crazed ribs the furrowing plough doth eyre. 6 Weary, at length a Willow tree I found, Which on the brim of this great current stood, Whose roote was matted with the arrasd ground, Deaw'd with the small drops of this surging flood, Ordain'd it seem'd to sport her Nymphish brood Whose curled top, envy'd the heavens great eye Should view the stock shee was maintained by. 7 The towring Larke which carrols to the Sun, With trebling descant quavers in the ayre, And on the rivers murmuring base doth run, The Marble-skyes, with checker'd varnish faire, My branch-embossed bed, of natures care; The flowers my smell, the flood my thirst to steep, Thus like a King, with pleasure rock'd a sleepe. 8 When in a dreame it seemed unto mee A noyse of trumpets from the flood arose, As when great Beta in her pompe wee see, When shee by London on the water goes, The dauncing Barge with silent musick rowes: The people thronging on the wharfes &amp; shores, The ayre with shouts, the water fill'd with oares. 9 A troope of Nymphes came suddainly on land, When thus was ended this tryumphant sound, Encompassing mee, lying on the strand, Taking theyr places on the grassy ground, Theyr ory tresses all with Laurell crown'd, Casting theyr sober modest eyes a space, Upon my swarty mellancholly face. 10 Betwixt two Ladies came a goodly Knight, As newly brought from some distresfull place, It seem'd to mee he was some noble wight, Though his attyre were miserable and base, And care made furrowes in his manly face: And though cold age had frosted his faire haires, It rather seem'd for sorrow then for yeares. 11 The one a princely Lady did support This feeble Image which coulde scarcly stand: The other, fleering in disdainfull sort, With scornefull jesture drew him by the hand, Who being blind, yet bound with many a band. At length, I found this proude disdainefull Dame Was Fortune, and the other, glorious Fame. 12 Fame on his right hand, in a robe of gold, Whose stately trayne, Time as her Page did beare, On which, for rich embrawdery was enrold, The deedes of all the Worthies ever were, So strongly wrought, as wrong could not empeire, Whose large memorialls shee did still rehearse, In Poets man-immortalizing verse. 13 Two Tables on her goodly breast shee bore, The one of Christall, th'other Ebony, Engrav'd with names of all that liv'd before That; the faire booke of heavenly memory, Th'other, the black scrowle of infamy: One stuffd with Poets, Saints, &amp; Conquerers, Th'other with Atheists, Tyrants, Usurers. 14 And in her words appeared as a wonder, Her during force, and never-failing might, Which softly spake, farre of were as a thunder, And round about the world wold take their flight, And bring the most obscurest things to light; That still the farther of, the greater still Did ever sound our good, or make our ill. 15 Fortune, as blinde as he whom she doth leade, Her feature chang'd each minute of the hower, Her riggish feet fantastickly would tread, Now would shee smile, &amp; suddainly would lower, And with one breth, her words were sweet &amp; sower. Upon her foes, she amorously would glaunce, And on her followers, coylie looke a scaunce. 16 About her necke, (it seem'd as for a chaine) Some Princes crownes &amp; broken scepters hong, Upon her arme a lazie youth did leane, Which scornfully unto the ground shee flong; And with a wanton grace passing along, Great bags of gold from out her bosome drew, And to base Pesants and fond Ideots threw. 17 A dusky vaile which hid her sightles eyes, Like clowds, which cover our uncertaine lives, Painted about with bloody Tragedies, Fooles wearing crownes, &amp; wisemen clogd in gives, Now, how she gives, againe, how she deprives; In this black Map thus shee her might discovers, In Campes, and Courts, on soldiers, kings, &amp; lovers. 18 An easie rysing little banck there was, The seate fayre Flora somtime sat upon, Curling her locks in lovely Isis glasse, To revell in the Springs pavilion, Here was her court, and this her princly throne; Here set they downe this poore distressed man, And in this sort proude Fortune first began. 19 Behold (quoth she) this Duke of Normandy, The heire of William, Conqueror of this Ile, Which thou poore Fame hast vow'd to glorifie, Whose history this Poet must compile; My slave, my scorne, my prisoner, an exile, Whose life I mark'd with my black dismall brand, And thou would'st now eternize with thy hand. 20 Thou art an Eccho, a by-word, a wind, Thine ayrie bodie is composd of breath, A wandring blast, within no place confin'd, Which oft of nothing, silly somthing saith, Yet never canst speake well till after death; And from imagination hast thy birth, Unknowne in heaven, &amp; unperceiv'd on earth. 21 First, in opinion had'st thou thy creation, Form'd with conceit, the needy Poets frend, And like opinion, keep'st no certaine fashion, Yet in a circle still thy course doth end: And but a Post which all base rumors send, An needles burden of an idle song, The prophane accent of each witles tongue. 22 Slaunders vile spy, a runnagate, a thiefe, Which day and night in every chinck doth peepe, A blab, a wanton, lightest of beliefe, Nor in thy gate a meane doost ever keepe, But now hie in the ayre, now in the deepe; Reporting that which thou doost but suppose, And telling that thou never should'st disclose. 23 With extreame toyle and labour thou art sought, Danger the way that leadeth to thy Cell, Onely with death thy favours must be bought, And who obtaines thee, fetcheth thee from hell, Where thou ensconst with fiery swords dost dwell. And when thou art with all this perrill found, Thou art a suddaine voice, a tinckling sound. 24 My out-cast abjects, such as I disgrace, And ever-more have held in hatefull scorne, And in the world have set in servile place, These be thy favorits, these thou doost subborne, These wait on Fame, whose weeds be neerly worne: Yet cannot these poore wretches come to thee, Unlesse before they be preferr'd by mee. 25 That trump thou saist, wakes dead men from theyr traunce Is not of precious gold as some do deeme, A brazen pipe, by which vaine fooles do daunce, And but to sound so loude doth onely seeme, Sith points of vertue no man doth esteeme, And with this toy the idle braine abusest, And so their folly and thy fault excusest. 26 Except in perrill, thou doost not appeare, And yet in perrill ebbing still and flowing, Flying from him that seeth succour neere, Diminished at hand, augmented going, On fertile stocks decay'd, on barraine growing. Lost life with rumors thou doost but repayre, And what thou promisest, thou payest with ayre. 27 In balefull Hearses, sad and sable grounds, On gory letters thy memorialls lye, Thy lines are deepe immedicable wounds, And towards the dust thou point'st thy tearful eye, Never discover'd but in Tragedy: Thy stony hart is pittifull to none, But Syren-like, to their destruction. 28 This orbes great revolution knowes my power, And how I raigne with the eternall Fates, With whom I sit in counsell every howre, On change of times, subversion of states, On their beginnings, on their severall dates, In destining haps past, on things to come, In judgement till the everlasting dome. 29 The starrs my Table-bookes wherein I write, My Register the spacious circling Sky, On heavens great brow I carefully endite Unhappy mans long birth-markt desteny, And by my power, my lawes I ratefy, And his fraile will imperiously controule, With such quaint clauses as I there enroule. 30 To me the heavens have theyr Commission given, And in my Charter all their right compil'd, That I alone should blesse as beautious heaven, And honor those on whom I meane to smile, To gaine them tytles of immortall stile, That all should worthy be which I bestow, Nor reason urg'd, but for I thinke it so. 31 In great predestination is my beeing, Whose depth yet wisdom never could discerne, And in her secrets, more then secrets seeing, Where learning stil may learne how still to learne, Those points which do the deepest points conscerne, Where sacred texts unlock the way to me, To lighten those which will my glory see. 32 What names old Poets to their gods did give, Were onely figures to expresse my might, To shew the vertues that in mee doe live, My onely power on this all-mooving wight, And all their Alters unto mee were dight: Whose wondrous working, stil to times did bring Matter whereon they ever-more might sing. 33 Still most uncertaine varying in my course, Yet in these changes hold one certaine end, Crossing mans fore-cast, weakning wisdoms force, To none still foe, to none a perfect frend, Amazing thought to thinke what I pretend. Depressing vertue sometime, that thereby Shee taking wing againe may sore on hie. 34 Forth of my lap I poure aboundant blisse, All good proceedes from my all-giving hand, By me man happie, or unhappie is, Blest if I blesse, repuls'd if I with-stand, And I alone am friendships onely band; Upon whose Lincks all greedely take hold, Which being broke, our zealous faith growes cold. 35 Pawsing shee frownes, when sudainly againe, A roaring noyse ariseth from the flood, As when a tempest with a shower of raine Is heard far off within some mightie wood, At which me thought all things amazed stood: As though her words such power with them did beare As Sea &amp; Land did quake her voice to heare. 36 When Fame yet smiling mildly thus replyes, Alasse (quoth shee) what labour thou hast lost, What wondrous mists thou casts before our eyes, Yet will the gaine not countervaile the cost, What couldst thou say if thou hadst cause to boast: Which thus canst paint such wonders of thy worth, Yet art far lesse, then nothing can set forth. 37 A hap, a chaunce, a casuall event, The vulgars Idoll, and a childish terror, A what men will, a silly accedent, The maske of blindnesse, and disguise of error, Natures vile nickname, follies foolish mirror; A tearme, a by-word, by tradition learn'd, A hearesay, nothing, not to be discern'd. 38 A wanton feare, a silly Infants dreame, A vaine illusion, a meere fantasie, A seeming shade, a lunatick mans theame: A fond Aenigma, a flat heresie, Imaginations doting trumperie; A folly in it selfe, it one selfe lothing, A thing that would be, and yet can be nothing. 39 Disease of time, Ambitions Concubine, A minde-entrauncing snare, a slippery Ice, The baite of death, destructions heady wine, Vaine-glories Patron, the fooles paradice, Fond hope, wherewith confusion doth entice; A vile seducing fiend, which haunts men still, To loose them in the errors of their will. 40 A reason, which no reason can discusse, And hast the ground of all thy strength from hence, Walking in shadow of mans Genius, In humane birth pretending residence; A riddle, made of the starrs influence, Which good and evill doost thy title frame, Yet neither good nor evill, but in name. 41 Those ignorant which made a God of Nature, And Natures God divinely never knew, Were those which first erected Fortunes stature, From whence this vile idolatry first grew, Which times defect into mens eares still blew: Grounding their usurpations foolish lawes, On the opinion of so poore a cause. 42 Sloth first did hatch thee in her sleepie Cell, And with base thoughts, in idlenes wast bred, With cowardize thou ever-more doost dwell, And with dishonourable ease art fed, In superstitious humors brought to bed: A gossips tale thy greatest proofe doth lend, On old-sayd sawes thy tytle doth depend. 43 Thy habit loosenes, and thy measure wast, Deceitfull, vaine, inhumane, fickle, light, Thou poysonest him to whom thou giv'st to tast, Gainst vertue still thou bendest all thy might, With honourable thoughts thou wagest fight; The yeelding man, in fetters thou doost binde, But weake and slavish to the constant minde. 44 Who leanes to thee, whom thou hast not deceiv'd? Who flattrest thou, whom thou abusest not? Who hopes of thee, and not of hope bereav'd? Whose secrets known, what shame do'st thou not blot? Who not devour'd, thou in thy pawes hast got? Who's he, or where yet ever was he found, That thou might'st hurt, &amp; didst not deadly wound? 45 The slavish peasant is thy favorite, In chaunge and chaunces all thy glory is, In vile and basest things thou tak'st delite, In earthly mud consisteth all thy blisse, What canst thou be which art bewitch'd with this? For weart thou heavenly, thou in love wouldst be, With that which neerest doth resemble thee. 46 I am the powerfull messenger of heaven, My wings the lightning spreading farre &amp; wide, To every coast I with a thought am driven, And on the gorgeous sun-beames doe I ride, To heaven I mount, downe to the earth I slide: I regester the worlds eternall howers, The Secretarie of the immortall powers. 47 Refuge of hope, the harbinger of truth, Handmaide of heaven, vertues skilfull guide, The life of life, the ages springing youth, Triumph of joy, eternities faire bride, The Virgins glory, and the Martirs pride: The courages immortall raysing fier, The very height to which great thoughts aspire. 48 The staire by which men to the Starres doe clime, The minds first moover, greatnes to expresse, Fayths armour, and the vanquisher of time, A pleasant sweete against deaths bitternes, The high reward which doth all labours blesse; The studie which doth heavenly things impart, The joy amidst the tedious wayes of Art. 49 Learnings greene Lawrell, Justice glorious throne, The Muses chariot, Memories true foode, The Poets life, the Gods companion, The fire-reviving Phænix Sun-nurst broode, The spirits eternall Image, honors good; The Balsamum which cures the Souldiers scarre, The world-discovering Sea-mans happy Starre. 50 My dwelling place betwixt the earth and skies, My Turret unto heaven her top upreares, The windowes made of Lynceus piercing eyes, And all the walls be made of daintiest eares, Where every thing thats done in earth appeares; No word is whispered in this vaulty round, But in my Pallace straightwayes it doth sound. 51 The pavement is of ratling brasen drums, The Rafters trumpets which do rend the aire, Sounding aloud each name that thither comes, The chinks like tongues of all things talking there, And all things past, in memorie doe beare: The dores unlock with every word man saith, And open wide with every little breath. 52 It's hong about with Arms &amp; conquering spoiles, The pillers which support the roofe of this, Are tropheis, graven with Herculean toiles, The roofe of garlands, crownes, and ensignes is, In midst of which a christall Pyramis: All over carv'd with men of most renowne, Whose base is my faire chaire, the spire my crowne. 53 Here in the bodies likenes whilst it lives, Appeare the thoughts, proceeding from the mind, To which the place a forme more glorious gives, And there they be immortally devin'd, By vertue there more heavenly refin'd; And when the earthly body once doth perrish, There doth this place the minds true Image cherish. 54 My beauty never fades, but as new borne, As yeares encrease, so ever waxing young, My strength is not diminished nor worne, What weakneth all things, ever makes me strong: Nor from my hand, my Scepter can be wroong: Times sacriligious rapine I defie, A tributarie to eternitie. 55 The face of heaven my chronicles containe, Where I erect the Tropheis of my fame, Which there in glorious characters remaine, The gorgeous seeling of th'immortall frame, The constellations letters of my name, Where my memorialls evermore abide, In those pure bodies highly glorified. 56 Fame ending thus, Fortune againe began Further to urge what she before had said, And loe (quoth she) Duke Robert is the man Who by my might and pollicie's betraid, Then let us see how thou canst lend him aide: I tooke from him his libertie and crowne, Raise thou him up, whom I have thus thrown downe. 57 Quoth Fame a fitter instance is there none Then Robert is, then Fortune doe thy worst: Here may thy weaknes, and my power be showne, Here shall I blesse, whom thou before hast curst, Begin thou then, since thus thy turne comes first, And thou shalt see how great a power I have Over the world, proud Fortune, and the grave. 58 (Quoth Fortune) then, my hand did point the Star, The seale wherwith heaven sign'd his utmost date, Which markt his birth with brands of bloody war, Rash mutinys, rude garboiles, harsh debate, His forrain plagues, home wrongs, &amp; private hate: And on the height of his great Fathers glory, First laid the ground work of his Sonnes sad story. 59 Nature, which did her best at Roberts birth, I most undid in his nativitie, This friend I made his greatest foe on earth, Her gifts I made his greatest enemie, Framing such mildnes in Nobilitie: Differing so far from haughtie Williams straine, That thus hee judg'd his Sonne unfit to raigne. 60 And yet that courage which he did inherit, And from the greatnes of his blood had taken, Stird up with griefe, awakes his greater spirit, Which more and more did Williams hate awaken, Hee thus forsaken, as hee had forsaken: Yet to his will so partiallie inclind, As now his rage, his reason quite doth blind. 61 Now doe I leane to him whom all have left, Laughing on him, on whom dispaire doth lowre, Lending him hope, of former hope bereft, Giving his youth large wings wherwith to towre, Ayding his power, to crosse great Williams power: That so his might, in countermaunding might By his owne wrong, might hinder his owne right. 62 That whilst his Fathers fierie tempered sword Through Albions cleeves, the fatall entrance made, With Germaine power, returnes this youthfull Lord, With others Armes, his owne bounds to invade, And Normandy lyes coucht under his blade, Thinking to make a present meane of this, To make his owne yet doubtfull to be his. 63 Towards Williams end, now Williams hate begun, Whom he begot, doth now beget his woe, He scarce a Father, Robert scarse a Sonne, His Sonne the Father of his overthrowe, Youth old in will, age young in hate doth growe: He nursing that which doth all mischiefe nurse, He by his blessing, causing his owne curse. 64 And yet least age might coole Duke Williams blood, With warrs in Fraunce I still the heate suppli'd, That whilst young Robert yet disgraced stood Justly condemn'd of insolence and pride, In this confirm'd, the famous Conqueror di'd: Setting proud Rufus on his regall throne, Whilst Norman Robert strives but for his owne. 65 Much trust in him, a carelesnes first bred, His courage makes him over-confident, Blinding revenge, besides his course him led, When lost his wits, in errors darknes went, Rashnes sees all, but nothing can prevent: What his mind loth'd, disgrace did urge him to, Making his will the cause of his owne woe. 66 This buried trunck of William is the roote From which these two world-shadowing branches spred, This factious body standing on this foote, These two crosse currents springing from one head, And both with one selfe nutriment are fed, Upon themselves their owne force so should spend, Till in themselves, they both themselves shold end. 67 Thus the old conquest hath new conquests made, And Norman Ensignes shaddow English fields, The brother now, the brother must invade, The conquerors shield, against the conquerors shield, Right wounding right, nor wrong to wrong will yield: One arme beare off the others furious stroke, Scepter with Scepter, sword with sword be broke. 68 The hatefull soiles where death was sown in blood, Encreasing vengeance one against the other, And now the seede of wrath began to bud, Which in their bosoms they so long did smother, These but as bastards, England their step mother; Weakning her selfe, by mallice gives them strength With murdring hands to spoile themselves at length. 69 This Williams death, gives Roberts troubls life, Whose life in death made lucklesse Robert live, This end of strife, beginneth greater strife, Giving to take, what it did take to give, Living depriv'd, which dead doth him deprive; Evill brought good, that good converts to ill, Thus life and death breed Roberts mischiefe still. 70 When first King William entred on this Ile, Harrold had friends, but then the Norman none, But Rufus lived here as an exile, And Robert hop'd to raigne of many a one, Onely my hand held up his slyding throne: William but weake, beats Harrold down by wrong, William supplanting Robert, Robert strong. 71 Odo the prop which Rufus power upheld, Revolting then, inrag'd with Lanfrancks spight, And on this hope grounding his faith, rebell'd, In bloody letters writing Roberts right, Great Mortayns power, and strong Mountgomeres might: Mangling this Ile with new deformed scars, Ere peace had cur'd the wounds of former wars. 72 The Normans glory in the conquest won, The English bruzed with their battred Armes, The Normans followed what they had begun, The English fearefull of their former harmes, What cooles the English, Norman corage warms: The Normans entred to new victorie, The English for their fight already flie, 73 Whilst Rufus hopes thus freshly bleeding lay, And now with ruine all things went to wrack, Destruction having found the perfect way, Were not proud Robert by some meanes kept back, By fond delayes, I forc'd him time to slack: And stopt the mischiefe newly thus begun, To undoe all what he before had done. 74 Thus first by counsell spurr'd I on the rage, Forcing the streame of their distempred blood, Then by my counsaile, did againe aswage, When this great Duke secure of conquest stood, Pyning his force, giving advantage foode; That first by taking Arms, he strength might loose, And making peace, give strength unto his foes. 75 A peace concluded to destroy their peace, A suddaine truce to breed a lingring war, That Arms might cease, while mischiefe might increase, To bring death neere, by sending safety far, In making that, which made, all quite might mar: Treason crept in by this adulterate kay, Into the closset where his counsailes lay. 76 Thus made a friend, to rob him of his friend, The meanes a foe, might weaken so his foe, To frame this strange beginning to his end, The well-cast plot of utter overthrowe, In this faire vizard, masking in this showe: That since hate thus in wearing would not prove, He brings him now in habite of his love. 77 Thus reconcil'd by me, one to the other, Joyn'd in this poore devided union, These brothers now make war upon their brother, As loth from them he should goe free alone, To shape his mischiefe truly by their owne; To drawe on griefe, and urge it to be more, Because it came not fast enough before. 78 This by fore-sight still wisely provident To spur them on beyond degrees of ill, To make their furie far more violent, And ground their ruine on their peevish will, That mischiefe should be getting mischiefe still: That injurie so far should pitty chase, As reconcilement never should take place. 79 And here to shew my power on thee poore Fame, I made thee now my greatest instrument, That in the furie of this raging flame, Even in the height of Henryes discontent, To Roberts eares the brute of war I sent: Of Palæstine that leaving all with them, He might away to great Jerusalem. 80 With that sweet fume of honors shortest breath, Feeding the humor which possest his hart, When now drew on the time of Williams death, That in this fatall hower he should depart, Herein to shew my very depth of Art: That Henry now in England left alone, Might seate himselfe in Roberts rightfull throne. 81 The warlick Musique of these clattring Armes, Doth stop his eares like a tempestious wind That now he finds no presage of his harmes, Beyond all course so lifted is his mind, Declaring well the greatnes of his kind; Mounted so high within the spacious ayre, As out of sight of ground, he dreads no snare. 82 His Father dy'd when first his cares tooke breath, His Brother dyes, now when his woes should die, His sorrowes thus are strangely borne in death, All-ending death, brings forth his miserie, Such is my power in humaine destenie: That where an utter ruine I pretend, Destruction doth begin, where hate should end. 83 Thus laid the complot in the course of all, I make his safetie unto him more deare, Seated, from whence he never thought to fall, Assur'd of good, if any good there were, That now each thought a Scepter seems to beare: Which such a hold in his great spirit doth winne, As after, made his error proove his sinne. 84 With grace young Henry to his throne I bring Making great friends of mighty enemies, Shewing my power in this new raigning King, As by my hand invisibly to rise, Decking his crowne with worldly dignities: Forging his tongue with such a sacred fire, As could perswade, what ere he would desire. 85 In Palæstine with Robert, Fame doth rest, In England with young Beauclark, Fortune bides, These mightie Ladies, of these Lords possest, Thus each of these, with each of these devides, Thus weare we factious then on either sides: Fame for brave Short-thigh, purchasing renowne, Fortune for Beauclark, for the English crowne. 86 Thou wooest, I win, thou suest, and I obtaine, What I possesse, that onely thou dost crave, Thou layest out to gaine, but what I gaine Thou dost desire, I in possession have, Thou hordst, I spend, I lavish, thou dost save: Thou scarsely art, yet that thou art to mee, Thou wouldst, I can, thou servile, I am free. 87 Robert growne weake, Henry recovered strength, What quencht the Normans glory, fir'd his will, Robert is fallen, Henry got up at length, Robert no guide, Henry is steerd with skill, Grounding his good on lucklesse Roberts ill: Their mutuall courage, and unmooved hate, Tels Henryes rise, decline of Roberts state. 88 From perrils safe, no place at home he sees, Abroad he wins, at home he still doth lose, At home, wasted with civill enemies, Whilst he abroad is conquering forraine foes, Wasting at home, more then abroad he growes: At home his daunger unto many knowne, Yet he abroad is carelesse of his owne. 89 Now bring I Robert from these glorious wars, Triumphing in the conquered Pagans flight, From forraine broiles to toile in home-nurst jars, From getting others Lands, for's owne to fight, Forced by wrong, by sword to claime his right: And with that sword in Panyms blood imbrude, To save himselfe, by his own friends pursude. 90 Thus he's inrich'd with that he cannot see, With few vaine titles swelling in his name, And all his substance but meere shadowes be, Whilst he strange castles in the aire doth frame, Lo such a mighty Monarchesse is Fame: That, what she gives, so easie is to beare, As of those gifts, none robbing need to feare. 91 This whets his spleene, but doth his strength abate, Much care for coyne, makes care for kingdoms lesse, His feeblenes must hold up Henries state, These beare up him, which Roberts hopes suppresse, Whose brothers comfort is in his distresse; This is the meane he undertooke to try, With Roberts blood his safety first to buy. 92 With kind intreaty he doth first begin, Not fullie yet establisht as he would, By this advantage to get further in, Till he had got a sure and faster hold, Baiting unseene, deceit with sums of gold: By yearely tribute from his crowne to rise, To stop the mouth of passed injuries. 93 This peace to which the mutenie must yield, And English tribute paid to Normandy, What Robert thinks his safegard's Henries shield, And Roberts selfe, doth Robert injurie, This tribute wrongs his true Nobilitie; And from this source from whence their peace shold spring, Proceeds the cause of Roberts ruining. 94 These summs, the sinewes of Duke Roberts war, Like howerly tides, his flowing current fed, And to his fier the lively fuell are, His will the streame, and this the Fountaine head, Having his humor fitlie cherished: Deceiptfull Henry, reobtaines at length, Unto his Arme adding Duke Roberts strength. 95 This want his haughtie courage soone doth find, Cutting the quils of his high flying wings, That now he must commit him to the wind, Driven which way the furious tempest flings; Powerlesse of that, which giveth power to Kings; Which desperate griefe, his mind enrageth so, As makes him past all reason in his woe. 96 Honor gave entertainment to beliefe, Under which collour treason in was brought, Which slew his strength before he felt the griefe, Pure innocence seldom suspecteth ought, No base affection maister of his thought, Nor majestie inward deceit had learn'd, More then to shew, her outward eyes discern'd. 97 Miserie seem'd nothing, yet to him unknowne, Not knowing evill, evill could not flie, Not savouring sorrow, having tasted none, To find lurking deceit he look'd too hie, To honest minds, Fraud doth the soonest pry: Whose nature thus I chose to be the mould, Therein to worke what forme of hap I would. 98 His owne compassion, cause of his owne care, Upon his thought, his constant promise stood, Vertue in him, most naturally rare, No vile base humor tainted his pure blood, His bounty still gave good desert her food; His mind so great, and honorably free, Made him too prone to loose credulitie. 99 His counsels thus are combred by his care, In nothing certaine but uncertaintie, His friends resolv'd on nothing but dispaire, Yet shewes he greatnes in most misery, Each place become a stage for Tragedy; By error, wandring far beyond his scope, Strong in desire, but weakest in his hope. 100 In publique shame, oft counsell seemes disgrac'd, No priviledge can from the Fates protect: In desperation, counsell hath no taste, Untamed rage doth all advise reject, Hiding the course which reason should direct; Making himselfe the author of his harms, Without experience, valor wants his arms. 101 Now I, whose power in Williams wars was seene, When first on Williams conquest he begun, To shew my selfe the worlds imperious Queene, Now turne my selfe against his warlike son, To lose by me, by me his Father won: On Englands part, gainst Normandy to stand, Which Normandy had conquered by my hand. 102 The conquest William made upon this Ile, With Norman blood be-peopling Brittany, Even now as Brittons made within a while Turne with revenge to conquer Normandy, Thus victory goes back to victory: That his own blood, wins what before he won, His conquering son, subdu'd his conquering son. 103 Thus Norman townes begirt with English arms, The furious brother dealing wrathfull blowes: Both pressing in where deadly perrill swarms, These English-Norman, Norman-English foes, At last doe get, what they at first did lose: As Normandy did Englands fall provoke, Now Norman necks must beare the English yoke. 104 The flood of mischiefe thus comes in againe, What Fortune works, not alwaies seems pretended, The wind thus turn'd, blows back the fire amaine, Where first mischance began, she will be ended, And he defend him, from those he offended: For this we find, the course of fatall things, Is best discern'd in states of Realms &amp; Kings. 105 On whom of late in Palæstine I smild, In civill warrs now dreadfully I frowne; He call'd from exile, I from him exil'd, To leave his crowne, who had refus'd a crowne, Who beat all down, now heare is beaten down, Here to lose all, who there had gotten all, To make his fall, more grievous in his fall. 106 To England now a prisoner they him bring, Now is he hers, which claim'd her for his owne, A Captive, where he should have been a King, His dungeon made wher shold have been his throne, Now buried there, wheras he shold have growne. In one poore tower mew'd up, within one place, Whose Empires bounds the Ocean shold embrace. 107 Could mortall sence containe immortall hate, Or reason sound the depth of things divine, Judgement might stand amaz'd at Roberts state, And thinke no might to be compar'd with mine, That all power may unto my power resigne: And that in Roberts fall, the world may see Amongst the starrs what power remaines in mee. 108 That sword which on his fortune hath such power Yet powerles is to end his wretched dayes: Those daies which in their course all things devoure, To his swift griefe, makes slow and lazie staies, To Tyrannies long raigne he thus obaies, That he in life a thousand deaths might die, Onely in mercy rackt with crueltie. 109 He hath no joy but in his miseries, His greatest comfort is the blessed light, For which, (as I were angry with his eyes) I make the King deprive him of his sight, To sute his daies so justly with the night, That sencles stones to mone he should not see, Yet sencles stones behold his misery. 110 And this he felt, that Fortune made him blinde, Least his eyes objects yet might lighten care: That that light wanting, more might light his minde, Whose eyes might see how great his sorrows are; That every sence, that sences woe might share: And so that sence depriv'd of joy alone, Might more increase the griefe of every one. 111 These griefes and horrors, enemies of rest, Which murther life where they do harbor long, Kill humors, which his body oft opprest, Unnaturally, thus making nature strong, As out of deaths dead stock new life still sprong, As life with death had tempted him till now, Yet death to life no ease would er'e allow. 112 Death he fear'd not, is taught his end to feare, Life, once he lov'd, with him now fall'n in love, That foe, a friend, to hurt him doth forbeare, That friend a foe, he cannot now remove, Twixt them, he all extremities doth prove: Aged in youth, to pine his joy thereby, Youthfull in age, to suffer misery. 113 Courage forbids that he himselfe should kill, His life too proud to be constrain'd to die, His will permits not death now when he will, What would dispaire, true valor doth deny; Thus life lifes foe, death is deaths enemy: Willing to die, by life him double killing, Urging to die, twice dying, he unwilling. 114 So many yeeres as he hath worne a crowne, So many yeeres as he hath hop'd to rise, So many yeeres he lives thus quite thrown downe, So many yeeres he lives without his eyes: So many yeeres in dying ere hee dyes; So many yeeres lockt up in prison strong, Though sorrow make the shortest time seeme long. 115 Thus sway I in the course of earthly things, That Time might worke him everlasting spite, To shew, that power yet ever makes not kings, Nor that conceit can compasse my deceit, In fined things such mervails infinite: Nor any wonder is to be supposed, In that wherein all wonders are inclosed. 116 At Fortuns speech they stand as all amaz'd, Whilst Fame herselfe doth wonder at his woe, And all upon this deadly Image gaz'd, Whose misery shee had discribed so; But in revenge of this dispightfull foe, Fame from a slumber (as it seem'd) awake, On his behalfe, thus for herselfe be-spake. 117 What time I came from world-renowned Rome, To waken Europe from her drouzie traunce, Summoning the Princes of great Christendome, To Palæstine their Ensignes to advaunce, Sounding my trump in England, Spaine, &amp; Fraunce To move the Christians to religious war, From Pagans hands to free Christs sepulchar. 118 That holy Hermit Peter, then as one Which as a Saint bewaild so great a losse: With Bulloigne Godfrey, Christs strong champion, Under the Banner of the bloody Crosse, Now on the Alps the conquering collours tosse, Leading along the bravest Christian band, To reare their Tropheys in the Holy Land. 119 Hether the flocks of gallant spirits do throng, The place whence immortalitie doth spring, To whom the hope of conquest doth belong, Nor any thought, lesse, then to be a King; Hether doth Fame her deerest children bring: And in this Camp shee makes her treasury, The rarest Jems of Europs Chivalry. 120 This conquering lord, the Conquerors eldest sonne, Whose hand did then the Norman scepter weld, In Armes to win what once his Father won, To Englands conquest is againe compeld, Whose crown from him proud William Rufus held, An exile thence, by's angry Father driven, By Fortune robd, of all by Nature given. 121 With fame of this, once Roberts eares possest, With heavenly wonder doth his thoughts inspire, Leaving no place for wrong in his faire brest, Giving large wings unto his great desire, Warming his courage with more glorious fire, As thus to fight for his deere Saviours sake, Of Englands crowne he no account doth make. 122 Of kingdoms tytles he casts off the toyle Which by proude Rufus tyranny is kept: Deere as his life to him that hallowed soile, Wherein that God in lively manhood slept, At whose deere death, the rocks for pitty wept; A crown of gold this Christian knight doth scorne, So much he lov'd those temples crown'd with thorne. 123 Those grievous wants whose burthen weyed him downe, The sums which he in Germany had spent, In gathering power to gaine the English crowne, Garded with princly troopes in his rich Tent, Like William Conquerors sonne magnificent, Now by his need, he greevously doth find, Weakning his might, what never could his mind. 124 This brave high spirited Duke, this famous Lord, Whose right of England Rufus held away, To set an edge upon his conquering sword, In gage to Henry, Normandy did lay, Thus to maintaine his valiant souldiers pay: Rather of Realms himselfe to dispossesse, Then Christendome should be in such distresse. 125 Eternall sparks of honors purest fire, Vertue of vertues, Angels angeld mind, Where admiration may it selfe admire, Where mans divinest thoughts are more divin'd, Saint sainted spirit, in heavens own shrine enshrind, Endeared dearest thing, for ever living, Receiving most of Fame, to Fame more giving. 126 Such fervent zeale doth from his soule proceed, As those curl'd tresses which his browes adorne, Untill that time Jerusalem were freed, Hee makes a vow they never should be shorne, But for a witnes of that vow be worne; True vow, strong faith, great lord, most happy howr, Perform'd, increasd, blest by effecting power. 127 True vow, so true, as truth to it is vowed, Vowing all power to help so pure a vow, Allowing perfect zeale to be allowed, If zeale of perfect truth might ere allow, Then much admir'd, but to be wondred now; Faith in it selfe, then wonder more concealing, Faith to the world, then wonder more revealing. 128 Disheveld locks, what names might give you grace? Worne thus disheveld for his deere Lords sake, Sweet-flowring twists, valors engirdling lace, Browe-decking fringe, faire golden curled flake, Honors rich garland, beauties messhing brake, Arbors of joy, which nature once did give, Where vertue should in endles Sommer live. 129 Faire Memory, awaken Death from sleepe, Call up Times spirit, of passed things to tell, Unseale the secrets of th'unsearched deepe, Let out the prisoners from Oblivions Cell, Invoke the black inhabitants of hell: Into the earths deepe dungeon let the light, And with faire day cleere up his clowdy night. 130 Eternitie, bee prodigall a while, With thine immortall arms imbrace thy love, Divinest Powers, upon your image smile, And from your star-encircled thrones above, Earths misty vapors from his sight remove, And in the Annals of the glorious sun, Enrole his worth, in Times large course to run. 131 Truth in his life, bright Poesie uphold, His life in truth adorning Poesie: Which casting life in a more purer mold, Preserves that life to immortalitie, Both truly working, eyther glorifie; Truth by her power, Arts power to justifie, Truth in Arts roabs, adorn'd by Poesie. 132 To his victorious Ensigne comes from far, The Redshanck'd Orcads, toucht with no remorse, The light-foote Irish, which with darts make war, Th'ranck-ryding Scot, on his swift running horse, The English Archer, of a Lyons force: The valiant Norman all his troupes among, In bloody conquests tryed, in Arms train'd long. 133 Remote by nature in thys colder Clyme, Another nature he new birth doth bring, And by the locks he haleth aged Tyme, As newly he created every thing; Shewing the place where heavens eternall King Our deere blood-bought redemption first began, Man covering God, earth heaven, &amp; God in man. 134 Poore Ilanders, which in the Oceans chaine, Too long imprisoned from the cheerfull day, Your warlike Guide now brings you to the maine, Which to your glory makes the open way: And his victorious hand becomes the kay To let you in to famous victories; The honor of your brave posterities. 135 Be favourable faire heaven unto thine owne, And with that Bethelem birth-foretelling star Still goe before this Christian Champion; In fiery pillers lead him out from far, Let Angels martch with him unto this war, With burning-bladed Cherubins still keepe, Encompasse him with clowds when he doth sleep. 136 When heaven puts on her glittering vaile of stars, And with sweet sleep the souldiers sences charms, Then are his thoughts working these holy wars, Plotting assaults, watchful at all alarms, Rounding the Campe in rich appareld Arms; His sleep their watch, his care their safeties kay, Their day his night, his night he makes their day. 137 Valors true valor, honours living crowne, Inspired thoughts, desert above desert, Greatnes beyond imaginations bound, Nature more sweet then is exprest by Art, A hart declaring a true princly hart: Courage uniting courage unto glory, A subject fit for all immortall story. 138 Why shold not heaven by night when forth he went Convert the stars to Sunnes to give him light? And at his prayers by day in his close Tent, The Tapers unto starrs, to help his sight? That in his presence darknes might be bright; That every thing more purer in his kind, Might tell the purenes of his purer mind. 139 Yet Letters but like little Ilands bee, And many words within this world of fame, Whose Regions rise and fall in their degree, Large volumes short descriptions of his name, Like little Maps painting his Globes great fame: Wit lost in wonder, seeking to expresse His vertues sum, his praises universe. 140 In greevous toyles consisteth all his rest, In having most, of most enjoyeth none, Most wanting that whereof he is possest, A King ordain'd, ne're to enjoy his throne, That least his own, which richly is his own: In this devision from himselfe devided, Himselfe a guide for others safety, guided. 141 His one poore lyfe, devided is to many, Dead to his comfort, doth to others live, Unto himselfe he is the least of any, All from him taken, unto all doth give, Depriv'd of joy, of care his to deprive: Who al controuleth, now that all controules, Body of bodyes, his soule of their soules. 142 Religious war, more holy pilgrimage, Both Saint &amp; souldier, Captaine, Confessor, A devout youth, a resolute old age, A warlike States-man, peacefull Conqueror, Grave Consull, true autentique Senator; Feare-chasing resolution, valiant feare, Hart bearing nought, yet patient all to beare. 143 Skill, valour guides, and valour armeth skill, Courage emboldneth wit, wit courage arms, This is the thred which leadeth on his will, This is the steere which guides him in these storms, To see his good, and to foresee his harms: Not flying life, in fortune so content, Not fearing death, as truly valient. 144 He feasts desire with sweetest temperance, Greatnes he decks in modesties attire, Honor he doth by humblenes advance, By sufferance he raiseth courage hier, His holy thoughts by patience still aspire: To fashion vertue strangely he doth seeke, Making poore hope impatient, sorrow meeke. 145 Then in his joy, he nothing lesse injoyes, Still of him selfe the worser part he is, What most shold please him, him the most annoyes, Of his, there's nothing can be called his, And what he hath, that doth he ever misse; His thought of conquest, so doth rest invade, Thus is he made, as unto others made. 146 All things to him be prosperous as he would, Not trusting Fortune, nor distrusting Fate, Resolv'd to hope, hap what soever could, Joying in woe, in joy disconsolate, Joy lightneth woe, woe joy doth moderate; Carelesse of both, indifferent twixt either, Wooed of both, yet yeelding unto neither. 147 Endlesse his toyle, a figure of his fame, And his life ending gives his name no end, Lasting that forme where vertue builds the frame, Those sums unnumbred glory gives to spend, Our bodies buried, then our deeds ascend: Those deeds in life, to worth cannot be rated, In death with life, our fame even then is dated. 148 Willing to doe, he thinketh what to doe, That what he did, exactly might be done, That due foresight before the act might goe, Which wisely warning might all errors shun, That care might finish what he had begun: Justly directed in the course of things, By that straight rule which sound experience brings. 149 From famous Godfrey and the Christian hoast, Unto the mighty Grecian Emperor, Now is he sent, through many perrils tost, This Norman Duke, the brave Ambassador, His royall spirit so much ne're seene before; As with his princely traine when he doth come, Before the towne of faire Bizantium. 150 From forth the holy Region is he sent, Bending his course through Macedon and Thrace, Yet never would he sleepe but in his Tent, Till he return'd unto that hallowed place, Till he beheld that famous Godfreis face; Nor never rest his body in a bed, Till Palæstine were free delivered. 151 Triumphall prowesse, true disposed care, Cleare-shining courage, honourable intent, Vertuous-apparreld manhood, thoughts more rare, Mind free as heaven, imperiall government, Numbers of vertues in one sweet consent: Gyfts which the soule so highly beautifie, Humble valour, valiant humilitie. 152 Sweet ayre with Angels breath be thou refin'd, And for his sake be made more pure then ayre, And thether let some gentle breathing wind, From Paradice bring sweets which be most rare, Let Sommer sit in his imperiall chayre; And clothe sad Winter in the cheerefull prime, Keeping continuall Sommer in the clime. 153 Delight be present in thy best attire, And court his eyes with thy delightfull change, Oh warme his spirit with thy soule-feasting fire, To base delight-abusers, be thou strange, Such as in vainest pleasures boundlesse range: For pleasure he all pleasures quite forsooke, And arm'd with zeale these toiles first undertooke. 154 O let Danubius in her watry roome, Where she the name of Ister first did take, With threescore rivers swelling in her wombe, With seaven large throats her greedy thirst to slake, Doth swallow in the great worlds vastie lake: Unto all regions which doe know her name, In Roberts glory tell our countries fame. 155 And broad-brim'd Strymon as she vaulteth on, Slyding along the fertill Thracian shore, Kissing the stronds of famous Macedon, Which once the name of old Aemathia wore, Whose fame decay'd, her drops do now deplore: May raise another Orpheus with her mones, To sing his praise unto her trees and stones. 156 Time on his life, thy gathered store disburse, Which may enrich thee with eternall gaine, Which art a beldame, now become a nurse, And in his end begin his glorious raigne, That yet truth may of truth be forc'd to faine: That of his praise thy selfe a part maist be, Which praise remaines the better part of thee. 157 O thou immortall Tasso, Aestes glory, Which in thy golden booke his name hast left, Enrold in thy great Godfreis living story, Whose lines shall scape untoucht of ruins theft, Yet us of him thou hast not quite bereft: Though thy large Poems onely boast his name, Ours was his birth, and we will have his fame. 158 The curious state of greatnes he doth scorne, Carelesse of pomp to be magnificent, Deeming the noblest minded, noblest borne, Him worthiest honor, which the furthest went, His blood most pure, whose blood in wars most spent: Esteeming all fond titles, toyes of naught, Most honoring those which were with peril bought. 159 His richest roabes are his approoved Armes, His sports were deeds of peerelesse chivalrie, He flies all pleasures as the Syrens charmes, To his great mind, no pleasing harmonie, Not touch't with childish imbecillitie: As sacriledge to his religious mind, To mix base thoughts with those of heavenly kind. 160 A mind which of it selfe could rightly deeme, Keeping a straight way in one certaine course, As a true witnes of his owne esteeme, Feeding it selfe from his owne springing source, And by himselfe increasing his owne force; Desirous still him daylie to enure, To endure that, men thought none could endure. 161 Devinest touch, instinct of highest heaven, Most gracefull grace, purest of puritie, To mortall man, immortall vertue given, Manhood adorn'd with powerfull dietie, Discreetfull pitty, hallowed pietie: In secret working, by it selfe confest, In silent admiration best exprest. 162 Not spur'd with honor, dearely loving peace, Constant in any course to which he fell, A spirit which no affliction could oppresse, Never remov'd where once his thought did dwell, Opynionate, that what he did was well; Which working now upon so good a cause, Approveth his conceit the surest lawes. 163 No braggarts boast nor ostentacious word Out of his mouth is ever heard proceed, But on his foe-mans curats with his sword, In characters, records his valiant deed, That there unpartiall eyes might plainly reed; In modest silence by true vertue hid, That though he dumb, his deeds told what he did. 164 He cheres his Souldiers with sweet honied words, His princely hand embalmes the maimeds wound, Unto the needie gold he still affords, To brave attempts encouraging the sound, Never dismaid in perrill is he found; His Tent a seate of justice to the greev'd, A kingly court when need should be releev'd, 165 His life each hower to danger he doth give, Yet still by valour he with perrill strives, In all attempts as he did scorne to live, Yet lyving, as his life were many lives, Oft times from death it seemes that he revives: Each hower in great attempts he seemes to die, Yet still he lives in spight of jeopardie. 166 Even by that town o're which his Lord did weepe, Whose precious tears were shed for her own sinne, Even by that towne this zealous Lord did weepe, To see her now defil'd with others sinne, He wept, he weepes for sinne, and he for sinne, He first shed teares, he lastly sheddeth teares, Those sacred drops, the others drops endeares. 167 What prince was found within the Christian hoast That carried marke of honor in his shield, That with brave Roberts Lyons once durst boast, Raging with furie in the bloody field, Whose mighty pawes a piller seem'd to weild: Which from their nosthrils breath'd a seeming flame, When he in pride amongst the Pagans came. 168 His life with blood how dearely did he prize, And never did he brandish his bright sword, But many Pagan soules did sacrifize, And all the ground with livelesse truncks he stor'd, Such was his love unto his dearest Lord; That were true love more purer then is love, Here in this love his purenes he might prove, 169 Who from his furie latelie fled away, When in the field far off they him espied, Pursu'd in his faire presence make a stay, As of his hand they willing would have died, His beautie, so his feircenes mollified; As taking death by valiant Roberts name, Should to their lives give everlasting fame. 170 The cruell Panyms thirsting after blood, With his sweet beauty doe their hates aslake, Yet when by him in danger they have stood, And that his valour did their rage awake, And with their swords revenge wold deeply take, The edges turne as seeming to relent, To pitty him, to whom the blowes were sent. 171 At feirce assaults where thousand deaths might fall, His cheerfull smiles made death he could not kill, Imperiously his sword commaunds the wall, As stones should be obedient to his will, The yeelding blood, his blood did never spill: His fury quencht with teares as with a flood, And yet like fire consuming all that stood. 172 When in the morne his Courser he bestrid, The trumpets sound unto his thoughts gave fire, But from the field he ever dropping rid As he were vanquisht onely in retire, The neerer rest, farther from his desire: In bootie still, his Souldiers share the crowns, They rich in gold, he onely rich in wounds. 173 At his returne now in this sad retreate, From heathens slaughter, from the Christians fled, This is not he which in that raging heate, On mighty heapes laid Pagan bodies dead, Whose plumed helme empaled in his head; Mild as some Nimphlike virgin now he seem'd, Which some in fight a fearefull spirit deem'd. 174 No tryumphs doe his victories adorne, But in his death who on the Crosse had died, No lawrell nor victorious wreath is worne, But that red Crosse to tell him crucified, This death, his life, this povertie, his pride: His feast is fast, his pleasure pennaunce is, His wishes prayers, his hope is all his blisse. 175 Great Calvary whose hollow vaulted womb, In his deere Saviours death asunder riven, That rock-rent Cave, that man-god burying tomb Which was unto his blessed body given, Whose yeelding Ghost did shake the power of heaven: Here as a Hermit could he ever live, Such wondrous thoughts unto his soule they give. 176 Thus a poore Pilgrim he returnes againe, His sumptuous roabes be turn'd to Palmers gray Leaving his Lords to lead his warlick traine, Whilst he alone comes sadly on the way, Dealing abroad his deare bloods purchas'd pray: A hermits staffe his carefull hand doth hold, Whose charged Launce the heathen foe controld. 177 Most loving zeale, borne of more zealous love, Cares holy care, faiths might, joyes food, hopes kay, The ground work worlds bewitching cannot move, Of true desires the never failing stay, The cheerfull light of heavens ne're-ending day: Vertue which in thy selfe most vertuous art. The fairest gyft of the most fairest part. 178 But now to end this long continued strife, Henceforth thy malice takes no further place, Thy hate began and ended with his life, His spirit by thee can suffer no disgrace, Now in mine armes his vertues I imbrace: His body thine, his crosses witnes be, His mind is mine, and from thy power is free. 179 Thou gav'st up rule, when he gave up his breath, And at his end, then did I first begin, Thy hate was buried in his timelesse death, Thou going out, first did I enter in, Thou loosing him, thy losse then did I win: And when the Fates did up their right resigne, Thy right, his wrong, thy hate, his hap was mine. 180 To the unworthie world then get thee back, Stuft with deceits and fawning flatteries, There by thy power bring all things unto wrack, And fill the times with fearefull Tragedies: And since thy joy consists in miseries, Heare his complaint, who wanting eyes to see, May give thee sight, which art as blind as hee. 181 At her great words whilst they in silence stand, Poore haplesse Robert now remembring him, Holding one bloody eye in his pale hand, With countenance all dead, and gastly grim, As in a feaver shaking every lim; Even with a pitteous lamentable grone, Vailing his head, thus breakes into his mone. 182 Poore teare, dim'd taper which hast lost thy brother And thus art left to twinkle here alone, Ah might'st thou not have perrisht with the other, And both together to your set have gone, You both were one, one wanting, thou not one, Poore twins which like true friends one watch did keepe, Why sever'd thus that so you shold not sleepe. 183 And thou pore eye, oh why sholdst thou have light, The others black eclipse thus soone to see, And yet thy fellow be depriv'd of sight, For thy sad teares the while to pitty thee, Equall your griefes, your haps unequall be: Take thou his darknes, and thy sorrow hide, Or he thy light, his griefe so well espied. 184 Let that small drop out of thy juicie ball, Canded like gum upon the moist'ned thrid, There still be fixed that it never fall, But as a signe hang on thine eyes staind lid, A witnes there what inward griefe is hid: Like burning glasses fired by the Sunne, Light all mens eyes to see what there is done. 185 Now like to conduits draw my body drie, By which is made the entrance to my blood, Streame-gushing sluces plac'd in eyther eye, Which shalbe fed by this continuall flood, Whirlpooles of tears where pleasures citty stood, Devouring gulfes within a vastie land, Or like the dead Sea, ever hatefull stand. 186 Where stood the watch-towers of my cheerful face, Like Vestall Lamps lighted with holy flame, Is now a dungeon and a lothed place, The darksome prison of my hatefull shame, That they themselves doe most abhor the same: Through whose foule grates, griefe full of miserie, Still begging vengeance, ceaseth not to crie. 187 With dire-full seales, death hath shut up the dores, Where he hath taken up his dreadfull Inne, In bloody letters shewing those fell sores, That now doe raigne, wher joy &amp; mirth have beene, This mortal plague the just scourge of their sinne: From whose contagion comfort quite is fled, And they themselves, in their selves buried. 188 Poore tears, sith eyes your small drops cannot see, And since the Fountains cease of my full eyes, Teares get you eyes and help to pitty mee, And water them which timelesse sorrow dryes, Teares give me teares, lend eyes unto my eyes: So may the blind yet make the blind to see, Else no help is to them, nor hope to mee, 189 Body and eyes usurping others right, Both altring use contrarie unto kind, That eyes to eyes those dark which shold give light, The blind both guide, &amp; guided by the blind, Yet both must be directed by the mind: Yet that which both their trustie guide should be, Blinded with care, like them can nothing see. 190 The day abhors thee, and from thee doth flie, Night followes after, yet behind doth stay, This never comes, though it be ever nie, This ere it comes is vanished away, Nor night, nor day, though ever night and day: Yet all is one, still day or ever night. No rest in darknes, nor no joy in light. 191 Whilst light did give me comfort to my mone, Teares found a meane to sound my sorrows deepe, But now alasse that comfort being gone, Tears do want eies which shold give tears to weepe, Whence I lost joy there care I ever keepe: What gave me woe from me doth comfort take, Delight a sleepe, now sorrow still must wake. 192 I saw my ill, when ill could scarclie see, I saw my good, when I my good scarce knew, Now see not ill, when as my ill sees mee, Hasting to that which still doth mee pursue, With my lost eyes, sorrow my state doth view, In blindnes loosing hope of all delight, And with my blindnes, give my cares full sight. 193 As man himselfe, so the most hatefull beast, The Worme enjoyes the ayre as well as wee, The little Gnat, or thing that lives the least, Of this by nature kindly is made free: What thing hath mouth to brethe, but eyes to see? Though honor lost, yet might I humbly crave, To have what beasts, or flies, or pore worms have. 194 Mine eyes hurt not the Sun, nor steale the day, Except a candle, they see never light, These monstrous walls do take that doubt away, What? feare you then that they shold harme the night? Needles is that, sith tears have blotted sight. I know not then from whence this hate should rise, Except it onely be, that they be eyes. 195 The man-betraying Basilisk hath eyes, Although by sight those eyes be made to kill, Though her owne works be made her enemies, Though naturally ordained unto ill, Yet in her selfe so just is nature still: How monstrous then am I alone in nature, Denide of that she gives the vilest creature? 196 Oh tyrannie more cruell far then death, Though death be but the end of tyranie, Death lends us sight whilst she doth give us breath, Of all the sences that the last doth dye, In lyving death, how miserable am I, In life, of this sence me thus to deprive, To make the others dye, my selfe alive. 197 Eyes which with joy like Sunnes have risen oft, To view that holy Citties glorious Towers, And seene the Christian Ensignes raisd aloft, Crowning the walls like garlands of rare flowers, Now lie you perrisht in your Ivory bowers, Nor shal you henceforth boast what you have been But leave the minde to thinke what you have seen. 198 You, which have seene faire Palestine restor'd, And gorgeous Syon from the Paynims freed, The Sepulcher of your most glorious Lord, And that faire Mount wher his sweet wounds did bleed And with these sights my hungry soule did feed, Within your brincks be drownd in your own blood Which oft have view'd great Jordans sacred flood. 199 Rake up the sparks which nourished your fire, Within the ashes of consumed eyes, Those little brands which kindled youths desire, The haples starrs of passed miseries, Wander no more within your circling skies; Under the Globes great compasse ever roule, And in my minds great world, now light my soule. 200 Good night sweet Sunns, your lights are cleane put out, Your hollow pits be graves of all your joy, With dreadfull darknes compassed about, Wherein is cast what murther can destroy, That buried there, which did the world annoy, Those holy Fanes where vertue hallowed stood, Become a place of slaughter and of blood. 201 Poure downe your last refreshing evening dew, And bathe your selves in fountains of your tears, The day no more shall ever breake to you, The joyfull dawne no more at all appears, No cheerfull sight your sorrow ever cheers: Shut up your windows ere constraint compell, Be-take your selves to nights eternall Cell. 202 His passion ending, Fortune discontent, Turning her back as shee away would flie, Playing with fooles and babes incontinent, As never toucht with humane misery, Even after death shewing inconstancy, As straight forgetting what she had to tell, To other speech and girlish laughter fell. 203 When graceful Fame, convaying thence her charge, With all these troupes attended royallie, Gave me this booke, wherein was writ at large, Great Norman Roberts famous history, T'amaze the world with his sad Tragedy: But Fortune angry with her foe therefore, Gave me this gift, That I should still be poore. FINIS. Mortimeriados. THE LAMENTABLE ciuell warres of Edward the second and the Barrons. TO THE EXCELLENT AND most accomplish'd Ladie, Lucie Countesse of Bedford. Rarest of Ladies, all, of all I have, Anchor of my poore Tempest-beaten state, Which givest life, to that life Nature gave, And to thy selfe, doest onely consecrate: My hopes true Goddesse, guider of my fate, Vouchsafe to grace what here to light is brought, Begot by thy sweet hand, borne of my thought. And though I sing of this tumultuous rage, Still paynting passions in these Tragedies, Thy milder lookes, this furie can aswage, Such is the vertue of thy sacred eyes, Which doe contayne a thousand purities; And lyke them selves, can make their object such, As doth Th'elixar all things it doth tuch. Sweet fruite, sprong from that ever sacred tree, That happie wombe from whom thou lyfe do'st take, And with that lyfe, gives vertue unto thee, Thus made of her, her lyke of thee to make, Shee lov'd for thee, thou honour'd for her sake; And eithers good, from other so derived, Yet shee, nor thou, of any due deprived. The Harringtons, whose house thy byrth hath blest, Adding such honour to theyr familie, And famous Bedfords greatnes still increast, Raysing the height of theyr Nobilitie, That Earledomes tytle more to dignifie; That Vertue lyvely pictur'd forth in thee, May truly be discernd, what shee should be. And Lawrell-crowned Sidney, Natures pride, Whom heaven to earth, but onely shew'd this good, Betwixt the world, and thee did then devide, His fame, and vertues, which both equall stood, The world his fame, to thee of her owne blood Hee gave his vertues, that in his owne kind, His never-matched worth might be enshrin'd. That whilst they boast but of their sun-burnt brayns, Which Tramontani long have termd us so, With all their Po's, their Tyburs, and their Rheyn's, Greeving to see how tidefull Thames shall flowe, Our Groves which for the gracefull Muses growe: Thy name shall be the glorie of the North, The fayrest fruit that ever shee brought forth. And in despight of tyranizing times, This hope great Lady yet to thee is left, Thy name shall lyve in steele-out-during rimes, Still scorning ages sacraligious theft, What fame doth keepe, can never be bereft: Nor can thy past-priz'd honour ever die, If lynes can gyve thee immortalitie. Leaving unto succeeding times to see, How much thy sacred gyfts I did adore, What power thy vertues ever had in mee, And what thou wert compar'd with those before, Which shall in age, thy youth againe restore: And still shall ad more vigor to thy fame, Then earthly honors, or a Countesse name. Proclayming unto ages yet to come, Whilst Bedford lyv'd, what lyving Bedford was, Enclosing thee in this immortall toombe, More durable then letter-graven brasse, To shewe what thy great power could bring to passe, And other hopes I utterly refuse, And thou my hope, my Lady, and my Muse. Your Honors ever devoted servaunt Michaell Drayton. TO THE RIGHT HONORABLE LADY, Lucie Countesse of Bedford. When God this wondrous Creature did create, This ever-moving body, this huge weight, Whose head, whose lofty head high situate, Is crown'd with starrs &amp; constellations bright. Hee causd the same one certaine way to move, Which mooving (some say) doth sweet tunes beget, Another way the Sunne and Planets prove, For they from thence move where the sun doth set; Yet he the Pole-star, Cynosura cleere, Causd steddily to stand, though heaven did gyre, For an example to mens actions heere: Madam, you are the starre of his desire; Whilst hee his thoughts heaven moves, ô gracious bee, And wonders in your Creature you shall see. Your honors and eternities Humble, E. B. MORTIMERIADOS. The lowring heaven had mask'd her in a clowde, Dropping sad teares upon the sullen earth, Bemoning in her melancholly shrowde, The angry starres which raign'd at Edwards birth, With whose beginning ended all our mirth. Edward the second, but the first of shame, Scourge of the crowne, eclipse of Englands fame. Whilst in our blood, ambition hotely boyles, The Land bewailes her, like a wofull Mother, On every side besieg'd with civill broyles, Her deerest chyldren murthering one another, Yet shee in silence forc'd her griefe to smother: Groning with paine, in travaile with her woes, And in her torment, none to helpe her throwes. What care would plot, discention strives to crosse, Which like an earthquake rents the tottering state; Abroade in warres we suffer publique losse, At home, betrayd with grudge and private hate, Faction attending blood-shed and debate; Confusion thus our Countries peace confounds, No helpe at hand, and mortall be her wounds. Thou Church then swelling in thy mightines, Thou which should'st be this poore sick bodyes soule, O nurse not factions which should'st sinne suppresse, And with thy members should'st all griefe condole, Perswade thy hart and not thy head controle; Humble thy selfe, dispence not with the word, Take Peters keyes, but cast aside his sword. The ragefull fire which burnt Carnarvans brest, Blowne with revenge of Gavestons disgrace, Awakes the Barrons from their nightly rest, And maketh way to give the Spensers place, Whose friendship Edward onely doth embrace; By whose alurements he is fondly led, To leave his Queene, and flie his lawful bed. This Planet stirr'd up that tempestious blast By which our fortunes Anchorage was torne, The storme where-with our spring was first defac'd, Whereby all hope unto the ground was borne: Hence came the griefe, the teares, the cause to mourne. This bred the blemish which her beauty staind, Whose ugly scarr's, to after-times remaind. In all this heat his greatnes first began, The serious subject of my sadder vaine, Great Mortimer, the wonder of a man, Whose fortunes heere my Muse must entertaine, And from the grave his griefes must yet complaine, To shew our vice nor vertues never die, Though under ground a thousand yeeres we lie. Thys gust first threw him on that blessed Coast Which never age discovered before: This luckie chaunce drew all King Edward lost, This shypwrack cast the prize upon his shore, And thys all-drowning Deluge gave him more; From hence the sunne of his good fortune shone, The fatall step, to Edwards fatall throne. Roger Mortimer the unckle, and Roger Mortimer the nephew.That unckle now, whose name this Nephew bare, The onely comfort of the wofull Queene, And from his cradle held him as his care, And still the hope of all his house had beene, Whilst yet this deep hart-goring wound is greene, On this well-seene advantage wisely wrought, To place him highly in her princely thought. He saw his inclination from his birth, A mighty spirit, a minde which did aspire; Not of the drossy substance of the earth, But of the purest element of fire, Which sympathizing with his owne desire, Name, nature, feature, all did so agree, That still in him, himselfe he still might see. The temper of his nobler mooving part, Had that true tutch which purified his blood, Infusing thoughts of honor in his hart, Whose flaggie feathers were not soyld in mud, The edge he bare declar'd the mettall good; The towring pitch wherein he flew for fame, Declar'd the ayrie whence the Eagle came. Worthy the Grand-chyld of so great a sier, Roger Mortimer his Grand-father, who kept the round table at Kenelworth. Brave Mortimer who liv'd whilst Long-shanks raign'd, Our second Arthur, whom all times admire, At Kenelworth the Table round ordayn'd, And there in Armes, a hundreth Knights maintaind; A hundreth gallant Ladies in his Court, Whose stately presence royaliz'd this sport. And whilst this poore wife-widdowed Queene alone, In thys dispayring passion pines away, Beyond all hope, to all but heaven unknowne, A little sparke which yet in secrete lay, Breakes forth in flame, and turnes her night to day, The wofull winter of her sorrowes cheering, Even as the world at the faire Sunnes appearing. Yet still perplexed in these hard extreames, All meanes deprest which might her faith prefer, Blacke foggs oppos'd in those cleere-shining beames, Which else might lend their friendly light to her, This in her lookes direfull revenge doth stir: Which strange eclipse plac'd in this irefull signe, Our Countries plague and ruine might divine. Her snowy curled brow makes anger smile, Her laughing frowne gives beauty better grace, Blushing disdaine, disdaine doth quite exile, Sweet love and silence wrestling in her face, Two capering Cupids in her eyes do chase; Her veynes like tydes oft swelling with delight, Making Vermilion faire, white more then white. Her beauty florish'd whilst her favours fade, Her hopes growne old, but her desires be yong, Her power wants power her passion to perswade, Her sexe is weake, her will is over-strong, Patience pleades pitty, but revenge her wrong; What reason urgeth, rage doth still denie, With arguments of wrathfull jealousie. Pale Jealousie, child of insatiate love, Of hart-sick thoughts with melancholie bred, A hell tormenting feare no faith can move, By discontent with deadly poyson fed, With heedlesse youth and error vainely led, A mortall plague, a vertue-drowning flood, A hellish fire, not quenched but with blood. The hate-swolne Lords with furie set on fire, Whom Edwards wrongs to vengeance doe provoke, With Lancaster and Herford now conspire, No more to beare the Spensers servile yoke, The bonds of their alegiance they have broke: Resolv'd with blood theyr libertie to buy, To live with honor, or with fame to dye. Amid thys faction Mortimer doth enter, The gastly Prologue to thys tragick act: His youth and courage boldly bids him venter, And tells him still how strongly he was backt: Synon perswades howe Illion might be sackt; The people still applauding in his eares, The fame and credite of the Mortimers. Thys vapor-kindled Commet drew her eyes, Which now began his streamie flagge to reare; This beauty-blushing orient of his rise, Her clowdy frownes doth with his brightnes cleare, The joyfull'st sight that ever did appeare; The messenger of light, her happy starre, Which told her now the dawning was not farre. As after pale-fac'd Night, the Morning fayre The burning Lampe of heaven doth once erect, With her sweet Crimson sanguining the ayre, On every side with streakie dappl's fleckt, The circled roofe in white and Azure deckt, Such colour to her cheekes these newes do bring, Which in her face doth make a second spring. Yet trembling at the Spensers Lordly power, Their wrongs, oppression, and controling pride, Th'unconstant Barrons, wavering every houre, The fierce encounter of this raging tyde, No stratagem yet strongly policied; Shee from suspition seemingly retyers, Carelesse in shew of what she most desires. Grounded advice, in danger seldom trips, The deadliest poyson, skill can safely drinke, Fore-sight stands fast, where giddy rashnes slips, Wisdome seemes blinde, when eyed as a Linxe, Prevention speaketh all but what he thinks; The deadliest hate, with smyles securely stands, Revenge in teares doth ever wash his hands. Loe for her safetie this shee must desemble, A benefite which women have by kind, The neerest colour finely to resemble, Suppressing thus the greatnes of her mind, Now is shee shrowded closely under wind, And at her prayers (poore soule) shee plainly ment, A silly Queene, a harmelesse innocent. The least suspition cunningly to heale, Still in her lookes humilitie shee beares, With patience she with mightines must deale, So policie religions habite weares, He's mad which takes a Lyon by the eares. This knew the Queene, and this well know the wise, This must they learne, which toyle in Monarchies. Adam Torlton Bishop of Herford, a mighty polititian. Torlton the learnedst Prelate in the Land, Upon a text of politicks to preach, Car'd not on Paules preciser poynts to stand, Poore Moralls to beleeving men to teach, For he at Kingdomes had a further reach: This learned Tutor, Isabell had taught, In nicer poynts then ever Edward sought. Now in meane time, the smothered flame brake forth, The Mortimers march from the westerne playne, The Lords in armes at Pomfret in the North, The King from London, comes with might and mayne, Their factious followers in the streetes are slayne. No other thing is to be hop'd upon, But horrour, death, and desolation. Like as Sabrina from the Ocean flancks, Comes sweeping in along the tawny sands, And with her billowes tilting on the bancks, Rowles in her flood upon the westerne strands, Stretching her watrie armes along the lands, With such great furie doe these legions ryse, Filling the shores with lamentable cryes. Thus of three hands, they all set up theyr rest, And at the stake their lives they franckly lay, Hee's like to winne who cuts his dealing best, And for a Kingdome at the least they play, The fayr'st in show must carrie all away; And though the King himselfe in sequence came, He sawe the Queene lay right to make his game. But Fortune masking in this straunge disguise, Whose prodigie, whose monster he was borne, Now in his lyfe her power, t'anotomize, Ordayning him her darling and her scorne, His Tragedie her triumph to adorne. Shee straight begins to bandy him about, At thousand ods before the set goes out. As when we see the spring-begetting Sunne, In heavens black night-gowne covered from our sight, And when he yet, but fewe degrees hath runne, Some fennie fogge damps up his gladsome light, That at his noon-sted he may shine more bright. His cheerefull morning Fortune cloudeth thus, To make his day more fayre, more glorious. Edward whom daunger warnd to dread the worst, Unto the hart with poysned ranckor stung, Now for his crowne must scuffle if he durst, Or else his scepter in the dust were flung, To stop the head from which these mischiefes sprung. First with the Marchers thinks it fit to cope, On whom he knew lay all the Barrons hope. Like to a whirle-wind comes this irefull King, Whose presence soone the Welchmens power had staid, The Cornish yet theyr forces fayld to bring, And Lancaster too slacke forslow'd theyr ayd, Faynt-harted friends, their succours long delayd. Depriv'd of meanes, forlorne of farther good, And wanting strength to stem so great a flood. They who perceiv'd, their trust was thus betrayd, Their long expected purpose thus to quayle, How mischiefe still upon their fortune playd, That they perforce their high-borne top must vayle, This storme still blew so stifly on their sayle. Of Edwards mercy now the depth must sound, Where yet their Ankor might take hold on ground. This tooke the King in presage of his good, Who this event to his successe apply'd, Which coold the furie of his boyling blood, Before their force in armes he yet had try'd, His sterne approch this easely molified That on submission he dismist theyr power, And sends them both as prisoners to the Tower. Not cowardize but wisedome warnes to yield, When Fortune aydes the proud insulting foe, Before dishonour ever blot the field; Where by advantage hopes agayne may growe, When as too weake to beare so great a blowe: That whilst his pittie pardons them to live, To his owne wrongs he full revenge might give. Loe now my Muse must sing of dreadfull Armes, And taske her selfe to tell of civill warres, Of Ambuscados, stratagems, alarmes, Of murther, slaughter, monstrous Massacarres, Of blood, of wounds, of never-healed scarres, Of battailes fought by brother against brother, The Sonne and Father one against the other. O thou great Lady, Mistris of my Muse, Renowned Lucie, vertues truest frend, Which doest a spyrit into my spyrit infuse, And from thy beames the light I have dost lend, Into my verse thy lyving power extend. O breathe new lyfe to write this Tragicke storie, Assist me now brave Bedford for thy glorie. Whilst in the Tower the Mortimers are mew'd, The Barrons drew their forces to a head, Whom Edward (spurd with vengeance) still pursu'd By Lancaster and famous Herford led, Toward eithers force, forth-with both Armies sped. Burton upon Trent.At Burton both in camping for the day, Where they must trye who beares the spurres away. Upon the East from bushie Needwoods side, There riseth up an easie clyming hill, At whose fayre foote the silver Trent doth slide, Needwood. And all the shores with ratling murmure fill, Whose tumbling waves the flowrie Meadowes swill, Upon whose streame a Bridge of wondrous strength, Doth stretch her selfe, neere fortie Arches length. Upon this mount the King his Tents hath fixt, And in the Towne the Barrons lye in sight, This famous Ryver risen so betwixt, Whose furie yet prolong'd this deadly fight, The passage stopp'd, not to be wonne by might. Things which presage both good and ill there bee, Which heaven fore-shewes, yet will not let us see. The raging flood hath drownd up all her foards, Sok'd in excesse of cloud-congealed teares, And steepes the bancks within her watrie hoards, Supping the whir-pooles from the quaggie mears, Now doth shee washe her tressed rushie hayrs. Swolne with the dropsie in her grieved woombe, That this her channell must become a Toombe. O warlike Nation hold thy conquering hand, Even sencelesse things doe warne thee yet to pawse, Thy Mother soyle on whom thy feete doe stand, O then infrindge not Natures sacred lawes, Still runne not headlong into mischiefes jawes: Yet stay thy foote in murthers ugly gate, Ill comes too soone, repentance oft too late. And can the cloudes weepe over thy decay, Yet not one drop fall from thy droughtie eyes? Seest thou the snare yet wilt not shunne the way, Nor yet be warn'd, by passed miseries? Or ere too late, yet learne once to be wise. A mischiefe seene, may easely be prevented, But beeing hap'd, not help'd, yet still lamented. Behold the Eagles, Lyons, Talbots, Bears, The Badges of your famous ancestries, And shall they now by their inglorious heyrs: Be thus displayd against their families? Reliques unworthie of theyr progenies. Those Beastes you beare doe in their kinds agree And then those Beasts more savage will you bee? Cannot the Scot of your late slaughter boast? And are you yet scarce healed of the sore? Is't not inough you have already lost, But your owne madnes now must make it more? Your Wives and Children pittied you before. But when your own blood, your own swords imbrue, Who pitties them, which once have pittied you? What, shall the Sister weepe her Brothers death, Who sent her Husband to his timelesse grave? The Nephewe moane his Unckles losse of breath, Which did his Father of his lyfe deprave? Who shall have mind your memories to save? Or shall he buriall to his friend afford, Who lately put his Sonne unto the sword? But whilst the King, and Lords in counsell sit, Yet in conclusion variably doe hover, See how misfortune still her time can fit: Such as were sent the Country to discover, Have found a way to land their forces over. Ill newes hath wings, and with the winde doth goe, Comfort's a Cripple, and comes ever slow. And Edward fearing Lancasters supplyes, Great Surry, Richmond, and his Pembrooke sent, On whose successe his chiefest hope relyes, Under whose conduct halfe his Armie went, And he himselfe, and Edmond Earle of Kent, Upon the hill in sight of Burton lay, Watching to take advantage of the day. Stay Surry stay, thou maist too soone begon; Stay till this rage be some-what over-past, Why runn'st thou thus to thy destruction? Pembrooke and Richmond, whether doe you hast? Never seeke sorrow, for it comes too fast. Why strive you thus to passe this fatall flood, To fetch new wounds, and shed your neerest blood? Great Lancaster, sheath up thy conquering sword, On Edwards Armes, whose edge thou should'st not whet, Thy naturall Nephew, and thy soveraigne Lord, Both one, one blood, and both Plantaginet. Canst thou thy oth to Longshanks thus forget? Yet call to minde, before all other things, Our vowes must be perform'd to Gods and Kings. Knowe, noble Lord, it better is to end, Then to proceed in things rashly begun: Which oft ill counseld worser doe offend, Speech hath obtaind, where weapons have not won; By good perswasion what cannot be done? And when all other hopes and helps be past, Then fall to Armes, but let that be the last. The winds are husht, no little breth doth blow, The calmed ayre as all amazed stood, The earth with roring trembleth below, The Sunne besmear'd his glorious face in blood, The fearfull Heards bellowing as they were wood: The Drums and Trumpets give a signall sound, With such a noyse as they had torne the ground. The Earles now charging with three hundred horse, The Kings vantgard assay the Bridge to win, Forcing the Barrons to devide their force, T'avoyde the present danger they were in: Never till now the horror doth begin; That if th'elements our succour had not sought, All had that day beene to confusion brought. Now from the hill the Kings maine power comes downe, Which had Aquarius to their valiant guide, Aquary a notable souldier.Brave Lancaster and Herford from the towne, Doe issue forth upon the other side: The one assailes, the other munified. Englands Red crosse upon both sides doth flye, Saint George the King, Saint George the Barrons cry. Even as a bustling tempests rouzing blasts, Upon a Forrest of old-branched Oakes, Downe upon heapes their climing bodies casts, And with his furie teyrs their mossy loaks, The neighbour groves resounding with the stroaks, With such a clamor and confused woe, To get the Bridge these desperate Armies goe. Now must our famous and victorious bowes, With which our Nation Kingdoms did subdue, First send their darting arrowes against those Whose sinewed armes against their foes them drew; These winged weapons, mourning as they flew, Cleave to the strings, with very terror slack, As to the Archers they would faine turne back. The battered Caskes, with Battel-Axes strokes, Besnow the soyle with drifts of scattered plumes, The trampling presse stirre up such duskie smokes Which choke the ayre with reekie smothering fumes, Which rising up, into a clowde consumes; As though the heaven had muffled her in black, Lothing to see this lamentable sack. Behold the remnant of Troyes famous stocke, Laying on blowes as Smithes on Anviles strike, Grappling together in this fearfull shock, The like presse forth, t'incounter with the like, And then reculing to the push of pyke: Yet not a foote doth eyther give to eyther, Now one the ods, then both alike, then neither. Even as you see a field of standing Corne, When in faire June some easie gale doth blow, How up and downe the spyring eares are borne, And with the blasts like Billowes come and goe, As golden streamers waving to and fro, Thus on the suddaine runne they on amaine, Then straight by force are driven backe againe. Heer lyes a heap, halfe slaine, halfe chok'd, halfe drownd, Gasping for breth amongst the slymie seggs, And there a sort falne in a deadly swound, Scrawling in blood upon the muddy dreggs: Heere in the streame, swim bowels, armes and leggs. One kills his foe, his braine another cuts, Ones feet intangled in anothers guts. One his owne hands in his owne blood defiles, Another from the Bridges height doth fall, Some dash'd to death upon the stony pyles, Some in theyr gore upon the pavement sprall, The carkasses lye heaped like a wall: Such hideous shreeks the bedlam Souldiers breath, As though the Spirits had howled from beneath. The mangled bodies diving in the streame, Now up, now downe, like tumbling Porpose swim, The water cover'd with a bloody creame, To the beholder horrible and grim: Heere lies a head, and there doth lye a lym; Which in the sands the swelling waters souse, That all the shores seeme like a slaughter-house. It seem'd the very wounds for griefe did weepe, To feele the temper of the slicing blade, The sencelesse steele in blood it selfe did sleepe, To see the wounds his sharpe-ground edge had made, Whilst kinsman, kinsman, friend, doth friend invade, Such is the horror of these civill broyles, When with our blood, we fat our native soyles. This faction still defying Edwards might, Edmond of Woodstock, famous Earle of Kent, Charging the foe againe renewes the fight, Upon the Barrons forces almost spent, Who now againe supplying succours sent. And now a second conflict doth begin, The English Lords like Tygars flying in. Like as an exhalation hote and dry, Amongst the ayre-bred moystie vapors throwne, Spetteth his lightning forth outragiously, Renting the thick clowdes with a thunder-stone, As though the huge all-covering heaven did grone, Such is the garboyle of this conflict then, Brave Englishmen, encountring Englishmen. Even as proude Pyrrhus entring Illion, Couragious Talbot with his shield him bare, Clifford and Moubray, seconding anon, Audley and Gifford thrunging for their share, Elmbridge and Balsmer in the thickest are: Pell-mell together flyes this furious power, Like to the falling of some mighty Tower. Mountfort and Teis, your worths faine would I speake, But that your valure can but ill deserve, Brave Denvile, heere I from thy prayse must breake, And from thy prayses Willington must swarve, Great Damory, heere must thy glory starve; Concealing many, most deserving blame, Because their acts doe quench my sacred flame. O that those Armes in conquests had been borne, And that, that battered fame-engraven shield, Should in those civill massacres be torne Which bare the marks of many a bloody field: O that our armes had power their Armes to weeld. That since that time, the stones for very dreed, Against foule stormes could teary moisture sheed. O had you shap'd your valures first by them Who summon'd Akon with an English drum, Or marched on to faire Jerusalem, T'inlarge the bounds of famous Christendome, Or with Christs warriors slept about his toombe, Then ages had immortaliz'd your fame, Where now my song can be but of your shame. Death following on, feare ever in their eyes, Grieved with wounds, the conquered Barrons fled, And now the King enrich'd with victories, Hath in the field his glorious Ensignes spred, This in his thoughts againe fresh courage bred, And somwhat drawes th'unconstant peoples harts, Who equall peyz'd, yet way'd to neither parts. And wanting ground, they unresolved are, King Edwards friends, agaynst the rebels cry, The Barrons plead their Countries onely care, Exclayming on the Princes tyrannie, Hee urg'd obedience, they their libertie. Both under colour, carefull of the state, Hee right, and they their wrongs expostulate. Some fewe them selves in Sanctuaries hide, In mercie of the priviledged place, Yet are their bodyes so unsanctifide, As scarce their soules can ever hope for grace, A poore dead lyfe, this draweth out a space. Hate stands without, and horror sits within, Prolonging shame, yet pard'ning not their sinne. At fatall Pomfret gathering head at length, When they of all extreamities had tasted, Where yet before they could recover strength, King Edward followeth whilst his fortune lasted, Unto whose ayde the Earle of Carlell hasted. With troupes of bow-men and ranck-riding bands, Of Westmer, Cumber, and Northumberlands. Mad and amaz'd, nor knowing what to doe, Surpriz'd by this late mischievous event, Seeing at hand their utter overthrowe, And in despight how crossely all things went, Fortune her selfe to their destruction bent; In all disorder head-long on they runne, To end with blood, what was with blood begunne. Lyke as a heard of silly hartlesse Deare, Whom hote-spurd Huntsmen fiercely doe pursue, In brakes and bushes falling heere and there, Yet when no way the hounds they can eschew, Now flying back from whence of late they flew, Hem'd on each side with hornes rechating blast, Head-long them selves into the toyles doe cast. To Borough bridge by fate appoynted thus, Where lyke false Raynard, falser Herckley lay, Bridges to Barrons ever ominous, There to renewe this latest deadly fray, O heere begins the blackest dismall day, The birth of horror, hower of wrath that yet, The very soyle seemes to remember it. Heere is not Death contented with the dead, Nor vengeance is with vengeance satisfied, Blood-shed by blood-shed still is nourished, And mischiefe meanes no more her store to hide, Strange sorts of torments heaven doth now provide, That dead men should in miserie remayne, And in the lyving, death should dye with payne. Thus rules the world, a world why saye I so, Worst is the world, yet worser must I name it, Nights ugli'st night, hells bitter'st hell of woe, So ill as slaunder never can defame it, That shame her selfe is sham'd, seeking to shame it, Could envie speake, what envie can expresse, In saying most, that most should make it lesse. Heere noble Herford, Bohun breathes his last, Crowne of true Knight-hood, flower of Chivalrie, But Lancaster their torment lives to tast, Bohun slaine at Borogh. Who perrish now with endlesse obloquie, O vanquisht conquest, loosing victorie, That where the sword for pittie leaves to spill, There extreame justice should begin to kill. O subject for some tragick Muse to sing, Of five great Earledomes at one time possest, Sonne, Unckle, Brother, Grandchild to a King, With favours, friends, and earthly honours blest, Thomas the great Earle of Lancaster. But see on earth, heere is no place of rest. These Fortunes gyfts, and she to shew her power, Takes lyfe, and these, and all within an hower. The wretched Mother tearing of her hayre, Bewayles the time this fatall warre begunne, Lyke grave-borne gosts, amaz'd and mad with feare, To view the quartered carkasse of her Sonne, With hideous shreeks through streetes &amp; wayes doth runne. And seeing none to help, none heare her crye, Some drownd, some stabd, some starvd, some strangled die. Lyke gastly death the aged Father stands, Weeping his Sonne, bemoning of his wife, Shee murthered by her owne blood-guiltie hands, Hee slaughtered by the executioners knife, Sadly sits downe to ende his hatefull life; Banning the earth, and cursing at the ayre, Upon his poyniard falleth in dispayre. The wofull widdowe for her Lord distrest, Whose breathlesse body cold death doth benum, Her little Infant leaning on her breast, Rings in her eares, when will my Father come? Doth wish that she were deafe, or it were dombe. Clipping each other, weeping both togeather, Shee for her Lord, the poore babe for his Father. The ayre is poysned with the dampie stinck, Which most contagious pestilence doth breed, The glutted earth her fill of gore doth drinck, Which from unburied bodies doth proceede, Ravens and dogs on dead men onely feede; In every Coast thus doe our eyes behold, Our sinnes by judgement of the heavens controld. Lyke as a Wolfe returning from the foyle, Having full stuft his flesh-engorged panch, Tumbles him downe to wallowe in the soyle, With cooling breath his boyling mawe to stanch, Scarce able now to moove his lustlesse hanch. Thus after slaughter Edward breathlesse stood, As though his sword had surfeted with blood. Heere endeth life, yet heere death cannot end, And heere begins, what Edwards woes begun, Nor his pretence, falls as he doth pretend, Nor hath he wone, what he by battell wone, All is not done, though almost all undone, Whilst power hath raign'd, still policie did lurke, Seldome doth mallice want a meane to worke. The King now by the conquering Lords consent, Who by this happie victorie grew strong, Summons at Yorke a present Parliament, To plant his right, and helpe the Spensers wrong, From whence agayne his minions greatnes sprung, Whose counsell still, in all their actions crost, Th'inraged Queene whom all misfortunes tost. But miseries which seldome come alone, Thicke in the necks one of another fell, Meane while the Scots heere make invasion, And Charles of France doth thence our powers expell, The grieved Commons more and more rebell. Mischiefe on mischiefe, curse doth followe curse, Plague after plague, and worse ensueth worse. For Mortimer this wind yet rightly blewe, Darckning their eyes which else perhaps might see, Whilst Isabell who all advantage knewe, Is closely plotting his deliverie, Now fitly drawne by Torltons policie: Thus by a Queene, a Bishop, and a Knight, To check a King, in spight of all dispight. A drowsie potion shee by skill hath made, Whose secret working had such wonderous power, As could the sence with heavie sleepe invade, And mortifie the patient in one hower, As though pale death the body did devower; Nor for two dayes might opened be his eyes, By all meanes Arte or Phisicke could devise. Thus sits this great Enchauntresse in her Cell, Invironed with spyrit-commaunding charmes, Her body censed with most sacred smell, With holy fiers her liquors now shee warmes, Then her with sorcering instruments she armes. And from her hearbs the powerfull juyce she wrong, To make the poyson forcible and strong. Reason might judge, doubts better might advise, And as a woman, feare her hand have stayd, Waying the strangenesse of the interprize, The daunger well might have her sex dismayd, Fortune, distrust, suspect, to be betrayd; But when they leave of vertue to esteeme, They greatly erre which thinke them as they seeme. Their plighted fayth, when as they list they leave, Their love is cold, their lust, hote, hote their hate, With smiles and teares these Serpents doe deceave, In their desires they be insatiate, Their will no bound, and their revenge no date. All feare exempt, where they at ruine ayme, Covering their sinne with their discovered shame. Medea pittifull in tender yeares, Untill with Jason she would take her flight, Then mercilesse her Brothers lymmes she teares, Betrayes her Father, flyes away by night, Nor Nations, Seas, nor daungers could affright; Who dyed with heate, nor could abide the wind, Now like a Tigar falls unto her kind. Now waits the Queene fitt'st time, as might behove, Their ghostly Father for their speed must pray, Their servants seale these secrets up with love, Their friends must be the meane, the guide, the way, And he resolve on whom the burthen lay; This is the summe, the all, if this neglected, Never againe were meane to be expected. Thus, while hee liv'd a prysoner in the Towre, The Keepers oft with feasts he entertaind, Which as a stale, serves fitly at this howre, The tempting bayte wher-with his hookes were traind, A stately banquet now he had ordaind, And after cates when they their thirst should quench, He sawc'd their wine with thys approoved drench. And thus become the keeper of the kayes, In steele-bound locks he safely lodg'd the Guard: Then lurking forth by the most secret wayes, Not now to learne his compasse by the Card, With corded ladders which hee had prepard, Now up these proude aspyring walls doth goe, Which seeme to scorne they should be mastred so. They soundly sleepe, now must his wits awake, A second Theseus through a hells extreames, The sonne of Jove, new toyles must undertake, Of walls, of gates, of watches, woods, and streames, And let them tell King Edward of their dreames: For ere they wak'd out of this brainsick traunce, He hopes to tell thys noble jest in Fraunce. The sullen night in mistie rugge is wrapp'd, Powting the day had tarryed up so long, The Evening in her darksome dungion clapp'd, And in that place the swarty clowdes were hong, Downe from the West the half-fac'd Cynthia flong, As shee had posted forth to tell the Sonne, What in his absence in her Court was done. The glymmering starr's like Sentinels in warre, Behind the Clowdes as thieves doe stand to pry, And through false loope-holes looking out a farre, To see him skirmish with his destenie, As they had held a counsell in the Sky, And had before consulted with the night, Shee should be darke, and they would hide their light. In deadly silence all the shores are hush'd, Onely the Shreechowle sounds to the assault, And Isis with a troubled murmure rush'd, As shee had done her best to hide the fault, A little whispering moov'd within the vault, Made with his tuching softly as he went, Which seem'd to say it furthered his intent. This wondrous Queene, whom care from rest had kept, Now for his speed to heaven holds up her hands, A thousand thoughts within her bosome heap'd, Now in her Closset listning still she stands, And though devided as in sundry strands, Yet absent, present in desires they bee, For minds discerne, where eyes could never see. Loe now he thinks he vaulteth in her sight, Still taking courage, strengthned by her words, Imagining shee sported with delight, To see his strong armes stretch the tackling coards, And oft a smyle unto his toyle affords: And when shee doubted danger, might her heare, Call him her soule, her life, her Mortimer. Nowe doth shee wooe the walls, intreat and kisse, And then protests to memorize the place, And to adorne it with a Piramis, Whose glory wrack of time should not deface. Then to the cord shee turnes her selfe a space, And promiseth, if that should set him free, A sacred relique it should ever bee. Shee saith, the small clowds issuing from his breath, Seasond with sweet from whence they lately came, Should cleere the ayre from pestilence and death, And like Promethian life-begetting flame, Pure bodies in the element should frame; And to what part of heaven they hapt to stray, There should they make another milkie way. Attaind the top his tyred lymm's to breath, Mounted in tryumph on his miseries, The gentle earth salutes him from beneath: And cover'd with the comfortable skyes, Lightned with beames of Isabella's eyes, Downe from the Turret desperatly doth slide; Now for a kingdome, Fortune be his guide. As hee descends, so doe her eyes ascend, As feare had fixt them to behold his fall; Then from the sight, away her sight doth bend, When chilly coldnes doth her hart appall, Then out for helpe shee suddainly doth call; Silent againe, watching if ought should hap, Her selfe might be the ground, his grave her lap. Now doth she court the gentle calmie ayre, And then againe shee doth conjure the winde; Now doth she try to stop the night by prayer, And then with spells the heavy sence to binde; Then by the burning Tapers shee divinde; Now shee intreats faire Thames that hee might passe The Hellespont where her Leander was. The brushing murmure stills her like a song, Yet fearing least the streame should fall in love, Envies the drops which on his tresses hong, Imagining the waves to stay him strove; And when the billowes with his brest he drove, Grieved there-with, shee turnes away her face, Jealous least hee the billowes should embrace. Shee likneth him to the transformed Bull, Which curll'd the fayre flood with his Ivory flanck, When on his backe he bare the lovely trull, Floting along unto the Cretan banck, Comparing this to that lascivious pranck, And swears then hee, no other Jove there were, If shee Europa had been present there. Thus seekes he life, encourag'd by his love, Yet for his love his life he doth eschue, Danger in him a deadly feare doth move, And feare envits him danger to pursue, Rage stirr's revenge, revenge doth rage renue: Danger and feare, rage and revenge at strife, Life warr's with love, and love contends with life. Thys angry Lyon having slypp'd his chayne, Now like a Quartain, makes King Edward quake, Who knew too well, ere he was caught againe, Some of his flock his bloody thirst must slake; And unawares intangled in this brake, Sawe further vengeance hanging in the wind, Knowing too well, the greatnes of his mind. Thus once againe the world begins to worke, Theyr hopes (at length) unto thys issue brought, Whilst yet the Serpent in his Den doth lurke, Of whom God knowes, the King full little thought, The instrument which these devises wrought. For ther's no treason woundeth halfe so deepe, As that which doth in Princes bosoms sleepe. Now must the Cleargie serve them for a cloke, The Queene her state unto the time must fit, But tis the Church-man which must strike the stroke, Now must thys Prelate shew a statesmans wit, They cast the plot, and March must manage it; They both at home together lay on load, And he the Agent to effect abroad. Who sweetly tunes his well-perswading tong, In pleasing musick to the French-kings ears, The sad discourse of Isabellas wrong, With tragick action forcing silent tears, Mooving to pitty every one that hears, That by discovery of thys foule reproch, Old mischiefes so, might new be set abroch. Whilst they are tempring in these home-bred jarres, How for the Scot fit passage might be made, To lay the ground of these successfull warrs, That hope might give him courage to invade, And from the King the Commons to perswade; That whilst at home his peace he would assure, His further plague in Fraunce he might procure. By these reports, all circumstances knowne, Sounds Charles of Fraunce into the lists againe, To ceaze on Guyen by Armes to clayme his owne, Which Edward doth unlawfully detaine, Homage for Pontieu, and for Aquitaine, Revoking this dishonorable truce, Urg'd by his wrongs, and Isabels abuse. The spirits thus rayz'd which haunt him day and night, And on his fortune heaven doth ever lower, Danger at hand, and mischiefe still in sight, Civill sedition weakning still his power, No ease of paine one minute in the hower: T'intreat of peace with Charles, he now must send, Else all his hopes in Fraunce were at an end. Heere is the poynt wherein all poynts must end, Which must be handled with no meane regard, The prop whereon this building must depend, Which must by levell curiouslie be squard, The cunningst descant that had yet beene hard. Heere close conveyance must a meane provide, Else might the ambush easely be discride. Or this must helpe, or nothing serves the turne, This way, or no way, all must come about, To blowe the fier which now began to burne, Or tind the strawe before the brand went out, This is the lot which must resolve the doubt, To walke the path where Edward bears the light, And take their ayme by levell of his sight. This must a counsell seriously debate, In gravest judgements fit to be discust, Beeing a thing so much consernes the state, Edward in this, must to their wisedomes trust, No whit suspecting but that all were just. Especially the Church whose mouth should be, The Oracle of truth and equitie. Torlton whose tongue, mens eares in chaines could tye, Whose words, even like a thunderbolt could pearce, And were alowd of more aucthoritie, Then was the Sibills olde divining verse, Which were of force a judgement to reverse: Now for the Queene, with all his power doth stand, To lay this charge on her well-guiding hand. What helpes her presence to the cause might bring, First as a wife, a sister, and a mother, A Queene to deale, betwixt a King, and King, To right her sonne, her husband, and her brother, And each to her indifferent as the other: Which colour serves to worke in these extreames, That which (God knowes) King Edward never dreames. Torlton is this thy spirituall pretence? Would God thy thoughts were more spirituall, Or lesse perswasive were thy eloquence, But ô thy actions are too temporall, Thy reasons subtill and sophisticall: Would all were true thy suposition sayth, Thy arguments lesse force, or thou more fayth. Thus is the matter managed with skill, To his desires, their meanes thus to devise, To thrust him on, to drawe them up the hill, That by his strength, they might get power to rise, This great Archmaster of all policies: In the beginning wisely had forcast, How ere things went, which way they must at last. With sweetest hony, thus he baytes the snare, And clawes the beast till he be in the yoke, In golden cups he poyson doth prepare, And tickles where he meanes to strike the stroke, Giving the bone whereas he meant to choke: And by all helpes of Arte doth smooth the way, To send his foe, downe head-long to decay. Shee which thus fitly had both winde and tide, And sawe her passage serve the hower so right, Whilst things thus fadge are quicke dispatch applide, To take her time whilst yet the day is light, Who hath beene tyerd in travell feares the night: And finding all too much to change inclind, And every toy soone altering Edwards mind. Her followers such as frendlesse else had stood, Supprest and troden with the Spensers pride, Whose howses Edward branded had with blood, And but with blood could not be satisfi'd, Who for revenge did but the hower abide; And knew all helpes, that mischiefe could invent, To shake the state, and further her intent. Thus on the wronged, she her wrongs doth rest, And unto poyson, poyson doth applie, Her selfe oprest, to harden the oprest, And with a spye, to intercept a spye, An Enemie, against an Enemie. Hee that will gaine what policie doth heede, By Mercurie must deale, or never speede. Now Mortimer, whose mayne was fully set, Seeing by fortune all his hopes were crost, His strugling still how he againe might get, That which before his disadvantage lost, Not once dismayd though in these tempests tost: Nor in affliction is he overthrowne, To Mortimer all Countries are his owne. Englands an Ile where all his youth he spent, Environ'd valure in it selfe is drownd, But now he lives within the continent, Which being boundlesse, honour hath no bound, Here through the world, doth endlesse glory sound: To fames rich treasure Time unlocks the dore, Which angry Fortune had shut up before. What wayes he of his wealth, our Wigmore left, Let builded heapes, let Rocks and Mountaines stand, Wigmore the ancient house of the Mortimers. Goods oft be held by wrong, first got by theft, Birds have the ayre, Fish water, Men the land, Alcides pitch'd his pillers in the sand. Men looke up to the starres thereby to knowe, As they doe progresse heaven, he earth should doe. And to this end, did Nature part the ground, Else had not man beene King upon the Sea, Nor in depths her secrets had beene found, If to all parts on firme had layne his way, But she to shewe him where her wonders lay: To passe the floods, this meane for him invents, To trample on these baser elements. Never sawe France, no never till this day, A mind more great, more free, more resolute, Let all our Edwards say, what Edwards may, Our Henries, Talbot, or our Mountacute, To whom our royall conquests we impute: That Charles him selfe, oft to the Peers hath sworne, This man alone, the Destinies did scorne. Vertue can beare, what can on Vertue fall, Who cheapeneth honour, must not stand on price, Who beareth heaven (they say) can well beare all, A yeelding mind doth argue cowardize, Our haps doe turne as chaunces on the dice. Nor never let him from his hope remove, That under him hath mould, the starres above. Let dull-braynd slaves contend for mud and earth, Let blocks and stones, sweat but for blocks and stones, Let peasants speake of plenty and of dearth, Fame never lookes so lowe as on these drones, Let courage manage Empiers, sit on thrones. And he that Fortune at commaund will keepe, He must be suer, he never let her sleepe. Who wins her grace, must with atchivements wooe her, As shee is blind, so never had shee eares, Nor must with puling eloquence goe to her, Shee understands not sighes, she heares not prayers, Flatterd shee flyes, controld shee ever feares; And though a while shee nicely doe forsake it, Shee is a woman, and at length will take it. Nor never let him dreame once of a Crowne, For one bad cast, that will give up his game, And though by ill hap he be overthrowne, Yet let him manage her, till shee be tame, The path is set with danger leads to fame: When Minos did the Græcians flight denie, He made him wings, and mounted through the skie. The cheerefull morning cleeres her cloudie browes, The vaporie mists are all disperst and spred, Now sleepie Time his lazie lims doth rouze, And once beginneth to hold up his head, Hope bloometh faire, whose roote was wel nere dead, The clue of sorrowe to the end is ronne, The bowe appeares to tell the flood is donne. Nature lookes backe to see her owne decay, Commaunding age to slacke her speedy pace, Occasion forth her golden loake doth lay, Whilst sorrowe paynts her wrinckle-withered face, Day lengthneth day, and joyes doe joyes imbrace. Now is she comming yet till she be heere, My pen runnes slowe, each comma seemes a yeere. She's now imbarck'd, slide billowes for her sake, Whose eyes can make your aged Neptune yong, Sweet Syrens from the chaulkie cleevs awake, Ravish her eares with some in chaunting song, Daunce the Lavoltos all the sands along: It is not Venus on your floods doth passe, But one more fayre then ever Venus was. You scalie Dolphins gaze upon her eyes, And never after with your kind make warre, O steale the Musicke from her lips that flyes, Whose accents like the tunes of Angels are, Compard with whom Arions did but jarre. Hugge them sweet ayre, and when the Seas doe rage, Use them as charmes thy tempests to aswage. Sweet Sea-nymphs flock in sholes upon the shores, Fraunce kisse those feete whose steps thou first didst guide, Present thy Queene with all thy gorgious store, Now mayst thou revell in thy greatest pride: Shyp mount to heaven, and be thou stellified, And next that starr-fix'd Argosie alone, There take thou up thy constellation. Th'exceeding joy conceved by the Queene, Or his content, to them I leave to gesse Who but the subject of their thoughts have seene, Who I am sure, if they the truth confesse, Will say that silence onely can expresse: And when with honor shee fit time could take, With sweet embraces thus shee him bespake. O Mortimer, great Mortimer quoth shee, What angry power such mischiefe could devise, To separate thy deerest Queene and thee, Whom loves eternall union strongly tyes? But seeing thee, unto my longing eyes (Though guiltlesse they,) this penance is assignd, To gaze upon thee untill they be blind. Sweet face, quoth shee, how art thou changed thus, Since beauty on this lovely front thou bor'st, Like the yong Hunter fresh Hipolitus, When in these curles my favors first thou wor'st? Now like great Jove thy Juno thou ador'st; The Muses leave theyr double-topped throne, And on thy temples make theyr Helicon. Come tell mee now what griefe and danger is, Of paine and pleasure in imprisonment, At every breath the poynt shal be a kisse, Which can restore consuming languishment, A cordiall to comfort banishment; And thou shalt find, that pleasures long restraind, Be farre more pleasant when they once be gaind. Now sweeten all thy sorrowes with delight, Teach man-hood courtshyp, turne these broyles to love, The day's nere ill that hast a pleasing night, Ther's other warrs in hand, which thou must prove, Warrs which no blood shall shed, nor sorrow move: And that sweet foe of whom thou winn'st the day, Shall crowne thy tresses with tryumphant Bay. And sith that tyme our better ease assures, Let solace sit and rock thee on her brest, And let thy sences say like Epicures, Lets eate and drinke, and lay us downe to rest, Like belly-Gods, to surfet at the feast; Our day is cleere, then never doubt a shower, Prince Edward is my sonne, England my dower. Possessing this inestimable Jem, What is there wanting to maintaine thy port? Thy royall Mistresse wears a Diadem, Thy high-pitchd pyneons sore beyond report, I am thy Wigmore, Fraunce shall be thy Court; How canst thou want millions of Pearle and gold, When thou the Indies in thyne armes dost hold? Thou art King Edward, or opinion fayles, Longshanks begot thee when in youth he rang'd, Thou art Carnarvan, thou the Prince of Wales, And in thy Cradle falsely thou wert chang'd, Hee Mortimer, and thou hast beene estrang'd: Pardon me deere, what Mortimer sayd I, Then should I love him, but my tongue doth lie. As Fortune hath created him a King, Had Nature made him valiant as thou art, My soule had not been tuch'd with torments sting, Nor hadst thou now been plac'd so neere my hart; But since by lot this falleth to thy part, If such have wealth as lewdly will abuse it, Let those enjoy it who can better use it. Except to heaven, my hopes can clime no hier; Now in mine armes had I my little boy, Then had I all on earth I could desier, The King's as he would be, God send him joy, Now with his mynions let him sport and toy: His lemman Spenser, and himselfe alone, May sit and talke of Mistresse Gaveston. When first I of that wanton King was woo'd, Why camst thou not unto the Court of Fraunce? Thou then alone should'st in my grace have stood, O Mortimer, how good had been thy chaunce? Then had I beene thine owne inheritance; Now entrest thou by force, and holds by might, And so intrud'st upon anothers right. Honor that I doll weomen so adore, How many plagues hast thou in store to grieve us, When in our selves we finde there yet is more Then that bare word of majestie can give us? When of that comfort so thou canst deprive us, Which with our selves oft sett'st us at debate, And mak'st us beggers in our greatest state. Even as a Trumpets lively-sounding voyce, Tryps on the winds with many a dainty trick, When as the speaking Ecchoes doe rejoyce, So much delighted with the rethorick, Seeming to make the heavie dull ayre quick; With such rare musick in a thousand kayes, Upon his hart-strings shee in consort playes. On thys foundation whilst they firmely stand, And as they wish, so fitly all things went, No worse their warrant, then King Edwards hand, Who his owne Bow to his destruction bent; The course of things to fall in true consent, Gives full assurance of the happy end, On which their thoughts now carefully attend. And sith in payment all for currant passe, And theyr proceedings were allow'd for such, Although this peace against her stomack was, And yet imports the Princes strength so much, To carry all things cleerly without tuch, With seeming care doth seemingly effect, What love commaunds, and greatnes should respect. Charles waying well his lawfull Nephews right, So mighty an Embassador as shee, This meane to winne her grace in Edwards sight, And so reclaime his vaine inconstancie, With kindnes thus to conquer all these three, What love the subjects to his Sister bore, Heapes on desert, to make this much the more. Her expedition, and thys great successe Of after-good, still seeming to devine, Carnarvan should by covenant release, And to the Prince the Provinces resigne, Who dooing homage, should reenter Guyne, Safe-conduct sent the King, to come with speed, To seale in person what the Queene decreed. But whilst he stood yet doubtfull what to doe, The Spensers who his counsels chiefely guide, Nor with theyr Soveraigne into Fraunce durst goe, Nor in his absence durst at home abide: His listning eares with such perswasions plyde, As hee by them, to stay at home is wonne, And with Commission to dispatch his Sonne. Now till thys howre all joyes in wombed lay, And in this howre now came they first to light, Ad dayes to Months, and howres unto the day, And as Jove dyd, so make a treble night, And whilst delight is ravish'd with delight, Swound in these sweets, in pleasures pleasing paine, And as they die, so brought to life againe. Now Clowd-borne care, hence vanish for a time, The Sunne ascending, hath the yeere renew'd, And as the Halkes in hotest Sotherne clime, Their halfe-sick hopes their crazed flags have mew'd, A world of joyes their brests doe now include, The thoughts whereof, thoughts quicknes doth benum, In whose expression, pens and tongues be dumbe. In fayre Lavinium, Troy is built againe, And on thys shore her ruins are repard, Nor Junos hate such vigor doth retaine, The Fates appeas'd who with theyr fortune squard, The remnant of the shypwrackt navie spard, Though torne with tempests, yet ariv'd at last, May sit and sing, and tell of sorrowes past. If shee doe sit, he leanes on Cynthias throne, If shee doe walke, he in the circle went, If shee doe sport, he must be grac'd alone, If shee discourse, he is the argument, If shee devise, it is to his content: From her proceeds the light he beares about him, And yet she sets if once shee be without him. Still with his eares his soveraigne Goddesse hears, And with his eyes shee graciously doth see, Still in her breast his secret thoughts she bears, Nor can her tongue pronounce an I, but wee, Thus two in one, and one in two they bee: And as his soule possesseth head and hart, Shee's all in all, and all in every part. Like as a well-tund Lute thats tucht with skill, In Musicks language sweetly speaking playne, When every string it selfe with sound doth fill, Taking their tones, and giving them againe, A diapazon heard in every strayne: So their affections set in kayes so like, Still fall in consort, as their humors strike. Shee must returne, King Edwards will is so, But soft a while, shee meaneth no such thing, He's not so swift, but shee is twice as slowe, No hast, but good, this message backe to bring, Another tune he must be taught to sing: Which to his hart more deadly is by far, Then cryes of ghosts, or Mandrakes shreekings are. Stapleton who had beene of their counsell long, Or woonne with gifts, or else of childish feare, Or mov'd in conscience with King Edwards wrong, Or pittying him, or hate to them did beare, Or of th'event that now he did dispaire: This Bishop backe from Fraunce to Edward flewe, And knowing all discovered all he knewe. The platforme of this enterprize disclosd, And Torltons drift by circumstances found, With what conveyance all things are disposd, The cunning usd in laying of the ground, And with what Art, this curious trayle is woond: Awakes the King, to see his owne estate, When to prevent, he comes a day too late. Isabell the time doth still and still rejorne, Charles as a Brother with perswasions deales, Edward with threats, doth hasten her retorne, Pope John, with Bulls and curses hard assailes, Perswasions, curses, threats, no whit prevailes: Charles, Edward, John, Pope, Princes, doe your worst, The Queene fares best, when she the most is curst. The Spensers, who the French-mens humors felt, And with their Soveraigne, had devisd the draught, With Prince, and Peers, now under hand had delt, In golden nets, who were alreadie caught, And nowe King Charles, they have so throughlie wrought: That he with sums, too slightly overwaid, Poore Isabells hopes, now in the dust are layd. Thou base desier, thou grave of all good harts, Corsive to kindnes, bawd to beastly will, Monster of time, defrauder of desarts, Thou plague, which doest both love and vertue kill, Honours abuser, friendships greatest ill: If curse in hell, there worse then other bee, I pray that curse, may trebled light on thee. Nor can all these amaze this mighty Queene, Who with affliction, never was controld, Never such courage in her sex was seene, Nor was she cast in other womens mould, But can endure warres, travell, want, and cold: Strugling with Fortune, nere with greefe opprest, Most cheerefull still, when she was most distrest, Thus she resolv'd, to leave ungratefull France, And in the world her fortune yet to trye, Chaunging the ayre, hopes time will alter chance, As one whose thoughts with honors wings doe flye, Her mighty mind, still scorning miserie: Yet ere she went, her greeved hart to heale, Shee rings King Charles, this dolefull parting peale. Is this the trust I have repos'd (quoth shee) And to this end to thee my griefes have told? Is this the kindnes that thou offerest mee? And in thy Country am I bought and sold? In all this heate art thou become so cold? Came I to Fraunce in hope to find a frend? And now in thee have all my hopes their end? Phillip (quoth shee) thy Father never was, But some base peasant, or some slavish hind, Never did Kingly Lyon get an Asse, Nor cam'st thou of that Princely Eagles kind: But sith thy hatefull cowardise I find, Sinke thou, thy power, thy Country, ayde and all, Thou barbarous Moore, thou most unnaturall. Thou wert not Sonne unto the Queene my mother, Nor wert conceived in her sacred woombe, Some misbegotten changeling, not my Brother, O that thy Nurses armes had beene thy Toombe, Or thy birth-day had beene the day of doombe: Never was Fortune with such error led, As when shee plac'd a Crowne upon thy head. And for my farewell this I prophecie, That from my loynes, that glorious fruite shall spring, Which shall tread downe that base posteritie, And lead in tryumph thy succeeding King, To fatall Fraunce, I as Sibilla sing: Her Citties sackd, the ruine of her men, When of the English, one shall conquer ten. Beumount who had in Fraunce this shufling seene, Whose soule with kindnes Isabell had wonne, To flye to Henault, now perswades the Queene, John of Henault. Assuring her what good might there be done, Offering his Neece, unto the Prince her Sonne: The onely meane, to bend his brothers might, Against King Edward, and to back her right. This worthy Lord, experienc'd long in armes, Whom Isabell with many favours grac'd, Whose Princely blood, the brute of conquest warmes, In whose great thoughts, the Queene was highly plac'd, Greeving to see her succours thus defac'd, Hath cast this plot, which managed with heed, Sith all doe fayle, should onely helpe at need. Shee who but lately had her Ankors wayd, And sawe the cloudes on every side to rise, Nor now can stay, untill the streame be stayd, Nor harbour till the cleering of the skies, Who though she rov'd, the marke stil in her eyes, Accepts his offer thankfully as one, Succouring the poore in such affliction. This courteous Earle, mov'd with her sad report, Whose eares were drawne to her inchanting tong, Traind up with her in Phillips royall Court, And fully now confirmed in her wrong, Her foes growe weake, her friends grow daily strong. The Barrons oath, gag'd in her cause to stand, The Commons word, the Cleargies helping hand. All Covenants signd with wedlocks sacred seale, In friendships bonds eternally to bind, And all proceeding from so perfect zeale, And suting right, with Henalts mighty mind, What ease hereby, the Queene doth hope to find; The sweet contentment of the lovely bride, Young Edward pleasd, and joy on every side. Now full seaven times, the Sunne his welked waine, Had on the top of all the Tropick set, And seaven times descending downe againe, His fiery wheeles, had with the fishes wet, Since malice first this mischiefe did beget: In which so many courses hath beene runne, As he that time celestiall signes hath done. From Henalt now this great Bellona comes, Glyding along fayre Belgias glassie maine, Mazing the shores with noyse of thundring drums, With her young Edward, Duke of Aquitayne, The fatall scourges of King Edwards raigne: Her Souldiour Beumount, and the Earle of Kent, And Mortimer that mightie Malcontent. Three thousand Souldiers mustred men in pay, Of Almaynes, Swisers, trustie Henawers, Of native English fled beyond the Sea, Of fat-braind Fleamings, fishie Zelanders, Edwards decreasing power, augmenting hers: Her friends at home expect her comming in, And new commotions every day begin. The Coasts be daylie kept with watch and ward, The Beacons burning, at thy foes discrie, O had the love of Subjects beene thy guard, T'ad beene t'effect, what thou didst fortifie, But t'is thy houshold home-bred Enemie: Nor Fort, nor Castell, can thy Countrey keepe, When foes doe wake, and dreamed friends doe sleepe. In vaine be armes, when heaven becomes a foe, Kneele, weepe, intreat, and speake thy Deaths-man fayre, The earth is armd unto thy overthrowe, Goe pacifie the angrie powers by prayer, Or if not pray, goe Edward and dispayre: Thy fatall end, why doest thou this begin, Locking Death out, thou keep'st destruction in. A Southwest gale, for Harwich fitly blowes, Blow not so fast, to kindle such a fier: Whilst under saile, shee yet securely rowes, Turne gentle wind, and force her to retyer, But ô the winds, doe Edwards wrack conspyre, For when the heavens are unto justice bent, All things be turnd to our just punishment. Shee is arriv'd in Orwells pleasant Roade, Orwell thy name, or ill, or never was: Why art thou not ore-burthend with thy loade? Why sinck'st thou not under thys monstrous masse? But what heaven will, that needs must come to passe. That grievous plague thou carriest on thy deepe, Shall give just cause for many, streames to weepe. Englands Earle-marshall, Lord of all that Coast, With bells and bonfires welcoms her to shore, Great Leicester next joyneth hoast to hoast, The Cleargies power, in readines before, Which every day increaseth more and more: Upon the Church a great taxation layd, For Armes, munition, mony, men, and ayd. Such as too long had looked for this hower, And in their brests imprisoned discontent, Their wills thus made too powerful by their power Whose spirits were factious, great, and turbulent, Their hopes succesfull by this ill event, Like to a thiefe that for his purpose lyes, Take knowledge now of Edwards injuries. Young Prince of Wales, loe heere thy vertue lyes, Soften thy Mothers flintie hart with teares, Then wooe thy Father with those blessed eyes, Wherein the image of himselfe appeares, With thy soft hand softly uniting theirs: With thy sweet kisses so them both beguile, Untill they smyling weepe, and weeping smile. Bid her behold that curled silken Downe, Thy fayre smooth brow, in beauties fayrer pryme, Not to be prest with a care-bringing Crowne, Nor that with sorrowes wrinckled ere the time, Thy feete too feeble to his seate to clime; Who gave thee life, a crowne for thee did make, Taking that Crowne, thou life from him doost take. Looke on these Babes, the seales of plighted troth, Whose little armes about your bodies cling, These pretty imps, so deere unto you both, Beg on their knees, their little hands do wring, Queenes to a Queene, Kings kneele unto a King, To see theyr comfort, and the crowne defac'd, You fall to Armes, which have in armes embrac'd. Subjects see these, and then looke backe on these, Where hatefull rage with kindly nature strives, And judge by Edward of your owne disease, Chyldren by chyldren, by his wife your wives, Your state by his, in his life your owne lives, And yeeld your swords, to take your deaths as due, Then draw your swords, to spoyle both him and you. From Edmondsbury now comes thys Lyonesse, Under the Banner of young Aquitaine, And downe towards Oxford doth herselfe adresse, A world of vengeance wayting on her traine, Heere is the period of Carnarvans raigne; Edward thou hast, but King thou canst not beare, Ther's now no King, but great King Mortimer. Now friendles Edward followed by his foes, Needes must he runne, the devill hath in chase, Poore in his hopes, but wealthy in his woes, Plenty of plagues, but scarcitie of grace, Who wearied all, now wearieth every place; No home at home, no comfort seene abroad, His minde small rest, his body small aboad. One scarce to him his sad discourse hath done Of Henalts power, and what the Queene intends, But whilst he speakes, another hath begun, Another straight beginning where he ends, Some of new foes, some of revolting frends; These ended once, againe new rumors spred Of many which rebell, of many fled. Thus of the remnant of his hopes bereft, Shee hath the sum, and hee the silly rest, Towards Wales he flyes, of England being left, To rayse an Armie there himselfe adrest, But of his power shee fully is possest; Shee hath the East, her rising there-withall, And he the West, I there goes downe his fall. What plagues doth Edward for himselfe prepare? Alas poore Edward, whether doost thou flie? Men change the ayre, but seldome change their care, Men flie from foes, but not from miserie, Griefes be long-liv'd, and sorrowes seldome die; And when thou feel'st thy conscience tuch'd with griefe, Thy selfe pursues thy selfe, both rob'd and thiefe. Towards Lundy, which in Sabryns mouth doth stand, Carried with hope, still hoping to finde ease, Imagining thys were his native Land, Thys England: and Severne the narrow seas, With this conceit (poore soule) himselfe doth please. And sith his rule is over-rul'd by men, On byrds and beasts he'll king it once agen. Tis treble death a freezing death to feele, For him, on whom the sunne hath ever shone, Who hath been kneel'd unto, can hardly kneele, Nor hardly beg which once hath been his owne, A fearefull thing to tumble from a throne; Fayne would he be king of a little Ile, All were his Empyre bounded in a myle. Aboard a Barke, now towards the Ile he sayles, Thinking to find some mercy in the flood: But see, the weather with such power prevailes, Not suffring him to rule thys peece of wood; Who can attaine, by heaven and earth with-stood? Edward, thy hopes but vainly doe delude, By Gods and men uncessantly pursu'd. At length to land his carefull Barke he hales, Beaten with stormes, ballast with misery, Thys home-bred exile, on the Coast of Wales, Unlike himselfe, with such as like him bee, Spenser, Reding, Baldock, these haplesse three, They to him subject, he subject to care, And he and they, to murther subject are. To ancient Neyth, a Castell strongly built, Thether repayre thys forlorne banish'd crew, Which holdeth them, but not contaynes theyr guilt, There hid from eyes, but not from envies view, Nor from theyr starrs themselves they yet with-drew, Walls may awhile keepe out an enemie, But never Castle kept out destenie. Heere Fortune hath immur'd them in this hold, Willing theyr poore imprisoned liberty, Living a death, in hunger, want, and cold, Whilst murtherous treason entreth secretly, All lay on hands to punish cruelty; And when even might is up unto the chin, Weake frends become strong foes to thrust him in. Melpomine, thou dolefull Muse be gone, Thy sad complaints be matters farre too light, Heere (now) come plagues beyond comparison. You dreadfull Furies, visions of the night, With gastly howling all approch my sight, And let pale ghosts with sable Tapers stand, To lend sad light to my more sadder hand. Each line shall be a history of woe, And every accent as a dead mans cry; Now must my teares in such aboundance flow, As doe the drops of fruitfull Castaly, Each letter must containe a tragedy: Loe, now I come to tell this wofull rest, The drerest tale that ever pen exprest. You sencelesse stones, as all prodigious, Or things which of like solid substance be, Sith thus in nature all grow monsterous, And unto kinde contrary disagree, Consume, or burne, or weepe, or sigh with mee, Unlesse the earth hard-harted, nor can moane, Makes steele and stones, more hard then steele and stone. All-guiding heaven, which so doost still maintaine What ere thou moov'st in perfect unitie, And bynd'st all things in friendshyps sacred chayne, In spotles and perpetuall amitie, Which is the bounds of thy great Emperie; Why sufferest thou the sacriligious rage, Of thys rebellious, hatefull, yron age. Now ruine raignes, God helpe the Land the while, All prysons freed to make all mischiefes free, Traytors and Rebels called from exile, All things be lawfull, but what lawfull bee, Nothing our owne, but our owne infamie: Death, which ends care, yet carelesse of our death, Who steales our joyes, but stealeth not our breath. London which didst thys mischiefe first begin, Loe, now I come thy tragedy to tell, The Londeners set all the prisoners at liberty.Thou art the first thats plagued for this sin, Which first didst make the entrance to this hell, Now death and horror in thy walls must dwell, Which should'st have care thy selfe in health to keepe, Thus turn'st the wolves amongst the harmelesse sheepe. O had I eyes, another Thames to weepe, Or words expressing more, then words expresse, O could my teares, thy great foundation steepe, To moane thy pride, thy wastfull vaine excesse, Thy gluttonie, thy youthfull wantonnesse: But t'is thy sinnes, that to the heavens are fled, Dissolving clowdes of vengeance on thy head. The place prophan'd, where God should be adord, The stone remov'd, whereon our faith is grounded, Aucthoritie is scornd, counsell abhord, Religion so by foolish sects confounded, Weake consciences by vaine questions wounded: The honour due, to Magistrates neglected, What else but vengeance can there be expected? When fayth but faynd, a faith doth onely fayne, And Church-mens lives, give Lay-men leave to fall, The Ephod made a cloake to cover gayne, Cunning avoyding what's canonicall, Yet holines the Badge to beare out all: When sacred things be made a merchandize, None talke of texts, then ceaseth prophicies. When as the lawes, doe once pervert the lawes, And weake opinion guides the common weale, Where doubts should cease, doubts rise in every clawse, The sword which wounds, should be a salve to heale, Oppression works oppression to conceale: Yet beeing us'd, when needfull is the use, Right clokes all wrongs, and covers all abuse. Tempestious thunders, teare the fruitlesse earth, The roring Ocean past her bounds to rise, Death-telling apparisions, monstrous birth, Th'affrighted heaven with comet-glaring eyes, The ground, the ayre, all fild with prodigies: Fearefull eclipses, fierie vision, And angrie Planets in conjunction. Thy chanells serve for inke, for paper stones, And on the ground, write murthers, incests, rapes, And for thy pens, a heape of dead-mens bones, Thy letters, ugly formes, and monstrous shapes; And when the earths great hollow concave gapes, Then sinke them downe, least shee we live upon, Doe leave our use, and flye subjection. Virgine, but Virgine onely in thy name, Now for thy sinne what murtherer shall be spent? Blacke is my inke, but blacker is thy shame, Who shall revenge? my Muse can but lament, With hayre disheveld, words and tears halfe spent: Poore ravish'd Lucrece stands to end her lyfe, Whilst cruell Tarquin whets the angrie knyfe. Thou wantst redresse, and tyrannie remorce, And sad suspition dyes thy fault in graine, Compeld by force, must be repeld by force, Complaints no pardon, penance helpes not payne, But blood must wash out a more bloody stayne: To winne thine honour with thy losse of breath, Thy guiltlesse lyfe with thy more guiltie death. Thou art benumd, thou canst not feele at all, Plagues be thy pleasures, feare hath made past feare, The deadly sound of sinnes nile-thundering fall, Hath tuned horror setled in thine eare, Shreeks be the sweetest Musicke thou canst heare: Armes thy attyer, and weapons all thy good, And all the wealth thou hast, consists in blood. See wofull Cittie, on thy ruin'd wall, The verie Image of thy selfe heere see, Read on thy gates in charrecters thy fall, In famish'd bodies, thine Anatomie, How like to them thou art, they like to thee: And if thy teares have dim'd thy hatefull sight, Thy buildings are one fier to give thee light. For world that was, a wofull is, complayne, When men might have been buried when they dyed, When Children might have in their cradels layne, When as a man might have enjoy'd his bride, The Sonne kneeld by his Fathers death-bed side: The lyving wrongd, the dead no right (now) have, The Father sees his Sonne to want a grave. The poore Samarian almost starv'd for food, Yet sawced her sweet Infants flesh with tears, But thou in child with murther, long'st for blood, Which thy wombe wanting, casts the fruite it bears, Thy viperous brood, their lothsome prison teyrs: Thou drinkst thy gore out of a dead-mans scull, Thy stomack hungry, though thy gorge be full. Is all the world in sencelesse slaughter dround? No pittying hart? no hand? no eye? no eare? None holds his sword from ripping of the wound, No sparke of pittie, nature, love, nor feare; Be all so mad, that no man can forbeare? Will you incur the cruell Neros blame, Thus to discover your owne Mothers shame? The man who of the plague yet raving lyes, Heares yeelding gosts to give their latest grone, And from his carefull window nought espyes, But dead-mens bodies, others making moane, No talke but Death, and execution. Poore silly women from their houses fled, Crying (ô helpe) my husbands murthered; Thames turne thee backe to Belgias frothie mayne, Fayre Tame and Isis, hold backe both your springs, Nor on thy London spread thy silver trayne, Nor let thy Ships lay forth their silken wings, Thy shores with Swans late dying Dirgies rings, Nor in thy armes let her imbraced bee, Nor smile on her which sadly weepes on thee. Time end thy selfe here, let it not be sayd, That ever Death did first begin in thee, Nor let this slaunder to thy fault be layd, That ages charge thee with impietie, Least feare what hath beene, argue what may be: And fashioning so a habite of the mind, Make men no men, and alter humaine kind. But yet this outrage hath but taken breath, For pittie past, she meanes to make amends, And more enrag'd, she doth returne to death, And next goes downe King Edward and his frends, What she hath hoarded, now she franckly spends: In such strange action as was never seene, Clothing revenge in habite of a Queene. Now Stapleton's thy turne, from France that fled, The next the lot unto the Spensers fell, Reding the Marshall, marshal'd with the dead, Next is thy turne great Earle of Arundell, Then Mochelden and wofull Daniell: Who followed him in his lascivious wayes, Must goe before him to his blackest dayes. Carnarvan by his Countrie-men betrayd, And sent a Prisoner from his native Land, To Kenelworth poore King he is convayd, To th'Earle of Leister with a mighty band; And now a present Parliament in hand, Fully concluding what they had begunne, T'uncrowne King Edward, and invest his Sonne. A scepter's lyke a pillar of great height, Whereon a mighty building doth depend, Which when the same is over-prest with weight, And past his compasse, forc'd therby to bend, His massie roofe down to the ground doth send: Crushing the lesser props, and murthering all, Which stand within the compasse of his fall. Where vice is countenanc'd with nobilitie, Arte cleane excluded, ignorance held in, Blinding the world, with mere hipocrisie, Yet must be sooth'd in all their slavish sinne, Great malcontents to growe they then begin: Nursing vile wits, to make them factious tooles, Thus mighty men oft proove the mightiest fooles. The Senate wronged by the Senator, And justice made injustice by delayes, Next innovation playes the Orator, Counsels uncounseld, Death defers no dayes, And plagues, but plagues, alow no other playes: And when one lyfe, makes hatefull many lives, Cæsar though Cæsar, dyes with swords and knives. Now for the Cleargie, Peers, and Laietie, Against the King must resignation make, Th'elected Senate of the Emperie, To Kenelworth are come, the Crowne to take, Sorrowe hath yet but slept, and now awake: In solemne sort each one doth take his place, The partiall Judges of poore Edwards case. From his imprisoning chamber, cloth'd in black, Before the great assemblie he is brought, A dolefull hearse upon a dead-mans back, Whose heavie lookes, might tell his heavie thought, Greefe neede no fayned action to be taught: His Funerall solemniz'd in his cheere, His eyes the Mourners, and his legs the Beere. His fayre red cheeks clad in pale sheets of shame, And for a dumbe shew in a swound began, Where passion doth strange sort of passion frame, And every sence a right Tragedian, Exceeding farre the compasse of a man, By use of sorrow learning nature arte, Teaching Dispayre to act a lively part. Ah Pitty, doost thou live, or art thou not? Some say such sights, men unto flints have turned, Or Nature, else thy selfe hast thou forgot? Or is it but a tale, that men have mourned? That water ever drown'd, or fire burned? Or have teares left to dwell in humaine eyes, Or ever man to pitty miseries? Hee takes the Crowne, and closely hugs it to him, And smiling in his greefe he leanes upon it; Then doth hee frowne because it would forgoe him, Then softly stealing, layes his vesture on it; Then snatching at it, loth to have forgone it, Hee put it from him, yet hee will not so, And yet retaines what fayne he would forgoe. Like as a Mother over-charg'd with woe, Her onely chylde now laboring in death, Doing to helpe it, nothing yet can doe, Though with her breath, she faine would give it breath, Still saying, yet forgetting what shee sayth: Even so with poore King Edward doth it fare, Leaving his Crowne, the first-borne of his care. In thys confused conflict of the minde, Tears drowning sighes, and sighes confounding tears, Yet when as neyther any ease could finde, And extreame griefe doth somwhat harden feares, Sorrow growes sencelesse when too much she bears, Whilst speech &amp; silence, strives which place should take, With words halfe spoke, he silently bespake. I clayme no Crowne, quoth he, by vile oppression, Nor by the law of Nations have you chose mee, My Fathers title groundeth my succession, Nor in your power is cullor to depose mee, By heavens decree I stand, they must dispose mee; A lawles act, in an unlawfull thing, With-drawes allegiance, but uncrownes no King. What God hath sayd to one, is onely due, Can I usurpe by tyrannizing might? Or take what by your birth-right falls to you? Roote out your houses? blot your honors light? By publique rule, to rob your publique right? Then can you take, what he could not that gave it, Because the heavens commaunded I should have it. My Lords, quoth hee, commend me to the King, Heere doth he pause, fearing his tongue offended, Even as in child-birth forth the word doth bring, Sighing a full poynt, as he there had ended, Yet striving, as his speech he would have mended; Things of small moment we can scarcely hold, But griefes that tuch the hart, are hardly told. Heere doth he weepe, as he had spoke in tears, Calming this tempest with a shower of raine, Whispering, as he would keepe it from his ears, Doe my alegiance to my Soveraigne; Yet at this word, heere doth he pause againe: Yes say even so, quoth he, to him you beare it, If it be Edward that you meane shall weare it. Keepe hee the Crowne, with mee remaine the curse, A haplesse Father, have a happy Sonne, Take he the better, I endure the worse, The plague to end in mee, in mee begun, And better may he thrive then I have done; Let him be second Edward, and poore I, For ever blotted out of memorie. Let him account his bondage from the day That he is with the Diadem invested, A glittering Crowne doth make the haire soone gray, Within whose circle he is but arested, In all his feasts, hee's but with sorrowe feasted; And when his feete disdaine to tuch the mold, His head a prysoner, in a Jayle of gold. In numbring of his subjects, numbring care, And when the people doe with shouts begin, Then let him thinke theyr onely prayers are, That he may scape the danger he is in, The multitude, be multitudes of sin; And hee which first doth say, God save the King, Hee is the first doth newes of sorrow bring. His Commons ills shall be his private ill, His private good is onely publique care, His will must onely be as others will: Himselfe not as he is, as others are, By Fortune dar'd to more then Fortune dare: And he which may commaund an Empery, Yet can he not intreat his liberty. Appeasing tumults, hate cannot appease, Sooth'd with deceits, and fed with flatteries, Displeasing to himselfe, others to please, Obey'd as much as he shall tyrannize, Feare forcing friends, enforcing Enemies: And when hee sitteth under his estate, His foote-stoole danger, and his chayre is hate. He King alone, no King that once was one, A King that was, unto a King that is; I am unthron'd, and hee enjoyes my throne, Nor should I suffer that, nor he doe this, He takes from mee what yet is none of his; Young Edward clymes, old Edward falleth downe, King'd and unking'd, he crown'd, farwell my crowne. Princes be Fortunes chyldren, and with them, Shee deales, as Mothers use theyr babes to still, Unto her darling gives a Diadem, A pretty toy, his humor to fulfill; And when a little they have had theyr will, Looke what shee gave, shee taketh at her pleasure, Using the rod when they are out of measure. But policie, who still in hate did lurke, And yet suspecteth Edward is not sure, Waying what blood with Leicester might worke, Or else what friends his name might yet procure; A guilty conscience never is secure; From Leisters keeping cause him to be taken; Alas poore Edward, now of all forsaken. To Gurney and Matravers he is given; O let theyr act be odious to all ears, And beeing spoke, stirre clowdes to cover heaven, And be the badge the wretched murtherer bears, The wicked oth whereby the damned swears: But Edward, in thy hell thou must content thee, These be the devils which must still torment thee. Hee on a leane ilfavored beast is set, Death upon Famine moralizing right; His cheeks with tears, his head with raigne bewet, Nights very picture, wandring still by night; When he would sleep, like dreams they him affright; His foode torment, his drinke a poysoned bayne, No other comfort but in deadly paine. And yet because they feare to have him knowne, They shave away his princely tressed hayre, And now become not worth a hayre ofs owne, Body and fortune now be equall bare; Thus voyde of wealth, ô were he voyde of care. But ô, our joyes are shadowes, and deceave us, But cares, even to our deaths doe never leave us. A silly Mole-hill is his kingly chayre, With puddle water must he now be drest, And his perfume, the lothsome fenny ayre, An yron skull, a Bason fitting best, A bloody workman, suting with the rest; His lothed eyes, within thys filthy glas, Truly behold how much deform'd hee was. The drops which from his eyes abundance fall, A poole of tears still rising by this rayne, Even fighting with the water, and withall, A circled compasse makes it to retaine, Billow'd with sighes, like to a little maine; Water with tears, contending whether should Make water warme, or make the warme tears cold. Vile Traytors, hold of your unhalowed hands, The cruelst beast the Lyons presence fears: And can you keepe your Soveraigne then in bands? How can your eyes behold th'anoynteds tears? Are not your harts even pearced through your ears? The minde is free, what ere afflict the man, A King's a King, doe Fortune what shee can. Who's he can take what God himselfe hath given? Or spill that life his holy spirit infused? All powers be subject to the powers of heaven, Nor wrongs passe unreveng'd, although excused, Weepe Majestie to see thy selfe abused; O whether shall authoritie be take, When shee herselfe, herselfe doth so forsake? A wreath of hay they on his temples bind, Which when he felt, (tears would not let him see,) Nature (quoth he) now art thou onely kind, Thou giv'st, but Fortune taketh all from mee, I now perceave, that were it not for thee: I should want water, clothing for my brayne, But earth gives hay, and mine eyes give me rayne. My selfe deform'd, lyke my deformed state, My person made like to mine infamie, Altring my favour, could you alter fate, And blotting beautie, blot my memorie, You might flye slaunder, I indignitie: My golden Crowne, tooke golden rule away, A Crowne of hay, well sutes a King of hay. Yet greev'd agayne, on nature doth complayne, Nature (sayth he) ô thou art just in all, Why should'st thou then, thus strengthen me agayne, To suffer things so much unnaturall? Except thou be pertaker in my fall: And when at once so many mischiefes meete, Mak'st poyson nuterment, and bitter sweete. And now he thinks he wrongeth Fortune much, Who giveth him this great preheminence, For since by fate his myseries be such, Her worser name hath taught him pacience, For no offence, he taketh as offence: Crost on his back, and crosses in the brest, Thus is he crost, who never yet was blest. To Berckley thus they lead this wretched King, The place of horror which they had fore-thought, O heavens why suffer you so vile a thing, And can behold, this murther to be wrought, But that your wayes are all with judgement frought: Now entrest thou, poore Edward to thy hell, Thus take thy leave, and bid the world farewell. O Berckley, thou which hast beene famous long, Still let thy walls shreeke out a deadly sound, And still complayne thee of thy greevous wrong, Preserve the figure of King Edwards wound, And keepe their wretched footsteps on the ground: That yet some power againe may give them breath, And thou againe mayst curse them both to death. The croking Ravens hideous voyce he hears, Which through the Castell sounds with deadly yells, Imprinting strange imaginarie fears, The heavie Ecchoes lyke to passing bells, Chyming far off his dolefull burying knells: The jargging Casements which the fierce wind dryves, Puts him in mind of fetters, chaynes, and gyves. By silent night, the ugly shreeking Owles, Lyke dreadfull Spirits with terror doe torment him, The envious dogge, angry with darcknes howles, Lyke messengers from damned ghosts were sent him, Or with hells noysome terror to present him: Under his roofe the buzzing night-Crow sings, Clapping his windowe with her fatall wings. Death still prefigur'd in his fearefull dreames, Of raging Feinds, and Goblins that he meets, Of falling downe from steepe-rocks into streames, Of Toombs, of Graves, of Pits, of winding sheets, Of strange temptations and seducing sprits: And with his cry awak'd, calling for ayde, His hollowe voyce doth make him selfe afrayd. Oft in his sleepe he sees the Queene to flye him, Sterne Mortimer pursue him with his sword, His Sonne in sight, yet dares he not come nigh him, To whom he calls, who aunswereth not a word, And lyke a monster wondred and abhord: Widowes and Orphans following him with cryes, Stabbing his hart, and scratching out his eyes. Next comes the vision of his bloody raigne, Masking along with Lancasters sterne ghost, Of eight and twentie Barrons hang'd and slayne, Attended with the rufull mangled host, At Burton and at Borough battell lost: Threatning with frownes, and trembling every lim, With thousand thousand curses cursing him. And if it chaunce that from the troubled skyes, Some little brightnes through the chinks give light, Straight waies on heaps the thrunging clouds doe rise, As though the heaven were angry with the night. Deformed shadowes glimpsing in his sight: As though darcknes, for she more darcke would bee, Through these poore Crannells forc'd her selfe to see. Within a deepe vault under where he lay, Under buried filthie carcasses they keepe, Because the thicke walls hearing kept away, His feeling feeble, seeing ceas'd in sleepe; This lothsome stinck comes from this dungeon deepe, As though before they fully did decree, No one sence should from punishment be free. Hee haps our English Chronicle to find, On which to passe the howers he falls to reed, For minuts yet to recreate his mind, If any thought one uncar'd thought might feed, But in his breast new conflicts this doth breed: For when sorrowe, is seated in the eyes, What ere we see, increaseth miseries. Opening the Booke, he chaunced first of all On conquering Williams glorious comming in, The Normans rising, and the Bryttains fall, Noting the plague ordayn'd for Harolds sinne, How much, in how short time this Duke did winne; Great Lord (quoth hee) thy conquests plac'd thy throne, I to mine owne, have basely lost mine owne. Then comes to Rufus a lascivious King, Whose lawlesse rule on that which he enjoy'd, A sodaine end unto his dayes doth bring, Himselfe destroy'd in that which he destroy'd, None moane his death, whose lyfe had all anoy'd: Rufus (quoth he) thy fault far lesse then mine, Needs must my plague be far exceeding thine. To famous Bewclarke studiouslie he turnes, Who from Duke Robert doth the scepter wrest, Whose eyes put out, in flintie Cardiffe mornes, Robert Shortthigh Duke of Normandy. In Palestine who bare his conquering crest, Who though of Realmes, of fame not dispossest: In all afflictions this may comfort thee, Onely my shame in death remaines (quoth hee.) Then comes he next to Stephens troublous state, Plagu'd with the Empresse, in continuall warre, Yet with what patience he could beare his hate, And lyke a wise-man rule his angry starre, Stopping the wheele of Fortunes giddie carre: O thus (quoth he) had gracelesse Edward done, He had not now beene Subject to his Sonne. Then to Henry Plantaginet he goes, Two Kings at once, two Crown'd at once doth find, The roote from whence so many mischiefes rose, The Fathers kindnes makes the Sonne unkind, Th'ambitious Brothers to debate inclind: Thou crown'st thy Sonne, yet living still do'st raigne, Mine uncrownes me (quoth he) yet am I slaine. Then of couragious Lyon-hart he reeds, The Souldans terror, and the Pagans wrack, The Easterne world fild with his glorious deeds, Of Joppas siege, of Cipres wofull sack, Richard (quoth hee) turning his dull eyes back: Thou did'st in height of thy felicitie, I in the depth of all my miserie. Then by degrees to sacriligious John, Murthering young Arthur, hath usurp'd his right, The Cleargies curse, the poors oppression, The greevous crosses that on him did light, To Rooms proud yoke yeelding his awfull might: Even by thy end (he sayth) now John I see, Gods judgements thus doe justly fall on mee. Then, to long-raigning Winchester his Sonne, With whom his people bloody warre did wage, And of the troubles in his time begunne, The head-strong Barrons wrath, the Commons rage, And yet how he these tumults could aswage: Thou livest long, (quoth he) longer thy name, And I dye soone, yet over-live my fame. Then to great Longshanks mighty victories, Who in the Orcads fix'd his Countries mears, And dar'd in fight our fayths proud Enemies, Which to his name eternall Trophies rears, Whose gracefull favors yet faire England wears: Bee't deadly sinne (quoth he) once to defile, This Fathers name with me a Sonne so vile. Following the leafe, he findeth unawars, What day young Edward Prince of Wales was borne, Which Letters seeme lyke Magick Charrecters, Or to dispight him they were made in scorne, O let that name (quoth he) from Books be torne: Least that in time, the very greeved earth, Doe curse my Mothers woombe, and ban my birth. Say that King Edward never had such child, Or was devour'd as hee in cradle lay, Be all men from my place of birth exil'd, Let it be sunck, or swallowed with some sea, Let course of yeeres devoure that dismall day, Let all be doone that power can bring to passe, Onely be it forgot that ere I was. The globy tears impearled in his eyes, Through which as glasses hee is forc'd to looke, Make letters seeme as circles which arise, Forc'd by a stone within a standing Brooke, And at one time, so divers formes they tooke, Which like to uglie Monsters doe affright, And with their shapes doe terrifie his sight. Thus on his carefull Cabin falling downe, Enter the Actors of his tragedy, Opening the doores, which made a hollow soune, As they had howl'd against theyr crueltie, Or of his paine as they would prophecie; To whom as one which died before his death, He yet complaynes, whilst paine might lend him breath. O be not Authors of so vile an act, To bring my blood on your posteritie, That Babes even yet unborne doe curse the fact, I am a King, though King of miserie, I am your King, though wanting Majestie: But he who is the cause of all this teene, Is cruell March the Champion of the Queene. He hath my Crowne, he hath my Sonne, my wyfe, And in my throne tryumpheth in my fall, Is't not inough but he will have my lyfe? But more, I feare that yet this is not all, I thinke my soule to judgement he will call: And in my death his rage yet shall not dye, But persecute me so, immortallie. And for you deadly hate me, let me live, For that advantage angrie heaven hath left, Fortune hath taken all that she did give; Yet that revenge should not be quite bereft, Shee leaves behind this remnant of her theft: That miserie should find that onely I, Am far more wretched then is miserie. Betwixt two beds these devils straight enclos'd him, Thus done, uncovering of his secrete part, When for his death they fitly had disposd him, With burning yron thrust him to the hart. O payne beyond all paine, how much thou art! Which words, as words, may verbally confesse, But never pen precisely could expresse. O let his tears even freezing as they light, By the impression of his monstrous payne, Still keepe this odious spectacle in sight, And shew the manner how the King was slaine, That it with ages may be new againe; That all may thether come that have beene told it, And in that mirror of his griefes behold it. Still let the building sigh his bitter grones, And with a hollow cry his woes repeate, That sencelesse things even moving sencelesse stones, With agonizing horror still may sweat; And as consuming in their furious heate, Like boyling Cauldrons be the drops that fall, Even as that blood for vengeance still did call. O let the wofull Genius of the place, Still haunt the pryson where his life was lost: And with torne hayre, and swolne ilfavored face, Become the guide to his revengefull ghost, And night and day still let them walke the Coast: And with incessant howling terrifie, Or moove with pitty all that travell by. True vertuous Lady, now of mirth I sing, To sharpen thy sweet spirit with some delight, And somwhat slack this mellancholie string, Whilst I of love and tryumphs must indite, Too soone againe of passion must I write. Of Englands wonder, now I come to tell, How Mortimer first rose, when Edward fell. Downe lesser lights, the glorious Sunne doth clime, His joyfull rising is the worlds proude morne; Now is he got betwixt the wings of Tyme, And with the tyde of Fortune forwards borne, Good starrs assist his greatnes to subborne; Who have decreed his raigning for a while, All laugh on him, on whom the heavens doe smile. The pompous sinode of these earthly Gods, At Salsbury, appointed by their King, To set all even which had been at ods, And into fashion, their dissignes to bring, That peace might now from their proceedings spring, And to establish what they had begun, Under whose cullour mighty things were done. Heere Mortimer is Earle of March created, Thys honor added to his Barronie, And unto fame heere is he consecrated, That titles might his greatnes dignifie, As for the rest, he easely could supply. Who knew a kingdom to her lap was throwne, Which having all, would never starve her owne. A pleasing calme hath smooth'd the troubled sea, The prime brought on with gentle falling showers, The misty breake yet proves a goodly day; And on their heads since heaven her largesse powers, Thats onely ours, which we doe use as ours: Pleasures be poore, and our delights be dead, When as a man doth not enjoy the head. Tyme wanting bounds, still wanteth certainty, Of dangers past, in peace wee love to heare, Short is the date of all extreamity, Long wished things a sweet delight doth beare, Better forgoe our joyes then still to feare: Fortune her gifts in vaine to such doth gyve, As when they live, seeme as they did not live. Now stand they like the two starre-fixed Poles, Betwixt the which the circling Spheres doe move, About whose Axeltree thys fayre Globe roules, Which that great Moover by his strength doth shove, Yet every poynt still ending in theyr love; For might is ever absolute alone, When of two powers there's true conjunction. The King must take, what by theyr power they give, And they protect what serves for theyr protection, They teach to rule, whilst he doth learne to live, T'whom all be subject, lives in theyr subjection, Though borne to rule, yet crown'd by their election, Th'alegiance which to Edward doth belong, Doth make theyr faction absolutely strong. Twelve guide the King, his power theyr powers consist, Peers guide the King, they guide both King and Peers, Ill can the Brooke his owne selfe-streame resist, Theyr aged counsell, to his younger yeeres, Young Edward vowes, and all the while he steers; Wel might we think the man were more then blind, Which wanted Sea roomth, and could rule the wind. In lending strength, theyr strength they still retaine, Building his force, theyr owne they so repare, Under his raigne, in safety they doe raigne, They give a kingdome, and doe keepe the care, They who adventure, must the booty share, A Princes wealth in spending still doth spred, Like to a Poole with many fountaines fed. They sit at ease, though he sit in the throne, He shaddowes them who his supporters be, And in division they be two for one, An Empyre now must thus be rul'd by three, What they make free, they challenge to be free; The King enjoyeth, but what they lately gave, They priviledg'd to spend, leave him to save. Nine-score brave Knights belonging to his Court Mortimer nine-score Knights in his retinue.At Notingham, which all the Coast commaunds, All parts pay trybute, honor to his port, Much may he doe which hath so many hands, This rocke-built Castell, over-looks the Lands: Thus lyke a Gyant, still towards heaven doth ryse, And fayne would cast the Rocks against the skyes. Where ere he goes there pompe in tryumph goes, Over his head Fame soring still doth flye, Th'earth in his presence decks her selfe in showes, And glory sits in greatest Majestie, Aboundance there doth still in Child-bed lye: For where Fortune her bountie will bestowe, There heaven and earth must pay what she doth owe. In Notingham, the Norths great glorious eye, Crowne of the beautious branch-embellish'd soyle, The throne emperiall of his Emperie, His resting place, releever of his toyle, Here he enjoyes his never-prized spoyle: There lyving in a world of all delight, Beheld of all, and having all in sight. Here all along the flower-enameld vales, Cleere Trent upon the pearly sand doth slide, And to the Meadowes telling wanton tales, Her christall lims lasciviously in pride, With thousand turnes shee casts from side to side: As loth shee were the sweet soyle to forsake, And throw her selfe into the German lake. Whence great hart-harboring Sherwood wildly roves, Whose leavie Forrests garlanding her Towers, Shadowing the small Brooks with her Ecchoing groves, Whose thick-plashd sides repulse the Northerne showers, Where Nature sporting in her secret Bowers: This strong built Castell hurketh in her shade, As to this end she onely had beene made. There must the glorious Parliament be held, Earth must come in, when awfull heaven doth send, For whether Jove his powerfull selfe doth weld, Thether all powers them selves must wholly bend, Whose hand holds thunder, who dare him offend? And where proud conquest keepeth all in awe, Kings oft are forc'd in servile yokes to drawe Heere sit they both under the rich estate, Yet neither strive the upper hand to get, In pompe and power both equall at a rate, And as they came, so are they friendly set, He entreth first, which first in entring met; A King at least the Earle of March must be, Or else the maker of a King is hee. Perhaps, he with a smyle the King will grace, His knees growe stiffe, they have forgot to bow, And if he once have taken up his place, Edward must come, if he his will would know, A foote out of his seate he cannot goe; Thys small word subject, pricks him like a sting, My Empyres Colleage, or my fellow King. O had felicity feeling of woe, Or could on meane but moderatly feede, Or would looke downe the way that he must goe, Or could abstaine from what diseases breede, To stop the wound before to death he bleede, Warre should not fill Kings Pallaces with moane, Nor perrill come when tis least thought upon. Ambition with the Eagle loves to build, Nor on the Mountayne dreads the winters blast, But with selfe-soothing doth the humor guild, With arguments correcting what is past, Fore-casting Kingdomes, daungers unforecast: Leaving this poore word of content to such, Whose earthly spirits have not his fierie tuch. But pleasures never dine but on excesse, Whose dyet made to drawe on all delight, And overcome in that sweet drunkennes, His appetite maintayned by his sight, Strengthneth desier, but ever weakneth might: Untill this ulcer ripening to a head, Vomits the poyson which it nourished. Even as a flood swelling beyond his bounds, Doth over-presse the channell where he flowd, And breaking forth, the neighbour Meadows drowns, That of him selfe, him selfe doth quite unload, Dispearcing his owne greatnes all abroad: Spending the store he was maintayned by, Empties his Brooke, and leaves his Channell dry. Upon this Subject, envie might devise, Here might she proove her mischeefe-working wings, An object for her ever-waking eyes, Wherein to stick a thousand deadly stings, A ground whereon to build as many things: For where our actions measure no regard, Our lawlesse will is made his owne reward. Here vengeance calls destruction up from hell, Conjuring mischeefe to devise a curse, Increasing that, which more and more did swell, Adding to ill, to make this evill worse, Whilst hatefull pride becomes ambitions nurse: T'is incedent to those whom many feare, Many to them more greevous hate doe beare. And now those fewe which many tears had spent, And long had wept on olde King Edwards grave, Find some begin to pittie their lament, Wishing the poore yet some redresse might have, Revenge cannot denie what death doth crave: Opening their eares what so abhord their eyes, Ill will too soone regardeth envies cryes. Time calls account of what before is past, All thrust on mallice pressing to be hard, Unto misfortune all men goe too fast, Seldome, advantage is in wrongs debard, Nor in revenge a meane is never spard: For when once pryde but poynteth towards his fall, He bears a sword to wound him selfe with all. Edward whose shoulders now were taught to peyze, Briarius burthen, which opprest him so, His current stop'd with these outragious Seas, Whose gulfe receav'd the tyde should make him flowe, This Rocke cast in the way where he must goe: That honor brooks, no fellowship hath tryde, Nor never Crowne Corrivall could abyde. Some urge that March, meaning by blood to rise, First cut off Kent, fearing he might succeed, Trayning the King to what he did devise, Lymming in cullors this unlawfull deed, And to his owne, the royall blood to weed: Thus every strawe prooves fewell to the fier, When counsell doth concurre with our desier. All fence the tree which serveth for a shade, Whose great growne body doth repulse the wind, Untill his wastfull branches doe invade, The straighter plants, and them in pryson bind, Then lyke a foule devower of his kind: Unto his roote all put their hands to hewe, Whose roomth but hinder other which would grow. Greatnes, lyke to the Sunnes reflecting powers, The fen-bred vapours naturally exhales, And is the cause that oft the evening lowers, When foggie mists enlarge their duskie sailes, That his owne beams, he in the clouds impales: And eyther must extinguish his owne light, Or by his vertue cause his propper night. Of winter thus whilst they prognosticate, He hath the Sommer, and a fruitfull yeare, And still is soothed by his flattering fate, For still the starre which guides him doth appeare; Hee looks far off, yet sees not daunger neare: For oft we see before a sodaine shower, The sunne shines hott'st, and hath the greatest power. Now sphears with Musick make a new worlds birth, Bring on againe olde Saturns golden raigne, Renewe this wearie barren-wombed earth, And rayse aloft the sunnes declyning wayne, And by your power make all things young agayne: Orpheus, once more to Thebes olde Forrests bring, Drinke Nectar, whilst the Gods are banquetting. Within this Castell had the Queene devisd, A stately Chamber with the pensill wrought, Within whose compasse was imparadizd, What ever Arte or rare invention taught, As well might seeme far to exceed all thought: That were the thing on earth to move delight, He should not want it to content his sight. Heere Phœbus clipping Hiacynthus stood, Whose lyves last drops, his snowie breast imbrewe, Mixing his christall tears with purple blood, As were it blood or tears, none scarcely knewe, Yet blood and tears, one from the other drewe: The little wood-nimphs chafing him with balme, To rayse this sweet Boy from this deadly qualme. Here lyes his Lute, his Quiver, and his bowe, His golden mantle on the greene-spred ground, That from the things themselves none could them know, The sledge so shadowed, still seem'd to rebound, Th'wound beeing made, yet still to make a wound: The purple flower with letters on the leaves, Springing that Nature, oft her selfe deceaves. The milke-white Heifor, Io, Joves faire rape, Viewing her new-ta'en figure in a Brooke, The water seeming to retayne the shape, Which lookes on her, as shee on it doth looke, That gazing eyes oft-times them selves mistooke: By prospective devis'd that looking nowe, Shee seem'd a Mayden, then againe a Cowe. Then Mercurie amidst his sweetest joyes, Sporting with Hebe by a Fountayne brim, Clipping each other with lascivious toyes, And each to other lapped lim to lim, On tufts of flowers which loosely seeme to swim: Which flowers in sprinckled drops doe still appeare, As all their bodies so embraudered were. Heere clyffy Cynthus, with a thousand byrds, Whose checkerd plumes adorne his tufted crowne, Under whose shadow graze the stragling heards, Out of whose top, the fresh springs trembling downe, Duly keepe time with theyr harmonious sowne. The Rock so lively done in every part, As arte had so taught nature, nature arte. The naked Nymphes, some up, some downe discending, Small scattering flowers one at another flung, With pretty turns their lymber bodies bending, Cropping the blooming branches lately sprong, Which on the Rocks grewe heere and there among. Some combe theyr hayre, some making garlands by, As living, they had done it actually. And for a trayle, Caisters silver Lake, Whose heards of Swanns sit pruning on a row, By their much whitenes, such reflection make, As though in Sommer had been falne a snow, Whose streame an easie breath doth seeme to blowe; Which on the sparkling gravell runns in purles, As though the waves had been of silver curles. Here falls proude Phaeton, tumbling through the clowds, The sunny Palfreys have their traces broke, And setting fire upon the welked shrowds, Now through the heaven flye gadding from the yoke, The Sphears all reeking with a mistie smoke, Drawne with such life, as some did much desire To warme themselves, some frighted with the fire. And Drencht in Po, the River seemes to burne, His wofull sisters, mourning there he sees, Trees unto women seeme themselves to turne, Or rather women turned into trees, Drops from their boughs, or tears fall from their eyes, That fire seem'd to be water, water flame, Eyther or neyther, and yet both the same. A stately Bed under a golden tree, Whose broad-leav'd branches covering over all, Spread their large Armes like to a Canapy, Dubbling themselves in their lascivious fall, Upon whose top the flying Cupids spraule, And some, at sundry cullored byrds doe shute, Some swarving up to get the golden fruite. A counterpoynt of Tyssue, rarely wrought, Like to Arachnes web, of the Gods rape, Which with his lifes strange history is wrought, The very manner of his hard escape, From poynt to poynt, each thing in perfect shape, As made the gazers thinke it there was done, And yet time stayd in which it was begun. During thys calme, is gather'd that black showre, Whose uglie clowde the clyme had over-spred, And now drawes on that long death-dating howre, His fatall starre now hangeth o're his head, His fortunes sunne downe towards the evening fled, For when we thinke we most in safety stand, Great'st dangers then are ever near'st at hand. And Edward sees no meanes can ever boote, Unlesse thys head-strong course he may restraine, And must pluck up these mischiefs by the roote, Els spred so farre, might easely grow againe, And end theyr raigne, if he doe meane to raigne; The Common-weale to cure, brought to that passe, Which like a many-headed Monster was. But sith he finds the danger to be such, To bring this Beare once bayted to the stake, And that he feeles the forwardest to gruch, To take in hand this sleeping dog to wake, He must fore-think of some such course to take, By which he might his purpose thus effect, And hurt him most, where he might least suspect. A trenched vault deepe in the earth is found, Whose hollownes, like to the Sleep-gods Cell, With strange Meanders turneth under ground, Where pitchy darknes ever-more doth dwell, As well might be an entrance into hell. Which Archyteckts, to serve the Castell made, When as the Dane with warrs did all invade. Heere silent night, as in a pryson shrowded, Wandreth about within thys mazed roome, With filthy fogs, and earthly vapors clowded, As shee were buried in this cliffy toombe, Or yet unborne within the earths great woombe. A dampy breath comes from the moysted vaines, As shee had sigh'd through trouble in her paines. Now on a long this cranckling path doth keepe, Then by a rock turnes up another way, Then rising up, shee poynteth towards the deepe, As the ground levell, or unlevell lay, Nor in his course keepes any certaine stay, Till in the Castell in a secret place, He suddainly unmaske his duskie face. The King now with a strong selected crue, Of such as he with his intent acquainted, And well affected to thys action knew, Nor in revenge of Edward never fainted, Whose loyall fayth had never yet beene tainted, This Labyrinth determins to assay, To rouze the beast which kept him thus at bay. The blushing Sunne, plucks in his smyling beames, Making his steeds to mend theyr wonted pace, Till plunging downe into the Ocean streames, There in the frothy waves he hides his face, Then reynes them in, more then his usuall space, And leaves foule darknes to possesse the skyes, A time most fit for fouler tragedies. With Torches now they enter on his Cave, As night were day, and day were turnd to night, Damp'd with the foyle one to the other gave, Light hating darknes, darknes hating light, As enemies, each with the other fight; And each confounding other, both appeare, As darknes light, and light but darknes were. The craggy cleeves, which crosse them as they goe, Seeme as their passage they would have denied, And threatning them, their journey to for-slowe, As angry with the path that was their guide, Cursing the hand which did them first devide, Theyr combrous falls and risings seem'd to say, Thys wicked action could not brooke the day. These gloomy Lamps, by which they on were led, Making theyr shaddowes follow at theyr back, Which like to Mourners, waite upon the dead, And as the deed, so are they ugly black, Like to the dreadfull Images of wrack; These poore dym-burning lights, as all amazed, As those deformed shades whereon they gazed. Theyr clattering Armes, their Masters seeme to chyde, As they would reason wherefore they should wound, And striking with the poynts from side to side, As they were angry with the hollow ground, Whose stony roofe lock'd in their dolefull sound: And hanging in the creeks, draw backe againe, As willing them from murther to refraine. Now, after masks and gallant revelings, The Queene unto the Chamber is with-drawne, To whom a cleer-voyc'd Eunuch playes and sings; And underneath a Canapy of Lawne, Sparkling with pearle, like to the cheerfull dawne, Leaning upon the breast of Mortimer, Whose voice more then the musick pleasd her eare. A smock wrought with the purest Affrick silke, A worke so fine, as might all worke refine, Her breast like strains of violets in milk, O be thou hence-forth Beauties living shrine, And teach things mortall to be most divine. Enclose Love in thys Labyrinth about, Where let him wander still, yet ne're get out. Her golden hayre, ah gold, thou art too base, Were it not sinne but once to name it hayre, Falling as it would kisse her fairer face, But no word fayre enough for thing so fayre, Invention is too bare, to paynt her bare; But where the pen fayles, Pensill cannot show it, Nor can be knowne, unlesse the minde doe knowe it. Shee layes those fingers on his manly cheeke, The Gods pure scepters, and the darts of love, Which with one tuch might make a Tyger meeke, Or might an Atlas easely remove: That lilly hand, rich Natures wedding glove, Which might beget life where was never none, And put a spirit into the hardest stone. The fire of precious wood, the lights perfume, Whose perfect cleernes, on the painting shone, As every thing with sweetnes would consume, And every thing had sweetnes of his owne, The smell where-with they liv'd, &amp; alwaies growne, That light gave cullour on each thing it fell, And to that cullour, the perfume gave smell. Upon the sundry pictures they devise, And from one thing they to an other runne, Now they commend that body, then those eyes, How well that byrd, how well that flower was done, The lively counterfetting of that sunne: The cullors, the conceits, the shadowings, And in that Arte a thousand sundrie things. Looking upon proud Phaeton wrapd in fier, The gentle Queene doth much bewaile his fall, But Mortimer more praysing his desier, To loose his lyfe or else to governe all: And though (quoth he) he now be Fortunes thrall, This must be sayd of him when all is done, Hee perrish'd in the Chariot of the Sunne. Glaunsing upon Ixion, shee doth smile, Who for his Juno tooke the cloud amisse; Madam (quoth hee) thus women can beguile, And oft we find in love, this error is, Why friend (quoth shee) thy hap is lyke to his: That booteth not (quoth he) were he as I, Jove would have beene in monstrous jealousie. (Shee sayth) Phœbus is too much forc'd by Art, Nor can shee find how his imbraces bee: But Mortimer now takes the Paynters part, Tis even thus great Empresse, so (quoth hee) Thus twyne their armes, and thus their lips you see: You Phœbus are, poore Hiacinthus I, Kisse mee till I revive, and now I die. By this into the uttermost stately hall, Is rudely entred this disordred rout, And they within suspecting least of all, Provide no guard to watch on them without, Thus danger falls oft-times, when least we doubt: In perrill thus we thinke our selves most sure, And oft in death fond men are most secure. His trustie Nevill, and young Turrington, Courting the Ladies, frolick voyd of feare, Staying delights whilst time away doth runne, What rare Emprezas hee and he did beare, Thus in the Lobby whilst they sporting weare: Assayld on sudaine by this hellish trayne, Both in the entrance miserably slayne. Even as from snow-topd Skidos frostie cleeves, Some Norway Haggard, to her pitch doth tower, And downe amongst the moore-bred Mallard drives, And through the aire, right down the wind doth scower, Commaunding all that lye within her power: Even such a skreame is hard within the vault, Made by the Ladies at the first assault. March hath no armes, but the Queene in his armes, To fayre a sheeld to beare their fouler blowes, Enchayning his strong armes, in her sweet armes, Inclosing them which oft did her inclose, O had he had but weapons lyke his woes: Her presence had redoubled then his might, To lyve and dye both in his soveraigns sight. Villains (quoth hee) I doe protect the King, Why Centaure-lyke doe you disturbe me this, And interrupt the Gods at banquetting, Where sacred Himen ever present is, And pleasures are imparadizd in blis: Where all they powers, their earthly heaven would take, If heere on earth they their abode should make. Her presence pardons the offenders ill, And makes the basest earthly thing divine, Ther's no decree can countermaund her will, Shee like the Sunne, doth blesse where she doth shine, Her Chamber is the most unspotted shrine: How sacriligiously dare you despise, And thus prophane these halowed liberties. But Edward, if this enterprize be thine, And thou an Actor heere do'st play thy part, I tell thee then base King thy Crowne was mine, And thou a King but of my making art. And now poore worme since thou hast taken hart, Thou would'st hew downe that pillar unto wrack, Which hath sustaynd Olimpus on his back. What can he doe, that is so hard beset? The heaven-threatning Gyants, heaven could tame, Proud Mars is bound within an yron net, Alcides burnt in Nessus poysned flame, Great Jove can shake the universall frame: He that was wont to call his sword to ayde, Tis hard with him, when he must stand to plead. O hadst thou in thy glory thus beene slayne, All thy delights had beene of easie rate, But now thy fame yet never tuch'd with stayne, Must thus be branded with thy haplesse fate, No man is happie till his lyfes last date: His pleasures must be of a dearer price, Poore Adam driven out of Paradice. Halfe drownd in tears, she followes him: ô tears, Elixar like, turne all to pearle you weet, To weepe with her, the building scarce forbears, Stones Metamorphizd tuch'd but with her feete, And make the ayre for everlasting sweet: Wringing her hands with pittious shreeking cries, Thus utters shee her hard extreamities. Edward (quoth shee) let not his blood be shed, Each drop of it is more worth then thy Crowne, What Region is in Europe limitted, Where doth not shine, the Sunne of his renowne? His sword hath set Kings up, &amp; thrown them downe: Thou knowst that Empires never have confind, The large-spred bounds of his unconquer'd mind. And if thou feed'st upon thy Fathers wrongs, Make not revenge, to bring revenge on thee, What torture thou inflict'st, to me belongs, And what is due to death, is due to mee, Imagine that his wounds fresh bleeding bee: Forget thy birth, thy crowne, thy love, thy Mother, And in this breast thy sword in vengeance smother. O let my hands held up appease this stryfe, O let these knees at which thou oft hast stood, Now kneele to thee, to beg my lyves true lyfe, This wombe that bare thee, breast that gave thee food, Or let my blood yet purchase his deere blood: O let my tears which never thing could force, Constraynd by this, yet move thee to remorce. But all in vaine, still Edwards ghost appears, And cryes revenge, revenge, unto his Sonne, And now the voyce of wofull Kent hee hears, And bids him followe what he had begun, Nor will they rest till execution done: The very sight of him he deadly hated, Sharpens the edge, his Mothers tears rebated. To London now a wofull prisoner led, London where he had tryumph'd with the Queene, He followeth now, whom many followed, And scarce a man, who many men had beene, Seeing with greefe who had in pompe been seene: Those eyes which oft have at his greatnes gazed, Now at his fall must stand as all amazed. Oh misery, where once thou art possest, How soone thy faynt infection alters kind, And lyke a Cyrce turnest man to beast, And with the body do'st transforme the mind, That can in fetters our affections bind: That he whose back once bare the Lyons skin, Whipt to his taske, with Iole must spin. Edward and March unite your angry spirits, Become new friends of auncient Enemies, Hee was thy death, and he thy death inherits, How well you consort in your miseries, And in true time tune your adversities: Fortune gave him, what shee to Edward gave, Not so much as thy end but he will have. At Westminster a Parliament decreed, Under pretence of safetie to the Crowne, Where to his fatall end they now proceed, All working hard to dig this Mountayne downe, With his owne greatnes that is over-growne: The King, the Earle of Kent, the Spensers fall, Upon his head with vengeance thundring all. The death of Edward never is forgot, The five Articles whereupon Mortimer is condemned. The signe at Stanhope to the Enemies, Jone of the Towers marriage to the Scot, The Spensers coyne seaz'd to his treasuries, Th'assuming of the wards and Lyveries: These Articles they urge which might him greeve, Which for his creed, he never did beleeve. Oh dire revenge, when thou in time art rak'd From out the ashes which preserve thee long, And lightly from thy cinders art awak'd, Fuell to feed on, and reviv'd with wrong, How soone from sparks the greatest flames are sprong: Which doth by Nature to his top aspire, Whose massie greatnes once kept downe his fier. Debar'd from speech to aunswere in his case, His judgment publique, and his sentence past, The day of death set downe, the time, and place, And thus the lot of all his fortune cast, His hope so slowe, his end draw on so fast: With pen and ynke, his drooping spirit to wake, Now of the Queene his leave he thus doth take. Most mighty Empresse, daine thou to peruse These Swan-like Dirges of a dying man: Not like those Sonnets of my youthfull Muse, In that sweet season when our love began, When at the Tylt thy princely glove I wan: Whereas my thundring Courser forward set, Made fire to flie from Herfords Burgonet. Thys King which thus makes hast unto my death, Madam, you know, I lov'd him as mine owne, And when I might have grasped out his breath, I set him easely in his Fathers throne, And forc'd the rough stormes backe when they have blowne; But these forgot, &amp; all the rest forgiven, Our thoughts must be continually on heaven. And for the Crowne whereon so much he stands, Came bastard William but himselfe on shore? Or had he not our Fathers conquering hands, Which in the field our houses Ensigne bore, Which his proude Lyons for theyr safety wore, Which rag'd at Hastings like that furious Lake, From whose sterne waves our glorious name we take? Oh had he charg'd me mounted on that horse Whereon I march'd before the walls of Gaunt, And with my Launce there shewd an English force, Or vanquisht me, a valiant combattant, Then of his conquest had he cause to vaunt; But he whose eyes durst not behold my shield, Perceiv'd my Chamber fitter then the field. I have not served Fortune like a slave, My minde hath suted with her mightines, I have not hid her tallent in a grave, Nor burying of her bounty made it lesse: My fault to God and heaven I must confesse; He twise offends, who sinne in flattery beares, Yet every howre he dyes, which ever feares. I cannot quake at that which others feare, Fortune and I have tugg'd together so; What Fate imposeth, we perforce must beare, And I am growne familiar with my woe, Used so oft against the streame to row; Yet my offence my conscience still doth grieve, Which God (I trust) in mercy will forgive. I am shut up in silence, nor must speake, Nor Kingdoms lease my life, but I must die, I cannot weepe and if my hart should breake, Nor am I sencelesse of my misery, My hart so full, hath made mine eyes so dry; I neede not cherrish griefes, too fast they grow, Woe be to him that dies of his owne woe. I pay my life, and then the debt is payd, With the reward, th'offence is purg'd and gone, The stormes will calme when once the spirit is layd; Envy doth cease, wanting to feede upon, We have one life, and so our death is one, Nor in the dust mine honor I inter, Thus Cæsar dyed, and thus dies Mortimer. Live sacred Empresse, and see happie dayes, Be ever lov'd, with me die all our hate, Let never ages sing but of thy praise, My blood shall pacifie the angry Fate, And cancell thus our sorrowes long-liv'd date: And treble ten times longer last thy fame, Then that strong Tower thou calledst by my name. To Nottingham this Letter brought unto her, Which is endorsed with her glorious stile, Shee thinks the title yet againe doth wooe her, And with that thought her sorrowes doth beguile. Smyling on that, thinks that on her doth smyle; Shee kissing it, (to countervaile her paine,) Tuching her lip, it gives the kisse againe. Faire workmanship, quoth she, of that faire hand, All-mooving organ, sweet spheare-tuning kay, The Messenger of Joves sleep-charming wand, Pully which draw'st the curtaine of the Day, Pure Trophies, reard to guide on valurs way, What paper-blessing Charrecters are you, Whose lovely forme, that lovelier engine drew? Turning the Letter, seal'd shee doth it find, With those rich Armes borne by his glorious name, Where-with this dreadfull evidence is sign'd: O badge of honour, greatest marke of fame, Brave shield, quoth she, which once from heaven came, Fayre robe of tryumph, Joves celestiall state, To all immortall prayses consecrate. Going about to rip the sacred seale, Which cleaves, least clowdes too soone should dim her eyes, As loth it were her sorrowes to reveale, Quoth shee, thy Maister taught thee secrecies: The soft waxe, with her fingers tuch doth rise, Shee asketh it, who taught thee thus to kisse? I know, quoth she, thy Maister taught thee thys? Opening the Letter, Empresse shee doth reed, At which a blush from her faire cheekes arose, And with Ambrozia still, her thoughts doth feed, And with a seeming joy doth paint her woes, Then to subscribed Mortimer shee goes; March following it, ô March, great March she cryes, Which speaking word, even seemingly replyes. Thus hath shee ended, yet shee must begin, Even as a fish playing with a bayted hooke, Now shee begins to swallow sorrow in, And Death doth shewe himselfe at every looke, Now reads shee in her lives accounting Booke: And findes the blood of her lost friend had payd, The deepe expenses which shee forth had layd. Now with an host of wofull words assayl'd, As every letter wounded lyke a dart, As every one would boast, which most prevayl'd, And every one would pierce her to the hart, Rethoricall in woe, and using Art: Reasons of greefe, each sentence doth infer, And evere lyne, a true remembrancer. Greefe makes her read, yet greefe still bids her leave, Ore-charg'd with greefe, she neither sees nor heares, Her sorrowes doe her sences quite deceave, The words doe blind her eyes, the sound her eares, And now for vescues doth she use her teares: And when a lyne shee loosely over-past, The drops doe tell her where shee left the last. O now she sees, was ever such a sight? And seeing, curs'd her sorrow-seeing eye, And sayth, shee is deluded by the light, Or is abus'd by the Orthography: Or poynted false, her schollershyp to try. Thus when we fondly sooth our owne desires, Our best conceits doe proove the greatest lyers. Her trembling hand, as in a Fever shakes, Wherwith the paper doth a little stirre, Which shee imagins, at her sorrow quakes, And pitties it who shee thinks pitties her: And moning it, bids it that greefe refer; Quoth shee, Ile raine downe showers of tears on thee, When I am dead, weepe them againe on mee. Quoth shee, with odors were thy body burned, As is Th'arabian byrd against the sunne, Againe from cynders yet thou should'st be turned, And so thy life another age should runne, Nature envying it so soone was done: Amongst all byrds, one onely of that straine, Amongst all men, one Mortimer againe. I will preserve thy ashes in some Urne, Which as a relique, I will onely save, Which mixed with my tears as I doe mourne, Within my stomack shall theyr buriall have, Although deserving a farre better grave; Yet in that Temple shall they be preserved, Where, as a Saint thou ever hast been served. Be thou trans-form'd unto some sacred tree, Whose precious gum may cure the fainting hart, Or to some hearbe yet turned mayst thou be, Whose juyce apply'd may ease the strongest smart, Or flower, whose leaves thy vertues may impart, Or stellified on Pegase loftie crest, Or shyning on the Nemian Lyons brest. I thinke the Gods could take them mortall shapes, As all the world may by thy greatnes gather, And Jove in some of his light wanton scapes, Committed pretty cusnage with thy father, Or else thou wholy art celestiall rather: Els never could it be, so great a minde, Could seated be, in one of earthly kind. And if, as some affirme, in every starre, There be a world, then must some world be thine, Else shall thy ghost invade their bounds with warre, If such can mannage armes as be devine, That here thou hadst no world, the fault was mine: And gracelesse Edward kinling all this fier, Trod in the dust of his unhappy sier. It was not Charles that made Charles what he was, Whereby he quickly to that greatnes grew, Nor strooke such terror which way he did passe, Nor our olde Grand-siers glory did renew, But it thy valure was, which Charles well knew: Which hath repulst his Enemies with feare, When they but heard the name of Mortimer. In Books and Armes consisted thy delight, And thy discourse of Campes, and grounds of state, No Apish fan-bearing Hermophradite, Coch-carried midwyfe, weake, effeminate, Quilted and ruft, which manhood ever hate: A Cato when in counsell thou didst sit, A Hercules in executing it. Now shee begins to curse the King her Sonne, The Earle of March then comes unto her mind, Then shee with blessing ends what shee begun, And leaves the last part of the curse behind, Then with a vowe shee her revenge doth bind: Unto that vowe shee ads a little oth, Thus blessing cursing, cursing blessing both. For pen and inke shee calls her mayds without, And Edwards dealing will in greefe discover, But straight forgetting what shee went about, Shee now begins to write unto her lover, Yet interlyning Edwards threatnings over: Then turning back to read what shee had writ, Shee teyrs the paper, and condemnes her wit. Thus with the pangs out of this traunce areysed, As water some-time wakeneth from a swound, Comes to her selfe the agonie apeysed, As when the blood is cold, we feele the wound, And more, and more, sith she the cause had found, Thus unto Edward with revenge shee goes, And hee must beare the burthen of her woes. I would my lap had beene some cruell Racke, His Cradell Phalaris burning-bellyed Bull, And Nessus shyrt beene put upon his backe, His Blanket of some Nilus Serpents wooll, His Dug with juice of Acconite beene full: The song which luld him, when to sleepe he fell, Some Incantation or some Magique spell. And thus King Edward since thou art my Child, Some thing of force to thee I must bequeath, March of my harts true love hath thee beguild, My curse unto thy bosome doe I breath, And heere invoke the wretched spirits beneath: To see all things perform'd to my intent, Make them ore-seers of my Testament. And thus within these mighty walls inclos'd, Even as the Owles so hatefull of the light, Unto repentance ever more dispos'd, Heere spend my dayes untill my last dayes night; And hence-forth odious unto all mens sight, Flye every small remembrance of delight, A penitentiall mournfull convertite. FINIS. TO THE MAIESTIE OF KING JAMES. A gratulatorie Poem by Michaell Drayton. The hopefull raigne of a most happy King, Loe thus excites our early Muse to sing, Of her own strength which boldly thus presumes, That's yet unimpt with any borowed plumes, A Counsailes wisdome, and their grave fore-sight, Lends me this luster, and resplendent light: Whose well-prepared pollicie, and care, For theyr indoubted Soveraigne so prepare, Other vaine titles strongly to withstand, Plac'd in the bosome of a peacefull Land: That blacke destruction which now many a day, Had fix'd her sterne eye for a violent pray, Frustrate by their great providence and power, Her very nerves is ready to devoure, And even for griefe downe sincking in a swound Beats her snak'd head against the verdant ground. But whilst the ayre thus thunders with the noise, Perhaps unheard, why should I straine my voyce? When stirs, &amp; tumults have been hot'st &amp; proudest, The noble Muse hath song the stern'st &amp; lowdest; And know great Prince, that Muse thy glory sings, (What ere detraction snarle) was made for Kings. The neighing courser in this time of mirth, That with his arm'd hoofe beats th'reecchoing earth, The trumpets clangor, &amp; the peoples cry, Not like the Muse can strike the burnish'd skie, Which should heaven quench th'eternal quicking springs, The stars put out, could light them with her wings. What though perhaps my selfe I not intrude Amongst th'unstedy wondring multitude, The tedious tumults, and the boystrous throng, That presse to view thee as thou com'st along, The praise I give thee shall thy welcome keepe, When all these rude crowds in the dust shal sleepe, And when applause and shouts are hush'd &amp; still, Then shall my smooth verse chant thee cleer &amp; shril. With thy beginning, doth the Spring begin, And as thy Usher gently brings thee in, Which in consent doth happily accord With the yeere kept to the incarnate Word, And in that Month (cohering by a fate) By the old world to wisdome dedicate, Thy Prophet thus doth seriously apply, As by a strong unfailing Augury, That as the fruitfull, and ful-bosom'd Spring, So shall thy raigne be rich and florishing: The month thy conquests, &amp; atchievements great By those shall sit on thy Imperiall seate, And by the yeere I seriously divine The Crowne for ever setled in thy line. From Cornwall now past Calidons proude strength, Thy Empire beares eight hundred miles in length: Halfe which in bredth her bosome forth doth lay The Irish Sea.From the faire German to'th Vergivian sea: Thy Realme of Ireland, a most fertile Land, Brought in subjection to thy glorious hand, And all the Iles theyr chalkie tops advance To the sunne setting from the coast of Fraunce. Saturne to thee his soveraignty resignes, Op'ning the lock'd way to the wealthy mines: And till thy raigne Fame all this while did hover, The North-west passage that thou might'st discover Unto the Indies, where that treasure lies Whose plenty might ten other worlds suffice. Neptune and Jove together doe conspire, This gives his trydent, that his three-forkt fire, And to thy hand doe give the kayes to keepe, Of the profound immeasurable deepe. But soft my Muse, check thy abundant straine To the conceiving of th'unskilfull braine, That whilst thy true descent I doe rehearse, Th'unlearned'st soule may sweetly tast my verse. Which now in order let me first dispose, And tell the union of the blessed Rose, That to thy Grandsire Henry I may bring thee, (From whom I after to thy birth may sing thee.) That Tudors blood did worthily prefer, From the great Queene that beautious Dowager, Katherine wife to Henry the fift. Whose sonne brave Richmond from the Brittons fet, Graft in the stock of Princely Sommerset, Edmond Tudor Earle of Richmond, sonne of Owen Tudor by the Queene. The daughter of John Duke of Sommerset, sonne of John Earle of Sommer set, the sonne of John of Gaunt. The third faire Sien, the sweet Roseat plant, Sprong from the Roote of the Lancastrian Gant, Which had seaventh Henry, that of royall blood By his deere Mother, is the Red-rose bud, As theyr great Merlin propheci'd before Should the old Brittons regalty restore, Which Henry raigning by th'usurpers death, Maried the Princesse faire Elizabeth Fourth Edwards daughter, whose predest'nate bed Did thus conjoyne the White-rose, and the Red: These Roseall branches as I thus entwyne, In curious trayles embelishing thy lyne, To thy blest Cradell let me bring thee on, Rightly deriv'd from thy great Grandsires throne. Who holding Scotlands amity in worth, Strongly to linck him with King James the fourth, His eldest daughter did to him unite, Th'unparaleld bright lovely Margarite, Which to that husband prosperously did bring, The fifth of that Name, Scotlands lawfull King, Father to Mary (long in England seene) Maried whilst he was Daulphin. The Daulphins dowager, the late Scottish Queene. But now to Margarite backe againe to come, From whose so fruitfull, and most blessed wombe Archibald Dowglasse Earle of Anguish. We bring our full joy, James her husband dead, Tooke gallant Anguish to a second bed, To whom ere long she bare a princely gerle, The Countesse of Lenox. Maried to Lenox, that brave-issued Earle, This beautious Dowglasse, as the powers imply, Brought that Prince Henry, Duke of Albany, Henry Lord Darly. Who in the prime of strength, in youths sum'd pride Maried the Scotch Queene on the other side, Whose happy bed to that sweet Lord did bring, This Brittaine hope, James our undoubted King, In true succession, as the first of other Of Henries line by Father, and by Mother. Thus from the old stock showing thee sprong to be, Grafting the pure White, with the Red-rose tree, By mixture made vermillion as they meet, For in that colour is the Rose most sweet: So in thy Crowne the precious flower that growes Be it the Damaske, or Vermillion Rose, Amongst those Reliques, that victorious King, Edward cald Longshanks, did from Scotland bring, And as a Trophie royally prefer To the rich Shrine in famous Westminster, Recorded to be that stone whereon Jacob slept.That stone reserv'd in England many a day, On which great Jacob his grave head did lay, And saw descending Angels whilst he slept: Which since that time by sundry Nations kept, (From age to age I could recite you how, Could I my pen that liberty alow.) An ancient Prophet long agoe fore-told, (Though fooles their sawes for vanities doe hold) A prophecie belonging to that stone.A King of Scotland, ages comming on, Where it was found, be crown'd upon that stone. Two famous Kingdoms seperate thus long, Within one Iland, and that speake one tongue, Since Brute first raign'd, (if men of Brute alow) Never before united untill now, What power, nor war could do, nor time expected, Thy blessed birth hath happily effected. O now revive that noble Brittaines name, From which at first our ancient honors came, Which with both Nations fitly doth agree That Scotch and English without difference be, And in that place wher feuds were wont to spring Let us light Jigs, and joyfull Pæans sing. Whilst such as rightly propheci'd thy raigne, Deride those Ideots held their words for vaine. Had not my soule beene proofe gainst envies spite I had not breath'd thy memory to write: Nor had my zealous, and religious layes Told thy rare vertues, and thy glorious dayes. Renowned Prince, when all these tumults cease, Even in the calme, and Musick of thy peace, If in thy grace thou deigne to favour us, And to the Muses be propitious, Cæsar himselfe, Roomes glorious wits among, Was not so highly, nor divinely sung. The very earthl'est &amp; degenerat'st spirit, That is most voyd of vertue, and of merit, With the austeer'st, and impudentest face, Will thrust himselfe the formost to thy grace; Those silken, laced, and perfumed hinds, That have rich bodies, but poore wretched minds, But from thy Court (O Worthy) banish quite The foole, the Pandar, and the Parasite, And call thy selfe most happy (then be bold) When worthie places, worthi'st men doe hold, The servile clowne for shame shall hide his head, His ignorance, and basenesse frustrated, Set lovely vertue ever in thy view, And love them most, that most doe her pursue, So shalt thou ad renowne unto thy state, A King most great, most wise, most fortunate. FINIS. A PÆAN TRIVMPHALL. COMPOSED FOR THE SOCIETIE OF the Goldsmiths of London: congratulating his Highnes magnificent entring the Citie. To the Maiestie of the King. By Michael Drayton. Dicite io pæan, io bis dicite pæan. To the vaste skies whilst shoutes and cries rebound, And buildings eccho with reverberate sound, Strugling to thrust out of the peopled throng, Panting for breath flies our elaborate song That time the day brake from her wonted guise, The Sunne in haste before his houre did rise, And drave the fleet-foote posting houres so fast, Which were afeard young Phaeton that was cast From his Siers Chariot, reobtain'd the Carre, To set the neighboring Elements at warre. But whilst sweete Zephyre gently spreads his wings, Curles the sleeke bosomes of th'enamoured springs. With Baulmie spices so perfumes each place, Breathing such odors in the mornings face, That the day seem'd all former daies to scorne, And (to compare it) ever should be borne. Saturne whose grim face clad in Icie haire, Thrust his bleake visage through the Northerne aire, That long had low'rd upon the drouping spring, With Frosts, Hailes, Snowes and Tempests minacing, Suddenly calm'd, and his harsh rage resignes The south and southwest wind.To smooth Favonius and milde Libick windes, Whil'st Temples stand even trembling as afeard, To see proud Pageants on their Arches reard Above their Turrets, whilest the concourse meete, Like boysterous tides in every publike streete. Windowes of eyes, the houses scorn'd their glasse, On every side their Majesties should passe: Roomes with rich beauties furnished about, Arras but serves to hang the walles without. Who lov'd in works of ancient times to prie, Hangings compleate with curious Imagrie, Glutting his eyes here lively might behold, Faces whose numbers figures never told, Walling the houses, in whose severall eyes Joye shewes it selfe in more varieties, Then be their mindes, the objects that they see, Which are as various as their features bee. The hie-reard spires shake with the peoples crie, Bending their tops seeme wondring to espie Streets pav'd with heads, for such the numbers bee, The loftiest Tower no ground at all can see. Banners, Flags, Streamers, in such numbers borne, And stood so thick that one might soone have sworne, Nature of late some noveltie had brought, Groaves leav'd with silke in curious manner wrought, Bearing such fruite th'Atlantides did keepe, The daughters of Atlas. By that fierce Dragon that did never sleepe. When now approched glorious Majestie, Under a gold-wrought sumptuous Canopie. Before him went his goodly glittering traine, Which though as late wash'd in a golden raine. All so embraudered that to those behold, Horses as men, seem'd to be made of Gold: With the faire Prince, in whom appear'd in glory, As in th'abridgement of some famous story, Ev'ry rare vertue of each famous King Since Norman Williams happie conquering: Where might be seene in his fresh blooming hopes, Henry the fifth leading his warlike troupes, When the proud French fell on that conquered land, As the full Corne before the labourers hand. Ushering so bright and Angellike a Queene, Whose gallant carridge had but Cynthia seene, She might have learnd her silver brow to beare, And to have shin'd and sparckl'd in her spheare, Leading her Ladies on their milkie Steedes, With such aspect that each beholder feedes, As though the lights and beauties of the skies, Transcending dwelt and twinckled in their eies. Here might you see what passion wonder wrought, As it invades the temper of the thought: One weepes for joy, he laughs and claps his hands, Another still and looking sadly stands: Others that seemed to be moved lesse, Shew'd more then these in action could expresse. None ther's could judge a witnesse of this sight, Whether of two did take the more delight, They that in triumph rode or they that stand, To view the pompe and glorie of the land, Each unto other such reflection sent, Either so sumptuous, so magnificent: Nor are the duties that thy subjects owe, Only compriz'd in this externall show. For harts are heap'd with those innumered hoords, That tongues by uttrance cannot vent in words: Nor is it all Invention here devises, That thy hie worth and Majestie comprizes, And we not last of those glad harts that prove, To shew our Soveraigne our unspotted love. John Stow Survay.The first a Maiors name worthely did grace, Marrying that title and Pretorian place, Was of our freedome, purchasing thereby That primate honor to our Livery. Native our love as needfull is our trade, By which no kingdome ever was decaide, To bring sleight gauds and womanish devices, Of little use and of excessive prices. Good home-made things with trifles to suppresse, To feede luxurious riot, and excesse, Sound Bullion is our subject, whose sure rate Seal'd by his selfeworth, such the Goldsmiths state, Which peace and happie government doth nourish, And with a kingdome doth both fade and florish. Natures perfection, that great wonder Gold, Of which the first note of our name we hold, Phœbus his God that triply doth implie, To medicen, Musicke, and sweete Poesie, To us his hie divinitie imparts, As he is knowne and glorified in Arts: For that invention studie doth befit, That is the crowne and puritie of wit, What doth belong and's proper to the muse, We of all other mysteries doe use, Moulds and insculpturs framing by the head, Formes and proportions strangely varied. The lumpe as likes the workman best to frame, To wedge, to ingot, or what other name, That by the sight and knowledge of our trade, Into rich Plate, and Utensils is made Within thy land, for ornament doth stay, Angels have wings and fleeting still away, And by eschanging virtuously doth flie That cankerd, base, and idle Usurie: For when the banck once subtilie is plac'd, Th'exacted use comes hourely in so fast, That whil'st the lender on the borrower praies, Good and industrious facultie decaies. Foule Avarice that triple Dog of Hell, That when Joves sonne emperiously did quell, And from his hand receiv'd that fatall wound, His poysoned foame he driv'ld on the ground, From which they say as in the earths despite, Did spring that black and poysoned Aconite: For they by fire that mettals use to trie, And finde wise Natures secresies thereby, When they prepare industriously to shed Silver, dispos'd adulteratly with lead, Prove this base Courser from the other fine, Being so cleere and aptly femenine, Steales from her purenes in his boystrous fixure, By the corruption of his earthly mixure, Which if Gold helping her infeebled might, As a kind brother in his sisters right, By him her spirit is perfect and compacted, Which that grosse body enviously detracted. Conscience like Gold which Hell cannot intice, Nor winne from weake man by his avarice: Which if infus'd such vertue doth impart, As doth conforme and rectifie the hart. For as the Indians by experience know, That like a Tree it in the ground doth grow, And as it still approcheth to the day, His curled branches bravely doth display, Then in the bulke and body of the mine, More neat, contracted, rarifi'd, and fine: So truth from darknes spreading doth appeare, And shewes it selfe more luculent and cleere. In Catol. Episcop. Dunstan our Patron that religious man, (That great and famous Metropolitan, That in his time ascended by degrees, To Worster, London, Canturburies Sees, That was in ancient Glastenbury bred, Foure Saxons raignes that living flourished, Whose deeds the world unto this time containeth, And sainted in our Kalenders remaineth Gave) what not time our Brotherhood denies, Ancient endowments and immunities: And for our station and our generall heape, Recides in Lombard or in goodly Cheape. We have an Adage which though very old, Tis not the worse that it hath oft been told, (Though the despising ancient things and holie, Too much betraies our ignorance and follie) That England yeelds to goodly London this, That she her chiefe and soveraine Citie is: London will graunt her goodly Cheape the grace, To be her first and absolutest place: Dare I proclaime then with a constant hand, Cheape is the Starre and Jewell of thy land. The Trophie that we reare unto thy praise, This gold-drop'd Lawrell, this life-giving bayes, No power lends immortalitie to men, Like the hie spirit of an industrious pen, Which stems times tumults with a full-spread saile, When proud reard piles and monuments doe faile, And in their cinders when great Courts doe lie, That shall confront and justle with the skie: Live ever mightie, happely, and long, Living admir'd, and dead be highly song.

[From the Sonnets appended to Englands Heroicall Epistles, 1599.] Phœbe looke downe, and here behold in mee, The elements within thy sphere inclosed, How kindly Nature plac'd them under thee, And in my world, see how they are disposed; My hope is earth, the lowest, cold and dry, The grosser mother of deepe melancholie, Water my teares, coold with humidity, Wan, flegmatick, inclind by nature wholie; My sighs, the ayre, hote, moyst, ascending hier, Subtile of sanguine, dy'de in my harts dolor, My thoughts, they be the element of fire, Hote, dry, and percing, still inclind to choller, Thine eye the Orbe unto all these, from whence, Proceeds th'effects of powerfull influence. To the Spheares. Sonet. 23. [From the Sonnets appended to Englands Heroicall Epistles, 1599.] Thou which do'st guide this little world of love, Thy planets mansions heere thou mayst behold, My brow the spheare where Saturne still doth move, Wrinkled with cares: and withered, dry, and cold; Mine eyes the Orbe where Jupiter doth trace, Which gently smile because they looke on thee, Mars in my swarty visage takes his place, Made leane with love, where furious conflicts bee. Sol in my breast with his hote scorching flame, And in my hart alone doth Venus raigne: Mercury my hands the Organs of thy fame, And Luna glides in my fantastick braine; The starry heaven thy prayse by me exprest, Thou the first moover, guiding all the rest. Sonet. 27. [From the Sonnets appended to Englands Heroicall Epistles, 1599.] I gave my fayth to Love, Love his to mee, That hee and I, sworne brothers should remaine, Thus fayth receiv'd, fayth given backe againe, Who would imagine bond more sure could be? Love flies to her, yet holds he my fayth taken, Thus from my vertue raiseth my offence, Making me guilty by mine innocence; And surer bond by beeing so forsaken, He makes her aske what I before had vow'd, Giving her that, which he had given me, I bound by him, and he by her made free, Who ever so hard breach of fayth alow'd? Speake you that should of right and wrong discusse, Was right ere wrong'd, or wrong ere righted thus? A Cansonet. Sonet. 56. [From the Sonnets appended to Englands Heroicall Epistles, 1599.] Eyes with your teares, blind if you bee, Why have these teares such eyes to see, Poore eyes, if yours teares cannot move, My teares, eyes, then must mone my love, Then eyes, since you have lost your sight, Weepe still, and teares shall lend you light, Till both desolv'd, and both want might. No, no, cleere eyes, you are not blind, But in my teares discerne my mind: Teares be the language which you speake, Which my hart wanting, yet must breake; My tongue must cease to tell my wrongs, And make my sighs to get them tongs, Yet more then this to her belongs. To the high and mighty Prince, James, King of Scots. Sonnet. 62. [From Idea, appended to Englands Heroicall Epistles, 1600] Not thy grave Counsells, nor thy Subjects love, Nor all that famous Scottish royaltie, Or what thy soveraigne greatnes may approve, Others in vaine doe but historifie, When thine owne glory from thy selfe doth spring, As though thou did'st, all meaner prayses scorne: Of Kings a Poet, and the Poets King, They Princes, but thou Prophets do'st adorne; Whilst others by their Empires are renown'd, Thou do'st enrich thy Scotland with renowne, And Kings can but with Diadems be crown'd, But with thy Laurell, thou doo'st crowne thy Crowne; That they whose pens, (even) life to Kings doe give, In thee a King, shall seeke them selves to live. [ODES NOT REPRINTED IN 1619 From Poemes Lyrick and pastorall (1606).] TO MY WORTHY FREND; MASTER JOHN SAVAGE OF THE INNER TEMPLE. Ode 4 Uppon this sinfull earth If man can happy be And higher then his birth (Frend) take him thus of me: Whome promise not deceives That he the breach should rue, Nor constant reason leaves Opinion to pursue. To rayse his meane estate That sooths no wanton's sinne, Doth that preferment hate That virtue doth not winne. Nor bravery doth admire Nor doth more love professe, To that he doth desire, Then that he doth possesse: Loose humor nor to please That neither spares nor spends By by discretion weyes What is to needfull ends. To him deserving not Not yeelding, nor doth hould What is not his, doing what He ought, not what he could. Whome the base tyrants will Soe much could never awe As him for good or ill From honesty to drawe. Whose constancy doth rise Bove undeserved spight Whose valew'rs to despise That most doth him delight. That earely leave doth take Of th'world though to his payne For virtues onely sake, And not till need constrayne. Noe man can be so free Though in imperiall seate Nor Eminent as he That deemeth nothing greate. Ode 8. Singe wee the Rose Then which no flower there growes Is sweeter: And aptly her compare With what in that is rare A parallel none meeter. Or made poses, Of this that incloses Suche blisses, That naturally flusheth As she blusheth When she is robd of kisses. Or if strew'd When with the morning dew'd Or stilling, Or howe to sense expos'd All which in her inclos'd, Ech place with sweetnes filling. That most renown'd By Nature ritchly crownd With yellow, Of that delitious layre And as pure, her hayre Unto the same the fellowe. Fearing of harme Nature that flower doth arme From danger, The touch gives her offence But with reverence Unto her selfe a stranger. That redde, or white, Or mixt, the sence delyte Behoulding, In her complexion All which perfection Such harmony in fouldinge That devyded Ere it was descided Which most pure, Began the greevous war Of York &amp; Lancaster, That did many yeeres indure. Conflicts as greate As were in all that heate I sustaine: By her, as many harts As men on either parts That with her eies hath slaine. The Primrose flower The first of Flora's bower Is placed, Soe is shee first as best Though excellent the rest, All gracing, by none graced. [UNCOLLECTED POEMS] Mr. M.D. TO THE AUTHOR. [From Thomas Morley's First Booke of Balletts to Five Voyces, 1595.] Such was old Orpheus cunning, That sencelesse things drew neere him, And heards of beastes to heare him, The stock, the stone, the Oxe, the Asse came running. MORLEY! but this enchaunting To thee, to be the Musick-God is wanting. And yet thou needst not feare him; Draw thou the Shepherds still and Bonny-lasses, And envie him not stocks, stones, Oxen, Asses. OF THE WORKE AND TRANSLATION. [From Anthony Munday's Second Booke of Primaleon of Greece . . . . Translated out of French, 1596.] If in opinion of judiciall wit, Primaleons sweet Invention well deserve: Then he (no lesse) which hath translated it, Which doth his sense, his forme, his phrase observe. And in true method of his home-borne stile, (Following the fashion of a French conceate) Hath brought him heere into this famous Ile, Where but a Stranger now hath made his seate. He lives a Prince, and comming in this sort, Shall to his Countrey of your fame report. M. D. [The curious eye that over-rashly lookes] [From Nicholas Ling's Politeuphuia. Wits Commonwealth. Newly corrected and augmented, 1598.] The curious eye that over-rashly lookes, And gives no tast nor feeling to the mind, Robs it own selfe, &amp; wrongs those labored bookes Wherein the soule might greater comfort find; But when that sence doth play the busie Bee, And for the honny, not the poyson reeds, Then for the labour it receaves the fee, When as the minde on heavenly sweetnes feeds; This doe thine eye; and if it find not heere Such precious comforts as may give content, And shall confesse the travaile not too deere, Nor idle howers that in this worke were spent, Never heereafter will I ever looke For thing of worth in any morrall booke. M. D. TO HIS FRIEND, MASTER CHR. M. his Booke. [From Christopher Middleton's The Legend of Humphrey Duke of Glocester, 1600.] Like as a man, on some adventure bound His honest friendes, their kindnes to expresse, T'incourage him of whome the maine is own'd; Some venture more, and some adventure lesse, That if the voyage (happily) be good: They his good fortune freely may pertake; If otherwise it perrish in the flood, Yet like good freinds theirs perish'd for his sake. On thy returne I put this little forth, My chaunce with thine indifferently to prove, Which though (I knowe) not fitting with thy worth, Accept it yet since it proceedes from love; And if thy fortune prosper, I may see I have some share, though most returne to thee. Mich: Drayton. ROWLANDS MADRIGALL. [From Englands Helicon, 1600.] Faire Love rest thee heere, Never yet was morne so cleere, Sweete be not unkinde, Let me thy favour finde, Or else for love I die. Harke this pretty bubling spring, How it makes the Meadowes ring, Love now stand my friend, Heere let all sorrow end, And I will honour thee. See where little Cupid lyes, Looking babies in her eyes. Cupid helpe me now, Lend to me thy bowe, To wound her that wounded me. Heere is none to see or tell, All our flocks are feeding by, This banke with Roses spred, Oh it is a dainty bed, Fit for my Love and me. Harke the birds in yonder Groave, How they chaunt unto my Love, Love be kind to me, As I have beene to thee, For thou hast wonne my hart. Calme windes blow you faire, Rock her thou sweete gentle ayre, O the morne is noone, The evening comes too soone, To part my Love and me. The Roses and thy lips doo meete, Oh that life were halfe so sweete, Who would respect his breath, That might die such a death, Oh that life thus might die. All the bushes that be neere, With sweet Nightingales beset, Hush sweete and be still, Let them sing their fill, There's none our joyes to let. Sunne why doo'st thou goe so fast? Oh why doo'st thou make such hast? It is too early yet, So soone from joyes to flit, Why art thou so unkind? See my little Lambkins runne, Looke on them till I have done, Hast not on the night, To rob me of her sight, That live but by her eyes. Alas, sweet Love, we must depart, Harke, my dogge begins to barke, Some bodie's comming neere, They shall not finde us heere, For feare of being chid. Take my Garland and my Glove, Weare it for my sake my Love, To morrow on the greene, Thou shalt be our Sheepheards Queene, Crowned with Roses gay. FINIS. Mich. Drayton. [Nature, and Arte are overmatcht by thee] [From a manuscript of Thomas Palmer's The Sprite of Trees and Herbes, British Museum Additional MS. 18,040.] Nature, and Arte are overmatcht by thee in secreat vertews both of Plants and flowers thou doest excell both Phisick and the Bee though in their functions, and their severall powers the best but honny that the Bee canne gett and Med'cene is all Phisicke doeth extract by thee againe they both to schoole are sett for thou hast found what Arte, and Nature lackte their use is whilst, the Plant or flower doth growe drawne from the leafe, the rinde, the barck, the roote but thou in these doest greater cunninge shewe to serve thy use though lyinge under foote both foode, and Medcene thou from these doest try both these confinde in thy moralitye Mic: Draiton. Gloria cuique sua est TO MASTER NICHOLAS GEFFE. [From Nicholas Geffe's translation of Olivier de Serres's The Perfect Use of Silk-wormes, 1607.] As thou deare friend with thy industrious hand Reachest this rich invaluable Clue; So once Columbus offred to this land That from which Spaine her now-hie courage drue. And had not she provok'd by his designes, Traveld to find what hidden was before, Ne're had her Argo's from the Indian mines Powr'd their full panches, on th'Iberian shore. From small beginnings how brave noble things Have gathered vigor and themselves have rear'd To be the strength and maintenance of Kings That at the first but frivolous appear'd: So may thy Silk-wormes happily increase From sea to sea to propagate their seed, That plant still, nourish'd by our glorious peace Whose leafe alone, the labouring Worme doth feed. And may thy fame perpetually advance Rich when by thee, thy countrey shall be made; Naples, Granado, Portugale, and France, All to sit idle, wondring at our trade. The tree acquainting with the Brittish soyle And the true use unto our people taught Shall trebble ten times recompence the toile (From forraine parts) of him it hither brought, In spight of them would rob thee of thy due, Yet not deprive us of thy noble skill, Still let faire vertue to her selfe be true, Although the times ingratefull be and ill. Michael Drayton. TO M. JOHN DAVIES, MY GOOD FRIEND. [From John Davies's Holy Roode, 1609.] Such men as hold intelligence with Letters, And in that nice and Narrow way of Verse, As oft they lend, so oft they must be Debters, If with the Muses they will have commerce: Seldome at Stawles me, this way men rehearse, To mine Inferiours, nor unto my Betters: He stales his Lines that so doeth them disperce; I am so free, I love not Golden-fetters: And many Lines fore Writers, be but Setters To them which Cheate with Papers; which doth pierse, Our Credits: when we shew our selves Abetters: To those that wrong our knowledge: we rehearse Often (my good John; and I love) thy Letters; Which lend me Credit, as I lend my Verse. Michael Drayton. TO MY KINDE FRIEND DA: MURRAY. [From Sir David Murray's Tragicall Death of Sophonisba, 1611.] In new attire (and put most neatly on) Thou Murray mak'st thy passionate Queene apeare, As when she sat on the Numidian throne, Deck'd with those Gems that most refulgent were. So thy stronge muse her maker like repaires, That from the ruins of her wasted urne, Into a body of delicious ayres: Againe her spirit doth transmigrated turne, That scortching soile which thy great subject bore, Bred those that coldly but expres'd her merit, But breathing now upon our colder shore, Here shee hath found a noble fiery spirit, Both there, and here, so fortunate for Fame, That what she was, she's every where the same. M. Drayton. Incipit Michael Drayton.[From Thomas Coryate's Coryats Crudities, 1611.] A brief Prologue to the verses following. Deare Tom, thy Booke was like to come to light, Ere I could gaine but one halfe howre to write; They go before whose wits are at their noones, And I come after bringing Salt and Spoones. Many there be that write before thy Booke, For whom (except here) who would ever looke? Thrice happy are all wee that had the Grace To have our names set in this living place. Most worthy man, with thee it is even thus, As men take Dottrels, so hast thou ta'n us. Which as a man his arme or leg doth set, So this fond Bird will likewise counterfeit: Thou art the Fowler, and doest shew us shapes And we are all thy Zanies, thy true Apes. I saw this age (from what it was at first) Swolne, and so bigge, that it was like to burst, Growne so prodigious, so quite out of fashion, That who will thrive, must hazard his damnation: Sweating in panges, sent such a horrid mist, As to dim heaven: I looked for Antichrist Or some new set of Divels to sway hell, Worser then those, that in the Chaos fell: Wondring what fruit it to the world would bring, At length it brought forth this: ô most strange thing; And with sore throwes, for that the greatest head Ever is hard'st to be delivered. By thee wise Coryate we are taught to know, Great, with great men which is the way to grow. For in a new straine thou com'st finely in, Making thy selfe like those thou meant'st to winne: Greatnesse to me seem'd ever full of feare, Which thou found'st false at thy arriving there, Of the Bermudos, the example such, Where not a ship untill this time durst touch; Kep't as suppos'd by hels infernall dogs, Our Fleet found their most honest courteous hogs. Live vertuous Coryate, and for ever be Lik'd of such wise men, as are most like thee. Explicit Michael Drayton. TO HIS FRIEND THE AUTHOR. [From William Browne's Britannia's Pastorals, 1613.] Drive forth thy Flocke, young Pastor, to that Plaine, Where our old Shepheards wont their flocks to feed; To those cleare walkes, where many a skilfull Swaine To'ards the calme ev'ning, tun'd his pleasant Reede. Those, to the Muses once so sacred, Downes, As no rude foote might there presume to stand: (Now made the way of the unworthiest Clownes, Dig'd and plow'd up with each unhallowed hand) If possible thou canst, redeeme those places, Where, by the brim of many a silver Spring, The learned Maydens, and delightfull Graces Often have sate to heare our Shepheards sing: Where on those Pines the neighb'ring Groves among, (Now utterly neglected in these dayes) Our Garlands, Pipes, and Cornamutes were hong The monuments of our deserved praise. So may thy Sheepe like, so thy Lambes increase, And from the Wolfe feede ever safe and free! So maist thou thrive, among the learned prease, As thou, young Shepheard, art belov'd of mee! Michael Drayton. TO MY WORTHY FRIEND MR. GEORGE CHAPMAN, and his translated Hesiod. [From George Chapman's translation of The Georgicks of Hesiod, 1618.] Chapman; We finde by thy past-prized fraught, What wealth thou dost upon this Land conferre; Th'olde Græcian Prophets hither that hast brought, Of their full words the true Interpreter: And by thy travell, strongly hast exprest The large dimensions of the English tongue; Delivering them so well, the first and best, That to the world in Numbers ever sung. Thou hast unlock'd the treasury, wherein All Art, and knowledge have so long been hidden: Which, till the gracefull Muses did begin Here to inhabite, was to us forbidden. In blest Elizium, (in a place most fit) Under that tree due to the Delphian God, Musæus, and that Iliad Singer sit, And neare to them that noble Hesiod, Smoothing their rugged foreheads; and do smile, After so many hundred yeares to see Their Poems read in this farre westerne Ile, Translated from their ancient Greeke, by thee; Each his good Genius whispering in his eare, That with so lucky, and auspicious fate Did still attend them, whilst they living were, And gave their Verses such a lasting date. Where slightly passing by the Thespian spring, Many long after did but onely sup; Nature, then fruitfull, forth these men did bring, To fetch deepe Rowses from Joves plentious cup. In thy free labours (friend) then rest content. Feare not Detraction, neither fawne on Praise: When idle Censure all her force hath spent, Knowledge can crowne her self with her owne Baies. Their Lines, that have so many lives outworne, Cleerely expounded, shall base Envy scorne. Michael Drayton. TO MY FRIEND M. A. H. [From Abraham Holland's Naumachia, or Hollands Sea-Fight, 1622.] By this one lim, my Holland, we may see What thou in time at thy full growth maist bee, Which wit, by her owne Symetrie can take, And thy proportion perfectly can make At thy Ascendant: that when thou shalt show Thy selfe; who reads thee perfectly shall know Those of the Muses by this little light Saw before other where to take thy height. Proceed, let not Apollo's stocke decay, Poets and Kings are not borne every day. Michael Drayton. M. D. ESQUIRE TO HIS GOOD FRIEND, T. V. [From Thomas Vicars's translation of Bartholomæus Keckermann's Manuduction to Theologie, 1622.] What Thou do'st teach, by others heretofore Hath likewise bin. But yet by no man more To the true life. That by thy godly care, Thou and thine Authour equally doe share. Thou praisest him Translating, but if he Understood English he would more praise thee. Thou to our Nation ha'st his Doctrine showne, Which to our vulgar else had not beene knowne; As much by this thou get'st as ere he wanne: England praise Vicars, Dantsk her Keckerman. Mich. Drayton. TO THE DEARE REMEMBRANCE of his Noble Friend, Sir John Beaumont, Baronet. [From Sir John Beaumont's Bosworth-field, 1629.] This Posthumus, from the brave Parents Name, Likely to be the heire of so much Fame, Can have at all no portion by my prayse: Onely this poore Branch of my with'ring Bayes I offer to it; and am very glad, I yet have this; which if I better had, My Love should build an Altar, and thereon Should offer up such Wreaths as long agone, Those daring Grecians, and proud Romans crownd; Giving that honour to their most Renown'd. But that brave World is past, and we are light, After those glorious dayes, into the night Of these base times, which not one Heröe have, Onely an empty Title, which the grave Shall soone devoure; whence it no more shall sound, Which never got up higher then the ground. Thy care for that which was not worth thy breath, Brought on too soone thy much lamented death. But Heav'n was kind, and would not let thee see The Plagues that must upon this Nation be, By whom the Muses have neglected bin, Which shall adde weight and measure to their sinne; And have already had this curse from us, That in their pride they should grow barbarous. There is no splendor, that our Pens can give By our most labor'd lines, can make thee live Like to thine owne, which able is to raise So lasting pillars to prop up thy prayse, As time shall hardly shake, untill it shall Ruine those things, that with it selfe must fall. Mi. Drayton. TO MY NOBLE FRIEND MR. ROBERT DOVER, on his brave annuall Assemblies upon Cotswold. [From Matthew Walbancke's Annalia Dubrensia. Upon the yeerely celebration of Mr. Robert Dovers Olimpick Games upon Cotswold-Hills, 1636.] Dover, to doe thee Right, who will not strive, That dost in these dull yron Times revive The golden Ages glories; which poore Wee Had not so much as dream't on but for Thee? As those brave Grecians in their happy dayes, On Mount Olympus to their Hercules Ordain'd their games Olimpick, and so nam'd Of that great Mountaine; for those pastimes fam'd: Where then their able Youth, Leapt, Wrestled, Ran, Threw the arm'd Dart; and honour'd was the Man That was the Victor; In the Circute there The nimble Rider, and skil'd Chariotere Strove for the Garland; In those noble Times There to their Harpes the Poets sang their Rimes; That whilst Greece flourisht, and was onely then Nurse of all Arts, and of all famous men: Numbring their yeers, still their accounts they made, Either from this or that Olimpiade. So Dover, from these Games, by thee begun, Wee'l reckon Ours, as time away doth run. Wee'l have thy Statue in some Rocke cut out, With brave Inscriptions garnished about; And under written, Loe, this was the man, Dover, that first these noble Sports began. Ladds of the Hills, and Lasses of the Vale, In many a song, and many a merry Tale Shall mention Thee; and having leave to play, Unto thy name shall make a Holy day. The Cotswold Shepheards as their flocks they keepe, To put off lazie drowsinesse and sleepe, Shall sit to tell, and heare thy Story tould, That night shall come ere they their flocks can fould.

To the Noble SIR WALTER ASTON: Knight of the Honorable Order of the Bath; Baronet: And of his Majesties Privie Chamber. To M. Michael Drayton. What Ornaments might I devise, to fit Th'aspiring height of thy admired Spirit? Or what faire Garland worthy is to sit On thy blest Browes, that compasse in all Merit? Thou shalt not crowned be with common Bayes, Because for thee it is a Crowne too low, Apollo's Tree can yeeld thee simple praise, It is too dull a Vesture for thy Brow; But with a Wreathe of Starres, shalt thou be crown'd, Which when thy working Temples doe sustaine, Will like the Spheares be ever moving round, After the royall Musike of thy Braine: Thy Skill doth equall Phœbus, not thy Birth: He to Heaven gives Musike, thou to Earth. Thomas Greene. To M. Michael Drayton. Those painefull Wits, which Natures depth admire, And view the causes of unconstant strife, Doe tremble, lest the Universe expire, Through lasting Jarres, the Enemies of life. On earthly signes let not such Sages looke, Nor on the cleere aspect of hopefull Starres, But learne the Worlds continuance from thy Booke, Which frames past Natures force eternall Warres; Wherein the Muses shewing perfect glorie, Adorne it so with gracefull Harmonie, That all the acts of this lamented Storie, Seeme not perform'd for Peoples liberty, Nor through the awe of an imperious King: But that thy Verses their deepe wounds might sing. John Beaumont. To his Friend the Authour. Had I not lov'd Thee and thy Poesie, (Deare Friend) my Theame should of thy prayses bee: But in weake Braynes it doth suspition move, When, who is seene to prayse, is knowne to love. For, though that first and Virgin birth of thine, Be so articulate, so Masculine, So truely Lim'd, so sinewie, so compact, So sweetly faire, so every way exact, As may indure the most judicious touch, And give thy Friends just reason to avouch It, spight of Envies teeth, a living birth: Though Second, Third, Fourth, Fift, of equall worth: Though all be good: yet since affection In judgement may, as shaddow and projection In Lantskip, make that which is low seeme high, That's shallow deepe, small great, and farre that's nigh, So as it well may just suspicion move, When who is seene to praise, is knowne to love. Yet thus my censure, this my doome shall be: I'le alwayes love Thee, and thy Poesie. E. Heyward. Upon the Barons Warres, the Epistles and Sonnets. To his worthy Friend Michael Drayton. I must admire thee (but to praise were vaine, What ev'ry tasting palat so approves) Thy Martiall Pyrrhique, and thy Epique straine Digesting Warres with heart-uniting Loves; The two first Authors of what is compos'd In this round Systeme All; it's ancient lore (All Arts in Discords and Concents are clos'd. And when unwinged soules the According to that in Plato's Phœdrus, where, under the names of Lovers of beauty, (which comprehends all kind of faire Objects, either in the mind or body) and of Souldiers, all such as are eminent for true worth, are comprehended; the rest of men being of a farre lower ranke. Fates restore To th'earth for reparation of their flights, The first Musicians, Schollers, Lovers make; The next ranke destinate to Mars his Knights; The following rabble meaner titles take) I see thy Temples crown'd with Phœbus rites: Thy Bay's to th'eye, with Lilly mixt and Rose, As to the eare a Diapason close. J. Selden. THE BARONS WARRES, In the Reigne of Edward the Second. The first Canto. The Argument. The grievous Plagues, and the prodigious Signes, That this great Warre and Slaughter doe fore-show, The cause which the proud Baronage combines, The Queenes much wrong, whence many mischiefs grow, And how the Time to this great Change inclines, As with what Armes each Countreymen doe goe, What cause to yeeld, the Mortimers pretend, And their Commitment, doth this Canto end. 1 The bloudie Factions and Rebellious pride Of a strong Nation, whose ill-manag'd might The Prince and Peeres did many a day divide; With whom, wrong was no wrong, nor right no right, Whose strife, their Swords knew only to decide, Spur'd to their high speed, by their equall spight; Me from soft Layes and tender Loves doth bring, Of a farre worse, then Civill Warre to sing. 2 What Hellish Furie poys'ned their hot Bloud? Or can we thinke 'twas in the power of Charmes, With those so poore hopes of the publike good, To have intic'd them to tumultuous Armes; And from that Safetie, wherein late they stood, Reft them so farre from feeling of their Harmes, That France and Belgia, with affrighted eyes, Stood both amazed at their Miseries? 3 Having Relation to the first Barons Warres, in the raigne of Henry the third, for the Great Charter.Th'inveterate Malice in their Bosomes bred, Who for their Charter wag'd a former Warre, Their angrie Syres; in them that Venom fed, As their true Heires of many a wide-mouth'd Skarre: Having Relation to their Victories over the Welsh and Scots, under Edward the first.Or was't the Bloud they had in Conquest shed, Having inlarg'd their Countries Bounds so farre, That did themselves against themselves oppose, A Citie of Spain, from whence wee anciently had our best Swords.With Blades of Bilbo changing English Blowes? 4 O, Thou the Wise Director of my Muse, Invocation.Upon whose Bountie all my Powers depend, Into my Brest thy sacred'st Fire infuse; Ravish my Spirit, this Great Worke to attend; Let the still Night my lab'red Lines peruse; That when my Poems gaine their wished end, Such, whose sad eyes shall read this Tragique Storie, In my weake Hand may see thy Might and Glorie. 5 Narration.What Care would plot, Dissention strove to crosse, Which like an Earthquake rent the tottering State; In Warre abroad they suffered publique Losse, And were at home despoyl'd by private hate: Whil'st them those strange Calamities did tosse, (For there was none that nourisht not Debate) Confusion did the common Peace confound; No helpe at hand, yet mortall was their wound. 6 The Prelacie, most powerfull in those times, did rather put on that Warre, then perswade to Peace.Thou Church, then swelling in thy Mightinesse, Which in thy Hand so ample Power didst hold, To stay those Factions, ere their full excesse, Which at thy pleasure thou might'st have control'd; Why didst not Thou those Outrages suppresse, Which to all Times, thy prayse might have enrol'd? Thou shouldst to them have layd the Holy Word, And not thy hand to the unholyed Sword. 7 Bloud-thirstie Warre arising first from Hell, The first Warres of the Barons beginning in the time of King John, and continuing long in the Raigne of Henry the third, his sonne. And seizing on this chiefe part of the Ile, Where it before neere fortie yeeres did dwell, And with abhorr'd Pollution did defile, In which so many a famous Souldier fell; By Edward Long-shanks banished awhile, Edward the first having peace at home, made Warres upon the Welsh and Scots. Transfer'd to Wales, and to Albania, there To ruine them, as it had ravin'd here. 8 Where hovering long with inauspicious wings, About the Verge of these distempered Clymes, By comming backe, new Mischiefe hither brings, To worke them up to those disasterous Crymes; Weakeneth their Power by her diminishings, And taking fast hold on those wicked Tymes, So farre inforc'd their Furie, that at length It crackt the Nerves which knit their ancient strength. 9 Whose frightfull Vision, at the first approach, With violent Madnesse strooke that desperate Age, And did not onely those Rebellions broach Amongst the Commons, but the divellish Rage Did on the best Nobilitie incroach, And in their damn'd Conspiracies, ingage The Royall Bloud; them likewise downe to bring, By unnaturall Treasons to their naturall King. 10 When in the North (whilst Horror yet was young) The fearefull Signes in the North of this Land, that fore-ran this Bloudie Warre, expressed in this Stanza, and the next following. Those dangerous Seasons swiftly comming on, Whilst o'er their heads portentuous Meteors hung, And in the Skies sterne Commets brightly shone, Prodigious Births were intermix'd among, Such as before to Times had beene unknowne; In bloudie Issues, forth the Earth doth breake, Weeping for them, whose Woes it could not speake. 11 And by the rankenesse of contagious Ayre, A mortall Plague invadeth Man and Beast; Which farre dispers'd, and raging every where, In doubt the same too quickly should have ceast, T'assure them of the Slaughter being neere, Yet was by Famine cruelly increast; As though the Heavens, in their remisfull doome, Tooke those they lov'd, from worser dayes to come. 12 The entrance into the Relation of the Storie.The levell course that we intend to goe, Now (to the end) that yee may cleerely see, And that we every circumstance may show, The state of Things, and truly what they be, And our Materialls how we doe bestow, With each Occurrent right in his degree; From these Portents we now divert our view, To bring to passe the Horrors that insue. 13 The first, and the principall cause of Quarrell betweene the King and the Barons.The calling backe of banish'd Gaveston, Gainst which, the Barons had to Long-shanks sworne; The Signiories, and high Promotion, Him in his Law-lesse Courses to suborne; Th'abetting of that wanton Minion, Who held the old Nobilitie in scorne; Stir'd up that hatefull and outragious Strife, Which cost so many an English-man his life. 14 Henry Lacy, Earle of Lincolne.O much-lov'd Lacy, hadst thou spar'd that breath, Which shortly after Nature thee deny'd, Thomas Plantaginet Earle of Lancaster, the sonne of Edmond, called Crouch-back, who was the second sonne of Henry the third.To Lancaster delivered at thy death, To whom thy only Daughter was affy'd, Taking for Pledge, his Knightly Oath and Faith, Stiffely to sticke upon the Barons side; Thy Manors, Rents, and Titles of Renowne, Had not so soone beene forfeit to the Crowne. 15 Those Lordships, Bruse to those two Spensers past, The two Spensers, by the favour of the King, bought the Lands of the Lord Bruse in the Marches of Wales, out of some of the Barons hands; for which, the Barons burnt the Towns there, belonging to the Spensers; and shortly, caused the King to banish them: A second and speciall cause of the Warre. Crossing the Barons vehement desire, As from Joves Arme, that fearefull Lightning cast, That fiftie Townes lay spent in hostile fire; Alas, too vaine and prodigall a waste, The strong effect of their conceived Ire: Urging the weake King, by a violent Hand, T'abjure those false Lords from the troubled Land. 16 When as the faire Queene progressing in Kent, Was there deny'd her entrance into Leeds By Badlesmer, a Baron eminent, The Lord Badlesmer, Owner of Leeds Castle. Against the King, that in this Course proceeds, Which further addeth to their discontent, A speciall Spring, which this great Mischiefe feeds; Wrong upon wrong, by heaping more and more, To thrust on that, which went too fast before. 17 Which more and more King Edwards hate increast, Whose mind ran still on Gaveston degraded, The thoughts of which, so settled in his Brest, That it had all his Faculties invaded: Which for the Spensers hap'ned out the best, The pride of the Spensers made the breach betwixt the King and Queene. By whom, thereto he chiefely was perswaded; And by whose Counsels he e're long was led To leave his bright Queene, and to flye her Bed. 18 That shee her selfe, who whilst shee stood in grace, Imploy'd her Powers these Discords to appease, When yet Confusion had not fully place, In Times not growne so dangerous as these, A Partie made in their afflicted case, Her willing Hand to his Destruction layes; That Time, whose soft Palme heals the wound of Warre, May cure the Sore, but never close the Skarre. 19 The first appearing of Mortimer.In all that Heat, then gloriously began, The serious Subject of my solid Vaine, Brave Mortimer, that some-what more then Man, Of the old Heroes great and God-like Straine, For whom, Invention doing all it can, His weight of Honour hardly shall sustaine, To beare his Name immortaliz'd, and hye, When he in Earth un-numbred yeeres shall lye. 20 Roger Mortimer the Unckle, and Roger, the Nephew.Whose Unckle then (whose Name his Nephew bare) The only comfort of the wofull Queene, Who from his Cradle held him as his care, In whom so many early Hopes were seene, For this yong Lord most wisely doth prepare, Whilst yet her deepe heart-goring Wound was greene, And on this faire advantage firmely wrought, To place him highly in her Princely thought. 21 The Character of Mortimer, in this Stanza and the next following.This was the Man, at whose unusuall Birth The Starres were said, to Councell to retyre, And in Aspects of Happinesse and Mirth, Mark'd him a Spirit, to Greatnesse to aspire, That had no mixture of the Drossie Earth, But all compact of perfect Heavenly fire; So well made up, that such a one as He, Jove in a Man, like Mortimer would be. 22 The quick'ning Vertue of which Nobler part, With so rare purenesse rectify'd his Bloud, And to so high a Temper wrought his Heart, That it could not be lock'd within a Floud, That no Misfortune possibly could thwart; Which from the Native Greatnesse where it stood, Shew'd at the first, the Pitch it was to flie, Could not with lesse be bounded, then the Skie. 23 Worthy the Grand-child of so great a Lord; Roger Mortimer Grandfather to this Roger. Who, whilst our Long-shanks fortunatly raign'd, Re-edify'd King Arthurs ancient Boord, Which he at goodly Kenelworth ordain'd, And to that former Glorie it restor'd, To which a hundred gallant Knights retain'd, With all the Pompe that might become a Court, Or might give Honour to that Martiall Sport. 24 The Heart-swolne Lords, with Furie throughly fir'd, Whom Edwards Wrongs to Vengeance still provoke, With Lancaster and Harford had conspir'd, Thomas Earle of Lancaster, and Bohun Earle of Harford. No more to beare the Spensers servile Yoke; The time is come, that they a Change desir'd; That they (the Bonds of their Allegiance broke) Resolv'd with Bloud their Libertie to buy, And in the Quarrell vow'd to live and die. 25 What Priviledge hath our Free-Birth, they say? The Barons murmure to be over-topt by Minions. Or in our Bloud, what Vertue doth remaine? To each lascivious Minion made a prey, That us and our Nobilitie disdaine, Whilst they in Triumph boast of our decay; Either those Spirits we never did retaine, That were our Fathers, or by Fate we fall Both from their Greatnesse, Libertie, and all. 26 Our Honor, lifted from that Soveraigne State, From whence at first it challenged the Being, And prostitute to Infamie and Hate, As with it selfe in all things disagreeing, Quite out of order, dis-proportionate, From the right way preposterously flying; Whilst Others are themselves, and only We Are not held those, We would but seeme to be. 27 Then to what end hath our great Conquest serv'd, Those Acts atchieved by the Norman Sword, Our Charters, Patents, and our Deeds reserv'd, Our Offices and Titles to record, The Crests that on our Monuments are carv'd, If they to us no greater good afford? Thus doe they murmure every one apart, With many a vex'd Soule, many a grieved Heart. 28 This while the Queene into deepe sorrow throwne, Wherein she wastes her goodly Youth away, Beyond beleefe, to all but Heaven unknowne: This Sparke, till now, that closely covered lay, By the sharpe breath of desp'rate Faction blowne, Converts her long Night to a wished Day; Her wofull Winter of Misfortune chearing, As the darke World at the bright Sunnes appearing. 29 The Queene is greatly perplexed, whilst things sort not out to her desire.Though much perplex'd amidst these hard Extremes, Whilst Helps fall short, that should her Hopes preferre, Nor clearely yet could she discerne those Beames, To her desires that else might lighten her, Her Thoughts oft changing, like deceitfull Dreames, In her sad Brest such violent Passions stirre; That (striving which each other should controule) Worke strange confusion in her troubled Soule. 30 To be debarr'd of that Imperiall State, Which to her Graces rightly did belong, Basely rejected, and repudiate, A vertuous Lady, goodly, faire, and yong; These with such fervour still doe intimate Her too-much settled and inveterate wrong; That to the least, all pardon shee denies, With Arguments of her Indignities. 31 Whilst, to dispatch, the angry Heavens pursue, What there, un-judg'd, had many a day depended, When all these Mischiefes to full ripenesse grew, And in their Harvest hasting to be ended: For all these Lines into one Centre drew, Which way soe're they seem'd to be extended, And all together, in proportion layd, Although but small, adde somewhat to her ayd. 32 Now comes the time, when Mortimer doth enter, Of great Imployment in this Tragique Act, His Youth and Courage boldly bid him venter, Prompting him still, how strongly he was backt, Who at this time, even as from Heaven was sent her, When the straight Course to her Desire was tract; And she upon more certaintie doth stay, In a direct, although a dangerous way. 33 This dreadfull Comet drew her wond'ring Eye, Which soone began his golden Head to reare, Whose glorious Fixure in so cleere a Skie, Strooke the Beholder with a horrid feare; And in a Region elevate so high, And by the forme wherein it did appeare, As the most skilfull wisely did divine, Fore-shew'd the Kingdome shortly to decline. 34 Yet still recoyling at the Spensers power, So often checkt with their intemp'rate pride, Th'inconstant Barons wavering everie houre, The fierce encounter of this boyst'rous Tide, That eas'ly might her livelyhood devoure, Had shee not those that skilfully could guide; Shee from Suspition cunningly retyres, Carelesse in shew, of what she most desires. 35 The great Policie of the most wise Queene.Dissembling so, as one that knew not ill, So can shee rule the greatnesse of her mind, As a most perfect Rect'resse of her will, Above the usuall weakenesse of her kind: For all these stormes, immoveable and still, Her secret Drift, the wisest misse to find; Nor will she know yet, what these Factions meant, But with a pleas'd Eye soothes sad Discontent. 36 The least Suspition craftily to heale, Still in her lookes Humilitie she beares; The safest way with Mightinesse to deale, So Policie, Religions habit weares; 'Twas then no time her grievance to reveale, “Hee's mad, which takes a Lyon by the eares. This knew the Queene, and this well know the wise: This must they learne, that rightly temporize. 37 Adam Torlton, Bishop of Hereford, a great Politician.The Bishop Torleton, learned'st of the Land, Upon a Text of Politiques to preach, Which he long studying, well did understand, And by a Method could as aptly teach: He was a Prelate of a potent hand, Wise was the Man that went beyond his reach: This subtill Tutor, Isabel had taught Points, into which King Edward never sought. 38 When Warre no longer can it selfe containe, But breaketh forth into a generall flame, And to be seene more visibly and plaine, Boldly it selfe dares publiquely proclaime, And as a poore thing proudly doth disdaine To give it selfe out by another Name, Or take upon it any strange Disguise, But now with Legions furiously doth rise. 39 As Severne lately in her Ebbes that sanke, A Simile of the first rising of the Barons. Vast and forsaken leaves th'uncovered Sands, Fetching full Tides, luxurious, high, and ranke, Seemes in her pride t'invade the neighb'ring Lands, Breaking her Limits, covering all her Banks, Threat'neth the proud Hills with her wat'rie Hands; As though she meant her Empyrie to have, Where even but lately she beheld her Grave. 40 From every place, when Souldiers farre and neere, Flocke to the Field, as Fortune lots their side, With th'ancient Weapons they had us'd to beare; Some, as they were directed by their Guide; Others againe, as they affected were; But the most part, as by their dutie tyde: As each one finds the motion of his blood, Let those that lead them, make the Quarrell good. 41 From Norfolke, and the Countries of the East, That with the Pike most skilfully could fight; Then those of Kent, unconquer'd of the rest, That to this day maintaine their ancient Right; For courage no whit second to the best, The Cornish men most active, bold, and light; Those neere the Those of Hampshire, Wiltshire, and Borderers of the Plaine of Salisbury, clayme the Vaward of the English Battels. Plaine, the Pole-axe best that wield, And clayme for theirs the Vaward of the Field. 42 The Noble Welsh, of th'ancient British Race; From Lancashire, Men famous for their Bowes; The Men of Ches-shire, chiefest for their place, Of Bone so bigge, as onely made for Blowes, Which for their faith are had in speciall grace, And have beene ever fearefull to their Foes: The Northerne then, in Feuds so deadly fell, That for their Speare and Horsemanship excell. 43 All that for use Experience could espie, Such as in Fennes and Marsh-lands use to trade, The doubtfull Foards and Passages to trie, With Stilts and Lope-staves, that doe aptliest wade, Most fit for Scouts and Currers to descrie; Those from the Mynes, with Pick-axe and with Spade, For Pioners best, that for intrenching are, Men chiefely needfull in the use of Warre. 44 O Noble Nation, furnished with Armes, So full of Spirit, as almost match'd by none! Had Heaven but blest thee, to foresee thy Harmes, And as thy valiant Nephewes did, have gone Paris, Roan, Orleance, shaking with Alarmes; The Conquest of France in the next raigne of Edward the third.As the bright Sunne, thy glorie then had shone: To other Realmes thou hadst transfer'd this Chance; Nor had your Sonnes been first that conquer'd France. 45 And thus on all hands setting up their rest, And all make forward for this mightie Day, Where every one prepares to doe his best, When at the stake their Lives and Fortunes lay, No crosse Event their Purposes to wrest, Being now on, in so direct a Way; Yet whilst they play this strange and doubtfull Game, The Queene stands off, and secretly gives ayme. 46 But Mortimer his foot had scarcely set Into the Road, where Fortune had to deale, But she dispos'd his forward course to let; Her lewd Condition quickly doth reveale, Glory to her vaine Deitie to get By him, whose strange birth bare her ominous Seale; Taking occasion from that very Houre, In him to prove and manifest her Power. 47 As when we see the early rising Sunne, A Similie of the first rising of Mortimer. With his bright Beames to emulate our sight; But when his Course yet newly is begun, The hum'rous Fogges deprive us of his Light, Till through the Clouds he his cleare Forehead runne, Climbing the Noone-stead in his glorious height: His cleare beginning, Fortune cloudeth thus, To make his Mid-day great and glorious. 48 The King (discreetly) that considered Good considerations of the King. The space of Earth, whereon the Barons stand, As what the Powers to them contributed, Then being himselfe but Partner of his Land; Of the small Strength and Armie that he led 'Gainst them which did so great a Power command, Wisely about him doth begin to looke: Great was the Taske which now he undertooke. 49 And warn'd by Danger to misdoubt the worst, In equall Scales whilst eithers Fortunes hung, He must performe the utmost that he durst, Or undergoe intolerable Wrong: As good to stirre, as after be enforc'd; To stop the Sourse whence all these Mischiefes sprung, He with the Marchers thinkes best to begin, Which first must lose, ere he could hope to winne. 50 The Mortimers being Men of greatest Might, Whose Name was dreadfull, and commanded farre, Sturdie to manage, of a haughtie Spright, Strongly ally'd, much followed, popular, On whom, if he but happily could light, He hop'd more eas'ly to conclude the Warre; Which he intendeth speedily to trie, To quit that first, which most stood in his eye. 51 For which, he expeditiously provided, That part of Land into his Power to get; Which, if made good, might keepe his Foes divided, Their Combination cunningly to let; Which should they joyne, would be so strongly sided, Two Armies on foot by the Barons, one in the West, the other in the North.Two mightie Hoasts, together safely met, The face of Warre would looke so sterne and great, As it might threat to heave him from his Seat. 52 Wherefore the King from London setteth forth, With a full Armie, furnish'd of the best, Accompany'd with men of speciall worth, Which to this Warre his Promises had prest: Great Lancaster was Lord of all the North, The Mortimers were Masters of the West; He towards mid-England makes the way 'twixt either, Which they must crosse, ere they could come together. 53 Strongly inveagled with delightfull Hope, Stoutly t'affront and shoulder with Debate, Knowing to meet with a resolved Troupe, That came prepar'd with Courage, and with Hate; Whose stubborne Crests if he inforc'd to stoupe, It him behoves to tempt some powerfull Fate, And through sterne Guards of Swords and hostile Fire, Make way to Peace, or shamefully retire. 54 The Mortimers so called, for their great power in the Marches.When now the Marchers, well upon their way, (Expecting those, that them Supplyes should bring, Which had too long abus'd them by Delay) The Mortimers intercepted on the sudden.Were suddenly incountred by the King; They then perceive, that dilatorie stay To be the causer of their ruining, When at their bosomes blacke Destruction stood, With open Jawes prepared for their Blood. 55 And by the shifting of th'unconstant Wind, Seeing what Weather they were like to meet, Which even at first so awkwardly they find, Before they could give Sea-roomth to their Fleet, Cleane from their Course, and cast so farre behind, And yet in perill every houre to split; Some unknowne Harbor suddenly must sound, Or runne their Fortunes desp'rately on ground. 56 The elder Peere, grave, politique, and wise, Which had all dangers absolutely scan'd, Finding high time his Nephew to advise, Since now their state stood on this desp'rate hand, And from this Mischiefe, many more to rise, Which his Experience made him understand; Nephew (sayth he) 'tis but in vaine to strive, Counsell must helpe, our safetie to contrive. 57 The downe-right Perill, present in our eye, The Counsell of the elder Mortimer to his Nephew. Not to be shun'd, we see what it assures; Thinke then what weight upon our Fall doth lye, And what our Being, this Designe procures; As to our Friends, what good may grow thereby, Proove, which the Test of Reason best endures; “For who observes strict Policies true Lawes, “Shifts his Proceeding, to the varying Cause. 58 To hazzard fight with the Imperiall Powers, Will our small Troupes undoubtedly apall; Then, this our Warre us wilfully devoures: Yeelding our selves, yet thus we lose not all, We leave our Friends this smaller Force of ours, Reserv'd for them, though haplesly we fall; “That Weakenesse ever hath a glorious Hand, “That falls it selfe, to make the Cause to stand. 59 'Twixt unexpected, and so dangerous Ills, That's saf'st, wherein we smallest Perill see, Which, to make choise of, Reason justly wills, And it doth best with Policie agree: The idle vulgar Breath, it nothing skills, 'Tis sound Discretion must our Pilot be; “He that doth still the fairest meanes preferre, “Answers Opinion, howsoe're he erre. 60 And to the Worlds eye seeming yet so strong, By our descending willingly from hence, 'Twill shew we were provoked by our wrong, Not having other sinister Pretence: This Force left off, that doth to us belong, Will in Opinion lessen our Offence; “Men are not ever incident to losse, “When Fortune seemes them frowardly to crosse. 61 Nor give we Envie absolute excesse, To search so farre, our Subtilties to find, There's neerer meanes, this Mischiefe to redresse, And make successefull what is yet behind: Let's not our selves of all Hope dis-possesse, Fortune is ever variously inclin'd; “A small Advantage in th'Affaires of Kings, “Guides a slight Meanes, to compasse mighty Things. 62 This speech so caught his Nephewes plyant youth, (Who his grave Eam did ever much respect) Proceeding from Integritie and Truth; Well could he counsell, well could he direct, With strong Perswasions, which he still pursu'th; Which in a short time shew'd by the effect, “A Wise mans Counsell, by a secret Fate, “Seeming from Reason, yet proves fortunate. 63 To which, the King they gravely doe invite, By the most strict and ceremonious way; No Circumstance omitted, nor no Rite, That might give colour to their new Essay, Or that Applause might publiquely excite: To which, the King doth willingly obay: The King accepteth the Mortimers submission. Who like themselves, in seeing Danger neere, Rather accepts a Doubt, then certaine Feare. 64 Which he receives, in presage of his good, To his Successe auspiciously apply'd; Which somewhat cool'd his much distemp'red Blood, Ere he their force in doubtfull Armes had try'd: And whilst they thus in his Protection stood, At his disposing wholly to abide, He first, in safetie, doth dismisse their Power, Then sends them both his Pris'ners to the Tower. 65 O all-preparing Providence Divine! In thy large Booke, what Secrets are enrol'd? What sundry Helpes doth thy great Power assigne, To prop that Course which thou intend'st to hold? What mortall Sense is able to define Thy Mysteries, thy Counsels manifold? It is thy Wisdome, strangely that extends Obscure Proceedings to apparant Ends. 66 This was the meanes, by which the Fates dispose, More dreadfull Plagues upon that Age to bring; Utter Confusion on the heads of those, That were before the Barons ruining; With the subversion of the Publiques Foes, The Murther of the miserable King; And that which 'came Catastrophe to all, Great Mortimers inevitable fall. 67 This, to these Troubles lends a little Breath, As the first Pawse, to hearten this Affaire, And for a while deferres oft-threatning Death, Whilst each their Breach by leysure would repaire, And as a Bound, their Furie limiteth; But in this manner, whilst things strangely fare, Horror beyond all wonted Bounds doth swell, As the next Canto fearefully shall tell. The end of the first Canto. The second Canto. The Argument. At Burton Bridge the puissant Powers are met, The Forme and Order of the doubtfull Fight, Whereas the King the Victorie doth get, And the prowd Barons are inforc'd to flight; When they againe towards Borough forward set, Where they by him were vanquished out-right; Lastly, the Lawes doe execute their Power On those, which there the Sword did not devoure. 1 This chance of Warre, that suddenly had swept So large a share from their selected store, Which for their helpe they carefully had kept, That to their aid might stil have added more; By this ill-lucke into their Armie crept, Made them much weaker then they were before; So that the Barons reinforc'd their Bands, Finding their Hearts to stand in need of Hands. 2 For deadly Hate, so long and deepely rooted, Could not abide to heare the name of Peace, So that Discretion but a little booted 'Gainst that, thereby which only did increase; For the least Griefe, by Malice was promoted, Anger set on, beginning to surcease; So that all Counsell much their eares offended, But what to Spoyle and sad Invasion tended. 3 All up in Action for the publique Cause, Scarcely the mean'st, but he a partie stood, Tax'd by the Letter of the censuring Lawes, In his estate, if fayling in his Blood; And who was free'st, intangled by some Clause, Which to their Furie gives continuall food; “For where Confusion once hath gotten hold, “Till all fall flat, it hardly is control'd. 4 And now by Night, when as pale Leaden Sleepe Upon their eye-lids heavily did dwell, And step by step, on every Sense did creepe, Mischiefe, that blacke inhabitant of Hell, Which never failes continuall Watch to keepe, Fearefull to thinke, a horrid thing to tell, Entred the Place, whereas those warlike Lords Lay mayl'd in Armour, gyrt with irefull Swords. 5 A description of Mischiefe.She with a sharpe sight, and a meager looke, Was alwayes prying where she might doe ill, In which, the Fiend continuall pleasure tooke, (Her starved Bodie, Plentie could not fill) Searching in every Corner, every Nooke, With winged feet, too swift to worke her will; Furnish'd with deadly Instruments she went, Of every sort, to wound where so she meant. 6 Having a Viall fill'd with banefull Wrath, A River fained to be in Hell.(Brought from Cocytus by that cursed Spright) Which in her pale Hand purposely she hath, And drops the Poyson upon every Wight; For to each one she knew the readie Path, Though in the midst and dead time of the Night; Whose strength too soone invadeth every Peere, Not one escap'd her, that she commeth neere. 7 That, the next Morning, breaking in the East, With a much-troubled and affrighted Mind, Each, whom this Venome lately did infest, The strong effect in their swolne stomacks find; Now doth the Poyson boyle in every Brest, To sad Destruction every one's inclin'd, Rumors of Spoyle through every eare doe flye, And threat'ning Furie sits in every eye. 8 This done, in haste shee to King Edward hyes, Who late growne proud upon his good Successe, His time to Feasts and Wantonnesse applyes, And with crown'd Cups his Sorrowes doth suppresse, Upon his Fortune wholly that relyes; And in the Bosome of his Courtly Presse, Vaunteth the hap of this victorious Day, Whilst the sicke Land in Sorrow pines away. 9 Thither she comes, and in a Minions shape, She getteth neere the Person of the King, And as he tast's the Liquor of the Grape, Into the Cup her Poyson she doth wring: Not the least drop untainted doth escape, For to that purpose she her store did bring; Whose strong commixture (as the Sequell try'd) Fill'd his hot Veines with Arrogance and Pride. 10 That having both such Courage, and such Might, As to so great a Bus'nesse did belong, Neither yet thinke, by their unnaturall Fight, What the Republique suffred them among; For mystie Error so deludes their Sight, (Which still betwixt them and cleere Reason hung) And their Opinions in such sort abus'd, As that their Fault can never be excus'd. 11 Now our Minerva puts on dreadfull Armes, Further to wade into this Bloudie Warre, And from her slumber wak'ned with Alarmes, Riseth, to sing of many a Massacre, Of gloomie Magiques, and benumming Charmes, Of many a deepe Wound, many a fearefull Skarre; The Socke, or soft Shoo, used in Comicke and light Poesies, from which hee ascendeth to this Tragique Poeme.For that low Socke, wherein she us'd to tread, Marching in Greaves, a Helmet on her Head. 12 Whilst thus vaine Hope doth these false Lords delude, Who having drawne their Forces to a Head, They their full purpose seriously pursu'd, By Lancaster and valiant Harford led, Their long Proceeding lastly to conclude; Whilst now to meet, both Armies hotly sped, Burton upon Trent in Staffordshire.The Barons taking Burton in their way, Till they could heare where Edwards Armie lay. 13 To which, Report too suddenly bewray'd Their manner of encamping, and the Place, Their present Strength, and their expected Ayd, As what might most avayle them in this Case: The speedie March th'Imperiall Power had made, Had brought them soone within a little space; For still the King conducted had his Force, Which way he heard the Barons bent their Course. 14 The Forrest of Needwood in Staffordshire.Upon the East, from Bushie Needwoods side, There riseth up an easie-climbing Hill, At whose faire foot, the Silver Trent doth slide, And the slow Ayre, with her soft murmuring, fill; Which, with the store of liberall Brookes supplyde, Th'insatiate Meads continually doth swill; The situation of Burton upon Trent.Over whose Streame, a Bridge of wond'rous strength Leads on from Burton, to that Hill in length. 15 Upon the Mount, the King his Tentage fixt, Tentage used in place, for the Tents generally carried along with the Armie. And in the Towne, the Barons lay in sight, When as the Trent was risen so betwixt, That for a while prolong'd th'unnaturall fight, With many Waters that it selfe had mixt, To stay their Furie, doing all it might; “Things which presage both good and ill, there be, “Which Heaven fore-shewes, but will not let us see. 16 The Heaven (ev'n) mourning o'er our Heads doth sit, Greeving to see the Times so out of course, Looking on them, who never looke at it, And in meere pittie, melteth with Remorse; Longer from Teares that could not stay a whit, Whose influence on every lower Sourse, From the swolne fluxure of the Clouds, doth shake A ranke Impostume upon every Lake. 17 O Warlike Nation, hold thy conqu'ring Hand, Even senselesse Things do warne thee yet to pawse; Thy Mother Soyle, on whom thou arm'd do'st stand, Which should restraine thee by all naturall Lawes, Canst thou (unkind) inviolate that Band? Nay, Heaven and Earth are angry with the Cause; Yet stay thy foot, in Mischiefs ugly Gate. “Ill comes too soone, Repentance oft too late. 18 O, can the Clouds weepe over thy decay, Yet not one drop fall from thy droughtie eyes! See'st thou the Snare, and wilt not shun the way, Nor yet be warn'd by passed Miseries? 'Tis yet but early in this dismall Day, Let late Experience learne thee to be wise; “An Ill foreseene, may eas'ly be prevented, “But hap'd, un-help'd, though ne'er inough lamented. 19 Remembring the great overthrow they had received by the Scots at Banocksburne.Cannot the Scot of your late Slaughter boast, And are yee yet scarce healed of the Sore? Is't not inough yee have alreadie lost, But your owne Madnesse must needs make it more? Will yee seeke Safetie in some foraine Coast? Your Wives and Children pitied yee before: But when your own Blouds your own Swords imbrue, Who pitties them, who should have pittied you? 20 The sudden preparation of the Kings Armie, to passe the River to the Barons.The neighb'ring Groves are spoyled of their Trees, For Boats, and Timber, to assay the Flood, Where Men are lab'ring as 'twere Summer Bees, Some hollowing Trunkes, some binding heapes of Wood, Some on their Brests, some working on their Knees, To winne the Banke whereon the Barons stood; Which, o'er the Current they by strength must tew, To shed that Bloud, which many an Age shall rew. 21 Pieces of Armour well knowne to Souldiers.Some sharp their Swords, some right their Murrians set, Their Greaves and Pouldrons others rivet fast, The Archers now their bearded Arrowes whet, Whilst every where the clam'rous Drums are bras'd; Some taking view, where they sure ground might get, Not one, but some advantage doth fore-cast; With Ranks and Files, each Plaine &amp; Medow swarmes, As all the Land were clad in angry Armes. 22 The Crests and Badges of each Nobler Name, Against their Owners rudely seeme to stand, As angry for th'Atchievements whence they came, That to their Fathers gave that generous Brand. O yee unworthie of your ancient Fame, Against your selves to lift your conqu'ring Hand; Since foraine Swords your Height could not abate, By your owne Pride, your selves to ruinate! 23 Upon his Surcote, valiant Nevil bore Some short Blazons of the Bearings of some of the English Nobilitie, in this, and the next Stanza following, expressed in the termes of Heraldrie. A Silver Saltoyre, upon Martiall Red; A Ladies Sleeve, high-spirited Hastings wore; Ferrer his Taberd, with rich Verry spred, Well knowne in many a Warlike Match before; A Raven sat on Corbets armed Head; And Culpepper, in Silver Armes enrayl'd, Bare thereupon a bloudie Bend engrayl'd. 24 The Noble Percy, in this dreadfull Day, With a bright Cressant in his Guidehome came, In his white Cornet, Verdon doth display A fret of Gueles, priz'd in this mortall Game, That had been seene in many a doubtfull Fray, His Lances Penons stayned with the same; The angry Horse, chaf'd with the stubborne Bit, With his hard Hoofe the Earth in furie smit. 25 I could the summe of Staffords arming show, What Colours, Rosse and Courtney did unfold, Great Warrens Blazon I could let you know, And all the glorious Circumstance have told, Nam'd every Ensigne as they stood arow; But O, deare Muse, too soone thou art control'd! For in remembrance of their evill speed, My Pen, for Inke, warme drops of Bloud doth sheed. 26 On the Kings part, th'Imperiall Standard's pitch'd, With all the Hatchments of the English Crowne, Great Lancaster (with no lesse Power enrich'd) Sets the same Leopards in his Colours downe: O, if yee be not frantique, or bewitch'd, Yet doe but see, that on your selves you frowne: A little note of diff'rence is in all, How can the same stand, when the same doth fall? 27 Behold the Eagles, Lyons, Talbots, Beares, The Badges of your famous Ancestries; Shall those brave Marks, by their inglorious Heires, Stand thus oppos'd against their Families? More ancient Armes no Christian Nation beares, Reliques unworthy of their Progenies; Those Beasts yee beare, doe in their kinds agree, O, that then Beasts, more savage Men should be! 28 And whilst the King doth in sad Councell sit, How he might best the other Banke recover, See how Misfortune still her time can fit! Such as were sent, the Countrey to discover, (As up and downe, from place to place they flit) Had found a Foard, to passe their Forces over; “Ill Newes hath Wings, and with the Wind doth goe, “Comfort's a Cripple, and comes ever slow. 29 These Earles, on the Kings part, were John Britan, Earle of Richmont, John Warren, Earle of Surrey, and Aymer de Valence, Earle of Pembroke, &amp; Edmond of Woodstocke, Earle of Kent, the Kings younger Brother.When Edward fearing Lancasters Supplyes, Proud Richmont, Surrey, &amp; great Pembroke sent, On whose Successe, he mightily relyes, Under whose Conduct, halfe his Armie went, The neerest way conducted by the Spyes; And he himselfe, and Edmond, Earle of Kent, Upon the Hill, in sight of Burton lay, Watching to take advantage of the Day. 30 Stay, Surrey, stay, thou may'st too soone be gone, Pawse till this Heat be somewhat over-past, Full little know'st thou whither thou do'st runne; Richmont and Pembroke, never make such haste, Yee doe but strive to bring more Horror on: “Never seeke Sorrow, for it comes too fast; Why strive yee thus, to passe this fatall Floud, To fetch but Wounds, and shed your neerest Bloud? 31 Great Lancaster, yet sheath thy angrie Sword, The sonne of Crouchback and cousin German to the King, as is shewed in the Notes upon the 14. Stanza of the first Canto. On Edwards Armes, whose edge thou should'st not set, Thy naturall Kinsman, and thy Sov'raigne Lord, Both from the Loynes of our Plantaginet, Call yet to mind thy once engaged Word; Canst thou thy Oath to Long-shanks thus forget? “Men should performe, before all other things, “The serious Vowes they make, to God, and Kings. 32 The Winds were hush'd (no little Breath doth blow) A description of the Conflict at Burton, in 13. Stanza's following. Which seems sat still, as though they list'ning stood, With trampling Crowds, the very Earth doth bow, And through the Smoake, the Sunne appear'd like Blood; What with the Showt, and with the dreadfull Show, The Heards of Beasts ran bellowing to the Wood; When Drums and Trumpets to the Charge did sound, As they would shake the grosse Clouds to the ground. 33 The Earles then charging with their power of Horse, Taking a Signall when they should begin, Being in view of th'Imperiall force, Which at that time assay'd the Bridge to win, Which made the Barons change their former course, T'avoid the present Danger they were in; Which on the sudden had they not fore-cast, Of their last Day, that Houre had beene the last. 34 When from the Hill the Kings maine Powers come downe, Which had Aquarius to their valiant Guide, An expert Souldier of those times. Brave Lancaster &amp; Harford, from the Towne, Doe issue forth upon the other side, Peere against Peere, the Crowne against the Crowne, The King assayles, the Barons munify'd; Englands Red Crosse upon both sides doth flye, Saint George, Patron of the English. S. George, the King, S. George, the Barons crye. 35 A Simile of the encountring of the Armies.Like as an Exhalation hot and drie, Amongst the Ayre-bred moystie Vapours throwne, Spetteth his Lightning forth outragiously, Rending the thicke Clouds with the Thunder stone, Whose fierie Splinters through the thinne Ayre flye, That with the Horror, Heaven and Earth doth grone; With the like Clamour, and confused O, To the dread Shock the desp'rate Armies goe. 36 There might Men see the famous English Bowes, Wherewith our Foes we wonted to subdue, Shoot their sharpe Arrowes in the face of those, Which oft before victoriously them drew; Yet shun their Ayme; and troubled in the Loose, Those well-wing'd Weapons mourning as they flew, Slip'd from the Bow-string, impotent, and slacke, As to the Archers they would faine turne backe. 37 As they are supposed, to be descended from the Trojans, by the Britans, the first Inhabitants of this Island.Behold the Remnant of Troyes ancient Stocke, Laying on Blowes, as Smyths on Anvyls strike, Grappling together in the fearefull Shocke, Where still the strong encountreth with the like, (And each as ruthlesse as the hard'ned Rocke) Wer't with the Speare, or Browne Bill, or the Pike, Still as the Wings, or Battels came together, Ere fortune gave advantage yet to either. 38 From batt'red Helmes, with ev'ry envious Blow, The scatt'red Plumes flye loosely here and there, To the Beholder like to flakes of Snow, That ev'ry light breath on its Wings doth beare, As they had sense and feeling of our Woe: And thus affrighted with the sudden feare, Now back, now forward, such strange windings make, As though uncertaine which way they should take. 39 Slaughter alike invadeth either Hoast, Whilst still the Battell strongly doth abide, Which ev'ry where runnes raking through the Coast, As't pleas'd outragious Furie it to guide, Yet not suffic'd, where tyrannizing most; So that their Wounds, like Mouthes, by gaping wide, Made as they meant to call for present Death, Had they but Tongues, their deepnesse gives them breath. 40 Here lyes a heape halfe slaine, and partly drown'd, Gasping for breath amongst the slymie Segges, And there a sort layd in a deadly Swoun'd, Trod with the Prease into the Mudde and Dregges; Others lye bleeding on the firmer ground, Hurt in the Bodies, maym'd of Armes and Legges; One sticks his Foe, his Scalpe another cuts, Ones feet intangled in anothers guts. 41 One his assayling Enemie beguiles, As from the Bridge he fearefully doth fall, Crush'd with his weight upon the Stakes and Pyles; Some in their gore upon the Pavement sprall, Our Native Bloud, our Native Earth defiles, And dire Destruction overwhelmeth all; Such hideous Shrikes the Bedlam Souldiers breath, As the damn'd Sp'rits had howled from beneath. 42 The Faction still defying Edwards might, Edmond of Wood-stock, with the Men of Kent, Charging afresh, renues the doubtfull Fight Upon the Barons, languishing and spent, Bringing new matter for a Tragique sight; Forth against whom, their skilfull Warriors went, Bravely to end, what bravely did begin, Their Noblest Sp'rits will quickly lose, or win. 43 A Catalogue of many of the Barons, that were with the Earles of Lancaster and Harford, in two Stanza's.As before Troy, bright Thetis God-like Sonne, Talbot himselfe in this fierce Conflict bare, Mowbray in fight him matchlesse Honour wonne, Clifford for Life seem'd little but to care, Awdley and Elmsbridge Perill scorne to shunne, Gifford seem'd Danger to her teeth to dare, Nor Badlesmer gave back to Edwards Power, As though they strove whom Death should first devoure. 44 Ile not commend thee Mountfort, nor thee Teis, Else your high Valour much might justly merit; Nor Denvyle, dare I whisper of thy prayse; Nor Willington, will I applaud thy Spirit; Your Facts forbid, that I your Fame should rayse; Nor Damory, thy due may'st thou inherit; Bayes, for Prayse or Commendations.Your Bayes must be your well-deserved blame, For your ill actions quench my sacred flame. 45 O, had you fashion'd your great Deeds by them, Who summon'd Their Ancestors, that went with Richard Cœur de Lyon to the Warres against the Pagans. Acon with an English Drum; Or theirs, before, that to Those before them, that went with Duke Robert, the eldest son of the Conqueror, under the Conduct of Godfrey of Bulloyne, to the Holy Land. Jerusalem Went with the gen'rall Power of Christendome; Then had yee raught Fames richest Diadem, As they who fought to free the Saviours Tombe, And like them, had immortaliz'd your Names, Where now my Song can be but of your Shames. 46 O Age inglorious, Armes untimely borne, When that approved and victorious Shield Must in this civill Massacre be torne, Brus'd with the Blowes of many a foraine Field; And more, in this sad Overthrow be worne By those, in flight inforc'd it up to yeeld; For which, since then, the Stones for very dread, Against rough stormes, cold drops for teares doe shead. 47 When soone King Edwards faint &amp; wav'ring friends, Which had this while stood doubtfully to pawse, When they perceive, that Destinie intends, That his Successe shall justifie his Cause, Each in himselfe fresh Courage apprehends, “(For Victorie both Feare and Friendship drawes) And smile on him, on whom they late did frowne, All lend their hands to hew the conqu'red downe. 48 That scarce a Man, which Edward late did lacke, Whilst the proud Barons bare an upright Face, But (when they saw, that they had turn'd their backe) Joynes with the King, to prosecute their Chase, The Baronage so headlong goes to wracke; In the just tryall of so neere a Case, Inforc'd to prove the fortune of the Coast, The Day at Burton that had cleerely lost. 49 And to the aid of the victorious King, (Which more and more gave vigour to his hope, With good Successe him still encouraging, And to his Actions lent an ampler Scope) Sir Andrew Herckley happily doth bring, This Knight after created Earle of Carlel. On their light Horse a valiant Northerne Troupe, Arm'd but too aptly, and with too much speed, Most to doe harme, when least thereof was need. 50 When still the Barons making forth their way, Through Places best for their Advantage knowne, Retaine their Armie, bodyed as they may, By their Defeat, farre weaker that was growne; In their best skill devising day by day, T'offend th'Assaylant, and defend their owne, Of their Mis-haps the utmost to endure, If nothing else their Safetie might assure. 51 In their sad flight, with Furie followed thus, Tracing the North through many a tyresome Strait, And forc'd through many a Passage perillous, To Borough Bridge, led by their lucklesse Fate: Bridges Their first defeat at Burton Bridge, the last at Borough Bridge. should seeme to Barons ominous, For there they lastly were precipitate; Which A very remarkable thing of that place, where the Barons were overthrowne. place, the marke of their Mischance doth beare, For since that time, Grasse never prosp'red there. 52 Where, for new Bloudshed they new Battels rang'd, And take new Breath, to make Destruction new: Chang'd is their Ground, but yet their Fate unchang'd, Which too directly still doth them pursue; Nor are they, and their Miseries estrang'd, To their Estates though they meere strangers grew; The only hope whereon they doe depend, With Courage is to consummate their end. 53 A Simile of the desperate Miserie of the Barons.Like as a Heard of over-heated Deere, By hot-spur'd Hunters lab'red to be caught, With Hues and Hounds recov'red ev'ry where, When as they find their speed availes them naught, Upon the Toyles runne headlong, without feare, With noyse of Hounds, and Hollow's, as distraught; Even so the Barons, in this desp'rate case, Turne upon those which lately did them chase. 54 Ensigne beards Ensigne, Sword 'gainst Sword doth shake, Drum brawles with Drum, as Ranke doth Ranke oppose, Ther's not a Man that care of Life doth take, But Death in earnest to his Bus'nesse goes, A gen'rall Havocke as of all to make, And with Destruction doth them all inclose, Dealing it selfe impartially to all, Friend by his friend, as foe by foe doth fall. 55 Yet the brave Barons, whilst they doe respire, (In spight of Fortune, as they stood prepar'd) With Courage charge, with Comelinesse retyre, Make good their Ground, and then relieve their Guard, Withstand the Ent'rer, then pursue the Flyer, New-forme their Battell, shifting ev'ry Ward; As your high Skill, were but your Quarrell good, O Noble Spirits, how deare had beene your Blood! 56 That well-arm'd Band, ambitious Herckley led, Of which, the Barons never dreamt before, Then greatly stood King Edwards Power in stead, And in the Fight assayl'd the Enemie sore: O Day most fatall, and most full of dread! Never can Time thy ruinous Waste restore; Which with his strength though he attempt to doo, Well may he strive for, and yet fayle of too. 57 Pale Death beyond his wonted Bounds doth swell, Carving proud flesh in Cantles out at large; As Leaves in Autumne, so the Bodies fell, Under sharpe Steele, at ev'ry boyst'rous Charge: O, what sad Pen can their Destruction tell! Where Scalpes lay beaten like the batt'red Targe; And every one he claymeth as his right, Whose lucke it was not to escape by flight. 58 Those Warlike Ensignes, waving in the Field, Which lately seem'd to brave th'imbattell'd Foe, Longer not able their owne weight to wield, Their loftie Tops to the base Dust doe bow; Here sits a Helmet, and there lyes a Shield: O, ill did Fate those ancient Armes bestow! Which as a Quarry on the soyl'd Earth lay, Seiz'd on by Conquest, as a glorious Prey. 59 Where Noble Bohun, that most Princely Peere, Harford, much honor'd, and of high desert, And to this Nation none as he so deare, Passing the Bridge with a resolved heart, To stop his Souldiers, which retyring were, The unfortunate end of the Earle of Harford.Was 'twixt two Plankes slaine through his lower part; But Lancaster, not destin'd there to die, Taken, reserv'd to further Miserie. 60 Whose Tragique Scene, some Muse vouchsafe to sing: His, of five Earledomes who then liv'd possest, A Brother, Sonne, and Unckle to a King, With Favour, Friends, and with Abundance blest: What could Man thinke, or could devise the thing, That but seem'd wanting to his worldly Rest? “But on this Earth, what's free from Fortunes Power? “What an Age got, is lost in halfe an houre. 61 Some few, themselves in Sanctuaries hide; Which, though they have the mercie of the place, Yet are their Bodies so unsanctify'd, As that their Soules can hardly hope for grace; Where, they in Feare and Penurie abide A poore dead Life, which length'neth but a space; Hate stands without, whilst Horror still within Prolongs their shame, yet pard'neth not their sinne. 62 A vehement expression of the ensuing Massacre of the Barons.Nor was Death then contented with the dead, Of full Revenge as though it were deny'd, And till it might have that accomplished, It held it selfe in nothing satisfy'd; And with delayes no longer to be fed, An unknowne Torment further doth provide, That dead Men should in Miserie remaine, To make the Living die with greater paine. 63 Yee Sov'raine Cities of this wofull Ile, In Cypresse Wreaths, and your most sad Attyre, Prepare your selves to build the Funerall Pile, Lay your pale Hands to this exequious Fire, All Mirth and Comfort from your Streets exile, Fill'd with the groanes of Men, when they expire; The Noblest Bloud approching to be shed, That ever dropt from any of your Dead. 64 When Thomas, Earle of Lancaster, that late Th'rebellious Barons trayt'rously retain'd, As the chiefe Agent in this great Debate, Was for the same (ere many dayes) arraign'd, 'Gainst whom, at Pomfret they articulate, (To whom those Treasons chiefely appertain'd;) Thomas, Earle of Lancaster, beheaded at Pomfret. Whose Proofes apparant, so well, nay, ill sped, As from his shoulders rest his rev'rend Head. 65 Yet Lancaster, it is not thy lost breath, That can assure the safetie of the Crowne, Or that can make a Covenant with Death, To warrant Edward, what he thinks his owne; But he must pay the forfait of his Faith, His word forfaited to the Barons, for recalling Gaveston, and the Spensers. When they shall rise, which he hath trodden downe; “All's not a Mans that is from others rackt, “And other Agents other wayes doe act. 66 Nor was it long, but in that fatall place, The way to Death where Lancaster had led, But many other, in the selfe-same case, Him in like manner sadly followed. London, would thou hadst had thy former grace, Few Cities, or great Townes of England, wherein some of the Barons, or their Accomplices, were not executed. As thou art first, most Bloud that thou hadst shed, By other Cities not exceeded farre, Whose Streets devoure the Remnant of that Warre. 67 O Parents ruthfull and heart-renting sight! To see that Sonne, that your soft Bosomes fed, His Mothers Joy, his Fathers sole Delight, That with much Cost, yet with more Care was bred; O Spectacle (even) able to affright A senselesse Thing, and terrifie the Dead! His deare, deare Bloud, upon the cold Earth powr'd, His quart'red Coarse, of Crowes and Kytes devour'd. 68 But 'tis not you that here complaine alone, Or to your selves this fearefull Portion share; Here's strange and choise varietie of Moane, Poore Orphans teares with Widowes mixed are, With many Friends sigh, many a Maidens Groane; So innocent, so simply pure, and rare, As Nature, which till then had silence kept, Neere burst with Sorrow, bitterly had wept. 69 O Bloudie Age! had not these things beene done, I had not now, in these more calmer Times, Into the search of those past Troubles runne; Nor had my Virgin unpolluted Rimes Alt'red the course wherein they first begun, To sing these horrid and unnaturall Crimes; The Subject of my Sonets.My Layes had still been of Ideas Bowre, Two Rivers of Warwickeshire.Of my deare Ancor, or her loved Stowre. 70 Nor other Subject then your Selfe, had chose, Your Birth, your Vertues, and your high Respects, Whose Bounties oft have nourish'd my Repose; The Patron of his Poems.You, whom my Muse ingenuously elects, Denying Earth your brave Thoughts to inclose, Maugre the Momists, and Satyricke Sects; That whilst my Verse to after-Times is sung, You may live with me, and be honor'd long. 71 But greater things my Subject hath in store, Still to her Taske my armed Muse to keepe, And offreth her Occasion as before, Whereon she may in mournefull Verses weepe; And as a Ship being gotten neere the Shore, By awkward Winds re-driven to the Deepe, So is the Muse, from whence she came of late, Into the Businesse of a troubled State. The end of the second Canto. The third Canto. The Argument. By sleepie Potions that the Queene ordaynes, Lord Mortimer escapes out of the Tower; And by false Sleights, and many subtill Traynes, She gets to France, to rayse a foraine Power: The French King leaves his Sister; Need constraynes The Queene to Henault, in a happie Houre; Edward, her Sonne, to Philip is affide; They for Invasion instantly provide. 1 Scarse had these passed Miseries an end, But other Troubles instantly began; As Mischiefe doth new Matter apprehend, By things that still irregularly ran: For further yet their Furie doth extend; All was not yeelded, that King Edward wan; And some there were, in Corners that did lye, Which o'er his Actions had a watchfull eye. 2 When as the King (whilst things thus fairely went) Who by this happie Victorie grew strong, Summon'd at Yorke a solemne Parlament, T'uphold his Right, and helpe the Spensers wrong, (In all Affaires t'establish his Intent) Whence more and more his Minions Greatnesse sprong; Whose Counsels still, in ev'ry Bus'nesse crost Th'inraged Queene, in all Misfortunes tost. 3 When as the eld'st, a Man extremely hated, Hugh Spenser the elder. (Whom, till that time, the King could not preferre, Untill he had the Barons Pride abated) That Parlament made Earle of Winchester; As Herckley, Earle of Carlel he created; For his Service against the Barons, at Borough Bridge. And likewise, Baldock he made Chancelor; One, whom the King had for his Purpose wraught, A Man, as subtill, so corrupt and naught. 4 When as Mis-haps (that seldome come alone) Thicke in the necks of one another fell; The Scot began a new Invasion, And France did thence the English Powers expell, The Irish set the English Pale upon, At home, the Commons ev'ry day rebell; Mischiefe on Mischiefe, Curse doth follow Curse, One Ill scarce past, but after comes a worse. 5 For Mortimer, that Wind most fitly blew, Troubling their eyes, which otherwise might see, Whilst the wise Queene, who all Advantage knew, Was closely casting, how to set him free; And did the Plot so seriously pursue, Till she had found the Meanes how it should be, Against Opinion, and Imperious Might, To worke her owne Ends, through the Jawes of Spight. 6 And to that purpose she a Potion made, In Operation of that poys'ning Power, That it the Spirits could presently invade, And quite dis-sense the Senses in an houre, With such cold numnesse, as it might perswade That very Death the Patient did devoure, For certaine Houres, and sealed up the eyes, 'Gainst all that Art could possibly devise. 7 The Ingredients to the sleepie Potion.In which, she Plantan and cold Lettuce had, The Water-Lilly from the Marish ground, With the wan Poppie, and the Nightshade sad, And the short Mosse, that on the Trees is found, The poys'ning Henbane, and the Mandrake drad, With Cypresse flowers, that with the rest were pown'd; The braine of Cranes amongst the rest shee takes, Mix'd with the Bloud of Dormice, and of Snakes. 8 Thus, like Medea, sat shee in her Cell, Which shee had circled with her potent Charmes, From thence all hind'rance cleerely to expell; Then her with Magique Instruments she Armes, And to her Bus'nesse instantly she fell; A Fire lighted in an Angular Vessell, by the contraction of the Sunbeames.A Vestall Fire she lights, wherewith she warmes The mixed Juices, from those Simples wrung, To make the Med'cine wonderfully strong. 9 The sundry Feares that from her Fact might rise, Men may suppose, her trembling Hand might stay, Had shee consider'd of the Enterprise, To thinke what Perill in th'Attempt there lay; Knowing besides, that there were secret Spyes Set by her Foes, to watch her ev'ry way: “But when that Sex leave Vertue to esteeme, “Those greatly erre, which think them what they seeme. 10 A Character of meere Woman.Their plighted Faith they at their pleasure leave, Their Love is cold, but hot as fire their Hate, On whom they smile, they surely those deceive, In their Desires they be insatiate: Them of their Will there's nothing can bereave, Their Anger hath no bound, Revenge no date; They lay by Feare, when they at Ruine ayme, They shun not Sinne, as little weigh they Shame. 11 The elder of the Mortimers, this while That their sure Friends so many sundry wayes, By Fight, by Execution, by Exile, Had seene cut off; then finished his dayes; Which (though with griefe) doth somewhat reconcile The youngers Thoughts, and lends his Cares some ease; The elder of the Mortimers, dieth in the Tower. Which oft his Heart, oft troubled had his Head, For the deare safetie of his Unckle, dead. 12 But there was more did on his Death depend, Then Heaven was pleas'd the foolish World should know; And why the Fates thus hasted on his end, Thereby intending stranger Plagues to show. Brave Lord, in vaine thy breath thou didst not spend, From thy Corruption, greater Conflicts grow; Which began soone, and fruitfully to spring, New kinds of Vengeance on that Age to bring. 13 As Heart could wish, when ev'ry thing was fit, The Queene attends her Potions Power to prove; Their stedfast Friends their best assisting it, Their trustie Servants seale up all in love: And Mortimer, his Valor and his Wit Then must expresse, whom most it doth behove; Each place made sure, where Guides and Horses lay, And where the Ship, that was for his Convay. 14 When as his Birth-day he had yeerely kept, Mortimer, in the time of his Imprisonment, observed his Birth-day in the Tower. And us'd that day, those of the Tower to feed; And on the Warders, other Bounties heapt, For his Advantage, he that day decreed; Which did Suspition clearely intercept, And much avayl'd him at that time of need; When after Cates, their Thirst at last to quench, He mix'd their Liquor with that sleepie Drench. 15 Which soone each Sense doth with dead coldnesse seize; When he which knew the Keepers of each Ward, Out of their Pockets quickly tooke the Keyes, His coarded Ladders readily prepar'd; And stealing forth, through darke and secret wayes, (Not then to learne his Compas by the Card) To winne the Walls couragiously doth goe, Which look'd as scorning to be mast'red so. 16 They soundly sleepe, whilst his quicke Spirits awake, Expos'd to Perill in the high'st Extremes, Alcydes Labours as to undertake, O'er Walls, o'er Gates, through Watches, and through Streames, By which, his owne way he himselfe must make: And let them tell King Edward of their Dreames; For ere they came out of their Braine-sicke Trance, He made no doubt to be arriv'd in France. 17 The description of a gloomie Night, after the going downe of the Moone, being in her Prime; in two Stanza's.The sullen Night had her blacke Curtaine spred, Lowring that Day had tarried up so long, And that the Morrow might lye long a Bed, She all the Heav'n with duskie Clouds had hung; Cynthia pluck'd in her newly-horned Head, Away to West, and under Earth she flung, As she had long'd to certifie the Sunne, What, in his absence, in our World was done. 18 The lesser Lights, like Sentinels in Warre, Behind the Clouds stood privily to prie, As though unseene, they subt'ly strove from farre, Of his escape the manner to descrie; Hid was each Wand'ring, as each fixed Starre, As they had held a Councell in the Skie, And had concluded with that present Night, That not a Starre should once give any Light. 19 In a slow silence, all the Shoares are husht, Only the Shreech-owle sounded to th'Assault, And Isis with a troubled Murmure rusht, As if consenting, and would hide the Fault; Thames. And as his Foot the Sand or Gravell crusht, There was a little whisp'ring in the Vault, Mov'd by his treading, softly as he went, Which seem'd to say, it furth'red his intent. 20 Whilst that wise Queene, whom Care yet restlesse kept, The violent Passion of the Queene, whilest Mortimer was making his Escape, in six Stanza's. For happie Speed, to Heav'n held up her hands, With worlds of Hopes, and Feares together heapt In her full Bosome; list'ning as she stands, She sigh'd and pray'd, and sigh'd againe, and wept; She sees him how he Climbes, how Swims, how Lands, Though absent, present in Desires they bee, “Our Soule much farther then our Eyes can see. 21 The small Clouds issuing from his Lips, she sayth, Lab'ring so fast as he the Ladder clame, Should purge the Ayre of Pestilence and Death; And as from Heav'n, that filch'd Promethian flame, The sweetnesse so, and vertue of his Breath, New Creatures in the Element should frame; And to what Part it had the hap to stray, There should it make another Milkie Way. 22 Attayn'd the Top, whilst spent, he paws'd to blow, She saw, how Round he cast his longing Eyes, The Earth to greet him gently from below, How greatly he was favored of the Skyes; She saw him marke the Way he was to goe, And tow'rds her Palace how he turn'd his Eyes; From the Walls height, as when he downe did slide, She heard him crie, Now Fortune be my Guide. 23 As he descended, so did she descend, As she would hold him, that he should not fall, On whom alone her Safetie did depend: But when some Doubt did her deepe Thoughts appall, Distractedly she did her Hands extend For speedie Helpe, and earnestly did call Softly againe, if Death to him should hap, She beg'd of Heaven, his Grave might be her Lap. 24 To shew him favour, she intreats the Ayre, For him she beg'd the mercie of the Wind, For him she kneel'd before the Night with Prayer, For him, her selfe she to the Earth inclin'd, For him, his Tydes beseeching Thames to spare, And to command his Billowes to be kind; And tells the Floud, if he her Love would quit, No Floud of her should honor'd be, but it. 25 But when she thought she saw him swim along, Doubting the Streame was taken with his Love, She fear'd the Drops that on his Tresses hung, And that each Wave, which most should woo him, strove, To his cleare Bodie that so closely clung, Which when before him with his Brest he drove, Pallid with Griefe, she turn'd away her Face, Jealous, that he the Waters should imbrace. 26 That angry Lyon having slip'd his Chaine, As in a Fever, made King Edward quake; Who knew, before he could be caught againe, Deare was the Bloud, that his strong Thirst must slake; He found, much labour had beene spent in vaine, And must be forc'd a further Course to take, Perceiving Tempests rising in the Wind, Of which too late, too truly he divin'd. 27 By his Escape, that adverse Part growne prowd, On each hand working for a second Warre, And in their Councels nothing was allow'd, But what might be a Motive to some Jarre; And though their Plots were carried in a Clowd, From the discerning of the Popular, The Wiser yet, whose Judgements farther raught, Eas'ly perceive how things about were brought. 28 Those secret Fires, by envious Faction blowne, Brake out in France, which cover'd long had layne; King Charles from Edward challenging his owne, First Guyne, next Pontieu, and then Aquitayne, To each of which, he made his Title knowne, Nor from their Seisure longer would abstaine; The cause thereof, lay out of most Mens view, Which though fooles found not, wise Men quickly knew. 29 Their Projects hitting (many a day in hand) That to their Purpose prosp'rously had thriv'd, The Base whereon a mightie Frame must stand, By all their Cunnings that had beene contriv'd; Finding their Actions were so throughly man'd, Their fainting Hopes were wond'rously reviv'd, They made no doubt, to see in little time, The full of that, which then was in the prime. 30 The King much troubled with the French Affayre, Which as a shapelesse and unweldie Masse, Wholly imploy'd the utmost of his care, To Charles of France his Embassie to passe, For which, it much behov'd him to prepare, Before the Warre too deepely settled was; Which when they found, they likewise cast about, The great Policie of the Queenes Faction. As they would goe, to make him send them out. 31 Which, when they came in Councell to debate, And to the depth had seriously discust, Finding how neerely it concern'd the State, To stay a Warre, both dang'rous and unjust; That weightie Bus'nesse to negotiate, They must find One of speciall worth and trust; Where ev'ry Lord his Censure freely past, Of whom he lik'd, the Bishop was the last. 32 Adam Torlton, Bishop of Hereford, a Man of high eloquence. Torlton, whose Tongue Mens Eares in chaines could tye, And like Joves fearfull Thunderbolt could pierce, In which there more Authoritie did lye, Then in those words the Sibyls did rehearse, Whose Sentence was so absolute and hye, As had the power a Judgement to reverse, For the wise Queene, with all his might did stand, To lay that charge on her well-guiding hand. 33 Urging what credit she the Cause might bring, Impartiall, 'twixt a Husband, and a Brother, A Queene in Person, betwixt King and King; And more then that, to shew her selfe a Mother, There for her Sonne, his Right establishing, Which did as much concerne them as the other; Which Colour serv'd to worke in this Extreame, That, of which then, the King did never dreame. 34 Torlton, was this thy Spirituall Pretence? Would God thy Thoughts had beene Spirituall, Or lesse perswasive thy great Eloquence: But O, thy Actions were too Temporall, Thy Knowledge had too much Preheminence, Thy Reason subtill, and Sophisticall; “But all's not true, that Supposition sayth, “Nor have the Mightiest Arguments most Fayth. 35 Nor did the Bishop those his Learned lacke, As well of Power, as Policie and Wit, That were prepar'd his great Designe to backe, And could amend where ought he did omit: For with such Cunning they had made their Packe, A Metaphor taken from Card-play. That it went hard, if that they should not hit; That the faire Queene to France with speed must go, Hard had he ply'd, that had perswaded so. 36 When she, well fitted both of Wind and Tyde, And saw the Coast was ev'ry way so cleere, As a wise Woman she her Bus'nesse plyde, Whilst things went currant, and well carried were, Her selfe, and hers, to get aboord she hyde, As one, whose Fortune made her still to feare; Knowing those Times so variously inclin'd, And ev'ry Toy soone alt'ring Edwards Mind. 37 Her Followers such, as meerely Friendlesse stood, Sunke, and dejected by the Spensers Pride, Who bore the Taynts of Treason in their Blood, Such, whose Bloud and Lands were attainted, in those late Rebellions. And for Revenge, would leave no wayes untryde, Whose Meanes were bad, but yet their Minds were good, When now at hand they had their Helpe descryde; Nor were they wanting, Mischiefe to invent, To worke their Wills, and further her Intent. 38 Whilst Mortimer (that all this while hath layne, Returning from matters of State, to the fortunes of Mortimer, in his exile. From our faire Course) by Fortune strangely crost, In France was struggling how he might regayne, That which before in England he had lost, And all good Meanes doth gladly entertaine, No jot dismay'd, in all those Tempests tost, Nor his great Mind could so be overthrowne, All Men his Friends, all Countries were his owne. 39 Then Muse (transported by thy former zeale, Led in thy Progresse, where his Fortune lyes) To thy sure aid, I seriously appeale: To shew him fully, without fain'd Disguise, The ancient Heroes then I shall reveale, And in their Patterns I shall be precise, When in my Verse, transparent, neat, and cleare, They, shall in his pure Character appeare. 40 In the person of Mortimer, the patterne of an excellent Man; in two Stanza's.He was a Man (then boldly dare to say) In whose rich Soule the Vertues well did sute, In whom, so mix'd, the Elements all lay, That none to one could Sov'raigntie impute, As all did governe, yet all did obay; He of a temper was so absolute, As that it seem'd, when Nature him began, She meant to shew all, that might be in Man. 41 A Metaphor from TimberSo throughly season'd, and so rightly set, That in the Levell of the clearest Eye, Time never toucht him with deforming Fret, Nor had the power to warpe him but awry; Whom, in his Course, no Crosse could ever let, His Elevation fixed was so hye; That those rough Stormes, whose rage the World doth prove, Never raught him, who sat them farre above. 42 Which the Queene saw, who had a seeing Spirit, For she had mark'd the largenesse of his Mind, And with much Judgement look'd into his Merit, Above the usuall compasse of her kind, Looke to the 23. Stanza of the first Canto.His Grandsires Greatnesse rightly to inherit; When as the Ages in their Course inclin'd, And the World weake, with Time began to bow To that poore Basenesse that it rests at now. 43 He weighs not Wealth, nor yet his Wigmore left, Wigmore, in Herefordshire, the ancient Seat of the Mortimers. Let needlesse Heapes, as things of nothing stand; That was not his, that Man could take by Theft, He was a Lord, if he had Sea, or Land, The Noble Resolution of a brave Mind. And thought him rich, of those who was not reft; “Man, of all Creatures, hath an upright hand, “And by the Starres is only taught to know, “That as they progresse Heav'n, he Earth should doe. 44 Wherefore wise Nature, from this face of Ground, Into the Deepe taught Man to find the way, That in the Floods her Treasure might be found, To make him search, for what she there did lay; And that her Secrets he might throughly sound, She gave him Courage, as her only Kay, That of all Creatures, as the worthiest, hee Her glorie there and wond'rous works should see. 45 Let wretched Worldlings sweat for Mud and Earth, Whose groveling Bosomes licke the recreant Stones, Such Pesants carke for Plentie, and for Dearth, Fame never lookes upon those prostrate Drones; The brave Mind is allotted in the Birth, To manage Empires from the state of Thrones, Frighting coy Fortune, when she stern'st appeares, Which scorneth Sighes, and jeereth at our Teares. 46 But when Report (as with a trembling Wing) Tickled the entrance of his listning Eare, With newes of Ships, sent out the Queene to bring, For her at Sandwich which then wayting were; He surely thought he heard the Angels sing, The amorous Passion of Mortimer, hearing of the comming of the Queene. And the whole Frame of Heav'n make up the Quire, That his full Soule was smoth'red with excesse, Her ample Joyes unable to expresse. 47 Quoth he, slide Billowes smoothly for her sake, Fained by the Poets to be a God of the Sea.Whose sight can make your aged Nereus yong, For her faire Passage even Allyes make, And as the soft Winds waft her Sayles along, Sleeke ev'ry little Dimple of the Lake: Sweet Syrens, and be readie with your Song; Though 'tis not Venus that doth passe that way, Yet is as faire as she borne on the Sea. 48 Yee Scalie Creatures, gaze upon her Eye, And never after, with your kind make Warre; O steale the Accents, from her Lippes that flye, Which like the Tunes of the Celestials are, And them to your sicke amorous Thoughts apply, Fayned to make Fishes attend him, with the Musike of his Harpe.Compar'd with which, Arions did but jarre; Wrap them in ayre, and when blacke Tempests rage, Use them as Charmes, the rough Seas to asswage. 49 France, send t'attend her with full Sholes of Oares, With which her Fleet may ev'ry way be plyde; And when she landeth on thy blessed Shoares, And the vast Navie doth at Anchor ryde, For her departure, when the wild Sea roares, Ship mount to Heaven, and there be stellifyde; An Asterisme given to the Ship, that carried Jason to Colchos.Next Jasons Argo, on the burnish'd Throne, Assume thy selfe a Constellation. 50 Queene Isabel then landing with delight, Had what rich France could lend her for her ease; And as she pass'd, no Towne but did invite Her with some Shew, her Appetite to please: But Mortimer once comming in her sight, His shape and features did her Fancie seize; When she, that knew how her fit time to take, Thus she her most-lov'd Mortimer bespake: 51 O Mortimer, sweet Mortimer, quoth she, The Queenes speech to Mortimer, at their first Interview. What angry Power did first the meanes devise, To separate Queene Isabel, and thee, Whom (to despight) Love yet together tyes? But if thou thinkst the Fault was made by me, For a just Penance to my longing Eyes, Though guiltlesse they, this be to them assign'd, To gaze upon thee, till they leave me blind. 52 My deare, deare heart, thought I to see thee thus, When first in Court thou didst my Favor weare, When we have watch'd, lest any noted us, Whilst our Lookes us'd Loves Messages to beare, And we by signes sent many a secret Busse; An Exile then, thought I to see thee here? But what couldst thou be then, but now thou art? Though banish'd England, yet not from my heart. 53 That Fate which did thy Franchisement inforce, And from the depth of Danger set thee free, Still Regular, and constant in that Course, Made me this straight and even Path to thee, Of our Affections as it tooke remorse, Our Birth-fix'd Starres so luckily agree, Whose Revolution seriously directs Our like Proceedings, to the like effects. 54 Onely wise Counsell hath contriv'd this thing, For which we wish'd so many a wofull day, Of which, the cleare and perfect managing, Is that strong Prop, whereon our Hopes may stay; Which in it selfe th'Authoritie doth bring, That weake Opinion hath not Power to sway, Confuting those, whose sightlesse Judgements sit In the thicke Ranke, with ev'ry common Wit. 55 Then since th'assay our good successe assures, And we her Fav'rites leane on Fortunes Brest, That ev'ry houre new Comforts us procures, Of these her Blessings let us chuse the best, And whilst the day of our good Hap endures, Let's take the bounteous Benefits of Rest; Let's feare no Storme, before we feele a Showre, Of the Lands belonging to the Crowne of England, both in England and France.My Sonne a King, two Kingdomes helpe my Dowre. 56 Of wanton Edward when I first was woo'd, Why cam'st thou not into the Court of France? Before thy King, thou in my grace hadst stood: O Mortimer, how good had beene thy Chance! My Love attempted in that youthfull Mood, I might have beene thine owne Inheritance; Where entring now by Force, thou holdst by Might, A word borrowed from the Law.And art Disseisor of anothers Right. 57 Thou Idoll, Honour, which we Fooles adore, (How many Plagues doe rest in thee, to grieve us?) Which when we have, we find there is much more, Then that which onely is a Name, can give us; Of reall Comforts thou do'st leave us poore, And of those Joyes thou often do'st deprive us, That with our selves doth set us at debate, And makes us Beggers in our greatest state. 58 With such brave Raptures from her words that rise, She made a breach in his impressive Brest, And all his Pow'rs so fully did surprize, As seem'd to rocke his Senses to their rest, So that his Wit could not that thing devise, Of which he thought his Soule was not possest; Whose great abundance, like a swelling Flood After a Showre, ran through his ravish'd Blood. 59 Like as a Lute, that's touch'd with curious skill, A Simile of the mutuall Affections of Mortimer and the Queene. Each string stretch'd up, his right Tone to retayne, Musikes true Language that doth speake at will, The Base and Treble married by the Meane, Whose Sounds each Note with Harmonie doe fill, Whether it be in Descant, or on Playne; So their Affections, set in Keyes alike, In true Concent meet, as their Humors strike. 60 As the plaine Path to their Designe appeares, Of whose wish'd sight, they had been long debar'd, By the dissolving of those threat'ning Feares, That many a Purpose, many a Plot had mar'd; Their Hope at full, so heartily them cheares, And their Protection by a stronger Guard, Lends them that leysure, the events to cast Of things to come, by those alreadie past. 61 For this great Bus'nesse eas'ly setting out, The cleanly Carriage of the French Businesse, by the Queene and her Faction. By due proportion, measuring ev'ry pace, T'avoid the cumbrance of each hind'ring Doubt; And not to fayle of Comelinesse and Grace, They came with every Circumstance about, Observe the Person, as the Time, and Place; Nor leave they ought, that in Discretions Lawes, They could but thinke might beautifie the Cause. 62 Their Embassie deliv'ring in that height, As of the same, the Dignitie might fit, Apparelling a matter of that Weight, In Ceremonie, well beseeming it; And that it should goe steadily, and right, They at their Audience no one Point omit, As to the full each Tittle to effect, That in such Cases Wisdome should respect. 63 Nor to negotiate, never doe they cease, Till they againe that ancient League combine; Yet so, that Edward should his Right release, And to his Sonne the Provinces resigne: With whom, King Charles concludes the happy Peace, Having the homage due to him for Guyne; And that both Realmes should ratifie their Deed, They for both Kings an Enterview decreed. 64 Yet in this thing, which all Men thought so plaine, And to have been accomplish'd with such care, Their inward Falsehood hidden did remaine, Colours of State many times deceivable, and (in truth) meere juggling.Quite from the Colour that the Out-side bare: For onely they this Enterview did gaine, T'intrap the King, so trayned to their Snare; For which, they knew that he must passe the Seas, Or else the Prince, which better would them please. 65 Which by the Spensers was approved; who (As in his Councels they did chiefely guide) With him their Sov'raigne, nor to France durst goe, Nor in his absence, durst at home abide; Whilst the weake King stood doubtfull what to doe, His list'ning Eares they with Perswasions plyde, That he to stay, was absolutely wonne, And for that Bus'nesse, to dispatch his Sonne. 66 The Bishop of Hereford, so oft before mentioned.Thus is the King incompass'd by their skill, And made to act what Torlton did devise, Who thrust him on, to draw them up the Hill, That by his strength they might get Power to rise, For they in all things were before him still; That perfect Steers-man in all Policies, Had cast to walke, where Edward bare the Light, And by his Ayme, he levelled their Sight. 67 Thus having made, what Edward most did will For his Advantage, further their Intent, With seeming Good so varnishing their Ill, That it went currant by the faire Event, And of their Hopes the utmost to fulfill; Things in their course came in so true Concent, To bring their Bus'nesse to that happie end, That they the same might publiquely defend. 68 The precious Time no longer they protract, Nor in suspence their Friends at home doe hold, Being abroad so absolutely backt, They quickly waxed confident and bold, In their proceeding publishing their Act; Nor did they feare to whom Report it told, But with an armed and erected hand, To abet their owne, did absolutely stand. 69 And that base Bishop then of Excester, Walter Stapleton, then Bishop of Excester. A Man experienc'd in their Counsels long, (Thinking perhaps his Falsehood might preferre Him, or else moved with King Edwards Wrong; Or whether that his Frayletie made him erre, Or other fatall Accident among:) But he from France, and them, to England flew, And knowing all, discover'd all he knew. 70 Their Treasons long in hatching, thus disclos'd, And Torltons Drift by Circumstances found, With what Conveyance things had beene dispos'd, The Cunning us'd in casting of their ground, The Frame as fit in every Point compos'd, When better Counsell coldly came to sound, Awak'd the King, to see his weake estate, When the prevention came a day too late. 71 Yet her departing whilst she doth adjorne, Charles, as a Brother, by perswasion deales, Edward with Threats would force her to returne; Pope John, her with his dreadfull Curse assayles: But all in vaine against her Will they spurne, Perswasion, Threat, nor Curse with her prevayles; Charles, Edward, John, strive all to doe your worst, The Queene fares best, when she the most is curst. 72 Which to the Spensers speedily made seene, With what cleane sleight things had been brought about, And that those here, which well might rul'd have beene, Quickly had found, that they were gotten out, And knowing well their Wit, their Power, and Spleene, Of their owne Safeties much began to doubt, And therefore must some present Meanes invent, T'avoid a Danger, else most eminent. 73 When they, who had the Frenchmens Humors felt, And knew the Bayt wherewith they might be caught, By promise of large Pensions, with them dealt, If that King Charles might from her Aid be wrought: “What Mind so hard, that Money cannot melt? Which they to passe in little time had brought; That Isabel, too eas'ly over-way'd By their great Summes, was frustrate of her Aid. 74 The invincible Courage of Queene Isabel.Yet could not this amaze that mightie Queene, (Whom sad Affliction never had control'd, Never such Courage in that Sex was seene, She was not cast in other Womens Mold) Nor could rebate the edge of her high Spleene, Who could endure Warre, Travell, Want, and Cold, Struggling with Fortune, ne're by her opprest, Most chearefull still, when she was most distrest. 75 But then resolv'd to leave ingratefull France, And in the World her better Fate to trye, Changing the Ayre, hopes Time may alter Chance, Under her Burthen scorning so to lye, Her weak'ned state still striving to advance, Her mightie Mind flew in a Pitch so hye; Yet ere she went, her vex'd Heart that did ake, Somewhat to ease, thus to the King she spake: 76 Is this a Kings, a Brothers part (quoth shee?) The Speech of the Queene, to the King her Brother, at her departing out of France. And to this end, did I my Griefe unfold? Came I to heale my wounded Heart to thee, Where slaine out-right, I now the same behold? Be these thy Vowes, thy Promises to me? In all this Heat, art thou become so Cold? To leave me thus forsaken at the worst, My state at last, more wretched then at first. 77 Thy Wisdome weighing what my Wants require, To thy deare Mercie might my Teares have ty'd, Our Blouds receiving Heat both from one Fire; And we by Fortune as by Birth ally'd, Both vexed by the King of England. My Sute supported by my just Desire, Were Arguments not to have been deny'd; The grievous Wrongs that in my Bosome bee, Should be as neere thy Care, as I to thee. 78 Nature too eas'ly working on my Sex, Thus at thy pleasure my poore Fortune leaves, Which being intic'd with hopes of due respects From thee, my Trust dishonestly deceives, Who me and mine unnaturally neglects, And of all Comfort lastly us bereaves; What 'twixt thy Basenesse, and thy beastly Will, T'expose thy Sister to the worst of Ill. 79 Her Prophecie was fulfilled by Edward the third, her Sonne, in his Conquest thereof; whose Sonne, Edward, the Blacke Prince, tooke King John of France at the Battell at Poycters, who died a Prisoner in England.But for my Farwell, thus I prophecie, That from my Wombe hee's sprung, or he shall spring, Who shall subdue thy next Posteritie, And lead a Captive thy succeeding King, The just Revenge of thy vile Injurie; To fatall France, I as a Sibyl sing Her Cities Sacke, the slaughter of her Men, Of whom, one Englishman shall conquer ten. 80 The Earle of Henault a Man of great Power.The Earle of Henault, in that Season great, The wealthie Lord of many a Warlike Tower, Who, for his Friendship, Princes did intreat, As fearing both his Policie, and Power, Having a Brother wond'rously compleat, Cal'd John of Beamount (in a happie Houre, John of Henault, Lord Beamount.As it for the distressed Queene did chance) That time abiding in the Court of France. 81 He, there the while, this shuffling that had seene, Who to her partie Isabel had wonne, To passe for Henault, humbly prayes the Queene, Prompting her still, what good might there be done, To ease the anguish of her tumorous Spleene, Offring his faire Neece to the Prince her Sonne, The only way to winne his Brothers Might, Against the King to backe her in her Right. 82 Who had an Eare, not fil'd with his Report, To whom the Souldiers of that Time did throng, John of Henault, the most eminent Spirit of those Times.The Patterne to all other of his sort, Well learn'd in what to Honour did belong, With that brave Queene long trayned up in Court, And constantly confirmed in her Wrong; Besides all this, cross'd by the adverse Part, In things that sat too neere to his great Heart. 83 Sufficient Motives to invite Distresse, To apprehend so excellent a Meane, (Against those Ills that did so strongly presse) Whereon the Queene her weake estate might leane, And at that Season, though it were the lesse, Yet for a while it might her Want sustaine; Untill th'approching of more prosp'rous dayes, Her drouping Hopes to their first height might rayse. 84 When they at large had leysure to debate, Where Welcome look'd with a well-pleased face, From those Dis-honors she received late, For there she wanted no obsequious grace, Under the guidance of a gentler Fate, All bounteous Offers freely they imbrace; Prince Edward, after Edward the third, married Philip, the Earle of Henaults Daughter. And to conclude, all Ceremonies past, The Prince affyes faire Philip at the last. 85 All Covenants betwixt them surely seal'd, Each to the other lastingly to bind, Nothing but done with Equitie and Zeale, And suting well with Henaults mightie Mind, Which, to them all did much Content reveale; The Ease the Queene was like thereby to find, The Comfort comming to the lovely Bride, Prince Edward pleas'd, and Joy on every side. The end of the third Canto. The fourth Canto. The Argument. The Queene in Henault mightie Friends doth win, In Harwitch Haven safely is arriv'd, Garboyles in England more and more begin, King Edward of his Safetie is depriv'd, Flyeth to Wales, at Neath received in, Whilst many Plots against him are contriv'd; Lastly betray'd, the Spensers and his friends Are put to Death: with which, this Canto ends. 1 A Periphrasis of seven yeeres. Now seven times Phœbus had his welked Waine, Upon the top of Cancers Tropicke set, And seven times, in his descent againe, His fierie Wheeles had with the Fishes wet, In the Occurrents of King Edwards raigne, Since Mischiefe did these Miseries beget; Which through more strange Varieties had runne, Then he that while Celestiall Signes had done. 2 Whilst our ill-thriving in those Scottish Broyles, Their strength and courage greatly did advance, In a small time made wealthie by our Spoyles; And we, much weak'ned by our Warres in France, Were well-neere quite dis-heart'ned by our Foyles: But at these things the Muse must only glance, And Herckleys Treasons haste to bring to view, Her serious subject sooner to pursue. 3 When Robert Bruse, with his brave Scottish Band, Robert, King of Scots. By other In-rodes on the Borders made, Had well-neere wasted all Northumberland, Whose Townes he levell with the Earth had layd; And finding none his Power there to withstand, On the North part of spacious Yorkeshire prey'd, Bearing away with Pride his Pillage got, As Fate to him did our last Fall allot. 4 For which, that Herckley, by his Sov'raigne sent, T'intreat a needfull, though dis-honor'd Peace; Under the colour of a true intent, Kindled the Warre, in a faire way to cease, And with King Robert did a Course invent, His Homage due to Edward, to release: The Homage which the former Edward had, by his Conquest, imposed upon the Crowne of Scotland. Besides, their Faith they each to other plight, In Peace and Warre to joyne with all their Might. 5 Yet more, King Robert (things being carried so) His Sister to that trech'rous Earle affyde; Which made too playne and evident a show, Of what before his Trust did closely hyde: But the Cause found, from whence this League should grow, By such as (neere) into their Actions pryde, Discover'd Treasons, which not quickly crost, Had shed more Bloud, then all the Warres had cost. 6 Whether the Kings weake Councels causes are, That ev'ry thing so badly falleth out, Or that the Earle did of our state despayre, When nothing prosper'd, that was gone about, And therefore carelesse how the English fare; Ile not dispute, but leave it as a doubt: Or some vaine Title his Ambition lackt; But some thing hatch'd this Treasonable Act. 7 Which once revealed to the jealous King; Th'apprehension of that Trayt'rous Peere He left to the Lord Lucyes managing, The Lord Lucy a Man of high Valour.(One whose prov'd Faith he had held ever deare) By whose brave carriage in so hard a thing, He did well worthie of his Trust appeare; Herckley apprehended.Who, in his Castle, carelessly defended, That craftie Carlel closely apprehended. 8 For which, ere long, to his just Tryall led, In all the Robes befitting his Degree, Where Scroope, chiefe Justice in that dang'rous stead, Commission had, his lawfull Judge to be; And on the proofes of his Indictment read, His Treasons, all so easily might see; Which soone themselves so plainely did expresse, As might assure them of his ill successe. 9 The degrading of an Earle.His Style and Titles to the King restor'd, Noted with Names of Infamie, and Scorne, And next, disarmed of his Knightly Sword, On which (before) his Fealtie was sworne, Then, by a Varlet of his Spurres dis-spur'd, His Coat of Armes (before him) ras'd and torne; And to the Hurdle lastly he was sent, To a trayt'rous death, that trayt'rously had meant. 10 Whereon the King a Parlament procur'd, To fixe some things, whose Fall he else might feare; Whereby he hop'd, the Queene to have abjur'd, His Sonne, and such as their Adjutors were: But those, of whom himselfe he most assur'd, What they had seem'd, the same did not appeare; When he soone found, he had his Purpose mist, For there were those, that durst his Power resist. 11 For Hereford, in Parlament accus'd Adam Torlton, Bishop of Hereford, so oft before mentioned. Of sundry Treasons, wherein he was caught, By such his Courses strictly as perus'd, Whereby subversion of the Realme was sought, His holy Habit and his Trust abus'd, Who, to his Answer when he should be brought, Was by the Clergie (in the Kings despight) The powerfulnesse of the Clergie of those Times. Seiz'd, under colour of the Churches Right. 12 When some, the favorers of this fatall Warre, Whom this Example did more sharpely whet, Those for the Cause that then impris'ned were, Boldly attempt, at libertie to set; Whose Purpose frustrate, by their Enemies care, New Garboyles doth continually beget, Bidding the King, with care to looke about, Those secret Fires so howrely breaking out. 13 And th'Earle of Kent, who was by Edward plac'd As the great Gen'rall of his Force in Guyne, Was in his absence, here at home disgrac'd, And frustrated both of Supplyes and Coyne, By such lewd persons, to maintaine their Waste, As from his Treasures ceas'd not to purloyne; Nor could the King be mov'd, so carelesse still Both of his owne losse, and his Brothers ill. 14 Whose Discontent too quickly being found, By such as all Advantages did wait, Who still apply'd strong Cor'sives to the wound, And by their Tricks, and intricate Deceit, Hind'red those Meanes that hap'ly might redound, That fast arising Mischiefe to defeat; Til Edmunds wrongs were to that ripenesse growne, Edmund, Earle of Kent, the Kings Brother. That they had made him absolute their owne; 15 With all his faithfull Followers in those Warres, Men well experienc'd, and of worthiest parts, Who for their pay received only Scarres, Whilst the Inglorious had their due deserts; And Minions hate of other hope debarres, Which vex'd them deepely, to the very hearts, That to their Gen'rall for Revenge they cry, Edmund, Earle of Kent, joyneth with the Queene, and Henault.Joyning with Beamount, giving him supply. 16 These great Commanders, and with them combyne A Catalogue of the Captaines and Commaunders that came in with the Queene.The Lord Pocelles, Sares, and Boyseers, Dambretticourt, the young and valiant Hein, Estotivyle, Comines, and Villeers, The valiant Knights, Sir Michael de la Lyne, Sir Robert Baliol, Boswit, and Semeers; Men of great skill, whom Spoyle and Glory warmes, Such as (indeed) were dedicate to Armes. 17 Leading three thousand must'red Men, in pay, Of French, Scots, Alman, Swisser, and the Dutch; Of Native English, fled beyond the Sea, Whose number neere amounted to as much, Which long had look'd, nay, wayted for that day, Whom their Revenge did but too neerely touch; Besides, Friends readie to receive them in: And new Commotions ev'ry day begin. 18 Whilst the wise Queene, from England day by day, Of all those Doings that had certaine word, Whose Friends much blam'd her over-long delay, When as the time such fitnesse did afford; Doth for her Passage presently purvay, Bearing Provision ev'ry howre aboord, Ships of all Burthens rig'd and manned are, Fit for Invasion, to transport a Warre. 19 When she for England fairely setting forth, Spreading her proud Sayles on the Wat'rie Playne, Steereth her Course directly to the North, With her young Edward, Duke of Aquitaine, One of Prince Edwards Titles. With other three, of speciall name and worth, (The destin'd Scourges of King Edwards raigne) Her Souldier Beamount, and the Earle of Kent, With Mortimer, that mightie Malecontent. 20 For Harwitch Road, a fore-wind finely blowes, But blew too fast, to kindle such a fire, Whilst with full Sayle, and the stiffe Tyde, she goes; It should have turn'd, and forc'd her to retire, The Fleet it drove, was fraughted with our Woes: But Seas and Winds doe Edwards wracke conspire; “For when just Heaven, to chastise us is bent, “All things convert to our due punishment. 21 The Coasts were kept with a continuall Ward, The Beacons watch'd, her comming to descrie; Had but the love of Subjects been His Guard, 'T had been t'effect, that he did fortifie: But whilst he stood against his Foes prepar'd, He was betray'd by his home Enemie; Small helpe by this he was but like to win, Shutting Warre out, he lockt Destruction in. 22 When Henry, Brother to that lucklesse Prince, Henry findeth time to be revenged of his Brothers death. The first great Mover of that civill strife, Thomas, whom Law but lately did convince, That had at Pomfret left his wretched life; That Henry, in whose Bosome ever since Revenge lay covered, watching for reliefe, Like fire in some fat Myn'rall of the Earth, Finding a fit Vent, gives her Furie birth. 23 Henry, Earle of Lancaster, Lord high Marshall of England.And being Earle Marshall, great upon that Coast, With Bells and Bone-fires welcomes Her ashore; And by his Office gath'ring up an Hoast, Shew'd the great Spleene that he to Edward bore, Nor of the same, abash'd at all to boast; The Clergies Power in readinesse before, And on their Friends a Tax as freely layd, To rayse Munition, for their present Ayd. 24 And to Confusion all their Powers expose, On the rent Bosome of the Land, which long Warre, like the Sea, on each side did inclose, A Warre, from our owne home Dissentions sprong, In little time which to that greatnesse rose, As made us loath'd our neighb'ring States among: But this Invasion, that they hither brought, More Mischiefe farre then all the former wrought. 25 Besides, this Innovation in the State Lent their great Action such a violent Hand, When it so boldly durst insinuate On the cold faintnesse of th'infeebled Land; That being arm'd with all the power of Fate, Finding a way so openly to stand, To their intend'ment, might, if followed well, Regayne that Height, from whence they lately fell. 26 Their Strengths together in this meane time met, All Helpes, and Hurts, by Warres best Councels way'd, As what might further, what their Course might let, As their Reliefes conveniently they layd, As where they hop'd Securitie to get, Whereon, at worst, their Fortunes might be stay'd; So fully furnish'd, as themselves desir'd, Of what the Action needfully requir'd. 27 When at Saint Edmunds they a while repose, The Rendezvous of the Queenes Forces. To rest themselves, and their Sea-beaten Force, Better to learne the manner of their Foes, To th'end not idly to direct their Course, And seeing dayly how their Armie growes, To take a full view of their Foot and Horse; With much discretion managing the Warre, To let the World know what to doe, they dare. 28 When as the King of their Proceedings heard, And of the Routs that dayly to them runne; But little Strength at London then prepar'd, Where he had hop'd most favour to have wonne; He left the Citie to the watchfull guard Of his approv'd, most trusted Walter Stapleton, Bishop of Excester, mentioned in the 69. Stanza of the third Booke. Stapleton; To A younger Sonne of the Kings, so called, of his being borne there. John of Eltham, his deare Sonne, the Tower, And goes himselfe tow'rds Wales, to rayse him Power. 29 Yet whilst his Name doth any hope admit, He made proclaym'd, in paine of Goods and Life, Or who would have a Subjects benefit, Should bend themselves against his Sonne and Wife, And doth all Slaughters gen'rally acquit, Committed on the movers of this Strife; As who could bring in Mortimers proud Head, Should freely take th'Revenues of the dead. 30 Which was encountred by the Queenes Edict, Proclamation against Proclamation. By publishing the Justnesse of her Cause; That she proceeded in a Course so strict, T'uphold their ancient Liberties and Lawes: And that on Edward she did nought inflict, For private Hate, or Popular Applause; Only the Spensers to Account to bring, Whose wicked counsels had abus'd the King. 31 Which ballasted the Multitude, that stood As a Barke, beaten betwixt Wind and Tide, By Winds expos'd, opposed by the Flood, Nought therein left, to Land the same to guide; Thus floated they in their unconstant Mood, Till that the weakenesse of King Edwards side Suffred a Seisure of it selfe at last, Which to the Queene a free Advantage cast. 32 The King flyeth.Thus Edward left his England to his Foes, Whom Danger did to recreant Flight debase, As farre from Hope, as he was neere his Woes, Depriv'd of Princely Sov'raignetie and Grace, Yet still grew lesse, the farther that he goes, His Safetie soone suspecting ev'ry Place; No Helpe at Home, nor Succour seene Abroad, His Mind wants Rest, his Bodie safe Aboad. 33 One scarce to him his sad Discourse hath done, Of Henaults Power, and what the Queene intends; But whilst he speakes, another hath begun; A third then takes it, where the second ends, And tells what Rumors through the Countries run, Of those new Foes, of those revolted Friends; Straight came a fourth, in poste that thither sped, With newes of Foes come in, of Friends out-fled. 34 What Plagues did Edward for himselfe prepare? Forsaken King, O whither didst thou flye! Changing the Clyme, thou couldst not change thy Care, Thou fledst thy Foes, but followedst Miserie: Those evill Lucks, in numbers many are, That to thy Foot-steps doe themselves apply; And still thy Conscience, corrosiv'd with greefe, Thou but pursu'st thy selfe, both rob'd, and Theefe. 35 Who seeking Succour, offred next at hand, At last, for Wales he takes him to the Seas, And seeing Lundy, that so faire did stand, Thither would steere, to give his Sorrowes ease; A noted Island in the Severne Sea. That little Modell of his greater Land, As in a Dreame, his Fancie seem'd to please; For faine he would be King (yet) of an Ile, Although his Empire bounded in a Mile. 36 But when he thought to strike his prosp'rous Sayle, As under Lee, past danger of the Flood, A sudden Storme of mixed Sleet and Hayle, Not suffreth him to rule that piece of Wood: “What doth his Labor, what his Toyle avayle, “That is by the Celestiall Powers withstood? And all his Hopes him vainely doe delude, By God, and Men, incessantly pursu'd. 37 In that blacke Tempest, long turmoyl'd and tost, Quite from his Course, and well he knew not where, The King in his flight in great danger at Sea. 'Mongst Rocks and Sands, in danger to be lost, Not in more Perill, then he was in Feare; At length perceiving he was neere some Coast, And that the Weather somewhat 'gan to cleare, He found 'twas Wales; and by the Mountaines tall, That part thereof, which we Glamorgan call. 38 In Neath, a Castle next at hand, and strong, Where he commandeth Entrance, with his Crue, The Earle of Gloster, worker of much Wrong, Men of most note, that fled into Wales with the King. His Chancelor Baldock, which much Evill knew, Reding his Marshall, other Friends among; Where closely hid (though not from Envies view) The Muse a little leaveth them to dwell, And of great Slaughter shapes her selfe to tell. 39 Now, lighter Humor, leave me, and be gone, Your Passion poore, yeelds Matter much too slight: To write those Plagues that then were comming on, Doth aske a Pen of Ebon, and the Night; If there be Ghosts, their Murthers that bemoane, Let them approch me, and in pittious plight Howle, and about me with blacke Tapers stand, To lend a sad Light to my sadder Hand. 40 Each Line shall lead to some one weeping Woe, And ev'ry Cadence as a tort'red Cry, Till they force Teares in such excesse to flow, That they surround the Circle of each Eye: Then whilst these sad Calamities I show, All loose Affections, stand yee idly by, Destin'd againe to dip my Pen in gore, For the sad'st Tale that Time did e'er deplore. 41 New sorts of Plagues were threat'ned to the Earth, The raging Ocean past his Bounds did rise, Ominous Signes forerunning this second Bloudshed.Strange Apparitions, and prodigious Birth, Unheard of Sicknesse, and Calamities, More unaccustom'd and unlook'd for Dearth, New sorts of Meteors gazing from the Skies; As what before, had small or nothing bin, And only then their Plagues did but begin. 42 The miserable estate of the Kingdome, at the Queenes entrance.And whilst the Queene did in this Course proceed, The Land lay open to all offred Ill; The Lawlesse Exile did returne with speed, Not to defend his Countrey, but to kill; Then were the Prisons dissolutely freed, The insolencie of the Londoners, an ill example to other Cities.Both Field and Towne with Wretchednesse to fill: London, as thou wast Author of such shame, Even so wast thou most plagued with the same. 43 Whose giddie Commons, mercilesse and rude, Let loose to Mischiefe on that dismall Day, Their hands in bloud of Edwards Friends imbru'd; Which in their Madnesse having made away, Th'implacable, the monstrous Multitude, The Bishop of Excester, as hee was the first that fled from the Queene in France, so he was the first (of note) that tasted of her Vengeance, at her comming in. On his Lieutenant Stapleton did prey; Who drag'd by them o'er many a lothsome Heape, Beheaded was before the Crosse in Cheape. 44 Here first shee red, upon her ruin'd Wall, Her sad Destruction, which was but too nye, Upon her Gates was charact'red her Fall, In mangled Bodies, her Anatomie, Which for her Errors did that Reck'ning call, As might have wraught Teares from her ruthlesse Eye; And if the thicke Ayre dim'd her hatefull sight, Her Buildings were on fire, to give her light. 45 Her Chanels serv'd for Inke, her Paper, Stones, Whereon to write her Murther, Incest, Rape; And for her Penn's, a heape of dead Mens Bones, To make each Letter in some monstrous shape; And for her Accents, sad departing Grones: And that to Time no desp'rate Act should scape, If she with Pride againe should be o'ergone, To take that Booke, and sadly looke thereon. 46 The tender Gyrle, spoyl'd of her Virgin shame, Yet for that Sinne, no Ravisher was shent: Blacke is my Inke, more blacke was her Defame, None to revenge, scarce any to lament; Nought could be done, to remedie the same; It was too late those Mischiefes to prevent; Against those Horrors she did idly strive, But saw her selfe to be devour'd alive. 47 She wants redresse, and Ravishment remorse, None would be found, to whom she could complayne, And crying out against th'Adult'rers force, Her Plaints untimely did returne in vayne; The more she griev'd, her Miserie the worse, Onely to her this Helpe there did remayne, She spoyl'd of Fame, was prodigall of Breath, And made her Life cleere, by her resolute Death. 48 Then, of that World Men did the want complayne, When they might have been buried when they dyde, Young Children safely in their Cradles layne, The Man new marryed have enjoy'd his Bryde, When in some Bounds Ill could it selfe contayne; The Sonne kneel'd by his Fathers Death-bed side, The Living wrong'd, the Dead no right could have, The Father saw his Sonne to want a Grave. 49 But 'twas too late those Courses to recall, None have externall nor internall Feare, Those deadly Sounds, by their continuall Fall, Settle Confusion in each deaf'ned Eare; Of our ill Times, this was the worst of all, Onely of Garboyles that did love to heare, Armes our Attyre, and Wounds were all our Good, Branded the most with Rapine and with Blood. 50 Inglorious Age, of whom it should be sayd, That all these Mischiefes should abound in thee, That all these Sinnes should to thy charge be layd, From no calumnious nor vile Action free! O let not Time, us with those Ills upbrayd, Lest feare what hath been, argue what may be, And fashioning so a Habit in the Mind, Make us alone the Haters of our Kind! 51 O pow'rfull Heaven, in whose most Sov'raigne Raigne, All thy pure Bodies move in Harmonie, By thee, in an inviolable Chayne, Together link'd; so ty'd in unitie, That they therein continually remayne, Sway'd in one certaine Course eternally; Why, his true Motion keepeth ev'ry Starre, Yet what they governe, so irregular. 52 But in the Course of this unnaturall Warre, Muse, say from whence this height of Mischiefe grew, That in so short time spred it selfe so farre, From whence so sundry Bloudsheds did ensue, The Cause, I pray thee, faithfully declare: What, Men Religious, was the Fault in you? The immeasurable pride of the Clergie, the cause of much trouble in those Times. Which restie growne, with your much Power, withdraw Your stiff'ned Necks from th'yoke of Civill Awe. 53 No wonder though the People grew prophane, When Church-mens lives gave Lay-men leave to fall, And did their former Humblenesse disdaine; The Shirt of Hayre turn'd Coat of costly Pall, The holy Ephod made a Cloake for Gayne; What done with Cunning, was Canonicall, And blind Promotion shun'd that dang'rous Rode, Which the old Prophets diligently trode. 54 Hence 'twas, that God so slightly was ador'd, That Rocke remov'd, whereon our Faith was grounded, Conscience esteem'd but as an idle word, And being weake, by vaine Opinions wounded: Professors lives did little Fruit afford, And in her Sects, Religion lay confounded; Most sacred things were Merchandise become, None talk'd of Texts, but Prophecying dumbe. 55 The Church then rich, and with such Pride possest, Was like the poyson of infectious Ayre, That having found a way into the Brest, Is not prescrib'd, nor long time stayes it there, But through the Organs seizeth on the rest, The ranke Contagion spreading ev'ry where; So, from that Evill by the Church begun, The Common-wealth was lastly over-run. 56 When Craft crept in, to cancell wholesome Lawes, Which fast'ning once on the defective Weale, Where Doubts should cease, they rose in ev'ry Clause, And made them hurt, which first were made to heale; “One Evill still another forward drawes: “For when Disorder doth so farre prevayle, “That Conscience is cast off, as out of use, “Right is the Cloake of Wrong, and all Abuse. 57 Meane while, the King thus keeping in his Hold, (In that his poore imprisoned Libertie, Living a Death, in Hunger, Want, and Cold, Almost beyond imagin'd Miserie) By hatefull Treason secretly was sold, Through Keyes deliver'd to the Enemie; “For when th'oppress'd is once up to the Chin, “Quite over head, all helpe to thrust him in. 58 The dyre Disaster of that captiv'd King, So surely seiz'd on by the adverse part, (To his few Friends sad matter menacing) Strucke with pale Terror ev'ry willing heart, Their expectation cleane discouraging, Him no evasion left, whereby to start; And the blacke Cloud which greatliest did them feare, Rose, where their Hopes once brightest did appeare. 59 For first, their Envie with unusuall Force, Fell on the Spensers, from whose onely Hate The Warre first sprung; who found, their lawlesse Course Drew to an end, confined by their Fate; The miserable Fall of the Kings Friends. Of whom, there was not any tooke remorse: But as pernitious Cankers of the State, The Father first to Bristow being led, Was drawne to Death, then hang'd and quartered. 60 When as the Heire to Winchester then dead, The Lot, ere long, to his Sonne Gloster fell; Reding the Marshall, the like way was led, And after him, the Earle of Arundel, To pay the forfait of a reverend Head: Then Muchelden, and with him Daniel; These following him in his lascivious wayes, Then went before him, to his fatall dayes. 61 Like some large Pillar, of a Lordly height, On whose proud Top some huge Frame doth depend, By Time disabled to uphold the weight, And that with Age his backe begins to bend, Shrinkes to his first Seat, and in pittious plight, The lesser Props with his sad Load doth spend; So far'd it with King Edward, crushing all That had stood neere him, in his violent Fall. 62 The State whereon these Princes proudly leane, Whose high ascent, Men trembling still behold, From whence oft times, with insolent disdaine, The kneeling Subject heares himselfe control'd, Their earthly Weakenesse truly doth explane, Promoting whom they please, not whom they should; When as their Fall shewes how they foulely er'd, Procur'd by those, whom fondly they prefer'd. 63 For when that Men of Merit goe ungrac'd, And by her Fautors, Ignorance held in, And Parasites in good Mens Roomes are plac'd, Onely to sooth the Highest in their sinne, From those whose skill and knowledge is debas'd, There many strange Enormities begin; “For great Wits forged into factious Tooles, “Prove great Men (oft) to be the greatest Fooles. 64 But why, so vainely Time doe I bestow, The base abuse of this vile World to chide? Whose blinded Judgement ev'ry houre doth show, What Folly weake Mortalitie doth guide. A Philosopher, who alwayes laughed at Mens Vanitie.Wise was that Man which laugh'd at humane Woe; My Subject still more Sorrow doth provide, And these Designes more matter still doe breed, To hasten that which quickly must succeed. The end of the fourth Canto. The fifth Canto. The Argument. Th'imprisoned King his Scepter doth forsake, To quit himselfe of what he was accus'd; His Foes, him from the Earle of Lester take, Who their Commission faine would have refus'd; His Torturers a Mock'rie of him make; And basely and reprochfully abus'd, By secret wayes to Berckley he is led, And there in Prison lastly murthered. 1 The wretched King unnaturally betray'd, By too much trusting to his Edward, borne at Carnarvon in Wales. Native Land, From Neath in Wales to Kenelworth, a famous Castle in Warwickeshire. Kenelworth convay'd, By th'Earle of Henry, Earle of Leicester, of the bloud Royall, a Man of much Power and Trust. Lester, with a mightie Band; Some few his Favorers, quickly over-wayd: When straight there went a Parlament in hand, To ratifie the generall intent, For resignation of his Government. 2 Falne, through his Frayletie, and intemp'rate Will, That with his Fortune it so weakely far'd, To undergoe that unexpected Ill, For his deserved Punishment prepar'd; Past measure, as those Miseries to fill To him allotted, as his just reward; All arm'd with Malice, either lesse, or more, To strike at Him, who strucke at all before. 3 It being a thing the Commons still did crave, The Barons thereto resolutely bent, Such happie Helpes on ev'ry side to have, By the Barons, meant the whole Nobilitie.To forward that their forcible intent, So perfect speed to their great Action gave, Establish'd by the generall consent; On Edward that such Miseries did bring, As never were inflicted upon King. 4 Earles, Bishops, Barons, and the Abbots all, Each in due order, as became their state, By Heralds placed in the Castle Hall; The Burgesses for Places Corporate, (Whom the great Businesse at that time did call) For the Cinque Ports, the Barons convocate With the Shire Knights, for the whole Body sent, The two Divisions of England.Both for the South, and for the North of Trent. 5 When Edward, cloathed mournefully in blacke, Was forth before the great Assembly brought, A dolefull Hearse upon a dead Mans backe, Whose heavie Lookes express'd his heavie Thought, In which there did no part of Sorrow lacke, “True Griefe needs not fayn'd Action to be taught; His Funerall solemniz'd in his Cheere, His Eyes the Mourners, and his Legs the Beere. 6 Torlton destined to be the utter overthrow of the King. Torlton, as one select to that intent, The best experienc'd in that great Affayre, A Man grave, subtill, stout, and eloquent, First, with faire speech th'Assembly doth prepare; Then, with a grace, austere and eminent, Doth his Abuse effectually declare, Winning each sad Eye to a reverend Feare, To due Attention drawing every Eare. 7 Urging th'Exactions raysed by the King, The most especiall matters urged against the King. With whose full Plentie he his Mynions fed, Him and his Subjects still impoverishing; And the much Bloud he lavishly had shed, A desolation on the Land to bring: As under him, how ill all Bus'nesse sped; The losse in Warre, sustayned through his Blame, A lasting Scandall to the English Name. 8 Withall, proceeding with the future good, The chiefest Colour they had for their Proceedings. That they thereby did happily intend, And with what upright Policie it stood, No other Hopes their Fortunes to amend; The Resignation to his proper Blood, That might the Action lawfully defend; The present Want, that will'd it to be so, Whose Imposition they might not foreslow. 9 Much more he spake; but faine would I be short, To this intent a Speech delivering; Nor may I be too curious to report, What toucheth the deposing of a King: Wherefore I warne thee Muse, not to exhort The after-Times to this forbidden thing, By Reasons for it, by the Bishop layd, Or from my feeling what he might have sayd. 10 The grave deliverie of whose vehement Speech, Grac'd with a dauntlesse, uncontracted Brow, Th'Assembly with Severitie did teach, Each word of his Authentike to allow, That in the Bus'nesse there could be no breach, Each thereto bound by a peculiar Vow; Which they in publique gen'rally protest, Calling the King to consummate the rest. 11 The extreme Passion of the King, at the giving up his Crowne.Whose faire cheekes, cover'd with pale sheets of shame, Neere in a Swound, he his first Scene began, Wherein his Passions did such Postures frame, As ev'ry Sense playd the Tragedian, Truly to shew from whence his Sorrowes came, Farre from the compasse of a common Man; As Nature to herselfe had added Art, To teach Despayre to act a Kingly Part. 12 O Pitie! didst thou live, or wert thou not? (Mortals by such sights have to Stone beene turn'd) Or what Men have been, had their Seed forgot? Or that for One, another never mourn'd? In what, so strangely were yee over-shot, Against your selves, that your owne Frayletie spurn'd? Or had Teares then abandon'd Humane Eyes, That there was none to pitie Miseries? 13 His Passion calm'd, his Crowne he taketh to him, With a slight view, as though he thought not on it, As he were senselesse that it should forgoe him; And then he casts a scornefull Eye upon it, As he would leave it, yet would have it woo him: Then snatching at it, loth to have forgone it, He puts it from him; yet he would not so, He faine would keepe, what faine he would forgoe. 14 In this confused Conflict in his Mind, Teares drowning sighes, and sighes repelling Teares: But when in neyther, that he ease could find, And to his Wrong no Remedie appeares, Perceiving none to Pittie there inclin'd, Besides, the time to him prefixed, weares; As then his Sorrow somewhat 'gan to slake, From his full Bosome, thus he them bespake: 15 If first my Title stedfastly were planted King Edwards Speech at the Resignation of his Crowne, and Government: in the nine Stanza's following. Upon a true indubitate Succession, Confirm'd by Nations, as by Nature granted, Which lawfully deliver'd me Possession; You must thinke Heaven sufficiencie hath wanted, And so denie it Power; by your oppression, That into question dare thus boldly bring The awfull Right of an anoynted King. 16 That hallowed Unction, by a sacred Hand, Which once was powr'd upon this crowned Head, And of this Kingdome gave me the Command, When it, about me, the rich Verdure spred, Either my Right in greater stead should stand, Or wherefore then was it so vainely shed? Whose prophanation, and unrev'rend touch, Just Heaven hath often punish'd, alwayes much. 17 As from the Sunne, when from our Sov'raigne due, Whose vertuall influence, as the Sourse of Right, Lends safetie of your livelyhood to you, As from our Fulnesse taking borrow'd Light; Which to the Subject being ever true, Why thus oppugne you, by prepost'rous Might? But what Heaven lent me, wisely to have used, It gives to him, that vainely I abused. 18 Then here I doe resigne it to your King; Pawsing thereat, as though his Tongue offended, With griping Throwes seem'd forth that word to bring, Sighing a full Point, as he there had ended. O, how that sound his grieved Heart did wring! Which he recalling, gladly would have mended. “Things of small Moment we can scarcely hold, “But Griefes that touch the Heart, are hardly told. 19 Which sayd, his Eyes seem'd to dissolve to Teares, After some great Storme, like a show'r of Rayne, As his Tongue strove to keepe it from his Eares, Or he had spoke it with exceeding payne; O, in his Lips how vile that word appeares, Wishing it were within his Brest againe! Yet sayth he, Say so to the Man you beare it, And thus say to him, that you meane shall weare it. 20 “Let him account his Bondage from that day, “That he is with a Diadem invested; “(A glitt'ring Crowne hath made this Hayre so gray) “Within whose Circle he is but arrested, “To true Content, this is no certaine way, “With sweeter Cates the meane estate is feasted; “For when his proud Feet scorne to touch the Mold, “His Head's a Prisoner in a Gaole of Gold. 21 “In numbring Subjects, he but numbers Care; “And when with Shouts the People doe begin, “Let him suppose, th'Applause but Prayers are, “That he may scape the Danger he is in, “Wherein t'adventure, he so boldly dare; “The Multitude hath multitudes of Sinne, “And he that first doth cry, God save the King, “Is the first Man him evill Newes doth bring. 22 “Lost in his owne, mis-led in others Wayes, “Sooth'd with Deceits, and fed with Flatteries, “Himselfe displeasing, wicked Men to please, “Obey'd no more then he shall tyrannize, “The least in safetie, being most at ease, “With one Friend winning many Enemies; “And when he sitteth in his greatest State, “They that behold him most, beare him most hate. 23 A King was he but now, that now is none, Disarm'd of Power, and here dejected is; By whose deposing, he enjoyes a Throne, Who were he naturall, should not have done this: I must confesse, th'Inheritance his owne; But whilst I live, it should be none of his: But the Sonne climbes, and thrusts the Father downe, And thus the Crowned, goes without a Crowne. 24 Thus having play'd his hard constrayned Part, His Speech, his Reigne, the Day, together ended, His Brest shot through with Sorrowes deadlyest Dart, Car'd for of none, not look'd on, unattended, Sadly returning, with a heavie Heart, To his strait Lodging strictly recommended, Left to bemoane his miserable plight, To the deafe Walls, and to the darkesome Night. 25 Whilst Things were thus disast'rously decreed, Seditious Libels ev'ry day were spred, (By such as lik'd not of the violent Deed) That he by force should be delivered: Whether his Wrong, Remorse in some did breed, That him (alas) untimely pittied; Who knew: or, whether but devis'd by some, To cloake his Murther, afterward to come. 26 And Hate at hand, which heark'ning still did lurke, And still suspitious, Edward was not sure, Fearing, that Bloud with Leicester might worke, The Earle of Leicester neere to the King in Bloud. Or, that him Friends his Name might yet procure, Which the Queenes Faction mightily did irke; At Kenelworth, that no way could endure His longer stay; but cast to have him layd, Where his Friends least might hope to lend him Ayd. 27 A Castle in Glocestershire, upon the Banke of Severne, the ancient House of the Baron of that Name.Of which, when as they had debated long, Of Berckley Castle they themselves bethought, A place by nature that was wond'rous strong, And yet farre stronger eas'ly might be wrought; Besides, it stood their chiefest Friends among, And where he was unlikelyest to be sought; And for their Men, to worke what they desyr'd, They knew where Villaines were, that might be hyr'd. 28 For though the Great, to cover their Intent, Seeme not to know of any that are ill, Great Divels have the lesse at command.Yet want they not a Divellish Instrument, Which they have readie ever at their will; Such Men these had, to Mischiefe wholly bent, In Villanie, notorious for their skill, Dishonest, desp'rate, mercilesse, and rude, That dar'd into Damnation to intrude. 29 Vile Gurney and Matrevers were the Men, Of this blacke Scene, the Actors chose to be, Whose hatefull Deed pollutes my Maiden Pen: But, I beseech you, be not griev'd with me, Which have these Names now (that were famous then) No Name so Noble, but there is a Villaine of the same.Some Boughes grow crooked from the straightest Tree; Yee are no way partakers of their Shame, The Fault is in their Fact, not in their Name. 30 To Kenelworth they speedily dispatch'd, Fitted with each thing that they could desire, At such a time, as few their comming watch'd, When of their Bus'nesse none was to enquire: Well were the Men and their Commission match'd; For they had their Authoritie entire, To take the King, his Guardian to acquit, And to bestow him where they thought it fit. 31 This Crue of Ribalds, villanous and nought, With their Co-agents in this damned thing, To Noble Lester their Commission brought, Commanding the deliv'rie of the King, The Earle of Leicester much grieved, to leave his King and Kinsman to the mercie of his Enemies. Which (with much griefe) they lastly from him wrought; About the Castle closely hovering, Watching a time, till Silence, and the Night, Could with convenience priviledge their Flight. 32 With shamefull Scoffes, and barbarous Disgrace, The unmercifull and most base usage of the King, by those Villains, in his way from Kenelworth to Berckley. Him on a leane ill-favor'd Jade they set, In a vile Garment, beggerly, and base, Which, it should seeme, they purposely did get; So carrying him in a most wretched case, Benum'd, and beaten with the Cold and Wet, Depriv'd of all Repose, and naturall Rest, With Thirst and Hunger grievously opprest. 33 Yet still suspitious that he should be knowne, From Beard and Head they shav'd away the Hayre, Which was the last that he could call his owne: Never left Fortune any Wight so bare, Such Tyrannie on King was never showne, And till that time, with Mortals had beene rare; His Comfort then did utterly deceive him, But to his Death, his Sorrowes did not leave him. 34 For when they had him farre from all resort, They tooke him downe from his poore wearie Beast, And on a Mole-hill (for a State in Court) With Puddle Water him they lewdly drest, Then with his wofull Miseries made Sport; And for his Bason, fitting with the rest, A rustie Iron Skull: O wretched sight! Was ever Man so miserably dight? 35 His Teares increas'd the Water, with their fall, Like a Poole, rising with a sudden Rayne, Which wrestled with the Puddle, and withall, A troubled Circle made it to retayne; His endlesse Griefe which to his Mind did call, His Sighes made Billowes like a little Maine; Water and Teares contending, whether should The Mast'rie have, the hot ones, or the cold. 36 Vile Traytors, hold off your unhallowed Hands, His Brow, upon it, Majestie still beares; Dare yee thus keepe your Sov'raigne Lord in Bands? And can your Eyes behold th'Anoynted's Teares? Or if your Sight all Pittie thus withstands, Are not your Hearts yet pierced through your Eares? “The Mind is free, what ere afflict the Man, “A King's a King, doe Fortune what she can. 37 “Dare Man take that which God himselfe hath given? “Or Mortall spill the Spirit by him infus'd, “Whose pow'r is subject to the Pow'r of Heaven? “Wrongs passe not unreveng'd, although excus'd. The English Proverbe.Except that thou set all at six and seven, Rise Majestie, when thou art thus abus'd; Or for thy Refuge, which way wilt thou take, When in this sort thou do'st thy selfe forsake? 38 When in Despight, and Mock'rie of a Crowne, A Wreath of Grasse they for his Temples make: Which when he felt, then comming from a swowne, And that his Spirits a little gan to wake; Fortune (quoth he) thou do'st not alwayes frowne, I see thou giv'st, as well as thou do'st take, That wanting naturall covert for my Braine, For that defect, thou lend'st me this againe. 39 To whom, just Heaven, should I my Griefe complayne, Since it is onely Thou, that workest all? How can this Bodie naturall strength retayne, To suffer things so much unnaturall? My Cogitations labour but in vaine, 'Tis from thy Justice that I have my Fall, That when so many Miseries doe meet, The change of Sorrow makes my Torment sweet. 40 Thus they to Berckley brought the wretched King, Which, for their purpose, was the Place fore-thought. Yee Heavenly Pow'rs, doe yee behold this thing, And let this Deed of Horror to be wrought, That might the Nation into question bring! But O, your Wayes with Justice still are fraught! But he is hap'd into his Earthly Hell, From whence he bad the wicked World farwell. 41 They lodg'd him in a melancholy Roome, A description of the Kings Lodging, in Berckley Castle. Where, through strait Windows, the dull Light came farre, (In which, the Sunne did at no Season come) Which strength'ned were with many an Iron Barre, Like to a Vault under some mightie Tombe, Where Night and Day wag'd a continuall Warre; Under whose Floore, the common Sewer past Up to the same, a loathsome stench that cast. 42 The ominous Raven often he doth heare, Signes of evill Luck, and observed to foretell Death. Whose croking, him of following Horror tells, Begetting strange imaginarie Feare, With heavie Ecchoes, like to passing Bells; The howling Dogge a dolefull Part doth beare, As though they chym'd his last sad burying Knells; Under his Eave, the buzzing Shreech-Owle sings, Beating the Windowes with her fatall Wings. 43 His fearefull and most ominous Dreames, with the terrors of the Night: in this and the following Stanza.By Night affrighted, in his fearefull Dreames, Of raging Fiends and Goblins that he meets, Of falling downe from steepe Rocks into Streames, Of Deaths, of Buryals, and of Wynding Sheets, Of Wand'ring Helpelesse, in farre forraine Realmes, Of strong Temptations by seducing Sprights; Wherewith awak'd, and calling out for aid, His hollow Voyce doth make himself afraid. 44 Then came the Vision of his bloudie Raigne, Marching along with Lancasters sterne Ghost, Twentie eight Barons, either hang'd, or slaine, Attended with the rufull mangled Hoast, That unreveng'd did all that while remayne, At Burton Bridge, and fatall Borough lost; Threat'ning with Frownes, and quaking ev'ry Lim, As though that piece-meale they would torture him. 45 And if it chanc'd, that from the troubled Skyes, The least small Starre through any Chinke gave light, Straightwayes on heapes the thronging Clouds did rise, As though that Heaven were angry with the Night, That it should lend that comfort to his Eyes; Deformed Shaddowes glimpsing in his sight, As Darkenesse, that it might more ugly bee, Through the least Cranny would not let him see. 46 When all th'affliction that they could impose Upon him, to the utmost of their Hate, Above his Torments, yet his strength so rose, As though that Nature had conspir'd with Fate; When as his watchfull and too warie Foes, That ceas'd not still his Woes to aggravate, His further Helpes suspected, to prevent, To take away his Life, to Berckley sent. 47 And to that end a Letter fashioning, Edwardum occidere nolite: timere bonum est. Edwardum occidere, nolite timere: bonum est. Which in the words a double sense did beare; Which seem'd to bid them, not to kill the King, Shewing with all, how vile a thing it were; But by the Pointing, was another thing, And to dispatch him, bids them not to feare; Which taught to find, the Murth'rers need no more, Being thereto, too readie long before. 48 When Edward hap'd a Chronicle to find, Of those nine Kings, which did him here precede, Which some, there lodg'd, forgotten had behind, On which, to passe the How'rs, he fell to read, Thinking thereby to recreate his Mind; But in his Brest, That did sore Conflicts breed: “For when true Sorrow once the Fansie seizeth, “What ere we see, our Miserie increaseth. 49 And to that Norman, entring on this Ile, Cal'd William Conqueror, first his time he plyes, As Harold, the sonne of Earle Godwyn, had usurped the Crowne from young Edgar, called the Sonne of the Out-law; so Duke William tooke it from him by Conquest, having as little Right to it as he. The Fields of Hastings how he did defile With Saxon Bloud, and Harold did surprize, And those, which he so could not reconcile, How over them he long did tyrannize; Where he read, how the Strong o'ercame the Strong, As God oft-times makes Wrong to punish Wrong. 50 How Robert then, his eldest Sonne, abroad, Duke Robert, the eldest sonne of the Conqueror, was at his fathers death with Godfrey of Bulloyne, in the Holy Warres. New Forrest in Hampshire; in which he was slaine, with an Arrow out of a Crossebow, by Sir Walter Tirrell. Rufus, his second, seiz'd on his Estate, His Fathers steps apparantly that trode, Depressing those who had beene conquer'd late: But as on them he layd a heavie Load, So was he guerdon'd by impartiall Fate; For whilst Mens Roomes for Beasts he did intend, He in that Forrest had a beastly end. 51 Henry, for his learning named Beauclearke, the fourth and youngest sonne of the Conqueror. Henry, his young'st, his Brother William dead, Taketh the Crowne from his usurping Hand, Due to the eldest, good Duke Robert's Head, Not then returned from the Holy Land; Whose Power was there so much diminished, That he his Foe not able to withstand, Was ta'en in Battell, and his Eyes out-done; For which, the King Henries sonnes drowned, as they were comming by Sea out of France into England, to keepe the Feast of Christmas with their Father. Seas left Henry not a Sonne. 52 To Maud, Daughter to Henry the first, was first married to Henry the Emperour. Maud the Empresse he the Scepter leaves, His onely Daughter, whom (through false Pretext) Stephen Stephen, the sonne of Stephen, Earle of Blois, by Constance, William Conquerors Sister., Earle of Bulloyn, from the Kingdome heaves: The Conquerors Nephew, in Succession next, By which, the Land a stranger Warre receives, Wherewith it long was miserably vext; Till Stephen fayling, and his Issue gone, The Heire of Maud steps up into the Throne. 53 Henry, the sonne of Maud the Empresse, by her second Husband Geffrey Plantaginet, Earle of Anjou. Henry the second, Maud the Empresse Sonne, Of th'English Kings, Plantaginet the first, By Stephens end, a glorious Reigne begun; But yet his Greatnesse strangely was accurst, The Sonne being crowned by his Father in his life, sought after to depose his kind Parent.By his Sonne Henries Coronation: Which to his Age much Woe and Sorrow nurst; When His, whom he had labor'd to make Great, Abroad his Townes, at home usurp'd his Seat. 54 Richard, surnamed Cœur de Lyon. Richard, his Sonne, him worthily succeeds; Who not content with what was safely Ours, (A Man, whose Mind sought after glorious Deeds) Into the East transports the English Powers; In the Warres against the Saracens.Where, with his Sword whilst many a Pagan bleeds, Relentlesse Fate doth haste on his last Houres, Slaine by Peter Bazeel.By one, whose Syre he justly there had slaine, With a sharpe Arrow shot into the Braine. 55 Next followed him his faithlesse Brother John, Oft rebelling against his Brother Richard, who much loved him. Arthur, the sonne of Geffrey, the second sonne of Henry the second, who in the right of Constance, Daughter and Heire of Conan, Earle of Little Britaine in France, was Earle of the same. By Arthurs Murther (compass'd by his Might) His Brother Geffrey, th'Earle of Britaines Sonne; But he by Poyson was repay'd his Spight: For whilst he strove to have made all his owne, (For what he got by Wrong, he held his Right) And on the Clergie tyrannously fed, Was by a Monke of Swinsted poysoned. 56 Henry his Sonne, then crowned very young, Crowned at 9. yeres old. The Barons sent in for Lewes, the sonne of Philip, King of France, thinking to have made him King. For hate the English to the Father bare, The Sonne's here raigning was in question long, Who thought, on France t'have cast the Kingdomes care: With whom the Barons, insolent and strong, For the old About the Statutes made at Oxford. Which his He reigned 56. yeres, and a moneth. long Raigne did with much Care molest, Yet with much Peace went lastly to his Rest. 57 Of him descends a Prince, stout, just, and sage, Edward the first, named Long-shankes, a most fortunate and victorious Prince. The Happinesse of his Reigne, recovered the losse of the Warres that the Barons held against his father. He conquered Wales, and made Scotland do him Homage. (In all things happie, but in him, his Sonne) In whom, wise Nature did her selfe ingage, More then in Man, in Edward to have done; Whose happie Raigne recur'd the former Rage, By the large Bounds he to his Empire wonne: O God (quoth he) had he my Patterne bin, Heav'n had not powr'd these Plagues upon my sinne. 58 Turning the Leafe, he found as unawares, What day young Edward, Prince of Wales, was borne; Edward the second was the first Prince of Wales, called of Carnarvon, the place of his Birth. Which Letters look'd like conjuring Characters, Or to despight him, they were set in scorne, Blotting the Paper like disfiguring skarres: O, let that Name (quoth he) from Bookes be torne, Lest in that place the sad displeased Earth Doe loath it selfe, as slandered with my Birth. 59 Be thence hereafter Humane Birth exil'd, Sunke to a Lake, or swallow'd by the Sea; And future Ages asking for that Child, Say 'twas abortive, or 'twas stolne away: And lest, O Time, thou be therewith defil'd, In thy un-numbred Houres devoure that Day; Let all be done, that Pow'r can bring to passe, To make forgot, that such a one there was. 60 The troubled Teares then standing in his Eyes, Through which, he did upon the Letters looke, Made them to seeme like Roundlets, that arise By a Stone cast into a standing Brooke, Appearing to him in such various wise, And at one time such sundry fashions tooke, As like deluding Goblins did affright, And with their foule shapes terrifie his sight. 61 And on his Death-bed sits him downe at last, His fainting Spirits fore-shewing Danger nie, When the Doores forth a fearefull howling cast, To let those in, by whom he was to die: At whose approach, whilst there he lay agast, Those ruthlesse Villaines did upon him flie; Who seeing none, to whom to call for ayd, Thus to these cruell Regicydes he sayd: 62 The speech of the King to his Torturers, at the instant of his Death.O be not Authors of so vile an Act, My Bloud on your Posteritie to bring, Which after-Time with Horror shall distract, When Fame shall tell it, how you kil'd a King; And yet more, by the manner of the Fact, Mortalitie so much astonishing, That they shall count their Wickednesse scarce sinne, Compar'd to that, which done by you hath bin. 63 And since you deadly hate me, let me live; Yee this advantage angry Heaven hath left, Which, except Life, hath ta'en what it did give, But that Revenge should not from you be reft, Me yet with greater Miserie to grieve, Hath still reserv'd this from its former Theft; That this, which might of all these Plagues prevent me, Were I depriv'd it, lasteth to torment me. 64 Thus spake this wofull and distressed Lord, The miserable and most fearfull end of Edward the second, in this and the next Stanza following. As yet his Breath found Passage to and fro, With many a short Pant, many a broken word, Many a sore Groane, many a grievous Throw, Whilst him his Spirit could any strength afford To his last gaspe, to move them with his Woe; Till over-mast'red by their too much strength, His sickly Heart submitted at the length. 65 When 'twixt two Beds they clos'd his wearied Coarse, Basely uncovering his most secret Part, And without Humane Pittie, or Remorse, With a hot Spit they thrust him to the Heart. O that my Pen had in it but that force, T'expresse the Paine! but that surpasseth Art; And that, the Soule must even with trembling doe, For words want weight, nor can they reach thereto. 66 When those (i'th'depth and dead time of the Night) Poore simple People, that then dwelled neare, Whom that strange Noyse did wond'rously affright, That his last Shreeke did in his parting heare, As pittying that most miserable Wight, (Betwixt Compassion and obedient Feare) Turn'd up their Eyes, with Heavinesse opprest, Praying to Heaven, to give the Soule good Rest. 67 A Commination of the Place of the Kings Murther, to the end of the Canto. Berckley, whose Seat hath bin famous long, Let thy sad Ecchoes shreeke a deadly sound, To the vast Ayre complayne his grievous Wrong, And keepe the Bloud that issued from his Wound, The Teares that drop'd from his dead Eyes among, In their blacke foot-steps printed on the ground, Thereby that all the Ages that succeed, May call to mind the foulenesse of their Deed. 68 Let thy large Buildings still retayne his Grones, His sad Complaints by learning to repeat, And let the dull Walls, and the senselesse Stones, By the impression of his Torment sweat, And for not able to expresse his Mones, Therefore with Paine and Agonie repleat, That all may thither come, that shall be told it, As in a Mirror clearely to behold it. 69 And let the Genius of that wofull Place Become the Guide to his more frightfull Ghost, With Hayre dishevel'd, and a gastly Face, And haunt the Prison where his Life was lost, And as the Den of Horror, and Disgrace, Let it be fearefull over all the Coast; That those hereafter, that doe travell neare, Never may view it, but with heavie cheare. The end of the fifth Canto. The sixt Canto. The Argument. Lord Mortimer, made Earle of March; how he And the bright Queene rule all things by their Might; The State wherein at Nottingham they be, The Cost wherewith their pompous Courtis dight, Envy'd by those, their hatefull Pride that see: The King attempts the dreadfull Cave by Night; Entring the Castle, taketh him from thence, And March at London dyes for his Offence. 1 Now, whilst of sundry Accidents we sing, Some, of much Sadnesse, others, of Delight, In our Conceit, strange Objects fashioning; We our free Numbers tenderly invite, Somewhat to slacke this Melancholy String; For we too soone of Death come to endite, When things of Moment, in the course we hold, Fall in their order fitly to be told. 2 Whilst they, the Houres doe carefully redeeme, Their fraudfull Courses finely to contrive, How foule soe'r, to make them fayre to seeme, For which, they all did diligently strive, To tempt Men still, so of them to esteeme, That all might wish their Purposes to thrive; For it was Cunning, mixed with their Might, That had, and still must, make their Wrong seeme Right. 3 The Pompous Synod of those Earthly Gods, Was then assign'd to Salisburie, to bring Things to be even, that had been at ods, A Parlament of Salisburie.To the faire entrance of the new-crown'd King, And thereby so to settle their Abodes, That Peace from their first Parlament might spring; Wisely to end what well they had begun, For many thought, that strange things had been done. 4 Mortimer, created Earle of March, first of the Family, which had that Title.Whilst Mortimer (so Lord of his desire, That none prevayl'd, his Purpose to defeat) His stile of Baron, heav'd an Earledome higher, T'extend the Honour of his auncient Seat, That his Command might be the more entire; Who only then, but th'Earle of March, was great? Who knew, the Land into her Lap was throwne, Which having all, would never starve her owne. 5 The whole Frame of Heaven, moving betwixt the two Pole-Starres, North and South.And firme they stood, as those two stedfast Poles, 'Twixt which, this All doth on the Axtree move, Whose Strength the Frame of Government upholds, Which to those Times, their Wisdomes did approve: Strong must that Fate be, which their Will controules, Or had the Power, them from their Seats to shove; For well they found, that that which they could feele, Must of force make the Realme it selfe to reele. 6 When Edwards Nonage, that of Peace had need, The Scot incourag'd to renew the Warre, Of which, it much behoov'd them to take heed, Matters so strangely manag'd as they were, Which should they suffer (by neglect) to breed, Nothing they yet had made, but it might marre, Which for their good (reserving their Estate) They prove to purchase at the dearest rate. 7 Nor lesse then Ragman the rough Scot suffic'd, Of some called, the Ragman Role. Of all our Writings, of the most renowne, By which, the Kings of Scotland had dimis'd, The Instrument, by which the Fealtie was acknowledged. Their yeerely Homage to the English Crowne, With other Reliques (that were highly priz'd) But that which made the patient'st Men to frowne, Was the Blacke Crosse of Scotland, ominous deem'd, A Jewell of great price, anciently belonging to the Crowne of Scotland. Before all other, anciently esteem'd. 8 To colour which, and to confirme the Peace, Joan, the third Child of Edward the second, by Queene Isabel, married to Prince David, Heire Apparent to Robert Bruce, King of Scots. They made a Marriage betweene them and us, And for a strong Pretext to that Release, Which to the wisest seem'd most dangerous; Whilst Robert reign'd, and after his decease, That it might last, it was concluded thus, David their Prince, our Princesse Joan should take, Betwixt the Realmes a lasting League to make. 9 When th'Earle of Kent, that had been long of those, Edmund, Earle of Kent, Brother to the deposed King, mentioned in the former Canto's. Which in their Actions had a pow'rfull Hand, Perceiving them of Matters to dispose, Tending to the subversion of the Land, And further Danger dayly did disclose, If that the Kingdome they should still command; Whilst he their Fall did cunningly fore-cast, Did but his owne too violently haste. 10 For giving out, his Brother to survive, (Of all Men called the deceased King) Into the Peoples Heads such Doubts did drive, As into question Edwards Right did bring. Ill this Report was rays'd, and worse did thrive, Being so foule and dangerous a thing; That as a Mover of intestine Strife, The Earle of Kent put to death. He for the Treason forfeited his Life. 11 Whilst Edward takes but what they onely give, Whose Nonage crav'd their carefullest Protection, Who knew to rule, and he but learn'd to live, From their Experience taking his Direction: Hard was the thing, that they could not contrive, When he that reign'd, was crown'd by their Election; And that the Right which did to him belong, And must uphold him, chiefely made them strong. 12 False dealing had need of faire Colours.Providing for the Councell of the King Those of most Power, the Noblest of the Peeres, Experienc'd well, complete in ev'ry thing, Whose Judgements had been rip'ned with their Yeeres; With Comelinesse their Actions managing: Yet whilst they rowe, 'tis Mortimer that steeres; “Well might we thinke, the Man were more then blind, “That wanted Sea-roomth, and could rule the Wind. 13 Keeping their Course, that it still clearely shone, By the most curious Cunning to be scan'd, And made that which was Edwards then, their owne, Being received from his Sov'raigne Hand, Into their Bosomes absolutely throwne, Both for his good, and safetie of his Land, All their Proceedings coloured with that care, To the Worlds Eye so faire an Out-side bare. 14 And they which could the Complements of State, To Greatnesse gave each Ceremonious Rite, To their Designes to give the longer date, The like againe in others to excite; In entertaining Love, they welcom'd Hate, And to one Banquet freely both invite; “A Princes Wealth, by spending still doth spred, “Like to a Brooke, by many Fountaines fed. 15 To Being upon the North side of Trent; and for the ample Prospect it hath to the South, not unproperly called, The Eye of the North. Nottingham, the North's Imperious Eye, Which as a The Pharus is a Tower, placed upon some Promontorie, or loftie Ground, with light in the top, to direct Men at Sea; to which, hee likeneth Nottingham, for the stately situation. Pharus doth survey the Soyle, Armed by Nature, Danger to defie; March to repose him, after all his Toyle, (Where Treason least Advantage might espie) Closely convey'd his past-price valued Spoyle; That there residing from the publique sight, He might with pleasure rellish his Delight. 16 Ninescore in Check belonging to their Court, By honor'd Knight-hood knit in mutuall Bands, Men most select, of speciall worth and sort; The great Retinue of the Queene and Mortimer. Much might they doe, that had so many Hands: March and the Queene maintaine one equall Port In that proud Castle, which so farre commands; From whence they seem'd, as they like those would rise, Who once threw Rocks at the Imperiall Skies. 17 As Fortune meant, her Power on March to show, And in her Armes to beare him through the Skye, By him to daunt whos'ever sat below, Having above them mounted him so hye: Who, at his beck was he that did not bow, If at his feet he did not humbly lye? “All things concurre with more then happy Chance, “To rayse the Man, whom Fortune will advance. 18 Here all along, the Flower-befilled Vales, A Poeticall description of Trent, as it runneth thorow the Medowes, under Nottingham. On her cleere Sands the Silver Trent doth slide, And to the Medowes telling wanton Tales, Her Crystall Limbes lasciviously, in pride, (As ravished with the inamor'd Gales) With often Turnings casts from side to side; As she were loth the faire sight to forsake, Running into Humber, and so into the German Ocean. And runne her selfe into the German Lake. 19 Nottingham seated upon a high Rocke, betweene the goodly Forrest of Sherwood and the Trent.And North from thence, rude Sherwood as she roves, Casts many a long Looke at those loftie Tow'rs, And with the thicknesse of her well-growne Groves, Shelters the Towne from stormie Winters Show'rs, In pleasant Summer, and to shew her loves, Bids it againe to see her shadie Bow'rs; Courting the Castle, which as turning to her, Smiles to behold th'inamor'd Wood-Nymph woo her. 20 March and the Queene so planted in that place, Thither, in Person, Princely Edward drawes, Who seem'd, their Friendships friendly to imbrace, And upon ev'ry little offred cause, Readie to doe them ceremonious Grace; Whom they observe (of Court that knew the Lawes:) Whilst in the Towne King Edward tooke his Seat, The Queenes great confluence made the Castle sweat. 21 The excessive pride of the Queene, and her Favourite Mortimer.Where, when they pleas'd in Councell to debate, Or they the King at any Pleasure met, They came with such Magnificence of State, As did all Eyes upon their Greatnesse set, Prizing their Presence at that costly rate, As to the same due Rev'rence might beget; Which, in most People Admiration wrought, And much amazed many a wand'ring Thought. 22 O, could Ambition apprehend a Stay, The giddie Course it wand'reth in, to guide! And give it Safetie in that slipp'rie Way, Where the most worldly provident doe slide; It not so soone should see it owne Decay: But it so much besotted is with Pride, That it ne'r thinketh of that Pit at all, Wherein, through Boldnesse, it doth blindly fall. 23 But never doth it surfet with Excesse, The true nature of Ambition. Each Dish so savorie, season'd with Delight, Nor nothing can the Gluttonie suppresse, But still it longs, so liquorish is the sight, Nor having all, is in desire the lesse, Till it so much be tempted, past the Might, That the full stomacke more then well suffic'd, Vomits, what late it vilely gourmandiz'd. 24 Like to some low Brooke, from a loftier ground, A Simile of the end of Ambition. By waste of Waters that is over-flow'd, Is sated, till it shouldreth downe the Mound, And the old course quite of it selfe unload, That where it was, it after is not found, But from the strait Bankes layes it selfe abroad, Leading the Fountaine that doth feed it, by, So leaves the Channell desolate and drie. 25 When as those few, that many Teares had spent, By gazing long on murth'red Edwards Grave, Mutt'red in corners, griev'd, and discontent; And finding those, them willing Eare that gave, Still, as they durst, discovered what they meant, Tending their Pride and Greatnesse to deprave; Urging withall, what some might justly doe, If things so borne, were rightly look'd into. 26 And some gave out, that Mortimer, to rise, Had cut off Kent, that next was to succeed, Whose Treasons they avow'd, March to surmise, As a meere Colour to that lawlesse deed; Which his Ambition onely did devise, Quite out the Royall Family to weed, And made account, if Edward once were gone, He, o'r the rest, might step into the Throne. 27 As those his Favorers, in those former Times, Then credulous, that Honour was his end, And for the hate they bare to others Crimes, His greatest Favourers wearie of his ambitious Courses.Did not his Faults so carefully attend; Perceiving he so dissolutely clymes, Having then brought his purpose to an end, With a severe Eye did more strictly looke Into the course which his Ambition tooke. 28 A Simile of Mortimers over-greatnesse.All fence the Tree, that serveth for a shade, Whose big-growne Bodie doth beare off the Wind, Till that his wastfull Branches doe invade The new-sprung Plants, and them in Prison bind; When as a Tyrant to his weaker made, And as a vile devourer of his kind, All lend their Hands, at his large Root to hew, Whose Greatnesse hind'reth others that would grow. 29 So, at his ease securely whilst he sate, And as he would, so all things settled were, Under the guidance of a gracious Fate, Never more free from Jealousie and Feare; So great his Mind, so mightie his Estate, As they admit not Danger to be neere; But still we see, before a sudden Showre, The Sunne upon us hath the greatest power. 30 A description of Mortimers Chamber, and the state thereof: in foureteene Stanza's.Within the Castle had the Queene devis'd, (Long about which, she busied had her Thought) A Chamber, wherein she imparadiz'd What shapes for her could any where be sought; Which in the same were curiously compriz'd, By skilfull Painters excellently wrought: And in the place of greatest Safetie there, Mortimers Tower.Which she had nam'd the Tower of Mortimer. 31 A Roome prepar'd with Pilasters, she chose, Little Pillars, as we see in many Buildings of State, which be about greater. That to the Roofe their slender Poynts did reare, Arching the Top, whereas they all did close, Which from below shew'd like an Hemisphere; In whose Concavitie, she did compose The Constellations, that to us appeare, In their corporeall shapes, with Starres inchased, As by th'old Poets they on Heaven were placed. 32 About which Lodging, tow'rds the upper Face, By Architects called the Cornish. Ran a fine Border, circularly led, As equall 'twixt the Zenith and the Base, A word borrowed from Astronomie, to expresse the highest Point. Which as a Zone the Waste ingirdled, That lent the Sight a breathing, by the space 'Twixt things neere hand, and those farre over head; Upon the plaine Wall of which lower Part, Painting express'd the utmost of her Art. 33 There Phœbus clipping Hiacynthus, stood, Phœbus loving a daintie Boy, called Hiacynthus, by chance slew him with a Sledge which he threw; who, after his death, he metamorphosed into a flower of that name; the manner of which, is expressed in the supposed Painting. Whose Lifes last drops did the Gods Brest imbrew, His Teares so mixed with the young Boyes Blood, That whether was the more, no Eye could view; And though together lost as in a Flood, Yet here and there th'one from th'other drew; The prettie Wood-Nymphes chafing him with Balme, Proving to wake him from his deadly qualme. 34 Apollo's Quiver, and farre-killing Bow, Phœbus and Apollo both one. His Gold-frindg'd Mantle on the Grasse-full Ground, T'expresse whose Act, Art (ev'n) her best did show, The Sledge so shadow'd still, as to rebound, As it had scarce done giving of the Blow, Lending a lasting freshnesse to the Wound; The purple flower from the Boyes Bloud begun, That since ne'r spreads, but to the rising Sunne. 35 Iö the Daughter of Inachus, kept by Jupiter, who, to hide her from Juno, transformd her into a Cow.Neere that, was Iö, in a Heyfers shape, Viewing her new-ta'n Figure in a Brooke, In which, her shadow seem'd on her to gape, As on the same she greedily did looke, To see how Jove could cloud his wanton scape: So done, that the Beholders oft mistooke Themselves; to some, that one way did allow A Womans likenesse, th'other way, a Cow. 36 Mercurie fayned oft to court Hebe, a Nymph, who served the Cup to Jupiter.There Mercurie was like a Shepheards Boy, Sporting with Hebe, by a Fountaine brim, With many a sweet Glance, many an am'rous Toy; He sprinkling Drops at her, and she at him: Wherein the Painter so explain'd their Joy, As he had meant the very Life to limne; For on their Browes he made the Drops so cleare, That through each Drop, their faire Skins did appeare. 37 A high Mountayne in the Ile of Delos, where Apollo and Diana were borne, described in this and the following Stanza.By them, in Landskip, Rockie Cynthus rear'd, With the Clouds leaning on his loftie Crowne, On his sides shewing many a straggling Heard, And from his Top, the cleare Springs creeping downe By the old Rocks, each with a hoarie Beard, With Mosse and climbing Ivie over-growne; Skill meant here for excellency.So done, that the Beholders, with the Skill, Never ynough their longing Eyes could fill. 38 The halfe-nak'd Nymphs, some climbing, some descending, The sundry Flowers at one another flung, In Postures strange, their limber Bodies bending; Some cropping Branches, that seem'd lately sprung, Upon the Brakes, their coloured Mantles rending, Which on the Mount grew here and there among; Combing their Hayre some, some made Garlands by; So strove the Painter to content the Eye. 39 In one part, Phaeton cast amongst the Clouds Phaeton fayned to obtayne of Phœbus, his father, for one day to guide the Chariot of the Sunne, by which, he fired the World. By Phœbus Palfreyes, that their Reynes had broke, His Chariot tumbling from the welked Shrowds, And the fierce Steeds flew madding from their yoke, The Elements confusedly in Crowds, And Heaven and Earth were nought but flame &amp; smoke: A Piece so done, that many did desire To warme themselves, some frighted with the Fire. 40 And into Padus falling, as he burn'd, Jove fearing to have his Throne burnt by Phaeton, threw him into the River Padus. Thereinto throwne by Jove, out of the Skyes; His weeping Sisters, there to Trees were turn'd, Yet so of Women did retayne the guise, Phaethusa, Lampetia and Lampethusa, the sisters of Phaeton, called Heliades, which dying with the sorrow for their Brother, were turned into Trees. That none could censure, whether (as they mourn'd) Drops from their Boughes, or Teares fell from their Eyes: Done for the last, with such exceeding Life, As Art therein with Nature seem'd at strife. 41 And for the Light to this brave Lodging lent, The Workeman, who as wisely could direct, Did for the same the Windowes so invent, A steady and pure Light giveth much grace to Painting. That they should artificially reflect The Day alike on ev'ry Liniament, To their Proportion, and had such respect, As that the Beames, condensated and grave, To ev'ry Figure a sure Colour gave. 42 In part of which, under a golden Vine, A description of the Bed. Which held a curious Canopie through all, Stood a rich Bed, quite cover'd with the Twyne, Shadowing the same, in the redoubling fall, Whose Clusters drew the Branches to decline, 'Mongst which, did many a naked Cupid sprawle: Some, at the sundry-colour'd Birds did shoot, And some, about to plucke the Purple Fruit. 43 On which, a Tissue counterpoyne was cast, Arachnes Web did not the same surpasse, Wherein the storie of his Fortunes past, A Woman that first invented Spinning.In lively Pictures, neatly handled was; How he escap'd the Tower, in France how grac'd, With Stones imbroyd'red, of a wond'rous Masse; About the Border, in a fine-wrought Fret, Emblem's, Empressa's, Hieroglyphicks, set. 44 This flatt'ring Sunne-shine had begot the Showre, And the blacke Clouds with such abundance fed, That for a Wind they wayted but the Howre, Revenge long kept off, when it getteth oportunitie, falls like a Tempest.With force to let their Furie on his Head: Which when it came, it came with such a Pow'r, As he could hardly have imagined; “But when Men thinke they most in Safetie stand, “Their greatest Perill often is at hand. 45 For to that Largenesse they increased were, That Edward felt March heavie on his Throne, Whose Props no longer both of them could beare, Two, for one Seat, that over-great were growne, Prepost'rously that moved in one Sphere, And to the like predominancie prone, That the young King, downe Mortimer must cast, If he himselfe would e'r hope to sit fast. 46 Good Considerations of the King, in the apprehension of Mortimer.Who finding the necessitie was such, That urg'd him still th'Assault to undertake, And yet his Person it might neerely touch, Should he too soone his sleeping Power awake: Th'Attempt wherein the Danger was so much, Drove him at length a secret Meanes to make, Whereby he might the Enterprise effect, And hurt him most, where he did least suspect. 47 Without the Castle, in the Earth, is found The description of the Cave at Nottingham. A Cave, resembling sleepie Fayned to be the God of Dreames. Morpheus Cell, In strange Often Turnings. Meanders wynding under Ground, Where Darkenesse seekes continually to dwell, Which with such Feare and Horror doth abound, As though it were an entrance into Hell; By Architects to serve the Castle, made When as the Danes this Iland did invade. 48 Now, on along the crankling Path doth keepe, Then, by a Rocke turnes up another way, Rising tow'rds Day, then falling tow'rds the Deepe, On a smooth Levell then it selfe doth lay, Directly then, then obliquely doth creepe, Nor in the Course keepes any certaine stay; Till in the Castle, in an odde by-place, It casts the foule Maske from its duskie Face. 49 By which, the King with a selected Crue, Of such as he with his Intent acquainted, Which he affected to the Action knew, And in revenge of Edward had not fainted, That to their utmost would the Cause pursue, And with those Treasons that had not been tainted; Adventured, the Labyrinth t'assay, Properly so called, because of the sinuositie and wynding of the same. To rowse the Beast, which kept them all at bay. 50 Long after Phœbus tooke his lab'ring Teame, A Periphrasis of a darke Night, at the Prime of the Moone. To his pale Sister and resign'd his Place, To wash his Cauples in the Ocean Streame, And coole the fervor of his glowing Face; And Phœbe, scanted of her Brothers Beame, The Moone. Into the West went after him apace, Leaving blacke Darkenesse to possesse the Skie, To fit the time of that blacke Tragedie. 51 A description of their passing through the Cave: in foure Stanza's.What time, by Torch-light, they attempt the Cave, Which at their entrance seemed in a fright, With the reflection that their Armour gave, As it till then had ne'r seene any Light; Which, striving there pre-eminence to have, Darknesse therewith so daringly doth fight, That each confounding other, both appeare, As Darknesse Light, and Light but Darkenesse were. 52 The craggie Cleeves, which crosse them as they goe, Made, as their Passage they would have denyde, And threat'ned them their Journey to forslow, As angry with the Path that was their Guide, And sadly seem'd their Discontent to show, To the vile Hand that did them first divide; Whose comb'rous Falls and Risings seem'd to say, So ill an Action could not brooke the Day. 53 And by the Lights as they along were led, Their shadowes then them following at their backe, Were like to Mourners, carrying forth their dead, And as the Deed, so were they ugly blacke, Or like to Fiends that them had followed, Pricking them on to Bloudshed, and to Wracke; Whilst the Light look'd as it had been amazed, At their deformed shapes whereon it gazed. 54 The clatt'ring Armes their Masters seem'd to chide, As they would reason, wherefore they should wound, And strooke the Cave, in passing on each side, As they were angry with the hollow Ground, That it an Act so pittilesse should hide; Whose stonie Roofe lock'd in their angrie Sound, And hanging in the Creekes, drew backe againe, As willing them from Murther to refraine. 55 The Night wax'd old (not dreaming of these things) And to her Chamber is the Queene withdrawne, To whom a choise Musician playes and sings, Whilst she sat under an Estate of Lawne, A description of the Queene, in her chamber: in eight Stanza's In Night-Attyre, more God-like glittering, Then any Eye had seene the chearefull Dawne, Leaning upon her most-lov'd Mortimer, Whose Voice, more then the Musike, pleas'd her Eare. 56 Where her faire Brests at libertie were let, Whose Violet Veines in branched Riverets flow, And Venus Swans, and milkie Doves were set Upon those swelling Mounts of driven Snow; Whereon whilst Love, to sport himselfe doth get, He lost his Way, nor backe againe could goe, But with those Bankes of Beautie set about, He wand'red still, yet never could get out. 57 Her loose Hayre look'd like Gold (O word too base! Nay, more then sinne, but so to name her Hayre) Declining, as to kisse her fayrer Face, No word is fayre ynough for thing so fayre, Nor never was there Epithite could grace That, by much praysing, which we much impayre; And where the Pen fayles, Pensils cannot show it, Only the Soule may be suppos'd to know it. 58 She layd her fingers on his Manly Cheeke, The Gods pure Scepters, and the Darts of Love, That with their Touch might make a Tygre meeke, Or might great Atlas from his Seat remove; A Mountaine, for his height, fayned to upbold the Firmament. So white, so soft, so delicate, so sleeke, As she had worne a Lilly for a Glove, As might beget Life, where was never none, And put a Spirit into the hardest Stone. 59 The Fire, of precious Wood; the Light, Perfume, Which left a sweetnesse on each thing it shone, As ev'ry thing did to it selfe assume The Sent from them, and made the same their owne: So that, the painted Flowres within the Roome Were sweet, as if they naturally had growne; The Light gave Colours, which upon them fell, And to the Colours the Perfume gave smell. 60 The amorous Passages betweene the Queene and Mortimer, the Evening before his apprehension: in three Stanza's.When on those sundry Pictures they devise, And from one Peece they to another runne, Commend that Face, that Arme, that Hand, those Eyes, Shew how that Bird, how well that Flowre was done, How this part shadow'd, and how that did rise, This Top was clouded, how that Trayle was spunne, The Land-skip, Mixture, and Delineatings, And in that Art, a thousand curious Things. 61 Looking upon proud Phaeton, wrap'd in Fire, The gentle Queene did much bewayle his Fall; But Mortimer commended his Desire, To lose one poore Life, or to governe all: What though (quoth he) he madly did aspire, And his great Mind made him proud Fortunes Thrall? Yet in despight, when she her worst had done, He perish'd in the Chariot of the Sunne. 62 Phœbus she said was over-forc'd by Art, Nor could she find, how that Imbrace could be: But Mortimer then tooke the Painters part; Why thus, bright Empresse, thus, and thus, quoth he; That Hand doth hold his Backe, and this his Heart, Thus their Armes twyne, and thus their Lippes, you see; Now are you Phœbus, Hiacynthus I, It were a Life thus ev'ry Houre to die. 63 When, by that time, into the Castle Hall Was rudely entred that well-armed Rout, And they within suspecting nought at all, Had then no Guard, to watch for them without: “(See how Mischances suddenly doe fall, “And steale upon us, being farth'st from doubt;) “Our Life's uncertaine, and our Death is sure, “And tow'rds most Perill, Man is most secure. 64 Whilst youthfull Nevil, and brave Turrington, To the bright Queene that ever wayted neere, Two, with great March much credit that had woon, That in the Lobby with the Ladies were, Staying Delight, whilst Time away did runne, With such discourse as Women love to heare; Charg'd on the sudden by the armed Trayne, Were, at their entrance, miserably slayne. 65 When, as from Snow-crown'd Skidow's loftie Cleeves, A loftie Mountaine in Cumberland, under which, lye many Lakes and Meres, abounding with Fowle of sundry kinds. Some fleet-wing'd Haggard, tow'rds her preying howre, Amongst the Teyle and Moore-bred Mallard drives, And th'Ayre of all her feather'd flocks doth scowre, Whilst to regayne her former height, she strives, The fearefull Fowle all prostrate to her power; Such a sharpe shreeke did ring throughout the Vault, Made by the Women at the fierce Assault. 66 Unarm'd was March (she onely in his Armes, March apprehended. Too soft a Shield to beare their boyst'rous Blowes) Who least of all suspected such Alarmes, And to be so encountred by his Foes, When he was most improvident of Harmes. O, had he had but Weapons to his Woes! Either his Valour had his life redeem'd, Or in her sight dy'd happily esteem'd. 67 But there, about him looking for the King, Whom he suppos'd his Judgement could not misse; Which when he found, by his imagining, Of those most perfect Liniaments of his: The Earles Speech to the King, at his Apprehension.Quoth he, The Man that to thy Crowne did bring Thee, at thy hands might least have look'd for this; And in this Place, the least of all the rest, Where onely sacred Solitude is blest. 68 Her presence frees th'Offendor of his Ill, Whose God-like Greatnesse makes the place Divine; And canst thou, King, thus countermand her Will, Who gave to thee the Power that now is thine, And in her Armes in safetie kept thee still, As in a most inviolated Shrine? Yet dar'st thou irreligiously despise, And thus prophane these sacred Liberties. 69 But, even as when old Ilion was surpris'd, The Grecians issuing from the Woodden Horse, The Pride and Furie roughly exercis'd, Op'ning the wide Gates, letting in their Force, Putting in act what was before devis'd, Without all Humane Pitie, or Remorse; Even so did they, with whose confused sound, Words were not heard, &amp; poore complaints were drown'd. 70 Dissolv'd to Teares, she follow'd him: O Teares! Elixar-like, turne all to Pearle you touch; To weepe with her, the hard Wall scarce forbeares, The wofull words she uttered, were such, Able to wound th'impenitrablest Eares, Her Plaints so piercing, and her Griefe so much; And to the King, when she at last could come, Thus to him spake, though he to her were dumbe: 71 Deare Sonne (quoth she) let not his Bloud be spilt, The Queenes Speech to the King her Sonne, in the tumultuous Prease, at the taking of Mortimer: in two Stanza's. So often vent'red to redeeme thy Crowne. In all his life can there be found that Guilt? Thinke of his love, on which thou once shouldst frowne: 'Twas he, thy Seat that so substantiall built, Long with his shoulder sav'd from shaking downe; 'Twas he, the meanes that first for thee did find, To passe for France, to exercise thy Mind. 72 Even for the love thou bear'st to that deare Blood, From which (my Sonne) thou didst receive thy life, Play not the Niggard in so small a good, With her, to whom thy Bounties should be rife, Beg'd on those knees, at which thou oft hast stood: O, let my up-held Hands appease this strife! Let not the Breath, from this sad Bosome sent, Without thy Pittie, be but vainely spent. 73 When in the Tumult, with the sudden Fright, Whilst ev'ry one for Safetie sought about, And none regarded to maintaine the Light, Which being over-wasted, was gone out, It being then the mid time of the Night, Ere they could quit the Castle of the Rout; The Queene alone (at least, if any neare) The Queene left in miserable distresse. They were her Women, almost dead with feare. 74 When Horror, Darkenesse, and her inward Woe, Began to worke on her afflicted Mind, Upon her Weakenesse tyrannizing so, As they would doe their utmost, in their kind, And as then those, she need no other Foe, Such power her Fortune had to them assign'd, To racke her Conscience (by their Torture due) It selfe t'accuse of whatsoe'r it knew. 75 O God! (thought she) Is yet an Houre scarce past, Since that my Greatnesse, my Command more hye, And Eminencie, wherein I was plac'd, Wan me respect in ev'ry humble Eye? How am I now abused, how disgrac'd? Did ever Queene in my dejection lye? These things she pond'red, as Despaire still brought Their sundry Formes into her troubled Thought. 76 Servile Followers flye from their Lords Fall.To London thus they March a Prisoner led, Which there had oft been courted by the Queene, From whom, his Friends and his late Followers fled, Of many a Gallant follow'd that had been, Of which, there was not one durst shew his head, Much lesse t'abet his side, that durst be seene; Which at his Fall made them to wonder more, Who saw the Pompe wherein he liv'd before. 77 What poore Things the most part of Men be.O Miserie! where once thou art possest, See but how quickly thou canst alter kind, And like a Circe, metamorphosest The Man, that hath not a most God-like Mind: The fainting Spirit, O how thou canst infest! Whose yeelding Frayltie eas'ly thou canst find, And by thy vicious presence, with a breath Gives him up fett'red, basely fear'd to death. 78 This Parliament was held at London.When soone the King a Parlament decreed, (Ne'r till that time sole Master of his Crowne) And against March doth legally proceed, Fitted with Tooles to digge that Mountaine downe, To which, both high and low tooke speciall heed; He ne'r had Fawne, but then he had a Frowne, King The Articles whereupon Mortimer was condemned: in these two last Lines, and the following Stanza. Edwards Bloud, with both the Spensers, call For Vengeance on him, by the Voice of all. 79 With deare Kents death, his Credit next they blot, Kent dearely beloved of the Commons: the cause of his Death shewed in the tenth Stanza of this Canto. Then on him lay the Wards and Liveries, Which he by Craft into his Hands had got, The Summes then seized to his Treasuries: Then In the eight Stanza, before going. Joan the Princesse, married to the Scot, The Signe at An especiall Article against Mortimer, That the Scots escaped at Stanhope Parke, by a Signall given to them by him. Stanhope, to the Enemies; With all things ripp'd from the Records of Time, That any way might aggravate his Crime. 80 O dire Revenge! when thou by Time art rak'd Out of the Ashes which have hid thee long, (Wherein thou lay'st, as thou hadst quite been slak'd) And becom'st kindled with the breath of Wrong, How soone thy hideous Furie is awak'd? From thy poore Sparks, what Flames are quickly sprung? To waste their Tops, how soone do'st thou aspire, Whose Weight and Greatnesse once represt thy fire? 81 And what avayl'd his Answer in that Case? Which the time then did utterly distaste, And look'd upon him with so sterne a Face, As it his Actions utterly disgrac'd: No friendly Bosome gave him any Place, Who was cleane out of all Opinion cast; Taking his Pen, his Sorrowes to deceive, Thus of the Queene he lastly took his leave. 82 Bright Empresse, yet be pleased to peruse A Letter sent from Mortimer, to the Queene, a little before his Death: in the seven Stanza's following. The Swan-like Dirges of a dying Man, Although not like the Raptures of the Muse, In our fresh Youth, when our Love first began, Into my Brest that did the fire infuse, That glorious Day, that I thy rich Glove wan, And in my Course, a flame of Lightning bet Recounting the first beginning of their Love. Out of proud Harfords high-plum'd Burgonet. 83 As for your Sonne, that hast'neth on my Death, Madame, you know, I lov'd him as mine owne, And when I could have grasped out his Breath, I set him eas'ly on his Fathers Throne; Which now his Power too quickly witnesseth, Who to this height in Tyrannie is growne; But yet, be his Ingratitude forgiven, As after Death, I wish to be in Heaven. 84 And for the sole Rule, whereon so he stands, Came Bastard William but himselfe to shore? Or had he not our Fathers valiant Hands, Who in that Field our ancient Ensigne bore, (Guarded about with our well-order'd Bands) Which then his The Conquerour bare two Leopards Passant, or, in a Field, Geules. Leopards for their safetie wore, Looking at Hastings is a Towne in Sussex, where the Battell was fought betweene the Normans and English. Hastings like that ominous Lake, From whose black Depths our glorious Name we take? 85 Why fell I not from that my all-arm'd Horse, On which I rode before the Gates of Gaunt, Before the Belgick and Burgonian Force, There challenging their Countries Combatant; Cast from my Seat, in some robustious course, That they of me the Victorie might vaunt? Why sunke I not under my batt'red Shield, To grace a brave Foe, and renowne a Field? 86 Yet never serv'd I Fortune like a Slave, Nor have, through Basenesse, made her Bounties lesse, In me her Judgement poorely to deprave; Nought hath she lent me, that Ile not confesse, Nay, Int'rest for her Principall I gave, My Mind hath suted with her Mightinesse; Her Frownes with scorne, &amp; Mortimer doth beare, For nothing can she doe, that he can feare. 87 That ne'r quayles me, at which your Greatest quake, Nor ought that's dreadfull, Danger me can show, Through Sword and Fire so us'd my way to take: In Death what can be (that I doe not know) That I should feare a Covenant to make With it, which welcom'd, finisheth my Woe? “And nothing can th'afflicted Conscience grieve, “But He may pardon, who can all forgive. 88 And thus, thou most adored in my Heart, The Thoughts of whom, my humbled Spirit doth rayse, Lady most faire, most deare, of most desert, Worthie of more then any mortall Prayse. Condemned March thus lastly doth depart, From the great'st Empresse living in her Dayes; Nor with my Dust mine Honour I interre: Cæsar thus dy'd, and thus dies Mortimer. 89 When secretly he sent this Letter to her, The Passion of the Queene, at the receiving of the Earles Letter; continued to the end of the Canto. Whose Superscription, was her Princely Stile; She knew the Hand, and thought it came to woo her, With which Conceit she pleas'd her selfe a while, Then which, no one thing serv'd so t'undoe her, By feeding her with Flatt'rie and with Guile, To make her still more sensible of Paine, Which her sad Heart was shortly to sustaine. 90 Using her Fingers to up-rip the Seale, Which holpe to hide these ill Newes from her Eyes, Loth as it were, such Tidings to reveale, As might her Senses suddenly surprize; But when her white Hand did so hardly deale With the poore Paper, that the Wax must rise, It stucke upon her Fingers bloudie red, As to portend some deare Bloud should be shed. 91 When by degrees she eas'ly doth begin, And as a Fish playes with a bayted Hooke, So softly yet she swallow'd Sorrow in, Till she her bane into her Bowels tooke; And then she sees th'expences of her sinne Sadly set downe in that blacke Doomes-day Booke, And the deare Summes that were to be defray'd, Before the Debt were absolutely pay'd. 92 Whole Hoasts of Sorrowes her sicke Heart assayle, When ev'ry Letter lanc'd her like a Dart, Striving against her, which should most prevayle, And yet not one, but prick'd her to the Heart; Where one word might anothers Woe bewayle, And with its Neighbour seem'd to beare a part, Each Line serv'd for so true a Text to her, As in her Woes would no way let her erre. 93 Griefe bad her looke, yet soone it bad her leave, Wherewith o'rcharg'd, she neither sees nor heares, Her useful'st Senses soonest her deceive, The Sight shuts up her Eyes, the Sound her Eares, And of her Reading doe her quite bereave, When for a Fescue she doth use her Teares, Which, when some Line she loosely over-past, The Drops could tell her, where she left the last. 94 Somewhat at length recov'ring of her Sight, Deepely she curs'd her Sorrow-seeing Eye, And sayd, she was deluded by the Light, Or was abus'd by the Orthographie, Or some one had devised it in spight, Poynting it false, her Schollership to trie; “Thus when we fondly flatter our Desires, “Our best Conceits doe prove the greatest Lyers. 95 Her trembling Hand, as in a Fever, quakes, Wherewith the Paper doth a little stirre, Which she imagines at her Sorrow shakes, And pitties it, which she thinkes pitties her; Each small thing somewhat to the greater makes, And to her Humor something doth inferre; Her woe-ty'd Tongue but when she once could free: Sweet Mortimer, my most-lov'd Lord (quoth she) 96 For thy deare Ashes be my Brest the Urne, Which as a Relique, I of thee will save, Mix'd with the Teares that I for thee shall mourne, Which in this Bosome shall their Buriall have; Out of which place, they never shall returne, Nor give the Honour to another Grave, But here, as in a Temple, be preserv'd, Wherein thy Image is most lively carv'd. 97 Then breakes she out, in cursing of her Sonne, But Mortimer so runneth in her Mind, As that shee ended, ere she had begun, Speaking before, what should have come behind: From that, she to another Course doth runne, To be reveng'd in some notorious kind, By Stab, or Poyson; and shee'le sweare to both, But for her life she could not find an Oath. 98 She Pen and Paper takes, and makes no doubt, But the Kings cruell dealing to discover; But soone forgetting what she went about, Poore Queene, she fell to scribbling to her Lover: Here she put in, and there she blotted out, Her Passion did so violently move her, That turning backe to read what she had writ, She tore the Paper, and condemn'd her Wit. 99 But from her Passion being somewhat rays'd, Like one that lately had been in a Swound, Or felt some strange Extremitie appeas'd, That had been taken from some Blow, or Wound, Yet on that Part it had so strongly seiz'd, That for the same no Remedie was found; But at the very Point their Life to lose, As they their Goods, she doth her Griefe dispose. 100 Quoth she, King Edward, as thou art my Sonne, Leaving the World, this Legacie I leave thee: My Hearts true love, my Mortimer hath wonne, And yet of All he shall not so bereave thee; But for this Mischiefe to thy Mother done, Take thou my Curse, so that it may out-live thee, That as thy Deed doth dayly me torment, So may my Curse thee, by my Testament. 101 And henceforth, in this solitarie Place, Ever residing from the publique sight, A private Life I willingly imbrace, No more rejoycing in the obvious Light, To consummate this too-long ling'ring space, Till Death inclose me in continuall Night; Let never Sleepe more close my wearied Eye, So Isabella, lay thee downe, and dye. The end of the sixt Canto. ENGLANDS HEROICALL EPISTLES. BY Michael Drayton, ESQVIRE. With Some short Annotations of the Chronicle Historie to the same: To which, the Reader is directed, by this Marke ? in the beginning of euery Line, to which the Annotations are pertinent. TO M. MICHAEL DRAYTON. Long have I wisht, and hop'd my weaker Muse (In nothing strong, but my unhappie Love) Would give me leave my fortune to approve, And view the World, as named Poets use; But still her fruitlesse Bosome doth refuse To blesse me with indifferencie of Prayse, Not daring (like to many) to abuse That Title, which true Worth should onely rayse: Thus Bank'rout, and despairing of mine owne, I set my wish and hope (kind Friend) on thee, Whose Fruit approv'd, and better Fortune knowne, Tells me, thy Muse my Loves sole Heire must be; So barren Wombes imbrace their Neighbors yong, So dumbe Men speake by them that have a Tongue. Thomas Hassel, Gent. TO M. MICHAEL DRAYTON. Now I perceive Pythagoras divin'd, When he that mocked Maxim did maintaine, That Spirits once spoyl'd, revested were againe, Though chang'd in shape, remaining one in Mind; These Love-sicke Princes passionate estates, Who feeling reades, he cannot but allow, That Ovids Soule revives in Drayton now, Still learn'd in Love, still rich in rare Conceits, This pregnant Spirit affecting further Skill, Oft alt'ring Forme, from vulgar Wits retir'd, In divers Idyoms mightily admir'd, Did prosecute that sacred Studie still; While to a full Perfection now attain'd, He sings so sweetly, that himselfe is stain'd. Will. Alexander, Knight, Scotus. TO M. MICHAEL DRAYTON. How can he write, that broken hath his Pen, Hath rent his Paper, throwne his Inke away, Detests the World, and companie of Men, Because they grow more hatefull day by day? Yet with these broken Reliques, mated Mind, And what a justly-grieved Thought can say, I give the World to know, I ne'r could find A Worke more like to live a longer day. Goe Verse, an Object for the proudest Eye, Disdaine those, which disdaine to reade thee over, Tell them, they know not how they should descry The secret Passions of a wittie Lover: For they are such, as none but those shall know, Whom Beautie schooles, to hold the blind Boyes Bow. Once I had vow'd, (O, who can all Vowes keepe?) Henceforth to smother my unluckie Muse; Yet for thy sake, she started out of sleepe, Yet now she dyes: Then doe as Kinsfolkes use; Close up the eyes of my new-dying stile, As I have opened thy sweet Babes ere-while. Edmond Scory, Knight. THE EPISTLE OF ROSAMOND TO KING HENRY THE SECOND. The Argument. Henry the Second keepeth (with much care) Lord Clifford daughter, Rosamond the faire; And whilst his Sonnes doe Normandie invade, He forc'd to France, with wond'rous cost had made A Labyrinth in Woodstock, where unseene His Love might lodge safe, from his jealous Queene: Yet when he stay'd beyond his time abroad, Her pensive Brest, his Darling to unload, In this Epistle doth her Griefe complaine; And his Rescription tells her his againe. If yet thine Eyes (Great Henry) may endure These tainted Lines, drawne with a Hand impure, (Which faine would blush, but Feare keeps Blushes backe, And therefore suted in despairing Blacke) Let me for Loves sake their acceptance crave, But that sweet Name (vile) I prophaned have; Punish my Fault, or pittie mine estate, Reade them for Love, if not for Love, for Hate. If with my Shame thine Eyes thou faine would'st feede, Here let them surfet, of my Shame to reade: This scribbled Paper which I send to thee, If noted rightly, doth resemble mee: As this pure Ground, whereon these Letters stand, So pure was I, ere stayned by thy Hand; Ere I was blotted with this foule Offence, So cleere and spotlesse was mine Innocence: Now, like these Markes which taint this hatefull Scroule, Such the blacke sinnes which spot my leprous Soule. What, by this Conquest, canst thou hope to winne, Where thy best Spoyle, is but the Act of Sinne? Why on my Name this slander do'st thou bring, To make my Fault renowned by a King? “Fame never stoopes to things, but meane and poore, “The more our Greatnesse, our Fault is the more; “Lights on the Ground, themselves doe lessen farre, “But in the Ayre, each small Sparke seemes a Starre. Why, on my Woman-frayltie should'st thou lay So strong a Plot, mine Honour to betray? Or thy unlawfull Pleasure should'st thou buy, Both with thine owne shame, and my Infamie? 'Twas not my Minde consented to this Ill, Then had I beene transported by my Will; For, what my Bodie was inforc'd to doe, (Heaven knowes) my Soule yet ne'r consented to: For, through mine Eyes had she her liking seene, Such as my Love, such had my Lover beene. “True Love is simple, like his Mother Truth, “Kindly Affection, Youth to love with Youth; “No greater corsive to our blooming Yeeres, “Then the cold Badge of Winter-blasted Hayres. “Thy Kingly Power makes to withstand thy Foes, “But cannot keepe backe Age, with Time it growes; “Though Honour our ambitious Sex doth please, “Yet in that Honour, Age a foule Disease: “Nature hath her free Course in all, and then “Age is alike, in Kings, and other Men. Which all the World will to my shame impute, That I, my selfe did basely prostitute; And say, that Gold was Fuell to the Fire, Gray Hayres in Youth not kindling greene Desire. O no; that wicked Woman, wrought by thee, My Tempter was to that forbidden Tree; That subtill Serpent, that seducing Devill, Which bad me taste the Fruit of Good and Evill; That Circe, by whose Magicke I was charm'd, And to this monstrous shape am thus transform'd; That vip'rous Hag, the Foe to her owne Kind, That divellish Spirit, to damne the weaker Mind; Our Fraylties Plague, our Sexes onely Curse, Hells deep'st Damnation, the worst Evils worse. But Henry, how canst thou affect me thus, T'whom thy remembrance now is odious? My haplesse Name, with Henries Name I found, Cut in the Glasse with Henries Diamond; That Glasse from thence faine would I take away, But then I feare the Ayre would me betray; Then doe I strive to wash it out with Teares, But then the same more evident appeares. Then doe I cover it with my guiltie Hand, Which that Names witnesse doth against me stand; Once did I sinne, which Memorie doth cherish, Once I offended, but I ever perish. “What Griefe can be, but Time doth make it lesse? “But Infamie, Time never can suppresse. Sometimes, to passe the tedious irkesome Houres, I climbe the top of Woodstocks mounting Towres, Where, in a Turret, secretly I lye, To view from farre such as doe travell by; Whither (me thinkes) all cast their Eyes at mee, As through the Stones my Shame did make them see, And with such Hate the harmelesse Walls doe view, As ev'n to Death their Eyes would me pursue. The married Women curse my hatefull Life, Wronging a faire Queene, and a vertuous Wife; The Maidens wish, I buried quicke may die, And from each place neere my abode, doe flie. In the Cretean Labyrinth a Monster was inclosed, called a Minotaure, the Historie whereof is well knowne; but the Labyrinth was framed by Dedalus, with so many intricate Wayes, that being entred, one could either hardly or never returne, being in manner of a Maze, save that it was larger, the Wayes being walled in on every side, out of the which, Theseus, by Ariadnes helpe, (lending him a Clue of Thred) escaped. Some report, that it was a House, having one halfe beneath the ground, another above; the Chamber doores therein so deceitfully inwrapped, and made to open so many wayes, that it was held a matter almost impossible to returne. Some have held it to have beene an Allegorie of Mans Life: true it is, that the Comparison will hold; for what liker to a Labyrinth, then the Maze of Life? But it is affirmed by Antiquitie, that there was indeed such a Building; though Dedalus being a name applied to the Workmans excellencie, make it suspected: for Dedalus is nothing else but, Ingenious, or Artificiall. Hereupon it is used among the ancient Poets, for any thing curiously wrought. Rosamonds Labyrinth, whose Ruines, together with her Well, being paved with square Stone in the bottome, and also her Tower, from which the Labyrinth did runne (are yet remaining) was altogether under ground, being Vaults arched and walled with Bricke and Stone, almost inextricably wound one within another; by which, if at any time her Lodging were laid about by the Queene, shee might easily avoid Perill eminent, and if neede be, by secret Issues take the Ayre abroad, many Furlongs, round about Woodstocke in Oxfordshire, wherein it was situated. Thus much for Rosamonds Labyrinth.Well knew'st thou what a Monster I would be, When thou didst build this Labyrinth for me, Meander is a River in Lycia, a Province of Natolia, or Asia minor, famous for the sinuositie and often turning thereof, rising from certaine Hills in Meonia: Hereupon are intricate Turnings, by a Transumptive and Metonymicall kind of speech, called Meanders; for this River did so strangely path it selfe, that the Foot seemed to touch the Head.Whose strange Meanders turning ev'ry way, Be like the course wherein my Youth did stray; Onely a Clue doth guide me out and in, But yet still walke I circular in sinne. As in the Gallerie this other day, I and my Woman past the time away, 'Mongst many Pictures, which were hanging by, The silly Girle at length hapt to espie Chaste Lucrece Image, and desires to know, What shee should be, her selfe that murd'red so? Why Girle (quoth I) this is that Roman Dame; Not able then to tell the rest for shame, My Tongue doth mine owne Guiltinesse betray; With that I sent the prattling Wench away, Lest when my lisping guiltie Tongue should hault, My Lookes might prove the Index to my Fault. As that Life-bloud which from the Heart is sent, In Beauties Field pitching his Crimson Tent, In lovely Sanguine sutes the Lillie Cheeke, Whilst it but for a resting Place doth seeke; And changing oftentimes with sweet Delight, Converts the White to Red, the Red to White; The Blush with Palenesse for the place doth strive, The Palenesse thence the Blush would gladly drive; Thus in my Brest a thousand Thoughts I carrie, Which in my Passion diversly doe varie. When as the Sunne hales tow'rds the Westerne slade, And the Trees shadowes hath much taller made, Forth goe I to a little Current neere, Which like a wanton Trayle creepes here and there, Where, with mine Angle casting in my Bait, The little Fishes (dreading the deceit) With fearefull nibbling flye th'inticing Gin, By Nature taught what danger lies therein. Things Reasonlesse, thus warn'd by Nature be, Yet I devour'd the Bait was layd for me: Thinking thereon, and breaking into Grones, The bubbling Spring, which trips upon the Stones, Chides me away, lest sitting but too nie, I should pollute that Native puritie. It might be reported, how at Godstow, where this Rose of the World was sumptuously interred, a certaine Bishop, in the Visitation of his Diocesse, caused the Monument which had beene erected to her Honour, utterly to bee demolished: but let that severe chastisement of Rosamond, then dead, at this time also be over-passed, lest she should seeme to be the Shame of the World. Rose of the World, so doth import my Name, Shame of the World, my Life hath made the same. And to th'unchaste this Name shall given be, Of Rosamond, deriv'd from Sinne and Me. The Cliffords take from me that Name of theirs, Which hath beene famous for so many yeeres: They blot my Birth with hatefull Bastardie, That I sprang not from their Nobilitie; They my alliance utterly refuse, Nor will a Strumpet shall their Name abuse. Here, in the Garden, wrought by curious hands, Naked Diana in the Fountaine stands, With all her Nymphes got round about to hide her, As when Acteon had by chance espy'd her: This sacred Image I no sooner view'd, But as that metamorphos'd Man, pursu'd By his owne Hounds; so, by my Thoughts am I, Which chase me still, which way soe'r I flye. Touching the Grasse, the Honey-dropping Dew, Which falls in Teares before my limber shoo, Upon my Foot consumes in weeping still, As it would say, Why went'st thou to this Ill? Thus, to no Place in safetie can I goe, But every thing doth give me cause of Woe. In that faire Casket, of such wond'rous Cost, Thou sent'st the Night before mine Honour lost, Amimone was wrought, a harmelesse Maid, By Neptune, that adult'rous God, betray'd; She prostrate at his Feet, begging with Prayers, Wringing her Hands, her Eyes swolne up with Teares: This was not an intrapping Bait from thee, But by thy Vertue gently warning mee, And to declare for what intent it came, Lest I therein should ever keepe my shame. And in this Casket (ill I see it now) That Joves Love I ö, turn'd into a Cow; Yet was she kept with Argus hundred Eyes: So wakefull still be Juno's Jealousies: By this I well might have fore-warned beene, T'have cleer'd my selfe to thy suspecting Queene, Who with more hundred Eyes attendeth mee, Then had poore Argus single Eyes to see. In this thou rightly imitatest Jove, Into a Beast thou hast transform'd thy Love; Nay, worser farre (beyond their beastly kind) A Monster both in Bodie and in Mind. The Waxen Taper which I burne by Night, With the dull vap'rie dimnesse mockes my Sight, As though the Dampe which hinders the cleere Flame, Came from my Breath, in that Night of my Shame; When as it look'd with a darke lowring Eye, To see the losse of my Virginitie. And if a Starre but by the Glasse appeare, I straight intreat it, not to looke in here; I am alreadie hatefull to the Light, And will it too, betray me to the Night? Then sith my Shame so much belongs to thee, Rid me of that, by onely murd'ring mee; And let it justly to my charge be layd, That I thy Person meant to have betray'd: Thou shalt not need by circumstance t'accuse me, If I denie it, let the Heavens refuse me. My Life's a Blemish, which doth cloud thy Name, Take it away, and cleare shall shine thy Fame: Yeeld to my Sute, if ever Pittie mov'd thee, In this shew Mercie, as I ever lov'd thee. HENRY TO ROSAMOND. When first the Post arrived at my Tent, And brought the Letters Rosamond had sent, Thinke from his Lips but what deare Comfort came, When in mine Eare he softly breath'd thy Name: Straight I injoyn'd him, of thy Health to tell, Longing to heare my Rosamond did well; With new Enquiries then I cut him short, When of the same he gladly would report, That with the earnest Haste, my Tongue oft trips, Catching the words halfe spoke, out of his Lips: This told, yet more I urge him to reveale, To lose no time, whilst I unrip'd the Seale. The more I reade, still doe I erre the more, As though mistaking somewhat said before: Missing the Point, the doubtfull Sense is broken, Speaking againe what I before had spoken. Still in a Swoond, my Heart revives and faints, 'Twixt Hopes, Despaires, 'twixt Smiles and deepe Complaints. As these sad Accents sort in my Desires, Smooth Calmes, rough Stormes, sharpe Frosts, and raging Fires, Put on with Boldnesse, and put backe with Feares, For oft thy Troubles doe extort my Teares. O, how my Heart at that blacke Line did tremble! That blotted Paper should Thy Selfe resemble; O, were there Paper but neere halfe so white! The Gods thereon their sacred Lawes would write With Pens of Angels Wings; and for their Inke, That Heavenly Nectar, their immortall Drinke. Majestike Courage strives to have supprest This fearefull Passion, stir'd up in my Brest; But still in vaine the same I goe about, My Heart must breake within, or Woes breake out. Robert, Earle of Leicester, who tooke part with young King Henry, entred into England with an Armie of three thousand Flemings, and spoyled the Countries of Norfolke and Suffolke, being succoured by many of the Kings private Enemies.Am I at home pursu'd with private Hate, And Warre comes raging to my Palace Gate? Is meager Envie stabbing at my Throne, Treason attending when I walke alone? King Henry the second, the first Plantaginet, accused for the death of Thomas Becket, Arch-bishop of Canterburie, slaine in that Cathedrall Church, was accursed by Pope Alexander, although he urged sufficient proofe of his innocencie in the same, and offered to take upon him any Penance, so he might avoid the Curse and Interdiction of his Realme.And am I branded with the Curse of Rome, And stand condemned by a Councels Doome? Henry the young King, whom King Henry had caused to be crowned in his life (as hee hoped) both for his owne good, and the good of his Subjects, which indeede turned to his owne Sorrow, and the Trouble of the Realme; for he rebelled against him, and raysing a Power, by the meanes of Lewes King of France, and William King of Scots (who tooke part with him) and invaded Normandie.And by the pride of my rebellious Sonne, Rich Normandie with Armies over-runne? Fatall my Birth, unfortunate my Life, Never King more unfortunate then King Henry, in the disobedience of his Children: First, Henry, then Geffrey, then Richard, then John, all at one time or other, first or last, unnaturally rebelled against him; then, the Jealousie of Elinor his Queene, who suspected his love to Rosamond: Which grievous Troubles, the Devout of those Times attributed to happen to him justly, for refusing to take on him the Government of Jerusalem, offered to him by the Patriarke there; which Countrey was mightily afflicted by the Souldan.Unkind my Children, most unkind my Wife. Griefe, Cares, old Age, Suspition to torment me, Nothing on Earth to quiet or content me; So many Woes, so many Plagues to find, Sicknesse of Bodie, discontent of Mind; Hopes left, Helps reft, Life wrong'd, Joy interdicted, Banish'd, distress'd, forsaken, and afflicted. Of all Reliefe hath Fortune quite bereft me? Onely my Love yet to my Comfort left me: And is one Beautie thought so great a thing, To mitigate the Sorrowes of a King? Bar'd of that Choice the Vulgar often prove; Have we, then they, lesse priviledge in Love? Is it a King the wofull Widdow heares? Is it a King dryes up the Orphans Teares? Is it a King regards the Clyents crie? Gives Life to him, by Law condemn'd to die? Is it his Care the Common-wealth that keepes, As doth the Nurse her Babie, whilst it sleepes? And that poore King of all those Hopes prevented, Unheard, unhelp'd, unpitti'd, unlamented? Yet let me be with Povertie opprest, Of Earthly Blessings rob'd, and dis-possest, Let me be scorn'd, rejected, and revil'd, And from my Kingdome let me live exil'd, Let the Worlds Curse upon me still remaine, And let the last bring on the first againe; All Miseries that wretched Man may wound, Leave for my Comfort onely Rosamond. For Thee, swift Time his speedie course doth stay, At thy Command, the Destinies obay; Pittie is dead, that comes not from thine Eyes, And at thy Feet ev'n Mercie prostrate lyes. If I were feeble, rheumatike, or cold, These were true signes that I were waxed old: But I can march all day in massie Steele, Nor yet my Armes unwieldy weight doe feele; Nor wak'd by Night with Bruise or bloudie Wound, The Tent my Bed, no Pillow but the Ground: For very Age had I layne Bedred long, One Smile of Thine, againe could make me Yong. Were there in Art a Power but so divine, As is in that sweet Angell-Tongue of Thine, That great Enchantresse, which once tooke such paines, To put young Bloud into old Æsons Veines, And in Groves, Mountaines, and the Moorish Fen, Sought out more Hearbes then had been knowne to Men, And in the pow'rfull Potion that she makes, Put Bloud of Men, of Birds, of Beasts, and Snakes; Never had needed to have gone so farre, To seeke the Soyles where all those Simples are; One Accent from thy Lips the Bloud more warmes, Then all her Philters, Exorcismes, and Charmes. Thy Presence hath repaired in one day, What many Yeeres with Sorrowes did decay, And made fresh Beautie in her flower to spring, Out of the wrinckles of Times ruining. Ev'n as the hungry Winter-starved Earth, When she by nature labours towards her Birth, Still as the Day upon the darke World creepes, One Blossome forth after another peepes, Till the small Flower, whose Root (at last) unbound, Gets from the frostie Prison of the Ground, Spreading the Leaves unto the pow'rfull Noone, Deck'd in fresh Colours, smiles upon the Sunne. Never unquiet Care lodg'd in that Brest, Where but one Thought of Rosamond did rest; Nor Thirst, nor Travaile, which on Warre attend, Ere brought the long Day to desired end; Nor yet did pale Feare, or leane Famine live, Where hope of Thee did any Comfort give: Ah, what Injustice then is this of Thee, That thus the Guiltlesse do'st condemne for me? When onely she (by meanes of my Offence) Redeemes thy Purenesse, and thy Innocence, When to our Wills perforce obey they must, That's just in them, what ere in us unjust, Of what we doe, not them account we make; The Fault craves pardon for th'Offendors sake: “And what to worke, a Princes Will may merit, “Hath deep'st impression in the gentlest Spirit. If't be my Name, that doth Thee so offend, No more my selfe shall be mine owne Names Friend; If it be that, which Thou do'st onely hate, That Name, in my Name, lastly hath his date; Say 'tis accurst, and fatall, and disprayse it, If written, blot it, if engraven, raze it; Say, that of all Names 'tis a Name of Woe, Once a Kings Name, but now it is not so: And when all this is done, I know 'twill grieve thee; And therefore (Sweet) why should I now beleeve thee? Nor shouldst thou thinke, those Eyes with Envie lowre, Which passing by thee, gaze up to thy Towre; But rather prayse thine owne, which be so cleere, Which from the Turret like two Starres appeare: Above, the Sunne doth shine, beneath, thine Eye, Mocking the Heav'n, to make another Skye. The little Streame which by thy Tow'r doth glide, Where oft thou spend'st the wearie Ev'ning Tide, To view thee well, his Course would gladly stay, As loth from thee to part so soone away, And with Salutes thy selfe would gladly greet, And offer up some small Drops at thy Feet; But finding, that the envious Bankes restraine it, T'excuse it selfe, doth in this sort complaine it, And therefore this sad bubbling Murmure keepes, And for thy want, within the Channell weepes. And as thou do'st into the Water looke, The Fish which see thy shaddow in the Brooke, Forget to feede, and all amazed lye, So daunted with the lustre of thine Eye. And that sweet Name, which thou so much do'st wrong, In time shall be some famous Poets Song; And with the very sweetnesse of that Name, Lyons and Tygers Men shall learne to tame. The carefull Mother, at her pensive Brest, With Rosamond shall bring her Babe to Rest; The little Birds (by Mens continuall sound) Shall learne to speake, and prattle Rosamond: And when in Aprill they begin to sing, With Rosamond shall welcome in the Spring; And she in whom all Rarities are found, Shall still be said to be a Rosamond. The little Flowers dropping their honied Dew, Which (as thou writ'st) doe weepe upon thy Shoo, Not for thy Fault (sweet Rosamond) doe moane, Onely lament, that thou so soone art gone; For if thy Foot touch Hemlocke as it goes, That Hemlock's made more sweeter then the Rose. Of Jove, or Neptune, how they did betray, Speake not; of Iö, or Amimone, When she, for whom Jove once became a Bull, Compar'd with Thee, had beene a Tawnie Trull; He a white Bull, and she a whiter Cow, Yet he nor she neere halfe so white as Thou. Long since (thou know'st) my Care provided for To lodge thee safe from jealous Ellinor; The Labyrinths Conveyance guides thee so, This Vaughan was a Knight, whom the King exceedingly loved, who kept the Palace at Woodstock, and much of the Kings Jewels and Treasure, to whom the King committed many of his Secrets, and in whom he reposed such trust, that he durst commit his Love unto his Charge.(Which onely Vaughan, thou, and I doe know) If she doe guard thee with an hundred Eyes, I have an hundred subtill Mercuries, To watch that Argus which my Love doth keepe, Untill Eye, after Eye, fall all to sleepe. And those Starres which looke in, but looke to see, (Wond'ring) what Starre here on the Earth should be; As oft the Moone, amidst the silent Night, Hath come to joy us with her friendly Light, And by the Curtaine help'd mine Eye to see What envious Night and Darkenesse hid from me; When I have wish'd, that she might ever stay, And other Worlds might still enjoy the Day. What should I say? Words, Teares, and Sighes be spent, And want of Time doth further Helpe prevent: My Campe resounds with fearefull shockes of Warre, Yet in my Brest more dang'rous Conflicts are; Yet is my Signall to the Battels sound, The blessed Name of beautious Rosamond. Accursed be that Heart, that Tongue, that Breath, Should thinke, should speake, or whisper of thy Death; For in one Smile, or Lowre from thy sweet Eye, Consists my Life, my Hope, my Victorie. Sweet Woodstock, where my Rosamond doth rest, Be blest in Her, in whom thy King is blest: For though in France a while my Body bee, My Heart remaines (deare Paradise) in thee. FINIS. KING JOHN TO MATILDA. The Argument. King John enamor'd; by all meanes assay'd To winne Matilda, a chaste Noble Mayd, The Lord Fitz-Waters Daughter: and to gayne her, When by his Courtship he could not obtayne her, Nor by his Gifts; strives (so farre being in) To get by force, what faire meanes could not winne, And banisheth the neerest of her Blood, Which he could thinke had his Desires withstood: When she to Dunmow to a Nun'rie flyes; Whither he writeth, and whence she replyes. When these my Letters come into thy view, Think them not forc'd, or fain'd, or strange, or new; Thou know'st no way, no means, no course exempted Left now unsought, unprov'd, or unattempted, All Rules, Regards, all secret Helpes of Art, What Knowledge, Wit, Experience can impart; And in the old Worlds Ceremonies doted, Good dayes for Love, Times, Houres, and Minutes noted; And where Art left, Love teacheth more to find, By signes in presence to expresse the Mind. Oft hath mine Eye told thine Eye, Beautie griev'd it, And beg'd but for one Looke, to have reliev'd it, And still with thine Eyes motion, mine Eye mov'd, Lab'ring for Mercie, telling how it lov'd; You blusht, I blusht; your Cheeke pale, pale was mine, My Red, thy Red, my Whitenesse answer'd thine; You sigh'd, I sigh'd, we both one Passion prove, But thy sigh is for Hate, my sigh for Love: If a word pass'd, that insufficient were, To helpe that word, mine Eye let forth a Teare; And if that Teare did dull or senselesse prove, My Heart would fetch a Throb, to make it move. Oft in thy Face, one Favour from the rest I singled forth, that pleas'd my Fancie best; This likes me most, another likes me more, A third, exceeding both those lik'd before: Then one, as Wonder were derived thence, Then that, whose rarenesse passeth excellence. Whilst I behold thy Globe-like rowling Eye, Thy lovely Cheeke (me thinkes) stands smiling by, And tells me, those are Shadowes and Supposes, But bids me thither come, and gather Roses; Looking on that, thy Brow doth call to mee, To come to it, if Wonders I will see: Now have I done, and then thy dimpled Chinne Againe doth tell me newly I begin, And bids me yet to looke upon thy Lip, Lest wond'ring least, the great'st I over-slip: My gazing Eye on this and this doth sease, Which surfets, yet cannot Desire appease. (Now like I Browne (O lovely Browne thy Haire) Onely in Brownnesse, Beautie dwelleth there. Then love I Blacke, thine Eye-ball blacke as Jet, Which in a Globe, pure Crystalline, is set: Then white; but Snow, nor Swan, nor Ivorie please, Then are thy Teeth more whiter then all these; In Browne, in Blacke, in Purenesse, and in White, All Love, all Sweets, all Rarenesse, all Delight: Thus thou, vile Theefe, my stolne Heart hence do'st carrie, And now thou flyest into a Sanctuarie. Fie peevish Girle, ingratefull unto Nature; Did she to this end frame thee such a Creature, That thou her glorie shouldst encrease thereby, And thou alone do'st scorne Societie? Why, Heaven made Beautie like her selfe to view, Not to be lock'd up in a smoakie Mew: A Rosie-tincted Feature is Heavens Gold, Which all Men joy to touch, all to behold. It was enacted when the World begun, That so rare Beautie should not live a Nunne; But if this Vow thou needs wilt undertake, O were mine Armes a Cloyster for thy sake: Still may his Paines for ever be augmented, This Superstition idly that invented; Ill might he thrive, who brought this Custome hither, That holy People might not live together. A happie Time, a good World was it then, When holy Women liv'd with holy Men; But Kings in this yet priviledg'd may bee, Ile be a Monke, so I may live with thee. Who would not rise to ring the Mornings Knell, When thy sweet Lips might be the sacring Bell? Or what is he, not willingly would fast, That on those Lips might feast his Lips at last? Who to his Mattens early would not rise, That might reade by the Light of thy faire Eyes? On Worldly Pleasures who would ever looke, That had thy Curles his Beads, thy Browes his Booke? Wert Thou the Crosse, to Thee who would not creepe, And wish, the Crosse still in his Armes to keepe? Sweet Girle, Ile take this holy Habit on me, Of meere Devotion that is come upon me; Holy Matilda, Thou the Saint of mine, Ile be thy Servant, and my Bed thy Shrine. When I doe offer, be thy Brest the Altar, And when I pray, thy Mouth shall be my Psalter. The Beades that we will bid, shall be sweet Kisses, Which we will number, if one Pleasure misses; And when an Ave comes, to say Amen, We will begin, and tell them o're againe: Now all good Fortune give me happy Thrift, As I should joy t'absolve thee after Shrift. But see, how much I doe my selfe beguile, And doe mistake thy meaning all this while: Thou took'st this Vow, to equall my Desire, Because thou wouldst have me to be a Frier, And that we two should comfort one another, A holy Sister, and a holy Brother, Thou as a Votresse to my Love alone, “She is most chaste, that's but injoy'd of One. Yea, now thy true Devotion doe I find, And sure, in this I much commend thy Mind; Else here thou do'st but ill Example give, And in a Nun'rie thus thou shouldst not live. Is't possible, the House that thou art in Should not be toucht (though with a Veniall sinne?) When such a shee-Priest comes her Masse to say, Twentie to one they all forget to pray: Well may we wish, they would their Hearts amend, When we be witnesse, that their Eyes offend; All Creatures have Desires, or else some lye, Let them thinke so that will, so will not I. Do'st thou not thinke our Ancestors were wise, That these Religious Cells did first devise? As Hospitals were for the Sore and Sicke, These for the Crook'd, the Halt, the Stigmaticke, Lest that their Seed, mark'd with Deformitie, Should be a Blemish to Posteritie. Would Heav'n her Beautie should be hid from sight, Ne'r would she thus her selfe adorne with Light; With sparkling Lamps nor would she paint her Throne; But she delighteth to be gaz'd upon: And when the golden glorious Sunne goes downe, Would she put on her Starre-bestudded Crowne, And in her Masking Sute, the spangled Skie, Come forth to bride it in her Revelrie; And gave this Gift to all Things in Creation, That they in this should imitate her Fashion. All Things that faire, that pure, that glorious beene, Offer themselves of purpose to be seene. In Sinkes and Vaults the ugly Toads doe dwell; The Divels, since most ugly, they in Hell. Our Mother (Earth) ne'r glories in her Fruit, Till by the Sunne clad in her Tinsell Sute; Nor doth she ever smile him in the Face, Till in his glorious Armes he her imbrace: Which proves she hath a Soule, Sense, and Delight, Of Generations feeling Appetite. Well Hypocrite (in Faith) wouldst thou confesse, What ere thy Tongue say, thy Heart saith no lesse. Note but this one thing (if nought else perswade) Nature of all things Male and Female made, Shewing her selfe in our Proportion plaine; For never made she any thing in vaine: For as thou art, should any have beene thus, She would have left ensample unto us. The Turtle, that's so true and chaste in love, Shewes by her Mate something the spirit doth move: Th'Arabian Bird, that never is but one, Is onely chaste, because she is alone: But had our Mother Nature made them Two, They would have done as Doves and Sparrowes doe; And therefore made a Martyr in desire, To doe her Penance lastly in the Fire: So may they all be rosted quicke, that bee Apostata's to Nature, as is shee. Find me but one so young, so faire, so free, (Woo'd, su'd, and sought by him that now seekes thee) But of thy Minde, and here I undertake, To build a Nun'rie for her onely sake. O, hadst thou tasted of those rare Delights, Ordain'd each where to please great Princes sights! To have their Beautie and their Wits admir'd, (Which is by nature of your Sexe desir'd) Attended by our Traynes, our Pompe, our Port, Like Gods ador'd abroad, kneel'd to in Court, To be saluted with the cheerefull Crie Of Highnesse, Grace, and soveraigne Majestie: “But unto them that know not Pleasures price, “All's one, a Prison, and a Paradise. If in a Dungeon, clos'd up from the Light, There is no diff'rence 'twixt the Day and Night; “Whose Pallat never tasted daintie Cates, “Thinkes homely Dishes Princely Delicates. Alas, poore Girle, I pittie thine estate, That now thus long hast liv'd disconsolate; Why now at length, yet let thy Heart relent, And call thy Father backe from Banishment; And with those Princely Honours here invest him, Of which, fond Love, not Hate hath dispossest him. Call from Exile thy deare Allies and Friends, To whom the furie of my Griefe extends; And if thou take my counsell in this case, I make no doubt thou shalt have better Grace: And leave thy Dunmow, that accursed Cell, There let blacke Night and Melancholy dwell; Come to the Court, where all Joyes shall receive thee, And till that Houre, yet with my Griefe I leave thee. This Epistle of King John to Matilda, is much more Poeticall then Historicall, making no mention at all of the Occurrents of the Time, or State, touching onely his love to her, and the extremitie of his Passions forced by his desires, rightly fashioning the Humour of this King, as hath beene truely noted by the most authenticall Writers: whose nature and disposition is trulyest discerned in the course of his Love; first, jesting at the Ceremonies of the Services of those Times; then, going about by all strong and probable Arguments, to reduce her to Pleasures and Delights; next, with promises of Honour, which he thinketh to be the last and greatest Meanes, and to have greatest power in her Sexe; with promise of calling home of her Friends, which he thought might be a great inducement to his desires. MATILDA TO KING JOHN. No sooner I receiv'd thy Letters here, Before I knew from whom, or whence they were, But sudden feare my bloudlesse veynes doth fill, As though divining of some future ill: And in a shivering extasie I stood, A chilly coldnesse ran through all my Blood; Opening the Packet, I shut up my rest, And let strange Cares into my quiet Brest, As though thy hard unpittying Hand had sent me, Some new devised Torture to torment me. Well had I hop'd, I had beene now forgot, Cast out with those things thou remembrest not; And that proud Beautie which enforst me hether, Had with my Name bin perished together: “But O (I see) our hoped Good deceives us, “But what we would forgoe, that seldome leaves us: Thy blamefull Lines bespotted so with Sin, Mine Eyes would clense, ere they to read begin: But I to wash an Indian goe about, For Ill so hard set on, is hard got out. I once determin'd, still to have been mute, Onely by Silence to refell thy Sute: But this againe did alter mine intent, For some will say, that Silence doth consent: “Desire with small encouraging growes bold, “And Hope of every little thing takes hold. I set me downe, at large to write my mind, But now nor Pen, nor Paper can I find; For still my passion is so powerfull o'r me, That I discerne not things that stand before me: Finding the Pen, the Paper, and the Waxe, These at command, and now Invention lacks; This sentence serves, and That my hand out-strikes; That pleaseth well, and This as much mislikes, I write, indite, I point, I raze, I quote, I enterline, I blot, correct, I note, I hope, despaire, take courage, faint, disdaine, I make, alledge, I imitate, I faine: Now thus it must be, and now thus, and thus, Bold, shame-fac'd, fearelesse, doubtfull, timorous; My faint Hand writing, when my full Eye reads, From ev'ry word strange Passion still proceeds. “O, when the Soule is fett'red once in Woe, “'Tis strange what Humors it doth force us to! A Teare doth drowne a Teare, Sigh, Sigh doth smother, This hinders that, that interrupts the other: Th'over-watched weakenesse of the sicke Conceit, Is that which makes small Beautie seeme so great; Like things which hid in troubled Waters lye, Which crook'd, seeme straight, if straight, the contrarie: And thus our vaine Imagination shewes it, As it conceives it, not as Judgement knowes it: (As in a Mirrour, if the same be true) Such as your likenesse, justly such are you: But as you change your selfe, it changeth there, And shewes you as you are, not as you were; And with your Motion doth your shadow move, If Frowne or Smile, such the conceit of Love. Why tell me, is it possible the Mind A Forme in all Deformitie should find? Within the compasse of Mans Face we see, How many sorts of severall Favours bee; And in the Chin, the Nose, the Brow, the Eye, The smallest Diff'rence that you can descry, Alters Proportion, altereth the Grace, Nay, oft destroyes the Favour of the Face: And in the World, scarce Two so like there are, One with the other, which if you compare, But being set before you both together, A judging Sight doth soone distinguish eyther. How Woman-like a Weakenesse is it then? O, what strange madnesse so possesseth Men! Bereft of Sense, such senselesse Wonders seeing, Without Forme, Fashion, Certaintie, or Being? For which so many die, to live in anguish, Yet cannot live, if thus they should not languish: That Comfort yeelds not, and yet Hope denyes not, A Life that lives not, and a Death that dyes not; That hates us most, when most it speakes us faire, Doth promise all Things, alwayes payes with Ayre; Yet sometime doth our greatest Griefe appease, To double Sorrow after little Ease. Like that which thy lascivious Will doth crave, Which if once had, thou never more canst have; Which if thou get, in getting thou do'st waste it, Taken, is lost, and perish'd, if thou hast it: Which if thou gain'st, thou ne'r the more hast wonne, I losing nothing, yet am quite undone; And yet of that, if that a King deprave me, No King restores, though he a Kingdome gave me. Then complayning of her Distresse; that flying thither, thinking there to finde Reliefe, shee seeth her selfe most assayled, where shee hoped to have found most Safetie.Do'st thou of Father and of Friends deprive me? And tak'st thou from me all that Heav'n did give me? What Nature claymes by Bloud, Allies, or Neerenesse, Or Friendship challenge by regard or dearenesse? Mak'st me an Orphan ere my Father die, A wofull Widow in Virginitie? Is thy unbridled Lust the cause of all? And now thy flatt'ring Tongue bewayles my Fall. The dead Mans Grave with fained Teares to fill, So the devouring Crocodile doth kill; To harbour Hate, in shew of wholesome Things, So in the Rose, the poysoned Serpent stings; To lurke farre off, yet lodge Destruction by, The Basiliske so poysons with the Eye; To call for Ayd, and then to lye in wait, So the Hyena murthers by Deceit; By sweet Inticement, sudden Death to bring, So from the Rocks, th'alluring Mermaids sing: In greatest Wants t'inflict the greatest Woe, Is ev'n the utmost Tyrannie can doe. But where (I see) the Tempest thus prevayles, What use of Anchors, or what need we Sayles? Above us, blust'ring Winds and dreadfull Thunder, The Waters gape for our Destruction under; Here, on this side, the furious Billowes flye, There Rocks, there Sands, and dang'rous Whirle-pooles lye. Is this the meane that Mightinesse approves? And in this sort doe Princes woo their Loves? Mildnesse would better sute with Majestie, Then rash Revenge and rough Severitie. O, in what Safetie Temperance doth rest, Obtayning Harbour in a soveraigne Brest! Which, if so praysefull in the meanest Men, In pow'rfull Kings how glorious is it then? After againe, standing upon the precise Points of Conscience, not to cast off this Habite she had taken.Fled I first hither, hoping to have ayd, Here thus to have mine Innocence betrayd? Is Court and Countrey both her Enemie, And no place found to shrowd in Chastitie? Each House for Lustra Harbour, and an Inne, And ev'ry Citie a Receit for Sinne? And all doe pittie Beautie in distresse; If Beautie chaste, then onely pittilesse: Thus is she made the instrument to Ill, And unreliev'd, may wander where she will. Lascivious Poets, which abuse the Truth, Which oft teach Age to sinne, infecting Youth, For the unchaste, make Trees and Stones to mourne, Or as they please, to other shapes doe turne: Cinyra's Daughter, whose incestuous Mind, Made her wrong Nature, and dishonour Kind, Long since by them is turn'd into a Myrrhe, Whose dropping Liquor ever weepes for her; And in a Fountaine, Biblis doth deplore Her Fault so vile and monsterous before: Silla, which once her Father did betray, Is now a Bird (if all be true they say.) She that with Phœbus did the foule Offence, Now metamorphos'd into Frankincense: Other, to Flowers, to Odors, and to Gumme; At least, Joves Leman is a Starre become: And more, they faine a thousand fond Excuses, To cloud their Scapes, and cover their Abuses; The Virgin onely they obscure and hide, Whilst the unchaste by them are deify'd, And if by them a Virgin be exprest, She must be rank'd ignobly with the rest. I am not now, as when thou saw'st me last, Time hath those Features utterly defac'd, And all those Beauties which sat on my Brow, Thou wouldst not thinke such ever had beene now; And glad I am that time with me is done, And at last, laying open more particularly the Miseries sustained by her Father in England, the Burning of his Castles and Houses, which shee proveth to be for her sake; as respecting onely her Honour, more then his Native Countrey, and his owne Fortunes.Vowing my selfe religiously a Nunne: My Vestall Habite me contenting more, Then all the Robes adorning me before. Had Rosamond (a Recluse of our sort) Taken our Cloyster, left the wanton Court, Shadowing that Beautie with a holy Vale, Which she (alas) too loosely set to sale, She need not, like an ugly Minotaur, Have beene lock'd up from jealous Elenor, But beene as famous by thy Mothers Wrongs, As by thy Father subject to all Tongues. “To shaddow Sinne, Might can the most pretend, “Kings, but the Conscience, all things can defend. A stronger Hand restraynes our wilfull pow'rs, A Will must rule above this Will of ours, Not following what our vaine Desires doe woo For Vertues sake, but what we (onely) doe. And hath my Father chose to live exil'd, Before his Eyes should see my Youth defil'd; Knitting up her Epistle with a great and constant Resolution.And to withstand a Tyrants lewd desire, Beheld his Townes spent in revengefull Fire: Yet never touch'd with Griefe; so onely I, Exempt from shame, might honourably die? And shall this Jewell, which so dearely cost, Be after all, by my Dishonour lost? No, no, each reverend Word, each holy Teare Of his, in me too deepe Impression beare, His latest Farwell, at his last depart, More deepely is ingraved in my Heart; Nor shall that Blot, by me, his Name shall have, Bring his gray haires with sorrow to the Grave, Better his Teares to fall upon my Tombe, Than for my Birth to curse my Mothers Wombe. Though Dunmow give no refuge here at all, Dunmow can give my Bodie Buriall. If all remorselesse, no Teare-shedding Eye, My Selfe will moane my Selfe, so live, so die. This Epistle containeth no particular Points of Historie, more then the generalitie of the Argument layeth open: for after the Banishment of the Lord Robert Fitz-water, and that Matilda was become a Recluse at Dunmow (from whence this Reply is imagined to be written) the King still earnestly persisting in his Sute, Matilda with this chaste and constant Denyall, hopes yet at length to finde some comfortable Remedie, and to rid her selfe of Doubts, by taking upon her this Monasticke Habite: and to shew, that shee still beareth in minde his former Crueltie, bred by the impatience of his Lust, shee remembreth him of her Fathers Banishment, and the lawlesse Exile of her Allies and Friends. FINIS. QUEENE ISABEL TO MORTIMER. The Argument. Faire Isabel, Edward the Seconds Queene, Philip of France his Daughter; for the Spleene She bare her Husband, for that he affected Lascivious Minions, and her Love neglected; Drew to her Favour (striving to preferre) That valiant young Lord Roger Mortimer: Who with the Barons rose; but wanting Power, Was taken and imprisoned in the Tower. But by a sleepie Drinke which she prepar'd, And at a Banquet given to his Guard, He makes escape: to whom, to France she sends; Who thence to her his Service recommends. Though such sweet comfort comes not now from her, As Englands Queene hath sent to Mortimer: Yet what that wants (may it my Power approve, If Lines can bring) this shall supply with Love. Me thinkes Affliction should not fright me so, Nor should resume those sundry shapes of Woe; But when I faine would find the cause of this, Thy absence shewes me where my Error is. Oft when I thinke of thy departing hence, Sad Sorrow then possesseth ev'ry Sense: But finding thy deare Bloud preserv'd thereby, And in thy Life, my long-wish'd Libertie, With that sweet Thought, my selfe I onely please, Amidst my Griefe, which sometimes gives me ease; Thus doe extremest Ills a Joy possesse, And one Woe makes another Woe seeme lesse. That blessed Night, that mild-aspected Howre, Wherein thou mad'st escape out of the Towre, Shall consecrated evermore remaine; Some gentle Planet in that Houre did raigne; And shall be happie in the Birth of Men, Which was chiefe Lord of the Ascendent then. Mortimer being in the Tower, and ordayning a Feast in honour of his Birth-day, as he pretended, and inviting thereunto Sir Stephen Segrave, Constable of the Tower, with the rest of the Officers belonging to the same, he gave them a sleepie Drinke, provided him by the Queene, by which meanes he got libertie for his Escape.O how I fear'd, that sleepie Juyce I sent, Might yet want power to further thine Intent! Or that some unseene Mysterie might lurke, Which wanting order, kindly should not worke: Oft did I wish those dreadfull poys'ned Lees, Which clos'd the ever-waking Dragons Eyes; Or I had had those Sense-bereaving Stalkes, That grow in shadie Proserpin's darke Walkes; Or those blacke Weeds on Lethe Bankes below, Or Lunarie, that doth on Latmus flow. Oft did I feare this moist and foggie Clime, Or that the Earth, wax'd barren now with time, Should not have Herbes to helpe me in this case, Such as doe thrive on India's parched Face. That Morrow, when the blessed Sunne did rise, And shut the Lids of all Heavens lesser Eyes, Forth from my Palace, by a secret Stayre, Mortimer being got out of the Tower, swam the River of Thames, into Kent; whereof she having intelligence, doubteth of his strength to escape, by reason of his long imprisonment, being almost the space of three yeeres.I stole to Thames, as though to take the Ayre; And ask'd the gentle Floud, as it doth glide, If thou didst passe or perish by the Tide? If thou didst perish, I desire the Streame, To lay thee softly on his Silver Teame, And bring thee to me, to the quiet Shore, That with his Teares thou might'st have some Teares more. When suddenly doth rise a rougher Gale: With that (me thinkes) the troubled Waves looke pale, And sighing with that little Gust that blowes, With this remembrance seeme to knit their Browes. Even as this sudden Passion doth affright me, The chearefull Sunne breakes from a Cloud to light me: Then doth the Bottome evident appeare, As it would shew me, that thou wast not there; When as the Water flowing where I stand, Doth seeme to tell me, thou art safe on Land. Edward Carnarvon, the first Prince of Wales of the English Bloud, married Isabel, Daughter of Philip the Faire, at Bulloine, in the presence of the Kings of Almaine, Navarre, and Cicill, with the chiefe Nobilitie of France and England: Which Marriage was there solemnized with exceeding Pompe and Magnificence.Did Bulloyne once a Festivall prepare, For England, Almaine, Cicill, and Navarre? When France envi'd those Buildings (onely blest) Grac'd with the Orgies of my Bridall Feast, That English Edward should refuse my Bed, For that lascivious shamelesse Ganimed? Noting the effeminacie and luxurious wantonnesse of Gaveston, the Kings Minion; his Behaviour and Attire ever so Woman-like, to please the Eye of his lascivious Master.And in my place, upon his Regall Throne, To set that Girle-Boy, wanton Gaveston. Betwixt the feature of my Face and his, My Glasse assures me no such difference is, It was urged by the Queene and the Nobilitie, in the disgrace of Pierce Gaveston, that his Mother was convicted of Witch-craft, and burned for the same, and that Pierce had bewitched the King.That a foule Witches Bastard should thereby Be thought more worthie of his Love then I. What doth availe us to be Princes Heires, When we can boast, our Birth is onely theirs? When base dissembling Flatterers shall deceive us Of all that our great Ancestors did leave us: A Complaint of the Prodigalitie of King Edward, giving unto Gaveston the Jewels and Treasure which was left him by the ancient Kings of England, and enriching him with the goodly Mannor of Wallingford, assigned as parcell of the Dower to the Queenes of this famous Ile.And of our Princely Jewels and our Dowres, Let us enjoy the least of what is ours; When Minions Heads must weare our Monarchs Crownes, To rayse up Dunghils with our famous Townes; Those Beggers-Brats, wrapt in our rich Perfumes, Their Buzzard-wings, imp'd with our Eagles Plumes; Edward the second gave to Pierce Gaveston in Marriage the Daughter of Gilbert Clare, Earle of Glocester, begot of the Kings sister, Jone of Acres, married to the said Earle of Glocester.And match'd with the brave Issue of our Blood, Ally the Kingdome to their cravand Brood? Did Longshanks purchase with his conqu'ring Hand, Albania, Scotland, so called of Albanact, the second sonne of Brutus; and Cambria, Wales, so called of Camber the third sonne. The foure Realmes and Countries brought in subjection by Edward Longshankes. Albania, Gascoyne, Cambria, Ireland? That young Carnarvan (his unhappie Sonne) King Edward offered his Right in France to Charles his Brother in Law, and his Right in Scotland to Robert Bruse, to be ayded against the Barons in the Quarrell of Pierce Gaveston.Should give away all that his Father wonne, To backe a Stranger, proudly bearing downe The brave Allies and Branches of the Crowne? Edward Longshankes on his Death-bed at Carlile, commanded young Edward his sonne, on his Blessing, not to call backe Gaveston, which (for the misguiding of the Princes Youth) was before banished by the whole Councell of the Land.And did great Edward on his Death-bed give This Charge to them which afterwards should live, That, that proud Gascoyne banished the Land, No more should tread upon the English Sand? And have these great Lords in the Quarrell stood, And seal'd his last Will with their dearest Blood? Thomas, Earle of Lancaster, Guy, Earle of Warwicke, and Henry, Earle of Lincolne, who had taken their Oathes before the deceased King at his Death, to withstand his sonne Edward, if he should call Gaveston from exile, being a thing which he much feared, now seeing Edward to violate his Fathers Commandement, rise in Armes against the King, which was the cause of the Civill Warre, and the ruine of so many Princes.That after all this fearefull Massacre, The Fall of Beauchamp, Lacy, Lancaster, Another faithlesse Favourite should arise, To cloud the Sunne of our Nobilities? The two Hugh Spensers, the Father and the Sonne, after the Death of Gaveston, became the great Favourites of the King, the Sonne being created by him Lord Chamberlaine, and the Father Earle of Winchester.And gloried I in Gavestons great Fall, That now a Spenser should succeed in all? And that his Ashes should another breed, Which in his Place and Empire should succeed; That wanting One, a Kingdomes Wealth to spend, Of what that left, this now shall make an end; To waste all that our Father wonne before, Nor leave our Sonne a Sword, to conquer more? Thus but in vaine we fondly doe resist, “Where Power can doe (ev'n) all things as it list, “And of our Right, with Tyrants to debate, “Lendeth them meanes to weaken our Estate. Whilst Parlaments must remedie their Wrongs, And we must wait for what to us belongs; Our Wealth but Fuell to their fond Excesse, And all our Fasts must feast their Wantonnesse. Think'st thou our Wrongs then insufficient are, To move our Brother to religious Warre? Edward Longshankes did homage for those Cities and Territories, to the French King; which Edward the second neglecting, moved the French King, by the subornation of Mortimer, to seize those Countries into his hands.And if they were, yet Edward doth detaine Homage for Pontiu, Guyne, and Aquitaine: And if not that, yet hath he broke the Truce; Thus all accurre, to put backe all excuse. The Sisters Wrong, joyn'd with the Brothers Right, Me thinkes, might urge him in this cause to fight. Be all those People senselesse of our Harmes, Which for our Countrey oft have manag'd Armes? Is the brave Normans Courage quite forgot? Have the bold Britans lost the use of Shot? The big-bon'd Almans, and stout Brabanders, Their Warlike Pikes, and sharpe-edg'd Semiters? Or doe the Pickards let their Crosse-bowes lie, Once like the Centaur's of old Thessalie? Or if a valiant Leader be their lacke, Where Thou art present, who should beat them backe? I doe conjure Thee, by what is most deare, By that great Name of famous Mortimer, Wigmore, in the Marches of Wales, was the ancient House of the Mortimers, that Noble and Couragious Family.By ancient Wigmores honourable Crest, The Tombes where all thy famous Grandsires rest; Or if then these, what more may Thee approve, Ev'n by those Vowes of thy unfained Love; In all thou canst to stirre the Christian King, By forraine Armes some Comfort yet to bring, To curbe the Power of Traytors that rebell, Against the Right of Princely Isabel. Vaine witlesse Woman, why should I desire To adde more heat to thy Immortall fire? To urge thee by the violence of Hate, To shake the pillars of thine owne Estate, When whatsoever we intend to doe, Our most Misfortune ever sorteth too; And nothing else remaynes for us beside, But Teares and Coffins (onely) to provide? The Queene remembreth the great Overthrow given to the Barons by Andrew Herckley, Earle of Carlil, at Burrough Bridge, after the Battell at Burton.When still, so long as Burrough beares that name, Time shall not blot out our deserved shame; And whilst cleare Trent her wonted course shall keepe, For our sad Fall she evermore shall weepe. All see our Ruine on our Backes is throwne, And we too weake to beare it out, are growne. This was Adam Torlton, Bishop of Hereford, that great Politician, who so highly favoured the Faction of the Queene and Mortimer; whose evill counsell afterward wrought the destruction of the King. Torlton, that should our Businesse direct, The generall Foe doth vehemently suspect: “For dangerous Things get hardly to their End, “Whereon so many watchfully attend. What should I say? My Griefes doe still renew, And but begin, when I should bid Adiew. Few be my Words, but manifold my Woe, And still I stay, the more I strive to goe. Then till faire Time some greater Good affords, Take my Loves-payment in these ayrie Words. MORTIMER TO QUEENE ISABEL. As thy Salutes my Sorrowes doe adjourne, So backe to thee their int'rest I returne; Though not in so great Bountie (I confesse) As thy Heroicke Princely Lines expresse: For how should Comfort issue from the Breath Roger Mortimer, Lord of Wigmore, had stood publikely condemned, for his Insurrection with Thomas Earle of Lancaster, and Bohune Earle of Hereford, by the space of three Moneths: and as the report went, the day of his Execution was determined to have beene shortly, which he prevented by his escape.Of one condemn'd, and long lodg'd up for Death? From Murthers Rage thou didst me once reprive; Now in Exile, my Hopes thou do'st revive: At what time the two Mortimers, this Roger Lord of Wigmore, and his uncle Roger Mortimer the elder, were apprehended in the West, the Queene, by meanes of Torlton, Bishop of Hereford, and Becke, Bishop of Duresme, and Patriarke of Jerusalem, being then both mightie in the State, upon the submission of the Mortimers, somewhat pacified the King, and now secondly shee wrought meanes for his escape.Twice all was taken, twice thou all didst give, And thus twice dead, thou mak'st me twice to live: This double life of mine, your onely due, You gave to me; I give it backe to you. Ne'r my Escape had I adventur'd thus, As did the Skie-attempting Dedalus; And yet to give more safetie to my flight, Did make a Night of Day, a Day of Night: Nor had I backt the proud aspiring Wall, Which held without my Hopes, within my Fall, With strong Ladders made of Cords, provided him for the purpose, he escaped out of the Tower; which when the same were found fastened to the Walls, in such a desperate Attempt, they bred astonishment in the Beholders.Leaving the Cords to tell where I had gone, For gazers with much feare to looke upon; But that thy Beautie (by a power divine) Breath'd a new Life into this Spirit of mine, Drawne by the Sunne of thy celestiall Eyes, With fierie Wings, which bare me through the Skies. The Heav'ns did seeme the charge of me to take, And Sea and Land befriend me for thy sake; Thames stop'd his Tide, to make me way to goe, As thou hadst charg'd him that it should be so: The hollow murm'ring Winds their due time kept, As they had rock'd the World, while all things slept; One Billow bare me, and another drave me, This strove to helpe me, and that strove to save me; The brisling Reeds mov'd with soft Gales, did chide me, As they would tell me, that they meant to hide me: The pale-fac'd Night beheld thy heavie cheare, And would not let one little Starre appeare, But over all, her smoakie Mantle hurl'd, And in thicke Vapours muffled up the World; And the sad Ayre became so calme and still, As it had beene obedient to my will; And every thing dispos'd it to my Rest, As on the Seas when t'Halcion builds her Nest. When those rough Waves, which late with Furie rush'd, Slide smoothly on, and suddenly are hush'd; Nor Neptune lets his Surges out so long, As Nature is in bringing forth her Yong. The two Hugh Spensers, the Father and the Sonne, then being so highly favoured of the King, knew that their greatest safetie came by his Exile, whose high and turbulent Spirit could never brooke any Corrivall in Greatnesse.Ne'r let the Spensers glorie in my Chance, In that I live an Exile here in France; That I from England banished should be, But England rather banished from me: More were her want, France our great Bloud should beare, Then Englands losse can be to Mortimer. Roger Mortimer, called the great Lord Mortimer, Grandfather to this Roger, which was afterward the first Earle of March, erected againe the Round Table at Kenelworth, after the ancient Order of King Arthurs Table, with the Retinue of an hundred Knights, and an hundred Ladies in his House, for the entertaining of such Adventurers as came thither from all parts of Christendome.My Grandsire was the first, since Arthurs raigne, That the Round-Table rectified againe: To whose great Court at Kenelworth did come, The peerelesse Knighthood of all Christendome; Whose Princely Order honour'd England more, Then all the Conquests she atchiev'd before. Never durst Scot set foot on English Ground, Nor on his Backe did English beare a Wound, Whilst Wigmore flourish'd in our Princely Hopes, And whilst our Ensignes march'd with Edwards Troopes: Edward Longshankes willed at his Death, that his Bodie should be boyled, the Flesh from the Bones, and that the Bones should be borne to the Warres in Scotland, which he was perswaded unto by a Prophecie, which told, That the English should still be fortunate in Conquest, so long as his Bones were carried in the Field.Whilst famous Longshanks Bones (in Fortunes scorne) As sacred Reliques to the Field were borne: Nor ever did the valiant English doubt, Whilst our brave Battels guarded them about: Nor did our Wives and wofull Mothers mourne In the great Voyage Edward the second made against the Scots, at the Battell at Striveling, neere unto the River of Banocksburne in Scotland, there was in the English Campe such Banquetting and Excesse, such Riot and Misorder, that the Scots (who in the meane time laboured for Advantage) gave to the English a great Overthrow.The English Bloud that stayned Banocksbourne, Whilst with his Minions sporting in his Tent, Whole Dayes and Nights in Banquetting were spent, Untill the Scots (which under Safegard stood) Made lavish Havocke of the English Blood: Whose batt'red Helmes lay scatt'red on the Shore, Where they in Conquest had beene borne before. A thousand Kingdomes will we seeke from farre, As many Nations waste with Civill Warre, Where the dishevel'd gastly Sea-Nymph sings, Or well-rig'd Ships shall stretch their swelling Wings, And drag their Anchors through the sandie Fome, About the World in ev'ry Clime to rome, And those unchrist'ned Countries call our owne, Where scarce the Name of England hath been knowne: Mortimer, so called of Mare Mortuum, and in French, Mortimer, in English, the Dead-Sea, which is said to be where Sodome and Gomorrha once were, before they were destroyed with fire from Heaven.And in the dead Sea sinke our Houses Fame, From whose vaste Depth we first deriv'd our Name; Before foule blacke-mouth'd Infamie shall sing, That Mortimer ere stoop'd unto a King. And we will turne sterne-visag'd Furie backe, To seeke his Spoyle, who sought our utter Sacke; And come to beard him in our Native Ile, Ere he march forth to follow our Exile: And after all these boyst'rous stormie Shockes, Yet will we grapple with the chaulkie Rockes. Nor will we steale like Pyrats, or like Theeves, From Mountaines, Forrests, or Sea-bord'ring Cleeves; But fright the Ayre with Terror (when we come) Of the sterne Trumpet, and the bellowing Drum: And in the Field advance our plumie Crest, And march upon faire Englands flowrie Brest. And Thames, which once we for our Life did swim, Shaking our dewie Tresses on his Brim, Shall beare my Navie; vaunting in her pride, Falling from Tanet with the pow'rfull Tide: Which fertile Essex, and faire Kent shall see, Spreading her Flags along the pleasant Lee, When on her stemming Poope she proudly beares The famous Ensignes of the Belgicke Peeres. Gaustellinus and Lucas, two Cardinals, sent into England from Pope Clement, to appease the ancient Hate betweene the King and Thomas Earle of Lancaster; to whose Embassie the King seemed to yeeld, but after their departure he went backe from his Promises, for the which he was accursed at Rome.And for that hatefull Sacrilegious sinne, Which by the Pope he stands accursed in, The Canon Text shall have a common Glosse, Receits in Parcels, shall be paid in Grosse: This Doctrine preach'd, Who from the Church doth take, At least shall treble Restitution make. For which, Rome sends her Curses out from farre, Through the sterne Throat of Terror-breathing Warre; Till to th'unpeopled Shores she brings Supplies, A Colonie is a sort or number of People, that come to inhabite a Place before not inhabited; whereby he seemes here to prophesie of the subversion of the Land, the Pope joyning with the Power of other Princes against Edward, for the breach of his Promise.Of those industrious Roman Colonies. And for his Homage, by the which of old, Proud Edward Guyne and Aquitaine doth hold, Charles the French King, moved by the Wrong done unto his Sister, seizeth the Provinces which belonged to the King of England into his hands, stirred the rather thereto by Mortimer, who sollicited her cause in France, as is expressed before in the other Epistle, in the Glosse upon this Point. Charles by invasive Armes againe shall take, And send the English Forces o'r the Lake. When Edwards Fortune stands upon this Chance, To lose in England, or to forfait France; And all those Townes great Longshanks left his Sonne, Now lost, which once he fortunately wonne, Within their strong Port-culliz'd Ports shall lye, And from their Walls his Sieges shall defie: And by that firme and undissolved Knot, Betwixt their neighb'ring French, and bord'ring Scot, Bruse shall bring on his Red-shanks from the Seas, From th'Iled Orcads, and the Eubides, And to his Westerne Havens give free passe, To land the Kerne and Irish Galiglasse, Marching from Tweed to swelling Humber Sands, Wasting along the Northerne Nether-Lands. And wanting those which should his Power sustaine, Consum'd with Slaughter in his Bloudie Raigne, Our Warlike Sword shall drive him from his Throne, Where he shall lye for us to tread upon. After the death of Thomas Earle of Lancaster at Pomfret, the People imagined great Miracles to be done by his Reliques; as they did of the Body of Bohune, Earle of Hereford, slaine at Burrough Bridge.And those great Lords, now after their Attaints, Canonized amongst the English Saints, And by the superstitious People thought, That by their Reliques, Miracles are wrought: And thinke that Floud much vertue doth retaine, Which tooke the Bloud of famous Bohun slaine; Continuing the remembrance of the thing, Shall make the People more abhorre their King. Nor shall a Spenser (be he ne'r so great) Possesse our Wigmore, our renowmed Seat, To raze the ancient Trophies of our Race, With our deserts their Monuments to grace: Nor shall he lead our valiant Marchers forth, To make the Spensers famous in the North; Nor be the Guardants of the British Pales, Defending England, and preserving Wales. At first our Troubles easily recul'd, But now growne head-strong, hardly to be rul'd; “Deliberate counsell needs us to direct, “Where not (ev'n) plainnesse frees us from suspect: By those Mishaps our Errors that attend, Let us our Faults ingenuously amend. Then (Deare) represse all peremptorie Spleene, Be more then Woman, as you are a Queene: Smother those Sparkes, which quickly else would burne, Till time produce what now it doth adjourne. Till when, great Queene, I leave you (though a while) Live you in rest, nor pittie my Exile. FINIS. EDWARD THE BLACK PRINCE TO ALICE COUNTESSE OF SALISBURIE. The Argument. Count Salsbury, a grave and prudent Lord, Dispatch'd for France, was scarsely gone aboord, But the Scots hearing that he was away, Besieg'd the Castle where his Ladie lay. Edward the Blacke Prince, with an Armie sent T'remove the Foe, beholding from his Tent Her walking on the Battlement above, With the faire Countesse strangely falls in love. Her Noble Husband not long after dy'd; When he, who thought he should not be deny'd, Courts her by Letters, and thus writeth to her; She in her Answer, checks him so to woo her. Receive these Papers from thy wofull Lord, Bandello, by whom this Historie was made famous, being an Italian, as it is the Peoples custome in that Clime, rather to faile sometime in the truth of Circumstance, then to forgoe the grace of their Conceit: in like manner as the Grecians; of whom the Satyrist, Et quicquid Græcia mendax Audet in Historia. Thinking it to be a greater Triall, that a Countesse should be sued unto by a King, then by the sonne of a King; and consequently, that the honour of her Chastitie should be the more, hath caused it to be generally taken so: but as by Polydore, Fabian, and Froisard appeares, the contrarie is true. Yet may Bandello be very well excused, as being a stranger, whose errors in the truth of our Historie, are not so materiall, that they should need an Invective, lest his Wit should be defrauded of any part of his due, which were not lesse, were every part a Fiction. Howbeit, lest a common error should prevaile against a truth, these Epistles are conceived in those Persons, who were indeed the Actors: To wit, Edward, sirnamed the Blacke Prince, not so much of his Complexion, as of the dismall Battels which he fought in France, (in like Sense as we may say, A blacke Day, for some Tragicall event, though the Sunne shine never so bright therein.) And Alice the Countesse of Salisburie, who, as it is certaine, was beloved of Prince Edward, so it is as certaine, that many Points now currant in the received Storie, can never hold together with likelyhood of such inforcement, had it not beene shaded under the Title of a King. With farre more Woes then they with Words are stor'd, Which if thine Eye for rashnesse doe reprove, They'le say they came from that imperious Love. In ev'ry Line well may'st thou understand, Which Love hath sign'd and sealed with his Hand; And where to farther processe he referres, In Blots set downe to thee for Characters. This cannot blush, although you doe refuse it, Nor will reply, how-ever you shall use it; All's one to this, though you should bid Despaire, This still entreats you, this still speakes you faire. Hast thou a living Soule, a humane Sense, To like, dislike, prove, order, and dispence? The depth of Reason, soundly to advise, To love things good, things hurtfull to despise? The touch of Judgement, which should all things prove, Hast thou all this, yet not allow'st my Love? Sound moves a Sound, Voyce doth beget a Voyce, One Eccho makes another to rejoyce; One well-tun'd String set truely to the like, Strucke neere at hand, doth make another strike. How comes it then, that our Affections jarre? What Opposition doth beget this Warre? I know, that Nature frankely to thee gave That measure of her Bountie that I have; And as to me, she likewise to thee lent, For ev'ry Sense a severall Instrument: But ev'ry one, because it is thine owne, Doth prize it selfe, unto it selfe alone. Thy daintie Hand, when it it selfe doth touch, That feeling tells it, that there is none such: When in thy Glasse thine Eye it selfe doth see, That thinkes there's none like to it selfe can bee; And ev'ry one doth judge it selfe divine, Because that thou do'st challenge it for thine: And each it selfe Narcissus-like doth smother, Loving it selfe, nor cares for any other. Fie, be not burn'd thus in thine owne desire, 'Tis needlesse, Beautie should it selfe admire: “The Sunne, by which all Creatures light'ned be, “And seeth all, it selfe yet cannot see; “And his owne brightnesse his owne foile is made, “And is to us the cause of his own shade. When first thy Beautie by mine Eye was prov'd, It saw not then so much to be belov'd; But when it came a perfect view to take, Each Looke of one, doth many Beauties make: In little Circlets first it doth arise, Then somewhat larger seeming in mine Eyes; And in this gyring Compasse as it goes, So more and more the same in Greatnesse growes; And as it yet at libertie is let, The Motion still doth other Formes beget; Untill at length, looke any way I could, Nothing there was but Beautie to behold. Art thou offended, that thou art belov'd? Remove the cause, th'effect is soone remov'd; Indent with Beautie how farre to extend, Set downe Desire a Limit where to end; Then charme thine Eyes, that they no more may wound, And limit Love to keepe within a Bound. If thou doe this, nay then thou shalt doe more, And bring to passe what never was before; Make Anguish sportive, craving all Delight, Mirth solemne, sullen, and inclin'd to Night, Ambition lowly, Envie speaking well, Love, his Reliefe, for Niggardize to sell. Our Warlike Fathers did these Forts devise, As surest Holds against our Enemies, Places wherein your Sex might safelyest rest. “Feare soone is settled in a Womans Brest: Thy Brest is of another temper farre, And then thy Castle fitter for the Warre; Thou do'st not safely in thy Castle rest, Thy Castle should be safer in thy Brest: That keepes out Foes, but doth thy Friends inclose, But thy Brest keepes out both thy Friends and Foes: That may be batter'd, or be undermin'd, Or by straight siege, for want of succour pin'd; But thy Heart is invicible to all, And more obdurate then thy Castle Wall. Of all the shapes that ever Jove did prove, Wherewith he us'd to entertaine his Love, That likes me best, when in a golden Showre, He rain'd himselfe on Danae in her Towre; Nor did I ever envie his Command, In that he beares the Thunder in his Hand: But in that showrie shape I cannot bee, And as he came to her, I come to thee. Thy Tower with Foes is not begirt about, If thou within, they are besieg'd without; One Haire of thine, more vigour doth retaine, To bind thy Foe, then any yron Chayne: Who might be gyv'd in such a golden String, Would not be captive, though he were a King. Hadst thou all India heap'd up in thy Fort, And thou thy selfe besieged in that sort, Get thou but out, where they can thee espie, They'le follow thee, and let the Treasure lie. I cannot thinke what force thy Tower should win, If thou thy selfe do'st guard the same within; Thine Eye retaines Artillerie at will, To kill who-ever thou desir'st to kill; For that alone more deepely wounds Mens Hearts, Then they can thee, though with a thousand Darts; For there intrenched, little Cupid lyes, And from those Turrets all the World defies: Not that the Lid is transparent; for no part of the Skin is transparent: but for that the Gemme which that Closure is said to containe, is transparent: for otherwise, how could the Mind understand by the Eye? Should not the Images slide thorow the same, and replenish the Stage of the Phantasie? But this belongs to Opticks. The Latines call the Eye-lid Cilium (I will not say of Celando) as the Eye-brow Supercilium, and the Haire on the Eye-lids Palpebra, perhaps quôd Palpitet, all which have their distinct and necessarie uses.And when thou let'st downe that transparent Lid, Of Entrance, there an Armie doth forbid. And as for Famine, thou need'st never feare; Who thinks of Want, when thou art present there? Thy onely sight puts Spirit into the Blood, And comforts Life, without the taste of Food. And as thy Souldiers keepe their Watch and Ward, Thy Chastitie thy inward Brest doth guard: Thy modest Pulse serves as a Larum Bell, Which watched by some wakefull Sentinell, Is stirring still with every little Feare, Warning, if any Enemie be neare. Thy vertuous Thoughts, when all the others rest, Like carefull Skowts passe up and downe thy Brest, And still they Round about that place doe keepe, Whilst all the blessed Garrison doe sleepe. But yet I feare, if that the truth were told, That thou hast rob'd, and fly'st into this Hold: I thought as much, and didst this Fort devise, That thou in safetie here might'st tyrannize. Yes, thou hast rob'd the Heaven and Earth of all, And they against thy lawlesse Theft doe call. Thine Eyes, with mine that wage continuall Warres, Borrow their brightnesse of the twinckling Starres: Thy Lips, from mine that in thy Maske be pent, Have filch'd the Blushing from the Orient: Thy Cheeke, for which mine all this Penance proves, Steales the pure whitenesse both from Swans and Doves: Thy Breath, for which, mine still in Sighes consumes, Hath rob'd all Flowers, all Odours, and Perfumes. O mightie Love! bring hither all thy Power, And fetch this heavenly Theefe out of her Tower; For if she may be suff'red in this sort, Heavens store will soone be hoarded in this Fort. When I arriv'd before that State of Love, And saw thee on that Battlement above, I thought there was no other Heaven but there, And thou an Angell, didst from thence appeare: But when my Reason did reprove mine Eye, That thou wert subject to Mortalitie, I then excus'd what erst the Scot had done; No marvell though he would the Fort have wonne, Perceiving well, those envious Walls did hide More wealth then was in all the World beside: Against thy Foe, I came to lend thee ayd, And thus to thee, my selfe I have betray'd. He is besieg'd, the Siege that came to rayse, There's no Assault that not my Brest assayes. “Love growne extreme, doth find unlawfull Shifts, “The Gods take shapes, and doe allure with Gifts: “Commanding Jove, that by great Styx doth sweare, “Forsworne in love, with Lovers Oathes doth beare; “Love causelesse still, doth aggravate his cause, “It is his Law, to violate all Lawes; “His Reason is, in onely wanting Reason, “And were untrue, not deepely touch'd with Treason; “Unlawfull Meanes, doth make his lawfull Gaine, “He speakes most true, when he the most doth faine. Pardon the Faults that have escap'd by Mee, Against faire Vertue, Chastitie, and Thee: “If Gods can their owne Excellence excell, “It is in pardoning Mortals, that rebell. When all thy Trials are enroll'd by Fame, And all thy Sex made glorious by thy Name, Then I a Captive shall be brought hereby, T'adorne the Triumph of thy Chastitie. I sue not now thy Paramour to bee, But as a Husband to be link'd to thee: I am Englands Heire, I thinke thou wilt confesse, Wert thou a Prince, I hope I am no lesse; But that thy Birth doth make thy Stocke divine, Else durst I boast my Bloud as good as thine: Disdaine me not, nor take my Love in scorne, Whose Brow a Crowne hereafter may adorne. But what I am, I call mine owne no more, Take what thou wilt, and what thou wilt, restore; Onely I crave, what e'r I did intend, In faithfull Love all happily may end. Farewell, sweet Lady, so well may'st thou fare, To equall Joy with measure of my Care: Thy Vertues more then mortall Tongue can tell; A thousand-thousand times farewell, farewell. ALICE COUNTESSE OF SALISBURIE TO THE BLACKE PRINCE. As one that fayne would graunt, yet fayne deny, 'Twixt Hope and Feare I doubtfully reply, A Womans Weakenesse, lest I should discover, Answering a Prince, and writing to a Lover: And some say, Love with Reason doth dispence, And wrests our plaine words to another sense. Thinke you not then, poore Women had not need Be well advis'd, to write what Men should read; When being silent, but to move awry, Doth often bring us into obloquie? “Whilst in our Hearts our secret Thoughts abide, “Th'invenom'd Tongue of Slander yet is ty'd; “But if once spoke, deliver'd up to Fame, “In her Report that often is too blame. About to write, but newly entring in, Me thinkes I end, ere I can well begin: When I would end, then something makes me stay, For then me thinkes I should have more to say, And some one thing remayneth in my Brest, For want of Words that cannot be exprest: What I would say, as said to thee, I faine, Then in thy Person I reply againe; And in thy Cause urge all that may effect, Then, what againe mine Honour must respect. O Lord! what sundry Passions doe I try, To set that right, which is so much awry? Being a Prince, I blame you not to prove, The greater reason to obtaine your Love. That Greatnesse which doth challenge no denyall, The onely Test that doth allow my tryall; Edward so great, the greater were his fall, And my Offence in this were capitall. “To Men is graunted priviledge to tempt, “But in that Charter, Women be exempt: “Men win us not, except we give consent, “Against our selves unlesse that we be bent. “Who doth impute it as a Fault to you? “You prove not false, except we be untrue; “It is your Vertue, being Men, to trie, “And it is ours, by Vertue to denie. “Your Fault it selfe serves for the Faults excuse, “And makes it ours, though yours be the abuse. “Beautie a Beggar, fie it is too bad, “When in it selfe sufficiencie is had; “Not made a Lure, t'intice the wand'ring Eye, “But an Attyre, t'adorne our Modestie: “If Modestie and Women once doe sever, “We may bid farewell to our Fame for ever. Let John and Henry, Edwards instance be, Matilda and faire Rosamond for me; Alike both woo'd, alike su'd to be wonne, Th'one by the Father, th'other by the Sonne: Henry obtayning, did our Weakenesse wound, And layes the fault on wanton Rosamond; Matilda chaste, in life and death all one, By her denyall layes the fault on John: “By these, we prove Men accessarie still, “But Women onely Principals of Ill. “What Prayse is ours, but what our Vertues get? “If they be lent, so much we be in debt; “Whilst our owne Honors we our selves defend, “All force too weake, what ever Men pretend: “If all the World else should suborne our fame, “'Tis we ourselves that overthrow the same; “And howsoe'r, although by force you winne, “Yet on our Weakenesse still returnes the sinne. A vertuous Prince, who doth not Edward call? And shall I then be guiltie of your Fall? Now God forbid; yet rather let me die, Then such a Sinne upon my Soule should lie. Where is great Edward? Whither is he led, At whose victorious Name whole Armies fled? Is that brave Spirit, that conquer'd so in France, Thus overcome, and vanquish'd with a Glance? Is that great Heart, that did aspire so hie, So soone trans-pierced with a Womans Eye? He that a King at Poictiers Battell tooke, Himselfe led captive with a wanton Looke? The two Husbands of which she makes mention, objecting Bigamie against her selfe, as being therefore not meet to be married with a Batcheler-Prince, were Sir Thomas Holland, Knight, and Sir William Mountague, afterward made Earle of Salisburie.Twice as a Bride to Church I have beene led, Twice have two Lords enjoy'd my Bridall Bed: How can that Beautie yet be undestroy'd, That yeeres have wasted, and two Men enjoy'd? Or should be thought fit for a Princes store, Of which, two Subjects were possest before? Let Spaine, let France, or Scotland so preferre Their Infant Queenes, for Englands Dowager; That Bloud should be much more then halfe divine, That should be equall ev'ry way with thine: Yet Princely Edward, though I thus reprove you, As mine owne life, so dearely doe I love you. My noble Husband, which so loved you, That gentle Lord, that reverend Mountague, Ne'r Mothers voyce did please her Babe so well, As his did mine, of you to heare him tell: I have made short the Houres, that Time made long, And chayn'd mine Eares to his most pleasing Tongue; My Lips have waited on your Prayses worth, And snatcht his words, ere he could get them forth: When he had spoke, and something by the way Hath broke off that he was about to say; I kept in mind where from his Tale he fell, Calling on him the residue to tell. Oft he would say, How sweet a Prince is hee! When I have prays'd him but for praysing thee; And to proceed, I would intreat and woo, And yet to ease him, helpe to prayse thee too. And must she now exclayme against the wrong Offred by him, whom she hath lov'd so long? Nay, I will tell, and I durst almost sweare, Edward will blush, when he his Fault shall heare. Judge now, that Time doth Youths desire asswage, And Reason mildly quench the fire of Rage; By upright Justice let my cause be try'd, And be thou Judge, if I not justly chide. A thing incredible, that any Prince should be so unjust, to use the Fathers meanes for the corruption of the Daughters Chastitie, though so the Historie importeth; her Father being so honourable, and a Man of so singular desert: though Polydore would have her thought to be Jane, the Daughter to Edmund, Earle of Kent, uncle to Edward the third, beheaded in the Protectorship of Mortimer, that dangerous Aspirer.That not my Fathers grave and reverend yeeres, When on his Knee he beg'd me with his Teares, By no perswasions possibly could winne, To free himselfe, from prompting me to sinne; The Woe for me my Mother did abide, Whose sute (but you) there's none could have deny'd, Your lustfull Rage, your Tyrannie could stay, Mine Honours Ruine further to delay. Have I not lov'd you? let the Truth be showne, That still preserv'd your Honour with mine owne. Had your fond Will your foule Desires prevail'd, When you by them my Chastitie assail'd; (Though this no way could have excus'd my Fault, “True Vertue never yeelded to Assault:) Besides the Ill of you that had beene said, My Parents sinne had to your charge beene laid; Roxborough is a Castle in the North, mis-termed by Bandello, Salisburie Castle, because the King had given it to the Earle of Salisburie: in which, her Lord being absent, the Countesse by the Scots was besieged; who, by the comming of the English Armie, were removed. Here first the Prince saw her, whose Libertie had beene gained by her shame, had she beene drawne by dishonest Love to satisfie his Appetite: but by her most prayse-worthie Constancie, shee converted that humour in him to an Honourable purpose, and obtained the true reward of her admired Vertues.And I have gain'd my Libertie with shame, To save my Life, made shipwracke of my Name. Did Roxborough once vayle her tow'ring Fanes To thy brave Ensignes, on the Northerne Plaines? And to thy Trumpets, sounding from thy Tent, Mine oft againe thee heartie Welcome sent, And did receive thee as my Soveraigne Liege, Comming to ayd me, thus me to besiege, To rayse a Foe, that but for Treasure came, To plant a Foe, to take my honest Name; Under pretence to have remov'd the Scot, And would'st have wonne more then he could have got; That did ingirt me, readie still to flie, But thou layd'st Batt'rie to my Chastitie: O Modestie, didst thou me not restraine, How could I chide you in this angrie vaine! A Princes Name (Heav'n knowes) I doe not crave, To have those Honours Edwards Spouse should have, Nor by Ambitions Lures will I be brought, In my chaste Brest to harbour such a Thought, As to be worthie to be made a Bride, A Piece unfit for Princely Edwards side; Of all, the most unworthie of that grace, To wait on her that should injoy that place. But if that Love, Prince Edward doth require, Equall his Vertues, and my chaste desire; If it be such as we may justly vaunt, A Prince may sue for, and a Lady graunt; If it be such as may suppresse my Wrong, That from your vaine unbridled Youth hath sprong; That Faith I send, which I from you receive: Lest any thing be left out which were worth the Relation, it shall not be impertinent, to annex the Opinions that are uttered concerning her, whose Name is said to have beene Ælips: but that being rejected, as a Name unknowne among us, Froisard is rather beleeved, who calleth her Alice. Polydore contrariwise, as before is declared, names her Jane, who by Prince Edward had Issue, Edward dying young, and Richard the Second, King of England, though (as hee sayth) shee was divorced afterwards, because within the degrees of Consanguinitie, prohibiting to marrie: The truth whereof, I omit to discusse. Her Husband, the Lord Mountague, being sent over into Flanders by King Edward, was taken Prisoner by the French; and not returning, left his Countesse a Widdow: in whose Bed, succeeded Prince Edward; to whose last and lawfull Request, the rejoycefull Ladie sends this loving Answere.The rest unto your Princely Thoughts I leave. FINIS. QUEENE ISABEL TO RICHARD THE SECOND. The Argument. Richard the Second wrongfully depos'd By Henry Duke of Harford, and inclos'd In Pomfret Castle; Isabel the Queene, To the neglected King, who having seene His dis-investing, and disastrous Chance, To Charles her Father ship'd againe for France, (Where, for her Husband griev'd and discontent) Thence this Epistle to King Richard sent; By which, when he her Sorrow doth descry, He to the same as sadly doth reply. As doth the yeerely Augure of the Spring, In depth of Woe, thus I my Sorrow sing; My Tunes with Sighes yet ever mixt among, A dolefull Burthen to a heavie Song: Words issue forth, to find my Griefe some way, Teares overtake them, and doe bid them stay; Thus whilst one strives to keepe the other backe, Both once too forward, soone are both too slacke. Pomfret Castle, ever a fatall place to the Princes of England, and most ominous to the Bloud of Plantaginet.If fatall Pomfret hath in former time Nourish'd the Griefe of that unnaturall Clime, Thither I send my Sorrowes to be fed; Then where first borne, where fitter to be bred? They unto France be Aliens, and unknowne, England from her doth challenge these her owne. They say, all Mischiefe commeth from the North; It is too true, my Fall doth set it forth: But why should I thus limit Griefe a place, When all the World is fill'd with our Disgrace? And we in bonds thus striving to containe it, The more resists, the more we doe restraine it. When Bullenbrooke returned to London from the West, bringing Richard a Prisoner with him; the Queene, who little knew of her Husbands hard Successe, stayed to behold his comming in, little thinking to have seene her Husband thus led in Triumph by his Foe: and now seeming to hate her Eyes, that so much had graced her mortall Enemie.Oh, how even yet I hate these wretched Eyes, And in my Glasse oft call them faithlesse Spyes! (Prepar'd for Richard) that unwares did looke Upon that Traytor Henry Bullenbrooke: But that excesse of Joy my Sense bereav'd So much, my Sight had never beene deceiv'd. Oh, how unlike to my lov'd Lord was hee, Whom rashly I (sweet Richard) tooke for thee! I might have seene, the Coursers selfe did lacke That Princely Rider, to bestrid his Backe; He that since Nature her great Worke began, She onely made the Mirrour of a Man, That when she meant to forme some matchlesse Lim, Still for a Patterne tooke some part of him; And jealous of her Cunning, brake the Mould, When she in him had done the best she could. Oh, let that Day be guiltie of all sinne, That is to come, or heretofore hath beene, She remembreth the meeting of the two Dukes of Harford and Norfolke at Coventry, urging the justnesse of Mowbrayes Quarrell against the Duke of Harford, and the faithfull assurance of his Victorie.Wherein great Norfolk's forward Course was stay'd, To prove the Treasons he to Harford layd, When (with sterne Furie) both these Dukes enrag'd, Their Warlike Gloves at Coventrie engag'd, When first thou didst repeale thy former Grant, Seal'd to brave Mowbray as thy Combattant: From his unnumbred Houres let Time divide it, Lest in his Minutes he should hap to hide it; Yet on his Brow continually to beare it, That when it comes, all other Houres may feare it; And all ill-boding Planets, by consent, In it may hold their dreadfull Parlament: Be it in Heav'ns Decrees enrolled thus, Blacke, dismall, fatall, inauspitious. Proud Harford then, in height of all his pride, Under great Mowbray's valiant Hand had di'de, And never had from Banishment retir'd; The fatall Brand wherewith our Troy was fir'd. Charles the French King, her Father, received the Duke of Harford in his Court, and relieved him in France, being so neerely allyed as Cousin German to King Richard, his sonne in Law; which he did simply, little thinking, that he should after returne into England, and dis-possesse King Richard of the Crowne.Oh, why did Charles relieve his needie state! A Vagabond and straggling Runnagate? And in his Court, with grace did entertaine That vagrant Exile, that vile bloudie Cain; Who with a thousand Mothers Curses went, Mark'd with the Brand of ten yeeres Banishment. King Richard made a Voyage with his Armie into Ireland, against Onell and Mackmur, which rebelled: at what time, Henry entred here at home, and robbed him of all Kingly Dignitie.When thou to Ireland took'st thy last Farewell, Millions of Knees upon the Pavements fell, And ev'ry where th'applauding Ecchoes ring The joyfull showts that did salute a King. Thy parting hence, the Pompe that did adorne, Was vanish'd quite when as thou didst returne? Who to my Lord one Looke vouchsaf'd to lend? Then, all too few on Harford to attend. “Princes (like Sunnes) be evermore in sight, “All see the Clouds, betwixt them and their Light: “Yet they which lighten all downe from their Skies, “See not the Clouds offending others Eyes, “And deeme, their Noone-tide is desir'd of all, “When all expect cleere Changes by their Fall. What colour seemes to shaddow Harfords clayme, When Law and Right his Fathers Hopes doe mayme? William Wickham, in the great Quarrell betwixt John of Gaunt and the Clergie, of meere Spight and Malice (as it should seeme) reported, That the Queene confessed to him on her Death-bed, being then her Confessor, That John of Gaunt was the sonne of a Flemming, and that she was brought to Bed of a Woman-Child at Gaunt, which was smothered in the Cradle by mischance, and that she obtained this Child of a poore Woman, making the King beleeve it was her owne, greatly fearing his displeasure. Fox. ex Chron. Alban.Affirm'd by Church-men (which should beare no Hate) That John of Gaunt was illegitimate; Whom his reputed Mothers Tongue did spot, By a base Flemmish Boore to be begot; Whom Edwards Eaglets mortally did shun, Daring with them to gaze against the Sunne: Where lawfull Right and Conquest doth allow A triple Crowne on Richards Princely Brow; Three Kingly Lyons beares his Bloudie Field, Shewing the true and indubitate Birth of Richard, his Right unto the Crowne of England, as carrying the Armes without Blot or Difference.No Bastards Marke doth blot his conqu'ring Shield: Never durst he attempt our haplesse Shore, Nor set his foot on fatall Ravenspore; Nor durst his slugging Hulks approach the Strand, Nor stoope a Top as signall to the land, Had not the Percyes promis'd ayde to bring, Against their oath unto their lawfull King, Edmund Mortimer, Earle of March, sonne of Earle Roger Mortimer, which was sonne to Lady Philip, daughter to Lionel, Duke of Clarence, the third sonne to King Edward the third; which Edmund (King Richard going into Ireland) was proclaymed Heire Apparant to the Crowne; whose Aunt, called Ellinor, this Lord Percy had married.Against their Faith unto our Crownes true Heire, Their valiant Kinsman Edmund Mortimer. When I to England came, a World of eyes, Like Starres attended on my faire arise, Which now (alas) like angry Planets frowne, And are all set, before my going downe; The smooth-fac'd Ayre did on my comming smile, But I with Stormes am driven to exile: But Bullenbrooke devis'd we thus should part, Fearing two Sorrowes should possesse one Heart, To adde to our affliction, to denie That one poore Comfort, left our Miserie. He had before divorc'd thy Crowne and thee, Which might suffice, and not to Widdow mee; But so to prove the utmost of his hate, To part us in this miserable state. The Abbot of Westminster had plotted the Death of King Henry, to have beene done at a Tilt at Oxford: Of which Confederacie, there was John Holland, Duke of Excester, Thomas Holland, Duke of Surrey, the Duke of Aumerle, Mountacute, Earle of Salisburie, Spenser, Earle of Glocester, the Bishop of Carlile, Sir Thomas Blunt; these all had bound themselves one to another by Indenture to performe it, but were all betrayed by the Duke of Aumerle.Oh, would Aumerle had sunke, when he betray'd The Plot, which once that noble Abbot layd; When he infring'd the Oath which he first tooke, For thy Revenge on perjur'd Bullenbrooke; And beene the ransome of our Friends deare Blood, Untimely lost, and for the Earth too good; And we untimely doe bewayle their state, They gone too soone, and we remaine too late. And though with Teares I from my Lord depart, This Curse on Harford fall, to ease my Heart: If the foule breach of a chaste Nuptiall Bed May bring a Curse, my Curse light on his Head; If Murthers guilt with Bloud may deepely staine, Henry going towards the Castle of Flint, where King Richard was, caused Scroope, Greene, and Bushy to be executed at Bristow, as vile persons, which had seduced the King to this lascivious and wicked life. Greene, Scroope, &amp; Bushy dye his fault in graine; If Perjurie may Heavens pure Gates debarre, After Henries exile, at his returne into England, he tooke his Oath at Doncaster, upon the Sacrament, not to clayme the Crowne, or Kingdome of England, but onely the Dukedome of Lancaster, his owne proper Right, and the Right of his Wife.Damn'd be the Oath he made at Doncaster; If the deposing of a lawfull King, Thy Curse condemne him, if no other thing; If these dis-joyn'd, for Vengeance cannot call, Let them united, strongly curse him all. And for the Percyes, Heav'n may heare my Prayre, That Bullenbrook, now plac'd in Richards Chayre, Such cause of Woe to their proud Wives may be, As those rebellious Lords have beene to me. And that coy Dame, which now controlleth all, And in her Pompe triumpheth in my Fall, For her great Lord may water her sad Eyne With as salt Teares, as I have done for mine. This was the brave couragious Henry Hotspur, that obtayned so manie Victories against the Scots; which, after falling out right with the Curse of Queene Isabel, was slaine by Henry at the Battell at Shrewsburie.And mourne for Henry Hotspur, her deare Sonne, As I for my deare Mortimer have done; And as I am, so succourlesse be sent, Lastly, to taste perpetuall Banishment. Then lose thy Care, when first thy Crowne was lost, Sell it so dearely, for it dearely cost: And sith it did of Libertie deprive thee, Burying thy Hope, let nothing else out-live thee. But hard (God knowes) with Sorrow doth it goe, When Woe becomes a comforter to Woe: Yet much (me thinkes) of Comfort I could say, If from my Heart some Feares were rid away; Something there is, that danger still doth show, But what it is, that Heaven alone doth know: “Griefe to it selfe most dreadfull doth appeare, “And never yet was Sorrow void of feare; But yet in Death doth Sorrow hope the best, And Richard, thus I wish thee happie Rest. RICHARD THE SECOND TO QUEENE ISABEL. What can my Queene but hope for from this Hand, That it should write, which never could command? A Kingdomes Greatnesse thinke how he should sway, That wholesome Counsell never could obay: Ill this rude Hand did guide a Scepter then, Worse now (I feare me) it will rule a Pen. How shall I call my selfe, or by what Name, To make thee know from whence these Letters came? Not from thy Husband, for my hatefull Life Makes thee a Widdow, being yet a Wife: Nor from a King; that Title I have lost, Now of that Name, proud Bullenbrooke may boast: What I have beene, doth but this comfort bring, No words so wofull, as, I was a King. This lawlesse Life, which first procur'd my Hate, Richard the Second, at the Resignation of the Crowne to the Duke of Harford, in the Tower of London, delivering the same with his owne hand, there confessed his disabilitie to governe, utterly denouncing all Kingly Authoritie.This Tongue, which then renounc'd my Regall State, This abject Soule of mine consenting to it, This Hand, that was the Instrument to doe it; All these be witnesse, that I now denie All Princely Types, all Kingly Sov'raigntie. Didst thou for my sake leave thy Fathers Court, Thy famous Countrey, and thy Princely Port, And undertook'st to travell dang'rous Wayes, Driven by aukward Winds and boyst'rous Seas? Before the Princesse Isabel was married to the King, Lewes Duke of Burbon sued to have had her in Marriage; which was thought he had obtained, if this Motion had not fallen out in the meane time. This Duke of Burbon sued againe to have received her, at her comming into France, after the imprisonment of King Richard; but King Charles her Father then crossed him, as before, and gave her to Charles, sonne to the Duke of Orleans.And left'st great Burbon, for thy love to mee, Who su'd in Marriage to be link'd to thee, Offring for Dower the Countries neighb'ring nie, Of fruitfull Almaine, and rich Burgundie? Didst thou all this, that England should receive thee, To miserable Banishment to leave thee? And in my Downe-fall, and my Fortunes wracke, Thus to thy Countrey to convey thee backe? When quiet Sleepe (the heavie Hearts Reliefe) Hath rested Sorrow, somewhat less'ned Griefe, My passed Greatnesse into mind I call, And thinke this while I dreamed of my Fall: With this Conceit my Sorrowes I beguile, That my faire Queene is but withdrawne a while, And my Attendants in some Chamber by, As in the height of my Prosperitie. Calling aloud, and asking who is there? The Eccho answ'ring, tels me, Woe is there; And when mine Armes would gladly thee enfold, I clip the Pillow, and the place is cold: Which when my waking Eyes precisely view, 'Tis a true token, that it is too true. As many Minutes as in the Houres there be, So many Houres each Minute seemes to me; Each Houre a Day, Morne, Noone-tide, and a Set, Each Day a Yeere, with Miseries complete; A Winter, Spring-time, Summer, and a Fall, All Seasons varying, but unseasoned all: In endlesse Woe my thred of Life thus weares, In Minutes, Houres, Dayes, by Months, to lingring Yeares. They prayse the Summer, that enjoy the South; Pomfret is closed in the Norths cold Mouth: There pleasant Summer dwelleth all the Yeere, Frost-starved-Winter doth inhabit here; A place wherein Despaire may fitly dwell, Sorrow best suting with a cloudie Cell. When the Combate should have beene at Coventry, betwixt Henry Duke of Harford, and Thomas Duke of Norfolke (where Harford was adjudged to Banishment for ten yeeres) the Commons exceedingly lamented; so greatly was he ever favoured of the People.When Harford had his Judgement of Exile, Saw I the Peoples murmuring the while; Th'uncertaine Commons touch'd with inward Care, As though his Sorrowes mutually they bare: Fond Women, and scarse-speaking Children mourne, Bewayle his parting, wishing his returne. When the Duke came to take his leave of the King, being then at Eltham, the King, to please the Commons, rather then for any love he bare to Harford, repealed foure yeeres of his Banishment.That I was forc'd t'abridge his banish'd Yeares, When they bedew'd his Foot-steps with their Teares; Yet by example could not learne to know, To what his Greatnesse by their love might grow: Henry, the eldest sonne of John, Duke of Lancaster, at the first, Earle of Darby, then created Duke of Harford; after the death of the Duke John, his father, was Duke of Lancaster and Harford, Earle of Darby, Leicester, and Lincolne: and after he had obtained the Crowne, was called by the name of Bullenbrooke, which is a Towne in Lincolneshire; as usually all the Kings of England bare the name of the Place where they were borne.But Henry boasts of our Atchievements done, Bearing the Trophies our great Fathers wonne; And all the storie of our famous Warre, Must grace the Annals of Great Lancaster. Edward the third had seven sonnes; Edward, Prince of Wales, after called the Blacke-Prince; William of Hatfield, the second; Lionel, Duke of Clarence, the third; John of Gaunt, Duke of Lancaster, the fourth; Edmund of Langley, Duke of Yorke, the fifth; Thomas of Woodstocke, Duke of Glocester, the sixt; William of Windsore, the seventh.Seven goodly Siens in their Spring did flourish, Which one selfe-Root brought forth, one Stock did nourish; Truely boasting himselfe to be the eldest sonne of Edward, the Blacke-Prince. Edward the top-Branch of that golden Tree, Nature in him her utmost power did see; Who from the Bud still blossomed so faire, As all might judge what Fruit it meant to beare: But I his Graft, of ev'ry Weed o'r-growne, And from our kind, as Refuse forth am throwne. As disabling Henry Bullenbrooke, being but the sonne of the fourth brother; William and Lionel being both before John of Gaunt.We from our Grandsire stood in one Degree, But after Edward, John the yong'st of three. Might Princely Wales beget a Sonne so base, (That to Gaunts Issue should give Soveraigne place?) Edward the Blacke-Prince taking John, King of France, Prisoner, at the Battell of Poicters, brought him into England; where, at the Savoy, he died.He that from France brought John his Prisoner home, As those great Cæsars did their Spoyles to Rome, Called the Blacke-Prince, not so much of his Complexion, as of the famous Battels he fought; as is shewed before, in the Glosse upon the Epistle of Edward to the Countesse of Salisburie.Whose Name obtained by his fatall Hand, Was ever fearefull to that conquer'd Land: His Fame encreasing, purchas'd in those Warres, Can scarcely now be bounded with the Starres; With him is Valour from the base World fled, (Or here in me is it extinguished) Who for his Vertue, and his Conquests sake, Posteritie a Demy-god shall make; And judge, this vile and abject Spirit of mine, Could not proceed from temper so divine. What Earthly Humour, or what vulgar Eye Can looke so low, as on our Miserie? When Bullenbrooke is mounted to our Throne, And makes that his, which we but call'd our owne: Into our Councels he himselfe intrudes, And who but Henry with the Multitudes? His Power disgrades, his dreadfull Frowne disgraceth, He throwes them downe, whom our Advancement placeth; As my disable and unworthie Hand Never had Power, belonging to Command. He treads our sacred Tables in the dust, In the next Parliament, after Richards Resignation of the Crowne, Henry caused to be annihilated all the Lawes made in the Parliament, called the Wicked Parliament, held in the twentieth yeere of King Richards Reigne.And proves our Acts of Parlament unjust; As though he hated, that it should be said, That such a Law by Richard once was made; Whilst I deprest before his Greatnesse, lie Under the weight of Hate and Infamie. My Backe a Foot-stoole Bullenbrooke to rayse, My Loosenesse mock'd, and hatefull by his prayse, Out-live mine Honour, burie my Estate, And leave my selfe nought, but my Peoples Hate. (Sweet Queene) Ile take all Counsell thou canst give, So that thou bidst me neyther hope nor live; “Succour that comes, when Ill hath done his worst, “But sharpens Griefe, to make us more accurst. Comfort is now unpleasing to mine Eare, Past cure, past care, my Bed become my Beere: Since now Misfortune humbleth us so long, Till Heaven be growne unmindfull of our Wrong; Yet it forbid my Wrongs should ever die, But still remembred to Posteritie: And let the Crowne be fatall that he weares, And ever wet with wofull Mothers Teares. Thy Curse on Percie, angry Heavens prevent, Who have not one Curse left, on him unspent, To scourge the World, now borrowing of my store, As rich of Woe, as I a King am poore. Then cease (deare Queene) my Sorrowes to bewayle, My Wound's too great for Pitie now to heale; Age stealeth on, whilst thou complaynest thus, My Griefes be mortall and infectious: Yet better Fortunes thy faire Youth may trie, That follow thee, which still from me doth flie. FINIS. QUEENE KATHERINE TO OWEN TUDOR. The Argument. Henry the fifth, that onely Man of Men, Too soone deceased; bright Queene Katherine then, (Henry the sixt her sonne of tender yeeres, Fortune so strangely her Affection steeres, That amongst many, call'd one day to dance Before the King and her) this Heire of France, And Englands Dowager; her Eye taken had, By Owen Tudor, a brave youthfull Lad, One of her Ward-robe, and from Wales descended: She, the great good that was to him intended, To let him know, this Letter doth devise, Lest that the greatnesse of the enterprise Should hap to daunt him; but he bold by kind, Shew'd her, his love was answ'ring to her mind. Judge not a Princesse worth impeach'd hereby, That Love thus triumphs over Majestie; Nor thinke lesse Vertue in this Royall Hand, That it intreats, and wonted to command: For in this sort, though humbly now it woo, The day hath beene, thou would'st have kneel'd unto. Nor thinke, that this submission of my State Proceeds from Frailtie (rather judge it Fate.) Alcides ne'r more fit for Warres sterne Shocke, Then when with Women spinning at the Rocke; Never lesse Clouds did Phœbus glory dim, Then in a Clownes shape when he covered him: Joves great Command was never more obay'd, Then when a Satyres Anticke parts he play'd. He was thy King, who su'd for love to mee, And she his Queene, who sues for love to thee. When Henry was, my love was onely his, But by his death, it Owen Tudors is; My love to Owen, him my Henry giveth, My love to Henry, in my Owen liveth: Henry woo'd me, whilst Warres did yet increase, I woo my Tudor, in sweet calmes of Peace; To force Affection, he did Conquest prove, I come with gentle Arguments of Love. Neere unto Melans, upon the River of Seyne, was the appointed place of Parley betweene the two Kings of England and France; to which place, Isabel, the Queene of France, and the Duke of Burgoyne, brought the young Princesse Katherine, where King Henry first saw her.Incamp'd at Melans, in Warres hot Alarmes, First saw I Henry, clad in Princely Armes; At pleasant Windsore, first these Eyes of mine My Tudor judg'd, for wit and shape divine; Henry abroad, with Puissance and with Force, Tudor at home, with Courtship and Discourse: He then, thou now, I hardly can judge whether Did like me best, Plantaginet, or Tether; A March, a Measure, Battell, or a Daunce, A Courtly Rapier, or a conqu'ring Launce. His Princely Bed hath strength'ned my Renowne, Henry the fift, and Queene Katherine, were taken as King and Queene of France; and during the life of Charles the French King, Henry was called King of England, and Heire of France: and after the death of Henry the fift, Henry the sixt, his sonne, then being very young, was crowned at Paris, as true and lawfull King of England and France.And on my Temples set a double Crowne; Which glorious Wreathe (as Henries lawfull Heire) Henry the sixt upon his Brow doth beare. Troy in Champaine, was the place where that victorious King Henry the fift married the Princesse Katherine, in the presence of the chiefe Nobilitie of the Realmes of England and France.At Troy in Champaine he did first injoy My Bridall Rites, to England brought from Troy; In England now that Honour thou shalt have, Which once in Champaine famous Henry gave. I seeke not Wealth, three Kingdomes in my Power; If these suffice not, where shall be my Dower? Sad Discontent may ever follow her, Which doth base Pelfe before true Love preferre; If Titles still could our Affections tye, What is so great, but Majestie might buy? As I seeke thee, so Kings doe me desire; To what they would, thou eas'ly may'st aspire. That sacred Fire once warm'd my Heart before, The Fuell fit, the Flame is now the more; And meanes to quench it, I in vaine doe prove, “We may hide Treasure, but not hide our Love: And since it is thy fortune (thus) to gaine it, It were too late, nor will I now restraine it. Few Queenes of England, or France, were ever more Princely allied then this Queene, as it hath beene noted by Historiographers.Nor these great Titles vainely will I bring, Wife, Daughter, Mother, Sister to a King, Of Grandsire, Father, Husband, Sonne, and Brother, More thou alone to me then all these other. Noting the Descent of Henry her Husband from John, Duke of Lancaster, the fourth sonne of Edward the third; which Duke John was sirnamed Gaunt, of the Citie of Gaunt in Flanders, where he was borne.Nor feare, my Tudor, that this love of mine Should wrong the Gaunt-borne, great Lancastrian Line, Alluding the Greatnesse of the English Line, to Phœbus and Phœbe, fained to be the Children of Latona, whose Heavenly kind might scorne to be joyned with any Earthly Progenie: yet withall, boasting the Bloud of France, as not inferiour to theirs. And with this Allusion, followeth on the Historie of the strife betwixt Juno and the Race of Cadmus, whose Issue was afflicted by the Wrath of Heaven. The Children of Niobe slaine; for which, the wofull Mother became a Rocke, gushing forth continually a Fountaine of Teares.Or make the English Bloud, the Sunne and Moone, Repine at Loraine, Burbon, Alanson; Nor doe I thinke there is such different ods, They should alone be numbred with the Gods: Of Cadmus Earthly Issue reck'ning us, And they from Jove, Mars, Neptune, Eolus; Of great Latona's Off-spring onely they, And we the Brats of wofull Niobe. Our famous Grandsires (as their owne) bestrid That Horse of Fame, that God-begotten Steed; Whose bounding Hoofe plow'd that Beotian Spring, Where those sweet Maids of Memorie doe sing. I clayme not all from Henry, but as well To be the Child of Charles and Isabel: Nor can I thinke from whence their Griefe should grow, That by this Match they be disparag'd so; Lhewellin, or Leolin ap Iorwith, married Joan, daughter to King John, a most beautifull Lady. Some Authors affirme, that she was base borne. Lhewellin ap Gryfith married Elinor, daughter to Simon Monfort, Earle of Leicester, and Cousin to Edward Longshankes; both which Lhewellins, were Princes of Wales.When John and Longshanks Issue were affy'd, And to the Kings of Wales in Wedlocke ty'd, Shewing the greatnesse of your Bloud thereby, Your Race and Royall Consanguinitie: And Wales, as well as haughtie England boasts, Camilot the ancient Palace of King Arthur; to which place, all the Knights of that famous Order yeerely repaired at Pentecost, according to the Law of the Table: and most of the famous home-borne Knights were of that Countrey; as to this day is perceived by their ancient Monuments.Of Camilot, and all her Pentecosts; To have precedence in Pendragons Race, At Arthurs Table challenging the Place. If by the often Conquest of your Land, They boast the Spoyles of their victorious Hand; If these our ancient Chronicles be true, They altogether are not free from you. Noting the ill successe which William Rufus had in two Voyages he made into Wales; in which, a number of his chiefe Nobilitie were slaine.When bloudie Rufus sought your utter sacke, Twice entring Wales, yet twice was beaten backe; When famous Cambria wash'd her in the Floud, Made by th'effusion of the English Bloud; Noting the divers sundry Incursions that the Welshmen made into England, in the time of Rufus, John, Henry the second, and Longshankes.And oft return'd with glorious Victorie, From Worcester, Her'ford, Chester, Shrewsburie; Whose Power in ev'ry Conquest so prevayles, As once expuls'd the English out of Wales. Although my Beautie made my Countries Peace, And at my Bridall former Broyles did cease; More then his Power, had not his Person beene, I had not come to England as a Queene. Nor tooke I Henry to supply my want, Because in France that time my choyse was scant, When it had rob'd all Christendome of Men, And Englands Flower remayn'd amongst us then: Gloster, whose Counsels (Nestor-like) assist; Couragious Bedford, that great Martiallist; Clarence, for Vertue honour'd of his Foes; And Yorke, whose Fame yet dayly greater growes; Warwicke, the pride of Nevils haughtie Race; Great Salisburie, so fear'd in ev'ry place: That valiant Poole, whom no Atchievement dar's; And Vere, so famous in the Irish Warres; Who, though my selfe so great a Prince were borne, The worst of these, my equall need not scorne: But Henries rare Perfections, and his Parts, As conqu'ring Kingdomes, so he conquer'd Hearts. As chaste was I to him, as Queene might bee, But freed from him, my chaste love vow'd to thee; Beautie doth fetch all Favour from thy Face, All perfect Court-ship resteth in thy Grace: If thou discourse, thy Lips such Accents breake, As Love a Spirit forth of thee seem'd to speake. The British Language, which our Vowels wants, And jarres so much upon harsh Consonants, Comes with such grace from thy mellifluous Tongue, As doe the sweet Notes of a well-set Song, And runs as smoothly from those Lips of thine, As the pure Tuskan from the Florentine; Leaving such seasoned sweetnesse in the Eare, That the Voyce past, yet still the Sound is there: In Nisus Tower, as when Apollo lay, And on his golden Violl us'd to play; Where senselesse Stones were with such Musicke drown'd, As many yeeres they did retaine the Sound. Let not the Beames, that Greatnesse doth reflect, Amaze thy Hopes with timerous respect; Assure thee, Tudor, Majestie can bee As kind in love, as can the mean'st degree, And the imbraces of a Queene as true As theirs, which thinke them much advanc'd by you; When in our Greatnesse, our Affections crave Those secret Joyes, that other Women have: So I (a Queene) be soveraigne in my choyse, Let others fawne upon the publique voyce; Or what (by this) can ever hap to thee, Light in respect, to be belov'd of mee? Let peevish Worldlings prate of Right and Wrong, Leave Plaints and Pleas, to whom they doe belong, Let old Men speake of Chances and Events, And Lawyers talke of Titles and Descents, Leave fond Reports to such as Stories tell, And Covenants, to those that buy and sell: Love, my sweet Tudor, that becomes thee best; And to our good successe referre the rest. OWEN TUDOR TO QUEENE KATHERINE. When first mine Eyes beheld your Princely Name, And found from whence this friendly Letter came; As in excesse of Joy, I had forgot, Whether I saw it, or I saw it not: My panting Heart doth bid mine Eyes proceed, My dazeled Eyes invite my Tongue to read; Which wanting their direction, dully mist it: My Lips, which should have spoke, were dumbe, and kist it, And left the Paper in my trembling Hand, When all my Senses did amazed stand; Even as a Mother comming to her Child, Which from her presence hath beene long exil'd, With gentle Armes his tender Necke doth straine, Now kissing it, now clipping it againe; And yet excessive Joy deludes her so, As still she doubts, if this be hers, or no. At length awakened from this pleasing Dreame, When Passion somewhat left to be extreme, My longing Eyes with their faire Object meet, Where ev'ry Letter's pleasing, each Word sweet. It was not Henries Conquests, nor his Court, That had the power to win me by report; Nor was his dreadfull Terror-striking Name, The cause that I from Wales to England came; For Christian Rhodes, and our Religions Truth, To great Atchievement first had wonne my Youth: This brave Adventure did my Valour prove, Before I e'r knew what it was to love. Nor came I hither by some poore event, But by th'eternall Destinies consent; Whose uncomprised Wisedome did fore-see, That you in Marriage should be link'd to mee. By our great Merlin was it not fore-told, (Amongst his holy Prophesies enrol'd) When first he did of Tudors Name divine, That Kings and Queenes should follow in our Line; The Armes of Tudor, was three Helmets; whereof he speaketh, as a thing prophetically fore-told of Merlin.And that the Helme (the Tudors ancient Crest) Should with the golden Flower-de-luce be drest; As that the Leeke (our Countries chiefe Renowne) Should grow with Roses in the English Crowne. As Charles his Daughter, you the Lilly weare, As Henries Queene, the blushing Rose you beare; By France's Conquest, and by Englands Oath, You are the true made Dowager of both; Both in your Crowne, both in your Cheeke together, Joyne Tethers love to yours, and yours to Tether. Then cast no future Doubts, nor feare no Hate, When it so long hath beene fore-told by Fate; And by the all-disposing doome of Heav'n, Before our Births, we to one Bed were giv'n. No Pallas here, nor Juno is at all, When I to Venus yeeld the golden Ball; Nor when the Grecians Wonder I enjoy, None in revenge to kindle fire in Troy: And have not strange events divin'd to us, That in our love we should be prosperous? Owen Tudor, being a Courtly and active Gentleman, commanded once to dance before the Queene, in a Turne (not being able to recover himselfe) fell into her Lap, as she sat upon a little Stoole, with many of her Ladies about her.When in your presence I was call'd to dance, In loftie Tricks whilst I my selfe advance, And in a Turne, my footing fayl'd by hap, Was't not my chance to light into your Lap? Who would not judge it Fortunes greatest grace, Sith he must fall, to fall in such a place? His Birth from Heav'n, your Tudor not derives, Nor stands on tip-toes in Superlatives, Although the envious English doe devise A thousand Jests of our Hyperbolies; Nor doe I clayme that Plot by ancient Deeds, Where Phœbus pastures his fire-breathing Steeds; Nor doe I boast my God-made Grandsires Scarres, Nor Gyants Trophies in the Titans Warres; Nor faine my Birth (your Princely Eares to please) By three Nights getting, as was Hercules; Nor doe I forge my long Descent to runne From aged Neptune, or the glorious Sunne: This Berdh, as they call it in the British Tongue, or as we more properly say, Bard, or Bardus, be their Poets, which keepe the Records of Pedigrees and Descents, and sung in Odes and Measures to their Harpes, after the old manner of the Lyricke Poets.And yet in Wales, with them that famous bee, Our learned Bards doe sing my Pedigree; Cadwallader, the last King of the Britaines, descended of the Noble and ancient Race of the Trojans; to whom an Angell appeared, commanding him to goe to Rome to Pope Sergius, where he ended his life.And boast my Birth from great Cadwallader, Caer-Septon, now called Shaftsburie; at whose Building it was said, an Eagle prophesied (or rather, one named Aquila) of the fame of that Place, and of the recoverie of the Ile by the Britaines, bringing backe with them the Bones of Cadwallader from Rome.From old Caer-Septon, in Mount Palador; This Eneon was slaine by the Rebels of Gwentland; he was a notable and worthie Gentleman, who in his life did many noble Acts, and was father to Theodor, or Tudor Maur, of whom descended the Princes of South-Wales.And from Eneons Line, the South-Wales King, By Theodor, the Tudors Name doe bring. My Royall Mothers Princely Stocke began, Gwenellian, the daughter of Rees ap Griffeth ap Theodor, Prince of South-Wales, married Ednivet Vaughan, ancestor to Owen Tudor.From her great Grandam, faire Gwenellian; This is the Lewhelin, called Leolinus Magnus, Prince of North-Wales.By true descent from Leolin the Great, As well from North-Wales, as faire Powslands Seat: Though for our Princely Genealogie, I doe not stand to make Apologie; Yet who with Judgements true impartiall Eyes, Shall looke from whence our Name at first did rise, Shall finde, that Fortune is to us in debt; And why not Tudor, as Plantaginet? In the Voyage that Henry the second made against the Welshmen, as his Souldiers passed Offas Ditch at Croggen Castle, they were overthrowne by the Welshmen: Which word Croggen hath since beene used to the Welshmens Disgrace, which was at first begun with their Honour.Nor that terme Croggen, Nick-name of disgrace, Us'd as a by-word now in ev'ry place, Shall blot our Bloud, or wrong a Welshmans Name, Which was at first begot with Englands shame. Our valiant Swords our Right did still maintaine, Against that cruell, proud, usurping Dane, Buckling besides in many dang'rous Fights, With Norwayes, Swethens, and with Muscovites; The Welshmen be those ancient Britaines, which when the Picts, Danes, and Saxons invaded here, were first driven into those parts; where they have kept their Language ever since the first, without commixtion with any other.And kept our Native Language now thus long, And to this day yet never chang'd our Tongue: When they which now our Nation faine would tame, Subdu'd, have lost their Countrey, and their Name. Nor ever could the Saxons Swords provoke Our Britaine Necks to beare their servile Yoke: Where Cambria's pleasant Countries bounded bee With swelling Severne, and the holy Dee; And since great Brutus first arriv'd, have stood, The onely remnant of the Trojan Blood. To every Man is not allotted Chance, To boast with Henry, to have conquer'd France: Yet if my Fortunes be thus rays'd by thee, This may presage a further good to me; And our Saint David, in the Britaines Right, May joyne with George, the Sainted English Knight; Caer-Merdin, or Merlins Towne, so called, of Merlins being found there. This was Ambrose Merlin, whose Prophesies we have. There was another of that Name, called Merlin Sylvestris, borne in Scotland, sirnamed Calidonius, of the Forrest Calidon, where he prophesied.And old Caer-marden, Merlins famous Towne, Not scorn'd by London, though of such renowne. Ah, would to God, that Houre my Hopes attend, Were with my Wish brought to desired end! Blame me not, Madame, though I thus desire, Many there be, that after you inquire; Till now your Beautie in Nights Bosome slept, What Eye durst stirre, where awfull Henry kept? Who durst attempt to sayle but neere the Bay, Where that all-conqu'ring great Alcides lay? Your Beautie now is set a Royall Prize, And Kings repayre to cheapen Merchandize. If you but walke to take the breathing Ayre, Orithia makes me, that I Boreas feare; If to the Fire, Jove once in Lightning came, And faire Egina makes me feare the flame; If in the Sunne, then sad Suspition dreames Phœbus should spread Lucothoe in his Beames; If in a Fountaine you doe coole your Bloud, Neptune I feare, which once came in a Floud; If with your Mayds, I dread Apollo's Rape, Who cous'ned Chion in an old Wives shape; If you doe banquet, Bacchus makes me dreed, Who in a Grape Erigone did feed; And if my selfe your Chamber-doore should keepe, Yet feare I Hermes, comming in a Sleepe. Pardon (sweet Queene) if I offend in this, In these Delayes, Love most impatient is; And Youth wants pow'r his hot Spleene to suppresse, When Hope alreadie banquets in Excesse. Though Henries Fame in me you shall not find, Yet that which better shall content your mind; But onely in the Title of a King Was his advantage, in no other thing: If in his love more pleasure you did take, Never let Queene trust Britan, for my sake. Yet judge me not from Modestie exempt, That I another Phaetons Charge attempt; My Mind, that thus your Favours dare aspire, Shewes, that 'tis touch'd with a celestiall fire; If I doe fault, the more is Beauties blame, When she her selfe is author of the same: “All Men to some one qualitie incline, Onely to Love is naturally mine. Thou art by Beautie famous, as by Birth, Ordain'd by Heav'n to cheere the drouping Earth; Adde faithfull Love unto your greater State, And be alike in all things fortunate. A King might promise more, I not deny, But yet (by Heav'n) he lov'd not more then I. And thus I leave, till time my Faith approve, I cease to write, but never cease to love. FINIS. ELINOR COBHAM TO DUKE HUMPHREY. The Argument. Wise Humphrey, Duke of Gloster, nam'd the Good, Next to his Nephew, of the Royall Blood, (Henry the sixt then being very yong) Chosen Protector: by Ambition strong Whose Duchesse Elinor, violently led, To thinke the Crowne theirs, were yong Henry dead, Convicted was, with Sorcerers to conspire, Which practised to hasten her desire: For which, she her thrice-Penance was assign'd; To th'Ile of Man and afterwards confin'd: From whence, she writes this Letter to her Lord, Who that sad Lady doth the like afford. Me thinks, not knowing who these Lines should send, Thou straight turn'st over to the latter end; Where, thou my Name no sooner hast espy'd, But in disdaine my Letter casts aside: Why, if thou wilt, I will my selfe deny, Nay, I'le affirme and sweare, I am not I; Or if in that thy shame thou do'st perceive, Lo, for thy deare sake, I my Name will leave. And yet, me thinkes, amaz'd thou shouldst not stand, Nor seeme so much appalled at my Hand; For my Misfortunes have inur'd thine Eye, (Long before this) to Sights of Miserie: No, no, reade on, 'tis I, the very same, All thou canst reade, is but to reade my shame. Be not dismay'd, nor let my Name affright, The worst it can, is but t'offend thy sight; It cannot wound, nor doe thee deadly harme, It is no dreadfull Spell, no Magick Charme; If she that sent it, love Duke Humphrey so, Is't possible her Name should be his Foe? Yes, I am El'nor, I am very shee, Who brought for Dower a Virgins Bed to thee; Noting the extreme Hate that Cardinall Beauford had ever borne to her.Though envious Beuford slander'd me before, To be Duke Humphreyes wanton Paramour. And though indeed I can it not deny, Elinor Cobham was accused by some, that sought to withstand, and misliked her Marriage with Duke Humphrey, that she practised to give him Philters, and such poysoning Potions, to make him love her; as she was slandered by Cardinall Beauford, to have lived as the Dukes Lemman: against the which Cardinall, she exclaymeth in this Epistle, in the Verse before.To Magick once I did my selfe apply; I wonne thee not, as there be many thinke, With poys'ning Philters, and bewitching Drinke; Nor on thy person did I ever prove Those wicked Potions, so procuring Love. I cannot boast, to be rich Hollands Heire, Nor of the Bloud and Greatnesse of Baveire; This was the chiefe and onely thing that ever touched the reputation of this good Duke, that dotingly he married Jacomin, or as some call her, Jaquet, Daughter and Heire to William Bavier, Duke of Holland, before married, and lawfull Wife to John, Duke of Brabant, then living: which after, as it is shewed in this Verse following,Yet El'nor brought no forraine Armies in, To fetch her backe, as did thy Jacomin; Nor clam'rous Husband follow'd me that fled, Exclayming, Humphrey to defile his Bed; Nor wast thou forc'd, the Slander to suppresse, To send me backe as an Adulteresse: Caused great Warres, by reason, that the Duke of Burgoyne tooke part with Brabant, against the Duke of Gloucester; which being arbitrated by the Pope, the Ladie was adjudged to be delivered backe to her former Husband. Brabant, nor Burgoyne, claymed me by force, Nor su'd to Rome, to hasten my Divorce; Nor Belgia's Pompe, defac'd with Belgia's fire, The just reward of her unjust desire: John, Duke of Bedford, that Scourge of France, and the Glorie of the Englishmen, married Anne, sister to the Duke of Burgundie, a vertuous and beautifull Ladie: by which Marriage, as also by his Victories attained in France, he brought great Strength to the English Nation.Nor Bedfords Spouse, your Noble Sister Anne, That Princely-issued great Burgonian, Need stand with me, to move a Womans strife, To yeeld the place to the Protectors Wife; If Cobhams Name my Birth can dignifie, Or Sterborough renowne my Family. That faire and goodly Palace of Greenwich, in Kent, was first builded by that famous Duke: Whose rich and pleasant situation might remaine an assured Monument of his Wisedome, if there were no other memorie of the same.Where's Greenwich now, thy El'nors Court of late, Where she with Humphrey held a Princely State? That pleasant Kent, when I abroad should ride, That to my pleasure laid forth all her pride? The Thames, by Water when I tooke the ayre, That danc'd my Barge, in lanching from the stayre? The anch'ring Ships, which when I pass'd the Road, Were wont to hang their chequ'red Tops abroad? How could it be, those that were wont to stand, To see my Pompe, so Goddesse-like to Land, Should after see me mayl'd up in a Sheet, Doe shamefull Penance three times in the Street? Rung with a Bell, a Taper in my Hand, Bare-foot to trudge before a Beadles Wand; That little Babes, not having use of Tongue, Stood pointing at me, as I came along. Where then was Humphrey, where was his Command? Wast thou not Lord Protector of the Land? Or for thy Justice, who could thee denie The Title of the good Duke Humphrey? What Bloud, extract from famous Edwards Line, Could boast it selfe to be so pure as thine? Who else, next Henry, should the Realme preferre, If it allow the Line of Lancaster? But Rayners Daughter must from France be fet, And with a vengeance on our Throne be set; Mauns, Maine, and Anjou, on that Begger cast, To bring her home to England in such haste: And what for Henry thou hadst laboured there, To joyne the King with Arminack's rich Heire, Must all be dash'd, as no such thing had beene. Poole needs must have his Darling made a Queene, How should he with our Princes else be plac'd, To have his Earleship with a Dukedome grac'd; And rayse the Off-spring of his Bloud so hie, As Lords of us and our Posteritie? O, that by Sea when he to France was sent, The Ship had sunke, wherein the Traytor went; Or that the Sands had swallow'd her, before She e'r set foot upon the English Shore! But all is well, nay, we have store to give, What need we more, we by her Lookes can live: All that great Henry by his Conquests heapt, And famous Bedford to his glorie kept, Is given backe to Rayner all in post; And by this meanes, rich Normandie is lost. Those which have come as Mistresses of ours, Have into England brought their goodly Dow'rs, Which to our Coffers yeerely Tribute brings, The Life of Subjects, and the strength of Kings; The meanes whereby faire England ever might Rayse Power in France, to backe her ancient Right: But she brings Ruine here to make aboad, And cancels all our lawfull Clayme abroad; And she must recapitulate my Shame, And give a thousand by-words to my Name, And call me, Beldam, Gib, Witch, Night-mare, Trot, With all despight that may a Woman spot. O, that I were a Witch but for her sake! Yfaith her Queeneship little Rest should take; I would scratch that Face, that may not feele the Ayre, And knit whole Ropes of Witch-knots in her Hayre: O, I would Hag her nightly in her Bed, And on her Brest sit like a lumpe of Lead, And like a Fairie pinch that daintie Skin, Her wanton Bloud is now so cocker'd in; Or take me some such knowne familiar shape, As she my Vengeance never should escape. Were I a Garment, none should need the more To sprinkle me with Nessus poys'ned Gore; It were ynough, if she once put me on, To teare both Flesh and Sinewes from the Bone: Were I a Flower, that might her Smell delight, Though I were not the poys'ning Aconite, I would send such a Fume into her Brow, Should make her mad, as mad as I am now. It should seeme, that there were two Ilands, both of them called Mona, though now distinguished, the one, by the Name of Man, the other, by the Name of Anglesey; both which, were full of many infernall Ceremonies: as may appeare by Agricolaes Voyage, made into the hithermost Man, described by his sonne in law, Cornelius Tacitus. And as Superstition, the Daughter of Barbarisme, and Ignorance; so, amongst those Northerly Nations, like as in America, Magicke was most esteemed. Druidæ were the publique Ministers of their Religion, as thorowly taught in all Rites thereof: Their Doctrine concerned the Immortalitie of the Soule, the Contempt of Death, and all other Points which may conduce to Resolution, Fortitude, and Magnanimitie: Their aboade was in Groves and Woods, whereupon they have their Name: their Power extended it selfe to master the Soules of Men deceased, and to conferre with Ghosts, and other Spirits, about the successe of Things. Plutarch, in his profound and learned Discourse of the defect of Oracles, reporteth, That the outmost British Iles were the Prison of I wot not what Demi-gods: But it shall not need to speake any farther of the Druidæ, then that which Lucan doth: Et vos barbaricos ritus, moremque sinistrum Sacrorum, Druidæ positis repetistis ab armis.They say, the Druides once liv'd in this Ile, This fatall Man, the place of my Exile, Whose pow'rfull Charmes such dreadfull Wonders wrought, Which in the Gotish Island Tongue were taught; O, that their Spels to me they had resign'd, Wherewith they rays'd and calm'd both Sea and Wind! And made the Moone pawse in her paled Sphere, Whilst her grim Dragons drew them through the Ayre: Their Hellish Power, to kill the Plow-mans Seed, Or to fore-speake whole Flocks, as they did feed; To nurse a damned Spirit with humane Bloud, To carry them through Earth, Ayre, Fire, and Floud: Had I this skill, that Time hath almost lost, How like a Goblin I would haunt her ghost? O pardon, pardon my mis-govern'd Tongue, A Womans strength cannot endure my Wrong. Noting the prodigious and fearefull signes that were seene in England, a little before her comming in: which Elinor expresseth in this Epistle, as fore-shewing the Dangers which should ensue upon this unluckie Marriage.Did not the Heavens her comming in withstand, As though affrighted, when she came to Land? The Earth did quake, her comming to abide, The goodly Thames did twice keepe backe his Tide, Pauls shooke with Tempests, and that mounting Spire, With Lightning sent from Heav'n, was set on fire; Our stately Buildings to the ground were blowne, Her Pride by these prodigious signes were showne; More fearefull Visions on the English Earth, Then ever were at any Death, or Birth. Ah Humfrey, Humfrey, if I should not speake, My Brest would split, my very Heart would breake. I, that was wont so many to command, Worse now then with a Clap-dish in my hand; A simple Mantle covering me withall, The very'st Leper, of Cares Hospitall; That from my State a Presence held in awe, Glad here to kennell in a Pad of Straw; And like an Owle, by Night to goe abroad, Roosted all day within an Ivy Tod, Among the Sea-Cliffes, in the dampie Caves, In Charnell-Houses, fit to dwell in Graves. Saw'st thou those Eyes, in whose sweet cheerefull Looke Duke Humphrey once such joy and pleasure tooke, Sorrow hath so despoyl'd them of all grace, Thou couldst not say, this was my El'nors face: Like a foule Gorgon, whose dishevel'd Hayre With every blast flyes glaring in the Ayre; Some standing up like Hornes upon my Head, Even like those Women that in Coos are bred: My lanke Brests hang like Bladders left unblowne, My Skin with lothsome Jaundize over-growne; So pin'd away, that if thou long'st to see Ruines true Picture, onely looke on mee. Sometime, in thinking of what I have had, I from a sudden Extasie grow mad: Then, like a Bedlam, forth thy El'nor runnes, Like one of Bacchus raging frantike Nunnes; Or like a Tartar, when in strange disguise, Prepar'd unto a dismall Sacrifice. That Prelate Beauford, a foule ill befall him, Prelate said I! nay, Devill I should call him: Ah God forgive me, if I thinke amisse, His very Name, me thinkes, my Poyson is: Ah that vile Judas, our professed Foe, My Curse pursue him, wheresoe'r he goe; That to my Judgement, when I did appeare, Laid to my charge those things that never were: That I should know of Bullenbrookes Intents, The Instruments which Bullenbrooke used in his Conjurations, according to the divellish Ceremonies and Customes of these unlawfull Arts, were dedicated at a Masse, in the Lodge in Harnsey Parke, by Southwell, Priest of Westminster.The hallowing of his Magicke Instruments; That I procured Southwell to assist, Which was by Order consecrate a Priest; That it was I should cover all they did, Which but for him had to this day beene hid. Ah that vile Bastard, that himselfe dare vaunt, To be the Sonne of thy brave Grandsire Gaunt, Whom he but father'd of meere Charitie, To rid his Mother of that Infamie; Who, if report of elder Times be true, Yet to this day his Father never knew. He that by Murthers blacke and odious Crime, To Henries Throne attempted once to clime, This was one of the Articles that Duke Humphrey urged against the Cardinall Beauford, That he conspired the death of Henry the fifth, by conveying a Villaine into his Chamber, which in the Night should have murthered him: but what ground of Truth he had for the same, I leave to dispute.Having procur'd by hope of golden gaine, A fatall Hand his Soveraigne to have slaine; Whom to his Chamber closely he convay'd, And for that purpose fitly there had layd; Upon whose Sword that famous Prince had dy'd, If by a Dogge he had not beene descry'd. But now the Queene, her Minion Poole, and he, As it please them, ev'n so must all things be; England's no place for any one beside; All is too little to maintaine their pride. What, of a King, hath Henry, but the Name; And now scarse that, so publike his defame? And I pray God, I doe not live the day, To see his Ruine, and the Realmes decay: And yet as sure as Humphrey seemes to stand, He be preserv'd from that vile Traytors hand. From Glosters Seat I would thou wert estrang'd, Or would to God that Dukedomes Name were chang'd, For it portends some after-ill to us; Ah Humphrey, Humphrey, it is ominous: Yet rather then thy hap so hard should be, I would thou wert here banished with me. Humphrey adiew, farewell true Noble Lord, My wish is all thy El'nor can afford. DUKE HUMPHREY TO ELINOR COBHAM. Me thinkes thou shouldst not doubt, I could forget Her, whom so many doe remember yet; “No, no, our Joyes away like shadowes slide, “But Sorrowes firme in memorie abide; Nay, I durst answere, thou do'st nothing lesse, But into Passion, urg'd by thy distresse: No El'nor, no, thy Woes, thy Griefe, thy Wrong, Have in my Brest beene resident too long. Oh, when Report in ev'ry place had spred, My El'nor was to Sanctuarie fled, With cursed Onley, and the Witch of Eye, As guiltie of their vile Conspiracie; The dreadfull Spirits when they did invocate, For the Succession, and the Realmes Estate; When Henries Image they in Waxe had wrought, By which he should have to his death beene brought; That as his Picture did consume away, His Person so by Sicknesse should decay: Griefe, that before could ne'r my Thoughts controule, That instant tooke possession of my Soule. Ah, would to God I could forget thine Ill! As for mine owne, let that inflict me still; But that before hath taken too sure hold: Forget it, said I? would to God I could. Of any Woe, if thou hast but one part, I have the whole remaining in my Heart; I have no need, of others Cares to borrow, For all I have, is nothing else but Sorrow. No, my sweet Nell, thou took'st not all away, Though thou went'st hence, here still thy Woes doe stay; Though from thy Husband thou wert forc'd to goe, Those still remaine, they will not leave him so: No Eye bewayles my Ill, moanes thy Distresse, Our Griefe's the more, but yet our Debt the lesse; We owe no Teares, no Mourning dayes are kept, For those that yet for us have never wept; We hold no Obiits, no sad Exequies, Upon the death-dayes of unweeping Eyes. Alas, good Nell, what should thy patience move, T'upbraid thy kind Lord with a forraine love? Thou might'st have bid all former Ills adue, Forgot the old, we have such store of new. Did I omit thy love to entertaine, With mutuall Griefe to answere Griefe againe? Or think'st thou, I unkindly did forbeare To bandie Woe for Woe, and Teare for Teare? Did I forget, or carelessely neglect Those shewes of Love, that Ladies so respect? In mournefull Blacke was I not seene to goe, By outward signes t'expresse my inward Woe? Did I thy losse not publiquely lament, Nor by my Lookes bewray'd my Discontent? Is this the cause? If this be it, know then, “One Griefe conceal'd, more grievous is then ten: If in my Brest those Sorrowes sometimes were, And never utt'red, they must still be there; And if thou know'st, they many were before, By time encreasing, they must needs be more. England to me can challenge nothing lent, Let her cast up what is receiv'd, what spent; If I her owne, can she from blame be free, If she but prove a step-mother to mee? That if I should with that proud Bastard strive, To plead for Birth-right my Prerogative, Be that allow'd, I should not need to feare it, For then my true Nobilitie should beare it: If Counsell ayd, that France will tell (I know) Whose Townes lye waste before the English Foe, When thrice we gave the conquer'd French the foile The three famous Battels fought by the Englishmen in France: Agincourt, by Henry the fifth, against the whole Power of France; Cravant, fought by Mountacute, Earle of Salisbury, and the Duke of Burgoyne, against the Dolphin of France, and William Stuart, Constable of Scotland: Vernoyle, fought by John, Duke of Bedford, against the Duke of Alanson, and with him most of the Nobilitie of France; Duke Humphrey an especiall Counsellor in all these Expeditions.At Agincourt, at Cravant, and Vernoyle: If Faith availe, these Armes did Henry hold, To clayme his Crowne, yet scarsely nine months old: If Countries care have leave to speake for me, Gray hayres in youth my witnesse then may be: If peoples Tongues give splendour to my Fame, They adde a Title to Duke Humphrey's Name: If Toyle at home, French Treason, English Hate, Shall tell my skill in managing the State, If forraine Travell my successe may try, Here remembring the ancient Amitie which in his Embassies he had concluded betwixt the King of England, and Sigismund, Emperour of Almaine, drawing the Duke of Burgoyne into the same League, giving himselfe as an Hostage for the Duke at Saint Omers, while the Duke came to Calice, to confirme the League: With his many other Imployments to forraine Kingdomes.Then Flanders, Almaine, Boheme, Burgundie. That Robe of Rome proud Beauford now doth weare, In every place such sway should never beare: Henry Beauford, Cardinall of Winchester, that proud and haughtie Prelate, received the Cardinals Hat at Calice, by the Popes Legate; which Dignitie, Henry the fifth, his Nephew, forbad him to take upon him, knowing his haughtie and malicious spirit, unfit for that Robe and Calling.The Crosier staffe in his imperious Hand, To be the Scepter that controules the Land; That home to England, Dispensations drawes, Which are of power to abrogate our Lawes; And for those Summes the wealthie Church should pay, Upon the needie Comminaltie to lay: His ghostly Counsels onely doe advise, As willing to shew, the House of Cambridge to be descended of Edmund Langley, Duke of Yorke, a younger Brother to John of Gaunt, his Grandfather (as much as in him lay) to smother the Title that the Yorkists made to the Crowne (from Lionel of Clarence, Gaunts elder Brother) by the Daughter of Mortimer.The meanes how Langleyes Progenie may rise, Pathing young Henries unadvised wayes, A Duke of Yorke from Cambridge House to rayse, Which after may our Title undermine, Grafted since Edward, in Gaunts famous Line, Us of Succession falsely to deprive, Which they from Clarence fainedly derive; Knowing the will old Cambridge ever bore, To catch the Wreathe that famous Henry wore: With Gray and Scroope when first he layd the Plot, From us, and ours, the Garland to have got; As from the March-borne Mortimer to raigne, Whose Title Glendour stoutly did maintaine, When the proud Percies, haughtie March, and hee, Had shar'd the Land by equall parts, in three. Noting the ancient Grudge betweene the House of Lancaster and Norfolke, ever since Mowbray, Duke of Norfolke, was banished, for the Accusation of Henry, Duke of Harford (after that, King of England, Father to Duke Humphrey:) Which Accusation, he came as a Combatant, to have made good, in the Lists at Coventry.His Priesthood now sterne Mowbray will restore, To stirre the fire that kindled was before; Against the Yorkists shall their Clayme advance, To steele the point of Norfolkes sturdie Lance, Upon the Brest of Harfords Issue bent, In just revenge of ancient Banishment. He doth advise to let our Pris'ner goe, And doth inlarge the faithlesse Scottish Foe, James Stuart, King of Scots, having beene long Prisoner in England, was released, and tooke to Wife the Daughter of John, Duke of Somerset, Sister to John, Duke of Somerset, Neece to the Cardinall, and the Duke of Excester, and Cousin-german removed to the King: This King broke the Oath he had taken, and became after a great Enemie to England.Giving our Heires in Marriage, that their Dow'rs May bring Invasion upon us and ours. Ambitious Suffolke so the Helme doth guide, With Beaufords damned Policies supply'd; He and the Queene in counsell still conferre, How to rayse him, who hath advanced her. But my deare Heart, how vainely doe I dreame, And flye from thee, whose Sorrowes are my Theame? My love to thee, and England thus divided, Which hath the most, how hard to be decided? Or thou, or that, to censure I am loth, So neere are you, so deare unto me both; 'Twixt that and thee, for equall love I find, England ingratefull, and my El'nor kind. But though my Countrey justly I reprove, Yet I for that, neglected have my love; Neverthelesse, thy Humfrey's to thee now, As when fresh Beautie triumph'd on thy Brow; As when thy Graces I admired most, Or of thy Favours might the frankly'st boast: Those Beauties were so infinite before, That in abundance I was onely poore; Of which, though Time hath taken some againe, I aske no more but what doth yet remaine. Be patient, gentle Heart, in thy distresse, Thou art a Princesse, not a whit the lesse. Whilst in these Brests we beare about this Life, I am thy Husband, and thou art my Wife. Cast not thine Eye on such as mounted be, But looke on those cast downe as low as we; For some of them which proudly pearch so hie, Ere long shall come as low as thou or I. They weepe for Joy, and let us laugh in Woe, We shall exchange, when Heav'n will have it so; We mourne, and they in after-time may mourne, Woe past, may once laugh present Woe to scorne: And worse then hath beene, we can never taste, Worse cannot come, then is alreadie past: “In all extremes, the onely depth of ill, “Is that which comforts the afflicted still. Ah would to God thou couldst thy Griefes deny, And on my backe let all the Burthen lye! Or if thou canst resigne, make them mine owne, Both in one Carriage to be undergone, Till we againe our former Hopes recover, And prosp'rous Times blow these Misfortunes over; For in the thought of those fore-passed yeeres, Some new resemblance of old Joy appeares. Mutuall our Care, so mutuall be our Love, That our Affliction never can remove: So rest in peace, where Peace hath hope to live, Wishing thee more then I my selfe can give. FINIS. WILLIAM DE-LA-POOLE, DUKE OF SUFFOLKE, TO QUEENE MARGARET. The Argument. This Duke of Suffolke, William, to advance A Lady, long belov'd of him in France, His Mistris, Margaret, that Duke Rayners Child, Himselfe who of Jerusalem instyl'd The King: this Poole, his Darling to preferre, Betwixt young Henry, nam'd the sixt, and her, Concludes a Marriage; and her Syre to gaine, Gives up the Towne of Mauns, Anjou, and Main, To Rayner for her: for which lawlesse fact, The Peeres him five yeeres Banishment enact; When for his latest farewell of the Queene, These two Epistles passe them two betweene. In my disgrace (deare Queene) rest thy Content, And Margarets health from Suffolks Banishment: Five yeres exile were not an houre to me, But that so soone I must depart from thee; Where thou not present, it is ever Night, All be exil'd, that live not in thy sight. Those Savages which worship the Sunnes rise, Would hate their God, if they beheld thine Eyes; The Worlds great Light, might'st thou be seene abroad, Would at our Noone-stead ever make aboad, And force the poore Antipodes to mourne, Fearing lest he would never more returne. Wer't not for thee, it were my great'st Exile, To live within this Sea-inviron'd Ile. Pooles Courage brookes not limiting in Bands, But that (great Queene) thy Sov'raigntie commands: He alludes, in these Verses, to the Faulcon, which was the ancient Device of the Pooles, comparing the greatnesse and haughtinesse of his spirit to the nature of this Bird.Our Faulcons kind cannot the Cage indure, Nor Buzzard-like doth stoope to ev'ry Lure; Their mounting Brood in open Ayre doth rove, Nor will with Crowes be coup'd within a Grove. We all doe breathe upon this Earthly Ball, Likewise one Heav'n incompasseth us all, “No Banishment can be to him assign'd, “Who doth retaine a true-resolved Mind. “Man in himselfe a little World doth beare, “His Soule the Monarch, ever ruling there: “Where-ever then his Body doth remaine, “He is a King, that in himselfe doth raigne; “And never feareth Fortunes hot'st Alarmes, “That beares against her Patience for his Armes. The Commons, at this Parliament, through Warwickes meanes, accused Suffolke of Treason, and urged the Accusation so vehemently, that the King was forced to exile him for five yeeres.This was the meane proud Warwicke did invent, To my disgrace, at Leister Parlement, The Duke of Suffolke being sent into France, to conclude a Peace, chose Duke Rayners daughter, the Ladie Margaret, whom he espoused for Henry the sixt; delivering for her, to her Father, the Countries of Anjou and Main, and the Citie of Mauns. Whereupon the Earle of Arminach (whose Daughter was before promised to the King) seeing himselfe to be deluded, caused all the Englishmen to be expulsed Aquitaine, Gascoyne, and Guyne.That onely I, by yeelding up of Maine, Should cause the losse of fertile Aquitaine, This Richard, that was called the great Earle of Warwicke, when Duke Humphrey was dead, grew into exceeding great favour with the Commons.With the base vulgar sort to winne him fame, To be the Heire of good Duke Humphreyes Name; And so by Treason spotting my pure Blood, Make this a meane to rayse the Nevils Brood. Richard Plantaginet, Duke of Yorke, in the time of Henry the sixt, claymed the Crowne (being assisted by this Richard Nevill, Earle of Salisburie, and Father to the great Earle of Warwicke, who favoured exceedingly the House of Yorke) in open Parliament, as Heire to Lionel, Duke of Clarence, the third sonne of Edward the third, making his Title by Anne his Mother, Wife to Richard, Earle of Cambridge, sonne to Edmund of Langley, Duke of Yorke: Which Anne was Daughter to Roger Mortimer, Earle of March; which Roger was Sonne and Heire to Edmund Mortimer, that married the Ladie Philip, Daughter and Heire to Lionel, Duke of Clarence, the third sonne of King Edward: to whom the Crowne, after King Richard the Seconds Death, lineally descended, he dying without Issue; and not to the Heires of the Duke of Lancaster, that was younger Brother to the Duke of Clarence. Hall. cap. 1. Tit. Yor. &amp; Lanc.With Salsbury, his vile ambitious Sire, In Yorkes sterne Brest kindling long hidden fire; By Clarence Title working to supplant The Eagle Ayrie of great John of Gaunt: And to this end did my Exile conclude, Thereby to please the rascall Multitude; Humphrey, Duke of Glocester, and Lord Protector, in the five and twentieth yeere of Henry the sixt, by the meanes of the Queene, and the Duke of Suffolke, was arrested by the Lord Beaumont, at the Parliament holden at Berry, and the same Night after murthered in his Bed.Urg'd by these envious Lords to spend their breath, Crying revenge for the Protectors death; That since the old decrepit Duke is dead, By me, of force, he must be murthered. In these Verses he jests at the Protectors Wife, who (being accused and convicted of Treason, because with John Hun, a Priest, Roger Bullenbrooke, a Necromancer, and Margerie Jordan, called the Witch of Eye, shee had consulted by Sorcerie to kill the King) was adjudged to perpetuall Prison in the Ile of Man, and to doe Penance openly, in three publique places in London.If they would know who rob'd him of his Life, Let him call home Dame Elinor, his Wife, Who with a Taper walked in a Sheet, To light her shame at Noone through London Street; And let her bring her Necromanticke Booke, That foule Hag Jordan, Hun, &amp; Bullenbrooke, And let them call the Spirits from Hell againe, To know how Humphrey dy'd, and who shall raigne. In the sixt yeere of Henry the sixt, the Duke of Bedford being deceased, then Lieutenant Generall, and Regent of France; this Duke of Suffolke was promoted to that Dignitie, having the Lord Talbot, Lord Scales, and the Lord Mountacute, to assist him.For twentie yeeres, and have I serv'd in France, This was Charles the seventh, who after the death of Henry the fifth, obtained the Crowne of France, and recovered againe much of that his Father had lost. Bastard Orleance was sonne to the Duke of Orleance, begotten of the Lord Cawnies Wife, preferred highly to many notable Offices, because he being a most valiant Captaine, was a continuall Enemie to the Englishmen, dayly infesting them with divers Incursions.Against great Charles, and Bastard Orleance, And seene the slaughter of a World of Men, Victorious now, as hardly conquer'd then? Vernoyle is that noted place in France, where the great Battell was fought in the beginning of Henry the sixt his raigne, where the most of the French Chivalrie were overcome by the Duke of Bedford.And have I seene Vernoyla's batfull Fields, Strew'd with ten thousand Helmes, ten thousand Shields, Where famous Bedford did our fortune trie, Or France, or England, for the Victorie? The sad investing of so many Townes, Scor'd on my Brest in honourable Wounds; When Mountacute, and Talbot of much Name, Under my Ensigne both first wonne their Fame: In Heat and Cold all these have I indur'd, To rowze the French, within their Walls immur'd; Through all my Life, these Perils have I past, And now to feare a Banishment at last? Thou know'st how I (thy Beautie to advance) For thee, refus'd the Infanta of France, Brake the Contract Duke Humphrey first did make 'Twixt Henry and the Princesse Arminacke: Onely that here thy presence I might gaine, I gave Duke Rayner, Anjou, Mauns, and Maine; Thy peerelesse Beautie for a Dower to bring, As of it selfe sufficient for a King: Aumerle is that strong defenced Towne in France, which the Duke of Suffolke got, after foure and twentie great Assaults given unto it.And from Aumerle withdrew my Warlike Pow'rs, Tours is a Citie in France, built by Brutus, as he came into Britaine: where, in the one and twentieth yeere of the raigne of Henry the sixt, was appointed a great Diet to be kept; whither came Embassadours of the Empire, Spaine, Hungarie, and Denmarke, to intreat for a perpetuall Peace to be made betweene the two Kings of England and France.And came my selfe in person first to Tours, Th'Embassadours for Truce to entertaine, From Belgia, Denmarke, Hungarie, and Spaine: And to the King relating of thy storie, My Tongue flow'd with such plenteous Oratorie, As the report by speaking did indite, Begetting still more ravishing delight. And when my Speech did cease (as telling all) My Looke shew'd more, that was Angelicall; And when I breath'd againe, and pawsed next, I left mine Eyes dilating on the Text: Then comming of thy Modestie to tell, In Musickes Numbers my Voyce rose and fell; And when I came to paint thy glorious stile, My speech in greater Cadences to file, Rayner, Duke of Anjou, Father to Queene Margaret, called himselfe King of Naples, Cicily, and Jerusalem, having the Title alone of the King of those Countries.By true descent to weare the Diadem Of Naples, Cicill, and Jerusalem, As from the Gods thou didst derive thy Birth, If those of Heaven could mix with these of Earth; Gracing each Title that I did recite, With some mellifluous pleasing Epithite: Nor left him not, till he for love was sicke, Beholding thee in my sweet Rhetoricke. The Duke of Suffolke, after the Marriage concluded betweene King Henry and Margaret, Daughter to Duke Rayner, asked in open Parliament a whole Fifteenth, to fetch her into England.A Fifteenes Taxe in France I freely spent, In Triumphs, at thy Nuptiall Tournament; And solemniz'd thy Marriage in a Gowne, Valu'd at more then was thy Fathers Crowne; And onely striving how to honour thee, Gave to my King what thy love gave to mee. Judge if his kindnesse have not power to move, Who for his loves sake gave away his love. Had he, which once the Prize to Greece did bring, (Of whom, th'old Poets long agoe did sing) Deepe is a Towne in France, bordering upon the Sea, where the Duke of Suffolke, with Queene Margaret, tooke ship for England.Seene thee for England but imbark'd at Deepe, Would over-boord have cast his golden Sheepe, As too unworthy Ballast to be thought, To pester roome, with such perfection fraught. The brinie Seas, which saw the Ship infold thee, Would vault up to the Hatches, to behold thee, And falling backe, themselves in thronging smother, Breaking for griefe, envying one another: When the proud Barke, for joy thy steps to feele, Scorn'd that the Brack should kisse her furrowing Keele, And trick'd in all her Flags, her selfe she braves, Cap'ring for joy upon the silver Waves; When like a Bull from the Phenician Strand, Jove with Europa rushing from the Land, Upon the Bosome of the Maine doth scud, And with his Swannish Brest cleaving the Floud, Tow'rd the faire Fields, upon the other side, Beareth Agenors joy, Phenicia's pride: All heavenly Beauties joyne themselves in one, To shew their glorie in thine Eye alone; Which, when it turneth that celestiall Ball, A thousand sweet starres rise, a thousand fall. Who justly saith, mine, Banishment to bee, When onely France for my recourse is free? To view the Plaines, where I have seene so oft Englands victorious Engines rays'd aloft; When this shall be a comfort in my way, To see the place, where I may boldly say, Here mightie Bedford forth the Vaward led, Here Talbot charg'd, and here the Frenchmen fled, Here with our Archers valiant Scales did lye, Here stood the Tents of famous Willoughby, Here Mountacute rang'd his unconquer'd Band, Here march'd we out, and here we made a stand. What should we sit to mourne and grieve all day, For that which Time doth eas'ly take away? What Fortune hurts, let Suff'rance onely heale, “No wisedome with Extremities to deale. To know our selves to come of humane Birth, These sad Afflictions crosse us here on Earth. A punishment from the eternall Law, To make us still of Heav'n to stand in awe. “In vaine we prize that at so deare a rate, “Whose long'st assurance beare's a Minutes date. “Why should we idly talke of our Intent, “When Heav'ns Decree no Counsell can prevent? “When our fore-sight not possibly can shunne “That which the Fates determine shall be done. Henry hath Power, and may my Life depose, Mine Honour's mine, that none hath power to lose. Then be as cheerefull (beautious Royall Queene) As in the Court of France we oft have beene; Porchester, a Haven Towne in the South-West part of England, where the King tarried, expecting the Queenes arrivall; whom from thence he conveyed to South-hampton.As when arriv'd in Porchesters faire Road, (Where, for our comming, Henry made aboad) When in mine Armes I brought thee safe to Land, And gave my Love to Henries Royall Hand: The happie Houres we passed with the King At faire South-hampton, long in banqueting; With such content as lodg'd in Henries Brest, When he to London brought thee from the West, Through golden Cheape, when he in Pompe did ride To Westminster, to entertaine his Bride. QUEENE MARGARET TO WILLIAM DE-LA-POOLE, DUKE OF SUFFOLKE. What news (sweet Poole) look'st thou my Lines should tell, But like the toling of the dolefull Bell, Bidding the Deaths-man to prepare the Grave? Expect from me no other newes to have. My Brest, which once was Mirths imperiall Throne, A vast and desart Wildernesse is growne: Like that cold Region, from the World remote, On whose breeme Seas the Icie Mountaines flote; Where those poore Creatures, banish'd from the Light, Doe live impris'ned in continuall Night. No Object greets my Soules internall Eyes, But divinations of sad Tragedies; And Care takes up her solitarie Inne, Where Youth and Joy their Court did once begin. As in September, when our Yeere resignes The glorious Sunne to the cold Wat'rie Signes, Which through the Clouds lookes on the Earth in scorne; The little Bird, yet to salute the Morne, Upon the naked Branches sets her foot, The Leaves then lying on the mossie Root, And there a silly chiripping doth keepe, As though she faine would sing, yet faine would weepe, Praysing faire Summer, that too soone is gone, Or sad for Winter, too fast comming on: In this strange plight I mourne for thy depart, Because that Weeping cannot ease my Heart. Now to our aid, who stirres the neighb'ring Kings? Or who from France a puisant Armie brings? Who moves the Norman to abet our Warre? Philip, Duke of Burgoyne, and his sonne, were alwayes great Favourites of the House of Lancaster; howbeit, they often dissembled both with Lancaster and Yorke.Or brings in Burgoyne to aid Lancaster? The chiefe Lords of the North parts, in the time of Henry the sixt, withstood the Duke of Yorke at his Rising, giving him two great Overthrowes.Who in the North our lawfull Clayme commends, To winne us Credit with our valiant Friends? To whom shall I my secret Griefes impart, Whose Brest shall be the Closet of my Heart? The ancient Heroes fame thou do'st revive, As from all them thy selfe thou didst derive: Nature, by thee, both gave and taketh all, Alone in Poole she was too prodigall; Of so divine and rich a temper wrought, As Heav'n for thee Perfections depth had sought. Well knew King Henry what he pleaded for, When he chose thee to be his Orator; Whose Angell-eye, by pow'rfull influence, Doth utter more then humane Eloquence: That if againe Jove would his Sports have try'd, He in thy shape himselfe would onely hide; Which in his love might be of greater pow'r, Then was his Nymph, his Flame, his Swan, his Show'r. The Duke of Yorke, at the death of Henry the fifth, and at this Kings Coronation, tooke his Oath, to be true subject to him and his Heires for ever: but afterward dispensing therewith, claymed the Crowne, as his rightfull and proper Inheritance.To that allegeance Yorke was bound by Oath, To Henries Heires, for safetie of us both; No longer now he meanes Record shall beare it, He will dispense with Heav'n, and will unsweare it. He that's in all the Worlds blacke sinnes forlorne, Is carelesse now how oft he be forsworne; And here of late his Title hath set downe, By which he makes his Clayme unto our Crowne. And now I heare his hatefull Duchesse chats, And rips up their Descent unto her Brats, And blesseth them as Englands lawfull Heires, And tells them, that our Diademe is theirs: And if such hap her Goddesse Fortune bring, The Duke of Yorke had foure sonnes; Edward, Earle of March, that afterward was Duke of Yorke, and King of England, when he had deposed Henry the sixt; and Edmund, Earle of Rutland, slaine by the Lord Clifford, at the Battell at Wakefield; and George, Duke of Clarence, that was murthered in the Tower; and Richard, Duke of Gloucester, who was (after he had murthered his Brothers sonnes) King, by the Name of Richard the third.If three Sonnes faile, shee'le make the fourth a King. This Richard (whom ironically she here calls Dick) that by Treason, after the murther of his Nephewes, obtained the Crowne, was a Man low of stature, crooke-back'd, the left shoulder much higher then the right, and of a very crabbed and sowre Countenance: His Mother could not be delivered of him; hee was borne Toothed, and with his Feet forward, contrarie to the course of Nature.He that's so like his Dam, her youngest Dick, That foule, ill-favour'd, crooke-back'd Stigmatick, That like a Carkasse stolne out of a Tombe, Came the wrong way out of his Mothers Wombe, With Teeth in's Head, his passage to have torne, As though begot an Age ere he was borne. Who now will curbe proud Yorke, when he shall rise? Or arme our Right against his Enterprise, To crop that Bastard Weed, which dayly growes, The Red Rose was the Badge of the House of Lancaster, and the White Rose, of Yorke; which, by the Marriage of Henry the seventh with Elizabeth, indubitate Heire of the House of Yorke, was happily united.To over-shadow our Vermilion Rose? The Earle of Warwicke, the setter up and puller downe of Kings, gave for his Armes the White Beare rampant, and the Ragged Staffe.Or who will muzzle that unruly Beare, Whose presence strikes our peoples Hearts with feare? Whilst on his knees this wretched King is downe, To save them labour, reaching at his Crowne, Where like a mounting Cedar, he should beare His plumed Top aloft into the ayre; And let these Shrubs sit underneath his Shrowds, Whilst in his armes he doth imbrace the Clowds. O, that he should his Fathers Right inherit, Yet be an Alien to that mightie Spirit! How were those Pow'rs dispers'd, or whither gone, Should sympathize in Generation? Or what opposed Influence had force, So much t'abuse and alter Natures course? “All other Creatures follow after kind, “But Man alone doth not beget the Mind. The Daisie in French is called Margarite, which was Queene Margarets Badge; wherewithall the Nobilitie and Chivalrie of the Land, at her first Arrivall, were so delighted, that they wore it in their Hats, in token of Honour.My Daisie flower, which erst perfum'd the ayre, Which for my favour Princes dayn'd to weare, Now in the dust lyes trodden on the ground, And with Yorkes Garlands ev'ry one is crown'd: When now his Rising waits on our Decline, And in our Setting, he begins to shine; Now in the Skies that dreadfull Comet waves. The ragged, or bearded Staffe, was a part of the Armes belonging to the Earledome of Warwicke.And who be Starres, but Warwicks bearded Staves? And all those Knees which bended once so low, Grow stiffe, as though they had forgot to bow; And none, like them, pursue me with despite, Which most have cry'd, God save Queene Margarite. When Fame shall brute thy Banishment abroad, The Yorkist's Faction then will lay on load; And when it comes once to our Westerne Coast, O, how that Hag, Dame Elinor, will boast! And labour straight, by all the meanes she can, To be call'd home out of the Ile of Man: To which I know Great Warwick will consent, To have it done by Act of Parlament, That to my Teeth my Birth she may defie, Rayner, Duke of Anjou, called himselfe King of Naples, Cicile, and Jerusalem, who had neyther Inheritance, nor received any Tribute from those Parts; and was not able, at the Marriage of the Queene, at his owne Charges, to send her into England, though hee gave no Dower with her: Which, by the Duchesse of Gloucester, was often, in disgrace, cast in her Teeth.Sland'ring Duke Rayner with base Beggerie; The onely way she could devise to grieve me, Wanting sweet Suffolke, which should most relieve me. And from that Stocke doth sprout another Bloome, This was Jack Cade, which caused the Kentish Men to rebell, in the eight and twentieth yeere of King Henry the sixt.A Kentish Rebell, a base upstart Groome; This Jack Cade, instructed by the Duke of Yorke, pretended to be descended from Mortimer, which married Ladie Philip, Daughter to the Duke of Clarence.And this is he the White-Rose must preferre, By Clarence Daughter, match'd with Mortimer. Thus by Yorkes meanes, this rascall pesant, Cade, Must in all haste Plantaginet be made: For that ambitious Duke sets all on worke, To sound what Friends affect the Clayme of Yorke, Whilst he abroad doth practise to command, The Duke of Yorke being made Deputie of Ireland, first there began to practise his long pretended purpose, and strengthening himselfe by all meanes possible, that hee might, at his returne into England, by open Warre, clayme that, which so long before hee had privily gone about to obtaine.And makes us weake, by strength'ning Ireland; More his owne power still seeking to increase, Then for King Henries good, or Englands peace. Henry Beauford, Bishop and Cardinall of Winchester, sonne to John of Gaunt, begot in his age, was a proud and ambitious Prelate, favouring mightily the Queene and the Duke of Suffolke, continually heaping up innumerable Treasure, in hope to have beene Pope, as himselfe on his Death-bed confessed.Great Winchester untimely is deceas'd, That more and more my Woes should be increas'd. Beauford, whose shoulders proudly bare up all The Churches Prop, that famous Cardinall. The Commons (bent to Mischiefe) never let, Edmund, Duke of Somerset, in the foure and twentieth yeere of Henry the sixt, was made Regent of France, and sent into Normandie, to defend the English Territories against the French Invasions: but in short time he lost all that King Henry the fifth wonne; for which cause, the Nobles and Commons ever after hated him.With France t'upbraid that valiant Somerset, Rayling in Tumults on his Souldiers losse; Thus all goes backward, crosse comes after crosse: And now of late, Duke Humphrey's old Allies, With banish'd El'nors base Accomplices, Attending their Revenge, grow wond'rous Crouse, And threaten Death and Vengeance to our House; And I alone the last poore remnant am, Humphrey, Duke of Buckingham, was a great Favourite of the Queenes Faction, in the time of Henry the sixt.T'indure these stormes with wofull Buckingham. I pray thee, Poole, have care how thou do'st passe, Never the Sea yet halfe so dang'rous was; The Witch of Eye received answere from her Spirit, That the Duke of Suffolke should take heed of Water: Which the Queene fore-warnes him of, as remembring the Witches Prophesie; which afterwards came to passe.And one fore-told, by Water thou should'st die, (Ah! foule befall that foule Tongues Prophesie) Yet I by Night am troubled in my Dreames, That I doe see thee toss'd in dang'rous Streames; And oft-times ship-wrack'd, cast upon the Land, And lying breathlesse on the queachy Sand; And oft in Visions see thee in the Night, Where thou at Sea maintain'st a dang'rous Fight, And with thy proved Target and thy Sword, Beat'st backe the Pyrate which would come aboord. Yet be not angry, that I warne thee thus, “The truest love is most suspitious. Sorrow doth utter what it still doth grieve: But Hope forbids us, Sorrow to beleeve; And in my counsell yet this comfort is, It cannot hurt, although I thinke amisse: Then live in hope, in Triumph to returne, When cleerer Dayes shall leave in Clouds to mourne. But so hath Sorrow girt my Soule about, That that word Hope (me thinkes) comes slowly out: The reason is, I know it here would rest, Where it might still behold thee in my Brest. Farewell, sweet Poole, faine more I would indite, But that my Teares doe blot what I doe write. FINIS. EDWARD THE FOURTH TO MISTRES SHORE. The Argument. Edward the Fourth bewitch'd with the Report Of Mistres Shore, resounded through his Court; Steales to the Citie in a strange Disguise, To view that Beautie, whose trans-piercing Eyes Had shot so many: which did so content The amorous King, that instantly he sent These Lines to her, whose Graces did allure him; Whose Answere backe, doth of her love assure him. To thee, the fair'st that ever breath'd this ayre, Edward the fourth was by nature very Chivalrous, and very Amorous, applying his sweet and amiable Aspect to attaine his wanton Appetite the rather: which was so well knowne to Lewes the French King, who at their interview invited him to Paris, that as Comineus reports, being taken at his word, he notwithstanding brake off the matter, fearing the Parisian Dames, with their wittie conversation, would detaine him longer then should be for his benefit: by which meanes, Edward was disappointed of his Journey. And albeit Princes, whilest they live, have nothing in them but what is admirable; yet we need not mistrust the flatterie of the Court in those Times: For certaine it is, that his shape was excellent; his Haire drew neere to a blacke, making his Faces favour to seeme more delectable: though the smalnesse of his Eyes, full of a shining moisture, as it tooke away some Comelinesse; so it argued much sharpenesse of Understanding, and Crueltie, mingled together. And indeed, George Bucanan (that imperious Scot) chargeth him, and other Princes of those Times, with affection of Tyrannie; as Richard the third manifestly did.From English Edward, to thee fairest faire: Ah, would to God thy Title were no more, That no remembrance might remaine of Shore, To countermaund a Monarchs high desire, And barre mine Eyes of what they most admire! O, why should Fortune make the Citie proud, To give that more, then is the Court allow'd? Where they (like Wretches) hoord it up to spare, And doe ingrosse it, as they doe their Ware. When Fame first blaz'd thy Beautie here in Court, Mine Eares repuls'd it, as a light Report: But when mine Eyes saw what mine Eare had heard, They thought Report too niggardly had spar'd; And strucken dumbe with wonder, did but mutter, Conceiving more then it had words to utter. Then thinke of what thy Husband is possest, When I maligne the Wealth wherewith hee's blest; “When much abundance makes the needie mad, “Who having all, yet knowes not what is had; “Into Fooles Bosomes this good fortune creepes, “And Summes come in, whilst the base Miser sleepes. If now thy Beautie be of such esteeme, Which all of so rare excellencie deeme; What would it be, and prized at what rate, Were it adorned with a Kingly State? Which being now but in so meane a Bed, Is like an un-cut Diamond in Lead, Ere it be set in some high-prized Ring, Or garnished with rich enamelling; We see the beautie of the Stone is spilt, Wanting the gracious Ornament of Gilt. Edwards intemperate desires, with which he was wholly overcome, how tragically they in his Off-spring were punished, is universally knowne. A Mirrour, representing their Over-sight, that rather leave their Children what to possesse, then what to imitate.When first attracted by thy heavenly Eyes, I came to see thee in a strange Disguise, Passing thy Shop, thy Husband call'd me backe, Demanding what rare Jewell I did lacke. I want (thought I) One that I dare not crave, And One (I feare) thou wilt not let me have: He calls for Caskets forth, and shewes me store; But yet I knew he had one Jewell more, And deadly curst him, that he did deny it, That I might not for Love or Money buy it. O, might I come a Diamond to buy, That had but such a Lustre as thine Eye, Would not my Treasure serve, my Crowne should goe, If any Jewell could be prized so! An Agat, branched with thy blushing straines, A Saphire, but so azur'd as thy veines; My Kingly Scepter onely should redeeme it, At such a price if Judgement could esteeme it. How fond and senselesse be those Strangers then, Who bring in Toyes, to please the English men? I smile to thinke, how fond th'Italians are, To judge their artificiall Gardens rare; When London in thy Cheekes can shew them heere Roses and Lillies growing all the yeere: The Portugall, that onely hopes to win, By bringing Stones from farthest India in; When happie Shore can bring them forth a Girle, Whose Lips be Rubies, and her Teeth be Pearle. Alluding to their Opinions, who imagine Crystall to be a kind of Ice; and therefore it is likely, they who come from those frozen parts, should bring great store of that transparent Stone, which is thought to be congealed with extreme Cold. Whether Crystall be Ice, or some other Liquor, I omit to dispute; yet by the examples of Amber and Corall, there may be such an induration: for Solinus out of Pliny mentioneth, That in the Northerly Region a yellow Gelly is taken up out of the Sea at low Tides, which he calls Succinum, we, Amber; so likewise, out of the Ligustick Deepe, a part of the Mediterranean Sea, a greenish Stalke is gathered, which hardened in the Ayre, comes to be Corall, either White, or Red. Amber notwithstanding is thought to droppe out of Trees; as appeares by Martials Epigram: Et latet, &amp; lucet Phaëtontide condita gutta, Ut videatur apis nectare clausa suo. Dignum tantorum pretium tulit ille laborum; Credibile est ipsam sic voluisse mori. To behold a Bee inclosed in Electrum, is not so rare, as that a Boyes Throat should be cut with the fall of an Ice-sicle, the which Epigram is excellent, the 18. li. 4. He calls it Phaëtontis Gutta, because of that Fable which Ovid rehearseth, concerning the Heliades, or Phaetons sisters, metamorphosed into those Trees, whose Gumme is Amber, where Flies alighting, are oftentimes tralucently imprisoned.How silly is the Polander and Dane, To bring us Crystall from the frozen Maine? When thy cleare Skins transparence doth surpasse Their Crystall, as the Diamond doth Glasse. The foolish French, which bring in Trash and Toyes, To turne our Women, Men, our Girles to Boyes, When with what Tyre thou do'st thy selfe adorne, That for a Fashion onely shall be worne; Which though it were a Garment but of Haire, More rich then Robe that ever Empresse ware. Me thinkes thy Husband takes his marke awry, To set his Plate to sale, when thou art by; When they which doe thy Angell-locks behold, As the base Drosse, doe but respect his Gold, And wish one Haire, before that massie Heape, And but one Locke, before the Wealth of Cheape: And for no cause else hold we Gold so deare, But that it is so like unto thy Haire. And sure I thinke, Shore cannot chuse but flout Such as would find the great Elixar out, And laugh to see the Alchymists, that choke Themselves with Fumes, and waste their Wealth in Smoke; When if thy Hand but touch the grossest Mold, It is converted to refined Gold: When theirs is chaff'red at an easie rate, Well knowne to all, to be adulterate; And is no more, when it by thine is set, Then paltry Beugle, or light-prized Jeat. Let others weare Perfumes, for thee unmeet, If there were none, thou couldst make all things sweet; Thou comfort'st ev'ry Sense with sweet repast, To heare, to see, to smell, to feele, to taste; Like a rich Ship, whose very refuse Ware, Aromatikes, and precious Odors are. If thou but please to walke into the Pawne, To buy thee Cambricke, Callico, or Lawne, If thou the whitenesse of the same wouldst prove, From thy more whiter Hand plucke off thy Glove; And those which buy, as the Beholders stand, Will take thy Hand for Lawne, Lawne for thy Hand: A thousand Eyes, clos'd up by envious Night, Doe wish for Day, but to injoy thy sight; And when they once have blest their Eyes with thee, Scorne ev'ry Object else, what ere they see; So like a Goddesse Beautie still controules, And hath such pow'rfull working in our Soules. The Merchant, which in Traffique spends his life, Yet loves at home to have a daintie Wife; The blunt-spoke Cynicke, poring on his Booke, Sometimes (aside) at Beautie loves to looke; The Church-man, by whose Teaching we are led, Allowes what keepes love in the Marriage Bed; The bloudie Souldier, spent in dang'rous Broyles, With Beautie yet content to share his Spoyles; The busie Lawyer, wrangling in his Pleas, Findeth, that Beautie gives his labour ease; The toyling Trades-man, and the sweating Clowne, Would have his Wench faire, though his Bread be browne; So much is Beautie pleasing unto all, That Prince and Pesant equally doth call; Nor never yet did any Man despise it, Except too deare, and that he could not prize it. Unlearn'd is Learning, Artlesse be all Arts, If not imploy'd to prayse thy sev'rall Parts: Poore plodding Schoole-men they are farre too low, Which by Probations, Rules, and Axiomes goe; He must be still familiar with the Skies, Which notes the Revolutions of thine Eyes: And by that Skill which measures Sea and Land, See Beauties All, thy Waste, thy Foot, thy Hand; Where he may find, the more that he doth view, Such rare Delights, as are both strange and new; And other Worlds of Beautie, more and more, Which never were discovered before: And to thy rare Proportion, to apply The Lines and Circles in Geometry; Using alone Arithmetikes strong ground, Numbring the Vertues that in thee are found: And when these all have done what they can doo, For thy Perfections, all too little too. When from the East the Dawne hath gotten out, And gone to seeke thee all the World about, Within thy Chamber hath she fix'd her Light, Where, but that place, the World hath all beene Night: Then is it fit, that ev'ry vulgar Eye Should see Love banquet in her Majestie? “We deeme those things our Sight doth most frequent, “To be but meane, although most excellent; “For strangers, still the streets are swept and strow'd, “Few looke on such as dayly come abroad; “Things much restrain'd, doe make us much desire them, “And Beauties seldome seene, make us admire them. Nor is it fit, a Citie-shop should hide The Worlds Delight, and Natures onely Pride; But in a Princes sumptuous Gallerie, Hung all with Tissue, floor'd with Tapestrie; Where thou shalt sit, and from thy State shalt see The Tilts and Triumphs that are done for thee. Then know the diff'rence (if thou list to prove) Betwixt a Vulgar and a Kingly love; And when thou find'st, as now thou doubt'st, the troth, Be thou thy selfe unpartiall Judge of both. Where Hearts be knit, what helpes, if not injoy? Delay breedes doubts, no Cunning to be coy; Whilst lazie Time his turne by tarriance serves, Love still growes sickly, and Hope dayly starves: Meane while, receive that Warrant by these Lines, Which Princely Rule and Sov'raigntie resignes; Till when, these Papers, by their Lords command, By me shall kisse thy sweet and daintie Hand. This Epistle of Edward to Mistres Shore, and of hers to him, being of unlawfull Affection, ministreth small occasion of Historicall Notes; for had he mentioned the many Battels betwixt the Lancastrian Faction and him, or other Warlike Dangers, it had beene more like to Plautus boasting Souldier, then a Kingly Courtier. Notwithstanding, it shall not be amisse to annexe a Line, or two. THE EPISTLE OF MISTRES SHORE, TO KING EDWARD THE FOURTH. As the weake Child, that from the Mothers wing, Is taught the Lutes delicious fingering, At ev'ry strings soft touch, is mov'd with feare, Noting his Masters curious list'ning Eare; Whose trembling Hand, at ev'ry straine bewrayes, In what doubt he his new-set Lesson playes: As this poore Child, so sit I to indite, At ev'ry word still quaking as I write. Two or three Poems written by sundry men, have magnified this womans beautie; whom, that ornament of England and Londons more particular glorie, Sir Thomas Moore, verie highly hath praised for her beautie, she being alive in his time, though being poore and aged. Her stature was meane, her haire of a darke yellow, her face round and full, her eye gray, delicate harmony being betwixt each parts proportion, and each proportions colour, her bodie fat, white, and smooth, her countenance cheerefull, and like to her condition. That picture which I have seene of hers, was such as shee rose out of her bed in the morning, having nothing on but a rich Mantle, cast under one arme over her shoulder, and sitting in a chaire, on which her naked arme did lie. What her fathers name was, or where she was borne, is not certainly knowne: but Shore, a yong man of right goodly person, wealth, and behaviour, abandoned her bed, after the King had made her his Concubine. Richard the third causing her to doe open penance in Pauls Church-yard, commanded that no man should relieve her, which the tyrant did not so much for his hatred to sinne, but that by making his brothers life odious, he might cover his horrible treasons the more cunningly.Would I had led an humble Shepheards life, Nor knowne the Name of Shores admired Wife, And liv'd with them, in Countrey fields that range, Nor seene the golden Cheape, nor glitt'ring Change. Here, like a Comet gaz'd at in the Skies, Subject to all Tongues, object to all Eyes: Oft have I heard my Beautie prays'd of many, But never yet so much admir'd of any; A Princes Eagle-Eye to find out that, Which common Men doe seldome wonder at, Makes me to thinke Affection flatters Sight, Or in the Object some thing exquisite. “To housed Beautie seldome stoop's Report, “Fame must attend on that, which lives in Court. What Swan of bright Apollo's Brood doth sing, To vulgar Love, in Courtly Soneting? Or what immortall Poets sugred Pen Attends the glory of a Citizen? Oft have I wondred, what should blind your Eye, Or what so farre seduced Majestie, That having choise of Beauties so divine, Amongst the most, to chuse this least of mine? More glorious Sunnes adorne faire Londons pride, Then all rich Englands Continent beside; That who t'account their Multitudes, would wish, Rumney is that famous Marsh in Kent, at whose side Rie, a Haven Towne, doth stand. Hereof the excellent English Antiquarie, Master Camden, and Master Lambert in his Perambulation, doe make mention. And Marishes are commonly called those low Grounds which abut upon the Sea, and from the Latine Word are so denominated. Isis is here used for Thamesis by a Synecdochicall kind of speech, or by a Poeticall libertie, in using one for another: for it is said, that Thamesis is compounded of Tame and Isis, making, when they are met, that renowmed Water, running by London; a Citie much more renowmed then that Water: Which being plentifull of Fish, is the cause also why all things else are plentifull therein. Moreover, I am perswaded, that there is no River in the World beholds more stately Buildings on eyther side, cleane thorow, then the Thames. Much is reported of the Graund Canale in Venice, for that the Fronts on eyther side are so gorgeous.Might number Rumney's Flowers, or Isis Fish. Who doth frequent our Temples, Walkes, and Streets, Noting the sundry Beauties that he meets, Thinkes not, that Nature left the wide World poore, And made this place the Chequer of her store; As Heav'n and Earth had lately falne at Jarres, And growne to vying Wonders, dropping Starres: That if but some one Beautie should incite Some sacred Muse, some ravish'd Spirit to write, Here might he fetch the true Promethian fire, That after-Ages should his Lines admire; Gathering the Honey from the choisest Flow'rs, Scorning the wither'd Weeds in Countrey Bow'rs. Here in this Garden (onely) springs the Rose, In ev'ry common Hedge the Bramble growes: Nor are we so turn'd Neapolitan, Mantuan, a Pastorall Poet, in one of his Eglogs bitterly inveyeth against Womankind; some of which, by the way of an Appendix, might be here inserted, seeing the fantasticke and insolent Humours of many of that Sexe, deserve much sharper Physicke, were it not, that they are growne wiser, then to amend for such an idle Poets speech as Mantuan, yea, or for Euripides himselfe, or Seneca's inflexible Hippolitus.That might incite some foule-mouth'd Mantuan, To all the World to lay out our defects, And have just cause to rayle upon our Sex; To pranke old Wrinckles up in new Attyre, To alter Natures course, prove Time a lyer, To abuse Fate, and Heav'ns just doome reverse, On Beauties Grave to set a Crimson Hearse; With a deceitfull Foile to lay a ground, To make a Glasse to seeme a Diamond: Nor cannot, without hazzard of our Name, In Fashion follow the Venetian Dame; Nor the fantasticke French to imitate, Attyr'd halfe Spanish, halfe Italionate; With Waste, nor Curle, Body nor Brow adorne, That is in Florence or in Genoa borne. But with vaine Boasts how witlesse fond am I, Thus to draw on mine owne Indignitie? And what though married when I was but yong, Before I knew what did to Love belong; Yet he which now's possessed of the roome, Crop'd Beauties flower when it was in the bloome, And goes away inriched with the store, Whilst others gleane, where he hath reap'd before: And he dares sweare, that I am true and just, And shall I then deceive his honest trust? Or what strange hope should make you to assaile, Where the strong'st Batt'rie never could prevaile? Belike you thinke, that I repuls'd the rest, To leave a King the conquest of my Brest, And have thus long preserv'd my selfe from all, To have a Monarch glory in my fall; Yet rather let me die the vildest death, Then live to draw that sinne-polluted breath. But our kind Hearts, Mens Teares cannot abide, And we least angry oft, when most we chide. Too well know Men what our Creation made us, And Nature too well taught them to invade us: They know but too well, how, what, when, and where, To write, to speake, to sue, and to forbeare, By signes, by sighes, by motions, and by teares, When Vowes should serve, when Oathes, when Smiles, when Pray'rs: What one Delight our Humors most doth move, Onely in that you make us nourish Love. If any naturall Blemish blot our Face, You doe protest, it gives our Beautie grace; And what Attyre we most are us'd to weare, That, of all other, excellent'st, you sweare: And if we walke, or sit, or stand, or lie, It must resemble some one Deitie; And what you know we take delight to heare, That are you ever sounding in our eare; And yet so shamelesse, when you tempt us thus, To lay the fault on Beautie and on us. Romes wanton Ovid did those Rules impart, O, that your Nature should be help'd with Art! Who would have thought, a King that cares to raigne, Inforc'd by Love, so Poet-like should faine? To say, that Beautie, Times sterne rage to shunne, In my Cheekes (Lillies) hid her from the Sunne; And when she meant to triumph in her May, Made that her East, and here she broke her Day: And that faire Summer still is in my sight, And but where I am, all the World is Night; As though the fair'st ere since the World began, To me, a Sunne-burnt base Egyptian. But yet I know more then I meane to tell, (O would to God you knew it not too well!) That Women oft their most admirers rayse, Though publiquely not flatt'ring their owne prayse. Our churlish Husbands, which our Youth injoy'd, Who with our Dainties have their stomacks cloy'd, Doe loath, our smooth Hands with their Lips to feele, T'inrich our Favours, by our Beds to kneele, At our Command to wait, to send, to goe, As ev'ry Houre our amorous servants doe; Which makes, a stolne Kisse often we bestow, In earnest of a greater good we owe: When he all day torments us with a Frowne, Yet sports with Venus in a Bed of Downe; Whose rude imbracement but too ill beseemes Her span-broad Waste, her white and daintie Limmes; And yet still preaching abstinence of Meat, When he himselfe of ev'ry Dish will eat. Blame you our Husbands then, if they denie Our publique Walking, our loose Libertie? If with exception still they us debarre Ovid, a most fit Author for so dissolute a Sectarie, calls that place, Chastities Shipwracke: for though Shores Wife wantonly plead for Libertie, which is the true humour of a Curtizan; yet much more is the prayse of Modestie, then of such Libertie. Howbeit, the Vestall Nunnes had Seats assigned them in the Roman Theatre: Whereby it should appeare, it was counted no impeachment to Modestie; though they offending therein, were buried quicke: A sharpe Law for them; who may say as Shores Wife doth: When though abroad restraining us to rome, They very hardly keepe us safe at home.The Circuit of the publique Theater; To heare the Poet in a Comick straine, Able t'infect with his lascivious Scene; And the young wanton Wits, when they applaud The slie perswasion of some subtill Bawd; Or passionate Tragedian, in his rage Acting a Love-sick Passion on the Stage: When though abroad restraining us to rome, They very hardly keepe us safe at home; And oft are touch'd with feare and inward griefe, Knowing rich Prizes soonest tempt a Thiefe? What Sports have we, whereon our Minds to set? Our Dogge, our Parrat, or our Marmuzet; Or once a weeke to walke into the field. Small is the pleasure that these Toyes do yeeld, But to this griefe a medicine you apply, To cure restraint with that sweet Libertie; And Soveraigntie (O that bewitching thing) Yet made more great, by promise of a King; And more, that Honour which doth most intice The holi'st Nunne, and she that's ne're so nice. Thus still we strive, yet overcome at length, For men want mercie, and poore women strength: Yet grant, that we could meaner men resist, When Kings once come, they conquer as they list. Thou art the cause, Shore pleaseth not my sight, That his embraces give me no delight; Thou art the cause I to my selfe am strange, Thy comming is my Full, thy Set my Change. Long Winter nights be minutes, if thou heere, Short minutes, if thou absent, be a yeere. And thus by strength thou art become my fate, And mak'st me love even in the mid'st of hate. FINIS. MARY, THE FRENCH QUEENE, TO CHARLES BRANDON, DUKE OF SUFFOLKE. The Argument. Henry the eight, firme friendship to unite With France, bestowes the Lady Mary bright, His younger sister, on King Lewes, then Being lame and aged; but she of all Men, Charles Brandon, Duke of Suffolke, most affected, One whom her Brother highly had respected, And had advanc'd: but scarsely had she beene Five months in France, when the brave beautious Queene Buried the old King; who no sooner dead, But she in Heart determining to wed Her long-lov'd Brandon, this Epistle writes, Who backe to her, the Answere soone indites. Such health from Heav'n my selfe may wish to mee, Such health from France Qu. Mary sends to thee. Brandon, how long mak'st thou excuse to stay, And know'st how ill we Women brooke delay? If one poore Channell thus can part us two, Tell me (unkind) what would an Ocean doe? Leander had an Hellespont to swim, Yet this from Hero could not hinder him; His Barke (poore Soule) his Brest, his Armes, his Oares, But thou a Ship, to land thee on our Shoares: And opposite to famous Kent, doth lie The pleasant Fields of flowrie Picardie, Where our faire Callice, walled in her Sands, In kenning of the Cliffie Dover stands. Here is no Beldam Nurse, to powt nor lowre, When wantoning, we revell in my Towre; Nor need I top my Turret with a Light, To guide thee to me, as thou swim'st by Night; Compar'd with me, wert thou but halfe so kind, Thy Sighs should stuffe thy Sayles, though wanting Wind: But thy Brest is becalm'd, thy Sighs be slacke, And mine too stiffe, and blow thy broad Sayles backe. But thou wilt say, that I should blame the Floud, Because the Wind so full against thee stood: Nay, blame it not, that it did roughly blow, For it did chide thee, for thou wast so slow; For it came not to keepe thee in the Bay, But came from me, to bid thee come away: But that thou vainely let'st occasion slide, Thou might'st have wafted hither with the Tide. If when thou com'st, I knit mine angry Brow, Blame me not, Brandon, thou hast broke thy Vow; Yet if I meant to frowne, I might be dumbe, For this may make thee stand in doubt to come: Nay come, sweet Charles, have care thy Ship to guide, Come, my sweet Heart, in faith I will not chide. When as my Brother and his lovely Queene, In sad attyre for my depart were seene, King Henry the eight, with the Queene and Nobles, in the sixt yeere of his Reigne, in the Moneth of September, brought this Ladie to Dover, where she tooke shipping for France.The utmost date expired of my stay, When I from Dover did depart away; Thou know'st what Woe I suff'red for thy sake, How oft I fain'd, of thee my leave to take; God and thou know'st, with what a heavie Heart I tooke my farewell, when I should depart; And being ship'd, gave signall with my Hand Up to the Cliffe, where I did see thee stand; Nor could refraine, in all the peoples view, But cryed to thee, Sweet Charles, adiew, adiew. Looke how a little Infant, that hath lost The thing wherewith it was delighted most, Wearie with seeking, to some corner creepes, And there (poore Soule) it sits it downe and weepes; And when the Nurse would faine content the mind, Yet still it mournes, for that it cannot find: Thus in my carefull Cabbin did I lye, When as the Ship out of the Road did flie. It was agreed and concluded betwixt Henry the seventh, and Philip, King of Castile, sonne to Maximilian the Emperour, That Charles, eldest sonne of the said Philip, should marrie the Lady Mary, daughter to King Henry, when they came to age: Which agreement was afterward, in the eight yeere of Henry the eight, annihilated.Think'st thou my Love was faithfull then to thee, When young Castile to England su'd for mee? Be judge thy selfe, if it were not of power, When I refus'd an Empire for my Dower. To Englands Court, when once report did bring, How thou in France didst revell with the King, Henry the eight, after the long Siege of Turney, which was delivered to him upon Composition, entred the Citie in Triumph, under a Canopie of Cloth of Gold, borne by foure of the Chiefe and most Noble Citizens; the King himselfe mounted upon a gallant Courser barbed with the Armes of England, France, and Ireland.When he in triumph of his victorie, Under a rich imbrod'red Canopie, Entred proud Tournay, which did trembling stand, To beg for mercie at his conqu'ring hand; To heare of his endeerements, how I joy'd? But see, this calme was suddenly destroy'd. The King being at Turney, there came to him the Prince of Castile, and the Lady Margaret, Duches of Savoy, his Sister, to whom King Henry gave great entertainment.When Charles of Castile there to banquet came, With him his sister, that ambitious Dame, Savoy's proud Duches, knowing how long she At this time there was speech of a Marriage to be concluded, betweene Charles Brandon, then Lord Lisle, and the Duches of Savoy; the Lord Lisle being highly favoured, and exceedingly beloved of the Duches.All meanes had try'd to winne my love from me; Fearing my absence might thy vowes acquite, To change thy Mary for a Margarite, The King caused a rich Tent of Cloth of Gold to be erected, where he feasted the Prince of Castile, and the Duches, and intertained them with sumptuous Maskes and Banquets, during their abode.When in King Henries Tent of Cloth of Gold, She often did thee in her armes enfold; Where you were feasted more deliciously, Then Cleopatra did Marke Anthony, Where sports all day did intertaine your sight, And then in Maskes you pass'd away the night. But thou wilt say, 'tis proper unto us, That we by nature all are jealous: “I must confesse 'tis oft found in our Sex, “But who not love, not any thing suspects: “True love doth looke with pale suspitions eye, “Take away love, if you take jealousie. Turwin and Turney when King Henry tooke, For this great change who then did ever looke? Maximilian the Emperour, with all his Souldiers, which served under King Henry, wore the Crosse of Saint George, with the Rose on their Brests.When Maximilian to those warres addrest, Ware Englands Crosse on his Imperiall brest, The blacke Eagle is the Badge Imperiall, which here is used for the displaying of his Ensigne, or Standard.And in our armie let his Eagle flie, Henry the eight, at his Warres in France, retained the Emperour and all his Souldiers in Wages, which served under him during those Warres.That view'd our Ensignes with a wond'ring eye, Little thought I when Bullen first was won, Wedlocke should end, what angry Warre begun. From which I vow, I yet am free in thought, Thomas Wolsey, the Kings Almoner, then Bishop of Lincolne, a Man of great Authoritie with the King, and afterward Cardinall, was the chiefe cause that this Lady Mary was married to the old French King, with whom the French had dealt under-hand, to befriend him in that Match.But this alone by Wolseies wit was wrought. To his advice the King gave free consent; That will I, nill I, I must be content. My Virgins right, thy state could not advance, But now enriched with the Dower of France; Then, but poore Suffolkes Duches had I beene, Now, the great Dowager, the most Christian Queene. But I perceive where all thy Griefe doth lie, Lewes of France had my Virginitie; He had indeed, but shall I tell thee what, Beleeve me, Brandon, he had scarcely that: Good feeble King, he could not doe much harme, But Age must needs have something that is warme; “Small drops (God knowes) doe quench that heatlesse fire, “When all the strength is onely in desire. And I could tell (if Modestie might tell) There's somewhat else that pleaseth Lovers well; To rest his Cheeke upon my softer Cheeke, Was all he had, and more he did not seeke; So might the little Baby clip the Nurse, And it content, she never a whit the worse: Then thinke this, Brandon, if that make thee frowne, For Maydenhead, he on my Head set a Crowne. Who would not change a Kingdome for a Kisse? Hard were the Heart that would not yeeld him this; And time yet halfe so swiftly doth not passe, Not yet full five moneths elder then I was. When thou to France conducted wast by Fame, With many Knights which from all Countries came, To see me at Saint Dennis on my Throne, Where Lewes held my Coronation; Francis, Duke of Valoys, and Dolphin of France, at the Marriage of the Lady Mary, in honour thereof proclaymed a Justs; where he chose the Duke of Suffolke and the Marques Dorset for his aides, at all Martiall Exercises.Where the proud Dolphin, for thy valour sake, Chose thee at Tilt his Princely part to take; When as the Staves upon thy Caske did light, Grieved therewith, I turn'd away my sight, And spake aloud, when I my selfe forgot, 'Tis my sweet Charles, my Brandon, hurt him not: But when I fear'd the King perceived this, Good silly Man, I pleas'd him with a Kisse, And to extoll his valiant Sonne began, That Europe never bred a braver Man; And when (poore King) he simply praysed thee, Of all the rest I ask'd which thou shouldst bee? Thus I with him dissembled for thy sake, Open confession now amends must make. Whilst this old King upon a Pallat lyes, And onely holds a combat with mine Eyes; Mine Eyes from his, by thy sight stolne away, Which might too well their Mistres Thoughts bewray. But when I saw thy proud unconquer'd Launce To beare the prize from all the flow'r of France; To see what pleasure did my Soule imbrace, Might eas'ly be discerned in my Face. Looke, as the Dew upon a Damaske Rose, How through that liquid pearle his blushing showes, And when the soft ayre breathes upon his top, From the sweet Leaves falls eas'ly drop by drop; Thus by my Cheeke, distilling from mine Eyes, One Teare for Joy anothers Roome supplyes. Before mine Eye (like Touch) thy shape did prove, Mine Eye condemn'd my too too partiall Love; But since by others I the same doe trie, My Love condemnes my too too partiall Eye. The precious stone, most beautifull and rare, When with it selfe we onely it compare, We deeme all other of that kind to be As excellent, as that we onely see; But when we judge of that, with others by, Too credulous we doe condemne our Eye, Which then appeares more orient, and more bright, Having a Foyle whereon to shew its light. Alanson, a fine timb'red Man, and tall, Yet wants the shape thou art adorn'd withall; Vandome good Carriage, and a pleasing Eye, Yet hath not Suffolk's Princely Majestie; Couragious Burbon, a sweet Manly Face, Yet in his Lookes lacks Brandons Courtly Grace. Proud Longavile suppos'd to have no Peere, A Man scarse made was thought, whilst thou wast here. County Saint-Paul, our best at Armes in France, Would yeeld himselfe a Squire, to beare thy Lance. This County Galeas, at the Justs ranne a Course with a Speare, which was at the Head five ynches square on every side, and at the But nine ynches square, whereby he shewed his wondrous force and strength. This Bounarme, a Gentleman of France, at the same time came into the field, armed at all points, with tenne Speares about him: in each Stirrop three, under each Thigh one, one under his left Arme, and one in his Hand; and putting his Horse to the Careere, never stopped him, till he had broken every Staffe. Hall. Galleas and Bounarme, matchlesse for their might, Under thy towring Blade have couch'd in fight. If with our Love my Brother angry bee, Ile say, to please him, I first fancied thee, And but to frame my liking to his mind, Never to thee had I beene halfe so kind. Worthy my Love, the vulgar judge no Man, Except a Yorkist, or Lancastrian; Nor thinke, that my affection should be set, But in the Line of great Plantaginet. I passe not what the idle Commons say, I pray thee Charles make haste, and come away. To thee what's England, if I be not there? Or what to me is France, if thou not here? Thy absence makes me angry for a while, But at thy presence I should gladly smile. When last of me, his leave my Brandon tooke, He sware an Oath (and made my Lips the Booke) He would make haste, which now thou do'st denie; Thou art forsworne: O wilfull Perjurie! Sooner would I with greater sinnes dispence, Then by intreatie pardon this Offence. But yet I thinke, if I should come to shrive thee, Great were the Fault that I should not forgive thee: Yet wert thou here, I should revenged bee, But it should be with too much loving thee. I, that is all that thou shalt feare to taste; I pray thee Brandon come, sweet Charles, make haste. CHARLES BRANDON, DUKE OF SUFFOLKE, TO MARY THE FRENCH QUEENE. But that my Faith commands me to forbeare, The fault's your owne, if I impatient were; Were my dispatch such as should be my speed, I should want time your loving Lines to reede. Here, in the Court, Camelion-like I fare, And as that Creature, onely feed on Ayre; All Day I wait, and all the Night I watch, And starve mine Eares, to heare of my dispatch. If Dover were th'Abydos of my Rest, Or pleasant Calice were my Maries Cest, You should not need, bright Queene, to blame me so, Did not the Distance, to Desire say no: No tedious Night from Travell should be free, Till through the Seas, with swimming still to thee, A Snowie Path I made unto thy Bay, So bright as is that Nectar-stayned Way. The restlesse Sunne by travelling doth weare, Passing his Course, to finish up the Yeare; But Paris lockes my Love within the Maine, And London yet thy Brandon doth detaine. Of thy firme love thou put'st me still in mind, But of my Faith, not one word can I find. The Duke of Longavile, which was Prisoner in England, upon the Peace to be concluded betweene England and France, was delivered, and married the Princesse Mary, for Lewes the French King, his Master.When Longavile to Mary was affy'd, And thou by him wast made King Lewes Bride, How oft I wish'd, that thou a Prize might'st bee, That I in Armes might combate him for thee! And in the madnesse of my love distraught, A thousand times his Murther have fore-thought: “But that th'all-seeing Pow'rs, which sit above, “Regard not Mad-mens Oathes, nor faults in Love, “And have confirm'd it, by the Grant of Heaven, “That Lovers sinnes on Earth should be forgiven; “For never Man is halfe so much distress'd, “As he that loves to see his Love possess'd. Comming to Richmond after thy depart, (Richmond, where first thou stol'st away my Heart) Me thought it look'd not as it did of late, But wanting thee, forlorne and desolate, In whose faire walkes thou often hast beene seene, To sport with Kath'rine, Henries beautious Queene, Astonishing sad Winter with thy sight, So that for thee the day hath put backe night; And the small Birds, as in the pleasant Spring, Forgot themselves, and have begun to sing. So oft as I by Thames goe and returne, Me thinkes for thee the River yet doth mourne, Whom I have seene to let his streame at large, Which like a hand-maide waited on thy Barge; And if thou hap'st against the floud to row, Which way it eb'd, it presently would flow, Weeping in drops upon the labouring Oares, For joy that it had got thee from the shoares. The Swans with musicke that the Roothers make, Ruffing their plumes, came gliding on the lake, As the swift Dolphins by Arions strings, Were brought to Land with Syren ravishings; The flockes and heards that pasture neere the Flood, To gaze upon thee, have forborne their food, And sat downe sadly mourning by the brim, That they by Nature were not made to swim. When as the Post to Englands Royall Court, Of thy hard passage brought the true report, As the Queene sayled for France, a mightie storme arose at Sea, so that the Navie was in great danger, and was severed, some driven upon the Coast of Flanders, some on Britaine: the Ship wherein the Queene was, was driven into the Haven at Bullen, with very great danger.How in a storme thy well-rigg'd Ships were tost, And thou thy selfe in danger to be lost, I knew 'twas Venus loath'd that aged Bed, Where Beautie so should be dishonoured; Or fear'd the Sea-Nymphs haunting of the Lake, If thou but seene, their Goddesse should forsake. And whirling round her Dove-drawne Coach about, To view the Navie then in lanching out, Her ayrie Mantle loosely doth unbinde. Which fanning forth a rougher gale of winde, Wafted thy Sayles with speed unto the land, And ran thy Ships on Bullins harboring strand. How should I joy of thy arrive to heare? But as a poore Sea-faring passenger, After long travaile, tempest-torne and wrack'd, By some unpitty'ng Pyrat that is sack'd; Heares the false robber that hath stolne his wealth, Landed in some safe harbour, and in health, Inrich'd with the invaluable store, For which he long had travailed before. King Lewes met her by Abvile, neere to the Forrest of Arders, and brought her into Abvile with great Solemnitie.When thou to Abvile held'st th'appointed day, We heard how Lewes met thee on the way; Where thou, in glitt'ring Tissue strangely dight, Expressing the sumptuous Attyre of the Queene and her Traine, attended by the chiefe of the Nobilitie of England, with sixe and thirtie Ladies, all in Cloth of Silver, their Horses trapped with Crimson Velvet.Appear'dst unto him like the Queene of Light; In Cloth of Silver, all thy Virgin Trayne, In Beautie sumptuous, as the Northerne Wayne; And thou alone the formost glorious Starre, Which led'st the Teame of that great Waggoner. What could thy Thought be, but as I did thinke, When thine Eyes tasted what mine Eares did drinke? King Lewes was a Man of great yeeres, troubled much with the Gowt, so that he had long time before little use of his Legges.A cripple King, layd Bedred long before, Yet at thy comming, crept out of the dore: 'Twas well he rid, he had no Legges to goe, But this thy Beautie forc'd his Body to; For whom a Cullice had more fitter beene, Then in a golden Bed, a gallant Queene. To use thy Beautie, as the Miser Gold, Which hoards it up but onely to behold; Still looking on it with a jealous Eye, Fearing to lend, yet loving Usurie: O Sacriledge (if Beautie be divine) The prophane Hand to touch the hallow'd Shrine! To surfet Sicknesse on the sound Mans Diet, To rob Content, yet still to live unquiet; And having all, to be of all beguil'd, And yet still longing like a little Child. The Duke of Suffolke, when the Proclamation came into England, of Justs to be holden in France, at Paris; he, for the Queenes sake, his Mistres, obtained of the King to goe thither: With whom, went the Marques Dorset, and his foure Brothers, the Lord Clinton, Sir Edward Nevill, Sir Giles Capell, Thomas Cheyney, which went all over with the Duke, as his Assistants.When Marques Dorset, and the valiant Grayes, To purchase Fame, first crost the narrow Seas, With all the Knights that my Associates went, In honour of thy Nuptiall Tournament; Think'st thou I joy'd not in thy Beauties pride, A true description of the Queenes entring into Paris, after her Coronation performed at S. Denis.When thou in Triumph didst through Paris ride? Where all the Streets, as thou didst pace along, With Arras, Bisse, and Tapistrie were hung; Ten thousand gallant Citizens prepar'd, In rich Attyre thy Princely selfe to guard: The Dukes of Alanson, Burbon, Vandome, Longavile, Suffolke, with five Cardinals.Next them, three thousand choise Religious Men, In golden Vestments follow'd on agen; And in Procession as they came along, With Hymeneus sang thy Marriage Song. Next these, five Dukes, as did their places fall, With each of them, a Princely Cardinall; Then thou, on thy Imperiall Chariot set, Crown'd with a rich impearled Coronet; Whilst the Parisian Dames, as thy Trayne past, Their precious Incense in abundance cast. As Cynthia, from her Wave-embattel'd Shrowds, Op'ning the West, comes streaming through the Clouds, With shining Troupes of Silver-tressed Starres, Attending on her, as her Torch-bearers; And all the lesser Lights about her Throne, With admiration stand as lookers on; Whilst she alone, in height of all her pride, The Queene of Light along her Sphere doth glide. When on the Tilt my Horse like Thunder came, No other Signall had I, but thy Name; Thy Voyce my Trumpet, and my Guide thine Eyes, And but thy Beautie, I esteem'd no Prize. Francis Valoys, the Dolphin of France, envying the glorie that the English Men had obtained at the Tilt, brought in an Almaine secretly, a Man thought almost of incomparable strength, which incountred Charles Brandon at the Barriers: but the Duke grappling with him, so beat him about the Head with the Pummell of his Sword, that the Bloud came out of the sight of his Caske.That large-lim'd Almaine, of the Giants Race, Which bare strength on his Brest, feare in his Face, Whose sinew'd Armes, with his steele-temper'd Blade, Through Plate and Male such open passage made, Upon whose Might the Frenchmens glorie lay, And all the hope of that victorious day; Thou saw'st thy Brandon beat him on his Knee, Off'ring his Shield a conquer'd Spoyle to thee. But thou wilt say, perhaps, I vainely boast, And tell thee that which thou alreadie know'st. No, sacred Queene, my Valour I denie, It was thy Beautie, not my Chivalrie: One of thy tressed Curles there falling downe, As loth to be imprisoned in thy Crowne, I saw the soft Ayre sportively to take it, And into strange and sundry formes to make it; Now parting it to foure, to three, to twaine, Now twisting it, then it untwist againe; Then make the threds to dally with thine Eye, A Sunnie Candle for a golden Flye. At length from thence one little teare it got, Which falling downe as though a Starre had shot, My up-turn'd Eye pursu'd it with my Sight, The which againe redoubled all my Might. 'Tis but in vaine, of my Descent to boast; When Heav'ns Lampe shines, all other Lights be lost; Faulcons seeme poore, the Eagle sitting by, Whose Brood surveyes the Sunne with open Eye: Sir William Brandon, Standard-bearer to the Earle of Richmond, (after, Henry the seventh) at Bosworth Field, a brave and gallant Gentleman, who was slaine by Richard there; this was Father to this Charles Brandon, Duke of Suffolke.Else might my Bloud find issue from his force, Who beat the Tyrant Richard from his Horse On Bosworth Plaine, whom Richmond chose to wield His glorious Ensigne in that conqu'ring Field; And with his Sword, in his deare Sov'raignes fight, To his last breath stood fast in Henries Right. Then, beautious Empresse, thinke this safe delay, Shall be the Even to a joyfull Day: “Fore-sight doth still on all advantage lye, “Wise-men must give place to necessitie; “To put backe ill, our good we must forbeare. “Better first feare, then after still to feare. 'Twere over-sight in that, at which we ayme, To put the Hazzard on an after-Game; With patience then let us our Hopes attend, And till I come, receive these Lines I send. FINIS. HENRY HOWARD, EARLE OF SURREY, TO THE LADY GERALDINE. The Argument. The Earle of Surrey, that renowned Lord, Th'old English Glory bravely that restor'd; That Prince, and Poet (a Name more divine) Falling in love with beautious Geraldine, Of the Geraldi, which derive their Name From Florence: whither, to advance her Fame, He travels, and in publique Justs maintayn'd Her Beautie peerelesse, which by Armes he gayn'd: But staying long, faire Italy to see, To let her know, him constant still to bee, From Tuskany this Letter to her writes; Which her Rescription instantly invites. Florence, a City of Tuscan, standing upon the river Arnus (celebrated by Dante, Petrarch, and other the most Noble Wits of Italie) was the originall of the Family, out of which, this Geraldine did spring, as Ireland the place of her birth, which is intimated by these Verses of the Earle of Surrey. From Tuscan came my Ladies worthy race, Faire Florence was sometimes her ancient seate, The Westerne Isle, whose pleasant shore doth face Wilde Cambers Cliffes, did give her lively heate. From learned Florence (long time rich in fame) From whence thy Race, thy noble grandsirs came, To famous England, that kind Nurse of mine, Thy Surrey sends to heav'nly Geraldine: Yet let not Tuscan thinke I doe it wrong, That I from thence write in my Native Tongue, That in these harsh-tun'd Cadences I sing, Sitting so neere the Muses sacred Spring; But rather thinke it selfe adorn'd thereby, That England reades the prayse of Italy. Though to the Tuscans I the smoothnesse grant, Our Dialect no Majestie doth want, To set thy praises in as high a Key, As France, or Spaine, or Germanie, or they. What day I quit the Fore-land of faire Kent, And that my Ship her course for Flanders bent, Yet thinke I with how many a heavy looke, My leave of England and of thee I tooke, And did intreate the Tide (if it might be) But to convey me one sigh backe to thee. Up to the Decke a Billow lightly skips, Taking my sigh, and downe againe it slips; Into the Gulfe, it selfe it headlong throwes, And as a Post to England-ward it goes. As I sate wondring how the rough Seas stird, I might farre off perceive a little Bird, Which as she faine from Shore to Shore would flie, Had lost her selfe in the broad vastie Skie, Her feeble Wing beginning to deceive her, The Seas of life still gaping to bereave her; Unto the Ship she makes, which she discovers, And there (poore foole) a while for refuge hovers; And when at length her flagging Pinnion failes, Panting she hangs upon the rattling Sailes, And being forc'd to loose her hold with paine, Yet beaten off, she straight lights on againe, And tos'd with flawes, with stormes, with wind, with weather, Yet still departing thence, still turneth thither: Now with the Poope, now with the Prow doth beare, Now on this side, now that, now here, now there: Me thinks these Stormes should be my sad depart; The silly helplesse Bird is my poore heart, The Ship, to which for succour it repaires, That is your selfe, regardlesse of my cares. Of every Surge doth fall, or Waves doth rise, To some one thing I sit and moralize. When for thy love I left the Belgicke Shore, Divine Erasmus, and our famous Moore, Whose happy presence gave me such delight, As made a minute of a Winters night; With whom a while I staid at Roterdame, Now so renowned by Erasmus name. Yet every houre did seeme a world of time, Till I had seene that sole-reviving Clime, And thought the foggie Netherlands unfit, A watry Soyle to clogge a fiery wit; And as that wealthy Germany I past, Comming unto the Emperours Court at last, Cornelius Agrippa, a man in his time so famous for Magicke (which the bookes published by him, concerning that argument, doe partly prove) as in this place needs no further remembrance. Howbeit, as those abstruse and gloomie Arts are but illusions: so in the honour of so rare a Gentleman as this Earle (and therewithall so Noble a Poet; a qualitie, by which his other Titles receive their greatest lustre) Invention may make somewhat more bolde with Agrippa above the barren truth.Great learn'd Agrippa, so profound in Art, Who the infernall secrets doth impart, When of thy health I did desire to know, Me in a Glasse my Geraldine did show, Sicke in thy Bed, and for thou could'st not sleepe, By a Waxe Taper set the Light to keepe; I doe remember thou did'st reade that Ode, Sent backe whil'st I in Thanet made abode, Where when thou cam'st unto that word of Love, Even in thine eyes I saw how passion strove; That Snowie Lawne which covered thy Bed, Me thought look'd white, to see thy Cheeke so red, Thy Rosie Cheeke oft changing in my sight, Yet still was red, to see the Lawne so white; The little Taper which should give thee light, Me thought wax'd dimme, to see thine Eye so bright; Thine Eye againe supply'd the Tapers turne, And with his Beames more brightly made it burne, The shrugging Ayre about thy Temples hurles, And wrapt thy Breath in little clowded curles, And as it did ascend, it straight did seaze it, And as it sunke, it presently did raise it; Canst thou by sicknesse banish beautie so? Which if put from thee, knowes not where to goe, To make her shift, and for her succour seeke, To every rivel'd Face, each bankrupt Cheeke. “If health preserv'd, thou Beautie still do'st cherish, “If that neglected, Beautie soone doth perish. Care drawes on Care, Woe comforts Woe againe, Sorrow breeds Sorrow, one Griefe brings forth twaine: If live or die, as thou do'st, so doe I, If live, I live, and if thou die, I die, One Heart, one Love, one Joy, one Griefe, one Troth, One Good, one Ill, one Life, one Death to both. If Howards bloud thou hold'st as but too vile, Or not esteem'st of Norfolk's Princely Stile, If Scotlands Coate no marke of Fame can lend, The blazon of the Howards Honourable Armour, was, Gules betweene sixe crosselets Fitchy a bend Argent, to which afterwards was added by atchievement, In the Canton point of the Bend, an escutcheon, or within the Scottish tressure, a Demi-lion-rampant Gules, &amp;c. as Master Camden, now Clerenceaux, from authoritie noteth. Never shall Time or bitter Envie be able to obscure the brightnesse of so great a Victorie as that, for which this addition was obtained. The Historian of Scotland, George Buchanan, reporteth, That the Earle of Surrey gave for his badge a Silver Lion (which from antiquitie belonged to that name) tearing in pieces A Lion prostrate Gules; and withall, that this which he termes insolence, was punished in him and his posteritie, as if it were fatall to the Conquerour, to doe his Soveraigne such Loyall service, as a thousand such severe censurers were never able to performe.That Lyon plac'd in our bright Silver bend, Which as a Trophy beautifies our Shield, The Battell was fought at Bramston, neere Floden Hill, being a part of the Cheviot, a Mountaine that exceedeth all the Mountaines in the North of England for bignesse; in which, the wilfull Perjurie of James the fifth was punished from Heaven by the Earle of Surrey, being left by King Henry the eight (then in France before Turwin) for the defence of his Realme.Since Scottish Bloud discolour'd Floden field; When the Proud Cheviot our brave Ensigne bare, As a Rich Jewell in a Ladyes Haire, And did faire Bramstons neighbouring Vallies choke With Clouds of Canons, fire-disgorged Smoke, Or Surreys Earledome insufficient be, And not a Dower so well contenting thee; Yet am I one of great Apollo's Heires, The sacred Muses challenge me for theirs. By Princes, my immortall Lines are sung, My flowing Verses grac'd with ev'ry Tongue; The little Children when they learne to goe, By painefull Mothers daded to and fro, Are taught my sugred Numbers to rehearse, And have their sweet Lips season'd with my Verse. When Heav'n would strive to doe the best it can, And put an Angels Spirit into a Man, The utmost pow'r it hath, it then doth spend, When to the World a Poet it doth intend. That little diff'rence 'twixt the Gods and us, (By them confirm'd) distinguish'd onely thus: Whom they, in Birth, ordaine to happy dayes, The Gods commit their glory to our prayse; T'eternall Life when they dissolve their breath, We likewise share a second Pow'r by Death. When Time shall turne those Amber Lockes to Gray, My Verse againe shall guild and make them gay, And tricke them up in knotted Curles anew, And to thy Autumne give a Summers hiew; That sacred Pow'r that in my Inke remaines, Shall put fresh Bloud into thy wither'd Veines, And on thy Red decay'd, thy Whitenesse dead, Shall set a White, more White, a Red, more Red: When thy dimme Sight thy Glasse cannot descry, Nor thy craz'd Mirrour can discerne thine Eye; My Verse, to tell th'one what the other was, Shall represent them both, thine Eye and Glasse: Where both thy Mirrour and thine Eye shall see, What once thou saw'st in that, that saw in thee; And to them both shall tell the simple truth, What that in purenesse was, what thou in youth. If Florence once should lose her old renowne, As famous Athens, now a Fisher-Towne; My Lines for thee a Florence shall erect, Which great Apollo ever shall protect, And with the Numbers from my Penne that falls, Bring Marble Mines, to re-erect those Walls. Of the Beautie of that Lady, he himselfe testifies, in an Elegie which he writ of her, refusing to dance with him, which he seemeth to allegorize under a Lion and a Wolfe. And of himselfe he saith: A Lion saw I late, as white as any Snow. And of her, I might perceive a Wolfe, as white as a Whales Bone, A fairer Beast, of fresher hue, beheld I never none, But that her Lookes were coy, and froward was her Grace.Nor beautious Stanhope, whom all Tongues report To be the glory of the English Court, Shall by our Nation be so much admir'd, If ever Surrey truely were inspir'd. Sir Thomas Wyat the elder, a most excellent Poet, as his Poems extant doe witnesse; besides certaine Encomions, written by the Earle of Surrey, upon some of Davids Psalmes, by him translated: What holy Grave, what worthy Sepulchre, To Wyats Psalmes shall Christians purchase then? And afterward, upon his Death, the said Earle writeth thus: What vertues rare were temp'red in thy Brest? Honour that England, such a Jewell bred, And kisse the Ground whereas thy Corps did rest.And famous Wyat, who in Numbers sings, To that inchanting Thracian Harpers strings, To whom Phœbus (the Poets God) did drinke A Bowle of Nectar, fill'd up to the Brinke; And sweet-tongu'd Bryan (whom the Muses kept, And in his Cradle rockt him whilst he slept) In sacred Verses (most divinely pen'd) Upon thy prayses ever shall attend. What time I came into this famous Towne, And made the cause of my Arrivall knowne, Great Medices a List (for Triumphs) built; Within the which, upon a Tree of Gilt, (Which was with sundry rare Devices set) I did erect thy lovely Counterfet, To answere those Italian Dames desire, Which dayly came thy Beautie to admire: By which, my Lion, in his gaping Jawes Held up my Lance, and in his dreadfull Pawes Reacheth my Gauntlet unto him that dare A Beautie with my Geraldines compare. Which, when each Manly valiant Arme assayes, After so many brave triumphant dayes, The glorious Prize upon my Lance I bare, By Heralds voyce proclaym'd to be thy share; The shiver'd Staves, here for thy Beautie broke, With fierce encounters past at ev'ry shocke, When stormie Courses answer'd Cuffe for Cuffe, Denting proud Bevers with the Counter-buffe, Upon an Altar, burnt with holy Flame, I sacrific'd, as Incense to thy Fame: Where, as the Phœnix from her spiced fume Renues her selfe, in that she doth consume; So from these sacred Ashes live we both, Ev'n as that one Arabian Wonder doth. When to my Chamber I my selfe retire, Burnt with the Sparkes that kindled all this fire, Thinking of England, which my Hope containes, The happie Ile where Geraldine remaines; It is manifest by a Sonnet, written by this Noble Earle, that the first time he beheld his Lady, was at Hunsdon: Hunsdon did first present her to mine Eyne. Which Sonnet being altogether a description of his Love, I doe alledge in divers places of this Glosse, as proofes of what I write.Of Hunsdon, where those sweet celestiall Eyne At first did pierce this tender Brest of mine; That he injoyed the presence of his faire and vertuous Mistres in those two places, by reason of Queene Katherines usuall aboad there (on whom this Lady Geraldine was attending) I prove by these Verses of his: Hampton me taught to wish her first for mine, Windsor (alas) doth chase me from her sight. And in another Sonnet following: When Windsor Walls sustain'd my wearied Arme, My Hand, my Chin, to ease my restlesse Head. And that his Delight might draw him to compare Windsor to Paradise, an Elegie may prove; where he remembreth his passed Pleasures in that place. With a Kings sonne my childish yeeres I pass'd, In greater Feasts then Priams sonne of Troy. And againe in the same Elegie: Those large greene Courts, where we were wont to rove, With Eyes cast up unto the Maidens Tower, With easie sighes, such as Men draw in love. And againe in the same: The stately Seats, the Ladies bright of hue, The Dances short, long Tales of sweet Delight. And for the pleasantnesse of the place, these Verses of his may testifie, in the same Elegie before recited: The secret Groves which we have made resound, With silver drops the Meads yet spred for ruth.Of Hampton Court, and Windsor, where abound All pleasures that in Paradise were found; Neere that faire Castle is a little Grove, With hanging Rocks all cover'd from above, Which on the Banke of goodly Thames doth stand, Clipt by the Water from the other Land, Whose bushie Top doth bid the Sunne forbeare, And checks his proud Beames, that would enter there; Whose Leaves still mutt'ring, as the Ayre doth breathe, With the sweet bubbling of the Streame beneath, Doth rocke the Senses (whilst the small Birds sing) Lulled asleepe with gentle murmuring; Where light-foot Fayries sport at Prison-Base, (No doubt there is some Pow'r frequents the place) There the soft Poplar and smooth Beech doe beare Our Names together carved ev'ry where, And Gordian Knots doe curiously entwine The Names of Henry and of Geraldine. O, let this Grove in happy times to come, Be call'd, The Lovers bless'd Elizium; Whither my Mistres wonted to resort, In Summers heat, in those sweet shades to sport: A thousand sundry Names I have it given, And call'd it, Wonder-hider, Cover-Heaven, The Roofe where Beautie her rich Court doth keepe, Under whose compasse all the Starres doe sleepe. There is one Tree, which now I call to minde, Doth beare these Verses carved in his Rinde: When Geraldine shall sit in thy faire shade, Fanne her sweet Tresses with perfumed Aire, Let thy large Boughes a Canopie be made, To keepe the Sunne from gazing on my Faire; And when thy spreading branched Armes be sunke, And thou no Sap nor Pith shalt more retaine, Ev'n from the dust of thy unweldie Trunke, I will renue thee Phœnix-like againe, And from thy dry decayed Root will bring A new-borne Stem, another Æsons Spring. I find no cause, nor judge I reason why, My Countrey should give place to Lumbardy; I had thought, in this place, not to have spoken of Thames, being so oft remembred by me before, in sundry other places, on this occasion: but thinking of that excellent Epigram, which, as I judge, eyther to be done by the said Earle, or Sir Francis Brian; for the worthinesse thereof, I will here insert: which, as it seemes to me, was compyled at the Authors being in Spaine. Tagus, farewell, which Westward with thy Streames Turn'st up the graines of Gold, alreadie try'de, For I with Spur and Sayle goe seeke the Thames, Against the Sunne that shewes his wealthie pride, And to the Towne that Brutus sought by Dreames, Like bended Moone, that leanes her lustie side, To seeke my Countrey now, for whom I live, O mightie Jove, for this the Windes me give.As goodly flow'rs on Thamesis doe grow, As beautifie the Bankes of wanton Po; As many Nymphs as haunt rich Arnus strand, By silver Severne tripping hand in hand: Our shade's as sweet, though not to us so deere, Because the Sunne hath greater power there: This distant place doth give me greater woe; Farre off, my Sighes the farther have to goe. Ah absence! why thus should'st thou seeme so long? Or wherefore should'st thou offer Time such wrong, Summer so soone to steale on Winters Cold, Or Winters Blasts so soone make Summer old? Love did us both with one-selfe Arrow strike, Our Wound's both one, our Cure should be the like; Except thou hast found out some meane by Art, Some pow'rfull Med'cine to withdraw the dart; But mine is fixt, and absence being proved, It stickes too fast, it cannot be removed. Adiew, adiew, from Florence when I goe, By my next Letters Geraldine shall know, Which if good fortune shall by course direct, From Venice by some messenger expect; Till when, I leave thee to thy hearts desire, By him that lives thy vertues to admire. THE LADY GERALDINE, TO HENRY HOWARD, EARLE OF SURREY. Such greeting as the Noble Surrey sends, The like to thee thy Geraldine commends; A Maidens thoughts do check my trembling hand, On other Termes or Complements to stand, Which (might my Speech be as my Heart affords) Should come attyred in farre richer Words: But all is one, my Faith as firme shall prove, As hers that makes the greatest shew of Love. In Cupid's Schoole I never read those Bookes, Whose Lectures oft we practise in our Lookes, Nor ever did suspitious rivall Eye Yet lye in wait my Favours to espie; My Virgin Thoughts are innocent and meeke, As the chaste Blushes sitting on my Cheeke: As in a Feaver, I doe shiver yet, Since first my Pen was to the Paper set. If I doe erre, you know my Sexe is weake, Feare proves a Fault, where Maids are forc'd to speake. Doe I not ill? Ah sooth me not herein; O, if I doe, reprove me of my sinne: Chide me in faith, or if my Fault you hide, My Tongue will teach my selfe, my selfe to chide. Nay, Noble Surrey, blot it if thou wilt, Then too much Boldnesse should returne my Guilt: For that should be ev'n from our selves conceal'd, Which is disclos'd, if to our Thoughts reveal'd; For the least Motion, more the smallest Breath, That may impeach our Modestie, is Death. The Page that brought thy Letters to my hand, (Me thinkes) should marvell at my strange demand: For till he blush'd, I did not yet espie The nakednesse of my Immodestie, Which in my Face he greater might have seene, But that my Fanne I quickly put betweene; Yet scarcely that my inward Guilt could hide, “Feare seeing all, feares it of all is spy'd. Like to a Taper lately burning bright, But wanting matter to maintaine his Light; The Blaze ascending, forced by the smoke, Living by that which seekes the same to choke; The Flame still hanging in the Ayre, doth burne, Untill drawne downe, it backe againe returne: Then cleare, then dim, then spreadeth, and then closeth, Now getteth strength, and now his brightnesse loseth; As well the best discerning Eye may doubt, Whether it yet be in, or whether out: Thus in my Cheeke my sundry Passions shew'd, Now ashie pale, and now againe it glow'd. If in your Verse there be a pow'r to move, It's you alone, who are the cause I love; It's you bewitch my Bosome, by mine Eare; Unto that end I did not place you there: Ayres to asswage the bloudie Souldiers mind, Poore Women, we are naturally kind. Perhaps you'le thinke, that I these termes inforce, For that in Court this kindnesse is of course; Or that it is that Honey-steeped Gall, We oft are said to bait our Loves withall; That in one Eye we carrie strong desire, In th'other, drops, which quickly quench that fire. Ah, what so false can Envie speake of us, But it shall find some vainely credulous? I doe not so, and to adde proofe thereto, I love in faith, in faith, sweet Lord I doe; Nor let the envie of invenom'd Tongues, Which still is grounded on poore Ladies Wrongs, Thy Noble Brest disasterly possesse, By any doubt to make my love the lesse. My House from Florence I doe not pretend, Nor from those Geralds clayme I to descend; Nor hold those Honours insufficient are, That I receive from Desmond, or Kildare: Nor adde I greater worth unto my Bloud, Then Irish Milke to give me Infant-food; Nor better Ayre will ever boast to breathe, Then that of Lemster, Munster, or of Meath; Nor crave I other forraine farre Allies, The cost of many Kings, which from time to time have adorned the Castle at Windsor with their Princely Magnificence, hath made it more Noble, then that it need to be spoken of now, as though obscure; and I hold it more meet, to referre you to our vulgar Monuments, for the Founders and Finishers thereof, then to meddle with matter nothing neere the purpose. As for the Family of the Fitz-Geralds, of whence this excellent Lady was lineally descended, the originall was English, though the Branches did spread themselves into distant Places, and Names nothing consonant, as in former times it was usuall to denominate themselves of their Manours, or Fore-names: as may partly appeare in that which ensueth; the light whereof proceeded from my learned and very worthie Friend, Master Francis Thinne. Walter of Windsor, the sonne of Oterus, had to issue William, of whom, Henry, now Lord Windsor, is descended, and Robert of Windsor, of whom, Robert, the now Earle of Essex, and Gerald of Windsor, his third sonne, who married the daughter of Rees, the great Prince of Wales, of whom came Nesta, Paramour to Henry the first: Which Gerald had Issue, Maurice Fitz-Gerald, Ancestor to Thomas Fitz-Maurice, Justice of Ireland, buried at Trayly; leaving Issue, John his eldest sonne, first Earle of Kildare, Ancestor to Geraldine, and Maurice his second sonne, first Earle of Desmond.Then Windsor's, or Fitz-Gerald's Families: It is enough to leave unto my Heires, If they but please t'acknowledge me for theirs. To what place ever did the Court remove, But that the House gives matter to my Love? At Windsor still I see thee sit, and walke, There mount thy Courser, there devise, there talke; The Robes, the Garter, and the state of Kings, Into my Thoughts thy hoped Greatnesse brings: None-such, the Name imports (me thinkes) so much, None such as it, nor as my Lord, none such; In Hamptons great Magnificence I find The lively Image of thy Princely Mind; Faire Richmonds Tow'rs like goodly Trophies stand, Rear'd by the pow'r of thy victorious Hand; White-Halls triumphing Galleries are yet Adorn'd with rich Devices of thy Wit; In Greenwich still, as in a Glasse, I view, Where last thou bad'st thy Geraldine adiew: With ev'ry little perling breath that blowes, How are my Thoughts confus'd with Joyes and Woes; As through a Gate, so through my longing Eares Passe to my Heart whole multitudes of Feares. O, in a Map that I might see thee show The place where now in danger thou do'st goe! Whilst we discourse, to travell with our Eye Romania, Tuscan, and faire Lumbardy; Or with thy Pen exactly to set downe The Modell of that Temple, or that Towne; And to relate at large where thou hast beene, As there, and there, and what thou there hast seene: Expressing in a Figure, by thy Hand, How Naples lyes, how Florence faire doth stand; Or as the Grecians finger dip'd in Wine, Drawing a River in a little Line, And with a drop, a Gulfe to figure out, To modell Venice, moted round about; Then adding more, to counterfet a Sea, And draw the Front of stately Genoa. These from thy Lips were like harmonious Tones, Which now doe sound like Mandrakes dreadfull Grones. Some travell hence, t'inrich their Minds with Skill, Leave here their Good, and bring home others Ill; Which seeme to like all Countries but their owne, Affecting most, where they the least are knowne; Their Leg, their Thigh, their Back, their Neck, their Head, As they had beene in sev'rall Countries bred; In their Attyre, their Gesture, and their Gate, Found in each one, in all Italionate; So well in all deformitie in fashion, Borrowing a Limbe of ev'ry sev'rall Nation; And nothing more then England hold in scorne, So live as Strangers whereas they were borne: But thy returne in this I doe not reade, Thou art a perfect Gentleman indeed; O God forbid that Howards Noble line, From ancient Vertue should so farre decline; The Muses traine (whereof you selfe are chiefe) Onely to me participate their griefe: To sooth their humors, I doe lend them eares. “He gives a Poet, that his Verses heares. Till thy returne, by hope they only live; Yet had they all, they all away would give: The world and they, so ill according be, That wealth and Poets never can agree. Few live in Court that of their good have care, The Muses friends are every-where so rare; Some praise thy Worth (that it did never know,) Onely because the better sort doe so, Whose judgement never further doth extend, Then it doth please the greatest to commend; So great an ill upon desert doth chance, When it doth passe by beastly ignorance. Why art thou slacke, whilst no man puts his hand Alluding to the sumptuous House which was afterward builded by him upon Leonards Hill, right against Norwich; which, in the Rebellion of Norfolke, under Ket, in King Edward the sixts time, was much defaced by that impure Rabble. Betwixt the Hill and the Citie, as Alexander Nevel describes it, the River of Yarmouth runnes, having West and South thereof, a Wood, and a little Village, called Thorpe, and on the North, the Pastures of Mousholl, which containe about six miles in length and breadth. So, that besides the stately greatnesse of Mount-Surrey, which was the Houses Name, the Prospect and Sight thereof was passing pleasant and commodious; and no where else did that increasing evill of the Norfolke Furie enkennell it selfe then, but there, as it were for a manifest token of their intent, to debase all high things, and to prophane all holy.To raise the mount where Surrey's Towers must stand? Or who the groundsill of that worke doth lay, Whilst like a Wand'rer thou abroad do'st stray, Clip'd in the Armes of some lascivious Dame, When thou shouldst reare an Ilion to thy Name? When shall the Muses by faire Norwich dwell, To be the Citie of the learned Well? Or Phœbus Altars there with Incense heap'd, As once in Cyrrha, or in Thebe kept? Or when shall that faire hoofe-plow'd Spring distill From great Mount-Surrey, out of Leonards hill? Till thou returne, the Court I will exchange For some poore Cottage, or some Country Grange, Where to our Distaves, as we sit and Spin, My Maide and I will tell what things have bin, Our Lutes unstrung shall hang upon the Wall, Our Lessons serve to wrap our Towe withall, And passe the Night, whiles Winter tales we tell, Of many things, that long agoe befell; Or tune such homely Carrols as were sung In Country sport, when we our selves were yong, In pretty Riddles to bewray our Loves, In questions, purpose, or in drawing Gloves. The Noblest Spirits, to Vertue most inclin'd, These here in Court thy greatest want doe find; Others there be, on which we feed our Eye, Such was he whom Juvenal taxeth in this manner: ? Truncoque simillimus Herme Nullo quippe alio vincis discrimine, quam quod Illi marmoreum caput est, tua vivit Imago. Seeming to be borne for nothing else but Apparell, and the outward appearance, intituled Complement: with whom, the ridiculous Fable of the Ape in Æsope sorteth fitly; who comming into a Carvers house, and viewing many Marble Workes, tooke up the Head of a Man, very cunningly wrought: who greatly, in praysing, did seeme to pittie it, that having so comely an out-side, it had nothing within; like emptie Figures, walke and talke in every place: at whom, the Noble Geraldine modestly glanceth.Like Arras-worke, or such like Imagerie: Many of us desire Queene Kath'rines state, But very few her Vertues imitate. Then, as Ulysses Wife, write I to thee, Make no reply, but come thy selfe to mee. FINIS. THE LADY JANE GRAY, TO THE LORD GILFORD DUDLEY. The Argument. Edward the sixt his timelesse Life bereft; (Though doubtfully) yet his Dominion left To his Sister Mary: but by Henry Gray, Then Duke of Suffolke, bearing mightie sway, With the Consent, and by the pow'rfull Hand Of John, the stout Duke of Northumberland, His fourth sonne Gilford Dudley, they affy'd To faire Jane Gray, which by the Mothers side Some Title claym'd: this Marriage them betweene, The Lady Jane was here proclaymed Queene. But Mary soone prevayling by her Pow'r, Causes those two preserved in the Tow'r, There to be prison'd; where, their blame to quite, They each to other these Epistles write. Mine owne deare Lord, sith thou art lock'd from me, In this disguise my love must steale to thee, Since to renue all Loves, all Kindnesse past, This Refuge scarcely left, yet this the last. My Keeper comming, I of thee inquire, Who with thy greeting answeres my desire; Which my Tongue willing to returne againe, Griefe stops my words, and I but strive in vaine: Wherewith amaz'd, away in haste he goes, When through my Lips my Heart thrusts forth my Woes. But then the Dores that make a dolefull sound, Drive backe my Words, that in the noyse are drown'd, Which somewhat hush'd, the Eccho doth record, And twice or thrice reiterates my Word; When like an adverse Winde in Isis course, Against the Tide bending his boistrous force; But when the Floud hath wrought it selfe about, He following on, doth head-long thrust it out; Thus strive my Sighes with Teares e're they begin, And breaking out, againe Sighes drive them in. A thousand formes present my troubled thought, Yet prove abortive e're they forth are brought. “The depth of Woe with words we hardly sound, “Sorrow is so insensibly profound. As Teares doe fall and rise, Sighes come and goe, So doe these numbers ebbe, so doe they flow. These briny Teares doe make my Incke looke pale, My Incke clothes Teares in this sad mourning vale, The letters mourners, weepe with my dim Eye, The Paper pale, griev'd at my miserie. Yet miserable our selves why should we deeme, Sith none are so, but in their owne esteeme? “Who in distresse from resolution flies, “Is rightly said, to yeeld to miseries. Shewing the ambition of the two Dukes, their Fathers, whose pride was the cause of the utter overthrow of their Children.They which begot us, did beget this Sinne, They first begun, what did our griefe beginne, We tasted not, 'twas they which did rebell, (Not our offence) but in their fall we fell; They which a Crowne would to my Lord have linck'd, All hope of Life and Libertie extinct; A Subject borne, a Soveraigne to have beene, Hath made me now, nor Subject, nor a Queene. Ah vile Ambition, how dost thou deceive us, Which shew'st us Heav'n, and yet in Hell dost leave us? “Seldome untouch'd doth Innocence escape, “When Errour commeth in good Counsels shape, “A lawfull title countercheckes proud Might, “The weakest things become strong props to right. Then my deare Lord, although affliction grieve us, Yet let our spotlesse Innocence relieve us. “Death but an acted passion doth appeare, “Where truth gives Courage, and the Conscience cleare. And let thy comfort thus consist in mine, That I beare part of whatsoe're is thine; As when we liv'd untouch'd with these disgraces, When as our Kingdome was our deare embraces; The Lord Gilford Dudley, fourth sonne to John Dudley, Duke of Northumberland, married the Lady Jane Gray, daughter to the Duke of Suffolke, at Durham House in the Strand.At Durham Palace, where sweet Hymen sang, Whose Buildings with our Nuptiall Musike rang: When Prothalamions prays'd that happie day, Wherein great Dudley match'd with Noble Gray, When they devis'd to linke by Wedlocks Band, The House of Suffolke to Northumberland; Our fatall Dukedome to your Dukedome bound, To frame this Building on so weake a Ground. For what avayles a lawlesse Usurpation, Which gives a Scepter, but not rules a Nation? Onely the surfet of a vaine Opinion: “What gives Content, gives what exceeds Dominion. Presently upon the death of King Edward, the Lady Jane was taken as Queene, conveyed by Water to the Tower of London, for her safetie, and after proclaymed in divers parts of the Realme, as so ordained by King Edwards Letters Patents, and his Will.When first mine Eares were pierced with the Fame Of Jane, proclaymed by a Princes Name, A sudden fright my trembling Heart appalls: “The feare of Conscience entreth yron Walls. Thrice happy for our Fathers had it beene, If what we fear'd, they wisely had fore-seene, And kept a meane gate, in an humble Path, To have escap'd the Heav'ns impetuous Wrath. The true-bred Eagle strongly stems the Wind, And not each Bird resembling their brave Kind; He like a King, doth from the Clouds command The fearefull Fowle, that move but neere the Land. Though Mary be from mightie Kings descended, My Bloud not from Plantaginet pretended; Henry Gray, Duke of Suffolke, married Francis, the eldest daughter of Charles Brandon, Duke of Suffolke, by the French Queene; by which Francis, he had this Lady Jane: This Mary, the French Queene, was daughter to King Henry the seventh, by Elizabeth his Queene; which happie Marriage conjoyned the two Noble Families of Lancaster and Yorke.My Grandsire Brandon did our House advance, By Princely Mary, Dowager of France; The Fruit of that faire Stocke, which did combine, And York's sweet Branch with Lancaster's entwine, And in one Stalke did happily unite The pure Vermillion Rose, and purer White; I, the untimely Slip of that rich Stem, Whose golden Bud brings forth a Diadem. But oh, forgive me Lord, it is not I, Nor doe I boast of this, but learne to die: Whilst we were as our selves, conjoyned then, Nature to Nature, now an Alien. “To gaine a Kingdome, who spares their next Blood? “Neerenesse contemn'd, if Sov'raigntie withstood. “A Diadem once dazeling the Eye, “The day too darke to see Affinitie; “And where the Arme is stretch'd to reach a Crowne, “Friendship is broke, the dearest things throwne downe: Noting the distrust that King Henry the eight ever had in the Princesse Mary, his daughter, fearing she should alter the state of Religion in the Land, by matching with a Stranger, confessing the Right that King Henries Issue had to the Crowne.For what great Henry most strove to avoid, The Heav'ns have built, where Earth would have destroy'd. And seating Edward on his Regall Throne, He gives to Mary all that was his owne, By Death assuring what by Life is theirs, The Lawfull claime of Henries lawfull heires. By mortall Lawes the bond may be divorc'd, But Heavens decree by no meanes can be forc'd: That rules the case, when men have all decreed, Who tooke him hence foresaw who should succeed, For we in vaine relie on humane Lawes, When Heaven stands forth to pleade the righteous cause, Thus rule the Skies in their continuall course, That yeelds to Fate, that doth not yeeld to force. “Mans wit doth build for Time but to devoure, “But Vertue's free from Time and Fortunes pow'r. Then, my kinde Lord, sweet Gilford, be not griev'd, The Soule is Heavenly, and from Heaven reliev'd; And as we once have plighted Troth together, Now let us make exchange of Mindes to either; To thy faire brest take my resolved Minde, Arm'd against blacke Despaire, and all her kinde, Into my bosome breathe that Soule of thine, There to be made as perfect as is mine; So shall our Faiths as firmely be approved, As I of thee, or thou of me beloved. This Life, no Life, wert thou not deare to me, Nor this no Death, were I not woe for thee. Thou my deare Husband, and my Lord before, But truely learne to Die, thou shalt be more. Now live by Prayer, on Heaven fixe all thy thought, And surely finde, what e're by zeale is sought; For each good motion that the Soule awakes, A Heavenly figure sees, from whence it takes That sweet Resemblance, which by power of kinde, Formes (like it selfe) an Image in the minde, And in our Faith the operations bee, Of that Divinenesse which through that we see; Which never erres, but accidentally, By our fraile Fleshes imbecillity; By each Temptation over-apt to slide, Except our Spirit becomes our bodies guide; For as these Towers our bodies doe enclose, So our Soules prisons verily are those; Our bodies, stopping that Celestiall light, As these doe hinder our exterior sight; Whereon Death seazing, doth discharge the debt, And us at blessed Libertie doth set. Then draw thy Forces all up to thy Heart, The strongest Fortresse of this Earthly part, And on these three let thy assurance lye, On Faith, Repentance, and Humilitie; By which, to Heav'n ascending by degrees, Persist in Prayer upon your bended Knees: Whereon if you assuredly be stay'd, You need in Perill not to be dismay'd, Which still shall keepe you, that you shall not fall, For any Perill that can you appall: The Key of Heav'n thus with you, you shall beare, And Grace you guiding, get you entrance there; And you of those Celestiall Joyes possesse, Which mortall Tongue's unable to expresse. Then thanke the Heav'n, preparing us this Roome, Crowning our Heads with glorious Martyrdome, Before the blacke and dismall dayes begin, The dayes of all Idolatrie and Sinne; Not suff'ring us to see that wicked Age, When Persecution vehemently shall rage; When Tyrannie new Tortures shall invent, To inflict Vengeance on the Innocent. Yet Heav'n forbid, that Maries Wombe should bring Englands faire Scepter to a forraine King; A Prophesie of Queene Maries Barrennesse, and of the happie and glorious Raigne of Queene Elizabeth; her restoring of Religion, the abolishing of the Romish Servitude, and casting aside the Yoke of Spaine.But she to faire Elizabeth shall leave it, Which broken, hurt, and wounded shall receive it: And on her Temples having plac'd the Crowne, Root out the dregges Idolatry hath sowne; And Sions glory shall againe restore, Laid ruine, waste, and desolate before; And from blacke Sinders, and rude heapes of Stones, Shall gather up the Martyrs sacred Bones; And shall extirpe the Pow'r of Rome againe, And cast aside the heavie Yoke of Spaine. Farewell, sweet Gilford, know our End is neere, Heav'n is our Home, we are but strangers heere: Let us make haste to goe unto the Blest, Which from these wearie Worldly Labours rest. And with these Lines, my dearest Lord, I greet thee, Untill in Heav'n thy Jane againe shall meet thee. GILFORD DUDLEY TO THE LADY JANE GRAY. As the Swan singing at his dying How'r, So I reply from my impris'ning Tow'r: O, could there be that pow'r but in my Verse, T'expresse the Griefe which my sad Heart doth pierce! The very Walls that straitly thee inclose, Would surely weepe at reading of my woes; Let your Eyes lend, Ile pay you every Teare, And give you int'rest, if you doe forbeare, Drop for a Drop, and if youle needs have Lone, I will repay you frankely, two for one. Perhaps you'le thinke (your sorrowes to appease) That words of comfort fitter were then these. True, and in you when such perfection liveth, As in most griefe, me now most comfort giveth: But thinke not (Jane) that cowardly I faint, To begge mans mercy by my sad complaint, That Death so much my courage can controule, At the departing of my living soule. For if one life a thousand lives could bee, All those too few to consummate with thee, When thou this Crosse so patiently doest beare, As if thou wert incapable of feare, And doest no more this dissolution flie, Then if long Age constrained thee to die. Yet it is strange thou art become my Foe, And only now add'st most unto my woe; Not that I loath what most did me delight, But that so long deprived of thy sight: For when I speake and would complaine my wrong, Straight-wayes thy Name possesseth all my Tong, As thou before me evermore didst lie The present Object to my longing eie. No ominous Starre did at thy Birth-tide shine That might of thy sad destinie divine; 'Tis only I that did thy fall perswade, And thou by me a Sacrifice art made, As in those Countries, where the loving Wives With their kind Husbands end their happy Lives, And crown'd with Garlands, in their Brides attyre, Burne with his Body, in the Fun'rall fire; And she the worthiest reck'ned is of all, Whom least the Perill seemeth to appall. I boast not of Northumberlands great Name, John, Duke of Northumberland, when before he was Earle of Warwicke, in his Expedition against Ket, overthrew the Rebels of Norfolke and Suffolke, incamped at Mount-Surrey in Norfolke.(Nor of Ket conquer'd, adding to our Fame) When he to Norfolke with his Armies sped, And thence in Chaynes the Rebels captive led, And brought safe Peace returning to our Dores, Yet spred his Glory on the Easterne Shores; Gilford Dudley, as remembring in this place the towardnesse of his Brothers, which were all likely indeed to have raysed that House of the Dudleyes, of which he was a fourth Brother, if not suppressed by their Fathers Overthrow.Nor of my Brothers, from whose naturall Grace Vertue may spring, to beautifie our Race; Noting in this place the Alliance of the Lady Jane Gray by her Mother, which was Francis, the daughter of Charles Brandon, by Mary the French Queene, daughter to Henry the seventh, and sister to Henry the eight.Nor of Grayes Match, my Children borne by thee, Of the great Bloud undoubtedly to bee: But of thy Vertue onely doe I boast, That wherein I, may justly glory most. I crav'd no Kingdomes, though I thee did crave, It me suffic'd, thy onely selfe to have: Yet let me say, how ever it befell, Me thinkes a Crowne should have becom'd thee well; For sure thy Wisedome merited (or none) Seldome hath it ever beene knowne of any Woman indued with such wonderfull gifts, as was this Lady, both for her Wisdome and Learning: Of whose skill in the Tongues, one reporteth by this Epigram; Miraris Janam Graio sermone valere? Quo primum nata est tempore Graia fuit.To have beene heard with Wonder from a Throne. When from thy Lips the counsell to each deed, Doth as from some wise Oracle proceed; And more esteem'd thy Vertues were to mee, Then all that else might ever come by thee: So chaste thy Love, so innocent thy Life, As being a Virgin when thou wert a Wife; So great a Gift the Heav'n on me bestow'd, As giving that, it nothing could have ow'd: Such was the Good I did possesse of late, Ere Worldly Care disturb'd our quiet state; Ere Trouble did in ev'ry place abound, And angry Warre our former Peace did wound. But to know this, Ambition us affords, “One Crowne is guarded with a thousand Swords; “To meane estates, meane Sorrowes are but showne, “But Crownes have Cares, whose workings be unknowne. The Duke of Northumberland prepared his Power at London, for his Expedition against the Rebels in Norfolke, and making haste away, appointed the rest of his Forces to meet him at New-Market Heath: of whom, this saying is reported, That passing thorow Shore-ditch, the Lord Gray in his companie, seeing the People in great numbers came to see him, he said; The People presse to see us, but none bid God speed us.When Dudley led his Armies to the East, Of our whole Forces gen'rally possest, What then was thought his Enterprise could let, John Dudley, Duke of Northumberland, when hee went out against Queene Mary, had his Commission sealed for the Generalship of the Armie, by the consent of the whole Councell of the Land: insomuch, that passing thorow the Councell-Chamber at his departure, the Earle of Arundel wished, That he might have gone with him in that Expedition, and to spend his Bloud in the Quarrell.Whom a grave Councell freely did abet, That had the Judgement of the pow'rfull Lawes, In ev'ry Point to justifie the Cause? The holy Church a helping hand that laide, Who would have thought that these could not have swaide? But what alas can Parlaments availe, Where Maries right must Edwards acts repeale? The Suffolke men were the first that ever resorted to Queene Marie in her Distresse, repayring to her Succours, whilest shee remayned both at Keningall, and at Fremingham Castle, still increasing her Aides, untill the Duke of Northumberland was left forsaken at Cambridge.When Suffolks power doth Suffolks hopes withstand, Northumberland doth leave Northumberland; And they that should our Greatnesse undergoe, Us, and our actions only overthrow. Ere greatnesse gain'd, we give it all our heart, But being once come, wee wish it would depart, And indiscreetly follow that so fast, Which overtaken punisheth our haste; If any one doe pitty our offence, Let him be sure that he be farre from hence: Here is no place for any one that shall So much as (once) commiserate our fall: And we of mercy vainely should but thinke, Our timelesse Teares th'insatiate earth doth drinke. All lamentations utterly forlorne, Dying before they fully can be borne. Mothers that should their wofull Children rue, Fathers in death to kindly bid adue, Friends their deare farewell lovingly to take, The faithfull Servant weeping for our sake; Brothers and Sisters waiting on our Beere, Mourners to tell what wee were living heere: But we (alas) deprived are of all, So fatall is our miserable fall. And where at first for safety we were shut Now in darke Prison wofully are put, And from the height of our ambitious state, Lie to repent our arrogance too late. To thy perswasion thus I then replie; Hold on thy course resolved still to die, And when we shall so happily be gone, Leave it to heaven to give the rightfull Throne, And with that health regreet I thee againe, Which I of late did gladly entertaine. FINIS. A CATALOGUE OF THE HEROICALL LOVES. The World's faire Rose, and Henries frosty fire, John's tyranny, and chaste Matilda's wrong, Th'inraged Queene, and furious Mortimer, The Scourge of France, and his chaste Love I sung, Deposed Richard, Isabel exil'd, The gallant Tudor, and faire Katherine, Duke Humphrey, and old Cobhams haplesse Child, Couragious Poole, and that brave spiritfull Queene, Edward, and the delicious London Dame, Brandon, and that rich Dowager of France, Surrey, with his faire Paragon of Fame, Dudley's Mis-hap, and vertuous Gray's Mischance: Their sev'rall Loves since I before have showne, Now give me leave, at last, to sing mine owne. FINIS. IDEA. IN SIXTIE THREE SONNETS. BY Michael Drayton, ESQVIRE. TO THE READER OF THESE SONNETS. Into these Loves, who but for Passion lookes, At this first sight, here let him lay them by, And seeke else-where, in turning other Bookes, Which better may his labour satisfie. No farre-fetch'd Sigh shall ever wound my Brest, Love from mine Eye a Teare shall never wring, Nor in Ah-mees my whyning Sonnets drest, (A Libertine) fantastickly I sing: My Verse is the true image of my Mind, Ever in motion, still desiring change; And as thus to Varietie inclin'd, So in all Humors sportively I range: My Muse is rightly of the English straine, That cannot long one Fashion intertaine. 1 [Like an adventurous Sea-farer am I] Like an adventurous Sea-farer am I, Who hath some long and dang'rous Voyage beene, And call'd to tell of his Discoverie, How farre he sayl'd, what Countries he had seene, Proceeding from the Port whence he put forth, Shewes by his Compasse, how his Course he steer'd, When East, when West, when South, and when by North, As how the Pole to ev'ry place was rear'd, What Capes he doubled, of what Continent, The Gulphes and Straits, that strangely he had past, Where most becalm'd, where with foule Weather spent, And on what Rocks in perill to be cast? Thus in my Love, Time calls me to relate My tedious Travels, and oft-varying Fate. 2 [My heart was slaine, and none but you and I] My heart was slaine, and none but you and I: Who should I thinke the Murther should commit? Since, but your selfe, there was no Creature by, But onely I, guiltlesse of murth'ring it. It slew it selfe; the Verdict on the view Doe quit the dead, and me not accessarie: Well, well, I feare it will be prov'd by you, Th'evidence so great a proofe doth carrie. But O, see, see, we need inquire no further, Upon your Lips the scarlet drops are found, And in your Eye, the Boy that did the Murther, Your Cheekes yet pale, since first he gave the Wound. By this I see, how-ever things be past, Yet Heav'n will still have Murther out at last. 3 [Taking my Penne, with Words to cast my Woe] Taking my Penne, with Words to cast my Woe, Duely to count the summe of all my cares, I finde, my Griefes innumerable growe, The reck'nings rise to millions of Despaires, And thus dividing of my fatall Houres, The paiments of my Love, I read, and crosse, Substracting, set my Sweets unto my Sowres, My Joyes arrerage leades me to my losse; And thus mine Eies a debtor to thine Eye, Which by Extortion gaineth all their lookes, My heart hath paid such grievous Usurie, That all their Wealth lies in thy beauties Bookes, And all is Thine which hath been due to Me, And I a Bankrupt, quite undone by Thee. 4 [Bright starre of Beauty, on whose eye-lids sit] Bright starre of Beauty, on whose eye-lids sit A thousand Nimph-like and inamor'd Graces, The Goddesses of Memory and Wit, Which there in order take their severall places, In whose deare Bosome, sweet delicious Love Layes downe his Quiver, which he once did beare: Since he that blessed Paradise did prove, And leaves his Mothers lap to sport him there, Let others strive to entertaine with Words, My Soule is of a braver Mettle made, I hold that vile, which Vulgar wit affords; In Me's that Faith which Time cannot invade. Let what I praise, be still made good by you: Be you most worthy, whilst I am most true. 5 [Nothing but No and I, and I and No] Nothing but No and I, and I and No, How fals it out so strangely you reply? I tell yee (Faire) ile not be answered so, With this affirming No, denying I. I say, I Love, you sleightly answere I: I say, You Love, you peule me out a No: I say, I Die, you Eccho me with I: Save mee I Crie, you sigh me out a No; Must Woe and I, have naught but No and I? No I, am I, if I no more can have; Answere no more, with Silence make reply, And let me take my selfe what I doe crave, Let No and I, with I and you be so: Then answere No and I, and I and No. 6 [How many paltry, foolish, painted things] How many paltry, foolish, painted things, That now in Coaches trouble ev'ry Street, Shall be forgotten, whom no Poet sings, Ere they be well wrap'd in their winding Sheet? Where I to thee Eternitie shall give, When nothing else remayneth of these dayes, And Queenes hereafter shall be glad to live Upon the Almes of thy superfluous prayse; Virgins and Matrons reading these my Rimes, Shall be so much delighted with thy story, That they shall grieve, they liv'd not in these Times, To have seene thee, their Sexes onely glory: So shalt thou flye above the vulgar Throng, Still to survive in my immortall Song. 7 [Love, in a Humor, play'd the Prodigall] Love, in a Humor, play'd the Prodigall, And bad my Senses to a solemne Feast; Yet more to grace the Company withall, Invites my Heart to be the chiefest Ghest: No other Drinke would serve this Gluttons turne, But precious Teares distilling from mine Eyne, Which with my Sighes this Epicure doth burne, Quaffing Carowses in this costly Wine; Where, in his Cups o'rcome with foule Excesse, Straightwayes he play's a swagg'ring Ruffins part, And at the Banquet, in his Drunkennesse, Slew his deare Friend, my kind and truest Heart: A gentle warning (Friends) thus may you see, What 'tis to keepe a Drunkard companie. 8 [There's nothing grieves me, but that Age should haste] There's nothing grieves me, but that Age should haste, That in my dayes I may not see thee old, That where those two cleare sparkling Eyes are plac'd, Onely two Loope-holes, then I might behold. That lovely, arched, yvorie, pollish'd Brow, Defac'd with Wrinkles, that I might but see; Thy daintie Hayre, so curl'd, and crisped now, Like grizzled Mosse upon some aged Tree; Thy Cheeke, now flush with Roses, sunke, and leane, Thy Lips, with age, as any Wafer thinne, Thy Pearly Teeth out of thy Head so cleane, That when thou feed'st, thy Nose shall touch thy Chinne: These Lines that now thou scorn'st, which should delight thee, Then would I make thee read, but to despight thee. 9 [As other Men, so I my selfe doe Muse] As other Men, so I my selfe doe Muse, Why in this sort I wrest Invention so, And why these giddy Metaphors I use, Leaving the Path the greater part doe goe; I will resolve you; I am Lunaticke, And ever this in Mad-men you shall finde, What they last thought of, when the Braine grew sicke, In most distraction they keepe that in Minde. Thus talking idly in this Bedlam fit, Reason and I (you must conceive) are twaine, Tis nine yeeres now since first I lost my Wit, Beare with Me then, though troubled be my Braine; With Diet and Correction, Men distraught, (Not too farre past) may to their Wits be brought. 10 [To nothing fitter can I Thee compare] To nothing fitter can I Thee compare, Then to the Sonne of some rich Penny-father, Who having now brought on his end with Care, Leaves to his Sonne all he had heap'd together; This new rich Novice, lavish of his chest, To one Man gives, doth on another spend, Then heere he riots, yet amongst the rest, Haps to lend some to one true honest Friend. Thy Gifts thou in Obscuritie doest waste, False Friends thy kindnesse, borne but to deceive Thee; Thy Love, that is on the unworthy plac'd, Time hath thy Beautie, which with Age will leave thee; Onely that little which to Me was lent, I give Thee backe, when all the rest is spent. 11 [You not alone, when You are still alone] You not alone, when You are still alone, O God from You, that I could private be, Since You one were, I never since was one, Since You in Me, my selfe since out of Me, Transported from my Selfe, into Your being, Though either distant, present yet to either, Senselesse with too much Joy, each other each other seeing, And onely absent, when Wee are together. Give Me my Selfe, and take your Selfe againe, Devise some meanes, but how I may forsake You, So much is Mine, that doth with You remaine, That taking what is Mine, with Me I take You; You doe bewitch Me, O that I could flie, From my Selfe You, or from your owne Selfe I. 12 [That learned Father, which so firmely proves] That learned Father, which so firmely proves To the Soule. The Soule of Man immortall and divine, And doth the sev'rall Offices define: AnimaGives her that Name, as she the Body moves, AmorThen is she Love, imbracing Charitie, AnimusMoving a Will in us, it is the Mind, MensRetayning Knowledge, still the same in kind; MemoriaAs intellectuall, it is Memorie, RatioIn judging, Reason onely is her Name, SensusIn speedie apprehension, it is Sense, ConscientiaIn Right or Wrong, they call her Conscience, SpiritusThe Spirit, when it to God-ward doth inflame: These of the Soule the sev'rall Functions bee, Which my Heart, lightned by thy Love, doth see. 13 [Letters and Lines we see are soone defaced] Letters and Lines we see are soone defaced, To the Shadow. Metals doe waste, and fret with Cankers Rust, The Diamond shall once consume to Dust, And freshest Colours with foule staynes disgraced: Paper and Inke can paint but naked Words, To write with Bloud, of force offends the Sight; And if with Teares I find them all too light, And Sighes and Signes a silly Hope affords, O sweetest Shadow, how thou serv'st my turne! Which still shalt be, as long as there is Sunne; Nor whilst the World is, never shall be done, Whilst Moone shall shine, or any Fire shall burne: That ev'ry thing whence Shadow doth proceed, May in his Shadow my Loves storie read. 14 [If he, from Heav'n that filch'd that living Fire] If he, from Heav'n that filch'd that living Fire, Condemn'd by Jove to endlesse Torment bee, I greatly marvell, how you still goe free, That farre beyond Prometheus did aspire: The Fire he stole, although of Heav'nly kind, Which from above he craftily did take, Of livelesse Clods, us living Men to make, He did bestow in temper of the Mind. But you broke into Heav'ns immortall store, Where Vertue, Honour, Wit, and Beautie lay; Which taking thence, you have escap'd away, Yet stand as free as ere you did before: Yet old Prometheus punish'd for his Rape. Thus poore Theeves suffer, when the greater scape. 15 [Since to obtaine thee, nothing me will sted] Since to obtaine thee, nothing me will sted, His Remedie for Love. I have a Med'cine that shall cure my Love, The powder of her Heart dry'd, when she is dead, That Gold nor Honour ne'r had pow'r to move; Mix'd with her Teares, that ne'r her true-Love crost, Nor at Fifteene ne'r long'd to be a Bride, Boyl'd with her Sighes, in giving up the Ghost, That for her late deceased Husband dy'd; Into the same then let a Woman breathe, That being chid, did never word replie, With one thrice-marry'd's Pray'rs, that did bequeath A Legacie to stale Virginitie. If this Receit have not the pow'r to winne me, Little Ile say, but thinke the Devill's in me. 16 ['Mongst all the Creatures in this spacious Round] 'Mongst all the Creatures in this spacious Round, An Allusion to the Phœnix. Of the Birds kind, the Phœnix is alone, Which best by you, of living Things, is knowne; None like to that, none like to you is found: Your Beautie is the hot and splend'rous Sunne, The precious Spices be your chaste Desire, Which being kindled by that heav'nly fire, Your Life so like the Phœnix's begun; Your selfe thus burned in that sacred flame, With so rare sweetnesse all the Heav'ns perfuming, Againe increasing, as you are consuming, Onely by dying, borne the very same: And wing'd by Fame, you to the Starres ascend, So you of Time shall live beyond the End. 17 [Stay, speedy Time, behold, before thou passe] Stay, speedy Time, behold, before thou passe, To Time. From Age to Age, what thou hast sought to see, One, in whom all the Excellencies be, In whom, Heav'n lookes it selfe as in a Glasse: Time, looke thou too, in this Tralucent Glasse, And thy Youth past, in this pure Mirrour see, As the World's Beautie in his Infancie, What it was then, and thou before it was; Passe on, and to Posteritie tell this, Yet see thou tell, but truly, what hath beene: Say to our Nephewes, that thou once hast seene, In perfect humane shape, all heav'nly Blisse; And bid them mourne, nay more, despaire with thee, That she is gone, her like againe to see. 18 [To this our World, to Learning, and to Heaven] To this our World, to Learning, and to Heaven, To the Celestiall Numbers. Three Nines there are, to every one a Nine, One number of the Earth, the other both Divine, One Woman now, makes three odde Numbers even; Nine orders first of Angels be in Heaven, Nine Muses doe with Learning still frequent, These with the Gods are ever resident; Nine worthie Women to the World were given: My worthy, One to these Nine Worthies addeth, And my faire Muse, one Muse unto the Nine, And my good Angell (in my Soule divine) With one more Order, these nine Orders gladdeth: My Muse, my Worthy, and my Angel then, Makes every One of these three Nines a Ten. 19 [You cannot love, my prettie Heart, and why?] You cannot love, my prettie Heart, and why? To Humour. There was a time, You told Me that you would, But now againe You will the same denie, If it might please You, would to God You could; What, will You hate? nay that You will not neither, Nor Love, nor Hate, how then? what will You doe? What will You keepe a meane then betwixt either? Or will You love Me, and yet hate Me too? Yet serves not This: what next, what other Shift? You Will, and Will not, what a coyle is here? I see Your craft, now I perceive Your drift, And all this while, I was mistaken there: Your Love and Hate is this, I now doe prove You, You love in Hate, by Hate to make Me love You. 20 [An evill spirit your beautie haunts Me still] An evill spirit your beautie haunts Me still, Where with (alas) I have beene long possest, Which ceaseth not to tempt Me to each Ill, Nor gives Me once, but one poore minutes rest: In Me it speakes, whether I Sleepe or Wake, And when by Meanes, to drive it out I try, With greater Torments, then it Me doth take, And tortures Me in most extremity; Before my Face, it layes downe my Despaires, And hastes Me on unto a sudden Death; Now tempting Me, to drowne my Selfe in teares, And then in sighing, to give up my breath; Thus am I still provok'd, to every Evill, By this good wicked Spirit, sweet Angell Devill. 21 [A witlesse Gallant, a young Wench that woo'd] A witlesse Gallant, a young Wench that woo'd, (Yet his dull Spirit her not one jot could move) Intreated me, as e'r I wish'd his good, To write him but one Sonnet to his Love: When I, as fast as e'r my Penne could trot, Powr'd out what first from quicke Invention came; Nor never stood one word thereof to blot, Much like his Wit, that was to use the same: But with my Verses he his Mistres wonne, Who doted on the Dolt beyond all measure. But see, for you to Heav'n for Phraze I runne, And ransacke all Apollo's golden Treasure; Yet by my Froth, this Foole his Love obtaines, And I lose you, for all my Wit and Paines. 22 [With Fooles and Children good Discretion beares] With Fooles and Children good Discretion beares; To Folly. Then honest People, beare with Love and Me, Nor older yet, nor wiser made by yeeres, Amongst the rest of Fooles and Children be: Love still a Baby, playes with Gawdes and Toyes, And like a Wanton, sports with ev'ry Fether; And Ideots still are running after Boyes, Then Fooles and Children fitt'st to goe together: He still as young as when he first was borne, No wiser I, then when as young as he. You that behold us, laugh us not to scorne, Give Nature thankes, you are not such as we: Yet Fooles and Children sometimes tell in play, Some wise in shew, more Fooles indeed then they. 23 [Love banish'd Heav'n, in Earth was held in scorne] Love banish'd Heav'n, in Earth was held in scorne, Wand'ring abroad in Need and Beggerie; And wanting Friends, though of a Goddesse borne, Yet crav'd the Almes of such as passed by: I, like a Man devout, and charitable, Clothed the Naked, lodg'd this wand'ring Ghest, With Sighes and Teares still furnishing his Table, With what might make the Miserable blest. But this ungratefull, for my good desert, Intic'd my Thoughts, against me to conspire, Who gave consent to steale away my Heart, And set my Brest, his Lodging, on a fire. Well, well, my Friends, when Beggers grow thus bold, No marvell then though Charitie grow cold. 24 [I heare some say, this Man is not in love] I heare some say, this Man is not in love: Who? can he love? a likely thing, they say; Reade but his Verse, and it will eas'ly prove. O, judge not rashly (gentle Sir) I pray, Because I loosely trifle in this sort, As one that faine his Sorrowes would beguile: You now suppose me all this time in sport, And please your selfe with this Conceit the while; Yee shallow Censures, sometime see yee not, In greatest Perils some Men pleasant be, Where Fame by Death is onely to be got, They resolute? so stands the case with me; Where other Men in depth of Passion crie, I laugh at Fortune, as in jest to die. 25 [O, why should Nature niggardly restraine!] O, why should Nature niggardly restraine! That Foraine Nations rellish not our Tongue, Else should my Lines glide on the Waves of Rhene, And crowne the Piren's with my living Song: But bounded thus, to Scotland get you forth, Thence take you Wing unto the Orcades, There let my Verse get glory in the North, Making my Sighes to thaw the Frozen Seas; And let the Bards within that Irish Ile, To whom my Muse with fierie Wings shall passe, Call backe the stiffe-neck'd Rebels from Exile, And mollifie the slaught'ring Galliglasse; And when my flowing Numbers they rehearse, Let Wolves and Beares be charmed with my Verse. 26 [I ever love, where never Hope appeares] I ever love, where never Hope appeares, To Despaire. Yet Hope drawes on my never-hoping Care, And my Lives Hope would die, but for Despaire. My never-certaine Joy breeds ever-certaine Feares, Uncertaine Dread gives Wings unto my Hope; Yet my Hopes Wings are laden so with Feare, As they cannot ascend to my Hope's Sphere; Though Feare gives them more then a Heav'nly Scope, Yet this large Roome is bounded with Despaire, So my Love is still fett'red with vaine Hope, And Liberty deprives him of his Scope, And thus am I imprison'd in the Aire: Then, sweet Despaire, awhile hold up thy head, Or all my Hope for Sorrow will be dead. 27 [Is not Love here, as 'tis in other Clymes] Is not Love here, as 'tis in other Clymes, And diff'reth it, as doe the sev'rall Nations? Or hath it lost the Vertue, with the Times, Or in this Iland alt'reth with the Fashions? Or have our Passions lesser pow'r then theirs, Who had lesse Art them lively to expresse? Is Nature growne lesse pow'rfull in their Heires, Or in our Fathers did she more transgresse? I am sure my Sighes come from a Heart as true, As any Mans, that Memory can boast, And my Respects and Services to you Equall with his, that loves his Mistres most: Or Nature must be partiall in my Cause, Or onely you doe violate her Lawes. 28 [To such as say, Thy Love I over-prize] To such as say, Thy Love I over-prize, And doe not sticke to terme my Prayses folly; Against these Folkes, that thinke themselves so wise, I thus oppose my Reasons forces wholly: Though I give more then well affords my state, In which expence, the most suppose me vaine, Which yeelds them nothing, at the easiest rate, Yet at this price returnes me treble gaine. They value not, unskilfull how to use, And I give much, because I gaine thereby: I that thus take, or they that thus refuse, Whether are these deceived then, or I? In ev'ry thing I hold this Maxim still, The Circumstance doth make it good, or ill. 29 [When conqu'ring Love did first my Heart assayle] When conqu'ring Love did first my Heart assayle, To the Senses. Unto mine aid I summon'd ev'ry Sense, Doubting, if that proud Tyrant should prevayle, My Heart should suffer for mine Eyes Offence; But he with Beautie first corrupted Sight, My Hearing brib'd with her Tongues Harmonie, My Taste by her sweet Lips drawne with Delight, My Smelling wonne with her Breath's Spicerie: But when my Touching came to play his part, (The King of Senses, greater then the rest) He yeelds Love up the Keyes unto my Heart, And tells the other, how they should be blest. And thus by those of whom I hop'd for ayd, To cruell Love my Soule was first betray'd. 30 [Those Priests which first the Vestall Fire begun] Those Priests which first the Vestall Fire begun, To the Vestals. Which might be borrow'd from no Earthly flame, Devis'd a Vessell to receive the Sunne, Being stedfastly opposed to the same: Where, with sweet Wood, layd curiously by Art, On which the Sunne might by reflection beat, Receiving strength from ev'ry secret part, The Fuell kindled with Celestiall Heat. Thy blessed Eyes, the Sunne which lights this Fire, My holy Thoughts, they be the Vestall flame, The precious Odors be my chaste Desire, My Brest's the Vessell, which includes the same: Thou art my Vesta, thou my Goddesse art, Thy hallow'd Temple onely is my Heart. 31 [Me thinkes I see some crooked Mimicke jeere] Me thinkes I see some crooked Mimicke jeere, To the Criticke. And taxe my Muse with this fantasticke Grace, Turning my Papers, askes, What have we heere? Making withall some filthy Antike Face. I feare no censure, nor what thou canst say, Nor shall my Spirit one jot of vigour lose. Think'st thou, my Wit shall keepe the pack-Horse Way, That ev'ry Dudgen low Invention goes? Since Sonnets thus in Bundles are imprest, And ev'ry Drudge doth dull our satiate Eare; Think'st thou my Love shall in those Ragges be drest, That ev'ry Dowdy, ev'ry Trull doth weare? Up, to my Pitch, no common Judgement flyes, I scorne all Earthly Dung-bred Scarabies. 32 [Our Flouds-Queen Thames, for Ships &amp; Swans is crowned] Our Flouds-Queen Thames, for Ships &amp; Swans is crowned, To the River Ankor. And stately Severne for her Shoare is praysed, The Crystall Trent, for Foords and Fish renowned, And Avons Fame, to Albions Cliffes is raysed, Carlegion Chester vaunts her holy Dee, Yorke many Wonders of her Owse can tell, The Peake her Dove, whose Bankes so fertile be, And Kent will say, her Medway doth excell, Cotswold commends her Isis to the Tame, Our Northerne Borders boast of Tweeds faire Floud, Our Westerne Parts extoll their Wilis Fame, And the old Lea brags of the Danish Bloud; Ardens sweet Ankor, let thy glory bee, That faire Idea onely lives by thee. 33 [Whilst yet mine Eyes doe surfet with Delight] Whilst yet mine Eyes doe surfet with Delight, To Imagination. My wofull Heart, imprison'd in my Brest, Wisheth to be transformed to my Sight, That it, like those, by looking might be blest: But whilst mine Eyes thus greedily doe gaze, Finding their Objects over-soone depart, These now the others Happinesse doe prayse, Wishing themselves, that they had beene my Heart; That Eyes were Heart, or that the Heart were Eyes, As covetous the others use to have: But finding Nature their request denyes, This to each other mutually they crave; That since the one cannot the other bee, That Eyes could thinke of that my Heart could see. 34 [Marvell not, Love, though I thy pow'r admire] Marvell not, Love, though I thy pow'r admire, To Admiration. Ravish'd a World beyond the farthest Thought, And knowing more then ever hath beene taught, That I am onely starv'd in my desire; Marvell not, Love, though I thy pow'r admire, Ayming at things exceeding all perfection, To Wisedome's selfe to minister direction, That I am onely starv'd in my desire; Marvell not, Love, though I thy pow'r admire, Though my Conceit I further seeme to bend, Then possibly Invention can extend, And yet am onely starv'd in my desire: If thou wilt wonder, here's the wonder, Love, That this to me doth yet no wonder prove. 35 [Some misbeleeving, and prophane in Love] Some misbeleeving, and prophane in Love, To Miracle. When I doe speake of Miracles by thee, May say, that thou art flattered by mee, Who onely write, my skill in Verse to prove; See Miracles, ye unbeleeving, see, A dumbe-borne Muse made to expresse the Mind, A cripple Hand to write, yet lame by Kind, One by thy Name, the other touching thee; Blind were mine Eyes, till they were seene of thine, And mine Eares deafe, by thy Fame healed bee, My Vices cur'd, by Vertues sprung from thee, My Hopes reviv'd, which long in Grave had lyne: All uncleane Thoughts, foule Spirits cast out in mee, Onely by Vertue that proceeds from thee. 36 [Thou purblind Boy, since thou hast beene so slacke] Thou purblind Boy, since thou hast beene so slacke, Cupid conjured. To wound her Heart, whose Eyes have wounded me, And suff'red her to glory in my Wracke, Thus to my aid, I lastly conjure thee; By Hellish Styx (by which the Thund'rer sweares) By thy faire Mothers unavoided Power, By Hecat's Names, by Proserpine's sad Teares, When she was rapt to the infernall Bower; By thine owne loved Psyches, by the Fires Spent on thine Altars, flaming up to Heav'n; By all true Lovers Sighes, Vowes, and Desires, By all the Wounds that ever thou hast giv'n; I conjure thee by all that I have nam'd, To make her love, or Cupid be thou damn'd. 37 [Deare, why should you command me to my Rest] Deare, why should you command me to my Rest, When now the Night doth summon all to sleepe? Me thinkes this Time becommeth Lovers best; Night was ordayn'd, together Friends to keepe: How happy are all other living Things, Which though the Day dis-joyne by sev'rall flight, The quiet Ev'ning yet together brings, And each returnes unto his Love at Night? O, Thou that art so courteous else to all! Why should'st thou, Night, abuse me onely thus, That ev'ry Creature to his kind do'st call, And yet 'tis thou do'st onely sever us? Well could I wish, it would be ever Day, If when Night comes, you bid me goe away. 38 [Sitting alone, Love bids me goe and write] Sitting alone, Love bids me goe and write; Reason plucks back, commanding me to stay, Boasting, that she doth still direct the way, Or else Love were unable to indite: Love growing angry, vexed at the Spleene, And scorning Reason's maymed Argument, Straight taxeth Reason, wanting to invent, Where she with Love conversing hath not beene; Reason reproched with this coy Disdaine, Despiteth Love, and laugheth at her Folly; And Love contemning Reasons reason wholly, Thought it in weight too light by many a Graine: Reason put back, doth out of sight remove, And Love alone picks reason out of love. 39 [Some, when in Ryme, they of their Loves doe tell] Some, when in Ryme, they of their Loves doe tell, With Flames and Lightnings their Exordiums paint, Some call on Heaven, some invocate on Hell, And Fates and Furies, with their woes acquaint, Elizium is too high a seate for Me, I will not come in Stix or Phlegeton, The thrice-three Muses but too wanton be, Like they that Lust, I care not, I will none. Spightfull Erinnis frights Me with her Lookes, My man-hood dares not with foule Ate mell, I quake to looke on Hecat's charming Bookes, I still feare Bug-beares in Apollo's Cell. I passe not for Minerva, nor Astrea, Onely I call on my divine Idea. 40 [My Heart the Anvile, where my Thoughts doe beate] My Heart the Anvile, where my Thoughts doe beate, My Words the Hammers, fashioning my desire, My Brest the Forge, including all the heate, Love is the Fewell, which maintaines the fire; My Sighes the Bellowes, which the Flame encreaseth, Filling mine Eares with Noise, and Nightly groning, Toyling with Paine, my Labour never ceaseth, In grievous Passions, my Woes still bemoning: My Eyes with Teares against the fire striving, Whose scorching gleed, my heart to Cinders turneth; But with those Drops, the Flame againe reviving, Still more and more it to my torment burneth: With Sisiphus thus doe I role the stone, And turne the Wheele with damned Ixion. 41 [Why doe I speake of Joy, or write of Love] Why doe I speake of Joy, or write of Love, Loves Lunacie. When my Heart is the very Den of Horror, And in my Soule the paines of Hell I prove, With all his Torments and Infernall terror? What should I say? what yet remaines to doe? My Braine is drie with weeping all too long, My Sighes be spent in utt'ring of my Woe, And I want words, wherewith to tell my Wrong: But still distracted in Loves Lunacie, And Bedlam-like, thus raving in my Griefe, Now raile upon her Haire, then on her Eye; Now call her Goddesse, then I call her Thiefe; Now I deny Her, then I doe confesse Her, Now doe I curse Her, then againe I blesse Her. 42 [Some Men there be, which like my Method well] Some Men there be, which like my Method well, And much commend the strangenesse of my Vaine: Some say, I have a passing pleasing Straine, Some say, That in my Humor I excell; Some, who not kindly rellish my Conceit, They say (As Poets doe) I use to faine, And in bare words paint out my Passions paine; Thus sundry Men their sundry Minds repeat: I passe not, I, how Men affected bee, Nor who commends, or discommends my Verse; It pleaseth me, if I my Woes rehearse, And in my Lines, if she my love may see: Onely my comfort still consists in this, Writing her prayse, I cannot write amisse. 43 [Why should your faire Eyes with such sov'raigne grace] Why should your faire Eyes with such sov'raigne grace Disperse their Rayes on ev'ry vulgar Spirit, Whilst I in darkenesse, in the selfe-same place, Get not one glance, to recompence my Merit? So doth the Plow-man gaze the wand'ring Starre, And onely rest contented with the Light, That never learn'd what Constellations are, Beyond the bent of his unknowing Sight. O, why should Beautie (Custome to obey) To their grosse Sense apply her selfe so ill! Would God I were as ignorant as they, When I am made unhappy by my skill; Onely compell'd on this poore good to boast, Heav'ns are not kind to them, that know them most. 44 [Whilst thus my Pen strives to eternize thee] Whilst thus my Pen strives to eternize thee, Age rules my Lines with Wrinkles in my Face, Where, in the Map of all my Miserie, Is model'd out the World of my Disgrace; Whilst in despite of tyrannizing Times, Medea-like, I make thee young againe, Proudly thou scorn'st my World-out-wearing Rimes, And murther'st Vertue with thy coy disdaine: And though in youth, my Youth untimely perish, To keepe Thee from Oblivion and the Grave, Ensuing Ages yet my Rimes shall cherish, Where I intomb'd, my better part shall save; And though this Earthly Body fade and die, My Name shall mount upon Eternitie. 45 [Muses which sadly sit about my Chayre] Muses which sadly sit about my Chayre, Drown'd in the Teares, extorted by my Lines, With heavie Sighes whilst thus I breake the Ayre, Painting my Passions in these sad Designes; Since she disdaines to blesse my happie Verse, The strong-built Trophies to her living Fame, Ever henceforth my Bosome be your Hearse, Wherein the World shall now intombe her Name; Inclose my Musike, you poore senselesse Walls, Sith she is deafe, and will not heare my Mones, Soften your selves with ev'ry Teare that falls, Whilst I like Orpheus sing to Trees and Stones; Which with my plaint seeme yet with pittie moved, Kinder then she whom I so long have loved. 46 [Plaine-path'd Experience, th'unlearneds guide] Plaine-path'd Experience, th'unlearneds guide, Her simple Followers evidently shewes Sometimes what Schoole-men scarcely can decide, Nor yet wise Reason absolutely knowes: In making tryall of a Murther wrought, If the vile actors of the heynous deed Neere the dead Body happily be brought, Oft 't'ath been prov'd, the breathlesse Coarse will bleed. She comming neere, that my poore Heart hath slaine, Long since departed (to the World no more) Th'ancient Wounds no longer can containe, But fall to bleeding, as they did before: But what of this? Should she to death be led, It furthers Justice, but helpes not the dead. 47 [In pride of Wit, when high desire of Fame] In pride of Wit, when high desire of Fame Gave Life and Courage to my lab'ring Pen, And first the sound and vertue of my Name Wonne grace and credit in the Eares of Men; With those the thronged Theaters that presse, I in the Circuit for the Lawrell strove: Where, the full Prayse I freely must confesse, In heat of Bloud, a modest Mind might move. With Showts and Claps at ev'ry little pawse, When the proud Round on ev'ry side hath rung, Sadly I sit, unmov'd with the Applause, As though to me it nothing did belong: No publike Glorie vainely I pursue, All that I seeke, is to eternize you. 48 [Cupid, I hate thee, which I'de have thee know] Cupid, I hate thee, which I'de have thee know, A naked Starveling ever may'st thou be, Poore Rogue, goe pawne thy Fascia and thy Bow, For some few Ragges, wherewith to cover thee; Or if thou'lt not, thy Archerie forbeare, To some base Rustick doe thy selfe preferre, And when Corne's sowne, or growne into the Eare, Practise thy Quiver, and turne Crow-keeper; Or being Blind (as fittest for the Trade) Goe hyre thy selfe some bungling Harpers Boy; They that are blind, are Minstrels often made, So may'st thou live, to thy faire Mothers Joy: That whilst with Mars she holdeth her old Way, Thou, her blind Sonne, may'st sit by them, and play. 49 [Thou Leaden Braine, which censur'st what I write] Thou Leaden Braine, which censur'st what I write, And say'st, my Lines be dull, and doe not move; I marvell not, thou feel'st not my Delight, Which never felt'st my fierie touch of Love: But thou, whose Pen hath like a Packe-Horse serv'd, Whose Stomack unto Gall hath turn'd thy Food, Whose Senses, like poore Pris'ners, hunger-starv'd, Whose Griefe hath parch'd thy Body, dry'd thy Blood; Thou which hast scorned Life, and hated Death, And in a moment Mad, Sober, Glad, and Sorrie; Thou which hast bann'd thy Thoughts, and curst thy Birth, With thousand Plagues, more then in Purgatorie: Thou, thus whose Spirit Love in his fire refines, Come thou and reade, admire, applaud my Lines. 50 [As in some Countries, farre remote from hence] As in some Countries, farre remote from hence, The wretched Creature, destined to die, Having the Judgement due to his Offence, By Surgeons beg'd, their Art on him to trie, Which on the Living worke without remorse, First make incision on each mast'ring Veine, Then stanch the bleeding, then trans-pierce the Coarse, And with their Balmes recure the Wounds againe; Then Poyson, and with Physike him restore: Not that they feare the hope-lesse Man to kill, But their Experience to increase the more: Ev'n so my Mistres workes upon my Ill; By curing me, and killing me each How'r, Onely to shew her Beauties Sov'raigne Pow'r. 51 [Calling to minde since first my Love begun] Calling to minde since first my Love begun, Th'incertaine Times oft varying in their Course, How Things still unexpectedly have runne, As't please the Fates, by their resistlesse force: Lastly, mine Eyes amazedly have seene Essex great fall, Tyrone his Peace to gaine, The quiet end of that Long-living Queene, This Kings faire Entrance, and our Peace with Spaine, We and the Dutch at length our Selves to sever; Thus the World doth, and evermore shall Reele: Yet to my Goddesse am I constant ever; How e're blind Fortune turne her giddie Wheele: Though Heaven and Earth, prove both to me untrue, Yet am I still inviolate to You. 52 [What do'st thou meane to Cheate me of my Heart] What do'st thou meane to Cheate me of my Heart To take all Mine, and give me none againe? Or have thine Eyes such Magike, or that Art, That what They get, They ever doe retaine, Play not the Tyrant, but take some Remorse, Rebate thy Spleene, if but for Pitties sake; Or Cruell, if thou can'st not; let us scorse, And for one piece of Thine, my whole heart take. But what of Pitty doe I speake to Thee, Whose Brest is proofe against Complaint or Prayer? Or can I thinke what my Reward shall be From that proud Beauty, which was my betrayer? What talke I of a Heart, when thou hast none? Or if thou hast, it is a flinty one. 53 [Cleere Ankor, on whose Silver-sanded shore] Cleere Ankor, on whose Silver-sanded shore, Another to the River Ankor. My Soule-shrin'd Saint, my faire Idea lies, O blessed Brooke, whose milke-white Swans adore, Thy Cristall streame refined by her Eyes, Where sweet Myrrh-breathing Zephire in the Spring, Gently distills his Nectar-dropping showres, Where Nightingales in Arden sit and sing, Amongst the daintie Dew-impearled flowres; Say thus faire Brooke, when thou shalt see thy Queene, Loe, heere thy Shepheard spent his wandring yeeres; And in these Shades, deare Nymph, he oft hath beene, And heere to Thee he sacrific'd his Teares: Faire Arden, thou my Tempe art alone, And thou, sweet Ankor, art my Helicon. 54 [Yet reade at last the storie of my Woe] Yet reade at last the storie of my Woe, The drerie abstracts of my endlesse Cares, With my Life's Sorrow interlined so, Smoak'd with my Sighes, and blotted with my Teares; The sad Memorialls of my Miseries, Pen'd in the griefe of mine afflicted Ghost, My Lives complaint in dolefull Elegies, With so pure Love, as Time could never boast; Receive the Incense which I offer here, By my strong Faith ascending to thy Fame, My Zeale, my Hope, my Vowes, my Prayse, my Pray'r, My Soule's Oblations to thy sacred Name: Which Name my Muse to highest Heav'ns shall rayse, By chaste Desire, true Love, and vertuous Prayse. 55 [My faire, if thou wilt register my love] My faire, if thou wilt register my love, A World of Volumes shall thereof arise: Preserve my Teares, and thou thy Selfe shalt prove A second Floud, downe rayning from mine Eyes: Note but my Sighes, and thine Eyes shall behold The Sun-beames smothered with immortall Smoke, And if by Thee my Prayers may be enrol'd They Heaven and Earth to pitty shall provoke; Looke Thou into my brest, and Thou shalt see Chaste holy Vowes for my Soules sacrifice, That Soule (sweet Maid) which so hath honor'd Thee, Erecting Trophies to thy Sacred Eyes, Those Eyes to my Heart shining ever bright, When Darknesse hath obscur'd each other Light. 56 [When like an Eaglet I first found my Love] When like an Eaglet I first found my Love, An allusion to the Eaglets. For that the vertue I thereof would know, Upon the Nest I set it forth, to prove If it were of that Kingly kind, or no: But it no sooner saw my Sunne appeare, But on her Rayes with open Eyes it stood, To shew, that I had hatch'd it for the Ayre, And rightly came from that brave mounting Brood; And when the Plumes were summ'd with sweet desire, To prove the Pynions, it ascends the Skyes; Doe what I could, it needsly would aspire To my Soules Sunne, those two Celestiall Eyes: Thus from my Brest, where it was bred alone, It after thee, is like an Eaglet flowne. 57 [You best discern'd of my Minds inward Eyes] You best discern'd of my Minds inward Eyes, And yet your Graces outwardly Divine, Whose deare remembrance in my Bosome lyes, Too rich a Relique for so poore a Shrine: You, in whom Nature chose her selfe to view, When she her owne perfection would admire, Bestowing all her Excellence on you; At whose pure Eyes, Love lights his hallow'd Fire, Ev'n as a Man that in some Trance hath seene More then his wond'ring utt'rance can unfold, That rapt in Spirit, in better Worlds hath beene, So must your prayse distractedly be told; Most of all short, when I should shew you most, In your perfections so much am I lost. 58 [In former times, such as had store of Coyne] In former times, such as had store of Coyne, In Warres at home, or when for Conquests bound, For feare that some their Treasure should purloyne, Gave it to keepe to Spirits within the Ground; And to attend it, them as strongly ty'd, Till they return'd: Home when they never came, Such as by Art to get the same have try'd, From the strong Spirit by no meanes force the same; Neerer Men come, That further flyes away, Striving to hold it strongly in the Deepe: Ev'n as this Spirit, so you alone doe play With those rich Beauties Heav'n gives you to keepe: Pittie so left, to th'coldnesse of your Blood, Not to availe you, nor doe others good. 59 [As love and I, late harbour'd in one Inne] As love and I, late harbour'd in one Inne, To Proverbe. With Proverbs thus each other intertaine: In Love there is no lack, thus I begin, Faire words make Fooles, replyeth he againe; Who spares to speake, doth spare to speed (quoth I) As well (sayth he) too forward, as too slow; Fortune assists the boldest, I reply, A hastie Man (quoth he) ne'r wanted Woe; Labour is light, where Love (quoth I) doth pay, (Saith he) Light Burthen's heavy, if farre borne; (Quoth I) The Maine lost, cast the By away; You have spunne a faire Thred, he replyes in scorne. And having thus awhile each other thwarted, Fooles as we met, so Fooles againe we parted. 60 [Define my Weale, and tell the joyes of Heaven] Define my Weale, and tell the joyes of Heaven, Expresse my Woes, and shew the paines of Hell, Declare what Fate unlucky Starres have given, And aske a World upon my Life to dwell. Make knowne the Faith, that Fortune could not move, Compare my Worth with others base Desert, Let Vertue be the Touch-stone of my Love, So may the Heavens read wonders in my Heart; Behold the Clouds which have eclips'd my Sunne, And view the Crosses which my course doe let, Tell Me, if ever since the World begunne, So Faire a rising, had so Foule a set: And see if Time (if he would strive to prove) Can shew a Second to so pure a Love. 61 [Since ther's no helpe, Come let us kisse and part] Since ther's no helpe, Come let us kisse and part, Nay, I have done: You get no more of Me, And I am glad, yea glad withall my heart, That thus so cleanly, I my Selfe can free, Shake hands for ever, Cancell all our Vowes, And when We meet at any time againe, Be it not seene in either of our Browes, That We one jot of former Love reteyne; Now at the last gaspe, of Loves latest Breath, When his Pulse fayling, Passion speechlesse lies, When Faith is kneeling by his bed of Death, And Innocence is closing up his Eyes, Now if thou would'st, when all have given him over, From Death to Life, thou might'st him yet recover. 62 [When first I Ended, then I first Began] When first I Ended, then I first Began, Then more I Traveld, further from my Rest, Where most I Lost, there most of all I Wan, Pined with Hunger, rising from a Feast. Me thinkes I Flie, yet want I legges to Goe, Wise in Conceit, in Act a very sot, Ravish'd with Joy amid'st a hell of Woe, What most I Seeme, that surest am I Not. I build my Hopes a world above the Skie, Yet with the Mole I creepe into the Earth, In Plenty I am starv'd with Penurie, And yet I Surfet in the greatest Dearth: I have, I want, Despaire, and yet Desire, Burn'd in a Sea of yce, and drown'd amidst a fire. 63 [Truce, gentle Love, a Parly now I crave] Truce, gentle Love, a Parly now I crave, Me thinkes 'tis long since first these Warres begun, Nor thou, nor I, the better yet can have: Bad is the Match, where neither partie wonne. I offer free Conditions of faire Peace, My Heart for Hostage that it shall remaine, Discharge our Forces, here let Malice cease, So for my Pledge thou give me Pledge againe. Or if no thing but Death will serve thy turne, Still thirsting for subversion of my state; Doe what thou canst, raze, massacre, and burne; Let the World see the utmost of thy hate: I send defiance, since if overthrowne, Thou vanquishing, the Conquest is mine owne. FINIS. ODES. WITH OTHER LYRICK POESIES. BY Michael Drayton, ESQVIRE. TO THE WORTHY KNIGHT, AND MY NOBLE FRIEND, SIR HENRY GOODERE, a Gentleman of His Majesties Privie Chamber. These Lyrick Pieces, short, and few, Most worthy Sir, I send to you, To reade them, be not wearie: They may become John Hewes his Lyre, Which oft at Powlsworth by the fire Hath made us gravely merry. Beleeve it, he must have the Trick Of Ryming; with Invention quick, That should doe Lyricks well: But how I have done in this kind, Though in my selfe I cannot find, Your Judgement best can tell. Th'old British Bards, upon their Harpes, For falling Flatts, and rising Sharpes, That curiously were strung; To stirre their Youth to Warlike Rage, Or their wyld Furie to asswage, In these loose Numbers sung. No more I for Fooles Censures passe, Then for the braying of an Asse, Nor once mine Eare will lend them: If you but please to take in gree These Odes, sufficient 'tis to mee; Your liking can commend them. Yours, Mich. Drayton. TO HIMSELFE, AND THE HARPE. And why not I, as hee That's greatest, if as free, (In sundry strains that strive, Since there so many be) Th'old Lyrick kind revive? I will, yea, and I may; Who shall oppose my way? For what is he alone, That of himselfe can say, Hee's Heire of Helicon? Apollo, and the Nine, Forbid no Man their Shrine, That commeth with hands pure; Else they be so divine, They will him not indure. For they be such coy Things, That they care not for Kings, And dare let them know it; Nor may he touch their Springs, That is not borne a Poet. The Phocean it did prove, Pyreneus, King of Phocis, attempting to ravish the Muses. Whom when foule Lust did move, Those Mayds unchaste to make, Fell, as with them he strove, His Neck and justly brake. That instrument ne'r heard, Strooke by the skilfull Bard, It strongly to awake; But it th'infernalls skard, And made Olympus quake. Sam. lib. 1. cap. 16.As those Prophetike strings Whose sounds with fiery Wings, Drave Fiends from their abode, Touch'd by the best of Kings, That sang the holy Ode. Orpheus the Thracian Poet. Caput Hebre lyramque Exip. &amp;c. Ovid. lib. 11. Metam.So his, which Women slue, And it int' Hebrus threw, Such sounds yet forth it sent, The Bankes to weepe that drue, As downe the Streame it went. Mercury inventor of the Harpe, as Horace Ode 10. lib. 7. curvæque lyræ parentem.That by the Tortoyse shell, To Mayas Sonne it fell, The most thereof not doubt But sure some Power did dwell, In Him who found it out. The Wildest of the field, And Ayre, with Rivers t'yeeld, Thebes fayned to have beene raysed by Musicke.Which mov'd; that sturdy Glebes, And massie Oakes could weeld, To rayse the pyles of Thebes. And diversly though Strung, So anciently We sung To it, that Now scarce knowne, If first it did belong To Greece, or if our Owne. The Druydes imbrew'd, The ancient British Priests, so called of their abode in woods. Pindar Prince of the Greeke lyricks, of whom Horace: Pindarum quisquis studet, &amp;c. Ode 2. lib. 4.With Gore, on Altars rude With Sacrifices crown'd, In hollow Woods bedew'd, Ador'd the Trembling sound. Though wee be All to seeke, Of Pindar that Great Greeke, To Finger it aright, The Soule with power to strike, His hand retayn'd such Might. Or him that Rome did grace, Horace first of the Romans in that kind. Whose Ayres we all imbrace, That scarcely found his Peere, Nor giveth Phœbus place, For Strokes divinely cleere. The Irish I admire, And still cleave to that Lyre, The Irish Harpe. As our Musike's Mother, And thinke, till I expire, Apollo's such another. As Britons, that so long Have held this Antike Song, And let all our Carpers Forbeare their fame to wrong, Th'are right skilfull Harpers. Southerne, I long thee spare, Southerne, an English Lyrick. Yet wish thee well to fare, Who me pleased'st greatly, As first, therefore more rare, Handling thy Harpe neatly. To those that with despight Shall terme these Numbers slight, Tell them their Judgement's blind, Much erring from the right, It is a Noble kind. Nor is't the Verse doth make, That giveth, or doth take, 'Tis possible to clyme, To kindle, or to slake, Although in Skelton's Ryme. An old English Rymer. TO THE NEW YEERE. Rich Statue, double-faced, With Marble Temples graced, To rayse thy God-head hyer, In flames where Altars shining, Before thy Priests divining, Doe od'rous Fumes expire. Great Janus, I thy pleasure, With all the Thespian Treasure, Doe seriously pursue; To th'passed yeere returning, As though the old adjourning, Yet bringing in the new. Thy ancient Vigils yeerely, I have observed cleerely, Thy Feasts yet smoaking bee; Since all thy store abroad is, Give something to my Goddesse, As hath been us'd by thee. Give her th'Eoan brightnesse, Wing'd with that subtill lightnesse, That doth trans-pierce the Ayre; The Roses of the Morning The rising Heav'n adorning, To mesh with flames of Hayre. Those ceaselesse Sounds, above all, Made by those Orbes that move all, And ever swelling there, Wrap'd up in Numbers flowing, Them actually bestowing, For Jewels at her Eare. O Rapture great and holy, Doe thou transport me wholly, So well her forme to vary, That I aloft may beare her, Whereas I will insphere her In Regions high and starry. And in my choise Composures, The soft and easie Closures, So amorously shall meet; That ev'ry lively Ceasure Shall tread a perfect Measure, Set on so equall feet. That Spray to fame so fertle, The Lover-crowning Mirtle, In Wreaths of mixed Bowes, Within whose shades are dwelling Those Beauties most excelling, Inthron'd upon her Browes. Those Paralels so even, Drawne on the face of Heaven, That curious Art supposes, Direct those Gems, whose cleerenesse Farre off amaze by neerenesse, Each Globe such fire incloses. Her Bosome full of Blisses, By nature made for Kisses, So pure and wond'rous cleere, Whereas a thousand Graces Behold their lovely Faces, As they are bathing there. O, thou selfe-little blindnesse, The kindnesse of unkindnesse, Yet one of those divine; Thy Brands to me were lever, Thy Fascia, and thy Quiver, And thou this Quill of mine. This Heart so freshly bleeding, Upon it owne selfe feeding, Whose wounds still dropping be; O Love, thy selfe confounding, Her coldnesse so abounding, And yet such heat in me. Yet if I be inspired, Ile leave thee so admired, To all that shall succeed, That were they more then many, 'Mongst all, there is not any, That Time so oft shall reed. Nor Adamant ingraved, That hath been choisely'st saved, Idea's Name out-weares; So large a Dower as this is, The greatest often misses, The Diadem that beares. TO HIS VALENTINE. Muse, bid the Morne awake, Sad Winter now declines, Each Bird doth chuse a Make, This day's Saint Valentines; For that good Bishops sake Get up, and let us see, What Beautie it shall bee, That Fortune us assignes. But lo, in happy How'r, The place wherein she lyes, In yonder climbing Tow'r, Gilt by the glitt'ring Rise; O Jove! that in a Show'r, As once that Thund'rer did, When he in drops lay hid, That I could her surprize. Her Canopie Ile draw, With spangled Plumes bedight, No Mortall ever saw So ravishing a sight; That it the Gods might awe, And pow'rfully trans-pierce The Globie Universe, Out-shooting ev'ry Light. My Lips Ile softly lay Upon her heav'nly Cheeke, Dy'd like the dawning Day, As polish'd Ivorie sleeke: And in her Eare Ile say; O, thou bright Morning-Starre, 'Tis I that come so farre, My Valentine to seeke. Each little Bird, this Tyde, Doth chuse her loved Pheere, Which constantly abide In Wedlock all the yeere, As Nature is their Guide: So may we two be true, This yeere, nor change for new, As Turtles coupled were. The Sparrow, Swan, the Dove, Though Venus Birds they be, Yet are they not for Love So absolute as we: For Reason us doth move; They but by billing woo: Then try what we can doo, To whom each sense is free. Which we have more then they, By livelyer Organs sway'd, Our Appetite each way More by our Sense obay'd: Our Passions to display, This Season us doth fit; Then let us follow it, As Nature us doth lead. One Kisse in two let's breake, Confounded with the touch, But halfe words let us speake, Our Lip's imploy'd so much; Untill we both grow weake, With sweetnesse of thy breath; O smother me to death: Long let our Joyes be such. Let's laugh at them that chuse Their Valentines by lot, To weare their Names that use, Whom idly they have got: Such poore choise we refuse, Saint Valentine befriend; We thus this Morne may spend, Else Muse, awake her not. THE HEART. If THUS we needs must goe, What shall our one Heart doe, This One made of our Two? Madame, two Hearts we brake, And from them both did take The best, one Heart to make. Halfe this is of your Heart, Mine in the other part, Joyn'd by our equall Art. Were it cymented, or sowne, By Shreds or Pieces knowne, We each might find our owne. But 'tis dissolv'd, and fix'd, And with such cunning mix'd, No diff'rence that betwixt. But how shall we agree, By whom it kept shall be, Whether by you, or me? It cannot two Brests fill, One must be heartlesse still, Untill the other will. It came to me to day, When I will'd it to say, With whether it would stay? It told me, In your Brest, Where it might hope to rest: For if it were my Ghest, For certainety it knew, That I would still anew Be sending it to you. Never, I thinke, had two Such worke, so much to doo, A Unitie to woo. Yours was so cold and chaste, Whilst mine with zeale did waste, Like Fire with Water plac'd. How did my Heart intreat, How pant, how did it beat, Till it could give yours heat! Till to that temper brought, Through our perfection wrought, That blessing eythers Thought. In such a Height it lyes, From this base Worlds dull Eyes, That Heaven it not envyes. All that this Earth can show, Our Heart shall not once know, For it too vile and low. THE SACRIFICE TO APOLLO. Priests of Apollo, sacred be the Roome, For this learn'd Meeting: Let no barbarous Groome, How brave soe'r he bee, Attempt to enter; But of the Muses free, None here may venter; This for the Delphian Prophets is prepar'd: The prophane Vulgar are from hence debar'd. And since the Feast so happily begins, Call up those faire Nine, with their Violins; They are begot by Jove, Then let us place them, Where no Clowne in may shove, That may disgrace them: But let them neere to young Apollo sit; So shall his Foot-pace over-flow with Wit. Where be the Graces, where be those fayre Three? In any hand They may not absent bee: They to the Gods are deare, And they can humbly Teach us, our Selves to beare, And doe things comely: They, and the Muses, rise both from one Stem, They grace the Muses, and the Muses them. Bring forth your Flaggons (fill'd with sparkling Wine) Whereon swolne Bacchus, crowned with a Vine, Is graven; and fill out, It well bestowing, To ev'ry Man about, In Goblets flowing: Let not a Man drinke, but in Draughts profound; To our God Phœbus let the Health goe Round. Let your Jests flye at large; yet therewithall See they be Salt, but yet not mix'd with Gall: Not tending to disgrace, But fayrely given, Becomming well the place, Modest, and even; That they with tickling Pleasure may provoke Laughter in him, on whom the Jest is broke. Or if the deeds of Heroes ye rehearse, Let them be sung in so well-ord'red Verse, That each word have his weight, Yet runne with pleasure; Holding one stately height, In so brave measure, That they may make the stiffest Storme seeme weake, And dampe Joves Thunder, when it lowd'st doth speake. And if yee list to exercise your Vayne, Or in the Sock, or in the Buskin'd Strayne, Let Art and Nature goe One with the other; Yet so, that Art may show Nature her Mother; The thick-brayn'd Audience lively to awake, Till with shrill Claps the Theater doe shake. Sing Hymnes to Bacchus then, with hands uprear'd, Offer to Jove, who most is to be fear'd: From him the Muse we have, From him proceedeth More then we dare to crave; 'Tis he that feedeth Them, whom the World would starve; then let the Lyre Sound, whilst his Altars endlesse flames expire. TO CUPID. Maydens, why spare ye? Or whether not dare ye Correct the blind Shooter? Because wanton Venus, So oft that doth paine us, Is her Sonnes Tutor. Now in the Spring, He proveth his Wing, The Field is his Bower, And as the small Bee, About flyeth hee, From Flower to Flower. And wantonly roves, Abroad in the Groves, And in the Ayre hovers, Which when it him deweth, His Fethers he meweth, In sighes of true Lovers. And since doom'd by Fate, (That well knew his Hate) That Hee should be blinde; For very despite, Our Eyes be his White, So wayward his kinde. If his Shafts loosing, (Ill his Marke choosing) Or his Bow broken; The Moane Venus maketh, And care that she taketh, Cannot be spoken. To Vulcan commending Her love, and straight sending Her Doves and her Sparrowes, With Kisses unto him, And all but to woo him, To make her Sonne Arrowes. Telling what he hath done, (Sayth she, Right mine owne Sonne) In her Armes she him closes, Sweetes on him fans, Layd in Downe of her Swans, His Sheets, Leaves of Roses. And feeds him with Kisses; Which oft when he misses, He ever is froward: The Mothers o'r-joying, Makes by much coying The Child so untoward. Yet in a fine Net, That a Spider set, The Maydens had caught him; Had she not been neere him, And chanced to heare him, More good they had taught him. AN AMOURET ANACREONTICK. Most good, most faire. Or Thing as rare, To call you's lost; For all the cost Words can bestow, So poorely show Upon your prayse, That all the wayes Sense hath, come short: Whereby Report Falls them under; That when Wonder More hath seyzed, Yet not pleased, That it in kinde Nothing can finde, You to expresse: Neverthelesse, As by Globes small, This Mightie All Is shew'd, though farre From Life, each Starre A World being: So wee seeing You, like as that, Onely trust what Art doth us teach; And when I reach At Morall Things, And that my Strings Gravely should strike, Straight some mislike Blotteth mine Ode. As with the Loade, The Steele we touch, Forc'd ne'r so much, Yet still removes To that it loves, Till there it stayes; So to your prayse I turne ever, And though never From you moving, Happie so loving. LOVES CONQUEST. Wer't granted me to choose, How I would end my dayes; Since I this Life must loose, It should be in Your praise; For there is no Bayes Can be set above you. S'impossibly I love You And for You sit so hie, Whence none may remove You In my cleere Poesie, That I oft deny You so ample Merit. The freedome of my Spirit Maintayning (still) my Cause, Your Sex not to inherit, Urging the Salique Lawes; But your Vertue drawes From Me every due. Thus still You me pursue, That no where I can dwell, By Feare made just to You, Who Naturally rebell, Of You that excell That should I still Endyte, Yet will You want some Ryte. That lost in Your high praise I wander to and fro, As seeing sundry Waies: Yet which the right not know To get out of this Maze. TO THE VIRGINIAN VOYAGE. You brave Heroique Minds, Worthy your Countries Name, That Honour still pursue, Goe, and subdue, Whilst loyt'ring Hinds Lurke here at home, with shame. Britans, you stay too long, Quickly aboord bestow you, And with a merry Gale Swell your stretch'd Sayle, With Vowes as strong, As the Winds that blow you. Your Course securely steere, West and by South forth keepe, Rocks, Lee-shores, nor Sholes, When Eolus scowles, You need not feare, So absolute the Deepe. And cheerefully at Sea, Successe you still intice, To get the Pearle and Gold, And ours to hold, Virginia, Earth's onely Paradise. Where Nature hath in store Fowle, Venison, and Fish, And the fruitfull'st Soyle, Without your Toyle, Three Harvests more, All greater then your Wish. And the ambitious Vine Crownes with his purple Masse, The Cedar reaching hie To kisse the Sky, The Cypresse, Pine And use-full Sassafras. To whose, the golden Age Still Natures lawes doth give, No other Cares that tend, But Them to defend From Winters age, That long there doth not live. When as the Lushious smell Of that delicious Land, Above the Seas that flowes, The cleere Wind throwes, Your Hearts to swell Approching the deare Strand. In kenning of the Shore (Thanks to God first given,) O you the happy'st men, Be Frolike then, Let Cannons roare, Frighting the wide Heaven. And in Regions farre Such Heroes bring yee foorth, As those from whom We came, And plant Our name, Under that Starre Not knowne unto our North. And as there Plenty growes Of Lawrell every where, Apollo's Sacred tree, You it may see, A Poets Browes To crowne, that may sing there. Thy Voyages attend, Industrious Hackluit, Whose Reading shall inflame Men to seeke Fame, And much commend To after-Times thy Wit. AN ODE WRITTEN IN THE PEAKE. This while we are abroad, Shall we not touch our Lyre? Shall we not sing an Ode? Shall that holy Fire, In us that strongly glow'd, In this cold Ayre expire? Long since the Summer layd Her lustie Brav'rie downe, The Autumne halfe is way'd, And Boreas 'gins to frowne, Since now I did behold Great Brutes first builded Towne. Though in the utmost Peake, A while we doe remaine, Amongst the Mountaines bleake Expos'd to Sleet and Raine, No Sport our Houres shall breake, To exercise our Vaine. What though bright Phœbus Beames Refresh the Southerne Ground, And though the Princely Thames With beautious Nymphs abound, And by old Camber's Streames Be many Wonders found; Yet many Rivers cleare Here glide in Silver Swathes, And what of all most deare, Buckston's delicious Bathes, Strong Ale and Noble Cheare, T'asswage breeme Winters scathes. Those grim and horrid Caves, Whose Lookes affright the day, Wherein nice Nature saves, What she would not bewray, Our better leasure craves, And doth invite our Lay. In places farre or neere, Or famous, or obscure, Where wholesome is the Ayre, Or where the most impure, All times, and every-where, The Muse is still in ure. HIS DEFENCE AGAINST THE IDLE CRITICK. The Ryme nor marres, nor makes, Nor addeth it, nor takes, From that which we propose; Things imaginarie Doe so strangely varie, That quickly we them lose. And what's quickly begot, As soone againe is not, This doe I truely know: Yea, and what's borne with paine, That Sense doth long'st retaine, Gone with a greater Flow. Yet this Critick so sterne, But whom, none must discerne, Nor perfectly have seeing, Strangely layes about him, As nothing without him Were worthy of being. That I my selfe betray To that most publique way, Where the Worlds old Bawd, Custome, that doth humor, And by idle rumor, Her Dotages applaud. That whilst she still prefers Those that be wholly hers, Madnesse and Ignorance, I creepe behind the Time, From spertling with their Crime, And glad too with my Chance. O wretched World the while, When the evill most vile Beareth the fayrest face, And inconstant lightnesse, With a scornefull slightnesse, The best Things doth disgrace. Whilst this strange knowing Beast, Man, of himselfe the least, His Envie declaring, Makes Vertue to descend, Her Title to defend, Against him, much preparing. Yet these me not delude, Nor from my place extrude, By their resolved Hate; Their vilenesse that doe know, Which to my selfe I show, To keepe above my Fate. TO HIS RIVALL. Her lov'd I most, By thee that's lost, Though she were wonne with leasure; She was my gaine, But to my paine, Thou spoyl'st me of my Treasure. The Ship full fraught With Gold, farre sought, Though ne'r so wisely helmed, May suffer wracke In sayling backe, By Tempest over-whelmed. But shee, good Sir, Did not preferre You, for that I was ranging; But for that shee Found faith in mee, And she lov'd to be changing. Therefore boast not Your happy Lot, Be silent now you have her; The time I knew She slighted you, When I was in her favour. None stands so fast, But may be cast By Fortune, and disgraced: Once did I weare Her Garter there, Where you her Glove have placed. I had the Vow That thou hast now, And Glances to discover Her Love to mee, And she to thee Reades but old Lessons over. She hath no Smile That can beguile, But as my Thought I know it; Yea, to a Hayre, Both when and where, And how she will bestow it. What now is thine, Was onely mine, And first to me was given; Thou laugh'st at mee, I laugh at thee, And thus we two are even. But Ile not mourne, But stay my Turne, The Wind may come about, Sir, And once againe May bring me in, And helpe to beare you out, Sir. A SKELTONIAD. The Muse should be sprightly, Yet not handling lightly Things grave; as much loath, Things that be slight, to cloath Curiously: To retayne The Comelinesse in meane, Is true Knowledge and Wit. Nor me forc'd Rage doth fit, That I thereto should lacke Tabacco, or need Sacke, Which to the colder Braine Is the true Hyppocrene; Nor did I ever care For great Fooles, nor them spare. Vertue, though neglected. Is not so dejected, As vilely to descend To low Basenesse their end; Neyther each ryming Slave Deserves the Name to have Of Poet: so the Rabble Of Fooles, for the Table, That have their Jests by Heart, As an Actor his Part, Might assume them Chayres Amongst the Muses Heyres. Parnassus is not clome By every such Mome; Up whose steepe side who swerves, It behoves t'have strong Nerves: My Resolution such, How well, and not how much To write, thus doe I fare, Like some, few good that care (The evill sort among) How well to live, and not how long. THE CRYER. Good Folke, for Gold or Hyre, But helpe me to a Cryer; For my poore Heart is runne astray After two Eyes, that pass'd this way. O yes, O yes, O yes, If there be any Man, In Towne or Countrey, can Bring me my Heart againe, Ile please him for his paine; And by these Marks I will you show, That onely I this Heart doe owe. It is a wounded Heart, Wherein yet sticks the Dart, Ev'ry piece sore hurt throughout it, Faith, and Troth, writ round about it: It was a tame Heart, and a deare, And never us'd to roame; But having got this Haunt, I feare 'Twill hardly stay at home. For Gods sake, walking by the way, If you my Heart doe see, Either impound it for a Stray, Or send it backe to me. TO HIS COY LOVE, A Canzonet. I pray thee leave, love me no more, Call home the Heart you gave me, I but in vaine that Saint adore, That can, but will not save me: These poore halfe Kisses kill me quite; Was ever Man thus served? Amidst an Ocean of Delight, For Pleasure to be sterved. Shew me no more those Snowie Brests, With Azure Riverets branched, Where whilst mine Eye with Plentie feasts, Yet is my Thirst not stanched. O Tantalus, thy Paines ne'r tell, By me thou art prevented; 'Tis nothing to be plagu'd in Hell, But thus in Heaven tormented. Clip me no more in those deare Armes, Nor thy Life's Comfort call me; O, these are but too pow'rfull Charmes, And doe but more inthrall me. But see how patient I am growne, In all this coyle about thee; Come nice Thing, let thy Heart alone, I cannot live without thee. A HYMNE TO HIS LADIES BIRTH-PLACE. Coventry, that do'st adorne The Countrey wherein I was borne, Yet therein lyes not thy prayse, Why I should crowne thy Tow'rs with Bayes: 'Tis not thy Wall, me to thee weds, Coventry finely walled. The Shoulder-bone of a Bore of mighty bignesse. Thy Ports, nor thy proud Pyrameds, Nor thy Trophies of the Bore, But that Shee which I adore, Which scarce Goodnesse selfe can payre, First their breathing blest thy Ayre; Idea, in which Name I hide Her, in my heart Deifi'd, For what good, Man's mind can see, Onely Her Ideas be; She, in whom the Vertues came In Womans shape, and tooke her Name, She so farre past Imitation, As but Nature our Creation Could not alter, she had aymed, More then Woman to have framed: She, whose truely written Story, To thy poore Name shall adde more glory, Then if it should have beene thy Chance, T'have bred our Kings that Conquer'd France. Had She beene borne the former Age, That house had beene a Pilgrimage, And reputed more Divine, Two famous Pilgrimages, the one in Norfolk, the other in Kent. Godiva, Duke Leofricks wife, who obtained the Freedome of the City, of her husband, by riding thorow it naked. Then Walsingham or Beckets Shrine. That Princesse, to whom thou do'st owe Thy Freedome, whose Cleere blushing snow, The envious Sunne saw, when as she Naked rode to make Thee free, Was but her Type, as to foretell, Thou should'st bring forth one, should excell Her Bounty, by whom thou should'st have More Honour, then she Freedome gave; Queene Elizabeth.And that great Queene, which but of late Ru'ld this Land in Peace and State, Had not beene, but Heaven had sworne, A Maide should raigne, when she was borne. Of thy Streets, which thou hold'st best, A noted Streete in Coventry. His Mistresse birth-day.And most frequent of the rest, Happy Mich-Parke ev'ry yeere, On the fourth of August there, Let thy Maides from Flora's bowers, With their Choyce and daintiest flowers Decke Thee up, and from their store, With brave Garlands crowne that dore. The old Man passing by that way, To his Sonne in Time shall say, There was that Lady borne, which long To after-Ages shall be sung; Who unawares being passed by, Back to that House shall cast his Eye, Speaking my Verses as he goes, And with a Sigh shut ev'ry Close. Deare Citie, travelling by thee, When thy rising Spyres I see, Destined her place of Birth; Yet me thinkes the very Earth Hallowed is, so farre as I Can thee possibly descry: Then thou dwelling in this place, Hearing some rude Hinde disgrace Thy Citie with some scurvy thing, Which some Jester forth did bring, Speake these Lines where thou do'st come, And strike the Slave for ever dumbe. TO THE CAMBRO-BRITANS, and their Harpe, his Ballad of AGINCOURT. Faire stood the Wind for France, When we our Sayles advance, Nor now to prove our chance, Longer will tarry; But putting to the Mayne, At Kaux, the Mouth of Sene, With all his Martiall Trayne, Landed King Harry. And taking many a Fort, Furnish'd in Warlike sort, Marcheth tow'rds Agincourt, In happy howre; Skirmishing day by day, With those that stop'd his way, Where the French Gen'rall lay, With all his Power. Which in his Hight of Pride, King Henry to deride, His Ransome to provide To the King sending. Which he neglects the while, As from a Nation vile, Yet with an angry smile, Their fall portending. And turning to his Men, Quoth our brave Henry then, Though they to one be ten, Be not amazed. Yet have we well begunne, Battels so bravely wonne, Have ever to the Sonne, By Fame beene raysed. And for my Selfe (quoth he, This my full rest shall be, England ne'r mourne for Me, Nor more esteeme me. Victor I will remaine, Or on this Earth lie slaine, Never shall Shee sustaine, Losse to redeeme me. Poiters and Cressy tell, When most their Pride did swell, Under our Swords they fell, No lesse our skill is, Then when our Grandsire Great, Clayming the Regall Seate, By many a Warlike feate, Lop'd the French Lillies. The Duke of Yorke so dread, The eager Vaward led; With the maine, Henry sped, Among'st his Hench-men. Excester had the Rere, A Braver man not there, O Lord, how hot they were, On the false French-men! They now to fight are gone, Armour on Armour shone, Drumme now to Drumme did grone, To heare, was wonder; That with Cryes they make, The very Earth did shake, Trumpet to Trumpet spake, Thunder to Thunder. Well it thine Age became, O Noble Erpingham, Which didst the Signall ayme, To our hid Forces; When from a Medow by, Like a Storme suddenly, The English Archery Stuck the French Horses, With Spanish Ewgh so strong, Arrowes a Cloth-yard long, That like to Serpents stung, Piercing the Weather; None from his fellow starts, But playing Manly parts, And like true English hearts, Stuck close together. When downe their Bowes they threw, And forth their Bilbowes drew, And on the French they flew, Not one was tardie; Armes were from shoulders sent, Scalpes to the Teeth were rent, Downe the French Pesants went, Our Men were hardie. This while our Noble King, His broad Sword brandishing, Downe the French Hoast did ding, As to o'r-whelme it; And many a deepe Wound lent, His Armes with Bloud besprent, And many a cruell Dent Bruised his Helmet. Gloster, that Duke so good, Next of the Royall Blood, For famous England stood, With his brave Brother; Clarence, in Steele so bright, Though but a Maiden Knight, Yet in that furious Fight, Scarce such another. Warwick in Bloud did wade, Oxford the Foe invade, And cruell slaughter made, Still as they ran up; Suffolke his Axe did ply, Beaumont and Willoughby Bare them right doughtily, Ferrers and Fanhope. Upon Saint Crispin's day Fought was this Noble Fray, Which Fame did not delay, To England to carry; O, when shall English Men With such Acts fill a Pen, Or England breed againe, Such a King Harry? FINIS. THE LEGENDS OF Robert, Duke of Normandie. Matilda the Faire. Pierce Gaveston, Earle of Cornwall. Thomas Cromwell, Earle of Essex. BY Michael Drayton, ESQVIRE. TO THE HONOURABLE KNIGHT, SIR WALTER ASTON. I will not strive m'Invention to inforce, With needlesse words your eyes to intertaine, T'observe the formall ordinary course, That every one so vulgarly doth faine. Our interchanged and deliberate choice Is with more firme and true election sorted, Then stands in censure of the common voice, That with light humor fondly is transported. Nor take I patterne of anothers prayse, Then what my Pen may constantly avow, Nor walke more publike, nor obscurer wayes, Then Vertue bids, and Judgement will allow: So shall my love and best endevours serve you, And still shall study, still so to deserve you. M. Drayton. THE LEGEND OF ROBERT, DUKE OF NORMANDY. What time soft Night had silently begun To steale by Minutes on the long-liv'd Dayes, The furious Dog-starre following the bright Sunne, A Periphrasis of the height of Summer. With noysome Heat infests his chearefull Rayes, Filling the Earth with many a sad Disease; Which then inflam'd with their intemp'rate Fires, Her selfe in light Habilliments attyres. And the rathe Morning newly but awake, Was with fresh Beautie burnishing her Browes, Her selfe beholding in the Gen'rall Lake, To which she payes her never-ceasing Vowes, With the new Day me willingly to rowze; Downe to faire Thames I gently tooke my way, With whom the Winds continually doe play. Striving to Fancie his chaste Brest to move, A description of the delightfull course of the renowned Thames in two following Stanza's. Whereas all Pleasures plentifully flow, When him along, the wanton Tyde doth shove, And to keepe backe, they easily doe blow, Or else force forward, thinking him to slow; Who with his Waves would check the Winds imbrace, Whilst they fanne Ayre upon his crystall face. Still forward sallying from his bountious Sourse, Along the Shores lasciviously doth strayne, Making such strange Meanders in his Course, As to his Fountaine he would back agayne, Medway, a River of Kent, comming by Rochester, and falling into the Thames. Or turn'd about to looke upon his Trayne; Whose sundry Soyles with coy Regards he greets, Till with cleare Medway happily he meets. Steering my Compasse by this wand'ring Streame, Whose flight preach'd to me Times swift-posting How'rs, Delighted thus as with some prettie Dreame, Where Pleasure wholly had possess'd my Pow'rs, And looking back on Londons stately Tow'rs, So Troy, thought I, her stately Head did rere, Whose crazed Ribs the furrowing Plow doth eyre. Wearie, at length a Willow Tree I found, Which on the Banke of this brave River stood, Whose Root with rich Grasse greatly did abound, Forc'd by the fluxure of the swelling Flood; Ordayn'd (it seem'd) to sport his Nymphish Brood, Whose curled Top, envy'd the Heav'ns great Eye, Should view the Stock it was maintained by. The Larke, that holds observance to the Sunne, Quaver'd her cleare Notes in the quiet Ayre, And on the Rivers murmuring Base did runne, Whilst the pleas'd Heav'n her fayrest Liv'rie ware, The five Senses all at once pleased.The Place such Pleasure gently did prepare; The Flow'rs my Smell, the Floud my taste to steepe, And the much softnesse lulled me asleepe. When in a Vision as it seem'd to me, Triumphall Musike from the Floud arose, As when the Sov'raigne we embarged see, Simile.And by faire London for his pleasure rowes, Whose tender Welcome the glad Citie showes; The People swarming on the pest'red Shoares, And the curl'd Water over-spred with Oares. A Troupe of Nymphs came suddenly on Land, In the full end of this Triumphall Sound, And me incompass'd, taking hand in hand, Casting themselves about me in a Round, And so downe set them on the easie Ground, Bending their cleare Eyes with a modest Grace Upon my Swart and Melancholy Face. Next, 'twixt two Ladies came a goodly Knight, As newly brought from some distressefull place, To me who seemed some right worthy Wight, Though his Attyre were miserably base, And Time had worne deepe Furrowes in his Face; Yet, though cold Age had frosted his fayre Hayres, It rather seem'd with Sorrow then with Yeares. The one, a Lady of a Princely Port, Leading this sad Lord, scarcely that could stand; The other fleering in disdainefull sort, With scornefull Gestures drew him by the hand: Who lame and blind, yet bound with many a Band, When I perceived, neerer as they came, This Foole was Fortune, and the braver, Fame. Fame had the right Hand, in a Robe of Gold, A Description of Fame, and her Habit. (Whose Trayne old Time obsequiously did beare) Whereon, in rich Embrod'rie, was enrol'd The Names of all that Worthies ever were, Which all might reade, depainted lively there, Set downe in loftie well-composed Verse, Fit'st the great Deeds of Heroes to rehearse. On her faire Brest she two broad Tablets wore; Of Crystall one, the other Ebonie: On which, ingraven were all Names of yore, In the cleare Tombe of living Memorie, Or the blacke Booke of endlesse Obloquie; The first, with Poets and with Conqu'rors pyl'd, That with base Worldlings ev'ry where defil'd. And in her words appeared (as a Wonder) Her present Force, and after-during Might, Which softly spoke, farre off were heard to thunder, About the World that quickly tooke their flight, And brought the most obscurest Things to light; That still, the farther off, the greater still Did make our Good, or manifest our Ill. A Description of Fortune, and her Habit. Fortune, as blind as he whom she did lead, Changing her Feature, often in an howre Fantastically carrying her Head, Soone would she smile, and suddenly would lowre, And with one breath her words were sweet and sowre; Upon starke Fooles she amorously would glance, And upon Wise-men coyly looke ascance. About her neck, in maner of a Chaine, Torne Diadems and broken Scepter's hung, If any, on her stedfastly did leane, Them to the ground despightfully She flung, And in this Posture, as She past along, She bags of Gold out of her bosome drew, Which she to Sots and arrant Ideots threw. A duskie Vaile did hide her sightlesse eyes, Like Clouds that cover our uncertaine lives, Whereon were portray'd direfull Tragedies, Fooles wearing Crownes, and wisemen clog'd in Gyves, How all things she prepostrously contrives, Which as a Map, her Regency discovers In Campes, in Courts, and in the way of Lovers. An easie Banke neere to this place there was, A seat faire Flora us'd to sit upon, Curling her cleere locks in this liquid glasse, Putting her rich Gems, and attyrings on, Fitter then this about us there was none: Where they set downe that poore distressed man, When to the purpose Fortune thus began: Robert, surnam'd Curthoyse, or Short-hose.Behold this Duke of Normandy, quoth she, The heire of William Conqueror of this Ile, Appealing to be justifi'd by Thee, (Whose Tragedy, this Poet must compile,) He whom I ever have esteemed vile, Marking his birth with an unlucky brand; And yet for him thou com'st prepar'd to stand. What art thou, but a Tumor of the mind, Fortunes invective against Fame, in the 8. following Stanza's. A bubble, blowne up by deceitfull breath, Which never yet exactly wert defin'd, In whom no wise-man e'r reposed faith, Speaking of few well, untill after Death, That from loose Humor hast thy time-lesse birth, Unknowne to Heaven, nor much esteem'd on earth? First, by opinion had'st thou thy Creation, On whom thou still dost servilly attend, And like whom, long thou keep'st not any fashion, But with the world incertainely do'st wend, Which as a Poste thee up and downe doth send: Without prophane Tongues thou canst never rise, Nor be up-holden, be it not with lies: In ev'ry corner prying like a Theefe, And through each Cranny like the Wind do'st creepe, Apt to Report, as easie of Beleefe. What's he, whose Counsell thou didst ever keepe? Yet into Closets sawcily dar'st peepe, Telling for truth, what thou canst but suppose, Divulging that, which thou shouldst not disclose. With extreme Toyle and Labour thou art sought, Death is the way which leadeth to thy Cell, Onely with Bloud thy favour must be bought, And who will have thee, fetcheth thee from Hell, Where thou, impal'd with Fire and Sword, do'st dwell; And when thou art in all this Perill found, What art thou, onely but a Tinkling Sound? Such as the World doth hold to be but base, Of Humane Creatures, and the most doth scorne, That amongst Men sit in the servil'st place, These, for the most part, thou do'st most suborne, Those follow Fame, whose Weeds are neerely worne; Yet those poore Wretches cannot come to Thee, Unlesse prefer'd and dignify'd by Me. Thy Trumpet such supposed to advance, Is but, as those fantastically deeme, Whom Folly, Youth, or Frenzie doth intrance, Nor doth it sound, but onely so doth seeme, (Which the wise sort a Dotage but esteeme) Onely thereby the Humorous abusing, Fondly their Error, and thy Fault excusing. Except in Perill, thou do'st not appeare; Yet scarcely then, but with Intreats and Wooing, Flying farre off, when as thou should'st be neere, At hand diminish'd, and augmented going, Upon slight Toyes the greatest Cost bestowing, Oft promising, Mens Losses to repayre, Yet the performance, but a little Ayre. On balefull Herses (as the fittest Grounds) Written with Bloud, thy sad Memorials lye, Whose Letters are immedicable Wounds, Onely fit Objects for the weeping Eye; Thou from the Dust Mens Worths do'st onely try, And what before thou falsely didst deprave, Thou do'st acknowledge onely in the Grave. Fortune shewing her Power, and God-head, above Fame; in the six Stanza's following.The World it selfe is witnesse of my Pow'r, Ov'r whom I raigne with the eternall Fates, With whom I sit in Counsell ev'ry How'r, On th'alteration of all Times and States, Setting them downe their Changes, and their Dates, In fore-appointing ev'ry thing to come, Untill the great and universall Doome. The Starres to me an everlasting Booke, In that eternall Register, the Skie, Whose mightie Volumes I oft over-looke, Still turning ov'r the Leaves of Destinie, Which Man I too inviolate denie, And his frayle Will thereby I see control'd, By such strong Clauses as are there inrol'd. Predestination giving me a beeing, Whose depth Mans Wisdome never yet could sound, Into whose Secrets onely I have seeing, Wherein wise Reason doth her selfe confound, Searching where Doubts doe more thereby abound; For sacred Texts unlock the way to mee, To lighten those that will my Glory see. Those Names th'old Poets to their Gods did give, Were onely Figures to expresse my Might, To shew the Vertues that in Fortune live, And my much Power in this all-moving Wight, Who all their Altars to my God-head dight; Which Alterations upon Earth doe bring, And give them matter still whereon to sing. What though uncertaine, varying in my Course, I make my Changes ayme one certaine End, Crossing Mans Fore-cast, to make knowne my Force, Still Foe to none, to none a perfect Friend, To him least hoping, soonest I doe send, That all should find, I worthily bestow, And 'tis a Reason, that I thinke it so. Forth of my Lap I powre abundant Blisse, All Good proceeds from my all-giving Hand, By me, Man happy, or unhappy is, For whom I sticke, or whom I doe withstand, And it is I am Friendships onely Band; And upon Me, all greedily take hold, Which being broke, all Worldly Love growes cold. Pawsing, she frown'd, when suddenly withall A fearefull noyse ariseth from the Flood, As when a Tempest furiously doth fall Within the thick Waste of some ancient Wood; That in amazement ev'ry Mortall stood, As though her words such pow'rfulnesse did beare, That each thing seem'd her Menaces to feare. When Fame yet smyling, mildly thus replyes; Alas (quoth she) what labour thou hast lost? What wond'rous Mysts thou cast'st before our Eyes? Yet will the Gayne not counter-vaile the Cost. What would'st thou say, if thou hadst cause to boast? Which set'st thy state out in such wond'rous sort, Which, but thy selfe, none ever could report. The Invective of Fame against Fortune, in 7. following Stanza's.For what is Fortune onely, but Event, Breeding in some a transitorie Terror? A what Men will, that falls by Accident, And onely named to excuse their Error? What else is Fortune, or who doth preferre her? Or who to her so foolish is to leane, Which weake Tradition onely doth maintaine? A Toy, whereon the doting World doth dreame, First soothed by uncertaine Observation, Of Mens Attempts that being the extreame, Fast'neth thereby on weake Imagination; Yet notwithstanding all this Usurpation, Must to thy selfe be incidently loathing, Most when thou would'st be, that art rightly nothing. And with the World insinuating thus, And under so allowable Pretence, Closely incrochest on Mans Genius, In good and evill taking Residence; And having got this small Preeminence, When to thy selfe a Being thou would'st frame, Art in conclusion onely but a Name. Those Ignorant, which made a God of Nature, And Natures God divinely never knew, Were those, to Fortune that first built a Stature, From whom thy Worship ignorantly grew; Which being adored foolishly by few, Grounded thy looser and uncertaine Lawes Upon so weake and indigent a Cause. First Sloth did hatch thee in her sleepy Cell, And Thee with ease dishonorably fed, Delivering thee with Cowardice to dwell, Which with base Thoughts, continually thee bred, By Superstition id'ly being led, It an Imposture after did thee make, Whom for a goddesse Fooles doe onely take. Nor never do'st Thou any thing forecast, But as thou art Improvident, so light, And this most wicked property Thou hast, That against Vertue thou bend'st all thy Might, With whom Thou wagest, a continuall fight; The yeelding Spirit, in Fetters thou do'st bind But art a meere slave to the Constant mind. Such is thy Froward and Malignant kind, That what thou do'st, Thou still do'st in despight, And art inamor'd of the Barbarous Hind: Whom thou do'st make thy onely Favorite: “None but the Base, in basenesse doe delight: For wer't thou Heavenly, thou in Love would'st bee, With that which neerest doth resemble thee. But I alone the Herald am of Heaven, Fame expressing her preeminence in Divinity above Fortune, in eight Stanza's. Whose spacious Kingdome stretcheth farre and wide, Through ev'ry Coast upon the light'ning driven, As on the Sunne-beames, gloriously I ride, By them I mount, and downe by them I slide, I register the Worlds long-during houres, And know the hie Will of th'immortall powers. Men to the Starres me guiding them doe clime, That all Demensions perfectly expresse, I am alone the vanquisher of Time: Bearing those Sweets, which cure death's bitternesse: I all good Labours plentifully blesse, Yea, all abstruse profoundities impart, Leading men through the Tedious wayes of Art. A discription of the Palace of Fame, in the 4. following Stanza's.My Palace placed, betwixt Earth and Skies, Which many a Tower, ambitiously up beares, Whereof the Windowes are glaz'd all with Eyes, The Wall's as neatly builded are of Eares, Where ev'ry thing in Heaven and Earth appeares, Nothing so softly whisper'd in the Round, But through my Palace presently doth sound. And under foot floor'd all about with Drummes, The Rafters, Trumpets, admirably cleare, Sounding alowd each Name that thither comes, The Crannies, Tongues, and Talking ev'ry where, And all Things past, in Memorie doe beare, The Doores unlocke with ev'ry little breath, Nay, open wide with each word which Man sayth. And hung about with Armes and conqu'red Spoyles; The Posts whereon the goodly Roofe doth stand, Are Pillars graven with Herculian Toyles; Th'Atchievements great, of many a Warlike Hand, As well in Christned, as in Heathen Land, Done by those Nobles that are most renown'd, That there by me immortally are crown'd. Here, in the Bodies likenesse whilst it lives, Appeare the Thoughts, proceeding from the Mind, To which the place a glorious Habit gives, When once to me they freely are resign'd, To be preserv'd here: and are so refin'd, That when the Corps by death doth lastly perish, Then doth this Place the Minds true Image cherish. My Beautie never fades, but still new-borne, As Yeeres increase, so ever waxing young, My Strength is not diminished, nor worne, Time weak'ning all Things, onely makes me strong, Nor am I subject to base Worldly Wrong; The Power of Kings I utterly defie, Nor am I aw'd by all their Tyrannie. The Brow of Heav'n my Monuments containe, (And is the mightie Register of Fame) Which there in fierie Characters remaine, The gorgeous Seeling of th'immortall Frame, The Constellations publishing my Name, Where my Memorials evermore abide, So by th'old Poets was I glorify'd. Fame having ended, Fortune soone began, Further to urge what she before had said; When lo (quoth she) Duke Robert is the Man, Which as my Prisoner, I in Bonds doe lead, For whom thou com'st against me here to plead, Whom I alone deprived of his Crowne. “Who can rayse him, that Fortune will have downe? A fitter instance, Fame replying, none, Then is Duke Robert, Fortune doe thy worst, Greater on Man thy Might was never showne, Doing to him all that thou could'st, or durst: And since thy Turne allotted is the first, Proceed; see which, the Norman Duke shall have, After so long being layd up in his Grave. Quoth Fortune, Then I found th'unstedfast Starre, Fortunes Relation of her power in the Life of Duke Robert. Whose lucklesse working limited his Fate, That mark'd his sad Nativitie with Warre, And Brothers most unnaturall Debate, As to be punish'd by his Parents Hate; For that the Kingdome which the Conqu'ror wonne, Should be the wracke of him, his first-borne Sonne. By that which Nature did on him bestow, In him her best, that strayned her to try, Thereby, himselfe I made him overthrow, In humane Birth so powerfull am I, Marking his Brest too openly to lye, From both his Brothers different too farre, Too mild for Peace, too mercifull for Warre. Duke Robert of high Courage, yet of a flexible nature.And yet the Courage that he did inherite, And from the Greatnesse of his Bloud did take, Though shrowded in so peaceable a Spirit, When once his Wrongs came roughly to awake, Forth, with so strange and violent Furie brake, As made the World apparantly to see All humane Actions managed by mee. Robert, in his most hopefull Attempts, most unfortunate.That till Revenge was wholly him bereft, (In ev'ry Thing opposed by my Pow'r) For him to leane to, nothing being left, And Danger him most threat'ned to devoure, To the last Period of the utmost Houre, Oft by vaine Hopes, that he might get my love, There was no Perill, but I made him prove. Duke Robert claymed Normandie, by his Fathers promise, to be delivered him, so soone as his said Father had conquered England: under which colour he invaded it, and got the better of his Father, at the Battell of Archenbray.For whilst his Father, with the Norman Sword, His prosp'rous entrance upon England made, I layd the Project, that this youthfull Lord In the meane time did Normandie invade, Upon his Syre, and made him draw his Blade; The meane whereby he thought he could not misse That which he else might fayle of, to make his. That Robert dayly in disgrace might runne, With the Great Conqu'ror, as he still did grow Neerer his Death; who vexed by his Sonne, The Conqueror ever laboured to settle the Kingdome of England upon his second sonne William.(His Pride which but too openly did show) His State devised wisely to bestow Upon his Second, that his Dayes to close, Himselfe he might more quietly repose. And then, lest Time might chance to coole his Blood, That lucklesse Warre by ling'ring I supply'd, That whilst Duke Robert justly censured stood, For Disobedience and unnaturall Pride, In heat of this, the Conqu'ror William dy'd, Setting young Rufus upon Englands Throne, Leaving his Eldest struggling for his Owne. Which in short time so many Mischiefes bred, (As sundry Plagues on William's Off-spring sent) Which soone rose to so violent a Head, That Policie them no way could prevent, When to destruction all things headlong went; And in the end, as consummating all, Duke Robert's irrecoverable Fall. Whom then I did auspiciously perswade, Once more with Warre to fright the English Fields, His Brother (then King William) to invade, Duke Robert prepareth an Armie to invade England. To make him know the diff'rence of their Shields; Where though his Armes he ne'r so wisely wields, And though by him the Kingdome were not taken, His Scepter should be violently shaken. These sundry Soyles, in both of which was sowne (By so approv'd and Fortunate a Hand) Seed, which to both might prosp'rously have growne, Had they remain'd in Friend-ships sacred Band, In opposition when they came to stand: Farre wyder wounds to either of them lent, Then all the power that Europe could have sent. Thus did I winne King William in his life, Normandy left to Robert, and England to William. His Conquer'd Realme on Rufus to bestowe, What he had got by strength, to leave in strife, Those to molest that from his Stock should growe; Odo, Bishop of Bayeux, Brother to the Conqueror, though he loved King William Rufus, yet for the hate he bare to Lanfranke, Bishop of Canterbury, whom William much affected, forsooke him, and tooke part with Duke Robert, drawing many of the Nobilitie to his side. Which by my Cunning I contrived so, To plague his Issue with a generall ill, Yet the extreme to fall on Robert still. That Prelate Odo (that with William held) To Bishop Lanfrank for his deadly Spight, That William lov'd, against the King rebel'd, With all his Power abetting Roberts Right, Ayded by Mortayn's and Montgomerie's Might, Upon this Land to bring a second Warre, Of her late Conquest, whilst she bare the Skarre. When Duke Robert had landed at Southampton for invasion, Rufus, by his faire promises, of Homage &amp; Tribute, wonne him to dismisse his Army, and to returne into Normandy.And when he was in so direct a way, Great Friends at hand his Enterprize to back, Ready before him, when his Entrance lay; Nor could he thinke of ought that he did lack, Yet wonne I him his Enterprize to slack, Stopping the Course which rightly he had runne, All to undoe that he before had done. Thus did I first provoke him to that Rage, Which had so farre prevayl'd upon his Blood, And at my pleasure did the same asswage, When this brave Heat in stead might him have stood, So to my Humor alt'red I his Mood, By taking Armes, his Cost and Coyne to lose, And leaving them, to animate his Foes. That by concluding this untimely Peace, I might thereby a ling'ring Warre begin, That whilst these Tumults for a while did cease, William on Robert might advantage winne; Thus let I Treason secretly in, Giving deceitfull Policie the Kay, Into the Closet where his Counsels lay. Thus, in the habit of a faithfull Friend, I drew into him a most dang'rous Foe, His Wit, that used to no other end, But to cloath Treason in a vertuous show, Which he for currant so contriv'd to goe, As he in secret hurt Duke Robert more By this soft Peace, then in the Warre before. And to thee, Fame, I then my Pow'r addrest, Nay, Thee mine onely Instrument I made, That whilst these Brothers at this point did rest, Robert to Warre, I wonne thee to perswade, Godfrey, Duke of Bulloyne, Generall of the Christian Army.With those that went the Soldan to invade, With great Duke Godfrey pressing forth his Bands, From his proud Pow'r to free the Holy Lands. Thus, by thee, Fame, did I his Humor feed, The only way to draw this Duke abroad, That whilst at home his presence most should need, In forraine Parts to fasten his aboad: Him in this manner wisely I bestow'd, That William dying, Robert being gone, Henry might seat him on the English Throne. His Eare so seas'ning with the sound of Armes, As in ought else no Musike it could find, Neither had any feeling of his Harmes: On Palestine so placed he his Mind, (Clearely that shew'd the Greatnesse of his Kind) And him so high and with such force did beare, As when he had most cause, he least did feare. Thus was he throwne into his endlesse Thrall; Which though the meane devised was by Me, And ev'ry thing was fitted to his Fall, Which none could hinder, though the most fore-see, Yet here I made an Instrument of Thee; “For where Destruction I doe once pretend, “All that Man doth, still sorteth to that end. He gone, and Rufus being rob'd of Breath, Suffring an untimely death, being slaine with an Arrow, in Hunting. Henry, called Beaucleark, for his great Learning. He gayned the goodwill of the Laitie, by perswading them, that his Brother was to be elected King of Jerusalem; and of the Clergy, by his promises, to restore the Church Livings which his Father and Brother had taken from them. And Henry Beaucleark coveting to raigne, Offred so fairely by King Williams Death, Whilst Robert doth in Palestine remaine, Whereby a Kingdome he might eas'ly gaine; What by his Pow'r, and Science to perswade, Himselfe a Monarch absolutely made. Whilst this great Duke imbraced was by Thee, Which Thou as Thine do'st absolutely clayme, But finds meere Shadowes, only missing Me, And idle Castles in the Ayre doth frame; Lo, such a mightie Monarchesse is Fame, That what she gives, so easie is to beare, As none therefore needs Violence to feare. Till Robert safely from the Holy Warres Returning, honour'd by the Pagans flight, From forraine Battels, into civill Jarres, From getting others, for his owne to fight, Inforc'd to use the utmost of his Might, With that brave Sword, in Pagan Bloud imbru'd, To save himselfe, by his owne Friends pursu'd. When wanting Summes, the Sinewes of a Force, (Which his high Spirit too quickly came to find, Ere he could put himselfe into his Course) Most strangely seem'd to mollifie his Mind; Thus had his Brother William Rufus overwrought him once before.And on the sudden Henry seeming kind, Offred, his love at any rate to buy, So that fast to him, he the Duke might tye. Henry too politike or plaine-dealing Robert.Thus, of Duke Robert wisely did he winne, Not then so well establish'd as he would, Till he by Craft had closely cropen in, Setting himselfe substantially to hold, Offring him great Summes of bewitching Gold, As yeerely Tribute from this Realme to rise, Quite to blot out all former Injuries. Which to the poore Duke yeelding much Reliefe, Henry to passe his Purposes so brought, Whilst Robert yet suspected not that Theefe, Which under-hand so cunningly him caught; Of whom, the least when Princely Robert thought, Ev'n in a Moment did annoy him more, Then all those Ills, that hap'd to him before. Which to this Lord (beleeving well) unknowne, And he not finding, eas'ly could not flie, For it, a Bait into his way was throwne, Which to avoid, Duke Robert look'd too hie: “Into good Minds, Craft can the eas'lyest prie; For in his plyant Nature, as a Mould, Well could I cast what forme soe'r I would. For by this Three thousand Markes by the yeere, and the Survivor to be Heire to the other: Which Henry, after he had seated himselfe strongly in the Kingdome, neglected to pay, making a scorne of his Brother. Tribute cutting off the Clayme, Which he, the Elder, to his England made, His former Hopes he forcibly did mayme, Which for a while by Henry being pay'd, But after by him fraudulently stay'd, As from a Fountaine, plentiously did spring Th'efficient Cause of Robert's ruining. When as his Friends, so well to him that meant, Many that prepared to ayde Duke Robert, who intended to have landed at Portsmouth, with an Army out of Normandy; when they found Roberts flexabilitie, and upon a Proclamation of their Pardon by King Henry, gave him all their Power. To take his part and did their Force prepare, Finding him thus their Purpose to prevent, And how thereby 'twas like with him to fare; Upon King Henry planted all their care, Giving their Pow'rs, their Peace with him to make, Gath'red at first the Norman part to take. And I that friendly evermore had beene To the stout Normans, which by me had wonne, To prove my selfe the Earth's Imperious Queene, And shew the World, by me what can be done, To spight this Robert, William Conquerors Sonne, With England against Normandie doe stand, Fortune variable in the state of Kingdomes. Conqu'red but lately by the Norman Hand. Their Issue, which were Conqu'rors of this Ile, That part of France, now called Normandy, was anciently called Nuestria; but of a people comming thither, out of the North-part of Germany, it became so called, as Northmandy, or Normandy, that is, the Country of the men of the North, in their Language. At Hastings which the English men did tame, Here Natives, graced with the English Stile, To their first Countrey carry back their Clayme, Conquest returning, whence it lately came; That once as England felt Nuestria's Stroke, To make Nuestria, to beare Englands Yoke. Those angry Brothers in the field in Armes, Then whom there were not two more deadly Foes, Ech seeking other in the hot'st Alarmes, And at their meeting, changing deadly Blowes, Quickly that meant to winne, or soone to lose, Robert would faine release himselfe of thrall, Henry againe doth hotly put for all. This Battell, in which Robert was overcome by his yonger brother Henry, was at a place called Tenacbray, in Normandy.On him, which late in Palestine I smil'd, Return'd, at fatall Tenacbray I frowne, And from his Dukedome him that day exil'd, Which had he wonne it, might have worne a Crowne: And to be sure him in mis-hap to drowne, Lastly himselfe, he in the fight did lose, Taken a Prisoner, by his Trayt'rous foes. Which bound to England basely did him bring, Baselyer abus'd and mock't at of his owne, A Captive where he should have beene a King; Such was the lot by Me upon him throwne: There, to lament his misery alone, Prescrib'd to one poore solitary place, Who should have progres'd all a Kingdomes space. Could humane knowledge comprehend my hate, Or Reason sound the depth of things Divine, The World amazed at Duke Roberts State, Might thinke no power, to be compar'd to mine; And wish the Gods would all to me resigne: In this man's fall apparently to see, Above the Star's, what might there rests in me. That Blade, on him, in Battell which had power, Was too much blunted, to abridge his Dayes, Time, that so fast from all away doth scowre, Deferres his End with Dilatorie stayes, Whilst he his Brothers Tyrannie obayes, That He in Life a thousand Deaths might dye; Duke Robert, taken in Battell, was by Henry committed to the Castle of Cardiffe, in South-Wales: From whence attempting to make escape, his Brother caused his Eyes to be put out, as some have written, with a Burning Glasse.Where I will plague, so tyrannous am I. The while in Cardiffe he a Captive lyes, Whose Windowes were but Niggards of their Light; I wrought, this Henrie's Rage not to suffice, But that he rob'd Duke Robert of his Sight, To turne this little piece of Day to Night, As though that Sense, whose want should be the last To all Things living, he the first should taste. That Robert so unfortunately blinde, No outward Object might disperse his Care, The better to illuminate his Mind, To see his Sorrowes throughly what they were, To doe so much to this great Prince, I dare, By taking from him, that which serv'd him best, To his Affliction to turne all the rest. And when he was bereaved of his Ease, With the remembrance of so haynous Wrong, Upon his Brest so strongly that did seize, And his sad Heart so violently stung, Yet made I Nature in that Prince so strong, That Griefe, which many doth of Life deprive, Seem'd to preserve and keepe him still alive. Him I forbad, that any Foe should kill, Nor by his owne Hand suffred him to die, That Life to Robert should be lothsome still, And that Death from him evermore should flie, Making them both to him an Enemie, Willing to die, by Life him double killing, Urged to live, twice dying, he unwilling. So many yeeres as he had worne a Crowne, So many yeeres as he had hop'd to rise, So many yeeres upon him did I frowne, So many yeeres he liv'd without his Eyes, So many yeeres in dying, ere he dyes, So many yeeres shut up in Prison strong; “Though Sorrow make the shortest time seeme long. Thus sway I in the course of Earthly things, To make Time worke him everlasting spight, To shew how I can tyrannize on Kings, And in the fall of Great ones doe delight, In fyned Things my working infinite: All Worldly changes, at my will disposed, For that in me all Wonder is inclosed. At Fortunes speech amazed whilst they stand, And Fame her selfe much wondred at his woe, When from Duke Robert Fortune tooke her Hand, Whose Miserie shee thus had let them know: When now to answere her despightfull Foe, Fame from deepe silence seeming to awake, For her deare Clyent, modestly thus spake: Pope Urban, a great moover to this Warre.What time I held my Residence in Rome, Striving my selfe o'r Europe to advance, To winne her Princes, to regayne the Tombe, Which had beene lost by their misgovernance, Awaking England, Germanie, and France, All which were woo'd, and bravely wonne by Mee, From the proud Pagans, Palestine to free. Peter, a poore old Hermit, returning from Jerusalem, certified the Christian Princes, in what miserie the Christians lived there under the Pagans. Godfrey of Bulloyne, Generall of the Armie. Peter, that Holy Hermit putting on, T'all Christian Princes to preach out the losse, And stirring brave Duke Godfrey to be gone, Under the Banner of the Bloudy Crosse, And whilst in so faire forwardnesse it was, And every Eare attentive seem'd to stand, To heare what Power brave Bulloyne should comand. Thither did I all happy Spirits exhort, As to that bus'nesse luckily to bring, Allured by the confident Report, That from so great an Enterprize did spring, T'adventure in so Popular a Thing, And deemed no Man worthy to be mine, That was found backward in this great Designe. What time this Duke, great William Conquerors Sonne, That in his native Normandy did rest: For of what else, his valiant Father wonne, His Brother William Rufus was possest, Which, whilst he striveth from his Hands to wrest, This brave Attempt, brake like a Deluge forth, By my shrill Trumpet sounded through the North. Which having got free entrance to his Eare, Such entertaynment hapned there to find, As suffered no perswasion to be there, From that high Purpose to divert his Mind, For being most Religiously inclind; Woo'd with this offer; wisely did prepare, Himselfe to furnish for this great Affaire. That Kingdome he doth carelesly neglect, Which William Rufus wrongfully did keepe, And only that doth constantly respect, Where he once in his Sepulcher did sleepe, At whose deare Death the very Rocks did weepe, His Crowne of Gold this Christian Prince doth scorne, So much he lov'd Him, that was crown'd with Thorne. And though his wants him grievously oppres'd, Duke Robert morgaged the County of Constantine in the Duchy of Normandie, to Henrie his yongest Brother, for mony to levy an Armie against William, who had gotten the Realme of England. Of those great Summes which lately he had spent, In levying Power, which him should have posses'd Of England, and much hindred his intent, Yet his brave purpose it could not prevent; Although awhile it seem'd delay to make Of that, which he resolv'd to undertake. Wherefore this Noble, and cleere-spirited Lord, Whilst the great bus'nesse standeth at this stay, And since his State no better could afford, In gage to William, Normandy doth lay, Robert, to furnish his journey to the Holy Land, pawnd Normandie to his Brother Rufus. Providing first his Souldiers how to pay, And of the two yet rather chose to leave His Crowne, then he that Army would deceive. To his victorious Ensigne came from farre, Th'in Iled Redshanks, toucht with no remorse, The Scottish-Irish. The nimble Irish, that with Darts doe warre, The Scot, that is so cunning on his Horse, Of what people Roberts power most consisted. The English Archer of a Lyons force, The valiant Norman, not the least among The Camber-Britan, hardy, big, and strong, The Welsh. No Prince before ever led the English on so brave a service.Which long inclos'd within these colder Climes, He to the blessed Sepulcher did bring, And taught them how they should redeeme the Times Whence their Eternall memorie might spring, To see the Place whereas their Heavenly King, Their deare Redemption happily began: Living on Earth, that was both God and Man. Yee Ilanders, bound in the Oceans Chayne, Lock'd up like Pris'ners, from the cheerefull Day, Your brave Commander brought yee to the Mayne, Which to my Court shew'd yee the open Way, And his victorious Hand became the Kay, To let yee in, to my rich Treasure, where None ever come, but those that I hold deare: And did thereto so zealously proceed, That those faire Locks, whose Curles did him adorne, Till he had seene the Holy Citie freed: A Vow made by Duke Robert.He deepely vow'd, he never would have shorne, Which, for they so religiously were worne, In every Eye did beautifie him more, Then did the Crowne of Normandie before. The Character of an excellent Captayne, continued, welneere thorow all this speech of Fame.No Threats, his Hand could cause him to with-hold, As I the sequell briefly shall relate, Yet bare himselfe right wisely as he could, And best became his Dignitie and State; Teaching how his, themselves should moderate, Not following life, so with his chance content, Nor flying Death, so truely Valient. So did he all his Faculties bestow, That every thing exactly might be done, That true foresight, before the Act might goe, Others grosse Errours happily to shunne, Wisely to finish well what was begunne, Justly directed in the course of things, By the straight Rule which sound Experience brings. Idle Regards of Greatnesse he did scorne, Carelesse of Pompe, Magnificent to bee, That Man reputing to be Noblest borne, Where was the most magnanimous, and free, In Honour so impartiall was hee, Esteeming Titles meritlesse and nought, Unlesse with danger absolutely bought: Giving the Souldier comfortable words, And oft Imbalm'd his well-received Wound, And in his need him maintenance affords, To brave Attempts incouraging the sound, Never dismaid in any danger found: His Tent a seate of Justice to the griev'd; And 'twas a Court when Want should be reliev'd. So perfectly Celestiall was that fire, Bestow'd in the composure of his mind, To that High pitch as raysed his desire; Above the usuall compasse of his kinde, And from all Drosse so cleerely him refin'd, As did him wholly consecrate to glory, And made him a fit subject for a Story. Who on Ambassage to the Emperor sent, Passing along through Macedon and Thrace, Ne'r came in Bed, nor slept out of his Tent, Till he review'd Duke Godfrey's Reverent face; Nor till he came into that hallowed place, Above three houres, by night he never slept: Such were the Cares his troubled braine that kept. O wherefore thou Great Singer of thy dayes, That famous Italian Poet Torquato Tasso, in his Poem of those Holy warres. Renowned Tasso in thy Noble Story, Wert thou so slacke in this Great Worthy's prayse, And yet so much should'st set forth others glory? Me thinks for this, thou canst not but be sorry, That thou should'st leave another to recite That, which so much Thou did'st neglect to write. No one Prince in the whole Army, did so many brave Acts in his owne Person, as Duke Robert. There was not found in all the Christian Host, Any, then He, more forward to the field, Nor could the Army, of another boast, To beare himselfe more bravely with his Shield: So well his Armes this Noble Duke could wield, As such a one he properly should be, That I did meane to consecrate to me: Of so approved and Deliver force, Robert fortunate in those warres. Handling his Lance or brandishing his Blade: For oft he had the leading of their Horse, That where he charg'd, he slaughter ever made, At all assayes so happy to invade: That were he absent, when they gave the chace, It was suppos'd the day did lose the grace. In doubtfull fights, where danger hap'd to fall, He would be present ever by his will, And where the Christians for supplies did call, Thither through perill Robert pressed still, To helpe by Courage, or relieve by skill: To every place so providently seeing, As power in him had absolutely beeing. When in the Morne his Courser he bestrid, He seem'd compos'd essentially of Fire, But from the Field he ever drouping rid, As he were vanquish'd, onely to retyre; Neerest his Rest, the furth'st from his Desire: And in the Spoyles, his Souldiers shar'd the Crownes, They rich in Gold, he onely rich in Wounds. And when they had the Holy Citie wonne, And King thereof they gladly would him make, For which refusall, as some have supposed, God never prospered him. All Sov'raigne Titles he so much did shunne, As he refus'd the Charge on him to take, He the vaine World so clearely did forsake; So farre it was from his Religious Mind, To mixe vile Things, with those of Heav'nly Kind. He would, that him no Triumph should adorne, But His high Prayse, for sinfull Man that dy'd, By him no Marke of Victorie was worne, But the Red Crosse, to tell Him crucify'd; All other Glories he himselfe deny'd; A holy Life but willingly he leads, In dealing Almes, and bidding of his Beads. And as a Pilgrim, he return'd agayne, For glitt'ring Armes, in Palmers homely Gray, Leaving his Lords to leade his Warlike Trayne, Whilst he alone came sadly on the way, Dealing abroad his lately purchas'd Prey; A Hermits Staffe his carefull Hand did hold, That with a Lance the Heathen Foe control'd. But now to end this long-continued Strife; Hence-forth thy Malice takes no further place, Fortune quite vanquished by Fame. Thy Hate began and ended with his Life, By Thee his Spirit can suffer no disgrace, Now in mine Armes his Vertues I imbrace; His Body thine, his Crosses witnesse bee, But mine his Mind, that from thy Pow'r is free. Thou gav'st up Rule, when he gave up his Breath, And where thou endedst, there did I begin, Thy strength was buried in his timelesse Death, And as thy Conqu'ror, lastly come I in; And all thou gott'st, from thee againe I winne: To Me, thy Right I call thee to resigne, And make thy Glory absolutely mine. To the base World then Fortune get thee back, The Earth with drerie Tragedies to fill, Empires and Kingdomes bring thou there to wrack, And on weake Mortals onely worke thy Will; And since thou onely do'st delight in Ill, Heare his Complaint, who wanting Eyes to see, Can lend thee Sight, which art as blind as hee. Duke Roberts Complaint, to the end of the Legend.At her great Words, amazed whilst they stand, The Prince, which look'd most fearefully and grim, Bearing his Eyes in his distressefull Hand, Whose places stood with Bloud up to the brim; And as in anguish, quaking ev'ry Lim, After deepe Sighes, and lamentable Throwes, Thus to the World disburthened his Woes. Deare Eyes, adiew, by Envie thus put out, Where in your places buried is my Joy, With endlesse Darknesse compassed about, Which Death would scarce have dared to destroy; To breed my more perpetuall Annoy, That, even that Sense I onely should forgoe, That could alone give comfort to my Woe. Yee which beheld faire Palestine restor'd, From the prophane hands of the Pagans freed, The Sepulcher of that most glorious Lord, And seene that Place where his deare Wounds did bleed, Which with the Sight my zealous Soule did feed, Sith from your Functions, Night doth you dissever, Seclude me now from Worldly Joyes for ever. Yee saw no Sunne, nor did yee view the Day, Except a Candle, yee beheld no Light, The thick Stone-Wals, those Blessings kept away. What could be fear'd? yee could not hurt the Night, For then Teares wholly hind'red yee of Sight: O then, from whence should Henrie's Hate arise, That I saw nothing, yet that I had Eyes! The wretched'st Thing, the most despised Beast, Enjoyes that Sense as gen'rally as we, The very Gnat, or what then that is least, Of Sight, by Nature kindly is made free. What Thing hath Mouth to feed, but Eyes to see? O, that a Tyrant then should me deprave, Of that which else all living Creatures have! Whilst yet the light did mitigate my mone, Teares found a meane, to sound my sorrowes deepe, But now (aye me) that Comfort being gone, By wanting eyes, wherewith I erst did weepe, My cares alone concealed I must keepe. O God, that blindnesse, darkning all delight, Should above all things give my sorrow sight! Where sometime stood the Beauties of this face, Lampes cleerly lighted, as the Vestall flame, Is now a Dungeon, a distressefull place, A Harbor fit for Infamie and Shame: Which but with horrour one can scarsly name, Out of whose darke grates, miserie and griefe, Starved, for vengeance daily begge reliefe. The day abhorres me, and from me doth flye, Night still me followes, yet too long doth stay, Th'one I o'rtake not, though it still be nye, Th'other comming vanisheth away, But what availeth, either night, or day? All's one to me, still day, or ever night, My light is darknesse, and my darknesse light. O yee, wherewith I did my comfort view, Th'all covering Heaven, and Glorie that it beares, No more that sight shall e'r be seene of you! The blessed Sunne, that every mortall cheeres, Eclips'd to me, eternally appeares, Robert, betake thee to the darksome Cell, And bid the World eternally farewell. His speech thus ending; Fortune Discontent, Turned her selfe, as shee away would flie, Playing with Fooles, and Babes incontinent, As never touch'd with humane miserie, As what she was, her selfe to verifie, And straight forgetting what she had to tell, To other speech, and Girlish laughter fell. When gracefull Fame, convaying thence her charge, (As first with him, she thither did resort,) Gave me this Booke, wherein was writ at large, His life, set out, though in this Legend short, T'amaze the World, with this so true report: But Fortune, angrie with her Foe, therefore Gave me the gift that I should still be poore. FINIS. THE LEGEND OF MATILDA. If yet a Muse there happily remayne, That is by truth so diligently taught, As caring not on foolish things to faine, Will speake, but what with Modestie shee ought; If this be such, which I so long have sought, By her I crave, my life may be reveal'd, Which blacke Oblivion hath too long conceal'd. Oh, if such favour I might hap to find; Here on this earth, but once to speake agen, And to disburthen my oppressed mind, By the endevour of a powerfull Pen, In these my sorrowes, happie were I then: Foure hundred yeeres by all men over-past, Finding one friend to pittie me at last. O, you, of him, so happily elect, Whom I intreat to prosecute my Storie, Lady, most deare, most worthy of respect, To the Authours vertuous Mistris, whom Matilda intreateth she may bee patternd by: in the two Stanza's The Worlds rar'st Jewell, and your Sexes Glorie, It shall suffice, if you for me be sorrie, Reading my Legend, builded by his Verse, Which must hereafter serve me for a Herse. Be you the patterne, by whose perfect view, Like your faire selfe he wisely may me make, For sure alyve, none fitter is then you, Whose forme unspotted Chastitie may take: Be you propitious, for whose only sake, For me I know, hee'll gladly doe his best, So you and I may equally be blest. The beauteous Paramour of Henry the Second.Bright Rosamond, exceedingly is graced, Inrolled in the Register of Fame, Nay, in our Sainted Kalender is placed, By him who strives to stellifie her name, Yet will the modest say, She was too blame; Though full of state, and pleasing be his Rime, Yet all his skill cannot excuse her Crime. The faire Concubine of Edward the Fourth. Elstred the Paramour of King Locryne, supposed the eldest Sonne of Brute, which Elstred with her Daughter Sabrina, were by Guendoline, Wife to the said Locrine, drowned in that River (now by us) cald Severne.The Wife of Shore winnes generall applause, Finding a Pen laborious in her Prayse. Elstred reviv'd to plead her pittied cause, After the envie of so many dayes: And happie's he their Glorie high'st can rayse. Thus the loose Wanton liked is of many: “Vice still finds Friends, but Vertue seldome any. To vaunt of my Nobilitie were vaine, Which were, I know, not bett'red of the best, Nor would beseeme an Honourable Straine, And me a Mayden fits not of the rest: All transitorie Titles I detest, A vertuous Life, I meane, to boast alone: “Our Birth's, our Sires, our Vertues be our owne. “Thou that do'st fetch thy long Descent from Kings, “If from the Gods derived thou could'st be, “And shew'st th'atchiev'ments of those wondrous things; “Which thou thy selfe then livedst not to see, “These were their owne, and not belong to thee, “If thou do'st staine that Honour which was theirs, “Who could not leave their Vertues to their Heires. Heaven powr'd downe more abundance on my Birth, Then it before had usually bestow'd, And was in me so bountifull to Earth, As though her very utmost she had show'd, Her Graces so immeasurably flow'd, That such a shape, with such a spirit inspir'd, Even of the wisest made me most admir'd. Upon my Brow sat Beautie in her Pride, To her beholders ministring her Law, And to them all her Bounties so divide, As did to her their due attention draw; And yet mine Eye did keepe her so in awe, As that which only could true Vertues measure, Ordain'd by Nature to preserve her Treasure. My carriage such, as did content the wise, My tongue did that sweet decencie retaine, As of the yonger, was not deem'd precise, Nor of the aged was accounted vaine, So well instructed to observe the meane, As if in Nature, there were scarce that good, Which wanted in the temper of my bloud. In me so did she her perfections varie, As that the least, allow'd not of compare, And yet so well did teach me them to carrie; Then they could be, as made them seeme more rare, Or in my portion would have none to share, Or in her grace would none should be but I; Which she had made the Minion of the Skie. Whence Fame began my Beautie first to blaze, And soone became to lavish in the same, For she so stuft her Trumpet with my prayse, That every place was fild up with my name, For which Report, thou too much wert to blame, “But to thy doome, is Beautie subject still: “Which hath beene cause of many Ladies ill. This tattling Gossip hath a thousand eies, Her ayrie bodie hath as many wings, Now about earth, now up to Heaven she flies, And here, and there, with everie breath she flings, Hither, and thither, Lyes and Tales she brings, Nothing so secret, but to her appeareth, So doth she credit every thing she heareth. “And Princes eares stand open to Report, “All strive to blaze a Beautie to a King, “Which is the only subject of a Court, “Whither Fame carries, and whence she doth bring; “And which of either, she doth loudly ring: Thither aye me, unhappily she brought, Where I my bane infortunately caught. There stood my Beautie boldly for the Prize, Where the most cleere and perfect Judgements be, And of the same, the most Judiciall Eyes Did give the Goale impartially to me: So did I stand unparaleld and free, And as a Comet in the Evening Skie, Strooke with amazement every wondring Eye. Which soone possest me of Imperiall John, And of my Soveraigne, him my subject made, By this, his Freedome was quite overthrowne, Him, and his power, this wholly did invade, From this, no Reason could the King disswade, This taught his eies, their due attendance still, This held the reines which over-rul'd his will. The Lord Robert Fitzwater, a man of great Nobilitie, descended of the Baynards, and Standard bearer of London, by Descent.When my grave Father, great that time in Court, And by his Bloud thought equall to the best, Having his Eare oft strooke with this Report, Which, as ill newes, it hardly could digest, And on my good since all his hopes did rest, He soone pursude it, by those secret Spies, Which still in Court attend the Princes eyes. And to the World although he seem'd to sleepe, Yet sought he then the Kings intent to sound, And to himselfe, as secrets he did keepe, What his fore-sight had providently found: So well this wise Lord could conceale his wound, Yet wislyer cast, how dangerous it might prove, To crosse the course of this Impatient Love. For as he found how violent a flame, My Youth had kindled in this lustfull King, So found he too, if he should stop the same, Upon us both what mischiefe it might bring: Which knowne to him, so dangerous a thing, He thought to prove how He could Me perswade, Ere for my safetie further meanes he made. Deare Girle, quoth he, thou seest who doth awaite, The Lord Fitzwaters wise counsell to his faire Daughter: in the nine following Stanza's T'intrap thy Beautie, bred to be thy foe, That is so faire, and delicate a Baite, As every eye it selfe would here bestow: Whose power the King too sensibly doth know, Of his Desire that what the end may bee, Thy Youth may feare, my Knowledge doth foresee. Thinke, how thou liv'st here publikely in Court, Whose priviledge doth every meane protect, Where the ensample of the greater sort, Doth more then Oportunitie effect, None thriving here that stand upon respect, Being a Lotterie whereat few doe winne, And yet those seldome neither, but by sinne. Here everie day thou hast to tempt thy sight, All that thy youth to pleasure may provoke, That still at hand, wherein thou tak'st delight, Which with thy Sex doth strike too great a stroke, Having withall Imperious Power thy Cloke, With such strong Reasons on his part propounded, As may leave Vertue seemingly confounded. Many the waies, that lead thee to thy fall, But to thy safetie, few, or none to guide thee, And when thy danger is the great'st of all, Even then thy succour is the most denyde thee: Sundry the meanes from Vertue to divide thee, Having withall Mortalitie about thee, Frailtie within, Temptation neere without thee. “The Letchers Tongue is never void of guile, “Nor wants he Teares, when he would winne his prey, “The subtilst Tempter hath the smoothest stile, “Syrens sing sweetlyest when they would betray: “Lust of it selfe had never any stay, “Nor to containe it, bounds could have devised, “But most when fild, is least of all sufficed. And to availe his pleasure is there ought, That such a Prince hath not within his power? And thus be sure hee'l leave no meanes unsought, Soft golden drops did pierce the Brazen Towre, Watching th'advantage of each fitting houre, Where every minute serves to doe amisse, Thy banefull Poyson spiced with thy blisse. And when this lustfull and unbrideled rage, Which in him now doth violently raigne, Time shall by much sacietie asswage, Then shall thy fault apparant be, and plaine, To after-ages ever to remaine, “Sinne in a Chaine leads on her Sister Shame, “And both in Gives are fettred to Defame. Kings use their Loves as Garments they have worne, Or as the meate whereon they full have fed, The Saint once gone, who doth the Shrine adorne? Or what is Nectar, on the ground if shed? What Princes wealth redeemes thy Mayden-head, Which should be held as precious as thy breath, Whose dissolution consummates thy death? The stately Eagle from his highest stand, Through the thin Ayre the fearefull Fowle doth smite, Yet scornes to touch it lying on the Land, When he hath felt the sweet of his delight, But leaves the same a prey to every Kite. “With much we surfet, Plentie makes us poore, “The wretched Indian scornes the Golden Ore. When every Period pointing with a Teare, He in my Bosome made so wide a Breach, As it each Precept firmely fixed there, His Counsell as continually to preach, My Father so effectually could teach, So that his Words I ever after found, As grav'd on an inviolable ground. The King, whose Love deluded was the while, Yet in his Bosome bare this quenchlesse fire, Finding his Hopes like Flatt'rers to beguile, And not one jot to further his Desire, But gone thus farre he meant not to retire, And thinkes, if fitly he could find but place, His Words had power to purchase him my Grace. For since all former Practices did faile, Nor to his Mind ought kindly tooke effect, He with himselfe resolv'd me to assaile, Having before assayled her by Letters and Messengers. And other meanes doth utterly neglect: In spight what Feare could any way object, His Courage doth all hindrances confute, And me accosting thus commenc'd his Suite. Know, Girle, quoth he, that Nature thee ordayned, King Johns Courting of Matilda: in eight Stanza's following. (As her brav'st Piece, when Shee to Light would bring, Wherein Her former Workmanship Shee stayned) Only a Gift to gratifie a King, And from all other, as a seld-seene Thing, Seal'd thee a Charter dated at thy Birth, To be the fayr'st that e'r was made of Earth. Hoord not thy Beautie, when thou hast such store: Wer't not great pittie it should thus lye dead, Which by thy lending might be made much more? (For by the use should every thing be fed) Yea, and to Him, so hard for thee bestead, Yet no more lesned then the Sunne, whose sight, Though it light all things, loseth not his light. From those two Starres such Streames of Lightning glide, As through Mens eyes doe pierce the Flintiest Heart, Which thou by closing, striv'st in vaine to hide, For through their Lids their subtill Rayes doe Dart, Such Power wise Nature did to them impart, Those two bright Planets, cleerer then the Seven, That with their Splendor, light the World to Heaven. Were Art so curious in her selfe to know, Thy Rare perfections rightly in their kind, In Beautie thy Divinitie to show, O! it were able to transport the Mind, Beyond the Bounds by Heaven to it assign'd: But, O in thee, their excellence is such, As Thought cannot ascend to, once to touch. He is thy King, who is become thy Subject, Sometime thy Lord, now Servant to thy Love, Thy Angell Beauties be his onely object, Who for thy sake a thousand deaths dares prove. “A Princes Prayer should much compassion move: Let Wolves and Beares be cruell in their kinds, But Women meeke, and have relenting Minds. Vouchsafe to looke upon these brimfull Eyes, With Tydes of Teares continually frequented, Where Love without food, hunger-starven lyes, Which to betray me, trayterously consented, And for the fact being lawfully convented, Is in these Waters judg'd to have his beeing, For his presumption through these Eyes Thee seeing. Sit thou commanding under mine Estate, Having thy Temples, honoured with my Crowne, A Beautie destin'd for no meaner Fate, And make the Proud'st to tremble with a Frowne, Raise whom thou wilt, cast whom it please thee downe, Be thou alone the Rect'resse of this Ile, With all the Titles I can thee instile. What if my Queene, repyning at our Blisse, As great Ladies have their Argoses, so great Lords have their Mercuries. A Fable most frequent. Thee as did Juno, Joves deare Darling keepe? Mine Ile preserve as that Great God did his, Wise Mercury lul'd Argus Eyes to sleepe, “Love ever Laughes, when Jealousie doth Weepe, When most Shee stirs, my Power shall keepe her under, Shee may raise Stormes, but I doe rule the Thunder. Thus having made an entrance for his Love, Which he beleev'd assuredly in Time, Of better newes the Messenger might prove, By which, he after to his Joyes might Clime, Hoping a fayre Full to ensue this Prime, Leaves me, not knowing well which way to turne Mee, Warm'd with the Fire, that unawares might burne Mee. Upon my Weakenesse which so strongly wrought, Riches and Honour are great Temptations to Youth and Beautie. That in my Brest a Mutinie arose, Feare, and Desire, a doubtfull Combat fought, Like two most eager and ambitious Foes, Th'one fayne would winne, th'other would not lose, By this oft cleered, and by that accused, Whilst still, I fear'd, by both to be abused. And in my Selfe, my Selfe suspected Treason, Knowing who watch'd to winne Me for his Prey, And in so fit and dangerous a Season, When Youth and Beautie bare so great a sway, And where He batterie still to me might lay, Who girt so strongly every way about, Well might I feare, I could not long hold out. But setting all these sundrie Doubts aside, From Court resolv'd I secretly to goe, And to what Place my happy Starres should guide, There, I my selfe determin'd to bestow, Untill Time might this Passion over-blow, Or, if at least it wrought not, the extrusion Might strengthen me, yet, in my Resolution. When my brave Sire, that never me forsooke, But many a sweet Sleepe for my safetie brake, Much being pleased with the course I tooke, As one that truely suffred for my sake, So called of one Baynard, a Noble man, who was Founder thereof, in the time of the Conquerour.Did his aboad at Baynards Castell make, Whom since I thus had left the Court, to leave me To his Protection, gladly did receive me. Whence all those sorrowes seem'd to me, exil'd, Where in my Life I long before did waste, The present Time, and happily beguild, To thinke what perill I had lately past, There in my Freedome fortunately plac't, Even as a Bird escap'd the Fowlers snare, Which former Danger warned to beware. When the proud King, whose purposes were crost, Which this my flight had hapned to prevent, And that those Meanes to which he trusted most, Were those, which most had hindred his intent, Finding his Suite preposterously went, Another Course bethinks himselfe to runne, Else farther off, then when he first begunne: And thenceforth plotteth to disperse the Masse, Which lay so full betwixt Him and the Light, That in his Suite the only hindrance was, And (least expected) wrought Him most despight, Finding the Cause why Matters went not right, He must forecast my Father to remove, Or he was like to walke without his Love. Thus scarsly cur'd of this late sickly Qualme, And that my Heart sat happily at ease, But as a Ship, that in a quiet Calme Flotes up and downe on the unsurging Seas, By some rough Gust which some ill Starre doth rayse, Is driven backe into the troubled Mayne, Even so was I, that safely else had layne. For this great King, whom thus I did reject, First seeks in Court my Father to disgrace, Thereby to give the People to suspect, To fault in some thing sitting neere his Place, Them by all meanes it urging to imbrace, To which, if cleerely he could find the Way, He made no doubt, but once to have a Day. And for his purpose to promoove his Hate, Into the Plot, he his Court Devils drew, Cunning in all the Stratagems of State, Which he suborn'd my Father to pursue, By whose devices he soone overthrew That Noble Lord, which succour should have given To me, that then was from all refuge driven. And not their cleere and far-discerning sight, The Friends of the Lord Fitz-Water, stucke so close to him against the King, about Matilda, that they raysed a Civill Warre in the Kingdom. Into the Quarrell that did throughly looke, Nor our Allies that to their utmost might, 'Gainst his proceedings on our part that stooke, And at our need us never once forsooke, Of the Kings malice could th'effect prevent, But to Exile my Father must be sent. Not all his service to his Soveraigne done, In Warre couragious, and in Counsaile sound, Which from King John compassion might have wonne, To him, who faithfull evermore was found, “Ingratitude, how deeply do'st thou wound! “Sure, first devised to no other end, “But to grieve those whom nothing could offend. Forlorne, and hopelesse, left before my Foe, By my ill Fortune, basely thus betrayd, Never poore Mayden was besieged so, And all depressed that should lend me ayd, Such waight the Heaven upon my Birth had layd, “But yet her selfe true Vertue never loseth, “'Gainst her faire course, though Hell it selfe opposeth. Imbarqu'd for France, his sad dejected Eyes Swolne up with Teares in most abundant store, His ill lucke threatned by the lowring Skyes, Feare him behind, and sorrow him before, He under Saile, from sight of either Shore, Wasteth withall, his sad laments in vaine, To the rude Waters only to complaine. A Simile of the extreme shifts that Matilda was drawne to.When, like a Deere, before the Hounds imbost, When him his strength beginneth to forsake, Leaves the smooth Launds to which he trusted most, And to the Covert doth himselfe betake Doubling, and creepes from Brake againe to Brake, Thus still I shift me from the Princes Face, Who had me then continually in Chace. The Coast thus cleer'd, Suspicion layd to rest, And each thing fit to further his intent, It with much pleasure quieted his Brest, That every thing so prosperously went, And if the rest successefully consent: Of former ayde I being quite forsaken, He hopes, the Fort might in short time be taken. “A Princes Armes are stretch'd from Shore to Shore, “Kings sleeping, see with Eyes of other Men, “Craft finds a Key to open any Dore, Little it boots my selfe in Walls to pen, The Lambe was closed in the Lyons Den, Whose watchfull Eyes too easily descry'd me, And found me soon'st, where sur'st I thought to hide me. My Paths by Spyes he diligently noted, O'r me he held so vigilant a Watch, And on my Beautie he so fondly doted, That at each Looke he enviously did catch, And readie still attending at my Latch He had those, that continually did Ward, Treason my Hand-mayd, Falshood was my Guard. And since with me it fell so crosly out, That to my shifts so hardly he me drave, For some new course, I thought to cast about, Where safer Harbour happily to have: For this was not sufficient me to save, His Power so spacious every way did lye, That still I stood in his ambitious Eye. And feare which taught me every meane to prove, And with my selfe of many to debate, Me at the last it pleas'd the Powers to move, To take upon me a Religious state, The Holy Cloyster none might violate, Where after all these Stormes I did indure, There, I at last might hope to live secure. Wherefore, to Dunmow I my selfe convayd This Lady was of the Baynards Family, who were Lords of Dunmow. Into an Abbey, happily begunne, By Juga, of our Ancestry, a Mayd, At whose sole charge that Monast'rie was done, Wherein Shee after did become a Nunne, And kept her Order strictly with the rest, Which in that Place Virginitie profest, Where I my selfe did secretly bestow From the vaine World, which I too long had try'd, Me, my affliction taught my selfe to know, My Youth and Beautie gently that did chide, And by Instruction, as a skilfull Guide, Printed withall such coldnesse in my Blood, That it might so perpetuate my good. The King, who heard, Me safely thus to bee Set in my Cloyster, strongly discontent, That Me from thence he had not power to free, Which his sad brest, seem'd strongly to torment: But since, that I so wilfully was bent, And He, past hope then, ever to enjoy me, Resolv'd, by some meanes, lastly to destroy me. Great Men, when they will doe mischiefe, want not their instruments.And finding one most fit for such a Fact, To whom he durst his secret Thoughts impart, One, for his King, that any thing would Act, And for the purpose wanted not his Art, That had a strong Hand and relentlesse Hart, On him, the King (with me poore Mayd enrag'd) Impos'd my Death, and him thereto engag'd. Who making haste the fatall Deed to doe, Thither repayres, but not as from the King, For well he knew what did belong thereto, Nor therein needed any Tutoring, But as one sent upon some needfull thing, With a smooth Count'nance and a settled Brow, Obtayn'd to get in where I payd my Vow. Where I alone, and to his Tale expos'd, (As one, to him a willing Eare that lent) Himselfe to me, he but too soone disclos'd, And who it was that thither had him sent, From Point to Point relating his intent, Who, whilst I stood strooke dumbe with this invasion, He thus pursues me strongly with perswasion. The Murtherers speech to Matilda, before he poysoned her: in sixe Stanza's following.Heare but (saith he) how blindly thou do'st erre, Fondly to dote upon thine owne Perfection, When as the King thee highly will preferre, Nay, and his Power attendeth thy Protection, So indiscreetly sort not thy Election, To shut that in a melancholy Cell, Which in a Court ordayned was to dwell. Yet further thinke, how dang'rous is his offer, If thy neglect doe carelessly abuse it; Art thou not mad, that thus do'st see a Coffer, Fild up with Gold, and profferd, to refuse it? So farre, that thou want'st Reason to excuse it, Thy selfe condemning in thine owne good hap, Spilling the Treasure cast into thy Lap. Wrong not thy faire Youth, nor the World deprive Of these rare Parts which Nature hath thee lent, 'Twere pitie thou by Niggardise should'st thrive, Whose wealth by waxing craveth to be spent, For which, thou of the wisest shalt be shent, Like to some rich Churle hoording up his pelfe, Both to wrong others, and to starve himselfe. What is this vaine and idle Reputation, Which to the shew you seemingly respect? Only the weakenesse of Imagination, Which, in Conclusion, worketh no effect, And lesser can the Worshippers protect, That only standeth upon fading Breath, And hath at once the Being and the Death. A feare that grew from doting Superstition, To which your weake Credulitie is prone, And only since maintayned by Tradition, Into our Eares impertinently blowne, By Folly gathered, as by Errour sowne, Which us still threatning, hindreth our desires, Yet all it shewes us, be but painted Fires. Perswade thy selfe this Monast'rie to leave, Which Youth and Beautie justly may forsake, Doe not thy Prince of those high Joyes bereave, Which happy Him, more happy Thee may make, Who sends me else, thy Life away to take, For dead to him if needsly thou wilt prove, Dye to thy selfe, be buryed with his Love. Rage, which resum'd the likenesse of his Face, Matilda in miserable perplexitie. Whose Eye seem'd as the Basiliske to kill, The horror of the solitarie Place, Being so fit wherein to worke his Will, And at the instant he my Life to spill, All seem'd at once my o'rethrow to further, By feare disswaded, menaced by murther. In this so great and peremptorie Tryall, With strong Temptations sundrie wayes afflicted, With many a yeelding, many a denyall, Oft-times acquitted, often-times convicted, Terror before me lively stood depicted, When as it was, that but a little Breath Gave me my Life, or sent me to my Death. But soone my Soule had gath'red up her Powers, Which in this need might friendlike give her ayd, The resolution of so many howers, Whereon her selfe shee confidently stayd In her distresse, whose helps together layd, Making the State which shee maintayned good, Expell'd the feare usurping on my Blood. The brave resolution of a chaste Ladie.And my lock'd tongue, did liberally inlarge, From those strict limits wherein long confin'd Care had it kept, my Bosome to discharge, And my lost spirits their wonted strength assign'd Into mine eyes which comming as refin'd, Most bravely there mine Honour to maintayne, Checkt his Presumption with a coy Disdayne. Who finding Me inviolably bent, And for my Answere only did abide; Having a Poyson murd'ring by the scent, If to the Organ of that sense apply'd, Which for the same, when fittest time He spy'd, Into my nostrils forcibly did strayne, Which in an instant wrought my deadly bane. With his rude tuch, my Vaile disordred then, My Face discovering, my delicious Cheeke Tinkted with Crimson, faded soone agen, With such a sweetnesse, as made Death seeme meeke, And was to him beholding it most like, A little sparke extinguish'd to the Eye, That glowes againe e'r suddenly it dye. And whilst thereat amazed he doth stand, Wherein he then such excellencie saw, Ruing the spoile done by his fatall hand, What naught before, Him this at last could awe, From his sterne Eyes, as though it Teares would draw, Which wanting them, wax'd suddenly as dead, Grieving for me, that they had none to shead. When Life growne faint, hies lastly to my heart, The only Fort to which She had to take, Feeling cold Death, to seize on every part, A strong Invasion instantly to make. Yet e'r She should Me utterly forsake, To Him who sadly stood Me to behold, Thus in mild words, my griefe I did unfold: Is this the Gift, the King on Me bestowes, Matilda's last words to him that had given her the Poyson: in three Stanza's. Which in this sort he sends thee to present Me? I am His Friend, what gives He to His Foes, If this in Token, of His Love be sent Me? But 'tis his Will, and must not discontent Me: Yet after (sure) a Proverbe this will prove, The Gift King John bestow'd upon His Love. When all that Race in memorie are set, And by their Statues, their Atchievements done, Which wonne abroad, and which at home did get, From Sonne to Sire, from Sire againe to Sonne, Grac'd with the spoyles, that gloriously they wonne: O, that of Him, it only should be said, This was King John, the Murth'rer of a Maid! O, keepe it safely from the mouth of Fame, That none doe heare of this unhallowed Deed, Be secret to Him, and conceale his Shame, Lest after-Ages hap the same to reade, And that the Letters shewing it doe bleed! O, let the Grave mine Innocencie hold, Before of Him, this Tyrannie be told! Thus having spoke, my sorrowes to asswage, The heavie burthen of my pensive brest, The Poyson then that in my braine did rage, His deadly Vigour forcibly exprest, Not suffring me to stand upon the rest, Longer for Him, it was no time to stay, And Death call'd on, to hasten Me away. Thus in my Closet being left alone, Upon the floore uncomfortably lying, The Fact committed, and the Murth'rer gone, Arrived at the utmost point of dying, Some of the Sisters, Me by chance espying, Call'd all the rest, that in most wofull plight, Came to behold that miserable sight. A Simile of Matilda, at her dying, with her Sister-hood about Her.Thus like a Rose by some unkindly blast, 'Mongst many Buds, that round about it grow, The with'ring Leaves improsp'rously doth cast, Whilst all the rest, their soveraine Beauties show: Amidst this goodly Sister-hood even so, Nipt with cold Death, untimely did I fade, Whilst they about me, pittious wailing made. A good Conscience, the greatest and last Comfort in Death.And my sad Soule upon Her sudden flight, So soone forsaken of each severall sense, With all the horrour Death could her affright, Strongly disturbed at her parting hence, All Comfort fled her; for her last defence, Doth to Her spotlesse Innocence betake her, Which left Her not, when all the rest forsake Her. “To shew, our Pleasures are but Childrens Toyes, “And as meere shaddowes, or like bubbles passe, “As Yeeres increase, so waning are our Joyes, “Forgotten as our Favours in a Glasse, “A very Tale of that which never was: “Even so, Death us, and our Delights can sever, “Vertue alone abandoneth us never. My Spirit thus from Imprisonment enlarg'd, Glad to have got out of her earthly Roome, My Debt to Nature faithfully discharg'd, And at the houre appointed on my Toombe: Such was the Heavens inevitable Doome, Me Baynards Castle to the World did bring, The two places made famous by Matilda. Dunmow, againe my place of burying. And scarsly was my breathlesse Body cold, But ev'ry-where my Tragedie was spred, For tattling Fame in ev'ry place had told, My Resolution being lately dead, Ruing my Bloud so prodigally shed, And to my Father, flyes with this mischance, That time remayning in the Court of France. His losse too great to be bewaild with Teares, It was not Words that could expresse his Woe, Griefe had her selfe, so settled in his Eares, No more might enter, nothing out might goe. Scarce since Man was, was Man perplexed so, Enough of Sorrow is alreadie showne, And telling His, were to renew mine owne. Let it suffice Me, that I here relate, And beare My selfe the burthen of My ill, If to the Life I have express'd My Fate, It's all I aske, and I obtayne my Will. “For that true Sorrow needs not others Skill; “Enough's that present bitternesse we taste, “Without remembring of that which is past. Some say, the King repentant for this Deed, When his Remorce to thinke thereof Him drave, Poorly disguised in a Pilgrims Weed, Offered His Teares on my untimely Grave, For which, no doubt, but Heaven his Sinne forgave, And my Bloud, calling for Revenge, appeas'd, He from the Sinne, I from my Labours eas'd. To his Mistris, as She began, so She endeth her Legend.Thus told my Storie, I my Love devise To you deare Madame, fitt'st with you to rest, Which all my Vertues daily exercise That be inprinted in your patient brest, By whom alone I rightlyest am exprest, For whom my Prayse, it grieves Me, is too scant, Whose happie Name an Epethite shall want. Then, most sweet Lady, for a Maidens sake, To shead one teare if gently you but daigne, For all my Wrongs it full amends shall make, And be my passe to the Elizian Plaine, In your chaste Eyes such power there doth remaine, As can th'afflicted prosp'rously deliver, Happie be they, who looke upon them ever. FINIS. THE LEGEND OF PIERCE GAVESTON. From gloomie shaddowes of eternall Night, Shut up in Darknesse, endlesly to dwell, O, here behold, Me miserable Wight, Awhile releas'd, my Tragedie to tell, Let Me have leave my Sorrowes to impart, Somewhat to ease my sad afflicted Heart. Goddesse of Armes, and Arts, Pallas Divine, The Goddesse of Wisdome and Armes. Let thy bright Fauchion lend Me Cypresse Boughes, Be thou assisting to this Poet of mine, With Funerall Wreath's ingarlanding His Browes, Pittying my Woes, when none would heare Me weepe, That for my Sorrowes, layes His owne to sleepe. Thou mournfulst-Mayden of the Sacred Nine, The Muse of Tragedie. That Balefull sounds immovably do'st breathe, With thy swolne Visage, and thy blubb'red Eine, Let Me to Thee, my sad Complaints bequeathe. Ne'r to thy Selfe canst thou winne greater Glorie, Then in exactly setting forth my Storie. Tell how the Fates my giddie Course did guide, Th'inconstant turnes of ev'rie changing houre, By many a low Ebbe, many a lustie Tide, Many a smooth Calme, many a sowsing Showre, The height whereto, I lastly did ascend, Bend my Beginning to my Fatall End. When our first Edward, sat on Englands Throne, A most excellent King. The first of that name after the Conquest. Long-shanks, who long victoriously did raigne, First of that Name, and Second yet to None: In what to Knight-hood ever did pertayne; My Life began, a Life so full of Blisse, Then in His Dayes, those happie Dayes of His. Vertue did then Mens hearts so much inflame, That no Promotion could be got with Gold; For in his dayes He that desired Fame, A happie and blessed Raigne.Bought it of Him, that it full dearely sold, Hatefull Excesse so much did not devoure, Law had lesse force, and honestie more Power. And since swift Time so violently preyes, Upon those Ages that even holiest be; Let Me remember those so happie Dayes; In these sad houres, which my vex'd Eyes doe see, With greater griefe to make me to deplore These, when I thinke of those that were of yore. Then Muse, lo, I obsequiously appeale To thee, (my life since I intend to show) That thou of Me wilt faithfully reveale, Even what the most Inquisitive would know, Whilst here my Soule inbodyed did abide, In this vaine World, which pampred Me with Pride. Descended as some skilfull Heralds set downe from a Castle of that name.By Birth a Gascoyne, of a faire Descent, And of our House, the Heire My Father borne, In all His Warres, that with King Edward went, To Him His Liegeman, and a Souldier sworne, And in our Countrey left His whole Estate, To follow Him, who seem'd to governe Fate. Whose trust that Great King highly did imploy, And neere His Person had Him for the same, Who with my Selfe, then but a little Boy, Into the Court of Famous England came, Whereas the King for Service by Him done, Made Me a Page to the brave Prince his Sonne. The excellent shape and features of Pierce Gaveston. All Men in Shape I did so farre excell; (The Parts in Me such Harmonie did beare) As in my Modell, Nature seem'd to tell, That Her perfection She had placed here, As from each Age reserving the rar'st Feature, To make Me up, Her excellentest Creature. My Lookes so powerfull Adamants to Love, And had such Vertue to attract the Sight, That they could fix it, or could make it move, As though it followed some Celestiall Light, That where my Thoughts intended to surprize, I at my pleasure conquer'd with mine Eyes. As if some great Apelles in his Art, A Simile of his perfections. Would that the World His Master-piece should know, Imagination doing then her part; When he had done the utmost he could doe, For that rare Picture to fit out a Mind, This one was I, the Wonder of my kind. This daintie Bait I layd for Edwards Love, Which soone upon Him got so sure a Tye, As no misfortune e'r could it remove, When She the utmost of Her force did trye, Nor death it selfe had after power to sunder, O seld-seene Friendship, in the World a Wonder! Love, on this Earth, the only Meane thou art, Whereby we hold Intelligence with Heaven, And it is thou that only do'st impart, The good that to Mortalitie is given. An admiration of Love. O, Sacred Bond, by Time that art not broken! O thing Divine, by Angels to be spoken! Thus with young Edward, bath'd in worldly Blisse, Whilst Tutors care His wandring Yeeres did guide, I liv'd, enjoying whatsoe'r was His: Who ne'r my Pleasure any thing deny'd. Whose watchfull Eye so duly Me attended, As on my safetie, if His life depended. But whether it my rare Perfections were, That wonne my youth such Favour in His Eye, Or it pleas'd Heaven (to shew it held Me deare) To showre on Me this Blessing from the Skye, I know not, but it rightly could direct, That could produce so powerfull an effect. O thou dread Booke, where our Fates are enroll'd, Who hath so cleere Eyes, as to looke into thee? What is that Man, by whom thou art controll'd, An admiration of the power of Fate.Or hath the Key of Reason to undoe thee, When none but Heaven, thy darke Decrees can know, Whose depth we sound not, which dwell here below? The soule Her liking easly can espye, (By Sympathie, to Her by Heaven assign'd) Through Her cleere Windowes, the wel-seeing Eye, Which doth convay the Image to the Mind, Without advisement, and can apprehend, That whose true cause, Mans knowledge doth transcend. Jove is fained in the shape of an Eagle, to beare away Ganimed a Phrygian boy, and to make him his Cup-bearer in Heaven.This Edward in the Aprill of his Age, Whilst yet the Crowne sat on his Fathers head, Like sportfull Jove, with his rapt Phrygian Page, Me with Ambrosiall Delicacies fed, He might command that was the Soveraign's Sonne, But my direction only must be done. My Will a Law, authentically past, My Yea, by Him was never cross'd with No, In His affection chain'd to Me so fast, That as my shaddow still he seem'd to goe, To Me this Prince, so plyant was in all, Still as an Eccho answering to My call. My Smiles His life, so joy'd He in my sight, That His Delight was led by my Desire, From my cleere Eyes, so borrowing all His Light, The Ancients so faine the Sunne and Moone, the Children of Latona.As pale-fac'd Cynthia, from her Brothers fire. He made my Cheeke, the Pillow for His Head, My Brow His Booke, my Bosome was His Bed. Venus, so called of a Hill where She was honoured.Like faire Idalia, bent to amorous sport, With young Adonis, in the pleasant shade, Expressing their affections in that sort, A Simile of the wantonnesse of Prince Edward and Gaveston.As though her utmost passion should perswade The one of us, the other still to move, To all the tender Dalliances of Love. The Table thus of our Delight was lay'd, Serv'd with what Dainties Pleasure could devise, And many a Syren sweetly to us play'd, But Youth had not, us therewith to suffice: For we on that insatiately did feed, Which our Confusion afterwards did breed. For still I spurr'd up his untam'd Desire, The Prince another Phaeton. Then sitting in the Chariot of the Sunne, My blandishments were Fuell to that fire, Wherein He fry'd: I for his flight begunne To wax His Wings; and taught Him Art to flie, Gaveston, another Dedalus to his Icarus, the Prince. Who on His backe, might beare Me through the Skie. Whilst the vaine World so cunningly could winne Us, Her false Flatteries, who too long did trust, Till having lost the Clue which led us in, We wandred in the Labyrinth of Lust: “For when the Soule is nusl'd once in Vice, “The sweet of Sinne, makes Hell a Paradice. Who to the full, thy vilenesse, World, e'r told, An Exclamation against the World. What is in Thee, that's not extremely ill? A lothsome Shop, where poysons only sold, Whose very entrance instantly doth kill, Nothing in Thee but villanie doth dwell, And all thy wayes lead head-long into Hell. The King, whose trust I lewdly had betrayd, As Phaeton, when he undertooke to guide his Fathers Chariot. His Sonne, like Phaeton, vent'ring on the Skies, Perceiv'd his course was per'lous to be stayd, For he was Grave, and wonderfully wise, And if with skill he curb'd not his desire, Edward might easly set his Throne on fire. This was a corsive to old Edwards dayes, The King grievously perplexed for the ill courses of his Sonne. And without ceasing fed upon his Bones, That in the Day bereav'd him of his ease, Breaking his Nights sleepe with continuall mones, This more depres'd, and sadlyer way'd him downe, Then the care else, belonging to his Crowne. And though he had judicially descryde The cause, from whence this maladie first grew, It was no cure, unlesse he could provide Meanes to prevent the danger to ensue, Wherefore, he for his purpose made them way, Against my courses, that had ought to say. When those in Court, my Opposites that were, This faire advantage and could finely take, And for my Fall, what did to them appeare, So fitly for their purposes to make, Thereon their Forces instantly to ground, Me to the World perpetually to wound, What thing so false, but taken was for truth, So that on me a scandall it might bring, By such as stucke not to accuse my Youth, To sinne in the unnaturall'st thing, And all fore-passed outrages awake, Me to Mankind contemptible to make? Pierce Gaveston banished the Kingdome.Wherefore, the Prince more straitly was bestow'd, In forrayne Realmes and I adjudg'd to roame, And sharply censur'd to be held abroad, Who had betrayd my hopefull trust at Home, Adjudg'd to dye, were I by any found, After my set Day, on the English ground. That, as astounded with a mightie blow, I stood awhile insensible of payne, Till somewhat wakened by my colder woe, I felt the wound, by which my Joyes were slayne, By which I faynted hourely, more and more, Nor could I thinke, what cure could me restore. A Simile of Gavestons departure from the Prince.But as a Turtle for her loved Make, Whose Youth her deare Virginitie injoy'd, Sits shrowded in some solitarie Brake, With melancholy pensivenesse annoy'd, Thus without comfort sate I all alone, From the Sweet Presence of Prince Edward gone. My Beautie, that disdayn'd the Summers sight, Now fouly beaten with bleake Winters stormes, My Limbs were put to travell Day and Night, So often hugg'd in Princely Edwards Armes, Those Eyes oft viewing Pleasure in her pride, Saw fearefull Objects on their either side. Whilst in these Tempests I was strangely tost, My selfe confining in my native France, By many a sad calamitie still crost, Inseparables to my sore mischance, Others that stem'd the Current of the Time, Whence I had falne, strove suddenly to Clime. Like the Camelion, whilst Time turnes the hue, A God of Sea, fayned to take sundrie shapes. And with false Proteus puts on sundrie shapes, This change scarce gone, a second doth ensue, One fild, another for promotion gapes, Thus doe they swarme like Flyes about the brim, Some drownd, and some doe with much danger swim. And some, on whom the Sunne shone wondrous fayre, Yet of the Season little seem'd to vaunt, For there were Clouds hung in the troubled Ayre, Threatning, that they of their desires might want, Which made them flagge, prepared else to flye, Whilst with their Falls, they fading Honour buy. When posting Time, that never turnes againe, Whose winged Feet flie swiftly with the Sunne, By the Fleet houres attending on his Traine, His Revolution fatally begunne, And in his course brought suddenly about, That, which before the wiser sort did doubt. For whilst King Edward wholly doth attend, The death of Edward Longshanks. A happy Voyage to the Holy Land, For which the Laytie mightie Summes did lend, Even whilst this businesse hotly was in hand, See, but to me what fortune there can fall, This Conquerors death hath quickly alterd all. Never was there of the English a more excellent King then Edward the first.Should I presume his Prayses to report, Thinking thereby to grace his so great Name, My meane indevours would fall farre too short, And I too much should but impaire his Fame, Ile leave that to some sacred Muse to tell, Upon whose Life a Poets Pen might dwell. Scarce was his Body lap'd up in the Lead, Before his dolefull Obsequies were done, The Coronation of Edward the second.When Englands Crowne was set on Edwards head, With whom too soone my joyfull dayes begun, As the black Night at the approching Day, My former sorrowes vanished away. So called of the Towne of Carnarvon in Northwales, where he was borne. Edward Carnarvon calls me from Exile, Whom Edward Longshanks banish'd to his death, I, whom the Father held most base and vile, Was to the Sonne as precious as his Breath, What th'old King writ, the yong King forth did blot, “Th'alive's remembred, dead mens words forgot. The faire Wind wafts me to that wish'd-for Place, And sets me safely on that blessed Shore, From whence I seem'd, but banish'd for a space, That my returne might honor'd be the more, There to my lov'd Lord, happily to leave me, Whose Armes were cast wide open to receave me. A Roman Lady that dyed with extreme joy.Who would have seene that Noble Roman Dame, O'rcome with joy, give up her vitall Breath, Her Sonne returning, sounded in by fame, When thankefull Rome had mourned for his death. Might here behold her personated right, At my approch, to my deare Edwards sight. A Metaphor from the motions of the Celestiall Bodies.My Jove, now Lord of the Ascendant is, In an Aspect, to promise happy speed, And such on me that influence of his, As prays'd the Course, wherein we did proceed, Yet most prodigious it to some appeares, Telling the Troubles of ensuing Yeares. When like to Midas all I touch'd was Gold, Upon me showr'd, as into Dana's Lap, For, I obtayned any thing I would, So well had Fortune lotted out my hap, “For Princes Treasures like to Oceans are, “To whom all Rivers naturally repayre. The Isle of Man, the first, to me he gave, Pierce Gaveston his Reliefe, Offices, &amp; Marriage: in the foure following Stanza's. He could not stay, untill I would demand, And to be sure to give, ere I could crave, I next received from his bounteous Hand, Faire Wallingford, which many yeeres had beene, The wealthy Dower of Elianor the Queene. Those Summes his Father had beene levying long, By Impositions, for the Warre abroad, Other his Princely benefits among, At once on me he liberally bestow'd, When some that saw, how much on me he cast, Perceiv'd, his wealth could not maintayne his waste. He gave me then his Secretaries place, Thereby to trayne me in affaires of State: Me in those Roomes, that I was in, to grace, And Earle of Cornwall frankly did create, Besides, in Court more freely to partake me, Of England, he High Chamberlayne did make me. And to the Royall Blood me to aly, Pierce Gaveston marryed Isabel, the third Daughter of the Earle of Glocester, which the Earle had by the Kings Sister. (Which did but backe my humour of Ambition) In Bands of Wedlocke did to me affie, A Lady of an excellent condition, Which Joane of Acres his deare Sister bare, To th'Earle of Gloster, that right Noble Clare. O blessed Bountie, giving all content! An admiration of Bountie. The only Fautresse of all Noble Arts, That lend'st successe to every good intent, A grace that rests in the most Godlike Hearts, By Heaven to none, but happy Soules infused, Pitie it is, that ere thou wast abused. When those here first that my Exile procur'd, Which in my Heart still hated did abide, As they before, by no meanes me endur'd, So were they now impatient of my pride, “For Emulation ever did attend “Upon the Great, and shall so to the end. The policy of an advanced Favourite.To crosse whom, into favour I wrought those, That from meane Places lifted up by me, Being factious Spirits, were fittest to oppose Them, that perhaps too powerfull else might be, That against Envie raysed by my Hand, Must uphold me, to make themselves to stand. Having my Frame so cunningly contriv'd, To boulster me in my ambitious Wayes, I shew'd the King my hate to be deriv'd, From those high Honours that he on me layes, Drawing him on (my courses to partake) Still to maintayne what he himselfe did make. Thus did my Youth but exercise extreames, My heed was Rashnesse to forerunne my Fall, My Wit but folly, and my Hopes but dreames, My Counsell serv'd my selfe but to inthrall, Abusing me but with a vaine Illusion, And all together hasting my Confusion. King Edward espoused to Isabel the French Kings Daughter.When as King Edward hastneth his repaire, T'espouse the Princesse Isabel of France, Daughter to Philip that was call'd the Faire, Gaveston Protector of the Kingdome.By which he thought his strength much to advance, And here at Home to perfect my command, He left me the protection of the Land, Giving me Power so absolute withall, That I dranke pleasure in a plentious Cup, When there was none me to account to call, All to my Hands so freely rendred up, That Heaven on me no greater blisse could bring, Except to make me greater then my King. Thus being got as high as I could clime, With this abundance beyond measure blest, I thought t'imbrace the benefit of Time, Fully to take what freely I possest, “Holding for truth, that he is worse then mad, “Fondly to spare a Princes wealth that had. Their counsell then continually I crost, As scorning their Authoritie and Blood, And those things that concern'd their Honours most, In those against them evermore I stood, And things for publique privately did spend: To feed my Ryot that could find no end: Untill false Fortune, like a treacherous Foe, Which had so long attended on my Fall, In the playne Path wherein I was to goe, Layd many a baite to trayne me on withall, Till by her skill shee cunningly had brought me Into the Trap, where shee at pleasure caught me. For when the Barons hotly went in Hand, An especiall cause of the Barons hatred to Gaveston. With Tilts and Turney's for the Kings returne, To shew the French the glorie of the Land, The fixed Day I labour'd to adjourne, Till all their charge was lastly overthrowne, Who could abide no Glorie but mine owne. Thus sought my Fate me forward still to set, As though some Engine seys'd me with a slight: One mischiefe soone a Second doth beget, The Second brings a Third but on too right, And every one it selfe imployeth wholly, In their just course to prosecute my folly. For when the Barons found me to retayne, Th'ambitious course wherein I first began, And deeply felt, that under my disdayne, Into contempt continually they ran, They tooke up Armes to remedie their wrong, Which their cold Spirits had suffred but too long; The Barons, the second time rise against Gaveston.Me boldly charging to abuse the King, A wastefull Spender of his Wealth and Treasure, A secret Thiefe of many a sacred Thing, And that I led him to unlawfull Pleasure, Who never did in any thing delight, But what might please my Bestiall appetite: That like a sicknesse on the Land was sent, Whose hatefull courses the chiefe cause had beene, The Common-wealth thus totter'd was and rent, And worse and worse yet every day foreseene. Thus was I scandall'd publiquely of many, Who pitied none, not pitied was of any. And since I thus was match'd by Men of might, The King, my danger that discreetly way'd, Seeing them to pursue me with such spight, Me into Ireland secretly convay'd, Till with my Peeres, my peace he might procure, Or might my safetie otherwise assure. A Simile of the great care King Edward had of his Darling Gaveston.Like one whose House remedilesly burning, Seeing his Goods long heap'd together lost, The mischiefe no whit lesned by his mourning, Taketh some one thing that he loveth most, And to some sure place doth with that retire, Leaving the rest to th'mercy of the Fire. The King findeth out shift to shaddow the exile of his Minion.And he that nought deare for me did deeme, So it might serve to cover my disgrace, To make my absence otherwise to seeme, And to the World to beare a fayrer Face, Lest my Exile suggested by their hate, In England here perhaps might wound my State: By their wise Counsell that were him about, Of Ireland he me Deputie doth make, And caus'd it each-where to be given out, My Journey therefore thither I did take, To stop their mouth's that gladly would imbrace The least thing, that might sound to my disgrace. Whereas he set me in that Princely sort, As in my place might purchase me Renowne, With no lesse Bountie to maintayne a Court, Then hourely crav'd th'Revenues of a Crowne, Thither his Bountie so much did me bring, That though he raign'd, yet there was I a King. There were few Weeks, but some the Channell crost The extreme dotage of the King. With sundrie Presents of a wond'rous price, Some Jewell that him infinitely cost, Or some rich Robe of excellent device, That they which saw what he upon me threw, Well might discerne, some change must needs insue. And since the Flow me followed in this wise, The fulnesse I as amply entertayne, It had beene folly to have seem'd precise, To take that, which fell on me like the Rayne, Such as before no Age had ever seene, And since he was, I thinke, hath seldome beene. So that, when the bold Barony had found The Barons found themselves over-wrought by the King. The cunning us'd in covering of my flight, That shifted me but to a surer ground, On which, they vainely had bestow'd their might, Perceiv'd farre off, that greater perill rose, Then they could find how fitly to dispose. Like those that strive to stop some swelling Sourse, A Simile of the Barons and Gaveston. (Whose plentie none can comprehend in bounds) Which climes above th'Opposers of his course, And that which should incircle it, surrounds, That so innated in it selfe is blest, That 'tis the more, the more it is deprest. For fearing much the Force I had abroad, The Barons knowing Gaveston to be ambitious, thought it not fit to give him too much power in Ireland. Who knew the way, the Irish hearts to win, They thought me better here to be bestow'd, And for the State more safely farre therein, Where though my spoile they hop'd not to prevent, Yet could they see the giddy course I went. Of which they scarsly had conceiv'd the thought, And did thereto but seemingly descend, But that the King immediately it caught, Nor car'd he by it, what they did intend, Plot what they could, so he thereby might gayne me, Once in his Court againe to intertayne me. An admiration of the Majesty of Kings.What is so hard, but Majestie commands, Yea, and severely humbleth with the Eye? Whose very Nod acts with a thousand Hands, In it such Vertue secretly doth lye, Having t'uphold it, the high power of Fate, It is Emperious, both o'r Love and Hate. This King, who no occasion could neglect, That ought, me to my happinesse might win, Did with such care my businesses effect, And ever was so fortunate therein, That he to passe in little time did bring, What most Men thought to be a doubtfull thing. When Posts away with their full Packets went, Me out of Ireland instantly to call, Allow'd of by the generall consent, Although not lik'd of inwardly of all, Yet 'twas sufficient that it freedome gave me, But to be here, where he desired to have me. My proud Sayles swelling with a prosp'rous Wind, The boyst'rous Seas did homage to mine Eyes, And much above their usuall course were kind, All lowring Clouds abandoning the Skyes, Nothing discern'd in any Starre to feare me, Fortune her selfe sate at the Helme to stere me. What time the King a Progresse needs would make Canarvon the chiefe Towne of one of the Shires of North Wales where the King was borne.Into North-Wales, His Native Place to see, Which was indeed, but only for my sake, Who at West-Chester, knew to meet with Mee, And there, with all the State He could devise, To doe Me honour, in the Peoples eyes. Where, for my Landing, long He did provide, That nought might want to nourish my Delight, And at each Lodging as along We ride, He entertaind Me, with some pleasing sight, And that the Realme our Friendship might report, We entred London in this Royall sort. Which prov'd sharpe Spurres to my untam'd Desire, Lending the Reines to my lascivious Will, And put Me forth upon my full Careere, On places slipperie, and my manage ill, Small my fore-sight, and over-much my haste, Which Me, alas, infortunately cast. King Edwards Eare when having at command, Pierce Gavestons insatiable Covetousnesse and Pride, exprest in the three Stanza's following. Who ought would have, He must Me entertaine; And yet before it past my gripple hand, I shar'd the great'st part to my private gaine, Nor car'd I what from any I could wring, So I might Coine into my Coffers bring. Then daily beg'd I great Monopolies, Taking the Lands belonging to the Crowne, Transporting all the best Commodities, Usefull to England, needed of her owne, And basely sold all Offices, till then: The due Reward of wel-deserving Men. And being inconsiderately proud, Held all things vile that suted not my vaine, Nothing might passe, but that which I allow'd, A great opinion to my wit to gaine, Giving vile Termes and Nick-names of Disgrace, To Men of great Birth, and of greater Place. Whereby brake out that execrable Rage, Which long before had boyled in their Bloud, Themselves by Oath against Me they engage, Who thus had all Authoritie with-stood, And in the Quarrell up their Armes doe take, Or to marre all, or better it to make. The Barons objections against Gaveston.They durst affirme my Mother was a Witch, And in the fire condemned burnt to be, And I her Sonne, so rightly of her pitch, She had bequeath'd her Sorceries to Me, Urging it on, for a most certaine thing, That I by Magicke wrought upon the King. And into France they charg'd Me to convay A goodly Table of pure Massie Gold, A Relike kept in Windsor many a day, Which to King Arthur did belong of old, Upon whose margent, as they did surmise, There were ingraven Merlins Prophesies. And by appealing to the Sea of Rome, They soone procur'd a Legate to the Land, With Malediction, by the Churches doome, Upon that Man which on my part should stand, The King suspending, should He not consent, To ratifie the Baronies intent. Which they to purpose prosp'rously effect, Then at full strength, to counterpoyse his force, Having withall the Clergie to direct, Them the best way, in their resistlesse course, Pierce Gaveston, the third time banished.Till at the last King Edward they procure, By solemne Oath Me ever to abjure. Th'uncertaine issue of each earthly thing, Set out most lively in my star-crost State, That doth remaine in Fortunes managing, Appearing in my variable Fate: On Me that frown'd and flatt'red Me so oft, Casting Me downe, then setting Me aloft. Pierce Gaveston goeth for Flanders.To Flanders then my present course I cast, Which as the fair'st, so fittest for my ease: “That way is saf'st that soonest can be past, All, not my Friends, that were abroad at Seas, Such Friends in France, they daily did procure, That there my Selfe I doubted to secure. Where though I chang'd my Habit and my Name, Hoping thereby to live unknowne to any; Yet swift Report had so divulg'd my Shame, My hatefull Life was publish'd to too many, That as I past through every Street along, I was the Tale of every common Tongue. From whence I found a secret meanes, to have Intelligence with my kind Lord the King, Who fail'd no Mon'th, but He Me notice gave, What the proud Barons had in managing, And labour'd then, as He had done before, Me into England safely to restore. For which relying on my Soveraignes Love, To whom as Life I had beene ever deare, Which ne'r then now, I had more need to proove, Who strove t'obtaine, if any meane there were, A Dispensation for His former Oath, In their despight that thereto seem'd most loth. Which long debating, We resolv'd at length, Since I by Marriage strongly was alli'd, I at this pinch should stand upon my strength, And should for England, hap what could betyde, And in a Ship that for my Passage lay, Thither my Selfe to secretly convay. Where safely landed on the wished Shore, The third time that Gaveston had bin recald from Exile. With speed to Court I closely Me betooke, Yet gave the King Intelligence before, About what time, He there for Me should looke, Who was devising when I should arrive, The surest way, my safety to contrive. Which the Lords finding, whilst their bloud was hot, That to themselves then only were to trust, For what before was done, avail'd them not, And for my sake, they found the King unjust, Bringing thereby, whilst trifling they doe stand, Spoile on themselves, and perill on the Land. Who was so dull, that did not then distaste, That thus the King His Nobles should neglect? And those in Court, We for our purpose plac'd, Gave us just cause their dealings to suspect, And they that view'd Us with the pleased'st Eye, Yet at our Actions often look'd awry. The King goeth to Yorke, to gather power against the BaronsWhich made King Edward presently provide A chosen Convoy of His chiefest Friends, To guard Me safe to Yorke, to be supply'd With Forraine Succours, and to Scotland sends, To Warlike Baliol, and to Wales, from whence, He hop'd for Power to frustrate their presence. The two Marches of Wales and Scotland.But they His Agents, quickly intercept, Not then to seeke, in so well-knowne a thing, And both the Marches they so strictly kept, That none could enter to assist the King, Only to chastise my abhorred sinne, Who had the Cause of all these Troubles bin. A Simile expressing Gavestons incertaine estate.Thus like a Ship despoiled of her Sailes, Shoov'd by the Wind against the streamfull tyde, This way the one, that way the other hales, Now tow'rds this Shore, and now tow'rds that doth ryde, As that poore Vessell's, such my brittle stay, The neerer Land, the neerer cast away. An Exclamation against Civill Discention.Thou Kingdomes Corsive, home-begotten Hate, In any Limits never that wast bounded, When didst thou yet seize upon any State, By Thee that was not utterly confounded? How many Empires be there that doe rue Thee? Happie the World was, till too well it knew Thee. Thus of all succour utterly bereft, Only some small force that We had at Sea, For us to trust to, Fortune had us left, On which our Hopes, upon this Upcast lay, Which We to hasten speedily doe make, Our former Courses, forced to forsake. Our present perill hapning to be so, That did for aide importunately call, Wherefore in Yorke, as safest from the Foe, He left Me to the keeping of the Wall, Till His Returne Me further aide might give, Whom more and more, He studied to releeve. The Barons then from Bedford setting on, Bedford, the place where the Barons gathered their power against Gaveston. Th'appointed Randy where they gath'red head, When they had notice that the King was gone, Tow'rds Yorkeshire with celeritie them sped, To seize my Person purposed that were, Whose presence else might make them to forbeare. When leaving Yorke, to Scarborough I post, A place of mighty strength, so called of the scituation: as much to say, as standing upon a Rocke, for the old Inhabitants of those Countries called Rockes, Scars. With that small Force, the Citie had to lend Me, The strongest Fort, that stood upon the Coast, And of all other likest to defend Me, Which at the worst, from whence in their Despight, The Hils at hand might priviledge my Flight. But they which kept the Countrey round about, Upon each passage set so watchfull Spies, Of well-wall'd Yorke that I was scarsly out, But on their light-Horse after Me they rise, And suddenly they in upon Me came, Ere I had time to get into the same. Thence with intent tow'rds Oxford to convay Me, When by the way, as Birds doe at the Owle, Some wondred at Me, some againe did bay me, As hungrie Wolves at Passengers doe howle: Each one rejoycing that I thus was caught, Who on the Land these Miseries had brought. Conducted thus to Dedington at last, A Towne of Oxfordshire, not farre from Banbury. Where th'Earle of Aymer de Valence. Pembrooke will'd Me to be stay'd, To understand before they further past, What by the King could on my side be sayd, About this Businesse, and tow'rds Edward went, T'acquaint Him with the generall intent. Warwicke standeth in the Verge of the old Forrest of Arden, wherefore he called Him so.But th'Earle of Warwicke (lying but too neere) The Dogge of Arden that I us'd to call, Who mortall Hatred did Me ever beare, He whom I most suspected of them all, Thither repayring with His powerfull Band, Seized upon Me with a violent hand. To Warwicke Castle carrying Me along, (Where He had long desired Me to get) With Friends and Tenants absolutely strong, Whom all the puisant Baronie abet, Which, since occasion offred them such hold, Hasten my Death by all the meanes they could. North from the Towne, a mile, or very neere, A little Hill in publike view doth lye, Guyes Cliffe, so called of Guy of Warwick's Statue there preserved, in which place Hee lived an Heremeticall life, when He grew aged.That's called Blacklow, of the Dwellers there, Neere to the ancient Hermitage of Guy, To which, the Lords Me as a Traytor led, And on a Scaffold tooke away my Head. My Life and Fortunes lively thus exprest, In the sad Tenor of my Tragique Tale, Let Me returne to the faire fields of rest, Thither transported with a prosp'rous gale, And leave the World my Destinie to view, Bidding it thus eternally adiew. THE LEGEND OF GREAT CROMWELL. Awak'd, and trembling betwixt Rage and Dread With the lowd slander (by the impious Time) That of my Actions every-where is spred, Through which to honour falsly I should clime: From the sad dwelling of th'untimely dead, To quit Me of that Execrable Crime, Cromwell appeares, his wretched plight to show, Much that can tell, as one that much did know. Roughly not made up in the common mould, That with the vulgar vilely I should die, What thing so strange of Cromwell is not told? What man more prays'd? Who more condemn'd then I? That with the World when I am waxed old, Most't were unfit that Fame of Me should lie, With Fables vaine my Historie to fill, Forcing my good, excusing of my Ill. You, that but hearing of my hated Name, Your ancient Malice instantly bewray, And for my sake your ill-deserved Blame, Upon my Legend publikely shall lay; Would you forbeare to blast Me with Defame, Might I so meane a priviledge but pray, He that three Ages had endur'd your wrong, Heare Him a little who hath heard you long, Since Romes sad Ruine here by Me began, Who Her Religion pluckt up by the Root, Of the false World such Hate for which I wan, Which still at Me her poisned'st Darts doth shoot; That to excuse it, doe the best I can, Little, I feare, my labour Me will boot Yet will I speake my troubled Heart to ease, Much to the Minde, Her selfe it is to please. O powerfull Number, from whose stricter Law, Heart-mooving Musike did receive the Ground Which Man to faire Civility did draw, With the brute Beast when lawlesse He was found: O, if according to the wiser Saw, There be a high Divinitie in sound, Be now abundant prosp'rously to aide The Pen prepar'd, my doubtfull Case to plead. Cromwell borne at Putney. Putney the Place made blessed by my Birth, Whose meanest Cottage simply Me did shrowd, To Me as dearest of the English Earth; So of my bringing that poore Village proud, Though in a time when never lesse the Dearth Of happie Wits, yet Mine so well allow'd, That with the best She boldly durst prefer Me, that my breath acknowledged from Her. Twice flow'd proud Thames as at my comming wood, Striking the wondring Bord'rers with Feare, And the pale Genius of that aged floud, To my sicke Mother labouring did appeare, And with a Countenance much distracted stood, Threatning the Fruit Her pained Wombe should beare: My speedy Birth being added thereunto, Seem'd to fore-tell, that much I came to doe. Who was reserved for those worser daies, As the great Ebbe unto so long a Flow, When what those Ages formerly did raise, This, when I liv'd, did lastly overthrow, And that great'st Labour of the World did seize, Only for which immedicable Blow Due to that Time, Me dooming Heaven ordain'd, Wherein Confusion absolutely raign'd, Vainly yet noted this prodigious Signe, Often Predictions of most fearefull things, As Plagues, or Warre, or great Men to decline, Rising of Commons, or the Death of Kings; But some strange Newes though ever it divine, Yet forth them not immediately it brings, Untill th'effects Men afterward did learne, To know that Me it chiefly did concerne. Whilst yet my Father by His painfull Trade, Whose labour'd Anvile only was His Fee, Whom my great tow'rdnesse strongly did perswade, In Knowledge to have educated Mee: But Death did Him unluckily invade, Ere He the fruits of His Desire could see, Leaving Me young, then little that did know, How Me the Heavens had purpos'd to bestow. Hopelesse as helplesse most might Me suppose, Whose meannesse seem'd their abject breath to draw: Yet did my Brest that glorious fire inclose, Which their dull purblind Ignorance not saw, Which still is settled upon outward Showes, The Vulgars judgement ever is so raw, Which the unworthiest sottishly doe love, In their owne Region properly that move. Yet Me my Fortune so could not disguise, But through this Cloud were some that did Me know, Which then the rest, more happie or more wise, Me did relieve when I was driven low, Which as the stayres by which I first did rise, When to my hieght I afterward did grow, Them to requite, my Bounties were so hie, Cromwell famous for thankfulnesse. As made my Fame through every Eare to flie. That height and Godlike puritie of Minde, Men of the greatest Bloud, not alwayes most vertuous. Resteth not still, where Titles most adorne With any, nor peculiarly confinde To Names, and to be limited doth scorne: Man doth the most degenerate from kinde, “Richest and poorest both alike are borne; “And to be alwaies pertinently good, “Followes not still the greatnesse of our Bloud. Pitie it is, that to one vertuous Man That Marke him lent, to Gentrie to advance, Which first by Noble industrie he wan, His baser Issue after should inhance, And the rude Slave not any good that can, Such should thrust downe by what is his by chance: As had not He beene first that him did raise, Ne'r had his great Heire wrought his Grandsires praise. How weake art thou that makest it thy end, To heape such worldly Dignities on thee, When upon Fortune only they depend, And by her changes governed must bee? Besides the dangers still that such attend, Livel'est of all Men pourtrayed out in mee, When That, for which I hated was of all, Soon'st from me fled, scarce tarrying for my fall. You that but boast your Ancestors proud Stile, And the large Stem whence your vaine Greatnesse grew, When you your selves are ignorant and vile, Nor glorious Thing dare actually pursue, That all good Spirits would utterly exile, Doubting their worth should else discover you, Giving your selves unto Ignoble things; Base I proclaime you, though deriv'd from Kings. Vertue, but poore, God in this Earth doth place, 'Gainst the rude World to stand up in his right, To suffer sad affliction and disgrace, Not ceasing to pursue her with despight: Yet when of all shee is accounted base, And seeming in most miserable plight, Out of her Power new Life to her doth take, Least then dismayd, when all doe her forsake. That is the Man of an undaunted spirit, For her deare sake that offereth him to dye, For whom, when him the World doth disinherit, Looketh upon it with a pleased Eye, What's done for Vertue thinking it doth merit, Daring the proudest menaces defie, More worth then Life, how ere the base World rate him, Belov'd of Heaven, although the Earth doth hate him. Injurious Time, unto the Good unjust, O! how may weake Posteritie suppose Ever to have their merit from the Dust, 'Gainst them thy partialitie that knowes! To thy report, O who shall ever trust, Triumphant arches building unto those, Allow'd the longest memorie to have, That were the most unworthy of a Grave! But my cleere mettle had that powerfull heate, As it not turn'd with all that Fortune could: Nor when the World me terriblest did threat, Could win that place, which my high thoughts did hold, That waxed still more prosperously great, The more the World me strove to have controll'd, On mine owne Columnes constantly to stand, Without the false helpe of anothers Hand. My Youthfull course thus wisely did I steere, T'avoid those Rocks my wracke that else did threat: Yet some faire Hopes from farre did still appeare, If that too much my wants did me not let: Wherefore my Selfe above my Selfe to beare, Still as I grew, I knowledge strove to get, To perfect that which in the Embryon was, Whose Birth, I found, Time well might bring to passe. But when my meanes to faile me I did find, My selfe to Travell presently I tooke, For 'twas distastefull to my Noble mind, That the vile World into my wants should looke, Being besides industriously inclinde, To measure others Actions with my Booke, My Judgement more to rectifie thereby, In matters that were difficult and hye. When, loe, it hapt, that Fortune as my Guide, Cromwell Secretarie to the Merchants. Of me did with such providence dispose, That th'English Merchants then, who did reside At Antwerpe, me their Secretarie chose, (As though in me to manifest her pride) Whence to those Principalities I rose, To plucke me downe, whence afterward shee fear'd, Beyond her Power, that almost shee had rear'd. When first the wealthy Netherlands me trayn'd, In wise Commerce most proper to that Place, And from my Countrie carefully me wayn'd, As with the World it meant to winne me Grace, Where great experience happily I gayn'd; Yet here I seem'd but tutor'd for a space, For high imployment otherwise ordayn'd, Till which, the Time I idlely entertayn'd. Geffrey Chambers sent to Rome by the Towne of Boston, to renew the Pardons for the said Towne, for the maintenance of their Port, wan Cromwell to goe along with him. Cromwells forwardnesse to any course that might raise him.For Boston businesse hotly then in hand, The charge thereof on Chambers being layd, Comming to Flanders, hapt to understand Of me, whom he requested him to ayd; Of which, when I the benefit had scand, Weighing what time at Antwerpe I had stayd, Soone it me wonne faire Italy to trie, Under a cheerefull and more luckie skie: For what the meanest cleerely makes to shine, Youth, Wit, and Courage, all in me concurre: In every project, that so powerfull Trine, By whose kind working bravely I did sturre, Which to each high and glorious designe (The Time could offer) freely did me spurre, As, forcing Fate, some new thing to prepare, (Shewing successe) t'attempt that could me dare: Where now my Spirit got roomth it selfe to show, To the fayr'st pitch to make a gallant flight, From things that too much earthly were and low, Strongly attracted by a Genuine light, Where higher still it every day did grow; And being in so excellent a plight, Crav'd but occasion happily to prove, How much it sate each vulgar Spirit above. The good successe th'affaires of England found, Much prays'd the choice of me that had beene made: For where most Men the depth durst hardly sound, I held it nothing boldly through to wade, My selfe, and through the straitest wayes I woond. So could I act, so well I could perswade, As meerely Joviall in my selfe was I, Compos'd of freedome and alacritie. Cromwell sung Freemens Songs to the Pope, which were strange at Rome.Not long it was ere Rome of me did ring, (Hardly shall Rome so full dayes see agen) Of Freemens Catches to the Pope I sing, Which wan much licence to my Countrimen, Thither, the which I was the first did bring, That were unknowne to Italy till then: Light humours, them when judgement doth direct, Even of the Wise winne plausible respect. And those, from home that Pensions were allow'd, And there did for Intelligence remayne, Under my power themselves were glad to shrowd, Russell and Pace, yea, oftentimes were fayne, Two Secretaries imployd in France. When as their Names they durst not have avow'd, Me into their Societie t'retayne, Rising before me, Mightie as they were, Great though at home, yet did they need me there. In forraine parts neere Friends I yet forsake, That had before beene deeply bound to mee, And would againe I use of them should make, But still my Starres command I should be free, And all those offers lightly from me shake, Which to requite, I fettred else might bee; And though that oft great perils me oppung, And meanes were weake, my mind was ever strong. Yet those great wants, Fate to my Youth did tye, Me from the pompe of those rich Countries drive, Thereby inforc'd with painfull industrie, Against affliction manfully to strive, Cromwells noble and undaunted Spirit. Under her burthen faintly not to lye: But since my good I hardly must derive, Into the same I thought to make my way, Through all the Power against me shee could lay. As a Comedian and my life I led, Cromwell driven to hard shifts. For so a while my need did me constraine, With other my poore Countrimen (that plai'd) Thither that came in hope of better gaine: Whereas when Fortune seem'd me low to tread Under her feete, shee set me up againe, Untill her use bad me her not to feare, Her good and ill that patiently could beare. Till Charles the fift th'Emperiall Power did bend The siege of Rome by the Duke of Burbon. 'Gainst Rome, which Burbon skilfully did guide, Which fast-declining Italy did rend; For th'Right that him her Holinesse denide, Wholly her selfe inforced to defend 'Gainst him that justly punished her pride, To which my selfe I lastly did betake, To see thereof what fortune meant to make. And at the siege with that great Generall serv'd, When he first girt her stubborne waste with steele, Within her Walls who well-neere being starv'd, And that with faintnesse shee began to reele, Shewing her selfe a little as shee swarv'd: First her then noting I began to feele, Shee, whose great power so farre abroad did roame, What in her selfe shee truely was at home. That the great Schoole of the false World was then, Where her's their subtill practices did vie, Amongst that mightie confluence of Men, French plots propt up by English policie, The German powers, false shuffling, and agen All countermin'd by skilfull Italy, Each one in possibilitie to win, Great rests were up, and mightie hands were in. Here first to worke my busie brayne was set, (My inclination finding it to please This stirring World which strongly still did whet) To temper in so dangerous assayes, Which did strange formes of policies beget; Besides in times so turbulent as these, Whereto my studies wholly I did bend To that which then, the wisest made their end: Cromwell maketh use of his travell.And my experience happily me taught Into the secrets of those Times to see, From whence to England afterward I brought Those slights of State deliv'red there to mee, In t'which there then were very few that sought, Nor did with th'humour of that age agree, Which after did most fearefull things effect, Whose secret working few did then suspect. When though 'twere long, it hapned yet at last, Some Hopes me homeward secretly allur'd, When many perils strangely I had past, As many sad calamities endur'd: Beyond the Moone, when I began to cast, By my rare parts what place might be procur'd, If they at home were to the Mightie knowne, How they would seeme compared with their owne. Or if that there the Great should me neglect, As I the worst that vainely did not feare, To my experience how to gayne respect In other Countries that doe hold it deare, I no occasion vainely did reject, Whil'st still before me other rising were, And some themselves had mounted to the skie, Little before unlike to thrive as I. When now in England Bigamie with blood Lately begot by Luxurie and Pride, In their great'st fulnesse peremptorie stood; Some that those courses diligently ey'd, Slily were fishing in that troubled Flood, For future changes wisely to provide, Finding the World so rankely then to swell, That till it brake, it never could be well. But floting long upon my first arrive, Whil'st many doubts me seemed to appall, Like to a Barke that with the Tide doth drive, Having nought left to fasten it withall, Thus with the Time by suffring I doe strive Into what Harbour doubtfull yet to fall; Untill inforc'd to put it to the chance, Casting the fair'st, my fortune to advance. Making my selfe to mightie Woolsey knowne, Cardinall Woolsey at that time in the height of his Glorie. That Atlas, which the governement upstay'd, Who from meane place in little time was growne Up to him, which that weight upon him lay'd, And being got the neerest to his Throne, He the more easly this great Kingdome sway'd, Leaning thereon his wearied selfe to breathe, Whil'st even the Greatest sat him farre beneath. Where learned More and Gardiner I met, Men, in those Times, immatchable for wit, Able that were the dullest Spirit to whet, The excellentest Men of those times. And did my humour excellently fit, Into their Ranke and worthily did get There as their proud Competitor to sit. “One Excellence to many is the Mother, “Wits doe, as Creatures, one beget another. The Builder of White Hall and Hampton Court.This Founder of the Palaces of Kings, Whose Veines with more then usuall Spirit were fild, A Man ordayned to the mighti'st Things, In Oxford then determining to build To Christa Colledge, and together brings All that thereof the great Foundation wills, There me imployes, whose industrie he found Worthy to worke upon the noblest Ground. Yet in the entrance wisely did he feare Coyne might fall short, yet with this worke on fire, Wherefore such Houses as Religious were, Whose being no necessitie require, But that the greater very well might beare, From Rome the Card'nall cunningly did hire, Winning withall his Soveraigne to consent, It colouring with so Holy an intent. This like a symptome to a long disease, Was the forerunner to this mightie Fall, And but too unadvisedly did ceaze Upon the part that ruinated all, Which, had the Worke beene of so many dayes, And more againe, recover hardly shall: But, loe, it sunke, which Time did long uphold, Where now it lyes even levell'd with the mold. Thus, thou great Rome, here first wast overthrowne, Thy future harmes that blindly couldst not see, And in this worke they only were thine owne, Whose knowledge lent that deadly wound to thee, Which to the World before had they not showne, Ne'r had those secrets beene descry'd by mee, Nor by thy wealth so many from the plow, Worne those high Types wherein they flourish now. For which, my Master Woolsey might and mayne, Into such favour with the King me brought, Tow'rds whom my selfe so well I did demeane, As that I seem'd to exercise his thought, And his great liking strongly did retayne, With what before that Card'nall had me taught, From whose example, by those Cells but small, Sprang the subversion lastly of them all. Yet many a let was cast into the way, Wherein I ranne so steadily and right, And many a snare my Adversaries lay, Much wrought they with their power, much with their slight, Wisely perceiving that my smallest stay Fully requir'd the utmost of their might, To my ascendant hasting then to clime, There as the first predomining the time. Knowing what wealth me earnestly did woo, Which I through Woolsey hapned had to find, And could the Path most perfectly unto, The King thereafter earnestly inclin'd, Seeing besides what after I might doe, If so great Power me fully were assign'd, By all their meanes against me strongly wrought, Lab'ring as fast to bring their Church to nought. Whil'st to the King continually I sue, And in this businesse faithfully did stirre, Strongly t'approve my judgement to be true, 'Gainst those who most supposed me to erre, Nor the least meanes which any way I knew Might grace me, or my purposes preferre Did I omit, till I had wonne his Eare, Most that me mark'd, when least he seem'd to heare. This wound to them thus violently given, Envy, at me her sharpest Darts did rove, Affecting the Supremacy of Heaven, As the first Gyants warring against Jove, Heap'd Hills on Hills, the Gods till they had driven, The meanest Shapes of Earthly things to prove: So must I shift from them that 'gainst me rose, Mortall their hate, as mightie were my Foes. But their great force against Me wholly bent, Prevail'd upon my purposes so farre, Cromwell in danger to have beene thrust out of the Kings Favour. That I my Ruine scarsly could prevent, So momentarie worldly Favours are, That till the utmost of their spight was spent, Had not my spirit maintain'd a manly Warre, Risen they had, when I had layne full low, Upon whose Ruine after I did grow. When the Great King, their strange Reports that tooke, Who as pernicious as they potent were, And at the faire growth of my Fortune strooke, Whose deadly Malice blame Me not to feare, Me at the first so violently shooke, That they this frame were likely downe to beare, If Resolution with a settled Brow, Had not upheld my peremptorie Vow. Yet these Encounters thrust Me not awry, Nor could my Courses force Me to forsake, After this Shipwracke I againe must try, Some happier Voyage hopefull still to make: The Plots that barren long we see doe lie, Some fitting Season plentifully take. “One fruitfull Harvest frankly doth restore “What many Winters hindred have before. That to account I strictly call my Wit, How it this while had managed my State, My Soule in counsell summoning to sit, If possible to turne the course of Fate, For wayes there be the greatest things to hit, If Men could find the peremptorie gate, And since I once was got so neere the Brinke, More then before, 't would grieve Me now to sinke. Secretarie Russell, after Earle of Bedford, and Hayles Master of the Rolles, labour for Cromwell. Russell, whose Life (some said) that I had sav'd In Italy, one that Me favoured most, And Reverend Hayles, who but occasion crav'd To shew his Love, no lesse that I had cost, Who to the King perceiving Me disgrac'd, Whose favour I unluckily had lost, Both with Him great, a foot set in withall, If not to stay, to quallifie my Fall. High their regard, yet higher was their hap, Well-neere quite sunke, recover Me that could, And once more get me into Fortunes Lap, Which well my selfe might teach Me there to hold, Escap'd out of so dangerous a trap, Whose prayse by Me to Ages shall be told, As the two props by which I only rose, When most supprest, most trod on by my Foes. This Me to urge the Premunire wonne, The Clergy falne into a Premunire. Ordain'd in Matters dangerous and hie, In t'which the heedlesse Prelacie were runne, That backe unto the Papacie did flie, Sworne to that Sea, and what before was done, Due to the King, dispensed were thereby, In t'which first entring offred Me the Meane, That to throw downe, alreadie that did leane. This was to Me that over-flowing Sourse, From whence His Bounties plentifully spring, Whose speedie current with unusuall force Bare Me into the Bosome of the King, By putting Him into that readie course, Which soone to passe His Purposes might bring, Where those which late imperiously controld Me, Strooke pale with feare, stood trembling to behold Me. When State to Me those Ceremonies show'd, That to so great a Favourite were due, And Fortune still with Honours did Me load, As though no meane, She in my rising knew, Or Heaven to Me, more then to Man had ow'd, (What to the World unheard of was and new.) And was to other sparing of her store, Till She could give, or I could aske no more. Those high Preferments He upon Me laid, To make the World Me publikely to know, Were such, in judgement rightly being wai'd, Seemed too great for Me to undergoe, Nor could His Hand from powring on be stai'd, Untill I so abundantly did flow, That looking downe whence lately I was clome, Danger bad Feare, if further I should rome. For first from Knighthood rising in degree, The Office of the Jewell-house my lot, After, the Rolles he frankly gave to Me, From whence a Privie Counseller I got, Cromwels greatnesse. Then of the Garter: and then Earle to be Of Essex: yet sufficient these were not, But to the great Vicegerencie I grew, Being a Title as Supreme as new. Poore and mean people, to whom He had beene beholding, he would take knowledge of, as he rode, and liberally reward.So well did Me these Dignities befit, And Honour so Me every way became, As more then Man, I had beene made for it, Or as from Me it had deriv'd the Name: Where was he found? whose love I not requit, Beyond His owne imaginarie aime, Which had Me succor'd neerely being driven, As things to Me that idly were not given? What Tongue so slow, the Tale shall not report Francis Friscobald a Florentine.Of Hospitable Friscobald and Mee, And shew in how reciprocall a sort My thankes did with his Courtesie agree, When as my Meanes in Italy were short, That Me reliev'd, I lesse that would not bee, When I of England, was Vicegerent made, His former Bounties lib'rally repaid? The Storie of the Lord Cromwell and Friscobald, in the thirteene following Stanza's.The manner briefly gentler Muse relate, Since oft before it wisely hath beene told, The sudden change of unavoided Fate, That famous Merchant reverend Friscobald, Grew poore, and the small remnant of His State, Was certaine Goods to England He had sold, Which in the hands of Creditors but bad, Small hope to get, yet lesser Meanes He had. Hither His Wants Him forcibly constrain'd, Though with long travell both by Land and Seas, Led by this Hope, that only now remaind, Whereon His Fortune finally He layes, And if He found that Friendship here were fain'd, Yet at the worst it better should Him please, Farre out of sight, to perish here unknowne, Then unreliev'd be pittied of His Owne. It chanc'd as I tow'rd Westminster did ride, 'Mongst the great concourse passing to and fro, An aged Man I happily espide, Whose outward lookes much inward griefe did show, Which made Me note Him, and the more I ey'd Him, Me thought more precisely I should know: Revolving long, it came into My minde, This was the Man to Me had beene so kind. Was there withall so joyed with His sight, (With the deare sight of His so reverend Face) That I could scarsly keepe Me from t'alight, And in mine armes Him kindly to embrace; Weighing yet (well) what some imagine might, He being a Stranger, and the publike place, Checkt my affection, till some fitter houre, On Him my Love effectually might showre. Never, quoth I, was Fortune so unjust, As to doe wrong to thy most Noble Heart, What Man so wicked could betray the trust Of one so upright, of so good desert? And though obey Necessitie thou must, As when th'wast great'st, the same to Me thou art, Let Me alone the last be left of all, That from the rest declin'd not with thy Fall. And calling to a Gentleman of mine, Wise and discreet that well I knew to bee, Shew'd Him that Stranger, whose dejected Eyne, Fixt on the Earth, ne'r once lookt up at Mee, Bid yonder Man come home to Me and dine (Quoth I) bespeake Him reverently you see, Scorne not His Habit, little canst thou tell, How rich a Minde in those meane Rags doth dwell. He with my Name that kindly did him greet, Slowly cast up His deadly-mooving Eye, That long time had beene fixed on His feet, To looke no higher then His Miserie, Thinking Him more Calamitie did greete, Or that I had supposed Him some Spie, With a deep sigh that from His heart He drew, Quoth He, His Will accomplisht be by you. My Man departed, and the Message done, He whose sad Heart a strange Impression strooke, To thinke upon this accident begunne, And on Himselfe suspiciously to looke, Into all doubts He fearfully doth runne, Oft Himselfe cheering, oft himselfe forsooke: Strangely perplext, He to my House doth come, Not knowing why judg'd, nor dreading yet His doome. My Servants set His comming to attend, That were therein not common for their skill, Whose usage yet the former did amend: He hop'd not good, nor guiltie was of ill, But as a Man whose thoughts were at an end, Fortune (quoth He) then worke on Me thy will: Wiser then Man I thinke He were that knew, Whence this may come, or what will it ensue. His Honour'd presence so did Me inflame, That being then in presence of my Peeres, I sdaigned not to meete Him as He came, (That very hardly could containe my teares) Kindly salute Him, call Him by His name, And oft together aske Him how He cheeres; Which still along maintaining the extreme, The Man thought sure, He had beene in a Dreame. At length to wake Him, gently I began With this demand, If once He did not know One Thomas Cromwell, a poore Englishman, By Him reliev'd when He was driven low? When I perceiv'd He my remembrance wan, Yet with His teares it silently did show: I wept for woe, to see mine Oast distrest: But He for joy, to see His happie Ghest. Him to the Lords I publisht by my praise, And at my Table carefully Him set, Recounting them the many sundrie wayes, I was to this good Gentleman in debt, How great He was in Florence in those dayes, With all that Grace or Reverence Him might get: Which all the while yet silently He heares, Moisting, among, His Viands with His teares. And to lend fulnesse lastly to His Fate, Great Summes I gave Him, and what was His due, Made knowne, my Selfe became His Advocate, And at my Charge His Creditors I sue, Recovering Him unto His former State: Thus He the World began by Me anew, That shall to all Posteritie expresse His honour'd Bountie, and My Thankfulnesse. But Muse recount, before thou further passe, How this great change so quickly came about, And what the cause of this sad downfall was, In every part the spacious Realme throughout, Being effected in so little space, Leave not thereof Posteritie to doubt, That to the World obscured else may bee, If in this place revealed not by Thee. If the whole Land did on the Church relie, Having full Power Kings to account to call, That to the World red only Policie, Besides Heavens Keyes to stop or let in all, Let Me but know from Her Supremacie, How She should come so suddenly to fall: 'Twas more then Chance sure put a hand thereto, That had the power so great a thing to doe. Or ought there were had biding under Sunne, Who would have thought those Edifices great, Which first Religion holily begunne, The Church approv'd, and Wisdome richly seat, Devotion nourish'd, Faith allowance wonne, With what might make them any way compleat, Should in their Ruines lastly buryed lye, But that begunne and ended from the Skye? And the King late obedient to Her Lawes, King Henry the Eight writ a Booke against Martin Luther. Against the Clerke of Germanie had writ, As He that first stirr'd in the Churches cause, Against Him greatliest that oppugned it, And wanne from Her so gratefull an applause, Then in Her Favour chiefly that did sit, That as the prop, whereon She only stay'th, Him She instil'd Defender Of The Faith. But not their Power, whose Wisdomes them did place, In the first ranke, the Oracles of State, Who that opinion strongly did imbrace, Which through the Land received was of late, Then ought at all prevailed in this Case; O powerfull Doome of unavoyded Fate, Whose depth not weake Mortalitie can know! “Who can uphold what Heaven will overthrow? When time now universally did show The power to it peculiarly annex'd, With most abundance then when She did flow, Yet every houre still prosp'rously She wex'd, But the World poore did by loose Riots grow, Which served as an excellent pretext, And colour gave to plucke Her from Her Pride, Whose only Greatnesse suffred none beside. Likewise to that, Posteritie did doubt, Those at the first not rightly to adore, Their Fathers that too credulous devout, Had to the Church contributed their store, And to recover only went about, What their great Zeale had lavished before, On Her a strong hand violently laid, Preying on that, they gave for to be pray'd. Besides, the King set in a course so right, Which I for Him laboriously had tract, (Who till I learn'd Him, had not knowne His Might) I still to prompt His Power with Me to act, Into those Secrets got so deepe a sight, That nothing lastly to His Furth'rance lackt, And by Example it to Him was showne, How Rome might here be easly overthrowne. In taking downe yet of this goodly Frame, He suddenly not brake off every band, But tooke the Power first from the Papall Name, After awhile let the Religion stand, When limbe by limbe He daily did it lame, First, tooke a Legge, and after tooke a Hand, Till the poore semblance of a Bodie left, But all should stay it, utterly bereft. State Policie overwrought the Church Government.For if some Abbey hapned void to fall, By death of Him that the Superiour was, Gaine, that did first Church-libertie enthrall, Only Supreme, promoted to the Place, 'Mongst many bad, the worst most times of all, Under the colour of some others Grace, That by the Slander, which from Him should spring, Into contempt it more and more might bring. This time from Heaven when by a secret course, Dissension universally began, (Prevailing as a Planetarie sourse) About this time there were great dissensions in all Religions, almost through the knowne World. I'th'Church beleeving, as Mahumetan, When Luther first did those Opinions nurse, Much from great Rome in little space that wan, It to this change so aptly did dispose, From whose sad Ruine, ours so great arose. When here that fabrique utterly did faile, Which powerfull Fate had limited to Time, By whose strong Law it naturally must quaile, From that proud height to which it long did clime, Letting 'gainst it the contrary prevaile, Therein to punish some notorious Crime, For which at length just dooming Heaven decreed, That on Her Buildings Ruine here should feed. Th'authoritie upon Her Shee did take, The Church discovering her own imperfections, brought Her Authoritie into contempt. And use thereof in every little thing, Finding Her selfe how oft She did forsake, In Her owne bounds Her selfe not limiting, That awfull feare and due Obedience brake, Which Her reputed Holinesse did bring, From slight regard and brought Her into Hate, With those that much dislik'd of Her Estate. Seeing those parts She cunningly had plaid, Beliefe to Her great Miracles to winne, To the wise World were every day bewrai'd, From which the doubt did of Her power begin, Damnation yet to question what She said, Made most suspect the Faith they had beene in, When their Salvation easly might be bought, Found not this yet the way that they had sought. When those ill humours rip'ned to a head, Bred by the ranknesse of the plentious Land, And they not only strangely from her fled, Bound for her ancient Libertie to stand, But what their Fathers gave her being dead, The Sonnes rap'd from her with a violent Hand, And those her Buildings most of all abus'd, That with the waight their Fathers Coffins brus'd. The wisest and most provident but build, For time againe but onely to destroy, The costly Pyles and Monuments we gild, Succeeding Time shall reckon but a toy, Vicissitude impartially will'd, The goodlyest things be subject to annoy, And what one Age did studiously maintayne, The next againe accounteth vile and vaine. Abbey Lands raysed a new Gentrie upon their desolution of the Houses.Yet Time doth tell, in some things they did erre, That put their helpe her braverie to deface, When as the Wealth, that taken was from her, Others soone raysed, that did them displace, Their Titles and their Offices confer On such before, as were obscure and base, Who would with her, they likewise downe should goe, And o'rthrew them that her did overthrow. And th'Romish Rites that with a cleerer sight The wisest thought they justly did reject, They after saw, that the received Light Not altogether free was from defect, Mysterious things being not conceived right, Thereof bred in the ignorant neglect, For, in opinion something short doth fall, Wants there have beene, and shall be still in all. Idlenesse of Religious Men, were the Churches overthrow.But negligent Securitie and Ease Unbridled Sensualitie begat, That only sought his appetite to please, As it in midst of much abundance sat, The Church not willing others should her praise, That shee was leane, when as her Lands were fat, Her selfe to too much libertie did give, Which some perceiv'd that in those times did live. The vision of Pierce Plowman. Pierce the wise Plowman, in his vision saw Conscience sore hurt, yet sorer was afraid The seven great Sinnes to Hell him like to draw, And to wise Clergie mainly cry'd for aide; Falne ere he wist (whom perill much did awe) On uncleane Priests whil'st faintly he him staid, Willing good Clergie t'ease his wretched case, Whom these strong Gyants hotly had in chase. Clergie call'd Fryers, which neere at hand did dwell, And them requests to take in hand the cure, But for their Leechcraft that they could not well, He listed not their dressing to endure, When in his eare Need softly him did tell (And of his knowledge more did him assure) They came for gayne, their end which they did make, For which on them the charge of Soules they take. And voluntarie Povertie profest, By food of Angels seeming as to live; But yet with them th'accounted were the best, That most to their Fraternitie did give, And beyond number that they were increast: If so (quoth Conscience) thee may I beleeve, Then 'tis in vaine more on them to bestow, If beyond number like they be to grow. The Frier soone feeling Conscience had him found, And hearing how Hypocrisie did thrive, That many Teachers every-where did wound, For which Contrition miserably did grieve: Now in deceit to shew himselfe profound, His former hopes yet lastly to revive, Gets the Popes Letters, whereof he doth shape Him a disguise, from Conscience to escape. And so towards goodly Unitie he goes, A strong-built Castle standing very hie, Where Conscience liv'd, to keepe him from his Foes, Whom, lest some watchfull Centinell should spie, And him should to the Garrison disclose, His Cowle about him carefully doth tie, Creepes to the Gate, and closely thereat beat, As one that entrance gladly would intreat. Peace, the good Porter, readie still at hand It doth un-pin, and prayes him God to save, And after salving kindly doth demand What was his will, or who he there would have? The Frier low lowting, crossing with his Hand, T'speake with Contrition (quoth he) I would crave. Father (quoth Peace) your comming is in vaine, For, him of late, Hypocrisie hath slaine. God shield (quoth he) and turning up the eyes, To former health I hope him to restore, For in my skill his sound recoverie lyes, Doubt not thereof if setting God before. Are you a Surgeon, Peace againe replyes? Yea (quoth the Frier) and sent to heale his sore: Come neere (quoth Peace) and God your comming speed, Never of helpe Contrition had more need. And for more haste he haleth in the Frier, And his Lord Conscience quickly of him told, Who entertayn'd him with right friendly cheere: O Sir (quoth he) intreat you that I could To lend your hand unto my deare Cousin here, Contrition, whom a sore disease doth hold, That wounded by Hypocrisie of late, Now lyeth in most desperate estate. Sir (quoth the Frier) I hope him soone to cure, Which to your comfort quickly you shall see, Will he awhile my dressing but endure; And to Contrition therewith commeth hee, And by faire speech himselfe of him assure, But first of all going thorow for his Fee: Which done (quoth he) if outwardly you show Sound, 't not availes if inwardly or no. But secretly assoyling of his sin, No other med'cine will he to him lay, Saying that Heaven his silver him should win, And to give Friers, was better then to pray, So he were shriev'd, what need he care a pin? Thus with his Patient he so long did play, Untill Contrition had forgot to weepe: This the wise Plowman shew'd me from his sleepe. He saw their faults that loosely lived then, Others againe our weaknesses shall see: For this is sure he bideth not with men, That shall know all to be, what they should bee: Yet let the faithfull and industrious Pen Have the due Merit; but returne to mee, Whose fall this while blinde Fortune did devise, To be as strange as strangely I did rise. Those secret Foes yet subt'ly to deceive, That me maligning, lifted at my State, The King to marry forward still I heave, (His former Wife being repudiate) With Anne, the Sister of the Duke of Cleave, The German Princes to confederate, To backe me still 'gainst those against me lay, Which as their owne retayn'd me here in pay. Which my destruction principally wrought, When afterward abandoning her bed, Which to his will to passe could not be brought, So long as yet I bare about my head, The only Man her safetie that had sought, Of her againe and only favoured, Which was the cause he hasted to my end, Upon whose fall Hers likewise did depend. For in his high distemp'rature of blood, King Henrie the eight his Tyrannie. Who was so Great, whose Life he did regard? Or what was it that his desires withstood, He not invested, were it ne'r so hard? Nor held he me so absolutely good, That though I crost him, I could not be spar'd, But with those things I lastly was to goe, Which he to ground did violently throw. When Winchester, with all those Enemies, Stephen Gardiner Bishop of Winchester. Whom my much power from Audience had debarr'd, The longer time their mischiefes to devise, Feeling with me how lastly now it far'd, When I had done the King what did suffice, Lastly thrust in against me to be heard, When what was ill, contrarily turn'd good, Making amayne to th'sheading of my blood. And that the King his action doth deny, And on my guilt doth altogether lay, Having his Ryot satisfied thereby, Seemes not to know how I therein did sway, What late was Truth, now turn'd to Heresie: When he by me had purchased his prey, Himselfe to cleere, and satisfie the sin, Leaves me but late his instrument therein. Cromwell overthrowne by the Lawes that he caused to be made.Those Lawes I made my selfe alone to please, To give me power more freely to my Will, Even to my Equals hurtfull sundrie wayes, (Forced to things that most doe say were ill) Upon me now as violently seyze, By which I lastly perisht by my Skill, On mine owne Necke returning (as my due) That heavie Yoke wherein by me they drew. My Greatnesse threatned by ill-boding eyes, My actions strangely censured of all, Yet in my way, my giddinesse not sees The Pit wherein I likely was to fall: O were the sweets of mans felicities Often amongst not temp'red with some Gall! He would forget by his o'rweening skill, Just Heaven above doth censure good and ill. Things over ranke, doe never kindly beare, As in the Corne, the Fluxure when we see Fills but the Straw, when it should feede the Eare, Rotting that time, in ripening it should bee, And being once downe, it selfe can never reare: With us well doth this Simile agree, (By the Wise man) due to the Great in all, By their owne weight being broken in their fall. Selfe-loving Man what sooner doth abuse, And more then his prosperitie doth wound? Into the deepe but fall, how can he chuse That over-strides whereon his foote to ground? Who sparingly prosperitie doth use, And to himselfe doth after-ill propound, Unto his height who happily doth clime, Sits above Fortune, and controlleth Time. Not choosing what us most delight doth bring, And most that by the generall breath is freed, Wooing that Suffrage, but the vertuous Thing, Which in it selfe is excellent indeed, Of which the depth and perfect managing Amongst the most, but few there be that heed, Affecting that agreeing with their blood, Seldome enduring, and as seldome good. But whil'st we strive too suddenly to rise By flatt'ring Princes with a servill tong, And being Soothers to their tyrannies, Worke our much woes by what doth many wrong, And unto others tending injuries, Unto our selves it hapning oft among. In our owne Snares unluckily are caught, Whil'st our attempts fall instantly to naught. The Councell Chamber place of my Arrest, Where chiefe I was, when greatest was the store, And had my speeches noted of the best, That did them as high Oracles adore: A Parliament was lastly my Enquest, That was my selfe a Parliament before, The Towre-Hill Scaffold last I did ascend: Thus the great'st Man of England made his end. FINIS. THE OWLE. BY Michael Drayton, ESQVIRE. Noctuas Athenas. TO THE HONOURABLE KNIGHT, SIR WALTER ASTON. For the shrill Trumpet, and sterne Tragick sounds, Objects out-ragious and so full of feare; Our Pen late steep'd in English Barons wounds, Sent War-like accents to your tunefull Eare. Our active Muse, to gentler Morals dight; Her slight conceits, in humbled tunes doth sing; And with the Bird, regardlesse of the light, Slowly doth move her late high-mounting wing. The Wreathe is Ivie that ingirts our browes, Wherein this Nights-Bird harb'reth all the day: We dare not look at other crowning Boughes, But leave the Lawrell unto them that may. Low as the earth, though our Invention move: High yet as Heaven, to you, our spotlesse love. M. Drayton. THE OWLE. What time the Sunne by his all-quickning Power, Gives Life and Birth to every Plant and Flowre, The strength and fervour of whose pregnant ray, Buds every branch, and blossomes every spray; As the frim sap (the yeerely course assignde) From the full root, doth swell the plenteous rynde: The vitall spirits long nourisht at the heart, Flie with fresh fire to each exterior part: Which stirres Desire in hot and youthfull blouds; To breathe their deare thoughts to the listing Woods. With those light Flockes, which the faire Fields frequent, This frollike Season luckily I went, And as the rest did, did I frankly too, “Least is he mark'd, that doth as most men doe. But whether by some casuall defect, All Flowres alike the time did not respect: Some whose new roots ne'r saw a former May, Flourish now faire, those withered quite away. Into my thoughts that incidently brings Th'inconstant passage of all wordly things. The rarest worke whereat we wonder long, Obscur'd by Time that Envie could not wrong. And what in life can mortall man desire, That scarsly com'n, but quickly doth retire? The Monarchies had time to grow to head, And at the height their conquered Honours fled: And by their wane those latter Kingdomes rose, That had their age to winne, their houre to lose, Which with much sorrow brought into my minde, Their wretched soules so ignorantly blinde, (When even the great'st things in the World unstable) That clime to fall, and damne them for a Bable. Whilst thus my thoughts were strongly entertain'd, The greatest Lampe of Heaven his height had gain'd; Seeking some shade to lend content to me, Lo, neere at hand, I spy'd a goodly Tree; Under th'extensure of whose Lordly Armes, The small Birds warbled their harmonious Charmes. Where sitting downe to coole the burning heat, Through the moist Pores evap'rating by sweate, Yeelding my pleas'd thought to content (by chance) I on a suddaine dropt into a trance: Wherein me thought some God or Power Divine Did my cleere knowledge wondrously refine. For that amongst those sundry varying Notes, Which the Birds sent from their melodious throats, Each Sylvan sound I truly understood, Become a perfect Linguist of the Wood: Their flight, their song, and every other signe, By which the World did anciently divine, As the old Tuskans, in that skill profound, Divination by Birds. Which first great Car, and wise Tyresias found, To me bequeath'd their knowledge to descry, The depth and secrets of their Augurie. One I could heare appointing with his Sweeting, A place convenient for their secret meeting: Others, when Winter shortly should decline, How they would couple at Saint Valentine: The time when Birds couple. Some other Birds that of their Loves forsaken, To the close Desarts had themselves betaken, And in the darke Groves where they made aboad, Sang many a sad and mournfull Palinod. And every Bird shew'd in his proper kind, What Vertue, Nature had to him assign'd. The prettie Turtle, and the kissing Dove, Their faiths in Wedlock, and chaste Nuptiall Love: The Hens (to Women) Sanctitie expresse, Hallowing their Egges: the Swallow cleanlinesse, Sweeting her Nest, and purging it of Doung And every houre is picking of her young. The Herne, by soaring shewes tempestuous showres, The Princely Cocke distinguisheth the houres. The Kite, his traine him guiding in the Ayre, Prescribes the Helme, instructing how to stere. The Crane to labour, fearing some rough flaw, With Sand and Gravell burthening his Craw: Noted by Man, which by the same did finde To ballast Ships for steddinesse in winde. And by the forme and order in his flight, To march in Warre, and how to watch by Night. The first of House that ere did groundsell lay, Which then was homely, of rude Lome and Clay, Learn'd of the Martin: Philomel in Spring, Teaching by Art her little one to sing; By whose cleere voice sweet Musike first was found, Before Amphyon ever knew a sound. Covering with Mosse the deads unclosed eye, The little Red-brest teacheth Charitie: So many there in sundry things excell, Time scarce could serve their properties to tell. I cannot judge if it the place should bee, That should present this prettie Dreame to Mee, That neere the Eaves and shelter of a Stacke (Set to support it) at a Beeches backe, In a stubb'd Tree with Ivy over-growne, On whom the Sunne had scarsly ever shone, A broad-fac'd Creature, hanging of the wing, Was set to sleepe whilst every Bird did sing. His drowsie head still leaning on his brest, For all the sweet tunes Philomel exprest: No signe of joy did in his lookes appeare, Or ever mov'd his melancholy cheere. Ascallaphus in Bubonem. Ascallaphus, that brought into my head, In Ovids Changes Metamorphised, Or very like: but him I read aright, Solemne of lookes as he was slow of sight; And to assure me that it was the same; The Birds about him strangely wondring came. Fie, quoth the Lennet, tripping on the Spray; Rowze thee, thou sluggish Bird, this mirthfull May, For shame come forth, and leave thy luskie Nest, And haunt these Forrests bravely as the best. Take thy delight in yonder goodly Tree, Where the sweet Merle, and warbling Mavis bee. Next, quoth the Titmouse, which at hand did sit, Shake off this moodie melancholly fit. See the small brookes as through these Groves they travell, Sporting for joy upon the silver Gravell, Mocke the sweet Notes the neighb'ring Sylvans sing, With the smooth cadence of their murmuring. Each Bee with Honey on her laden thye, From Palme to Palme (as carelesly they flye) Catch the soft wind, and him his course bereaves, To stay and dally with th'inamored leaves. This while the Owle, which well himselfe could beare, That to their short speech lent a listning eare: Begins at length to rowse him in the Beech, And to the rest thus frames his reverend speech: O all you feath'red Quiresters of Nature, The Owles speech to the other Birds. That power which hath distinguish'd every Creature, Gave severall uses unto every one, As severall seeds and things to live upon: Some as the Larke that takes delight to build, Farre from resort, amid the Vastie field; The Pellican in Desarts farre abroad, Her deare-lov'd issue safely doth unload; The Sparrow and the Robinet agen, To live neere to the Mansion place of Men; And nature wisely which hath each thing taught, This place best fitting my content fore-thought, For I presume not of the stately Trees, Yet where foresight lesse threatning danger sees, The tempest thrilling from the troubled Ayre, Strikes not the shrub, the place of my repayre. The Fowlers snares in Ambush are not lay'd, T'intrap my steps, which oft have you betray'd. A silent sleepe my gentle fellow Birds, By day, a calme of sweet content affords; By Night I towre the Heaven, devoy'd of feare, Nor dread the Griphon to surprize me there. And into many a secret place I peepe, And see strange things while you securely sleepe. Wonder not, Birds, although my heavie eyes By Day seeme dimme to see your Vanities. “Happie's that sight the secret'st things can spye, “By seeming purblind to Communitie; “And blest are they that to their owne content, “See that by Night which some by Day repent. Did not mine eyes seeme dimme to others sight, Without suspect they could not see so right. “O silly Creatures, happie is the state, “That weighes not Pittie, nor respecteth Hate: “Better's that place, though homely and obscure, “Where we repose in safetie and secure, Then where great Birds with Lordly tallons seize Not what they ought, but what their fancies please: And by their power prevailing in this sort, To rob the Poore, account it but a sport: Therefore of two, I chose the lesser evill, “Better sit still, then rise to meet the Devill. Thus the poore Owle, unhappily could preach, Some that came neere in compasse of his reach, Taking this Item, with a generall eare (“A guiltie Conscience feeles continuall feare) Soone to their sorrow secretly doe find, “Some that had wink'd, not altogether blind. And finding now which they before had heard, “Wisdome not all, in every garish Bird, Shrewdly suspect, that breviting by night, Under pretence that he was ill of sight, Slily had seene which secretly not kept, Simply they wak'd; he subtilly had slept. The envious Crow, that is so full of spight, The hatefull Buzzard, and the ravenous Kite, Plinie.The greedie Raven, that for death doth call, Spoyling poore Lambes as from their Dams they fall. That picketh out the dying Creatures eye; The theevish Daw, and the dissembling Pye, That onely live upon the poorers spoyle, That feed on Dung-hils of the lothsome foyle: The Wood-pecker, whose hardned beake hath broke, And pierc'd the heart of many a sollid Oke: That where the Kingly Eagle wont to prey, In the calme shade in heat of Summers day: Of thousands of faire Trees there stands not one For him to pearch or set his foot upon. And now they see they safely had him here, T'eschew th'effect of every future feare: Upon the sudden all these murdrous Fowle, Fasten together on the harmelesse Owle, The cruell Kite, because his Clawes were keene, Upon his broad-face wreakes his angry teene. His Weasant next, the ravenous Raven plyes, The Pye and Buzzard tugging at his Eyes. The Crow is digging at his brest amayne; The sharp-nebd Hecco stabbing at his braine, That had the Falcon not by chance beene neere, The naturall love of the Falcon to the Owle. That lov'd the Owle, and held him onely deere, Come to his rescue at the present tyde, Plinie. The honest Owle undoubtedly had dyde. And whilst the gentle Fowle doe yet pursue The Ryot done by this rebellious crue, The lesser Birds that keepe the lower Spring, There-at much grieve with wofull murmuring, Yet wanting power to remedie his wrongs, Who tooke their lives, restrained not their tongues: The Larke, the Lennet, and the gentler sort, Those sweet Musicians, with whose shrill report, The senselesse Woods, and the obdurate Rocke, Have oft beene moov'd: the warbling Throstle Cocke, The Ousell, and the Nightingale among That charmes the Night calme with her powerfull Song, In Phœbus Lawrell that doe take delight, Whom Joves fierce Thunder hath no power to smite. Justice, say they, ah, whether art thou fled? Or this vile World hast thou abandoned? O, why, faire Vertue, wer't thou made in vaine? Freedome is lost, and Libertie is slaine: Whilst some whose power restrayned not their rage, Loudly exclaime upon the envious Age, That Rockes for pittie did resume them eares, The Earth so wet with plentie of their teares. But thus it hapt in heat of all these things, “As Kings rule Realmes, God rules the hearts of Kings. The Princely Eagle, leaving his abode, Was from his Court stolne secretly abroad: And from the covert, closely where he stood, To find how things were censur'd in the Wood; Farre in the Thickets might a chattring heare, To which soone lending an officious eare, With a still flight his easie course doth make Towards where the sound he perfectly doth take. At every stroke (with his Imperiall wings) The gentle Ayre unto his Feathers clings; And through his soft and callow downe doth flow, As loth so soone his presence to forgoe, And being at last arrived at the place, He found the Owle in miserable case, (For whom much sorrow every-where was heard) Sadly bemoan'd of many a helplesse Bird. But when this Princely Joviall Fowle they saw, As now deliv'red from their former awe: Each little Creature lifted up a wing, With Ave Cæsar, to their Soveraigne King. Who seeing the Owle, thus miserably forlorne, Spoyl'd of his Feathers, mangled, scratcht and torne: Will'd him his name and qualitie to shew, How and wherefore he suffred all this woe: Which the Owle hearing, taking heart thereby, Though somewhat daunted with his piercing eye, The Owles speech to the Eagle.(With a deep sigh) My Soveraigne Leige, quoth he, Though now thus poore and wretched as you see, Athens sometime the Muses Nurcerie, The source of Science and Philosophie, Allow'd me freedome in her learned Bowers, Where I was set in the Cecropian Towers. Armed Bellona (Goddesse of the Field) Honor'd my Portraict in her War-like Shield. And for my studie (of all other Fowle) The wise Minerva challenged the Owle: For which, those grave and still-autentique Sages, Which sought for knowledge in those golden Ages, Of whom we hold the Science that we have, For Wisedome, me their Hieroglifique gave. The fruitfull Ceres to great Saturne borne, That first with Sickle cropt the rip'ned Corne, Shee bore the Swarty Acheron, whose birth, Scarcely then perfect, lothing of the earth, And flying all communitie with men, Thrust his blacke head into the Stygian fen; Where the Nymph Orphne in th'infernall Shade, As in his streame she carelesly did wade: The Floud imbracing craftily beguild; By whom soone after shee conceav'd with Child, Of her deare Sonne Ascallaphus, whose Youth Ovid. Metam. Lib. 5. So cherish'd Justice, and respected Truth; As to the Gods he faithfully did tell, The tasted fruit by Proserpine in Hell: Which an offence imagined so foule, Ceres trans-form'd into the harmelesse Owle. To our disgrace, though it be urg'd by some, Our harmelesse kind to Creet doth never come; The Cretians are still Lyers, nor come we thether, For Truth and Falshood cannot live together. But those that spurne at our contented state, With Viperous envie and degenerate hate; Strive to produce us from that Lesbian bed, Where with blind Lust the fleshly Letcher led, On his owne Child, unnaturally did prey, (For that foule fact) transform'd Nyctimene, Ovid. Metam. Lib. 2. But seldome seene unto the publique Eye, The shreeking Litch-Owle that doth never cry, But boding death, and quicke her selfe interres In darkesome Graves and hollow Sepulchers. Thus much, my Soveraigne, whence my Fathers came. Now for the cause of this my present shame, “Few words may serve a mischiefe to unfold, “For, in short Speech long Sorrow may be told. But for my freedome that I us'd of late, To lanch th'infection of a poysoned state, Wherein my free and uncorrupted Tongue, Lightly gave taste of their injurious wrong. The Kyte, the Crow, and all the Birds of prey, That thy Liege people havocke Night and Day; Rushing upon me, with most foule despight, Thus have they drest me in this pityous plight. The Eagle now, a serious Eare that lent To the Religious and Devout intent Of the good Owle, whom too injurious fate Had thus rewarded, doth commiserate The poore distressed Bird, hoping to heare What all the rest through negligence or feare, Smothred in silence, and had buried still, Covering the sore of many a festred ill: Not onely grants him libertie of speech, But further dayning kindly to beseech The vertuous Bird no longer to refraine: Who thus emboldned by his Soveraigne, At length his silence resolutely brake, And thus the Eagles Majestie be-spake. The Owles complaint to the King.Mightie, said he, though my plaine homely words Have not that grace that elegance affords; Truth of it selfe is of sufficient worth, Nor needs it glosse of Arte to set it forth. These hoary Plumes like Mosse upon that Oake, By seeing much, yet suffring more I tooke. Long have I seene the Worlds unconstant change, Joy mooves not me, affliction is not strange. I care not for Contempt, I seeke not Fame, Knowledge I love, and glorie in the same. Th'ambitious Judgement-seate I never sought, Where God is sold for Coyne, the Poore for nought. I am a helplesse Bird, a harmelesse Wretch, Wanting the power that needfull is to teach. Yet care of your great good and generall Weale, Unlocks my Tongue, and with a fervent zeale Breaks through my Lips which otherwise were pent To that severe Grave Samnites document. Pithagor. I know, before my harmelesse Tale be told, The gripple Vulture argues me too bold. The Cormorant (whom spoile cannot suffice) Sticks not to charge and slander me with lyes, The Parrot taxe me to be vainely proud, And all cry shame, the Owle should be allow'd. Which with this Axiome doth them all confute, “When Kings bid speake, what Subject can be mute? The latest Winter that fore-went our Prime, O mightie Prince, upon a certayne Time I got into thy Palace on a Night, There to revive my melancholy Spright, And there (for Darkenesse) wayting all alone, To view (by Night) what Lords by Day looke on, Where I beheld so many Candles light, As they had mock'd the Tapers of the Night. Where, for it grew upon the Time of rest, And many great sinceritie profest, Expecting Prayer should presently proceed, To aske forgivenesse for the Dayes misdeed, There in soft Downe the liquorous Sparrow sat, Pamper'd with meats, full spermatike and fat. His Drugs, his Drinks, and Sirops doth apply, To heate his Blood and quicken Luxury; Which by his billing Female was imbrac'd, Clasping her Wings about his wanton Waste. O God, thought I, what's here by Light within, Where some in Darkenesse should have fear'd to sin? The Cormorant set closely to devise, How he might compasse strange Monopolies. The gawdie Gold-Finch and his Courtly Mate, My Madame Bunting powerfull in the State, Quickly agreed, and but at little sticke, To share a thousand for a Bishopricke, And scramble up some Feathers from the Larke, What though a Pastor and a learned Clarke? Mantuan. Bardocuculatus caput, &amp;c.And for his Reverence, though he weare a Cowle, Yet at his entrance he must pay them Tole. I saw a Buzzard scorning of the Blacke, That but of late did clothe his needy Backe, With Ostridge Feathers had trict up his Crest, As he were bred a Falcon at the least. Thus strouts he daily in his borrowed Plume, And but for shame he boldly durst presume, With Princely Eaglets to compare his sight: Not the proud Iris in her colours dight, Could with this base Kyte equally compare. What Fowle before him stood not humbly bare? No lesse then Lords attending every becke, At his command his Betters brooke his checke. But, O my Liege, the Birds of noble Race Know whence He is, and who affords him grace, And inly grieve to see a servile Mate, Crept up by favour, to out-brave a State. The poore Implumed Birds that by offence, Or some disgrace have lost pre-eminence, Can point and say, This Feather once was mine: Some winke, some would, some grieve, and some repine. Besides all this, I saw a Bird did scowre A Serpents teeth, that daily did devoure Widdowes and Orphanes, yet th'Egyptian Sawes Commend this Bird for clensing Serpents Jawes. Trochylus, Avis, Plini.For the base Trochyle thinketh it no payne, To scowre vile Carion for a savoury gayne. When soone I saw about the Serpents nest, Whil'st this base Slave his nastie Grinders drest, A thousand thousand silly little Birds, Covering the Fields, as doe the Summers Herds; A thousand larger Fowles, that strangely carpe, Did curse the Beake that made his Goomes so sharpe. Yet in this base Bird I might well descry, The prosperous fruit of thriving Policy. Casting mine Eye, and looking through a Glasse, I saw a Gos-Hawke (that in State did passe) That by faire shewes did Mens affections feele, Gold (his Attendant) alwayes at his Heele. Whole Mannors did him reverence as he staid, Whose Name (if written) could possession plead In any Lordship that adjoyned his: Law was his Vassall, He and Purchase kisse. Zeale was his Foole, and Learning was his Jester, Yet Pride his Page, and Gluttony his Taster. A thousand Suiters wayted at his Hand, Some call'd his Honour Patrone of the Land; The sole Commander of the Common-weale, And unto him they humbly all appeale. When in a Closet strangely I beheld, That was adjoyning to a pleasant Field, How every Suiter, when he was retyr'd, Bought out his Peace, or his Promotion hyr'd; Yet what he won with Curses was rewarded, When the poore Birds, for Bribes alone regarded. To th'secret of all secrets when I came, Having mine Eyes glew'd up with griefe and shame: I tell not how the Vulture sate apart, Spending the Blood and Marrow of his Heart, And by all meanes his Faculties t'apply, To taynt the Phœnix by his surquedry, That of her kind had shee beene more then one, (Parent and Infant to her selfe alone) Claudian. de Phœnice. This Heavenly Bird (in touching their defame) Had had her Purple soyled with their shame. And for the Turtle would not be unchaste, Her did they banish to the barren waste. I dare not say how every sort were search'd, Nor dare I tell how Avarice was perch'd Under the Pillow of the gravest Head, (That freedome with the golden World is dead) How Age had cast off a Religious life, Humour of late become Opinions Wife. Counsaile secure, nor compani'd with Care, The Wit that woundeth Zeale, accounted rare. But whither wandreth my high-ravisht Muse? O, pardon Liege, the fierce exclaimes I use; And let my Barque (by gales of your good grace Through these rough Seas) beare Sayle a little space. Scarce had these words found uttrance through my Lips, But there withall a prattling Parrot skips About the private lodging of his Peeres: His Eyes were watchfull, open were his Eares: He had a Tongue for every Language fit, A cheverell Conscience, and a searching Wit, Comming in haste as he had crost the Mayne, And brought some strange intelligence from Spaine: Yet even at mid-night (for the Rogue was poore) I found him knocking at a great Mans doore; And where of course the wise were turn'd away, His errand brook'd no dilatorie stay, But presently conducted (by a Light) Into a Chamber very richly dight, Where sat the Vulture with a dreadfull frowne, Proud and ambitious, gaping for Renowne: His Tallons red with Bloud of murth'red Fowles, His full Eye quickly every way he rowles. Whom when this Parrot stedfastly beheld, His Feathers brisled and his Stomake sweld; And to the Vulture openeth where he sat, (Whose Eares attentive listned still thereat) The state and haviour of each private Man, Laid out for searching Avarice to scan. Where by strict Rule and subtilties in Art, Such traps were set, as not a Man could start. And where th'Offenders maintenance was great, Their working Heads they busily did beat, By some strange Quiddit or some wrested Clause, To find him guiltie of the breach of Lawes, That he this present injurie to shift, To buy his owne, accounts a Princely gift: And for a cloke to their corrupt Decrees, The Vulture with this subtill Bird agrees, That they which thus convicted are apart, Shall be surpriz'd by Policy and Art. Then picke they forth such Theeves as hate the Light, The black-ey'd Bat (the Watch-Man of the Night) That to each private Family can pry, And the least slip can easily descry; And since his Conscience is both loose and large, Is onely set to under-goe this charge; Addrest to drinke of every private Cup, And not a word slips but he takes it up, To minister occasion of discourse, And there withall, some dangerous Theame inforce, To urge a doubtfull speech up to the worst, To broach new Treasons, and disclose them first, Whereby himselfe he cleeres, and un-awares Intraps the Fowle, unskilfull of these Snares. And (against Law) he beares his Lords Protection, As a fit meane, and by the States direction. O worthy Bird, prevent this ill in time, And suffer not this ravenous Bat to climbe, That is occasion of the Bests offence, The Brat of Ryot and of Indigence, The Moth and Canker of the Common-weale, Bred by Corruption to disquiet Zeale. Holla! Thou wandring Infant of my brayne, Whither thus fling'st thou? yet divert thy strayne, Returne we backe unto our former gate, From which a little we digrest of late, And leave this Monster beating of his Head, The honest Owle hath quickly strooke him dead. And forth againe the Parrot let us find, That winning credit so the World doth blind, Under protection of so dread a Hand, Spoyles Families, and ransacketh thy Land. The Pellicane that by his Fathers teaching, Hath with devout zeale follow'd wholesome Preaching, That rent his Bosome, and inforc'd his Tongue, To teach his tender and beloved Young: When now these Fauters of all vile abuse, Have found a stand where they may note his use, How Father-like he gives Affliction Bread, Converting Soules, by blind-fold Error led? The naked Orphane in his bosome wraps, With the poore Widdow doth bewaile her haps; And never reapes his plentious Field so cleane, But leaves his Harvest that the Poore may gleane; Steps in this false Spie, this Promoting Wretch, Closely betrayes him that he gives to each: And for his deeds of Charitie and Grace, Roots up his godly Hospitable Place. The Alcatras.Most like to that sharpe-sighted Alcatras, That beates the Aire above the liquid Glasse: The new-Worlds Bird, that proud Imperious Fowle, Whose dreadfull presence frights the harmelesse Owle: That on the Land not onely works his wish, But on the Ocean kills the flying Fish. Which, since the Owle hath truely done his arrant: O, Princely Eagle, looke unto this Tyrant. But if my words thou wilfully impung, Thy peacefull Empire that hath flourish'd long, Headlong at length shall to confusion run, As was this great Globe ere the World begun, When in an huge heape and unweldy masse, This All was shut and Nature smothered was: And in this Lumpe and Chaos out of Frame, The contraries convers'd and one became, Strictly together th'Elements were clasp'd, And in their rough hands one the other grasp'd: That each did others qualitie deface, Beautie was buried, Light could find no place. But when th'all-seeing Soveraigne did disperse, Each to his place upon the Universe, To his owne Region and his Contrarie, Envy'd his Place, impung'd his Qualitie. Fire, Ayre, Earth, Water, in their Mansion sate, By that great God to them appropriate. All was compos'd within this goodly Roome, A perfect shape this Embrion was become; Which thus dissever'd by their friendly jarres, Contrive the Worlds continuance by their Warres. So in confusion members are inclos'd, To frame a State, if orderly dispos'd: For to the proud malevolent aspect Of angry Saturne that would all direct, The long exiled, but Imperious Jove, When for his Regall Soveraigntie he strove, With God-like state and presence of a King, Calmes Saturnes rage, his fury limiting. But leave we those unto their owne decay, Other occasions hasten us away: Let Princes view what their poore Subjects try; “Blind is that sight, that's with anothers Eye; It is full time that we should get us hence, O mightie Soveraigne, Oceans of offence, Stand here opposed in my passing by, When in a Chamber neere thy Majestie, A jetting Jay accomplished and brave, That well could speake, well could himselfe behave; His Congies Courtly, his demeanour rare, And strangely fashion'd as the Clothes he ware; Which could each Man with complement salute, Hee to the Wood-Cocke fram'd a speciall suite: Who him imbracing like a brainelesse Foole, Desir'd him sit, commanding him a Stoole The jolly Jay thus graced by a Peere, Plucks up his Spirits, and with a formall cheere Breaks therewithall into most strange reports, Of Flemmish newes, surprising Townes and Forts; Of troubles rays'd in France against the King, Spanish Armado's and Embattayling, Protesting Method in Intelligence, To be a thing of mightie Consequence; And pawnes his Soule, he can devise a way, Which put in Act, the Leaguers lose the Day, To frame a Bridge of Bow-string o'r the Rhine, Supplant the Alpes, and lay them smooth and plaine, And that if the great Princes of the North, Will with an Armie Royall set him forth, Before the yeere expir'd that is to come, He will with Burbon new beleaguer Rome. Then of his knowledge in the Cabalist, And what pertayneth to an Exorcist: As of Philacters what their uses bee, Homers Nepenthe how in each degree; Each severall use in practique what it is; How much he wants that doth these secrets misse, And by some little Piller in that place, To give some Window or some Chimney grace, He to proportion presently doth runne, And talkes of the Colossus of the Sunne: Of Columnes the Diameters doth tell, Even from the Base, up to the Capitell. And to the Roofe he something doth allude, And doth demonstrate of the Magnitude. And what is all this from his addle pate, But like a Starling, that is taught to prate? And with a lisping garbe (this most rare man) Speakes French, Dutch, Spanish, and Italian. No Day doth passe, he doth his compasse misse, To send to that Lord, or to visit this, And kissing of his Claw, his Cox-combe bare, Is come to see how their good Graces fare. And presently he to their face reports, Their rare perfections wondred at in Courts; Scratching the Ideot by his itching Eares; Heaven spit downe Vengeance, or dissolve in teares, And send the Ibis to repulse our shame, The Bird Ibis, a destroyer of the Locust, Plinie. To drive these Locusts to whence first they came. Woe to these Slaves whose shape the Devill tooke, To tempt the holy Esay at his Booke. O Morall Mantuan, live thy Verses long, Honour attend thee, and thy reverend Song! Who seekes for truth (say'st thou) must tread the path Of the sweet private life, which envies wrath, Which pois'ned tongues, with vaine affected praise, Cannot by Scorne suppresse, by Flatterie raise. For Adulation, but if search be made His daily Mansion, his most usuall Trade, Is in the Monarchs Court, in Princes Hals, Where godly Zeale he by contempt inthrals. There calls he evill good, the good termes evill, And makes a Saint of an incarnate Devill. These boldly censure, and dare set at nought The noblest wit, the most Heroike thought. This Carion Jay, approching to the Spring, Where the sweet Muses wont to sit and sing, With filthy Ordure so the same defil'd, As they from thence are utterly exil'd. Banisht their issue, from whose Sacred Rage, Flowes the full Glorie of each plenteous Age, Still with the Prophets challenging their parts, The sweet Companions of the Lib'rall Arts. Those rare Promethii, fetching fire from Heaven; To whom the Functions of the Gods are given, Raising fraile dust with their redoubled flame, Mounted with Hymnes upon the wings of Fame; Ordain'd by nature (Truch-men for the great) To fire their Noble hearts with glorious heat. You Sun-bred Ayerie, whose immortall Birth, Beares you aloft beyond the sight of Earth, The Heaven-tuch'd Feathers of whose sprightly wings, Strikes (from above) the Palaces of Kings. By how much neerer you ascend the Skye, Doe lessen still to every mortall Eye; Who in this time contemptfull Greatnesse late Scornd and disgrac'd, which earst renown'd her State. O Bastard Mindes unto this vilenesse brought, To loath the meanes which first your Honours wrought! But who their great Profession can protect, That rob themselves of their owne due respect? For they whose Minds should be exhal'd and hie, As Free and Noble as cleere Poesie, In the slight favour of some Lord to come, Basely doe crouch to his attending Groome. Immortall gift that art not bought with Gold, That thou to Peasants should be basely sold! Hence as I went, I chanc'd to looke aside, And neere at hand I happily espide The Hedge-Sparrow, and her Compeere the Wren, (Which simple people call our Ladies-Hen) Out of the way, i'th'bottome of a Ditch, Which though the place poore, yet the feeding rich, For neere at hand grew the browne Winter-Cherrie, The Hip, the Haw, the Slow, the Bramble-berrie; And as together calmely they were set, (Where oft before I might perceive they met) Quoth the Wren, Gossip, be you rul'd by me, And though Men say, the weaker Sex we be, Whate'r they thinke, yet Gossip, they shall know, That we were made for something else then show. Few things shall passe that now in working are, But you and I therein will have a share: They say, the Robin, roosteth in my Nest, Gossip, 'tis true: to you it is confest, My Cock's a slug, and doth me little ease: He must be quicke, his Female that will please. And of all Birds although I be the least, Yet few with Me in number have increast, I thanke my Friend; but let this secret lurke, And by my Robin, you and I must worke: For when the Eagle shapes him for above, As oft he useth to conferre with Jove, To have his Pineons, in sound perfect plight, When they should fit him for so long a flight, He oyles his Feathers, and with wondrous skill, From the short'st flag, (even) to the longest Quill, Sees that each one be in due order set: When as my fine and nimble Robinet (Whilst each one seemes as busie as a Bee, T'attyre their Soveraigne, and none more then hee,) Watcheth his time, and aptly when he finds, That the small Birds, according to their kinds, Shrinke, when the Eagle doubled strength assumes: As he stands proudly rowzing up his Plumes, Nor never dreames what Treacherie intends, Up by his trayne, the craftie Bird ascends, And in the deepe Downe closely doth him hide: For the great Eagle, betwixt Strength and Pride, His poore small Bodie not so much as feeles; And thus this Bird the King himselfe beguiles, And in this sort transported to the Spheares, His Soveraignes Counsailes, and Joves Secrets heares. And when the wearyed Eagle can no more, Fresh from his backe he into Heaven doth sore; And comming thence, doth all to me relate, And by this meanes we two will rule the State. King, looke to these, that they doe not o'r-heare thee, This craftie Bird I doubt is but too neere thee. And thus even cloy'd with Businesse of the Court, To neighbour Groves inviting my resort, Where I suppos'd the solitarie Owle Might live secure, unseene of any Fowle; Loe, in a Valley peopled thicke with Trees, Where the soft day continuall Evening sees, Where, in the moyst and melancholy shade, The Grasse growes ranke, but yeelds a bitter Blade, I found a poore Crane sitting all alone, That from his brest sent many a throbbing grone; Groveling he lay, that sometime stood upright; Maim'd of his joynts in many a doubtfull fight: His Ashie Coate that bore a glosse so faire, So often kiss'd of the enamoured Ayre; Worne all to Rags, and fretted so with rust, That with his feet he trod it in the dust: And wanting strength to beare him to the Springs, The Spiders wove their Webs even in his wings: And in his traine their filmie netting cast, He eat not Wormes, Wormes eat on him so fast. His wakefull eyes, that in his Foes despight, Had watch'd the walls in many a Winters Night, And never wink'd, nor from their object fled, When Heavens dread thunder rattled o'r his head Now covered over with dimme cloudie kels, And shrunken up into their slimy shels. Poore Bird that striving to bemone thy plight, I cannot doe thy miseries their right; Perceiving well he found me where I stood, And he alone thus poorely in the Wood: To him I stept, desiring him to show The cause of his calamitie and woe. Nights-Bird (quoth he) what mak'st thou in this place, To view my wretched miserable case? Ill Orators are aged men at Armes, That wont to wreake, and not bewaile their harmes: And repetition where there wants reliefe, In less'ning sorrow, but redoubleth griefe. Seven sundrie Battailes serv'd I in the field, Against the Pigmies, in whose battered shield, My prowesse stands apparantly exprest; Besides the skars upon my manly brest: Along the Mid-land Coasts my Troupes I led, And Afrikes Pride with feare astonished; And maym'd I was of this decrepit wing, The Sea from Hellespont to Bosphorus, Thracius.When as the Fowle from the Propontike Spring, Fild all th'Egean with their stemming Ores, And made the Iles even tremble from the shores. I saw when from the Adriatike Seas; The crosse-adoring Fowles to Europ's praise, Before Lepanto, and Moræa fought, Where Heaven by Wind, Earths wonder strangely wrought, Wearie at length, and trusting to my worth, I tooke my flight into the happie North: Where nobly bred, as I was well ally'd, I hop'd to have my fortune there supply'd: But there arriv'd, disgrace was all my gaine, Experience scorn'd of every scurvie Swaine. Other had got, for which I long did serve. Still fed with words, whilst I with wants did starve. Having small meanes, but yet a mightie heart, How ere in Fame, not honor'd for desert, That small I had, I forced was to gage, To cure my wounds, and to sustaine mine Age; Whilst those that scarce did ere behold a foe, Exult and triumph in my over-throw. And seeing in vaine with miserie I strove, Retyr'd me to this solitarie Grove; Where in despaire (even lothing of my breath) I long to dwell in the cold armes of Death. Heere sanke downe in a swound and could no more, And I returne from whence I came before. Where by the way the Countrie Rooke deplor'd, The grip and hunger of his ravenous Lord. The cruell Castrell, which with Devillish Clawes Scratcheth out of the miserable Jawes Of the poore Tenant, to his Ruine bent, Raising new Fines, redoubling ancient Rent; And by th'inclosure of old Common Land, Rackes the deare sweat from his laborious hand, Whilst he that digs for breath out of the stones, Cracks his stiffe Sinewes, and consumes his Bones; Yet forc'd to reape continually with Strife, Snarling Contention feeding on his Life. Yet hoping Fortune bett'red by his Heires, They are content to part with what is theirs; Lab'ring to keepe him in his quiet State, When Envie doth his gath'red Mannors threat: And being favoured of some higher Peere, By whom their Land-Lord keepes them still in feare, They by their Clownish Industrie and Art, Soone to the Court reduce him from the Cart, With their provision and defray his charge, Whilst with his Graine he ballasts many a Barge, And so his gripple Avarice he serve, What recks this ranke Hind, if his Countrie starve? “Hell on the Wealth that's purchased with shame, Gold in the Trunke, and in the Grave Defame: Yet his Clawes blunt, and when he can no more, The needie Rooke is turn'd out of the doore: And lastly doth his wretchednesse bewayle, A Bond-slave to the miserable Jayle. Thus wearied with the sight of worldly Crimes, The wane of Kingdomes, and the change of times; I tooke my selfe, by searching to espy, What sinnes in secret did in Cities lye: For there I deem'd, where Law had chiefest force, Strongly to limit every lewder course, Things turn'd to Nature, and disdain'd Excesse, That plaguie Foe to Humane Happinesse. And as I went (with busie search about) Casting by cunning how to finde them out, I found the Fesant that the Hawke doth feare, Seeking for safetie bred his Ayry there; Yet is accus'd through close informing Hate, By lawlesse lending to offend the State. Who being Rich, and loving Coyne and ease, Still buildeth low, for feare he should displease. Yet the Bald-Buzzard being pointed Judge, To this base, muddie, miserable Drudge: A paire of young ones taketh from his Nest, And leaves this fearefull Recreant the rest, Who gives him thankes his Goodnesse would so doe, That might take th'Ayrie, and the old one too. He lived best, that most liv'd out of sight: I dare not say, the Birds were all upright; For some had golden Beakes, but brazen Clawes, That held the Guildes to minister their Lawes: The Castrell, for possession of his Heire, Is by the Ring-tayle offred wondrous faire, To have a match betwixt their goodly Breed, T'increase their Lands, and raise their happy Seed. But the coy Castrell turnes it to a mocke, And scornes to match in his Ignoble Stocke, For which the Ring-tayle by a secret Plot, Subornes the Starling, which hath closely got, To be the Broker, slily to seduce The Castrels Heire, by giving thriftlesse use, And in strong Statutes to inthrall him so, To lime him sure which way so e'r he goe. For this young Fowle (drawne from his Fathers eye) Will with the fond World swimme in Vanitie, The subtill Ring-tayle never thus doth leave, Till he the Castrell cunningly deceive, And catch his young one in the Cities snare, So gets his Mannors e'r he be aware. 'Mongst which the Daw (by giving of a Bribe) Became a Clerke amongst the learned Tribe; That being a Bankrout, a dishonest Detter, Can get his living onely by the Letter, Whilst Arts goe beg, and in a servile Weed, Are made the Slaves to Penurie and Need. The Goose exiled, humbly doth appeale To all the Birds, professing Faith and Zeale. And though he proveth by the Romane Booke, Plutarch. What care to keepe the Capitoll he tooke; Yet is not heard: The Dove without a Gall, Columba sine felle. Is left forsaken, and contemn'd of all. There growes such diffrence and such strange Confusions, Twixt old Decrees, and later Institutions: Yet being inspir'd, desisteth not to speake, To edifie the conscience that is weake, And by approoved Arguments of's owne, By Scriptures, Fathers, and great Writers knowne, Discovereth their abominable Trade; So that the Storke their umpire being made, Judgeth, the Daw should from the Church be driven, To prate in Corners, and to preach by Even. And since his Art and Cunning was so scant, To have no Patron but the Ignorant; And by his Doctrine onely teaching Fooles, To be exilde, and hiss'd out of the Schooles. Hence like the seed Thebes-builder Cadmus threw, More armed Mischiefes suddenly up grew: The Bitter brings his Action 'gainst the Quaile, And on th'arrest allowes him hardly Baile; Because he durst presume amongst the Reeds, To leave his Lemmon, where his Female breeds. And Mistris Titmouse a neate merrie Dame, With her Friend Wag-tayle, one of speciall name, Were su'd by th'Cuckow, in his proper wrong, For him accusing with their sland'rous tongue, Who to the Barre his Advocate doth bring, That hath by rote the Acts of many a King. The Lawes, the Statutes, and Decrees assignde, Custome so old, as almost out of Minde. A Day of hearing, good my Lord, cries he, For Master Cuckow that retayneth me; Whom the lewd Wag-tayle basely hath abus'd In so vile termes, as cannot be excus'd: The parties likewise present here in Court, And 'tis is a Case that well deserves report: For which a Jurie's summoned with speed, And to the triall presently proceed. The Brain-bald Coot a formall witlesse Asse, Must now, the Fore-man on this matter passe: The Sottish Dott'rill, ignorant and dull; And next to him the Maw-cram'd gluttonous Gull. The Lecherous Mallard, call'd unto the Booke, The squealing Lapwing, the ridiculous Rooke, The witlesse Wood-cocke, and his Neighbour Snite, That will be hyr'd to passe on every Rite, With all the rest empannelled to waite: Which when the Jurie lastly was complete, Call'd to the Barre, admitted and allow'd: Upstart the Peacocke, insolent and proud; Of goodly stature and of gracious port, In presence of the Honourable Court: And for the Plaintiffe learnedly began. My Lord (saith he) was never worthy man, So nobly bred, and of so high descent, Of so faire lively-hood, and so large a rent, As is the Cuckow, so abus'd hereby, Nor yet so sland'red, as my Plea shall try: First, for the worth and honour of his Name, That you may better censure his defame; From mightie Birds descended every way, And by his Birth, the Messenger to May; His House still loyall, and his Coat as faire, His Fathers Tunes he never did impaire. His name and nature doe so well agree, As shews his Bloud repurifide to bee. In fruitfull Sparta, it is since now long, That famous Greece tooke notice of his wrong, When for her wanton and unchaste desire, A thousand Ships stuft with revengefull fire, To Tenedos the proud Ægean lades, Whence sprang those high immortall Illiades. And since the Romans from the Asian Broyles, Return'd with Conquest and victorious Spoyles, The Cuci heere continually have beene, As by their ancient Evidence is seene, Of Consull Cuccus, from whose mighty Name, These living Cuccos lineally came. To him, the Ancients, Temples did erect, Which with great Pompe and Ornament were deckt. Th'Italians call him Becco (of a Nod) With all the Reverence that belongs a God. What though in love supposed to be us'd, What is his Vertue need not be excus'd? The Wiseman tels (if Nature be our Guide) In following her, we seldome slip aside. And in this Bird who can her power denie, If Nature fram'd him to Communitie? Then wisely thus considering his Profession, You Reverend Judges of this lawfull Session: As you are Patrones of the righteous cause, Vouchsafe my Clyent Judgement. Heere doth pause. Scarce could the Peacocke his conclusion make, When straight his turne the Turkie-cocke doth take, A learned Lawyer (worthy of his Gowne) Of reputation both in Court and Towne: And to the Bench for Audience having cry'd, Thus to the Peacocke learnedly reply'd: Grave Reverend Fathers of the Law (he said) The matter that our Adversaries plead, Is vaine and idle; we the point inforce Against the Cuckow and his lawlesse course. The Peacocke here a cunning speech hath made, To helpe his Clyent and uphold his Trade; But strip this Maske that doth conceale the Cause, Examine each particular and Clause 'Gainst proofe so poore, so indigent to Truth, The Bastard Cuckow bringing from his Youth: First laid and hatch'd up in anothers Nest, Such vilenesse raign'd in his base Parents brest, Who since that time they never sought for shame, Nor but their Vice he dares for's Birth-right clayme: The Hedge-Sparrow, this wicked Bird that bred, That him so long and diligently fed, (By her kind tendance) getting strength and power, His carefull Nurse doth cruelly devoure: Base as his Birth, so baser is his Trade, And to the World a By-word now is made: No Nation names the Cuckow but in scorne, And no Man heares him, but he feares the Horne: No Month regards him but lascivious May, Wherein whil'st Youth is dallying with the Day; His Song still tends to Vanitie and Lust, Amorous deceits, Poligamies unjust. But to cut off these tedious Allegations, The Law commands, these publike defamations Be straightly punish'd in the Noblest Men. Why should you spare the cursed Cuckow then? Who all his Life to lewdnesse being bent, Rightly deserves the publik'st punishment? Then, gentle Jurors, good Men, and Elect, As you your safeties carefully respect, If Loves sweet Musike and his blissefull cheere, E'r touch'd your Hearts, or mollifi'd your Eare; Tender the case, and evermore the wed Shall prayse your Conscience both at Boord and Bed. Thus said, he ceas'd, the Jurors stept aside, Wisely consulting, warily they tride The circumstance of every secret Sin; Thus they return'd and brought their Verdict in: Cast is the Cuckow, guilty of the Deed, And for a Fine, for his deserved meed, Allowes to Mistris Titmouse for her Charge, That shee shall after have her Tayle at large: And when shee Revells, as shee did before, T'exclude the Cuckow freely out of Dore: And such Offenders as they could present, Likewise adjudg'd deserved punishment. The Ring-Dove, plagu'd with Maggots in the Maw, The Woodcocke gets the swelling of the Craw. The Crow, with dropsie (whil'st yet living) rots: The Quaile, a Leaper fill'd with lothsome Spots. The Buzzard, of the Lethargie is sicke, The Kyte, with Fevers falleth Lunaticke. The Epilepsy grew upon the Jay, And of a sweat the Bunting drops away. But how about my fantasie it brought; Now know not I: but suddenly me thought, The Princely Eagle out of sight was gone, And left the wise and honest Bird alone, To governe things, both for his proper heale, And for the great good of the publique Weale. When more the Owle that with a vigilant Eye, All these Demensions perfectly could try, Fore-saw the perill threatned unto all, Apt by their loose credulitie to fall, And whose prevention if he did fore-slow, Their utter spoyle immediately should grow. My Friends (quoth he) looke warily about, Many the dangers which you are to doubt; This gallant Oke wherein so oft you play, Perhaps (at length) your safetie may betray. And though his shade be delicate and sweet, His Trunke beares Lyme that may intrap your Feet. If, fearing what is requisite and fit, You like my Judgement, and allow my Wit; Yours is the good: but if you fondly deeme, Things be within, as outwardly they seeme; Head-long runne on, and fall into the Snare, And say, A Friend once warn'd you to beware. Thus spake the Owle, whose talke could not be heard. “So little, Fooles good counsell doe regard. But thinking, Frensie him his Wits beguilde, The honest Bird despightfully revilde. But marke their end, who set advice at nought, “Fooles still too deare have sound Experience bought; The Husband-man surveying of his Ground, 'Mongst all the Trees this Oke had quickly found: And by all signes and likelyhood of Trade, The Birds therein their nightly roosting made. And by the Lyme that issued from the Tree, They all intangled easily might bee. Taking the same, he spreads it on the sprayes, And through the Thicket closely creeps his wayes. When the sad Arndern shutting in the Light, Wan-sighted Cynthia (Lady of the Night) Proudly ascending the Ætheriall State, Whence the bright Phœbus but dismounted late, The dull-ey'd Evening his moist Vapours threw, Strewing the still Earth with sweet showres of Dew; When every Bird replenished with Food, Came on his stretch't Wings lively from the Wood, And on each small Branch of this large-limb'd Oke, Their pretty Lodgings carelesly they tooke, No ill suspecting, fondly unawares, Were all intangled in the Fowlers Snares. Whose mournefull Chirping, and their Chattering cryes, Incites the Owle before his houre to rise. And hearing from his melancholy Seate, The Birds themselves thus wofully to beate, (The Deed discovered with the Mornings Light) Flew from his Pearch: though grieved at the sight, Yet with a Smile, his Wisedome that became, Which mock'd their folly, though bemoan'd their shame, Quoth he, you foolish Burgers of the Field, That in contempt my counsailes lewdly held, That, whereat late you did but laugh and jeere, Now to your ruine plainly doth appeere, The greatest thing you lightly are to lose, Onely your Plumes that Fortune can dispose. “'Tis yet a comfort in the depth of smart; “Envy but seyzeth on the outward part. “But present perill in a thing of price, “Rather craves Action, then doth stay Advice. Therefore to helpe you, Ile my power assay: Wherewith his Wing doth presently display, And with his Clawes, the Birds of every kind Plucks from the Lime, which left their Plumes behind. The little Robin Featherlesse and free, Regreets the Owle with many a Cap and Knee. The warbling Mavis mirthfull Peans sung, The Nightingale with her melodious Tongue, Gave him such Musike (to declare their thanks) That Springs and Rivers danc'd above their Banks: That (with the repercussion of the Aire) Shooke the great Eagle sitting in his Chaire: Which from the Mountayne (with a Radiant Eye) Brav'd the bright Cressit of the Glorious Skie; Mooving his Princely Majestie to see, Whence this applause so suddenly should bee, Whose sinewed Wings (in their resistlesse course) Beat the thin Ayre, with such a violent force, That the light Birds dropt head-long from the Skyes, The Rocks and Forrests trembling with the noyse, Somewhat amaz'd at this un-usuall sight, To see his People in this pitious plight: His Soveraignes Eare doth presently addresse, Willing to heare the Cause of their distresse: To whom the poore Owle (his Obedience done) Thus to his Liege Lord, reverently begun: Monarch of all that beate the Ayre with Wings, Thou Bird of Jove, beloved amongst Kings: Here stands an Oke well timbred, largely spred, That many a day hath borne his curled Head, Above his Fellowes dwelling farre and neere, That in the Forrest never found his Peere; Whose Roote well fastned in the fruitfull Ground, His Barke so lovely and his Heart so sound, (Through his great Wealth) grew insolent and proud, Because the Birds that in his Boughs did shrowd, To his high prayse continually did sing, And kept their Vigils to th'enamoured Spring. The Virgin-Huntresse sworne to Dian's Bow, Here in this shade her Quarries did bestow, And for their Nymphals, building amorous Bowers, Oft drest this Tree with Anadems of flowers; And Flora chose her Nurcery here to shield, Her tender Buds the Infants of the Field. By which, this Tree grew arrogant in time, And in his ranke Sap bred a lothsome Slime, Whose Nature and vile Qualitie is such, Strongly to hold what ever it doth tuch; And not content to minister this meane, Which in short time might have undone us cleane; But even his Boughs the Birds have honoured so, He hath imploy'd unto their generall wo, That when thy Subjects dreading no deceit, Came to this Tree, as to their safe retreit, They were betray'd, and he that sped the best, Hardly escap't, with Feathers at the least. Those that I could, as I had power and might, Though with much payne, I lastly did acquight. The rest, whose freedome doth exceed my reach, O King of Birds, I humbly thee beseech In mercy, let thy mightinesse purvay, To ransome from this eminent Decay. When now the Eagle cutting off his Tale, And even for sorrow waxing wan and pale; At which sad sight, this poore Implumed crue, Stand faintly trembling in their Soveraignes view; And having stretcht his Lordly tallon forth, To shew th'acceptance of this deed of worth; You silly Birds, you wretched Fowles (quoth he) Henceforth let this a friendly warning be. Had you (as Nature and our Lawes admit) Built where your Noble Ancestors did sit, Wisely providing to maintayne their State, Whose Names and Freedomes you participate, You had not thus beene spoyled of your Goods, For, Subtiltie now dwelleth in the Woods. For if too high and haughtily you soare, Those see your falls that hover neere the Shore. If in the Cedar you your Nests dispose, The dreadfull Lightning ever threatneth those. If in the low Earth (in the flattering Shade) The Fowlers Snares there secretly are laid. Then, my deare Subjects, as you wish my good, Or have respect to your succeeding brood, Let your wise Fathers an example give, And by their Rules learne thriftily to live. Let those weake Birds, that want wherewith to fight, Submit to those that are of grip and might. Let those of power, the weaker still protect, So none shall neede his safety to suspect; Suppressing those enormities that are, Whose cure belongs unto our Soveraigne care. For when wealth growes into a few Mens hands, And to the Great, the poore in many Bands; The pride in Court doth make the Country leane, The abject rich hold ancient Honour meane. Mens wits employ'd to base and servile shifts, And Lay-men taught, by learn'd Mens subtill drifts, Ill with this State 't must incidently fare. For even as from th'infection of the Ayre, Sundry contagious sicknesses proceed, These mischiefes more continually doe breed. Shun beastly Lust (you young well-feathered Fowle) That wounds the Body, and confounds the Soule; That as the subtill'st of the Syrens brood, Binds all the Spirits, and over-comes the blood; Darkning the purenesse of the inward Light, Weakneth the Sense and murd'reth Reason quite. And you that sit as Judges of the Law, Let not vile Gayne your equall Ballance draw. O! still retayne the Ethiopians guise, (As Just and Upright, as Select and Wise) That in their Judgements (sacred and profound) Dispos'd them ever meekely on the ground; To shew the Angels (sitting over Head) Them were to judge, as they had censured. Thus spake the Eagle, when with mutt'ring noyse, The rest attentive to his powerfull voyce, Giving a Signall of their admiration, The Owle this while in serious Contemplation Softly replyes, O mightie Soveraigne! With all the Synod of thy winged Traine, Th'abundant Joyes that in my Heart doe throng, Require more Organs then the onely Tongue. O blessed Birds! how sweet is your subjection, Under the safe and absolute protection? Of so exact and excellent a King, So sole and perfect in his governing: The reason this (my grave selected Peeres) Because 'tis knowne, that in these latter Yeeres, The peacefull State prepost'rously disturb'd, By such, whose power the Great have hardly curb'd. The jocund Throstle, for his varying Note, Clad by the Eagle in a speckled Cote; Because his voyce had Judgement for the Palme, Suppos'd himselfe sole Patrone of our Calme. All say, for singing he had never Peere: But there were some that did his Vertue feare. Why should'st thou then ambitiously despise The manly Falcon? on whose courage lyes The Kingdomes safetie, which abroad doth roame, By forraigne Warres to keepe us safe at Home. I know, the strayne of an alluring Tongue Can tye the full Eare, and detayne it long, But other fortunes, and the altred place, Crave new directions, and an active grace. The former Vertue may consist alone, But better two (if firmely joyn'd in one) Experience once (by service in the Warres) Did quote his strong Authorities in scarres; But in this latter Time, it hath beene said, The Tongue doth all, contemning th'others aid. Vertue, whose chiefe prayse in the Act doth stand, Could wish the Tongue still coupled with the Hand. But in the Cocke which death untimely wrackt, In him was both the Elegance and Act. O! when that Bird was ravish'd from our sight, (Intombing him) the World intomb'd Delight. Let never mournefull Accent passe my Pen, That leaves his Fame un-registred to Men. The Muses vailed with sad Cypres Tree, Upon his Grave, shall powre their Teares with mee. O! if the World can weepe so many Teares As his losse craves, or if in Heaven appeares More plentious Sorrow; let them both agree, T'lament that houre that reft the Earth of thee. O! thought I not some Spirit could give thee more Then this small Portion of my scantled Store! I would not leave (I first would leave to Live) To give thee Fame: O who can greater give? This said, he sunke, as growing faint with speaking, Sighing withall, as though his Heart were breaking. The Princely Eagle pitying of his plight, To cheere the poore Owle doing all he might; The Birds applauding with a free consent, Followed the Eagle (with devout intent) To the great Mountayne, to have all amended: Thus I awak't, and here my Dreame was ended. FINIS. PASTORALS. Contayning EGLOGVES, With the Man in the Moone. BY Michael Drayton, ESQVIRE. TO THE HONOUR OF MY NOBLE PATRONE, SIR WALTER ASTON: As Other My Poems, So I Consecrate These My Pastorall Poesies. M. Drayton. THE FIRST EGLOGUE. Phœbus full out his yeerely course had runne Phœbus full out his yeerely course had runne, (The wofull Winter labouring to out-weare) And though 't was long first, yet at length begunne, To heave himselfe up to our Hemispheare, For which pleas'd Heaven to see this happie houre, O'rcome with Joy wept many a silver showre. When Philomel, the augure of the Spring, Whose Tunes expresse a Brothers trayt'rous Fact, Whilst the fresh Groves with her complaints doe ring, To Cinthia her sad Tragedie doth act. The jocund Mirle perch'd on the highest spray, Sings his love forth, to see the pleasant May. The crawling Snake against the morning Sunne, Like Iris shewes his sundrie coloured Coat, The gloomie shades and enviously doth shunne, Ravish'd to heare the warbling Birds to roat, The Bucke forsakes the Lawn's where he hath fed, Fearing the Hunt should view his Velvet head. Through ev'ry part dispersed is the bloud, The lustie Spring in fulnesse of her Pride: Man, Bird, and Beast, each Tree, and every Floud, Highly rejoycing in this goodly tyde: Save Rowland, leaning on a A tree with age beginning to decay at the top. Ranpike Tree, Wasted with age, forlorne with wo was he. Great God, quoth he, (with hands rear'd to the Skye) Thou wise Creatour of the Starrie light, Whose wondrous workes thy Essence doe imply, In the dividing of the Day and Night: The Earth releeving with the teeming Spring, Which the late Winter low before did bring. O thou strong Builder of the Firmament, Who placed'st Phœbus in his fiery Carre, And for the Planets wisely didst invent, Their sundry Mansions, that they should not jarre, Appointing Phœbe Mistris of the Night, From Titan's flames to fetch her forked light. From that bright Palace where thou raign'st alone, Whose floore with Stars is gloriously inchased; Before the Footstoole of whose glittering Throne, Those thy high Orders severally are placed, Receive my Vowes, that may thy Court ascend, Where thy cleere presence all the Powers attend. Shepheards great Soveraigne, graciously receive, Those thoughts to thee continually erected, Nor let the World of Comfort me bereave, Whilst I before it sadly lye dejected, Whose sinnes, like fogs that over-cloud the Aire, Darken those beames which promis'd me so faire. My hopes are fruitlesse, and my faith is vaine, And but meere shewes, disposed me to mocke, Such are exalted basely that can faine, And none regards just Rowland of the Rocke. To those fat Pastures, which Flocks healthfull keepe, Malice denyes me entrance with my Sheepe. Yet nill I Nature enviously accuse, Nor blame the Heavens thus haplesse me to make, What they impose, but vainly we refuse, When not our power their punishment can slake. Fortune the World, that towzes to and fro, Fickle to all, is constant in my wo. This only rests, Time shall devoure my sorrow, And to affliction minister reliefe, When as there never shall succeed a morrow, Whose labouring houres shall lengthen out my griefe, Nor in my brest, Care sit againe so deepe: Tyring the sad Night with distemp'red sleepe. And when that Time expired hath the date, What weares out all things, lastly perish must, And that all-searching and impartiall Fate, Shall take account of long-forgotten dust, When every being, silently shall cease, Lock'd in the armes of everlasting Peace. Now in the Ocean, Titan quench'd his flame, That summon'd Cinthia, to set up her light And she the neer'st of the Celestiall frame, Sat the most glorious on the brow of Night. When the poore Swaine, with heavinesse opprest, To the cold Earth sanke sadly downe to rest. THE SECOND EGLOGUE. Might my youth's Mirth, become thy aged yeeres Motto. Might my youth's Mirth, become thy aged yeeres, My gentle Shepheard, Father of us all, Wherewith I wonted to delight my Pheeres, When to their Sports they pleased me to call. Now would I tune my A little Bagpipe. Miskins on this Greene, And frame my Verse, the Vertues to unfold Of that sole Phœnix Bird, my lives sole Queene, Whose Lockes doe staine the three-times burnisht Gold. But melancholy settled in thy spleene, My Rimes seeme harsh to thy unrellish'd taste, Thy Wits that long replenisht have not beene, Wanting kind moysture, do unkindly waste. Winken. Well, Wanton, laugh not my old age to scorne, Nor twit me so, my senses to have lost, The time hath beene, when as my hopefull Morne Promis'd as much as now thy youth can boast. My direfull cares beene drawne upon my face, In crooked lines with Ages Iron Pen, The Morphew quite discoloured the place, Which had the power t'attract the eyes of men. What mock'd the Lilly, beares this Tawny Dye, And this once Crimson, lookes thus deadly pale, Sorrow hath set his foot upon mine Eye, And hath for ever perished my sale. A cumber-World, yet in the World am left, A fruitlesse Plot with Brambles over-growne: Of all those joyes, that pleas'd my Youth, bereft, And now too late my Folly but bemone. Those daintie straines of my well-tuned Reed, Which many a time have pleas'd the curious Eares, In me no more those pleasing thoughts doe breed, But tell the errors of my wandring yeeres. Those poys'ning Pills beene biding at my heart, Those lothsome Drugs unseas'ned Youth did chaw, Not once so sweet, but now they be as tart, Not in the mouth, what they are in the maw. Motto. Even so I weene: for thy old Ages Fever Deemes sweetest Potions, bitter as the Gall, And thy cold Palate, having lost the savour, Receives no comfort by a Cordiall. Winkin. As thou art, once was I a gamesome Boy, Ill-wintred now, and aged as you see, And well I know, thy Swallow-winged joy Quickly shall vanish, as 't is fled from me. When on the arch of thy eclipsed Eyes, Time shall have deeply charactred thy Death, And Sun-burnt Age, thy kindly moysture dryes, Thy wasted lungs be Niggards of thy breath; Thy brawn-falne armes, and thy declining backe, To the sad burthen of thy yeeres shall yeeld, And that thy legs their wonted force shall lacke, Able no more thy wretched Trunke to weeld. Now am I like the knottie aged Oake, Whom wasting Time hath made a Tombe for dust, That of his branches reft by Tempest stroke, His Barke consumes with Canker-wormes and rust. And though thou seem'st like to the bragging Bryer, And spreadst thee like the Morn-lov'd Marigold, Yet shall thy sap be shortly dry and seere, Thy gawdy Blossomes blemished with cold. Even such a Wanton and unruly Swaine, Was little Rowland, when as lately he, Upon the Verge of yonder neighb'ring plaine, Carved this Rime upon a Beechen Tree. Then this great Universe no lesse, Can serve her prayses to expresse: Betwixt her eyes, the Poles of Love, The Host of Heavenly Beauties move, Depainted in their proper Stories, As well the fix'd as wandring Glories, Which from their proper Orbes not goe, Whether they gyre swift or slow: Where from their Lips, when shee doth speake, The Musike of those Spheares doe breake, Which their harmonious Motion breedeth: From whose cheerefull breath proceedeth That Balmy sweetnesse, that gives birth To every off-spring of the Earth: The Structure of whose gen'rall Frame, And state wherein shee mooves the same, Is that Proportion, Heavens best Treasure, Whereby it doth all poyze and measure, So that alone her happy sight Contaynes perfection and delight. Motto. O divine Love, which so aloft can rayse, And lift the Mind out of this earthly Myre, And dost inspire us with so glorious prayse, As with the Heavens doth equall Mans desire: Who doth not helpe to decke thy holy Shrine, With Venus Mirtle and Apollo's Tree? Who will not say that thou art most Divine, At least, confesse a Deitie in thee? Winken. A foolish Boy, full ill is hee repayd: For now the Wanton pynes in endlesse payne, And sore repents what he before misse-said. So may they be, which can so lewdly fayne. Now hath this Yonker torne his tressed Locks, And broke his Pipe which was of sound so sweet, Forsaking his Companions and their Flocks, And casts his Garland loosely at his Feet. And being shrowded in a homely Cote, And full of sorrow (I him sitting by,) He tun'd his Rebecke to a mournefull Note, And thereto sang this dolefull Elegie. Upon a Banke with Roses set about, Where Turtles oft, sit joyning Bill to Bill, And gentle springs steale softly murm'ring out, Washing the Foote of Pleasures sacred Hill: There little Love sore wounded lyes, His Bow and Arrowes broken, Bedew'd with Teares from Venus Eyes, Oh, grievous to be spoken! Beare him my Heart, slaine with her scornefull Eye, Where sticks the Arrow which that Heart did kill, With whose sharpe Pile, request him ere he dye, About the same to write his latest Will, And bid him send it backe to mee, At instant of his dying, That cruell, cruell shee, may see My Faith and her denying. His Chappell be a mournefull Cypres Shade, And for a Chantry Philomel's sweet lay, Where Prayers shall continually be made By Pilgrim Lovers passing by that way, With Nymphs and Shepherds yeerely moane, His timelesse death beweeping, In telling that my Heart alone Hath his last Will in keeping. Motto. Wo's me for him that pyneth so in payne, Alas, poore Rowland, how for him I grieve! That such a baite should breed so foule a bayne, Yet shee not dayne his sorrow to relieve. Winken. Beware by him, thou foolish wanton Swayne, By others harmes thus maist thou learne to heed: Beautie and Wealth beene fraught with high disdayne, The Night drawes on: Come, homeward let us speed. THE THIRD EGLOGUE. Rowland, for shame awake thy drowsie Muse Perkin. Rowland, for shame awake thy drowsie Muse, Time playes the Hunt's-Up to thy sleepy head; Why lyest thou here, whil'st we are ill bestead, Foule idle Swayne? Who ever heard thy Pipe and pleasing vaine, And now doth heare this scurvy Minstralsy, Tending to nought, but beastly Ribauldry That doth not Muse? Then slumber not with dull Endymion, But tune thy Reed to dapper Virelayes, And sing awhile of blessed Beta's prayse, Of none but Shee: Above the rest so happy mayst thou bee, For learned Colin layes his Pipes to gage, And is to Fayrie gone a Pilgrimage, The more our moane. Rowland. What, Beta, Shepheard? shee is Pans belov'd, Faire Beta's prayse beyond our strayne doth stretch, A note too high for my poore Pipe to reach, An Oaten Reed. The most unfit to speake of Worthies deed, Ile set my Song unto a lower Kay, Whereas a Horne-Pipe I may safely play, And un-reproov'd. With flattery my Muse could never fadge, Nor could this vaine scurrility affect, From looser Youth to winne a light respect, Too base and vile. Me that doth make, that I not care the while, My selfe above Tom Piper to advance, Which so bestirs him at the Morrice Dance, For penny wage. Perkin. Rowland, so Toyes esteemed often are, And fashions ever vary with the Time, But since the Season doth require some Rime, With lusty glee, Let me then heare that Roundelay of thee, Which once thou sangst to me in Janeveere, When Robin Red-brest sitting on a Breere, The burthen bare. Rowland. Well, needs I must, yet with a heavy Heart, Yet were not Beta, sure, I would not sing, Whose prayse the Eccho's cease not yet to ring, Up to the Skyes. Perkin. Be blythe, good Rowland then, and cleere thine Eyes. And since good Robin to his Roost is gone, Supply his want, and put two parts in one, To shew thy Arte. Rowland. Stay, Thames, to heare my Song, thou great and famous Flood, Beta alone the Phœnix is of all thy watry Brood, The Queene of Virgins onely Shee, The King of Floods allotting Thee Of all the rest, be joyfull then to see this happy Day, Thy Beta now alone shall be the Subject of my Lay, With daintie and delightsome straynes of dapper Verilayes: Come lovely Shepheards, sit by me, to tell our Beta's prayse, And let us sing so high a Verse, Her soveraigne Vertues to rehearse: That little Birds shall silent sit to heare us Shepheards sing, Whilst Rivers backward bend their course, &amp; flow up to their spring. Range all thy Swans, faire Thames, together on a ranke, And place them each in their degree upon thy winding Banke, And let them set together all, Time keeping with the Waters fall: And crave the tunefull Nightingale to helpe them with her Lay, The Woosell and the Throstle-Cocke, chiefe musike of our May. See what a troupe of Nymphs, come leading Hand in Hand, In such a number that well-neere they take up all the Strand: And harke how merrily they sing, That makes the Neigh'bring Meddowes ring, And Beta comes before alone, clad in a purple Pall, And as the Queene of all the rest doth weare a Coronall. Trim up her golden Tresses with Apollo's sacred Tree, Whose Tutage and especiall care I wish her still to bee, That for his Darling hath prepar'd, A glorious Crowne as her reward, Not such a golden Crowne as haughtie Cæsar weares, But such a glittering starry one as Ariadne beares. Mayds, get the choycest Flowres, a Garland and entwine, Nor Pinks, nor Pansies, let there want, be sure of Eglantine, See that there be store of Lillyes, (Call'd of Shepheards Daffadillyes) With Roses Damaske, White, and Red, the dearest Flower-de-lice, The Cowslip of Jerusalem, and Clove of Paradise. O thou great Eye of Heaven, the Dayes most dearest Light, With thy bright Sister Cynthia, the Glorie of the Night, And those that make yee seven, To us the neer'st of Heaven, And thou, O gorgeous Iris, with all thy Colours dy'd, When shee streames forth her Rayes, then dasht is all your pride. In thee, whilst shee beholds (O Flood) her heavenly Face, The Sea-Gods in their watry Armes would gladly her imbrace, The intising Syrens in their layes, And Tritons doe resound her prayse, Hasting with all the speed they can unto the spacious Sea, And through all Neptunes Court proclaim our Beta's holyday. O evermore refresh the Roote of the fat Olive Tree, In whose sweet shaddow ever may thy Banks preserved bee. With Bayes that Poets doe adorne, And Mirtle of chaste Lovers worne, That faire may be the Fruit, the Boughes preserv'd by peace, And let the mournefull Cypres die, and here for ever cease. Weele strew the Shore with Pearle, where Beta walks alone, And we will pave her Summer Bower with the rich Indian stone, Perfume the Ayre and make it sweet, For such a Goddesse as is meet, For if her Eyes for purity contend with Titans Light, No marvaile then although their Beames doe dazle humane sight. Sound lowd your Trumpets then from Londons loftiest Towers, To beate the stormie Tempests back, and calme the raging Showers, Set the Cornet with the Flute, The Orpharion to the Lute, Tuning the Taber and the Pipe to the sweet Violons, And mocke the Thunder in the Ayre with the lowd Clarions. Beta, long may thine Altars smoke with yeerely Sacrifice, And long thy sacred Temples may their high Dayes solemnize, Thy Shepheards watch by Day and Night, Thy Mayds attend thy holy Light, And thy large Empire stretch her Armes from East in to the West, And Albion on the Appenines advance her conquering Crest. Perkin. Thanks, gentle Rowland, for my Roundelay, And as for Beta, burthen of thy Song, The Shepheards Goddesse may shee flourish long, And happy bee. And not disdayne to be belov'd of thee: Triumphing Albion, clap thy Hands for joy, That hast so long not tasted of annoy, Nor that thou may. Rowland. Shepheard, and when my milke-white Eaws have yean'd, Beta shall have the firstling of the Fold, Yea, though the Hornes were of the purest gold, And the fine Fleece, the richest purple Graine. Perkin. Beleeve me, as I am true Shepheards Swaine, Then for thy love all other I forsake, And unto thee my selfe I doe betake, With Faith unfayn'd. THE FOURTH EGLOGUE. Shepheard, why creepe we in this lowly vaine Motto. Shepheard, why creepe we in this lowly vaine, As though our store no better us affords? And in this season when the stirring Swaine Makes the wide fields sound with great thundring words? Not as 'twas wont, now rurall be our Rimes, Shepheards of late are waxed wondrous neate. Though they were richer in the former Times, We be inraged with more kindly heate. The with'red Laurell freshly growes againe, Which simply shaddow'd the Pierian Spring, Which oft invites the solitary Swaine, Thither, to heare those sacred Virgins sing: Then if thy Muse have spent her wonted zeale, With with'red twists thy fore-head shall be bound: But if with these shee dare advance her Saile, Amongst the best then may shee bee renown'd. Gorbo. Shepheard, these Men at mightie things doe ayme, And therefore presse into the learned Troope, With filed Phraze to dignifie their Name, Else with the World shut in this shamefull Coope. But such a Subject ill beseemeth me, For I must Pipe amongst the lowly sort, Those silly Heard-groomes who have laught to see, When I by Moone-shine made the Fayries sport. Who of the toyles of Hercules will treat, And put his Hand to an eternall Pen, In such high Labours it behooves he sweat, To soare beyond the usuall pitch of Men: Such Monster-tamers who would take in Hand, As have tyde up the Triple-headed Hound, Or of those Gyants which 'gainst Heaven durst stand, Whose strength the Gods it troubled to confound: Who listeth with so mightie things to mell, And dares a taske so great to undertake, Should rayse the blacke inhabitants of Hell, And stirre a Tempest on the Stygian Lake. He that to Worlds Pyramides will Build On those great Heroes got by heavenly Powers, Should have a Pen most plentifully fill'd In the full Streames of Learned Maro's Showres. Who will foretell Mutations, and of Men, Of Future things and wisely will inquire, Before should slumber in that Shadie Den, That often did with prophesie inspire. South-saying Sybils sleepen long agone, We have their Reed, but few have cond their Art, And the Merlin. Welsh Wisard cleaveth to a Stone, No Oracles more Wonders shall impart. When him this Round that neerest over-ran, His labouring Mother to this light did bring, Alexander the Great. The sweat that then from Orpheus Statue ran, Foretold the Prophets had whereon to sing. When Vertue had allotted her a Prize, The Oaken Garland, and the Lawrell Crowne, Fame then resum'd her lofty wings to rise, And Plumes were honour'd with the purple Gowne. When first Religion with a golden Chayne, Men unto fayre Civilitie did draw, Who sent from Heaven, brought Justice forth againe, To Keepe the Good, the viler sort to awe. That simple Age as simply sung of Love, Till thirst of Empire and of Earthly swayes, Drew the good Shepheard from his Lasses Glove, To sing of slaughter, and tumultuous frayes. Then Joves Love-theft was privily descry'd, How he plaid false play in Amphitrio's Bed, And young Apolio in the Mount of Ide, Gave OEnon Physicke for her Mayden-head: The tender Grasse was then the softest Bed: The pleasant'st Shades esteem'd the statelyest Halls, No Belly-Churle with Bacchus banqueted, Nor painted Rags then covered rotten Walls: Then simple Love, by simple Vertue way'd, Flowres the favours, which true Faith revealed, Kindnesse againe with kindnesse was repayd, And with sweet Kisses, Covenants were sealed. And Beauties selfe by her selfe beautified, Scorn'd Paintings Pergit, and the borrowed Haire, Nor monstrous Formes deformities did hide, The Foule to varnish with compounded Faire. The purest Fleece then covered the pure Skin: For pride as then with Lucifer remayn'd; Ill-favoured Fashions then were to begin, Nor wholesome Cloathes with poysoned Liquor stayn'd. But when the Bowels of the Earth were sought, Whose golden Entrailes Mortalls did espie, Into the World all mischiefe then was brought, This fram'd the Mint, that coyn'd our miserie. The loftie Pines were presently hew'd downe, And Men, Sea-Monsters, swam the bracky Flood, In Wainscote Tubs to seeke out Worlds unknowne, For certayne Ill, to leave assured Good. The Steed was tamde and fitted to the Field, That serves a Subject to the Riders Lawes, He that before ranne in the Pastures wyld, Felt the stiffe curbe controule his angrie Jawes. The Cyclops then stood sweating to the Fire, The use thereof in softning Metals found, That did streight Limbs in stubborne Steele attire, Forging sharpe Tooles the tender flesh to wound. The Citie-builder, then intrencht his Towres, And laid his Wealth within the walled Towne, Which afterward in rough and stormie Stowres, Kindled the fire that burnt his Bulwarkes downe. This was the sad beginning of our woe, That was from Hell on wretched mortals hurl'd, And from this Fount did all those Mischiefes flow, Whose inundation drowneth all the World. Motto. Well, Shepheard, well, the golden Age is gone, Wishes no way revoke that which is past: Small wit there were to make two griefes of one; And our complaints we vainly should but waste. Listen to me then, lovely Shepheards Lad, And thou shalt heare, attentive if thou be, A prettie Tale I of my Grandame had, One Winters Night when there were none but we. Gorbo. Shepheard, say on, so may we passe the time, There is no doubt, it is some worthy Rime. Motto. Farre in the Countrey of Arden, There won'd a Knight, hight Cassamen, As bold as Isenbras: Fell was he and eager bent, In Battaile and in Tournament, As was the good Sir Topas. He had as antike Stories tell, A Daughter cleaped Dowsabel, A Mayden faire and free. And for she was her Fathers Heire, Full well she was ycond the leire, Of mickle courtesie. The Silke well couth she twist and twine, And make the fine March-pine, And with the Needle-worke: And she couth helpe the Priest to say His Mattens on a Holy-day, And sing a Psalme in Kirke. She ware a Frock of frollick Greene, Might well become a Mayden Queene, Which seemly was to see; A Hood to that so neat and fine, In colour like the Columbine, I wrought full featuously. Her features all as fresh above, As is the Grasse that growes by Dove, nd lythe as Lasse of Kent. Her skin as soft as Lemster Wooll, As white as Snow, on Peakish Hull, Or Swan that swims in Trent. This Mayden in a Morne betime, Went forth when May was in the prime, To get sweet Setywall, The Honey-suckle, the Harlocke, The Lilly, and the Lady-smocke, To decke her Summer Hall. Thus as she wandred here and there, And picked of the bloomie Bryer, She chanced to espy A Shepheard sitting on a Banke, Like Chanti-cleere he crowed cranke, And pip'd full merrily. He learn'd his Sheep, as he him list, When he would whistle in his fist, To feed about him round. Whilst he full many a Carroll sang, Untill the Fields and Medowes rang, And that the Woods did sound. In favour this same Shepheard Swaine, Was like the Bedlam Tamberlaine, Which held proud Kings in awe. But meeke as any Lambe mought bee, And innocent of ill as he, Whom his lewd Brother slaw. This Shepheard ware a Sheepe-gray Cloke, Which was of the finest loke, That could be cut with sheere. His Mittens were of Bauzons skin, His Cockers were of Cordiwin, His Hood of Miniveere. His Aule and Lingell in a Thong, His Tar-box on his broad Belt hung, His Breech of Cointree Blue. Full crispe and curled were his Lockes, His Browes as white as Albion Rockes, So like a Lover true, And piping still he spent the day, So merry as the Popinjay, Which liked Dowsabell. That would she ought, or would she nought, This Lad would never from her thought, She in love-longing fell. At length she tucked up her Frocke, White as the Lilly was her Smocke, She drew the Shepheard nie: But then the Shepheard pip'd a good, That all his Sheepe forsooke their food, To heare his Melodie. Thy Sheepe, quoth shee, cannot be leane, That have a jolly Shepheards Swaine, The which can pipe so well: Yea but (saith he) their Shepheard may, If piping thus he pine away, In love of Dowsabell. Of love, fond Boy, take thou no keepe, Quoth she, looke well unto thy sheepe, Lest they should hap to stray. Quoth he, So had I done full well, Had I not seene faire Dowsabell Come forth to gather May. With that she 'gan to vaile her head, Her Cheekes were like the Roses red, But not a word she said, With that the Shepheard 'gan to frowne, He threw his prettie Pipes adowne, And on the ground him laid. Saith she, I may not stay till Night, And leave my Summer Hall undight, And all for love of thee. My Coat, saith he, nor yet my Fold, Shall neither Sheepe nor Shepheard hold, Except thou favour mee. Saith she, Yet lever I were dead, Then I should lose my Maiden-head, And all for love of men. Sai'th he, Yet are you too unkind, If in your heart you cannot find, To love us now and then. And I to thee will be as kind, As Colin was to Rosalind, Of courtesie the flowre. Then will I be as true, quoth she, As ever Maiden yet might be Unto her Paramour. With that she bent her Snow-white knee, Downe by the Shepheard kneeled shee, And him she sweetly kist. With that the Shepheard whoop'd for joy, Quoth he, there's never Shepheards Boy, That ever was so blist. Gorbo. Now by my Sheephooke, here's a Tale alone, Learne me the same, and I will give thee hire, This were as good as Curds for our Jone, When at a Night we sitten by the fire. Motto. Why gentle Gorbo, ile not sticke for that, When we shall meet upon some merrie day: But see, whilst we have set us downe to chat, Yon Tykes of mine begin to steale away. And if thou please to come unto our Greene, On Lammas day, when as we have our Feast, Thou shalt sit next unto the Shepheards Queene, And there shalt be the only welcome Ghest. THE FIFT EGLOGUE. Come, let us frollike merrily, my Swaine Motto. Come, let us frollike merrily, my Swaine, Let's see what Spirit there quickens yet in thee, If there so much be left but as a Graine, Of the great stock of antike Poesie, Or living but one slip of Phœbus sacred Tree. Or if reserv'd from Times devouring rage, With his sad Ruines scorning once to fall, Any Memoriall left thee as a gage: Or the delight of simple Pastorall, May thee revive, whom care seemes to appall. To Fortunes Orphanes Nature hath bequeath'd, What mightiest Monarchs seldome have possest, From highest Heaven this influence is breath'd, The most Divine Impression of the brest, And whom th'one pines, the other oft doth feast. Nor doth 't affect this fond Gentilitie, Whereon the Foole World open-mouthed gazes, Thinking it selfe of great abilitie, That it a great great Grandsires Glorie blazes, And paints out Fictions in untimely Phrases. Idlely we thinke that Honour can inflame These moving Pictures, made but for the Street, (We daily find) that overlive their name, And blacke Oblivion is their winding sheet, Their Glorie trodden under vulgar feet. Envie discharging all her poys'ned Darts, The valiant minde is temp'red with that fire, At her fierce loose that weakly never starts, But in despight, doth force her to retyre, With carelesse feet and spurnes her in the myre. Rowland. I may not sing of such as fall nor clime, Nor chaunt of Armes, and of Heroike Deeds, It fitteth not a Shepheards rurall Rime, Nor is agreeing with my Oaten Reeds: Nor from my Song, grosse Flatt'rie proceeds. On the Worlds Idols I doe hate to smile, Nor shall their Names e'r in my Page appeare, To bolster Basenesse I account it vile, 'Tis not their Lookes, nor Greatnesse that I feare, Nor shall 't be knowne by me, that such there were. No fatall Dreads, nor fruitlesse vaine Desires, Low Caps and Court'sies to a painted Wall, Nor heaping rotten sticks on needlesse fires, Ambitious waies to climbe, nor feares to fall, Nor things so base doe I affect at all. Motto. If these, nor these may like thy varying Quill, As of too high, or of too low a straine, That doe not aptly paralell thy skill, Nor well agreeing with a Shepheards vaine, Subjects (suppos'd) ill to beseeme a Swaine. Then tune thy Pipe to thy Idea's praise, And teach the Woods to wonder at her name, Thy lowly Notes so maist thou lightly raise, And thereby others happily inflame: Yet thou the whilst, stand farthest off from blame. Thy Temples then with Lawrell shall be dight, When as thy Muse got hie upon her wing, With nimble Pineons shall direct her flight, To th'place from whence all Harmonies doe spring, To rape the Fields with touches of her string. Rowland. Shepheard, since thou so strongly do'st perswade, And her just worth so amply us affoords, O sacred Furie, all my Powers invade, All fulnesse flowes from thy abundant hoords, Her prayse requires the excellentest words. Shall I then first sing of her heavenly eye, To it attracting every other sight? May a poore Shepheards praise aspire so hye, Which if the Sunne should give us up to Night, The Stars from it should fetch a purer Light. Or that faire brow, where Beautie keepes her state, There still residing as her proper Spheare, Which when the World she meaneth to amate, Wonder invites to stand before her there, Throughout the World the praise thereof to beare. Or touch her cheeke, deare Natures Treasurie, Whereas she stores th'abundance of her Blisse, Where of her selfe, she'xacts such usurie, That she's else needie by inwealthying this, And like a Miser her rich chest doth kisse. Or those pure hands in whose delicious Palmes, Love takes delight the Palmester to play, Whose christall fingers dealing heavenly Almes, Give the whole wealth of all the World away. O, who of these sufficiently can say! Or th'Ivorie Columnes, which this Fane upbeare, Where Dian's Nuns their Goddesse doe adore, Before her, ever sacrificing there, Her hallowed Altars kneeling still before, Where more they doe performe, their Zeale the more: Unconning Shepheard of these praise I none, Although surpassing, yet let I them passe, Nor in this kind her Excellence is showne, To sing of these, not my intent it was, Our Muse must undergoe a waightier masse, And be directed by a straighter line, Which me must unto higher Regions guide, That I her Vertues rightly may define, From me my selfe that's able to divide, Unlesse by them my weaknesse be supplide. That be the end whereat I only ayme, Which to performe, I faithfully must strive, Faire as I can to build this goodly frame, And every part so aptly to contrive, That time from this Example may derive. In whom, as on some wel-prepared Stage, Each morall Vertue acts a Princely part, Where every Scene pronounced by a Sage, Hath the true fulnesse both of Wit and Art, And wisely stealeth the Spectators heart, That every censure worthily doth brooke, And unto it a great attention drawes, In t'which when Wisdome doth severely looke, Often therewith she forced is to pause, To yeeld a free and generall applause. Who unto goodnesse can she not excite, And in the same not teacheth to be wise, And deeply seene in each obsequious rite, Wherein of that some mystery there lyes, Which her sole studie is, and only exercise? But the great'st Volume, nor exactest Comment, Wherein art ever absolutest shined, Nor the small'st Letter filling up the Margent, Yet every space with matter interlined, In the high'st Knowledge, rightly her defined. O! if but sense effectually could see, What is in her t'be worthily admired, How infinite her Excellencies bee, The date of which can never be expired, From her high praise, the World could not be hired. But since that Heaven must onely be the Mirror, Wherein the World can her perfections view, And Fame is strooken silent with the terror, Wanting wherewith to pay what is her due, Colours can give her nothing that is new. Then since there wants abilitie in colours, Nor Pensill yet sufficiently can blaze her, For her Ile make a Mirror of my dolours, And in my teares sheest' looke her selfe and prayse her: Happy were I, if such a Glasse might please her. Goe, gentle winds, and whisper in her Eare, And tell Idea, how much I adore her, And you, my Flocks, report yee to my Faire, How farre she passeth all that went before her, And as their Goddesse all the Plaines adore her. And thou, cleere Brooke, by whose pure silver streame Grow those tall Okes, where I have carv'd her name, Convay her prayse to Neptunes watry Realme, And bid the Tritons to sound forth her Fame, Untill wide Neptune scarce containe the same. Motto. Stay there, good Rowland, whither art thou rapt, Beyond the Moone that strivest thus to straine? Into what phrensie lately art thou hapt, That in this sort intoxicates thy Braine, Much disagreeing from a Shepheards vaine? Rowland. Motto, why me so strangely shouldst thou tempt, Above my strength with th'Magick of her stile? The scope of which from limits is exempt, As be all they that of it doe compile, Able to raise the spirit that is most vile. Didst thou me first unto her prayses stirre, And now at last, dost thou againe refuse me? What if perhaps with too much love I erre, And that therein the forward Muse abuse me? The cause thou gav'st is able to excuse me. Motto. Rowland then cease, reserve thy plenteous Muse, Till future time, thy simple oaten Reed Shall with a farre more glorious rage infuse, To sing the glory of some Worthies deed: For this I thinke, but little shall thee steed. Rowland. Shepheard, farewell, the Skyes begin to lowre, Yon pitchy Cloud, that hangeth in the West, Shewes us, ere long, that we shall have a showre: Come, let us home, for I so thinke it best, For to their Cotes our Flocks are gone to rest. Motto. Content, and if thoul't come to my poore Cote, Although, God knowes, my cheere be very small, For wealth with me was never yet a-flote: Yet take in gree what ever doe befall, Wee'll sit and turne a Crab, and tune a Madrigall. THE SIXT EGLOGUE. Well met, good Winken, whither dost thou wend? Gorbo. Well met, good Winken, whither dost thou wend? How hast thou far'd, old Shepheard, many a yeere? His dayes in darknesse, thus can Winken spend, Who I have knowne for piping had no Peere? Where be those faire Flocks thou wert wont to guide? What, be they dead, or hapt on some mischance? Or mischiefe thee their Master doth betyde? Or Lordly Love hath cast thee in a trance? What Man, let's still be merry while we may, And take a Truce with Sorrow for a time, The whil'st we passe this weary Winters day, In reading Riddles, or in making Rime. Winken. A wo's me, Gorbo, mirth is farre away, Nor may it sojourne with sad discontent, O! blame me not (to see this dismall Day) Then, though my poore Heart it in pieces rent. My tune is turn'd into a Swanlike song, That best becomes me drawing to my death, Till which, me thinks, that every houre is long, My brest become a Prison to my Breath. Nothing more lothsome then the cheerefull Light, Com'n is my Night, when once appeares the Day: The blessed Sunne is odious to my sight, Nor sound me liketh, but the Shreech-Owles Lay. Gorbo. What, mayst thou be that old Winken De Word, That of all Shepheards wert the Man alone, Which once with laughter shook'st the Shepheards Boord, With thine owne madnesse lastly overthrowne? I thinke, thou dot'st in thy declining Age, Or for the loosenesse of thy Youth art sorry, And therefore vow'st some solemne Pilgrimage, To holy An ancient Pilgrimage in Glostershire, called the Holy Rood of Hayles. Hayles, or That famous Cave of Ireland. Patricks Purgatorie. Come, sit we downe under this Hawthorne Tree, The Morrowes Light shall lend us Day enough, And let us tell of Gawen, or Sir Guy. Of Robin-Hood, or of old Clem a Clough. Or else some Romant unto us areede, By former Shepheards taught thee in thy youth, Of noble Lords and Ladies gentle deede, Or of thy Love, or of thy Lasses truth. Winken. Shepheard, no, no, that World with me is past, Merry was it, when we those Toyes might tell: But 'tis not now as when thou saw'st me last, A great mischance me since that time befell. Elphin is dead, and in his Grave is laid, O! to report it, how my Heart it grieveth! Cruell, that Fate, that so the Time betraid, And of our Joyes untimely us depriveth. Gorbo. Is it for him thy tender Heart doth bleed? For him that living was the Shepheards pride: Never did Death so mercilesse a deed, Ill hath he done, and ill may him betyde: Nought hath he got, nor of much more can boast, Nature is paid the utmost of her due, Pan hath receiv'd so dearly that him cost. O Heavens, his Vertues did belong to you. Doe not thou then uncessantly complaine, Best doth the meane befit the Wise in mourning: And to recall that, labour not in vaine, Which is by Fate prohibited returning. Winken. Wer't for the best this present World affords, Shepheard, our sorrowes might be easly cast, But, oh, his losse requireth more then Words, Nor it so slightly can be over-past. When his fayre Flocks he fed upon the Downes, The poorest Shepheard suffered not annoy: Now are we subject to those beastly Clownes, That all our mirth would utterly destroy. Long after he was shrowded in the Earth, The Birds for sorrow did forbeare to sing, Shepheards forwent their wonted Summers mirth, Winter therewith outwore a double Spring. That, had not Nature lastly call'd to mind, The neere approching of her owne decay, Things should have gone contrary unto kind, And to the Chaos all was like to sway. The Nymphs forbare in silver Springs to looke, With sundry Flowers to brayd their yellow Haire, And to the Desarts sadly them betooke, So much opprest, and over-come with care. And for his sake the early wanton Lambs, That 'mongst the Hillocks wont to skip and play, Sadly ran bleating from their carefull Dams, Nor would their soft Lips to the Udders lay. The Groves, the Mountaynes, and the pleasant Heath, That wonted were with Roundelayes to ring, Are blasted now with the cold Northerne breath, That not a Shepheard takes delight to sing. Who would not die when Elphin now is gone? Living, that was the Shepheards true delight. With whose blest Spirit (attending him alone) Vertue to Heaven directly tooke her flight. Onely from Fooles he from the World did flie, Knowing the Time strange Monsters forth should bring, That should his lasting Poesie denie, His Worth and Honour rashly censuring: Whil'st he aloft with glorious Wings is borne, Singing with Angels in the gorgeous Skie, Laughing even Kings and their delights to scorne, And all those Sots that them doe Deifie. And learned Shepheard, thou to time shalt live, When their false Names are utterly forgotten, And Fame to thee Eternitie shall give, When with their Bones their Sepulchers are rotten. Nor mournefull Cypres, nor sad Widdowing Yeaw, About thy Tombe to prosper shall be seene, But Bay and Mirtle which be ever new, In spight of Winter flourishing and greene. Summers long'st Day shall Shepheards not suffice, To sit and tell full Stories of thy prayse, Nor shall the longest Winters Night comprize Their sighes for him, the subject of their Layes. And, gentle Shepheards (as sure some there bee) That living yet, his Vertues doe inherit, Men from base envy and detraction free, Of upright Hearts, and of as humble Spirit: Thou, that downe from the goodly Westerne waste, To drinke at Avon driv'st thy Sunned Sheepe, Good Melibeus, that so wisely hast Guided the Flocks delivered thee to keepe. Forget not Elphin, and thou gentle Swayne, That dost thy Pipe by silver Doven sound, Alexis that dost with thy Flocks remayne, Farre off within the Calydonian Ground, Be mindfull of that Shepheard that is dead, And thou too long that I to Pipe have taught, Unhappy Rowland that from me art fled: And sett'st old Winken and his words at nought: And like a gracelesse and untutor'd Lad, Art now departed from my aged sight, And needsly to the Southerne Fields wilt gad, Where thou dost live in thriftlesse vaine delight. Thou wanton Boy, as thou canst pipe aswell, As any he, a Bag-pipe that doth beare, Still let thy Rounds of that good Shepheard tell, To whom thou hast beene evermore so deare. Many, you seeming, to excell in Fame, And say as they, that none can pipe so hie, Scorning well-neere a Shepheards simple Name, So puff'd and blowne with Worldly vanitie: These, if an aged Man may Umpire bee, Whose Pipes are well-neere worne out of his Hand, The highest skill, that in their Songs I see, Scarce reach the Base whereon his prayses stand. And all those Toyes that vainely you allure, Shall in the end no other guerdon have, But living shall you mickle wo procure, And lastly bring you to an unknowne Grave. Then, gentle Shepheards, wheresoere you rest, In Hill or Dale, however that you bee, Whether with Love or Worldly care opprest, Or be you Bond, or happily bee Free: The closing Evening 'ginning to be darke, When as the small Birds sing the Sunne to sleepe, You fold your Lambs; or, with the earely Larke, Into the faire Fields drive your harmelesse Sheepe: Still let your Pipes be busied in his prayse, Untill your Flocks be learnt his losse to know, And tattling Eccho many sundrie wayes, Be taught by you to warble forth our wo. Gorbo. Cease, Shepheard, cease, from further plaints refrayne, See but of one, how many doe arise, That by the Tempest of my troubled Brayne, The Floud's alreadie swelling up mine Eyes. And now the Sunne beginneth to decline: Whil'st we in woes the time away doe weare See where yon little moping Lambe of mine, It selfe hath tangled in a crawling Breere. THE SEVENTH EGLOGUE. Borril, why sitt'st thou musing in thy Cote Batte. Borril, why sitt'st thou musing in thy Cote, Like dreaming Merlin in his drowsie Cell? With too much Learning doth the Shepheard dote? Or art inchanted with some Magike spell? A Hermits life, or mean'st thou to professe? Or to thy Beades, fall like an Anchoresse? See how faire Flora decks our Fields with Flowres, And clothes our Groves in gawdy Summers greene, And wanton Ver distils her selfe in Showres, To hasten Ceres, Harvests hallowed Queene, Neere-hand that in her yellow Robe appeares, Crowning full Summer with her ripened Eares. Now, Shepheards lay their Winter Weeds away, And in neate Jackets minsen on the Playnes, And at the Rivers fishen Day by day, Now who so frollicke as the Shepheards Swaynes? Why lig'st thou here then in thy lothsome Cave, Like as a Man put quicke into his Grave? Borril. Batte, my Cote from Tempest standeth free, When stately Towres beene often shak'd with Wind: And wilt thou, Batte, come and sit with mee, The happy Life here shalt thou onely find, Free from the Worlds vile and inconstant qualmes, And herry Pan with Orizons and Almes, And scorne the Crow'd of such as cog for pence, And waste their wealth in sinfull braverie, Whose gayne is losse, whose thrift is lewd expence, Content to live in golden slaverie, Wond'ring at Toyes, as foolish Worldlings doone, Like to the Dog that barketh at the Moone. Here mayst thou range the goodly pleasant Field, And search out simples to procure thy heale, What sundry Vertues, sundry Herbs doe yeeld, 'Gainst griefe which may thy Sheepe or thee assaile: Here mayst thou hunt the little harmelesse Hare, Or laugh t'intrap false Raynard in a snare. Or if thee please in antique Romants Reed, Of gentle Lords and Ladies that of yore, In forraine Lands did many a famous deed, And beene renown'd from East to Westerne Shore, Or Shepheards skill i'th' course of Heaven to know, When this Starre falls, when that it selfe doth show. Batte. Shepheard, these things beene all to coy for mee, Whose youth is spent in jollity and mirth, Syke hidden Arts beene better fitting thee, Whose dayes are fast declining to the Earth: Mayst thou suppose that I shall ere endure, To follow that no pleasure can procure? These beene for such them Votarie doe make, And doe accept the Mantle and the Ring, And the long Night continually doe wake, Musing, themselves how they to Heaven may bring, That whisper still of sorrow in their Bed, And doe despise both Love and Lusty-head. Like to the Curre with anger well-neere wood, Who makes his Kennell in the Oxes stall, And snarleth when he seeth him take his food, And yet his Chaps can chew no Hay at all: Borril, even so it with thy state doth fare, And with all those that such like Wisards are. Borril. Sharpe is the Thorne, soone I perceive by thee, Bitter the Blossome when the Fruit is sowre, And earely crook'd that will a Camocke bee; Lowd is the Wind before a stormy Showre: Pity thy Wit should be so much misse-led, And thus ill guided by a giddy Head. Ah, foolish Elfe, I at thy madnesse grieve, That art abus'd by thy lewd braine-sicke Will, Those hidden baits that canst not yet perceive, Nor find the cause that breedeth all thy ill, Thou think'st all gold, that hath a golden show, But art deceiv'd, and that I truely know. Such one art thou, as is the little Fly, Who is so Crowse and Gamesome with the flame, Till with her bus'nesse and her nicitie, Her nimble Wings are scortched with the same: Then falls shee downe with pitious buzzing note, And in the Fire doth sindge her mourning Coate. Batte. Alas, good Man, thou now beginst to rave, Thy Wits doe erre and misse the Cushion quite, Because thy Head is gray, and Words be grave, Thou think'st thereby to draw me from delight; Tush, I am young, nor sadly can I sit, But must doe all that Youth and Love befit. Thy backe is crook'd, thy Knees doe bend for Age, Whil'st I am swift and nimble as the Roe, Thou, like a Bird, art shut up in a Cage, And in the Fields I wander to and fro; Thou must doe penance for thy old misdeeds, On the Worlds joyes, the whil'st my fancy feeds. Say what thou canst, yet me it shall not let: For why, my fancy strayneth me so sore, That Day and Night my mind is wholly set, How to enjoy, and please my Paramore: Onely on Love, I set my whole delight, The Summers Day, and all the Winters Night. That pretty Cupid, little God of Love, Whose imped Wings with speckled Plumes are dight, Who woundeth Men below, and Gods above, Roving at randon with his fethered flight: Whilst lovely Venus stands to give the ayme, Smiling to see her wanton Bantlings game. Upon my Staffe his Statue will I carve, His Bow and Quiver on his winged Backe; His forked heads for such as them deserve, And not of his one implement shall lacke, And in her Coach faire Cypria set above, Drawne with a Swanne, a Sparrow, and a Dove. And under them Thisbe of Babylon, With Cleopatra Egypts chiefe renowne, Phillis that dy'd for love of Demophon, And lovely Dido, Queene of Carthage Towne: Who ever held God Cupids Lawes so deare, To whom we offer Sacrifice each yeere. Borril. A wilfull Boy, thy folly now I find, And it is hard a Fooles talke to endure, Thou art as deafe, as thy poore God is blind, Such as the Saint, such is the Serviture. Then of this Love, wilt please thee heare a Song, That's to the purpose, though it be not long? Batte. Borril, sing on, I pray thee, let us heare, That I may laugh to see thee shake thy Beard, But take heed, Shepheard, that thy voyce be cleere, Or (by my Hood) thou'lt make us all afeard, Or 'tis a doubt that thou wilt fright our Flocks, When they shall heare thee barke so like a Fox. Borril. Now, fie upon thee, wayward Love, Wo to Venus which did nurse thee, Heaven and Earth thy plagues doe prove, Gods and Men have cause to curse thee. What art thou but th'extremest madnesse, Natures first and only errour, That consum'st our dayes in sadnesse, By the minds continuall terrour: Walking in Cymerian blindnesse, In thy courses voyd of Reason, Sharpe reproofe thy only kindnesse, In thy trust the highest Treason? Both the Nymph and ruder Swaine, Vexing with continuall anguish, Which dost make the old complaine, And the young to pine and languish: Who thee keepes his care doth nurse, That seducest all to folly, Blessing, bitterly doest curse, Tending to destruction wholly: Thus of thee as I began, So againe, I make an end, Neither God, neither Man, Neither Faiery, neither Fiend. Batte. Now surely, Shepheard, here's a goodly Song, Upon my word, I never heard a worse; Away, old Foole, and learne to rule thy tongue, I would thy Clap were shut up in my Purse, It is thy life, if thou mayst scold and brawle, Though in thy words there be no wit at all. And for the wrong that thou to Love hast done, I will revenge it, and deferre no time, And in this manner as thou hast begun, I will recite thee a substantiall Rime, That to thy teeth sufficiently shall prove, There is no power to be compar'd to Love. Borril. Come on, good Boy, I pray thee let us heare, Much will be said, and nev'r a whit the neere. Batte. What is Love, but the desire Of that thing the fancy pleaseth? A holy and resistlesse fire, Weake and strong, alike that ceaseth, Which not Heaven hath power to let, Nor wise Nature cannot smother. Whereby Phœbus doth beget On the universall Mother, That the everlasting Chaine, Which together all things tyed, And unmov'd doth them retayne, And by which they shall abide: That concent we cleerly find, Which doth things together draw, And so strong in every kind, Subjects them to Natures Law, Whose high Vertue number teaches, In which every thing doth moove, From the lowest depth that reaches, To the height of Heaven above: Harmony that wisely found, When the cunning hand doth strike, Whereas every amorous sound, Sweetly marries with the like. The tender Cattell scarcely take, From their Damm's the Fields to prove, But each seeketh out a Make, Nothing lives that doth not love: Not so much as but the Plant, As Nature every thing doth paire, By it if the Male doe want, Doth dislike and will not beare: Nothing then is like to Love, In the which all Creatures be, From it ne'r let me remove, Nor let it remove from me. Borril. Remove from thee? Alas, poore silly Lad, To soone shalt thou be weary of thy Ghest: For where he rules, no Reason can be had, That is an open enemie to rest: I grieve to thinke, e'r many yeeres be spent, How much thou shalt thy time in love repent. Batte. Gramercie, Borril, for thy companie, For all thy Jests, and all thy merrie Bourds, Upon thy judgement much I shall relie, Because I find such Wisdome in thy words: Would I might watch, when ever thou dost ward, So much thy love and Friendship I regard. THE EIGHTH EGLOGUE. It joyes me, Gorbo, yet we meet at last Perkin. It joyes me, Gorbo, yet we meet at last, 'Tis many a Mon'th since I the Shepheard saw, Me thinkes thou look'st as thou wert much agast, What is't so much that should thy courage awe? What, man? Have Patience, Wealth will come and go, And to the end the World shall ebbe and flow. The valiant man, whose thoughts be firmly placed, And sees sometime how Fortune list to rage, That by her frownes he would not be disgraced, By Wisdome his straight Actions so doth gage, That when she fawnes, and turnes her squinting eye, He laughes to scorne her loose Inconstancie. When as the Cullian, and the viler Clowne, That like the Swine on Draffe sets his desire, Feeling the tempest, sadly layes him downe, Whilst that blind Strumpet treads him in the mire: Yet tasting Weale, the Beast will quickly bray, But feeling wo, as soone consumes away. Gorbo. Perkin, I thy Philosophie approve, And know who well hath learn'd her sacred wayes, The stormes of Fortune not so easly move, With her high Precepts arm'd at all assayes, When other folke her force may not indure, Because they want that Med'cine for their cure. Yet altogether blam'd let me not passe, Though often I, and worthily admire, Wisemen disgraced, and the barbarous Asse Unto high place and dignitie aspire: What should I say, that Fortune is to blame? Or unto what should I impute the shame? Perkin. Why, she is Queene here of this World below, That at her pleasure all things doth dispose, And blind, her gifts as blindly doth bestow, Yet where she raises, still she overthrowes: Therefore her Embleme is a turning Wheele, From whose high top the high soon'st downward reele. Gave she her gifts to vertuous men and wise, Shee should confirme this worldly state so sure, That very Babes her Godhead would despise, Nor longer here her Government endure: Best she may give from whom she ever takes, Fooles she may marre, for Fooles she ever makes. For her owne sake we Wisdome must esteeme, And not how other basely her regard: For howsoe'r disgraced she doth seeme, Yet she her owne is able to reward, And none are so essentially hie, As those that on her bountie doe relie. Gorbo. O but, good Shepheard, tell me where beene they, That as a God did Vertue so adore? And for her Impes did with such care purvey? Ah, but in vaine, their want we doe deplore, Long time since swaddled in their winding Sheet: And she I thinke is buried at their feet. Perkin. Nay, stay, good Gorbo, Vertue is not dead, Nor beene her friends gone all that wonned here, But to a Nymph, for succour she is fled, Which her doth cherish, and most holdeth deare, In her sweet bosome she hath built her Nest, And from the World, there doth she live at rest. This is that Nymph, on that great Westerne Waste Her Flocks far whither then the driven Snow, Faire Shepherdesse, cleere A River running by Wilton, neere to the Plaine of Salisburie. Willies bankes that grac'd, Yet she them both for purenesse doth out-goe: To whom all Shepheards dedicate their Layes, And on her Altars offer up their Bayes. Sister, sometime she to that Shepheard was, That yet for piping never had his Peere, Elphin, that did all other Swaines surpasse, To whom she was of living things most deare, And on his Death-bed by his latest Will, To her bequeth'd the Secrets of his Skill. Gorbo. May we yet hope then in their weaker kind, That there be some, poore Shepheards that respect: The World else universally inclin'd, To such an inconsiderate neglect, And the rude times their ord'rous matter fling, Into the sacred and once hallowed Spring. Women be weake, and subject most to change, Nor long to any can they stedfast bee, And as their Eyes, their Minds doe ever range, With every object varying that they see: Think'st thou in them that possibly can live, Which Nature most denyeth them to give? No other is the stedfastnesse of those, On whom even Nature will us to rely, Fraile is it that the Elements compose, Such is the state of all mortalitie, That as the humour in the bloud doth move, Lastly doe hate, what lately they did love. So did great Olcon, which a Phœbus seem'd, Whom all good Shepheards gladly flock'd about, And as a God of Rowland was esteem'd, Which to his prayse drew all the rurall Rout: For, after Rowland, as it had beene Pan, Onely to Olcon every Shepheard ran. But he forsakes the Heard-groome and his Flocks, Nor of his Bag-pipes takes at all no keepe, But to the sterne Wolfe and deceitfull Fox, Leaves the poore Shepheard and his harmelesse Sheepe, And all those Rimes that he of Olcon sung, The Swayne disgrac'd, participate his wrong. Perkin. Then since the Worlds distemp'rature is such, And Man made blind by her deceitfull show, Small Vertue in their weaker Sexe is much, And to it in them much the Muses owe, And praysing some may happily inflame, Others in time with liking of the same. As those two Sisters most discreetly wise, That Vertues hests religiously obey, Whose prayse my skill is wanting to comprize, Th'eld'st of which is that good Panape, In shadie Arden her deare Flocke that keepes, Where mournefull Ankor A River in the Confines of Warwick and Lestershire, in some parts deviding the Shires. for her sicknesse weepes. The yonger then, her Sister not lesse good, Bred where the other lastly doth abide, Modest Idea, flowre of Womanhood, That Rowland hath so highly Deifide: Whom Phœbus Daughters worthily prefer, And give their gifts aboundantly to her. Driving her Flocks up to the fruitfull A Mountaine neer Cotswold. Meene, Which daily lookes upon the lovely Stowre, Neere to that The Vale of Evsham. Vale, which of all Vales is Queene, Lastly, forsaking of her former Bowre: And of all places holdeth Cotswold deere, Which now is proud, because shee lives it neere. Then is deere Sylvia one the best alive, That once in A part of Staffordshire, famous for breeding Cattell. Moreland by the silver Trent, Her harmelesse Flockes as harmelesly did drive, But now allured to the Fields of Kent: The faithfull'st Nymph where ever that shee wonne, That at this day, doth live under the Sunne. Neere A River falling at Dertford, into the Thames. Ravensburne in Cotage low shee lyes, There now content her calme repose to take, The perfect cleerenesse of whose lovely eyes, Hath oft inforc'd the Shepheards to forsake Their Flocks, and Folds, and on her set their keepe, Yet her chaste thoughts still settled on her Sheepe. Then that deare Nymph that in the Muses joyes, That in wild A Forrest in Lestershire. Charnwood with her Flocks doth goe, Mirtilla, Sister to those hopefull Boyes, My loved Thirsis, and sweet Palmeo: That oft to A River under the same Forrest. Soar the Southerne Shepheards bring, Of whose cleere waters they divinely sing. So good shee is, so good likewise they bee, As none to her might brother be but they, Nor none a Sister unto them, but shee, To them for wit few like, I dare well say: In them as nature truely meant to show, How neere the first, shee in the last could goe. Gorbo. Shepheard, their prayse thou dost so cleerely sing, That even when Groves their Nightingales shall want, Nor Valleyes heard with rurall notes to ring: And every-where when Shepheards shall be scant: Their names shall live from memorie unrazed, Of many a Nymph and gentle Shepheards praised. THE NINTH EGLOGUE. Late 'twas in June, the Fleece when fully growne Late 'twas in June, the Fleece when fully growne, In the full compasse of the passed yeere, The Season well by skilfull Shepheards knowne, That them provide immediately to sheere. Their Lambes late wax't so lusty and so strong, That time did them their Mothers Teats forbid, And in the fields the common flocks among, Eate of the same Grasse that the greater did. When not a Shepheard any thing that could, But greaz'd his start-ups blacke as Autumns Sloe, And for the better credit of the Wold, In their fresh Russets every one doth goe. Who now a Posie pins not in his Cap? And not a Garland Baldricke-wise doth weare? Some, of such Flowers as to his hand doth hap, Others, such as a secret meaning beare: He from his Lasse him Lavander hath sent, Shewing her Love, and doth requitall crave, Him Rosemary his Sweet-heart, whose intent, Is that, he her should in remembrance have. Roses, his youth and strong desire expresse, Her Sage, doth shew his soverainty in all, The July-Flowre declares his gentlenesse, Time, Truth, the Pansie, Harts-ease Maydens call: In Cotes such simples, simply in request, Wherewith proud Courts in greatnesse scorne to mell, For Countrey toyes become the Countrey best, And please poore Shepheards, and become them well. When the new-wash'd flocke from the rivers side, Comming as white as Januaries Snow, The Ram with Nose-gaies beares his Hornes in pride, And no lesse brave, the Bell-wether doth goe. After their faire flocks in a lusty rowt, Came the gay Swaynes with Bag-pipes strongly blowne, And busied, though this solemne sport about, Yet had each one an eye unto his owne. And by the ancient Statutes of the Field, He that his Flocks the earlyest Lambe should bring, (As it fell out then, Rowlands charge to yeeld) Alwayes for that yeere was the Shepheards King. And soone preparing for the Shepheards Boord, Upon a Greene that curiously was squar'd, With Country Cates be'ng plentifully stor'd: And 'gainst their comming handsomely prepar'd: New Whig, with Water from the cleerest streame, Greene Plummes, and Wildings, Cherries chiefe of Feast, Fresh Cheese, and Dowsets, Curds and clowted Creame, Spic'd Syllibubs, and Sider of the best: And to the same downe solemnely they sit, In the fresh shaddow of their Summer Bowres, With sundrie sweets them every way to fit, The Neighb'ring Vale dispoyled of her Flowres. And whil'st together merry thus they make, The Sunne to West a little 'gan to leane, Which the late fervour, soone againe did slake, When as the Nymphs came forth upon the Plaine, Here might you many a Shepheardesse have seene, Of which no place, as Cotswold, such doth yeeld, Some of it native, some for love I weene, Thither were come from many a fertill Field. There was the Widdowes Daughter of the Glen, Deare Rosalynd, that scarsly brook'd compare, The Moreland-Mayden, so admir'd of Men, Bright Goldy-Locks, and Phillida the faire. Lettice and Parnel, pretty lovely Peates, Cusse of the Fold, the Virgin of the Well, Faire Ambry with the Alablaster Teates, And more, whose Names were here to long to tell. Which now came forward following their Sheepe, Their batning Flocks on grassy Leaes to hold, Thereby from skathe, and perill them to keepe, Till Evening come that it were time to fold. When now, at last, as lik'd the Shepheards King, (At whose command they all obedient were) Was pointed, who the Roundelay should sing, And who againe the under-Song should beare: The first whereof he Batte doth bequeath, A wittier Wag on all the Wold's not found, Gorbo, the Man, that him should sing beneath, Which his lowd Bag-pipe skilfully could sound. Who amongst all the Nymphs that were in sight, Batte his daintie Daffadil there mist, Which, to enquire of, doing all his might, Him his Companion kindly doth assist. Batte. Gorbo, as thou cam'st this way, By yonder little Hill, Or, as thou, through the Fields didst stray, Saw'st thou my Daffadil? Shee's in a Frocke of Lincolne greene, Which colour likes her sight, And never hath her beautie seene, But through a vale of white. Then Roses richer to behold, That trim up Lovers Bowres, The Pansie and the Marigold, Tho Phœbus Paramours. Gorbo. Thou well describ'st the Daffadill, It is not full an houre, Since, by the Spring, neere yonder Hill, I saw that lovely Flowre. Batte. Yet my faire Flowre thou didst not meet, Nor newes of her didst bring, And yet my Daffadil's more sweet, Then that by yonder Spring. Gorbo. I saw a Shepheard that doth keepe, In yonder Field of Lillies, Was making (as he fed his Sheepe) A Wreathe of Daffadillies. Batte. Yet, Gorbo, thou delud'st me still, My Flowre thou didst not see, For, know, my pretty Daffadil Is worne of none but mee. To shew it selfe but neere her seate, No Lilly is so bold, Except to shade her from the heate, Or keepe her from the cold. Gorbo. Through yonder Vale as I did pass, Descending from the Hill, I met a smerking bonny Lasse, They call her Daffadil: Whose presence, as along shee went, The pretty Flowres did greet, As though their Heads they downeward bent, With homage to her feet. And all the Shepheards that were nie, From top of every Hill, Unto the Valleyes lowd did crie, There goes sweet Daffadil. Batte. I, gentle Shepheard, now with joy Thou all my Flocks dost fill, That's shee alone, kind Shepheards Boy, Let us to Daffadil. The easie turnes and queyntnesse of the Song, And slight occasion whereupon 'twas rays'd, Not one this jolly company among, (As most could well judge) highly that not prays'd. When Motto next with Perkin pay their debt, The Moreland Mayden Sylvia that espy'd, From th'other Nymphes a little that was set, In a neere Valley by a Rivers side. Whose soveraigne Flowres her sweetnesse well expres'd, And honour'd sight a little them not moved: To whom their Song they reverently addres'd, Both as her loving, both of her beloved. Motto. Tell me, thou skilfull Shepheards Swayne, Who's yonder in the Valley set? Perkin. O, it is shee, whose sweets doe stayne The Lilly, Rose, the Violet. Motto. Why doth the Sunne against his kind, Stay his bright Chariot in the Skies? Perkin. He pawseth, almost strooken blind, With gazing on her heavenly Eyes. Motto. Why doe thy Flocks forbeare their food, Which sometime was their chiefe delight? Perkin. Because they neede no other good, That live in presence of her sight. Motto. How come those Flowres to flourish still, Not withering with sharpe Winters breath? Perkin. Shee hath rob'd Nature of her skill, And comforts all things with her breath. Motto. Why slide these Brookes so slow away, As swift as the wild Roe that were? Perkin. O, muse not Shepheard, that they stay, When they her Heavenly voice doe heare. Motto. From whence come all these goodly Swaynes, And lovely Girles attyr'd in Greene? Perkin. From gathering Garlands on the Playnes, To crowne thy Syl: our Shepheards Queene. Motto. The Sunne that lights this World below, Flocks, Brooks, and Flowres, can witnesse beare. Perkin. These Shepheards, and these Nymphs doe know, Thy Sylvia is as chaste, as faire. Lastly, it came unto the Clownish King, Who, to conclude, this Shepheards yeerely feast, Bound as the rest, his Roundelay to sing, As all the other him were to assist. When shee (whom then, they little did expect, The fayrest Nymph that ever kept in field) Idea, did her sober pace direct Towards them, with joy that every one beheld. And whereas other drave their carefull keepe, Hers did her follow, duely at her will, For, through her patience shee had learnt her Sheepe, Where ere shee went, to wait upon her still. A Milke-white Dove upon her hand shee brought, So tame, 'twould goe, returning at her call, About whose necke was in a Choller wrought, Only like Me, my Mistris hath no Gall. To whom her Swayne (unworthy though he were) Thus unto her his Roundelay applyes, To whom the rest the under part did beare, Casting upon her their still-longing Eyes. Rowland. Of her pure Eyes (that now is seene,) Chorus. Come, let us sing, yee faithfull Swaynes. Rowland. O, shee alone the Shepheards Queene. Chorus. Her Flocke that leades, The Goddesse of these Meades, These Mountaynes and these Playnes. Rowland. Those Eyes of Hers that are more cleere, Chorus. Then can poore Shepheards Songs expresse, Rowland. Then be his Beames that rules the Yeere. Chorus. Fie on that prayse, In striving things to rayse: That doth but make them lesse. Rowland. That doe the Flowry Spring prolong. Chorus. So all things in her sight doe joy, Rowland. And keepes the plenteous Summer young: Chorus. And doe asswage The wrathfull Winters rage, That would our Flocks annoy. Rowland. Jove saw her brest that naked lay, Chorus. A sight most fit for Jove to see: Rowland. And swore it was the Milkie way, Chorus. Of all most pure, The Path (we us assure) To his bright Court to bee. Rowland. He saw her Tresses hanging downe, Chorus. That moved with the gentle Ayre, Rowland. And said that Ariadnes Crowne, Chorus. With those compar'd, The Gods should not regard, Nor Berenices Haire. Rowland. When shee hath watch'd my Flocks by night, Chorus. O happy Flocks that shee did keepe, Rowland. They never needed Cynthia's light, Chorus. That soon gave place, Amazed with her grace, That did attend thy Sheepe. Rowland. Above, where Heavens high glories are, Chorus. When shee is placed in the skies, Rowland. Shee shall be call'd the Shepheards Starre, Chorus. And evermore, We Shepheards will adore Her setting and her rise. THE TENTH EGLOGUE. What time the wearie weather-beaten Sheepe What time the wearie weather-beaten Sheepe, To get them Fodder, hie them to the Fold, And the poore Heards that lately did them keepe, Shuddred with keenenesse of the Winters cold: The Groves of their late Summer pride forlorne, In mossie Mantles sadly seem'd to mourne. That silent time, about the upper World, Phœbus had forc'd his fierie-footed Teame, And downe againe the steepe Olympus whurld, To wash his Chariot in the Westrene streame, In Nights blacke shade, when Rowland all alone, Thus him complaines his fellow Shepheard's gone. You flames, quoth he, wherewith thou Heaven art dight, That me (alive) the wofull'st Creature view, You, whose aspects have wrought me this despight, And me with hate, yet ceaslesly pursue, For whom too long I tarryed for reliefe, Now aske but Death, that onely ends my griefe. Yearly my Vowes, O Heavens, have I not paid, Of the best Fruits, and Firstlings of my Flock? And oftentimes have bitterly invayde, 'Gainst them that you prophanely dar'd to mock? O, who shall ever give what is your due, If mortall man be uprighter then you? If the deepe sighes of an afflicted brest, O'rwhelm'd with sorrow, or th'erected eyes (Of a poore Wretch with miseries opprest) For whose complaints, teares never could suffice, Have not the power your Deities to move, Who shall e'r looke for succour from above? O Night, how still obsequious have I beene To thy slow silence whispering in thine eare, That thy pale Soveraigne often hath beene seene, Stay to behold me sadly from her Spheare, Whilst the slow minutes duly I have told, With watchfull eyes attending on my Fold. How oft by thee the solitary Swayne, Breathing his passion to the early spring, Hath left to heare the Nightingale complaine, Pleasing his thoughts alone, to heare me sing! The Nymphes forsooke their places of abode, To heare the sounds that from my Musicke flow'd. To purge their Springs and sanctifie their Grounds, The simple Shepheards learned I the meane, And Soveraine simples to their use I found, Their teeming Eawes to helpe when they did yeane: Which when againe in summer time they share, Their wealthy Fleece my cunning did declare. In their warme Coates whilst they have soundly slept, And pass'd the Night in many a pleasant Bowre, On the Bleake Mountaines I their Flocks have kept, And bid the Brunt of many a cruell showre, Warring with Beasts in safety mine to keepe; So true was I, and carefull of my Sheepe. Fortune and Time, why tempted you me forth, With those your flattering promises of Grace, Fickle, so falsly to abuse my worth, And now to flie me, whom I did imbrace? Both that at first incourag'd my desire, Lastly against me lewdly doe conspire. Or Nature, didst thou prodigally waste Thy gifts on me infortunatest Swayne, Only thereby to have thy selfe disgrac'd? Vertue in me why was thou plac'd in vaine? If to the World predestined a prey, Thou wert too good to have beene cast away. Ther's not a Grove that wondreth not my wo, Nor not a River weepes not at my tale, I heare the Eccho's (wandring to and fro) Resound my griefe through every Hill and Dale, The Birds and Beasts yet in their simple kinde Lament for me, no pittie else that finde. None else there is gives comfort to my griefe, Nor my mis-haps amended with my mone, When Heaven and Earth have shut up all reliefe, Nor care availes what curelesse now is growne: And teares I finde doe bring no other good, But as new Showres increase the rising Floud. When on an old Tree, under which ere now, He many a merry Roundelay had sung, Upon a leavelesse Canker-eaten Bow, His well-tun'd Bag-pipe carelesly he hung: And by the same, his Sheepe-Hooke, once of price, That had beene carv'd with many a rare device. He call'd his Dog, (that sometime had the prayse) Whitefoote, well knowne to all that kept the Playne, That many a Wolfe had werried in his dayes, A better Curre, there never followed Swayne: Which, though as he his Masters sorrowes knew, Wag'd his cut Taile, his wretched plight to rue. Poore Curre, quoth he, and him therewith did stroke, Goe, to our Cote, and there thy selfe repose, Thou with thine Age, my Heart with sorrow broke: Be gone, ere Death my restlesse Eyes doe close, The Time is come, thou must thy Master leave, Whom the vile World shall never more deceave. With folded Armes thus hanging downe his Head, He gave a grone, his Heart in sunder cleft, And as a Stone, alreadie seemed dead, Before his Breath was fully him bereft: The faithfull Swayne, here lastly made an end, Whom all good Shepheards ever shall defend. FINIS. THE MAN IN THE MOONE. Of all the Tales that ever have beene told, By homely Shepheards lately, or of old, The Mooned Man, although the last in place, Is not the last, And thus befell the case. It was the time when (for their good Estate) The thankefull Shepheards yeerely celebrate A Feast, and Bone-fires on the Vigills keepe, To the Great Pan, preserver of their Sheepe: Which whilst in high solemnity they spend, Lastly the long day grew unto an end: When as by Night with a devout intent, About the Field Religiously they went, Men by sorcerie turning themselves into Wolves.With hollowing Charmes the Warwolfe thence to fray, That them and theirs awayted to betray. And now the Sunne neere halfe his course had run Under the Earth, when comming every one, Backe to the place where usually they met, And on the Ground together being set: It was agreed to passe away the time, That some one Shepheard should rehearse some Rime: Long as they could their drowping hearts to glad, Blame not poore Swaynes, though inly they were sad, For some amongst them perfectly there knew, That the sad tymes were shortly to ensue, When they of all the sorts of men neglected, In barren Fields should wander unrespected. For carefull Shepheards that doe watch by Night, In the vast Ayre see many a fearefull sight: From whose observance they doe wisely gather The change of Times, as well as of the weather. But whilst they strove this Story who should tell, Amongst the rest to Rowlands Lot it fell, By generall voyce, in time that then was growne, So excellent, that scarce there had bin knowne Him that exceld in Piping or in Song: When not a Man the company among That was not silent. Now the goodly Moone Was in the Full, and at her Nighted Noone, Shew'd her great Glory, shining now so bright, Quoth Rowland, Shee that gently lends us light Shall be our Subject, and her Love alone, Borne to a Shepheard, Wise Endimion, Sometime on Latmus that his Flocke did keepe, A Mountayne of Ionia: where Endimion is fayned to have enjoyed the Moone. Rapted that was in admiration deepe Of her perfections, that he us'd to ly, All the long night contemplating the Sky, At her high beauties: often of his store, As to the God he only did adore, And sacrific'd: shee perfect in his love, “For the high Gods inthronized above: “From their cleere Mansions plainly doe behold, “All that frayle man doth in this grosser Mold: For whom bright Cynthia gliding from her Spheare, Used oft times to recreate her there: That oft her want unto the World was strange, Fearing that Heaven the wonted course would change, And Phœbus, her oft missing did inquire, If that elsewhere she borrowed other fire: But let them doe to crosse her what they could, Downe unto Latmus every Month shee would. So that in Heaven about it there was ods, And as a question troubled all the Gods, Whether without their generall consent, She might depart, but nath'lesse, to prevent Her Lawlesse course, they laboured all in vayne, Nor could their Lawes her liberty restraine: For of the Seven, since shee the lowest was, Unto the Earth nought hindred her to passe: Before the rest of which she had the Charge, No lesse her Power was in the Waters large: From her deriving naturally their Source: Besides shee being swiftest in her course, Of all the Planets, therefore him defies, That her, her ancient liberty denies. That many a time apparelled in Greene, Arm'd with her Dart, she Huntresse-like was seene: Her Hayre tuck'd up in many a curious pleate, Sometimes in Fields found feeding of her Neate, A Countrey Mayden, then amongst the Swaynes, A Shepheardesse, she kept upon the Playnes; Yet no disguise her Deity could smother, So farre in beauty she excelled other: Such was the Vertue of the World, that then The Gods did use t'accompany with Men, In Humane Shapes, descending from their Powers, Often were seene in homely Shepheards Bowers. But he her course that studied still to know, Muse not though oft he malcontent did goe, Seldome in one state that her ever found, Pro vario ad solem aspectu varias induit figuras.Horned sometime, now halfe-fac'd, and then round, Shining on that part, then another more, Then there most darkned, where most light before, Now all Night shining, now a piece and then, Observes the Day, and in her course agen, Sometime to South, then Northward she doth stirre, Him so amazing, he supposed her Vayne and inconstant, now herselfe t'attyre, And helpe her beauties with her Brothers fire, When most of all accomplish'd is her face, A sudden darkenesse doth her quite disgrace. For that the earth by nature cold and dry, By the much grosenesse and obscurity, Eclip. Lunæ.Whose Globe exceeds her compasse being fixt, Her Surface and her Brothers Beames betwixt: Within whose shaddow when she haps to fall, Forceth her Darkenesse to be generall; That he resolv'd she ever would be strange: Yet marking well he found upon her change, If that her Brow with bloudy Red were staynd, Tempests soone after, and if blacke, it raind: By his observance that he well discern'd, That from her course things greater might be learn'd. Whilst that his brayne he busied yet doth keepe, Now from the Splene the Melancholy deepe, Pierceth the Veynes, and like a raging Floud, Rudely it selfe extending through the Bloud, Appaulls the spirits denying their defence, The depth of Contemplation. Unto the Organs, when as every sence Ceaseth the Office, then the labouring Minde, Strongest in that which all the Powers doth binde, Strives to high knowledge, being in this plight, Now the Sunnes Sister, Mistris of the Night, His sad desires long languishing to cheare, Thus at the last on Latmus doth appeare, Her Brothers Beames inforc'd to lay aside, Her selfe for his sake seeming to divide. For had she come appareld in her light, The exaltation of the Moone in Taurus, therefore not improperly said to ride upon a Bull. Then should the Swayne have perish'd in her sight. Upon a Bull as white as Milke she rode, Which like a Huntresse bravely shee bestrode, Her Brow with beautie gloriously repleat, Her count'nance lovely with a swelling Teat; Gracing her broad Brest curiously inchaste, With branched Veynes all bared to the Waste. Over the same she ware a Vapour thin, Thorow the which her Cleere and dainty Skin, To the beholder amiably did show, Like Damaske Roses lightly clad in Snow. Her Bow and Quiver at her Backe behinde, That easly mooving with the wanton Winde, Made a soft rustling, such as you doe heare, Amongst the Reedes some gliding River neare, Whence the fierce Boreas thorow them doth Ride, Against whose Rage the hollow Canes doe chide; Which breath, her Mantle amorously did swell, In this supposed Mantle is described the surface of a Sea and Land in Lantskip. From her straight Shoulders carelesly that fell. Now here, now there, now up and downe that flew, Of sundry Coloures, wherein you might view A Sea, that somewhat straitned by the Land, Two furious Tydes raise their ambitious Hand, One 'gainst the other, warring in their Pride, Like two fond Worldlings that themselves devide For some slight Trifle, opposite in all, Till both together ruined, they fall. Some comming in, some out againe doe goe, And the same way, and the same Winde doth blowe, Both Sayles their course each labouring to prefer, By th'Hand of eithers helpefull Marriner: Outragious Tempest, Shipwracks over-spread All the rude Neptune, whilst that pale-fac'd dread Ceaseth the Ship-boy, that his strength doth put The Ancored Cable presently to cut. All above Boord, the sturdy Eolous casts Into the wide Seas, whilst on Planks and Masts Some say to swim: and there you might behold, Whilst the rude Waters enviously did scold, Others upon a Promontory hie, Thrusting his Blue top through the bluer Skie, Looking upon those lost upon the Seas, Like Worldly Rich men that doe sit at ease, Whilst in this vayne World others live in strife, Warring with sorrow every-where so rife: And oft amongst the Monsters of the Maine, Their horrid Foreheads through the Billows straine, Into the vast Aire driving on their Brests, The troubled Water, that so ill disgests Their sway, that it them enviously assailes, Hanging with white Jawes on their Marble Scales; And in another in-land part agen, Were Springs, Lakes, Rivers, Marishes and Fen, Wherein all kinds of Water-fowle did wonne, Each in their colours excellently done, The greedie Sea-maw fishing for the fry, The hungry Shell-fowle, from whose rape doth flye Th'unnumbred sholes, the Mallard there did feed. The Teale and Morecoot raking in the Weed, And in a Creeke where waters least did stirre, Set from the rest the nimble Divedopper, That comes and goes so quickly and so oft, As seemes at once both under and aloft: The jealous Swan, there swimming in his pride, With his arch'd brest the Waters did divide, His saily wings him forward strongly pushing, Against the billowes with such furie rushing, As from the same, a fome so white arose, As seem'd to mocke the brest that them oppose: And here and there the wandring eye to feed, Oft scattered tufts of Bul-rushes and Reed, Segges, long-leav'd Willow, on whose bending spray, The pide Kings-fisher, having got his prey, Sate with the small breath of the water shaken, Till he devour'd the Fish that he had taken. The long-neck'd Herne, there watching by the brimme, And in a Gutter neere againe to him The bidling Snite, the Plover on the Moore, The Curlew, scratching in the Oose and Ore: And there a Fowler set his Lime and ginne, Watching the Birds unto the same to winne; Sees in a Boat a Fisher neere at hand, Tugging his Net full laden to the Land, Keepe off the Fowle, whereat the others bloud Chaf'd; from the place where secretly he stood, Makes signes, and closely beckneth him away, Shaketh his hand, as threatning if he stay, In the same stayned with such naturall grace, That rage was lively pictured in his face: Whilst that the other eagerly that wrought, Having his sence still settled on his draught More than before, beats, plunges, hales the cord, Nor but one looke the other can afford. Buskins she ware, which of the Sea did beare The pale greene colour, which like waved were, To that vast Neptune, of two colours mixt, Yet none could tell the difference was betwixt, With Rockes of Christall lively that were set, Covering whose feet with many a curious fret, Were Groves of Corall, which not feeling weather, Their limber branches were so lap'd together, As one inamour'd had of other beene, Jealous the Ayre t'have intercourse betweene: Amber found in the Ligustick Deepes.'Mongst which, cleere Amber jellyed seem'd to bee, Through whose transparence you might easly see, Pearles bred in shells.The beds of Pearle whereon the Gum did sleepe, Cockles, broad Scallops, and their kind that keepe The precious Seed which of the waters come, Some yet but thriving, when as other some, More then the rest that strangely seeme to swell, With the deare fruit that grew within the shell; Others againe wide open there did yawne, And on the Gravell spew'd their orient spawne: That he became amazed at her sight, Even as a man is troubled at the light Newly awaked, and the white and red, With his eyes twinkling, gathered and fled: Like as a Mirrour to the Sunne oppos'd, Within the margent equally inclos'd, That being moved, as the hand directs, It at one instant taketh and reflects: For the affection by the violent heat, Forming it passion, taketh up the seat In the full heart, whereby the joy or feare, That it receives either by the eye or eare, Still as the object altereth the moode, Either attracts, or forceth forth the bloud: That from the chiefe part violently sent, In either kind thereby is vehement. Whilst the sad Shepheard in this wofull plight Perplex'd, the Goddesse with a longing sight Him now beheld, for worshipped by men: The heavenly powers so likewise love agen To shew themselves and make their glories knowne: And one day marking when he was alone, Unto him comming, mildly him bespake: Quoth she, Know, Shepheard, only for thy sake, I first chose Latmus, as the onely place Of my abode, and have refus'd to grace My Menalus, well knowne in every Coast, To be the Mount that once I loved most: And since alone of wretched mortals, thou Hast laboured first my wandring course to know; To Times succeeding thou alone shalt bee, Endimion first found out the course of the Moone. By whom my motion shall be taught, quoth she, For those first simple that my face did marke, In the full brightnesse suddenly made darke, Ere Knowledge did the cause thereof disclose, To be inchanted long did me suppose: With sounding Brasse and all the while did ply, The incantation thereby to untye. But to our purpose, when my Mother went, The bright Latona (and her wombe distent) Tibul. Elegia 8. Juven. Satyr. 6. Plutar. vi. Æmi. Apollo and Phœbe, fained to bee the Twins of Jupiter, and Latona. Vide Ovidium, l. sexto Metam. &amp; Plin. l. 27. c. 44. With the great burden that by Jove she bare, Me and my Brother, the great Thunderer's care: Whom floting Delos wandring in the Maine, From jealous Juno, hardly could containe: Then much distress'd, and in a hard estate, Cæus' faire Daughter by our Stepdames hate, Betwixt a Lawrell, and an Olive Tree, Into the World did bring the Sunne and mee. When I was borne (as I have heard her say) Nature alone did rest her on that day: In Joves high House the Gods assembled all, To whom he held a sumptuous festivall: The Well wherein my Mother bath'd me first, Hath that high vertue, that he shall not thirst, Thereof that drinkes, and hath the paine appeased Of th'inward griev'd, and outwardly diseased: And being young, the Gods that haunt the Deepe, Stealing to kisse me softly laid to sleepe: And having felt the sweetnesse of my breath, Missing me, mourn'd and languished to death: I am the Rectresse of this Globe below, And with my course the Sea doth ebbe and flow, When from aloft my beames I oblique cast, Straightwayes it ebbes, and floweth then as fast, Downward againe my motion when I make: Secundum motum diurnum singulis diebus bis fluens, bis refluens.Twice doth it swell, twice every day doth slake, Sooner or latter shifting of the tyde As farre or neere my wandring course doth guide. That kindly moysture that doth life maintayne, In every Creature prooves how I doe raigne In fluxive humour, which is ever found, As I doe wane, or wax up to my round; Those fruitfull Trees of Victorie and Peace, The Palme, and Olive, still with my increase Shoote forth new branches: and to tell my power, As my great Brother, so have I a Selenetropium, the Flowre of the Moone. Flowre To me peculiar, that doth ope and close, When as I rise, and when I me repose. No lesse then these that greene and living be, The precious Gemmes doe sympathize with me: As most that The Selenite of ??????. stone that doth the name derive From me, with me that lesseneth or doth thrive, Darkneth and shineth, as I doe, her Queene. And as in these, in beasts my power is seene. As he whose grimme face all the lesser feares, The cruell Panther, on his shoulder beares A spot, that dayly changeth as I doo, And as that creature me affecteth too, It whose deepe craft scarce any creature can, Seeming in reason to devide with man, The nimble Cinocephalus, the Babion, or Baboon. Babion mourning all the time, Nor eats betwixt my waning and my prime. The spotted Cat, whose sharpe and subtill sight Pierceth the vapour of the blackest night, My want and fulnesse in her eye doth find, So great am I and powerfull in that kind. As those great burgers of the forrest wild, The Hart, the Goate, and Adonis slaine by a Bore. he that slew the child Of wanton Mirrah, in their strength doe know The due observance nature doth me owe. And if thou thinke me heavenly not to bee, That in my face thou often seem'st to see, A palenesse, where those other in the skie Appeare so purely glorious in thine eye: Those freckles thou supposest me disgrace, Are those pure parts that in my lovely face, By their so much tenuity doe slight, My Brothers Beames assisting me with light, Partes Lunæ rariores &amp; proinde minus lucidæ. And keepe that cleerenesse as doth me behove, Of that pure Heaven me set wherein to move. My least spot seene unto the Earth so neare, Wherefore that compasse that doth oft appeare The cause of that circle which the Philosophers call Halo, which we oft see about the Moone. About my Body, is the dampy Mist, From earth arising, striving to resist The Rayes my full Orbe plentiously projects, On the grosse Cloud, whose thicknesse it reflects, And mine owne light about my selfe doth fling In equall parts, in fashion of a Ring; For neer'st to Mortals though my state I keepe, Yet not the colour of the troubled Deepe, Those spots supposed, nor the Fogs that rise From the dull Earth, me any whit agrize; Whose perfect beauty no way can indure, But what like me is excellently pure; For moyst and cold although I doe respire, Luna lumen habet congenitum. Yet in my selfe had I not Genuine Fire, When the grosse Earth devided hath the space, Betwixt the full Orbe and my Brothers Face; Though I confesse much lessned be my light, I should be taken utterly from sight, And for I so irregularly goe, Therein wise nature most of all doth show Her searchlesse judgement: for did I in all, Keepe on in that way, which Star-gazers call The Lyne Ecliptick, as my glorious Brother The Line supposed to devide the Zodiake. Doth in his course, one opposite to other; Twise every Month, the Eclipses of our light, Poore Mortals should prodigiously affright; Yet by proportion certainely I move, In rule of Number, and the most I love, That which you call Full, that most perfect seven, Of three and foure made, which for odde and even, Numerus impar mas par fœmina.Are Male and Female, which by mixture frame, It most Mysterious, that as mine I clayme; Quartered thereby, first of which Seven my Prime, The second Seven accomplisheth the time Unto my Fulnesse, in the third I range, Lesning againe, the fourth then to my change: The moneth the Yeere of the Moone.The which foure Sevens the Eight and Twenty make, Through the bright Girdle of the Zodiake, The foure quarters of the moneth, resemble the foure Seasons of the Yeere, Macro.In which I passe; whose Quarters doe appeare, As the Foure Seasons of my Brothers Yeere. First in my Birth am moystned as his Spring, Hot as his Summer, he illumining My Orbe, the Second: my Third Quarter Dry, As is his Autumne, when from him I flye, Depriv'd his bright Beames, and as waxing old, Lastly, my Wane is as his Winter Cold. Whereat shee paus'd; who all the while she spake, The bustling Winds their murmur often brake; And being silent seemed yet to stay, To listen if she ought had else to say. When now the while much troubled was his thought, And her fayre speech so craftily had caught Him, that the Spirits soone shaking off the loade Of the grosse Flesh, and hating her abode; Being throughly heated in these amorous Fires, Wholly transported with the deare desires Of her imbraces: for the living soule, Being individuall, uniforme and whole, By her unwearied faculties doth find, That which the flesh of duller Earth by kind, Not apprehends, and by her function makes Good her owne state; Endimion now forsakes All the delights that Shepheards doe preferre, And sets his minde so gen'rally on her, That all neglected to the Groves and Springs, He followes Phœbe, that him safely brings (As their great Queene) unto the nymphish Bowres, Wherein cleere Rivers beautified with Flowres, The silver Naydes bathe them in the bracke. The Nymphes of the Waters. Sometime with her the Sea-horse he doth backe, Nymphes of the Sea. Amongst the blue Nereides, and when Nymphes of the Mountaynes. Wearie of waters, Goddesse like agen, She the high Mountaynes actively assayes, Nymphes of the Woods. And there amongst the light Oriades, That ride the swift Roes, Phœbe doth resort, Sometime amongst those that with them comport, The Hamadriades doth the Woods frequent, And there she stayes not; but incontinent, Calls downe the Dragons that her Chariot draw, And with Endimion pleased that she saw, Mounteth thereon, in twinkling of an eye, Stripping the winds, beholding from the Skye, The Earth in roundnesse of a perfect Ball, Which as a point but of this mightie All, Wise Nature fix'd, that permanent doth stay, Whereas the Spheares by a diurnall sway, Of the first Moover carryed are about. And how the severall Elements throughout, Strongly infolded, and the vast Ayre spred In sundry Regions, in the which are bred Those strange Impressions often that appeare To fearefull Mortalls, and the causes there, And lightned by her piercing beames, he sees The powerfull Planets, how in their degrees, In their due seasons they doe fall and rise: And how the Signes in their Triplicities, The Signes in their triplicities, simpathize with the Elements. Be simpathizing in their Trine consents, With whose inferiour forming Elements, From which our bodies the complexions take, Natures and number: strongly and doe make Our dispositions like them, and on Earth The Power, the Heavens have over mortall Birth: That their effects which men call Fortune, are As is that good or in-auspicious Starre, Which at the fraile Nativitie doth raigne. Yet here her Love could Phœbe not containe, And knowledge him so strongly doth inspire, That in most plentie, more he doth desire; Raysing him up to those excelling sights, The glorious Heaven, where all the fixed lights, Whose Images suppos'd to be therein, Are fram'd of Starres, whose names did first begin By those wise Ancients, not to stellifie The first Worlds Heroes only, but imply To reach their courses, for distinguished In Constellations, a delight first bred In slothfull Man, into the same to looke, That from those Figures nomination tooke, Which they resembled here on Earth below, And the bright Phœbe subtilly doth know, The heavenly Motions high her Orbe above, As well as those that under her doe move. For with long Titles doe we her invest, So these great three most powerfull of the rest, Phœbe, Diana, Hecate, doe tell, Her Soveraigntie in Heaven, in Earth and Hell, And wise Apollo, that doth franckly lend Her his pure beames, with them doth likewise send His wondrous knowledge, for that God most bright, Sol, fons lucis.King of the Planets, Fountaine of the Light: That seeth all things, will have her to see, Nine the most holy number.So farre as where the sacred Angels bee. The nine Orders of the Angels.Those Hierarchies that Joves great will supply, Whose Orders formed in triplicitie, Holding their places by the treble Trine, Make up that holy Theologike nine: Thrones, Cherubin, and Seraphin that rise, As the first three; when Principalities, With Dominations, Potestates are plac'd The second: and the Ephionian last, Which Vertues, Angels, and Archangels bee. Thus yonder Man that in the Moone you see, Rapt up from Latmus, thus she doth preferre, And goes about continually with her: Over the World that every moneth doth looke, And in the same there's scarce that secret nooke, That he survayes not, and the places hidden, Whence simple Truth and Candle light forbidden, Dare not approch: he peepeth with his light, Whereas suspicious policie by night, Consults with Murther, basenesse at their hand, Armed to act what ever they command: With guiltie conscience and intent so foule, That oft they start at whooping of an Owle, And slily peering at a little pore, See one sometimes content to keepe the doore: One would not thinke the Bawd that did not know, Such a brave bodie could descend so low. And the base Churle, the Sunne that dare not trust, With his old Gold, yet smelling it doth rust, Layes it abroad, but lockes himselfe within Three doubled lockes, or ere he dare begin To ope his Bags, and being sure of all; Else, yet therewith dare scarcely trust the wall: And with a Candle in a filthy stick, The grease not fully covering the wick; (Pores o'r his base God) forth a flame that fryes, Almost as dimme as his foule bleared eyes: Yet like to a great Murtherer, that gave Some slight reward unto some bloudie Knave, To kill: the second secretly doth slay, Fearing lest he the former should betray: He the poore Candle murth'reth ere burnt out, Because that he the secresie doth doubt; And oftentimes the Mooned Man out-spyes, The Eve-dropper, and circumspectly eyes The Thiefe and Lover, specially which two, With Night and Darknesse have the most to doe. And not long since, besides this, did behold Some of you here, when you should tend your Fold, A Nights were wenching: thus he me doth tell. With that, they all in such a laughter fell, That the Field rang, when from a Village neere, The watchfull Cocke crew, and with Notes full cleere, The early Larke soone summoned the Day, When they departed every one their way.

To you those Noblest of Gentlemen, of these Renowned Kingdomes of Great Britaine: who in these declining times, have yet in your brave bosomes the sparkes of that sprightly fire, of your couragious Ancestors; and to this houre retaine the seedes of their magnanimitie and Greatnesse, who out of the vertue of your mindes, love and cherish neglected Poesie, the delight of Blessed soules, &amp; the language of Angels. To you are these my Poems dedicated, By your truly affectioned Servant, Michaell Drayton. THE VISION OF BEN. JONSON, ON THE MUSES OF HIS FRIEND M. DRAYTON. It hath beene question'd, Michael, if I bee A Friend at all; or, if at all, to thee: Because, who make the question, have not seene Those ambling visits, passe in verse, betweene Thy Muse, and mine, as they expect. 'Tis true: You have not writ to me, nor I to you; And, though I now begin, 'tis not to rub Hanch against Hanch, or raise a riming Club About the towne: this reck'ning I will pay, Without conferring symboles. This's my day. It was no Dreame! I was awake, and saw! Lend me thy voyce, O Fame, that I may draw Wonder to truth! and have my Vision hoorld, Hot from thy trumpet, round, about the world. I saw a Beauty from the Sea to rise, That all Earth look'd on; and that earth, all Eyes! It cast a beame as when the chear-full Sun Is fayre got up, and day some houres begun! And fill'd an Orbe as circular, as heaven! The Orbe was cut forth into Regions seaven. And those so sweet, and well proportion'd parts, As it had beene the circle of the Arts! When, by thy bright Ideas standing by, I found it pure, and perfect Poësy, There read I, streight, thy learned Legends three, Heard the soft ayres, between our Swaynes &amp; thee, Which made me thinke, the old Theocritus, Or Rurall Virgil come, to pipe to us! But then, thy'epistolar Heroick Songs, Their loves, their quarrels, jealousies, and wrongs, Did all so strike me, as I cry'd, who can With us be call'd, the Naso, but this man? And looking up, I saw Minervas fowle, Pearch'd over head, the wise Athenian Owle: I thought thee then our Orpheus, that wouldst try Like him, to make the ayre, one volary: And I had stil'd thee, Orpheus, but before My lippes could forme the voyce, I heard that Rore, And Rouze, the Marching of a mighty force, Drums against Drums, the neighing of the Horse, The Fights, the Cryes, and wondring at the Jarres I saw, and read, it was thy Barons Warres! O, how in those, dost thou instruct these times, That Rebells actions, are but valiant crimes! And caried, though with shoute, and noyse, confesse A wild, and an authoriz'd wickednesse! Sayst thou so, Lucan? But thou scornst to stay Under one title. Thou hast made thy way And flight about the Ile, well neare, by this, In thy admired Periégesis, Or universall circumduction Of all that reade thy Poly-Olbyon. That reade it? that are ravish'd! such was I With every song, I sweare, and so would dye: But that I heare, againe, thy Drum to beate A better cause, and strike the bravest heate That ever yet did fire the English blood! Our right in France! if ritely understood. There, thou art Homer! Pray thee, use the stile Thou hast deserv'd: And let me reade the while Thy Catalogue of Ships, exceeding his, Thy list of aydes, and force, for so it is: The Poets act! and for his Country's sake Brave are the Musters, that the Muse will make. And when he ships them where to use their Armes, How do his trumpets breath! What loud alarmes! Looke, how we read the Spartans were inflam'd With bold Tyrtæus verse, when thou art nam'd, So shall our English Youth urge on, and cry An Agincourt, an Agincourt, or dye. This booke! it is a Catechisme to fight, And will be bought of every Lord, and Knight, That can but reade; who cannot, may in prose Get broken peeces, and fight well by those. The miseries of Margaret the Queene Of tender eyes will more be wept, then seene: I feele it by mine owne, that over flow, And stop my sight, in every line I goe. But then refreshed, with thy Fayerie Court, I looke on Cynthia, and Sirenas sport, As, on two flowry Carpets, that did rise, And with their grassie greene restor'd mine eyes. Yet give mee leave, to wonder at the birth Of thy strange Moon-Calfe, both thy straine of mirth, And Gossip-got acquaintance, as, to us Thou hadst brought Lapland, or old Cobalus, Empusa, Lamia, or some Monster, more Then Affricke knew, or the full Grecian store! I gratulate it to thee, and thy Ends, To all thy vertuous, and well chosen Friends, Onely my losse is, that I am not there: And, till I worthy am to wish I were, I call the world, that envies mee, to see If I can be a Friend, and Friend to thee. UPON THE BATTAILE OF AGINCOURT, Written by His Deare Friend MICHAELL DRAYTON Esquire. Had Henryes name beene onely met in Prose, Recorded by the humble wit of those, Who write of lesse then Kings; who victory, As calmely mention, as a Pedigree, The French, alike with us, might view his name His actions too, and not confesse a shame: Nay, grow at length, so boldly troublesome, As, to dispute if they were overcome. But thou hast wakte their feares: thy fiercer hand Hath made their shame as lasting, as their land. By thee againe they are compeld to knowe How much of Fate is in an English foe. They bleede afresh by thee, and thinke the harme Such; they could rather wish, t'were Henryes arme: Who thankes thy painfull quill; and holds it more To be thy Subject now, then King before. By thee he conquers yet; when ev'ry word Yeelds him a fuller honour, then his sword. Strengthens his action against time: by thee, Hee victory, and France, doth hold in fee. So well observ'd he is, that ev'ry thing Speakes him not onely English, but a King. And France, in this, may boast her fortunate That shee was worthy of so brave a hate. Her suffring is her gayne. How well we see The Battaile labourd worthy him, and thee, Where, wee may Death discover with delight, And entertaine a pleasure from a fight. Where wee may see how well it doth become The brav'ry of a Prince to overcome. What Power is a Poet: that can add A life to Kings, more glorious, then they had. For what of Henry, is unsung by thee, Henry doth want of his Eternity. J. Vaughan. TO MY WORTHY FRIEND MR. MICHAELL DRAYTON upon these his Poems. SONNET. What lofty Trophyes of eternall Fame, England may vaunt thou do'st erect to her, Yet forced to confesse, (yea blush for shame,) That she no Honour doth on thee confer. How it would become her, would she learne to knowe Once to requite thy Heaven-borne Art and Zeale, Or at the least her selfe but thankfull showe Her ancient Glories that do'st still reveale: Sing thou of Love, thy straines (like powerfull Charmes) Enrage the bosome with an amorous fire, And when againe thou lik'st to sing of Armes The Coward thou with Courage do'st inspire: But when thou com'st to touch our Sinfull Times, Then Heaven far more then Earth speakes in thy Rimes. John Reynolds. THE BATTAILE OF AGINCOURT. Ceas'd was the Thunder, of those Drummes which wak'd, Th'affrighted French their miseries to view, At Edwards name, which to that houre still quak'd, Their The law Salique was, that women should not inherite; which law, Edward the third, by his right to the Crowne by his mother, cancelled with his sword: for so much as at that time made way to his clayme, though in France that law bee inviolable. Salique Tables to the ground that threw, Yet were the English courages not slak'd, But the same Bowes, and the same Blades they drew, With the same Armes, those weapons to advance, Which lately lopt the Flower de liz of France. Henry the fift, that man made out of fire, Th'Imperiall Wreath plac'd on his Princely browe; His Lyons courage stands not to enquire Which way olde Henry came by it; or howe At Pomfret Castell Richard should expire: What's that to him? he hath the Garland now; Let Henry the 4. so named of a Town in Lincolne Shiere, where he was borne. Bullingbrook beware how he it wan, For Henry the fift borne at Munmouth in Wales. Dowglas in that battaile slew three in the Kings coat Armour. Munmouth meanes to keepe it, if he can. That glorious day, which his great Father got, Upon the Percyes; calling to their ayde The valiant Dowglas, that Herculian Scot, When for his Crowne at Shrewsbury they playde, Had quite dishartned ev'ry other plot, And all those Tempests quietly had layde, That not a cloud did to this Prince appeare, No former King had seene a skye so cleere. Yet the rich Clergy felt a fearefull Rent, In the full Bosome of their Church (whilst she A Monarchesse, immeasurably spent, Lesse then she was, and thought she might not be:) By Wickclif and his followers; to prevent Wickliffe a learned Divine, and the greatest Protestant of those times. The growth of whose opinions, and to free That foule Aspersion, which on her they layde, She her strongst witts must stirre up to her ayde. When presently a Parliament is calld To sett things steddy, that stood not so right, But that thereby the poore might be inthral'd, Should they be urg'd by those that were of might, That in his Empire, equitie enstauld, It should continue in that perfect plight; A Parliament at Leicester.Wherefore to Lester, he th'Assembly drawes, There to Inact those necessary Lawes. In which one Bill (mongst many) there was red, Against the generall, and superfluous waste Of temporall Lands, (the Laity that had fed) Upon the Houses of Religion caste, Which for defence might stand the Realme in sted, Where it most needed were it rightly plac't; Which made those Church-men generally to feare, For all this calme, some tempest might be neare. And being right skilfull, quickly they forsawe, No shallow braines this bus'nesse went about: Therefore with cunning they must cure this flawe; For of the King they greatly stood in doubt, Lest him to them, their opposites should drawe, Some thing must be thrust in, to thrust that out: And to this end they wisely must provide, One, this great Engine, Clearkly that could guide. Henry Chichley succeeding Arundell (late deceased) in that See. Chichley, that sate on Canterburies See, A man well spoken, gravely stout, and wise, The most select, (then thought of that could be,) To act what all the Prelacie divise; (For well they knew, that in this bus'nesse, he Would to the utmost straine his faculties;) Him lift they up, with their maine strength, to prove By some cleane slight this So they termed it as not worthy of a better tytle. Lybell to remove. His braine in labour, gladly foorth would bring Somewhat, that at this needfull time might fit, The sprightly humor of this youthfull King, If his invention could but light of it; His working soule projecteth many a thing, Untill at length out of the strength of wit, He found a warre with France, must be the way To dash this Bill, else threatning their decay. Whilst vacant mindes sate in their breasts at ease, And the remembrance of their Conquests past, Upon their fansies doth so strongly sease, As in their teeth, their Cowardise it cast Rehearsing to them those victorious daies, The deeds of which, beyond their names should last, That after ages, reading what was theirs, Shall hardly thinke, those men had any Heires. And to this point, premeditating well, A speech, (which chanc'd, the very pinne to cleave) Aym'd, whatsoever the successe befell That it no roomth should for a second leave, More of this Title then in hand to tell, If so his skill him did not much deceave, And gainst the King in publike should appeare; Thus frames his speech to the Assembly there. Pardon my boldnesse, my Liedge Soveraigne Lord, The Archbishop of Canterburies Oration, to the King &amp; Parliament at Lecester, in the Eleven following Stanzas. Nor your Dread presence let my speech offend, Your milde attention, favourably affoord, Which, such cleere vigour to my spirit shall lend, That it shall set an edge upon your Sword, To my demand, and make you to attend, Asking you, why, men train'd to Armes you keepe, Your right in France yet suffering still to sleepe. Can such a Prince be in an Iland pent, And poorely thus shutt up within a Sea. When as your right includes that large extent, To th'either Alpes your Empire forth to lay, Can he be English borne, and is not bent To follow you, appoint you but the way, Weele wade if we want ships, the waves or climme, In one hand hold our swords, with th'other swim. What time controules, your brave great Grandsires claim, The Crowne of France descended upon Edward the third, from Isabell his Mother, Daughter and surviving heyre, to King Phillippe of France named the fayre. To th'Realme of France, from Philip nam'd the faire, Which to King Edward by his mother came, Queene Isabel; that Philips onely heire, Which this short intermission doth not maime, But if it did, as he, so yours repaire; That where his Right in bloud prevailed not, In spight of hell, yet by his Sword he got. What set that Conqueror, by their Salique Lawes, Those poore decrees their Parliaments could make, He entred on the justnesse of his Cause, To make good, what he dar'd to undertake, And once in Action, he stood not to pause, But in upon them like a Tempest brake, And downe their buildings with such fury bare, That they from mists dissolved were to ayre. As those brave Edwards, Father, and the Sonne, At Conquer'd Cressy, with successefull lucke, Where first all France (as at one game) they wonne, Never two Warriours, such a Battaile strucke, That when the bloudy dismall fight was done, Here in one heape, there in another Rucke Princes and Peasants lay together mixt, The English Swords, no difference knew betwixt. There Lewes King of Beame was overthrowne, With valient Charles, of France the younger Brother, James, Daulphine of Viennoies. The Dukes of Lorraine, and Burbon. The Earles of Aumerle, Savoye, Mount-billiard, Flaunders, Nevers &amp; Harecourt.A Daulphine, and two Dukes, in pieces hewen; To them sixe Earles lay slaine by one another; There the grand Prior of France, fetcht his last groane, Two Archbishops the boystrous Croud doth smother, There fifteene thousand of their Gentrie dy'de With each two Souldiers, slaughtered by his side. King John of France and Philip his Son taken by the Blacke Prince at the Battaile of Poyteers, brought Prisoners to England.Nor the Blacke Prince, at Poyteers battaile fought; Short of his Father, and himselfe before, Her King and Prince, that prisoners hither brought From forty thousand weltring in their gore, That in the Worlds opinion it was thought, France from that instant could subsist no more, The John of Clermount. Marshall, and the Peter of Burbon. Constable, there slaine Under the Standard, in that Battaile ta'ne. Examples of such as have advanc'd themselves to the Crowne of France, against the strict letter of the lawe Salique, in the two following Stanzaes.Nor is this clayme for women to succeede, (Gainst which they would your right to France debarre) A thing so new, that it so much should neede Such opposition, as though fetcht from farre, By Pepin this is prov'd, as by a deede, Deposing Cheldrick, by a fatall warre, By Blythild dar'd his title to advance, Daughter to Clothar, first so nam'd of France. Hugh Capet, who from Charles of Lorayne tooke The Crowne of France, that he in peace might raigne, As heire to Lingard to her title stooke, Who was the daughter of King Charlemaine, So holy Lewes poring on his booke, Whom that Hugh Capet made his heire againe, From Ermingard his Grandame, claim'd the Crowne, Duke Charles his daughter, wrongfully put downe. Nor thinke my Leege a fitter time then this, You could have found your Title to advance, At the full height when now the faction is, T'wixt Burgoyne, and the house of Orleance, Your purpose you not possibly can misse, It for my Lord so luckily doth chance, That whilst these two in opposition stand, You may have time, your Army there to land. And if my fancy doe not overpresse, My visuall sence, me thinkes in every eye I see such cheere, as of our good successe In France hereafter seemes to Prophecie; Thinke not my Soveraigne, my Alegeance lesse Quoth he; my Lords nor doe you misaply My words: thus long upon this subject spent, Who humbly here submit to your assent. This speech of his, that powerfull Engine prov'd, Then e'r our Fathers got, which rais'd us hier, The Clergies feare that quietly remov'd, And into France transferd our Hostile fier, It made the English through the world belov'd, That durst to those so mighty things aspire, And gave so cleere a luster to our fame, That neighbouring Nations trembled at our name. When through the house, this rumor scarsely ran, That warre with France propounded was againe, In all th'Assembly there was not a man, But put the project on with might and maine, So great applause it generally wan, That else no bus'nesse they would entertaine, As though their honour utterly were lost, If this designe should any way be crost. So much mens mindes, now upon France were set That every one doth with himselfe forecast, What might fall out this enterprize to let, As what againe might give it wings of hast, And for they knew, the French did still abet The Scot against us, (which we usde to tast) It question'd was if it were fit or no, To Conquer them, ere we to France should goe. Ralph Nevill then Warden of the Marches betwixt England and Scotland. An old adage, He that will France winne: must with Scotland first beginne.Which Ralph then Earle of Westmorland propos'd, Quoth he, with Scotland let us first begin, By which we are upon the North inclos'd, And lockt with us, one Continent within, Then first let Scotland be by us dispos'd, And with more ease, yee spatious France may winne, Else of our selves, ere we our Ships can cleere, To land in France; they will invade us here. The Duke of Excester the Kings owne unckle.Not so brave Nevill, Excester replies, For that of one two labours were to make, For Scotland wholly upon France relies; First, Conquer France, and Scotland yee may take, Tis the French pay, the Scot to them that tyes, That stopt, asunder quickly yee shall shake The French and Scots; to France then first say I, First, first, to France, then all the Commons cry. The first breach with France.And instantly an Embassy is sent, To Charles of France, to will him to restore Those Territories, of whose large extent, The English Kings were owners of before; Which if he did not, and incontinent, The King would set those English on his shore, That in despight of him, and all his might, Should leave their lives there, or redeeme his right. First Normandy, in his demand he makes, With Aquitane, a Dutchy no lesse great, The Countries demanded by the King of England. Anjou, and Mayne, with Gascoyne which he takes, Cleerely his owne, as any English seat: With these proud France, he first of all awakes, For their delivery, giving power to treat; For well he knew, if Charles should these restore, No King of France was ever left so poore. The King, and Daulphin, to his proud demand, That he might see they no such matter ment, As a thing fitter for his youthfull hand; A Tunne of Paris Tennis Balls him sent, The King and Daulphine of France, deriding the King of England. Better himselfe to make him understand, Deriding his ridiculous intent: And that was all the answere he could get, Which more, the King doth to this Conquest whet. That answering the Ambassadour, quoth he, Thanks for my Balls, to Charles your Soveraigne give, Henry the fift answered for the Tennis Balls. And thus assure him, and his sonne from me, I'le send him Balls and Rackets if I live, That they such Racket shall in Paris see, When over lyne with Bandies I shall drive, The language of Tennis. As that before the Set be fully done, France may (perhaps) into the Hazard runne. So little doth luxurious France fore-see By her disdaine, what shee upon her drew: In her most bravery seeming then to be, The punishment that shortly should ensue, Which so incenst the English King, that he For full revenge into that fury grew: That those three horrors, Famine, Sword, and Fire, Could not suffice to satisfie his ire. In all mens mouthes now was no word but warre, As though no thing had any other name; And folke would aske of them ariv'd from farre, What forces were preparing whence they came? 'Gainst any bus'nesse 'twas a lawfull barre To say for France they were; and 'twas a shame For any man to take in hand to doe Ought, but some thing that did belong thereto. Olde Armours are drest up, and new are made; Jacks are in working, and strong shirts of Male, He scowers an Blades accounted of the best temper. olde Fox, he a Blades accounted of the best temper. Bilbowe blade, Now Shields and Targets onely are for sale; Who works for warre, now thriveth by his Trade, The browne Bill, and the Battell-Axe prevaile: The curious Fletcher fits his well-strung Bowe, And his barb'd Arrow which he sets to showe. Tents and Pavillions in the fields are pitcht, (E'r full wrought up their Roomthynesse to try) Windowes, and Towers, with Ensignes are inricht, With ruffling Banners, that doe brave the sky, Wherewith the wearied Labourer bewitcht To see them thus hang waving in his eye: His toylsome burthen from his back doth throwe, And bids them worke that will, to France hee'll goe. Rich Saddles for the Light-horse and the Bard For to be brav'st there's not a man but plyes, Plumes, Bandroules, and Caparizons prepar'd; Whether of two, and men at Armes divise The Armed at all points. Greaves, or Armings for the thigh and legge. Guyses were the surer guard, The Armings for the arme and shoulder. Vambrasse, or the Pouldron, they should prize; And where a stand of Pykes plac't close, or large, Which way to take advantage in the Charge. One traynes his Horse, another trayles his Pyke, He with his Pole-Axe, practiseth the fight, The Bowe-man (which no Country hath the like) With his sheafe Arrow, proveth by his might, How many score off, he his Foe can strike, Yet not to draw above his bosomes hight: The Trumpets sound the Charge and the Retreat, The bellowing Drumme, the Martch againe doth beat. Cannons upon their Caridge mounted are, Whose Battery France must feele upon her Walls, The Engineer providing the Petar, To breake the strong Percullice, and the Balls Of Wild-fire devis'd to throw from farre, Great Ordnance then but newly in use.To burne to ground their Pallaces and Halls: Some studying are, the scale which they had got, Thereby to take the Levell of their Shot. The man in yeares preacht to his youthfull sonne Prest to this Warre, as they sate by the fire, What deedes in France were by his Father done, To this attempt to worke him to aspire, And told him, there how he an Ensigne wonne, Which many a yeare was hung up in the Quire: And in the Battell, where he made his way, How many French men he struck downe that day. The good old man, with teares of joy would tell, In Cressy field what prizes Edward play'd, As what at Poycteers the Black Prince befell, How like a Lyon, he about him layd: In deedes of Armes how Awdley did excell, For their olde sinnes, how they the French men payd: How bravely Basset did behave him there: How Oxford charg'd the Van, Warwick the Reare. And Boy, quoth he, I have heard thy Grandsire say, That once he did an English Archer see, Who shooting at a French twelve score away, Quite through the body, stuck him to a Tree; Upon their strengths a King his Crowne might lay: Such were the men of that brave age, quoth he, When with his Axe he at his Foe let drive, Murrian and scalpe downe to the teeth could rive: The scarlet Judge might now set up his Mule, With neighing Steeds the Streetes so pestred are; For where he wont in Westminster to rule, On his Tribunall sate the man of Warre, The Lawyer to his Chamber doth recule, For he hath now no bus'nesse at the Barre: But to make Wills and Testaments for those That were for France, their substance to dispose. By this, the Counsell of this Warre had met, And had at large of ev'ry thing discust; And the grave Clergie had with them beene set: To warrant what they undertooke was just, And as for monies that to be no let, They bad the King for that to them to trust: The Church to pawne, would see her Challice layde, E'r shee would leave one Pyoner unpayde. From Milford Haven, to the mouth of Tweed, Halfe the circuit of the Island, from the Spanish to the German Ocean. Ships of all burthen to Southampton brought, For there the King the Rendevous decreed To beare aboard his most victorious fraught: The place from whence he with the greatest speed Might land in France, (of any that was thought) And with successe upon that lucky shore, Edward the third. Where his great Grandsire landed had before. But, for he found those vessels were to fewe, That into France his Army should convay: He sent to Belgia, whose great store he knewe, Might now at neede supply him every way. His bounty ample, as the windes that blewe, Such Barkes for Portage out of ev'ry bay In Holland, Zealand, and in Flanders, brings; As spred the wide The Sea betwixt France and England, so called. sleeve with their canvase wings. But first seaven Ships from Rochester are sent, The narrow Seas, of all the French to sweepe: A Catalogue of the Ships in 12 Stanzas.All men of Warre with scripts of Mart that went, And had command, the Coast of France to keepe: The comming of a Navie to prevent, And view what strength, was in the Bay of Deepe: And if they found it like to come abroad, To doe their best to fire it in the Road. The names of the Kings 7. Ships of War.The Bonaventure, George, and the Expence, Three as tall Ships, as e'r did Cable tewe, The Henry Royall, at her parting thence, An Indian Bird so great, that she is able to carry an Elephant.Like the huge Ruck from Gillingham that flewe: The Antilop, the Elephant, Defence, Bottoms as good as ever spred a clue: All having charge, their voyage having bin, Before Southampton to take Souldiers in. Twelve Merchants Ships, of mighty burthen all, New off the Stocks, that had beene rig'd for Stoad, Riding in Thames by Lymehouse and Blackwall That ready were their Merchandize to load, Straitly commanded by the Admirall, At the same Port to settle their aboad: And each of these a Pinnis at command, To put her fraught conveniently to land. Eight goodly Ships, so Bristow ready made, Which to the King they bountifully lent, With Spanish Wines which they for Ballast lade, In happy speed of his brave Voyage ment, Hoping his Conquest should enlarge their Trade, And there-withall a rich and spacious Tent: And as this Fleet the Severne Seas doth stem, Five more from Padstowe came along with them. The Hare of Loo, a right good Ship well knowne, The yeare before that twice the Strayts had past, Two wealthy Spanish Merchants did her owne, Who then but lately had repair'd her wast; For from her Deck a Pyrate she had blowne, After a long Fight, and him tooke at last: And from Mounts Bay sixe more, that still in sight, Wayted with her before the Ile of Wight. From Plymmouth next came in the Blazing Starre, And fiery Dragon to take in their fraught; With other foure, especiall men of Warre, That in the Bay of Portugall had fought; The Bay of Portugall one of the highest working Seas that is known. And though returning from a Voyage farre, Stem'd that rough Sea, when at the high'st it wrought: With these, of Dertmouth seav'n good Ships there were, The golden Cressant in their tops that beare. So Lyme, three Ships into the Navy sent, Of which the Sampson scarse a mon'th before, Had sprung a Planke, and her mayne Mast had spent, With extreame perill that she got to shore; With them five other out of Waymouth went, Which by Southampton, were made up a score: With those that rode (at pleasure) in the Bay, And that at Anchor before Portsmouth lay. Next these, Newcastle furnisheth the Fleet With nine good Hoyes of necessary use; The Danish Pyrats, valiantly that beet, Offring to Sack them as they sayl'd for Sluce: Six Hulks from Hull at Humbers mouth them meet, Which had them oft accompanied to A Country lying upon the east Sea, bordring upon Poland. Pruce. Five more from Famous for Herring fishing. Yarmouth falling them among, That had for Fishing beene prepared long. The Cowe of Harwich, never put to flight, For Hides, and Furres, late to Muscovia bound, Of the same Port, another nam'd the Spight, That in her comming lately through the Sound, After a two-dayes-still-continued fight, Had made three Flemings runne themselves a ground; With three neat Flee-boats which with them doe take, Six Ships of Sandwich up the Fleet to make. Nine Ships for the Nobility there went, Of able men, the enterprize to ayde, Aydes to the King by the Nobility.Which to the King most liberally they lent, At their owne charge, and bountifully payde, Northumberland, and Westmerland in sent Fourescore at Armes a peece, themselves and layde At six score Archers each, as Suffolke showes, Twenty tall men at Armes, with forty Bowes. Warwick and Stafford leavied at no lesse Then noble Suffolke, nor doe offer more Of men at Armes, and Archers which they presse, Of their owne Tenants, Arm'd with their owne store: Their forwardnesse fore-showes their good successe In such a Warre, as had not beene before: And other Barrons under Earles that were, Yet dar'd with them an equall charge to beare. Darcy and Camois, zealous for the King, Lovell, Fitzwater, Willoughby, and Rosse, Berckley, Powis, Burrell, fast together cling; Seymer, and Saint John for the bus'nesse closse, Each twenty Horse, and forty foote doe bring More, to nine hundred mounting in the grosse In those nine Ships, and fitly them bestow'd, Which with the other fall into the Road. From Holland, Zeland, and from Flanders wonne By weekely pay, threescore twelve Bottoms came, From fifty upward, to five hundred Tunne; For ev'ry use a Marriner could name, Whose glittering Flags against the Radient Sunne, Show'd as the Sea had all beene of a flame; For Skiffes, Crayes, Scallops, and the like, why these From ev'ry small Creeke, cov'red all the Seas. The man whose way from London hap'd to lye, By those he met might guesse the generall force, Daily encountred as he passed by, Now with a Troupe of Foote, and then of Horse, To whom the people still themselves apply, Bringing them victuals as in meere remorce: And still the acclamation of the presse, Saint George for England, to your good successe. There might a man have seene in ev'ry Streete, The Father bidding farewell to his Sonne: Small Children kneeling at their Fathers feete: The Wife with her deare Husband ne'r had done: Brother, his Brother, with adieu to greete: One Friend to take leave of another runne: The Mayden with her best belov'd to part, Gave him her hand, who tooke away her heart. The nobler Youth the common ranke above, On their corvetting Coursers mounted faire, One ware his Mistris Garter, one her Glove; And he a lock of his deare Ladies haire; And he her Colours, whom he most did love; There was not one but did some Favour weare: And each one tooke it, on his happy speede, To make it famous by some Knightly deede. The cloudes of dust, that from the wayes arose, Which in their martch, the trampling Troupes doe reare; When as the Sunne their thicknesse doth oppose In his descending, shining wondrous cleare, To the beholder farre off standing, showes Like some besieged Towne, that were on fire: As though fore-telling e'r they should returne, That many a Citie yet secure must burne. The well-rig'd Navie falne into the Road, For this short Cut with victuall fully stor'd, The King impatient of their long aboad, Commands his Army instantly aboard, Casting to have each Company bestow'd, As then the time convenience could afford; The Ships appointed wherein they should goe, And Boats prepar'd for waftage to and fro.

The Seas amazed at the fearefull sight, Of Armes, and Ensignes, that aboard were brought, Of Streamers, Banners, Pennons, Ensignes pight, Upon each Pup and Prowe; and at the fraught, So full of terror, that it hardly might Into a naturall course againe be brought, As the vaste Navie which at Anchor rides, Proudly presumes to shoulder out the Tides. The Fleet then full, and floating on the Maine, The numerous Masts, with their brave Topsailes spred, When as the Winde a little doth them straine, Seeme like a Forrest bearing her proud head Against some rough flawe, that forerunns a raine; A Simile of the Navy. So doe they looke from every loftie sted, Which with the Surges tumbled too and fro, Seeme (even) to bend, as trees are seene to doe. From every Ship when as the Ordnance rore, Of their depart, that all might understand, When as the zealous people from the shore, Againe with fires salute them from the Land, The brave solemnity at the departing of the Fleet. For so was order left with them before, To watch the Beacons, with a carefull hand, Which being once fierd, the people more or lesse, Should all to Church, and pray for their successe. They shape their Course into the Mouth of Seyne, The Navy Landing in the mouth of Seyne. That destin'd Flood those Navies to receive, Before whose fraught, her France had prostrate laine, As now she must this, that shall never leave, Untill the Engines that it doth containe, Into the ayre her heightned walls shall heave; Whose stubborne Turrets had refus'd to bow, To that brave Nation that shall shake them now. Long Boates with Scouts are put to land before, Upon light Naggs the Countrey to discry, (Whilst the brave Army setting is on shore,) To view what strength the enemy had nie, Pressing the bosome of large France so sore, That her pale Genius, in affright doth flye To all her Townes and warnes them to awake, And for her safety up their Armes to take. At Paris, Roan, and Orleance, she calls, And at their gates with gronings doth complaine: Then cries she out, O get up to your walls: The English Armies are return'd againe, Which in two Battailes gave those fatall falls, At Cressie, and at Poyteers, where lay slaine Our conquered Fathers, which with very feare Quake in their Graves to feele them landed here. The King of France now having understood, Of Henries entrance, (but too well improv'd,) He cleerly saw that deere must be the blood, That it must cost, e'r he could be remov'd; He sends to make his other Sea Townes good, Never before so much it him behov'd; In ev'ry one a Garison to lay, Fearing fresh powers from England ev'ry day. To the high'st earth whilst awfull Henry gets, From whence strong Harflew he might easl'est see, With sprightly words, and thus their courage whets, The brave encouragement of a couragious King.In yonder walls be Mynes of gold (quoth he) He's a poore Slave, that thinkes of any debts; Harflew shall pay for all, it ours shall be: This ayre of France doth like me wondrous well, Lets burne our Ships, for here we meane to dwell. But through his Hoast, he first of all proclaim'd A charitable Proclamation made by the King.In paine of death, no English man should take From the Religious, aged, or the maym'd, Or women that could no resistance make: To gaine his owne for that he onely aym'd; Nor would have such to suffer for his sake: Which in the French (when they the same did heare) Bred of this brave King, a religious feare. His Army rang'd, in order fitting warre, The Kings mayne Standard (for the ponderousnes thereof,) ever borne upon a Carriage.Each with some greene thing doth his Murrian crowne, With his mayne standard fixt upon the Carre; Comes the great King before th'intrenched Towne, Whilst from the walls the people gazing are, In all their sights he sets his Army downe; Nor for their shot he careth not a pin, But seekes where he his Battery may begin. And into three, his Army doth divide, The King makes his approaches on three parts.His strong aproaches on three parts to make; Himselfe on th'one, Clarence on th'other side, To Yorke and Suffolke he the third doth take, The Mines the Duke of Glocester doth guide; Then caus'd his Ships the River up to Stake, That none with Victuall should the Towne relieve, Should the Sword faile, with Famine them to grieve. From his Pavillion where he sate in State, Arm'd for the Siedge, and buckling on his Shield, Brave Henry sends his Herault to the Gate, By Trumpets sound, to summon them to yeeld, The King summons Harflew. And to accept his Mercy, ere to late, Or else to say ere he forsooke the field, Harflew should be but a meere heape of Stones, Her buildings buried with her Owners bones. France on this sudaine put into a fright, With the sad newes of Harflew in distresse, Whose inexpected, miserable plight, She on the suddaine, knew not to redresse, But urg'd to doe the utmost that shee might, The peoples feares and clamours to suppresse, Raiseth a power with all the speede she could, Somewhat thereby, to loose King Henries hold. The Marshall, and the Constable of France, Charles de Alibert, and John Bowcequalt. Leading those Forces levied for the turne, By which they thought their Titles to advance, And of their Countrey endlesse praise to earne, But it with them farre otherwise doth chance, For when they saw the Villages to burne, And high-towr'd Harflew round ingirt with fire, They with their powers to Cawdebeck retire. Like as a Hinde when shee her Calfe doth see, A Simile of the French powers. Lighted by chance into a Lions pawes, From which should shee adventure it to free, Shee must her selfe fill his devouring Jawes, And yet her young one, still his prey must be, (Shee so instructed is by Natures Lawes:) With them so fares it, which must needs goe downe If they would fight; and yet must loose the Towne: Now doe they mount their Ordnance for the day, A discription of the siege of Harflewe, in the 19. following Stanzaes. Their scaling Ladders rearing to the walls, Their battering Rammes against the gates they lay, Their brazen slings send in the wilde-fire balls, Baskets of twigs now carie stones and clay, And to th'assault who furiously not falls; The Spade and Pickax working are belowe, Which then unfelt, yet gave the greatest blowe. Rampiers of earth the painefull Pyoners raise With the walls equall, close upon the Dike, To passe by which the Souldier that assayes, On Planks thrust over, one him downe doth strike: Him with a mall a second English payes, A second French transpearc'd him with a Pyke: That from the height of the embattel'd Towers, Their mixed blood ranne downe the walls in showers. A French man back into the Towne doth fall, With a sheafe Arrow shot into the head; An English man in scaling of the wall, From the same place is by a stone struck dead, Tumbling upon them logs of wood, and all, That any way for their defence might sted: The hills at hand re-ecchoing with the din Of shouts without, and fearefull shriekes within. When all at once the English men assaile, The French within all valiantly defend, And in a first assault, if any faile, They by a second strive it to amend: Out of the Towne come Crosbowe Arrowes. quarries thick as haile; As thick againe their Shafts the English send: The bellowing Canon from both sides doth rore, With such a noyse as makes the Thunder pore. Now upon one side you should heare a cry, And all that Quarter clowded with a smother; The like from that against it by and by; As though the one were eccho to the other, The King and Clarence so their turnes can ply: And valiant Gloster showes himselfe their brother; Whose Mynes to the besieg'd more mischiefe doe, Then with th'assaults above, the other two. An olde man sitting by the fier side, Decrepit with extreamity of Age, Stilling his little Grand-childe when it cride, Almost distracted with the Batteries rage: Sometimes doth speake it faire, sometimes doth chide, As thus he seekes its mourning to asswage, By chance a Bullet doth the chimney hit, Which falling in, doth kill both him and it. Whilst the sad weeping Mother sits her downe, To give her little new-borne Babe the Pap: A lucklesse quarry leveld at the Towne, Kills the sweet Baby sleeping in her lap, That with the fright shee falls into a swoone, From which awak'd, and mad with the mishap; As up a Rampire shreeking she doth clim, Comes a great Shot, and strikes her lim from lim. Whilst a sort runne confusedly to quench, Some Pallace burning, or some fired Street, Call'd from where they were fighting in the Trench: They in their way with Balls of Wilde-fire meet, So plagued are the miserable French, Not above head, but also under feet: For the fierce English vowe the Towne to take, Or of it soone a heape of stones to make. Hot is the Siege the English comming on, As men so long to be kept out that scorne, Carelesse of wounds as they were made of stone; As with their teeth the walls they would have torne: Into a Breach who quickly is not gone; Is by the next behinde him over-borne: So that they found a place that gave them way, They never car'd what danger therein lay. From ev'ry Quarter they their course must plye, As't pleas'd the King them to th'assault to call: Now on the Duke of Yorke the charge doth lye: To Kent and Cornwall then the turne doth fall: Then Huntingdon up to the walls they crye: Then Suffolke, and then Excester; which all In their meane Souldiers habits us'd to goe, Taking such part as those that own'd them doe. The men of Harflew rough excursions make, Upon the English watchfull in their Tent, Whose courages they to their cost awake, With many a wound that often back them sent, So proud a Sally that durst undertake, And in the Chase pell mell amongst them went, For on the way such ground of them thye win, That some French are shut out, some English in. Nor idely sit our men at Armes the while, Foure thousand Horse that ev'ry day goe out; And of the Field are Masters many a mile, By putting the Rebellious French to rout; No Peasants them with promises beguile: Another bus'nesse they were come about; For him they take, his Ransome must redeeme, Onely French Crownes, the English men esteeme. Whilst English Henry lastly meanes to trye: By three vast Mynes, the walls to overthrowe: The French men their approches that espye, By Countermynes doe meete with them belowe, And as opposed in the Workes they lye: Up the Besieged the Besiegers blowe, That stifled quite, with powder as with dust, Longer to walls they found it vaine to trust. Till Gaucourt then, and Tuttivile that were The Townes Commanders, (with much perill) finde The Resolution that the English beare; As how their owne to yeelding were enclinde, Summon to parly, off'ring frankly there; If that ayde came not by a day assignde, To give the Towne up, might their lyves stand free: As for their goods, at Henries will to be. And having wonne their conduct to the King, Those hardy Chiefes on whom the charge had layne: Thither those well-fed Burgesses doe bring, What they had off'red strongly to maintaine In such a case, although a dang'rous thing, Yet they so long upon their knees remaine: That five dayes respight from his Grant they have, Which was the most, they (for their lives) durst crave. The time perfixed comming to expire, And their reliefe ingloriously delay'd: Nothing within their sight but sword, and fire; And bloody Ensignes ev'ry where display'd: The English still within themselves entire, When all these things they seriously had way'd, To Henries mercy found that they must trust, For they perceiv'd their owne to be injust. The Ports are opened, weapons layd aside, And from the walls th'Artillary displac'd: The Armes of England are advanc'd in pride: The watch Tower, with Saint Georges Banner grac'd: Live Englands Henry, all the people cride: Into the Streetes their women runne in hast, Bearing their little Children, for whose sake They hop'd the King would the more mercy take. The gates thus widened with the breath of Warre; Their ample entrance to the English gave: There was no dore that then had any barre; For of their owne not any thing they have: When Henry comes on his Emperiall Carre: The King of England entreth Harflew in triumph. To whom they kneele their lives alone to save. Strucken with wonder, when that face they sawe, Wherein such mercy was, with so much awe. And first themselves the English to secure, Doubting what danger might be yet within; The strongest Forts, and Citadell make sure, To showe that they could keepe as well as win, And though the spoyles them wondrously alure, To fall to pillage e'r they will begin, They shut each passage, by which any power Might be brought on to hinder, but an hower. That Conquering King which entring at the gate, Borne by the presse as in the ayre he swamme: Upon the suddaine layes aside his state, And of a Lyon is become a Lambe: He is not now what he was but of late: But on his bare feete to the Church he came: By his example, as did all the presse, To give God thankes, for his first good successe. And sends his Herauld to King Charles to say, That though he thus was setled on his shore, Yet he his Armes was ready downe to lay, His ancient right if so he would restore: But if the same he wilfully denay, King Henry offereth to decide his right by single combat. To stop th'effusion of their Subjects gore; He frankly off'reth in a single fight, With the young Daulphine to decide his right. Eight dayes at Harflew he doth stay to heare, What answere back, his Herauld him would bring: But when he found that he was ne'r the neere; And that the Daulphine meaneth no such thing As to fight single; nor that any were To deale for composition from the King: He casts for Callice to make forth his way, And take such Townes, as in his Journeyes lay. But first his bus'nesse he doth so contrive, To curbe the Townes-men, should they chance to stirre Of Armes, and Office he doth them deprive, And to their roomes the English doth preferre: Out of the Ports all Vagrants he doth drive, And therein sets his Unckle Excester: This done, to martch he bids the thundring Drummes, To scourge proud France when now her Conqueror comes. The King and Daulphine having understood, How on his way this haughty Henry was Over the Soame, which is a dangerous flood; Pluckt downe the Bridges that might give him passe; And ev'ry thing, if fit for humane food, Caus'd to be forrag'd; (to a wondrous masse) And more then this, his Journeyes to fore-slowe, He scarce one day unskirmish'd with, doth goe. But on his march, in midst of all his foes; He like a Lyon keepes them all at bay, And when they seeme him strictly to enclose; Yet through the thick'st he hewes him out a way: Nor the proud Daulphine dare him to oppose; Though off'ring oft his Army to fore-lay: Nor all the power the envious French can make, Force him one foote, his path (but) to forsake. And each day as his Army doth remove, Marching along upon Soames Marshy side, His men at Armes on their tall Horses prove, To finde some shallow, over where to ryde, But all in vaine against the Streame they strove, A foard found in the River of SoameTill by the helpe of a laborious guide, A Ford was found to set his Army ore Which never had discovered beene before. The newes divulg'd that he had waded Soame, And safe to shore his Caridges had brought, Into the Daulphins bosome strooke so home, And one the weakenesse of King Charles so wrought; That like the troubled Sea, when it doth Foame, As in a rage, to beate the Rocks to nought; So doe they storme, and curse on curse they heapt Gainst those which should the passages have kept. And at that time, both resident in Roan, Thither for this assembling all the Peeres, Whose Counsailes now must underprop their Throne A Counsell held at Roan against the King of England. Against the Foe; which, not a man but feares; Yet in a moment confident are growne, When with fresh hopes, each one his fellow cheeres, That ere the English to their Callis got, Some for this spoile should pay a bloudy shot. Therfore they both in solemne Counsaile satt, With Berry and with Britaine their Alies; Now speake they of this course, and then of that, As to insnare him how they might divise; Something they faine would doe, but know not what, At length the Duke Alanzon up doth rise, And craving silence of the King and Lords, Against the English, brake into this these words, Had this unbridled youth an Army led, A speech of the Duke Alanzon, against the English. That any way were worthy of your feare, Against our Nation, that durst turne the head, Such as the former English forces were, This care of yours, your Countrey then might sted, To tell you then, who longer can forbeare, That into question, you our valour bring, To call a Counsaile for so poore a thing. A Route of tatter'd Rascalls starved so, As forced through extreamity of need, To rake for scraps on Dunghils as they goe, And on the Berries of the Shrubs to feed, Besides with fluxes are enfeebled so, And other foule diseases that they breed, That they, there Armes disabled are to sway, But in their march doe leave them on the way. And to our people but a handfull are, Scarse thirtie thousand, when to Land they came, Of which to England dayly some repayre, Many from Harflew carried sicke and lame, Fitter for Spittles, and the Surgions care, Then with their Swords on us to winne them fame, Unshod, and without stockings are the best, And those by Winter miserably opprest. To let them dye upon their march abroad, And Fowles upon their Carkases to feed, The heapes of them upon the common road A great infection likely were to breed, For our owne safeties see them then bestow'd, And doe for them this charitable deede: Under our Swords together let them fall, And one that day they dye, be buried all. This bold invective forc'd against the Foe, Although it most of the Assembly seas'd, Yet those which better did the English know, Were but a little with his speeches pleas'd, And that the Duke of Berry meant to showe: Which when the murmure somewhat was appeas'd, After a while their listning silence breakes, And thus in answere of Alanzon speakes. The Duke of Berrys answere to Alanzon. My liedge, quoth he, and you my Lords, and Peeres, Whom this great businesse chiefely doth concerne, By my experience, now so many yeeres To know the English I am not to learne; Nor I more feeling have of humane feares Then fitteth Manhood, nor doe hope to earne Suffrage from any; but by zeale am wonne, To speake my minde here, as the Duke hath done. Th'events of Warre are various (as I know) And say, the losse upon the English light, Yet may a dying man give such a blow, As much may hinder his proud Conquerours might; It is enough our puissant power to showe To the weake English, now upon their flight, When want, and winter, strongly spurre them on, You else but stay them, that would faine be gon. I like our Forces their first course should hold, To skirmish with them, upon every stay, But fight by no meanes with them, though they would, Except they finde them forraging for pray, So still you have them shut up in a Fould, And still to Callis keepe them in their way; So Fabius wearied Hanibal, so we May English Henry, pleased if you be. And of the English rid your Countrey cleane, If on their backs, but Callice walles they win, Whose Frontier Townes you easly may maintaine, With a strong Army still to keepe them in; Then let our Ships make good the mouth of Seyne, And at your pleasure Harflew you may winne, Ere with Supplys againe they can invade, Spent in the Voyage lately hither made. That day at Poyteers, in that bloudy Field, The sudaine turne in that great Battell then, Shall ever teach me, whilest I Armes can weeld, Never to trust to multitudes of men; Twas the first day that ere I wore a Sheeld, Oh let me never see the like agen! Where their Blacke Edward such a Battell wonne, As to behold it might amaze the Sunne. There did I see our conquered Fathers fall, Before the English on that fatall ground, When as to ours their number was but small, And with brave Spirits France ne'r did more abound, Yet oft that Battaile into minde I call, Whereas of ours, one man seemd all one wound, I instance this; yet humbly here submit My selfe to fight, if you shall thinke it fit. The Marshall and the Constable about To second, what this sager Duke had said: The youthfull Lords into a cry brake out, Gainst their opinions, so that over-sway'd, Young mens counsailes oft-times prove the utter subversion both of themselves and others. Some seeming of their Loyalties to doubt; Alanzon as an Oracle obay'd, And not a French then present, but doth sweare To kill an English if ynow there were. A Herault posted presently away, The King of England to the field to dare, The French King sendeth to dare the King of England to Battaile.To bid him cease his spoyle, nor to delay Gainst the French power his forces but prepare: For that King Charles determin'd to display His bloody Ensignes, and through France declare, The day, and place, that Henry should set downe, In which their Battailes, should dispose the Crowne. This newes to Henry by the Herault brought, As one dispassion'd soberly (quoth he) Had your King pleas'd, we sooner might have fought; The King of Englands modest answer.For now my Souldiers much enfeebled be: Nor day, nor place, for Battaile shall be sought By English Henry: but if he seeke me, I to my utmost will my selfe defend, And to th'Almighties pleasure leave the end. The brute of this intended Battaile spred, The coldnesse of each sleeping courage warmes, And in the French that daring boldnesse bred: Like casting Bees that they arise in swarmes, Thinking the English downe so farre to tred, As past that day ne'r more to rise in Armes, T'extirpe the name, if possible it were, At least not after to be heard of there. A Simily of the rising of the French.As when you see the envious Crowe espye, Something that shee doth naturally detest: With open throat how shee doth squall and crye; And from the next Grove calleth in the rest, And they for those beyond them bawling flye, Till their foule noyse doe all the ayre infest: Thus French, the French to this great Battaile call, Upon their swords to see the English fall. And to the King when seriously one tolde, With what an Host he should encountred be, David Gam, a great Captain in that Warr. Gam noting well, the King did him behold, In the reporting; Merrily (quoth he) My Liege I'le tell you if I may be bold, We will divide this Army into three: One part we'll kill, the second prisoners stay; And for the third, we'll leave to runne away. But for the Foe came hourely in so fast, Lest they his Army should disordred take: The King who wisely doth the worst forecast, His speedy martch doth presently forsake, Into such forme and his Batallion cast; That doe their worst they should not eas'ly shake; For that his scouts which forrag'd had the Coast, Bad him at hand expect a puissant Host. On which ere long the English Vauward light, Which York, of men the bravest, doth command, The Duke of Yorke. When either of them in the others sight, He caus'd the Army instantly to stand, As though preparing for a present Fight, And rideth forth from his couragious Band, To view the French, whose numbers over spread, The troubled Country on whose earth they tread. Now were both Armies got upon that ground, As on a Stage, where they their strengthes must trye, Whence from the wydth of many a gaping wound, There's many a soule into the Ayre must flye: Meane while the English that some ease had found; By the advantage of a Village nie, There set them downe the Battell to abide, When they the place had strongly fortifide. Made drunke with pride the haughty French disdaine, The French scorning the English, being so fewe in respect of their mighty power. Lesse then their owne, a multitude to view, Nor aske of God the victory to gaine, Upon the English wext so poore and fewe, To stay their slaughter thinking it a paine, And lastly to that insolence they grewe, Quoyts, Lots, and Dice for Englishmen to cast, And sweare to pay, the Battaile being past. For knots of corde to ev'ry Towne they send, The Captiv'd English that they caught to binde, For to perpetuall slav'ry they intend: Those that alive they on the Field should finde, So much as that they fear'd lest they should spend Too many English, wherefore they assignde Some to keepe fast those, fayne that would be gon After the Fight, to try their Armes upon. One his bright sharpe-eg'd Semiter doth showe, Off'ring to lay a thousand Crownes (in pride) That he two naked English at one blowe, Bound back to back will at the wasts divide, Some bett his sword will do't, some others no, After the Battaile, and they'll have it tride: Another wafts his Blade about his head, And shewes them how their hamstrings he will shread. They part their prisoners, passing them for debt, And in their Ransome ratibly accord To a Prince of ours, a Page of theirs they set; And a French Lacky to an English Lord; As for our Gentry them to hyre they'll let, And as good cheape as they can them afford, Branded for Slaves, that if they hapt to stray, Knowne by the marke, them any one might slay. And cast to make a Chariot for the King, Painted with Antickes, and ridiculous toyes, In which they meane to Paris him to bring, To make sport to their Madames and their Boyes, And will have Rascalls, Rymes of him to sing, Made in his mock'ry; and in all these joyes, They bid the Bells to ring, and people crie, Before the Battaile, France and Victorie. And to the King and Daulphine sent away (Who at that time residing were in Roane) To be partakers of that glorious day: Wherein the English should be overthrowne, Lest that of them ensuing times should say, That for their safety they forsooke their owne; When France did that brave victory obtaine, That shall her lasting'st monument remaine. The poore distressed Englishmen the whiles, Not dar'd by doubt, and lesse appaul'd with dread Of their Arm'd Pykes, some sharpning are the pyles, The Archer grinding his barb'd Arrow head: Their Bills and Blades, some whetting are with Files: And some their Armours strongly Riveted: Some pointing Stakes to stick into the ground, To guard the Bow-men, and their Horse to wound. The night fore-running this most dreadfull day: The French that all to jollity encline: Some fall to dancing, some againe to play: The Ryot in the French Campe the night before the Battell. And some are drinking to this great Designe: But all in pleasure spend the night away: The Tents with lights, the Fields with Boone-fires shine: The common Souldiers Free-mens Catches sing: With showtes and laughter all the Campe doth ring. The wearied English watchfull o'r their Foes, (The depth of night then drawing on so fast) That fayne a little would themselves repose, With thanks to God, doe take that small repast Which that poore Village willingly bestowes: And having plac'd their Sentinels at last, They fall to Prayer, and in their Cabins blest, T'refresh their spirits, then tooke them to their rest. In his Pavillion Princely Henry lay'd, Whilst all his Army round about him slept: Pondering in his thoughts, his Fathers comming to the Crowne by deposing the rigthfull King. His restlesse head upon his Helmet stay'd, For carefull thoughts his eyes long waking kept: Great God (quoth he) withdraw not now thy ayde: Nor let my Father Henries sinnes be heapt On my transgressions, up the Summe to make, For which thou may'st me utterly forsake. Henry the fift caused the body of King Richard to be taken up, where it was meanely buried at Langley, and to be layde in Westminster by his first Wife Queene Anne. King Richards wrongs, to minde, Lord doe not call, Nor how for him my Father did offend, From us alone derive not thou his fall, Whose odious life caus'd his untimely end, That by our Almes be expiated all: Let not that sinne on me his Sonne desend, When as his body I translated have, And buried in an honourable Grave. These things thus pondring, sorrow-ceasing sleepe, From cares to rescue his much troubled minde, Upon his Eye-lids stealingly doth creepe, And in soft slumbers every sense doth binde, (As undisturbed every one to keepe) When as that Angell to whom God assign'd, The guiding of the English, gliding downe The silent Campe doth with fresh courage crowne. His glittering wings he gloriously displaies, Over the Hoste as every way it lyes, With golden Dreames their travell, and repaies, This Herault from the Rector of the skies, In Vision warnes them not to use delayes, But to the Battell cheerefully to rise, And be victorious, for that day at hand, He would amongst them for the English stand. The dawne scarse drewe the curtaines of the East, But the late wearied Englishmen awake, And much refreshed with a little rest Themselves soone ready for the Battaile make, Not any one but feeleth in his breast, That sprightly fire which Courage bids him take, For ere the Sunne next rising went to bed, The French by them in triumph should be led. And from their Cabins, ere the French arose, (Drown'd in the pleasure of the passed night,) The English cast their Battailes to dispose, Fit for the ground whereon they were to fight: Foorth that brave King couragious Henry goes, The great care of a wise and politike Captaine.An hower before that it was fully light, To see if there might any place be found, To give his Hoste advantage by the ground. Where twas his hap a Quicksett hedge to view, Well growne in height; and for his purpose thin, Yet by the Ditch upon whose banke it grew, He found it to be difficult to winne, Especially if those of his were true, Amongst the shrubbs that he should set within, By which he knew their strength of Horse must come, If they would ever chardge his Vangaurd home. And of three hundred Archers maketh choice, This Stratagem the overthrow of the French.Some to be taken out of every Band, The strongest Bowmen, by the generall voyce, Such as beside were valient of their hand, And to be so imployed, as would rejoyce, Appointing them behinde the hedge to stand, To shrowde themselves from sight, and to be mute, Untill a signall freely bad them shute. The gamesome Larke now got upon her Wing, As twere the English earely to awake, And to wide heaven her cheerefull notes doth sing, As shee for them would intercession make, Nor all the noyse that from below doth spring, Her ayrie walke can force her to forsake, Of some much noted, and of others lesse, But yet of all presaging good successe. The lazie French their leisure seem to take, And in their Cabins keepe themselves so long, Till flocks of Ravens them with noyse awake, Over the Army like a Cloud that hong, Which greater haste inforceth them to make, When with their croaking all the Countrey rong, Which boaded slaughter as the most doe say, But by the French it turned was this way. That this divyning Foule well understood, The French mis-interpret the flight of Ravens hovering over their owne Campe. Upon that place much gore was to be spill'd, And as those Birds doe much delight in blood, With humane flesh would have their gorges fill'd, So waited they upon their Swords for food, To feast upon the English being kill'd, Then little thinking that these came in deed On their owne mangled Carkases to feed. When soone the French preparing for the Field, Their armed troops are setting in array, Whose wondrous numbers they can hardly weeld, The place too little whereupon they lay, They therefore to necessitie must yeeld, And into Order put them as they may, Whose motion sounded like to Nilus fall, That the vaste ayre was deafned therewithall. The Constable, and Admirall of France, With the grand Marshall, men of great command: The Marshalling of the French Army, containing three stanzas. The Dukes of Burbon, and of Orleance, Some for their place, some for their birth-right stand, The Daulphine of Averney (to advance His worth and honour) of a puissant hand: The Earle of Ewe in Warre that had beene bred, These mighty men the mighty Vauward led. The mayne brought forward by the Duke of Barre, Nevers, and Beamont, men of speciall name: Alanzon thought, not equall'd in this Warre, With them Salines, Rous, and Grandpre came, Their long experience, who had fetcht from farre, Whom this expected Conquest doth enflame, Consisting most of Crosbowes, and so great, As France her selfe it well might seeme to threat. The Duke of Brabant of high valour knowne, The Earles of Marle, and Faconbridge the Reare, To Arthur Earle of Richmount's selfe alone, They leave the Right wing to be guided there: Lewes of Burbon, second yet to none, Led on the left; with him that mighty Peere The Earle of Vandome, who of all her men Large France entytled, her great Master then. The Duke of Yorke the English Vauward guides, The Marshalling of the English Army containing five stanzas.Of our strong Archers, that consisted most; Which with our Horse was wing'd on both the sides: T'affront so great and terrible an Host; There valiant Fanhope, and there Beamonut rides, With Willoughby which scowred had the Coast, That morning early, and had seene at large, How the Foe came, that then they were to charge. Henry himselfe, on the mayne Battell brings, Nor can these Legions of the French affright This Mars of men, this King of earthly Kings: Who seem'd to be much pleased with the sight, As one ordayn'd t'accomplish mighty things; Who to the Field came in such brav'ry dight: As to the English boades successfull luck Before one stroke, on either side was struck. The bravery of King Henryes owne Person.In Warlike state the Royall Standard borne Before him, as in splendrous Armes he road, Whilst his corvetting Courser seem'd in scorne To touch the earth whereon he proudly troad, Lillyes, and Lyons quarterly adorne; His Shield, and his Caparison doe load: Upon his Helme a Crowne with Diamonds deckt, Which through the Field their Radient fiers reflect. The Duke of Gloster neere to him agen, T'assist his Brother in that dreadfull day, Oxford and Suffolke both true Marshiall men, Ready to keepe the Battell in Array, To Excester there was appointed then The Reare; on which their second succours lay: Which were the youth, most of the Noblest blood, Under the Ensignes of their names that stood. Then of the stakes he doth the care commend, To certaine troupes that active were and strong, Onely divis'd the Archers to defend, Pointed with Iron and of five foote long; To be remov'd still which way they should bend, Where the French Horse should thick'st upon them throng, Which when the Host to charge each other went, Show'd his great wit that first did them invent. Both Armies fit, and at the point to fight, The French themselves assuring of the day; The scornfull message of the French to the King of England. The Kings answer to the French. Send to the King of England (as in spight) To know what he would for his Ransome pay, Who with this answere doth their scorne requite: I pray thee Herault wish the French to stay, And e'r the day be past, I hope to see, That for their Ransomes they shall send to me. The French which found how little Henry makes, Of their vaine boasts, as set therewith on fire, Whilst each one to his Ensigne him betakes; The Constable to raise their spleene the hyer, The Constables Oration to the French. Thus speakes: Brave friends now for your Grandsires sakes, Your Country, Honours, or what may inspire Your soules with courage, straine up all your powers, To make this day victoriously ours. Forward stout French, your valours and advance, By taking vengeance for our Fathers slaine, And strongly fixe the Diadem of France, Which to this day unsteady doth remaine: Now with your swords their Traytours bosomes lance, And with their bloods wash out that ancient staine, And make our earth drunke with the English gore, Which hath of ours oft surfited before. Let not one live in England once to tell, What of their King, or of the rest became: Nor to the English, what in France befell: But what is bruted by the generall fame: But now the Drummes began so lowd to yell, As cut off further what he would declame: And Henry seeing them on so fast to make, Thus to his Souldiers comfortably spake. The King of Englands Oration to the English. Thinke but upon the justnesse of our cause, And he's no man their number that will wey; Thus our great Grandsire purchas'd his applause, The more they are, the greater is our prey, We'll hand in hand wade into dangers jawes, And let report to England this Convey That it for me no Ransome e'r shall rayse, Either I'le Conquer, or here end my dayes. It were no glory for us to subdue Them, then our number, were the French no more; When in one Battaile twice our Fathers slue, Three times so many as themselves before, But to doe something that were strange and new: Wherefore (I aske you) Came we to this shore; Upon these French our Fathers wan renowne, And with their swords we'll hewe yan Forrest downe. The meanest Souldier if in Fight he take, The greatest Prince in yonder Army knowne, Without controule shall him his prisoner make, And have his Ransome freely as his owne: Now English lyes our Honour at the stake, And now or never be our Valour showne: God and our Cause, Saint George for England stands, Now Charge them English, fortune guide your hands. When hearing one wish all the valiant men At home in England, with them present were; The King makes answere instantly agen, The high valour of the King of England.I would not have one man more then is here: If we subdue, lesse should our praise be then: If overcome, lesse losse shall England beare: And to our numbers we should give that deede, Which must from Gods owne powerfull hand proceede. The dreadfull Charge the Drummes &amp; Trumpets sound, With hearts exalted, though with humbled eyes, When as the English kneeling on the ground, Extend their hands up to the glorious skyes; Then from the earth as though they did rebound, Active as fire immediately they rise: And such a shrill showt from their throats they sent, As made the French to stagger as they went. Wherewith they stopt, when Erpingham which led Sir Thomas Erpingham gave the Signall to the English. The Armie, sawe, the showt had made them stand, Wafting his Warder thrice about his head, He cast it up with his auspicious hand, Which was the signall through the English spread, That they should Charge: which as a dread command Made them rush on, yet with a second rore, Frighting the French worse then they did before. But when they sawe the Enemie so slowe, Which they expected faster to come on, Some scattering Shot they sent out as to showe, That their approach they onely stood upon; Which with more fervour made their rage to glowe, So much disgrace that they had under-gone. Which to amend with Ensignes let at large, Upon the English furiously they Charge. At the full Moone looke how th'unweldy Tide, A Simily of the French charging the English. Shov'd by some Tempest that from Sea doth rise At the full height, against the ragged side Of some rough Cliffe (of a Gigantick sise) Foming with rage impetuously doth ride; The angry French (in no lesse furious wise) Of men at Armes upon their ready Horse, Assayle the English to dispierce their force. When as those Archers there in Ambush layde, Having their Broad side as they came along, With their barb'd Arrowes the French Horses payde: And in their flankes like cruell Hornets stong: The three hundred Archers layd in ambush, disorder the French men at Armes at the first encounter. They kick and crie, of late that proudly nayde: And from their seats their Armed Riders flong: They ranne together flying from the Dike, And make their Riders one another strike. And whilst the Front of the French Vanguard makes, Upon the English thinking them to Route, Their Horses runne upon the Armed stakes, And being wounded, turne themselves about: The Bit into his teeth the Courser takes, And from his Rank flyes with his Master out, Who either hurts or is hurt of his owne, If in the throng not both together throwne. Tumbling on heapes, some of their Horses cast With their foure feete all up into the ayre: Under whose backs their Masters breath their last: Some breake their Raynes, and thence their Riders beare: Some with their feete stick in the Stirups fast, By their fierce Jades, and trayled here and there: Entangled in their Bridles, one back drawes, And pluckes the Bit out of another jawes. With showers of Shafts yet still the English ply The French so fast, upon the point of flight: With the mayne Battell yet stood Henry by, Nor all this while had medled in the Fight, Upon the Horses as in Chase they flye, Arrowes so thick, in such aboundance light, That their broad buttocks men like Butts might see, Whereat for pastime Bow-men shooting be. When soone De Linnies and Sureres hast, Two wings of French horse defeated.To ayde their friends put to this shamefull foyle, With two light wings of Horse which had beene plac't, Still to supply where any should recoyle: But yet their Forces they but vainely waste, For being light, into the generall spoyle, Great losse De Linnies shortly doth sustaine, Yet scapes himselfe; but brave Sureres slaine. The King who sees how well his Vangaurd sped, Sends his command that instantly it stay, Desiring Yorke so bravely that had led, To hold his Souldiers in their first array, For it the Conflict very much might sted, Somewhat to fall aside, and give him way, Till full up to him he might bring his power, And make the Conquest compleate in an hower. Which Yorke obayes, and up King Henry comes, When for his guidance he had got him roome. The dreadfull bellowing of whose strait-brac'd Drummes, The English Vaward and maine Battaile charge the French both at once. To the French sounded like the dreadfull doome, And them with such stupidity benummes, As though the earth had groaned from her wombe, For the grand slaughter ne'r began till then, Covering the earth with multitudes of men. Upon the French what Englishman not falls, (By the strong Bowmen beaten from their Steeds) With Battle-axes, Halberts, Bills, and Maules, Where, in the slaughter every one exceedes, Where every man, his fellow forward calls, And shows him where some great-borne Frenchman bleeds, Whilst Scalps about like broken pot sherds fly, And kill, kill, kill, the Conquering English cry. Now wexed horror to the very height, And scarse a man but wet-shod went in gore, As two together are in deadly fight, And to death wounded, as one tumbleth ore, This Frenchman falling, with his very weight Doth kill another strucken downe before, As he againe so falling, likewise feeles His last breath hastned by anothers heeles. And whilst the English eagerly pursue The fearefull French before them still that fly, The points of Bills and Halbers they imbrue In their sicke Bowels, beaten downe that lye, No man respects how, or what blood he drew, Nor can heare those that for their mercie cry. Eares are damn'd up with howles and hellish sounds, One fearefull noyse a fearefuller confounds. When the couragious Constable of France, Charles de la Breth Constable of France. Th'unlucky Vanguard valiantly that led, Sawe the day turn'd by this disastrous chance, And how the French before the English fled; O stay (quoth he) your Ensignes yet advance, Once more upon the Enemy make head: Never let France say, we were vanquisht so, With our backs basely turn'd upon our Foe. Whom the Chattillyon hapned to accost, And seeing thus the Constable dismayde: The Admirall.Shift noble Lord (quoth he) the day is lost, If the whole world upon the match were layde, I cannot thinke but that Black Edwards Ghost Assists the English, and our Horse hath frayde; If not, some Divels they have with them then, That fight against us in the shapes of men. Not I my Lord, the Constable replies: By my blest soule, the Field I will not quit: Whilst two brave Battailes are to bring supplies: Neither of which one stroke have strucken yet: Nay (quoth Dampeir) I doe not this advise More then your selfe, that I doe feare a whit: Spurre up my Lord, then side to side with mee, And that I feare not, you shall quickly see. They struck their Rowells to the bleeding sides Of their fierce Steeds into the ayre that sprong: And as their fury at that instant guides: They thrust themselves into the murth'ring throng, Where such bad fortune those brave Lords betides: The Admirall slaine.The Admirall from off his Horse was flong, For the sterne English downe before them beere, All that withstand, the Pesant and the Peere. Which when the noble Constable with griefe, Doth this great Lord upon the ground behold; In his account so absolute a Chiefe, Whose death through France he knew would be condol'd, Like a brave Knight to yeeld his friend reliefe, Doing as much as possibly he could, The Constable slaine.Both horse and man is borne into the mayne, And from his friend not halfe a furlong slayne. Now Willoughby upon his well-Arm'd Horse, Into the midst of this Battalion brought, And valiant Fanhope no whit lesse in force, Himselfe hath thither through the squadrons raught, Whereas the English without all remorce, (Looking like men that deepely were distraught) Smoking with sweat, besmear'd with dust and blood, Cut into Cantels all that them withstood. Yet whilst thus hotely they hold up the Chase Upon the French, and had so high a hand, The Duke of Burbon to make good his place, Inforc'd his troupes (with much adoe) to stand, To whom the Earle of Suffolke makes a pace, Bringing a fresh, and yet-unfought-with Band: Of valiant Bill-men, Oxford with successe, Up with his Troupes doth with the other presse. When in comes Orleance, quite thrust off before, By those rude crowdes that from the English ran, Encouraging stout Burbons Troupes the more, T'affront the Foe that instantly began: Faine would the Duke (if possible) restore, (Doing as much as could be done by man) Their Honour lost, by this their late Defeate, And caused onely, by their base Retreate. Their men at Armes their Lances closely lock One in another, and come up so round, That by the strength and horrour of the shock, They forc'd the English to forsake their ground, Shrinking no more then they had beene a Rock, Though by the Shafts receiving many a wound, As they would showe, that they were none of those, That turn'd their backs so basely to their Foes. Panting for breath his Murrian in his hand, The courage of Woodhouse remarkable. Woodhouse comes in as back the English beare, My Lords (quoth he) what now inforc'd to stand, When smiling Fortune off'reth us so faire, The French lye yonder like to wreakes of sand, And you by this our glory but impaire: Or now, or never, your first Fight maintaine, Chatillyon and the Constable are slaine. Hand over head pell mell upon them ronne, If you will prove the Masters of the day, Ferrers and Greystock have so bravely done, That I envie their glory, and dare say, From all the English, they the Gole have woone; Either let's share, or they'll beare all away. This spoke, his Ax about his head he flings, And hasts away, as though his heeles had wings. The Incitation of this youthfull Knight, Besides amends for their Retrayte to make, Doth re-enforce their courage, with their might: A second Charge with speed to undertake; Never before were they so mad to fight, When valiant Fanhope thus the Lords bespake, Suffolke and Oxford as brave Earles you be, Once more beare up with Willoughby and me. Why now, me think'st I heare brave Fanhope speake, Quoth noble Oxford; thou hast thy desire: These words of thine shall yan Battalion breake: And for my selfe I never will retire, Untill our Teene upon the French we wreake: Or in this our last enterprise expire: This spoke, their Gauntlets each doth other give, And to the Charge as fast as they could drive. That slaughter seem'd to have but stay'd for breath, To make the horrour to ensue the more: With hands besmear'd with blood, when meager Death Looketh more grisly then he did before: So that each body seem'd but as a sheath To put their swords in, to the Hilts in gore: As though that instant were the end of all, To fell the French, or by the French to fall. A Simily of the apparance of the Battell.Looke how you see a field of standing Corne, When some strong winde in Summer haps to blowe, At the full height, and ready to be shorne, Rising in waves, how it doth come and goe Forward and backward, so the crowds are borne, Or as the Edie turneth in the flowe: And above all the Bills and Axes play, As doe the Attom's in the Sunny ray. Now with mayne blowes their Armours are unbras'd, And as the French before the English fled, With their browne Bills their recreant backs they baste, And from their shoulders their faint Armes doe shred, One with a gleave neere cut off by the waste, Another runnes to ground with halfe a head: Another stumbling falleth in his flight, Wanting a legge, and one his face doth light. The Dukes who found their force thus overthrowne, And those fewe left them ready still to route, Having great skill, and no lesse courage showne; Yet of their safeties much began to doubt, For having fewe about them of their owne, And by the English so impal'd about, Saw that to some one they themselves must yeeld, Or else abide the fury of the field. They put themselves on those victorious Lords, Who led the Vanguard with so good successe, The Duke of Burbon and Orleance taken prisoners. Bespeaking them with honourable words, Themselves their prisoners freely and confesse, Who by the strength of their commanding swords, Could hardly save them from the slaught'ring presse, By Suffolks ayde till they away were sent, Who with a Guard convay'd them to his Tent. When as their Souldiers to eschew the sack, Gainst their owne Battell bearing in their flight, By their owne French are strongly beaten back: Lest they their Ranks, should have disord'red quight, So that those men at Armes goe all to wrack Twixt their owne friends, and those with whom they fight, Wherein disorder and destruction seem'd To strive, which should the powerfullest be deem'd. And whilst the Daulphine of Averney cryes, Called of some Guiscard the Daulphine of Aragon. Stay men at Armes, let Fortune doe her worst, And let that Villaine from the field that flyes By Babes yet to be borne, be ever curst: All under heaven that we can hope for, lyes On this dayes battell, let me be the first That turn'd yee back upon your desperate Foes, To save our Honours, though our lyves we lose. To whom comes in the Earle of Ewe, which long Had in the Battaile ranged here and there, A thousand Bills, a thousand Bowes among, And had seene many spectakles of feare, And finding yet the Daulphins spirit so strong, By that which he had chanst from him to heare, Upon the shoulder claps him, Prince quoth he, Since I must fall, ô let me fall with thee. Scarse had he spoke, but th'English them inclose, And like to Mastives fircely on them flew, Who with like Courage strongly them oppose, When the Lord Beamont, who their Armings knewe, Their present perill to brave Suffolke shewes, Quoth hee, Lo where Daverney are and Ewe, In this small time, who since the Field begun, Have done as much, as can by men be done. Now slaughter cease me, if I doe not greeve, Two so brave Spirits should be untimely slaine, Lies there no way (my Lord) them to releeve, And for their Ransomes two such to retaine: Quoth Suffolke, come weele hazard their repreeve, And share our Fortunes, in they goe amaine, And with such danger through the presse they wade, As of their lives but small account they made. Yet ere they through the clustred Crouds could get, Oft downe on those, there trod to death that lay, The Daulphin of Averney slaine.The valient Daulphin had discharg'd his debt, Then whom no man had bravelier serv'd that day. The Earle of Ewe taken prisoner.The Earle of Ewe, and wondrous hard beset: Had left all hope of life to scape away: Till noble Beamont and brave Suffolke came, And as their prisoner seas'd him by his name. Now the mayne Battaile of the French came on, The Vauward vanquisht, quite the Field doth flye, And other helpes besides this, have they none: But that their hopes doe on their mayne relye, And therefore now it standeth them upon, To fight it bravely, or else yeeld, or dye: For the fierce English Charge so home and sore, As in their hands Joves Thunderbolts they bore. The Duke of Yorke slaine.The Duke of Yorke, who since the fight begun, Still in the top of all his Troopes was seene, And things well neere beyond beleefe had done, Which of his Fortune, made him overweene, Himselfe so farre into the maine doth runne, So that the French which quickly got betweene Him and his succours, that great Chiefetaine slue, Who bravely fought whilest any breath he drew. The newes soone brought to this Couragious King, Orespred his face with a distempred Fire, Though making little shew of any thing, The King heareth of the Duke of Yorks death. Yet to the full his eyes exprest his Ire, More then before the Frenchmen menacing; And hee was heard thus softly to respire: Well, of thy blood revenged will I bee, The Kings resolution. Or ere one houre be past Ile follow thee. When as the frolicke Cavalry of France, That in the head of the maine Battaile came, Perceiv'd the King of England to advance, To Charge in person; It doth them inflame, Each one well hoping it might be his chance To sease upon him, which was all their ayme, Then with the bravest of the English mett, Themselves that there before the King had sett. When the Earle of Cornewal with unusuall force, The bloody scuffle betweene the French and English, at the Joyning of the two maine Battailes, in five Stanzas Encounters Grandpre (next that came to hands) In Strength his equall, blow for blow they scorce, Weelding their Axes as they had beene wands, Till the Earle tumbles Grandpre from his Horse, Over whom straight the Count Salines stands, And lendeth Cornwal such a blow withall, Over the Crupper that he makes him fall. Cornwal recovers, for his Armes were good, And to Salines maketh up againe, Who changde such boysterous buffets, that the blood, Doth through the Joints of their strong Armour straine, Till Count Salines sunck downe where he stood, Blamount who sees the Count Salines slaine, Straight copes with Cornwal beaten out of breath Till Kent comes in, and rescues him from death. Kent upon Blamount furiously doth flye, Who at the Earle with no lesse courage struck, And one the other with such knocks they plye, That eithers Axe in th'others Helmet stuck; Whilst they are wrastling, crossing thigh with thigh; Their Axes pykes, which soonest out should pluck: They fall to ground like in their Casks to smother, With their clutcht Gauntlets cuffing one another. Couragious Cluet grieved at the sight Of his friend Blamounts unexpected fall, Called Cluet of Brabant.Makes in to lend him all the ayde he might; Whose comming seem'd the stout Lord Scales to call, Betwixt whom then began a mortall fight, When instantly fell in Sir Phillip Hall, Gainst him goes Roussy, in then Lovell ran, Whom next Count Morvyle chuseth as his man. Their Curates are unrivetted with blowes, With horrid wounds their breasts and faces slasht; There drops a cheeke, and there falls off a nose: And in ones face his fellowes braines are dasht; Yet still the Better with the English goes; The earth of France with her owne blood is washt; They fall so fast, she scarse affords them roome, That one mans Trunke becomes anothers Toombe. The Earle of Suffolke chargeth the Earle of Huntingdon With breach of promise.When Suffolk chargeth Huntingdon with sloth, Over himselfe too wary to have bin, And had neglected his fast plighted troth Upon the Field, the Battaile to begin, That where the one was, there they would be both; When the stout Earle of Huntingdon, to win Trust with his friends; doth this himselfe enlarge To this great Earle who dares him thus to charge. My Lord (quoth he) it is not that I feare, More then your selfe, that so I have not gone; But that I have beene forced to be neare The King, whose person I attend upon, And that I doubt not but to make appeare Now, if occasion shall but call me on; Looke round about my Lord, if you can see, Some brave adventure worthy you and me. A desperate attempt by the Earle of Huntingdon.See yan proud Banner, of the Duke of Barres, Me thinkst it wafts us, and I heare it say, Wher's that couragious Englishman that darres, Adventure, but to carry me away, This were a thing, now worthy of our warres; I'st true, quoth Suffolke, by this blessed day, On, and weele have it, sayst thou so indeed, Quoth Huntingdon, then Fortune be our speed. And through the Ranckes then rushing in their pride, They make a Lane; about them so they lay, Foote goes with foote, and side is joynde to side, They strike downe all that stand within their way, And to direct them have no other guide, But as they see the multitude to sway; And as they passe, the French as to defie, Saint George for England and the King they cry. By their examples, each brave English blood, Upon the Frenchmen for their Ensignes runne, One brave exploit begetteth another. Thicke there as trees within a well-growne wood; Where great Atchiements instantly were done, Against them toughly whilst that Nation stood, But ô what man his destinie can shunne, That Noble Suffolke there is overthrowne, The Earle of Suffolke slaine. When he much valour sundry wayes had showne. Which the proud English further doth provoke, Who to destruction bodily were bent, That the maine Battaile instantly they broke, Upon the French so furiously they went, And not an English but doth scorne a stroake, If to the ground it not a Frenchman sent, Who weake with wounds, their weapons from them threw, The English kill the French with their owne Weapons. With which the English fearefully them slue. Alanzon backe upon the Reareward borne, By those unarm'd that from the English fled, All further hopes then utterly forlorne, His Noble heart in his full Bosome bled; What Fate, quoth he, our overthrowe hath sworne, Must France a Prisoner be to England led, Well, if she be so, yet Ile let her see, She beares my Carkasse with her, and not me. And puts his Horse upon his full Careere, When with the courage of a valiant Knight (As one that knew not, or forgot to feare) He tow'rds King Henry maketh in the fight, And all before him as he downe doth beare, Upon the Duke of Glocester doth light: Which on the youthfull Chivalry doth bring, Scarse two Pykes length that came before the King. Their Staves both strongly rivetted with steele, At the first stroke each other they astound, That as they staggering from each other reele; The Duke of Glocester overthrowne by the Duke of Alanzon.The Duke of Gloster falleth to the ground: When as Alanzon round about doth wheele, Thinking to lend him his last deadly wound: In comes the King his Brothers life to save, And to this brave Duke, a fresh on-set gave. When as themselves like Thunderbolts they shot, One at the other, and the Lightning brake Out of their Helmets, and againe was not, E'r of their strokes, the eare a sound could take Betwixt them two, the Conflict grew so hot, Which those about them so amaz'd doth make, That they stood still as wondring at the sight, And quite forgot that they themselves must fight. Upon the King Alanzon prest so sore, The King of England in danger to be slaine, by the Duke of Alanzon.That with a stroke (as he was wondrous strong) He cleft the Crowne that on his Helme he wore, And tore his Plume that to his heeles it hong: Then with a second brus'd his Helme before, That it his forehead pittifully wroong: As some that sawe it certainly had thought, The King therewith had to the ground beene brought. But Henry soone Alanzons Ire to quit, Alanzon beaten downe by the King of England.(As now his valour lay upon the Rack) Upon the face the Duke so strongly hit, As in his Saddle layde him on his back, And once perceiving that he had him split, Follow'd his blowes, redoubling thwack on thwack: Till he had lost his Stirups, and his head Hung where his Horse was like thereon to tread. When soone two other seconding their Lord, The King killeth two Gentlemen that adventure to rescue the Duke.His kinde Companions in this glorious prize, Hoping againe the Duke to have restor'd, If to his feet his Armes would let him rise: On the Kings Helme their height of fury scor'd; Who like a Dragon fiercely on them flies, And on his body slew them both, whilst he Recovering was their ayde againe to be. The King thus made the Master of the Fight: The Duke calls to him as he there doth lye: Henry I'le pay my Ransome, doe me right: I am the Duke Alanzon; it is I. The King to save him putting all his might, Yet the rude Souldiers with their showt and crie, The Duke Alanzon slaine. Quite drown'd his voyce, his Helmet being shut, And that brave Duke into small peeces cut. Report once spred, through the distracted Host, Of their prime hope, the Duke Alanzon slayne: That flower of France, on whom they trusted most: They found their valour was but then in vayne: Like men their hearts that utterly had lost, Who slowly fled before, now ranne amayne. Nor could a man be found, but that dispaires Seeing the Fate both of themselves and theirs. The Duke Nevers, now in this sad retreat, The Duke Nevers taken prisoner. By David Gam and Morisby persude, (Who throughly chaf'd, neere melted into sweat, And with French blood their Poleaxes imbrud) They sease upon him following the defeate, Amongst the faint, and fearefull multitude; When a contention fell betweene them twaine, Morisby and Gam at contention for the Duke of Neveres. To whom the Duke should rightfully pertaine. I must confesse thou hadst him first in chase, Quoth Morrisby; but lefts him in the throng, Then put I on; quoth Gam, hast thou the face, Insulting Knight, to offer me this wrong; Quoth Morisby, who shall decide the case, Let him confesse to whom he doth belong; Let him (quoth Gam) but if't be not to me, For any right you have, he may goe free. With that couragious Morrisby grew hot, Morisby a brave young Knight. Were not said he his Ransome worth a pin, Now by these Armes I weare thou gett'st him not: Or if thou do'st, thou shalt him hardly win; Gam whose Welch blood could hardly brooke this blot, David Gam oft mentioned in this Poem. To bend his Axe upon him doth begin: He his at him, till the Lord Beamount came Their rash attempt, and wisely thus doth blame. Are not the French twice trebl'd to our power, And fighting still, nay, doubtfull yet the day: Thinke you not these us fast enough devowre: But that your braves the Army must dismay: If ought but good befall us in this howre: This be you sure your lyves for it must pay: Then first the end of this dayes Battaile see, And then decide whose prisoner he shall be. The Duke of Excester commeth in with the Reare.Now Excester with his untaynted Reare Came on, which long had labour'd to come in: And with the Kings mayne Battell up doth beare; Who still kept off, till the last houre had bin: He cryes and clamours ev'ry way doth heare: But yet he knew not which the day should win: Nor askes of any what were fit to doe, But where the French were thick'st, he falleth to. The Earle of Vandom certainly that thought, The English fury somewhat had beene stayde: Weary with slaughter as men over-wrought, Nor had beene spurr'd on by a second ayde: For his owne safety, then more fiercely fought, Hoping the tempest somewhat had beene layde: And he thereby (though suff'ring the defeate, Might keepe his Reareward whole in his Retreate. On whom the Duke of Excester then fell, Reare with the Reare now for their Valours vy, Ours finde the French their lyves will dearely sell; And th'English meane as dearely them to buy: The English follow, should they runne through hell, And through the same the French must, if they flye, When too't they goe, deciding it with blowes, With th'one side now, then with th'other't goes. But the sterne English with such luck and might, (As though the Fates had sworne to take their parts) Upon the French prevailing in the Fight, With doubled hands, and with re-doubled harts, The more in perill still the more in plight, Gainst them whom Fortune miserably thwarts: Disabled quite before the Foe to stand, But fall like grasse before the Mowers hand. That this French Earle is beaten on the Field, His fighting Souldiers round about him slaine; And when himselfe a Prisoner he would yeeld, The Earle of Vandome slaine. And beg'd for life, it was but all in vaine; Their Bills the English doe so easely weeld To kill the French, as though it were no paine; For this to them was their auspicious day, The more the English fight, the more they may. When now the Marshall Boucequalt, which long Had through the Battaile waded ev'ry way, Oft hazarded the murther'd Troupes among, Encouraging them to abide the day: Finding the Army that he thought so strong, Before the English faintly to dismay, Brings on the wings which of the rest remain'd, With which the Battaile stoutly he maintain'd. Till olde Sir Thomas Erpingham at last, Sir Thomas Erpingham getteth in with his three hundred Archers. With those three hundred Archers commeth in, Which layd in ambush not three houres yet past; Had the Defeat of the French Army bin, With these that noble Souldier maketh hast, Lest other from him should the honour win: Who as before now stretch their well-wax'd strings, At the French Horse then comming in the wings. The soyle with slaughter ev'ry where they load, Whilst the French stoutly to the English stood, The drops from eithers emptied veynes that flow'd, Where it was lately firme had made a flood: But heav'n that day to the brave English ow'd; The Sunne that rose in water, set in blood: Nothing but horrour to be look'd for there, And the stout Marshall vainely doth but feare. His Horse sore wounded whilst he went aside, The Marshall of France slaine. To take another still that doth attend, A shaft which some too-lucky hand doth guide, Peircing his Gorget brought him to his end; Which when the proud Lord Falkonbridge espide, Thinking from thence to beare away his friend, Strucke from his Horse, with many a mortall wound, Is by the English nayled to the ground. The Marshalls death so much doth them affright, That downe their weapons instantly they lay, And better yet to fit them for their flight, Their weightier Armes, they wholly cast away, Their hearts so heavy, makes their heeles so light, That there was no intreating them to stay, Ore hedge and ditch distractedly they take, And happiest he, that greatest haste could make, Count Vadamount.When Vadamount now in the Conflict mett, With valient Brabant, whose high valour showne That day, did many a blunted Courage whett, Else long before that from the Field had flowne, Quoth Vadamount, see how we are besett, The Duke of Brabant a most couragious Prince.To death like to be troden by our owne, My Lord of Brabant, what is to be done? See how the French before the English runne. A bitter exclamation of the Duke of Brabant against the French.Why, let them runne and never turne the head, Quoth the brave Duke, untill their hatefull breath Forsake their Bodies, and so farre have fled, That France be not disparadg'd by their death: Who trusts to Cowards ne'r is better sped, Be he accurst, with such that holdeth faith, Slaughter consume the Recreants as they flye, Branded with shame, so basely may they dye. Ignoble French, your fainting Cowardize craves The dreadful curse of your owne Mother earth, Hardning her breast, not to allow you graves, Be she so much ashamed of your birth; May he be curst that one of you but saves, And be in France hereafter such a dearth Of Courage, that men from their wits it feare, A Drumme, or Trumpet when they hap to heare. From Burgundy brought I the force I had, Anthony Duke of Brabant, sonne to the Duke of Burgundy.To fight for them, that ten from one doe flye; It splits my breast, O that I could be mad; To vexe these Slaves who would not dare to dye: In all this Army is there not a Lad, Th'ignoble French for Cowards that dare crye: If scarce one found, then let me be that one, The English Army that oppos'd alone. This said, he puts his Horse upon his speed, And in, like lightning on the English flewe: Where many a Mothers sonne he made to bleed, Whilst him with much astonishment they viewe: Where having acted many a Knight-like deed, Him and his Horse they all to peeces hewe: Yet he that day more lasting glory wan, The valiant Duke of Brabant slaine. Except Alanzon then did any man. When as report to great King Henry came, Of a vast Route which from the Battaile fled, (Amongst the French most men of speciall name) By the stout English fiercely followed; Had for their safety, (much though to their shame) Many of the French in their flight get into an old Fort. Got in their flight into so strong a sted, So fortifi'd by nature (as 'twas thought) They might not thence, but with much blood be brought. An aged Rampire, with huge Ruines heapt, Which serv'd for Shot, gainst those that should assayle, Whose narrow entrance they with Crosbowes kept, Whose sharpned quarres came in show'rs like hayle: Quoth the brave King, first let the field be swept, And with the rest we well enough shall deale; The Kings slight answer. Which though some heard, and so shut up their eare, Yet relish'd not with many Souldiers there. Some that themselves by Ransomes would enrich, (To make their pray of Pesants yet dispise) Felt as they thought their bloody palmes to itch, To be in action for their wealthy prize: Others whom onely glory doth bewitch, Rather then life would to this enterprize: Most men seem'd willing, yet not any one Would put himselfe this great exployt upon. Which Woodhouse hearing meerily thus spake, (One that right well knew, both his worth and wit) Woodhouse jeereth at the attempt. A dangerous thing it is to undertake A Fort, where Souldiers be defending it, Perhaps they sleepe, and if they should awake, With stones, or with their shafts they may us hitt, And in our Conquest whilst so well we fare, It were meere folly, but I see none dare. Which Gam o'r hearing (being neere at hand) Not dare quoth he, and angerly doth frowne, Braves passe between Gam and Woodhouse.I tell thee Woodhouse, some in presence stand, Dare propp the Sunne if it were falling downe, Dare graspe the bolt from Thunder in his hand, And through a Cannon leape into a Towne; I tell thee, a resolved man may doe Things, that thy thoughts, yet never mounted to. I know that resolution may doe much, Woodhouse replyes, but who could act my thought, With his proud head the Pole might easely tuch, And Gam quoth he, though bravely thou hast fought, Yet not the fame thou hast attain'd too, such, But that behind, as great is to be bought, And yonder tis, then Gam come up with me, Where soone the King our Courages shall see. Agreed quoth Gam, and up their Troopes they call, Hand over head, and on the French they ran, And to the fight couragiously they fall, When on both sides the slaughter soone began; Fortune awhile indifferent is to all, These what they may, and those doe what they can, Woodhouse and Gam, upon each other vye, By Armes their manhood desperatly to try. To clime the Fort the Light-Arm'd English strive, And some by Trees there growing to ascend; The French with Flints let at the English drive, Captaine Gam slaine.Themselves with Shields the Englishmen defend, And faine the Fort downe with their hands would rive: For this service done by Woodhouse, there was an addition of honour given him: which was a hand holding a Club: with the word, Frappe Fort, which is born by the Family of the Woodhouse of Norfolke, to this day.Thus either side their utmost power extend, Till valiant Gam sore wounded, drawne aside By his owne Souldiers, shortly after dy'de. Then take they up the bodies of the slaine, Which for their Targets ours before them beare, And with a fresh assault come on againe; Scarse in the Field yet, such a fight as there, Crosse-bowes, and Long-bowes at it are amaine, Until the French their massacre that feare, Of the fierce English, a cessation crave, Offring to yeeld, so they their lives would save. Lewis of Burbon in the furious heat Of this great Battaile, having made some stay, Who with the left wing suffered a defeate, In the beginning of this lucklesse day, Finding the English forcing their retreat, And that much hope upon his valour lay, Fearing lest he might undergoe some shame, That were unworthy of the Burbon name. Hath gathered up some scattred Troopes of Horse, That in the Field stood doubtfull what to doe; Though with much toyle, which he doth reinforce With some small power that he doth add thereto, Proclaiming still the English had the worse, And now at last, with him if they would goe, He dares assure them Victory, if not The greatest fame that ever Souldiers gott. And being wise, so Burbon to beguile The French, (preparing instantly to fly) Procures a Souldier, by a secret wile A devise of Burbons to give incouragement to the French. To come in swiftly and to crave supply, That if with Courage they would fight awhile, It certaine was the English all should dye, For that the King had offered them to yeeld, Finding his troopes to leave him on the Field. When Arthur Earle of Richmount comming in, With the right wing that long staid out of sight, Having too lately with the English bin, But finding Burbon bent againe to fight, His former credit hoping yet to winn, (Which at that instant easily he might) Comes close up with him, and puts on as fast, Bravely resolv'd to fight it to the last. And both encourag'd by the newes was braught Of the ariving of the Daulphins power; Whose speedy Van, their Reare had almost raught, (From Agincourt discover'd from a Tower) Which with the Norman Gallantry was fraught, And on the suddaine comming like a shower; Would bring a deluge on the English Host, Whilst yet they stood their victory to boast. And one they come, as doth a rowling tide, Forc'd by a winde, that shoves it forth so fast, A simily of the French.Till it choke up some chanell side to side, And the craz'd banks doth downe before it cast, Hoping the English would them not abide, Or would be so amated at their hast, That should they faile to route them at their will, Yet of their blood, the fields should drinke their fill. When as the English whose o'r-wearied Armes, Were with long slaughter lately waxed sore, These inexpected, and so fierce Alarmes, To their first strength doe instantly restore, And like a Stove their stifned sinewes warmes, To act as bravely as they did before; And the proud French as stoutly to oppose, Scorning to yeeld one foote despight of blowes. The fight is fearefull, for stout Burbon brings His fresher forces on with such a shocke, That they were like to cut the Archers strings E're they their Arrowes hansomly could nock, The French like Engines that were made with springs: Themselves so fast into the English lock, That th'one was like the other downe to beare, In wanting roomth to strike, they stood so neare. Till staggering long they from each other reel'd, Glad that themselves they so could disingage: And falling back upon the spacious field (For this last Sceane, that is the bloody Stage) Where they their Weapons liberally could weeld, They with such madnesse execute their rage; As though the former fury of the day, To this encounter had but beene a play. Slaughter is now desected to the full, Here from their backs their batter'd Armors fall, Here a sleft shoulder, there a cloven scull, There hang his eyes out beaten with a mall, Untill the edges of their Bills growe dull, Upon each other they so spend their gall, Wilde showtes and clamors all the ayre doe fill, The French cry tue, and the English kill. The Duke of Barre in this vast spoyle by chance; With the Lord Saint-John on the Field doth meete, Tow'rds whom that brave Duke doth himselfe advance, Who with the like encounter him doth greete: This English Barron, and this Peere of France, Grapling together, falling from their feete, With the rude crowdes had both to death beene crusht, In for their safety, had their friends not rusht. Both againe rais'd, and both their Souldiers shift, To save their lyves if any way they could: But as the French the Duke away would lift, Upon his Armes the English taking hould, (Men of that sort, that thought upon their thrift) Knowing his Ransome dearely would be sould: Dragge him away in spight of their defence, Which to their Quarter would have borne him thence. Meane while brave Burbon from his stirring Horse, Gall'd with an Arrow to the earth is throwne; By a meane Souldier seased on by force, Lewes of Burbon taken prisoner by a meane Souldier. Hoping to have him certainly his owne, Which this Lord holdeth better so then worse: Since the French fortune to that ebbe is growne, And he perceives the Souldier him doth deeme, To be a person of no meane esteeme. Berckley and Burnell, two brave English Lords, Flesht with French blood, and in their Valours pride, Above their Arm'd heads brandishing their swords, As they tryumphing through the Army ride, Finding what prizes Fortune here affords To ev'ry Souldier, and more wistly eyde This gallant prisoner, by his Arming see, Of the great Burbon family to be. And from the Souldier they his Prisoner take, Of which the French Lord seemeth wondrous faine Thereby his safety more secure to make: Which when the Souldier findes his hopes in vaine, Lewes of Burbon stabd by the Souldier that took him prisoner. So rich a Booty forced to forsake, To put himselfe, and prisoner out of paine: He on the suddaine stabs him, and doth sweare, Would th'ave his Ransome, they should take it there. When Rosse and Morley making in amaine, Bring the Lord Darcy up with them along, Whose Horse had lately under him beene slaine; And they on foote found fighting in the throng, Those Lords his friends remounting him againe, Being a man that valiant was and strong: They altogether with a generall hand, Charge on the French that they could finde to stand. And yet but vainely as the French suppos'd, For th'Earle of Richmount forth such earth had found, That one two sides with quick-set was enclos'd, And the way to it by a rising ground, By which a while the English were oppos'd, At every Charge which else came up so round, As that except the passage put them by, The French as well might leave their Armes and flye. Upon both parts it furiously is fought, And with such quicknesse riseth to that hight, That horror neede no further to be sought: If onely that might satisfie the sight, Who would have fame full dearely here it bought, For it was sold by measure and by waight, And at one rate the price still certaine stood, An ounce of honour cost a pound of blood. The Lords Dampier and Savesses taken prisoners.When so it hapt that Dampier in the Van, Meetes with stout Darcy, but whilst him he prest, Over and over commeth horse and man, Of whom the other soone himselfe possest: When as Savesses upon Darcy ran To ayde Dampier, but as he him adrest; A Halbert taking hold upon his Greaves, Him from his Saddle violently heaves. When soone five hundred Englishmen at Armes, That to the French had given many a chase; And when they covered all the Field with swarmes; Yet oft that day had bravely bid them base: Now at the last by raising fresh Alarmes; And comming up with an unusuall pace, Made them to know, that they must runne or yeeld, Never till now the English had the Field. Where Arthur Earle of Richmount beaten downe, Is left (suppos'd of ev'ry one for dead) But afterwards awaking from his swoone, Arthur Earle of Richmount taken prisoner. By some that found him, was recovered: So Count Du Marle was likewise overthrowne: The Count du Marle slaine. As he was turning meaning to have fled, Who fights, the colde blade in his bosome feeles, Who flyes, still heares it whisking at his heeles. Till all disrank'd, like seely Sheepe they runne, By threats nor prayers, to be constrain'd to stay; For that their hearts were so extreamely done, That fainting oft they fall upon the way: Or when they might a present perill shunne, They rush upon it by their much dismay, That from the English should they safely flye, Of their owne very feare, yet they should dye. Some they take prisoners, other some they kill, As they affect those upon whom they fall: For they as Victors may doe what they will: For who this Conqueror to account dare call, In gore the English seeme their soules to swill, And the dejected French must suffer all; Flight, cords, and slaughter, are the onely three, To which themselves subjected they doe see. A shoolesse Souldier there a man might meete, Leading his Mounsier by the armes fast bound: Another, his had shackled by the feete; The misery of the French. Who like a Cripple shuffled on the ground; Another three or foure before him beete, Like harmefull Chattell driven to a pound; They must abide it, so the Victor will, Who at his pleasure may, or save, or kill. That brave French Gallant, when the fight began, Whose lease of Lackies ambled by his side, Himselfe a Lacky now most basely ran, Whilst a rag'd Souldier on his Horse doth ride, That Rascall is no lesse then at his man, Who was but lately to his Luggadge tide; And the French Lord now courtsies to that slave, Who the last day his Almes was like to crave. And those few English wounded in the fight, They force the French to bring with them away, The French forced to beare the wounded English on their backs.Who when they were depressed with the weight, Yet dar'd not once their burthen downe to lay, Those in the morne, whose hopes were at their height, Are fallne thus lowe ere the departing day; With pickes of Halberts prickt in steed of goads, Like tyred Horses labouring with their Loads. But as the English from the Field returne, Some of those French who when the Fight began, Forsooke their friends, and hoping yet to earne, Pardon, for that so cowardly they ran, Assay the English Carridges to burne, Which to defend them scarsely had a man; For that their keepers to the field were got, To picke such spoyles, as chance should them alott. The Captaines of this Rascall cowardly Route, Were Isambert of Agincourt at hand, A crew of rascall French rifle the King of Englands Tents. Riflant of Clunasse a Dorpe there about, And for the Chiefe in this their base command, Was Robinett of Burnivile; throughout The Countrie knowne, all order to withstand, These with five hundred Peasants they had rais'd The English Tents, upon an instant seas'd. For setting on those with the Luggadge left, A few poore Sutlers with the Campe that went, They basely fell to pillage and to theft, And having rifled every Booth and Tent, Some of the sillyest they of life bereft, The feare of which, some of the other sent, Into the Army, with their suddaine cries, Which put the King in feare of fresh supplies. For that his Souldiers tyred in the fight, The French prisoners more in number then the English Souldiers.Their Prisoners more in number then they were, He thought it for a thing of too much weight, T'oppose freshe forces, and to gaurd them there. The Daulphins Powers, yet standing in their sight, And Burbons Forces of the field not cleere, These yearning cryes, that from the Caridge came, His bloud yet hott, more highly doth inflame, And in his rage he instantly commands, That every English should his prisoner kill, Except some fewe in some great Captaines hands Whose Ransomes might his emptyed Cofers fill, Alls one whose loose, or who is nowe in bonds, The English kill their prisoners. Both must one way, it is the Conquerers will. Those who late thought, small Ransoms them might free Saw onely death their Ransomes now must be. Accursed French, and could it not suffize, Expostulation. That ye but now bath'd in your native gore; But yee must thus infortunately rise, To drawe more plagues upon yee then before, And gainst your selfe more mischeife to divise, Then th'English could have, and set wide the dore, To utter ruine, and to make an end Of that your selves, which others would not spend. Their utmost rage the English now had breath'd, And their proud heartes gan somewhat to relent, Their bloody swords they quietly had sheath'd, And their strong bowes already were unbent, To easefull rest their bodies they bequeath'd, Nor farther harme at all to you they ment, And to that paynes must yee them needsly putt, The French cause of their owne massechre To draw their knives once more your throats to cutt. That French who lately by the English stood, And freely ask'd what ransome he should pay, Whoe somwhat coold, and in a calmer moode, A discriptyon of the Massachre in the foure following stanzas Agreed with him both of the some and day, Nowe findes his flesh must be the present foode, For wolves and Ravens, for the same that stay, And sees his blood on th'others sword to flowe, E'r his quicke sense could aprehend the blowe. Whilst one is asking what the bus'nesse is, Hearing (in French) his Country-man to crye: He who detaines him prisoner, answers this: Mounsier, the King commands that you must dye; This is plaine English, whilst he's killing his: He sees another on a French man flye, And with a Poleax pasheth out his braines, Whilst he's demanding what the Garboyle meanes. That tender heart whose chance it was to have, Some one, that day who did much valour showe, Who might perhaps have had him for his Slave: But equall Lots had Fate pleas'd to bestowe: He who his prisoner willingly would save, Lastly constrain'd to give the deadly blowe That sends him downe to everlasting sleepe: Turning his face, full bitterly doth weepe. Ten thousand French that inwardly were well, Save some light hurts that any man might heale: Even at an instant, in a minute fell, And their owne friends their deathes to them to deale. Yet of so many, very fewe could tell, Nor could the English perfectly reveale, The desperate cause of this disastrous hap, But even as Thunder kill'd them with a clap. How happy were those in the very hight, Of this great Battaile, that had bravely dyde, When as their boyling bosomes in the fight, Felt not the sharpe steele thorough them to slide: But these now in a miserable plight, Must in cold blood this massacre abide, Caus'd by those Villaines (curst alive and dead,) That from the field the passed morning fled. When as the King to Crowne this glorious day, Now bids his Souldiers after all this toyle, (No forces found that more might them dismay) Of the dead French to take the gen'rall spoyle, Whose heapes had well neere stopt up ev'ry way; For ev'n as Clods they cov'red all the soyle, Commanding none should any one controle, Catch that catch might, but each man to his dole. They fall to groping busily for gold, Of which about them the slaine French had store, They finde as much as well their hands can hold, Who had but silver, him they counted poore, Scarfes, Chaines, and Bracelets, were not to be told, So rich as these no Souldiers were before; Who got a Ring would scarsly put it on, Except therein there were some Radiant stone. Out of rich sutes the Noblest French they strip, And leave their Bodies naked on the ground, And each one fills his Knapsack or his Scrip; With some rare thing that on the Field is found: About his bus'nesse he doth nimbly skip, That had upon him many a cruell wound: And where they found a French not out-right slaine, They him a prisoner constantly retaine. Who scarse a Shirt had but the day before, Nor a whole Stocking to keepe out the cold, Hath a whole Wardrop (at command in store) In the French fashion flaunting it in gold, And in the Taverne, in his Cups doth rore, Chocking his Crownes, and growes thereby so bold, That proudly he a Captaines name assumes, In his gilt Gorget with his tossing Plumes. Waggons and Carts are laden till they crackt, With Armes and Tents there taken in the Field; For want of carridge on whose tops are packt, Ensignes, Coat-Armours, Targets, Speares, and Shields: Nor neede they convoy, fearing to be sackt; For all the Country to King Henry yeelds, And the poore Pesant helpes along to beare, What late the goods of his proud Landlord were. A Horse well furnisht for a present Warre: For a French Crowne might any where be bought, But if so be that he had any scarre, Though ne'r so small, he valew'd was at naught; With spoyles so sated the proud English are; Amongst the slaine, that who for pillage sought, Except some rich Caparizon he found, For a steele Saddle would not stoupe to ground. And many a hundred beaten downe that were, Whose wounds were mortall, others wondrous deepe, When as the English over-past they heare: And no man left a Watch on them to keepe, Into the Bushes, and the Ditches neare, Upon their weake hands and their knees doe creepe: But for their hurts tooke ayre, and were undrest, They were found dead, and buried with the rest. Thus when the King sawe that the Coast was clear'd, And of the French who were not slaine were fled: Nor in the Field not any then appear'd, That had the power againe to make a head: This Conquerour exceedingly is cheer'd, Thanking his God that he so well had sped, And so tow'rds Callice bravely marching on, Leaveth sad France her losses to bemoane. FINIS. The Battaile of Agincourt. THE MISERIES OF QUEENE MARGARITE. I sing a woman, and a powerfull Queene, Henry the sixt, the King of Englands Wife, The beauteous Margarite, whose misgovern'd spleene So many sorrowes brought upon her life; As upon womans never yet were seene, In the beginning of that fatall strife The family of Yorke sought under-hand to promove their title about that time. (Th'unlucky season) when the Yorkists saught To bring the Line of Lancaster to naught. It was the time of those great stirres in France, Their ancient Right that th'English had regain'd, After the second conquest of France by Henry the fift. But the proud French attributing to chance, What by meere Manhood stoutly ours obtain'd, Their late-falne Ensignes labour'd to advance, The Streetes with blood of either Nation stain'd: These strive to hold, those to cast off the yoke, Whilst Forts, and Townes flewe up to heaven in smoke. The neighbouring Princes greatly pittying then, The Christian blood in that long quarrell shed, Which had devour'd such multitudes of men, The Christian Princes seeke to make a peace between England and France. That the full earth could scarcely keepe her dead; Yet for each English, of her Natives ten: In zeale to peace these neighbouring Princes led: At Tours in Tourayne set them downe a Diet, (Could it be done) these clamorous fieuds to quiet. From th'Emperour, there Ambassadors arive, The Kings of Denmarke, Hungary, and Spaine, And that each thing they aptly might contrive, And both the Kings there largely might complaine. The Duke of Orleance, for the French doth strive To shew his greevance; William Poole againe, The Earle of Suffolke doth for England stand, Who steer'd the State then with a powerfull hand. A peace concluded for 18. monthes.For eighteene months they ratifie a peace, Twixt these proud Realmes, which Suffolke doth pursue With all his powers, with hope still to encrease, The same expir'd, that it should soone renew, For by his meanes, if so this warre might cease, Poole in this time of peace laboureth to conclude a Mariage betwixt the Lady Margarite and the King his Master.He had a Plot of which they never knew, To his intent, which if all things went right, Heele make the dull world to admire his might. For having seene faire Margarite in France, (That times bright'st beauty) being then but young, Her peircing eyes with many a subtile glance, Poole taken with the exceeding beauty of the Princesse.His mighty heart so forcibly had stung, As made him thinke if that he could advance, This mortall wonder, onely that among His rising Fortunes, should the greatest prove, If to his Queene, he could advance his love. Her eyes at all poynts Arm'd with those deceits, That to her sex are naturall every way, Which with more Art, shee as inticing baites, For this great Lord doth with advantage lay, As he againe that on her bosome waites, Had found that there, which could he come to sway, He would put faire as ever man did yet, Upon the height of Fortunes wheele to sit. Love and Ambition spurre him in such sort, As that (alone) t'accomplish his desire To fall with Phaæton he would thinke it sport, Though he should set the Universe on fire, Nor recks he what the world of him report, He must scorne that, who will dare to aspier, For through the Ayre his wings him way shall make, Though in his fall the frame of heaven he shake. Reyner descended from the Royall stem He had onely the title of these Kingdomes without any livelihood.Of France, the Duke of Anjou, stiled King Of Naples, Cicill, and Jerusalem, Although in them he had not any thing, But the poore tytle of a Diadem; Margarite Duke Ryners daughter.Seeing by Suffolke greater hopes to spring; Puts on his Daughter that great Lord to please Of Englands Counsailes who kept all the keyes. But strange encounters strongly him oppose, In his first entrance to this great Designe, Those men were mighty that against him rose, And came upon him with a Countermine, That he must now play cunningly, or lose: Cunning they were against him that combine, Plot above plot, doth straine aloft to tower. The conflict great, twixt pollicy and power. For Humfrey Duke of Gloster, stil'd the good, Englands Protector sought a match to make, With a faire Princesse, of as Royall blood, A motion of a mariage before by an Ambassadour with the Earle of Arminacks onely daughter. The Daughter of the Earle of Arminake, And his Crown'd Nephew: but stout Suffolke stood Still for his Mistrisse, nor will her forsake, But make her Henries Queene in spight of all: Or she shall rise, or Suffolke sweares to fall. By the French faction when she up is cride, Of all Angellique excellence the Prime, The high praises of the Princesse Margarites beauty. Who was so dull that her not Deifide, To be the onely Master-peece of time: The praise of her extended is so wide, As that thereon a man to heaven might clime: All tongues and eares inchanted with delite, When they doe talke, or heare of Margarite. And those whom Poole about his Prince had plac'd, And for his purpose taught the tricks of Court, Pooles followers placed about the king to worke his owne ends. To this great King, and many a time had grac'd, To make his eares more apt for their report, Having the time most diligently trac'd, And sawe these things succesfully to sort: Strike in a hand, and up together beare, To make faire Margarite Musick in his eare. Anjou a Dutchy, Mayne a County great, Of which the English long had beene possest, The Provinces in France given to Duke Reyner for his daughter. And Mauns a Citie of no small receite, To which the Duke pretended interest: For the conclusion, when they came to treate, And things by Poole were to the utmost prest, Are to Duke Reyner rendred up to hold, To buy a Hellen, thus a Troy was sold. When of an Earle, a Marquesse Poole is made, Then of a Marquesse, is a Duke created, For he at ease in Fortunes lap was layd, Poole created first from an Earle, Marquesse, and after Duke of Suffolke.To glorious actions wholly consecrated: Hard was the thing that he could not perswade, In the Kings favour he was so instated; Without his Suffolke who could not subsist, So that he ruled all things as he list. This with a strong astonishment doth strike, Th'amazed world which knew not what to say, The people exceedingly repine for the giving away of the Provinces.What living man but did the act mislike, If him it did not utterly dismay, That what with blood was bought, at push of Pike, Got in an age, giv'n in an houre away: Some largely speake, and some againe are dumbe, Wond'ring what would of this strange world become. As when some dreadfull Comet doth appeare, Athwart the heaven that throwes his threatning light, The peacefull people that at quiet were, A simily.Stand with wilde gazes wond'ring at the sight, Some Warre, some Plagues, some Famine greatly feare, Some falls of Kingdomes, or of men of might: The greeved people thus their judgements spend, Of these strange Actions what should be the end. When Suffolke Procurator for the King, Suffolke Procurator for the King.Is ship'd for France, t'espouse the beauteous Bride, And fitted to the full of every thing, Followed with Englands Gallantry and pride, (As fresh as is the bravery of the Spring) The marriage solemnized in the City of Towers.Comming to Towers, there sumptuously affide: This one, whose like no age had seene before, Whose eyes out-shone the Jewels that shee wore. Her reverent Parents ready in the place, As overjoy'd this happy day to see, The King and Queene the Nuptialls there to grace; The great concourse to honour the Solemnization.On them three Dukes, as their attendants be, Seven Earles, twelve Barons in their equipace, And twenty Bishops, whilst that onely shee, Like to the Rosy morning towards the rise, Cheeres all the Church, as it doth cheere the skies. Tryumphall Arches the glad Towne doth raise, And Tilts and Turneys are perform'd at Court, Conceited Masks, rich Banquets, witty playes, Besides amongst them many a pretty sport, Poets write Prothalamions in their praise, Untill mens eares were cloyd with the report, Of either sex, and who doth not delight To weare the Daysie for Queene Margarite. Margarite in French signifieth a Daysie. The Tryumphes ended, he to England goes With this rich Gem allotted him to keepe, Still entertained with most sumptuous showes, In passing thorough Normandy to Diepe, The Queene bravely intertained in passing through Normandy. Where like the Sea the concourse dayly flowes, For her departure whilst sad France doth weepe; And that the Ships their crooked Ancors waide, By which to England she must be convaide. And being fitted both for Winde and Tide, The King stayeth for the Queenes landing at Portsmouth. Out of the Harbour flyes this goodly Fleet, And for fayre Portsmouth their straight Course they plyde, Where the King staid his lovely Bride to meete; Yonder she comes when as the people cride, Busie with Rushes strewing every street, The brainelesse Vulgar little understand, The Horrid plagues that ready were to Land, Which but to soone all seeing heaven foretold, For she was scarsely safely put a Shore, Great and fearefull Tempests at the comming in of the Queene. But that the skies (ô wondrous to behold) Orespread with lightning, hideously doe rore, The furious winds with one another scold, Never such Tempests had bene seene before, With suddaine floods whole Villages were drownd, Steeples with earthquakes tumbled to the ground. When to their purpose things to passe were brought, And these two brave ambitious spirits were mett, The Queene and Duke now frame their working thought, Into their hands the Soveraignety to get: For soone they found the King could not be wrought, Up to their ends, nature so low had set His humble heart; that what they would obtaine, Tis they must do't, by colour of his Raigne. And for they found the grieved Commons grutch, At this which Suffolke desperatly had done, Who for the Queene had parted with so much, Thereby yet nothing to the Realme had wonne. And those that spurr'd the people on, were such, As to oppose them openly begunne; Therefore by them some great ones downe must goe, Which if they mist of, they themselves must so. The Duke of Yorke discharged of his Regency in France, and the Duke of Sommerset in his place. Yorke then which had the Regency in France, They force the King, ignobly to displace, Thereto the Duke of Summerset t'advance, Their friend, and one of the Lancastrian Race; For they betwixt them turn'd the Wheele of Chance, Tis they cry up, tis they that doe debase, He's the first man they purpos'd to remove, The onely Minion of the peoples love. This opened wide the Publicke way, whereby Ruine rusht in upon the troubled Land, Under whose weight it hapned long to lye, Quite overthrowne with their ill-guiding hand; For their Ambition looking over-hie Could in no measure aptly understand, Upon their heads the danger that they drewe, Whose force too soone, they, and their Faction knew. For whilst this brave Prince was imploid abroad Th'affaires of France his minde up wholly tooke, But being thus disburthen'd of that load, Which gave him leave into himselfe to looke, The course he ranne in, evidently show'd, His late Alleageance that he off had shooke, And under hand his Title set on foote, To plucke their Red-Rose quite up by the roote. Thus having made a Regent of their owne, By whom they meane great matters to effect, For by degrees, they will ascend the throane, And but their owne all ayd they else neglect, As with a Tempest he to ground is blowne, On whom their rage doth any way reflect: Which good Duke Humphrey first of all must taste, Whose timelesse death intemperatly they haste. This Henryes Unckle, and his next of blood, Was both Protector of the Realme, and King, Whose meeknesse had instiled him the Good, Of most especiall trust in every thing; A Character of the Duke of Glocester. One to his Country constantly that stood, As Time should say, I forth a man will bring, So plaine and honest, as on him Ile rest, The age he liv'd in, as the onely best. This grave Protector who both Realmes had sway'd, Whilst the Kings nonage his sound Counsells crav'd, In his great wisdome when he throughly way'd, How this French Lady here her selfe behav'd, To make her Game againe, how Suffolke play'd, The Realmes from ruine, hoping to have sav'd, Lost his deare life, within a little space, Which overthrewe the whole Lancastrian race. This Prince, who still dar'd stoutly to oppose, Those whom he sawe, all but their owne to hate, Then found the league of his inveterate foes, To come upon him with the power of Fate, And things to that extremitie still rose, The certaine signe of the declining State, As that their Faction every day grew strong, Perceiv'd his Vertues like to suffer wrong. Fierce Margarits malice propt with mighty men, Her Darling Suffolke, who her forward drew, The greatest persons of the Queenes Faction. Proud Sommerset, of France the Regent then, And Bukkingham his power too well that knew, The Cardinall Beufort, and with him agen, Yorks great Arch-Prelate to make up the crue, By accusations doing all their best, From the good Duke all Goverment to wrest, Who then compell the peacefull King to call, A Parliament; their grievances to heare, Against the Duke that to inforce his fall, They might have some thing that might Colour beare, A Consultation had by the faction of the Queene, about the making away of the Duke. But then they doubt his answere, and withall, The murmuring people they farre more doe feare, As their owne lives who lov'd him, therefore they, Must cast to make him secretly away. And therfore with the Parliament proceede, Saint-Edmunds-bury the appointed place, Whereas they ment to doe the fatall deed, A Parliament at Saint Edmunds Bury.Which with much quicknesse should decide the case, The cruell maner soone they had decreed, And to the Act they hasten them apace; On this good Prince their purpose to effect, Then, when the people nothing should suspect. No sooner was this great assembly mett, The Duke of Glocester arested by the high Marshal of England.But the high Marshall doth the Duke arest, And on his person such a guard they sett, That they of him were certainely possest, His servants were from their attendance lett, And either sent to prison or supprest; The Duke murthered.So that their Lord left in this piteous plight, Lay'd in his Bed was strangled in the night. Then give they out that of mere greefe he dyde, To cover what they cruelly had done, But this blacke deede, when once the day discride; The frantique people to his Lodging runne, Some rayle, some curse, yea little children chide, The people mutiny.Which forc'd that faction the fayre streets to shunne; Some wish proud Suffolke sunke into the ground, Some bid a plague the cruell Queene confound. Thus their Ambition would not let them see, How by his death they hastened their decay, Nor let them know that this was onely he, Who kept the Yorkists evermore at bay, But of this man they must the murtherers be, The death of the Duke was the utter overthrow of the house of Lancaster.Upon whose life their safty onely lay; But his deare bloud, them nothing could suffice, When now began Queene Margarits Miseries. In either kingdome all thinges went to wracke, Which they had thought they could have made to thrive, His noble Counsells when they came to lacke, The affairs of England fall to ruine upon the death of the Duke.Which could them with facility contrive, Nor could they stay them in their going backe, One mischeefe still another doth revive; As heaven had sent an host of horrors out, Which all at once incompast them about. Out flie the Irish, and with sword and fire, Unmercied havocke of the English made; They discontented, here at home conspire, To stirre the Scott the Borders to invade: The Irishe rebell. The faithlesse French then having their desire, To see us thus in Seas of troubles wade, In every place outragiously rebell, The French are up in Armes. As out of France the English to expell. The sturdy Normans with high pride inflamd, Shake off the yoke of their subjection quite. Nor will with patience heare the English nam'd, Except of those that speake of them in spight, But as their foes them publikely proclaim'd, And their Alyes to open Armes excite; The Normans revolt. In every place thus Englands right goes downe, Nor will they leave the English men a Towne. New-castle, Constance, Maleon, and Saint-lo, With Castel-Galliard, Argenton, and Roane, Ponteu-de-mer with Forts and Cities moe, Townes in Normandy yeelded to the enemy. There had ben a former contract between the King and the Earle of Arminacks onely daughter; but being by the Duke of Suffolke annulled caused the Earle ever after to be a vowed enemy to the English. Then which that Contry stronger holds had none, Set ope their gates and bad the English goe, For that the French should then possesse their owne. And to their Armies, up their Forts they yeeld, And turne the English out into the Feeld. And that great Earle of Arminack againe, A puisant Peere and mighty in estate, Upon just cause, who tooke in high disdayne, To have his Daughter so repudiate, (His Contries bordring upon Aquitaine,) Pursues the English nation with such hate, As that he entred with his Armed powers, And from that Dutchy, drave all that was ours. Th'inraged commons ready are to rise, Upon the Regent, to his Charge and layd, The Commons charge the Duke of Somerset with the losse of Normandy. That from his slacknesse and base cowardize, These townes were lost, by his neglect of ayde, Then follow Suffolke with confused cryes, With Maine, and Anjou, and do him upbrayde, And vowe his life shall for their losses pay, Or at the stake, their goods and lives to lay. Articles of Treason put into the Parliament against the Dukes of Summerset and Suffolke.In th'open Session and Articulate, Seven Severall Treasons urg'd against them both, As most pernitious members of the State, Which was confirmed by the commons oath, So that the King who saw the peoples hate, The Duke of Suffolke banished for five yeeres.(In his owne selfe though he were very loath) To both the houses lastly doth assent, To set on Suffolke five yeares banishment. His Soveraigne Lady Suffolke thus must leave, And shee her Servant, to her soule so deare, Yet must they both conceale what they conceive, Which they would not if any helpe there were, Yet of all comfort they cannot bereave Her, but this hope her pensive heart doth cheere, That he in France shall have his most resort, And live securely in her fathers Court. His mighty minde nor can this doome molest, But kicks the earth with a disdainfull scorne, If any thing doe corosive his brest, It was, that he was in base England borne, He curst the King, and Kingdome, but he blest The Queene, but if in any thing forlorne, Tw'as that he should her happy presence misse, The endlesse Summe of all his earthly blisse. His Sentence, scarce in Parliament had past, The extreame hate the people had to the Duke.But that the Rascall multitude arize, Plucke downe his houses, lay his Lordships wast, And search how they his person may surprise, That he from England instantly must hast, Cover'd by night, or by some strange disguise, And to some small Port secretly retyre, And there some poore Boate for his passage hire. This ship was (as our histories report) caled the Nicolas of the tower, a ship that belong'd to the Duke of Excester, of whome one Water was the Captaine.From Harwitch Haven and embarqu'd for France, As he for Callice his straight course doth steere, (O heare behould a most disastrous chance,) A man of warre the Seaes that scoured there, One at his actions that still lookt ascance, And to this Duke did deadly hatred beare; After a long chase tooke this little Craye, Which he suppos'd him safly should convaye. And from the fisher taking him by force, He under Hatches straightly him bestow'd, And towards his country steering on his course, He runnes his vessell into Dover roade, Where rayling on him without all remorse, Him from the shippe to all the people show'd, And when no more they could the Duke deride, They cutt his head off on the Cock boate-side. Suffolke thus dead and Sommerset disgrac'd, His title Yorke more freely might preferre, The Commons love, when cunningly to taste, (Lest overweening he perhaps might erre,) He first subbornes a villaine that imbrac'd, The Nobler name of March-borne Mortimer, The subtile policie of the Duke of York Which in the Title of the house of Yorke; Might set the monstrous multitude a worke. His name was Cade, his native contry Kent, Who, though of birth, and in estate but poore, Yet for his courage he was eminent; The carracter of Jacke Cade. (Which the wise Duke well understood before,) He had a minde was of a large extent, The signe whereof on his bould brow he bore, Sterne of behavior, and of body strong, Witty, well spoken, cautilous, though young. But for the Duke his title must derive, Deriving his title from Phillip the only daughter and hayre of Lyonel Duke of Clarence the 3. sonne of Ed. the 3. wedded to Edmund Mortimer Earle of March. Out of the bloud which beare that honored name, Therefore must cast and conningly contrive, To see how people relished the same, And if he found it fortuned to thrive, Then at the marke he had a further ayme, To show himselfe his title good to make, And raise him friends and power, his part to take. All opposition likewise to prevent, The crafty Duke his meaning doth conceale, And Cade doth rise t'reforme the government, And base abuses of the Publique Weale, To which he knew the Commons would consent, Which otherwise his Treason might reveale; Which rightly tooke, for by this colour he Drew twenty thousand on his part to be. From Sussex, Surry, and from Kent that rose, Whom hope of spoile doth to this act perswade, Which still increase his Army as it goes, And on Blacke Heath his Rendavous he made, Where in short time it to that vastnesse growes, As it at once the Kingdome would invade, And he himselfe the Conquest could assure; Of any power king Henry could procure. And did in fight that generall force defeate, Sent by the King that Rebell to pursue, When under couler of a fain'd retreat, He made as though he from the Army flew, The Staffords slaine by the Rebells.The slaughter of the souldiers must be great, When he those Staffords miserably slewe. Captaines select, and chosen by the Queene; To lead the powers that should have wreakt her teene. When for a Siedge he to the City came, Assaults the Bridge with his emboldned power, And after oft repulsed takes the same, Jhacke Cade takes London.Makes himselfe master of the Towne and Tower, Doing such things as might the Divell shame, Destroyes Records, and Virgins doth deflower, Robbs, ransackes, spoiles, and after all this stirre, Lastly, beheaded the Lord Treasurer. These things by Yorke being plotted underhand, Wise as he was, as one that had not knowne, Ought of these Treasons, hasts to Ireland, To tame those The vulgar. Kerne, rebellious that were growne; He knew it was not in the barren Sand, That he this subtile poysnous seed had sowne, Which came it on (as very well it might) It would make way for his pretended right. Whilst these Rebellions are in England broacht, As though the Fates should enviously conspire Our utter Ruine; which too fast approacht, About our eares, was Aquitaine a fire: Their Conquest so upon our Townes incroacht, That Charles the French King then had his desire, To see these Troubles tyre us here within, That he the whilst, in France from us might winne. To add to Margarits miseries againe, Talbot in France so bravely that had done, Who many a yeare had aw'd proud Aquitaine, And many a Fort, and famous Battaile wonne, The valient Talbot slaine. At Shatiloon (O endlesse griefe) was slaine With the Lord Lyle his overvalient Sonne, When all the Townes that he had got before, Yeelded, nor would for England be no more, Yorke in the nike from Ireland comming in, Finding the Kingdome combred in this wise, Thinks with himselfe twere time he did begin, But by no meanes he gainst the King must rise; O such a thought in any man were sin, But that he would proud Somerset surprise, Yet wanting strength gainst the whole State to stand, He beares his businesse with a moderate hand. And first to mighty Salsbury doth sue, Richard Nevill the Father, and Richard Nevill the Son. And his Sonne Warwick, and doth them intreate With equall eyes they would be pleasde to view, His rightfull Title: these two Nevils great In power, and with the people, whom he knew, Deadly the Duke of Somerset to hate, By his large offers he doth winne at last, In his just quarrell to cleave to him fast. Thus his Ambition having strongly backt, With these two fatall fierbrands of Warre; To his desires, there very little lackt, He and the Earles, all three so popular, To advance himselfe he no occasion slackt, For nought he sees him from his ends to barre, Tis no small tempest that he need to feare, Whom two such Collumnes up betwixt them beare. And by their strengthes encourag'd doth not sticke, The others actions boldly to o're looke, And for the season that the King was sicke, Upon himselfe the Regencie he tooke, For now his hopes upon him came so thicke, His entrance, dores from off the hindges shooke. He with a nodde the Realme seem'd to direct, Whose he but bow'd, if this great Prince but beckt. And in the Queenes great Chamber doth arest, Great Summerset, and sendeth him to ward, And all his followers suddenly supprest, The duke of Summerset arested.Such was the number of his powerfull guard, With the proud Queene, this Prince as proude contests, Not for her frowne one friend of hers he spar'd, Lucks on his side, while such stand by to bett, Hee'le throw at all that any one dare sett. The Queene who saw, which way this Faction went, And that these wrongs must still reflect on her, The Duke of Yorke to her distruction bent; Thought with her selfe it was full time to stirre, And if his plotts she ever would prevent, Must with the wisest of her friends conferre, Their busie braynes, and must together beate, To lessen him, like else to grow too great. His pride awhile yet patiently endure, The kinges recovery onely to attend, Of which themselves they hardly could assure, The King recovered of a dangerous sicknesse.Who once they thought had hastned to his end, But when they found his Phisicke to procure, His former health, then doth the Queene extend, Her utmost strength, to let the world to know, Queene Margarite yet, must not be mastred so. With smiles and kisses when shee wooes the King, That of his place the Duke he would discharge, Which being done, the next espetiall thing, The Queene prevailing against the Duke of York.She doth the Duke of Sommerset inlarge, And him of Callice gives the governing, Whither his friends she causd him to inbardge, Doubting the love, and safeguard of the Towne, Thus doth the Queene turne all thinges upsidedowne. Which so incenst the angry Duke to ire, With those two Earles upon his part that take, Kindling in all that fierce revengefull fire, The Duke of Yorke raiseth an Army in the Marches of Wales.Which the deere blood of Summerset must slake, That into Wales they instantly retire: And in the Marches up an Army make: And there by Oath were each to other tyde, By dint of sword the quarrell to decide. And whilst these Lords are busied in the West, Of March-men mustring a rebellious Band, Henry againe his Southerne people prest: And settles there their forces to withstand: Then Bowes and Bills were onely in request: Such rage and madnesse doth possesse the Land: Set upon spoyle, on either part they were, Whilst the Weale-publike they in peeces teare. On either part when for this Warre prepar'd, Upon their March they at Saint Albans met, Where Drummes and Ensignes one the other dar'd, The first Battaile at Saint Albans. Whilst they in order their Battalions set, And with his fellow ev'ry Souldier shar'd, Bravely resolv'd to death to pay his debt: When if that ever horrour did appeare On th'English earth, it certainly was there. That day the Queenes lov'd Summerset was slaine, There tooke the stout Northumberland his end: There Staffords blood the pavement did distaine: Humfrey Earle of Stafford, eldest sonne to the Duke of Buckingham. There Clifford fell, King Henries constant friend: The Earle of Warwick who brought on the Mayne: All downe before him to pale Death doth send. Antwesell, Babthorp, Zouch, and Curwen, all King Henries friends, before the Yorkists fall. Whilst this distressed miserable King, Amazed much with fury of the fight, And perill still his person menacing: His living friends inforc'd to take their flight: He as a needlesse and neglected thing, In a poore Cottage hides him out of sight: The King crept into a poore cottage. Who found by Yorke was as a prisoner led, Though with milde words the Duke him comforted. And of his person being thus possest, They in his name a Parliament procure, For with his Regall power they will invest Themselves, supposing to make all things sure, That if their violent actions should be prest, In after time they better might endure The censuring, the worst, and so prevent To showe them done by Act of Parliament. And cause the King to take into his hands, What to the Crowne did anciently pertaine, Besides all Honours, Offices, and Lands, The lawlesse usurpation of the Yorkists.Granted since the beginning of his Raigne; And not a Fee, though ne'r so little stands; All are call'd in, and let who will complaine, And all his friends from Counsaile are remov'd, None must sit there, but those of them belov'd. The silly King a sipher set aside, What was in him that in great Yorke is not; Amongst themselves all places they divide, Salisbury made Chancelor.And to be Chancelor Salsbury hath got, He is the man must take the law to guide; Warwick Captaine of Callice.And Callice falls to warlike Warwicks lot, And not a man at these must looke awry, They make an Act, their Acts to justifie. This done, the Duke had more to doe then this; Something it seem'd, more secretly to lurke, In which such power (though from appearance) is, As yet once more would fret the Duke of Yorke, And let him know he of his ends might misse; For now the Queene doth set her wits to worke, To play the Game that must renowne her skill, And shew the law that rested in her will. And from the roote of Summerset late slaine, Another stem, to stand for her arose, Henry Beufort Duke of Summerset, after the decease of his father Edmond. Henry for Edmond, of his Fathers straine, (One of whose life she knew she could dispose) Of a strong judgement, and a working braine; Great Buckingham and Excester are those Shee meanes to worke by, and by these restore, Her to that height from whence she fell before. These were the men to whom she trusted most, To whom that faction much dispight had done, For at Saint Albans Summerset had lost His loved Sire, and Buckingham his Sonne: The Duke of Excester taken out of the Sanctuary at Westminster.And Excester pursude from Coast to Coast; From them enforc'd to Sanct'ary to runne: Fetcht thence by them, and to colde Pomfret sent, And in a dungeon miserably pent. Equall in envie, as in pride and power: With ev'ry ayde to their designment fraught: Taking their turnes at ev'ry fitting houre; They on the Kings much easinesse so wrought, As that they seem'd him wholly to devoure, Untill to passe their purposes they brought, Lifting up still his spirit that was so poore, Once more to doe as he had done before. For which at Greenwich he a Counsell held Where, with th'opinion of those friends supplide, The Duke of Yorke, the Earles of Salisbury and Warwick put out of office. Those three which late with glorious titles sweld, Are from their sev'rall places put aside; Yet more to seeke their safety are compeld, At this prodigious turning of the tide: For now the winde was strangely come about, And brings them in who lately were shut out. The cruell Queene and cunningly had cast, At Coventry to cause them to appeare, With shew to pardon all that had beene past, If they (but then) would their Allegiance sweare; Which had they done, that day had bene their last, For shee had plotted to destroy them there: Of which forewarnd, immediatly they fled, Which then their safety onely promised. Yet whilst one wrong, thus from another rose, Twixt them at last a Meeting was ordain'd, The Queene had plotted to have the Duke murthered at Coventry. All former strife and quarrels to compose, Which but too long betwixt them had remain'd, Which to the World though handsomely it showes, Yet in plaine truth, all was but meerely fain'd To outward seeming, yet are perfect friends: “But divellish folke, have still their divellish ends. And in precession solemnely they goe, In generall joy, one smiling on the other, A solemn precession in Pauls by both the factions A Yorkist and Lancastrian make up two, Envie and malice, brother, like to brother, In minde farre sundred, although coupled so, Bloudy revenge and in their brests they smother; Ill's the precession (and fore runs much losse, “Wherein men say, the Devill beares the Crosse.) These Rights of peace religiously perform'd To all mens thinking, the enraged Queene, At Warwicks greatnesse inwardly yet storm'd The Queene inwardly gruching at Warwickes greatnesse.(Which every day still more and more was seene,) Against the king, who Callice so had Arm'd, As it his owne inheritance had beene. Which towne she saw that if he still should hould, That shee by him must howrely be contrould. For which his murther she pursu'd so fast, As that shee soone and secretly had layd, Such to assault him, as the Streets he past, Warwicke in perill to have bin slaine passing the street.As if his brave name had not brought him ayde, He of her vengance had beene sure to tast, The Tragique Sceane so furiously was playd, That he from London was inforst to flye; Like a rough sea her mallice wrought so hye. And t'owards the Duke his speedy Journey takes, Who then at Middleham made his most aboad, Which Salsbury his habitation makes, Whereas their tyme together they bestow'd, Whose courages the Earle of Warwick wakes, When he to them his suddaine danger show'd With a pale visage, and doth there disclose, Her brands sett on him both in wounds and blowes. This wrong in counsell, when they had discust, And way'd the danger wherein still they were, Continuall Treasons shrouded in their trust, Nor other hopes else likely to appeare, They find that this might make a warre seeme just, And give their cause up to the world more cleere, To rise in Armes when they resolve at last, To raise them force, and wisely thus forecast. To muster up their Tenants and their friends, Not as a Warre upon the Land to bring, Nor to advance their owne sinister ends, Nor wrong a Subject in the smallest thing, Onely to guard them (as their case then stands) Till they had show'd their greevance to the King, And give their power to Salsbury to guide, That with the King the bus'nesse should decide. With this direction Salsbury is sent, Warwick to Callice (with what hast he may) By his much speed a mischiefe to prevent, Fearing the Towne might else be given away, The Duke of Yorke by generall consent, At Midleham Castell they alot to stay; To raise a second power (if neede should be) To re-inforce them, or to set them free. The Queene who heard (by such as were her owne) With that false Earle how those of Cheshire sided, As in short time how powerfull he was growne, Thinks with her selfe the Shire might be divided, If that her love to some of them were knowne, Which eas'ly might be, were her pleasure guided By some such person, of whose valour they, Had an opinion, which shee thus doth lay, Causing the King to give a large command, To James Lord Awdley, powerfull in those parts, To raise him force those Rebels to withstand; Such to their Soveraigne as had loyall harts, And to make Captaines over ev'ry Band, Men of the best blood, as of best desarts, Which he so laboured, till that he had brought That t'halfe of one house, gainst the other fought. So that two men arising from one bed, Falling to talke, from one another flye: The men of Cheshire divided in the quarell. This weares a white Rose, and that weares a red; And this a Yorke, that Lancaster doth crye: He wisht to see that Awdley well had sped: He prayes againe to prosper Salsbury: And for their farewell, when their leaves they take, They their sharpe swords at one another shake. This fire in ev'ry family thus set, Out goe the Browne Bills, with the well-strung Bowes, Till at Blore-heath these boystrous souldiers met, The Battaile at Blore-heath. For there it chanc'd the Armies then to close, This must not live, if that he strove to let; Never such friends yet ere became such Foes, With downe-right strokes they at each other lay, No word for Cheshire was, but kill, and slay. The Sonne (as some report) the Father slue, In opposition as they stoutly stood, The Nephew seene the Unckle to pursue, A great slaughter of Cheshire men.Bathing his sword in his owne naturall blood: The Brother in his Brothers gore imbrue His guilty hands, and at this deadly food: Kinsman kills Kinsman, which together fall, As hellish fury had possest them all. The Lord Audley slaine.Here noble Tutchet the Lord Audley dide, (Whose Father wan him such renowne in France) And many a Cheshire Gentleman beside, Fell at this Field by Warres uncertaine chance: These miseries Queene Margarite must abide, Whilst the proud Yorkists doe themselves advance: And poore King Henry on a Pallet lay, And scarcely ask'd which side had got the day. Thus valiant Audley at this Battaile slaine, And all those friends to the Lancastrians lost: Cheshire by her such domage to sustaine: So much deere blood had this late Conflict cost: Wherefore the greeved Queene with might and maine, Labours for life to raise a second Host: Nor time therein she meaneth to forslowe, Either shee'll get all, or will all forgoe. And whilst their friends them forces gathering were, (The neighbouring Realmes of this great bus'nesse ring) The Duke, and those, that to his part adhere Proclaymed Traytors; pardon promising To those at Blore that Armes did lately beare: So they would yet cleave to their lawfull King, Which drue in many to their part againe, To make their full, they Yorkists in their wane. Yorke who perceiv'd the puissant Host prepar'd, With his deare Nevils, Counsels what to doe, For it behov'd him, to make good his Guard With both their strengthes and all to little too; And in the Marches he no labour spar'd, To winne his friends along with him to goe: With expedition which he could not get, On the Kings side the Commons so were set. And being to meete so absolute a power, Yet wanting much his party good to make; And Henryes proclamations ev'ry howre: His Souldiers winne their Generall to forsake, Besides the storme which rais'd this suddaine shower: Them all in sunder likely was to shake: He sawe his safety to consist in flight: Thus e'r he wist, o'rmastred in his might. All on the Spurre for life away they post, Their homes too hot, nor there they might abide: The three brave Earles soone reach the Westerne Coast, Edward Earle of March, eldest sonne to the Duke, the Earles of Salsbury &amp; Warwicke. From whence to Callice their straight course they plyde: The Duke to Wales being there befriended most: Yet for more safety he to Ireland hyde: So others ship themselves from ev'ry bay, And happiest he that soon'st could get away. As when a Route of rave'nous Wolves are met, T'assayle some Heard the Desart pasturing neare, A Simily. The watchfull Clownes which over them are set, Oft taught before their Tiranny to feare, With dogges, with staves, and showts together get, Nor never leave till they their Chattell cleare: So the Kings power the Yorkists still pursue, Which like those Wolves before those Heardsmen flewe. They gone, the King at Coventry begun, A Parliament, by good advice, wherein, A Parliament at Coventry. The Duke of Yorke, with th'Earle of March his sonne, With Salsbury and Warwick who had bin Conspirators, much mischiefe and had done, And by whose helpe he hapt so much to win: He there attaynts of Treason, and bestowes All that was theirs, upon his friends, their foes. When now those Earles in Callice still that kept The charge whereof proud Warwick on him tooke: In their intended bus'nesse never slept: Nor yet their former enterprise forsooke, In t'Henryes Counsailes who had those that crept, And did each day his actions over-looke: From whom as their advertisements still are, So they their strengthes accordingly prepare. And in meane time the Kingdome to embroyle, That with lesse noyse their friends might raise an Host, They plague the Seas with Piracie and spoyle: And rob the Havens all along the Coast: They ne'r take pitty of their Native soyle: For that they knew this would avayle them most, That whilst the State was busied there about, Armes might be rais'd within, by those without. And slaughtering many that were set to warde Th'especiall Ports; th'unweldy Anchors wayde Of the Kings Ships, whose fraught as Prize they sharde, And them to Callice carefully convay'd With their stolne Fleet, and his great Navy darde, As late by Land, so now by Sea they sway'd: All in Combustion, and their bloody rage, Nor Sea, nor Land can possibly asswage. Then have they Forces rais'd for them in Kent, Their next and most convenient place to land, (Where should the Adverse power their hopes prevent, In Dover Road yet were their Ships at hand) And by their Posts still too and fro that went; They certainly were let to understand, That Kent was surely theirs, and onely stayde To rise in Armes the Yorkists power to ayde. When Falconbridge, who second brother was To Salsbury, they send away before, To see no Ships should out of Sandwich passe, To hinder them in comming to the shore; There of Munition tooke a wondrous Masse Heapt in that Towne, that with th'aboundant store, He Armed many at their comming in, Which of their side would scarsely else have bin. That they no sooner setled were on Land, The men of Kent rise with the Yorkists.But that in Armes th'rebellious Kentish rose, And the Lord Cobham with a mighty band, With their Calicians presently doth close; That now they sway'd all with a powerfull hand, And in small time so great their Armie growes From Sussex, Surry, and those parts about, That of her safety, London well might doubt. But yet at last the Earles shee in doth let, To whom the Clergy comming day by day, From further sheers them greater forces get, When towards Northampton making foorth their way, Where the sad King his Army downe had set, And for their comming onely made his stay, With all the force his friends could him afford, And for a fight with all things fitly stor'd. Who in his march the Earle doth oft molest, (By their Vauntcurrers hearing how he came) In many a straight, and often him distrest, By stakes and trenches that his Horse might lame, But the stout Yorkists still upon them prest: The name of Warwicke fearefull to his enemies. And still so fearefull was great Warwicks name, That being once cryde on, put them oft to flight, On the Kings Army till at length they light. When th'Earle of March then in the pride of blood, His Virgine valour on that day bestowes, And furious Warwick like a raging flood, Beares downe before him all that dare oppose, Olde Salsbury so to his tackling stood, And Fauconbridge so layes amongst his foes, That even like leaves, the poore Lancastrians fall, And the proud Yorkists beare away the Ball. There Humphrey Duke of Bukingham expir'd, A great slaughter of the Nobility at Northampton. King Henrys comfort and his causes friend, There Shrewsbury (even of his foes admir'd For his high courage) his last breath doth spend, Brave Beamout there, and Egremount lay tyr'd To death, there Lucy had his lucklesse end, And many a noble Gentleman that day, Weltring in gore, on the wilde Champion lay. The wretched King, as Fortunes onely scorne, His Souldiers slaine, and he of all forsaken, Left in his Tent; of men the most forlorne, (The second time) a Prisoner there is taken; The wofull Queene out of the Battaile borne In a deepe swound; and when she doth awaken, Nothing about her heares, but howles, and cries, Was ever Queenes like Margarites miseries? Yorke comming in from Ireland in the end, And to his hands thus findes the Battaile wonne, By the high Prowesse of his faithfull friend, Great Warwick, and that valiant March his sonne, His present hopes the former so transcend, That the proud Duke immediatly begun, By his bold Actions to expresse his thought, Through so much blood, what he so long had sought. The Kings Command'ment daring to denie, His Soveraigne Lord being call'd to wayte upon, The Duke of Yorks insolence.And on his Fortune beares himselfe so hie, That he in State presumes t'ascend his Throane: From the Kings Lodgings puts his Servants by, And placeth in them such as were his owne: So infinitely insolent he growes, As he the Crowne at pleasure would dispose. When he procures a Parliament with speed, In which himselfe Protector he doth make, And onely Heire apparent to succeed The King; when Death him from the world should take: And what had beene at Coventry decreed, He there annulls, from him and his to shake The servile yoke of all subjection quite, Downe goes the red Rose, and up goes the white. And he with Fortune that this while doth sport, Seeing the Southerne to him still were sure; Thinks to the North, if he should but resort, He to his part the Northerne should procure, Seeking all wayes his greatnesse to support: Nor would an equall willingly endure: Downe into Yorkshire doth to Sandall ride, Whose lofty scyte well suted with his pride. The Queene impatient of the Dukes Pride.The vexed Queene whose very soule forgot, That such a thing as patience it had knowne, And but she found her friends forsooke her not, As madde as ever Hecuba had growne, Whilst both her wrongs, and her revenge were hot, Her mighty minde, so downe could not be throwne, But that once more the bloody Sett sheele play With York, ere so he beare the Crowne away. And downe to Sandall doth the Duke pursue, With all the power her friends could her provide, Led by those Lords that had beene ever true, And had stood fast upon King Henrys side, With that most valient and selected crue, This brav'st of Queenes, so well her businesse plide, That comming soone in Sandals lofty sight, Into the Field she dares him forth to fight. And for this Conflict there came on with her Her hope Prince Henry, her deare onely Sonne, Stout Somerset, and noble Excester, Dukes, that for Margarite mighty things had done, Devon and Wilt, Earles using to conferre With this wise Queene, when Danger shee would Shunne; Undaunted Clifford, Rosse in warre up brought, Barrons as brave as ere in battaile fought. When this stout Duke who in his Castle stood, With Salisbury (who beat them all at Blore,) The Dukes haste the cause of his ruine. Both which were flesht aboundantly with bloud, In those three Battailes they had wonne before, Thought in their pride, it would be ever Flood, Nor gainst Queene Margarite that they needed more, For they led Fortune chain'd with them about, That of their Conquest none but fooles could doubt. And for the Field soone Marshalling their force, All poore delayes they scornefully defie, Nor will the Duke stay for those troopes of Horse, With which his Sonne him promist to supply, In spight of Fate they'll give their Foe the worse; On their owne valour they so much relye, And with five thousand marshald well they come, Meaning to charge the Queenes maine Battell home. But in her Host she having those that were Expert in all the Stratagems of Warre, To fight with him doe cause her to forbeare, Till from his Castle she had got him farre, Whilst in an ambush she had placed there: Wiltshire, and Clifford with their strengthes to barre Him from his home, in off'ring to retire, Or wound his back even as they would desire. When too't they fell upon an easie Plaine, At the hill foote, where furiously they fought Upon both sides where there were many slaine: But for the Queene, foure to his one had brought: The Duke of Yorke for all his pride was faine Back to recoyle, where he was finely caught, For Wilt and Clifford that in Ambush were, The Van thus rowted, overthrew the Reare. Where Yorke himselfe, who proudly but of late, With no lesse hope then of a Kingdome fed, Upon this Field before his Castle gate, Mangled with wounds, on his owne earth lay dead, Upon whose Body Clifford downe him sate, Stabbing the corpes, and cutting off his head, Crown'd it with paper, (and to wreake his teene) Presents it so to the victorious Queene. His Bastard Unckles both couragious Knights, Sir John, and Sir Hugh Mortimer so sped, Hall, Hastings, Nevill, who in sundry fights Had show'd their valour, on the field found dead: And Salsbury amongst these Tragick sights, The Earle of Salsbury beheaded.Who at Blore heath so much deare blood had shed, Taken a live, to Pomfret sent with speed, And for their bloods, himselfe there made to bleed. Some clime up Rocks, through Hedges other runne, There foes so roughly execute their rage, Where th'Earle of Rutland the Dukes youngest sonne, Then in his Childhood and of tender Age, Comming in hope to see the Battaile wonne, Clifford whose wrath no rigour could asswage, The end of young Rutland.Takes, and whilst there he doth for mercy kneele, In his soft bosome sheathes his sharpned steele. Edward of March, the Duke his Father slaine, Succeeding him, whilst things thus badly sort, Gathering an Army, but yet all in vaine, To ayde his Father, for he came too short, Hearing that Penbrooke with a Warlike trayne, Was comming tow'rds him, touch'd with the report, His valiant Marchers for the field prepares, To meete the Earle, if to approach he dares. Jasper by birth halfe Brother to the King, On bright Queen Katherine got by Owen Tether, Whom Henryes love did to this Earledome bring, And as from Wales descended sent him thither, And of South-Wales gave him the governing, Where in short time he got an Host together, Cleaving to Henry who did him prefer As an Alye to th'house of Lancaster. Upon their March when as they lastly met, Neere to the Crosse that Mortimer is nam'd, The Battell at Mortimers Crosse. Where they in order their Battalions set: The Duke and Earle with equall rage enflam'd, With angry eyes they one the other threat, Their deadly Arrowes at each other aym'd: And there a fierce and deadly fight begin, A bloodier Battell yet there had not bin. The Earle of Ormond, an Associate then, With this young Tudor, for the King that stood, Came in the Vanguard with his Irish men, With Darts, and Skaynes; those of the British blood, With Shafts and Gleaves them seconding againe, And as they fall, still make their places good, That it amaz'd the Marchers to behold, Men so ill Arm'd upon their Bowes so bold. Now th'Welch and Irish so their weapons weeld, As though themselves they Conquerours meant to call, Then are the Marchers Masters of the Field: With their browne Bills the Welchmen so they mall, Now th'one, now th'other likely were to yeeld: These like to flye, then those were like to fall, Untill at length (as Fortune pleas'd to guide) The Conquest turn'd upon the Yorkists side. Three Sunnes were seene that instant to appeare, Which soone againe shut up themselves in one, Ready to buckle as the Armies were, Three sunnes seene at one time. Which this brave Duke tooke to himselfe alone, His drooping hopes which some what seem'd to cheere, By his mishaps, neere lately overthrowne, So that thereby encouraging his men, Once more he sets the White-Rose up agen. Pembroke and Ormond save themselves by flight, Foure thousand Souldiers of both Armies dead, But the great losse on the Lancastrians light, So ill the Freinds of poore King Henry sped; Owen Tudors end.Where Owen Tudor taken in the flight, This yong Earles father, by Queene Katherins bed) At Hereford not farre away from thence, Where others with him dyde for their offence. This while the Queene, the Gole at Sandall gain'd Leades on tow'rds London her victorious Host, Whose blades she showes, with blood of Yorkists stain'd Nor of her Conquest can she leave to boast; But to her side, whilst lucky Fortune lean'd, Come, what can come, shee meanes to cleare the Coast, Of those shee knew in Yorks revenge would rise, Found she not meanes, their Forces to surprise. And at Saint Albans finding on her way, John Duke of Norfolke, and her divellish foe: Fierce Warwick who there with an Army lay, Which two, deceased Yorke when he should goe To Sandall, left them as his onely kay, King Henry left before to the keeping of the Duke of Norfolke, and the Earle of Warwick.To keepe King Henry (which they not forslowe) Lest by the Queene and hers he might be wrought, T'annull their late past Parliament for nought. For which to Counsell, calling up her Lords, Well to consider what was to be done, Who cheere her up with comfortable words, And would in no wise she her way should shunne: For they would make her entrance with their swords: Here what was lost, might here againe be wonne, Assuring her, their mindes them strongly gave, That of this Field the glory shee should have. And soone their Army ordering for the ground, Whereof a view they ev'ry way doe take: When for Assault they bid their Trumpets sound, And so their entry on the Towne they make: But comming to the Market-place, they found A shower of Shafts, as from a Cloud it brake, Which backe againe made them so fast to beare, As that their Van, was like to route their Reare. But thus repuls'd, another way they prove, How in upon their Enemie to get, Which makes their Foes, that they their Force remove, To stop that passage wherein they were set, That whilst, they Shafts into each other shove, For a long while it was an even bet, Death being thus dealt, and both so deeply in, Whether proud Warwick, or the Queene should win. But by the Queene constrayned to recoyle, Their ground from them they absolutely wonne, When they the Yorkists miserably spoyle, And in with them on their mayne Battell runne: Which being greatly straytned by the soyle, They could not doe what else they might have done: Through thick and thin, o'r hedge and ditch that take, The Queene getteth the day at Saint Albans. And happiest he that greatest hast could make. Whilst Warwick cryes, yee Southerne Cowards stay, And once more turne your faces to your Foes, Tis feare, not danger doth yee thus dismay: O prove the former fortune of your Bowes, Thinke but upon the late-wonne glorious day Got in this place; the fame whereof you lose By your base flight; but he his breath might spare, He might as well have call'd upon the Ayre. Scatter'd like Sheepe by Wolves that had bin scar'd, So runne the Yorkists; which, when Norfolke sawe, He calls to Warwick scarsely then prepar'd, The Yorkists Army discomfited at this second Battell at Saint Albans. Himselfe out of this danger to withdrawe: My Lord (quoth he) you see that all is mard: Fortune hath sworne to keepe us in her awe: Our lives are gone if longer here we stay, Loose not your selfe, though we have lost the day. And for they found the Foe came on so fast, The King by them to this lost Battell brought, And under guard in his Pavillion plac't, Th'are forc'd to leave (which late they little thought) For there were those which made them make such hast, They could not stay to have their Soveraigne sought: King Henry of no account. But since the Battell, had such ill successe, That lost, they thought their losse of him the lesse. The Foe thus fled, they quickly found the King, From whom a speedy Messinger is sent, His Wife, and Sonne, away to him to bring, The King meetes with the Queene and her sonne.Who with their Lords ariving at his Tent, Where after many a Fall and many a Spring, Of teares of joy upon each other spent, Which strict embraces they each other straine, No one had neede a gladnesse there to faine. Like as you see when Partridges are flowne, (In Falconers termes which we the Covy call) By the sharpe Hawke, and into Thickets throwne, A Simily.There drops downe one, there doth another fall: Yet when they heare the questing Spaniels gone, They in the evening get together all, With pretty jugging and each other greete, Glad as it were they once againe should meete. But the fierce Queene, her full revenge to take, Of those she thought the Yorkists well that ment, The stout Lord Bonvile for King Henryes sake, The cruelty of the Queen.And Thomas Kerrill, a brave Knight of Kent, Who the Kings Guard strove ever strong to make, All threatning perill thereby to prevent; And for their safeties had his Soveraigne word, That cruell woman putteth to the sword. This well might warne great Warwick not to trust Too much to Fortune, which so soone reveales Her whorish lightnesse; like an Averse gust, And on the suddaine makes him strike his Sayles, Which when he most beleev'd her to be just, His forward hopes then most of all shee fayles: All his accounts, and teach him thus to summe, “None overcomes, but may be overcome. Some thinke that Warwick had not lost the day, But that the King into the Field he brought, For with the worse, that side went still away, King Henry ever most infortunate.Which had King Henry with them when they fought, Upon his birth so sad a curse they lay, As that he never prospered in ought, The Queene wanne two, amongst the losse of many, Her Husband absent, present, never any. But whilst her selfe with further hopes she fed, The Queene still watchfull, wisely understands, That Warwick late, who at Saint Albans fled, (Whereas his heeles serv'd better then his hands,) Had met the Duke of Yorke, and made a head Of many fresh, and yet unfought-with bands, At Chipping-norton for more forces stay'd, From whence towards London they their march had laid. And for shee saw the Southerne to adhere, The Londoners deny the Queen victuaile for her Army. Still to the Yorkists, who againe relyde Much on their ayde, as London she doth feare, A small reliefe which lately her denyde, She can (at all) conceive no comfort there, With any succours, nor to be supply'd, But to the North her speedy course directs, From whence fresh aydes she every day expects. Not foure dayes march yett fully on her way, But Yorke to London with his Army comes, The Duke of Yorke entreth London with applause of the people. And nere the Walls his Ensignes doth display Deaffing the City with his clamorous Drummes, His Title so the multitude doth sway, That for his Souldiers they provide him Summes, And those provisions, they Queene Margarit ow'd, Taken from hers, they on the Duke bestowde. The Gates set open to receive him in, They with applause his gracious entrance greet, His presence so the Peoples hearts doth winne, That they come flocking in from every street, Kneeling before him as he Crown'd had beene, And as he rode along, they kisse his feet, Whilst good King Henry towards the North is gone, The poore Lancastrians damn'd by every one. Whither (at once) doth presently repaire The Spirituall Lords, and Temporall, who would have Him take the Crowne, who farre more ready are To give, then he their suffrages to crave: The Commons take him so into their care, Upon his name that dotingly they rave, And being ask'd who should their Soveraigne be, They cry King Edward, and no man but he. Thus to his hight this puissant Prince they heave, The seat Imperiall; where then sitting downe, Their fealty they force him to receave, Which on his head might firmely fixe his Crowne, And in his hand the Regall Scepter leave: Edward made King by the suffrage of the Commons. Edward the fourth proclaym'd in ev'ry Towne, With all the pompe that they could thinke upon, They then adorne his Coronation. This newes too quickly in Queene Margarites eare, What by the Lords at London had beene done, Even at the point to fall into dispaire, Ready she was on her owne death to runne; With her faire fingers rents her golden haire, Cursing that houre when first she saw the Sunne, With rage she faints; reviving, and doth call Upon high heav'n for vengeance on them all. To ayde her right yet still excites her friends, By her faire speech inchanted (as by Charmes) Scarce any man on any Lord depends That followes her, that riseth not in Armes: The spacious North such plentious succour sends, That to her side the Souldiers come in swarmes: Thus day by day she addeth more and more To that full Army, which shee had before. Not long it was but Edward understood, Of this great power prepared in the North, When he to make his Coronation good, King Edward marches from London to meete his Enemies in the North.Calls to his ayde his friends of greatest worth, With whom, then rising like a raging flood: This forward King breakes violently forth, That with the helpe of Tributary flowes, Extends his breadth still onward as he goes. Nor Henries Army needed to be sought, For every man could tell him where it lay: In twelve dayes march which Edward eas'ly rought, Without resistance keeping on his way, Nere fifty thousand, in his Host he brought, Whose brandish'd Ensignes seem'd to brave the day: And under Pomfret his proud Tents he pight, Providing hourely for a deadly fight. Of Henryes Host when they who had command, On whom the Queene imposed had the care: Great Somerset, and stout Northumberland, And Clifford whom no danger yet could dare: The Walls of Yorke first having throughly man'd, There plac'd the King; when quickly they prepare To range their Battell, which consisted then Of threescore thousand valiant Northerne men. From Edwards Host the Lord Fitzwater went, And valiant Nevill, Warwicks Bastard brother, The Lord Fitz-water and Bastard Nevill slaine. At Ferry-Bridge the Passage to prevent From comming over Eyre, to keepe the other; Gainst whom the Adverse, the Lord Clifford sent, Who taking night his enterprise to smother: The dawne yet dusky, passing through a Ford, Puts them, and all their Souldiers to the Sword. At the shrill noyse when Warwicke comming in, And findes his Brother and Fitzwater dead, Even as a man distracted that had bin: Out of his face the lively coulour fled: Doth cruell Clifford thus (quoth he) begin, Warwicke vowes to revenge his brothers death. For ev'ry drop of bloud that he hath shed, This day, I'le make an Enemy to bleed, Or never more in Battaile let me speed. And to the King returning in this mood: My Liege (quoth he) all mercy now defie, Delay no longer to revenge their blood; Whose mangled bodies breathlesse yonder lie: And let the man that meanes King Edwards good Stand fast to Warwick, who no more shall flie: Resolv'd to winn, or bid the world adue, Warwicks desperate resolution. Which spoke, the Earle his sprightly Courser slue. This resolution so extreamely wrought Upon King Edward, that he gave command, That on his side who willingly not fought, Should have his leave, to quit him out of hand; That ev'ry one should kill the man he cought, No Quarter kept at Towton. To keepe no Quarter, and who meant to stand In his just cause, rewarded he would see, This day he'll rise, or this day ruin'd be. When neere to Towton on the spacious Playne These puissant Armies, on Palme-Sunday met, Where downe-right slaughter angry Heav'n doth rayne, Towton field.With clouds of Rage the Element is set: The windes breath Fury, and the earth againe With the hot gore of her owne Natives wet, Sends up a smoke, which makes them all so mad, Of neither part that mercy could be had. One horrid sight another doth appall: One fearefull crie another doth confound, Murthers so thick upon each other fall, That in one shreeke anothers shreeke is dround, Whilst blood for blood incessantly doth call, From the wide mouth of many a gaping wound; Slaughter so soone growes big, that comm'n to birth, The monstrous burthen over-loades the earth. This bloody Tempest ten long houres doth last, Whilst neither side could to it selfe assure The Victory; but as their lot was cast, With wounds and death they stoutly it endure, Untill the valiant Yorkists at the last, Although in number neere ten thousand fewer: In their long Fight their forces mannage so, That they before them lay their conquer'd foe. Couragious Clifford first here fell to ground, Into the throat with a blunt Arrow struck: Here Westmerland receiv'd his deadly wound: A miserable defect of the Queenes friends.Here dy'd the stout Northumberland that stuck Still to his Soveraigne; Wells and Dacres found That they had lighted on King Henryes luck: Trowlup and Horne two brave Commanders dead, Whilst Summerset and Excester were fled: The greatest slaughter in all that civill Warre.Thirty two thousand in this Battaile slaine, Many in strayts lye heap'd up like a wall: The rest lye scatter'd round about the Playne, And Cocke a River, though but very small, Fill'd with those flying; doth so deeply stayne The River Wharfe, in t'wich this Cocke doth fall, As that the Fountaine which this flood doth feede, Besides their blood, had seem'd for them to bleede. King Henryes hopes thus utterly forlorne, By the late losse of this unlucky day: He feeles the Crowne (even) from his Temples torne On his sword point, which Edward beares away: The King and Queene forc'd to forsake the Land. And since his fall the angry Fates had sworne, He findes no comfort longer here to stay: But leaving Yorke, he post to Barwick goes With's Queene and Sonne, true partners in his woes. The King for Scotland, and for France the Queene, Divided hence, since them thus Fortune thwarts, Before this time there seldome had beene seene, Two to be sever'd with so heavy harts: The Prince their sonne then standing them betweene, Their song is sorrow, and they beare their parts: He to the King of Scots, to get supplies, Shee to the French King, and her Father flies. Which well might showe a Princes slippery state, For when she hether at the first came in, England and France did her congratulate, Then in two Battailes she had Conqueror bin, Seeming to tread upon the Yorkists hate, As from that day she had beene borne to win: Now to sayle back with miseries farre more, Then were her tryumphes landing here before. This cruell blowe to the Lancastrians lent, At fatall Towton that Palme-Sunday fight, Where so much blood they prodigally spent, To France and Scotland as inforc'd their flight, Lifts up the Yorkists to their large extent, And Edward now to see his Crowne sat right, Proud in his spoyles, to London doth repaire, And re-annoynted mounts th'Imperiall Chaire. Where he a speedy Parliament doth passe, T'annull those Lawes which had beene made before: Gainst his succession, and dissolve the Masse Of Treasons heapt on his, them to restore: Whereby King Henry so much lesned was, As after that he should subsist no more, Little then thinking Lancaster againe Now but an Exile over him should raine. Where he attaints as Traitors to his Crowne, John Earle of Oxford and his valient Sonne Aubry De Vere, with whom likewise went downe, The Earle of Oxford and his Sonne attainted. Mountgomery, Teril, Tudenham who were done To death; so Heaven on Henry seemes to frowne, And Summerset King Edwards wrath to shunne, Himselfe submitting is reciv'd to grace, Such is Queene Margarits miserable case. Henry in Scotland, the sad Queene the while, Is left to France, to Lewis there to sue, To lend her succour; scorning her exile, In spight of Fate she will the warre renew, Queene Margarit a woman of an undainted spirit.She will tempt Fortune till againe she smile, In such a pitch her mighty spirit still flew; That should the world oppose her, yet that strength, She hopes shall worke up her desires at length. And with five thousand valient Volunteers, Of native French, put under her Command, With Armes well fitted she towards Scotland steeres, With which before she possibly could land, The Queene in every enterprise most unfortunate.The wrath of Heaven upon this Queene appeares, And with fierce Tempests strive her to withstand, The windes make warre against her with her Foe, Which Join'd together worke her overthrowe. Her Forces thus infortunatly lost, Which she in Scotland hop'd to have encreast, And in this tempest she her selfe so tost, As never Lady; yet she here not ceast, But since she found her interprise thus crost, She to the Scottish her faire course adrest, Nor would desist till she had raisde agen, Ten thousand valient well-appointed men. And in upon Northumberland doth breake, Rowzing the Sluggish villages from sleepe, Bringing in Henry though a helpe but weake, But leaves her Sonne in Barwicke safe to keepe; Queene Margarit rayseth a new Army.Her ratling Drummes so rough a language speake, The ruffling Scots, and all the Countrey sweepe; Which rumor ran so fast with, through the ayre, That Edward thought it shooke his very Chaire. And Somerset receiv'd to grace before, With Sir Ralphe Percy from that fatall day At Towton; found each minute more and more How sad a fate on the Lancastrians lay, Some that had submitted themselves to King Edward, revolt at king Henryes comming. Yet hoping now King Henry to restore, Who they suppos'd had new found out the way, Revolt from Edward, and in Henrys name Call in their frends, to ayde him as he came. This noise of Warre arising from the North, In Edwards eares re-ecchoing bidds him stirre, And Rumour tells him if he made not forth, Queene Margarit com'n he must resigne to her, For they were Captaines of especiall worth, On whom shee did this mighty charge conferre; For that her Ensignes she at large displai'd, And as shee came so still came in her ayde. For which his much lov'd Montacute he sends With Englands valient Infantry his Pheres; To whose wise guidance, he this Warre commends, His Souldiers expert pickt in sundry sheeres: His utmost strength King Edward now extends, Which he must doe, or drag'd downe by the eares From his late-gotten, scarsely-setled Throne, And one his shoulders shee remount thereon. And Mountacute had scarsely march'd away, But he himselfe sets forward with an Host, And a strong Navy likewise doth purvay, To scoure the Seas and keepe the Brittish Coast, King Edward provideth to resist Queene Margarites comming in. Fearing from France fresh succours every day, To ayde Queene Margarit which perplex'd him most, For he perceiv'd his Crowne sate not so sure, But might be shak'd should she her Powers procure. Now is the North fild with refulgent Armes, Edwards are English, Scots Queen Margarit brings, The Norths cold bosome, this great concourse warmes, Their Quarrell is the right of two great Kings, Which oft before have wrought each others harmes, And from that Roote, new horror dayly springs, And though much blood they both had spent before, Yet not so much, but that there must be more. At Hegly-Heath their skirmishes begin, Where two bold Barons Hungerford and Rosse, With Sir Ralph Percy, he who late had bin The Conflict at Hegly More.Leagu'd with King Edward, but then gotten lose, (Strives by all meanes to expyate that sin) To the Lancastrian faction cleaves so close, That when those Barrons from that Conflict flie, In Henry's right, he bravely dares to die. Which leads along as tragicall an Act, As since the Warres had ever yet beene playd; For Mountacute b'ing fortunately backt By brave King Edwards comming to his ayde: As of their force King Henry little lackt, The Battaile of Exham.The Playne call'd Livells where the sceane was layde: Not farre from Exham neere to Dowills flood, That day discoloured with Lancastrians blood. There struck they Battaile, Bowmen Bowmen plide, Northerne to Southerne, slaughter ceaseth all; Long the Fight lasted e'r that either side Could tell to which the Victory would fall: But to the Yorkists fortune is so tide, That she must come when they shall please to call, And in his Cradle Henry had the curse, That where he was, that side had still the worse. This lucklesse day by the Lancastrians lost, Was Summerset surprized in his flight, And in pursuing of this scatter'd Host, On Mullins, Rosse, and Hungerford they light, Queene Margarites party goes still to wrack.Which this dayes worke e'r long full dearely cost; And with these Lords were taken many a Knight, Nor from their hands could Henry hardly shift, Had not his guide beene, as his Horse was, swift. Still must Queene Margarites miseries endure, This Masse of sorrow markt out to sustaine: For all the aydes this time she should procure, Are either taken, put to flight, or slaine; Of nothing else she can her selfe assure, That she will leave her losses to complaine: For since she sees that still her friends goe downe, She will curse Fortune if she doe not frowne. Henry to flye to Scotland back is faine, To get to France, the wofull Queene is glad, There with her Sonne inforced to remaine, Till other aydes might thence againe be had; King Henry and the Queen part. So them their hard necessities constraine, To set them downe that it doth make me sad, Never so thicke came miseries I weene, Upon a poore King, and a woofull Queene. This done King Edward, his strong Army sends To take those Castles which not long before, Had beene deliverd to King Henrys friends, Which he by siedges makes them to restore, And on the Borders watchfully attends, To Henries ayde that there should come no more, But ô behold as one ordain'd to ill, The Fate that followes haplesse Henry still. For out of some deepe melancholly fitt, Or otherwise, as falne into despaire, King Henry comming disguised into England is discovered, and taken prisoner. Or that he was not rightly in his witt, Being safe in Scotland, and still succour'd there; Upon the sudaine he abandons it, And into England Idly entring, where He is surprisde, and (in his enemies power) Is by King Edward shut up in the Tower. This hap had Henry, who when he was borne, King Henry was borne the greatest of Christian Kings. Of Christian Kings the greatest then alive, Now he the Crowne full forty yeeres had worne, Doth all his Regall Soveraignety survive; Of all men living and the most forlorne, So strange a thing can Destiny contrive: So many sundry Miseries as he, No King before, had ever liv'd to see. To heare all this Queene Margarite must endure, Yet sadly to her Fathers Court confinde, And now King Edward held himselfe secure, When things fell out so fittly to his minde, But when of rest he did himselfe assure, Upon a suddaine rose so rough a winde, In his strong hand, which shooke his Scepter more, Then all the stormes that ere had blowne before. For then in minde to league himselfe with France, Which he perceiv'd, would be the surest way, His question'd Tytle highly to advance; The pollicie of King Edward.And at his need should serve him for a kay, To open him their pollicies; whose chance Was then in casting, and they next to play; For Margarite still the French King Lewes prest For second aydes, nor would she let him rest. Wherefore he sends a marri'ge to entreat, With beauteous Bona (with whose rich report Warwick sent into France to intreat for a marriage betwixt King Edward and Bona, the French Queens sister.Fame was opprest with, as a taske too great) The French Queenes sister, and with her in Court, Warwick the man chose forth to worke the feat, Who is sent thither in most sumptuous sort, And in short time so well his bus'nesse plies, That she was like to prove an English prize. The Dutchesse of Bedford after John her husbands decease, was wedded to Sir Rich. Woodvile Knight, whose daughter this Lady was.In the meane while this youthfull King by chance, Comming to Grafton, where the Dutchesse lay, Then stil'd of Bedford; his eye haps to glance On her bright daughter the faire Widdow Gray, Whose beauties did his senses so intrance, And stole his heart so suddainly away; That must he loose his Crowne, come weale, come woe, She must be his, though all the world say no. Her lookes like Lethe make him to forget, Upon what bus'nesse he had Warwick sent; Upon this Lady he his love so set, That should his Crowne from off his head be rent, Or his rebellious people rise, to let This choyse of his, they should it not prevent: For those pure eyes his bosome that had pierc'd, Had writ a Law there, not to be revers'd. What lesse amends this Lady can I make, For her deare Husband in my quarrell slaine; Her husband slaine at Saint Albons on the Kings part.Then lawfull marri'ge which for Justice sake, I must performe (quoth he) lest she complaine, For a just Prince, so me the world shall take: Soothing himselfe up in this amorous vaine, With his affections in this sort doth play, Till he a Queene made the faire Lady Gray. This act of Edwards com'n to Warwicks eare, And that the sequell show'd it to be true, In his sterne eyes it eas'ly might appeare, His heart too great for his straight bosome grew, He his Commission doth in piece-meale teare, Breakes the broad Seale, and on the ground it threw, And prayes blest heav'n may curse him, if that he For this disgrace revenged would not be. Have I (quoth he) so lifted thee aloft, Warwick expressing the wrong done him by King Edward in the three following Stanzas. That to thy Greatnesse I the scorne am growne: Have I for thee adventur'd beene so oft, In this long Warre, as to the world is knowne, And now by thee thus basely am I scoft, By this disgrace upon me thou hast throwne: If these thy wrongs unpunish'd slightly passe, Hold Warwick base, and falne from what he was. Know tw'as the Nevils for thy Tytle stood, Else long e'r this layd lower then the ground, And in thy cause my Father shed his blood, None of our house, for thee, but beares some wound, And now at last to recompence this good, Onely for me this Guerdon hast thou found; From thy proud head, this hand shall pluck thy Crowne, Or if thou stand, then needes must Warwick downe. Yet he to England peaceably repaires, And with a smooth browe smothers his intent, And to the King relates the French affaires, As what in Court had past there since he went: Warwicke deeply dissembles his discontent. His spleene he for a fitter season spares, Till he the same more liberally might vent: Calme was his countenance, and his language faire, But in his breast a deepe revenge he bare. Meane while Queene Margarite (a poore Exile) heares, How things in England (in her absence) went, Her halfe-burst heart, which but a little cheeres: For from her head she felt the Crowne was rent, Yet though farre off a little glimpse appeares, A seeming hope, and though it faintly lent, It might have said, had not the Fates said no, These stormes at home, might her some profit blowe. She heares how Warwick cunningly had wrought, George Duke of George, second brother to King Edward, and by him created Duke of Clarence. Clarence from his brothers side, And that brave Youth at Callice having caught His eldest daughter had to him affide, How to rebell the Warwick by his Agents had stirred up this Rebellion in the North, he himselfe being at Callice, that it might seeme not to be done by him: they had to their Captaines Henry Fitzhoward, Henry Nevill, and Sir John Coniers. Northerne men were brought, And who by Warwick poynted was their guide, As on the The Earle of Penbroke and his brother Richard Herbert overthrowne at Banbury field. Welch he had a mighty hand, By Edward rais'd those Rebels to withstand. Of new These Rebels had to their Captaine, one whom they termed Robin of Redsdale. Rebellions at Northampton rais'd, And to dispight the King what they had done, How they at Grafton the Earle The Earle Rivers was Father to the Lady Gray, then Queene of England. Rivers seas'd, And Sir John Woodvile his most hopefull sonne, Who with their heads could hardly be appeas'd, And of the Fame by puissant Warwick wonne: Who having taken The Earle taketh the King prisoner at Woolvey in Warwickshire entring upon this Campe suddainly in the night. Edward in his Tent, His King his prisoner into Yorkshire sent. Then heares againe how Edward had escapt, And by his friends a greater power had got, How he the men of They had to their Captaine Robert Wells, sonne to the Lord Wells, this was called Loosecoate field. Lincolneshire intrapt, Who neere to Stamford pay'd a bloody shot: And when the Earle his course for Callice shapt, When England lastly grew for him too hot, The Lord Vaucleere a Gascoigne borne. Vaucleere who there his Deputy he put, The Ports against his late grand Captaine shut. Lastly, she heares that he at A knowne Port Towne of Normandy. Deepe arives, And lately com'n to A Towne where then the French King lay. Amboyes to the Court, Whereas King Lewes to his utmost strives, To entertaine him in most Princely sort: When the wise Queene her bus'nesse so contrives, That she comes thither, small what though her port; Yet brings along the sweet young Prince her sonne, To prove what good with Warwick might be done. When both in Queen Margarite and the Earle of Warwick met in the Court of France. Court, and presence of the King, Their due respect to both of them that gave: He will'd them in so pertinent a thing, That they the like should of each other have: The teares began from both their eyes to spring, That each from other Pitty seem'd to crave, In gracefull manner when the greeved Queene Thus to that great Earle, gently breathes her spleene. Warwick, saith shee, how mercilesse a Foe The Queenes speech to the Earle in the foure following Stanzas. Hast thou beene still to my poore Child and me. That villaine Yorke which hast advanced so, Which never could have risen but for thee; That valour thou on Edward didst bestow, O hadst thou show'd for him, thou here dost see, Our Damaske Roses had adorn'd thy Crest, And with their wreathes thy ragged Staves bene drest. First, at Saint Albans, at Northampton then, And fatall Towton that most fearefull fight, How many, nay, what multitudes of men, By thee fierce Warwick slaine and put to flight; O if thy Sword that ever stood for ten, Had but beene drawne for Henry, and his right, He should have built thee Trophyes everywhere, Wrought with our Crowne, supported by thy Beare. What glory had it wonne the Nevils name, To have upheld the right succeeding race, Of that fift Henry, he that was of Fame Baron Faulconbridge was brother to Richard Nevill Earle of Salisbury, and Richard Earle of Warwicke, and John Marquesse Mountacute were Sonnes to the said Earle. The onely Mineon; whom thou now dost trace, But Salisbury the first against us came, Then Falconbridge, and Mountacute, ô base, To advance a Traitor to his Soveraigne thus, But to our Crowne your name is ominous. How many a brave Peere, thy too neere Allies, (Whose losse the Babe that's yet unborne shall rue) Have made themselves, a willing Sacrifice In our just quarrell, who it rightly knewe, Whose blood gainst Yorke and his adherents cryes, (Whom many a sad curse ever shall pursue:) O Warwick, Warwick, expiat this gilt, By shedding theirs for whom our blood was spilt. When in like language, this great Earle againe Regreets the Queene, and wooes her to forbeare, Warwickes reply in the two following Stanzas. Of former greefe one thought to entertaine; Things are not now, quoth he, as once they were, To talke of these past help, it is in vaine, What though it ease your heart, and please your eare, This is not it, no, it must be our Swords Must right our wrongs (deare Lady) not our words. Madam (quoth he) by this my vexed heart, On Edwards head, which oft hath wish'd the Crowne, Let but Queene Margarite cleave to Warwicks part, This hand that heav'd him up shall hewe him downe, And if from Henry, Richard Nevill start, Upon my House let Heaven for ever frowne; Or backe the Crowne to this young Prince Ile bring, Or not be Warwick if he be not King. Prince Edward affyed to Anne the Earle of Warwicks daughter.When they accord, Prince Edward should affye, Anne the Earles Daughter, to confirme it more, By Sacrament themselves they strictly tye, By Armes againe King Henry to restore, Or in the Quarrell they would live and dye, Comprising likewise in the oath they swore, That the Earle and Clarence should Protectors be When they King Henry and the Prince should free. When soone great Warwick into England sends, Warwicke makes preparation for a new Warre.To warne his friends that they for Warre prepare, King Henrys Title, and to them commends, That they should take his cause into their care, Now is the time that he must trie his freinds, When he himselfe gainst Edward must declare; And when much strife amongst the Commons rose, Whom they should ayde, or whom they should oppose. Furnish'd with all things well befitting Warre, By great King Lewes to Queene Margarite lent, Warwick (whose name Fame sounded had so farre, That men with wonder view'd him as he went, Warwicke so famous that he was seene with wonder.Of all men living the most popular) Thought ev'ry houre to be but idely spent, On Englands troubled earth untill he were, To view the troupes attending for him there. And in his Army tooke with him along, Oxford, and Penbrooke, who had beene destroy'd, By Edward, sworne now to revenge their wrong, By Burgoyne the French Admirall convoy'd, At whose Arive the shores with people throng: At sight of Warwick, and so overjoy'd, That ev'ry one, a Warwick, Warwick cries, Well may the Red-Rose by great Warwick rise. Like some blacke cloud, which hovering lately hung Thrust on at last by th'windes impetious power The groves and fields, comes raging in among, As though both foules and flockes it would devoure, A Simele. That those abroad make to the shelters strong To save themselves from the outragious shower; So fly the Yorkists before Warwicks Drumms Like a sterne tempest roaring as he comes. When Edward late who wore the costly Crowne, Himselfe so high and one his Fortunes bore, Then heard himselfe in every place cry'd downe, And made much lesse, then he was great before, Nor dares he trust himselfe in any Towne, For in the In-lands as along the shore, Their Proclamations him a Traytor make, And each man chardg'd against him Armes to take. For which the Washes he is forc'd to wade And in much perill lastly gets to Lin, (To save himselfe such shift King Edward made For in more danger he had never bin) Where finding three Dutch Hulks which lay for trade Warwick driveth King Edward out of the Kingdom. The greatest of them he hires to take him in, Richard his brother, Hastings his true friend, Scarse worth one sword their persons to defend. When Warwick now the onely Prince of power, Edward the fourth out of the Kingdome fled, Commands himselfe free entrance to the Tower Warwicke takes King Henry out of the Tower. And sets th'Imperiall wreath on Henryes head, Brings him through London to the Bishops bower, By the applauding people followed, Whose shrill re-eccowing shouts resound from farre A Warwick, Warwick, long live Lancaster. And presently, a Parliament they call, In which they attaynt King Edward in his blood King Edward and his adherents attainted by act of Parliament. The lands and goods made forfeitures of all That in this quarrell, with proud Yorke had stood, Their friends in their old honours they install Which they had lost, now by an act made good, Intayle the Crowne, on Henry and his heyres, The next on Clarence should they faile in theirs, Whilst Warwick thus King Henry doth advance, See but the Fate still following the sad Queene, Such Stormes and Tempests in that season chance, Before that time as seldome had bin seene, That twice from Sea she was forc'd backe to France, As angry heaven had put it selfe betweene Her and her Joyes, and would a witnesse be That naught but sorow, this sad Queene must see. This might have lent her comfort yet at last, So many troubles having undergone, Queene Margarite never sees any thing that might give her comfort.And having through so many perils past, T'have seene her husband setled on his Throne, Yet still the skies with clowds are overcast, Well might she heare, but of this sees she none, Which from farre off, as flying newes doth greet her, Naught but mischance, when she comes in must meet her. But all this while King Edward not dismay'd The Duke of Burgondie Brother in Law to King Edward, so was he alied to King Henrie by his Grandmother being the daughter of John of Gaunt.His Brother Charles of Burgondy so plyes, That though the subtill Duke on both sides play'd Edward and Henry both his neere Allies; Upon the Duke King Edward yet so layd, (Having his sisters furtherance, who was wise) That underhand, his strength he so restores, As that he dar'd t'attempt the English shores. With foureteene Shipps from th'Easterlings being hir'd, And foure Burgonians excellently man'd, After some time with stormes and tempests tyr'd, He neere the mouth of Humber haps to land, Where though the Beacons at his sight were fir'd, Yet few or none his entrance doe withstand, For that his frends had given it out before, He sought the Dukedome, and he would no more. Upon his march when forward as he came, Yorke yeelded up to King Edward.Resolv'd to trie the very worst of warre, He Summons Yorke (whereof he bare the name) To him her Duke, her Gates that doth unbarre, And comming next to Rocke-reard Nottingham, Mountgomery, Borough, Harrington &amp; Par Succours comming in to Edward.Bring him their power; at Lecester againe, Three thousand came, to Hastings that retaine. To Coventry and keeping on his way, (Sets downe his Army in the Citties sight) Whereas that time the Earle of Warwick lay, To whom he sends to dare him out to fight, King Edward setts downe his Armie before Coventry, daring Warwicke to the field. Which still the Earle deferrs from day to day, Perceiving well, that all things went not right, For with his succours Clarence came not in, Whom to suspect he greatly doth beginne. And not in vaine, for that disloyall Lord, Taking those Forces he had levied, leaves The Earle, and with his Brother doth accord, Clarence revoults from his father in Lawe the Earle of Warwicke. Which of all hope brave Warwick so bereaves; That now King Edward hopes to be restor'd, Which then too late the credulous Earle perceives, Edward towards London with his Army sped, To take the Crowne once more from Henries head. The Queene in France this wofull newes that heard, How farre through England Edward thus had past; As how by Clarence (whom she ever fear'd) Warwick behind hand mightily was cast, This most undaunted Queene her hopes yet cheer'd, By those great perills shee had lately past, And from King Lewes doth three thousand presse, To ayde her freinds in England in distresse. Whilst she is busie gathering up those Aydes, (In so short time) as France could her afforde, Corragious Warwick basely thus betray'd Warwicke followes the King towards London. By Clarence lewdly falsifying his word, The most coragious Earle no whitt dismayde, But trusting still to his successefull Sword, Followes the King, towards London march'd before, Each day his Power increasing more and more. But Edward by the Londoners let in, Who in their Gates his Army tooke to guard, Warwick this while that trifling had not bin, But with a Power sufficiently prepar'd T'approch the Citty bravely doth begin King Edward setts out of London to meete Warwicke. To dare the King, who lately him had dar'd, Who then from London his arm'd Forces leades, Towards where his march ambitious Warwick treads. From London this, that from Saint Albans sett, These two grand Souldiers shouldring for the Crowne, They in the mid-way are at Barnet met, The Armies meet at Barnet.Where then they set their puissant Armies downe, Warwick as neere as ever he could get, But Edward onely taketh up the Towne; Betwixt whose Tents a Heath calld Gladmoore lyes, Where they prepare to act this bloody prize. With Drums and Trumpets they awake the day, Muffled in mists her lowring selfe that showes, To stop their madnesse doing all it may, Knowing what blood her light was like to lose: But hope of slaughter beares so great a sway That with the Sunne their rage still higher growes, Full were their hands of death, so freely dealt, That the most mortall wounds, the least were felt. The adverse Ensignes to each other wave, (As t'were) to call them forward to the field, The King the Earle, the Earle the King doth brave, Nor cares he for the The Armes of England. Leopards in his Sheild; And whilst one freind another strives to save, Hee's slaine himselfe, if not, enforc'd to yeeld, In either Army there is not one eye, But is spectator of some Tragedy. Those wrongs the King had from the Earle receiv'd, Expulst the Kingdome onely by his power, Even to the height his powerfull hand up-heav'd, For full revenge in this unhappy howre, And by the King, the Earle his hopes bereav'd, Sheltred by him from many a bloody shower, Spurres up Revenge, and with that violent rage, That scarsely blood, their fury could asswage. Warwick who sees his Souldiers had the worse, And at a neere point to be put to flight, Warwickes high valour.Throwing himselfe from of his armed Horse, Thrusts in on foote into the deadliest fight, Edward againe with an unusuall force, In his owne person in the Armies sight, Puts for the Garland, which if now he lose, Warwick his Crowne at pleasure would dispose. To Edwards side, but Fortune doth encline, Warwicks high valour then was but in vaine; His noble soule there destin'd to resigne, Brave Mountacute his valiant brother slaine: The Earle of Warwicke and his brother Marquesse Mountacute slaine. Here Somerset (with them that did combine) Forced to flye, and Excester is faine To save himselfe by Sanctuary; this day Edward's victorious, and beares all away. This fatall field unluckily thus lost, That very day so Destinie contrives, That very day that Warwicke was slaine, the Queene lands. That the griev'd Queene at Sea turmoyl'd and tost Neere twenty dayes, in Weymouth Road arives, Where scarcely landed, but Post after Post Brings her this ill newes, which so farre deprives Her of all comfort, that shee curst and band Those plaguy windes that suffered her to land. Wert thou (quoth she) so fortunate in fight The Queenes speech hearing of Warwicks defeat in the three following Stanzas. O noble Warwick, when thou wert our foe, And now thou stood'st in our indoubted right, And should'st for Henry thy high valour showe Thus to be slaine; what Power in our dispight Watcheth from heav'n upon our overthrowe? Th'unlucky Starres have certainly made lawes, To marke for Death the favourers of our cause. O what Infernall brought that Edward back, So late expell'd by Warwicks powerfull hand, Was there no way his rotten Ship to wrack? Was there no Rock? was there no swallowing sand? And too, the wretched Subjects were so slack, To suffer him so trayterously to land; Surely whole heav'n against us have conspir'd, Or in our troubles they had else beene ty'rd. Was I for this so long detayn'd in France, From ragefull Tempests, and reserv'd till now, That I should land, to meete with this mischance: It must needes be, the Powers have made a vowe, Up to that height my sorrowes to advance, That before mine all miseries shall bowe: That all the sorrow mortalls can surmise, Shall fall farre short of Margarites miseries. These words scarse spoke, her halfe-slaine heart to ease, But the least breath of comfort to prevent The next ill newes, in rushing after these, Cause of new sorrow to the Queene.Was that King Henry to the Tower was sent, (As though it selfe (even) Destiny should please, In wretched Margarites heavy discontent) Thrunging so thicke as like themselves to smoother, Or as one ranne, to overtake another. Those scattred Troopes from Barnet that escap'd, Hearing the Queene thus Landed with her power, Though much dismay'd with what had lately hapt, The remnant of the Army which escaped at Barnet resort to the Queene.On Gore-drown'd Gladmore in that bloody shower, And fearing by the Foe to be entrapt: Through untrod grounds, in many a tedious hower, Flocke to her dayly, till that by their ayde, Equall with Edwards they her Army made. When Somerset and Devonshire came in The Queene encouraged by her friends.To the sad Queene, and bad her not despaire, Though they of late infortunate had bin, Yet there was helpe that Ruine to repaire, What they had lost they hop'd againe to winne, And that the way lay open yet, and faire, For that the West would wholly with her rise, Besides from Walles assur'd her of Supplies. And every day still adding to their Force; As on their Host tow'rds Glocester they guide, When Edward finding their intended course, Againe for Battell strongly doth provide, Both Armies they supply with Foote and Horse, By both their friends, as they affect the side, The Armies meet at Tewcksbury.And in their march at Tewksbury they mett, Where they in Order their Battalions set. Ill was her choise of this uneven ground, Lucklesse the place, unlucky was the howre, A place ill chosen on the Queenes part.The Heavens upon her so extreamely fround, As one her head their plagues at once to powre; As in a Deluge here her hopes were drown'd, Here sees shee death her faithfull freinds devoure, The earth is fill'd with grones, the ayre with cryes, Horror on each side doth enclose her eyes. Never did death so terrible appeare, Since first their Armes the English learnt to weeld, Who would see slaughter, might behold it heere In the true shape upon this fatall field, In vaine was valour, and in vaine was feare, A bloody battell. In vaine to fight, in vaine it was to yeeld, In vaine to fly; for destiny discust, By their owne hands, or others, dye they must. Here her deare Devonshiere noble Courtney dyde, The Queenes army overthrowne. Her faithfull friend great Summerset here fell, Delves, Leuknor, Hamden, Whittingham beside, O Margarite, who thy miseries can tell! Sharpe were those swords which made their wounds so wide, Whose blood the soyle did with th'abundance swell, Other her friends into the Towne that fled Taken, no better then the former sped. But the amazing misery of all As heaven the greatst untill the last had kept, As it would say, that after this none shall By mortall eyes be worthy to be wept, The Prince her sonne who sees his friends thus fall And on each side their carcases lye heapt, Prince Edward taken Prisoner. Making away in this most piteous plight, Is taken prisoner in his tardy flight. And forth by Crofts before the Conquerour brought Upon the Kings proclamation of a great reward to him that could bring him in; as also of the Princes safety, Sir Richard Crofts is wonne to discover his prisoner. Prince Edward stab'd to death. His Proclamations cleering every doubt, Of the youths safety: living were he caught, As a reward to him should bring him out; But when they once had found him whom they sought Hearing his answeres, Princely, wise, and stout, Those bloody brothers, Hastings, and the rest, Sheath'd their sharpe Ponyards in his manly breast. Queene Margarite thus of mortalls most forlorne Her sonne now slaine, her army overthrowne Left to the world as fortunes only scorne And not one friend to whom to make her moane (To so much woe was never woman borne) This wretched Lady wandring all alone Getts to a homely Cell not farre away Queene Margaret gets into a poore Cell If possibly to hide her from the day. But wretched woman quickly there bewray'd, She thence is taken and to Prison sent, Meanely attended, miserably array'd, The people wondring at her as she went, Of whom the most malicious, her upbray'd With good Duke Humphres death, her heart to rent, Whilst her milde lookes, and Gracefull gesture drue Many a sad eye, her miseries to rue. Lewes King of France.Till by Duke Rayner Ransomed at last, Her tender Father, who a Prince but poore, Borow'd great Summes of Lewes, with much wast, Which for he was not able to restore, Province and both the Cicils, to him past, Duke Raynor undoeth himself to ransome his Daughter.With fruitfull Naples, which was all his store; To bring her backe, from earthly joyes exil'd, The undone father, helpes the undone Child. And though enlarg'd ere she could leave the land Making a long yeere of each short-liv'd houre, The Earle of Glocester, after Richard the third.She heares that by Duke Richards murthering hand The King her husband suffers in the Towre As though high heaven had laid a strict command, Upon each starre, some plague on her to powre: And untill now that nothing could suffice Nor give a period to her Miseryes. FINIS. NIMPHIDIA, THE COURT OF FAYRIE. Olde Chaucer doth of Topas tell, Mad Rablais of Pantagruell, A latter third of Dowsabell, With such poore trifles playing: Others the like have laboured at Some of this thing, and some of that, And many of they know not what, But that they must be saying. Another sort there bee, that will Be talking of the Fayries still, Nor never can they have their fill, As they were wedded to them; No Tales of them their thirst can slake, So much delight therein they take, And some strange thing they faine would make, Knew they the way to doe them. Then since no Muse hath bin so bold, Or of the Later, or the ould, Those Elvish secrets to unfold, Which lye from others reeding, My active Muse to light shall bring, The court of that proud Fayry King, And tell there, of the Revelling, Jove prosper my proceeding. And thou Nimphidia gentle Fay, Which meeting me upon the way, These secrets didst to me bewray, Which now I am in telling: My pretty light fantastick mayde, I here invoke thee to my ayde, That I may speake what thou hast sayd, In numbers smoothly swelling. This Pallace standeth in the Ayre, By Nigromancie placed there, That it no Tempests needs to feare, Which way so ere it blow it. And somewhat Southward tow'rd the Noone, Whence lyes a way up to the Moone, And thence the Fayrie can as soone Passe to the earth below it. The Walls of Spiders legs are made, Well mortized and finely layd, He was the master of his Trade, It curiously that builded: The Windowes of the eyes of Cats, And for the Roofe, instead of Slats, Is cover'd with the skinns of Batts, With Mooneshine that are guilded. Hence Oberon him sport to make, (Their rest when weary mortalls take) And none but onely Fayries wake, Desendeth for his pleasure. And Mab his merry Queene by night Bestrids young Folks that lye upright, (In elder Times the Mare that hight) Which plagues them out of measure. Hence Shaddowes, seeming Idle shapes, Of little frisking Elves and Apes, To Earth doe make their wanton skapes, As hope of pastime hasts them: Which maydes think on the Hearth they see, When Fyers well nere consumed be, Their daunsing Hayes by two and three, Just as their Fancy casts them. These make our Girles their sluttery rue, By pinching them both blacke and blew, And put a penny in their shue, The house for cleanely sweeping: And in their courses make that Round, In Meadowes, and in Marshes found, Of them so call'd the Fayrie ground, Of which they have the keeping. These when a Childe haps to be gott, Which after prooves an Ideott, When Folke perceive it thriveth not, The fault therein to smother: Some silly doting brainelesse Calfe, That understands things by the halfe, Say that the Fayrie left this Aulfe, And tooke away the other. But listen and I shall you tell, A chance in Fayrie that befell, Which certainely may please some well; In Love and Armes delighting: Of Oberon that Jealous grewe, Of one of his owne Fayrie crue, Too well (he fear'd) his Queene that knew, His love but ill requiting. Pigwiggen was this Fayrie knight, One wondrous gratious in the sight Of faire Queene Mab, which day and night, He amorously observed; Which made king Oberon suspect, His Service tooke too good effect, His saucinesse, and often checkt, And could have wisht him starved. Pigwiggen gladly would commend, Some token to queene Mab to send, If Sea, or Land, him ought could lend, Were worthy of her wearing: At length this Lover doth devise, A Bracelett made of Emmotts eyes, A thing he thought that shee would prize, No whitt her state impayring. And to the Queene a Letter writes, Which he most curiously endites, Conjuring her by all the rites Of love, she would be pleased, To meete him her true Servant, where They might without suspect or feare, Themselves to one another cleare, And have their poore hearts eased. At mid-night the appointed hower, And for the Queene a fitting Bower, (Quoth he) is that faire Cowslip flower, On Hipcut hill that groweth, In all your Trayne there's not a Fay, That ever went to gather May, But she hath made it in her way, The tallest there that groweth. When by Tom Thum a Fayrie Page, He sent it, and doth him engage, By promise of a mighty wage, It secretly to carrie: Which done, the Queene her Maydes doth call, And bids them to be ready all, She would goe see her Summer Hall, She could no longer tarrie. Her Chariot ready straight is made, Each thing therein is fitting layde, That she by nothing might be stayde, For naught must her be letting, Foure nimble Gnats the Horses were, Their Harnasses of Gossamere, Flye Cranion her Chariottere, Upon the Coach-box getting. Her Chariot of a Snayles fine shell, Which for the colours did excell: The faire Queene Mab, becomming well, So lively was the limming: The seate the soft wooll of the Bee; The cover (gallantly to see) The wing of a pyde Butterflee, I trowe t'was simple trimming. The wheeles compos'd of Crickets bones, And daintily made for the nonce, For feare of ratling on the stones, With Thistle-downe they shod it; For all her Maydens much did feare, If Oberon had chanc'd to heare, That Mab his Queene should have bin there, He would not have aboad it. She mounts her Chariot with a trice, Nor would she stay for no advice, Untill her Maydes that were so nice, To wayte on her were fitted, But ranne her selfe away alone; Which when they heard there was not one, But hasted after to be gone, As she had beene diswitted. Hop, and Mop, and Drop so cleare, Pip, and Trip, and Skip that were, To Mab their Soveraigne ever deare: Her speciall Maydes of Honour; Fib, and Tib, and Pinck, and Pin, Tick, and Quick, and Jill, and Jin, Tit, and Nit, and Wap, and Win, The Trayne that wayte upon her. Upon a Grashopper they got, And what with Amble, and with Trot, For hedge nor ditch they spared not, But after her they hie them. A Cobweb over them they throw, To shield the winde if it should blowe, Themselves they wisely could bestowe, Lest any should espie them. But let us leave Queene Mab a while, Through many a gate, o'r many a stile, That now had gotten by this wile, Her deare Pigwiggin kissing, And tell how Oberon doth fare, Who grewe as mad as any Hare, When he had sought each place with care, And found his Queene was missing. By grisly Pluto he doth sweare, He rent his cloths, and tore his haire, And as he runneth, here and there, An Acorne cup he greeteth; Which soone he taketh by the stalke About his head he lets it walke, Nor doth he any creature balke, But layes on all he meeteth. The Thuskan Poet doth advance, The franticke Paladine of France, And those more ancient doe inhaunce, Alcides in his fury. And others Ajax Telamon, But to this time there hath bin non, So Bedlam as our Oberon, Of which I dare assure you. And first encountring with a waspe, He in his armes the Fly doth claspe As though his breath he forth would graspe, Him for Pigwiggen taking: Where is my wife thou Rogue, quoth he, Pigwiggen, she is come to thee, Restore her, or thou dy'st by me, Whereat the poore waspe quaking, Cryes, Oberon, great Fayrie King, Content thee I am no such thing, I am a Waspe behold my sting, At which the Fayrie started: When soone away the Waspe doth goe, Poore wretch was never frighted so, He thought his wings were much to slow, O'rjoyd, they so were parted. He next upon a Glow-worme light, (You must suppose it now was night, Which for her hinder part was bright, He tooke to be a Devill. And furiously doth her assaile, For carrying fier in her taile, He thrasht her rough coat with his flayle, The mad King fea'rd no evill. O quoth the Gloworme, hold thy hand, Thou puisant King of Fayrie land, Thy mighty stroaks who may withstand, Hould, or of life despaire I: Together then her selfe doth roule, And tumbling downe into a hole, She seem'd as black as any Cole, Which vext away the Fayrie. From thence he ran into a Hive, Amongst the Bees hee letteth drive And downe their Coombes begins to rive, All likely to have spoyled: Which with their Waxe his face besmeard, And with their Honey daub'd his Beard, It would have made a man afeard, To see how he was moyled. A new Adventure him betides, He mett an Ant, which he bestrides, And post thereon away he rides, Which with his haste doth stumble; And came full over on her snowte, Her heels so threw the durt about, For she by no meanes could get out, But over him doth tumble, And being in this piteous case, And all be-slurried head and face, On runs he in this Wild-goose chase, As here, and there, he rambles, Halfe blinde, against a molehill hit, And for a Mountaine taking it, For all he was out of his wit, Yet to the top he scrambles. And being gotten to the top, Yet there himselfe he could not stop, But downe on th'other side doth chop, And to the foot came rumbling: So that the Grubs therein that bred, Hearing such turmoyle over head, Thought surely they had all bin dead, So fearefull was the Jumbling. And falling downe into a Lake, Which him up to the neck doth take, His fury somewhat it doth slake, He calleth for a Ferry; Where you may some recovery note, What was his Club he made his Boate, And in his Oaken Cup doth float, As safe as in a Wherry. Men talke of the Adventures strange, Of Don Quishott, and of their change, Through which he Armed oft did range, Of Sancha Panchas travell: But should a man tell every thing, Done by this franticke Fayrie King, And them in lofty Numbers sing It well his wits might gravell. Scarse set on shore, but therewithall, He meeteth Pucke, which most men call Hobgoblin, and on him doth fall, With words from frenzy spoken; Hoh, hoh, quoth Hob, God save thy grace, Who drest thee in this pitteous case, He thus that spoild my soveraignes face, I would his necke were broken. This Puck seemes but a dreaming dolt, Still walking like a ragged Colt, And oft out of a Bush doth bolt, Of purpose to deceive us. And leading us makes us to stray, Long Winters nights out of the way, And when we stick in mire and clay, Hob doth with laughter leave us. Deare Puck (quoth he) my wife is gone, As ere thou lov'st King Oberon, Let every thing but this alone, With vengeance, and pursue her; Bring her to me alive or dead, Or that vilde thiefe, Pigwiggins head, That villaine hath defil'd my bed, He to this folly drew her. Quoth Puck, My Liege Ile never lin, But I will thorough thicke and thinne, Untill at length I bring her in, My dearest Lord nere doubt it: Thorough Brake, thorough Brier, Thorough Muck, thorough Mier, Thorough Water, thorough Fier, And thus goes Puck about it. This thing Nimphidia over hard, That on this mad King had a guard, Not doubting of a great reward, For first this businesse broching; And through the ayre away doth goe Swift as an Arrow from the Bowe, To let her Soveraigne Mab to know, What perill was approching. The Queene bound with Loves powerfulst charme Sate with Pigwiggen arme in arme, Her merry Maydes that thought no harme, About the roome were skipping: A Humble-Bee their Minstrell, playde Upon his Hoboy; ev'ry Mayde Fit for this Revells was arayde, The Hornepype neatly tripping. In comes Nimphidia, and doth crie, My Soveraigne for your safety flie, For there is danger but too nie, I posted to forewarne you: The King hath sent Hobgoblin out, To seeke you all the Fields about, And of your safety you may doubt, If he but once discerne you. When like an uprore in a Towne, Before them every thing went downe, Some tore a Ruffe, and some a Gowne, Gainst one another justling: They flewe about like Chaffe i'th winde, For hast some left their Maskes behinde; Some could not stay their Gloves to finde, There never was such bustling. Forth ranne they by a secret way, Into a brake that neere them lay; Yet much they doubted there to stay, Lest Hob should hap to finde them: He had a sharpe and piercing sight, All one to him the day and night, And therefore were resolv'd by flight, To leave this place behinde them. At length one chanc'd to finde a Nut, In th'end of which a hole was cut, Which lay upon a Hazell roote, There scattred by a Squirill: Which out the kernell gotten had; When quoth this Fay deare Queene be glad, Let Oberon be ne'r so mad, Ile set you safe from perill. Come all into this Nut (quoth she) Come closely in, be rul'd by me, Each one may here a chuser be, For roome yee neede not wrastle: For neede yee be together heapt; So one by one therein they crept, And lying downe they soundly slept, And safe as in a Castle. Nimphidia that this while doth watch, Perceiv'd if Puck the Queene should catch, That he would be her over-match, Of which she well bethought her; Found it must be some powerfull Charme, The Queene against him that must arme, Or surely he would doe her harme, For throughly he had sought her. And listning if she ought could heare That her might hinder, or might feare: But finding still the coast was cleare, Nor creature had discride her; Each circumstance and having scand, She came thereby to understand, Puck would be with them out of hand, When to her Charmes she hide her: And first her Ferne seede doth bestowe, The kernell of the Missletowe: And here and there as Puck should goe, With terrour to affright him: She Night-shade strawes to work him ill, Therewith her Vervayne and her Dill, That hindreth Witches of their will, Of purpose to dispight him. Then sprinkles she the juice of Rue, That groweth underneath the Yeu: With nine drops of the midnight dewe, From Lunarie distilling: The Molewarps braine mixt therewithall; And with the same the Pismyres gall, For she in nothing short would fall; The Fayrie was so willing. Then thrice under a Bryer doth creepe, Which at both ends was rooted deepe, And over it three times shee leepe; Her Magicke much avayling: Then on Prosperpyna doth call, And so upon her Spell doth fall, Which here to you repeate I shall, Not in one tittle fayling. By the croking of the Frogge; By the howling of the Dogge; By the crying of the Hogge, Against the storme arising; By the Evening Curphewe bell, By the dolefull dying knell, O let this my direfull Spell, Hob, hinder thy surprising. By the Mandrakes dreadfull groanes; By the Lubricans sad moanes; By the noyse of dead mens bones, In Charnell houses ratling: By the hissing of the Snake, The rustling of the fire-Drake, I charge thee thou this place forsake, Nor of Queene Mab be pratling. By the Whirlewindes hollow sound, By the Thunders dreadfull stound, Yells of Spirits under ground, I chardge thee not to feare us: By the Shreech-owles dismall note, By the Blacke Night-Ravens throate, I charge thee Hob to teare thy Coate With thornes if thou come neere us. Her Spell thus spoke she stept aside, And in a Chincke her selfe doth hide, To see there of what would betyde, For shee doth onely minde him: When presently shee Puck espies, And well she markt his gloating eyes, How under every leafe he pries, In seeking still to finde them. But once the Circle got within, The Charmes to worke doe straight begin, And he was caught as in a Gin; For as he thus was busie, A paine he in his Head-peece feeles, Against a stubbed Tree he reeles, And up went poore Hobgoblins heeles, Alas his braine was dizzie. At length upon his feet he gets, Hobgoblin fumes, Hobgoblin frets, And as againe he forward sets, And through the Bushes scrambles; A Stump doth trip him in his pace, Downe comes poore Hob upon his face, And lamentably tore his case, Amongst the Bryers and Brambles. A plague upon Queene Mab, quoth hee, And all her Maydes where ere they be, I thinke the Devill guided me, To seeke her so provoked: Where stumbling at a piece of Wood, He fell into a dich of mudd, Where to the very Chin he stood, In danger to be choked. Now worse then e're he was before: Poore Puck doth yell, poore Puck doth rore; That wak'd Queene Mab who doubted sore Some Treason had beene wrought her: Untill Nimphidia told the Queene What she had done, what she had seene, Who then had well-neere crack'd her spleene With very extreame laughter. But leave we Hob to clamber out: Queene Mab and all her Fayrie rout, And come againe to have about With Oberon yet madding: And with Pigwiggen now distrought, Who much was troubled in his thought, That he so long the Queene had sought, And through the Fields was gadding. And as he runnes he still doth crie, King Oberon I thee defie, And dare thee here in Armes to trie, For my deare Ladies honour: For that she is a Queene right good, In whose defence Ile shed my blood, And that thou in this jealous mood Hast lay'd this slander on her. And quickly Armes him for the Field, A little Cockle-shell his Shield, Which he could very bravely wield: Yet could it not be pierced: His Speare a Bent both stiffe and strong, And well-neere of two Inches long; The Pyle was of a Horse-flyes tongue, Whose sharpnesse naught reversed. And puts him on a coate of Male, Which was of a Fishes scale, That when his Foe should him assaile, No poynt should be prevayling: His Rapier was a Hornets sting, It was a very dangerous thing: For if he chanc'd to hurt the King, It would be long in healing. His Helmet was a Bettles head, Most horrible and full of dread, That able was to strike one dead, Yet did it well become him: And for a plume, a horses hayre, Which being tossed with the ayre, Had force to strike his Foe with feare, And turne his weapon from him. Himselfe he on an Earewig set, Yet scarce he on his back could get, So oft and high he did corvet, Ere he himselfe could settle: He made him turne, and stop, and bound, To gallop, and to trot the Round, He scarce could stand on any ground, He was so full of mettle. When soone he met with Tomalin, One that a valiant Knight had bin, And to King Oberon of Kin; Quoth he thou manly Fayrie: Tell Oberon I come prepar'd, Then bid him stand upon his Guard; This hand his basenesse shall reward, Let him be ne'r so wary. Say to him thus, that I defie, His slanders, and his infamie, And as a mortall enemie, Doe publickly proclaime him: Withall, that if I had mine owne, He should not weare the Fayrie Crowne, But with a vengeance should come downe: Nor we a King should name him This Tomalin could not abide, To heare his Soveraigne vilefide: But to the Fayrie Court him hide; Full furiously he posted, With ev'ry thing Pigwiggen sayd: How title to the Crowne he layd, And in what Armes he was aray'd, As how himselfe he boasted. Twixt head and foot, from point to point, He told th'arming of each joynt, In every piece, how neate, and quaint, For Tomalin could doe it: How fayre he sat, how sure he rid, As of the courser he bestrid, How Mannag'd, and how well he did; The King which listened to it, Quoth he, goe Tomalin with speede, Provide me Armes, provide my Steed, And every thing that I shall neede, By thee I will be guided; To strait account, call thou thy witt, See there be wanting not a whitt, In every thing see thou mee fitt, Just as my foes provided. Soone flew this newes through Fayrie land, Which gave Queene Mab to understand, The combate that was then in hand, Betwixt those men so mighty: Which greatly she began to rew, Perceiving that all Fayrie knew, The first occasion from her grew, Of these affaires so weighty. Wherefore attended with her maides, Through fogs, and mists, and dampes she wades, To Proserpine the Queene of shades To treat, that it would please her, The cause into her hands to take, For ancient love and friendships sake, And soone thereof an end to make, Which of much care would ease her. A while, there let we Mab alone, And come we to King Oberon, Who arm'd to meete his foe is gone, For proud Pigwiggen crying: Who sought the Fayrie King as fast, And had so well his journeys cast, That he arrived at the last, His puisant foe espying: Stout Tomalin, came with the King, Tom Thum doth on Pigwiggen bring, That perfect were in every thing, To single fights belonging: And therefore they themselves ingage, To see them excercise their rage, With faire and comly equipage, Not one the other wronging. So like in armes, these champions were, As they had bin, a very paire, So that a man would almost sweare, That either, had bin either; Their furious steedes began to naye That they were heard a mighty way, Their staves upon their rests they lay, Yet e'r they flew together; Their Seconds minister an oath, Which was indifferent to them both, That on their Knightly faith, and troth, No magicke them supplyed; And sought them that they had no charmes, Wherewith to worke, each others harmes, But came with simple open armes, To have their causes tryed. Together furiously they ran, That to the ground came horse and man, The blood out of their Helmets span, So sharpe were their incounters; And though they to the earth were throwne, Yet quickly they regain'd their owne, Such nimblenesse was never showne, They were two Gallant Mounters. When in a second Course againe, They forward came with might and mayne, Yet which had better of the twaine, The Seconds could not judge yet; Their shields were into pieces cleft, Their helmets from their heads were reft, And to defend them nothing left, These Champions would not budge yet. Away from them their Staves they threw, Their cruell Swords they quickly drew, And freshly they the fight renew; They every stroke redoubled: Which made Proserpina take heed, And make to them the greater speed, For feare lest they too much should bleed, Which wondrously her troubled. When to th'infernall Stix she goes, She takes the Fogs from thence that rose, And in a Bagge doth them enclose; When well she had them blended: She hyes her then to Lethe spring, A Bottell and thereof doth bring, Wherewith she meant to worke the thing, Which onely she intended. Now Proserpine with Mab is gone Unto the place where Oberon And proud Pigwiggen, one to one, Both to be slaine were likely: And there themselves they closely hide, Because they would not be espide; For Proserpine meant to decide The matter very quickly. And suddainly untyes the Poke, Which out of it sent such a smoke, As ready was them all to choke, So greevous was the pother; So that the Knights each other lost, And stood as still as any post, Tom Thum, nor Tomalin could boast Themselves of any other. But when the mist gan somewhat cease, Proserpina commandeth peace: And that a while they should release, Each other of their perill: Which here (quoth she) I doe proclaime To all in dreadfull Plutos name, That as yee will eschewe his blame, You let me heare the quarrell, But here your selves you must engage, Somewhat to coole your spleenish rage: Your greevous thirst and to asswage, That first you drinke this liquor: Which shall your understanding cleare, As plainely shall to you appeare; Those things from me that you shall heare, Conceiving much the quicker. This Lethe water you must knowe, The memory destroyeth so, That of our weale, or of our woe, It all remembrance blotted; Of it nor can you ever thinke: For they no sooner tooke this drinke; But nought into their braines could sinke, Of what had them besotted. King Oberon forgotten had, That he for jealousie ranne mad: But of his Queene was wondrous glad, And ask'd how they came thither: Pigwiggen likewise doth forget, That he Queene Mab had ever met; Or that they were so hard beset, When they were found together. Nor neither of them both had thought, That e'r they had each other sought; Much lesse that they a Combat fought, But such a dreame were lothing: Tom Thum had got a little sup, And Tomalin scarce kist the Cup, Yet had their braines so sure lockt up, That they remembred nothing. Queene Mab and her light Maydes the while, Amongst themselves doe closely smile, To see the King caught with this wile, With one another jesting: And to the Fayrie Court they went, With mickle joy and merriment, Which thing was done with good intent, And thus I left them feasting. FINIS. THE QUEST OF CYNTHIA. What time the groves were clad in greene, The Fields drest all in flowers, And that the sleeke-hayr'd Nimphs were seene, To seeke them Summer Bowers. Forth rov'd I by the sliding Rills, To finde where Cynthia sat, Whose name so often from the hills, The Ecchos wondred at. When me upon my Quest to bring, That pleasure might excell, The Birds strove which should sweetliest sing, The Flowers which sweet'st should smell. Long wandring in the Woods (said I) Oh whether's Cynthia gone? When soone the Eccho doth reply, To my last word, goe on. At length upon a lofty Firre, It was my chance to finde, Where that deare name most due to her, Was carv'd upon the rynde. Which whilst with wonder I beheld, The Bees their hony brought, And up the carved letters fild, As they with gould were wrought. And neere that trees more spacious roote, Then looking on the ground, The shape of her most dainty foot, Imprinted there I found. Which stuck there like a curious seale, As though it should forbid Us, wretched mortalls, to reveale, What under it was hid. Besides the flowers which it had pres'd, Apeared to my vew, More fresh and lovely then the rest, That in the meadowes grew: The cleere drops in the steps that stood, Of that dilicious Girle, The Nimphes amongst their dainty food, Drunke for dissolved pearle. The yeilding sand, where she had troad, Untucht yet with the winde, By the faire posture plainely show'd, Where I might Cynthia finde. When on upon my waylesse walke, As my desires me draw, I like a madman fell to talke, With every thing I saw: I ask'd some Lillyes why so white, They from their fellowes were; Who answered me, that Cynthia's sight, Had made them looke so cleare: I ask'd a nodding Violet why, It sadly hung the head, It told me Cynthia late past by, Too soone from it that fled: A bed of Roses saw I there, Bewitching with their grace: Besides so wondrous sweete they were, That they perfum'd the place, I of a Shrube of those enquir'd, From others of that kind, Who with such vertue them enspuir'd, It answer'd (to my minde.) As the base Hemblocke were we such, The poysned'st weed that growes, Till Cynthia by her god-like tuch, Transform'd us to the Rose: Since when those Frosts that winter brings Which candy every greene, Renew us like the Teeming Springs, And we thus Fresh are seene. At length I on a Fountaine light, Whose brim with Pincks was platted; The Banck with Daffadillies dight, With grasse like Sleave was matted, When I demanded of that Well, What Power frequented there; Desiring, it would please to tell What name it usde to beare: It told me it was Cynthias owne, Within whose cheerefull brimmes, That curious Nimph had oft beene knowne To bath her snowy Limmes. Since when that Water had the power, Lost Mayden-heads to restore, And make one Twenty in an howre, Of Esons Age before. And told me that the bottome cleere, Now layd with many a fett Of seed-pearle, ere shee bath'd her there: Was knowne as blacke as Jet, As when she from the water came, Where first she touch'd the molde, In balls the people made the same For Pomander, and solde. When chance me to an Arbour led, Whereas I might behold: Two blest Elizeums in one sted, The lesse the great enfold. The place which she had chosen out, Her selfe in to repose; Had they com'n downe, the gods no doubt The very same had chose. The wealthy Spring yet never bore That sweet, nor dainty flower That damask'd not, the chequer'd flore Of Cynthias Summer Bower. The Birch, the Mirtle, and the Bay, Like friends did all embrace; And their large branches did display, To Canapy the place. Where she like Venus doth appeare, Upon a Rosie bed; As Lillyes the soft pillowes weare, Whereon she layd her head. Heav'n on her shape such cost bestow'd, And with such bounties blest: No lim of hers but might have made A Goddesse at the least. The Flyes by chance mesht in her hayre, By the bright Radience throwne From her cleare eyes, rich Jewels weare, They so like Diamonds shone. The meanest weede the soyle there bare, Her breath did so refine, That it with Woodbynd durst compare, And beard the Eglantine. The dewe which on the tender grasse, The Evening had distill'd, To pure Rose-water turned was, The shades with sweets that fill'd. The windes were husht, no leafe so small At all was seene to stirre: Whilst tuning to the waters fall, The small Birds sang to her. Where she too quickly me espies, When I might plainely see A thousand Cupids from her eyes Shoote all at once at me. Into these secret shades (quoth she) How dar'st thou be so bold To enter, consecrate to me, Or touch this hallowed mold. Those words (quoth she) I can pronounce, Which to that shape can bring Thee, which the Hunter had who once Sawe Dian in the Spring. Bright Nimph againe I thus replie, This cannot me affright: I had rather in thy presence die, Then live out of thy sight. I first upon the Mountaines hie, Built Altars to thy name; And grav'd it on the Rocks thereby, To propogate thy fame. I taught the Shepheards on the Downes, Of thee to frame their Layes: T'was I that fill'd the neighbouring Townes, With Ditties of thy praise. Thy colours I devis'd with care, Which were unknowne before: Which since that, in their braded hayre The Nimphes and Silvans wore. Transforme me to what shape you can, I passe not what it be: Yea what most hatefull is to man, So I may follow thee. Which when she heard full pearly floods, I in her eyes might view: (Quoth she) most welcome to these Woods, To meane for one so true. Here from the hatefull world wee'll live, A den of mere dispight: To Ideots onely that doth give, Which be her sole delight. To people the infernall pit, That more and more doth strive; Where onely villany is wit, And Divels onely thrive. Whose vilenesse us shall never awe: But here our sports shall be: Such as the golden world first sawe, Most innocent and free. Of Simples in these Groves that growe, Wee'll learne the perfect skill; The nature of each Herbe to knowe Which cures, and which can kill. The waxen Pallace of the Bee, We seeking will surprise The curious workmanship to see, Of her full laden thighes. Wee'll suck the sweets out of the Combe, And make the gods repine: As they doe feast in Joves great roome, To see with what we dine. Yet when there haps a honey fall, Wee'll lick the sirupt leaves: And tell the Bees that their's is gall, To this upon the Greaves. The nimble Squirrell noting here, Her mossy Dray that makes, And laugh to see the lusty Deere Come bounding ore the brakes. The Spiders Webb to watch weele stand, And when it takes the Bee, Weele helpe out of the Tyrants hand, The Innocent to free. Sometime weele angle at the Brooke, The freckled Trout to take, With silken Wormes, and bayte the hooke, Which him our prey shall make. Of medling with such subtile tooles, Such dangers that enclose, The Morrall is that painted Fooles, Are caught with silken showes. And when the Moone doth once appeare, Weele trace the lower grounds, When Fayries in their Ringlets there Doe daunce their nightly Rounds And have a Flocke of Turtle Doves, A guard on us to keepe, As witnesse of our honest loves, To watch us till we sleepe. Which spoke I felt such holy fires To overspred my breast, As lent life to my Chast desires And gave me endlesse rest. By Cynthia thus doe I subsist, On earth Heavens onely pride, Let her be mine, and let who list, Take all the world beside. FINIS. THE SHEPHEARDS SIRENA. Dorilus in sorrowes deepe, Autumne waxing olde and chill, As he sate his Flocks to keepe, Underneath an easie hill: Chanc'd to cast his eye aside Of those fields, where he had seene, Bright Sirena Natures pride, Sporting on the pleasant greene: To whose walkes the Shepheards oft, Came her god-like foote to finde, And in places that were soft, Kist the print there left behinde; Where the path which she had troad, Hath thereby more glory gayn'd, Then in heav'n that milky rode, Which with Nectar Hebe stayn'd: But bleake Winters boystrous blasts, Now their fading pleasures chid, And so fill'd them with his wastes, That from sight her steps were hid. Silly Shepheard sad the while, For his sweet Sirena gone, All his pleasures in exile: Layd on the colde earth alone. Whilst his gamesome cut-tayld Curre, With his mirthlesse Master playes, Striving him with sport to stirre, As in his more youthfull dayes, Dorilus his Dogge doth chide, Layes his well-tun'd Bagpype by, And his Sheep-hooke casts aside, There (quoth he) together lye. When a Letter forth he tooke, Which to him Sirena writ, With a deadly downe-cast looke, And thus fell to reading it. Dorilus my deare (quoth she) Kinde Companion of my woe, Though we thus divided be, Death cannot divorce us so; Thou whose bosome hath beene still, Th'onely Closet of my care, And in all my good and ill, Ever had thy equall share: Might I winne thee from thy Fold, Thou shouldst come to visite me, But the Winter is so cold, That I feare to hazard thee: The wilde waters are waxt hie, So they are both deafe and dumbe, Lov'd they thee so well as I, They would ebbe when thou shouldst come; Then my coate with light should shine, Purer then the Vestall fire: Nothing here but should be thine, That thy heart can well desire: Where at large we will relate, From what cause our friendship grewe, And in that the varying Fate, Since we first each other knewe: Of my heavie passed plight, As of many a future feare, Which except the silent night, None but onely thou shalt heare; My sad heart it shall releeve, When my thoughts I shall disclose, For thou canst not chuse but greeve, When I shall recount my woes; There is nothing to that friend, To whose close uncranied brest, We our secret thoughts may send, And there safely let it rest: And thy faithfull counsell may, My distressed case assist, Sad affliction else may sway Me a woman as it list: Hither I would have thee haste, Yet would gladly have thee stay, When those dangers I forecast, That may meet thee by the way, Doe as thou shalt thinke it best, Let thy knowledge be thy guide, Live thou in my constant breast, Whatsoever shall betide. He her Letter having red, Puts it in his Scrip againe, Looking like a man halfe dead, By her kindenesse strangely slaine; And as one who inly knew, Her distressed present state, And to her had still been true, Thus doth with himselfe delate. I will not thy face admire, Admirable though it bee, Nor thine eyes whose subtile fire So much wonder winne in me: But my marvell shall be now, (And of long it hath bene so) Of all Woman kind that thou Wert ordain'd to taste of woe; To a Beauty so divine, Paradise in little done, O that Fortune should assigne, Ought, but what thou well mightst shun, But my counsailes such must bee, (Though as yet I them conceale) By their deadly wound in me, They thy hurt must onely heale, Could I give what thou do'st crave To that passe thy state is growne, I thereby thy life may save, But am sure to loose mine owne, To that joy thou do'st conceive, Through my heart, the way doth lye, Which in two for thee must clave Least that thou shouldst goe awry. Thus my death must be a toy, Which my pensive breast must cover; Thy beloved to enjoy, Must be taught thee by thy Lover. Hard the Choise I have to chuse, To my selfe if friend I be, I must my Sirena loose, If not so, shee looseth me. Thus whilst he doth cast about, What therein were best to doe, Nor could yet resolve the doubt, Whether he should stay or goe: In those Feilds not farre away, There was many a frolike Swaine, In fresh Russets day by day, That kept Revells on the Plaine. Nimble Tom, sirnam'd the Tup, For his Pipe without a Peere, And could tickle Trenchmore up, As t'would joy your heart to heare. Ralph as much renown'd for skill, That the Taber touch'd so well; For his Gittern, little Gill, That all other did excell. Rock and Rollo every way, Who still led the Rusticke Ging, And could troule a Roundelay, That would make the Feilds to ring, Collin on his Shalme so cleare, Many a high-pitcht Note that had, And could make the Ecchos nere Shout as they were wexen mad. Many a lusty Swaine beside, That for nought but pleasure car'd, Having Dorilus espy'd, And with him knew how it far'd. Thought from him they would remove, This strong melancholy fitt, Or so, should it not behove, Quite to put him out of's witt; Having learnt a Song, which he Sometime to Sirena sent, Full of Jollity and glee, When the Nimph liv'd neere to Trent, They behinde him softly gott, Lying on the earth along, And when he suspected not, Thus the Joviall Shepheards song. Neare to the Silver Trent, Sirena dwelleth: Shee to whom Nature lent all that excelleth: By which the Muses late, and the neate Graces, Have for their greater state taken their places: Twisting an Anadem, wherewith to Crowne her, As it belong'd to them most to renowne her. Cho: On thy Bancke, In a Rancke, Let thy Swanes sing her, And with their Musick, along let them bring her. Tagus and Pactolus are to thee Debter, Nor for their gould to us are they the better: Henceforth of all the rest, be thou the River, Which as the daintiest, puts them downe ever, For as my precious one, o'r thee doth travell, She to Pearle Parragon turneth thy gravell. Cho: On thy Bancke, In a Rancke, Let thy Swanns sing her, And with their Musicke, along let them bring her. Our mournefull Philomell, that rarest Tuner, Henceforth in Aperill shall wake the sooner, And to her shall complaine from the thicke Cover, Redoubling every straine over and over: For when my Love too long her Chamber keepeth; As though it suffered wrong, the Morning weepeth. Cho: On thy Bancke, In a Rancke, Let thy Swaines sing her, And with their Musick, along let them bring her. Oft have I seene the Sunne, to doe her honour, Fix himselfe at his noone, to looke upon her, And hath guilt every Grove, every Hill neare her, With his flames from above, striving to cheere her, And when shee from his sight hath her selfe turned, He as it had beene night, in Cloudes hath mourned: Cho: On thy Bancke, In a Rancke, Let thy Swanns sing her, And with their Musicke, along let them bring her. The Verdant Meades are seene, when she doth view them, In fresh and gallant Greene, straight to renewe them, And every little Grasse broad it selfe spreadeth, Proud that this bonny Lasse upon it treadeth: Nor flower is so sweete in this large Cincture But it upon her feete leaveth some Tincture. Cho: On thy Bancke, In a Rancke, Let thy Swanes sing her, And with their Musick, along let them bring her. The Fishes in the Flood, when she doth Angle, For the Hooke strive a good them to intangle; And leaping on the Land from the cleare water, Their Scales upon the sand lavishly scatter; Therewith to pave the mould whereon she passes, So her selfe to behold, as in her glasses. Cho: On thy Bancke, In a Rancke, Let thy Swanns sing her, And with their Musicke, along let them bring her. When shee lookes out by night, the Starres stand gazing, Like Commets to our sight fearefully blazing, As wondring at her eyes, with their much brightnesse, Which so amaze the skies, dimming their lightnesse, The raging Tempests are Calme, when shee speaketh, Such most delightsome balme, from her lips breaketh. Cho: On thy Banke, In a Rancke, &amp;c. In all our Brittany, ther's not a fayrer, Nor can you fitt any: should you compare her. Angels her eye-lids keepe all harts surprizing, Which looke whilst she doth sleepe like the Sunnes rising: She alone of her kinde knoweth true measure, And her unmatched mind is Heavens treasure: Chor: On thy Bancke, In a Rancke, Let thy Swanes sing her, And with their Musick, along let them bring her. Fayre Dove and Darwine cleere boast yee your beauties, To Trent your Mistres here yet pay your duties, My Love was higher borne tow'rds the full Fountaines, Yet she doth Moorland scorne, and the Peake Mountaines; Nor would she none should dreame, where she abideth, Humble as is the streame, which by her slydeth, Chor: On thy Bancke, In a Rancke, Let thy Swanns sing her, And with their Musicke, along let them bring her. Yet my poore Rusticke Muse, nothing can move her, Nor the meanes I can use, though her true Lover: Many a long Winters night have I wak'd for her, Yet this my piteous plight, nothing can stirre her. All thy Sands silver Trent downe to the Humber, The sighes that I have spent never can number. On thy Banke In a Ranke, Let thy Swans sing her And with their Musicke along let them bring her. Taken with this suddaine Song, Least for mirth when he doth looke, His sad heart more deepely stong, Then the former care he tooke, At their laughter and amaz'd, For a while he sat aghast, But a little having gaz'd, Thus he them bespake at last. Is this time for mirth (quoth he) To a man with griefe opprest, Sinfull wretches as you be, May the sorrowes in my breast, Light upon you one by one, And as now you mocke my woe, When your mirth is turn'd to moane, May your like then serve you so. When one Swaine among the rest Thus him merily bespake, Get thee up thou arrant beast, Fits this season love to make? Take thy Sheephooke in thy hand, Clap thy Curre and set him on, For our fields ti's time to stand, Or they quickely will be gon. Rougish Swinheards that repine At our Flocks, like beastly Clownes, Sweare that they will bring their Swine, And will wroote up all our Downes: They their Holly whips have brac'd, And tough Hazell goades have gott; Soundly they your sides will baste, If their courage faile them not. Of their purpose if they speed, Then your Bagpypes you may burne, It is neither Droane nor Reed Shepheard, that will serve your turne: Angry Olcon sets them on, And against us part doth take Ever since he was out-gone, Offring Rymes with us to make. Yet if so our Sheepe-hookes hold, Dearely shall our Downes be bought, For it never shall be told, We our Sheep-walkes sold for naught. And we here have got us Dogges, Best of all the Westerne breed, Which though Whelps shall lug their Hogges, Till they make their eares to bleed: Therefore Shepheard come away, When as Dorilus arose, Whistles Cut-tayle from his play, And along with them he goes. FINIS. THE MOONE-CALFE. Stultorum plena sunt omnia. Helpe Neighbours helpe, for Gods sake come with speede, For of your helpe there never was such neede: Midwives make hast, and dresse yee as yee runne; Either come quickly, or w'are all undone; The World's in labour, her throwes come so thick, That with the Pangues she's waxt starke lunatick: But whither, whither, one was heard to crie: She that call'd thus, doth presently replie; Doe yee not see in ev'ry Streete and place, The generall world now in a piteous case. Up got the Gossips, and for very hast, Some came without Shooes, some came all unlac'd, As she had first appointed them, and found The World in labour, dropt into a swound: Wallowing she lay, like to a boystrous hulke, Dropsied with Ryots, and her big-swolne bulke Stuff'd with infection, rottennesse, and stench; Her blood so fierd, that nothing might it quench But the Aspes poyson, which stood by her still, That in her drought she often us'd to swill; Clothed she was in a Fooles coate, and cap, Of rich imbroydered Silks, and in her lap A sort of paper Puppets, Gawdes, and Toyes, Trifles scarce good enough for Girles and Boyes, Which she had dandled, and with them had playd, And of this trash her onely God had made. Out and alasse (quoth one) the rest among, I doubt me Neighbours, we have stay'd too long: Pluck off your Rings, lay me your Bracelets by; Fall to your bus'nesse, and that speedily, Or else I doubt, her spirits consume so fast, That e're the birth, her strength will quite be past: But when more wistly they did her behold, There was not one (that once) durst be so bold As to come neere her, but stood all amaz'd, Each upon other silently and gaz'd: When as her belly they so bigge doe see, As if a Tunne within the same should be, And heard a noyse and rumbling in her wombe, As at the instant of the generall doome: Thunder and Earthquakes raging, and the Rocks Tumbling downe from their scytes, like mighty blocks, Rowl'd from huge mountaines, such a noyse they make, As though in sunder heav'ns huge Axtree brake, They either Poles their heads together pasht, And all againe into the Chaos dasht. Some of slight judgement that were standing by, Sayd, it was nothing but a Timpany: Others said, sure she humane helpe did want, And had conceived by an Elephant; Or some Sea-monster, of a horrid shape, Committed with her by some violent rape: Others more wise, and noting very well, How her huge wombe did past all compasse swell, Said certainly (if that they might confesse her) It would be found some Divell did possesse her. Thus while they stood, and knew not what to doe; Women (quoth one) why doe you trifle so: I pray you thinke, but wherefore yee came hether, Shall wombe, and burthen, perish both together: Bring forth the Birth-stoole, no, let it alone, She is so farre beyond all compasse growne: Some other new devise us needs must sted, Or else she never can be brought to bed. Let one that hath some execrable spell, The Furies fetch'd from hell to bring the World to bed. Make presently her entrance into hell: Call Hecate, and the damn'd Furies hether, And try if they will undertake together To helpe the sicke World; one is out of hand Dispatch'd for hell, who by the dread command Of powerfull Charmes brought Hecate away, Who knowing her bus'nesse, from her selfe doth lay That sad aspect, she wont to put on there, In that blacke Empire; and doth now appeare, As shees Lucina giving strength and ayde In birth to women; mild as any mayde, Full of sweet hope her brow seemd, and her eyes Darting fresh comfort, like the morning skies. A description of the Furies.Then came the Furies with their bosomes bare, Save somewhat covered with their Snaky hayre, In wreathes contorted, mumbling hellish Charmes, Up to the elbowes naked were there Armes. Megera, eld'st of this damn'd Femall Fiends, Gnawing her wrists, biting her fingers ends, Entred the first; Tysiphone the next, As to revenge her Sister throughly vext: In one hand bare a whip, and in the other A long shape knife; the third, which seeme to smoother, Her manner of revenge, cast such an eye, As well neare turnd to stone all that stood by, Her name Alecto, which no plague doth rue, Nor never leaves them, whom she doth pursue. The women pray the Goddesse now to stand Auspicious to them, and to lend her hand To the sick World, which willingly she granted; But at the sight as altogether danted, From her cleare face the sprightly vigour fled, And but she sawe the Women hard bested, Out she had gone, nor one glance back had shot, Till heaven or hell she o'r her head had got, Yet she her selfe retires, next to the dore. The Gossips worse then e'r they were before At their wits end, know not which way to take, At length the World beginning to awake Out of the Trance, in which she lay as dead, And somewhat raising her unweeldy head, To bright Lucina call'd for helpe, that shee, Now in her travell would propitious be. The Goddesse not from feeling of her woe, Onely to see with what the World might goe, As she is draded Hecate, having power Of all that keepe Hels ugly balefull Bower, Commands the Furies to step in and ayde her, And be the Midwives, till they safe had layd her. To do whose pleasure as they were about, A sturdy Huswife pertly stepping out, Cryes hold a while, and let the queane alone; It is no matter, let her lye and groane: Hold her still to't, wee'll doe the best we can To get out of her, certainly the man Which ownes the Bastard: for there's not a Nation But hath with her committed fornication: And by her base and common prostitution, She came by this unnaturall polution; There is a meane for women thus abus'd, Which at this time may very well be us'd: That in this case when people doe desire, To know the truth, yet doubtfull of the Sire, When as the woman most of life doth doubt her In greevous throwes; to those that are about her; He that is then at the last cast disclos'd, The naturall Father is to be suppos'd: And the just Law doth faithfully decide, That for the nursing he is to provide: Therefore let's see, what in her pangues she'll say, Lest that this Bastard on the Land we lay: They lik'd her counsell, and their helpe denide, But bad her lye and languish till she dide; Unlesse to them she truly would confesse, Who fill'd her belly with this foule excesse. Alas (quoth she) the Divell drest me thus, Amidst my Ryot, whilst that Incubus The Moone-Calfe begot by the divell. Wrought on my weakenesse, and by him beguilde, He onely is the Father of the childe. His Instrument my Apish imitation, Of ev'ry monstrous and prodigious fashion, Abus'd my weaknesse: women it was she, Who was the Bawd betwixt the Fiend and me: That this is true, it on my death I take, Then helpe me women even for pitties sake. The prodigious signes that fore-ranne the birth of the Moone-Calfe.When ominous signes to showe themselves began, That now at hand this monstrous birth fore-ran: About at noone flewe the affrighted Owle, And dogs in corners set them downe to howle: Bitches and Wolves these fatall signes among, Brought forth most monstrous and prodigious young. And from his hight the earth refreshing Sunne, Before his houre his golden head doth runne, Farre under us, in doubt his glorious eye, Should be polluted with this Prodigye. A Panique feare upon the people grew, But yet the cause, there was not one that knewe, When they had heard this; a short tale to tell, The Furies straight upon their bus'nesse fell, And long it was not ere there came to light, The most abhorrid, the most fearefull sight That ever eye beheld, a birth so strange, That at the view, it made their lookes to change; Women (quoth one) stand of, and come not neere it, The Devill if he saw it, sure would feare it; For by the shape, for ought that I can gather, The Childe is able to affright the Father; Out cries another, now for Gods sake hide it, A description of the Moone-Calfe.It is so ugly we may not abide it: The birth is double, and growes side to side That humane hand it never can divide; And in this wondrous sort as they be Twins Like Male and Female they be Androgines, The Man is partly Woman, likewise shee Is partly Man, and yet in face they be Full as prodigious, as in parts; the Twinne That is most man, yet in the face and skinne, Is all meere Woman, that which most doth take From weaker woman: Nature seemes to make A man in show, thereby as to define, A Fem'nine man, a woman Masculine; Before bred, nor begott: a more strange thing, Then ever Nile, yet into light could bring, Made as Creation meerely to dispight, Nor man, nor woman, scarse Hermophradite. Affricke thats said, Mother of Monsters is, Let her but shew me such a one as this And then I will subscribe (to doe her due,) And sweare, that what is said of her is true. Quoth one, tis monstrous, and for nothing fitt, And for a Monster, quicke lets bury it; Nay quoth another, rather make provision, If possibly, to part it by incision, For were it parted, for ought I can see, Both man, and woman it may seeme to be: Nay, quoth a third that must be done with cost, And were it done, our labour is but lost, For when w'have wrought the utmost that we can, Hee's too much woman, and shee's too much man; Therefore, as 'tis a most prodigious birth, Let it not live here to polute the earth: Gossip (quoth th'last) your reason I denie, Tis more by law, then we can justifie; For Syer, and Dam, have certainly decreed, That they will have more comfort of their seed: For he begot it, and t'was borne of her, And out of doubt they will their owne prefer: Therefore good women better be advis'd, “For precious things should not be lightly priz'd. This Moone-Calfe borne under a lucky Fate, May powerfull prove in many a wealthy State, And taught the tongues about some fewe yeares hence, As now w'are all tongue, and but little sence: It may fall out for any thing you knowe, This Moone-Calfe may on great imployments goe: When learned men for noble action fit, Idly at home (unthought of once) may sit; A Bawd, or a Projector he may prove, And by his purse so purchasing him love, May be exalted to some thriving roome, Where sildome good men suffred are to come: What will you say, hereafter when you see; The times so gracelesse and so mad to be; That men their perfect humane shape shall flie, To imitate this Beasts deformitie: Nay, when you see this Monster, which you now Will hardly breath upon the earth alowe; In his Caroch with foure white Frizelands drawne, And he as pyde and garish as the Pawne, With a set face; in which as in a booke, He thinks the World for grounds of State should looke, When to some greater one, whose might doth awe him, Hee's knowne a verier Jade, then those that drawe him. Nay at the last, the very killing sight, To see this Calfe (as vertue to dispight) Above just honest men his head to reare, Nor to his greatnesse may they once come neere. Each ignorant Sott to Honour seekes to rise; But as for vertue who did first devise That title, a reward for hers to be, As most contemned and dispised shee, Goes unregarded, that they who should owne her, Dare not take notice ever to have knowne her; And but that vertue, when she seemeth throwne Lower then Hell, hath power to raise her owne, Above the World, and this her monstrous birth, She long e're this had perish'd from the earth; Her Fautors banish'd by her foes so hie, Which looke so bigge as they would scale the skie: But seeing no helpe, why should I thus complaine, Then to my Moone-Calfe I returne againe, By his deare Dam the World, so choysely bred, To whom there is such greatnesse promised; For it might well a perfect man amaze, To see what meanes the Syer and Dam will raise, T'exalt their Moone-Calfe, and him so to cherish, That he shall thrive, when vertuous men shall perish. The Drunkard, Glutton, or who doth apply, Himselfe to beastly sensuality, Shall get him many friends, for that there be, Many in ev'ry place just such as he; The evill, love them that delight in ill, Like have cleav'd to their like, and ever will: But the true vertuous man (God knowes) hath fewe, They that his straite and harder steps pursue, Are a small number, scarsely knowne of any; “God hath fewe friends, the devill hath so many. But to returne, that yee may plainly see, That such a one he likely is to be, And that my words for truth that yee may trie, Of the Worlds Babe thus doe I prophecie: Marke but the more man of these monstrous Twins, From his first youth, how tow'rdly he begins, When he should learne, being learn'd to leave the Schoole, This arrant Moone-Calfe, this most beastly foole, Just to our English Proverbe shall be seene, “Scarcely so wise at fifty, as fifteene: And when himselfe he of his home can free, He to the Citie comes, where then if he, And the familiar Butterflye his Page, Can passe the Street, the Ord'nary, and Stage, It is enough, and he himselfe thinkes then, To be the onely absolut'st of men. Then in his Cups you shall not see him shrinke, To the grand Divell a Carouse to drinke. Next to his Whore he doth himselfe apply, And to maintaine his gotish luxurie, Eates Capons Cookt at fifteene crownes a peece, With their fat bellies, stuff'd with Amber greece; And being to travell, he sticks not to lay, His Post Caroches still upon his way: And in some sixe dayes journey doth consume Ten pounds in Suckets and the Indian Fume: For his Attire, then Forraigne parts are sought, He holds all vile in England that is wrought, And into Flanders sendeth for the nonce, Twelve dozen of Shirts providing him at once, Layd in the seames with costly Lace that be, Of the Smock fashion, whole belowe the knee, Then bathes in milke, in which when he hath bin, He lookes like one for the preposterous sin, Put by the wicked and rebellious Jewes, To be a Pathique in their Malekind Stewes. With the ball of's foot the ground he may not feele, But he must tread upon his toe and heele: Dublet, and Cloke, with Plush and Velvet linde, Onely his head peece, that is fill'd with winde; Rags, running Horses, Dogs, Drabs, Drinke, and Dice, The onely things that he doth hold in price: Yet more then these, naught doth him so delight, As doth his smooth-chind, plump-thigh'd, Catamite. Sodome for her great sinne that burning sanke, Which at one draught the pit infernall dranke, Which that just God on earth could not abide, Hath she so much the Divels terifide: As from their seate, them well-neere to exile, Hath Hell new spew'd her up after this while: Is she new risen, and her sinne agen Imbrac'd by beastly and outragious men. Nay more he jests at Incest, as therein There were no fault, counts sacriledge no sin: His blasphemies he useth for his grace; Wherewith, he truth doth often times out-face: He termeth vertue madnesse, or meere folly, He hates all high things, and prophanes all holy. Where is thy thunder god, art thou a sleepe? Or to what suff'ring hand giv'st thou to keepe Thy wrath and vengeance; where is now the strength Of thy Almighty arme, failes it at length? Turne all the Starres to Comets, to out-stare The Sunne at noone-tide, that he shall not dare To looke but like a Gloworme, for that he Can without melting these damnations see. But this Ile leave, lest I my pen defile; Yet to my Moone-Calfe keepe I close the while, Who by some Knave, perswaded he hath wit, When like a brave Foole, he to utter it, Dare with a desperate boldnesse roughly passe His censure on those Bookes, which the poore Asse Can never reach to, things from darknesse sought, That to the light with blood and sweat were brought: And takes upon him those things to controle, Which should the brainelesse Ideot sell his soule, All his dull race, and he, can never buy With their base pelfe, his glorious industry; Knowledge with him is idle, if it straine Above the compasse of his yestie braine: Nor knowes mens worthes but by a second hand, For he himselfe doth nothing understand; He would have some thing, but what tis he showes not, What he would speake, nay what to thinke he knowes not: He nothing more then truth and knowledge loathes, And nothing he admires of mans, but cloathes. Now for that I thy dotage dare mislike, And seeme so deepe, into thy soule to strike; Because I am so plaine thou lik'st not me, Why know, poore Slave, I no more thinke of thee, Then of the Ordure that is cast abroad, I hate thy vice more then I doe a Toade. Poore is the spirit that fawnes on thy applause; Or seekes for suffrage from thy barbarous jawes. Misfortune light on him, that ought doth way, Yee sonnes of Beliall, what yee thinke or say. Who would have thought, whilst wit sought to advance, It selfe so high, damn'd beastly ignorance; Under the cloake of knowledge should creepe in, And from desert should so much credite win; But all this poysonous froth Hell hath let flie, In these last dayes, at noble Poesie, That which hath had both in all times and places, For her much worth, so sundry soveraigne graces; The language, which the Spheares and Angels speake, In which their minde they to poore Mortalls breake By Gods great power, into rich soules infus'd, By every Moone-Calfe lately thus abus'd: Should all hells blacke inhabitants conspire, And more unheard of mischiefe, to them hyer; Such as high Heav'n were able to affright, And on the noone-sted bring a double night: Then they have done, they could not more disgrace her, As from the earth (even) utterly to race her: What Princes lov'd, by Pesants now made hatefull, In this our age so damnably ingratefull: And to give open passage to her fall, It is devis'd to blemish her withall; That th'hideous braying of each barbarous Asse, In Printed Letters freely now must passe. In Accents so untuneable and vile, With other Nations as might damne our Ile, If so our tongue they truly understood, And make them thinke our braines were meerely mud. To make her vile, and ugly, to appeare, Whose naturall beauty is Divinely cleare; That on the Stationers Stall, who passing lookes, To see the multiplicity of Bookes, That pester it, may well beleeve the Presse, Sicke of a surfet, spu'd with the excesse: Which breedeth such a dulnesse through the Land, Mongst those one tongue which onely understand, Which did they reade those sinewie Poems writ, That are materiall relishing of wit: Wise pollicie, Morallity, or Story, Well purtraying the Ancients and their glory, These blinded Fooles, on their base Carion feeding, Which are (in truth) made ignorant by reading, In little time would growe to be asham'd, And blush to heare those lowzie Pamphlets nam'd, Which now they studie, naught but folly learning, Which is the cause that they have no discerning, The good from bad, this ill, that well to know, Because in ignorance they are nourish'd so; Who for this hatefull trash should I condemne They that doe utter, or Authorize them: O that the Ancients should so carefull be, Of what they did impresse, and onely we Loosely at randome, should let all things flie, Though gainst the Muses it be blasphemie: But yet to happy spirits, and to the wise, All is but foolish that they can devise, For when contempt of Poesie is proudest, Then have the Muses ever sung the loudest. But to my Calfe, who to be counted prime, According to the fashion of the time, Him to associate some Buffoon doth get, Whose braines he still, with much expence must whet, And ever beare about him as his guest, Who comming out with some ridiculous jest, Of one (perhaps) a god that well might be, If but compar'd with such an Asse as he, His Patron rores with laughter, and doth crye, Take him away, or presently I dye. Whilst that Knave-foole which well himselfe doth knowe, Smiles at the Coxcombe, which admires him so: His time and wealth, thus lewdly that doth spend, As it were lent him to no other end: Untill this Moone-Calfe, this most drunken puffe, Even like a Candle burnt into the snuffe: Fierd with surfet, in his owne greace fries, Sparkles a little, and then stinking dies. The wealth his Father by extortion wonne, Thus in the spending helps to damne the Sonne, And so falls out indifferently to either, Whereby in hell they justly meete together; And yet the World much joyes in her behalfe, And takes no little pleasure in her Calfe, Had this declining time the Freedome now, Which the brave Romane once did it alowe: With Wyer and Whipcord yee should see her payde, Till the luxurious Whore should be afrayde Of prostitution, and such lashes given, To make her blood spirt in the face of Heaven; That men by looking upward as they goe, Should see the plagues layd on her here belowe. But now proceede we with the other Twin Which is most woman who shall soone begin To shew her selfe; no sooner got the Teenes, But her owne naturall beauty she disdaines, With Oyles and Broathes most venomous and base, Shee plaisters over her well-favoured face; And those sweet veynes by nature rightly plac'd, Wherewith she seem'd that white skin to have lac'd, Shee soone doth alter; and with fading blewe, Blanching her bosome, she makes others newe; Blotting the curious workmanship of nature; That e're she be arriv'd at her full stature, E're she be drest, she seemeth aged growne, And to have nothing on her of her owne: Her black, browne, aburne or her yellow hayre, Naturally lovely, she doth scorne to weare; It must be white to make it fresh to show, And with compounded meale she makes it so: With fumes and powdrings raising such a smoke, That a whole Region able were to choke: Whose stench might fright a Dragon from his den, The Sunne yet ne're exhal'd from any Fen; Such pestilencious vapours as arise, From their French Powdrings, and their Mercuries. Ireland, if thou wilt able be alone, Of thine owne power to drive out thy Tyrone: By heaping up a masse of Coyne together, Sheere thy olde Wolves, and send their Fleeces hether. Thy white Goates hayre, Wales, dearer will be solde Then silke of Naples, or then Thred of golde. Our Water-dogs, and Islands here are shorne; White haire so much of women here is worne. Nay more then this, they'll any thing endure, And with large summes they stick not to procure: Hayre from the dead, yea and the most uncleane, To helpe their pride they nothing will disdaine. Then in attiring her, and in her sleepe, The dayes three parts she exercis'd doth keepe, And in ridiculous visits she doth spend The other fourth part, to no other end; But to take note how such a Lady lies, And to gleane from her some deformities, Which for a grace she holds, and till she get, She thinkes her selfe to be but counterfet. Our Merchants from all parts twixt either Inde, Cannot get Silke to satisfie her minde: Nor Natures perfect'st patternes can suffise, The curious draughts for her imbroyderies: She thinks her honour utterly is lost, Except those things doe infinitely cost Which she doth weare; nor thinke they can her dresse, Except she have them in most strange excesse. And in her fashion she is likewise thus, In every thing she must be monstrous: Her Picadell above her crowne up-beares; Her Fardingale is set above her eares: Which like a broad sayle with the winde doth swell, To drive this faire Hulke headlong into Hell. After againe, note, and you shall her see, Shorne like a man, and for that she will be Like him in all, her congies she will make, With the mans curtsie, and her Hat off take, Of the French fashion, and weare by her side Her sharpe Stillato in a Ryband tide, Then gird her selfe close to the paps she shall, Shap'd, breast, and buttock, but no waste at all. But of this she Calfe now, to cease all strife; The roring female Moone-Calfe. Ile by example lim her to the life. Not long agone it was my chance to meete With such a Fury, such a female spright; As never man sawe yet, except twere shee, And such a one as I may never see Againe I pray: but where I will not name, For that the place might so pertake her shame: But when I sawe her rampant to transcend All womenhead, I thought her (sure) a friend, And to my selfe my thoughts suggested thus, That she was gotten by some Incubus, And so remembring an olde womans tale, As she sate dreaming o'r a pot of Ale, That on a time she did the Devill meete, And knew him onely by his cloven feete: So did I looke at hers, where she did goe, To see if her feete, were not cloven so. Ten long-tongu'd Tapsters in a common In, When as the Guests to flock apace begin, When up-stayre one, down-stayre another hies, With squeaking clamours, and confused cries; Never did yet make such a noyse as she, That I dare boldly justifie, that he, Who but one houre her lowd clack can endure, May undisturbed, safely, and secure Sleepe under any Bells, and never heare Though they were rung, the clappers at his eare, And the long'st night with one sweet sleepe beguile, As though he dreamt of Musick all the while. The very sight of her when she doth rore, Is able to strike dumbe the boldest Whore That ever traded: shee'll not stick to tell, All in her life that ever her befell; How she hath layne, with all degrees, and ages, Her Plow-Boyes, Scullians, Lackies, and some Pages, And sweare when we have said all that we can, That there is nothing worth a pin in man, And that there's nothing doth so please her minde, As to see Mares, and Horses, doe their kinde; And when she's Tipsey, how so e're t'offend, Then all her speech to Bawdry doth intend: In Womens secrets, and shee'll name yee all Red to the Midwives at the Surgeons Hall. Were the poore Coxcomb, her dull Husband dead, He that durst then this female Moone-Calfe wed, Should quite put downe the Roman which once leepe, Into the burning Gulfe, thereby to keepe His Country from devouring with the flame: Thus leave we her, of all her sex the shame. Amongst the rest, at the Worlds labour there, Foure good olde women, most especiall were, Which had beene jolly Wenches in their dayes, Through all the Parish, and had borne the praise, For merry Tales: one Mother Red-Cap hight, And mother Howlet, somewhat ill of sight, For she had hurt her eyes with watching late; Then mother Bumby a mad jocound Mate As ever Gossipt, and with her there came Olde Gammer Gurton, a right pleasant Dame, As the best of them; being thus together, The businesse done for which they had come thither: Quoth jolly mother Red-Cap at the last, I see the night is quickly like to waste; And since the World so kindly now is layde, And the childe safe, which made us all afraide: Let's have a night on't wenches, hang up sorrow, And what sleepe wants now, take it up to morrow. Stirre up the fire, and let us have our Ale, And o'r our Cups, let's each one tell her Tale: My honest Gossips, and to put you in, Ile breake the Ice, and thus doth mine begin. There was a certaine Prophesie of olde, Mother Red-Caps Tale. Which to an Ile had anciently beene tolde, That after many yeares were com'n and gone, Which then came out, and the set time came on; Nay, more it told, the very day and howre, Wherein should fall so violent a showre; That it new Rivers in the earth should weare, And Dorps, and Bridges quite away should beare: But where this Ile is, that I cannot showe, Let them enquire that have desire to knowe: The Story leaves out that, let it alone; And Gossip with my Tale I will goe on: Yet what was worse the Prophecie this spake, (As to warne men defence for it to make) That upon whom one drop should chance to light, They should of reason be deprived quite. This Prophecie had many an Age beene heard, But not a man did it one pin reguard; For all to folly did themselves dispose, (On veryer Calves the Sunne yet never rose) And of their laughter made it all the Theame, By terming it, the drunken Wizards Dreame. There was one honest man amongst the rest, That bare more perfect knowledge in his breast; And to himselfe his private houres had kept, To talke with God, whilst others drunke or slept, Who in his mercy to this man reveal'd, That which in Justice he had long conceal'd From the rude Heard, but let them still runne on The ready way to their destruction. This honest man the Prophecie that noted, And things therein more curiously had quoted, Found all those signes were truly come to passe, That should fore-showe this raine, and that it was Neerely at hand; and from his depth of skill, Had many a time fore-warn'd them of their ill, And Preach'd to them this Deluge (for their good) As to th'olde World Noe did before the Flood; But lost his labour, and since t'was in vaine, To talke more to those Idiots of the raine; He let them rest: and silent sought about, Where he might finde some place of safety out, To shroud himselfe in, for right well he knewe, That from this shower, which then began to brewe, No roofe of Tyle, or Thatch he could come in, Could serve him from being wet to the bare skin. At length this man bethought him of a Cave In a huge Rock, which likely was to save Him from the'shower, upon a hill so steepe, As up the same a man could hardly creepe, So that except Noahs Flood should come againe, He never could be raught by any raine; Thither at length, though with much toyle he clome, Listning to heare what would thereof become. It was not long e're he perceiv'd the skies Setled to raine, and a black cloud arise, Whose foggy grosnesse so oppos'd the light, As it would turne the noone-sted into night. When the winde came about with all his power, Into the tayle of this approching shower, And it to lighten presently began; Quicker then thought, from East to West that ran: The Thunder following did so fiercely rave, And through the thick clouds with such fury drave, As Hell had been set open for the nonce, And all the Divels heard to rore at once: And soone the Tempest so outragious grew, That it whole hedgerowes by the roots up threw, So wondrously prodigious was the weather, As heaven and earth had meant to goe together: And downe the shower impetuously doth fall, Like that which men the Hurricano call: As the grand Deluge had beene come againe, And all the World should perish by the raine. And long it lasted; all which time this man Hid in the Cave doth in his judgement scan, What of this inundation would ensue, For he knew well the Prophecie was true: And when the shower was somwhat over-past, And that the skies began to cleare at last: To the Caves mouth he softly put his eare, To listen if he any thing could heare: What harme this storme had done, and what became Of those that had beene sowsed in the same. No sooner he that nimble Organ lent To the Caves mouth; but that incontinent There was a noyse as if the Garden Beares, And all the Dogs together by the eares, And those of Bedlam had enlarged bin, And to behold the Bayting had come in: Which when he heard, he knew too well alasse, That what had beene fore-told, was come to passe; Within himselfe good man, he reasoned thus: Tis for our sinnes, this plague is falne on us. Of all the rest, though in my wits I be, (I thanke my Maker) yet it greeveth me, To see my Country in this piteous case; Woe's me that ever they so wanted grace: But when as man once casts off vertue quite, And doth in sinne and beastlinesse delight, We see how soone God turnes him to a Sot: To showe my selfe yet a true Patriot, Ile in amongst them, and if so, that they Be not accurst of God, yet, yet I may, By wholesome counsell (if they can but heare) Make them as perfect as at first they were, And thus resolv'd goes this good poore man downe; When at the entrance of the Neighbouring Towne, He meetes a woman, with her Buttocks bare, Got up a stride upon a wall-eyde Mare, To runne a Horse-race, and was like to ride Over the good man: but he stept aside; And after her, another that bestroad A Horse of Service, with a Lance she rode Arm'd, and behinde her on a Pillian satt Her frantique Husband, in a broad-brim'd Hatt, A Maske and Safeguard; and had in his hand His mad Wifes Distaffe for a ryding Wand: Scarse from these mad folke, had he gone so farre, As a strong man, will eas'ly pitch a Barre: But that he found a Youth in Tissue brave, (A daintier man one would not wish to have) Was courting of a loathsome mezzeld Sowe, And in his judgement, swore he must alowe Hers, the prime Beauty, that he ever sawe, Thus was she sued to (by that prating Dawe) Who, on a dunghill in the loathsome gore, Had farrowed ten Pigs scarce an houre before. At which this man in melancholly deepe, Burst into laughter, like before to weepe. Another foole, to fit him for the weather, Had arm'd his heeles with Cork, his head with feather; And in more strange and sundry colours clad, Then in the Raine-bowe ever can be had: Stalk'd through the Streets, preparing him to flie, Up to the Moone upon an Embassie. Another seeing his drunken Wife disgorge Her pamperd stomack, got her to a Forge, And in her throat the Feverous heat to quench With the Smiths horne, was giving her a Drench: One his next Neighbour haltred had by force, So frantique, that he tooke him for a Horse, And to a Pond was leading him to drinke; It went beyond the wit of man to thinke, The sundry frenzies that he there might see, One man would to another married be: And for a Curate taking the Towne Bull, Would have him knit the knot: another Gull Had found an Ape was chained to a Stall, Which he to worship on his knees doth fall; To doe the like and doth his Neighbours get, Who in a Chaire this ill-fac'd Munky set, And on their shoulders lifting him on hie, They in Procession beare him with a crie; And him a Lord will have at least, if not, A greater man: another sort had got About a Pedlar, who had lately heard, How with the mad men of this Ile it far'd: And having nothing in his Pack but toyes, Which none except meere mad men, &amp; fond boyes Would ever touch; thought verily that he Amongst these Bedlams, would a gayner be, Or else loose all; scarce had he pitch'd his Pack, E're he could scarcely say, what doe yee lack: But that they throng'd about him with their mony, As thick as Flyes about a Pot of hony; Some of these Lunaticks, these frantique Asses, Gave him Spurryalls for his farthing Glasses: There should you see another of these Cattell, Give him a pound of silver for a Rattle; And there another that would needsly scorse, A costly Jewell for a Hobby-Horse: For Bells, and Babies, such as children small, Are ever us'd to solace them withall: Those they did buy at such a costly rate, That it was able to subvert a State; Which when this wise and sober man beheld, For very griefe his eyes with teares were sweld. Alas, that e're I sawe this day (quoth he) That I my Native Country-men should see In this estate; when out of very zeale Both to his native earth, and common-weale, He thrust amongst them, &amp; thus frames his speech. Deare Country-men, I humbly yee beseech Heare me a little, and but marke me well. Alas, it is not long, since first yee fell Into this frenzie, these outragious fits, Be not I pray yee so out of your wits: But call to minde th'inevitable ill Must fall on yee, if yee continue still Thus mad and frantique; therefore be not worse Then your brute beasts to bring thereby a Curse Upon your Nephewes, so to taynt their blood, That twenty Generations shall be woo'd; And this brave Land for wit, that hath been fam'd, The Ile of Ideots after shall be nam'd: Your braines are not so craz'd, but leave this Ryot, And tis no question, but with temperate Dyet, And counsaile of wise men, when they shall see The desperate estate wherein you be: But with such med'cines as they will apply, They'll quickly cure your greevous malady. And as he would proceed with his Oration, One of the chiefest of this Bedlam Nation; Layes hold on him, and askes who he should be. Thou fellow (quoth this Lord) where had we thee, Com'st thou to Preach to us that be so wise, What wilt thou take upon thee to advise Us, of whom all now underneath the skie, May well be seene to learne frugality: Why surely honest fellow thou art mad. Another standing by, swore that he had Seene him in Bedlam, foureteene yeeres agoe: O quoth a third this fellow doe I knowe. This is an arrant Coxcomb, a meere Dizard, If yee remember, this is the same Wizard, Which tooke upon him wisely to fore-tell, The shower so many yeares before it fell: Whose strong effects being so strange and rare, Hath made us such brave creatures as we are: When of this Nation all the frantique Route, Fell into laughter the poore man about. Some made mouthes at him, others as in scorne With their forkt fingers poynted him the horne: They call'd him Asse, and Dolt, and bad him goe Amongst such Fooles, as he himselfe was, who Could not teach them: at which this honest man, Finding that naught, but hate and scorne he wan Amongst these Ideots, and their beastly kinde, The poore small remnant of his life behinde, Determineth to solitude to give, And a true Hermite afterward to live. The tale thus ended, Gossip by your leave; The morallity of mother Red-Caps tale. Quoth mother Bumby, I doe well perceive The morrall of your Story, which is this; (Correct me Dame, if I doe judge amisse) But first Ile tell you by this honest Ale, In my conceite this is a prety tale; And if some hansome Players would it take, It (sure) a pretty Interlude would make. But to the Morrall, this same mighty shower Is a plague sent by supernaturall power Upon the wicked, for when God intends To lay a curse on mens ungodly ends: Of understanding he doth them deprive; Which taken from them, up themselves they give To beastlinesse, nor will he let them see The miserable estate wherein they be. The Rock to which this man for safety climes, The contemplation is of the sad times Of the declining World; his counsailes tolde To the mad Route, to spoyle and basenesse solde, Showes that from such no goodnesse can proceede, Who counsailes fooles, shall never better speede. Quoth mother Red-Cap, you have hit it right: (Quoth she) I know it Gossip, and to quite Your tale; another you of me shall have, Therefore a while your patience let me crave. Mother Bumbyes tale.Out in the North tow'rds Groneland farre away, There was a Witch (as ancient Stories say) As in those parts there many Witches be: Yet in her craft above all other, shee Was the most expert, dwelling in an Ile, Which was in compasse scarce an English mile; Which by her cunning she could make to floate Whether she list, as though it were a Boate: And where againe she meant to have it stay, There could she fixe it in the deepest Sea: She could sell windes to any one that would, Buy them for money, forcing them to hold What time she listed, tye them in a thrid, Which ever as the Sea-farer undid They rose or scantled, as his Sayles would drive, To the same Port whereas he would arive: She by her Spels could make the Moone to stay, And from the East, she could keepe back the day, Raise Mists and Fogs that could Ecclipse the light: And with the noone-sted she could mixe the night. Upon this Ile whereas she had aboad, Nature (God knowes) but little cost bestow'd: Yet in the same, some Bastard creature were Seldome yet seene in any place but there; Halfe men, halfe Goate, there was a certaine kinde, Such as we Satyres purtray'd out doe finde. Another sort of a most ugly shape; A Beare in body, and in face an Ape: Other like Beasts yet had the feete of Fowles, That Demy-Urchins weare, and Demy-Owles: Besides there were of sundry other sorts, But wee'll not stand too long on these reports. Of all the rest that most resembled man, Was an o'r-worne ill-favoured Babian; Which of all other, for that onely he, Was full of tricks, as they are us'd to be: Him in her Craft, so seriously she taught, As that in little time she had him brought, That nothing could before this Ape be set, That presently he could not counterfet; She learnt him med'cines instantly to make; Him any thing whose shape he pleas'd to take: And when this skill she had on him bestow'd, She sent him for intelligence abroad. Thus fully furnish'd, and by her sent out, Hee went to practise all the World about. He like a Jipsey oftentimes would goe, All kinde of Gibb'rish he had learnt to knowe, And with a stick, a short string, and a noose, Would showe the people tricks at fast and loose: Tell folkes their Fortunes, for he would finde out By slye enquirie, as he went about: What chance this one he, or that she had prov'd Whom they most hated, or whom most they lov'd, And looking in their hands, as there he knew it, Out of his skill would counterfet to shew it: Sometimes he for a Mountebanke would passe, And shew you in a Crusible, or Glasse: Some rare extraction, presently and runne, Through all the Cures that he therewith had done, An Aspick still he caried in a poke, Which he to bite him often would provoke, And with an oyle when it began to swell, The deadly poyson quickly could expell: And many times a Jugler he would be, (A craftier Knave there never was then he;) And by a mist deceiving of the sight, (As knavery ever falsifies the light) He by his active nimblenesse of hand, Into a Serpent would transforme a Wand As those Egyptians, which by Magick thought, Farre beyond Moyses wonders to have wrought, There never was a subtility devis'd, In which this villaine was not exercis'd. Now from this Region where they dwelt, not far There was a wise and learn'd Astronomer, Who skilfull in the Planetary howres, The working knew of the Celestiall powers. And by their ill, or by their good aspect, Men in their actions wisely could direct, And in the black and gloomy Arts so skild, That he (even) Hell in his subjection hild; He could command the Spirits up from belowe, And binde them strongly, till they let him knowe All the drad secrets that belong'd them to, And what those did, with whom they had to do. This Wizard in his knowledge most profound, Sitting one day the depth of things to sound; For that the World was brought to such a passe, That it well-neere in a confusion was; For things set right, ranne quickly out of frame, And those a wry to rare perfection came: And matters in such sort about were brought, That States were pusled, almost beyond thought, Which made him think (as he might very well) There were more Divels then he knew in hell. And thus resolves that he would cast about In his best skill, to find the Engine out That wrought all this, and put himselfe therein: When in this bus'nesse long he had not bin, But by the Spirits which he had sent abroad, And in this worke, had every way bestow'd; He came to know this foule Witch, and her Factor, The one the Plotter, and the other th'Actor Of all these stirres, which many a State had spoyl'd, Whereby the World so long had beene turmoyl'd, Wherefore he thought it much did him behove, Out of the way this couple to remove; Or (out of question) halfe the World e're long Would be divided, hers, and his among. When turning over his most mistique bookes, Into the secrets of his Art he lookes; And th'earth and th'ayre doth with such Magiques fill That every place was troubled by his skill; Whilst in his minde he many a thing revolves, Till at the last, he with himselfe resolves; One Spirit of his should take the Witches shape, Another in the person of the Ape, Should be joyn'd with him, so to prove by this, Whether their power were lesse, or more then his; Which he performes, and to their taske them sets, When soon that Spirit, the Witch that counterfets, Watch'd till he found her farre abroad to be, Into the place, then of her home gets he: And when the Babian came the newes to bring What he had done abroad, and ev'ry thing Which he had plotted, how their bus'nesse went, And in the rest to know her drad intent, Where she was wont to call him her deare sonne, Her little Play-feere, and her pretty Bun: Hug him, and sweare he was her onely joy; Her very Hermes, her most dainty Boy, O most strange thing: she chang'd her wonted cheare, And doth to him most terrible appeare: And in most fearefull shapes she doth him threaten With eager lookes, as him she would have eaten, That from her presence he was forc'd to flye, As from his death, or deadly enemie. When now the second which the shape doth take Of the Baboon, determining to make The like sport with him, his best time doth watch, When he alone the cursed Witch might catch; And when her Factor farthest was remote, Then he began to change his former note, And where he wont to tell her pleasing stories Full of their Conquests, Triumphes, and their glories, He turnes his Tale, and to the Witch relates The strange revolts of Tributary States, Things gotten backe, which late they had for prize, With new discoveries of their pollicies; Disgusts and dangers that had crost their cunning, With sad portents, their ruine still forrunning; That thus the Witch and the Baboon deceiv'd Of all their hopes, of all their joyes bereav'd, As in dispaire doe bid the world adue. When as the Ape which weake and sickely grew, On the cold earth his scurvy caryon layes, And worne to nothing, endes his wretched dayes: The filthy Hagg abhorring of the light, Into the North past Thule takes her flight, And in those deepes, past which no Land is found, Her wretched selfe she miserably drownd. The tale thus ended, mother Owle doth take Her turne, and thus to mother Bumby spake; The tale our Gossip Red-cap told before You so well ridled that there can no more Be said of it; and therefore as your due, What you have done for her, Ile doe for you. And thus it is, that same notorious Witch, The morallity of mother Bumbyes tale. Is the ambition men have to be rich, And Great, for which all faith aside they lay, And to the Devill give themselves away, The floating Ile where she is said to wonne, The various courses are through which they ronne, To get their endes, and by the Ape is ment, Those damned Villaines, made the Instrument To their disignes, that wondrous man of skill, Sound counsell is, or rather if you will, The Divine Justice, which doth bring to light, Their wicked plotts not raught by common sight For though they never have so closely wrought, Yet to confusion lastly they are brought. Gossip, indeede, you have hit it to a haire, And surely your Moralitie is rare, Quoth Mother Bumby; Mother Owle replide, Come, come, I know I was not very wide, Wherefore to quit your Tales, and make them three, My honest Gossips listen now to me. There was a man, not long since dead, but hee Rather a Devill might accounted be: For Judgement at her best could hardly scan, Whether he were more Devill, or more man; And as he was, he did himselfe apply T'all kind of Witchcraft, and blacke Sorcery: And for his humor naturally stood, To Theft, to Rapine, and to shedding blood. By those damn'd Hags with whom he was in grace, And usd to meet in many a secret place; He learnt an hearb of such a wondrous power, That were it gather'd at a certaine howre, (For Nature for the same did so provide, As though from knowledge gladly it to hide, For at Sunset it selfe it did disclose, And shutt it selfe up, as the Morning rose) That with thrice saying a strange Magique spell, Which but to him, to no man they would tell, When as so e'r that simple he would take, It him a war-wolfe instantly would make, Which put in practise he most certaine prov'd, When to a Forrest he himselfe remov'd, Through which there lay a plaine and common Roade, Which he the place chose for his chiefe abode, And there this Monster set him downe to theeve, Nothing but stolne goods might this Fiend releeve; No silly woman, by that way could passe, But by this Woolfe she surely ravisht was, And if he found her flesh were soft and good, What serv'd for Lust, must also serve for foode. Into a Village he sometime would gett, And watching there (as for the purpose sett) For little Children when they came to play, The fattst he ever bore with him away; And as the people oft were wont to rise, Following with Hubbubs and confused cries: Yet was he so well breathed, and so light, That he would still outstrip them by his flight; And making straight to the tall Forrest neare, Of the sweet Flesh would have his Junkets there. And let the Shepheards doe the best they could; Yet would he venter oft upon the Fold: And taking the fatt'st Sheepe he there could finde: Beare him away, and leave the Dogs behinde: Nor could men keepe, so much as Pig, or Lamb, But it no sooner, could drop from the Dam, By hooke or crooke, but he would surely catch, Though with their weapons all the Towne should watch. Amongst the rest there was a silly Asse, That on the way by Fortune chanc'd to passe, Yet (it was true) he in his time had bin A very perfect man, in shape, and skin: But by a Witch envying (his estate) That had borne to him a most deadly hate, Into this shape he was transform'd, and so, From place to place, he wandred to and fro; And often times was taken for a stray, And in the Pinfold many a time he lay; Yet held he still the reason that he had When he was man, although he thus was clad In a poore Asses shape, wherein he goes, And must endure what Fortune will impose. Him on his way this cruell Woolfe doth take, His present prey, determining to make. He bray'd, and ror'd, to make the people heare: But it fell out, no creature being neare, The silly Asse when he had done his best, Must walke the common way amongst the rest: When tow'rds his den the cruell Woolfe him tugs, And by the eares most terribly him lugs: But as God would, he had no list to feed, Wherefore to keepe him till he should have need, The silly creature utterly forlorne, He brings into a Brake of Bryers and Thorne, And so entangles by the mane and tayle, That he might pluck, and struggle there, and hale, Till his breath left him, unlesse by great chance Some one might come for his deliverance. At length the people grievously annoy'd By this vile Woolfe, so many that destroy'd, Determined a Hunting they would make, To see if they by any meanes could take This ravenous War-Woolfe: and with them they bring Mastiffes, and Mungrells, all that in a string Could be gott out, or could but lugg a Hogg, Ball, Eateall, Cuttaile, Blackfoot, Bitch, and Dogg, Bills, Batts, and Clubs, the Angry men doe beare, The women eager as their husbands were With Spits, and Fireforkes, sware if they could catch him, It should goe hard, but they would soone dispatch him. This subtile Woolfe by Passengers that heard, What Forces thus against him were prepar'd, And by the noyse, that they were neere at hand, Thinking this Asse did nothing understand, Goes downe into a Spring that was hard by, (Which the Asse noted) and immediatly He came out perfect man, his Wolves shape left, In which so long he had committed theft. The silly Asse, so wistly then did view him, And in his fancie so exactly drew him, That he was sure to owne this Theefe agen, If he should see him mongst a thousand men. This Woolfe turn'd man, him instantly doth shrowd, In a neere thicket, till the boystrous crowd, Had somewhat past him, then he in doth fall Upon the Reare, not any of them all, Makes greater stirre, nor seemes to them to be, More diligent to finde the Woolfe then he: They beate each brake, and tuft o'r all the ground, But yet the War-Woolfe was not to be found: But a poore Asse entangled in the Bryers, In such strange sort, as every one desires To see the manner, and each one doth gather How he was fastned so, how he came thither. The silly Asse yet being still in holde, Makes all the meanes, that possibly he could, To be let loose, he hummes, he kneeles, and cryes, Shaketh his head, and turneth up his eyes, To move their pitty: that some said, t'was sure This Asse had sence of what he did endure: And at the last amongst themselves decreed To let him loose; the Asse no sooner freed, But out he goes the company among, And where he sawe the people thick'st to throng: There he thrusts in, and looketh round about: Here he runnes in, and there he rusheth out; That he was likely to have throwne to ground Those in the way, which when the people found, Though the poore Asse they seemed to disdaine, Follow'd him yet, to finde what he should meane, Untill by chance that he this Villaine mett; When he upon him furiously doth sett, Fastning his teeth upon him with such strength That he could not be loosed, till at the length Railing them in, the people make a ring, Strooke with the wonder of so strange a thing; Whilst they are cadg'd, contending whether can Conquer, the Asse some cry, some cry the man; Yet the Asse drag'd him, and still forward drue, Towards the strange Spring, which yet they never knewe: Yet to what part the strugling seem'd to sway, The people made a lane, and gave them way. At length the Asse, had tug'd him neere thereto, The people wondring what he meant to doe; He seem'd to show them with his foote the Well, Then with an Asse-like noise he seem'd to tell The Story, now by pointing to the men, Then to the Theefe, then to the Spring agen; At length wext angry, growing into passion, Because they could not finde his demonstration, T'expresse it more, he leapes into the Spring, When on the suddaine, O most wondrous thing, To change his shape he presently began, And at an instant became perfect man, Recovering speech; and comming forth, accus'd The bloody murtherer, who had so abus'd The honest people, and such harme had done; Before them all, and presently begunne To shew them, in what danger he had beene, And of this Woolfe the cruelty and sinne; How he came chang'd agen as he had prov'd: Whereat the people being strangely moov'd, Some on the head, some one the backe doe clape him, And in their armes, with shoutes and kisses hap him: Then all at once, upon the Warre-woolfe flue, And up and downe him on the earth they drewe; Then from his bones the flesh in Collops cut, And on their weapons points in Triumph put; Returning backe with a victorious song, Bearing the man aloft with them along. Quoth Gammer Gurton, on my honest word, You have told a Tale doth much conceit afford: Good neighbour Howlet, and as ye have done, Each one for other, since our tales begun, The morallity of mother Howlets tale.And since our Stand of Ale, so well endures, As you have moral'd Bumbyes, I will yours. The fable of the War-woolfe I apply, To a man, given to blood, and cruelty, And upon spoile doth only set his rest; Which by a wolfes shape livelyest is exprest. The spring by which he gets his former shape, Is the evasion after every rape, He hath to start by; and the silly Asse, Which unregarded, every where doth passe, Is some just soule, who though the world disdaine, Yet he by God is strangely made the meane, To bring his damned practises to light. Quoth mother Howlet you have hit the white, Gammer Gurtons tale.I thought as much quoth Gammer Gurton, then, My turne comes next, have with you once agen. A mighty Waste there in a countrey was, Yet not so great as it was poore of grasse; T'was said of old, a Saint once curst the soyle, So barren, and so hungry, that no toyle, Could ever make it any thing to beare; Nor would ought prosper, that was planted there. Upon the earth, the spring was seldome seene, T'was winter there, when each place else was green; When Summer did, her most aboundance yeild, That still lay browne, as any fallow field, Upon the same, some few trees scattering stood, But it was Autumne, ere they us'd to bud; And they were crookt, and knotty, and the leaves, The niggard sap, so utterly deceives, That sprouting forth, they drouping hung the head And were neere withered, ere yet fully spread, No mirthfull Birds, the boughes did ever grace, Nor could be wonne to stay upon that place, Onely the night-Crow sometimes, you might see, Croking to sit upon some Ranpick-tree, Which was but very seldome too, and then It boded great mortality to men; As were the trees, which on that common grew, So were the Cattell starvelings, and a few, Asses, and Mules, and they were us'd to gnaw, The very earth to fill the hungry mawe; When they far'd best, they fed on Fearne and brack, Their leane shrunke bellyes cleav'd up to their backe, Of all the rest, in that great Waste that went, Of those quicke caryons, the most eminent, Was a poore Mule, upon that common bred, And from his foling further never fed, The Summer well-neare every yeare was past, Ere he his ragged winter coate could cast, And then the Jade would get him to a tree, That had a rough Barke, purposely, where he Rubbing his Buttocks, and his either side Would get the old hayre, from his starved hyde, And though he were as naked as my naile, Yet he would whinny then, and wag the tayle, In this short pasture one day as he stood, Ready to faint amongst the rest for food; Yet the poore Beast according to his kinde, Bearing his nostrill up into the winde, A sweet fresh feeding thought that he did vent, “(Nothing as hunger sharpeneth so the sent) For that not far there was a goodly ground, Which with sweet grasse, so greatly did abound, That the fat soyle seem'd to be over fraught Nor could bestow the Burthen that it brought, Besides that bounteous nature did it stick, With sundry sorts of fragrant flowers so thick, That when the warme, and Baulmy southwinde blew The lushyous smells ore all the region flew. Led by his sence at length this poore Jade found, This pasture, (fenc'd though with a mighty Mound) A pale and quickeset, Cercling it about, That nothing could get in, nor nothing out) And with himselfe thus wittily doth caste, Well, I have found good pasture yet at last, If by some meanes accomplisht it might be, Round with the ditch imediatly walks he; (And long though 'twas, good luck nere comes too late,) It was his chance to light upon a gate That led into it, (though his hap were good) Yet was it made of so sufficient wood, And every barre that did to it belong, Was so well joynted, and so wondrous strong Besides a great locke, with a double ward, That he thereby of entrance was debar'd And thereby hard beset, yet thought at length, “T'was done by sleight, that was not done by strength; Fast in the ground his two fore-feete doth get, Then his hard Buttockes to the gate he set, And thrust, and shooke, and laboured till at last, The two great posts, that held the same so fast, Began to loosen, when againe he takes, Fresh foot-hould, and a fresh he shakes and shakes, Till the great Hindges to fly off he feeles; And heard the Gate, fall clattering at his heeles, Then nayes, and brayes, with such an open throat, That all the Waste resounded with his note; The rest that did his language understand, Knew well there was, some good to them in hand, And tag, and rag, through thick and thin came running, Nor dale, nor ditch, nor banke nor bushes shunning; And so desirous to see their good hap, That with their thrunging they stucke in the gap. Now they bestir their teeth, and doe devoure, More sweetnesse in the compasse of one hower, Then twice so many could in twice the time, For now the spring was in the very prime, Till prickt with plenty eas'd of all their lackes Their Pampred bellies swolne above their backes They tread and waddle all the goodly grasse, That in the field there scarse a corner was, Left free by them, and what they had not swallow'd There they had dung'd, and layd them down and wallow'd; One with another they would ly and play, And in the deepe fog batten all the day, Thus along while, this mery life they led Till (even) like Lard their thickned sides were fed; But on a time the weather being fayre, And season fit to take the pleasant ayre, To view his pasture the rich owner went, And see what grasse the fruitfull yeare had sent, Finding, the feeding for which he had toyld, To have kept safe, by these vile cattell spoil'd, He in a rage upon them sets his Cur, But for his bawling, not a beast would stir; Then whoots, and shouts, and claps his hands, but he Might as well move the dull earth, or a tree, As once but stir them, when all would not doe, Last, with his goad amongst them he doth goe, And some of them he girdeth in the Hanches; Some in the flanks, that prickt their very panches; But when they felt that they began to smart, Up on a suddaine they together start, And drive at him as fast as they could ding, They flirt, they yerk, they backward fluce, and fling, As though the Devill in their heeles had bin, That to escape the danger he was in, He back and back, into a quagmire by, Though with much perill, forced was to flye: But lightly treading there-upon doth shift, Out of the bog his cumbred feete to lift, When they the perill that doe not fore-cast, In the stiffe mud, are quickly stabled fast: When to the Towne he presently doth flie, Raising the Neighbours with a suddaine crie: With Cords and Halters that came all at once, For now the Jades were fitted for the nonce: For by that time th'had sunke themselves so deepe, That scarce their heads above ground they could keepe. When presently they by the necks them bound, And so they led them to the common pound. Quoth mother Red-Cap, right well have you done Good Gammer Gurton, and as we begun, So you conclude: tis time we parted now; But first of my morallity alowe. The common that you speake of here, say I, The morallity of Gammer Gurtons tale.Is nothing else but want and beggerie; In the World common, and the beasts that goe Upon the same, which oft are famish'd so: Are the poore bred in scarcitie; the Mule The other Cattell that doth seeme to rule, Some crafty fellow that hath slily found A way to thrive by; and the fruitfull ground Is wealth, which he by subtilty doth win, In his possession which not long hath bin; But he with Ryot and excesse doth waste, “For goods ill gotten doe consume as fast; And with the law they lastly doe contend, Till at the last the Prison is the end. Quoth Gammer Gurton, well your selfe you quite, By this the dawne usurpt upon the night; And at the windowe biddeth them good day When they departed each their severall way. FINIS. ELEGIES UPON SUNDRY OCCASIONS. OF HIS LADIES NOT COMMING TO LONDON. That ten-yeares-travell'd Greeke return'd from Sea Ne'r joyd so much to see his Ithaca, As I should you, who are alone to me, More then wide Greece could to that wanderer be, The winter windes still Easterly doe keepe, And with keene Frosts have chained up the deepe; The Sunne's to us a niggard of his Rayes, But revelleth with our Antipodes; And seldome to us when he shewes his head, Muffled in vapours, he straight hies to bed. In those bleake mountaines can you live where snowe Maketh the vales up to the hilles to growe; Whereas mens breathes doe instantly congeale, And attom'd mists turne instantly to hayle; Belike you thinke, from this more temperate cost, My sighes may have the power to thawe the frost, Which I from hence should swiftly send you thither, Yet not so swift, as you come slowly hither. How many a time, hath Phebe from her wayne, With Phæbus fires fill'd up her hornes againe; Shee through her Orbe, still on her course doth range, But you keepe yours still, nor for me will change. The Sunne that mounted the sterne Lions back, Shall with the Fishes shortly dive the Brack, But still you keepe your station, which confines You, nor regard him travelling the signes. Those ships which when you went, put out to Sea, Both to our Groenland, and Virginia, Are now return'd, and Custom'd have their fraught, Yet you arrive not, nor returne me ought. The Thames was not so frozen yet this yeare, As is my bosome, with the chilly feare Of your not comming, which on me doth light, As on those Climes, where halfe the world is night. Of every tedious houre you have made two, All this long Winter here, by missing you: Minutes are monthes, and when the houre is past, A yeare is ended since the Clocke strooke last, When your remembrance puts me on the Racke, And I should Swound to see an Almanacke, To reade what silent weekes away are slid, Since the dire Fates you from my sight have hid. I hate him who the first Devisor was Of this same foolish thing, the Hower-glasse, And of the Watch, whose dribbling sands and Wheele, With their slow stroakes, make mee too much to feele Your slackenesse hither, O how I doe ban, Him that these Dialls against walles began, Whose Snayly motion of the mooving hand, (Although it goe) yet seeme to me to stand; As though at Adam it had first set out, And had been stealing all this while about, And when it backe to the first point should come, It shall be then just at the generall Doome. The Seas into themselves retract their flowes, The changing Winde from every quarter blowes, Declining Winter in the Spring doth call, The Starrs rise to us, as from us they fall; Those Birdes we see, that leave us in the Prime, Againe in Autumne re-salute our Clime. Sure, either Nature you from kinde hath made, Or you delight else to be Retrograde. But I perceive by your attractive powers, Like an Inchantresse you have charm'd the howers Into short minutes, and have drawne them back, So that of us at London, you doe lack Almost a yeare, the Spring is scarse begonne There where you live, and Autumne almost done. With us more Eastward, surely you devise, By your strong Magicke, that the Sunne shall rise Where now it setts, and that in some few yeares You'l alter quite the Motion of the Spheares. Yes, and you meane, I shall complaine my love To gravell'd Walkes, or to a stupid Grove, Now your companions; and that you the while (As you are cruell) will sit by and smile, To make me write to these, while Passers by, Sleightly looke in your lovely face, where I See Beauties heaven, whilst silly blockheads, they Like laden Asses, plod upon their way, And wonder not, as you should point a Clowne Up to the Guards, or Ariadnes Crowne; Of Constellations, and his dulnesse tell, Hee'd thinke your words were certainly a Spell; Or him some peice from Creet, or Marcus show, In all his life which till that time ne'r saw Painting: except in Alehouse or old Hall Done by some Druzzler, of the Prodigall. Nay doe, stay still, whilst time away shall steale Your youth, and beautie, and your selfe conceale From me I pray you, you have now inur'd Me to your absence, and I have endur'd Your want this long, whilst I have starved bine For your short Letters, as you helde it sinne To write to me, that to appease my woe, I reade ore those, you writ a yeare agoe, Which are to me, as though they had bin made, Long time before the first Olympiad. For thankes and curt'sies sell your presence then To tatling Women, and to things like men, And be more foolish then the Indians are For Bells, for Knives, for Glasses, and such ware, That sell their Pearle and Gold, but here I stay, So would I not have you but come away. TO MASTER GEORGE SANDYS Treasurer for the English Colony in VIRGINIA. Friend, if you thinke my Papers may supplie You, with some strange omitted Noveltie, Which others Letters yet have left untould, You take me off, before I can take hould Of you at all; I put not thus to Sea, For two monthes Voyage to Virginia, With newes which now, a little something here, But will be nothing ere it can come there. I feare, as I doe Stabbing; this word, State, I dare not speake of the Palatinate, Although some men make it their hourely theame, And talke what's done in Austria, and in Beame, I may not so; what Spinola intends, Nor with his Dutch, which way Prince Maurice bends; To other men, although these things be free, Yet (George) they must be misteries to mee. I scarce dare praise a vertuous friend that's dead, Lest for my lines he should be censured; It was my hap before all other men To suffer shipwrack by my forward pen: When King James entred; at which joyfull time I taught his title to this Ile in rime: And to my part did all the Muses win, With high-pitch Pæans to applaud him in: When cowardise had tyed up every tongue, And all stood silent, yet for him I sung; And when before by danger I was dar'd, I kick'd her from me, nor a jot I spar'd. Yet had not my cleere spirit in Fortunes scorne, Me above earth and her afflictions borne; He next my God on whom I built my trust, Had left me troden lower then the dust: But let this passe; in the extreamest ill, Apollo's brood must be couragious still, Let Pies, and Dawes, sit dumb before their death, Onely the Swan sings at the parting breath. And (worthy George) by industry and use, Let's see what lines Virginia will produce; Goe on with Ovid, as you have begunne, With the first five Bookes; let your numbers run Glib as the former, so shall it live long, And doe much honour to the English tongue: Intice the Muses thither to repaire, Intreat them gently, trayne them to that ayre, For they from hence may thither hap to fly, T'wards the sad time which but to fast doth hie, For Poesie is followed with such spight, By groveling drones that never raught her height, That she must hence, she may no longer staye: The driery fates prefixed have the day, Of her departure, which is now come on, And they command her straight wayes to be gon; That bestiall heard so hotly her pursue, And to her succour, there be very few, Nay none at all, her wrongs that will redresse, But she must wander in the wildernesse, Like to the woman, which that holy John Beheld in Pathmos in his vision. As th'English now, so did the stiff-neckt Jewes, Their noble Prophets utterly refuse, And of those men such poore opinions had, They counted Esay and Ezechiel mad; When Jeremy his Lamentations writ, They thought the Wizard quite out of his wit, Such sots they were, as worthily to ly, Lock't in the chaines of their captivity, Knowledge hath still her Eddy in her Flow, So it hath beene, and it will still be so. That famous Greece where learning flowrisht most, Hath of her muses long since left to boast, Th'unletter'd Turke, and rude Barbarian trades, Where Homer sang his lofty Iliads; And this vaste volume of the world hath taught, Much may to passe in little time be brought. As if to Symptoms we may credit give, This very time, wherein we two now live, Shall in the compasse, wound the Muses more, Then all the old English ignorance before; Base Balatry is so belov'd and sought, And those brave numbers are put by for naught, Which rarely read, were able to awake, Bodyes from graves, and to the ground to shake The wandring clouds, and to our men at armes, 'Gainst pikes and muskets were most powerfull charmes. That, but I know, insuing ages shall, Raise her againe, who now is in her fall; And out of dust reduce our scattered rimes, Th'rejected jewels of these slothfull times, Who with the Muses would mispend an hower, But let blind Gothish Barbarisme devoure These feverous Dogdays, blest by no record, But to be everlastingly abhord. If you vouchsafe rescription, stuffe your quill With naturall bountyes, and impart your skill, In the description of the place, that I, May become learned in the soyle thereby; Of noble Wyats health, and let me heare, The Governour; and how our people there, Increase and labour, what supplyes are sent, Which I confesse shall give me much content; But you may save your labour if you please, To write to me ought of your Savages. As savage slaves be in great Britaine here, As any one that you can shew me there. And though for this, Ile say I doe not thirst, Yet I should like it well to be the first, Whose numbers hence into Virginia flew, So (noble Sandis) for this time adue. TO MY NOBLE FRIEND MASTER WILLIAM BROWNE, of the evill time. Deare friend, be silent and with patience see, What this mad times Catastrophe will be; The worlds first Wisemen certainely mistooke Themselves, and spoke things quite beside the booke, And that which they have said of God, untrue, Or else expect strange judgement to insue. This Isle is a meere Bedlam, and therein, We all lye raving, mad in every sinne, And him the wisest most men use to call, Who doth (alone) the maddest thing of all; He whom the master of all wisedome found, For a marckt foole, and so did him propound, The time we live in, to that passe is brought, That only he a Censor now is thought; And that base villaine, (not an age yet gone,) Which a good man would not have look'd upon; Now like a God, with divine worship follow'd, And all his actions are accounted hollow'd. This world of ours, thus runneth upon wheeles, Set on the head, bolt upright with her heeles; Which makes me thinke of what the Ethnicks told, Th'opinion, the Pythagorists uphold, That the immortall soule doth transmigrate; Wander from body to body. Then I suppose by the strong power of fate, That those which at confused Babel were, And since that time now many a lingering yeare, Through fools, and beasts, and lunatiques have past, Are heere imbodyed in this age at last, And though so long we from that time be gone, Yet taste we still of that confusion. For certainely there's scarse one found that now, Knowes what t'approove, or what to disallow, All arsey varsey, nothing is it's owne, But to our proverbe, all turnd upside downe; To doe in time, is to doe out of season, And that speeds best, thats done the farth'st from reason, Hee's high'st that's low'st, hee's surest in that's out, He hits the next way that goes farth'st about, He getteth up unlike to rise at all, He slips to ground as much unlike to fall; Which doth inforce me partly to prefer, The opinion of that mad Philosopher, Zeno.Who taught, that those all-framing powers above, (As tis suppos'd) made man not out of love To him at all, but only as a thing, To make them sport with, which they use to bring As men doe munkeys, puppets, and such tooles Of laughter: so men are but the Gods fooles. Such are by titles lifted to the sky, As wherefore no man knowes, God scarcely why; The vertuous man depressed like a stone For that dull Sot to raise himselfe upon; He who ne're thing yet worthy man durst doe, Never durst looke upon his countreys foe, Nor durst attempt that action which might get Him fame with men: or higher might him set Then the base begger (rightly if compar'd;) This Drone yet never brave attempt that dar'd, Yet dares be knighted, and from thence dares grow To any title Empire can bestow; For this beleeve, that Impudence is now A Cardinall vertue, and men it allow Reverence, nay more, men study and invent New wayes, nay, glory to be impudent. Into the clouds the Devill lately got, And by the moisture doubting much the rot, A medicine tooke to make him purge and cast; Which in short time began to worke so fast, That he fell too't, and from his backeside flew, A rout of rascall a rude ribauld crew Of base Plebeians, which no sooner light, Upon the earth, but with a suddaine flight, They spread this Ile, and as Deucalion once Over his shoulder backe, by throwing stones They became men, even so these beasts became, Owners of titles from an obscure name. He that by riot, of a mighty rent, Hath his late goodly Patrimony spent, And into base and wilfull beggery run This man as he some glorious act had done, With some great pension, or rich guift releev'd, When he that hath by industry atchiev'd Some noble thing, contemned and disgrac'd, In the forlorne hope of the times is plac'd, As though that God had carelessly left all That being hath on this terrestiall ball, To fortunes guiding, nor would have to doe With man, nor ought that doth belong him to, Or at the least God having given more Power to the Devill, then he did of yore, Over this world: the feind as he doth hate The vertuous man; maligning his estate, All noble things, and would have by his will, To be damn'd with him, using all his skill, By his blacke hellish ministers to vexe All worthy men, and strangely to perplexe Their constancie, there by them so to fright, That they should yeeld them wholely to his might. But of these things I vainely doe but tell, Where hell is heaven, and heav'n is now turn'd hell; Where that which lately blasphemy hath bin, Now godlinesse, much lesse accounted sin; And a long while I greatly mervail'd why Buffoons and Bawdes should hourely multiply, Till that of late I construed it, that they To present thrift had got the perfect way, When I concluded by their odious crimes, It was for us no thriving in these times. As men oft laugh at little Babes, when they Hap to behold some strange thing in their play, To see them on the suddaine strucken sad, As in their fancie some strange formes they had, Which they by pointing with their fingers showe, Angry at our capacities so slowe, That by their countenance we no sooner learne To see the wonder which they so discerne: So the celestiall powers doe sit and smile At innocent and vertuous men the while, They stand amazed at the world ore-gone, So farre beyond imagination, With slavish basenesse, that they silent sit Pointing like children in describing it. Then noble friend the next way to controule These worldly crosses, is to arme thy soule With constant patience: and with thoughts as high As these belowe, and poore, winged to flye To that exalted stand, whether yet they Are got with paine, that sit out of the way Of this ignoble age, which raiseth none But such as thinke their black damnation To be a trifle; such, so ill, that when They are advanc'd, those fewe poore honest men That yet are living, into search doe runne To finde what mischiefe they have lately done, Which so preferres them; say thou he doth rise, That maketh vertue his chiefe excercise. And in this base world come what ever shall, Hees worth lamenting, that for her doth fall. UPON THE THREE SONNES OF THE LORD SHEFFIELD, drowned in Humber. Light Sonnets hence, and to loose Lovers flie, And mournfull Maydens sing an Elegie On those three Sheffields, over-whelm'd with waves, Whose losse the teares of all the Muses craves; A thing so full of pitty as this was, Me thinkes for nothing should not slightly passe. Treble this losse was, why should it not borrowe, Through this Iles treble parts, a treble sorrowe: But Fate did this, to let the world to knowe, That sorrowes which from common causes growe, Are not worth mourning for, the losse to beare, But of one onely sonne, 's not worth one teare. Some tender hearted man, as I, may spend Some drops (perhaps) for a deceased friend. Some men (perhaps) their Wifes late death may rue; Or Wifes their Husbands, but such be but fewe. Cares that have us'd the hearts of men to tuch So oft, and deepely, will not now be such; Who'll care for losse of maintenance, or place, Fame, liberty, or of the Princes grace; Or sutes in law, by base corruption crost, When he shall finde, that this which he hath lost; Alas, is nothing to his, which did lose, Three sonnes at once so excellent as those: Nay, it is feard that this in time may breed Hard hearts in men to their owne naturall seed; That in respect of this great losse of theirs, Men will scarce mourne the death of their owne heires. Through all this Ile their losse so publique is, That every man doth take them to be his, And as a plague which had beginning there, So catching is, and raigning every where, That those the farthest off as much doe rue them, As those the most familiarly that knew them; Children with this disaster are wext sage, And like to men that strucken are in age; Talke what it is, three children at one time Thus to have drown'd, and in their very prime; Yea, and doe learne to act the same so well, That then olde folke, they better can it tell. Invention, oft that Passion us'd to faine, In sorrowes of themselves but slight, and meane, To make them seeme great, here it shall not need, For that this Subject doth so farre exceed All forc'd Expression, that what Poesie shall Happily thinke to grace it selfe withall, Falls so belowe it, that it rather borrowes Grace from their griefe, then addeth to their sorrowes, For sad mischance thus in the losse of three, To shewe it selfe the utmost it could bee: Exacting also by the selfe same lawe, The utmost teares that sorrowe had to drawe, All future times hath utterly prevented Of a more losse, or more to be lamented. Whilst in faire youth they lively flourish'd here, To their kinde Parents they were onely deere: But being dead, now every one doth take Them for their owne, and doe like sorrowe make: As for their owne begot, as they pretended Hope in the issue, which should have discended From them againe; nor here doth end our sorrow, But those of us, that shall be borne to morrowe Still shall lament them, and when time shall count, To what vast number passed yeares shall mount, They from their death shall duly reckon so, As from the Deluge, former us'd to doe. O cruell Humber guilty of their gore, I now beleeve more then I did before, The Brittish Story, whence thy name begun Of Kingly Humber, an invading Hun, By thee devoured, for't is likely thou With bloud wert Christned, bloud-thirsty till now. The Ouse, the Done, and thou farre clearer Trent, To drowne these Sheffields as you gave consent, Shall curse the time, that ere you were infus'd, Which have your waters basely thus abus'd. The groveling Boore yee hinder not to goe, And at his pleasure Ferry to and fro, The very best part of whose soule, and bloud, Compared with theirs, is viler then your mud. But wherefore paper, doe I idely spend, On those deafe waters to so little end, And up to starry heaven doe I not looke, In which, as in an everlasting booke, Our ends are written, O let times rehearse Their fatall losse, in their sad Aniverse. TO THE NOBLE LADY, THE LADY I. S. of worldly crosses. Madame, to shew the smoothnesse of my vaine, Neither that I would have you entertaine The time in reading me, which you would spend In faire discourse with some knowne honest friend, I write not to you. Nay, and which is more, My powerfull verses strive not to restore, What time and sicknesse have in you impair'd, To other ends my Elegie is squar'd. Your beauty, sweetnesse, and your gracefull parts That have drawne many eyes, wonne many hearts, Of me get little, I am so much man, That let them doe their utmost that they can, I will resist their forces: and they be Though great to others, yet not so to me. The first time I beheld you, I then sawe That (in it selfe) which had the power to drawe My stay'd affection, and thought to allowe You some deale of my heart; but you have now Got farre into it, and you have the skill (For ought I see) to winne upon me still. When I doe thinke how bravely you have borne Your many crosses, as in Fortunes scorne, And how neglectfull you have seem'd to be, Of that which hath seem'd terrible to me, I thought you stupid, nor that you had felt Those griefes which (often) I have seene to melt, Another woman into sighes and teares, A thing but seldome in your sexe and yeares, But when in you I have perceiv'd agen, (Noted by me, more then by other men) How feeling and how sensible you are Of your friends sorrowes, and with how much care You seeke to cure them, then my selfe I blame, That I your patience should so much misname, Which to my understanding maketh knowne “Who feeles anothers griefe, can feele their owne. When straight me thinkes, I heare your patience say, Are you the man that studied Seneca: Plinies most learned letters; and must I Read you a Lecture in Philosophie, T'avoid the afflictions that have us'd to reach you; I'le learne you more, Sir, then your bookes can teach you. Of all your sex, yet never did I knowe, Any that yet so actually could showe Such rules for patience, such an easie way, That who so sees it shall be forc'd to say, Loe what before seem'd hard to be discern'd, Is of this Lady, in an instant learn'd. It is heavens will that you should wronged be By the malicious, that the world might see Your Dove-like meekenesse; for had the base scumme, The spawne of Fiends, beene in your slander dumbe, Your vertue then had perish'd, never priz'd, For that the same you had not exercis'd; And you had lost the Crowne you have, and glory, Nor had you beene the subject of my Story. Whilst they feele Hell, being damned in their hate, Their thoughts, like Devils them excruciate, Which by your noble suffrings doe torment Them with new paines, and gives you this content To see your soule an Innocent, hath suffred, And up to heaven before your eyes be offred: Your like we in a burning Glasse may see, When the Sunnes rayes therein contracted be Bent on some object, which is purely white, We finde that colour doth dispierce the light, And stands untainted: but if it hath got Some little sully; or the least small spot, Then it soone fiers it; so you still remaine Free, because in you they can finde no staine. God doth not love them least, on whom he layes The great'st afflictions; but that he will praise Himselfe most in them, and will make them fit, Near'st to himselfe who is the Lambe to sit: For by that touch, like perfect gold he tries them, Who are not his, untill the world denies them. And your example may worke such effect, That it may be the beginning of a Sect Of patient women; and that many a day All Husbands may for you their Founder pray. Nor is to me your Innocence the lesse, In that I see you strive not to suppresse Their barbarous malice; but your noble heart Prepar'd to act so difficult a part, With unremoved constancie is still The same it was, that of your proper ill, The effect proceeds from your owne selfe the cause, Like some just Prince, who to establish lawes, Suffers the breach at his best lov'd to strike, To learne the vulgar to endure the like. You are a Martir thus, nor can you be Lesse to the world so valued by me: If as you have begun, you still persever, Be ever good, that I may love you ever. AN ELEGIE UPON THE DEATH OF THE LADY PENELOPE CLIFTON. Must I needes write, who's he that can refuse, He wants a minde, for her that hath no Muse, The thought of her doth heav'nly rage inspire, Next powerfull, to those cloven tongues of fire. Since I knew ought time never did allowe Me stuffe fit for an Elegie, till now; When France and England's Henrie's dy'd, my quill, Why, I know not, but it that time lay still. 'Tis more then greatnesse that my spirit must raise, To observe custome I use not to praise; Nor the least thought of mine yet ere depended, On any one from whom she was descended; That for their favour I this way should wooe, As some poore wretched things (perhaps) may doe; I gaine the end, whereat I onely ayme, If by my freedome I may give her fame. Walking then forth being newly up from bed, O Sir (quoth one) the Lady Clifton's dead. When, but that reason my sterne rage withstood, My hand had sure beene guilty of his blood. If shee be so, must thy rude tongue confesse it (Quoth I) and com'st so coldly to expresse it. Thou shouldst have given a shreeke, to make me feare thee; That might have slaine what ever had beene neere thee. Thou shouldst have com'n like Time with thy scalpe bare, And in thy hands thou shouldst have brought thy haire, Casting upon me such a dreadfull looke, As seene a spirit, or th'adst beene thunder strooke, And gazing on me so a little space, Thou shouldst have shot thine eye balls in my face, Then falling at my feet, thou shouldst have said, O she is gone, and Nature with her dead. With this ill newes amaz'd by chance I past, By that neere Grove, whereas both first and last, I saw her, not three moneths before shee di'd. When (though full Summer gan to vaile her pride, And that I sawe men leade home ripened Corne, Besides advis'd me well,) I durst have sworne The lingring yeare, the Autumne had adjourn'd, And the fresh Spring had beene againe return'd, Her delicacie, lovelinesse, and grace, With such a Summer bravery deckt the place: But now alas, it lookt forlorne and dead; And where she stood, the fading leaves were shed, Presenting onely sorrowe to my sight, O God (thought I) this is her Embleme right. And sure I thinke it cannot but be thought, That I to her by providence was brought. For that the Fates fore-dooming, shee should die, Shewed me this wondrous Master peece, that I Should sing her Funerall, that the world should know it, That heaven did thinke her worthy of a Poet; My hand is fatall, nor doth fortune doubt, For what it writes, not fire shall ere race out. A thousand silken Puppets should have died, And in their fulsome Coffins putrified, Ere in my lines, you of their names should heare To tell the world that such there ever were, Whose memory shall from the earth decay, Before those Rags be worne they gave away. Had I her god-like features never seene, Poore sleight Report had tolde me she had beene A hansome Lady, comely, very well, And so might I have died an Infidell, As many doe which never did her see, Or cannot credit, what she was, by mee. Nature, her selfe, that before Art prefers To goe beyond all our Cosmographers, By Charts and Maps exactly that have showne, All of this earth that ever can be knowne, For that she would beyond them all descrie What Art could not, by any mortall eye; A Map of heaven in her rare features drue, And that she did so lively and so true, That any soule but seeing it, might sweare That all was perfect heavenly that was there. If ever any Painter were so blest, To drawe that face, which so much heav'n exprest, If in his best of skill he did her right, I wish it never may come in my sight, I greatly doubt my faith (weake man) lest I Should to that face commit Idolatry. Death might have tyth'd her sex, but for this one, Nay, have ta'n halfe to have let her alone; Such as their wrinkled temples to supply, Cyment them up with sluttish Mercury, Such as undrest were able to affright, A valiant man approching him by night; Death might have taken such, her end deferd, Untill the time she had beene climaterd; When she would have bin at threescore yeares and three, Such as our best at three and twenty be, With envie then, he might have overthrowne her, When age nor time had power to sease upon her. But when the unpittying Fates her end decreed, They to the same did instantly proceed, For well they knew (if she had languish'd so) As those which hence by naturall causes goe, So many prayers, and teares for her had spoken, As certainly their Iron lawes had broken, And had wak'd heav'n, who clearely would have show'd That change of Kingdomes to her death it ow'd; And that the world still of her end might thinke, It would have let some Neighbouring mountaine sinke, Or the vast Sea it in on us to cast, As Severne did about some five yeares past: Or some sterne Comet his curld top to reare, Whose length should measure halfe our Hemisphere. Holding this height, to say some will not sticke, That now I rave, and am growne lunatique: You of what sexe so ere you be, you lye, 'Tis thou thy selfe is lunatique, not I. I charge you in her name that now is gone, That may conjure you, if you be not stone, That you no harsh, nor shallow rimes decline, Upon that day wherein you shall read mine. Such as indeed are falsely termed verse, And will but sit like mothes upon her herse; Nor that no child, nor chambermaide, nor page, Disturbe the Rome, the whilst my sacred rage, In reading is; but whilst you heare it read, Suppose, before you, that you see her dead, The walls about you hung with mournfull blacke, And nothing of her funerall to lacke, And when this period gives you leave to pause, Cast up your eyes, and sigh for my applause. UPON THE NOBLE LADY ASTONS DEPARTURE FOR SPAINE. I many a time have greatly marveil'd, why Men say, their friends depart when as they die, How well that word, a dying, doth expresse, I did not know (I truely must confesse,) Till her departure, for whose missed sight, I am enforc'd this Elegy to write: But since resistlesse fate will have it so, That she from hence must to Iberia goe, And my weake wishes can her not detaine, I will of heaven in policy complaine, That it so long her travell should adjourne, Hoping thereby to hasten her returne. Can those of Norway for their wage procure, The witches of the Northerly legions sell windes to passengers. By their blacke spells a winde that shall endure Till from aboard the wished land men see, And fetch the harbour, where they long to be, Can they by charmes doe this, and cannot I Who am the Priest of Phæbus, and so hie, Sit in his favour, winne the Poets god, To send swift Hermes with his snaky rod, To Æolus Cave, commanding him with care, His prosperous winds, that he for her prepare, And from that howre, wherein she takes the seas, Nature bring on the quiet Halcion dayes, And in that hower that bird begin her nest, Nay at that very instant, that long rest May seize on Neptune, who may still repose, And let that bird nere till that hower disclose, Wherein she landeth, and for all that space Be not a wrinkle seene on Thetis face, Onely so much breath with a gentle gale, As by the easy swelling of her saile, May at The nearest Harbour of Spaine. Sebastians safely set her downe Where, with her goodnes she may blesse the towne. If heaven in justice would have plagu'd by thee Some Pirate, and grimme Neptune thou should'st be His Executioner, or what is his worse, The gripple Merchant, borne to be the curse Of this brave Iland; let them for her sake, Who to thy safeguard doth her selfe betake, Escape undrown'd, unwrackt, nay rather let Them be at ease in some safe harbour set, Where with much profit they may vent their wealth That they have got by villany and stealth, Rather great Neptune, then when thou dost rave, Thou once shouldst wet her saile but with a wave. Or if some proling Rover shall but dare, To seize the ship wherein she is to fare, Let the fell fishes of the Maine appeare, And tell those Sea-thiefes, that once such they were As they are now, till they assaid to rape; Grape-crowned Bacchus in a striplings shape, That came aboard them, and would faine have saild, To vine-spread An Ile for the abundance of wine supposed to be the habitation of Bachus Naxus, but that him they faild, Which he perceiving, them so monstrous made, And warne them how, they passengers invade. Ye South and Westerne winds now cease to blow, Autumne is come, there be no flowers to grow, Yea from that place respire, to which she goes, And to her sailes should show your selfe but foes, But Boreas and yee Esterne windes arise, To send her soon to Spaine, but be precise, That in your aide you seeme not still so sterne, As we a Summer should no more discerne, For till that here againe, I may her see, It will be winter all the yeare with me. Castor and Polox begot by Jove on Leda in the forme of a Swanne. A constellation ominous to Mariners.Yee swanne-begotten lovely brother stars, So oft auspicious to poore Mariners, Yee twin-bred lights of lovely Leda's brood, Joves egge-borne issue smile upon the flood, And in your mild'st aspect doe ye appeare To be her warrant from all future feare. And if thou ship that bear'st her, doe prove good, May never time by wormes, consume thy wood Nor rust thy iron, may thy tacklings last, Till they for reliques be in temples plac't: Maist thou be ranged with that mighty Arke, Wherein just Noah did all the world imbarque, With that which after Troyes so famous wracke, From ten yeares travell brought Ulisses backe, That Argo which to Colchos went from Greece, And in her botome brought the goulden fleece Under brave Jason; or that same of Drake, Wherein he did his famous voyage make About the world; or Candishes that went As far as his, about the Continent. And yee milde winds that now I doe implore, Not once to raise the least sand on the shore, Nor once on forfeit of your selves respire: When once the time is come of her retire, If then it please you, but to doe your due, What for those windes I did, Ile doe for you; Ile wooe you then, and if that not suffice, My pen shall proove you to have dietyes, Ile sing your loves in verses that shall flow, And tell the storyes of your weale and woe, Ile proove what profit to the earth you bring, And how t'is you that welcome in the spring; Ile raise up altars to you, as to show, The time shall be kept holy, when you blow. O blessed winds! your will that it may be, To send health to her, and her home to me. TO MY MOST DEARELY-LOVED FRIEND HENERY REYNOLDS ESQUIRE, of Poets and Poesie. My dearely loved friend how oft have we, In winter evenings (meaning to be free,) To some well chosen place us'd to retire; And there with moderate meate, and wine, and fire, Have past the howres contentedly with chat, Now talk'd of this, and then discours'd of that, Spoke our owne verses 'twixt our selves, if not Other mens lines, which we by chance had got, Or some Stage pieces famous long before, Of which your happy memory had store; And I remember you much pleased were, Of those who lived long agoe to heare, As well as of those, of these latter times, Who have inricht our language with their rimes, And in succession, how still up they grew, Which is the subject, that I now pursue; For from my cradle (you must know that) I, Was still inclin'd to noble Poesie, And when that once Pueriles I had read, And newly had my Cato construed, In my small selfe I greatly marveil'd then, Amongst all other, what strange kinde of men These Poets were; And pleased with the name, To my milde Tutor merrily I came, (For I was then a proper goodly page, Much like a Pigmy, scarse ten yeares of age) Clasping my slender armes about his thigh. O my deare master! cannot you (quoth I) Make me a Poet, doe it; if you can, And you shall see, Ile quickly be a man, Who me thus answered smiling, boy quoth he, If you'le not play the wag, but I may see You ply your learning, I will shortly read Some Poets to you; Phæbus be my speed, Too't hard went I, when shortly he began, And first read to me honest Mantuan, Then Virgils Eglogues, being entred thus, Me thought I straight had mounted Pegasus, And in his full Careere could make him stop, And bound upon Parnassus by-clift top. I scornd your ballet then though it were done And had for Finis, William Elderton. But soft, in sporting with this childish jest, I from my subject have too long digrest, Then to the matter that we tooke in hand, Jove and Apollo for the Muses stand. That noble Chaucer, in those former times, The first inrich'd our English with his rimes, And was the first of ours, that ever brake, Into the Muses treasure, and first spake In weighty numbers, delving in the Mine Of perfect knowledge, which he could refine, And coyne for currant, and asmuch as then The English language could expresse to men, He made it doe; and by his wondrous skill, Gave us much light from his abundant quill. And honest Gower, who in respect of him, Had only sipt at Aganippas brimme, And though in yeares this last was him before, Yet fell he far short of the others store. When after those, foure ages very neare, They with the Muses which conversed, were That Princely Surrey, early in the time Of the Eight Henry, who was then the prime Of Englands noble youth; with him there came Wyat; with reverence whom we still doe name Amongst our Poets, Brian had a share With the two former, which accompted are That times best makers, and the authors were Of those small poems, which the title beare, Of songs and sonnets, wherein oft they hit On many dainty passages of wit. Gascoine and Churchyard after them againe In the beginning of Eliza's raine, Accoumpted were great Meterers many a day, But not inspired with brave fier, had they Liv'd but a little longer, they had seene, Their workes before them to have buried beene. Grave morrall Spencer after these came on Then whom I am perswaded there was none Since the blind Bard his Iliads up did make, Fitter a taske like that to undertake, To set downe boldly, bravely to invent, In all high knowledge, surely excellent. The noble Sidney, with this last arose, That Heroe for numbers, and for Prose. That throughly pac'd our language as to show, The plenteous English hand in hand might goe With Greeke and Latine, and did first reduce Our tongue from Lillies writing then in use; Talking of Stones, Stars, Plants, of fishes, Flyes, Playing with words, and idle Similies, As th'English, Apes and very Zanies be Of every thing, that they doe heare and see, So imitating his ridiculous tricks, They spake and writ, all like meere lunatiques. Then Warner though his lines were not so trim'd, Nor yet his Poem so exactly lim'd And neatly joynted, but the Criticke may Easily reproove him, yet thus let me say; For my old friend, some passages there be In him, which I protest have taken me, With almost wonder, so fine, cleere, and new As yet they have bin equalled by few. Neat Marlow bathed in the Thespian springs Had in him those brave translunary things, That the first Poets had, his raptures were, All ayre, and fire, which made his verses cleere, For that fine madnes still he did retaine, Which rightly should possesse a Poets braine. And surely Nashe, though he a Proser were A branch of Lawrell yet deserves to beare, Sharply Satirick was he, and that way He went, since that his being, to this day Few have attempted, and I surely thinke Those words shall hardly be set downe with inke; Shall scorch and blast, so as his could, where he, Would inflict vengeance, and be it said of thee, Shakespeare thou hadst as smooth a Comicke vaine, Fitting the socke, and in thy naturall braine, As strong conception, and as Cleere a rage, As any one that trafiqu'd with the stage. Amongst these Samuel Daniel, whom if I May spake of, but to sensure doe denie, Onely have heard some wisemen him rehearse, To be too much Historian in verse; His rimes were smooth, his meeters well did close, But yet his maner better fitted prose: Next these, learn'd Johnson, in this List I bring, Who had drunke deepe of the Pierian spring, Whose knowledge did him worthily prefer, And long was Lord here of the Theater, Who in opinion made our learn'st to sticke, Whether in Poems rightly dramatique, Strong Seneca or Plautus, he or they, Should beare the Buskin, or the Socke away. Others againe here lived in my dayes, That have of us deserved no lesse praise For their translations, then the daintiest wit That on Parnassus thinks, he highst doth sit, And for a chaire may mongst the Muses call, As the most curious maker of them all; As reverent Chapman, who hath brought to us, Musæus, Homer, and Hesiodus Out of the Greeke; and by his skill hath reard Them to that height, and to our tongue endear'd, That were those Poets at this day alive, To see their bookes thus with us to survive, They would think, having neglected them so long, They had bin written in the English tongue. And Silvester who from the French more weake, Made Bartas of his sixe dayes labour speake In naturall English, who, had he there stayd, He had done well, and never had bewraid, His owne invention, to have bin so poore Who still wrote lesse, in striving to write more. Then dainty Sands that hath to English done, Smooth sliding Ovid, and hath made him run With so much sweetnesse and unusuall grace, As though the neatnesse of the English pace, Should tell the Jetting Lattine that it came But slowly after, as though stiffe and lame. So Scotland sent us hither, for our owne That man, whose name I ever would have knowne, To stand by mine, that most ingenious knight, My Alexander, to whom in his right, I want extreamely, yet in speaking thus I doe but shew the love, that was twixt us, And not his numbers which were brave and hie, So like his mind, was his cleare Poesie, And my deare Drummond to whom much I owe For his much love, and proud I was to know, His poesie, for which two worthy men, I Menstry still shall love, and Hauthorne-den, Then the two Beamounts and my Browne arose, My deare companions whom I freely chose My bosome friends; and in their severall wayes, Rightly borne Poets, and in these last dayes, Men of much note, and no lesse nobler parts, Such as have freely tould to me their hearts, As I have mine to them; but if you shall Say in your knowledge, that these be not all Have writ in numbers, be inform'd that I Only my selfe, to these few men doe tye, Whose workes oft printed, set on every post, To publique censure subject have bin most; For such whose poems, be they nere so rare, In private chambers, that incloistered are, And by transcription daintyly must goe; As though the world unworthy were to know, Their rich composures, let those men that keepe These wonderous reliques in their judgement deepe, And cry them up so, let such Peeces bee Spoke of by those that shall come after me, I passe not for them: nor doe meane to run, In quest of these, that them applause have wonne, Upon our Stages in these latter dayes, That are so many, let them have ther bayes That doe deserve it; let those wits that haunt Those publique circuits, let them freely chaunt Their fine Composures, and their praise pursue, And so my deare friend, for this time adue. UPON THE DEATH OF HIS INCOMPARABLE FRIEND, SIR HENRY RAYNSFORD of Clifford. Could there be words found to expresse my losse, There were some hope, that this my heavy crosse Might be sustained, and that wretched I Might once finde comfort: but to have him die Past all degrees that was so deare to me; As but comparing him with others, hee Was such a thing, as if some Power should say I'le take Man on me, to shew men the way What a friend should be. But words come so short Of him, that when I thus would him report, I am undone, and having nought to say, Mad at my selfe, I throwe my penne away, And beate my breast, that there should be a woe So high, that words cannot attaine thereto. T'is strange that I from my abundant breast, Who others sorrowes have so well exprest: Yet I by this in little time am growne So poore, that I want to expresse my owne. I thinke the Fates perceiving me to beare My worldly crosses without wit or feare: Nay, with what scorne I ever have derided, Those plagues that for me they have oft provided, Drew them to counsaile; nay, conspired rather, And in this businesse laid their heads together To finde some one plague, that might me subvert, And at an instant breake my stubborne heart; They did indeede, and onely to this end They tooke from me this more then man, or friend. Hard-hearted Fates, your worst thus have you done, Then let us see what lastly you have wonne By this your rigour, in a course so strict, Why see, I beare all that you can inflict: And hee from heaven your poore revenge to view; Laments my losse of him, but laughes at you, Whilst I against you execrations breath; Thus are you scorn'd above, and curst beneath. Me thinks that man (unhappy though he be) Is now thrice happy in respect of me, Who hath no friend; for that in having none He is not stirr'd as I am, to bemone My miserable losse, who but in vaine, May ever looke to finde the like againe. This more then mine owne selfe; that who had seene His care of me where ever I have beene, And had not knowne his active spirit before, Upon some brave thing working evermore: He would have sworne that to no other end He had beene borne: but onely for my friend. I had beene happy, if nice Nature had (Since now my lucke falls out to be so bad) Made me unperfect, either of so soft And yeelding temper, that lamenting oft, I into teares my mournefull selfe might melt; Or else so dull, my losse not to have felt. I have by my too deere experience bought, That fooles and mad men, whom I ever thought The most unhappy, are in deede not so: And therefore I lesse pittie can bestowe (Since that my sence, my sorrowe so can sound) On those I see in Bedlam that are bound, And scarce feele scourging; and when as I meete A foole by Children followed in the Streete, Thinke I (poore wretch) thou from my griefe art free, Nor couldst thou feele it, should it light on thee; But that I am a Christian, and am taught By him who with his precious bloud me bought, Meekly like him my crosses to endure, Else would they please me well, that for their cure, When as they feele their conscience doth them brand, Upon themselves dare lay a violent hand; Not suffering Fortune with her murdering knife, Stand like a Surgeon working on the life, Desecting this part, that joynt off to cut, Shewing that Artire, ripping then that gut, Whilst the dull beastly World with her squint eye, Is to behold the strange Anatomie. I am perswaded that those which we read To be man-haters, were not so indeed, The Athenian Timon, and beside him more Of which the Latines, as the Greekes have store; Nor not they did all humane manners hate, Nor yet maligne mans dignity and state. But finding our fraile life how every day, It like a bubble vanisheth away: For this condition did mankinde detest, Farre more incertaine then that of the beast. Sure heaven doth hate this world and deadly too, Else as it hath done it would never doe, For if it did not, it would ne're permit A man of so much vertue, knowledge, wit, Of naturall goodnesse, supernaturall grace, Whose courses when considerately I trace Into their ends, and diligently looke, They serve me for Oeconomike booke, By which this rough world I not onely stemme, In goodnesse but growe learn'd by reading them. O pardon me, it my much sorrow is, Which makes me use this long Parenthesis; Had heaven this world not hated as I say, In height of life it had not, tane away A spirit so brave, so active, and so free, That such a one who would not wish to bee, Rather then weare a Crowne, by Armes though got, So fast a friend, so true a Patriot. In things concerning both the worlds so wise, Besides so liberall of his faculties, That where he would his industrie bestowe, He would have done, e're one could think to doe. No more talke of the working of the Starres, For plenty, scarcenesse, or for peace, or Warres. They are impostures, therefore get you hence With all your Planets, and their influence. No more doe I care into them to looke, Then in some idle Chiromantick booke, Shewing the line of life, and Venus mount, Nor yet no more would I of them account, Then what that tells me, since that what so ere Might promise man long life: of care and feare, By nature freed, a conscience cleere, and quiet, His health, his constitution, and his diet; Counting a hundred, fourescore at the least, Propt up by prayers, yet more to be encreast, All these should faile, and in his fiftieth yeare He should expire, henceforth let none be deare, To me at all, lest for my haplesse sake, Before their time heaven from the world them take, And leave me wretched to lament their ends As I doe his, who was a thousand friends. UPON THE DEATH OF THE LADY OLIVE STANHOPE. Canst thou depart and be forgotten so, Stanhope thou canst not, no deare Stanhope, no: But in despight of death the world shall see, That Muse which so much graced was by thee; Can black Oblivion utterly out-brave, And set thee up above thy silent Grave. I mervail'd much the Derbian Nimphes were dumbe, Or of those Muses, what should be become, That of all those, the mountaines there among, Not one this while thy Epicedium sung; But so it is, when they of thee were reft, They all those hills, and all those Rivers left, And sullen growne, their former seates remove, Both from cleare Darwin, and from silver Dove, And for thy losse, they greeved are so sore, That they have vow'd they will come there no more; But leave thy losse to me, that I should rue thee, Unhappy man, and yet I never knew thee: Me thou didst love unseene, so did I thee, It was our spirits that lov'd then and not wee; Therefore without profanenesse I may call The love betwixt us, love spirituall: But that which thou affectedst was so true, As that thereby thee perfectly I knew; And now that spirit, which thou so lov'dst, still mine, Shall offer this a Sacrifice to thine, And reare this Trophe, which for thee shall last, When this most beastly Iron age is past; I am perswaded, whilst we two have slept, Our soules have met, and to each other wept; That destenie so strongly should forbid, Our bodies to converse as oft they did: For certainly refined spirits doe know, As doe the Angels, and doe here belowe Take the fruition of that endlesse blisse, As those above doe, and what each one is, They see divinely, and as those there doe, They know each others wills, so soules can too. About that dismall time, thy spirit hence flew, Mine much was troubled, but why, I not knew, In dull and sleepy sounds, it often left me, As of it selfe it ment to have bereft me, I ask'd it what the cause was, of such woe, Or what it might be, that might vexe it so, But it was deafe, nor my demand would here, But when that ill newes came, to touch mine eare, I straightwayes found this watchfull sperit of mine, Troubled had bin to take its leave of thine, For when fate found, what nature late had done, How much from heaven, she for the earth had won By thy deare birth; said, that it could not be In so yong yeares, what it perceiv'd in thee, But nature sure, had fram'd thee long before; And as Rich Misers of their mighty store, Keepe the most precious longst, so from times past, She onely had reservd thee till the last; So did thy wisedome, not thy youth behold, And tooke thee hence, in thinking thou wast old. Thy shape and beauty often have to me Bin highly praysed, which I thought might be, Truely reported, for a spirit so brave, Which heaven to thee so bountifully gave; Nature could not in recompence againe, In some rich lodging but to entertaine. Let not the world report then, that the Peake, Is but a rude place only vast and bleake, And nothing hath to boast of but her Lead, When she can say that happily she bred Thee, and when she shall of her wonders tell Wherein she doth all other Tracts excell, Let her account thee greatst, and still to time Of all the rest, record thee for the prime. TO MASTER WILLIAM JEFFREYS, Chaplaine to the Lord Ambassadour in Spaine. My noble friend, you challenge me to write To you in verse, and often you recite, My promise to you, and to send you newes; As 'tis a thing I very seldome use, And I must write of State, if to Madrid, A thing our Proclamations here forbid, And that word State such Latitude doth beare, As it may make me very well to feare To write, nay speake at all, these let you know Your power on me, yet not that I will showe The love I beare you, in that lofty height, So cleere expression, or such words of weight, As into Spanish if they were translated, Might make the Poets of that Realme amated; Yet these my least were, but that you extort These numbers from me, when I should report In home-spunne prose, in good plaine honest words The newes our wofull England us affords. The Muses here sit sad, and mute the while A sort of swine unseasonably defile Those sacred springs, which from the by-clift hill Dropt their pure Nectar into every quill; In this with State, I hope I doe not deale, This onely tends the Muses common-weale. What canst thou hope, or looke for from his pen, Who lives with beasts, though in the shapes of men, And what a poore few are we honest still, And dare to be so, when all the world is ill. I finde this age of ours markt with this fate, That honest men are still precipitate Under base villaines, which till th'earth can vent This her last brood, and wholly hath them spent, Shall be so, then in revolution shall, Vertue againe arise by vices fall; But that shall I not see, neither will I Maintaine this, as one doth a Prophesie, That our King James to Rome shall surely goe, And from his chaire the Pope shall overthrow. But ô this world is so given up to hell, That as the old Giants, which did once rebell, Against the Gods, so this now-living race Dare sin, yet stand, and Jeere heaven in the face. But soft my Muse, and make a little stay, Surely thou art not rightly in thy way, To my good Jeffrayes was not I about To write, and see, I suddainely am out, This is pure Satire, that thou speak'st, and I Was first in hand to write an Elegie. To tell my countreys shame I not delight, But doe bemoane't I am no Democrite: O God, though Vertue mightily doe grieve For all this world, yet will I not beleeve But that shees faire and lovely, and that she So to the period of the world shall be; Else had she beene forsaken (sure) of all, For that so many sundry mischiefes fall Upon her dayly, and so many take Armes up against her, as it well might make Her to forsake her nature, and behind, To leave no step for future time to find, As she had never beene, for he that now Can doe her most disgrace, him they alow The times chiefe Champion, and he is the man, The prize, and Palme that absolutely wanne, For where Kings Clossets her free seat hath bin She neere the Lodge, not suffered is to Inne, For ignorance against her stands in state, Like some great porter at a Pallace gate; So dull and barbarous lately are we growne, And there are some this slavery that have sowne, That for mans knowledge it enough doth make, If he can learne, to read an Almanacke; By whom that trash of Amadis de Gaule, Is held an author most authenticall, And things we have, like Noblemen that be In little time, which I have hope to see Upon their foot-clothes, as the streets they ride To have their hornebookes at their girdles ti'd, But all their superfluity of spight On vertues handmaid Poesy doth light, And to extirpe her all their plots they lay, But to her ruine they shall misse the way, For tis alone the Monuments of wit, Above the rage of Tyrants that doe sit, And from their strength, not one himselfe can save, But they shall tryumph o'r his hated grave. In my conceipt, friend, thou didst never see A righter Madman then thou hast of me, For now as Elegiack I bewaile These poore base times; then suddainely I raile And am Satirick, not that I inforce My selfe to be so, but even as remorse, Or hate, in the proud fulnesse of their hight Master my fancy, just so doe I write. But gentle friend as soone shall I behold That stone of which so many have us tould, (Yet never any to this day could make) The great Elixar, or to undertake The Rose-crosse knowledge, which is much like that A Tarrying-iron for fooles to labour at, As ever after I may hope to see, (A plague upon this beastly world for me,) Wit so respected as it was of yore, And if hereafter any it restore, It must be those that yet for many a yeare, Shall be unborne that must inhabit here, And such in vertue as shall be asham'd Almost to heare their ignorant Grandsires nam'd, With whom so many noble spirits then liv'd, That were by them of all reward depriv'd. My noble friend, I would I might have quit This age of these, and that I might have writ, Before all other, how much the brave pen, Had here bin honoured of the English men; Goodnesse and knowledge, held by them in prise, How hatefull to them Ignorance and vice, But it falls out the contrary is true, And so my Jeffreyes for this time adue. UPON THE DEATH OF MISTRIS ELIANOR FALLOWFIELD. Accursed Death, what neede was there at all Of thee, or who to councell did thee call; The subject whereupon these lines I spend For thee was most unfit, her timelesse end Too soone thou wroughtst, too neere her thou didst stand; Thou shouldst have lent thy leane and meager hand To those who oft the help thereof beseech, And can be cured by no other Leech. In this wide world how many thousands be, That having past fourescore, doe call for thee. The wretched debtor in the Jayle that lies, Yet cannot this his Creditor suffice, Doth woe thee oft with many a sigh and teare, Yet thou art coy, and him thou wilt not heare. The Captive slave that tuggeth at the Oares, And underneath the Bulls tough sinewes rores, Begs at thy hand, in lieu of all his paines, That thou wouldst but release him of his chaines; Yet thou a niggard listenest not thereto, With one short gaspe which thou mightst easily do, But thou couldst come to her ere there was neede, And even at once destroy both flowre and seede. But cruell Death if thou so barbarous be, To those so goodly, and so young as shee; That in their teeming thou wilt shew thy spight; Either from marriage thou wilt Maides affright, Or in their wedlock, Widowes lives to chuse, Their Husbands bed, and utterly refuse, Fearing conception; so shalt thou thereby Extirpate mankinde by thy cruelty. If after direfull Tragedy thou thirst, Extinguish Himens Torches at the first; Build Funerall pyles, and the sad pavement strewe, With mournfull Cypresse, &amp; the pale-leav'd Yewe. Away with Roses, Myrtle, and with Bayes; Ensignes of mirth, and jollity, as these, Never at Nuptials used be againe, But from the Church the new Bride entertaine With weeping Nenias, ever and among, As at departings be sad Requiems song. Lucina by th'olde Poets that wert sayd, Women in Childe-birth evermore to ayde, Because thine Altars, long have layne neglected: Nor as they should, thy holy fiers reflected Upon thy Temples, therefore thou doest flye, And wilt not helpe them in necessitie. Thinking upon thee, I doe often muse, Whether for thy deare sake I should accuse Nature or Fortune, Fortune then I blame, And doe impute it as her greatest shame, To hast thy timelesse end, and soone agen I vexe at Nature, nay I curse her then, That at the time of need she was no stronger, That we by her might have enjoy'd thee longer. But whilst of these I with my selfe debate, I call to minde how flinty-hearted Fate Seaseth the olde, the young, the faire, the foule, No thing of earth can Destinie controule: But yet that Fate which hath of life bereft thee, Still to eternall memory hath left thee, Which thou enjoy'st by the deserved breath, That many a great one hath not after death. FINIS. THE MUSES ELIZIVM, Lately discouered, BY A NEW WAY OVER PARNASSVS. The passages therein, being the subiect of ten sundry Nymphalls, Leading three Diuine Poemes, Noahs Floud. Moses, his Birth and Miracles. David and Golia. By Michael Drayton Esquire. TO THE RIGHT HONOURABLE, EDWARD Earle of DORSET, Knight of the Noble Order of the Garter, of his Majesties Privie Counsaile, and Lord Chamberlayne to her Majesty. THE DESCRIPTION OF ELIZIUM. A paradice on earth is found, Though farre from vulgar sight, Which with those pleasures doth abound That it Elizium hight. Where, in Delights that never fade, The Muses lulled be, And sit at pleasure in the shade Of many a stately tree, Which no rough Tempest makes to reele Nor their straight bodies bowes, Their lofty tops doe never feele The weight of winters snowes; In Groves that evermore are greene, No falling leafe is there, But Philomel (of birds the Queene) In Musicke spends the yeare. The Merle upon her mertle Perch, There to the Mavis sings, Who from the top of some curld Berch Those notes redoubled rings; There Daysyes damaske every place Nor once their beauties lose, That when proud Phœbus hides his face Themselves they scorne to close. The Pansy and the Violet here, As seeming to descend, Both from one Root, a very payre, For sweetnesse yet contend, And pointing to a Pinke to tell Which beares it, it is loath, To judge it; but replyes, for smell That it excels them both, Wherewith displeasde they hang their heads So angry soone they grow And from their odoriferous beds Their sweets at it they throw. The winter here a Summer is, No waste is made by time, Nor doth the Autumne ever misse The blossomes of the Prime. The flower that July forth doth bring In Aprill here is seene, The Primrose that puts on the Spring In July decks each Greene. The sweets for soveraignty contend And so abundant be, That to the very Earth they lend And Barke of every Tree: Rills rising out of every Banck, In wilde Meanders strayne, And playing many a wanton pranck Upon the speckled plaine, In Gambols and lascivious Gyres Their time they still bestow Nor to their Fountaines none retyres, Nor on their course will goe Those Brooks with Lillies bravely deckt, So proud and wanton made, That they their courses quite neglect: And seeme as though they stayde, Faire Flora in her state to viewe Which through those Lillies looks, Or as those Lillies leand to shew Their beauties to the brooks. That Phœbus in his lofty race, Oft layes aside his beames And comes to coole his glowing face In these delicious streames; Oft spreading Vines clime up the Cleeves, Whose ripned clusters there, Their liquid purple drop, which drives A Vintage through the yeere. Those Cleeves whose craggy sides are clad With Trees of sundry sutes, Which make continuall summer glad, Even bending with their fruits, Some ripening, ready some to fall, Some blossom'd, some to bloome, Like gorgeous hangings on the wall Of some rich princely Roome: Pomegranates, Lymons, Cytrons, so Their laded branches bow, Their leaves in number that outgoe Nor roomth will them alow. There in perpetuall Summers shade, Apolloes Prophets sit Among the flowres that never fade, But flowrish like their wit; To whom the Nimphes upon their Lyres, Tune many a curious lay, And with their most melodious Quires Make short the longest day. The thrice three Virgins heavenly Cleere, Their trembling Timbrels sound, Whilst the three comely Graces there Dance many a dainty Round, Decay nor Age there nothing knowes, There is continuall Youth, As Time on plant or creatures growes, So still their strength renewth. The Poets Paradice this is, To which but few can come; The Muses onely bower of blisse Their Deare Elizium. Here happy soules, (their blessed bowers, Free from the rude resort Of beastly people) spend the houres, In harmelesse mirth and sport, Then on to the Elizian plaines Apollo doth invite you Where he provides with pastorall straines, In Nimphals to delight you. THE FIRST NIMPHALL. Rodope and Dorida: This Nimphall of delights doth treat, Choice beauties, and proportions neat, Of curious shapes, and dainty features Describd in two most perfect creatures. When Phœbus with a face of mirth, Had flong abroad his beames, To blanch the bosome of the earth, And glaze the gliding streames. Within a goodly Mertle grove, Upon that hallowed day The Nimphes to the bright Queene of love Their vowes were usde to pay. Faire Rodope and Dorida Met in those sacred shades, Then whom the Sunne in all his way, Nere saw two daintier Maids. And through the thickets thrild his fires, Supposing to have seene The soveraigne Goddesse of desires, Or Joves Emperious Queene: Both of so wondrous beauties were, In shape both so excell, That to be paraleld elsewhere, No judging eye could tell. And their affections so surpasse, As well it might be deemd, That th'one of them the other was, And but themselves they seem'd. And whilst the Nimphes that neare this place, Disposed were to play At Barly-breake and Prison-base, Doe passe the time away: This peerlesse payre together set, The other at their sport, None neare their free discourse to let, Each other thus they court, Dorida. My sweet, my soveraigne Rodope, My deare delight, my love, That Locke of hayre thou sentst to me, I to this Bracelet wove; Which brighter every day doth grow The longer it is worne, As its delicious fellowes doe, Thy Temples that adorne. Rodope. Nay had I thine my Dorida, I would them so bestow, As that the winde upon my way, Might backward make them flow, So should it in its greatst excesse Turne to becalmed ayre, And quite forget all boistrousnesse To play with every hayre. Dorida. To me like thine had nature given, A Brow, so Archt, so cleere, A Front, wherein so much of heaven Doth to each eye appeare, The world should see, I would strike dead The Milky way that's now, And say that Nectar Hebe shed Fell all upon my Brow. Rodope. O had I eyes like Doridaes, I would inchant the day, And make the Sunne to stand at gaze, Till he forgot his way: And cause his Sister Queene of Streames, When so I list by night; By her much blushing at my Beames T'eclipse her borrowed light. Dorida. Had I a Cheeke like Rodopes, In midst of which doth stand, A Grove of Roses, such as these, In such a snowy land: I would make the Lilly which we now So much for whitenesse name, As drooping downe the head to bow, And die for very shame. Rodope. Had I a bosome like to thine, When it I pleas'd to show, T'what part o'th'Skie I would incline I would make th'Etheriall bowe; My swannish Breast brancht all with blew, In bravery like the spring: In Winter to the generall view Full Summer forth should bring. Dorida. Had I a body like my deare, Were I so straight so tall, O, if so broad my shoulders were, Had I a waste so small; I would challenge the proud Queene of love To yeeld to me for shape, And I should feare that Mars or Jove Would venter for my rape. Rodope. Had I a hand like thee my Gerle, (This hand O let me kisse) These Ivory Arrowes pyl'd with pearle, Had I a hand like this; I would not doubt at all to make, Each finger of my hand To taske swift Mercury to take With his inchanting wand. Dorida. Had I a Theigh like Rodopes; Which twas my chance to veiwe, When lying on yon banck at ease The wind thy skirt up blew, I would say it were a columne wrought To some intent Divine, And for our chaste Diana sought, A pillar for her shryne. Rodope. Had I a Leg but like to thine That were so neat, so cleane, A swelling Calfe, a Small so fine, An Ankle, round and leane, I would tell nature she doth misse Her old skill; and maintaine, She shewd her master peece in this, Not to be done againe. Dorida. Had I that Foot hid in those shoos, (Proportion'd to my height) Short Heele, thin Instep, even Toes, A Sole so wondrous straight, The Forresters and Nimphes at this Amazed all should stand, And kneeling downe, should meekely kisse The Print left in the sand. By this the Nimphes came from their sport, All pleased wondrous well, And to these Maydens make report What lately them befell: One said the dainty Lelipa Did all the rest out-goe, Another would a wager lay Shee would outstrip a Roe; Sayes one, how like yee Florimel There is your dainty face: A fourth replide, she lik't that well, Yet better lik't her grace, She's counted, I confesse, quoth she, To be our onely Pearle, Yet have I heard her oft to be A melancholly Gerle. Another said she quite mistoke, That onely was her art, When melancholly had her looke Then mirth was in her heart; And hath she then that pretty trick Another doth reply, I thought no Nimph could have bin sick Of that disease but I; I know you can dissemble well Quoth one to give you due, But here be some (who Ile not tell) Can do't as well as you, Who thus replies, I know that too, We have it from our Mother, Yet there be some this thing can doe More cunningly then other: If Maydens but dissemble can Their sorrow and their joy, Their pore dissimulation than, Is but a very toy. THE SECOND NIMPHALL. Lalus Cleon and Lirope. The Muse new Courtship doth devise, By Natures strange Varieties, Whose Rarieties she here relates, And gives you Pastorall Delicates. Lalus a Jolly youthfull Lad, With Cleon, no lesse crown'd With vertues; both their beings had On the Elizian ground. Both having parts so excellent, That it a question was, Which should be the most eminent, Or did in ought surpasse. This Cleon was a Mountaineer, And of the wilder kinde, And from his birth had many a yeere Bin nurst up by a Hinde: And as the sequell well did show, It very well might be; For never Hart, nor Hare, nor Roe, Were halfe so swift as he. But Lalus in the Vale was bred, Amongst the Sheepe and Neate, And by those Nimphes there choicly fed, With Hony, Milke, and Wheate; Of Stature goodly, faire of speech, And of behaviour mylde, Like those there in the Valley rich, That bred him of a chyld. Of Falconry they had the skill, Their Halkes to feed and flye, No better Hunters ere clome Hill, Nor hollowed to a Cry: In Dingles deepe, and Mountains hore, Oft with the bearded Speare They cumbated the tusky Boare, And slew the angry Beare. In Musicke they were wondrous quaint, Fine Aers they could devise; They very curiously could Paint, And neatly Poetize; That wagers many time were laid On Questions that arose, Which Song the witty Lalus made, Which Cleon should compose. The stately Steed they manag'd well, Of Fence the art they knew, For Dansing they did all excell The Gerles that to them drew; To throw the Sledge, to pitch the Barre, To wrestle and to Run, They all the Youth exceld so farre, That still the Prize they wonne. These sprightly Gallants lov'd a Lasse, Cald Lirope the bright, In the whole world there scarcely was So delicate a Wight, There was no Beauty so divine That ever Nimph did grace, But it beyond it selfe did shine In her more hevenly face: What forme she pleasd each thing would take That ere she did behold, Of Pebbles she could Diamonds make, Grosse Iron turne to Gold: Such power there with her presence came Sterne Tempests she alayd, The cruell Tigar she could tame, She raging Torrents staid, She chid, she cherisht, she gave life, Againe she made to dye, She raisd a warre, apeasd a Strife, With turning of her eye. Some said a God did her beget, But much deceiv'd were they, Her Father was a Rivelet, Her Mother was a Fay. Her Lineaments so fine that were, She from the Fayrie tooke, Her Beauties and Complection cleere, By nature from the Brooke. These Ryvalls wayting for the houre (The weather calme and faire) When as she us'd to leave her Bower To take the pleasant ayre, Acosting her; their complement To her their Goddesse done; By gifts they tempt her to consent, When Lalus thus begun. Lalus. Sweet Lirope I have a Lambe Newly wayned from the Damme, Of the right kinde, it is Without hornes. notted, Naturally with purple spotted, Into laughter it will put you, To see how prettily 'twill But you; When on sporting it is set, It will beate you a Corvet, And at every nimble bound Turne it selfe above the ground; When tis hungry it will bleate, From your hand to have its meate, And when it hath fully fed, It will fetch Jumpes above your head, As innocently to expresse Its silly sheepish thankfullnesse, When you bid it, it will play, Be it either night or day, This Lirope I have for thee, So thou alone wilt live with me. Cleon. From him O turne thine eare away, Andheare me my lov'd Lirope, I have a Kid as white as milke, His skin as soft as Naples silke, His hornes in length are wondrous even, And curiously by nature writhen; It is of th'Arcadian kinde, Ther's not the like twixt either Inde; If you walke, 'twill walke you by, If you sit downe, it downe will lye, It with gesture will you wooe, And counterfeit those things you doe; Ore each Hillock it will vault, And nimbly doe the Summer-sault, Upon the hinder Legs 'twill goe, And follow you a furlong so, And if by chance a Tune you roate, 'Twill foote it finely to your note, Seeke the world and you may misse To finde out such a thing as this; This my love I have for thee So thou'lt leave him and goe with me. Lirope. Beleeve me Youths your gifts are rare, And you offer wondrous faire; Lalus for Lambe, Cleon for Kyd, 'Tis hard to judge which most doth bid, And have you two such things in store, And I n'er knew of them before? Well yet I dare a Wager lay That Brag my litle Dog shall play, As dainty tricks when I shall bid, As Lalus Lambe, or Cleons Kid. But t'may fall out that I may need them Till when yee may doe well to feed them; Your Goate and Mutton pretty be But Youths these are noe bayts for me, Alasse good men, in vaine ye wooe, 'Tis not your Lambe nor Kid will doe. Lalus. I have two Sparrowes white as Snow, Whose pretty eyes like sparkes doe show; In her Bosome Venus hatcht them Where her little Cupid watcht them, Till they too fledge their Nests forsooke Themselves and to the Fields betooke, Where by chance a Fowler caught them Of whom I full dearely bought them; They'll fetch you Conserve from the The redde fruit of the smooth Bramble. Hip, And lay it softly on your Lip, Through their nibling bills they'll Chirup And flutering feed you with the Sirup, And if thence you put them by They to your white necke will flye, And if you expulse them there They'll hang upon your braded Hayre; You so long shall see them prattle Till at length they'll fall to battle, And when they have fought their fill, You will smile to see them bill. These Birds my Lirope's shall be So thou'llt leave him and goe with me. Cleon. His Sparrowes are not worth a rush I'le finde as good in every bush, Of Doves I have a dainty paire Which when you please to take the Aier, About your head shall gently hover Your Cleere browe from the Sunne to cover, And with their nimble wings shall fan you, That neither Cold nor Heate shall tan you, And like Umbrellas with their feathers Sheeld you in all sorts of weathers: They be most dainty Coloured things, They have Damask backs and Chequerd wings, Their neckes more Various Cullours showe Then there be mixed in the Bowe; Venus saw the lesser Dove And therewith was farre in Love, Offering for't her goulden Ball For her Sonne to play withall; These my Liropes shall be So shee'll leave him and goe with me. Lirope. Then for Sparrowes, and for Doves I am fitted twixt my Loves, But Lalus, I take noe delight In Sparowes, for they'll scratch and bite And though joynd, they are ever wooing Alwayes billing if not doeing, Twixt Venus breasts if they have lyen I much feare they'll infect myne; Cleon your Doves are very dainty, Tame Pidgeons else you knowe are plenty, These may winne some of your Marrowes I am not caught with Doves, nor Sparrowes, I thanke ye kindly for your Coste, Yet your labour is but loste. Lalus. With full-leav'd Lillies I will stick Thy braded hayre all o'r so thick, That from it a Light shall throw Like the Sunnes upon the Snow. Thy Mantle shall be Violet Leaves, With the fin'st the Silkeworme weaves As finly Woven; whose rich smell The Ayre about thee so shall swell That it shall have no power to moove. A Ruffe of Pinkes thy Robe above About thy necke so neatly set That Art it cannot counterfet, Which still shall looke so Fresh and new, As if upon their Roots they grew: And for thy head Ile have a Tyer Of netting, made of Strawbery wyer, And in each knot that doth compose A Mesh, shall stick a halfe blowne Rose, Red, damaske, white, in order set About the sides, shall run a Fret Of Primroses, the Tyer throughout With Thrift and Daysyes frindgd about; All this faire Nimph Ile doe for thee, So thou'lt leave him and goe with me. Cleon. These be but weeds and Trash he brings, Ile give thee solid, costly things, His will whither and be gone Before thou well canst put them on; With Currall I will have thee Crown'd, Whose Branches intricatly wound Shall girt thy Temples every way; And on the top of every Spray Shall stick a Pearle orient and great, Which so the wandring Birds shall cheat, That some shall stoope to looke for Cheries, As other for tralucent Berries. And wondring, caught e'r they be ware In the curld Tramels of thy hayre: And for thy necke a Christall Chaine Whose lincks shapt like to drops of Raine, Upon thy panting Breast depending, Shall seeme as they were still descending, And as thy breath doth come and goe, So seeming still to ebbe and flow: With Amber Bracelets cut like Bees, Whose strange transparancy who sees, With Silke small as the Spiders Twist Doubled so oft about thy Wrist, Would surely thinke alive they were, From Lillies gathering hony there. Thy Buskins Ivory, carv'd like Shels Of Scallope, which as little Bels Made hollow, with the Ayre shall Chime, And to thy steps shall keepe the time: Leave Lalus, Lirope for me And these shall thy rich dowry be. Lirope. Lalus for Flowers Cleon for Jemmes, For Garlands and for Diadems, I shall be sped, why this is brave, What Nimph can choicer Presents have, With dressing, brading, frowncing, flowring, All your Jewels on me powring, In this bravery being drest, To the ground I shall be prest, That I doubt the Nimphes will feare me, Nor will venture to come neare me; Never Lady of the May, To this houre was halfe so gay; All in flowers, all so sweet, From the Crowne, beneath the Feet, Amber, Currall, Ivory, Pearle, If this cannot winne a Gerle, Thers nothing can, and this ye wooe me, Give me your hands and trust ye to me, (Yet to tell ye I am loth) That I'le have neither of you both. Lalus. When thou shalt please to stem the flood, (As thou art of the watry brood) I'le have twelve Swannes more white then Snow, Yokd for the purpose two and two, To drawe thy Barge wrought of fine Reed So well that it nought else shall need, The Traces by which they shall hayle Thy Barge; shall be the winding trayle Of woodbynd; whose brave Tasseld Flowers (The Sweetnesse of the Woodnimphs Bowres) Shall be the Trappings to adorne, The Swannes, by which thy Barge is borne, Of flowred Flags I'le rob the banke Of water-Cans and King-cups ranck To be the Covering of thy Boate, And on the Streame as thou do'st Floate, The Naiades that haunt the deepe, Themselves about thy Barge shall keepe, Recording most delightfull Layes, By Sea Gods written in thy prayse. And in what place thou hapst to land, There the gentle Silvery sand, Shall soften, curled with the Aier As sensible of thy repayre: This my deare love I'le doe for thee, So Thou'lt leave him and goe with me: Cleon. Tush Nimphe his Swannes will prove but Geese, His Barge drinke water like a Fleece; A Boat is base, I'le thee provide, A Chariot, wherein Jove may ride; In which when bravely thou art borne, Thou shalt looke like the gloryous morne Ushering the Sunne, and such a one As to this day was never none, Of the Rarest Indian Gummes, More pretious then your Balsamummes Which I by Art have made so hard, That they with Tooles may well be Carv'd To make a Coach of: which shall be Materyalls of this one for thee, And of thy Chariot each small peece Shall inlayd be with Amber Greece, And guilded with the Yellow ore Produc'd from Tagus wealthy shore; In which along the pleasant Lawne, With twelve white Stags thou shalt be drawne, Whose brancht palmes of a stately height, With severall nosegayes shall be dight; And as thou ryd'st, thy Coach about, For thy strong guard shall runne a Rout, Of Estriges; whose Curled plumes, Sen'sd with thy Chariots rich perfumes, The scent into the Aier shall throw; Whose naked Thyes shall grace the show; Whilst the Woodnimphs and those bred Upon the mountayns, o'r thy head Shall beare a Canopy of flowers, Tinseld with drops of Aprill showers, Which shall make more glorious showes Then spangles, or your silver Oas; This bright nimph I'le doe for thee So thou'lt leave him and goe with me. Lirope. Vie and revie, like Chapmen profer'd, Would't be receaved what you have offer'd; Ye greater honour cannot doe me, If not building Altars to me: Both by Water and by Land, Bardge and Chariot at command; Swans upon the Streame to tawe me, Stags upon the Land to draw me, In all this Pompe should I be seene, What a pore thing were a Queene: All delights in such excesse, As but yee, who can expresse: Thus mounted should the Nimphes me see, All the troope would follow me, Thinking by this state that I Would asume a Deitie. There be some in love have bin, And I may commit that sinne, And if e'r I be in love, With one of you I feare twill prove, But with which I cannot tell, So my gallant Youths farewell. THE THIRD NIMPHALL. Doron Dorilus Naiis Cloe Cloris Mertilla Claia Florimel With Nimphes and Forresters. Poetick Raptures, sacred fires, With which, Apollo his inspires, This Nimphall gives you; and withall Observes the Muses Festivall. Amongst th'Elizians many mirthfull Feasts, At which the Muses are the certaine guests, Th'observe one Day with most Emperiall state, To wise Apollo which they dedicate, The Poets God, and to his Alters bring Th'enaml'd Bravery of the beauteous spring, And strew their Bowers with every precious sweet, Which still wax fresh, most trod on with their feet; With most choice flowers each Nimph doth brade her hayre, And not the mean'st but bauldrick wise doth weare Some goodly Garland, and the most renown'd With curious Roseat Anadems are crown'd. These being come into the place where they Yearely observe the Orgies to that day, The Muses from their Heliconian spring Their brimfull Mazers to the feasting bring: When with deepe Draughts out of those plenteous Bowles, The jocond Youth have swild their thirsty soules, They fall enraged with a sacred heat, And when their braines doe once begin to sweat They into brave and Stately numbers breake, And not a word that any one doth speake But tis Prophetick, and so strangely farre In their high fury they transported are, As there's not one, on any thing can straine, But by another answred is againe In the same Rapture, which all sit to heare; When as two Youths that soundly liquord were, Dorilus and Doron, two as noble swayns As ever kept on the Elizian playns, First by their signes attention having woonne, Thus they the Revels frolikly begunne: Doron. Come Dorilus, let us be brave, In lofty numbers let us rave, With Rymes I will inrich thee. Dorilus. Content say I, then bid the base, Our wits shall runne the Wildgoose chase, Spurre up, or I will swich thee. Doron. The Sunne out of the East doth peepe, And now the day begins to creepe, Upon the world at leasure. Dorilus. The Ayre enamor'd of the Greaves, The West winde stroaks the velvit leaves And kisses them at pleasure. Doron. The Spinners webs twixt spray and spray, The top of every bush make gay, By filmy coards there dangling. Dorilus. For now the last dayes evening dew Even to the full it selfe doth shew, Each bough with Pearle bespangling. Doron. O Boy how thy abundant vaine Even like a Flood breaks from thy braine, Nor can thy Muse be gaged. Dorilus. Why nature forth did never bring A man that like to me can sing, If once I be enraged. Doron. Why Dorilus I in my skill Can make the swiftest Streame stand still, Nay beare back to his springing. Dorilus. And I into a Trance most deepe Can cast the Birds that they shall sleepe When fain'st they would be singing. Doron. Why Dorilus thou mak'st me mad, And now my wits begin to gad, But sure I know not whither. Dorilus. O Doron let me hug thee then, There never was two madder men, Then let us on together. Doron. Hermes the winged Horse bestrid, And thorow thick and thin he rid, And floundred throw the Fountaine. Dorilus. He spurd the Tit untill he bled, So that at last he ran his head Against the forked Mountaine, Doron. How sayst thou, but pyde Iris got, Into great Junos Chariot, I spake with one that saw her. Dorilus. And there the pert and sawcy Elfe Behav'd her as twere Juno's selfe, And made the Peacoks draw her. Doron. Ile borrow Phœbus fiery Jades, With which about the world he trades, And put them in my Plow. Dorilus. O thou most perfect frantique man, Yet let thy rage be what it can, Ile be as mad as thou. Doron. Ile to great Jove, hap good, hap ill, Though he with Thunder threat to kill, And beg of him a boone. Dorilus. To swerve up one of Cynthias beames, And there to bath thee in the streames, Discoverd in the Moone. Doron. Come frolick Youth and follow me, My frantique boy, and Ile show thee The Countrey of the Fayries. Dorilus. The fleshy Mandrake where't doth grow In noonshade of the Mistletow, And where the Phœnix Aryes. Doron. Nay more, the Swallowes winter bed, The Caverns where the Winds are bred, Since thus thou talkst of showing. Dorilus. And to those Indraughts Ile thee bring, That wondrous and eternall spring Whence th'Ocean hath its flowing. Doron. We'll downe to the darke house of sleepe, Where snoring Morpheus doth keepe, And wake the drowsy Groome. Dorilus. Downe shall the Dores and Windowes goe, The Stooles upon the Floare we'll throw, And roare about the Roome. The Muses here commanded them to stay, Commending much the caridge of their Lay As greatly pleasd at this their madding Bout, To heare how bravely they had borne it out From first to the last, of which they were right glad, By this they found that Helicon still had That vertue it did anciently retaine When Orpheus, Lynus and th'Ascrean Swaine Tooke lusty Rowses, which hath made their Rimes, To last so long to all succeeding times. And now amongst this beauteous Beavie here, Two wanton Nimphes, though dainty ones they were, Naiis and Cloe in their female fits Longing to show the sharpnesse of their wits, Of the nine Sisters speciall leave doe crave That the next Bout they two might freely have, Who having got the suffrages of all, Thus to their Rimeing instantly they fall. Naiis. Amongst you all let us see Who ist opposes mee, Come on the proudest she To answere my dittye. Cloe. Why Naiis, that am I, Who dares thy pride defie? And that we soone shall try Though thou be witty. Naiis. Cloe I scorne my Rime Should observe feet or time, Now I fall, then I clime, What is't I dare not. Cloe. Give thy Invention wing, And let her flert and fling, Till downe the Rocks she ding, For that I care not. Naiis. This presence delights me, My freedome invites me, The Season excytes me, In Rime to be merry. Cloe. And I beyond measure, Am ravisht with pleasure, To answer each Ceasure, Untill thou beist weary. Naiis. Behold the Rosye Dawne, Rises in Tinfild Lawne, And smiling seemes to fawne, Upon the mountaines. Cloe. Awaked from her Dreames Shooting foorth goulden Beames Dansing upon the Streames Courting the Fountaines. Naiis. These more then sweet Showrets, Intice up these Flowrets, To trim up our Bowrets, Perfuming our Coats. Cloe. Whilst the Birds billing Each one with his Dilling The thickets still filling With Amorous Noets. Naiis. The Bees up in hony rould, More then their thighes can hould, Lapt in their liquid gould, Their Treasure us bringing. Cloe. To these Rillets purling Upon the stones Curling, And oft about wherling, Dance tow'ard their springing. Naiis. The Wood-Nimphes sit singing, Each Grove with notes ringing Whilst fresh Ver is flinging, Her Bounties abroad. Cloe. So much as the Turtle, Upon the low Mertle, To the meads fertle, Her Cares doth unload. Naiis. Nay 'tis a world to see, In every bush and Tree, The Birds with mirth and glee, Woo'd as they woe. Cloe. The Robin and the Wren, Every Cocke with his Hen, Why should not we and men, Doe as they doe. Naiis. The Fairies are hopping, The small Flowers cropping, And with dew dropping, Skip thorow the Greaves. Cloe. At Barly-breake they play Merrily all the day, At night themselves they lay Upon the soft leaves. Naiis. The gentle winds sally Upon every Valley, And many times dally And wantonly sport. Cloe. About the fields tracing, Each other in chasing, And often imbracing, In amorous sort. Naiis. And Eccho oft doth tell Wondrous things from her Cell, As her what chance befell, Learning to prattle. Cloe. And now she sits and mocks The Shepherds and their flocks, And the Heards from the Rocks Keeping their Cattle. When to these Maids the Muses silence cry, For twas th'opinion of the Company, That were not these two taken of, that they Would in their Conflict wholly spend the day. When as the Turne to Florimel next came, A Nimph for Beauty of especiall name, Yet was she not so Jolly as the rest: And though she were by her companions prest, Yet she by no intreaty would be wrought To sing, as by th'Elizian Lawes she ought: When two bright Nimphes that her companions were, And of all other onely held her deare, Mild Cloris and Mertilla, with faire speech Their most beloved Florimel beseech, T'observe the Muses, and the more to wooe her, They take their turnes, and thus they sing unto her. Cloris. Sing Florimel, O sing, and wee Our whole wealth will give to thee, We'll rob the brim of every Fountaine, Strip the sweets from every Mountaine, We will sweepe the curled valleys, Brush the bancks that mound our allyes, We will muster natures dainties When she wallowes in her plentyes, The lushyous smell of every flower New washt by an Aprill shower, The Mistresse of her store we'll make thee That she for her selfe shall take thee; Can there be a dainty thing, That's not thine if thou wilt sing. Mertilla. When the dew in May distilleth, And the Earths rich bosome filleth, And with Pearle embrouds each Meadow, We will make them like a widow, And in all their Beauties dresse thee, And of all their spoiles possesse thee, With all the bounties Zephyre brings, Breathing on the yearely springs, The gaudy bloomes of every Tree In their most Beauty when they be, What is here that may delight thee, Or to pleasure may excite thee, Can there be a dainty thing That's not thine if thou wilt sing. But Florimel still sullenly replyes I will not sing at all, let that suffice: When as a Nimph one of the merry ging Seeing she no way could be wonne to sing; Come, come, quoth she, ye utterly undoe her With your intreaties, and your reverence to her; For praise nor prayers, she careth not a pin; They that our froward Florimel would winne, Must worke another way, let me come to her, Either Ile make her sing, or Ile undoe her. Claia. Florimel I thus conjure thee, Since their gifts cannot alure thee; By stampt Garlick, that doth stink Worse then common Sewer, or Sink, By Henbane, Dogsbane, Woolfsbane, sweet As any Clownes or Carriers feet, By stinging Nettles, pricking Teasels Raysing blisters like the measels, By the rough Burbreeding docks, Rancker then the oldest Fox, By filthy Hemblock, poysning more Then any ulcer or old sore, By the Cockle in the corne That smels farre worse then doth burnt horne, By Hempe in water that hath layne, By whose stench the Fish are slayne, By Toadflax which your Nose may tast, If you have a minde to cast, May all filthy stinking Weeds That e'r bore leafe, or e'r had seeds, Florimel be given to thee, If thou'lt not sing as well as wee. At which the Nimphs to open laughter fell, Amongst the rest the beauteous Florimel, (Pleasd with the spell from Claia that came, A mirthfull Gerle and given to sport and game) As gamesome growes as any of them all, And to this ditty instantly doth fall. Florimel. How in my thoughts should I contrive The Image I am framing, Which is so farre superlative, As tis beyond all naming; I would Jove of my counsell make, And have his judgement in it, But that I doubt he would mistake How rightly to begin it: It must be builded in the Ayre, And tis my thoughts must doe it, And onely they must be the stayre From earth to mount me to it, For of my Sex I frame my Lay, Each houre, our selves forsaking, How should I then finde out the way To this my undertaking, When our weake Fancies working still, Yet changing every minnit, Will show that it requires some skill, Such difficulty's in it. We would things, yet we know not what, And let our will be granted, Yet instantly we finde in that Something unthought of wanted: Our joyes and hopes such shadowes are, As with our motions varry, Which when we oft have fetcht from farre, With us they never tarry: Some worldly crosse doth still attend, What long we have bin spinning, And e'r we fully get the end We lose of our beginning. Our pollicies so peevish are, That with themselves they wrangle, And many times become the snare That soonest us intangle; For that the Love we beare our Friends Though nere so strongly grounded, Hath in it certaine oblique ends, If to the bottome sounded: Our owne well wishing making it, A pardonable Treason; For that it is derivd from witt, And underpropt with reason. For our Deare selves beloved sake (Even in the depth of passion) Our Center though our selves we make, Yet is not that our station; For whilst our Browes ambitious be And youth at hand awayts us, It is a pretty thing to see How finely Beautie cheats us And whylst with tyme we tryfling stand To practise Antique graces Age with a pale and witherd hand Drawes Furowes in our faces. When they which so desirous were before To hear her sing; desirous are far more To have her cease; and call to have her stayd For she to much alredy had bewray'd. And as the thrice three Sisters thus had grac'd Their Celebration, and themselves had plac'd Upon a Violet banck, in order all Where they at will might view the Festifall The Nimphs and all the lusty youth that were At this brave Nimphall, by them honored there, To Gratifie the heavenly Gerles againe Lastly prepare in state to entertaine Those sacred Sisters, fairely and confer, On each of them, their prayse particular; And thus the Nimphes to the nine Muses sung, When as the Youth and Forresters among That well prepared for this businesse were, Become the Chorus, and thus sung they there. Nimphes. Clio thou first of those Celestiall nine That daily offer to the sacred shryne, Of wise Apollo; Queene of Stories, Thou that vindicat'st the glories Of passed ages, and renewst Their acts which every day thou viewst, And from a lethargy dost keepe Old nodding time, else prone to sleepe. Chorus. Clio O crave of Phœbus to inspire Us, for his Altars with his holiest fire, And let his glorious ever-shining Rayes Give life and growth to our Elizian Bayes. Nimphes. Melpomine thou melancholly Maid Next, to wise Phœbus we invoke thy ayd, In Buskins that dost stride the Stage, And in thy deepe distracted rage, In blood-shed that dost take delight, Thy object the most fearfull sight, That lovest the sighes, the shreekes, and sounds Of horrors, that arise from wounds. Chorus. Sad Muse, O crave of Phœbus to inspire Us for his Altars, with his holiest fire, And let his glorious ever-shining Rayes Give life and growth to our Elizian Bayes. Nimphes. Comick Thalia then we come to thee, Thou mirthfull Mayden, onely that in glee And in loves deceits, thy pleasure tak'st, Of which thy varying Scene thou mak'st And in thy nimble Sock do'st stirre Loude laughter through the Theater, That with the Peasant mak'st thee sport, As well as with the better sort. Chorus. Thalia crave of Phebus to inspire, Us for his Alters with his holyest fier; And let his glorious ever-shining Rayes Give life, and growth to our Elizian Bayes. Nimphes. Euterpe next to thee we will proceed, That first found'st out the Musick on the Reed, With breath and fingers giving life, To the shrill Cornet and the Fyfe, Teaching every stop and kaye, To those upon the Pipe that playe, Those which Wind-Instruments we call Or soft, or lowd, or greate, or small. Chorus. Euterpe aske of Phebus to inspire, Us for his Alters with his holyest fire And let his glorious ever-shining Rayes Give life and growth to our Elizian Bayes. Nimphes. Terpsichore thou of the Lute and Lyre, And Instruments that sound with Cords and Wyere, That art the Mistres, to commaund The touch of the most Curious hand, When every Quaver doth Imbrace His like, in a true Diapase, And every string his sound doth fill Toucht with the Finger or the Quill. Chorus. Terpsichore, crave Phebus to inspire Us for his Alters with his holyest fier And let his glorious ever-shining Rayes Give life and growth to our Elizian Bayes. Nimphes. Then Erato wise muse on thee we call In Lynes to us that do'st demonstrate all, Which neatly, with thy Staffe and Bowe, Do'st measure, and proportion showe; Motion and Gesture that dost teach That every height and depth canst reach, And do'st demonstrate by thy Art What nature else would not Impart. Chorus. Deare Erato crave Phebus to inspire Us for his Alters with his holyest fire, And let his glorious ever-shining Rayes, Give life and growth to our Elizian Bayes. Nimphes. To thee then brave Caliope we come Thou that maintain'st, the Trumpet, and the Drum; The neighing Steed that lovest to heare, Clashing of Armes doth please thine eare, In lofty Lines that do'st rehearse Things worthy of a thundring verse, And at no tyme art heard to straine, On ought, that suits a Common vayne. Chorus. Caliope, crave Phebus to inspire, Us for his Alters, with his holyest fier, And let his glorious ever-shining Rayes, Give life and growth to our Elizian Bayes. Nimphes. Then Polyhymnia most delicious Mayd, In Rhetoricks Flowers that art arayd, In Tropes and Figures, richly drest, The Fyled Phrase that lovest best, That art all Elocution, and The first that gav'st to understand The force of wordes in order plac'd And with a sweet delivery grac'd. Chorus. Sweet Muse perswade our Phœbus to inspire Us for his Altars, with his holiest fire, And let his glorious ever-shining Rayes Give life and growth to our Elizian Bayes. Nimphes. Lofty Urania then we call to thee, To whom the Heavens for ever opened be, Thou th'Asterismes by name dost call, And shewst when they doe rise and fall, Each Planets force, and dost divine His working, seated in his Signe, And how the starry Frame still roules Betwixt the fixed stedfast Poles. Chorus. Urania aske of Phœbus to inspire Us for his Altars with his holiest fire, And let his glorious ever-shining Rayes Give life and growth to our Elizian Bayes. THE FOURTH NIMPHALL. Cloris and Mertilla. Chaste Cloris doth disclose the shames Of the Felician frantique Dames, Mertilla strives t'apease her woe, To golden wishes then they goe. Mertilla. Why how now Cloris, what, thy head Bound with forsaken Willow? Is the cold ground become thy bed? The grasse become thy pillow? O let not those life-lightning eyes In this sad vayle be shrowded, Which into mourning puts the Skyes, To see them over clowded. Cloris. O my Mertilla doe not praise These Lampes so dimly burning, Such sad and sullen lights as these Were onely made for mourning: Their objects are the barren Rocks With aged Mosse o'r shaded; Now whilst the Spring layes forth her Locks With blossomes bravely braded. Mertilla. O Cloris, Can there be a Spring, O my deare Nimph, there may not, Wanting thine eyes it forth to bring, Without which Nature cannot: Say what it is that troubleth thee Encreast by thy concealing, Speake; sorrowes many times we see Are lesned by revealing. Cloris. Being of late too vainely bent And but at too much leasure; Not with our Groves and Downes content, But surfetting in pleasure; Felicia's Fields I would goe see, Where fame to me reported, The choyce Nimphes of the world to be From meaner beauties sorted; Hoping that I from them might draw Some graces to delight me, But there such monstrous shapes I saw, That to this houre affright me. Throw the thick Hayre, that thatch'd their Browes Their eyes upon me stared, Like to those raging frantique Froes For Bacchus Feasts prepared: Their Bodies, although straight by kinde, Yet they so monstrous make them, That for huge Bags blowne up with wind, You very well may take them. Their Bowels in their Elbowes are, Whereon depend their Panches, And their deformed Armes by farre Made larger then their Hanches: For their behaviour and their grace, Which likewise should have priz'd them, Their manners were as beastly base As th'rags that so disguisd them; All Anticks, all so impudent, So fashon'd out of fashion, As blacke Cocytus up had sent Her Fry into this nation, Whose monstrousnesse doth so perplex, Of Reason and deprives me, That for their sakes I loath my sex, Which to this sadnesse drives me. Mertilla. O my deare Cloris be not sad, Nor with these Furies danted, But let these female fooles be mad, With Hellish pride inchanted; Let not thy noble thoughts descend So low as their affections; Whom neither counsell can amend, Nor yet the Gods corrections: Such mad folks ne'r let us bemoane, But rather scorne their folly, And since we two are here alone, To banish melancholly, Leave we this lowly creeping vayne Not worthy admiration, And in a brave and lofty strayne, Lets exercise our passion, With wishes of each others good, From our abundant treasures, And in this jocond sprightly mood Thus alter we our measures. Mertilla. O I could wish this place were strewd with Roses, And that this Banck were thickly thrumd with Grasse As soft as Sleave, or Sarcenet ever was, Whereon my Cloris her sweet selfe reposes. Cloris. O that these Dewes Rosewater were for thee, These Mists Perfumes that hang upon these thicks, And that the Winds were All Aromaticks, Which if my wish could make them, they should bee. Mertilla. O that my Bottle one whole Diamond were, So fild with Nectar that a Flye might sup, And at one draught that thou mightst drinke it up, Yet a Carouse not good enough I feare. Cloris. That all the Pearle, the Seas, or Indias have Were well dissolv'd, and thereof made a Lake, Thou there in bathing, and I by to take Pleasure to see thee cleerer then the Wave. Mertilla. O that the hornes of all the Heards we see Were of fine gold, or else that every horne Were like to that one of the Unicorne, And of all these, not one but were thy Fee. Cloris. O that their Hooves were Ivory, or some thing, Then the pur'st Ivory farre more Christalline, Fild with the food wherewith the Gods doe dine, To keepe thy Youth in a continuall Spring. Mertilla. O that the sweets of all the Flowers that grow, The labouring ayre would gather into one, In Gardens, Fields, nor Meadowes leaving none, And all their Sweetnesse upon thee would throw. Cloris. Nay that those sweet harmonious straines we heare, Amongst the lively Birds melodious Layes, As they recording sit upon the Sprayes, Were hovering still for Musick at thine eare. Mertilla. O that thy name were carv'd on every Tree, That as these plants, still great, and greater grow, Thy name deare Nimph might be enlarged so, That every Grove and Coppis might speake thee. Cloris. Nay would thy name upon their Rynds were set, And by the Nimphes so oft and lowdly spoken, As that the Ecchoes to that language broken Thy happy name might hourely counterfet. Mertilla. O let the Spring still put sterne winter by, And in rich Damaske let her Revell still, As it should doe if I might have my will, That thou mightst still walke on her Tapistry; And thus since Fate no longer time alowes Under this broad and shady Sicamore, Where now we sit, as we have oft before, Those yet unborne shall offer up their Vowes. THE FIFT NIMPHALL. Claia Lelipa Clarinax a Hermit. Of Garlands, Anadems, and Wreathes This Nimphall nought but sweetnesse breathes, Presents you with delicious Posies, And with powerfull Simples closes. Claia. See where old Clarinax is set, His sundry Simples sorting, From whose experience we may get What worthy is reporting. Then Lelipa let us draw neere, Whilst he his weeds is weathering, I see some powerfull Simples there That he hath late bin gathering. Haile gentle Hermit, Jove thee speed, And have thee in his keeping, And ever helpe thee at thy need, Be thou awake or sleeping. Clarinax. Ye payre of most Celestiall lights, O Beauties three times burnisht, Who could expect such heavenly wights With Angels features furnisht; What God doth guide you to this place, To blesse my homely Bower? It cannot be but this high grace Proceeds from some high power; The houres like hand maids still attend, Disposed at your pleasure, Ordayned to noe other end But to awaite your leasure; The Deawes drawne up into the Aer, And by your breathes perfumed, In little Clouds doe hover there As loath to be consumed: The Aer moves not but as you please, So much sweet Nimphes it owes you, The winds doe cast them to their ease, And amorously inclose you. Lelipa. Be not too lavish of thy praise, Thou good Elizian Hermit, Lest some to heare such words as these, Perhaps may flattery tearme it; But of your Simples something say, Which may discourse affoord us, We know your knowledge lyes that way, With subjects you have stor'd us. Claia. We know for Physick yours you get, Which thus you heere are sorting, And upon Garlands we are set, With Wreathes and Posyes sporting: Each Garden great abundance yeelds, Whose Flowers invite us thither; But you abroad in Groves and Fields Your Medc'nall Simples gather. Lelipa. The Chaplet and the Anadem, The curled Tresses crowning, We looser Nimphes delight in them, Not in your Wreathes renowning. Clarinax. The Garland long agoe was worne, As Time pleasd to bestow it, The Lawrell onely to adorne The Conquerer and the Poet. The Palme his due, who uncontrould, On danger looking gravely, When Fate had done the worst it could, Who bore his Fortunes bravely. Most worthy of the Oken Wreath The Ancients him esteemed, Who in a Battle had from death Some man of worth redeemed. About his Temples Grasse they tye, Himselfe that so behaved In some strong Seedge by th'Enemy, A City that hath saved. A Wreath of Vervaine Herhauts weare, Amongst our Garlands named, Being sent that dreadfull newes to beare, Offensive warre proclaimed. The Signe of Peace who first displayes, The Olive Wreath possesses: The Lover with the Myrtle Sprayes Adornes his crisped Tresses. In Love the sad forsaken wight The Willow Garland weareth: The Funerall man befitting night, The balefull Cipresse beareth. To Pan we dedicate the Pine, Whose slips the Shepherd graceth: Againe the Ivie and the Vine On his, swolne Bacchus placeth. Claia. The Boughes and Sprayes, of which you tell, By you are rightly named, But we with those of pretious smell And colours, are enflamed; The noble Ancients to excite Men to doe things worth crowning, Not unperformed left a Rite, To heighten their renowning: But they that those rewards devis'd, And those brave wights that wore them By these base times, though poorely priz'd, Yet Hermit we adore them. The store of every fruitfull Field We Nimphes at will possessing, From that variety they yeeld Get Flowers for every dressing: Of Which a Garland Ile compose, Then busily attend me, These Flowers I for that purpose chose, But where I misse amend me. Clarinax. Well Claia on with your intent, Lets see how you will weave it, Which done, here for a monument I hope with me, you'll leave it. Claia. Here Damaske Roses, white and red, Out of my lap first take I, Which still shall runne along the thred, My chiefest Flower this make I: Amongst these Roses in a row, Next place I Pinks in plenty, These double Daysyes then for show, And will not this be dainty. The pretty Pansy then Ile tye Like Stones some chaine inchasing, And next to them their neere Alye, The purple Violet placing. The curious choyce, Clove July-flower Whose kinds height the Carnation For sweetnesse of most soveraine power Shall helpe my Wreath to fashion. Whose sundry cullers of one kinde First from one Root derived, Them in their severall sutes Ile binde, My Garland so contrived; A course of Cowslips then Ile stick, And here and there though sparely The pleasant Primrose downe Ile prick Like Pearles, which will show rarely: Then with these Marygolds Ile make My Garland somewhat swelling, These Honysuckles then Ile take, Whose sweets shall helpe their smelling: The Lilly and the Flower-delice, For colour much contenting, For that, I them doe onely prize, They are but pore in senting: The Daffadill most dainty is To match with these in meetnesse; The Columbyne compar'd to this, All much alike for sweetnesse. These in their natures onely are Fit to embosse the border, Therefore Ile take especiall care To place them in their order: Sweet-Williams, Campions, Sops-in-wine One by another neatly: Thus have I made this Wreath of mine, And finished it featly. Lelipa. Your Garland thus you finisht have, Then as we have attended Your leasure, likewise let me crave I may the like be friended. Those gaudy garish Flowers you chuse, In which our Nimphes are flaunting, Which they at Feasts and Brydals use, The sight and smell inchanting: A Chaplet me of Hearbs Ile make, Then which though yours be braver, Yet this of myne I'le undertake Shall not be short in savour. With Basill then I will begin, Whose scent is wondrous pleasing, This Eglantine I'le next put in, The sense with sweetnes seasing. Then in my Lavender I'le lay, Muscado put among it, And here and there a leafe of Bay, Which still shall runne along it. Germander, Marjeram, and Tyme Which used for strewing, With Hisop as an hearbe most pryme Here in my wreath bestowing. Then Balme and Mynt helps to make up My Chaplet, and for Tryall, Costmary that so likes the Cup, And next it Penieryall. Then Burnet shall beare up with this Whose leafe I greatly fansy, Some Camomile doth not amisse With Savory and some Tansy, Then heere and there I'le put a sprig Of Rosemary into it. Thus not too little nor too big Tis done if I can doe it. Clarinax. Claia your Garland is most gaye, Compos'd of curious Flowers, And so most lovely Lelipa, This Chaplet is of yours, In goodly Gardens yours you get Where you your laps have laded; My symples are by Nature set, In Groves and Fields untraded. Your Flowers most curiously you twyne, Each one his place supplying, But these rough harsher Hearbs of mine, About me rudely lying, Of which some dwarfish Weeds there be, Some of a larger stature, Some by experience as we see, Whose names expresse their nature, Heere is my Moly of much fame, In Magicks often used, Mugwort and Night-shade for the same, But not by me abused; Here Henbane, Popy, Hemblock here, Procuring Deadly sleeping, Which I doe minister with Feare, Not fit for each mans keeping. Heere holy Vervayne, and heere Dill, Against witchcraft much availing, Here Horhound gainst the Mad dogs ill By biting, never failing. Here Mandrake that procureth love, In poysning Philters mixed, And makes the Barren fruitfull prove, The Root about them fixed, Inchaunting Lunary here lyes In Sorceries excelling, And this is Dictam, which we prize Shot shafts and Darts expelling, Here Saxifrage against the stone That Powerfull is approved, Here Dodder by whose help alone, Ould Agues are removed; Here Mercury, here Helibore, Ould Ulcers mundifying, And Shepheards-purse the Flux most sore, That helpes by the applying; Here wholsome Plantane, that the payne Of Eyes and Eares appeases; Here cooling Sorrell that againe We use in hot diseases: The medcinable Mallow here, Asswaging sudaine Tumors, The jagged Polypodium there, To purge ould rotten humors, Next these here Egremony is, That helpes the Serpents byting, The blessed Betony by this, Whose cures deserven writing: This All-heale, and so nam'd of right, New wounds so quickly healing, A thousand more I could recyte, Most worthy of Revealing, But that I hindred am by Fate, And busnesse doth prevent me, To cure a mad man, which of late Is from Felicia sent me. Claia. Nay then thou hast inough to doe, We pity thy enduring, For they are there infected soe, That they are past thy curing. THE SIXT NIMPHALL. Silvius Halcius. Melanthus. A Woodman, Fisher, and a Swaine This Nimphall through with mirth maintaine, Whose pleadings so the Nimphes doe please, That presently they give them Bayes. Cleere had the day bin from the dawne, All chequerd was the Skye, Thin Clouds like Scarfs of Cobweb Lawne Vayld Heaven's most glorious eye. The Winde had no more strength then this, That leasurely it blew, To make one leafe the next to kisse, That closly by it grew. The Rils that on the Pebbles playd, Might now be heard at will; This world they onely Musick made, Else every thing was still. The Flowers like brave embraudred Gerles, Lookt as they much desired, To see whose head with orient Pearles, Most curiously was tyred; And to it selfe the subtle Ayre, Such soverainty assumes, That it receiv'd too large a share From natures rich perfumes. When the Elizian Youth were met, That were of most account, And to disport themselves were set Upon an easy Mount: Neare which, of stately Firre and Pine There grew abundant store, The Tree that weepeth Turpentine, And shady Sicamore. Amongst this merry youthfull trayne A Forrester they had, A Fisher, and a Shepheards swayne A lively Countrey Lad: Betwixt which three a question grew, Who should the worthiest be, Which violently they pursue, Nor stickled would they be. That it the Company doth please This civill strife to stay, Freely to heare what each of these For his brave selfe could say: When first this Forrester (of all) That Silvius had to name, To whom the Lot being cast doth fall, Doth thus begin the Game, Silvius. For my profession then, and for the life I lead All others to excell, thus for my selfe I plead; I am the Prince of sports, the Forrest is my Fee, He's not upon the Earth for pleasure lives like me; The Morne no sooner puts her Rosye Mantle on, But from my quyet Lodge I instantly am gone, When the melodious Birds from every Bush and Bryer Of the wilde spacious Wasts, make a continuall quire; The motlied Meadowes then, new vernisht with the Sunne Shute up their spicy sweets upon the winds that runne, In easly ambling Gales, and softly seeme to pace, That it the longer might their lushiousnesse imbrace: I am clad in youthfull Greene, I other colours scorne, My silken Bauldrick beares my Beugle, or my Horne, Which setting to my Lips, I winde so lowd and shrill, As makes the Ecchoes showte from every neighbouring Hill: My Doghooke at my Belt, to which my Lyam's tyde, My Sheafe of Arrowes by, my Woodknife at my Syde, My Crosse-bow in my Hand, my Gaffle or my Rack To bend it when I please, or it I list to slack, My Hound then in my Lyam, I by the Woodmans art Forecast, where I may lodge the goodly Hie-palm'd Hart, To viewe the grazing Heards, so sundry times I use, Where by the loftiest Head I know my Deare to chuse, And to unheard him then, I gallop o'r the ground Upon my wel-breath'd Nag, to cheere my earning Hound. Sometime I pitch my Toyles the Deare alive to take, Sometime I like the Cry, the deepe-mouth'd Kennell make, Then underneath my Horse, I staulke my game to strike, And with a single Dog to hunt him hurt, I like. The Silvians are to me true subjects, I their King, The stately Hart, his Hind doth to my presence bring, The Buck his loved Doe, the Roe his tripping Mate, Before me to my Bower, whereas I sit in State. The Dryads, Hamadryads, the Satyres and the Fawnes Oft play at Hyde and Seeke before me on the Lawnes, The frisking Fayry oft when horned Cinthia shines Before me as I walke dance wanton Matachynes, The numerous feathered flocks that the wild Forrests haunt Their Silvan songs to me, in cheerefull dittyes chaunte, The shades like ample Sheelds, defend me from the Sunne, Through which me to refresh the gentle Rivelets runne, No little bubling Brook from any Spring that falls But on the Pebbles playes me pretty Madrigals. I'th'morne I clime the Hills, where wholsome winds do blow, At Noone-tyde to the Vales, and shady Groves below, T'wards Evening I againe the Chrystall Floods frequent, In pleasure thus my life continually is spent. As Princes and great Lords have Pallaces, so I Have in the Forrests here, my Hall and Gallery The tall and stately Woods; which underneath are Plaine, The Groves my Gardens are, the Heath and Downes againe My wide and spacious walkes, then say all what ye can, The Forester is still your only gallant man. He of his speech scarce made an end, But him they load with prayse, The Nimphes most highly him commend, And vow to give him Bayes: He's now cryde up of every one, And who but onely he, The Forrester's the man alone, The worthyest of the three. When some then th'other farre more stayd, Wil'd them a while to pause, For there was more yet to be sayd, That might deserve applause, When Halcius his turne next plyes, And silence having wonne, Roome for the fisher man he cryes, And thus his Plea begunne. Halcius. No Forrester, it so must not be borne away, But heare what for himselfe the Fisher first can say, The Chrystall current Streames continually I keepe, Where every Pearle-pav'd Foard, and every Blew-eyd deepe With me familiar are; when in my Boate being set, My Oare I take in hand, my Angle and my Net About me; like a Prince my selfe in state I steer, Now up, now downe the Streame, now am I here, now ther, The Pilot and the Fraught my selfe; and at my ease Can land me when I list, or in what place I please, The Silver-scaled Sholes, about me in the Streames, As thick as ye discerne the Atoms in the Beames, Neare to the shady Banck where slender Sallowes grow, And Willows their shag'd tops downe t'wards the waters bow, I shove in with my Boat to sheeld me from the heat, Where chusing from my Bag, some prov'd especiall bayt, The goodly well growne Trout I with my Angle strike, And with my bearded Wyer I take the ravenous Pike, Of whom when I have hould, he seldome breakes away Though at my Lynes full length, soe long I let him play Till by my hand I finde he well-nere wearyed be, When softly by degrees I drawe him up to me. The lusty Samon to, I oft with Angling take, Which me above the rest most Lordly sport doth make, Who feeling he is caught, such Frisks and bounds doth fetch, And by his very strength my Line soe farre doth stretch, As drawes my floating Corcke downe to the very ground, And wresting of my Rod, doth make my Boat turne round. I never idle am, some tyme I bayt my Weeles, With which by night I take the dainty silver Eeles, And with my Draughtnet then, I sweepe the streaming Flood, And to my Tramell next, and Cast-net from the Mud, I beate the Scaly brood, noe hower I idely spend, But wearied with my worke I bring the day to end: The Naiides and Nymphes that in the Rivers keepe, Which take into their care, the store of every deepe, Amongst the Flowery flags, the Bullrushes and Reed, That of the Spawne have charge (abundantly to breed) Well mounted upon Swans, their naked bodys lend To my discerning eye, and on my Boate attend, And dance upon the Waves, before me (for my sake) To th'Musick the soft wynd upon the Reeds doth make. And for my pleasure more, the rougher Gods of Seas From Neptunes Court send in the blew Neriades, Which from his bracky Realme upon the Billowes ride And beare the Rivers backe with every streaming Tyde, Those Billowes gainst my Boate, borne with delightfull Gales Oft seeming as I rowe to tell me pretty tales, Whilst Ropes of liquid Pearle still load my laboring Oares, As streacht upon the Streame they stryke me to the Shores: The silent medowes seeme delighted with my Layes, As sitting in my Boate I sing my Lasses praise, Then let them that like, the Forrester up cry, Your noble Fisher is your only man say I. This Speech of Halcius turn'd the Tyde, And brought it so about, That all upon the Fisher cryde, That he would beare it out; Him for the speech he made, to clap Who lent him not a hand, And said t'would be the Waters hap, Quite to put downe the Land. This while Melanthus silent sits, (For so the Shepheard hight) And having heard these dainty wits, Each pleading for his right; To heare them honor'd in this wise, His patience doth provoke, When for a Shepheard roome he cryes, And for himselfe thus spoke. Melanthus. Well Fisher you have done, &amp; Forrester for you Your Tale is neatly tould, s'are both, to give you due, And now my turne comes next, then heare a Shepherd speak: My watchfulnesse and care gives day scarce leave to break, But to the Fields I haste, my folded flock to see, Where when I finde, nor Woolfe, nor Fox, hath injur'd me, I to my Bottle straight, and soundly baste my Throat, Which done, some Country Song or Roundelay I roate So merrily; that to the musick that I make, I Force the Larke to sing ere she be well awake; Then Baull my cut-tayld Curre and I begin to play, He o'r my Shephooke leapes, now th'one, now th'other way, Then on his hinder feet he doth himselfe advance, I tune, and to my note, my lively Dog doth dance, Then whistle in my Fist, my fellow Swaynes to call, Downe goe our Hooks and Scrips, and we to Nine-holes fall, At Dust-point, or at Quoyts, else are we at it hard, All false and cheating Games, we Shepheards are debard; Survaying of my sheepe if Ewe or Wether looke As though it were amisse, or with my Curre, or Crooke I take it, and when once I finde what it doth ayle, It hardly hath that hurt, but that my skill can heale; And when my carefull eye, I cast upon my sheepe I sort them in my Pens, and sorted soe I keepe: Those that are bigst of Boane, I still reserve for breed, My Cullings I put off, or for the Chapman feed. When the Evening doth approach I to my Bagpipe take, And to my Grazing flocks such Musick then I make, That they forbeare to feed; then me a King you see, I playing goe before, my Subjects followe me, My Bell-weather most brave, before the rest doth stalke, The Father of the flocke, and after him doth walke My writhen-headed Ram, with Posyes crownd in pride Fast to his crooked hornes with Rybands neatly ty'd. And at our Shepheards Board that's cut out of the ground, My fellow Swaynes and I together at it round, With Greencheese, clouted Cream, with Flawns, &amp; Custards, stord, Whig, Sider, and with Whey, I domineer a Lord, When shering time is come I to the River drive, My goodly well-fleec'd Flocks: (by pleasure thus I thrive) Which being washt at will; upon the shering day, My wooll I foorth in Loaks, fit for the wynder lay, Which upon lusty heapes into my Coate I heave, That in the Handling feeles as soft as any Sleave, When every Ewe two Lambes, that yeaned hath that yeare, About her new shorne neck a Chaplet then doth weare; My Tarboxe, and my Scrip, my Bagpipe, at my back, My sheephooke in my hand, what can I say I lacke; He that a Scepter swayd, a sheephooke in his hand, Hath not disdaind to have; for Shepheards then I stand; Then Forester and you my Fisher cease your strife; I say your Shepheard leads your onely merry life. They had not cryd the Forester, And Fisher up before, So much: but now the Nimphes preferre, The Shephard ten tymes more, And all the Ging goes on his side, Their Minion him they make, To him themselves they all apply, And all his partie take; Till some in their discretion cast, Since first the strife begunne In all that from them there had past None absolutly wonne; That equall honour they should share; And their deserts to showe, For each a Garland they prepare, Which they on them bestowe, Of all the choisest flowers that weare, Which purposly they gather, With which they Crowne them, parting there, As they came first together. THE SEVENTH NIMPHALL. Florimel Lelipa Naiis Codrus a Feriman. The Nimphes, the Queene of love pursue, Which oft doth hide her from their view: But lastly from th'Elizian Nation, She banisht is by Proclamation. Florimel. Deare Lelipa, where hast thou bin so long, Was't not enough for thee to doe me wrong; To rob me of thy selfe, but with more spight To take my Naiis from me, my delight? Yee lazie Girles, your heads where have ye layd, Whil'st Venus here her anticke prankes hath playd? Lelipa. Nay Florimel, we should of you enquire, The onely Mayden, whom we all admire For Beauty, Wit, and Chastity, that you Amongst the rest of all our Virgin crue, In quest of her, that you so slacke should be, And leave the charge to Naiis and to me. Florimel. Y'are much mistaken Lelipa, 'twas I, Of all the Nimphes, that first did her descry, At our great Hunting, when as in the Chase Amongst the rest, me thought I saw one face So exceeding faire, and curious, yet unknowne That I that face not possibly could owne. And in the course, so Goddesse like a gate, Each step so full of majesty and state; That with my selfe, I thus resolv'd that she Lesse then a Goddesse (surely) could not be: Thus as Idalia, stedfastly I ey'd, A little Nimphe that kept close by her side I noted, as unknowne as was the other, Which Cupid was disguis'd so by his mother. The little purblinde Rogue, if you had seene, You would have thought he verily had beene One of Diana's Votaries, so clad, He every thing so like a Huntresse had: And she had put false eyes into his head, That very well he might us all have sped. And still they kept together in the Reare, But as the Boy should have shot at the Deare, He shot amongst the Nimphes, which when I saw, Closer up to them I began to draw; And fell to hearken, when they naught suspecting, Because I seem'd them utterly neglecting, I heard her say, my little Cupid too't, Now Boy or never, at the Bevie shoot. Have at them Venus, quoth the Boy anon, I'le pierce the proud'st, had she a heart of stone: With that I cryde out, Treason, Treason, when The Nimphes that were before, turning agen To understand the meaning of this cry, They out of sight were vanish't presently. Thus but for me, the Mother and the Sonne, Here in Elizium, had us all undone. Naiis. Beleeve me gentle Maide, 'twas very well, But now heare me my beauteous Florimel. Great Mars his Lemman being cryde out here, She to Felicia goes, still to be neare Th'Elizian Nimphes, for at us is her ayme, The fond Felicians are her common game. I upon pleasure idly wandring thither, Something worth laughter from those fooles to gather, Found her, who thus had lately beene surpriz'd; Fearing the like, had her faire selfe disguis'd Like an old Witch, and gave out to have skill In telling Fortunes either good or ill; And that more neatly she with them might close, She cut the Cornes, of dainty Ladies Toes: She gave them Phisicke, either to coole or moove them, And powders too to make their sweet Hearts love them. And her sonne Cupid, as her Zany went, Carrying her boxes, whom she often sent To know of her faire Patients how they slept. By which meanes she, and the blinde Archer crept Into their favours, who would often Toy, And tooke delight in sporting with the Boy; Which many times amongst his waggish tricks, These wanton Wenches in the bosome pricks; That they before which had some franticke fits, Were by his Witchcraft quite out of their wits. Watching this Wisard, my minde gave me still She some Impostor was, and that this skill Was counterfeit, and had some other end. For which discovery, as I did attend, Her wrinckled vizard being very thin, My piercing eye perceiv'd her cleerer skin Through the thicke Rivels perfectly to shine; When I perceiv'd a beauty so divine, As that so clouded, I began to pry A little nearer, when I chanc't to spye That pretty Mole upon her Cheeke, which when I saw; survaying every part agen, Upon her left hand, I perceiv'd the skarre Which she received in the Trojan warre; Which when I found, I could not chuse but smile, She, who againe had noted me the while, And by my carriage, found I had descry'd her, Slipt out of sight, and presently doth hide her. Lelipa. Nay then my dainty Girles, I make no doubt But I my selfe as strangely found her out As either of you both; in Field and Towne, When like a Pedlar she went up and downe: For she had got a pretty handsome Packe, Which she had fardled neatly at her backe: And opening it, she had the perfect cry, Come my faire Girles, let's see, what will you buy? Here be fine night Maskes, plastred well within, To supple wrinckles, and to smooth the skin: Heer's Christall, Corall, Bugle, Jet, in Beads, Cornelian Bracelets, for my dainty Maids: Then Periwigs and Searcloth-Gloves doth show, To make their hands as white as Swan or Snow: Then takes she forth a curious gilded boxe, Which was not opened but by double locks; Takes them aside, and doth a Paper spred, In which was painting both for white and red: And next a piece of Silke, wherein there lyes For the decay'd, false Breasts, false Teeth, false Eyes: And all the while shee's opening of her Packe, Cupid with's wings bound close downe to his backe: Playing the Tumbler on a Table gets, And shewes the Ladies many pretty feats. I seeing behinde him that he had such things, For well I knew no boy but he had wings, I view'd his Mothers beauty, which to me Lesse then a Goddesse said, she could not be: With that quoth I to her, this other day, As you doe now, so one that came this way, Shew'd me a neate piece, with the needle wrought, How Mars and Venus were together caught By polt-foot Vulcan in an Iron net; It griev'd me after that I chanc't to let, It to goe from me: whereat waxing red, Into her Hamper she hung downe her head, As she had stoup't some noveltie to seeke, But 'twas indeed to hide her blushing Cheeke: When she her Trinkets trusseth up anon, E'r we were 'ware, and instantly was gone. Florimel. But hearke you Nimphes, amongst our idle prate, Tis current newes through the Elizian State, That Venus and her Sonne were lately seene Here in Elizium, whence they oft have beene Banisht by our Edict, and yet still merry, Were here in publique row'd o'r at the Ferry, Where as 'tis said, the Ferryman and she Had much discourse, she was so full of glee, Codrus much wondring at the blind Boyes Bow. Naiis. And what it was, that easly you may know, Codrus himselfe comes rowing here at hand. Lelipa. Codrus Come hither, let your Whirry stand, I hope upon you, ye will take no state Because two Gods have grac't your Boat of late; Good Ferry-man I pray thee let us heare What talke ye had, aboard thee whilst they were. Codrus. Why thus faire Nimphes. As I a Fare had lately past, And thought that side to ply, I heard one as it were in haste; A Boate, a Boate, to cry, Which as I was about to bring, And came to view my Fraught, Thought I, what more then heavenly thing, Hath fortune hither brought. She seeing mine eyes still on her were, Soone, smilingly, quoth she; Sirra, looke to your Roother there, Why lookst thou thus at me? And nimbly stept into my Boat, With her a little Lad Naked and blind, yet did I note, That Bow and Shafts he had, And two Wings to his Shoulders fixt, Which stood like little Sayles, With farre more various colours mixt, Then be your Peacocks Tayles; I seeing this little dapper Elfe, Such Armes as these to beare, Quoth I thus softly to my selfe, What strange thing have we here, I never saw the like thought I: Tis more then strange to me, To have a child have wings to fly, And yet want eyes to see; Sure this is some devised toy, Or it transform'd hath bin, For such a thing, halfe Bird, halfe Boy, I thinke was never seene; And in my Boat I turnd about, And wistly viewd the Lad, And cleerely saw his eyes were out, Though Bow and Shafts he had. As wistly she did me behold, How likst thou him quoth she, Why well, quoth I; and better should, Had he but eyes to see. How sayst thou honest friend, quoth she, Wilt thou a Prentice take, I thinke in time, though blind he be, A Ferry-man hee'll make; To guide my passage Boat quoth I, His fine hands were not made, He hath beene bred too wantonly To undertake my trade; Why helpe him to a Master then, Quoth she, such Youths be scant, It cannot be but there be men That such a Boy do want. Quoth I, when you your best have done, No better way you'll finde, Then to a Harper binde your Sonne, Since most of them are blind. The lovely Mother and the Boy, Laught heartily thereat, As at some nimble jest or toy, To heare my homely Chat. Quoth I, I pray you let me know, Came he thus first to light, Or by some sicknesse, hurt, or blow, Depryved of his sight; Nay sure, quoth she, he thus was borne, Tis strange borne blind, quoth I, I feare you put this as a scorne On my simplicity; Quoth she, thus blind I did him beare, Quoth I, if't be no lye, Then he's the first blind man Ile sweare, Ere practisd Archery; A man, quoth she, nay there you misse, He's still a Boy as now, Nor to be elder then he is, The Gods will him alow; To be no elder then he is, Then sure he is some sprite I straight replide, againe at this, The Goddesse laught out right; It is a mystery to me, An Archer and yet blinde; Quoth I againe, how can it be, That he his marke should finde; The Gods, quoth she, whose will it was That he should want his sight, That he in something should surpasse, To recompence their spight, Gave him this gift, though at his Game He still shot in the darke, That he should have so certaine ayme, As not to misse his marke. By this time we were come a shore, When me my Fare she payd, But not a word she uttered more, Nor had I her bewrayd, Of Venus nor of Cupid I Before did never heare, But that a Fisher comming by Then, told me who they were. Florimel. Well: against them then proceed As before we have decreed, That the Goddesse and her Child, Be for ever hence exild, Which Lelipa you shall proclaime In our wise Apollo's name. Lelipa. To all th'Elizian Nimphish Nation, Thus we make our Proclamation, Against Venus and her Sonne For the mischeefe they have done, After the next last of May, The fixt and peremtory day, If she or Cupid shall be found Upon our Elizian ground, Our Edict, meere Rogues shall make them, And as such, who ere shall take them, Them shall into prison put, Cupids wings shall then be cut, His Bow broken, and his Arrowes Given to Boyes to shoot at Sparrowes, And this Vagabund be sent, Having had due punishment To mount Cytheron, which first fed him: Where his wanton Mother bred him, And there out of her protection Dayly to receive correction; Then her Pasport shall be made, And to Cyprus Isle convayd, And at Paphos in her Shryne, Where she hath beene held divine, For her offences found contrite, There to live an Anchorite. THE EIGHT NIMPHALL. Mertilla Claia Cloris. A Nimph is marryed to a Fay, Great preparations for the Day, All Rites of Nuptials they recite you To the Brydall and invite you. Mertilla. But will our Tita wed this Fay? Claia. Yea, and to morrow is the day. Mertilla. But why should she bestow her selfe Upon this dwarfish Fayry Elfe? Claia. Why by her smalnesse you may finde, That she is of the Fayry kinde, And therefore apt to chuse her make Whence she did her begining take: Besides he's deft and wondrous Ayrye, And of the noblest of the Fayry, Chiefe of the Crickets of much fame, In Fayry a most ancient name. But to be briefe, 'tis cleerely done, The pretty wench is woo'd and wonne. Cloris. If this be so, let us provide The Ornaments to fit our Bryde, For they knowing she doth come From us in Elizium, Queene Mab will looke she should be drest In those attyres we thinke our best, Therefore some curious things lets give her, E'r to her Spouse we her deliver. Mertilla. Ile have a Jewell for her eare, (Which for my sake Ile have her weare) 'T shall be a Dewdrop, and therein Of Cupids I will have a twinne, Which strugling, with their wings shall break The Bubble, out of which shall leak So sweet a liquor as shall move Each thing that smels, to be in love. Claia. Beleeve me Gerle, this will be fine, And to this Pendant, then take mine; A Cup in fashion of a Fly, Of the Linxes piercing eye, Wherein there sticks a Sunny Ray Shot in through the cleerest day, Whose brightnesse Venus selfe did move, Therein to put her drinke of Love, Which for more strength she did distill, The Limbeck was a Phœnix quill, At this Cups delicious brinke, A Fly approaching but to drinke, Like Amber or some precious Gumme It transparant doth become. Cloris. For Jewels for her eares she's sped, But for a dressing for her head I thinke for her I have a Tyer, That all Fayryes shall admyre, The yellowes in the full-blowne Rose, Which in the Top it doth inclose Like drops of gold Oare shall be hung, Upon her Tresses, and among Those scattered seeds (the eye to please) The wings of the Cantharides: With some o'th'Raine-bow that doth raile Those Moons in, in the Peacocks taile: Whose dainty colours being mixt With th'other beauties, and so fixt, Her lovely Tresses shall appeare, As though upon a flame they were. And to be sure she shall be gay, Wee'll take those feathers from the Jay; About her eyes in Circlets set, To be our Tita's Coronet. Mertilla. Then dainty Girles I make no doubt, But we shall neatly send her out: But let's amongst our selves agree, Of what her wedding Gowne shall be. Claia. Of Pansie, Pincke, and Primrose leaves, Most curiously laid on in Threaves: And all embroydery to supply, Powthred with flowers of Rosemary: A trayle about the skirt shall runne, The Silke-wormes finest, newly spunne; And every Seame the Nimphs shall sew With th'smallest of the Spinners Clue: And having done their worke, againe These to the Church shall beare her Traine: Which for our Tita we will make Of the cast slough of a Snake, Which quivering as the winde doth blow, The Sunne shall it like Tinsell shew. Cloris. And being led to meet her mate, To make sure that she want no state, Moones from the Peacockes tayle wee'll shred, With feathers from the Pheasants head: Mixd with the plume of (so high price,) The precious bird of Paradice. Which to make up, our Nimphes shall ply Into a curious Canopy, Borne o're her head (by our enquiry) By Elfes, the fittest of the Faery. Mertilla. But all this while we have forgot Her Buskins, neighbours, have we not? Claia. We had, for those I'le fit her now, They shall be of the Lady-Cow: The dainty shell upon her backe Of Crimson strew'd with spots of blacke; Which as she holds a stately pace, Her Leg will wonderfully grace. Cloris. But then for musicke of the best, This must be thought on for the Feast. Mertilla. The Nightingale of birds most choyce, To doe her best shall straine her voyce; And to this bird to make a Set, The Mavis, Merle, and Robinet; The Larke, the Lennet, and the Thrush, That make a Quier of every Bush. But for still musicke, we will keepe The Wren, and Titmouse, which to sleepe Shall sing the Bride, when shee's alone The rest into their chambers gone. And like those upon Ropes that walke On Gossimer, from staulke to staulke, The tripping Fayry tricks shall play The evening of the wedding day. Claia. But for the Bride-bed, what were fit, That hath not beene talk'd of yet. Cloris. Of leaves of Roses white and red, Shall be the Covering of her bed: The Curtaines, Valence, Tester, all, Shall be the flower Imperiall, And for the Fringe, it all along With azure Harebels shall be hung: Of Lillies shall the Pillowes be, With downe stuft of the Butterflee. Mertilla. Thus farre we handsomely have gone, Now for our Prothalamion Or Marriage song of all the rest, A thing that much must grace our feast. Let us practise then to sing it, Ere we before th'assembly bring it: We in Dialogues must doe it, Then my dainty Girles set to it. Claia. This day must Tita marryed be, Come Nimphs this nuptiall let us see. Mertilla. But is it certaine that ye say, Will she wed the noble Faye? Cloris. Sprinckle the dainty flowers with dewes, Such as the Gods at Banquets use: Let Hearbs and Weeds turne all to Roses, And make proud the posts with posies: Shute your sweets into the ayre, Charge the morning to be fayre. Claia. Mertilla. For our Tita is this day, To be married to a Faye. Claia. By whom then shall our Bride be led To the Temple to be wed. Mertilla. Onely by your selfe and I, Who that roomth should else supply? Cloris. Come bright Girles, come altogether, And bring all your offrings hither, Ye most brave and Buxome Bevye, All your goodly graces Levye, Come in Majestie and state Our Brydall here to celebrate. Mertilla. Claia. For our Tita is this day, Married to a noble Faye. Claia. Whose lot wilt be the way to strow, On which to Church our Bride must goe? Mertilla. That I thinke as fit'st of all, To lively Lelipa will fall. Cloris. Summon all the sweets that are, To this nuptiall to repayre; Till with their throngs themselves they smother, Strongly styfling one another; And at last they all consume, And vanish in one rich perfume. Mertilla. Claia. For our Tita is this day, Married to a noble Faye. Mertilla. By whom must Tita married be, 'Tis fit we all to that should see? Claia. The Priest he purposely doth come, Th'Arch Flamyne of Elizium. Cloris. With Tapers let the Temples shine, Sing to Himen, Hymnes divine: Load the Altars till there rise Clouds from the burnt sacrifice; With your Sensors sling aloofe Their smels, till they ascend the Roofe. Mertilla. Claia. For our Tita is this day, Married to a noble Fay. Mertilla. But comming backe when she is wed, Who breakes the Cake above her head. Claia. That shall Mertilla, for shee's tallest, And our Tita is the smallest. Cloris Violins, strike up aloud, Ply the Gitterne, scowre the Crowd, Let the nimble hand belabour The whisteling Pipe, and drumbling Taber: To the full the Bagpipe racke, Till the swelling leather cracke. Mertilla. Claia. For our Tita is this day, Married to a noble Fay. Claia. But when to dyne she takes her seate What shall be our Tita's meate? Mertilla. The Gods this Feast, as to begin, Have sent of their Ambrosia in. Cloris. Then serve we up the strawes rich berry, The Respas, and Elizian Cherry: The virgin honey from the flowers In Hibla, wrought in Flora's Bowers: Full Bowles of Nectar, and no Girle Carouse but in dissolved Pearle. Mertilla. Claia. For our Tita is this day, Married to a noble Fay. Claia. But when night comes, and she must goe To Bed, deare Nimphes what must we doe? Mertilla. In the Posset must be brought, And Poynts be from the Bridegroome caught. Cloris. In Maskes, in Dances, and delight, And reare Banquets spend the night: Then about the Roome we ramble, Scatter Nuts, and for them scamble: Over Stooles, and Tables tumble, Never thinke of noyse nor rumble. Mertilla. Claia. For our Tita is this day, Married to a noble Fay. THE NINTH NIMPHALL. Muses and Nimphs. The Muses spend their lofty layes, Upon Apollo and his prayse; The Nimphs with Gems his Alter build, This Nimphall is with Phœbus fild. A Temple of exceeding state, The Nimphes and Muses rearing, Which they to Phœbus dedicate, Elizium ever cheering: These Muses, and those Nimphes contend This Phane to Phœbus offring, Which side the other should transcend, These praise, those prizes proffering, And at this long appointed day, Each one their largesse bringing, Those nine faire Sisters led the way Thus to Apollo singing. The Muses. Thou youthfull God that guid'st the howres, The Muses thus implore thee, By all those Names, due to thy powers, By which we still adore thee. Sol, Tytan, Delius, Cynthius, styles, Much reverence that have wonne thee, Deriv'd from Mountaines as from Iles Where worship first was done thee. Rich Delos brought thee forth divine, Thy Mother thither driven, At Delphos thy most sacred shrine, Thy Oracles were given. In thy swift course from East to West, They minutes misse to finde thee, That bear'st the morning on thy breast, And leav'st the night behinde thee. Up to Olimpus top so steepe, Thy startling Coursers currying; Thence downe to Neptunes vasty deepe, Thy flaming Charriot hurrying. The horses drawing the Chariot of the Sunne. Eos, Ethon, Phlegon, Pirois, proud, Their lightning Maynes advancing: Breathing forth fire on every cloud Upon their Journey prancing. Whose sparkling hoofes, with gold for speed Are shod, to scape all dangers, Where they upon Ambrosia feed, In their celestiall Mangers. Bright Colatina, that of hils Is Goddesse, and hath keeping Her Nimphes, the cleere Oreades wils T'attend thee from thy sleeping. The Mountaines first saluting the Sunne at his rising. Great Supposed the God of earth. One of the Judges of hell. Demogorgon feeles thy might, His Mynes about him heating: Who through his bosome dart'st thy light, Within the Center sweating. If thou but touch thy golden Lyre, Thou Minos mov'st to heare thee: The Rockes feele in themselves afire, And rise up to come neere thee. 'Tis thou that Physicke didst devise Hearbs by their natures calling: Of which some opening at thy Rise, And closing at thy falling. Fayre Hyacinth thy most lov'd Lad, That with the sledge thou sluest; Hath in a flower the life he had, Whose root thou still renewest, Thy Daphne thy beloved Tree, A Nimph lov'd of Apollo, and by him changed into a flower. That scornes thy Fathers Thunder, And thy deare Clitia yet we see, Not time from thee can sunder; From thy bright Bow that Arrow flew (Snatcht from thy golden Quiver) Which that fell Serpent Python slew, Playes or Games in honor of Apollo.Renowning thee for ever. The Actian and the Pythian Games Devised were to praise thee, With all th'Apolinary names That th'Ancients thought could raise thee. A Shryne upon this Mountaine hie, To thee we'll have erected, Which thou the God of Poesie Must care to have protected: With thy lov'd Cinthus that shall share, With all his shady Bowers, Nor Licia's Cragus shall compare With this, for thee, of ours. Thus having sung, the Nimphish Crue Thrust in amongst them thronging, Desiring they might have the due That was to them belonging. Quoth they, ye Muses, as divine, Are in his glories graced, But it is we must build the Shryne Wherein they must be placed; Which of those precious Gemmes we'll make That Nature can affoord us, Which from that plenty we will take, Wherewith we here have stor'd us: O glorious Phœbus most divine, Thine Altars then we hallow: And with those stones we build a Shryne To thee our wise Apollo. The Nimphes. No Gem, from Rocks, Seas, running streames, (Their numbers let us muster) But hath from thy most powerfull beames The Vertue and the Lustre; The Diamond, the king of Gemmes, The first is to be placed, That glory is of Diadems, Them gracing, by them graced: In whom thy power the most is seene, The raging fire refelling: The Emerauld then, most deepely greene, For beauty most excelling, Resisting poyson often prov'd By those about that beare it. The cheerfull Ruby then, much lov'd, That doth revive the spirit, Whose kinde to large extensure growne The colour so enflamed, Is that admired mighty stone The Carbunckle that's named, Which from it such a flaming light And radiency ejecteth, That in the very dark'st of night The eye to it directeth. The yellow Jacynth, strengthning Sense, Of which who hath the keeping, No Thunder hurts nor Pestilence, And much provoketh sleeping: The Chrisolite, that doth resist Thirst, proved, never failing, The purple colored Amatist, 'Gainst strength of wine prevailing; The verdant gay greene Smaragdus, Most soveraine over passion: The Sardonix, approv'd by us To master Incantation. Then that celestiall colored stone The Saphyre, heavenly wholly, Which worne, there wearinesse is none, And cureth melancholly: The Lazulus, whose pleasant blew With golden vaines is graced; The Jaspis, of so various hew, Amongst our other placed; The Onix, from the Ancients brought, Of wondrous Estimation, Shall in amongst the rest be wrought Our sacred Shryne to fashion; The Topas, we'll stick here and there, And sea-greene colored Berill, And Turkesse, which who haps to beare Is often kept from perill. The Selenite, of Cynthia's light, So nam'd, with her still ranging, Which as she wanes or waxeth bright Its colours so are changing. With Opalls, more then any one, We'll deck thine Altar fuller, For that of every precious stone, It doth reteine some colour: With bunches of Pearle Paragon Thine Altar underpropping, Whose base is the Cornelian, Strong bleeding often stopping: With th'Agot, very oft that is Cut strangely in the Quarry, As Nature ment to show in this, How she her selfe can varry: With worlds of Gems from Mines and Seas Elizium well might store us, But we content our selves with these That readiest lye before us: And thus O Phœbus most divine Thine Altars still we hallow, And to thy Godhead reare this Shryne, Our onely wise Apollo. THE TENTH NIMPHALL. Naiis Claia Corbilus Satyre. A Satyre on Elizium lights, Whose ugly shape the Nimphes affrights, Yet when they heare his just complaint, They make him an Elizian Saint. Corbilus. What; breathles Nimphs? bright Virgins let me know What suddaine cause constraines ye to this haste? What have ye seene that should affright ye so? What might it be from which ye flye so fast? I see your faces full of pallid feare, As though some perill followed on your flight; Take breath a while, and quickly let me heare Into what danger ye have lately light. Naiis. Never were poore distressed Gerles so glad, As when kinde, loved Corbilus we saw, When our much haste us so much weakned had, That scarcely we our wearied breathes could draw. In this next Grove under an aged Tree, So fell a monster lying there we found, As till this day, our eyes did never see, Nor ever came on the Elizian ground. Halfe man, halfe Goat, he seem'd to us in show, His upper parts our humane shape doth beare, But he's a very perfect Goat below, His crooked Cambrils arm'd with hoofe and hayre. Claia. Through his leane Chops a chattering he doth make Which stirres his staring beastly driveld Beard, And his sharpe hornes he seem'd at us to shake, Canst thou then blame us though we were afeard. Corbilus. Surely it seemes some Satyre this should be, Come and goe back and guide me to the place, Be not affraid, ye are safe enough with me, Silly and harmelesse be their Silvan Race. Claia. How Corbilus; a Satyre doe you say? How should he over high Parnassus hit? Since to these Fields ther's none can finde the way, But onely those the Muses will permit. Corbilus. Tis true; but oft, the sacred Sisters grace The silly Satyre, by whose plainesse, they Are taught the worlds enormities to trace, By beastly mens abhominable way; Besyde he may be banisht his owne home By this base time, or be so much distrest, That he the craggy by-clift Hill hath clome To finde out these more pleasant Fields of rest. Naiis. Yonder he sits, and seemes himselfe to bow At our approch, what doth our presence awe him? Me thinks he seemes not halfe so ugly now, As at the first, when I and Claia saw him. Corbilus. Tis an old Satyre, Nimph, I now discerne, Sadly he sits, as he were sick or lame, His lookes would say, that we may easly learne How, and from whence, he to Elizium came. Satyre, these Fields, how cam'st thou first to finde? What Fate first show'd thee this most happy shore? When never any of thy Silvan kinde Set foot on the Elizian earth before? Satyre. O never aske, how I came to this place, What cannot strong necessity finde out? Rather bemoane my miserable case, Constrain'd to wander the wide world about. With wild Silvanus and his woody crue, In Forrests I, at liberty and free, Liv'd in such pleasure as the world ne'r knew, Nor any rightly can conceive but we. This jocond life we many a day enjoy'd, Till this last age, those beastly men forth brought, That all those great and goodly Woods destroy'd, Whose growth their Grandsyres, with such sufferance sought, That faire Felicia which was but of late, Earth's Paradice, that never had her Peere, Stands now in that most lamentable state, That not a Silvan will inhabit there; Where in the soft and most delicious shade, In heat of Summer we were wont to play, When the long day too short for us we made, The slyding houres so slyly stole away; By Cynthia's light, and on the pleasant Lawne, The wanton Fayry we were wont to chase, Which to the nimble cloven-footed Fawne, Upon the plaine durst boldly bid the base. The sportive Nimphes, with shouts and laughter shooke The Hils and Valleyes in their wanton play, Waking the Ecchoes, their last words that tooke, Till at the last, they lowder were then they. The lofty hie Wood, and the lower spring, Sheltring the Deare, in many a suddaine shower; Where Quires of Birds, oft wonted were to sing, The flaming Furnace wholly doth devoure; Once faire Felicia, but now quite defac'd, Those Braveries gone wherein she did abound, With dainty Groves, when she was highly grac'd With goodly Oake, Ashe, Elme, and Beeches croun'd: But that from heaven their judgement blinded is, In humane Reason it could never be, But that they might have cleerly seene by this, Those plagues their next posterity shall see. The little Infant on the mothers Lap For want of fire shall be so sore distrest, That whilst it drawes the lanke and empty Pap, The tender lips shall freese unto the breast; The quaking Cattle which their Warmstall want, And with bleake winters Northerne winde opprest, Their Browse and Stover waxing thin and scant, The hungry Crowes shall with their Caryon feast. Men wanting Timber wherewith they should build, And not a Forrest in Felicia found, Shall be enforc'd upon the open Field, To dig them Caves for houses in the ground: The Land thus rob'd, of all her rich Attyre, Naked and bare her selfe to heaven doth show, Begging from thence that Jove would dart his fire Upon those wretches that disrob'd her so; This beastly Brood by no meanes may abide The name of their brave Ancestors to heare, By whom their sordid slavery is descry'd, So unlike them as though not theirs they were, Nor yet they sense, nor understanding have, Of those brave Muses that their Country song, But with false Lips ignobly doe deprave The right and honour that to them belong; This cruell kinde thus Viper-like devoure That fruitfull soyle which them too fully fed; The earth doth curse the Age, and every houre Againe, that it these viprous monsters bred. I seeing the plagues that shortly are to come Upon this people cleerely them forsooke: And thus am light into Elizium, To whose straite search I wholly me betooke. Naiis. Poore silly creature, come along with us, Thou shalt be free of the Elizian fields: Be not dismaid, nor inly grieved thus, This place content in all abundance yeelds. We to the cheerefull presence will thee bring, Of Joves deare Daughters, where in shades they sit, Where thou shalt heare those sacred Sisters sing, Most heavenly Hymnes, the strength and life of wit. Claia. Where to the Delphian God upon their Lyres His Priests seeme ravisht in his height of praise: Whilst he is crowning his harmonious Quiers, With circling Garlands of immortall Bayes. Corbilus. Here live in blisse, till thou shalt see those slaves, Who thus set vertue and desert at nought: Some sacrific'd upon their Grandsires graves, And some like beasts in markets sold and bought. Of fooles and madmen leave thou then the care, That have no understanding of their state: For whom high heaven doth so just plagues prepare, That they to pitty shall convert thy hate. And to Elizium be thou welcome then, Untill those base Felicians thou shalt heare, By that vile nation captived againe, That many a glorious age their captives were. NOAHS FLOUD. To the Right Noble, Religious, and truely vertuous Lady, Mary, Countesse of Dorset; worthy of all Titles and Attributes, that were ever given to the most Renowned of her Sexe: and of me most deservedly to be honoured. To her Fame and Memory I consecrate these my divine Poems, with all the wishes of a gratefull heart; for the preservation of her, and her Children, the Succeeding Hopes of the Ancient and Noble Family of the Sackviles. Her Servant, Michael Drayton. Eternall and all-working God, which wast Before the world, whose frame by thee was cast, And beautifi'd with beamefull lampes above, By thy great wisedome set how they should move To guide the seasons, equally to all, Which come and goe as they doe rise and fall. My mighty Maker, O doe thou infuse Such life and spirit into my labouring Muse, That I may sing (what but from Noah thou hid'st) The greatest thing that ever yet thou didst Since the Creation; that the world may see The Muse is heavenly, and deriv'd from thee. A Jove Musa. O let thy glorious Angell which since kept That gorgeous Eden, where once Adam slept; When tempting Eve was taken from his side, Let him great God not onely be my guide, But with his fiery Faucheon still be nie, To keepe affliction farre from me, that I With a free soule thy wondrous workes may show, Then like that Deluge shall my numbers flow, Telling the state wherein the earth then stood, The Gyant race, the universall floud. The fruitfull earth being lusty then and strong, Like to a Woman, fit for love, and young, Brought forth her creatures mighty, not a thing Issu'd from her, but a continuall spring Had to increase it, and to make it flourish, For in her selfe she had that power to nourish Her Procreation, that her children then Were at the instant of their birth, halfe men. Men then begot so soone, and got so long, That scarcely one a thousand men among, But he ten thousand in his time might see, That from his loynes deriv'd their Pedegree. The full-womb'd Women, very hardly went Out their nine months, abundant nature lent Their fruit such thriving, as that once waxt quicke, The large-limb'd mother, neither faint nor sicke, Hasted her houre by her abundant health, Nature so plaid the unthrift with her wealth, So prodigally lavishing her store Upon the teeming earth, then wasting more The fruitfulnesse and bravery of the earth before the Floud.Then it had need of: not the smallest weed Knowne in that first age, but the naturall seed Made it a Plant, to these now since the Floud, So that each Garden look'd then like a Wood: Beside, in Med'cen, simples had that power, That none need then the Planetary houre To helpe their working, they so juycefull were. The Winter and the Spring time of the yeare Seem'd all one season: that most stately tree Of Libanus, which many times we see Mention'd for talenesse in the holy Writ, Whose tops the clouds oft in their wandring hit, Were shrubs to those then on the earth that grew; Nor the most sturdy storme that ever blew Their big-growne bodies, to the earth ere shooke, Their mighty Rootes, so certaine fastening tooke; Cover'd with grasse, more soft then any silke, The Trees dropt honey, &amp; the Springs gusht milke: The Flower-fleec't Meadow, &amp; the gorgeous grove, Which should smell sweetest in their bravery, strove; No little shrub, but it some Gum let fall, To make the cleere Ayre aromaticall: Whilst to the little Birds melodious straines, The trembling Rivers tript along the Plaines. Shades serv'd for houses, neither Heate nor Cold Troubl'd the yong, nor yet annoy'd the old: The batning earth all plenty did afford, And without tilling (of her owne accord) That living idly without taking paine (Like to the first) made every man a Caine. Seaven hundred yeeres, a mans age scarcely then, Of mighty size so were these long-liv'd men: The flesh of Lyons, and of Buls they tore, Whose skins those Gyants for their garments wore. Yet not tearm'd Gyants onely, for that they Excel'd men since, in bignesse every way: Nor that they were so puissant of their hand, But that the Race wherewith the earth was man'd, So wrathfull, proud, and tyranous were then, Not dreading God, nor yet respecting men; Josephus. For they knew neither Magistrate, nor law, Nor could conceive ought that their wils could awe; For which waxt proud, &amp; haughty in their thought, They set th'eternall living God at naught: Mankinde increasing greatly every day, Their sinnes increase in numbers more then they; Seaven Ages had past Adam, when men prone To tyranny, and no man knew his owne: His sensuall will then followed, and his lust, His onely law, in those times to be just Was to be wicked; God so quite forgot, As what was damn'd, that in that age was not. With one anothers flesh themselves they fil'd, And drunke the bloud of those whom they had kil'd. They dar'd to doe, what none should dare to name, They never heard of such a thing as shame. Berosus cited by Pirerius. Man mixt with man, and Daughter, Sister, Mother, Were to these wicked men as any other. To rip their womens wombes, they would not stick, When they perceiv'd once they were waxed quicke. Feeding on that, from their own loynes that sprong, Such wickednesse these Monsters was among: That they us'd Beasts, digressing from all kinde: That the Almighty pondring in his minde Their beastlinesse, (from his intent) began T'repent himselfe that he created man. Their sinnes ascending the Almighties seate, Th'eternall Throane with horror seeme to threat. Still daring God, a warre with them to make, And of his power, no knowledge seem'd to take. So that he vow'd, the world he would destroy, Which he revealed onely to just Noy. For but that man, none worthy was to know, Nor he the manner to none else would show. For since with starres, he first high heaven enchast, And Adam first in Paradice had plac't, Amongst all those inhabiting the ground, He not a man so just as Noe had found. For which he gave him charge an Arke to build, And by those workemen which were deepliest skild In Architecture, to begin the frame, And thus th'Almighty taught just Noe the same. The structure of the Arke.Three hundred cubits the full length to be, Fifty the bredth, the height (least of the three) Full thirty cubits: onely with one light, A cubit broad, and just so much in hight: And in three Stories bad him to divide The inner Roome, and in the Vessels side To place a doore; commanding Noe to take Great care thereof: and this his Arke to make Of Gopher wood, which some will needsly have To be the Pine-tree, and commandment gave That the large plancks whereof it was compos'd, When they by art should curiously be clos'd; Should with Bitumen both within and out Be deepely pitcht, the Vessell round about, So strong a Glue as could not off be worne, The rage of Winds, and Waters that doth scorne; Like to a Chest or Coffer it was fram'd, For which an Arke most fitly it was nam'd; Not like a Ship, for that a Ship below, Is ridg'd and narrow, upward but doth grow Wider and wider: but this mighty Barque, Built by just Noah, this universall Arke, Held one true breadth i'th'bottome as above, That when this Frame upon the Flood should move, On the falne waters it should float secure, As it did first the falling shower endure; And close above, so to beare out the weather For forty dayes when it should raine togeather. A hundred yeares the Arke in building was, So long the time ere he could bring to passe This worke intended; all which time just Noy Cry'd, that th'Almighty would the world destroy, And as this good man used many a day To walke abroad, his building to survay, These cruell Giants comming in to see, (In their thoughts wondring what this worke should be) He with erected hands to them doth cry, Either repent ye, or ye all must dye, Noah thretning Gods vengeance upon the world: with his sermon of repentance. Your blasphemies, your beastlinesse, your wrongs, Are heard to heaven, and with a thousand tongues Showt in the eares of the Almighty Lord; So that your sinnes no leasure him affoord To thinke on mercy, they so thickly throng, That when he would your punishment prolong, Their horror hales him on, that from remorce In his owne nature, you doe him inforce, Nay, wrest plagues from him, upon humane kinde Who else to mercy, wholly is inclinde. From Seth which God to Eva gave in lew Of her sonne Abel whom his brother slue, That cursed Cain, how hath th'Almighty blest, The seed of Adam though he so transgrest, In Enos by whose godlinesse men came, At first to call on the Almighties name, And Enoch, whose integritie was such, In whom the Lord delighted was so much, As in his yeers he suffered no decay, But God to Heaven tooke bodyly away; With long life blessing all that goodly Stem, From the first man downe to Mathusalem, Now from the loynes of Lamech sendeth me, (Unworthy his Ambassadour to be) To tell ye yet, if ye at last repent, He will lay by his wrathfull punishment, That God who was so mercifull before, To our forfathers, likewise hath in store, Mercy for us their Nephues, if we fall With teares before him, and he will recall, His wrath sent out already, therefore flye To him for mercy, yet the threatning Skie Pauses, ere it be the Deluge downe will poure, For every teare you shed, he'll stop a shower; Yet of th'Almighty mercy you may winne, He'll leave to punish, if you leave to sinne; That God eternall, which old Adam cast Out of the earthly heaven, where he had plac't, That first-made man, for his forbidden deed, From thence for ever banishing his seed, For us his sinfull children doth provide, And with abundance hath us still supplyd, And can his blessings who respects you thus, Make you most wicked, most rebellious: Still is your stubborne obstinacy such? Have ye no mercy, and your God so much? Your God, said I, O wherefore said I so? Your words deny him, and your works say no; O see the day, doth but too fast approch, Wherein heavens maker meanes to set abroach That world of water, which shall over-flow Those mighty Mountaines whereon now you goe, The Dropsied Clouds, see, your destruction threat, The Sunne and Moone both in their course are set To warre by water, and doe all they can To bring destruction upon sinfull man, And every thing shall suffer for your sake, For the whole earth shall be but one whole Lake; Oh cry for mercy, leave your wicked wayes, And God from time shall separate those dayes Of vengeance comming, and he shall disperse These Clouds now threatning the whole universe, And save the world, which else he will destroy. But this good man, this terror-preaching Noy, The Beares, and Tigers, might have taught aswell, They laught to heare this godly man to tell That God would drowne the world, they thought him mad, For their great maker they forgotten had, They knew none such, th'Almighty God say they, What might he be? and when shall be the day Thou talk'st of to us? canst thou thinke that we Can but suppose that such a thing can be? What can he doe that we cannot defeate? Whose Brawny Fists, to very dust can beate The solid'st Rock, and with our breasts can beare The strong'st Streame backward, dost thou thinke to feare Us with these Dreames of Deluges? to make Us our owne wayes and courses to forsake? Let us but see that God that dares to stand To what thou speak'st, that with his furious hand, Dare say he'll drowne us, and we will defye Him to his teeth: and if he keepe the Skye, We'll dare him thence, and if he then come downe, And challenge us that he the world will drowne, We'll follow him untill his threats he stints, Or we will batter his blew house with flynts. The Arke is finisht, and the Lord is wrath, To ayd just Noah, and he provided hath His blessed Angells, bidding them to bring, The Male and Female, of each living thing Into the Arke, by whom he had decreed T'renue the world, and by their fruitfull seed To fill it as before, and is precise For food for men, and for his sacrifice, That seaven just payres, of Birds, and Beasts that were Made cleane by him, should happily repayre To the great Arke, the other made uncleane, Of male and female onely should come twaine: Which by the Angels every where were sought, And thither by their ministry were brought. When Noah sets ope the Arke and doth begin To take his Fraught, his mighty Lading in And now the Beasts are walking from the wood, Aswell of Ravine, as that chew the Cud, The King of Beasts his fury doth suppresse, And to the Arke leads downe the Lionesse, The Bull for his beloved mate doth low, And to the Arke brings on the faire ey'd Cow; The stately Courser for his Mare doth nay, And t'wards the new Arke guideth her the way; The wreath'd-horn'd Ram his safety doth pursue, And to the Arke ushers his gentle Ewe; The brisly Boare, who with his snowte up plow'd The spacious Plaines, and with his grunting lowd, Rais'd ratling Ecchoes all the Woods about, Leaves his dark Den, and having sented out Noah's new-built Arke, in with his Sow doth come, And stye themselves up in a little roome: The Hart with his deare Hind, the Buck and Doe, Leaving their wildnesse, bring the tripping Roe Along with them: and from the Mountaine steepe, The clambring Goat, and Cony, us'd to keepe Amongst the Cleeves, together get, and they To this great Arke finde out the ready way; Th'unweildy Elke, whose skin is of much proofe, Throngs with the rest t'attaine this wooden roofe; The Unicorne leaves off his pride, and closse There sets him downe by the Rhinoceros: The Elephant there comming to imbarque, And as he softly getteth up the Ark, Feeling by his great waight, his body sunck, Holds by his huge Tooth, and his nervy Trunck; The croock-backt Camel climing to the deck, Drawes up himselfe with his long sinewy neck; The spotted Panther whose delicious scent, Oft causeth beasts his harbor to frequent, But having got them once into his power, Sucketh their blood, and doth their flesh devoure, His cruelty hath quickly cast aside, And waxing courteous, doth become their guide, And brings into this universall Shop The Ounce, the Tigar, and the Antilop, By the grim Woolfe, the poore Sheepe safely lay, And was his care, which lately was his pray; The Asse upon the Lyon leant his head, And to the Cat the Mouse for succour fled; The silly Hare doth cast aside her feare, And formes her selfe fast by the ugly Beare, At whom the watchfull Dog did never barke, When he espyde him clambring up the Arke: The Fox got in, his subtilties hath left, And as ashamed of his former theft, Sadly sits there, as though he did repent, And in the Arke became an innocent: The fine-furd Ermin, Martern, and the Cat That voydeth Civet, there together sat By the shrewd Muncky, Babian, and the Ape, With the Hienna, much their like in shape, Which by their kinde, are ever doing ill, Yet in the Arke, sit civilly and still; The skipping Squerrill of the Forrest free, That leapt so nimbly betwixt tree and tree, It selfe into the Arke then nimbly cast, As 'twere a Ship-boy come to clime the Mast. The Porcupine into the Arke doth make, Nor his sharpe quils though angry once doth shake; The sharpe-fang'd Beaver, whose wyde gaping Jaw Cutteth downe Plants at it were with a Saw, Whose body poysed, wayeth such a masse, As though his Bowels were of Lead or Brasse, His cruell Chaps though breathlesse he doth close, As with the rest into the Arke he goes. Th'uneven-leg'd Badger (whose eye-pleasing skin, The Case to many a curious thing hath bin, Since that great flood) his fortresses forsakes Wrought in the earth, and though but halting, makes Up to the Arke; the Otter then that keepes In the wild Rivers, in their Bancks and Sleeps, And feeds on Fish, which under water still, He with his keld feet, and keene teeth doth kill; The other two into the Arke doth follow, Though his ill shape doth cause him but to wallow; The Tortoyse and the Hedghog both so slow, As in their motion scarse discern'd to goe, Good footmen growne, contrary to their kinde, Lest from the rest they should be left behinde; The rooting Mole as to foretell the flood, Comes out of th'earth, and clambers up the wood; The little Dormouse leaves her leaden sleepe, And with the Mole up to the Arke doth creepe, With many other, which were common then, Their kinde decayd, but now unknowne to men, For there was none, that Adam ere did name, But to the Arke from every quarter came; By two and two the male and female beast, From th'swiftst to th'slowest, from greatest to the least, And as within the strong pale of a Parke, So were they altogether in the Arke. And as our God the Beasts had given in charge To take the Arke, themselves so to imbardge, He bids the Fowle, the Eagle in his flight, Cleaving the thin Ayre, on the deck doth light; Nor are his eyes so piercing to controule His lowly subjects the farre lesser Fowle, But the Almighty who all Creatures fram'd, And them by Adam in the Garden nam'd, Had given courage, fast by him to sit, Nor at his sharpe sight are amaz'd one whit; The Swanne by his great maker taught this good, T'avoyd the fury of the falling flood, His Boat-like breast, his wings rais'd for his sayle, And Ore-like feet, him nothing to avayle Against the Raine which likely was to fall, Each drop so great, that like a ponderous Mall, Might sinke him under water, and might drowne Him in the Deluge, with the Crane comes downe, Whose voyce the Trumpet is, that throw the Ayre Doth summon all the other to repayre To the new Arke: when with his mooned traine, The strutting Peacock yawling 'gainst the raine, Flutters into the Arke, by his shrill cry, Telling the rest the Tempest to be ny; The Iron-eating Estridge, whose bare Thyes Resembling mans, fearing the lowring Skyes, Walkes to the great Boat; when the crowned Cock, That to the Village lately was the Clock, Comes to rooste by him, with his Hen, foreshewing The shower should quickly fall, that then was brewing; The swift-wing'd Swallow feeding as it flyes, With the fleet Martlet thrilling throw the Skyes, As at their pastime sportivly they were, Feeling th'unusuall moisture of the Aer, Their feathers flag, into the Arke they come, As to some Rock or building, their owne home; The ayry Larke his Haleluiah sung, Finding a slacknesse seaze upon his tong, By the much moisture, and the Welkin darke, Drops with his female downe into the Arke; The soaring Kyte there scantled his large wings, And to the Arke the hovering Castrill brings; The Raven comes, and croking, in doth call The caryon Crow, and she againe doth brall, Foretelling raine; by these there likewise sat The Storke used to build upon houses, leaveth ever one behinde him for the owner. The carefull Storke, since Adam wondred at For thankfulnesse, to those where he doth breed, That his ag'd Parents naturally doth feed, In filiall duty as instructing man: By them there sate the loving Pellican, Whose yong ones poysned by the Serpents sting, With her owne blood to life againe doth bring: The constant Turtle up her lodging tooke By these good Birds; and in a little nooke The Nightingale with her melodious tongue Sadly there sits, as she had never sung; The Merle and Mavis on the highest spray, Who with their musick, wak't the early day, From the proud Cedars, to the Arke come downe, As though forewarn'd, that God the world would drowne; The prating Parret comes to them aboard, And is not heard to counterfeit a word; The Falcon and the Dove sit there together, And th'one of them doth prune the others feather; The Goshalke and the Feasant there doe twin, And in the Arke are pearcht upon one pin, The Partridge on the Sparhalk there doth tend, Who entertaines her as a loving friend; The ravenous Vulture feeles the small Birds sit Upon his back, and is not mov'd a whit; Amongst the thickest of these severall fowle With open eyes still sate the broad-fac'd Owle; And not a small bird as they wonted were, Either pursude or wondred at her there. No waylesse desart, Heath, nor Fen, nor More, But in by couples, sent some of their store; The Ospray, and the Cormorant forbeare To fish, and thither with the rest repayre: The Hearon leaves watching at the Rivers brim, And brings the Snyte and Plover in with him. There came the Halcyon, whom the Sea obeyes, When she her nest upon the water layes: The Goose which doth for watchfulnesse excell, Came for the rest, to be the Sentinell. The charitable Robinet in came, Whose nature taught the others to be tame: All feathered things yet ever knowne to men, The mighty Indian Bird.From the huge Rucke, unto the little Wren; From Forrests, Fields, from Rivers, and from Pons, All that have webs, or cloven-footed ones; To the Grand Arke, together friendly came, Whose severall species were too long to name The Beasts and Birds thus by the Angels brought, Noe found his Arke not fully yet was fraught, To shut it up for as he did begin, He still saw Serpents, and their like come in; Creeping things in the sixt of Gen: the 20. vers. The Salamander to the Arke retyers, To flye the Floud, it doth forsake the fiers: The strange Camelion, comes t'augment the crue, Yet in the Arke doth never change her hue: To these poore silly few of harmelesse things, So were there Serpents, with their teeth and stings Hurtfull to man, yet will th'Almighty have, That Noe their seed upon the earth should save: The watchfull Dragon comes the Arke to keepe, But lul'd with murmure, gently fals to sleepe: The cruell Scorpion comes to clime the pyle, And meeting with the greedy Crocodyle, Into the Arke together meekely goe, And like kinde mates themselves they there bestow: The Dart and Dipsas, to the Arke com'n in, Infold each other as they were a twinne. The Cockatrice there kils not with his sight, The Aspick hath a kell of skin which covereth his teeth untill it be angry. But in his object joyes, and in the Light; The deadly killing Aspicke when he seeth, This world of creatures, sheaths his poysoned teeth, And with the Adder, and the speckled Snake, Them to a corner harmlesly betake. The Lisard shuts up his sharpe-sighted eyes, Amongst these Serpents, and there sadly lyes. The small-ey'd slowe-worme held of many blinde, Yet this great Arke it quickly out could finde, And as the Arke it was about to clime, Out of its teeth shutes the invenom'd slime. These viler Creatures on the earth that creepe, And with their bellies the cold dewes doe sweepe, All these base groveling, and ground-licking sute, From the large A Serpent of an incredible bignesse. Boas, to the little Neute; As well as Birds, or the foure-footed beasts, Came to the Arke their Hostry as Noes guests. Thus fully furnisht, Noe need not to carke For stowidge, for provision for the Arke: For that wise God, who first direction gave, How he the structure of the Arke would have: And for his servant could provide this fraught, Which thither he miraculously brought: And did the food for every thing purvaye, Taught him on lofts it orderly to laye: On flesh some feed, as others fish doe eate, Various the kinde, so various was the meate: Some on fine grasse, as some on grosser weeds, As some on fruits, so other some on seeds, To serve for food for one whole yeare for all, Untill the Floud, which presently should fall On the whole world, his hand againe should drayne, Which under water should that while remaine. Th'Almighty measur'd the proportion such, As should not be too little, nor too much: For he that breath to every thing did give, Could not that God them likewise make to live, But with a little; and therewith to thrive, Who at his pleasure all things can contrive. Now some there be, too curious at this day, That from their reason dare not sticke to say, The Floud a thing fictitious is, and vaine, Nor that the Arke could possibly containe Those sundry creatures, from whose being came All living things man possibly could name. I say it was not, and I thus oppose Them by my reason, strong enough for those, My instance is a mighty Argosie, That in it beares, beside th'Artillery, Of fourescore pieces of a mighty Boare, A thousand souldiers (many times and more) Besides the sayles, and armes for every one, Cordage, and Anchors, and provision: The large-spred Sayles, the Masts both big and tall, Of all which Noahs Arke had no need at all: Within the same eight persons onely were, If such a ship, can such a burthen beare: What might the Arke doe, which doth so excell That Ship, as that ship doth a Cockle shell; Being so capacious for this mighty load, So long, so high, and every where so broad; Beside three lofts just of one perfect strength, And bearing out proportionably in length: So fitly built, that being thus imploy'd, There was not one ynch in the Arke was voyd, Beside I'le charge their reason to allow The Cubits doubled to what they are now, We are but Pigmeyes, (even our tallest men) To the huge Gyants that were living then: For but th'Almighty, which (to this intent,) Ordain'd the Arke, knew it sufficient, He in his wisedome (had he thought it meet) Could have bid Noah to have built a Fleet, And many Creatures on the earth since growne Before the floud that were to Noah unknowne: For though the Mule begotten on the Mare, By the dull Asse (is said) doth never payre; Yet sundry others, naturally have mixt, The opinions of the best naturalists that have written. And those that have beene gotten them betwixt Others begot, on others from their kinde. In sundry Clymats, sundry beasts we finde, That what they were, are nothing now the same, From one selfe straine, though at the first they came; But by the soyle they often altred be, In shape and colour as we daily see. Now Noahs three sonnes all busie that had bin To place these creatures as they still came in: Sem, Ham, and Japheth, with their The names of the women were Tita, Pandora, Noella and Noegla: as some of the most ancient write, but Epiphanius will have Noes Wifes name to be Barthenon. Wifes assign'd, To be the Parents of all humane kinde: Seeing the Arke thus plentifully stor'd: The wondrous worke of the Almighty Lord, Behold their father looking every houre, For this all-drowning earth-destroying showre, When Noe their faith thus lastly to awake, To his lov'd Wife, and their sixe children spake. The mighty hand of God doe you not see, In these his creatures, that so well agree: Which were they not, thus mastred by his power, Us silly eight would greedily devoure: And with their hoofes and pawes, to splinters rend This onely Arke, in which God doth intend We from the Floud that remnant shall remaine, T'restore the world, in aged Adams straine: Yee seaven, with sad astonishment then see The wondrous things the Lord hath wrought for me. What have I done, so gracious in his sight, Fraile wretched man, but that I justly might Have with the earths abhominable brood, Bin over-whelm'd, and buried in the Floud: But in his judgement, that he hath decreed, That from my loynes by your successefull seed, The earth shall be replenished agen, And the Almighty be at peace with men. A hundred yeares are past (as well you know) Since the Almighty God, his power to show Taught me the Modell of this mighty frame, And it the Arke commanded me to name. Be strong in faith, for now the time is nye, That from the conducts of the lofty skie, The Floud shall fall, that in short time shall beare This Arke we are in up into the ayre, Where it shall floate, and further in the end, Shall fifteene cubits the high'st hils transcend. Then bid the goodly fruitfull earth adue, For the next time it shall be seene of you, It with an ill complexion shall appeare, The weight of waters shall have chang'd her cheere. Be not affrighted, when ye heare the rore Of the wide Waters when they charge the shore, Nor be dismaid at all, when you shall feele Th'unweeldy Arke from wave to wave to reele: Nor at the shreekes of those that swimming by On Trees and Rafters, shall for succour cry, O ye most lov'd of God, O take us in, For we are guilty, and confesse our sinne. Thus whilst he spake, the skyes grew thicke and darke, And a blacke cloud hung hovering o're the Arke. Venus and Mars, God puts this worke upon: God makes the Starres his instruments to punish the wicked. Jupiter and Saturne in conjunction I'th tayle of Cancer, inundations thret. Luna disposed generally to wet, The Hiades and Pliades put too Their helpes; Orion doth what he can doe. No starre so small, but some one drop let downe, And all conspire the wicked world to drowne: On the wide heaven there was not any signe, To watry Pisces but it doth incline. Now some will aske, when th'Almighty God, (but Noy And his) by waters did the world destroy; Whether those seaven then in Arke were good, And just as he, (reserved from the Floud) Or that th'Almighty for his onely sake, Did on the other such compassion take: 'Tis doubtlesse Noe, being one so cleerely just, That God did with his secret judgements trust From the whole world; one that so long had knowne That living Lord, would likewise teach his owne To know him too, who by this meane might be, As well within the Covenant as he. By this the Sunne had suckt up the vaste deepe, And in grosse clouds like Cesternes did it keepe: The Starres and signes by Gods great wisedome set, A description of the Tempest, at the falling of the Deluge. By their conjunctions waters to beget, Had wrought their utmost, and even now began Th'Almighties justice upon sinfull man: From every severall quarter of the skye, The Thunder rores, and the fierce Lightnings flye One at another, and together dash, Volue on volue, flash comes after flash: Heavens lights looke sad, as they would melt away, The night is com'n i'th morning of the day: The Card'nall Windes he makes at once to blow, Whose blasts to buffets with such fury goe, That they themselves into the Center shot Into the bowels of the earth and got, Being condens'd and strongly stifned there, Water is but ayre condens'd.In such strange manner multiply'd the ayre, Which turn'd to water, and increast the springs To that abundance, that the earth forth brings Water to drowne her selfe, should heaven deny, With one small drop the Deluge to supply, That through her pores, the soft and spungy earth, As in a dropsie, or unkindely birth, A Woman, swolne, sends from her fluxive wombe Her woosie springs, that there was scarcely roome For the waste waters which came in so fast, As though the earth her entrailes up would cast. But these seem'd yet, but easily let goe, And from some Sluce came softly in, and slow, Till Gods great hand so squees'd the boysterous clouds, That from the spouts of heavens embatteld shrouds, Even like a Floud-gate pluckt up by the height, Came the wilde raine, with such a pondrous weight, As that the fiercenesse of the hurrying floud, Remov'd huge Rockes, and ram'd them into mud: Pressing the ground, with that impetuous power, As that the first shocke of this drowning shower, Furrow'd the earths late plumpe and cheerefull face Like an old Woman, that in little space With ryveld cheekes, and with bleard blubberd eyes, She wistly look'd upon the troubled skyes. Up to some Mountaine as the people make, Driving their Cattell till the shower should slake; The Floud oretakes them, and away doth sweepe Great heards of Neate, and mighty flockes of Sheepe. Downe through a valley as one streame doth come, Whose roaring strikes the neighbouring Eccho dumbe: Another meetes it, and whilst there they strive, Which of them two the other backe should drive; Their dreadfull currents they together dash, So that their waves like furious Tydes doe wash The head of some neere hill, which falleth downe For very feare, as it, it selfe would drowne. Some backe their Beasts, so hoping to swimme out, But by the Floud, incompassed about Are overwhelm'd, some clamber up to Towers, But these and them, the deluge soone devoures: Some to the top of Pynes and Cedars get, Thinking themselves they safely there should set: But the rude Floud that over all doth sway, Quickly comes up, and carrieth them away. The Roes much swiftnesse, doth no more availe, The Roe Deere the swiftest Beast knowne. Nor helpe him now, then if he were a Snayle: The swift-wing'd Swallow, and the slow-wing'd Owle, The fleetest Bird, and the most flagging Fowle, Are at one passe, the Floud so high hath gone, There was no ground to set a foot upon: Those Fowle that followed moystnesse, now it flye, And leave the wet Land, to finde out the dry: But by the mighty tempest beaten downe, On the blancke water they doe lye and drowne: The strong-built Tower is quickly overborne, The o're-growne Oake out of the earth is torne: The subtile shower the earth hath softned so, And with the waves, the trees tost to and fro; That the rootes loosen, and the tops downe sway, So that whole Forrests quickly swimme away. Th'offended heaven had shut up all her lights, The Sunne nor Moone make neither daies nor nights: The waters so exceedingly abound That in short time the Sea it selfe is drownd. That by the freshnesse of the falling raine, Neptune no more his saltnesse doth retaine: So that those scaly creatures us'd to keepe, The mighty wasts of the immeasured deepe: Finding the generall and their naturall bracke, The taste and colour every were to lacke; Forsake those Seas wherein they swamme before, Strangely oppressed with their watry store. The crooked Dolphin on those Mountaines playes, Whereas before that time, not many daies The Goate was grazing; and the mighty Whale, Upon a Rocke out of his way doth fall: From whence before one eas'ly might have seene, The wandring clouds farre under to have beene. The Grampus, and the Whirlpoole, as they rove, Lighting by chance upon a lofty Grove Under this world of waters, are so much Pleas'd with their wombes each tender branch to touch, That they leave slyme upon the curled Sprayes, On which the Birds sung their harmonious Layes. As huge as Hills still waves are wallowing in, Which from the world so wondrously doe winne, That the tall Mountaines which on tipto stood, As though they scorn'd the force of any flood, No eye of heaven of their proud tops could see One foot, from this great inundation free. A simily of the grosnesse of the DelugeAs in the Chaos ere the frame was fix'd The Ayre and water were so strongly mix'd, And such a Bulke of Grosenesse doe compose, As in those thick Clouds which the Globe inclose, Th'all-working Spirit were yet againe to wade, And heaven and earth againe were to be made. Meane while this great and universall Arke, Like one by night were groping in the darke, Now by one Billow, then another rockt, Within whose boards all living things were lockt; Yet Noah his safety not at all doth feare, For still the Angels his blest Barge doe steere: But now the Shower continued had so long, The inundation waxt so wondrous strong, That fifteene Cubits caus'd the Arke to move The highest part of any Hill above: And the grosse earth so violently binds, That in their Coasts it had inclos'd the winds; So that the whole wide surface of the flood, As in the full height of the tyde it stood, Was then as sleeke and even as the Seas In the most still and calmest Halcyon dayes: The Birds, the Beasts and Serpents safe on board, With admiration looke upon thir Lord, The righteous Noah: and with submissive feare, Tremble his grave and awfull voyce to heare, When to his Houshould (during their aboad) He preacht the power of the Almighty God. Deare wife and children, quoth this godly Noy, Noah preaching faith to his family. Since the Almighty vow'd he would destroy The wicked world, a hundred yeares are past, And see, he hath performed it at last; In us poore few, the world consists alone, And besides us, there not remaineth one, But from our seed, the emptied earth agen, Must be repeopled with the race of men; Then since thus farre his covenant is true Build ye your faith, on that which shall ensue: Such is our God, who thus did us imbarque (As his select) to save us by the Arke, And only he whose Angels guard our Boat, Knowes over what strange Region now we float, Or we from hence that very place can sound, From which the Arke was lifted first from ground: He that can span the world, and with a grip, Out of the bowels of the clouds could rip This masse of waters, whose abundant birth, Almost to heaven thus drowneth up the earth; He can remove this Round if he shall please, And with these waters can sup up the Seas, Can cause the Starres out of their Sphears to fall, And on the winds can tosse this earthy Ball, He can wrest drops from the Sunnes radient beames, And can force fire from the most liquid streames, He curles the waves with whirlwinds, and doth make The solid Center fearfully to shake, He can stirre up the Elements to warres, And at his pleasure can compose their Jarres, The Sands serve not his wondrous workes to count, Yet doth his mercy all his workes surmount, His Rule and Power eternally endures, He was your Fathers God, he's mine, he's yours, In him deare wife and children put your trust, He onely is Almighty, onely just. But on the earth the waters were so strong, And now the flood continued had so long, That the let yeare foreslow'd about to bring The Summer, Autumne, Winter, and the Spring, The revolution of the yeare by a short Periphrasis.The Gyring Planets with their starry traine, Downe to the South had sunck, and rose againe Up towards the North, whilst the terrestriall Globe Had bin involved in this watry Robe, During which season every twinckling light In their still motion, at this monstrous sight, By their complection a distraction show'd, Looking like Embers that through ashes glow'd. When righteous Noah remembreth at the last, The time prefix'd to be approaching fast, After a hundred fifty dayes were gone, Which to their period then were drawing on, The flood should somewhat slack, God promist so, On which relying, the just godly Noe, To try if then but one poore foot of ground, Free from the flood might any where be found, Lets forth a Raven, which straight cuts the Skye, And wondrous proud his restyed wings to try, In a large circle girdeth in the Ayre, First to the East, then to the South, doth beare, Followes the Sunne, then towards his going forth, And then runnes up into the rysing North, Thence climes the clouds to prove if his sharpe eye From that proud pitch could possibly descry Of some tall Rock-crown'd Mountaine, a small stone A minuts space to set his foot upon, But finding his long labour but in vaine, Returneth wearied to the Arke againe, By which Noah knew he longer yet must stay, For the whole earth still under water lay. Seaven dayes he rests, but yet he would not cease, (For that he knew the flood must needs decrease) But as the Raven late, he next sends out The damaske coloured Dove, his nimble Scout, Which thrils the thin Ayre, and his pyneons plyes, That like to lightning, glyding through the Skyes, His sundry coloured feathers by the Sunne, As his swift shadow on the Lake doth runne, Causeth a twinckling both at hand and farre, Like that we call the shooting of a Starre; But finding yet that labour lost had bin, Comes back to Noah, who gently takes him in. Noah rests awhile, but meaning still to prove A second search, againe sends out the Dove, After other seaven, some better newes to bring, Which by the strength of his unwearied wing Findes out at last, a place for his aboad, When the glad Bird stayes all the day abroad, And wondrous proud that he a place had found, Who of a long time had not toucht the ground, Drawes in his head, and thrusteth out his breast, Spreadeth his tayle, and swelleth up his crest, And turning round and round with Cuttry cooe, As when the female Pigeon and he wooe; Bathing himselfe, which long he had not done, And dryes his feathers in the welcome Sunne, Pruning his plumage, clensing every quill, And going back, he beareth in his bill An Olive leafe, by which Noah understood The great decrease and waning of the flood: For that on Mountaines Olives seldome grow, But in flat Valleys, and in places low; Never such comfort came to mortall man, Never such joy was since the world began, As in the Arke, when Noah and his behold The Olive leafe, which certainly them told, The flood decreas'd, and they such comfort take, That with their mirth, the Birds and Beasts they make Sportive, which send forth such a hollow noyse As said they were partakers of their joyes. The Lion roares, but quickly doth forbeare, Lest he thereby the lesser Beasts should feare, The Bull doth bellow, and the Horse doth nay, The Stag, the Buck, and shaghayrd Goat doe bray, The Boare doth grunt, the Woolfe doth howle, the Ram Doth bleate, which yet so faintly from him came, As though for very joy he seem'd to weepe, The Ape and Muncky such a chattering keepe With their thin lips, which they so well exprest, As they would say, we hope to be releast; The silly Asse set open such a throat, That all the Arke resounded with the note; The watchfull Dog doth play, and skip, and barke, And leaps upon his Masters in the Arke, The Raven crokes, the caryon Crow doth squall, The Pye doth chatter, and the Partridge call, The jocund Cock crowes as he claps his wings, The Merle doth whistle, and the Mavis sings, The Nightingale straines her melodious throat, Which of the small Birds being heard to roat, They soone set to her, each a part doth take, As by their musick up a Quire to make, The Parrat lately sad, then talks and jeeres, And counterfeiteth every sound he heares, The purblind Owle which heareth all this doo, T'expresse her gladnesse, cryes Too whit too whoo. No Beast nor Bird was in the Arke with Noy, But in their kinde exprest some signe of joy; When that just man who did himselfe apply Still, to his deare and godly family, Thus to them spake (and with erected hands The like obedience from the rest demands) The worlds foundation is not halfe so sure As is Gods promise, nor is heaven so pure As is his word, to me most sinfull man; To take the Arke who when I first began Sayd on the hundred and the fiftieth day, I should perceive the Deluge to decay, And 'tis most certaine, as you well may know Which this poore Pidgeon by this leafe doth show. He that so long could make the waters stand Above the earth, see how his powerfull hand Thrusts them before it, and so fast doth drive The Big swolne Billowes, that they seeme to strive Which shall fly fastest on that secret path, Whence first they came, to execute his wrath, The Sunne which melted every Cloud to Raine, He makes it now to sup it up againe: The wind by which he brought it on before In their declining drives it o'r and o'r, The tongs of Angells serve not to expresse, Neither his mercy, nor his mightinesse, Be joyfull then in our greate God (sayth he) For we the Parents of Mankind shall be: From us poore few, (his pleasure that attend) Shall all the Nations of the earth descend; When righteous Noy desirous still to heare, In what estate th'unweeldy waters were, Sends foorth the Dove as he had done before, But it found drie land and came backe no more, Whereby this man precisely understood, The greate decrease of this world-drowning floud: Thus as the Arke is floating on the mayne, As when the floud rose, in the fall againe, With Currents still encountred every where Forward and backeward which it still doe beare, As the streame straytneth, by the rising Cleeves Mountains of a wondrous height, either within, or bordering upon Armenia. Of the tall Mountaines, 'twixt which oft it drives, Untill at length by Gods Almighty hand, It on the hills of Ararat doth land. When those within it felt the Arke to strike, On the firme ground, was ever comfort like To theirs, which felt it fixed there to stay, And found the waters went so fast away; That Noah set up the covering of the Arke, That those which long had sitten in the darke, Might be saluted with the cheerfull light, (O since the world, was ever such a sight!) That creeping things aswell as Bird or Beast, Their severall comforts sundry wayes exprest? His wife and children then ascend to see What place it was so happy that should be For th'Arke to rest on, where they saw a Plaine, A Mountaines top which seemed to containe, On which they might discerne within their ken, The carkasses of Birds, of Beasts, and men, Choak'd by the Deluge, when Noah spake them thus, Behold th'Almighties mercy shew'd to us, That thorow the waves our way not onely wrought, But to these Mountaines safely hath us brought, Whose daynty tops all earthly pleasures crowne And one the Greene-sward sets us safely downe. Had our most gratious God not beene our guide The Arke had fallne upon some Mountaine-side, And with a Rush removing of our fraight Might well have turnd it backward with the waight Or by these Billows lastly over borne Or on some Rocke her ribbs might have bin torne. But see except these heere, each living thing That crept, or went, or kept the Aire with wing, Lye heere before us to manure the Land, Such is the power of Gods all workeing hand. In the sixhundred yeere of that just man In May according to the Expositors.The second month, the seventeenth day began, That horrid Deluge when Heavens windows were At once all opened, then did first appeare Th'Allmightys wrath, when for full forty days There raynd from Heaven not showers but mighty seas, A hundred fifty dayes that so prevayld, Above the Mountaines till the great Arke sayld, In the seaventh moneth, upon the seaventeenth day, Part of September and part of October. Like a Ship falne into a quyet Bay, It on the Hils of Ararat doth light: But Noah deny'd yet to discharge the Fraight, For that the Mountaines cleerely were not seene, Till the first day of the tenth mon'th, when Greene Smyld on the blew Skyes, when the earth began To looke up cheerly, yet the waters ran Still throw the Valleyes, till the mon'th againe In the same moneth the flood began, it ceast: which made up the yeare. In which before it first began to rayne; Of which, the seaven and twentieth day expyr'd, Quite from the earth the waters were retyr'd: When the almighty God bad Noah to set Open the Arke, at liberty to let The Beasts, the Birds, and creeping things, which came Like as when first they went into the same, Each male comes downe, his female by his side, As 'twere the Bridgroome bringing out his Bride, Till th'Arke was emptied, and that mighty load, For a whole yeare that there had bin bestow'd, (Since first that forty-dayes still-falling raine That drown'd the world, was then dry'd up againe) Which with much gladnesse doe salute the ground, The lighter sort some caper, and some bound, The heavier creatures tumble them, as glad That they such ease by their enlargement had, The creeping things together fall to play, Joy'd beyond measure, for this happy day, The Birds let from this Cage, doe mount the Skye, To shew, they yet had not forgot to flye, And sporting them upon the ayry plaine, Yet to their master Noah they stoope againe, To leave his presence, and doe still forbeare, Till they from him of their release might heare, The Beasts each other wooe, the Birds they bill, As they would say to Noe, they ment to fill The roomthy earth, then altogether voyd; And make, what late the deluge had destroyd. When Righteous Noye, who ever had regard To serve his God, immediately prepar'd To sacrifice, and of the cleanest Beasts That in the Arke this while had bin his guests, He seaseth, (yet obedient to his will) And of them, he for sacrifice doth kill: Which he and his religiously attend, And with the smoake their vowes and thankes ascend, Which pleas'd th'Almighty, that he promis'd then, Never by floud to drowne the world agen. And that mankinde his covenant might know, He in the clouds left the celestiall Bow. When to these living things quoth righteous Noe, Now take you all free liberty to goe, And every way doe you your selves disperse, Till you have fild this globy universe With your increase, let every soyle be yours, He that hath sav'd yee, faithfully assures Your propagation: and deare wife quoth he, And you my children, let your trust still be In your preserver, and on him relye, Whose promise is that we shall multiply, Till in our dayes, of nations we shall heare From us poore few in th'Arke that lately were. To make a new world, thus works every one, The Deluge ceaseth, and the old is gone. TO THIS POEM [Moses His Birth and Miracles]. See how ingrate forgetfulnesse Circles us round with dangers, That all the Saints whom God doth highly blesse, To us are strangers: Now Heav'n into our soules inspires No true cœlestiall motions: Lusts ardent flame hath dimm'd the holy fires Of our devotions. While 'gainst blasphemers gen'rall spight Our painefull Author striveth, And happy spirits which live in heavenly light On earth reviveth. Thou Patriarke great, who with milde lookes His lab'ring Muse beholdest: Reach him those leaves where thou in sacred bookes All truth unfoldest: And guide (like Israel) Poets hands From Aegypt, from vaine Stories, Onely to sing of the faire promis'd lands, And all their glories. John Beaumont. TO M. MICHAEL DRAYTON. Thy noble Muse already hath beene spred Through Europe and the Sun-scorch'd Southerne climes, That Ile where Saturnes royall Sonne was bred, Hath beene enricht with thy immortall rimes: Even to the burnt line have thy poems flowne, And gain'd high fame in the declining West, And o're that cold Sea shall thy name be blowne, That Icie mountaines rowleth on her brest: Her soaring hence so farre made me admire, Whether at length thy worthy Muse would flie, Borne through the tender ayre with wings of fire, Able to lift her to the starrie skie: This work resolv'd my doubts, when th'earths repleate With her faire fruit, in Heav'n shee'le take her seate. Thomas Andrewe. Ex arduis æternitas. MOSES HIS BIRTH AND MIRACLES. THE FIRST BOOKE. The Argument. This Canto our attracted Muse The Prophets glorious birth pursues, The various changes of his fate, From humblenesse to high estate, His beautie, more than mortall shape, From Egypt how he doth escape, By his faire bearing in his flight, Obtaines the lovely Midianite, Where God unto the Hebrew spake, Appearing from the burning brake, And backe doth him to Egypt send, That mighty things doth there intend. Girt in bright flames, rapt from celestiall fire, That our unwearied faculties refine, By zeale transported boldly we aspire To sing a subject gloriously divine: Him that of mortals onely had the grace, (On whom the Spirit did in such power descend) To talke with God face opposite to face, Even as a man with his familiar friend. Muse I invoke the utmost of thy might, That with an armed and auspitious wing, Thou be obsequious in his doubtlesse right 'Gainst the vile Atheists vituperious sting: Where thou that gate industriously mai'st flie, Which Nature strives but fainedly to goe, Borne by a power so eminent and hie, As in his course leaves reason farre below, To shew how Poesie (simplie hath her praise) That from full Jove takes her celestiall birth, And quicke as fire, her glorious selfe can raise Above this base abhominable earth. O if that Time have happily reservd, (Besides that sacred and canonicke writ, What once in Slates and Barkes of trees was kerv'd) Things that our Muses gravitie may fit, Unclaspe the worlds great Register to mee, That smoakie rust hath very neere defac'd, That I in those dim Characters may see, From common eyes that hath aside beene cast, And thou Translator of that faithfull Muse This Alls creation that divinely song, From Courtly French (no travaile do'st refuse) To make him Master of thy Genuin tong, Salust to thee and Silvester thy friend, Comes my high Poem peaceably and chaste, Your hallow'd labours humbly to attend That wrackfull Time shall not have power to waste. A gallant Hebrew (in the height of life) Amram a Levit honourably bred, Of the same off-spring wan a beauteous wife, And no lesse vertuous, goodly Jacobed: So fitly pair'd that (without all ostent) Even of the wise it hardly could be sayd Which of the two was most preheminent, Or he more honour'd, or she more obayd, In both was found that liveliehood and meetnes, By which affection any way was mov'd: In him that shape, in her there was that sweetnes, Might make him lik'd or her to be belov'd: As this commixtion, so their maried mind Their good corrected, or their ill releev'd, As truly loving as discreetly kinde, Mutuallie joy'd, as mutuallie greev'd: Their nuptiall bed by abstinence maintain'd, Yet still gave fewell to Loves sacred fire, And when fruition plentifulli'st gain'd, Yet were they chaste in fulnes of desire. Now grieved Israel many a wofull day, That at their vile servilitie repin'd, Press'd with the burdens of rude boist'rous clay, By sterne Egyptian tyrannie assign'd: Yet still the more the Hebrewes are opprest Like to Frim seed they fructifie the more That by th'eternall providence fore-blest, Goshen gives roomth but scantly to their store. And the wise Midwives in their naturall neede, That the faire males immediatlie should kill, Hating s'abhord, and Hethenish a deede, Check his harsh brutenes and rebellious will. That small effect perceiving by the same, Bids the men-children (greatelie that abound) After that day into the world that came, Upon their birth should instantly be drownd: And now the time came had bin long foretold, He should be borne unto the Hebrewes joy, Whose puissant hand such fatall power should hold, As in short time all Egipt should destroy. The execution which more strongly forc'd, And every where so generally done, As in small time unnaturally divorc'd, Many a deare Mother, and as deare a Sonne. Though her chast bosome that faire Altar were, Where Loves pure vowes he dutifully pay'd, His Armes to her a Sanctuary deare, Yet they so much his tyranny obay'd, By free consent to separate their bed, Better at all no Children yet to have, Then their deare love should procreate the dead, Untimely issue for a timelesse grave. When in a vision whilst he slept by night, God bids him so not Jacobed to leave, The man that Egypt did so much affright, Her pregnant wombe should happily conceave. Joseph. Soone after finding that she was with child, The same conceales by all the meanes she can, Lest by th'apparance she might be beguild, If in the birth it prov'd to be a man. The time she goes till her accompt was nie, Her swelling belly no conception showes, Nor at the time of her delivery, As other women panged in her throwes. When lo the faire fruit of that prospering wombe Wounds the kinde parents in their prime of joy, Whose birth pronounceth his too timelesse doombe Accus'd by Nature, forming it a boy: Yet tis so sweet, so amiably faire, That their pleas'd eies with rapture it behold, The glad-sad parents full of joy and care Faine would reserve their Infant if they could, And still they tempt the sundrie varying howers, Hopes and despaires together strangely mixt, Distasting sweets with many cordiall sowers, Opposed interchangeably betwixt. If ought it ayl'd or hapleslie it cride, Unheard of any that she might it keepe, With one short breath she did intreat and chide, And in a moment she did sing and weepe. Three lab'ring months them flatterer-like beguilde, And danger still redoubling as it lasts, Suspecting most the safety of the Childe, Thus the kinde Mother carefully forecasts: (For at three moneths a scrutinie was held, And searchers then sent every where about, That in that time if any were conceal'd, They should make proofe and straitly bring them out:) To Pharoes will she awfully must bow, And therefore hastens to abridge these feares, And to the flood determines it shall goe, Yet ere it went shee'll drowne it with her teares. This afternoone Love bids a little stay, And yet these pauses doe but lengthen sorrow, But for one night although she make delay, She vowes to goe unto his death to morrow. The morning comes, it is too early yet, The day so fast not hast'ning on his date, The gloomy Evening murther best doth fit, The Evening come, and then it is too late. Her pretty Infant lying on her lap With his sweet eyes her threatning rage beguiles, For yet he playes, and dallyes with his pap, To mock her sorrowes with his am'rous smiles, And laugh'd, and chuck'd: and spred the pretty hands, When her full heart was at the point to breake, (This little Creature yet not understands The wofull language mothers teares did speake.) Wherewith surpriz'd, and with a parents love, From his faire eyes she doth fresh courage take, And Natures lawes allowing, doth reprove The fraile Edicts that mortall Princes make. It shall not die, she'll keepe her child unknowne, And come the worst in spight of Pharoes rage, As it is hers, she will dispose her owne, And if't must die, it'st die at riper age. And thus revolving of her frailties care, A thousand strange thoughts throng her troubled minde, Sounding the dangers deepely what they are, Betwixt the lawes of cruelty and kinde. But it must die, and better yet to part, Since preordain'd to this disast'rous fate, His want will sit the neerer to the heart In riper and more flourishing estate. The perfect husband whose impressive soule, Tooke true proportion of each pensive throw, Yet had such power his passion to controule, As not the same immediately to show. With carriage full of comelinesse and grace, As griefe not felt nor sorrow seem'd to lacke, Courage and feare so temp'red in his face, Thus his beloved Jacobed bespake. Deare heart be patient, stay these timelesse teares, Death of thy Son shall never quite bereave thee, My soule with thine, that equall burthen beares, As what he takes, my Love againe shall give thee: For Israels sinne if Israels seed must suffer, And we of meere necessity must leave him, Please yet to grace me with this gentle offer, Give him to me by whom thou didst conceyve him. So though thou with so deare a jewell part, This yet remayneth lastly to releeve thee, Thou hast impos'd this hindrance on my heart, Anothers losse shall need the lesse to grieve thee, Nor are we Hebrewes abject by our name, Though thus in Egypt hatefully despised, That we that blessing fruitlesly should clayme Once in that holy Covenant comprised, It is not fit Mortality should know What his eternall providence decreed, That unto Abraham ratifi'd the vowe In happy Sara and her hallowed seed. Nor shall the wrong to godly Joseph done In his remembrance ever be enrould, By Jacobs sighes for his lost little sonne A Captiv'd slave to the Egyptians sould: Reason sets limmets to the longest griefe, Sorrow scarse past when comfort is returning, He sends affliction that can lend releefe, Best that is pleas'd with measure in our mourning. Lost in her selfe, her spirits are so distracted, All hopes dissolv'd might fortifie her further, Her minde seemes now of misery compacted, That must consent unto so deere a murther. Of slime and twigs she makes a simple shread (The poore last duty to her child she owes This pretty martyr, this yet living dead) Wherein she doth his little corps enclose: And meanes to beare it presently away, And in some water secretly bestow it, But yet a while bethinkes her selfe to stay, Some little kindnesse she doeth further owe it: Nor will she in this cruelty persever, That by her meanes his timelesse blood be spilt, If of her owne she doth her selfe deliver, Let others hands be nocent of the guilt: Yet if she keepe it from the ruthlesse flood That is by Pharo's tyranny assign'd it, What bootes that wretched miserable good, If so dispos'd where none doe come to finde it, For better yet the Homicide should kill it, Or by some beast in peeces to be rent, Than lingring famine cruelly should spill it, That it endure a double languishment: And neighbouring neere to the Egyptian Court, She knowes a place that neere the river side Was oft frequented by the worthier sort, For now the spring was newly in her pride. Thither she hastes but with a paynefull speed The neerest way she possibly could get, And by the cleere brimme mongst the flags and reede, Her little Coffin carefully she set: Her little Girle (the Mother following neere) As of her Brother that her leave would take, Which the sad woman unexpecting there, Yet it to helpe her kindely thus bespake: (Quoth she) sweet Miriam secretly attend, And for his death see who approacheth hether, That once for all assured of his end, His dayes and mine be consummate together, It is some comfort to a wretch to die (If there be comfort in the way of death) To have some friend or kinde alliance by, To be officious at the parting breath: Thus she departs, oft stayes, oft turneth backe, Looking about lest any one espi'd her, Faine would she leave, that leaving she doth lacke, That in this sort so strangely doth divide her. Unto what Dame (participating kinde) My verse her sad perplexitie shall showe, That in a softned and relenting minde Findes not a true touch of that Mothers woe. Yet all this while full quietly it slept, (Poore little Brat incapable of care) Which by that powerfull providence is kept, Who doth this childe for better daies prepare. See here an abject utterly forlorne, Left to destruction as a violent prey, Whom man might judge accursed to be borne, To darke oblivion moulded up in clay, That man of might in after times should bee (The bounds of fraile mortality that brake) Which that Almighty gloriously should see, When he in thunder on mount Sinai spake. Now Pharaoh's Daughter Termuth young &amp; faire, With such choyce Maydens as she favour'd most, Needes would abroad to take the gentle ayre, Whilst the rich yeere his braveries seem'd to boast: Softly she walkes downe to the secret flood, Through the calme shades most peaceable &amp; quiet, In the coole streames to check the pampred blood, Stir'd with strong youth and their delicious diet; Such as the Princesse, such the day addressed, As though provided equally to paire her, Either in other fortunately blessed She by the day, the day by her made fairer, Both in the height and fulnesse of their pleasure, As to them both some future good divining, Holding a steadie and accomplish'd measure, This in her perfect clearenesse, that in shining. The very ayre to emulate her meekenesse, Strove to be bright and peaceable as she, That it grew jealous of that sodaine sleekenesse, Fearing it after otherwise might be: And if the fleet winde by some rigorous gale Seem'd to be mov'd, and patiently to chide her, It was as angry with her lawnie vaile, That from his sight it enviously should hide her: And now approching to the flow'rie meade Where the rich Summer curiously had dight her, Which seem'd in all her jollitie arayde, With Natures cost and pleasures to delight her: See this most blessed, this unusuall hap, She the small basket sooner should espie, That the Childe wak'd, and missing of his pap, As for her succour instantly did cry; Forth of the flagges she caus'd it to be taken, Calling her Maids this Orphanet to see, Much did she joy an Innocent forsaken By her from perill priviledg'd might be: This most sweet Princesse pittifull and milde, Soone on her knee unswathes it as her owne, Found for a man, so beautifull a Childe, Might for an Hebrew easily be knowne: Noting the care in dressing it bestow'd, Each thing that fitted gentlenesse to weare, Judg'd the sad parents this lost Infant ow'd, Were as invulgar as their fruit was faire, (Saith she) my minde not any way suggests An unchaste wombe these lineaments hath bred, For thy faire brow apparently contests The currant stampe of a cleane nuptiall bed: She nam'd it Moyses, which in time might tell (For names doe many mysteries expound) When it was young the chance that it befell, How by the water strangely it was found, Calling Melch-women that Egyptians were, Once to the teat his lips he would not lay, As though offended with their sullied leare, Seeming as still to turne his head away. The little Girle that neere at hand did lurke, (Thinking this while she tarried but too long) Finding these things so happily to worke, Kindely being crafty, wise as she was yong, Madame (saith she) wilt please you I provide A Nurse to breed the Infant you did finde, There is an Hebrew dwelling here beside, I know can doe it fitly to your minde: For a right Hebrew if the Infant be, (As well produce you instances I can, And by this Childe as partly you may see,) It will not sucke of an Egyptian. The courteous Princesse offered now so faire, That which before she earnestly desir'd, That of her foundling had a speciall care, The Girle to fetch her instantly requir'd: Away the Girle goes, doth her Mother tell What favor God had to her brother showne, And what else in this accident befell, That she might now be Nurse unto her owne. Little it bootes to bid the Wench to ply her, Nor the kinde Mother hearken to her sonne, Nor to provoke her to the place to hie her, Which seem'd not now on earthly feete to runne: Slow to her selfe yet hasting as she flew, (So fast affection forward did her beare) As though forewafted with the breath she drew, Borne by the force of nature and of feare, Little the time, and little is the way, And for her businesse eithers speede doth crave, Yet in her haste bethinkes her what to say, And how her selfe in presence to behave, Slack shee'l not seeme lest to anothers trust Her hopefull charge were happily directed, Nor yet too forward shew her selfe she must, Lest her sweet fraud thereby might be suspected; Com'n she doth bow her humbly to the ground, And every joynt incessantly doth tremble, Gladnesse and feare each other so confound, So hard a thing for Mothers to dissemble. Saith this sweet Termuth, well I like thy beautie, Nurse me this Childe (if it thy state behoove) Although a Prince ile not enforce thy dutie, But pay thy labour, and reward thy love: Though even as Gods is Pharaohs high command, And as strong Nature so precise and strict, There rests that power yet in a Princesse hand, To free one Hebrew from this strong edict: That shall in rich abilliments be dight, Deck'd in the Jems that admirabl'st shine, Wearing our owne roabe gracious in our sight, Free in our Court, and nourished for mine: Love him deare Hebrew as he were thine owne, Good Nurse be carefull of my little Boy, In this to us thy kindenesse may be showne, Some Mothers griefe, is now a Maydens joy. This while all mute, the poore astonish'd Mother, With admiration as transpearced stood, One bursting joy doth so confound another, Passion so powerfull in her ravish'd blood. Whisp'ring some soft words which delivered were, As rather seem'd her silence to impart, And being inforc'd from bashfulnesse and feare, Came as true tokens of a gracefull heart. Thus she departs her husband to content, With this deare present backe to him she brought, Making the time short, telling each event, In all shapes joy presented to her thought. Yet still his manly modesty was such (That his affections strongly so controlde,) As if joy seem'd his manly heart to touch, It was her joy and gladnesse to behold: When all rejoyc'd unmov'd thereat the whiles, In his grave face such constancie appeares, As now scarse shewing comfort in his smiles, Nor then revealing sorrow in his teares: Yet oft beheld it with that stedfast eye, Which though it sdain'd the pleasdnesse to confesse, More in his lookes in fulnesse there did lie, Than all their words could any way expresse. In time the Princesse playing with the Childe, In whom she seem'd her chiefe delight to take, Josephus. Pet. Comestor. With whom she oft the wearie time beguil'd, That as her owne did of this Hebrew make: It so fell out as Pharaoh was in place, Seeing his daughter in the Childe to joy, To please the Princesse, and to doe it grace, Himselfe vouchsafes to entertaine the Boy: Whose shape and beautie when he did behold With much content his Princely eye that fed, Giving to please it, any thing it would, Set his rich Crowne upon the Infants head, Which this weake Childe regarding not at all (As such a Babie carelesly is meete) Unto the ground the Diadem let fall Spurning it from him with neglectfull feete. Which as the Priests beheld this ominous thing (That else had past unnoted as a toy) As from their skill report unto the King, This was the man that Egypt should destroy. Tolde by the Magi that were learn'd and wise, Which might full well the jealous King enflame, Said by th'Egyptian ancient prophecies That might give credite easlier to the same. She as discreete as she was chaste and faire, With Princely gesture and with count'nance milde By things that hurtfull and most dangerous were Showes to the King the weakenesse of the Childe: Hot burning coales doth to his mouth present, Which he to handle simply doth not sticke, This little foole, this retchlesse Innocent The burning gleed with his soft tongue doth licke: Which though in Pharaoh her desire it wrought, His babish imbecilitie to see, To the Childes speech impediment it brought, From which he after never could be free. The Childe grew up, when in his manly face Beautie was seene in an unusuall cheere, Such mixtures sweet of comelinesse and grace Likely apparell'd in complexion cleere. The part of earth contends with that of heaven, Both in their proper puritie excelling, To whether more preheminence was given, Which should excell the dweller or the dwelling. Mens usuall stature he did farre exceede, And every part proportioned so well, The more the eye upon his shape did feede, The more it long'd upon the same to dwell: Each joynt such perfect Harmonie did beare, That curious judgement taking any lim Searching might misse to match it any where, Nature so fail'd in parallelling him: His haire bright yellow, on an arched brow Sate all the beauties kinde could ever frame, And did them there so orderly bestow, As such a seate of majestie became. As time made perfect each exteriour part, So still his honour with his yeeres encreas'd, That he sate Lord in many a tender heart, With such high favours his faire youth was bless'd. So fell it out that Æthiop warre began, Invading Egypt with their armed powers, And taking spoiles, the Country over-ran To where as Memphis vaunts her climing Towers. Wherefore they with their Oracles conferre About th'event, which doe this answere make, That if they would transport this civill warre, They to their Captaine must an Hebrew take. And for faire Moyses happily was growne Of so great towardnesse and especiall hope, Him they doe choose as absolutest knowne To leade their power against the Æthiope. Which they of Termuth hardly can obtaine, Though on their Altars by their Gods they vowe Him to deliver safe to her againe, (Once the warre ended) safe as he was now. Who for the way the Armie was to passe, That by th'Egyptians onely was intended, Most part by water, more prolixious was Than present perill any whit commended: To intercept the Æthiopians wrought A way farre nearer who their Legions led, Which till that time impassible was thought, Such store of Serpents in that place was bred: Devis'd by Birds this danger to eschew, Whereof in Egypt he exceeding store, The Storke, and Ibis, which he wisely knew, All kindes of Serpents naturally abhore. Which he in Baskets of Ægyptian reede, Borne with his caridge easely doth convay, And where incampeth sets them forth to feede, Which drive the Serpents presently away. Thus them preventing by this subtill course, That all their succour sodainly bereft, When Æthiop flies before th'Egyptian force, Shut up in Saba their last refuge left. Which whilst with strait siedge they beleagred long, The Kings faire Daughter haps him to behold, And became fettered with affection strong, Comester.Which in short time could hardly be controlde. Tarbis that kindled this rebellious rage, That they to Egypt tributorie were, When the olde King decrepit now with age, She in his stead the soveraigntie did beare. Up to his Tower where she the Camp might see, To looke her new Love every day she went, And when he hap'ned from the field to be, She thought her blest beholding but his Tent, And oftentimes doth modestly invay 'Gainst him the Citie walled first about, That the strong site should churlishly denay Him to come in, or her for passing out, Had the gates beene but softned as her breast (That to behold her loved enemie stands) He had ere this of Saba beene possest, And therein planted the Egyptian bands: Oft from a place as secretly she might (That from her Pallace look'd unto his Tent) When he came forth appearing in his sight, Shewing by signes the love to him she ment. For in what armes it pleas'd him to be dight, After the Hebrew or th'Egyptian guise: He was the bravest, the most goodly wight That ever graced Æthiop with his eyes. And finding meanes to parley from a place, By night, her passion doth to him discover, To yeeld the Citie if he would embrace Her a true Princesse, as a faithfull Lover. The feature of so delicate a Dame, Motives sufficient to his youth had beene, But to be Lord of Kingdomes by the same, And of so great and absolute a Queene, Soone gently stole him from himselfe away, That doth to him such rarities partake, Off'ring so rich, so excellent a prey, Loving the treason for the Traytors sake. But whilst he lived in this glorious vaine, Israel his conscience oftentimes doth move, That all this while in Egypt did remaine Vertue and grace o'recomming youth and love. And though God knowes unwilling to depart, From so high Empire wherein now he stood, And her that sate so neere unto his heart, Such power hath Israel in his happie blood, By skill to quit him forcibly he wrought, As he was learn'd and traded in the starres, Both by the Hebrewes, and th'Egyptians taught, That were the first, the best Astronomers, Two sundry figures makes, whereof the one Cause them that weare it all things past forget, As th'other of all accidents foregone Comester ex Vet. Script. The memory as eagerly doth whet. Which he insculped in two likely stones, For rarenesse of invaluable price, And cunningly contriv'd them for the nones In likely rings of excellent devise: That of oblivion giving to his Queene, Which soone made show the violent effect Forgot him straight as he had never beene, And did her former kindenesses neglect. The other (that doth memorie assist) Him with the love of Israel doth enflame, Departing thence not how the Princesse wist, In peace he leaves her as in warre he came. But all the pleasures of th'Egyptian Court, Had not such power upon his springing yeeres, As had the sad and tragicall report Of the rude burdens captiv'd Israel beares, Nor what regards he to be grac'd of Kings? Or flatred greatnes idely to awaite? Or what respects he the negotiating Matters comporting Emperie and State? The bondage and servilitie that lay On buried Israel (sunke in ordurous slime) His greeved spirit downe heavily doth way, That to leane care oft leant the prosperous time. A wreched Hebrew hap'ned to behold Brus'd with sad burdens without all remorse By an Egyptian barb'rously controlde, Spurning his pin'd and miserable corse Which he beholding vexed as he stood, His faire veines swelling with impatient fire, Pittie and rage so wrestled in his blood To get free passage to conceaved ire, Rescuing the man th'Egyptian doth resist: (Which from his vile hands forcibly he tooke) And by a strong blowe with his valiant fist, His hatefull breath out of his nostrils strooke, Which though his courage boldly dare averre, In the proud power of his Emperious hand, Yet from high honour deigneth to interre, The wretched carkasse in the smouldring sand. Which then supposd in secret to be wrought, Yet still hath Envie such a jealous eye, As foorth the same incontinent it sought, And to the King delivered by and by, Which soone gave vent to Pharo's covered wrath, Which till this instant reason did confine, Opening a strait way, and apparant path Unto that greate and terrible designe: Most for his safety forcing his retreate When now affliction every day did breed, And when revengfull tyrannie did threate The greatest horrour to the Hebrew seed. To Midian now his Pilgrimage he tooke, Midian earthes onely Paradice for pleasures, Where many a soft Rill, many a sliding Brooke, Through the sweet vallies trip in wanton measures, Whereas the curl'd Groves and the flowrie fields, To his free soule so peaceable and quiet More true delight and choise contentment yeelds, Than Egipts braveries and luxurious diet: And wandring long he hap'ned on a Well, Which he by pathes frequented might espie, Bordred with trees where pleasure seem'd to dwell, Where to repose him, eas'ly downe doth lie: Where the soft windes did mutually embrace, In the coole Arbours Nature there had made, Fanning their sweet breath gently in his face Through the calme cincture of the am'rous shade. Till now it nigh'd the noone-stead of the day, When scorching heat the gadding Heards do grieve, When Shepheards now and Heardsmen every way, Their thirsting Cattell to the Fountaine drive: Amongst the rest seven Shepheardesses went Along the way for watring of their Sheepe, Whose eyes him seemed such reflection sent, As made the Flocks even white that they did keepe: Girles that so goodly and delightfull were, The fields were fresh and fragrant in their viewe, Winter was as the Spring time of the yeere, The grasse so proud that in their footsteps grewe: Daughters they were unto a holy man, (And worthy too of such a Sire to be) Jethro the Priest of fertile Midian, Few found so just, so righteous men as he. But see the rude Swaine, the untutour'd slave, Without respect or rev'rence to their kinde, Away their faire flocks from the water drave, Such is the nature of the barb'rous Hinde. The Maides (perceaving where a stranger sat) Of whom those Clownes so basely did esteeme, Were in his presence discontent thereat, Whom hee perhaps improvident might deeme. Which he perceaving kindely doth entreate, Reproves the Rusticks for that off'red wrong, Averring it an injurie too great, To such (of right) all kindenesse did belong. But finding well his Oratorie faile, His fists about him frankly he bestowes, That where perswasion could not late prevaile, He yet compelleth quickly by his blowes. Entreates the Dam'sels their aboade to make, (With Courtly semblance and a manly grace,) At their faire pleasures quietly to take, What might be had by freedome of the place. Whose beautie, shape, and courage they admire, Exceeding these, the honour of his minde, For what in mortall could their hearts desire, That in this man they did not richly finde? Returning sooner then their usuall hower, All that had hapned to their Father tould, That such a man reliev'd them by his power, As one all civill curtesie that could: Who full of bountie hospitably meeke Of his behaviour greatly pleas'd to heare, Forthwith commands his servants him to seeke, To honour him by whom his honour'd were: Gently receives him to his goodly seat, Feasts him his friends and families among, And him with all those offices entreat, That to his place and vertues might belong: Whilst in the beauty of those goodly Dames, Wherein wise Nature her owne skill admires, He feeds those secret and impiercing flames, Nurs'd in fresh youth, and gotten in desires: Wonne with this man this princely Priest to dwell, For greater hire then bounty could devise, For her whose prayse makes prayse it selfe excell, Fairer then fairenesse, and as wisedome wise. In her, her Sisters severally were seene, Of every one she was the rarest part, Who in her presence any time had beene, Her Angell eye transpierced not his heart? For Zipora a Shepheards life he leads, And in her sight deceives the subtill howres, And for her sake oft robs the flowrie meades, With those sweet spoiles t'enrich her rurall bowres. Up to mount Horeb with his flocke he tooke, The flocke wise Jethro willed him to keepe, Which well he garded with his Shepheards crooke, Goodly the Shepheard, goodly were the Sheepe: To feede and folde full warily he knew, From Fox and Wolfe his wandring flockes to free, The goodli'st flowers that in the meadowes grew Were not more fresh and beautifull than hee. Gently his fayre flockes lessow'd he along, Through the Frim pastures freely at his leasure, Now on the hills, the vallies then among, Which seeme themselves to offer to his pleasure. Whilst featherd Silvans from each blooming spray, With murm'ring waters wistly as they creepe, Make him such musicke (to abridge the way,) As fits a Shepheard company to keepe. When loe that great and fearefull God of might To that faire Hebrew strangely doth appeare, In a bush burning visible and bright Yet unconsuming as no fire there were: With hayre erected and upturned eyes, Whilst he with great astonishment admires, Loe that eternall Rector of the skies, Thus breathes to Moyses from those quickning fires, Shake off thy Sandals (saith the thund'ring God) With humbled feet my wondrous power to see. For that the soyle where thou hast boldly trod, Is most select and hallowed unto me: The righteous Abraham for his God me knew, Isaac and Jacob trusted in mine Name, And did beleeve my Covenant was true, Which to their seed shall propagate the same: My folke that long in Egypt had beene bard, Whose cries have entred heavens eternall gate, Our zealous mercy openly hath heard, Kneeling in teares at our eternall State. And am come downe, them in the Land to see, Where streames of milke through batfull Valleys flow, And lushious hony dropping from the tree, Load the full flow'rs that in the shadowes grow: By thee my power am purposed to trie, That from rough bondage shalt the Hebrewes bring, Bearing that great and fearfull Embassie To that Monarchall and Emperious King. And on this Mountaine (standing in thy sight,) When thou returnest from that conquered Land, Thou hallow'd Altars unto me shalt light, This for a token certainly shall stand. O who am I? this wondring man replies, A wretched mortall that I should be sent, And stand so cleere in thine eternall eyes, To doe a worke of such astonishment: And trembling now with a transfixed heart, Humbling himselfe before the Lord (quoth hee) Who shall I tell the Hebrewes that thou art, That giv'st this large commission unto me? Say (quoth the Spirit from that impetuous flame) Unto the Hebrewes asking thee of this, That 'twas, I Am: which onely is my Name, God of their Fathers, so my Title is: Divert thy course to Goshen then againe, And to divulge it constantly be bold, And their glad eares attractively retaine, With what at Sinay Abrahams God hath told: And tell great Pharo, that the Hebrewes God Commands from Egypt that he set you free, Three journies thence in Desarts farre abroad, To offer hallow'd sacrifice to mee. But he refusing to dismisse you so, On that proud King Ile execute such force As never yet came from the Sling, the Bow, The keen-edg'd Curt'lax, or the puisant Horse; But if th'afflicted miserable sort To idle incredulity inclin'd, Shall not (quoth Moyses) credit my report, That thou to me hast so great power assign'd. Cast downe (saith God) thy Wand unto the ground, Which hee obaying fearefully, beholde The same a Serpent sodainly was found, It selfe contorting into many a folde. With such amazement Moyses doth surprise With colde convulsions shrinking every vaine, That his affrighted and uplifted eyes Even shot with horrour, sinke into his braine. But being encourag'd by the Lord to take The ugly taile into his trembling hand, As from a dreame he sudainely doth wake, When at the instant it became a wand. By the same hand into his bosome shut, Whose eyes his withered leprosie abhor'd, When forth he drewe it secondly be'ng put, Unto the former puritie restor'd. These signes he gives this sad admiring man, Which he the weake incredulous should showe, When this fraile mortall freshly now began To forge new causes, why unfit to goe? Egypt accusing to have done him wrong, Scantling that bountie Nature had bestow'd, Which had welnere depriv'd him of his tong, Which to this office chiefely had beene ow'd: When he whose wisdome Nature must obey, In whose resistance reason weakely failes, To whom all humane instances give way, Gainst whom not subtill Argument prevailes Thus doth reprove this idle vaine excuse, Who made the mouth? who th'eie? or who the eare? Or who deprives those organs of their use? That thou thy imbecillitie should'st feare? Thy brother Aaron commeth unto thee, Which as thy Speaker purposely I bring, To whom thy selfe even as a God shalt bee, And he interpret to th'Egyptian King. That when he at thy miracles shall wonder, And wan with feare shall tremble at thy rod, To feele his power that swayes the dreadfull thunder, That is a jealous and a fearefull God. Then shall mine owne selfe purchase me renowne, And win me honour by my glorious deede On all the Pharo's on th'Egyptian throne, That this proud mortall ever shall succeede. THE SECOND BOOKE. The Argument. Moyses doth his message bring, Acts miracles before the King, With him the Magi doe contend, Which he doth conquer in the end, When by the extensure of the wand, He brings ten plagues upon the Land, And in despight of Pharo's pride, From Goshen doth the Hebrewes guide. When now from Midian Moses forward set, With whom his wife &amp; faire retinew went, Where on his way him happily hath met His brother Aron to the Lords intent, And to the Hebrewes in th'impatient hand, Of mighty Egypt all his power implies, And as the Lord expresly did command, Acteth his wonders in their pleased eyes. Those myracles mortality beholds With an astonish'd and distracted looke, The minde that so amazedly enfolds, That every sense the faculty forsooke. The little Infant with abundant joy, To mans estate immediatly is sprung, And though the old man could not back turne boy, Casts halfe his yeeres so much becomming yong, Whilst mirth in fulnesse measureth every eye, Each breast is heap'd up with excesse of pleasure, Rearing their spred hands to the glorious Skie, Gladly imbracing the Almighties leasure. These Hebrewes entring the Egyptian Court, Their great Commission publiquely proclaime, Which there repulsed as a slight report, Doth soone denounce defiance to the same. Where now these men their miracles commend, By which their power precisely might be tride, And Pharo for his Sorcerers doth send, By them the Hebrewes only to deride. Where Heaven must now apparantly transcend Th'infernall powers Emperiously to thwart, And the bright perfect Deitie contend With abstruse Magicke and fallacious Art. Never was so miraculous a strife Where admiration ever so abounded, Where wonders were so prodigally rife, That to behold it Nature stood confounded. Casting his rod a Serpent that became, Which he suppos'd with marvaile them might strike, When every Priest assaying in the same, By his black skill did instantly the like: Which Pharo's breast with arrogance doth fill, Above the high Gods to exalt his power, When by his might (t'amate their weaker skill) The Hebrewes rod doth all the rods devoure: Which deed of wonder slightly he rejects, His froward Spirit insatiatly elate, Which after caus'd those violent effects That sate on Egypt with the power of Fate. When he whose wisdome ere the world did fare, From whom not counsell can her secrets hide, Forewarneth Moses early to prepare T'accost the proud King by the rivers side. What heavenly rapture doth enrich my braine, And through my blood extravagantly flowes, That doth transport me to that endlesse maine, Whereas th'Almighty his high glories showes? That holy heat into my Spirit infuse, Wherewith thou wont'st thy Prophets to inspire, And lend that power to our delightfull Muse, As dwelt in sounds of that sweet Hebruack Lyre. A taske unusuall I must now assay, Striving through perill to support this masse, No former foot did ever tract a way, Where I propose unto my selfe to passe. When Moses meeting the Egyptian King, Urgeth a fresh the Israelites depart, And him by Aaron stoutly menacing, To try the temper of his stubborne heart. When loe the Torrent the fleet hurrying flood The 1. Plague. So cleere and perfect Christalline at hand, As a black lake or setled marish stood At th'extensure of the Hebrewes wand. Where Segs, ranck Bulrush, and the sharpned Reed That with the fluxure of the wave is fed, Might be discern'd unnaturally to bleed, Dying their fresh greene to a sullied red: Like issuing ulcers every little Spring, That being ripened voyd the filthy core, Their lothsome slime and matter vomiting Into the Rivers they enrich'd before: What in her banks hath batning Nilus bred, Serpent, or Fish, or strange deformed thing That on her bosome she not beareth dead, Where they were borne them lastly burying? That Bird and Beast incontinently fly From the detested and contagious stinke, And rather choose by cruell thirst to dye, Then once to taste of this contaminate drinke, And usefull Cisternes delicatly fild, With which rich Egypt wondrously abounds, Looking as Bowles receiving what was spild From mortall and immedicable wounds. That the faint earth even poys'ned now remaines, In her owne selfe so grievously dejected, Horrid pollution travailing her vaines, Desp'rate of cure so dangerously infected The spungy soyle, that digging deepe and long To soke cleere liquor from her plenteous pores, This bloody issue breaketh out among, As sickly menstrues or inveterate sores: Seven dayes continuing in this flux of blood, Sadly sits Egypt a full weeke of woe, Shame taints the brow of every stew and flood, Blushing, the world her filthinesse to show. Yet sdaines proud Pharo Israel thus to free, Nor this dire plague his hardned heart can tame, Which he suppos'd but fallaces to bee, When his Magitians likewise did the same. When he againe that glorious Rod extends 'Gainst him that Heaven denieth thus to dare, On Egypt soone a second plague that sends, Which he till now seem'd partially to spare. The soyle, that late the owner did enrich Him his faire Heards and goodly flocks to feed, Lies now a leystall or a common ditch, Where in their Todder loathly Paddocks breed. Where as the up-land montanous and hie To them that sadly doe behold it showes, As though in labour with this filthy frie, Stirring with paine in the parturious throwes: People from windowes looking to the ground, At this stupendious spectacle amazed, See but their sorrow every where abound, That most abhorring whereon most they gazed. Their Troughes and Ovens Toadstooles now become, That Huswifes wont so carefully to keepe, These loathsome creatures taking up the roome, And croking, there continually doe creepe. And as great Pharo on his Throne is set, From thence affrighted with this odious thing, Which crawling up into the same doth get, And him deposing sitteth as a King. The wearied man his spirits that to refresh Gets to his bed to free him from his feare, Scarce laid but feeles them at his naked flesh, So small the succour that remaineth there. No Court so close to which the speckled Toad By some small cranny creepes not by and by, No Tower so strong nor naturall aboad, To which for safety any one might fly: Egypt now hates the world her so should call, Of her owne selfe so grievously asham'd, And so contemned in the eyes of all, As but in scorne she scarcely once is nam'd. When this prophane King with a wounded heart (His Magi though these miracles could doe) Sees in his soule one greater then their Art, Above all power, that put a hand thereto: But as these plagues and sad afflictions ceas'd At the just prayer of this milde godlike man, So Pharoes pride and stubbornesse encreas'd, And his lewd course this head-strong Mortall ran. Which might have surelier setled in his minde, (At his request which Moses quickly slew, Leaving a stench so pestilent behinde) As might preserve old sorrowes freshly new. But stay my Muse in height of all this speed, Somewhat plucks back to quench this sacred heat, And many perils doth to us areed In that whereof we seriously entreat. Lest too concise injuriously we wrong Things that such state and fearfulnesse impart, Or led by zeale irregularly long, Infringe the curious liberties of Art, We that calumnious Critick may eschew, That blasteth all things with his poys'ned breath, Detracting what laboriously we doe, Onely with that which he but idely saith. O be our guide whose glories now we preach, That above Bookes must steere us in our Fate, For never Ethnick to this day did teach, (In this) whose method we might imitate. When now these men of miracle proceed, And by extending of that wondrous wand, As that resistlesse providence decreed, Thereby brings Lyce on the distemp'red Land: All struck with Lyce so numberlesse they lie, The 3 Plague. The dust growne quick in every place doth creepe, The sands their want doe secondly supply, As they at length would suffocate the Deepe: That th'atomi that in the beames appeare, As they the Sunne through cranies shining see, The forme of those detested things doe beare, So miserable the Egyptians bee: Who rak'd the brands the passed Evening burn'd, (As is the use the Mornings fire to keepe) To these foule vermine findes the ashes turn'd, Covering the Harth, so thick thereon they creepe: Now Prince and pesant equally are drest, The costliest silkes and coursest rags alike, The worst goes now companion with the best, The hand of God so generally doth strike. The Kings Pavillion and the Captives pad Are now in choice indifferent unto either, Great, small, faire, foule, rich, poore, the good and bad Doe suffer in this pestilence together, In vaine to cleanse, in vaine to purge, and pick, When every Moath that with the breath doth rise, Forthwith appeareth venemously quick, Although so small scarce taken by the eyes. By which his wisdome strongly doth prevaile, When this selfe-wise, this overweening man, Even in the least, the slightest thing doth faile, The very beggar absolutely can, When now these Wizards with transfixed hearts To make his glory by the same the more, Confesse a Godhead shining through their Arts, Which by their Magicks they deni'd before. Yet this proud Pharo as oppugning fate, Still doth resist that Majestie so hie, And to himselfe doth yet appropriate A supreame power his Godhead to deny. When from his wilfull stubbornesse doth grow That great amazement to all eares and eyes, When now the Lord by Aarons Rod will show His mighty power even in the wretched'st Flies, Varying his vengeance in as many kindes, As Pharo doth his obstinacies vary, Suting his plagues so fitly with their mindes, As though their sinne his punishments did cary. In Summer time as in an Evening faire, The Gnats are heard in a tumultuous sound On tops of hils, so troubled is the ayre To the disturbance of the wondring ground. The skies are darkned as they yet doe hover In so grosse clouds congested in their flight, That the whole Land with multitudes they cover, Stopping the streames as generally the light. O cruell Land, might these not yet thee move? Art thou alone so destitute of feare? Or dost thou meane thy utmost to approve How many plagues thou able art to beare? Three have forethreatned thy destruction sure, And now the fourth is following on as fast, Dost thou suppose thy pride can still endure? Or that his vengeance longer cannot last? These are as weake and worthlesse as the rest, Thou much infeebled, and his strength is more, Fitly prepar'd thee sadly to infest Thy sinnes so many, by their equall store. This wretched creature man might well suppose To be the least that he had need to feare, Amongst the rest is terrifi'd with those With which before none ever troubled were. As we behold a swarming cast of Bees In a swolne cluster to some branch to cleave: Thus doe they hang in bunches on the trees, Pressing each plant, and loading ev'ry greave. The houses covered with these must'ring Flies, And the faire windowes that for light were made, Eclips'd with horror, seeming to their eyes Like the dimme twilight, or some ominous shade. For humane food what Egypt had in store, The creatures feed on, till they bursting die, And what in this unhappy Land was more, Their loathsome bodies lastly putrifie. O goodly Goshen where the Hebrewes rest, How deare thy children in th'Almighties sight, That for their sakes thou onely should'st be blest, When all these plagues on the Egyptians light? What promis'd people rested thee within, To whom no perill ever might aspire, For whose deare sake some watchfull Cherubin Stood to defend thee arm'd in glorious fire? Thou art that holy Sanctuary made, Where all th'afflicted cast aside their feare, Whose priviledges ever to invade, The Heavens command their horrors to forbeare. But since mans pride and insolence is such, Nor by these plagues his will to passe could bring, Now with a sharpe and wounding hand will touch The dearer body of each living thing: To other ends his courses to direct, By all great meanes his glory to advance, Altreth the cause by altring the effect, To worke by wonder their deliverance. As Aaron grasping ashes in his hand, Which scarcely cast into the open aire, But brings a murraine over all the Land, The 5. Plague.With scabs and botches such as never were. What chewes the cud, or hoofe or horne alotted, Wild in the fields, or tamed by the yoke, With this contagious pestilence is rotted, So universall's the Almighties stroke. The goodly Horse of hot and fiery straine In his high courage hardly brook'd his food, That Ditch or Mound not lately could containe, On the firme ground so scornfully that stood, Crest-falne hangs downe his hardly manag'd head, Lies where but late disdainfully he trod, His quick eye fixed heavily and dead, Stirres not when prick'd with the impulsive goad. The Swine which Nature secretly doth teach, Onely by fasting sicknesses to cure, Now but in vaine is to it selfe a Leech, Whose suddaine end infallibly is sure. Where frugall Shepheards reckoning wooll and lambe, Or who by Heards hop'd happily to winne, Now sees the young-one perish with the damme, Nor dare his hard hand touch the poys'ned skinne. Those fertile pastures quickly over-spread With their dead Cattell, where the birds of prey Gorg'd on the garbidge (wofully bestead) Pois'ned fall downe as they would fly away. And hungry dogs the tainted flesh refrain'd, Whereon their Master gormondiz'd of late, What Nature for mans appetite ordain'd, The creature that's most ravenous doth hate. Thus all that breathes and kindly hath encrease, Suffer for him that proudly did offend, Yet in this manner here it shall not cease, The 6 Plague. In Beasts begun, in wretched man to end. To whom it further violently can, Not by th'Almighty limited to slake, As Beast is plagued for rebellious man, Man in some measure must his paine partake. Those dainty breasts that open'd lately were, Which with rich vaines so curiously did flow, With Biles and Blaines most loathsome doe appeare, Which now the Dam'zell not desires to show. Features disfigur'd onely now the faire, (All are deformed) most ill-favour'd be, Where beautie was most exquisite and rare, There the least blemish easili'st you might see. For costly garments fashion'd with device To forme each choise part curious eyes to please, The sicke mans Gowne is onely now in price To give their bloch'd and blistred bodies ease, It is in vaine the Surgeons hand to prove, Or helpe of Physicke to asswage the smart, For why the power that ruleth from above Crosseth all meanes of industrie and Art. Egypt is now an Hospitall forlorne, Where onely Cripples and diseased are, How many Children to the world are borne, So many Lazers thither still repaire. When those proud Magi as oppos'd to Fate, That durst high Heav'n in ev'ry thing to dare, Now in most vile and miserable state As the mean'st Caitive equally doe fare. Thus stands that man so eminent alone, Arm'd with his power that governeth the skie, Now when the Wizards lastly overthrowne, Groveling in sores before his feete doe lie. Not one is found unpunished escapes So much to doe his hungry wrath to feede, Which still appeareth in as many shapes As Pharaoh doth in tyrannies proceede. Even as some grave wise Magistrate to finde Out some vile treason, or some odious crime A similie of Gods justice.That beareth every circumstance in minde, Of place, of manner, instance, and of time: That the suspected strongly doth arest, And by all meanes invention can devise By hopes or torture out of him to wrest The ground, the purpose, and confederacies, Now slacks his paine, now doth the same augment, Yet in his strait hand doth containe him still, Proportioning his allotted punishment As hee's remoov'd or pliant to his will. But yet hath Egypt somewhat left to vaunt, What's now remaining, may her pride repaire, But lest she should perhaps be arrogant, Till she be humbled he will never spare. These plagues seeme yet but nourished beneath, And even with man terrestrially to move, Now Heaven his furie violently shall breath, Rebellious Egypt scourging from above. Winter let loose in his robustious kinde The 7. Plague. Wildly runnes raving through the airie plaines, As though his time of liberty assign'd Roughly now shakes off his impris'ning chaines. The windes spet fire in one anothers face, And mingled flames fight furiously together, Through the mild Heaven that one the other chace, Now flying thence and then returning thether. No light but lightning ceaselesly to burne Swifter than thought from place to place to passe, And being gone doth sodainly returne Ere you could say precisely that it was. In one selfe moment darkenesse and the light Instantly borne, as instantly they die, And every minute is a day and night That breakes and sets in twinkling of an eye. Mountaine and valley suffer one selfe ire, The stately Tower and lowlie coate alike, The shrub and Cedar this impartiall fire In one like order generally doth strike, On flesh and plant this subtill lightning praies, As through the pores it passage fitly findes, In the full wombe the tender burthen slaies, Piercing the stiffe trunke through the spungie rindes. Throughout this great and universall Ball The wrath of Heaven outragiously is throwne, As the lights quickning and Celestiall, Had put themselves together into one. This yet continuing the big-bellied clouds, With heate and moisture in their fulnesse brake, And the sterne Thunder from the ayrie shrouds To the sad world in feare and horrour spake. The blacke storme bellowes and the yerning vault, Full charg'd with furie as some signall given, Preparing their artillirie t'assault, Shoot their sterne vollies in the face of Heaven. The bolts new wing'd with fork'd Æthereall fire, Through the vast Region every where doe rove, Goring the earth in their impetuous ire, Pierce the proud'st building, rend the thickest Grove. When the breeme Haile as rising in degrees Like ruffled arrowes through the aire doth sing, Beating the leaves and branches from the trees, Forcing an Autumne earlier than the Spring. The Birds late shrouded in their safe repaire, Where they were wont from Winters wrath to rest, Left by the tempest to the open aire Shot with cold bullets through the trembling brest: Whilst cattell grasing on the batfull ground, Finding no shelter from the showre to hide In ponds and ditches willingly are drownd, That this sharpe storme no longer can abide: Windowes are shivered to forgotten dust, The slates fall shatt'red from the roofe above, Where any thing findes harbour from this gust, Now even as death it feareth to remove. The rude and most impenitrable rocke Since the foundation of the world was laid, Never before stir'd with tempestuous shocke, Melts with this storme as sensibly afraid. Never yet with so violent a hand, A brow contracted and so full of feare, God scourg'd the pride of a rebellious Land, Since into Kingdomes Nations gathered were. But he what Mortall was there ever knowne, So many strange afflictions did abide On whom so many miseries were throwne, Whom Heaven so oft and angerly did chide? Who but relenting Moyses doth relieve? Taking off that which oft on him doth light, Whom God so oft doth punish and forgive, Thereby to prove his mercy and his might. So that eternall providence could frame The meane whereby his glory should be tride, That as he please, miraculously can tame Mans sensuall wayes, his transitorie pride. But Pharaoh bent to his rebellious will, His hate to Israel instantly renues, Continuing Author of his proper ill, When now the plague of Grashoppers ensues. Long ere they fell, on 'th face of Heaven they hong, In so vast clouds as covered all the skies, The 8. Plague. Colouring the Sun-beames piercing through their throng, With strange distraction to beholding eyes. This idle creature that is said to sing In wanton Sommer, and in Winter poore, Praising the Emmets painefull labouring, Now eates the labourer and the heaped store. No blade of grasse remaineth to be seene, Weed, hearb, nor flower, to which the Spring gives birth, Yet ev'ry path even barren hills are greene, With those that eate the greenenesse from the earth. What is most sweet, what most extreamely sowre, The loathsome Hemlock as the verdurous Rose, These filthy Locusts equally devoure, So doe the Heavens of every thing dispose. The trees all barcklesse nakedly are left Like people stript of things that they did weare, By the enforcement of disastrous theft, Standing as frighted with erected haire. Thus doth the Lord her nakednesse discover, Thereby to prove her stoutnesse to reclaime, That when nor feare, nor punishment could move her, She might at length be tempred with her shame. Disrob'd of all her ornament she stands, Wherein rich Nature whilome did her dight, That the sad verges of the neighbouring lands Seeme with much sorrow wondring at the sight. But Egypt is so impudent and vile, No blush is seene that pittie might compell, That from all eyes to cover her awhile, The Lord in darkenesse leaveth her to dwell. Over the great and universall face The 9. Plague. Are drawne the Curtaines of the horrid night, As it would be continually in place, That from the world had banished the light. As to the sight, so likewise to the tuch Th'appropriate object equally is dealt, Darkenesse is now so palpable and much, That as 'tis seene, as easily is felt. Who now it hap'd to travell by the way, Or in the field did chance abroad to rome, Loosing himselfe then wandred as a stray, Nor findes his hostrie, nor returneth home. The Cocke the Country horologe that rings, The cheerefull warning to the Sunnes awake, Missing the dawning scantles in his wings, And to his Roost doth sadly him betake. One to his neighbour in the darke doth call, When the thicke vapour so the aire doth smother, Making the voyce so hideous there withall, That one's afeard to goe unto the other. The little Infant for the Mother shreekes, Then lyes it downe astonished with feare, Who for her Childe whilst in the darke she seekes, Treads on the Babe that she doth holde so deare. Darkenesse so long upon the Land doth dwell, Whilst men amaz'd, the houres are stolne away, Erring in time that now there's none can tell, Which should be night, and which should be the day. Three doubled nights the proud Egyptian lyes With hunger, thirst, and wearinesse opprest, Onely relieved by his miseries, By feare enforced to forget the rest. Those lights and fires they laboured to defend With the foule dampe that over all doth flowe Such an eclipsed sullidnesse doth send, That darkenesse farre more terrible doth show: When this perplexed and astonish'd King 'Twixt rage and feare distracted in his minde, Israel to passe now freely limiting, Onely their cattell to be staid behinde. Commanding Moyses to depart his sight, And from that time to see his face no more, Which this milde man doth willingly aquite That he well knew would come to passe before. That for the Droves the Israelites should leave, Forbid by Pharaoh to be borne away: Israel shall Egypt of her store bereave, To beare it with her as a violent prey: So wrought her God in the Egyptians thought, As he is onely provident and wise, That he to passe for his choise people brought, More than mans wisedome ever might devise. Touching their soft breasts with a wounding love Of those who yet they enviously admir'd, Which doth the happy Jacobites behove, To compasse what they instantly requir'd, That every Hebrew borrowed of a friend, Some speciall Jewell fainedly to use, Every Egyptian willing is to lend, Nor being ask'd can possibly refuse. Now Closets, Chests, and Cabinets are sought For the rich Jem, the raritie, or thing, And they the happiest of the rest are thought, That the high'st priz'd officiously could bring. Rings, chaines, and bracelets, jewels for the eare, The perfect glorious, and most lustrous stone, The Carcanet so much requested there, The Pearle most orient, and a Paragon. What thing so choice that curious Art could frame, Luxurious Egypt had not for her pride? And what so rare an Israelite could name, That he but asking was thereof denide? When God doth now the Passeover command, Whose name that sacred mysterie doth tell, That he pass'd o'r them with a sparefull hand, When all the first-borne of th'Egyptians fell, Which should to their posteritie be taught, That might for ever memorize this deede, The fearefull wonders he in Egypt wrought, For Abrahams off-spring Sarahs promis'd seede. A Lambe unblemish'd, or a spotlesse Kid, That from the dam had wained out a yeere, Which he without deformitie did bid, Held to himselfe a sacrifice so deere. Rosted and eaten with unleav'ned bread, And with sowre hearbs such viands as became, Meate for the Ev'ning, that prohibited The Morne ensuing partner of the same. Girding their loynes, shooes fastned to their feete, Staves in their hands, and passing it to take, In manner as to travailers is meete, A voyage forth immediately to make. Whose bloud being put upon the utmost posts, Whereby his chosen Israelites he knew, That night so dreadfull, when the Lord of Hosts All the first borne of the Egyptians slew. The 10. Plague.Darkenesse invades the world, when now forth went The spoiling Angell as the Lord did will, And where the dore with bloud was not besprent, There the first borne he cruelly did kill. Night never saw so tragicall a deed, Thing so repleate with heavinesse and sorrow, Nor shall the day hereafter ever reade, Such a blacke time as the insuing morrow. The dawne now breaking, and with open sight When every lab'ring and affrighted eye Beholds the slaughter of the passed night, The parting plague protracted miserie. One to his neighbour hasts his heedlesse feete, To bring him home his heavie chance to see, And him he goes to by the way doth meete, As grieved and as miserable as he. Who out of dore now hastily doth come, Thinking to howle and bellow forth his woe, Is for his purpose destitute of roome, Each place with sorrow doth so overflow. People awaked with this sodaine fright, Runne forth their dores as naked as they be, Forget the day, and bearing candle light To helpe the Sunne their miseries to see. Who lost his first borne ere this plague begun, Is now most happy in this time of woe, Who mourn'd his eld'st a daughter or a sonne, Is now exempt from what the rest must doe. To one that faines poore comfort to his friend, His Childe was young and neede the lesse be car'd, Replies if his had liv'd the others end, Withall his heart he could him well have spar'd. No eye can lend a mourning friend one teare, So busie is the gen'rall heart of moane, So strange confusion sits in every eare, As wanteth power to entertaine his owne. Imparted woe (the heavie hearts reliefe) When it hath done the utmost that it may, Outright is murth'red with a second griefe, To see one mute tell more than it can say: The greatest blessing that the heart could give, The joy of Children in the married state, To see his curse the parent now doth live, And none be happy but th'infortunate. Whilst some for buriall of their Children stay, Others passe by with theirs upon the Beere, Which from the Church meet Mourners by the way, Others they finde that yet are burying there. Afflicted London, in sixe hundred three, When God thy sinne so grievously did strike, And from th'infection that did spring from thee, The spacious Ile was patient of the like. That sickly season, when I undertooke This composition faintly to supply, When thy affliction serv'd me for a booke, Whereby to modell Egypts miserie, When pallid horrour did possesse thy streete, Nor knew thy Children refuge where to have, Death them so soone in every place did meete, Unpeopling houses to possesse the grave. When wofull Egypt with a wounded heart So many plagues that suffered for their stay, Now on their knees entreate them to depart, And even impatient of their long delay. Sixe hundred thousand Israelites depart, Besides the Nations that they thence releas'd, And Hebrew Babes the joy of many a heart, That Sarahs happie promises had bless'd. After foure hundred thirtie yeeres expir'd, (Measuring by minutes many a wofull houre) That day they came they thence againe depart, By his eternall providence and power. With all the jewels Egypt could afford With them away that wisely they did beare, Th'Egyptians aske not to have backe restor'd, All then so busie at their burials were: Comester in Exod.And Josephs bones precisely thence convay, Whose Tombe by Nyl's oft Inundations drown'd, (Yet the deceased straitlie to obay) By Moyses was miraculously found. Tetragrammaton.Who did in gold that powerfull word ingrave, By which th'Almighty fully is exprest, Which bare the mettall floting on the wave, Till o'r his Coffin lastly it did rest. As by a sheepe that shew'd them to the same, To make them mindfull of the reverent dead, Which Beast thence-forth they called by Josephs name, And when they went from Egypt with them led. But that he thus did finde his burying place, As we tradition wisely may suspect, We onely this as Historie embrace, But else in faith as fabulous neglect. THE THIRD BOOKE. The Argument. God drownes th'Egyptians in his ire, Doth march before his host in fire, From the hard rocks strikes gushing springs, Raines Quailes and Manna, conquers Kings, And fearefull plagues on them doth trie, For murm'ring and idolatrie: Unto the promis'd Land them brought, When it they fortie yeeres had sought; Balaam to blesse them he doth send, Their good successe, milde Moyses end. Those which at home scorn'd Pharaoh and his force, And whose departure he did humbly pray, He now pursues with his Egyptian horse And warlike foote to spoile them on the way. Where his choice people strongly to protect, The onely God of Emperie and might, Before his host his standard doth erect, A glorious pillar in a field of light, Which he by day in sable doth unfolde, To dare the Sonne his Ardour to forbeare, By night converts it into flaming golde, Away the coldnesse of the same to feare. Not by Philistia he his force will leade, Though the farre nearer and the happier way, His men of warre a glorious march shall tread On the vast bowels of the bloudie Sea, And sends the windes as Currers forth before To make them way from Pharaohs power to flie, And to convay them to a safer shore, Such is his might that can make Oceans drie. Which by the stroke of that commanding wand, Shouldred the rough seas forcibly together, Raised as Rampiers by that glorious hand, (Twixt which they march) that did conduct them thither. The surly waves their Rulers will obay'd By him made up in this confused masse, Like as an Ambush secretly were laid, To set on Pharaoh as his power should passe, Which soone with wombes insatiably wide, Loos'd from their late bounds by th'Almighties power, Come raging in, enclosing every side, And the Egyptians instantly devoure. The Sling, the stiffe Bow, and the sharpned Launce, Floting confus'dly on the waters rude, They which these weapons lately did advance, Perish in sight of them that they pursude. Clashing of Armours, and the rumorous sound Of the sterne billowes in contention stood, Which to the shores doe every way rebound, As doth affright the Monsters of the flood. Death is discern'd triumphantly in Armes On the rough Seas his slaughtery to keepe, And his colde selfe in breath of mortals warmes, Upon the dimpled bosome of the deepe. There might you see a Checkquer'd Ensigne swim About the bodie of the envi'd dead, Serve for a hearse or coverture to him, Ere while did waft it proudly 'bout his head: The warlike Chariot turn'd upon the backe With the dead horses in their traces tide, Drags their fat carkasse through the fomie bracke That drew it late undauntedly in pride. There floats the bard Steed with his Rider drownd, Whose foot in his caparison is cast, Who late with sharpe spurs did his Courser wound, Himselfe now ridden with his strangled beast. The waters conquer (without helpe of hand) For them to take for which they never toile, And like a Quarrie cast them on the land, As those they slew they left to them to spoile. In eightie eight at Dover that had beene, To view that Navie (like a mighty wood) Whose sailes swept Heaven, might eas'lie there have seene, How puissant Pharaoh perish'd in the floud. What for a conquest strictly they did keepe, Into the channell presently was pour'd, Castilian riches scattered on the deepe, That Spaines long hopes had sodainly devour'd. Th'afflicted English rang'd along the Strand To waite what would this threatning power betide, Now when the Lord with a victorious hand In his high justice scourg'd th'Iberian pride. Hence three dayes march to Mara leades them on, Where Surs wilde Desarts as the Armie past Seemed as from their presence to have flowne, The mountaines stood so miserably agast. Where for with drought they hardly are bested, And the foule waters bitter as the gall, That they should through this wildernesse be led To thanklesse murm'ring presently they fall. God pointeth Moyses to a precious tree, Whose medc'nall branches cast into the lake, Of that rare vertue he approv'd to be, The waters sweet and delicate to make. Not that his hand stands any way in neede Of mediate meanes his purposes to bring, But that in state his wisedome will proceede To shew his power in every little thing. Nor Metaphysickes fully him confine, All measuring so immeasurably great, That doth in Nature every cause combine, This All in him so amply hath receate. Which might have learn'd them in this helpelesse case, With tribulations willingly to meete, When men with patience troubles doe embrace, How oftentimes it makes affliction sweete. And his free bountie fully now they found, As they from Mara for mount Sina made, Pitching in Elim in that plenteous ground Of pleasant fountaines and delicious shade. But as at Sur, so they againe at Sin, Before of thirst, of hunger now complaine, Wishing they might in Egypt still have bin, Where never famine all their time did raigne. When clouds of Quailes from the Arabian shore Upon the Campe immediately are sent, Which came so long and in such marv'lous store, That with their flight they smother'd every Tent: This glads the Ev'ning, each unto his rest, With soules even sated with these dainty Cates, And the great goodnesse of the Lord confest, That in like measure each participates. The morne strewes Manna all about the host (The meate of Angels) mortals to refresh, Candying the fresh grasse, as the Winters frost, Never such bread unto so dainty flesh. O Israel pampred with this heavenly food, Which else to Nations earthly he denies, To raise thy spirits, to rectifie thy blood With these so rare celestiall purities. Then the fat flesh-pots they so much desire, Whereon in Egypt gluttoning they fed, When they came hungry home from carrying mire, Which onely dulnesse, and grosse humours bred. Yet in the sweetnesse and th'abundant store, His power not so conclusively exprest, But who tooke most not capable of more Then in his Gomer he that gathered least. By night corrupting, each day gath'ring new, But for the Sabbath what they did provide, That day descended not that heavenly dewe, That as that day was onely sanctifide. Thence through those Desarts desolate and drie, They reach to Reph'dem where as they should passe, There was not found a fountaine farre nor nie, Such want of water every where there was. Thither the Lord by Moyses did them bring, His force the faithlesse Israelites might know, For even in the impossiblest thing, He most delights his wondrous might to show. Farre worse than Mara is this fruitlesse soile, For there were waters (bitter though they were) But here are none, though sought with ne're such toile, That they from murm'ring longer not forbeare. Commanding Moyses he should take the Rod, Wherewith in Egypt he such wonders wrought, For that most wise, that secret-seeing God Saw there were some thus reasoned in their thought. The misterie of that miraculous wand He did to plagues and fearefull things imply, That Aaron yet ne're tooke it in his hand, When worke of mercy was atchiev'd thereby. Therefore bids Moyses to this high intent, The same to use, they visibly might see, That this which erst had beene the instrument Of justice, so of clemencie to be. Which with a blow, the Cleeves in sunder crackt, As with an earthquake violently rent, Whence came so strong and rough a Cataract, That in the stones wore gutters as it went. The Springs spout forth such plenty, that withall Downe the slope sides it violently swept, So divers wayes, so various in the fall, Through every cranny the cleare water crept. In Pailes, Kits, Dishes, Basons, Pinboukes, Bowles, Their scorched bosomes merrily they baste, Untill this very howre their thirstie soules Never touch'd water of so sweet a taste. Scarcelie suffic'd but in the very neck Of this, 'tis bruted by the watchfull post, That the neere-bordring envious Amaleck, Was marching towards them with a mighty host, When he forth Josua from the rest doth draw, A man selected, of couragious spirit, Which Moyses with propheticke eye foresaw, Should be the man, his roome that should inherit. Commanding him to muster out of hand, And draw his forces presently to head, Against that proud Amalakite to stand, Which in the field a puissant Armie led. Whilst on rocke Horeb, with erected hand, Bearing the Rod up to the glorious skie, 'Twixt Hur and Aaron, Amrams sonne doth stand, Whilst both the hosts for victorie doe trie. When blades are brandish'd and the fight begun, Warres thundring horror trumpets doe proclaime, With the reflection of the radiant Sunne, Seemes to beholders as a generall flame. Much courage and dexteritie that day On either part sufficiently is showne, And on the earth full many a Souldier lay, Thrusting through danger to make good his owne. Here men might see how many a strenuous guide Striveth to make his enemie to bleede, Now the fierce vaward, then the rereward plide, As he perceiveth the Battalians neede. They fight the full day, he the Rod upheld, But when his strength by long continuing failes, Where as before the Israelites had queld, The adverse proud Amalakite prevailes. Whilst the two Hebrewes provident of harmes, Setting grave Moses downe upon a stone, And by their force support his wearied armes, Untill the foe was lastly overthrowne. Jethro the just to whom report had told, Th'atchievement wrought by his renowned sonne, That all the world did tributary hold, By deeds in Egypt God by him had done: This good old man to consummate their joyes In happy houre his sonne is come to see, Bringing his wife and his two little Boyes, Moses sent back in Midian safe to bee: Which by this time two proper Youthes are growne, Bred by their Grandsire with exceeding care, In all the host there hardly could be showne, That with those Boyes for beauty could compare. Such mirth and feasting as for them was seene, For this grave Father and this goodly Dame, Unto this day in Israel had not beene, Since to kinde Joseph righteous Jacob came. The day mild Moses scarcely can suffice, To tell this man the troubles they had past, The wonders God had acted in their eyes, Since they in Midian kindly parted last. Jethro that mark'd the paines that Moses tooke In rising early, and in resting late, That did himselfe into all causes looke, And in his person censure each debate: This Princely Priest a man exceeding wise, And long experienc'd in this great affaire, (For at that time few States or Monarchies Whose government he could not well declare) Reproves good Moses in this zealous deed: (Quoth he) me thinks thou dost not well in this, The course wherein I see thou dost proceed Trouble to thee and to the people is. Appoint out Judges, and inferiour Courts, Twixt the Plebeians and thy selfe to bee, From them receive those matters by report, Speake thou to God, and let them speake to thee, In things important be thou still in place, In lesser causes leaving them to deale, So may you both your quietnes embrace By an exact and perfect Common-weale. Now when to Sina they approched neare, God calls up Moyses to the mount above, And all the rest commaundeth to forbeare, Nor from the bounds assign'd them to remove. For who those limits loosely did exceede, (Which were by Moses mark'd them out beneath) The Lord had irrevocably decreed With darts or stones should surely die the death: Where as the people in a wondrous fright (With hearts transfixed even with frosen blood) Beheld their Leader openly in sight Passe to the Lord, where he in glory stood. Thunder and Lightning led him downe the ayre, Trumpets celestiall sounding as he came, Which struck the people with astounding feare, Himselfe invested in a splendorous flame. Sina before him fearfully doth shake, Covered all over in a smouldring smoake, As ready the foundation to forsake, On the dread presence of the Lord to looke. Erect your spirits and lend attentive eare To marke at Sina what to you is said, Weake Moses now you shall not simply heare, The sonne of Amram and of Jacobed. But he that Adam did imparadise, And lent him comfort in his proper blood, And saved Noah, that did the Arke devise, When the old world else perish'd in the flood, To righteous Abraham, Canaan franckly lent, And brought forth Isaak so extreamly late, Jacob so faire and many children sent, And rais'd chast Joseph to so high estate. He whose just hand plagu'd Egypt for your sake, That Pharaohs power so scornefully did mock, Way for his people through the Sea did make, Gave food from Heaven, and water from the Rock. Whilst Moses now in this cloud-covered hill, Full forty dayes his pure aboade did make, Whilst that great God in his almighty will, With him of all his Ordinances brake. The Decalogue from which Religion tooke The being: sinne and righteousnesse began The different knowledge: and the certaine booke Of testimony betwixt God and man. The Ceremoniall as Judicious lawes, From his high wisdome that receiv'd their ground, Not to be altred in the smallest clause, But as their Maker wondrously profound. The composition of that sacred Phane, Which as a Symbol curiously did shew, What all his six dayes workmanship containe, Whose perfect modell his owne finger drew. Whose absence thence gave leasure to their lust, Oppugning Aaron, Idols them to frame, And by their power still strengthen this disgust, In him denouncing the Almighties name. A gold-made God how durst you ever name, For him so long had led you from the Skie, In sight of Sina crowned with a flame, His glory thence residing in your eye? Such things might melt mortality to see, That even the very Elements did fright, He that in Egypt had perform'd for thee, What made the world amazed at his might. Thy soule transpierced ne'r before thou felt'st, But like a Quarry 't even clave thy breast, Comming from Sina when as thou beheld'st Th'elected Israel kneeling to a Beast. Him sence forsooke, his sinewes strengthlesse are, He came so much amazed there-withall, The stony Tables slip'd him unaware, That with their owne weight brake them in the fall. Downe this proud lump ambitiously he flung Into base dust dissolving it with fire, That since they for variety did long, They should thereby even surfet their desire. And sent the minerall through their hatefull throats, Whence late those horrid blasphemies did flie On bestiall figures when they fell to doate In prostitution to idolatrie. Now when this potion that they lately tooke, This Chymick medicine (their deserved fare) Upon their beards, and on their bosome stooke, He doth their slaughter presently prepare. What's he himselfe to Levie could allie Before this Calfe not sinfully did fall, Girds not his broad blade to his sinewie thie, When he heares Moyses unto Armes to call? Killing not him appointed he should slay, Though they had slep'd in eythers armes before, Though in one wombe they at one burthen lay, Yea when this dead, though that could be no more? You whom not Egypts tyranie could wound, Nor Seas, nor Rockes could any thing denie, That till this day no terrour might astound On the sharpe points of your owne swords to die? When Moyses now those Tables to renew Of that essentiall Deitie doth merit, (Which from his hands he dissolutely threw In the deepe anguish of his greeved spirit. When forty dayes without all nat'rall food) He on mount Sina fixed his abode, Retayning strength and fervour in his blood, Rap'd with the presence of that glorious God. Who in his high estate whilst he passed by In the cleft rocke that holy man did hide, Lest he should perish by his radiant eye, When Moyses seeing but his glorious side Celestiall brightnesse ceazed on his face, That did the wondring Israelites amaze, When he returned from that sovereigne place, His browes encircled with splendidious rayes. That their weake sight beholding of the same, He after cover'd from the common eyes, Lest when for answer unto him they came, The lusting people should idolatrize. Might we those mustred Israelites admire From plaines of Sina mighty Moyses led, Or else to view that opulence desire, To that rich Arke so freely offered. The mervailous modell of that rarest peece Th'ingravings, carvings, and embroderies tell, The cunning worke and excellent device Of neat Aholiab, and Bezaliell. But we our Moyses seriously pursue, And our strong nerves to his high praise applie, That through this maze shall guide us as a Clue, And may his vertues absolutely trie. Whose charge being weary of their mighty Armes, And much offended they had march'd so long, As oft disturbed with their sterne Alarmes, Suppose by Moyses to have suffered wrong. When with the luggage such as lagd behinde, And that were set the Cariages to keepe, Gainst God and Moyses greevously repinde, Wanting a little sustinance and sleepe. Who with their murm'ring moved in his ire, That they so soone his providence mistrust, Downe from his full hand flung that forcefull fire, Which in a moment brus'd their bones to dust. Other the mutt'ring Israelites among When now to Pharan having come so farre For flesh, fish, sallads, and for fruites doe long, Manna (they say) is not for men of warre. Their glut'nous stomackes loath that heav'nly bread, Who with full Chargers hunger heere releeves, As by the belly when they strongly fed On harty Garlicke and the flesh of Beeves? Milde man, what fearefull agony thee vex'd, When thou thy God unkindly didst upbrayd? How greevously thy suffring soule perplex'd, When thou repin'st the charge on thee was layd? With God to reason why he should dispose On thee that burthen heavy to sustaine, As though he did his purposes enclose Within the limits of mans shallow brayne. To judge so many marching every day, That all the flesh of Forrest and of flood, (When the wilde Desarts scarcely yeeld them way) Should them suffice for competence of food. That thou shouldst wish that hand so full of dread, Thy lingring breath should sodainly expire, Then that the clamorous multitude should spread, Those wicked slanders to incite his ire. That God to punish whom he still did love, And in compassion of thy frailties feare, The spirit he gave thee lastly should remove To those thy burthen that should after beare. O wondrous man! who parallel'd thee ever? How large a portion diddest thou inherit? That unto seventie he should it dissever, Yet all be Prophets only with thy Spirit? When loe a Cloud comes sailing with the winde Unto these Rebels terrible to see, That when they now some fearefull thing divin'd, A flight of Quailes perceived it to be. A full dayes journey round about the host, Two Cubits thicknes over all they flowe, That when by Israel he was tempted most, His glory then most notably to show. The greedy people with the very sight Are fill'd before they come thereof to taste, That with such surfet gluts their appetite Their queasie stomacks ready are to cast. Those that for Beefe in Gluttonie did call Those the high'st God his powerfulnes to trie, Cloyes with the fowle that from the Heavens doe fall, Untill they stuffe their stomackes by the eye. But whilst the flesh betwixt their teeth they chew, And sucke the fat so delicately sweet, (With too much plenty that even fulsome grew That lies so common troden with their feet.) That God impartiall and so rightly just, When he had given them more then they desire, Dulie to punish their insatiate lust, Powres downe his plagues consuming as his fire. And with a strong hand violently strake Their blood, distempred with luxurious diet, That soone the sores in groynes and arme-pits brake, Thus could the Lord scourge their rebellious riot. Aron and Miriam, all too much it were For griefe when Moyses ready is to die; But you whom one wombe happily did beare Gainst your milde Brother needs must mutinie. O unkinde Aaron when thou fondly fram'dst That Beast-like Idoll bowing Israels knee, He then thee beg'd, that thou so basely blam'dst, And did divert the judgement due to thee. Immodest Miriam when the hand of might Left thee with lothsome leprosie defil'd, Contemn'd and abject in the vilest sight, From the great host perpetually exil'd: When thou hadst spet the utmost of thy spight, And for thy sinne this plague on thee was throwne, He not forsooke thee but in heavie plight Kneeling to God obtain'd thee for his owne. His wondrous patience ever was applide To those on him that causelesly complaine, Who did with comely carelesnesse deride What happy men should evermore disdaine. When now the Spials for the promis'd soyle, For the twelve Tribes that twelve in number went, Having discovered forty dayes with toyle, Safely return'd as happily they went: Bringing the Figs, Pomgranates, and the Grapes, Whose verdurous clusters that with moisture swell, Seeme by the taste and strangenesse of the shapes, The place that bare them faithfully to tell. That well express'd the nature of the earth, So full of liquor and so wondrous great, That from such wished fruitfulnesse in birth, Suck'd the sweet marrow of a plenteous teat. But whilst they stand attentively to heare The sundry soyles wherein they late had beene, Telling what Giants did inhabit there, What Townes of warre that walled they had seene. Of Anacks of-spring when they come to tell, And their huge stature when they let them see, And of their shapes so terrible and fell, Which were suppos'd the Titanois to bee. Their hearts sunck downe, and though the fruits they saw By their rare beauty might allure their eyes, Yet this report their coward soules did awe, And so much daunt the forward enterprise, That they their God doe utterly refuse, Against just Moses openly exclame, And were in hand a Captaine them to chuse To guide them back to Goshen whence they came. Not all the dread of the Egyptian dayes, What by milde Moses he to passe had brought, Nor seene by him done at the purple Seas, On their vile minds a higher temper wrought. Whom when of God he beg'd with bloody eyes, And against Heaven did obstinatly strive, Obtain'd so hardly their immunities, Whose sinne seem'd greater then he could forgive. Caleb and Josua you couragious men, When bats and stones against your breasts were laid, Oppose your selves against the other ten, That expedition basely that disswade. Quoth they to conquer as he did before No more than men, what praise his puisance yeelds, But he whose force the very Rocks did gore, Can with the same hand cleave their brazen sheelds. He that foresawe that this should be our seate, And onely knew the goodnes of the same, Possess'd the place with those that were so greate For us to keepe it safely till we came. For which the Lord did vowe that not a man At Sina mustred where such numbers were, Should live to come to fruitfull Canaan, Onely those two so well themselves that beare. And for the basenes of those recreant Spies Whose melting minds this impious slaunder bred, And the vile peoples incredulities, In that their God so strongly promised. For fortie dayes discovrie of the Land, They fortie yeeres in wildernes shall wast, Consum'd with plagues from his impetuous hand, Untill that age be absolutely past. Which scarsly spoke, but quickly tooke effect, For those so colde, and cowardly before, Hearing the censure of their base neglect, To make his vengeance and their sinne the more. Entring the Land which Moyses them denies, Their desp'rate will no better can afford, Offering those lives they did so lightly prize Unto the vengance of the Heath'nish sword. And in the host new factions daylie grewe, When Chores, Dathan, and Abiram rise, Two hundred men of speciall note that drew, Whose strength gave power to their confed'racies. But the vast earth incontinently clave, And on the sodaine hurried them to hell With the shrill screame the shrieking people gave, The fainting Hoast into a feaver fell: The rest of the Conspirators were left (From the first's fall enforcing their retire, Of all the succours of the host bereft) Consum'd to ashes with Heavens violent fire: And those th'abettors of this vile attempt That did milde Moyses cruelly pursue, From th'others sinne that could not be exempt, Them with the dreadfull pestilence he slew. That had not Aaron when all hope was fled With holy Incense their atonement wrought, Thrusting himselfe twixt th'living and the dead, All had to ruine utterly beene brought. Where fourteene thousand and seven hundred sanke Under the burden of their odious sinne, Which now was wax'd s'insufferably ranke, It was high time his vengeance should begin. When after this so terrible a thing, Now that triumphant and miraculous wand, Brings forth ripe Almonds, strongly witnessing In Levies Tribe the Priesthood still to stand. With leaves and blossomes bravely it doth flourish, Some budding, some as instantly but blowne, As when the same the naturall rynd did nourish, For Moyses sake such Miracles were showne. Forward to Cadesh they their journey cast, Where the good Miriam makes her latest houre, Miriam the faire, the excellent, the chast, Miriam that was of womanhood the flowre, Here bids her Brothers lovingly adue, Who at her parting kisse her closing eyes, Whose wondrous losse sufficiently to rue, More is the griefe that teares cannot suffice. Moyst are their eyes, their lips are shrunk with heat, Their griefe within, as outward it appeares, Their want of water in that place as great, As it to them is plentifull of teares. They at one instant mutinie and mourne, Sorrowes creepe forth confusedly together, The teares for her incontinent they turne To words gainst Moyses that did guide them thither: Who from the rocke strooke water with the wand, That man and beast might plenteously maintaine, But he from rocks that fountaines can command, Cannot yet stay the fountaines of his braine. Much woe for Miriam these good men did make, Whilst there were two, that might bewaile this one, But two departing for their mutuall sake, Moyses remaines to mourne himselfe alone. Aaron the ancient'st of the Hebrew line, Repleate with naturall comelinesse and grace, (God-like so farre as man might be divine) Endeth his dayes in this predest'ned place. Which being forewarned to awaite his end, And here the fate foretelling him to die, That the good houre doth onely now attend, Will'd to ascend the mountaine (being nie.) With Eleazer his deare Childe he goes, Led by milde Moyses as the Lord decreed, To his lov'd Sonne his garments to dispose, Him in the Priesthood pointed to succeed. When turning backe to bid them all adue, Who look'd as fast to bid this Lord farewell, Fountaines of late so fast from rockes ne'r flewe, As the salt drops downe their sad bosomes fell. Not the obdurat'st, not the stoniest hearts, That in deepe sorrow melting here forbeares, Those to whom Nature not those drops imparts, Spent what in sighes, the other did in teares. Sated with sobs, but hungry with his sight, Their watry eyes him earnestly pursue, When to discerne him they no longer might Where their sight ends, their sorrowes doe renue. Com'n to the top, to the appointed place, His Sonne in all his ornaments invested, Which the good Aaron meekely doth embrace, And unto him his offices bequested. When they the time no longer could adjourne, After embraces and a floud of woes, (Which when one ceas'd the other tooke his turne) From eithers eyes that on the other flowes. Now at the last point, at the gaspe of death, He whom the whole world hath but such another, Gives up his latest, his most blessed breath, In the deare armes of his beloved Brother. So wisely worketh that eternall Being By the still changes of their varying state, (As to the end through the beginning seeing) To build the frame of unavoyded Fate. When those given up to their lascivious wils, Themselves in Midian wantonnesse that waste, Whose fleshly knowledge sip'd those sugred ills, Twenty foure thousand slaughtered at the last. Of all those that in Sina numbred are, I'th plaines of Moab mustered then againe, Wasted by time, fire, pestilence, and warre, Those promis'd two and Moyses did remaine. The time expir'd that they for Aaron mourn'd, New conquest now, new comfort them doth bring, Their former hope successively return'd, That seem'd before so sadly languishing. When they the glorious victorie obtaine The Plaines of Horma scattered all with shields, Where Arad and his Cananites are slaine, Not the least fight of many glorious fields. With Sebon's slaughter seconded againe, And Ogs great fall of a Giganticke strength, Whose bed of iron fash'on'd to containe In breadth foure Cubits, doubling it in length: The living remnant of the mighty race, Of big-bon'd Anack terrible and dred, Which long time batning in that fertile place, Grew like the fat soile wherein they were bred. Not Poets fictions of the Phlægrian fields, Whereas the Giants up to Heaven would clime, Heaping on mountaines not such wonder yeelds, As did the men that lived in that time. And five proud Kings fell in their recreant flight, Before arm'd Israel on the Midian plaine, Zur, Hur, and Evi, men of wondrous might, Reba and Rekem valiantly slaine. And as his strength crush'd mighty Kings to dust, And cleft the helmes that thunder proofe were thought, That hand that help'd them, scourg'd their impious lust, When his high judgement to pervert they sought. And sent those Serpents (with their fiery stings,) With inflammations that their flesh did swell, Sharpely to scourge their trustlesse murmurings, That still in infidelity did dwell. Rare in this creature was his wondrous might, That should effect the nature of the fire, Yet to recure the sorance by the sight, Sicknesse might seeme the remedie t'admire. Onely by mettall miracles to worke, That Serpents shape, the Serpents hurt should heale, To shew in him the mysteries that lurke, And being so strange, as strangely doth reveale. That the forg'd figure of so vile a thing Should the disease so presently remove, Onely by th'eye a remedy to bring, Deepe searching Magicke leaveth to approve, As Balaams beast did Balacks hast delay, And the full purpose of the Prophet brake, When he beheld the Angell by the way, Burst out from beast, and to his Master spake: Whose execration able to astound The sunne, when he his Sommers height did boast, And with a word could instantly confound The world, were it a congregated host. He whose wise lips could Oracles compile, And judgements irrevocable did passe, Should be confounded by the thing most vile, By that base creature, the dull worthlesse Asse, Ruling his mouth as with a Riders bit, Bidden by Balaack to denounce their fall: Doth all his dreadfull Minaces acquit, Sounding their blessing and their enemies fall. When this milde man that onely did remaine, Of those from Egipt that the Lord did bring, Which he in Justice sundry wayes had slaine, For their false worship and their murmuring. Since he remisse at Meriba was prov'd, And there his zeale not ardently exprest, The Lord did sweare (though him he dearely lov'd) He should not come to Canaan as the rest. And now approaching Abaris (the place) From whence he might that promis'd Country see, (So much the Lord good Moyses pleas'd to grace) But there his dayes must consummated be. When this great Prophet zealously had bless'd, Each sev'rall Tribe with a particular good, Whose parting, them with sorrow so oppress'd, That shedding teares, their eyes shed drops of blood. To Nebo seated admirably hie, (The Spirit prepares him safely to retire) Which thrusts his head into the cloudie skie, Pisga so proudly thither dare aspire. Pisga the height of Abaris, and this The height of Pisga over all doth stand, That as the eye of mighty Abaris Survayeth the imparallelled Land. Where goodly Gilead unto him he showes As farre as ever he could looke to Dan, The length and breadth how every way it goes, Till her brow kisse the calme Mediteran. Where the sweet South layes forth her swelling brest, With a pleas'd eye he silently survay'd, To that faire Citie whose high Towers doe rest Under the Palme trees most delicious shade. When this meeke man approaching to his death, In death ev'n pleas'd faire Canaan to behold, Whilst he had use of his expiring breath, Thus his last farewell mildly doth enfolde. Israel (quoth he) deare Israel, now adue, Moyses no more is, that your Leader was, Josua and Caleb none but onely you, Of the last age must over Jordan passe. Th'Egyptian horrours yet 'twas I did see, And through those strange calamities did wade, And Israels charge imposed was on mee, When they (but then) had scarcely learn'd to dade. Forty two journeyes have I straitly past Since first this glorious Pilgrimage begun, In wrath or mercy where as first or last, Some wondrous thing hath happily beene done. M'immortall Maker that so oft have seene (That God of wonder:) these complaints not boot, In yonder fields so delicate and greene, That may not set my miserable foot. Thus leaning backe against the rising Clieve, Raising his faint hands to the hopefull skies, Meeke as the morning never seene to strive, Great'st of the Prophets the good Moyses dies. An hundred twenty hardly passed yeares, His naturall vigour no whit did asswage, His eye as bright, his body then appeares, As in the height and Summer of his age. Who being dissolv'd the Angels did interre Neere to Bethpeor in the vallied ground, But yet so secret kept his Sepulcher That it by mortall never should be found. Lest that his people (if the place were knowne) (Seeing by him the miracles were done, That ever to Idolatrie were prone,) Unto his bones a worshipping should runne. One that God grac'd so many sundry wayes, No former age hath mentioned to bee, Arived at the period of his dayes The future time in Israel shall not see. DAVID AND GOLIAH. Our sacred Muse, of Israels Singer sings, That heavenly Harper, whose harmonious Strings Expeld that evill Spirit which Saul possest, And of his torments often him releast; That Princely Prophet David, whose high Layes, Immortall God, are Trumpets of thy praise, Thou Lord of hosts be helping then to me, To sing of him who hath so sung of thee. What time great Saul after so bloody fights, Return'd a victor of th'Amalakites, (Two hundred and ten thousand men at armes Under his conduct) had reveng'd the harmes Done to Gods chosen people, when as they Came back from Egypt, troubled on their way: Saul with their blood had now manur'd the Plaines, Leading King Agag (as a slave) in chaines: But for that Saul this Agags blood had spar'd, And 'gainst the will of the Almighty dar'd To save that man he should have put to sword, For disobeying the Almighties word, Their larded Fatlings keeping for a prey, Which he commanded to be made away: For which the living God displeased, swore To holy Samuel, Saul should raigne no more; Samuel Gods Prophet, by whose holy hand The Oyle was pour'd (by his divine command) Upon the head of comely Saul when he Was chosen over Israel to be: But for that place another God had pointed, Which should by Samuel likewise be anointed: And this was David his most deare delight, The sonne of Ishay the just Bethlemite. Meane while this Youth like a poore Shepheard clad, (Of whom such care the God of Israel had) His fathers flock was following day by day Upon a Desart neare at hand that lay; Whose wealthy fleeces and fat bodies he From ravenous vermine hourely us'd to free, His onely armes, his Sling and Sheephooke were, Other then those he had not us'd to beare, With these a Woolfe oft comming from the wood, Or subtill Fox, that forrag'd for his food, He quickly slew; or if a Beare opprest With cruell hunger, hapned to molest His feeding flocks, he with such bangs him plyde, That with the prey even in his teeth he dyde; Or if a Lion as his faire flock graz'd, Hapt to assayle it, he no whit amaz'd At his sterne roaring, when his clutches caught At this brave Sheepheard, but such blowes him raught Till by the beard that kingly beast he shooke, And from his jawes the trembling Wether tooke; And if it chanc't that sometime from the ayre An Eagle stoop'd a Lambe away to beare, He with a stone that from his Sling he threw, Downe from the clouds would fetch her as she flew. His curled Tresses on his shoulders hung, To which the dewes at Morne and Eve so clung, To the beholders that they did appeare As nature threded Pearle with every hayre: The Bees, and Waspes, in wildernesses wilde Have with his beauties often bin beguild, Roses and Lillies thinking they had seene, But finding there they have deceived beene, Play with his eyes, which them that comfort bring, That those two Sunnes would shortly get a spring; His Lippes in their pure Corrall liveries mock A row of Pales cut from a Christall Rock, Which stood within them, all of equall height. From top to toe each limbe so cleane and straight, By every joynt of his that one might try, Or give true lawes to perfect Symmetry; The vermine (oft) his Sheepe that would surprize Became so charm'd with th'splendor of his eyes, That they forgot their ravine, and have layne Downe by his flocks, as they would glad and faine Keepe them from others, that on them would prey, Or tend upon them, that they should not stray. Whether in Cotes he had his flock in hould, Or for the Fallowes kept them in the fould, He was not idle, though not taking paines, Celestiall Lyricks singing to the Swaines, And often sitting in the silent shade, When his faire flock to rest themselves were layde, On his Lyre tuned such harmonious Layes, That the Birds pearcht upon the tender sprayes, Mad at his musick, straine themselves so much To imitate th'unimitable tuch, Breaking their hearts, that they have dropt to ground, And dy'd for griefe in malicing the sound. Sometimes a Stag he with his Sling would slay, Or with his Sheephooke kill a Boare at bay, Or runne a Roe so long (he was so fleet) Till it lay trembling, breathlesse, at his feet, Sometimes againe, he practised a fight, That from the Desart, should a Dragon light Upon his Sheepe, the Serpent to assayle, How by cleere skill through courage to prevaile. Then with a small stone throwne out of his Sling To hit a swallow on her height of wing, And home at night when they their Sheepe should drive, The sluggish Sheepheards lastly to revive, He tooke his Harpe so excellently strung, In a broad Bauldrick at his back that hung, And on the same stroke such mellodious straines, That from the Coverts as the neighboring Plaines, The Ecchoes wakt with sweetnesse of his notes, Which each to other diligently rotes; And thus his time the Lords beloved past; Till God to Samuel calling at the last; Samuel saith he, to Bethlem take thy way, To Ishays house, and to that old man say, Out of his loynes that I will chuse a King, And when his Sonnes before thee he shall bring, Chuse out that man that I shall thee appoint, With sacred Oyle and see thou him anoint, For of them all, he's knowne to me right well The first to guide my people Israel. Samuel replyes, my God, if Saul shall know Upon what businesse I to Bethlem goe, Except my blood him nothing will suffice. Take thou a Heyfer, God againe replies, And give it out thou purposely dost goe To sacrifice; as God doth counsell, so The holy Prophet acts, and comming thither, The noblest of people get together, Doubting the Lord had angry with them bin, And had sent Samuel to reprove their sinne; But peace to all the holy Prophet cries, And then preparing to the sacrifice. The Rites perform'd, he bids old Ishay bring His Sonnes before him whilst the offering Smoak'd on the Altars (and the Elders there Stood round about with reverence and feare) For in his houshold he a King must chuse. Ishay who might not Gods command refuse, Cals Eliab out for Samuel to see, Who at the first thought surely this was he, Till God to Samuel said, doe not deceive Thy selfe (weake man) but thy election leave, Thou canst not see the soule of man, as I Who search the heart, and every thought can try. His second sonne Abniadab then came, But this not he that Samuel must name; Then cals he Shamna his third sonne, but yet This was not he th'Almighties turne must fit, He cals for more till he had counted seaven, To none of these yet must the Oyle be given: Before the Prophet brother stood by brother, A twelvemonths growth one just before another; Like seaven brave blossom'd Plants, that in the spring Nature prepar'd forth goodly fruit to bring: So comely all, that none in them could read Which one of them should any one exceed, If he exceld for lovelinesse of face, Another for his person and his grace Match'd him at full, as nature meant to show Her equall bounties how she could bestow. There he beholds one brother tall and straight, Another that was wanting of his height, For his complection and his curious shape, Well neare out went him, nature let not scape Ought she could doe, in them each limbe to fit To grace the other that was next to it. When Samuel askes if these were all he had, Ishay replyes, onely his yongest Lad That in the Desart on his flocks doth tend, Samuel commands away for him to send, For till he came he vow'd he would not sit, Out of the place nor would he stirre a whit. Before grave Samuel David soone is brought, Upon the Prophet which most strongly wrought When he beheld him beautifull and tall, Of goodly presence, and well shap'd withall, His cheeke a mixture of such red and white, As well with wonder might attract the sight, A sprightfull aspect, and so cleere an eye, As shot a lightning at the standers by, His every gesture seene it in to bring The majesty that might befit a King; All those rare parts that in his brothers were Epitomiz'd, at large in him appeare; And (in his eare) God doth the Prophet tell, This David shall be King of Israel. Whom with the sacred Oyle (instead of Saul) Samuel anointed there before them all: Which having done, to Rama takes his way, Lest Saul for him the country should forelay: When Kingly David of his owne accord, Though he were then th'anointed of the Lord, And though his Sheephooke might his Scepter be, This holy Youth so humble is, that he Will back to th'fields his fathers flock to keepe, And make his subjects, (for a while) his Sheepe. The powerfull spirit of God, redoubled grew Dayly in David, and his fame now flew O'r all the Region, how he was belov'd Of Gods high Prophet, and by him approv'd; Field, Towne, and City, with his name doe ring, The tender Virgins to their Timbrels sing Dittys of him, and in their rurall playes, The homely Sheepheards in their Roundelayes Record his acts, and build him shady Bowers, The Maydens make him Anadems of flowers, And to what sport himselfe he doth apply, Let's follow David, all the people cry. An evill spirit then sent by God possest Enraged Saul, so greevously opprest, With melancholly, that it craz'd his wits, And falling then into outragious fits, With cramps, with stitches and convulsions rackt, That in his pangs he oft was like to act His rage upon himselfe, so raving mad, And soone againe disconsolate and sad; Then with the throbs of his impatient heart, His eyes were like out of his head to start, Fomes at the mouth, and often in his paine O'r all his Court is heard to roare againe; As the strong spirit doth punish or doth spare, Even so his fits or great, or lesser are, That Israel now doth generally lament Upon their King Gods greevous punishment. When some which saw this spirit possessing Saul, Amongst themselves a counsell quickly call, To search if there might remedy be found For this possession, each man doth propound His thought of curing, as by Physick some, Each man speakes what into his minde doth come, But some whose soules were ravished more hie, Whose composition was all harmony, Of th'Angels nature and did more partake, By which as Seers prophetickly they spake; (With holy Magick for some spirits inspir'd, Which by a cleere Divinity are fier'd, And sharpned so, each depth and hight to try, That from their reach and visibility Nature no secrets shuts, and heaven reveales Those things which else from reason it conceales) Those men conclude the spirit that thus had harm'd Their soveraigne Saul, with Musick must be charm'd. And having heard of Israels deare delight, Beloved David the brave Bethlemite, What wondrous things by Musick he had done, How he fierce Tigars to his hand had wonne, Had layd the Lion, and the Beare to sleepe, And put such spirit into his silly sheepe By his high straines, as that they durst oppose The Woolfe and Fox, their most inveterate foes: Of this Musitian they informe the King, And all assure him, there was no such thing For him as Musick, and this man was he That his Physitian in this kinde must be. When Saul dispatcht his messengers away To aged Ishay, that without delay, His yong'st sonne David should to Court be sent: The speedy Post relating the intent To the old man: which in his heart was glad, For at the first he great suspition had, That angry Saul might else have bin acquainted, By Samuels hand his sonne had bin anointed, And therefore caused David to be sought, As of his death he direly had forethought. The good old man o'r joy'd with this good newes, Cals home his darling from his teeming Ewes, And to the care of Israels God commends His loved boy, and kindly by him sends Of Bread and Wine a present to the King. They him no sooner to Sauls presence bring, But Davids beauty so extreamly tooke The doting King, that in each glance or looke, He thought he saw high valour mixt with truth, And neare his person takes the lovely Youth, And who but David then with mighty Saul His only favorite is, his all in all? Not long it is e'r Saul the spirit doth feele To stirre within him, and begins to reele, And suddainly into a Trance he fals, And with his hands lyes grasping at the wals, When David takes his well-tun'd Harpe in hand, By which the spirit he meaneth to command; His quavering fingers he doth now advance Above the trembling strings, which gin to dance At his most cleere tuch, and the winged sound About the spacious Roome began to bound, The Aers flew high, and every dainty straine Betters the former, which doth so detaine, The eares of those stood by, that they heare not Sauls sad complaints, and suddainly forgot To lift or stirre him, and the standers by, Were so intransed with the melody, That to a holy madnesse some it brought, Others againe to Prophecy it wrought. The Wyery cords now shake so wondrous cleere, As one might thinke an Angels voyce to heare From every quaver, or some spirit had pent It selfe of purpose in the Instrument; The harmony of the untuned'st string Torments the spirit which so torments the King, Who as he faintly, or he strongly groanes, This brave Musitian altreth so his tones, With sounds so soft, as like themselves to smother, Then like lowd Ecchoes answering one the other: Then makes the spirit to shift from place to place, Still following him with a full Diapase: Thus day by day as th'evill spirit opprest Diseased Saul, David himselfe addrest, T'awayte the houres, before the King to play, Untill he made th'unruly fiend obay The force of Musick, more then that to feare But the least sound of Davids Harpe to heare. When now the King by Davids cunning cur'd, Old Ishais Sonne who thought he had indur'd Restraint too long, gets leave of Saul to goe To Bethlem back (Gods holy will was so) He rather chose to view his well-shorne Sheepe, His yeaning Ewes, and late-falne Lambes to keepe, Then on a Bed of silke himselfe repose, And the delights of the fresh fields to lose. When now Philistia horribly enragd, With Gods owne people had it selfe engag'd, With a revengefull deadly hand to smite The still-preserv'd oft-troubled Israelite, Who had in Battaile many times before Upon the earth spilt her unhallowed gore. Grim-visag'd warre, more sternely doth awake, Then it was wont, and furiously doth shake Her lightning sword, intruding with the force Of men of warre both skilfull foot and horse. Two mighty nations are now up in armes, And to both sides the Souldiers come in swarmes: The fields with Ensignes, as t'were flowers are deckt Which their refulgence every way reflect Upon the Mountaines and the vallies nie And with their splendor seeme to court the skie. Two mighty Armyes on the playne appeare, These Isralites, and those Philistians were; Their great Commanders, proved men of warre: Their long experience, who had fetcht from farre, To order fights as they occasion found T'offend the foe, by fitting with the ground, Which chosen Israels infantry doth call, In this defensive warre to follow Saul. And aged Isha faithfully to show The love to Saul, and Israel he doth owe, His eldest three into the Army sent, That to the field, as well appointed went, As on their bravery they that bare them most, Nor was there, in the Israelitish hoste Three goodlier men, especially when they Were in their Armes, the most unclouded day That ever shone, tooke not with such delight The glad beholders, as the wondring sight Of these brave Youths, still as they marched by. Now in the fields the mighty Armies lye On the wide champaine, each in others sight; But as the Trumpets showte them out to fight, From the Philistians hoste a Gyant came, Whose splendrous Armes shone like a mighty flame Against the sunne; Goliah nam'd of Gath; The onely Champion that Philistia hath: This huge Colossus, then sixe Cubits height More by a handfull: and his ponderous weight, Wheresoe're he made but any little stay, Shew'd that his bredth, it answered every way: Never such might in mortall man there was, From head to foot at all poynts arm'd with brasse, Five thousand sheckles his prov'd Curats way'd, Upon whose temper, wondrous cost was layd: His Shield and Harnesse well might load a Teame, His Lance as big as any Weavers beame; Whose very Pyle upon the poyse contain'd A hundred sheckles, he a lesse disdain'd: His Browes like two steepe Penthouses hung downe Over his eye-lids, and his angry frowne Was like a cloud, when it like Pitch appeares, And some sterne tempest in its bosome beares: His voyce was hoarse, and hollow, yet so strong, As when you heare the murmuring of a throng In some vaste arched Hall, or like as when A Lordly Lyon angred in his den, Grumbles within the earth, such his resembled, That when he spake, th'affrighted hearers trembled: His Squire before him marching to the field, Who for this Champion bare a second shield. Upon two easie hils the Armies laye A valley 'twixt them in the middle way: Into the midst of which, Goliah came, And thus doth to the Israelites proclaime, If there be found in all your host quoth he A man so valiant, that dare fight with me, If I shall fall under his mighty sword, Israel shall then be the Philistians Lord: But if I by my puissance shall prevaile Over your Champion (that shall me assaile) Then as our slaves, of you we will dispose; And use at pleasure, as our conquered foes, For he that's God of the Philistians, boasts Himselfe more powerfull then your Lord of hosts. Which challenge thus, not onely troubled Saul, But bred amazement through the host in all. For forty dayes thus us'd he forth to goe, Offring by combate to decide it so. Old Ishay now desiring much to heare, Of his three Sonnes (in what estate they were) Doubting lest they some needfull things might want, As in the Army, victuals might grow scant; Wherefore he cals yong David from his sheepe, And to another gives his charge to keepe. My Boy quoth he, haste to the Campe and see In what estate my Sonnes your Brothers be: Beare them parcht corne, and cakes, though homely food, Yet simple cates may doe poore Souldiers good: And to the Generall, ten fine Cheeses beare, Such in the Campe are not found every where. And if for need t'have pawn'd ought of esteeme, Take money with you, and their Pledge redeeme. David, make haste, for I desire to know 'Twixt the two puissant hosts, how businesse goe. No marvaile David in his heart were glad, That he such cause to view the Armies had: From his brave thoughts, and to himselfe he told, The wondrous things that he should there behold. The rare Devices by great Captaines worne, The five-fald Plumes their Helmets that adorne. Armours with stones, and curious studs enricht, And in what state they their Pavilions pitcht, There should he see their marshalling a warre, The iron-bound Chariot, and the armed Carre: As where consisted either armies force, Which had advantage by their foot or horse: The severall weapons either nation beare, The long Sword, Bow, the Polax and the Speare: There the Philistian gallantry, and then His Israels bravery answering them agen: And heare them tell th'adventures had bin done, As what brave man had greatest honour wonne. David bestirres him presently, and packes Up his provision, puts it into sackes, And by his Servant on his Mule doth laye, Then towards Sauls Army takes the ready way. And his no tedious journey so contrives, That in short time he at the Campe arives: And at his comming, instantly bestowes His needfull provant, to the charge of those That tend the Carriage, and of them doth learne (As neere as he could make them to discerne By his description) Ishas Sonnes, who led, And in the Army where they quartered: By whose direction he his Brothers sought, And told them what provision he had brought: And to all three, their Fathers pleasure show'd, And how the Cheeses he would have bestow'd. As they were talking, suddainly a noyse Ran through the Army, and the generall voyce, Was the Philistian, the Philistian see, Goliah comes, ordain'd our scourge to be. Who as his used manner was, defies The host of Israel, and thus loudly cryes, Bring downe your Champion, that with me dares fight, And this our warre shall be decided streight: But Israels God, for feare drawes backe his hand, Nor is there one against me that dare stand. Which David hearing, his yong bloud doth rise, And fire was seene to sparkle from his eyes: His spirits begin to startle, and his rage Admits no reason that may it asswage: No nerve of his, but to it selfe doth take A double strength, as though his arme could shake The Iron Lance that great Goliah beares: And beate his brazen Shield about his eares. His strugling thoughts now being set a worke, Awake that flame, which lately seem'd to lurke In his meeke breast, which into passion breakes, And to himselfe thus Princely David speakes. Despised nation, Israel quoth he, Where be those valiant men that liv'd in thee, What are our soules in lesser moulds now cast, Then at the first, with time or doe they waste? What slaved people, but we can stand by, And heare this base Philistian Dogge defie God and his people, must he stand to boast His strength and valour, and in all the hoast No man dare undertake him; might I prove My Manhood on him, I should soone remove The worlds opinion, and both hosts should know Hee's but a Dogge, on us that raileth so: And to one standing neere him, thus he spake, Of this huge Beast, what wonder doe ye make: What shall be done to that one man that shall Fight with this Gyant, and before ye all, His pride and horrid blasphemies shall quell, And take this shame away from Israel? When one that heard him, quickly thus replyes, He by whose hand this huge Goliah dyes, For Wife to him, Sauls Daughter shall be given, One of the goodliest Creatures under heaven; And yet this further, his reward shall be His Fathers house in Israel shall goe free. With this yet David closeth not his eare, But of some other likewise doth enquire For his reward, the Gyant that should slay, The formers words, which like a lesson say, None of them thinking, this yet scarcely man, Should strike to death the proud Philistian. His Brother Eliab, now which over-heard, Young Davids questions, and was much afeard His over-daring spirit might draw him on, To worke their shame, and his confusion: Thinkes with himselfe, it greatly him behooves, To checke his boldnesse, and him thus reprooves. Fond Boy, quoth he, why stand'st thou to enquire After these things, thy businesse lyes not here: I would not (sure) but you the Campe should view, A Sheepe-Coate Sir, would better sute with you: Who have you left, after your Flocke to looke, Your Scrip (no question) or your shepheards Crooke. Sirra, my Father sent you not to us, About the Army to lye loytering thus: I thinke 'tis time to get you on your way, Our Father thinkes that we inforce your stay. At Eliabs speeches, David somewhat mov'd To heare himselfe thus scornefully reprov'd: Brother quoth he, few words might have suffic'd, Had you but knowne how lightly they are priz'd Of me, these speeches you would have forborne, Upon some other and have spent your scorne. I come to view the Campe, you say, 'tis so, And I will view it better ere I goe. Why may not I, as well as other men, I'le goe when I shall please, and not till then? When time may me more liberty alow, I may beare Armes perhaps as you doe now: Looke to your warfare, and what is your owne, Good Brother Eliab, and let me alone: For of my selfe I know how to dispose, And thus away resolved David goes. And as he went, still as he heares the cry After Goliah, still more hie and hie, His spirit is mounted, and his oft demand, What his reward should be, whose valiant hand Should kill Goliah, through the Army went, And was the common talke in every Tent, (But in the most bred sundry doubts and feares, When as they way'd his tendernesse of yeares) Untill his Fame, by going, getting strength In Sauls Pavilion is cry'd up at length: Who with much speed, sent out to have him sought, And to his presence caus'd him to be brought. Who with a constant and delightfull cheere, Comes to the King, and doth to him appeare With such a sprightfull, and majesticke grace, As victory were written in his face: And being by Saul, demanded if 'twere he, That Israels Champion undertooke to be; He with a meeke smile, boldly doth reply, I am the man my Soveraigne, 'tis even I: My Leege quoth he, be not at all dismaid, Nor let Gods chosen Israel be afraid. This mighty Monster in the peoples sight, So terrible, whose shape doth so affright The multitude, I doe no more esteeme, Then if a Dwarfe, nor he to me doth seeme But such a thing, my onely envy's this, That he is not much greater then he is: The more his strength, the more his fall will be, And Israels God more glorifi'd in me. Quoth Saul againe, thou art of tender age, And in respect of him a very Page; Beside, the other Armes that he doth beare, Thou art not able to lift halfe his Speare: If he strike at thee, and thy body misse, Yet on his side, there this advantage is, The winde of his huge weapon hath the force To drive the breath out of thy slender Coarse: And this vaste man, beside his wondrous might, No man as he, so skilfull is in fight; Expert in all, to Duels that belong, Train'd up in Armes whilst yet he was but yong. The better, answered David, if his skill Equall his strength, for what is it to kill A common man? a common thing it were, Which hapneth every day, and every where; But for a Giant such a one as he, Upon the Field to be subdu'd by me, This to all Nations shall be thought a thing Worthy of Israels God, and Israels King. I have slaine a Lion and Beare, quoth he, And what is this uncircumcis'd to me More then a Beast. That onely God of might By whose great power I conquered these in fight, In spight of humane strength and greatnesse, can Give to my hands this proud Philistian. When Saul thus sees that there was in his soule That courage which no danger could controule, A valour so invincible and hie, As naturally enabled him to flye Above all thought of perill, and to beare Him quite away beyond the bounds of feare; He caus'd an Armour for him to be brought, But first of all a garment richly wrought He puts upon the brave youth and then bad That in those goodly Armes he should be clad. Which put upon him as to stirre he strives, He thinkes him selfe in Manakles, and Gives, Their ponderousnesse him to the earth doth presse: These Armes doe make his Activenesse fare lesse, For he before had not bin us'd to these, Nor him at all their boistrousnesse can please, His Gorget gauld his Neck, his Chinne beneath, And most extreamly hindred him to breath, His Curats sit too close upon his side, He in no hand his Helmet can abide, It is so heavy, and his Temples wrings, His Pouldrons pinch him, and be cumbrous things, His Gaunlets clumsie, and doe wring his Wrists, And be so stiffe he cannot clutch his Fists; His Guyses they so strong and stubborne be, That for his life he cannot bend his knee; He knew not how to beare his brazen Shield, Such weapons Sheepheards were not us'd to weeld, Their weight and their unwildinesse was such, And they restraind his nimblenesse so much, That he prayd Saul of these he might be freed, It is not Armour that must doe the deed, Let me alone, saith he, and Ile provide My selfe of Armes, this quarrell to decide. When forth he goes, shot for his Sling to looke, And neare the Campe he finds a perling Brooke, Whose shallow sides with Pebbles did abound, Where seeking such as massy were and round, He picks out five, away with him to bring, Such as he knew would fit his trusty Sling, And in his Scrip them closely doth bestow, By which he vowes Goliahs overthrow. When swift report throughout the Army runnes, That youthfull David one of Ishaes sonnes, A very stripling, and the yong'st of eight, With the Philistian was that day to fight; That great Goliah which so oft had brav'd Dejected Israel, and the combat crav'd With any one she to the field could bring, Now for it was so pertinent a thing, As that their freedome or subjection lay On the successe of this unequall Fray, Th'event thereof struck every one with feare, But his sad brethren most perplexed were, And to themselves thus say they: O that we So long should draw our lothed breath, to see That by the pride of this accursed Boy, Despised Israel should no more enjoy Her ancient glories, but be made a slave To proud Philistia; and our fathers grave Slandred by him; his Family and Name Branded by David with perpetuall shame. Curst be the time that he was hither sent, Curst be the time he came into our Tent. And now and then they purposed to fly, Nor would they stay to see their brother dye, But at the very point to take their way, Bethinke themselves, it better were to stay, To seeke his scattered limbes to peeces hew'd, And see them in some obscure earth bestow'd. In this sad manner whilst they murm'ring were, David is busied listning still to heare Of great Goliah: scarce can he refraine From calling for him; now in every vaine His blood is dancing, and a sprightly fire Takes up his bosome, which doth him inspire With more then humane courage, nor he can Conceive a terror to proceed from man, His nerves and sinewes to that vigor grow, As that his strength assures him he can throw Through thicker Armes, then mortall yet could weeld. Upon the suddaine, when through all the field The word was heard, Goliah now appeares, Which Davids heart in such strange manner cheeres, As that he feeles it caper in his breast. When soone that huge uncircumcised beast, As he was wont, betweene the hosts doth come, And with his harsh voyce, like an unbrac'd Drum, Cals to the host of Israel, where's your man You cowardly Nation, where's your Champian To undertake me, bring him to the field, Or to Philistia your subjection yeeld. It was full Summer, and the day so cleere, As not a little cloud did once appeare; In view of either Army, the free Sunne That t'wards the noonsted halfe his course had runne, On the Philistian darting his cleere rayes, His bright refulgent Armes so sundry wayes Reflects the beames, as that he seemes to all Like that in painting we a Glory call, And from his Helmet sharpning like a Spyre, He lookt like to a Piramid on fire. And now before yong David should come in, The host of Israel somewhat doth begin To rouze it selfe; some climbe the nearest Tree, And some the tops of Tents, whence they might see How this unarmed Youth himselfe would beare Against th'all-armed Giant (which they feare) Some get up to the fronts of easie hills; That by their motion a vast murmure fills The neighbouring Valleys, that th'enemy thought Something would by the Israelites be wrought They had not heard of, and they long'd to see What strange or warlike stratagem 't should be. When soone they saw a goodly Youth descend Himselfe alone, none after to attend, That at his need with armes might him supply, As meerely carelesse of his enemy. His head uncovered, and his locks of hayre As he came on being play'd with by the ayre Tost to and fro, did with such pleasure move, As they had beene provocatives for love: His sleeves stript up above his elbowes were, And in his hand a stiffe short staffe did beare, Which by the leather to it, and the string, They easily might discerne to be a Sling; Suting to these he wore a Sheepheards Scrip, Which from his side hung downe upon his Hip. Those for a Champion that did him disdaine, Cast with themselves what such a thing should meane, Some seeing him so wonderously faire, (As in their eyes he stood beyond compare) Their verdict gave that they had sent him sure As a choice bayte their Champion to alure; Others againe, of judgement more precise, Said they had sent him for a sacrifice. And though he seem'd thus to be very yong, Yet was he well proportioned and strong, And with a comely and undaunted grace, Holding a steady and most even pace, This way, nor that way, never stood to gaze, But like a man that death could not amaze, Came close up to Goliah, and so neare As he might easily reach him with his Speare. Which when Goliah saw, why Boy quoth he, Thou desperate Youth, thou tak'st me sure to be Some Dog (I thinke) and under thy command, That thus art come to beat me with a wand: The Kites and Ravens are not farre away, Nor Beasts of ravin that shall make a prey Of a poore corpse, which they from me shall have, And their foule bowels shall be all thy grave. Uncircumcised slave quoth David then, That for thy shape, the monster art of men: Thou thus in brasse com'st arm'd into the field, And thy huge Speare of brasse, of brasse thy Shield: I in the name of Israels God alone, That more then mighty, that eternall one, Am come to meet thee, who bids not to feare, Nor once respect the Armes that thou dost beare. Slave, marke the earth whereon thou now dost stand, I'le make thy length to measure so much land, As thou lyest groveling, and within this houre The Birds and Beasts thy carkasse shall devoure. In meane time David looking in his face, Betweene his temples, saw how large a space He was to hit, steps backe a yard or two, The Gyant wondring what the Youth would doe, Whose nimble hand, out of his Scrip doth bring A pebble stone, and puts it in his Sling, At which the Gyant openly doth jeere, And as in scorne, stands leaning on his Speare, Which gives yong David much content to see, And to himselfe thus secretly saith he, Stand but one minute still, stand but so fast, And have at all Philistia at a cast. When with such slight the shot away he sent, That from his Sling as 't had beene Lightning went; And him so full upon the forehead smit, Which gave a cracke, when his thicke scalpe it hit, As t'had bin throwne against some Rocke or Post, That the shrill clap was heard through either host. Staggering a while upon his Speare he leant, Till on a sodaine, he began to faint; When downe he came, like an old o'regrowne Oake, His huge Roote hewne up by the Labourers stroke, That with his very weight, he shooke the ground, His brazen armour gave a jarring sound Like a crackt Bell, or vessell chanc't to fall From some high place, which did like death apall The proud Philistians, (hopelesse that remaine) To see their Champion great Goliah slaine: When such a shout the host of Israel gave, As cleft the clouds, and like to men that rave, (O'rcome with comfort) crye, the Boy, the Boy, O the brave David, Israels onely joy: Gods chosen Champion, O most wondrous thing, The great Goliah slaine with a poore Sling: Themselves in compasse nor can they containe, Now are they silent, then they shoute againe. Of which no notice, David seemes to take, But towards the Body of the dead doth make; With a faire comely gate, nor doth he runne, As though he gloried in what he had done. But treading on th'uncircumcised dead, With his foot, strikes the Helmet from his head; Which with the sword, ta'n from the Gyants side, He from the body quickly doth divide. Now the Philistians at this fearefull sight, Leaving their Armes, betake themselves to flight; Quitting their Tents, nor dare a minute stay, Time wants to carry any thing away, Being strongly rowted with a generall feare; Yet in pursute, Sauls Army strikes their Reare, To Ekron walles, and slew them as they fled, That Sharams plaines lay covered with the dead: And having put the Philistines to foyle, Backe to the Tents retire, and take the spoyle Of what they left, and ransacking they cry, A David, David, and the victory. When straight waies Saul, his Generall Abner sent For valiant David, that incontinent He should repaire to Court, at whose command He comes along, and beareth in his hand The Gyants head, by th'long hayre of his crowne, Which by his active knee, hung dangling downe. And through the Army as he comes along, To gaze upon him, the glad Souldiers throng: Some doe instile him Israels onely light, And other some the valiant Bethlemite. With Conjayes all salute him as he past, And upon him their gracious glances cast. He was thought base of him that did not boast, Nothing but David, David, through the host. The Virgins to their Timbrels frame their layes, Of him: till Saul grew jealous of his praise: But for his meed doth to his Wife receive Sauls lovely Daughter, where 'tis time I leave. FINIS.</field>

Golden field the Lion passantred, Æneas Nephew (Brute) them conquered. Next, Laureat Cæsar, as a Philtre, brings, On's shield, his Grandame Object not, that it should be the Eagle, because it is now borne by the Emperors; and that some Heralds ignorantly publish it, as J. Cæsars Coat, Double headed. They move me not; for plainly the Eagle was single at that time (unles you call it ?????? ??????? ???????, as Pindar doth Joves Eagle) and but newly us'd among the Romans (first by Marius) as their Standard, not otherwise, untill afterward Constantine made it respect the two Empires: and since, it hath beene borne on a Shield. I tooke Venus proper to him, for that the stamp of hir face (she being his Ancestor Æneas his mother) in his Coins is frequent; and can so maintaine it here fitter, then many of those invented Coats (without colour of reason) attributed to the old Heroes. As for matter of Armory, Venus being a Goddesse may be as good Bearing, if not better then Atalanta, which, by expresse Authority of Euripides, was borne, in the Theban warre by Parthenopœus. Venus: Him hir Kings Withstood. At length, the Roman, by long sute, Gain'd her (most Part) from th'ancient race of Brute. Divors't from Him, the Saxon Hengist hath other Armes in some traditions, which are to be respected as Old wives fictions.

POLY-OLBION. The first Song. The Argument. The sprightly Muse her wing displaies, And the French Ilands first survaies; Beares-up with Neptune, and in glory Transcends proud Cornwalls Promontorie; There crownes Mount-Michaell, and discries How all those Riverets fall and rise; Then takes in Tamer, as shee bounds The Cornish and Devonian grounds. And whilst the Devonshire-Nymphes relate Their loves, their fortunes, and estate, Dert undertaketh to revive Our Brute, and sings his first arrive: Then North-ward to the verge shee bends, And her first Song at Ax shee ends. Of Albions glorious Ile the Wonders whilst I write, The sundry varying soyles, the pleasures infinite (Where heate kills not the cold, nor cold expells the heat, The calmes too mildly small, nor winds too roughly great, Nor night doth hinder day, nor day the night doth wrong, The Summer not too short, the Winter not too long) What helpe shall I invoke to ayde my Muse the while? Thou Genius of the place (this most renowned Ile) Which livedst long before the All-earth-drowning Flood, Whilst yet the world did swarme with her Gigantick brood; Goe thou before me still thy circling shores about, And in this wandring Maze helpe to conduct me out: Direct my course so right, as with thy hand to showe Which way thy Forrests range, which way thy Rivers flowe; Wise Genius, by thy helpe that so I may discry How thy faire Mountaines stand, and how thy Vallyes lie; From those cleere pearlie Cleeves which see the Mornings pride, And check the surlie Impes of Neptune when they chide, Unto the big-swolne waves in the The Western or Spanish Ocean. Iberian streame, Where Titan still unyokes his fiery-hoofed Teame, And oft his flaming locks in lushious Nectar steepes, When from Olympus top he plungeth in the Deepes: That from The coast of little Britaine in France. th'Armorick sands, on surging Neptunes leas Through the Hibernick Gulfe (those rough Vergivian seas) My verse with wings of skill may flie a loftie gate, As Amphitrite clips this Iland Fortunate, Till through the sleepy Maine to The furthest Ile in the British Ocean. Thuly I have gone, And seene the frozen Iles, the cold The Sea upon the north of Scotland. Ducalidon, Amongst whose Iron rockes grym Saturne yet remaines, Bound in those gloomie Caves with Adamantine chaines. Yee sacred The old British Poets. Bards, that to your Harps melodious strings Sung th'ancient Heroës deeds (the monuments of Kings) And in your dreadfull verse ingrav'd the prophecies, The aged worlds descents, and Genealogies; If, as those Priests amongst the ancient Britaines. Druides taught, which kept the British rites, And dwelt in darksome Groves, there counsailing with sprites (But their opinions faild, by error led awry, As since cleere truth hath shew'd to their posteritie) When these our soules by death our bodies doe forsake, They instantlie againe doe other bodies take; I could have wisht your spirits redoubled in my breast, To give my verse applause, to times eternall rest. Thus scarcelie said the Muse, but hovering while she hung Upon the The French Seas. Celtick wastes, the Sea-Nymphes loudlie sung: O ever-happie Iles, your heads so high that beare, By Nature stronglie fenc't, which never need to feare On Neptunes watry Realmes when Eolus raiseth warres, And every billow bounds, as though to quench the starres: Faire Jersey first of these heere scattred in the Deepe, Peculiarlie that boast'st thy double-horned sheepe: Inferior nor to thee, thou Jernsey, bravelie crown'd With rough-imbatteld rocks, whose venom-hating ground The hardned Emerill hath, which thou abroad doost send: Thou Ligon, her belov'd, and Serk, that doost attend Her pleasure everie howre; as Jethow, them at need, With Phesants, fallow Deere, and Conies that doost feed: Yee seaven small sister Iles, and Sorlings, which to see The halfe-sunk sea-man joyes, or whatsoe're you be, From fruitfull Aurney, neere the ancient Celtick shore, To Ushant and the Seames, whereas those Nunnes of yore Gave answers from their Caves, and tooke what shapes they please: Ye happie Ilands set within the British Seas, With shrill and jocund shouts, th'unmeasur'd deepes awake, And let the Gods of Sea their secret Bowres forsake, Whilst our industrious Muse great Britaine forth shall bring, Crown'd with those glorious wreathes that beautifie the Spring; And whilst greene Thetis Nymphes, with many an amorous lay Sing our Invention safe unto her long-wisht Bay. Upon the utmost end of Cornwalls furrowing beake, Where A small Iland upon the very point of Cornwall. Bresan from the Land the tilting waves doth breake; The shore let her transcend, the A hill lying out, as an elbowe of land, into the Sea. Promont to discry, And viewe about the Point th'unnumbred Fowle that fly. Some, rising like a storme from off the troubled sand, Seeme in their hovering flight to shadow all the land; Some, sitting on the beach to prune their painted breasts, As if both earth and aire they onelie did possesse. Whence, climing to the Cleeves, her selfe she firmlie sets The Bourns, the Brooks, the Becks, the Rills, the Rivilets, Exactlie to derive; receiving in her way That straightned tongue of Land, where, at Mount-Michaells Bay, Rude Neptune cutting in, a cantle forth doth take; And, on the other side, Hayles vaster mouth doth make A Chersonese thereof, the corner clipping in: Where to th'industrious Muse the Mount doth thus begin; Before thou further passe, and leave this setting shore, Whose Townes unto the Saints that lived heere of yore (Their fasting, works, &amp; pray'rs, remaining to our shames) Were rear'd, and justly call'd by their peculiar names, The builders honour still; this due and let them have, As deigne to drop a teare upon each holie Grave; Whose charitie and zeale, in steed of knowledge stood: For, surely in themselves they were right simply good. If, credulous too much, thereby th'offended heaven In their devout intents, yet be their sinnes forgiven. Then from his rugged top the teares downe trickling fell; And in his passion stirr'd, againe began to tell Strange things, that in his daies times course had brought to pass, That fortie miles now Sea, sometimes firme fore-land was; And that a Forrest then, which now with him is Flood, Whereof he first was call'd the Hoare-Rock in the Wood; Relating then how long this soile had laine forlorne, As that her Genius now had almost her forsworne, And of their ancient love did utterly repent, Sith to destroy her selfe that fatall toole she lent By which th'insatiate slave her intrailes out doth draw, That thrusts his gripple hand into her golden mawe; And for his part doth wish, that it were in his power To let the Ocean in, her wholly to devoure. Which, Hayle doth over-heare, and much doth blame his rage, And told him (to his teeth) hee doated with his age. For Hayle (a lustie Nymph, bent all to amorous play, And having quicke recourse into the Severne Sea With Neptunes Pages oft disporting in the Deepe; One never touch't with care; but how her selfe to keepe In excellent estate) doth thus againe intreate; Muse, leave the wayward Mount to his distempred heate, Who nothing can produce but what doth taste of spight: Ile shew thee things of ours most worthy thy delight. Behold our Diamonds heere, as in the quarr's they stand, By Nature neatly cut, as by a skilfull hand, Who varieth them in formes, both curiouslie and oft; Which for shee (wanting power) produceth them too soft, That vertue which she could not liberallie impart, Shee striveth to amend by her owne proper Art. Besides, the Seaholme heere, that spreadeth all our shore, The sick consuming man so powerfull to restore: Whose roote th'Eringo is, the reines that doth inflame So stronglie to performe the Cytheræan game, That generally approov'd, both farre and neere is sought. And our Main-Amber heere, and Burien Trophy, thought Much wrongd, not yet preferd for wonders with the rest. But, the laborious Muse, upon her journey prest, Thus uttereth to her selfe; To guide my course aright, What Mound or steddie Mere is offered to my sight Upon this out-stretcht Arme, whilst sayling heere at ease, Betwixt the Southern waste, and the Sabrinian seas, I view those wanton Brookes, that waxing, still doe wane; That scarcelie can conceive, but brought to bed againe; Scarce rising from the Spring (that is their naturall Mother) To growe into a streame, but buried in another. When Chore doth call her on, that wholly doth betake Her selfe unto the Loo; transform'd into a Lake, Through that impatient love shee had to entertaine The lustfull Neptune oft; whom when his wracks restraine, Impatient of the wrong, impetuouslie hee raves: And in his ragefull flowe, the furious King of waves, Breaks foming o're the Beach, whom nothing seemes to coole, Till he have wrought his will on that capacious Poole: Where Menedge, by his Brookes, a A place almost invironed with water, welneer an Iland. Chersonese is cast, Widening the slender shore to ease it in the wast; A Promont jutting out into the dropping South, That with his threatning cleeves in horrid Neptunes mouth, Derides him and his power: nor cares how him he greets. Next, Roseland (as his friend, the mightier Menedge) meets Great Neptune when he swells, and rageth at the Rocks (Set out into those seas) inforcing through his shocks Those armes of Sea, that thrust into the tinny strand, By their Meandred creeks indenting of that Land Whose fame by everie tongue is for her Myneralls hurld, Neere from the mid-daies point, throughout the Westerne world. Heere Vale, a livelie flood, her nobler name that gives To The bravery of Flamouth Haven. Flamouth; and by whom, it famous ever lives, Whose entrance is from sea so intricatelie wound, Her haven angled so about her harbrous sound, That in her quiet Bay a hundred ships may ride, Yet not the tallest mast, be of the tall'st descri'd; Her braverie to this Nymph when neighbouring rivers told, Her mind to them againe shee brieflie doth unfold; Let This hath also the name of Alan. Camell, of her course, and curious windings boast, In that her Greatness raignes sole Mistress of that coast Twixt Tamer and that Bay, where Hayle poures forth her pride: And let us (nobler Nymphs) upon the mid-daie side, Be frolick with the best. Thou Foy, before us all, By thine owne named Towne made famous in thy fall, As Low, amongst us heere; a most delicious Brooke, With all our sister Nymphes, that to the noone-sted looke, Which glyding from the hills, upon the tinny ore, Betwixt your high-rear'd banks, resort to this our shore: Lov'd streames, let us exult, and thinke our selves no lesse Then those upon their side, the Setting that possesse. Which, Camell over-heard: but what doth she respect Their taunts, her proper course that loosely doth neglect? As frantick, ever since her British Arthurs blood, By Mordreds murtherous hand was mingled with her flood. For, as that River, best might boast that Conquerours breath, So sadlie shee bemoanes his too untimelie death; Who, after twelve proud fields against the Saxon fought, Yet back unto her banks by fate was lastly brought: As though no other place on Britaines spacious earth, Were worthie of his end, but where he had his birth: And carelesse ever since how shee her course doe steere, This muttreth to her selfe, in wandring here and there; Even in the agedst face, where beautie once did dwell, And nature (in the least) but seemed to excell, Time cannot make such waste, but something wil appeare, To shewe some little tract of delicacie there. Or some religious worke, in building manie a day, That this penurious age hath suffred to decay, Some lim or modell, dragd out of the ruinous mass, The richness will declare in glorie whilst it was: But time upon my waste committed hath such theft, That it of Arthur heere scarce memorie hath left: The Nine-ston'd Trophie thus whilst shee doth entertaine, Proude Tamer swoopes along, with such a lustie traine As fits so brave a flood two Countries that divides: So, to increase her strength, shee from her equall sides Receives their severall rills; and of the Cornish kind, First, taketh Atre in: and her not much behind Comes Kensey: after whom, cleere Enian in doth make, In Tamers roomthier bankes, their rest that scarcelie take. Then Lyner, though the while aloofe shee seem'd to keepe, Her Soveraigne when shee sees t'approach the surgefull deepe, To beautifie her fall her plentious tribute brings. This honours Tamer much: that shee whose plentious springs, Those proud aspyring hills, Bromwelly and his frend High Rowter, from their tops impartiallie commend, And is by A worthy Gentleman, who writ the description of Cornwall. Carewes Muse, the river most renound, Associate should her grace to the Devonian ground, Which in those other Brookes doth Emulation breed. Of which, first Car comes crown'd, with oziar, segs and reed: Then Lid creeps on along, and taking Thrushel, throwes Her selfe amongst the rocks; and so incavern'd goes, That of the blessed light (from other floods) debarr'd, To bellowe under earth, she onelie can be heard, As those that view her tract, seemes strangelie to affright: So, Toovy straineth in; and Plym, that claimes by right The christning of that Bay, which beares her nobler name. Upon the British coast, what ship yet ever came The praise of Plymouth. That not of Plymouth heares, where those brave Navies lie, From Canons thundring throats, that all the world defie? Which, to invasive spoile, when th'English list to draw, Have checkt Iberias pride, and held her oft in awe: Oft furnishing our Dames, with Indias rar'st devices, And lent us gold, and pearle, rich silks, and daintie spices. But Tamer takes the place, and all attend her here, A faithfull bound to both; and two that be so neare For likeliness of soile, and quantitie they hold, Before the Roman came; whose people were of old Knowne by one generall name, upon this point that dwell, All other of this Ile in wrastling that excell: With collars be they yokt, to prove the arme at length, Like Bulls set head to head, with meere delyver strength: Or by the girdles graspt, they practise with the hip, The words of Art in wrastling.The forward, backward, falx, the mare, the turne, the trip, When stript into their shirts, each other they invade Within a spacious ring, by the beholders made, According to the law. Or when the Ball to throw, And drive it to the Gole, in squadrons forth they goe: And to avoid the troupes (their forces that fore-lay) Through dikes and rivers make, in this robustious play; By which, the toiles of warre most livelie are exprest. But Muse, may I demaund, Why these of all the rest (As mightie Albyons eld'st) most active are and strong? From Our first great wrastler ariving heere with Brute. Corin came it first, or from the use so long? Or that this fore-land lies furth'st out into his sight, Which spreads his vigorous flames on everie lesser light? With th'vertue of his beames, this place that doth inspire: Whose pregnant wombe prepar'd by his all-powerful fire, Being purelie hot and moist, projects that fruitfull seed, Which stronglie doth beget, and doth as stronglie breed: The weldisposed heaven heere prooving to the earth, A Husband furthering fruite; a Midwife helping birth. But whilst th'industrious Muse thus labours to relate Those rillets that attend proud Tamer and her state, A neighbourer of this Nymphes, as high in Fortunes grace, And whence calme Tamer trippes, cleere Towridge in that place Is poured from her spring; and seemes at first to flowe That way which Tamer straines: but as she great doth growe Remembreth to fore-see, what Rivalls she should find To interrupt her course: whose so unsettled mind Ock comming in perceives, &amp; thus doth her perswade; Now Neptune shield (bright Nymph) thy beautie should be made The object of her scorne, which (for thou canst not be Upon the Southern side so absolute as shee) Will awe thee in thy course. Wherefore, faire flood recoile: And where thou maist alone be soveraigne of the soile, There exercise thy power, thy braveries and displaie: Turne Towridge, let us back to the Sabrinian sea; Where Thetis handmaids still in that recoursefull deepe With those rough Gods of Sea, continuall revells keepe; There maist thou live admir'd, the mistress of the Lake. Wise Ock shee doth obey, returning, and doth take The Tawe: which from her fount forc't on with amorous gales, And easely ambling downe through the Devonian dales, Brings with her Moule and Bray, her banks that gentlie bathe; Which on her daintie breast, in many a silver swathe Shee beares unto that Bay, where Barstable beholds, How her beloved Tawe cleere Towridge there enfolds. The confluence of these Brooks divulg'd in Dertmoore, bred Distrust in her sad breast, that shee, so largelie spred, And in this spacious Shire the neer'st the Center set Of anie place of note; that these should bravelie get The praise, from those that sprung out of her pearlie lap; Which, nourisht and bred up at her most plentious pap, No sooner taught to dade, but from their Mother trip, And in their speedie course, strive others to out-strip. The Yalme, the Awne, the Aume, by spacious Dertmoore fed, And in the Southern Sea, b'ing likewise brought to bed; That these were not of power to publish her desert, Much griev'd the ancient Moore: which understood by Dert (From all the other floods that onely takes her name, And as her eld'st (in right) the heire of all her fame) To shew her nobler spirit it greatlie doth behove. Deare Mother, from your breast this feare (quoth she) remove: Defie their utmost force: ther's not the proudest flood, That falls betwixt the Mount and Exmore, shall make good Her royaltie with mine, with me nor can compare: I challenge any one, to answere me that dare; That was, before them all, predestinate to meet My Britaine-founding Brute, when with his puissant fleet At Totnesse first he toucht: which shall renowne my streame (Which now the envious world doth slander for a dreame.) Whose fatall flight from Greece, his fortunate arrive In happy Albyon heere whilst stronglie I revive, Deare Harburne at thy hands this credit let me win, Quoth she, that as thou hast my faithfull hand-maid bin: So now (my onelie Brooke) assist me with thy spring, Whilst of the God-like Brute the storie thus I sing. When long-renowned Troy lay spent in hostile fire, And aged Priams pompe did with her flames expire, Aeneas (taking thence Ascanius, his young sonne, And his most reverent Sire, the grave Anchises, wonne From sholes of slaughtering Greeks) set out from Simois shores; And through the Tirrhene Sea, by strength of toyling ores, Raught Italie at last: where, King Latinus lent Safe harbor for his ships, with wrackfull tempests rent: When, in the Latine Court, Lavinia young and faire (Her Fathers onely child, and kingdoms onely heire) Upon the Trojan Lord her liking stronglie plac't, And languisht in the fiers that her faire breast imbrac't: But, Turnus (at that time) the proud Rutulian King, A suter to the maid, Aeneas malicing, By force of Armes attempts, his rivall to extrude: But, by the Teucrian power courageouslie subdu'd, Bright Cythereas sonne the Latine crowne obtain'd; And dying, in his stead his sonne Ascanius raign'd. Next, Silvius him succeeds, begetting Brute againe: Who in his Mothers wombe whilst yet he did remaine, The Oracles gave out, that next borne Brute should bee His Parents onelie death: which soone they liv'd to see. For, in his painfull birth his Mother did depart; And ere his fifteenth yeere, in hunting of a Hart, He with a lucklesse shaft his haplesse Father slew: For which, out of his throne, their King the Latines threw. Who, wandring in the world, to Greece at last doth get. Where, whilst he liv'd unknowne, and oft with want beset, He of the race of Troy a remnant hapt to find, There by the Grecians held; which (having still in mind Their tedious tenne yeeres warre, and famous Heroës slaine) In slaverie with them still those Trojans did detaine: Which Pyrrhus thither brought (and did with hate pursue, To wreake Achilles death, at Troy whom Paris slew) There, by Pandrasus kept, in sad and servile awe. Who, when they knew young Brute, &amp; that brave shape they saw, They humbly him desire, that he a meane would bee, From those imperious Greeks, his countrymen to free. Hee, finding out a rare and sprightly Youth, to fit His humour every way, for courage, power, and wit, Assaracus (who, though that by his Sire he were A Prince amongst the Greeks, yet held the Trojans deere; Descended of their stock upon the Mothers side: For which, he by the Greeks his birth-right was deni'd) Impatient of his wrongs, with him brave Brute arose, And of the Trojan youth courageous Captaines chose, Raysd Earth-quakes with their Drummes, the ruffling Ensignes reare And, gathering young and old that rightlie Trojan were, Up to the Mountaines march, through straits and forrests strong: Where, taking-in the Townes, pretended to belong Unto that Assaracus. Grecian Lord, some forces there they put: Within whose safer walls their wives and children shut, Into the fields they drew, for libertie to stand. Which when Pandrasus heard, he sent his strict command To levie all the power he presentlie could make: So, to their strengths of warre the Trojans them betake. But whilst the Grecian Guides (not knowing how or where The Teucrians were entrencht, or what their forces were) In foule disordred troupes yet straggled, as secure, This loosness to their spoyle the Trojans did allure, Who fiercely them assail'd: where stanchlesse furie rap't The Grecians in so fast, that scarcely one escap't: Yea, proud Pandrasus flight, himselfe could hardlie free. Who, when he saw his force thus frustrated to bee, And by his present losse, his passed error found (As by a later warre to cure a former wound) Doth reinforce his power to make a second fight. When they whose better wits had over-matcht his might, Loth what they got to lose, as politiquelie cast His Armies to intrap, in getting to them fast Antigonus as friend, and Anaclet his pheere (Surpriz'd in the last fight) by gifts who hired were Into the Grecian Campe th'insuing night to goe And faine they were stolne forth, to their Allies to show How they might have the spoile of all the Trojan pride; And gaining them beleefe, the credulous Grecians guide Into th'ambushment neere, that secretlie was laid: So to the Trojans hands the Grecians were betraid; Pandrasus selfe surpriz'd; his Crown who to redeeme (Which scarcely worth their wrong the Trojan race esteeme) Their slaverie long sustain'd did willinglie release: And (for a lasting league of amitie and peace) Bright Innogen, his child, for wife to Brutus gave, And furnisht them a fleete, with all things they could crave To set them out to Sea. Who lanching, at the last They on Lergecia light, an Ile; and, ere they past, Unto a Temple built to great Diana there, The noble Brutus went; wise One of the titles of Diana. Trivia to enquire, To shew them where the stock of ancient Troy to place. The Goddesse, that both knew and lov'd the Trojan race, Reveal'd to him in dreames, that furthest to the West, He should discrie the Ile of Albion, highlie blest; With Giants latelie stor'd; their numbers now decaid: By vanquishing the rest, his hopes should there be staid: Where, from the stock of Troy, those puissant Kings should rise, Whose conquests from the West, the world should scant suffice. Thus answer'd; great with hope, to sea they put againe, And safelie under saile, the howres doe entertaine With sights of sundrie shores, which they from farre discrie: And viewing with delight th'Azarian Mountaines hie, One walking on the deck, unto his friend would say (As I have heard some tell) So goodly Ida lay. Thus talking mongst themselves, they sun-burnt Africk keepe Upon the lee-ward still, and (sulking up the deepe) For Mauritania make: where putting-in, they find A remnant (yet reserv'd) of th'ancient Dardan kind, By brave Antenor brought from out the Greekish spoiles (O long-renowned Troy! Of thee, and of thy toyles, What Country had not heard?) which, to their Generall, then Great Corineus had, the strong'st of mortall men: To whom (with joyfull harts) Dianas will they show. Whoe easlie beeing wonne along with them to goe, They altogether put into the watry Plaine: Oft-times with Pyrats, oft with Monsters of the Maine Distressed in their way; whom hope forbids to feare. Those pillars first they passe which Joves great sonne did reare. And cuffing those sterne waves which like huge Mountaines roule (Full joy in every part possessing every soule) In Aquitane at last the Ilion race arrive. Whom strongly to repulse when as those recreants strive, They (anchoring there at first but to refresh their fleet, Yet saw those savage men so rudely them to greet) Unshipt their warlike youth, advauncing to the shore. The Dwellers, which perceiv'd such danger at the dore, Their King Groffarius get to raise his powerfull force: Who, mustring up an host of mingled foote and horse, Upon the Trojans set; when suddainly began A fierce and dangerous fight: where Corineus ran With slaughter through the thick-set squadrons of the foes; And with his armed Axe laid on such deadlie blowes, That heapes of livelesse trunks each passage stopt up quite. Groffarius having lost the honour of the fight, Repaires his ruin'd powers; not so to give them breath: When they, which must be free'd by conquest or by death, And, conquering them before, hop't now to doe no lesse (The like in courage still) stand for the like successe. Then sterne and deadlie Warre put-on his horridst shape; And wounds appear'd so wide, as if the Grave did gape To swallow both at once; which strove as both should fall, When they with slaughter seem'd to be encircled all: Where Turon (of the rest) Brutes Sisters valiant sonne (By whose approved deeds that day was chiefly wonne) Sixe hundred slue out-right through his peculiar strength: By multitudes of men yet over-prest at length. His nobler Uncle there, to his immortall name, The Citie Turon built, and well endow'd the same. For Albion sayling then, th'arrived quicklie heere (O! never in this world men halfe so joyful were With shoutes heard up to heaven, when they beheld the Land) And in this verie place where Totnesse now doth stand, First set their Gods of Troy, kissing the blessed shore; Then, forraging this Ile, long promisd them before, Amongst the ragged Cleeves those monstrous Giants sought: Who (of their dreadfull kind) t'appall the Trojans, brought Great Gogmagog, an Oake that by the roots could teare: So mightie were (that time) the men who lived there: But, for the use of Armes he did not understand (Except some rock or tree, that comming next to hand Hee raz'd out of the earth to execute his rage) Hee challenge makes for strength, and offereth there his gage. Which, Corin taketh up, to answer by and by, Upon this sonne of Earth his utmost power to try. All, doubtful to which part the victorie would goe, Upon that loftie place at Plimmouth call'd the Hoe, Those mightie The description of the wrastling betwixt Corineus and Gogmagog. Wrastlers met; with many an irefull looke Who threatned, as the one hold of the other tooke: But, grapled, glowing fire shines in their sparkling eyes. And, whilst at length of arme one from the other lyes, Their lusty sinewes swell like cables, as they strive: Their feet such trampling make, as though they forc't to drive A thunder out of earth; which stagger'd with the weight: Thus, eithers utmost force urg'd to the greatest height. Whilst one upon his hip the other seekes to lift, And th'adverse (by a turne) doth from his cunning shift, Their short-fetcht troubled breath a hollow noise doth make, Like bellowes of a Forge. Then Corin up doth take The Giant twixt the grayns; and, voyding of his hould (Before his combrous feet he well recover could) Pitcht head-long from the hill; as when a man doth throw An Axtree, that with sleight deliverd from the toe Rootes up the yeelding earth: so that his violent fall, Strooke Neptune with such strength, as shouldred him withall; That where the monstrous waves like Mountaines late did stand, They leap't out of the place, and left the bared sand To gaze upon wide heaven: so great a blowe it gave. For which, the conquering Brute, on Corineus brave This horne of land bestow'd, and markt it with his name; Of Corin, Cornwall call'd, to his immortall fame. Cleere Dert delivering thus the famous Brutes arrive, Inflam'd with her report, the stragling rivelets strive So highlie her to raise, that Ting (whose banks were blest By her beloved Nymph deere Leman) which addrest And fullie with her selfe determined before To sing the Danish spoyles committed on her shore, When hither from the East they came in mightie swarmes, Nor could their native earth containe their numerous Armes, Their surcrease grew so great, as forced them at last To seeke another soyle (as Bees doe when they cast) And by their impious pride how hard she was bested, When all the Country swam with blood of Saxons shed: This River (as I said) which had determin'd long The Deluge of the Danes exactlie to have song, It utterlie neglects; and studying how to doe The Dert those high respects belonging her unto, Inviteth goodlie Ex, who from her ful-fed spring Her little Barlee hath, and Dunsbrook her to bring From Exmore: when she yet hath scarcely found her course, Then Creddy commeth in, and Forto, which inforce Her faster to her fall; as Ken her closelie clips, And on her Easterne side sweet Leman gentlie slips Into her widened banks, her Soveraigne to assist; As Columb winnes for Ex, cleere Wever and the Clist, Contributing their streames their Mistress fame to raise. As all assist the Ex, so Ex consumeth these; Like some unthriftie youth, depending on the Court, To winne an idle name, that keepes a needless port; And raising his old rent, exacts his Farmers store The Land-lord to enrich, the Tenants wondrous poore: Who having lent him theirs, he then consumes his owne, That with most vaine expense upon the Prince is throwne: So these, the lesser Brooks unto the greater pay; The greater, they againe spend all upon the Sea: As, Otrey (that her name doth of the Otters take, Abounding in her banks) and Ax, their utmost make To ayde stout Dert, that dar'd Brutes storie to revive. For, when the Saxon first the Britans forth did drive, Some up into the hills themselves o're Severne shut: Upon this point of land, for refuge others put, To that brave race of Brute still fortunate. For where Great Brute first disembarqu't his wandring Trojans, there His ofspring (after long expulst the Inner land, When they the Saxon power no longer could withstand) Found refuge in their flight; where Ax and Otrey first Gave these poore soules to drinke, opprest with grievous thirst. Heere I'le unyoke awhile, and turne my steeds to meat: The land growes large and wide: my Teame begins to sweat. The second Song. The Argument. The Muse from Marshwood way commands, Along the shore through Chesills sands: Where, overtoyld, her heate to coole, Shee bathes her in the pleasant Poole: Thence, over-land againe doth scowre, To fetch in Froome, and bring downe Stowre; Falls with New-forrest, as she sings The wanton Wood-Nymphes revellings. Whilst Itchin in her loftie layes, Chaunts Bevis of South-hamptons praise, Shee Southward with her active flight Is wafted to the Ile of Wight, To see the rutte the Sea-gods keepe: There swaggering in the Solent deepe. Thence Hampshire-ward her way shee bends; And visiting her Forrest friends, Neere Salsbury her rest doth take: Which shee her second pause doth make. March strongly forth my Muse, whilst yet the temperat aire Invites us, easely on to hasten our repaire. Thou powerfull God of flames (in verse divinely great) Touch my invention so with thy true genuine heate, That high and noble things I slightly may not tell, Nor light and idle toyes my lines may vainly swell; But as my subject serves, so hie or lowe to straine, And to the varying earth so sute my varying vaine, That Nature in my worke thou maist thy power avow: That as thou first found'st Art, and didst her rules allow; So I, to thine owne selfe that gladlie neere would bee, May herein doe the best, in imitating thee: As thou hast heere a hill, a vale there, there a flood, A mead here, there a heath, and now and then a wood, These things so in my Song I naturally may showe; Now, as the Mountaine hie; then, as the Valley lowe: Heere, fruitfull as the Mead, there as the Heath be bare; Then, as the gloomie wood, I may be rough; though rare. Through the Dorsetian fields that lie in open view, My progresse I againe must seriouslie pursue, From Marshwoods fruitfull Vale my journey on to make: (As Phœbus getting up out of the Easterne lake, Refresht with ease and sleepe, is to his labour prest; Even so the labouring Muse, heere baited with this rest.) Whereas the little Lim along doth easelie creepe, And Car, that comming downe unto the troubled Deepe, Brings on the neighbouring Bert, whose batning mellowed banke, From all the British soyles, for Hempe most hugely ranke Doth beare away the best; to Bert-port which hath gain'd That praise from every place, and worthilie obtain'd By Act of Parliament 21. Hen. 8.Our cordage from her store, and cables should be made, Of any in that kind most fit for Marine trade: Not sever'd from the shore, aloft where Chesill lifts Her ridged snake-like sands, in wrecks and smouldring drifts, Which by the South-wind raysd, are heav'd on little hills: Whose valleys with his flowes when foming Neptune fills, The beautie of the many Swannes upon the Chesills, noted in this Poëticall delicacie.Upon a thousand Swannes the naked Sea-Nymphes ride Within the ouzie Pooles, replenisht every Tide: Which running on, the Ile of Portland pointeth out; Upon whose moisted skirt with sea-weed fring'd about, The bastard Corall breeds, that drawne out of the brack, A brittle stalke becomes, from greenish turn'd to black: Which th'Ancients, for the love that they to Isis bare (Their Goddesse most ador'd) have sacred for her haire. Of which the Naïdes, and the blew Sea-Nymphs. Nereides make Them A kind of neck-laces worne by country wenches. Taudries for their necks: when sporting in the Lake, They to their secrete Bowres the Sea-gods entertaine. Where Portland from her top doth over-peere the Maine; Her rugged front empal'd (on every part) with rocks, Though indigent of wood, yet fraught with woolly flocks: Most famous for her folke, excelling with the sling, Of any other heere this Land inhabiting; That there-with they in warre offensivelie might wound, If yet the use of shot Invention had not found. Where, from the neighbouring hills her passage Wey doth path: Whose haven, not our least that watch the mid-day, hath The glories that belong unto a complete Port; Though Wey the least of all the Naïdes that resort To the Dorsetian sands, from off the higher shore. Then Frome (a nobler flood) the Muses doth implore Her mother Blackmores state they sadly would bewaile; Whose bigge and lordlie Oakes once bore as brave a saile As they themselves that thought the largest shades to spred: But mans devouring hand, with all the earth not fed, Hath hew'd her Timber downe. Which wounded, when it fell, By the great noise it made, the workmen seem'd to tell The losse that to the Land would shortlie come thereby, Where no man ever plants to our posteritie: That when sharp Winter shoots her sleet and hardned haile, Or suddaine gusts from Sea, the harmlesse Deere assaile, The shrubs are not of power to sheeld them from the wind. Deere Mother, quoth the Froome, too late (alas) we find The softness of thy sward continued through thy soile, To be the onely cause of unrecover'd spoile: When scarce the British ground a finer grasse doth beare; And wish I could, quoth shee, (if wishes helpfull were) Thou never by that name of White-hart hadst been known, But stiled Blackmore still, which rightly was thine owne. For why, that change foretold the ruine of thy state: Lo, thus the world may see what tis to innovate. By this, her owne nam'd Frampton. Towne the wandring Froome had past: And quitting in her course old Dorcester at last, Approaching neere the Poole, at Warham on her way, As easelie shee doth fall into the peacefull Bay, Upon her nobler side, and to the South-ward neere, Faire Purbeck shee beholds, which no where hath her peere: So pleasantlie in-Il'd on mightie Neptunes marge, A Forest-Nymph, and one of chaste Dianas charge, Imploy'd in Woods and Launds her Deere to feed and kill: On whom the watrie God would oft have had his will, And often her hath woo'd, which never would be wonne; But, Purbeck (as profest a Huntresse and a Nunne) The wide and wealthy Sea, nor all his power respects: Her Marble-minded breast, impregnable, rejects The Monsters of the Sea, supposed Neptunes Gard. uglie Orks, that for their Lord the Ocean wooe. Whilst Froome was troubled thus where nought shee hath to doe The Piddle, that this while be stird her nimble feet, In falling to the Poole her sister Froome to meet, And having in her traine two little slender rills (Besides her proper Spring) where-with her banks shee fills, To whom since first the world this later name her lent, Who ancientlie was knowne to be instiled The ancient name of Piddle. Trent, Her small assistant Brookes her second name have gain'd. Whilst Piddle and the Froome each other entertain'd, Oft praysing lovely Poole, their best-beloved Bay, Thus Piddle her bespake, to passe the time away; When Poole (quoth shee) was young, a lustie Sea-borne Lass, Great Albyon to this Nymph an earnest suter was; And bare himselfe so well, and so in favour came, That he in little time, upon this lovelie Dame Begot three mayden Iles, his darlings and delight: The eldest, Brunksey call'd; the second, Fursey hight; The storie of Poole.The youngest and the last, and lesser then the other, Saint Hellens name doth beare, the dilling of her Mother. And, for the goodlie Poole was one of Thetis traine, Who scorn'd a Nymph of hers, her Virgin-band should staine, Great Albyon (that fore-thought, the angrie Goddesse would Both on the Dam and brats take what revenge shee could) I'th bosome of the Poole his little children plac't: First, Brunksey; Fursey next; and little Hellen last; Then, with his mightie armes doth clip the Poole about, To keepe the angrie Queene, fierce Amphitrite out. Against whose lordlie might shee musters up her waves; And strongly thence repulst (with madness) scoulds and raves. When now, from Poole, the Muse (up to her pitch to get) Her selfe in such a place from sight doth almost set, As by the active power of her commanding wings, She (Falcon-like) from farre doth fetch those plentious Springs. Where Stour receives her strength from Stour riseth from six fountaines. sixe cleere Fountaines fed; Which gathering to one streame from every severall head, Her new-beginning banke her water scarcely weelds; And fairelie entreth first on the Dorsetian feelds: Where Gillingham with gifts that for a God were meet (Enameld paths, rich wreaths, and every soveraine sweet The earth and ayre can yeeld, with many a pleasure mixt) Receives her. Whilst there past great kindness them betwixt, The Forrest her bespoke; How happie floods are yee, From our predestin'd plagues that priviledged bee; Which onelie with the fish which in your banks doe breed, And dailie there increase, mans gurmandize can feed? But had this wretched Age such uses to imploy Your waters, as the woods we latelie did enjoy, Your chanels they would leave as barren by their spoile, As they of all our trees have lastlie left our soile. Insatiable Time thus all things doth devour: What ever saw the sunne, that is not in Times power? Yee fleeting Streames last long, out-living manie a day: But, on more stedfast things Time makes the strongest pray. Now tow'rds the Solent sea as Stour her way doth ply, On Shaftsbury (by chance) shee cast her crystall eye, From whose foundation first, such strange reports arise As brought into her mind the Eagles prophecies; Of that so dreadfull plague, which all great Britaine swept, From that which highest flew, to that which lowest crept, Before the Saxon thence the Britaine should expell, And all that there-upon successively befell. How then the bloodie Dane subdu'd the Saxon race; And, next, the Norman tooke possession of the place: Those ages, once expir'd, the Fates to bring about, The British Line restor'd; the Norman linage out. Then, those prodigious signes to ponder shee began, Which afterward againe the Britans wrack fore-ran; How here the Owle at noone in publique streets was seene, As though the peopled Townes had way-less Deserts been. And whilst the loathly Toad out of his hole doth crall, And makes his fulsome stoole amid the Princes hall, The crystall fountaine turn'd into a gory wound, And bloodie issues brake (like ulcers) from the ground; The Seas against their course with double Tides returne, And oft were seene by night like boyling pitch to burne. Thus thinking, livelie Stour bestirres her tow'rds the Maine; Which Lidden leadeth out: then Dulas beares her traine From Blackmore, that at once their watry tribute bring: When, like some childish wench, shee looselie wantoning, With tricks and giddie turnes seemes to in-Ile the shore. Betwixt her fishfull banks, then forward shee doth scowre, Untill shee lastlie reach cleere Alen in her race: Which calmlie commeth downe from her deere mother Cranburn Chase. Chase, Of Cranburn that is call'd; who greatly joyes to see A Riveret borne of her, for Stours should reckned bee, Of that renowned flood, a favourite highlie grac't. Whilst Cranburn, for her child so fortunatelie plac't, With Ecchoes everie way applauds her Alens state, A suddaine noise from Holt Forest. Holt seems to congratulate With Cranburn for her Brooke so happily bestow'd: Where, to her neighboring Chase, the curteous Forrest show'd So just conceived joy, that from each rising A wood in English. hurst, Where many a goodlie Oake had carefullie been nurst, The Sylvans in their songs their mirthfull meeting tell; And Satyres, that in slades and gloomy dimbles dwell, Runne whooting to the hills to clappe their ruder hands. As Holt had done before, so Canfords goodlie Launds (Which leane upon the Poole) enricht with Coppras vaines, Rejoyce to see them joyn'd. When downe from Sarum Plaines Cleere Avon comming in her sister Stour doth call, And at New-forrests foote into the Sea doe fall, Which every day bewaile that deed so full of dred Whereby shee (now so proud) became first Forrested: Shee now who for her site even boundless seem'd to lie, Her beeing that receiv'd by Williams tyrannie; Providing Lawes to keepe those Beasts heere planted then, Whose lawless will from hence before had driven men; That where the harth was warm'd with Winters feasting fiers, The melancholie Hare is form'd in brakes and briers: The aged ranpick trunk where Plow-men cast their seed, And Churches over-whelm'd with nettles, ferne and weed, By Conquering William first cut off from every trade, That heere the Norman still might enter to invade; That on this vacant place, and unfrequented shore, New forces still might land, to ayde those heere before. But shee, as by a King and Conqueror made so great, By whom shee was allow'd and limited her seat, The Forests of Hampshire, with their situations.Into her owne-selfe praise most insolently brake, And her lesse fellow Nymphs, New-forrest thus bespake: Thou Buckholt, bow to mee, so let thy sister Bere; Chute, kneele thou at my name on this side of the Shiere: Where, for their Goddesse, mee the Nymphs that live &amp; die with Oakes. Driads shall adore, With Waltham, and the Bere, that on the Sea-worne shore See at the Southerne Iles the Tides at tilt to runne; And Woolmer, placed hence upon the rising sunne, With Ashholt thine Allie (my Wood-Nymphs) and with you, Proud Pamber tow'rds the North, ascribe me worship due. Before my Princelie State let your poore greatness fall: And vaile your tops to mee, the Soveraigne of you all. Amongst the Rivers, so, great discontent there fell. Th'efficient cause thereof (as loud report doth tell) Was, that the sprightly Test arising up in Chute, To Itchin, her Allie, great weakeness should impute, That shee, to her owne wrong, and every others griefe, Would needs be telling things exceeding all beliefe: For, she had given it out South-hampton should not loose Her famous Bevis so, wer't in her power to choose; And, for great Arthurs seat, her Winchester preferres, Whose old Round-table, yet she vaunteth to be hers: And swore, th'inglorious time should not bereave her right; But what it could obscure, she would reduce to light. For, from that wondrous A Poole neer unto Alresford, yeelding an unusual abundance of water. Pond, whence shee derives her head, And places by the way, by which shee's honored (Old Winchester, that stands neere in her middle way, And Hampton, at her fall into the Solent Sea) Shee thinks in all the Ile not any such as shee, And for a Demy-god she would related bee. Sweet sister mine (quoth Test) advise you what you doe; Thinke this; For each of us, the Forests heere are two: Who, if you speake a thing whereof they hold can take, Bee't little, or bee't much, they double will it make: Whom Hamble helpeth out; a handsome proper flood, In curtesie well skild, and one that knew her good. Consider, quoth this Nymph, the times be curious now, And nothing of that kind will any way allow. Besides, the Muse hath, next, the British cause in hand, About things later done that now shee cannot stand. The more they her perswade, the more shee doth persist; Let them say what they will, shee will doe what shee list. Shee stiles her selfe their Chiefe, and sweares shee will command; And, what-so-ere shee saith, for Oracles must stand. Which when the Rivers heard, they further speech forbare. And shee (to please her selfe that onely seem'd to care) To sing th'atchievement great of Bevis thus began; Redoubted Knight (quoth shee) ô most renowned man! Who, when thou wert but young, thy Mother durst reprove (Most wickedly seduc't by the unlawfull love Of Mordure, at that time the Almain Emperors sonne) That shee thy Sire to death disloyally had done: Each circumstance whereof shee largelie did relate; Then, in her song pursu'd his Mothers deadlie hate; And how (by Sabers hand) when shee suppos'd him dead, Where long upon the Downes a Shepheards life hee led; Till by the great recourse, he came at length to knowe The Country there-about could hardly hold the showe His Mothers mariage feast to faire South-hampton drue, Be'ing wedded to that Lord who late her husband slue: Into his noble breast which pierc't so wondrous deepe, That (in the poore attire he us'd to tend the sheepe, And in his hand his hooke) unto the Towne hee went; As having in his heart a resolute intent Or manfullie to die, or to revenge his wrong: Where pressing at the gate the multitude among, The Porter to that place his entrance that forbad (Supposing him some swaine, some boystrous Country-lad) Upon the head hee lent so violent a stroke, That the poore emptie skull, like some thin potsheard broke, The braines and mingled blood, were spertled on the wall. Then hasting on he came into the upper Hall, Where murderous Mordure sate imbraced by his Bride: Who (guiltie in himselfe) had hee not Bevis spide, His boanes had with a blowe been shattred: but, by chance (He shifting from the place, whilst Bevis did advance His hand, with greater strength his deadly foe to hit, And missing him) his chaire hee all to shivers split: Which strooke his Mothers breast with strange and sundry feares, That Bevis beeing then but of so tender yeares Durst yet attempt a thing so full of death and doubt. And, once before deceiv'd, shee newlie cast about To rid him out of sight; and, with a mighty wage, Wonne such, themselves by oath as deeplie durst ingage, To execute her will: who shipping him away (And making forth their course into the Mid-land sea) As they had got before, so now againe for gold To an Armenian there that young Alcides sold: Of all his gotten prize, who (as the worthiest thing, And fittest where-withall to gratifie his King) Presented that brave youth; the splendor of whose eye A wondrous mixture shew'd of grace and majestie: Whose more then man-like shape, and matchlesse stature, tooke The King; that often us'd with great delight to looke Upon that English Earle. But though the love he bore To Bevis might be much, his daughter tenne times more Admir'd the god-like man: who, from the howre that first His beautie shee beheld, felt her soft bosome pierst With Cupids deadliest shaft; that Josian, to her guest, Alreadie had resign'd possession of her breast. Then sang shee, in the fields how as hee went to sport, And those damn'd Panims heard, who in despightfull sort Derided Christ the Lord; for his Redeemers sake He on those heathen hounds did there such slaughter make, That whilst in their black mouthes their blasphemies they drue, They headlong went to hell. As also how hee slue That cruell Boare, whose tusks turn'd up whole fields of graine (And, wrooting, raised hills upon the levell Plaine; Digd Caverns in the earth, so darke and wondrous deepe As that, into whose mouth the desperate Curtius, that for his countries sake so lavished his life. Roman leepe): And cutting off his head, a Trophy thence to beare; The Forresters that came to intercept it there, How he their scalps and trunks in chips and peeces cleft, And in the fields (like beasts) their mangled bodies left. As to his further praise, how for that dangerous fight The great Armenian King made noble Bevis Knight: And having raised power, Damascus to invade, The Generall of his force this English Heroë made. Then, how faire Josian gave him Arundell his steed, And Morglay his good sword, in many a valiant deed Which manfully he tri'd. Next, in a Loftie. Buskind straine, Sung how himselfe he bore upon Damascus Plaine (That dreadful battell) where, with Bradamond he fought; And with his sword and steed such earthlie wonders wrought, As even amongst his foes him admiration won; Incountring in the throng with mightie Radison; And lopping off his armes, th'imperiall standard tooke. At whose prodigious fall, the conquered Foe forsooke The Field; where, in one day so many Peeres they lost, So brave Commaunders, and so absolute an host, As to the humbled earth tooke proud Damascus downe, Then tributarie made to the Armenian Crowne. And how at his returne, the King (for service done, The honor to his raigne, and to Armenia won) In mariage to this Earle the Princess Josian gave; As into what distresse him Fortune after drave, To great Damascus sent Ambassador againe; When, in revenge of theirs, before by Bevis slaine (And now, at his returne, for that he so despis'd Those Idols unto whom they dailie sacrifiz'd: Which he to peeces hew'd and scattred in the dust) They, rising, him by strength into a Dungeon thrust; In whose blacke bottom, long two Serpents had remain'd (Bred in the common sewre that all the Cittie drain'd) Empoysning with their smell; which seiz'd him for their pray: With whom in strugling long (besmeard with blood and clay) He rent their squallid chaps, and from the prison scap't. As how adultrous Joure, the King of Mambrant, rap't Faire Josian his deere Love, his noble sword and steed: Which afterward by craft, he in a Palmers weed Recoverd, and with him from Mambrant bare away. And with two Lions how hee held a desperat fray, Assayling him at once, that fiercelie on him flew: Which first he tam'd with wounds, then by the necks them drew, And gainst the hardned earth their jawes and shoulders burst; And that (Golia-like) great Ascupart inforc't To serve him for a slave, and by his horse to runne. At Colein as againe the glorie that he wonne On that huge Dragon, like the Country to destroy; Whose sting strooke like a Lance: whose venom did destroy As doth a generall plague: his scales like shields of brass; His bodie, when hee moov'd, like some unweeldie mass, Even brus'd the solid Earth. Which boldlie having song, With all the sundry turnes that might thereto belong, Whilst yet shee shapes her course how he came back to show What powers he got abroad, how them he did bestow; In England heere againe, how he by dint of sword Unto his ancient lands and titles was restor'd, New-forrest cry'd enough: and Waltham with the Bere, Both bad her hold her peace; for they no more would heare. And for shee was a flood, her fellowes nought would say; But slipping to their banks, slid silentlie away. When as the pliant Muse, with faire and even flight, Betwixt her silver wings is wafted to the Ile of Wight. Wight: That Ile, which jutting out into the Sea so farre, Her ofspring traineth up in exercise of warre; Those Pyrats to put backe that oft purloine her trade, Or Spaniards, or the French attempting to invade. Of all the Southerne Iles shee holds the highest place, And evermore hath been the great'st in Britaines grace: Not one of all her Nymphs her Soveraigne favoureth thus, Imbraced in the armes of old Oceanus. For none of her account, so neere her bosome stand, Twixt The Forelands of Cornwall and Kent. Penwiths furthest point, and The Forelands of Cornwall and Kent. Goodwins queachy sand, Both for her seat and soyle, that farre before the other, Most justlie may account great Britaine for her Mother. A finer fleece then hers not Lemsters selfe can boast, Nor Newport for her Mart, o'r-matcht by any Coast. To these, the gentle South, with kisses smooth and soft, Doth in her bosome breathe, and seemes to court her oft. Besides, her little Rills, her in-lands that doe feed, Which with their lavish streames doe furnish everie need: And Meads, that with their fine soft grassie towels stand To wipe away the drops and moisture from her hand. And to the North, betwixt the fore-land and the firme, Shee hath that narrow Sea, which we the Solent tearme: The Solent. Where those rough irefull Tides, as in her Straits they meet, With boystrous shocks and rores each other rudely greet: Which fiercelie when they charge, and sadlie make retreat, Upon the bulwarkt Forts of Two Castles in the Sea. Hurst and Calsheot beat, Then to South-hampton runne: which by her shores supplide (As Portsmouth by her strength) doth vilifie their pride; Portsmouth. Both, Roads that with our best may boldlie hold their plea, Nor Plimmouths selfe hath borne more braver ships then they; That from their anchoring Bayes have travailed to finde Large Chinas wealthie Realms, and view'd the either Inde, The pearlie rich Peru; and with as prosperous fate, Have borne their ful-spred sailes upon the streames of Plate: Whose pleasant harbors oft the Sea-mans hope renue, To rigge his late-craz'd Barke, to spred a wanton clue; Where they with lustie Sack, and mirthfull Sailers songs, Defie their passed stormes, and laugh at Neptunes wrongs: The danger quite forgot wherein they were of late; Who halfe so merrie now as Maister and his Mate? And victualling againe, with brave and man-like minds To Sea-ward cast their eyes, and pray for happie winds. But, partlie by the floods sent thither from the shore, And Ilands that are set the bordring coast before: As one amongst the rest, a brave and lustie Dame Call'd Portsey, whence that Bay of Portsmouth hath her name: By her, two little Iles, her handmaids (which compar'd With those within the Poole, for deftness not out-dar'd) The greater Haling hight: and fairest though by much, Yet Thorney verie well, but some-what rough in tuch. Whose beauties farre and neere divulged by report, And by the Neptunes Trumpeters. Trytons told in mightie Neptunes Court, Old Proteus, a Sea-god, changing himselfe into any shape. Proteus hath been knowne to leave his finny Heard, And in their sight to spunge his foame-bespawled beard. The Sea-gods, which about the watry kingdome keepe, Have often for their sakes abandoned the Deepe; That Thetis many a time to Neptune hath complaind, How for those wanton Nymphes her Ladies were disdain'd: And there arose such rut th'unrulie rout among, That soone the noyse thereof through all the Ocean rong. When Portsey, weighing well the ill to her might grow, In that their mightie stirres might be her over-throw, Shee stronglie straightneth-in the entrance to her Bay; A poëticall description of the Solent Sea.That, of their haunt debard, and shut out to the Sea (Each small conceived wrong helps on distempred rage.) No counsell could be heard their choler to aswage: When every one suspects the next that is in place To be the onely cause and meanes of his disgrace. Some comming from the East, some from the setting Sunne, The liquid Mountaines still together mainlie runne; Wave woundeth wave againe; and billow, billow gores: And topsie turvie so, flie tumbling to the shores. From hence the Solent Sea, as some men thought, might stand Amongst those things, which wee call Wonders of our Land. When toghing up Tichfield River. that streame, so negligent of fame, As till this verie day shee yet conceales her name; By Bert and Waltham both, that's equally imbrac't, And lastlie, at her fall, by Tichfield highlie grac't. Whence, from old Windsor hill, and from the aged Another little hill in Hampshire. Stone, The Muse those Countries sees, which call her to be gone. The Forests tooke their leave: Bere, Chute, and Buckholt, bid Adieu; so Wolmer, and so Ashholt, kindly did. And Pamber shooke her head, as grieved at the hart; When farre upon her way, and ready to depart, As now the wandring Muse so sadlie went along, To her last Farewell, thus, the goodlie Forests song. Deere Muse, to plead our right, whom time at last hath brought, Which else forlorne had lyen, and banisht everie thought, When thou ascend'st the hills, and from their rising shrouds Our sisters shalt commaund, whose tops once toucht the clouds; Old The great &amp; ancient forest of Warwickshire. Arden when thou meet'st, or doost faire The goodly forest by Notingham. Sherwood see, Tell them, that as they waste, so everie day doe wee: Wish them, we of our griefes may be each others heirs; Let them lament our fall, and we will mourne for theirs. Then turning from the South which lies in publique view, The Muse an oblique course doth seriously pursue: And pointing to the Plaines, she thither takes her way; For which, to gaine her breath shee makes a little stay. The third Song. The Argument. In this third Song, great threatnings are, And tending all to Nymphish warre. Old Wansdike uttereth words of hate, Depraving Stonendges estate. Cleere Avon and faire Willy strive, Each pleading her prerogative. The Plaine the Forrests doth disdaine: The Forrests raile upon the Plaine. The Muse then seekes the Shires extreames, To find the Fountaine of great Tames; Falls downe with Avon, and discries Both Bathes and Bristowes braveries: Then viewes the Sommersetian soyle; Through Marshes, Mines, and Mores doth toyle, To Avalon to Arthurs Grave, Sadlie bemoan'd of Ochy Cave. Then with delight shee bravelie brings The Princely Parret from her Springs: Preparing for the learned Plea (The next Song) in the Severne Sea. Up with the jocund Larke (Too long we take our rest.) Whilst yet the blushing Dawne out of the cheerfull East Is ushering forth the Day to light the Muse along: Whose most delightfull touch, and sweetness of her Song, Shall force the lustie Swaines out of the Country-townes, To lead the loving Girles in daunces to the Downes. The Nymphs, in Selwoods shades and Bradens woods that bee, Their Oaken wreathes, ô Muse, shall offer up to thee. And when thou shap'st thy course tow'rds where the soile is rank, The Sommersetian mayds, by swelling Sabryns bank Shall strewe the waies with flowers (where thou art comming on) Brought from the Marshie-grounds by aged Glastenburie. Avalon. From Sarum thus we set, remov'd from whence it stood By Avon to reside, her deerest loved Flood: Where her imperious The goodly Church at Salisburie. Fane her former seate disdaines, And proudly over-tops the spacious neighboring Plaines. What pleasures hath this Ile, of us esteem'd most deere, In any place, but poore unto the plentie heere? The chaulkie Two places famous for Hares, the one in Buckinghamshire, the other in North-hamptonshire. Chiltern fields, nor Kelmarsh selfe compares With Everley warren of Hares. Everley for store and swiftnes of her Hares: A horse of greater speed, nor yet a righter hound, Not any where twixt Kent and The furthest part of Scotland. Calidon is found. Nor yet the levell South can shewe a smoother Race, Whereas the Gant. ballow Nag out-strips the winds in chase; As famous in the West for matches yeerelie tride, As A famous Yorkeshire horsrace. Garterley, possest of all the Northern pride: And on his match, as much the Western horseman layes, As the rank-riding Scots upon their The best kind of Scotish nags. Gallowayes. And as the Westerne soyle as sound a Horse doth breed, As doth the land that lies betwixt the Trent and Tweed: No Hunter, so, but finds the breeding of the West, The onely kind of Hounds, for mouth and nostrill best; The Western hounds generally the best. That cold doth sildome fret, nor heat doth over-haile; As standing in the Flight, as pleasant on the Traile; Free hunting, easely checkt, and loving every Chase; Straight running, hard, and tough, of reasonable pase: Not heavie, as that hound which Lancashire doth breed; Nor as the Northerne kind, so light and hot of speed, Upon the cleerer Chase, or on the foyled Traine, Doth make the sweetest cry, in Wood-land, or on Plaine. Where she, of all the Plaines of Britaine, that doth beare The name to be the first (renowned everie where) Hath worthily obtaind that Stonendge there should stand: Shee, first of Plaines; and Stonendge the greatest Wonder of England. that, first Wonder of the Land. Shee Wansdike also winnes, by whom shee is imbrac't, That in his aged armes doth gird her ampler wast: Who (for a mightie Mound sith long he did remaine Betwixt the Mercians rule, and the West-Saxons raigne, And therefore of his place him selfe hee proudly bare) Had very oft beene heard with Stonendge to compare; Whom for a paltry Ditch, when Stonendge pleasd t'upbraid, The old man taking heart, thus to that Trophy said; Dull heape, that thus thy head above the rest doost reare, Precisely yet not know'st who first did place thee there; But Traytor basely turn'd to Merlins skill doost flie, And with his Magiques doost thy Makers truth belie: Conspirator with Time, now growen so meane and poore, Comparing these his spirits with those that went before; Yet rather art content thy Builders praise to lose, Then passed greatnes should thy present wants disclose. Ill did those mightie men to trust thee with their storie, That hast forgot their names, who rear'd thee for their glorie: For all their wondrous cost, thou that hast serv'd them so, What tis to trust to Tombes, by thee we easely know. In these invectives thus whilst Wansdick doth complaine, He interrupted is by that imperious Salisbury-Plaine. Plaine, To heare two crystall Floods to court her, that apply Themselves, which should be seene most gracious in her eye. First, Willy boasts her selfe more worthy then the other, And better farre deriv'd: as having to her mother Faire A Forest betwixt Wiltshire and Sommersetshire. Selwood, and to bring up Of diving under the earth. Diver in her traine; Which, when the envious soile would from her course restraine, A mile creeps under earth, as flying all resort: And how cleere Nader waits attendance in her Court; And therefore claimes of right the Plaine should hold her deere, Wilton of Willie, and Wiltshire of Wilton.Which gives that Towne the name; which likewise names the Shire. The Easterne Avon vaunts, and doth upon her take To be the onelie child of shadefull A Forest in Wiltshire, as the Map will tell you. Savernake, As Ambrayes ancient flood; her selfe and to enstile The Stonendges best-lov'd, first wonder of the Ile; And what (in her behoofe) might any want supply, Shee vaunts the goodlie seat of famous Salsburie; Where meeting prettie Bourne, with many a kind embrace, Betwixt their crystall armes they clip that loved place. Report, as lately rais'd, unto these Rivers came, That Bathes cleere Avon (waxt imperious through her fame) Their daliance should deride; and that by her disdaine, Some other smaller Brooks, belonging to the Plaine, A question seem'd to make, whereas the Shire sent forth Two Avons, which should be the flood of greatest worth; This streame, which to the South the The French Sea, as you have in the note before. Celtick Sea doth get, Or that which from the North saluteth Somerset. This when these Rivers heard, that even but lately strove Which best did love the Plaine, or had the Plaines best love, They straight themselves combine: for Willy wiselie waide, That should her Avon lose the day for want of aide, If one so great and neere were overprest with power, The Foe (shee beeing lesse) would quicklie her devour. As two contentious Kings, that on each little jarre, Defiances send forth, proclaiming open warre, Untill some other Realme, that on their frontires lies, Be hazarded againe by other enemies, Doe then betwixt themselves to composition fall, To countercheck that sword, else like to conquer all: So falls it with these Floods, that deadlie hate doe beare. And whilst on either part strong preparations were, It greatly was suppos'd strange strife would there have been, Had not the goodly Plaine (plac't equally betweene) Fore-warn'd them to desist, and off their purpose brake: When in behalfe of Plaines thus (gloriously) she spake; The Plaine of Salisburies speech in defence of all Plaines.Away yee barb'rous Woods; How ever yee be plac't On Mountaines, or in Dales, or happily be grac't With floods, or marshie Boggy places. A word frequent in Lancashire. fels, with pasture, or with earth By nature made to till, that by the yeerely birth The large-bay'd Barne doth fill, yea though the fruitfulst ground. For, in respect of Plaines, what pleasure can be found In darke and sleepie shades? where mists and rotten fogs Hang in the gloomie thicks, and make unstedfast bogs, By dropping from the boughs, the o're-growen trees among, With Caterpillers kells, and duskie cobwebs hong. The deadlie Screech-owle sits, in gloomie covert hid: Whereas the smooth-brow'd Plaine, as liberallie doth bid The Larke to leave her Bowre, and on her trembling wing In climing up tow'rds heaven, her high-pitcht Hymnes to sing Unto the springing Day; when gainst the Sunnes arise The earlie Dawning strewes the goodly Easterne skies With Roses every where: who scarcelie lifts his head To view this upper world, but hee his beames doth spred Upon the goodlie Plaines; yet at his Noonesteds hight, Doth scarcelie pierce the Brake with his farre-shooting sight. The gentle Shepheards heer survay their gentler sheepe: Amongst the bushie woods luxurious Satyrs keepe. To these brave sports of field, who with desire is wonne, To see his Grey-hound course, his Horse (in diet) runne, His deepe mouth'd Hound to hunt, his long-wingd Haulk to flie, To these most noble sports his mind who doth apply, Resorts unto the Plaines. And not a foughten Field, Where Kingdoms rights have laine upon the speare and shield, But Plaines have beene the place; and all those Trophies hie That ancient times have rear'd to noble memorie: As, Stonendge, that to tell the British Princes slaine By those false Saxons fraud, here ever shall remaine. It was upon the Plaine of Mamre (to the fame Of mee and all our kind) whereas the Angels came To Abraham in his Tent, and there with him did feed; To Sara his deere wife then promising the seed By whom all Nations should so highly honor'd bee, In which the Sonne of God they in the flesh should see. But Forests, to your plague there soone will come an Age, In which all damned sinnes most vehemently shall rage. An Age! what have I said! nay, Ages there shall rise, So senselesse of the good of their posterities, That of your greatest Groves they scarce shall leave a tree (By which the harmelesse Deere may after sheltred bee) Their luxurie and pride but onely to maintaine, And for your long excesse shall turne ye all to paine. Thus ending; though some hils themselves that doe applie To please the goodly Plaine, still standing in her eie, Divers hills neere &amp; about Salisbury Plaine.Did much applaud her speech (as Haradon, whose head Old Ambry still doth awe, and Bagden from his sted, Survaying of the Vies, whose likings do allure Both Ouldbry and Saint Anne; and they againe procure Mount Marting-sall: and he those hils that stand aloofe, Those brothers Barbury, and Badbury, whose proofe Addes much unto her praise) yet in most high disdaine, The Forrests take her words, and sweare the prating Plaine Growne old began to doate: and Savernake so much Is galled with her taunts (whom they so nearely touch) That she in spitefull tearmes defies her to her face; And Aldburne with the rest, though being but a Chase, At worse then nought her sets: but Bradon all afloate When it was tolde to her, set open such a throate, That all the countrey rang. She cals her barren Jade, Base Queane, and riv'ld Witch, and wisht she could be made But worthy of her hate (which most of all her grieves) The basest beggers Baude, a harborer of theeves. Then Peusham, and with her old Blackmore (not behinde) Do wish that from the Seas some soultrie Southerne winde, The foule infectious damps, and poisned aires would sweepe, And poure them on the Plaine, to rot her and her Sheepe. But whilst the sportive Muse delights her with these things, She strangely taken is with those delicious Springs Of Kenet rising here, and of the nobler Streame Of Isis setting forth upon her way to Tame, By Greeklade; whose great name yet vaunts that learned tong, Where to great Britaine first the sacred Muses song; Which first were seated here, at Isis bountious head, As telling that her fame should through the world be spread; And tempted by this flood, to Oxford after came, There likewise to delight her bridegroome, lovely Tame: Whose beautie when they saw, so much they did adore, That Greeklade they forsooke, and would goe backe no more. Then Bradon gently brings forth Avon from her source: Which Southward making soone in her most quiet course, Receives the gentle Calne: when on her rising side, First Blackmoore crownes her banke, as Peusham with her pride Sets out her murmuring sholes, till (turning to the West) Her, Somerset receives, with all the bounties blest That Nature can produce in that Bathonian Spring, Which from the Sulphury Mines her med'cinall force doth bring; As Physick hath found out by colour, taste, and smell, Which taught the world at first the vertue of that Well; What quickliest it could cure: which men of knowledge drew From that first minerall cause: but some that little knew (Yet felt the great effects continually it wrought) Ascrib'd it to that skill, which Bladud hither brought, As by that learned King the Bathes should be begunne; Not from the quickned Mine, by the begetting Sunne Giving that naturall power, which by the vig'rous sweate, Doth lend the lively Springs their perdurable heate In passing through the veines, where matter doth not need; Which in that minerous earth insep'rably doth breed: So nature hath purvai'd, that during all her raigne The Bathes their native power for ever shall retaine: Where Time that Citie built, which to her greater fame, Preserving of that Spring, participates her name; The Tutilage whereof (as those past worlds did please) Minerva and Hercules, the protectors of these fountains.Some to Minerva gave, and some to Hercules: Proud Phœbus loved Spring, in whose Diurnall course, When on this point of earth he bends his greatest force, By his so strong approach, provokes her to desire; Stung with the kindly rage of loves impatient fire: Which boiling in her wombe, projects (as to a birth) Such matter as she takes from the grosse humorous earth; Till purg'd of dregs and slime, and her complexion cleere, She smileth on the light, and lookes with mirthfull cheere. Then came the lustie Froome, the first of floods that met Faire Avon entring in to fruitfull Somerset, With her attending Brooks; and her to Bathe doth bring, Much honoured by that place, Minerva's sacred Spring. To noble Avon, next, cleere Chute as kindly came, The delicacies of Bristow.To Bristow her to beare, the fairest seat of Fame: To entertaine this flood, as great a mind that hath, And striving in that kind farre to excell the Bath. As when some wealthy Lord, prepares to entertaine A man of high account, and feast his gallant traine; Of him that did the like, doth seriously enquire His diet, his device, his service, his attire; That varying every thing (exampled by his store) He everie way may passe what th'other did before: Even so this Citie doth; the prospect of which place To her faire building addes an admirable grace; Well fashioned as the best, and with a double wall, As brave as any Towne; but yet excelling all For easement, that to health is requisit and meete; Her piled shores, to keepe her delicate and sweete: Hereto, she hath her Tides; that when she is opprest With heat or drought, still poure their floods upon her breast. To Mendip then the Muse upon the South inclines, Which is the onely store, and Coffer of her Mines: Elsewhere the Fields and Meades their sundry traffiques suit: The Forrests yeeld her wood, the Orchards give her fruit. As in some rich mans house his severall charges lie, There stands his Wardrobe, here remaines his Treasurie; His large provision there, of Fish, of Fowl, and Neat; His Cellars for his Wines, his Larders for his meate; There Banquet houses, Walkes for pleasure; here againe Cribs, Graners, Stables, Barnes, the other to maintaine: So this rich countrey hath, it selfe what may suffice; Or that which through exchange a smaller want supplies: Yet Ochyes dreadfull Hole still held her selfe disgrac't, With A catalog of many wonders of this Land. th'wonders of this Ile that she should not be plac't: But that which vext her most, was, that the The Divels arse. Peakish Cave Before her darkesome selfe such dignitie should have; And The Salt Wels in Chesshire. th'Wyches for their Salts such state on them should take; Or Cheshire should preferre her sad Bruertons pond. Death-boding-lake; And Stonendge in the world should get so high respect, Which imitating Arte but idly did erect: And that amongst the rest, the vaine inconstant A river by Westchester. Dee, By changing of his Foards, for one should reckond bee; As of another sort, wood turn'd to By sundry soiles of Britaine. stone; among, Th'anatomized Our Pikes, ript and sow'd up, live. Fish, and Fowles from Barnacles a bird breeding upon old ships. planchers sprong: And on the Cambrian side those strange and wondrous Wondrous Springs in Wales. Springs, Our Sheepe. beasts that seldome drinke; a thousand other things Which Ochy inly vext, that they to fame should mount, And greatly griev'd her friends for her so small account; That there was scarcely Rock, or River, Marsh, or Meare That held not Ochyes wrongs (for all held Ochy deare) In great and high disdaine: and Froome for her disgrace Since scarcely ever washt the Colesleck from her face; But (melancholy growne) to Avon gets a path, Through sickeness forc't to seeke for cure unto the Bath: And Chedder for meere griefe his teene he could not wreake, Gusht forth so forcefull streames, that he was like to breake The greater bankes of Ax, as from his mothers Cave, He wandred towards the Sea; for madnesse who doth rave At his drad mothers wrong: but who so wo begon For Ochy, as the Ile of ancient Avalon? Who having in her selfe, as inward cause of griefe, Neglecteth yet her owne, to give her friend reliefe. The other so againe for her doth sorrow make, And in the Iles behalfe the dreadfull Caverne spake; O three times famous Ile, where is that place that might Be with thy selfe compar'd for glorie and delight, Whilst Glastenbury stood? exalted to that pride, Whose Monasterie seem'd all other to deride? O who thy ruine sees, whom wonder doth not fill With our great fathers pompe, devotion, and their skill? Thou more then mortall power (this judgement rightly wai'd) Then present to assist, at that foundation lai'd; On whom for this sad waste, should Justice lay the crime? Is there a power in Fate, or doth it yeeld to Time? Or was their error such, that thou could'st not protect Those buildings which thy hand did with their zeale erect? To whom didst thou commit that monument, to keepe, That suffreth with the dead their memory to sleepe? When not great Arthurs Tombe, nor holy Joseph of Arimathea. Josephs Grave, From sacriledge had power their sacred bones to save; He who that God in man to his sepulchre brought, Or he which for the faith twelve famous battels fought. What? Did so many Kings do honor to that place, For Avarice at last so vilely to deface? For rev'rence, to that seat which hath ascribed beene, The wondrous tree at Glastenbury.Trees yet in winter bloome, and beare their Summers greene. This said, she many a sigh from her full stomacke cast, Which issued through her breast in many a boystrous blast; And with such floods of teares her sorrowes doth condole, As into rivers turne within that darkesome hole: Like sorrow for her selfe, this goodly Ile doth trie; Imbrac't by Selwoods sonne, her flood the lovely Bry, On whom the Fates bestow'd (when he conceived was) He should be much belov'd of many a daintie Lasse; Who gives all leave to like, yet of them liketh none: But his affection sets on beautious Avalon; Fruitful Moors on the bankes of Bry.Though many a plump-thigh'd moore, &amp; ful-flanck't marsh do prove To force his chaste desires, so dainty of his love. First Sedgemore shewes this floud, her bosome all unbrac't, And casts her wanton armes about his slender wast: Her lover to obtaine, so amorous Audry seekes: And Gedney softly steales sweet kisses from his cheekes. One takes him by the hand, intreating him to stay: Another pluckes him backe, when he would faine away: But, having caught at length, whom long he did pursue, Is so intranc't with love, her goodly parts to view, That altring quite his shape, to her he doth appeare, And casts his crystall selfe into an ample Meare: But for his greater growth when needs he must depart, And forc't to leave his Love (though with a heavie hart) As hee his back doth turne, and is departing out, The batning marshie Brent environs him about: But lothing her imbrace, away in haste he flings, And in the Severne Sea surrounds his plentious Springs. But, dallying in this place so long why doost thou dwell, So many sundry things here having yet to tell? Occasion calls the Muse her pynions to prepare. Which (striking with the wind the vast and open aire) Now, in the finnie Heaths, then in the Champains roves; Now, measures out this Plaine; and then survayes those groves; The batfull pastures fenc't, and most with quickset mound, The sundry sorts of soyle, diversitie of ground; Where Plow-men cleanse the Earth of rubbish, weed, and filth, And give the fallow lands their seasons and their tylth: Where, best for breeding horse; where cattell fitst to keepe; Which good for bearing Corne; which pasturing for sheepe: The leane and hungry earth, the fat and marly mold, Where sands be alwaies hot, and where the clayes be cold; With plentie where they waste, some others toucht with want: Heere set, and there they sowe; here proine, and there they plant. As Wiltshire is a place best pleas'd with that resort Which spend away the time continuallie in sport; So Somerset, her selfe to profit doth apply, As given all to gaine, and thriving huswifrie. For, whereas in a Land one doth consume and wast, Tis fit another be to gather in as fast: This liketh moorie plots, delights in sedgie Bowres, The grassy garlands loves, and oft attyr'd with flowres Of ranke and mellow gleabe; a sward as soft as wooll, With her complexion strong, a belly plumpe and full. Thus whilst the active Muse straines out these various things, Cleere Parret makes approach, with all those plentious Springs Her fruitful banks that blesse; by whose Monarchall sway, Shee fortifies her selfe against that mightie day Wherein her utmost power she should be forc't to try. For, from the Druides time there was a prophecie, That there should come a day (which now was neere at hand By all forerunning signes) that on the Easterne Strand, If A supposed prophecie upon Parret. Parret stood not fast upon the English side, They all should be supprest: and by the British pride In cunning over-come; for why, impartiall Fate (Yet constant alwaies to the Britains crazed state) Forbad they yet should fall; by whom she meant to showe How much the present Age, and after-times should owe Unto the line of Brute. Cleere Parret therefore prest Her tributarie Streames, and whollie her addrest Against the ancient Foe: First, calling to her ayde Two Rivers of Ivel: from which, the town Ivel is denominated. one name; which seeme as though they stayd Their Empresse as she went, her either hand that take. The first upon the right, as from her source, doth make Large Muchelney an Ile, and unto Ivell lends Her hardlie-rendred name: That on her left, descends From Neroch's neighboring woods; which, of that Forest borne, Her rivalls proffered grace opprobriously doth scorne. Shee by her wandring course doth Athelney in-Ile: And for the greater state, her selfe she doth instile The nearest neighbouring flood to Arthurs ancient seat, Which made the Britaines name through all the world so great. Like Camelot, what place, was ever yet renownd? Where, as at Carlion, oft, hee kept the Table-round, Most famous for the sports at Pentecost so long, From whence all Knightlie deeds, and brave atchievements sprong. As some soft-sliding Rill, which from a lesser head (Yet in his going forth, by many a Fountaine fed) Extends it selfe at length unto a goodly streame: So, almost through the world his fame flew from this Realme; That justlie I may charge those ancient Bards of wrong, So idly to neglect his glorie in their Song. For some aboundant braine, ô there had been a storie Beyond the Homer. Blind-mans might to have inhanc't our glorie. Tow'rds the Sabrinian Sea then Parret setting on, To her attendance next comes in the beautious Tone, Crown'd with embroidred banks, and gorgeously arraid With all th'enamild flowers of manie a goodly Mead: In Orchards richly clad; whose proud aspyring boughes Even of the tallest woods doe scorne a jote to loose, Though Selwoods mighty selfe and Neroch standing by: The sweetnes of her soyle through every Coast doth fly. What eare so empty is, that hath not heard the sound Of Tauntons fruitfull One of the fruitfull places of this Land. Deane? not matcht by any ground; By Interpreted the noble Ile. Athelney ador'd, a neighbourer to her Land: Whereas those higher hills to view faire Tone that stand, Her coadjuting Springs with much content behold: Where Sea-ward Quantock stands as Neptune he controld, And Blackdown In-land borne, a Mountain and a Mound, As though he stood to look about the Country round: But Parret as a Prince, attended heere the while, Inricht with every Moore, and every In-land Ile, Upon her taketh State, well forward tow'rds her fall: Whom lastly yet to grace, and not the least of all, Comes in the lively Carre, a Nymph, most lovely cleere, From Somerton sent downe the Soveraigne of the Sheere; Which makes our Parret proude. And wallowing in excesse, Whilst like a Prince she vaunts amid the watry presse, The breathlesse Muse awhile her wearied wings shall ease, To get her strength to stem the rough Sabrinian Seas. The fourth Song. The Argument. England and Wales strive, in this Song, To wether, Lundy doth belong: When eithers Nymphs, to cleere the doubt, By Musick meane her to try it out. Of mightie Neptune leave they aske: Each one betakes her to her taske; The Britaines, with the Harpe and Crowd: The English, both with still and loud. The Britaines thaunt King Arthurs glory: The English sing their Saxons storie. The Hills of Wales their weapons take, And are an uprore like to make, To keepe the English part in awe. There's heave, and shove, and hold, and draw; The Severne can them scarce divide, Till Judgment may the Cause decide. This while in Sabrin's Court strong factions strangley grew, Since Cornwall for her owne, and as her proper due, Claim'd Lundy, which was said to Cambria to belong, Who oft had sought redresse for that her ancient wrong: But her inveterate Foe, borne-out by Englands might, O're-swaies her weaker power; that (now in eithers right) As Severne finds no Flood so great, nor poorelie meane, But that the naturall Spring (her force which doth maintaine) From England or Wales.From this or that shee takes; so from this Faction free (Begun about this Ile) not one was like to bee. This Lundy is a Nymph to idle toyes inclin'd; And, all on pleasure set, doth whollie give her mind To see upon her shores her Fowle and Conies fed, And wantonlie to hatch the Birds of Ganimed. Of trafique or returne shee never taketh care: Not provident of pelfe, as many Ilands are: A lustie black-brow'd Girle, with forehead broad and hie, That often had bewitcht the Sea-gods with her eye. Of all the In-laid Iles her Soveraigne Severne keepes, That bathe their amorous breasts within her secret Deepes (To love her Certaine little Iles lying within Severne. Barry much and Silly though shee seeme, The Flat Holme and the Steepe as likewise to esteeme) This noblest British Severne. Nymph yet likes her Lundy best, And to great Neptunes grace preferres before the rest. Thus, Wales. Cambria to her right that would her selfe restore, And rather then to lose England. Loëgria, lookes for more; The Nymphs of either part, whom passion doth invade, To triall straight will goe, though Neptune should disswade: But of the weaker sex, the most part full of spleene, And onely wanting strength to wreake their angry teene, For skill their challenge make, which everie one profest, And in the learned Arts (of knowledges the best, And to th'heroïck spirit most pleasing under skie) Sweet Musick, rightlie matcht with heavenlie Poësie, In which they all exceed: and in this kind alone They Conquerers vow to be, or lastlie overthrowne. Which when faire Sabrine saw (as shee is wondrous wise) And that it were in vaine them better to advise, Sith this contention sprang from Countries like alli'd, That shee would not be found t'incline to either side, To mightie Neptune sues to have his free consent Due triall they might make: When he incontinent His Trytons sendeth out the challenge to proclaime. No sooner that divulg'd in his so dreadfull name, But such a shout was sent from everie neighboring Spring, That the report was heard through all his Court to ring: And from the largest Streame unto the lesser Brooke, Them to this wondrous taske they seriouslie betooke: They curle their Ivory fronts; and not the smallest Beck But with white Pebles makes her Tawdries for her neck; Lay forth their amorous breasts unto the publique view, Enamiling the white, with veines that were as blew; Each Moore, each Marsh, each Mead, preparing rich array To set their Rivers forth against this generall day. Mongst Forrests, Hills, and Floods, was ne're such heave and shove Since Albion, Neptunes son, warred with Hercules. Albion weelded Armes against the sonne of Jove. When as the English part their courage to declare, Them to th'appointed place immediatly prepare. A troupe of stately Nymphs proud Avon with her brings (As shee that hath the charge of wise The Bathes. All these Rivers you may see in the third Song. Minervas Springs) From Mendip tripping downe, about the tinny Mine. And Ax, no lesse imploy'd about this great designe, Leads forth a lustie Rout; when Bry, with all her throng (With very madnes swolne that she had stai'd so long) Comes from the boggie Mears and queachy fens below: That Parret (highly pleas'd to see the gallant show) Set out with such a traine as bore so great a sway, The soyle but scarcely serves to give her hugenesse way. Then the Devonian Tawe, from Dertmore deckt with pearle, Unto the conflict comes: with her that gallant Girle Cleere Towridge, whom they fear'd would have estrang'd her fall: Whose comming, lastlie, bred such courage in them all, As drew downe many a Nymph from the Cornubian shore, That paint their goodlie breasts with sundrie sorts of Ore. The British, that this while had stood a view to take What to her utmost power the publique Foe could make, But slightlie weigh their strength: for, by her naturall kind, As still the Britan beares a brave and noble mind; So, trusting to their skill, and goodnes of their Cause, For speedie Triall call, and for indifferent Lawes. At length, by both allow'd, it to this issue grew; To make a likely choise of some most expert crew, Whose number comming neere unto the others dowre, The English should not urge they were o're-borne by powre. Yet hardlie upon Powse they dare their hopes to lay, For that shee hath commerce with England every day: Nor Rosse; for that too much shee Aliens doth respect; And following them, forgoes her ancient Dialect. The Floods of North-wales. Venedotian Floods, that ancient Britans were, The Mountaines kept them backe, and shut them in the Reare: But Brecknock, long time knowne a Country of much worth, Unto this conflict brings her goodly Fountaines forth: For almost not a Brooke of Glamorgan &amp; Monmouthshires. Morgany, nor Gwent, But from her fruitfull wombe doe fetch their hie descent. For Brecan, was a Prince once fortunate and great (Who dying, lent his name to that his nobler seat) With A supposed metamorphosis of Brecans daughters. twice twelve daughters blest, by one and onely wife: Who for their beauties rare, and sanctitie of life, To Rivers were transform'd; whose pureness doth declare How excellent they were, by beeing what they are: Who dying virgins all, and Rivers now by Fate, To tell their former love to the unmaried state, To Severne shape their course, which now their forme doth beare; Ere shee was made a flood, a virgine as they were. And from the Irish seas with feare they still doe flie: So much they yet delight in mayden companie. Then most renowned Wales, thou famous ancient place, Which still hast been the Nurse of all the British race, Since Nature thee denies that purple-cluster'd Vine, Which others Temples chafes with fragrant sparkling Wine; And being now in hand, to write thy glorious praise; Fill me a bowle of Meath, my working spirit to raise: And ere seven Bookes have end, I'le strike so high a string, Thy Bards shall stand amaz'd with wonder, whilst I sing; That Taliessen, once which made the Rivers dance, And in his rapture raiz'd the Mountaines from their trance, Shall tremble at my Verse, rebounding from the skies; Which like an earth-quake shakes the Tomb wherein he lies. First our triumphing Muse of sprightly Uske shall tell, And what to every Nymph attending her, befell: Which Cray and Camlas first for Pages doth reteane; With whom the next in place comes in the tripping Breane, With Isker; and with her comes Hodny fine and cleere, Of Brecknock best belov'd, the Soveraigne of the Sheere: And Grony, at an inch, waits on her Mistress heeles. But entring (at the last) the Monumethian fields, Small Fidan, with Cledaugh, increase her goodly Menie, Short Kebby, and the Brooke that christneth Abergeny. With all her watry traine, when now at last she came Unto that happie Towne which beares her Monmouth. onely name, Bright Birthin, with her friend faire Olwy, kindly meet her; Which for her present haste, have scarcely time to greet her: But earnest on her way, she needsly will be gone; So much she longs to see the ancient Carleon. When Avon commeth in, then which amongst them all A finer is not found betwixt her head and fall. Then Ebwith, and with her slides Srowy; which forelay Her progresse, and for Uske keepe entrance to the Sea. When Munno, all this while, that (for her owne behoofe) From this their great recourse had strangely stood aloofe, Made proude by Monmouths name appointed her by Fate, Of all the rest herein observed speciall state. For once the Bards foretold she should produce a Henry the fift, stiled of Monmouth. King, Which everlasting praise to her great name should bring, Who by his conquering sword should all the land surprise, Which twixt the A maritime hill in Caernarvan Shire. Penmenmaur and the Hils dividing Spaine and France. Pyreni lies: She therefore is allow'd her leasure; and by her They winne the goodly Wye, whome strongly she doth stirre Her powerfull helpe to lend: which else she had denide, Because her selfe so oft to England she allyed: But b'ing by Munno made for Wales, away she goes. Which when as Throggy sees, her selfe she headlong throwes Into the watry throng, with many another Rill, Repairing to the Welch, their number up to fill. That Remny when shee saw, these gallant Nymphs of Gwent, On this appointed match, were all so hotlie bent, Where shee of ancient time had parted, as a Mound The Monumethian fields, and Glamorganian ground, Intreats the Taffe along, as gray as any glasse: With whom cleere Cunno comes, a lustie Cambrian Lasse: Then Elwy, and with her Ewenny holds her way, And Ogmore, that would yet be there as soone as they, By Avon called in: when nimbler Neath anon (To all the neighbouring Nymphs for her rare beauties known; Besides her double head, to helpe her streame that hath Her handmaids, Melta sweet, cleere Hepsey, and Tragath) From Brecknock forth doth breake; then Dulas and Cledaugh, By Glamorgan. Morgany doe drive her through her watry A kind of Trench. saugh; With Tawy, taking part t'assist the Cambrian power: Then Lhu and Logor, given to strengthen them by Gower. Mongst whom, some Bards there were, that in their sacred rage Recorded the Descents, and acts of everie Age. Some with their nimbler joynts that strooke the warbling string; In fingering some unskild, but onelie us'd to sing Unto the others Harpe: of which you both might find Great plentie, and of both excelling in their kind, That at the Stethva oft obtain'd a Victors praise, Had wonne the Silver Harpe, and worne Apollos Bayes: Whose Verses they deduc't from those first golden times, Of sundry sorts of Feet, and sundry sutes of Rimes. In Englins, Cowiths, and Awdells, British formes of verses. See the Illustrations. Englins some there were that on their subject straine; Some Makers that againe affect the loftier vaine, Rehearse their high conceits in Cowiths: other-some In Owdells theirs expresse, as matter haps to come; So varying still their Moods, observing yet in all Their Quantities, their Rests, their Ceasures metricall: For to that sacred skill they most themselves apply; Addicted from their births so much to Poësie, That in the Mountaines those who scarce have seene a Booke, Most skilfully will A word, used by the Ancients, signifying to versify. make, as though from Art they tooke. And as Loëgria spares not any thing of worth That any way might set her goodly Rivers forth, As stones by nature cut from the Cornubian Strond; Her Dertmore sends them Pearle; Rock-vincent, Diamond: So Cambria, of her Nymphs especiall care will have. For Conwy sends them Pearle to make them wondrous brave; The sacred Saint Winifrids Well. Virgins-well, her mosse most sweet and rare, Against infectious damps for Pomander to weare: And A glistring Rock in Monmouthshire. Goldcliff of his Ore in plentious sort allowes, To spangle their attyers, and deck their amorous browes. And lastlie, holie Dee (whose pray'rs were highly priz'd, As one in heavenlie things devoutlie exercis'd: Who, See the eight Song. changing of his Foards, by divination had Fore-told the neighboring folke of fortune good or bad) In their intended course sith needs they will proceed, His Benediction sends in way of happy speed. And though there were such haste unto this long-lookt howre, Yet let they not to call upon th'Eternall Power. For, who will have his worke his wished end to winne, Let him with hartie prayer religiouslie beginne. Wherefore the English part, with full devout intent, In meet and godlie sort to Glastenbury sent, Beseeching of the Saints in Avalon that were, There offring at their Tombes for everie one a teare, And humblie to Saint George their Countries Patron pray, To prosper their designe now in this mightie day. The Britans, like devout, their Messengers direct To David, that he would their ancient right protect. Mongst Hatterills loftie hills, that with the clowds are crown'd, The Vally In Monmothshire. Ewias lies, immur'd so deep and round, As they belowe that see the Mountaines rise so hie, Might thinke the stragling Heards were grazing in the skie: Which in it such a shape of solitude doth beare, As Nature at the first appointed it for pray'r: Where, in an aged Cell, with mosse and Ivie growne, In which, not to this day the Sunne hath ever showne, That reverent British Saint in zealous Ages past, To contemplation liv'd; and did so trulie fast, As he did onelie drinke what crystall Hodney yeelds, And fed upon the Leeks he gather'd in the fields. In memorie of whom, in the revolving yeere The Welch-men on his day that sacred herbe doe weare: Where, of that holie man, as humblie they doe crave, That in their just defence they might his furtherance have. Thus either, well prepard the others power before, Convenientlie be'ing plac't upon their equall shore; The Britans, to whose lot the Onset doth belong, Give signall to the Foe for silence to their Song. To tell each various Straine and turning of their Rimes, How this in compasse falls, or that in sharpeness climes (As where they rest and rise, how take it one from one, As every severall Chord hath a peculiar Tone) Even Memorie her selfe, though striving, would come short: But the materiall things Muse helpe me to report. As first, t'affront the Foe, in th'ancient Britans right, With Arthur they begin, their most renowned Knight; The richness of the Armes their well-made Arthur, one of the nine Worthies. Worthie wore, The temper of his sword (the try'd Escalaboure) The bignes and the length of Rone, his noble Speare; With Pridwin his great Shield, and what the proofe could beare; His Baudrick how adorn'd with stones of wondrous price, The sacred Virgins shape he bore for his device; These monuments of worth, the ancient Britans song. Now, doubting least these things might hold them but too long, His warres they tooke to taske; the Land then over-layd With those proud German powers: when, calling to his ayde His kinsman Howell, brought from Britany the lesse, Their Armies they unite, both swearing to suppresse The Saxon, heer that sought through conquest all to gaine. On whom he chanc't to light at Lincolne: where the Plaine Each where from side to side lay scatter'd with the dead. And when the conquer'd Foe, that from the conflict fled, Betooke them to the woods, hee never left them there Untill the British earth he forc't them to forsweare. And as his actions rose, so raise they still their veine, In words, whose weight best sute a sublimated straine. They sung how he, him selfe at Badon bore that day, When at the glorious Gole his British Scepter lay: Two daies together how the battell stronglie stood: K. Arthur. Pendragons worthie sonne who waded there in blood, Three hundred Saxons slew with his owne valiant hand. And after (cald, the Pict, and Irish to withstand) How he, by force of Armes Albania over-ran, Pursuing of the Pict beyond Mount Calidon: There strongly shut them up whom stoutly he subdu'd. How Gillamore againe to Ireland he pursu'd So oft as he presum'd the envious Pict to ayde: And having slaine the King, the Country waste hee laid. To Goth-land how againe this Conqueror maketh-forth With his so prosp'rous powers into the farthest North: Where, Island first he wonne, and Orkney after got. To Norway sayling next with his deere Nephew Lot, By deadlie dint of sword did Ricoll there defeat: And having plac't the Prince on that Norwegian seat, How this courageous King did Denmarke then controle: That scarcelie there was found a Countrie to the Pole That dreaded not his deeds, too long that were to tell. And after these, in France th'adventures him befell At Paris, in the Lists, where he with Flollio fought; The Emperor Leons power to raise his Siege that brought. Then bravelie set they forth, in combat how these Knights On horseback and on foote perform'd their severall fights: As with what marvailous force each other they assaild, How mighty Flollio first, how Arthur then prevail'd; For best advantage how they traversed their grounds, The horrid blowes they lent, the world-amazing wounds, Untill the Tribune, tyr'd, sanke under Arthurs sword. Then sing they how hee first ordain'd the Circled-board, The Knights whose martiall deeds farre fam'd that Table-round; Which, truest in their loves; which, most in Armes renown'd: The Lawes, which long up-held that Order, they report; The Pentecosts prepar'd at Carleon in his Court, That Tables ancient seate; her Temples and her Groves, Her Palaces, her Walks, Baths, Theaters, and Stoves: Her Academie, then, as likewise they prefer: Of Camilot they sing, and then of Winchester. The feasts that under-ground the Faërie did him make, And there how he enjoyd the Lady of the Lake. Then told they, how him selfe great Arthur did advance, To meet (with his Allies) that puissant force in France, By Lucius thither led; those Armies that while-ere Affrighted all the world, by him strooke dead with feare: Th'report of his great Acts that over Europe ran, In that most famous Field he with the Emperor wan: As how great Rython's selfe hee slew in his repaire, Who ravisht Howells Neece, young Hellena the faire; And for a Trophy brought the Giants coat away Made of the beards of Kings. Then bravelie chanted they The severall twelve pitcht Fields he with the Saxons fought: The certaine day and place to memorie they brought; Then by false Mordreds hand how last hee chanc't to fall, The howre of his decease, his place of buriall. When out the English cry'd, to interrupt their Song: But they, which knew to this more matter must belong, Not out at all for that, nor any whit dismay'd, But to their well-tun'd Harps their fingers closelie laid: Twixt every one of which they plac't their Countries Crowd, And with courageous spirits thus boldly sang aloud; How Merlin by his skill, and Magiques wondrous might, From Ireland hither brought the Stonendge in a night: And for Carmardens sake, would faine have brought to passe, About it to have built a wall of solid Brasse: And set his Fiends to work upon the mightie frame; Some to the Anvile: some, that still inforc't the flame: But whilst it was in hand, by loving of an Elfe (For all his wondrous skill) was coosned by him selfe. For, walking with his Fay, her to the Rocke hee brought, In which hee oft before his Nigromancies wrought: And going in thereat his Magiques to have showne, Shee stopt the Caverns mouth with an inchanted stone: Whose cunning strongly crost, amaz'd whilst he did stand, Shee captive him convay'd unto the Fairie Land. Then, how the laboring spirits, to Rocks by fetters bound, With bellowes rumbling groanes, and hammers thundring sound, A fearefull horrid dinne still in the Earth doe keepe, Their Master to awake, suppos'd by them to sleepe; As at their work how still the grieved spirits repine, Tormented in the Fire, and tyred at the Mine. When now the British side scarce finished their Song, But th'English that repyn'd to be delay'd so long, All quicklie at the hint, as with one free consent, Strooke up at once and sung each to the Instrument; (Of sundry sorts that were, as the Musician likes) On which the practic'd hand with perfect'st fingring strikes, Whereby their height of skill might liveliest be exprest. The trembling Lute some touch, some straine the Violl best In sets which there were seene, the musick wondrous choice: Some likewise there affect the Gamba with the voice, To shew that England could varietie afford. The sundry Musiques of England.Some that delight to touch the sterner wyerie Chord, The Cythron, the Pandore, and the Theorbo strike: The Gittern and the Kit the wandring Fidlers like. So were there some againe, in this their learned strife Loud Instruments that lov'd; the Cornet and the Phife, The Hoboy, Sagbut deepe, Recorder, and the Flute: Even from the shrillest Shawme unto the Cornamute. Some blowe the Bagpipe up, that plaies the Country-round: The Taber and the Pipe, some take delight to sound. Of Germanie they sung the long and ancient fame, From whence their noble Sires the valiant Saxons came, Who sought by Sea and Land Adventures farre and neere; And seizing at the last upon the Britans heere, Surpriz'd the spacious Ile, which still for theirs they hold: As in that Countries praise how in those times of old, Tuisco, Gomers sonne, from Gen. 11. 8. 9. unbuilt Babell brought His people to that place, with most high knowledge fraught, And under wholsome Lawes establisht their aboad; Whom his Tudeski since have honor'd as a God: Whose cleare creation made them absolute in all, Retaining till this time their pure Originall. And as they boast themselves the Nation most unmixt, Their language as at first, their ancient customes fixt, The people of the world most hardie, wise and strong; So gloriously they show, that all the rest among The Saxons of her sorts the very noblest were: And of those crooked Skaines they us'd in warre to beare, Which in their thundring tongue, the Germans, Handseax name, They Saxons first were call'd: whose farre extended fame For hardiness in warre, whom danger never fraid, Allur'd the Britans here to call them to their ayde: From whom they after reft Loëgria as their own, Brutes ofspring then too weake to keepe it beeing grown. This told: the Nymphs againe, in nimbler straines of wit, Next neatly come about, the Englishmen to quit Of that inglorious blot by Bastard William brought Upon this conquered Ile: then which Fate never wrought A fitter meane (say they) great Germany to grace; To graft againe in one, two Remnants of her race: Upon their severall waies, two severall times that went To forrage for themselves. The first of which shee sent To get their seat in Gaul: which on Nuestria light, The Normans and the Saxons of one blood. And (in a famous warre the Frenchmen put to flight) Possest that fruitfull place, where onely from their name Call'd North-men (from the North of Germanie that came, Who thence expeld the Gaules, and did their roomes supply) This, first Nuestria nam'd, was then call'd Normandy. That by this meanes, the lesse (in conquering of the great) Be'ing drawne from their late home unto this ampler seat, Resyding heere, resign'd what they before had wonne; The Normans lost that name and became English. That as the Conquerors blood, did to the conquered runne: So kindlie beeing mixt, and up together growne, As severed, they were hers; united, stil her owne. But these mysterious things desisting now to show (The secret works of heaven) to long Descents they goe: How Egelred (the Sire of Edward the last King Of th'English Saxon Line) by nobly marying With hardie Richards heire, the Norman Emma, bred Alliance in their bloods. Like Brooks that from one head Beare severall waies (as though to sundry Seas to hast) But by the varying soyle, int' one againe are cast: So chanced it in this the neernes of their blood. For when as Englands right in question after stood, Proud Harould, Goodwins heire, the Scepter having wonne From Edgar Etheling young, the outlaw'd Edwards sonne; The valiant Bastard this his onelie colour made, With his brave Norman powers this kingdome to invade. Which leaving, they proceed to Pedigrees againe, Their after-Kings to fetch from that old Saxon straine; From Margarit that was made the Scottish Malcoms Bride, Who to her Grandsire had courageous Ironside: Which out-law'd Edward left; whose wife to him did bring This Margarit Queene of Scots, and Edgar Etheling: That Margarit brought forth Maud; which gracious Macolme gave To Henry Beuclarks bed (so Fate it pleas'd to have) Who him a daughter brought; which heaven did strangely spare: And for the speciall love he to the mother bare, Her Maude againe he nam'd, to th'Almain Emperor wed: Whose Dowager whilst shee liv'd (her puissant Cæsar dead) She th'Earle of Anjou next to husband doth prefer. The second Henry then by him begot of her, Into the Saxon Line the Scepter thus doth bring. Then presently againe prepare themselves to sing The sundry foraine Fields the English-men had fought. Which when the Mountaines sawe (and not in vaine) they thought That if they still went on as thus they had begon, Then from the Cambrian Nymphs (sure) Lundy would be won. And therefore from their first they challeng'd them to flie; And (idly running on with vaine prolixitie) A larger subject tooke then it was fit they should. But, whilst those would proceed, these threatning them to hold, These &amp; the rest following, the famousest Hills in Brecknocke, Glamorgan, and Monmouth. Black-Mountaine for the love he to his Country bare, As to the beautious Uske, his joy and onely care (In whose defence t'appeare more sterne and full of dread) Put on a Helme of clowds upon his rugged head. Mounchdeny doth the like for his beloved Tawe: Which quicklie all the rest by their example drawe: As Hatterell in the right of ancient Wales will stand. To these three Mountaines, first of the Brekinnian Band, The Monumethian Hills, like insolent and stout, On loftie tip-toes then began to looke about; That Skeridvaur at last (a Mountaine much in might, In hunting that had set his absolute delight) Caught up his Welch-hook. Country Hooke; nor cares for future harmes, But irefully enrag'd, would needs to open Armes: Which quicklie put So named of his bald head. Penvayle in such outrageous heat, That whilst for verie teene his hairelesse scalpe doth sweat, The Blorench looketh bigge upon his bared crowne: And tall Tomberlow seemes so terribly to frowne, That where it was suppos'd with small adoe or none Th'event of this debate would easely have been known, Such strange tumultuous stirres upon this strife ensue, As where all griefes should end, old sorrowes still renue: That Severne thus forewarn'd to looke unto the worst (And findes the latter ill more dangerous then the first) The doome she should pronounce, yet for a while delay'd, Till these rebellious routs by justice might be stay'd; A period that doth put to my Discourse so long, To finish this debate the next ensuing Song. The fift Song. The Argument. In this Song, Severne gives the doome What of her Lundy should become. And whilst the nimble Cambrian Rills Daunce Hy-day-gies amongst the Hills, The Muse them to Carmarden brings; Where Merlins wondrous birth shee sings. From thence to Penbrooke shee doth make, To see how Milford state doth take: The scattered Ilands there doth tell: And, visiting Saint Davids Cell, Doth sport her all the shores along, Preparing the ensuing Song. Now Sabrine, as a Queene, miraculouslie faire, Is absolutelie plac't in her Emperiall Chaire Of Crystall richlie wrought, that gloriously did shine, Her Grace becomming well, a creature so Divine: And as her God-like selfe, so glorious was her Throne, In which himselfe to sit great Neptune had been known; Whereon there were ingrav'd those Nymphs the God had woo'd, And every severall shape wherein for love he su'd; Each daughter, her estate and beautie, every sonne; What Nations he had rul'd, what Countries he had wonne. No Fish in this wide waste but with exceeding cost Was there in Antique worke most curiously imbost. Shee, in a watchet weed, with manie a curious wave, Which as a princelie gift great Amphitrite gave; Whose skirts were to the knee, with Corall fring'd belowe To grace her goodly steppes. And where she meant to goe, The path was strew'd with Pearle: which though they Orient were, Yet scarce knowne from her feet, they were so wondrous cleere: To whom the Mermaids hold her Glasse, that she may see Before all other Floods how farre her beauties bee: Who was by Nereus taught, the most profoundly wise, That learned her the skill of hidden Prophecies, By Thetis speciall care; as Chiron brought up Achilles, son to Thetis. Chiron earst had done To that proud bane of Troy, her god-resembling sonne. For her wise censure now, whilst everie listning Flood (When reason some-what coold their late distempred mood) Inclosed Severne in; before this mightie rout, Shee sitting well prepar'd, with countenance grave and stout, Like some great learned Judge, to end a waightie Cause, Well furnisht with the force of Arguments and Lawes, And everie speciall proofe that justlie may be brought; Now with a constant brow, a firme and setled thought, And at the point to give the last and finall doome: The people crowding neere within the pestred roome, A slowe, soft murmuring moves amongst the wondring throng As though with open eares they would devoure his tongue: So Severne bare her selfe, and silence so she wanne, When to th'assembly thus shee seriouslie began; My neere and loved Nymphs, good hap yee both betide: Well Britans have yee sung; you English, well repli'd: Which to succeeding times shall memorize your stories To either Countries praise, as both your endlesse glories. And from your listning eares, sith vaine it were to hold What all-appointing Heaven will plainlie shall be told, Both gladlie be you pleas'd: for thus the Powers reveale, That when the Norman Line in strength shall lastlie faile (Fate limiting the time) th'ancient Britan race Shall come againe to sit upon the soveraigne place. A branch sprung out of Brute, th'imperiall top shall get, Which grafted in the stock of great Plantaginet, The Stem shall strongly wax, as still the Trunk doth wither: That power which bare it thence, againe shall bring it thither By Tudor, with faire winds from little Britaine driven, To whom the goodlie Bay of Milford shall be given; As thy wise Prophets, Wales, fore-told his wisht arrive, And how Lewellins Line in him should doubly thrive. For from his issue sent to Albany before, Where his neglected blood, his vertue did restore, Hee first unto himselfe in faire succession gain'd The Stewards nobler name; and afterward attain'd The royall Scottish wreath, upholding it in state. This Stem, to James the fourth, sirnamed Steward, maried Margaret, eldest daughter to Henry the 7. King of England. Tudors joyn'd (which thing all-powerfull Fate So happily produc't out of that prosperous Bed, Whose mariages conjoynd the White-rose and the Red) Suppressing every Plant, shall spred it selfe so wide, As in his armes shall clip the Ile on every side. By whom three sever'd Realmes in one shall firmlie stand, As Britain-founding Brute first Monarchiz'd the Land: And Cornwall, for that thou no longer shalt contend, But to old Cambria cleave, as to thy ancient friend, Acknowledge thou thy Brood, of Brutes high blood to bee; And what hath hapt to her, the like t'have chanc't to thee; The Britains to receive, when Heaven on them did lowre, Loëgria forc't to leave; who from the Saxons powre Themselves in Deserts, Creeks, and Mount'nous wasts bestow'd, Or where the fruitlesse Rocks could promise them aboad: Why strive yee then for that, in little time that shall (As you are all made one) be one unto you all; Then take my finall doome pronounced lastlie, this; That Lundy like ally'd to Wales and England is. Each part most highlie pleas'd, then up the Session brake: When to the learned Maids againe Invention spake; O yee Pegasian Nymphs, that hating viler things; Delight in loftie Hills, and in delicious Springs, That on Piërus borne, and named of the place, The Thracian Pimpla love, and Pindus often grace; The seats of the Muses. In Aganippas Fount, and in Castalia's brims, That often have been known to bathe your crystall lims, Conduct me through these Brooks, and with a fastned clue, Direct mee in my course, to take a perfect view Of all the wandring Streames, in whose entransing gyres, Wise Nature oft her selfe her workmanship admires (So manifold they are, with such Meanders wound, As may with wonder seeme invention to confound) That to those British names, untaught the eare to please, Such relish I may give in my delicious layes, That all the armed Orks of Neptunes grislie Band, With musick of my verse, amaz'd may listning stand; As when his Trytons trumps doe them to battell call Within his surging lists to combat with the Whale. Thus, have we over-gone the Glamorganian Gowre, Whose Promontorie (plac't to check the Oceans powre) Severne, turn'd Sea.Kept Severne yet her selfe, till beeing growne too great, Shee with extended armes unbounds her ancient seat: And turning lastlie Sea, resignes unto the Maine What soveraigntie her selfe but latelie did retaine. Next, Loghor leads the way, who with a lustie crue (Her wild and wandring steps that ceaseleslie pursue) Still forward is inforc't: as, Amond thrusts her on, And Morlas (as a mayd shee much relies upon) Intreats her present speed; assuring her withall, Her best-beloved Ile, Bachannis, for her fall, Stands specially prepar'd, of every thing suppli'd. When Guendra with such grace deliberatly doth glide As Tovy doth entice: who setteth out prepar'd At all points like a Prince, attended with a Guard: Of which, as by her name, the neer'st to her of kin Is Toothy, tripping downe from Verwins rushie A Poole or watry Moore. Lin, Through Rescob running out, with Pescover to meet Those Rills that Forest loves; and doth so kindly greet, As to intreat their stay shee gladlie would prevaile. Then Tranant nicelie treads upon the watry traile: The livelie skipping Brane, along with Gwethrick goes; In Tovies wandring banks themselves that scarcely lose, But Mudny, with Cledaugh, and Sawthy, soone resort, Which at Langaddock grace their Soveraignes watry Court. As when the servile world some gathering man espies, Whose thriving fortune showes, he to much wealth may rise, And through his Princes grace his followers may preferre, Or by revenew left by some dead Ancester; All lowting lowe to him, him humbly they observe, And happy is that man his nod that may deserve: To Tovy so they stoupe, to them upon the way Which thus displaies the Spring within their view that lay. Neere Denevoir, the seat of the Of Southwales. Demetian King Whilst Cambria was herselfe, full, strong, and florishing, There is a pleasant Spring, Ebbing and flowing with the Sea. that constant doth abide Hard-by these winding shores wherein wee nimblie slide; Long of the Ocean lov'd, since his victorious hand First proudlie did insult upon the conquer'd Land. And though a hundred Nymphs in faire Demetia bee, Whose features might allure the Sea-gods more then shee, His fancie takes her forme, and her he onelie likes (Who ere knew halfe the shafts where-with blind Cupid strikes?) Which great and constant faith, shew'd by the God of Sea, This cleere and lovelie Nymph so kindlie doth repay, As suffring for his sake what love to Lover owes, With him she sadlie ebbs, with him she proudlie flowes, To him her secret vowes perpetually doth keepe, Observing everie Lawe and custome of the Deepe. Now Tovy towa'rd her fall (Langaddock over-gon) Her Dulas forward drives: and Cothy comming on The traine to over-take, the neerest way doth cast Ere shee Carmarden get: where Gwilly, making hast, Bright Tovy entertaines at that most famous Towne Which her great Prophet bred who Wales doth so renowne: And taking her a Harpe, and tuning well the strings, To Princely Tovy thus shee of the Prophet sings; Of Merlin and his skill what Region doth not heare? The world shall still be full of Merlin everie where. Merlin, borne in Caer-merd-hin. A thousand lingering yeeres his prophecies have runne, And scarcely shall have end till Time it selfe be done: Who of a British Nymph was gotten, whilst shee plaid With a seducing Spirit, which wonne the goodlie maid; (As all Demetia through, there was not found her peere) Who, be'ing so much renown'd for beautie farre and neere, Great Lords her liking sought, but still in vaine they prov'd: That Spirit (to her unknowne) this Virgin onelie lov'd; Which taking humane shape, of such perfection seemd, As (all her Suters scorn'd) shee onelie him esteem'd. Who, fayning for her sake that he was come from farre, And richlie could endow (a lustie Batcheler) On her that Prophet got, which from his Mothers wombe Of things to come fore-told untill the generall Doome. But, of his fayned birth in sporting idlie thus, Suspect mee not, that I this dreamed Incubus By strange opinions should licentiouslie subsist; Or, selfe-conceited, play the humorous Platonist, Which boldlie dares affirme, that Spirits, themselves supply With bodies, to commix with fraile mortalitie, And heere allow them place, beneath this lower Sphere Of the unconstant Moone; to tempt us dailie here. Some, earthly mixture take; as others, which aspire, Them subt'ler shapes resume, of water, ayre, and fire, Being those immortalls long before the heaven, that fell, Whose deprivation thence, determined their hell: And loosing through their pride that place to them assign'd, Predestined that was to mans regenerate kind, They, for th'inveterate hate to his Election, still Desist not him to tempt to every damned ill: And to seduce the spirit, oft prompt the frailer blood, Invegling it with tastes of counterfetted good, And teach it all the sleights the Soule that may excite To yeeld up all her power unto the appetite. And to those curious wits if we our selves apply, Which search the gloomie shades of deepe Philosophy, They Reason so will clothe, as well the mind can show, That contrarie effects, from contraries may grow; And that the soule a shape so stronglie may conceat, As to her selfe the-while may seeme it to creat; By which th'abused Sense more easelie oft is led To thinke that it enjoyes the thing imagined. But, toyld in these darke tracts with sundrie doubts repleat, Calme shades, and cooler streames must quench this furious heat: Which seeking, soone we finde where Cowen in her course, Tow'rds the Sabrinian shores, as sweeping from her sourse, Takes Towa, calling then Karkenny by the waie, Her through the waylesse woods of Cardiffe to convaie; A Forrest, with her floods inviron'd so about, That hardly she restraines th'unruly watrie rout, When swelling, they would seeme her Empire to invade: And oft the lustfull Fawnes and Satyres from her shade Were by the streames entic't, abode with them to make. Then Morlas meeting Taw, her kindly in doth take: Cair comming with the rest, their watrie tracts that tread, Increase the Cowen all; that as their generall head Their largesse doth receive, to beare out his expence: Who to vast Neptune leads this Courtly confluence. To the Passage into Penbrokeshire. Penbrokian parts the Muse her still doth keepe, Upon that utmost point to the Iberian Deepe, By Cowdra comming in: where cleere delightfull aire, (That Forrests most affect) doth welcome her repaire; The Heliconian Maids in pleasant groves delight: (Floods cannot still content their wanton appetite) And wandring in the woods, the neighbouring hils below, With wise Apollo meet (who with his Ivory bowe Once in the paler shades, the Serpent Python slew) And hunting oft with him, the heartlesse Deere pursue; Those beames then layde aside he us'd in heaven to weare. Another Forrest Nymph is Narber, standing neare; That with her curled top her neighbor would astound, Whose Groves once bravely grac't the faire Penbrokian ground, When Albion here beheld on this extended land, Amongst his wel-growne Woods, the shag-haird Satyrs stand (The Sylvans chiefe resort) the shores then sitting hie, Which under water now so many fadoms lie: And wallowing Porpice sport and lord it in the flood, Where once the portly Oke, and large-limb'd Popler stood: Of all the Forrests kind these two now onely left. But Time, as guilty since to mans insatiate theft, Transferd the English names of Townes and housholds hither, With the industrious Dutch since sojourning together. When wrathfull heaven the clouds so liberally bestow'd, The Seas (then wanting roomth to lay their boystrous loade) Upon the Belgian Marsh their pampred stomackes cast, That peopled Cities sanke into the mightie wast. The Flemings were inforc't to take them to their Ores, The colony of Flemings here planted. See to the IV. Song. To trie the Setting Maine to find out firmer shores; When as this spacious Ile them entrance did allow, To plant the Belgian stocke upon this goodly brow: These Nations, that their tongues did naturally affect, Both generallie forsooke the British Dialect: As when it was decreed by all-fore-dooming Fate, That ancient Rome should stoupe from her emperious state, With Nations from the North then altogether fraught, Which to her civill bounds their barbarous customes brought, Of all her ancient spoyles and lastlie be forlorne, From Tybers hallowed banks to old Now Constantinople. Bizantium borne: Th'abundant Latine then old Latium lastly left, Both of her proper forme and elegancie reft; Before her smoothest tongue, their speech that did prefer, And in her tables fixt their ill-shap't Character. A divination strange the Dutch made-English have, Appropriate to that place (as though some Power it gave) By th'shoulder of a Ram from off the right side par'd, Which usuallie they boile, the spade-boane beeing bar'd: Which then the Wizard takes, and gazing there-upon, Things long to come fore-showes, as things done long agon; Scapes secretlie at home, as those abroad, and farre; Murthers, adulterous stealths, as the events of warre, The raignes and death of Kings they take on them to know: Which onelie to their skill the shoulder-blade doth show. You goodlie sister Floods, how happy is your state! Or should I more commend your features, or your Fate; That Milford, which this Ile her greatest Port doth call Before your equall Floods is lotted to your Fall! Where was saile ever seene, or wind hath ever blowne, Whence Penbrooke yet hath heard of Haven like her owne? She bids Dungleddy dare Spaine. Iberias proudest Road, And chargeth her to send her challenges abroad Along the coast of France, to prove if any bee Her Milford that dare match: so absolute is shee. And Clethy comming downe from Wrenyvaur her Sire (A hill that thrusts his head into th'etheriall fire) Her sisters part doth take, and dare avouch as much: And Percily the proud, whom neerlie it doth touch, Said, he would beare her out; and that they all should know. And there-withall he struts, as though he scorn'd to show His head belowe the Heaven, when he of Milford spake: But there was not a Port the prize durst undertake. So highlie Milford is in every mouth renownd, Noe Haven hath ought good, in her that is not found: Whereas the swelling surge, that with his fomie head, The gentler looking Land with furie menaced, With his encountring wave no longer there contends; But sitting mildly downe like perfect ancient friends, Unmov'd of any wind which way so ere it blow, And rather seeme to smile, then knit an angry brow. The ships with shattred ribs scarce creeping from the Seas, On her sleeke bosome ride with such deliberate ease, As all her passed stormes shee holds but meane and base, So shee may reach at length this most delightfull place, By nature with proud Cleeves invironed about, To crowne the goodlie Road: where builds the Falcon stout, Which we the Gentill call; whose fleet and active wings, It seemes that Nature made when most shee thought on Kings: Which manag'd to the lure, her high and gallant flight, The vacant sportfull man so greatlie doth delight, That with her nimble quills his soule doth seeme to hover, And lie the verie pitch that lustie Bird doth cover; That those proud Airies, bred whereas the scorching skie The places from whence the highest flying Hawkes are brought. Doth sindge the sandie Wyldes of spicefull Barbarie; Or underneath our Pole, where Norwaies Forests wide Their high clowd-touching heads in Winter snowes doe hide, Out-brave not this our kind in mettle, nor exceed The Falcon, which some-times the British Cleeves doe breed: Which prey upon the Iles in the Vergivian waste, That from the British shores by Neptune are imbrac't; Which stem his furious Tides when wildliest they doe rave, And breake the big-swolne bulke of manie a boystrous wave: As, calme when hee becomes, then likewise in their glorie Doe cast their amorous eyes at many a Promontorie That thrust their foreheads forth into the smiling South; As Rat and Sheepy, set to keepe calme Milfords mouth, The Ilands upon the point of Penbrookeshire. Expos'd to Neptunes power. So Gresholme farre doth stand: Scalme, Stockholme, with Saint Bride, and Gatholme, neerer land (Which with their veinie breasts intice the gods of Sea, That with the lustie Iles doe revell every day) As Crescent-like the Land her bredth here inward bends, From Milford, which she forth to old Menevia sends; Since, holy Davids seat; which of especiall grace Doth lend that nobler name, to this unnobler place. Of all the holy men whose fame so fresh remaines, To whom the Britans built so many sumptuous Fanes, This Saint before the rest their Patron still they hold: Whose birth, their ancient Bards to Cambria long foretold; And seated heere a See, his Bishoprick of yore, Upon the farthest point of this unfruitfull shore; Selected by himselfe, that farre from all resort With contemplation seem'd most fitly to comport; That, voyd of all delight, cold, barren, bleake, and dry, No pleasure might allure, nor steale the wandring eye: Where Ramsey with those Rockes, in ranke that ordered stand Upon the furthest point of Davids ancient Land, Doe raise their rugged heads (the Sea-mans noted markes) Call'd, of their Mytred tops, The Bishop and his Clarkes; Into that Chanell cast, whose raging current rores Betwixt the British Sands, and the Hibernian shores: Whose grimme and horrid face doth pleased heaven neglect, And beares bleake Winter still in his more sad aspect: Yet Gwin and Nevern neere, two fine and fishfull brookes, Do never stay their course, how sterne so ere he lookes; Which with his shipping once should seeme to have commerst, Where Fiscard as her flood, doth only grace the first. To Newport fals the next: there we a while will rest; Our next ensuing Song to wondrous things addrest. The sixt Song. The Argument. With Cardigan the Muse proceeds, And tells what rare things Tivy breeds: Next, proud Plynillimon shee plyes; Where Severne, Wy, and Rydoll rise. With Severne shee along doth goe, Her Metamorphosis to showe; And makes the wandring Wy declame In honour of the British name: Then musters all the watry traine That those two Rivers entertaine: And viewing how those Rillets creepe From shore to the Vergivian Deepe, By Radnor and Mountgomery then To Severne turnes her course agen: And bringing all their Riverets in, There ends; a new Song to begin. Sith I must stem thy Streame, cleere Tivy, yet before The Muse vouchsafe to seise the Cardiganian shore, Shee of thy sourse will sing in all the Cambrian coast; Which of thy Castors once, but now canst onelie boast The Salmons, of all Floods most plentifull in thee. Deere Brooke, within thy Banks if anie Powers there bee; Then Neiads, or yee Nymphs of their like watrie kind (Unto whose onelie care, great Neptune hath assign'd The guidance of those Brooks wherein he takes delight) Assist her: and whilst shee your dwelling shall recite, Be present in her work: let her your graces view, That to succeeding times them livelie shee may shew; As when great Albions sonnes, which him a Sea-Nymph brought Amongst the grisly Rocks, were with your beauties caught (Whose onelie love surpriz'd those of the Giants Phlegrian size, The Titanois, that once against high Heaven durst rise) When as the hoarie woods, the climing hills did hide, And cover'd everie Vale through which you gentlie glide; Even for those inly heats which through your loves they felt, That oft in kindlie teares did in your bosomes melt, To view your secret Bowres, such favour let her win. Then Tivy commeth downe from her capacious Lin, Twixt Mirk and Brenny led, two handmaids, that doe stay Their Mistres, as in State shee goes upon her way. Which when Lanbeder sees, her wondrouslie shee likes: Whose untam'd bosome so the beautious Tivy strikes, As that the Forrest faine would have her there abide. But shee (so pure a streame) transported with her pride The offer idlie scorns; though with her flattering shade The Sylvan her entice with all that may perswade A water-Nymph; yea, though great Thetis selfe shee were: But nothing might prevaile, nor all the pleasures there Her mind could ever move one minutes staie to make. Mild Mathern then, the next, doth Tivy over-take: Which instantlie againe by Dittor is suppli'd. Then, Keach and Kerry helpe: twixt which on either side, To Cardigan shee comes, the Soveraigne of the Shere. Now Tivy let us tell thy sundrie glories here. When as the Salmon seekes a fresher streame to find (Which hither from the Sea comes yeerely by his kind, As he in season growes) and stems the watry tract Where Tivy falling downe, doth make a Falling of water. Cataract, Forc't by the rising Rocks that there her course oppose, As though within their bounds they meant her to inclose; Heere, when the labouring Fish doth at the foote arrive, And finds that by his strength but vainlie he doth strive, His taile takes in his teeth; and bending like a bowe, That's to the compasse drawne, aloft himself doth throwe: Then springing at his height, as doth a little wand, That bended end to end, and flerted from the hand, Farre off it selfe doth cast; so doth the Salmon vaut. And if at first he faile, his second The word in tumbling, when one casteth himselfe over and over. Summersaut Hee instantlie assaies; and from his nimble Ring, Still yarking, never leaves, untill himselfe he fling Above the streamefull top of the surrounded heape. More famous long agone, then for the Salmons leape, For Bevers Tivy was, in her strong banks that bred, Which else no other Brooke of Brittaine nourished: Where Nature, in the shape of this now-perisht beast His propertie did seeme t'have wondrouslie exprest; Be'ing bodied like a Boat, with such a mightie taile As serv'd him for a bridge, a helme, or for a saile, When Kind did him commaund the Architect to play, That his strong Castle built of branched twigs and clay: Which, set upon the Deepe, but yet not fixed there, Hee easelie could remove as it he pleas'd to stere To this side or to that; the workmanship so rare, His stuffe where-with to build, first beeing to prepare, A forraging he goes, to Groves or bushes nie, And with his teeth cuts downe his Timber: which laid-by, He turnes him on his back, his belly laid abroad, When with what he hath got, the other doe him load, Till lastlie by the weight, his burthen hee have found. Then, with his mightie taile his carriage having bound As Carters doe with ropes, in his sharpe teeth hee grip't Some stronger stick: from which the lesser branches stript, He takes it in the midst; at both the ends, the rest Hard holding with their fangs, unto the labour prest, Going backward, tow'rds their home their loaded carriage led, From whom, those first heere borne, were taught the usefull Sled. Then builded he his Fort with strong and several fights; His passages contriv'd with such unusuall sleights, That from the Hunter oft he issu'd undiscern'd, As if men from this Beast to fortifie had learn'd; Whose Kind, in her decay'd, is to this Ile unknowne. Thus Tivy boasts this Beast peculiarly her owne. But here why spend I time these trifles to areed? Now, with thy former taske my Muse againe proceed, To shewe the other Floods from the Of Cardigan. Cerettick shore To the Vergivian Sea contributing their store: With Bidder first begin, that bendeth all her force The Arron to assist, Arth holding on her course The way the other went, with Werry which doth win Faire Istwid to her ayde; who kindlie comming in, Meets Rydoll at her mouth, that faire and princelie maid, Plynillimons deere child, deliciouslie arraid, As fits a Nymph so neere to Severne and her Queene. Then come the sister Salks, as they before had seene Those delicater Dames so trippinglie to tread: Then Kerry; Cletur next, and Kinver making head With Enion, that her like cleere Levant brings by her. Plynillimons high praise no longer Muse defer; What once the Druids told, how great those Floods should bee That here (most mightie Hill) derive themselves from thee. The Bards with furie rapt, the British youth among, Unto the charming Harpe thy future honor song In brave and loftie straines; that in excesse of joy, The Beldam and the Girle, the Grandsire and the Boy, With shouts and yearning cries, the troubled ayre did load (As when with crowned cuppes unto the Bacchus. Elian God Those Priests his Orgyes held; or when the old world saw Full Phœbes face eclipst, and thinking her to daw, Whom they supposed falne in some inchanted swound, Of beaten tinkling Brasse still ply'd her with the sound) That all the Cambrian hills, which high'st their heads doe beare With most obsequious showes of lowe subjected feare, Should to thy greatnes stoupe: and all the Brooks that be, Doe homage to those Floods that issued out of thee: To princelie Severne first; next, to her sister Wye, Which to her elders Court her course doth still apply. But Rydoll, young'st, and least, and for the others pride Not finding fitting roomth upon the rising side, Alone unto the West directlie takes her way. So all the neighboring Hills Plynillimon obey. For, though Moylvadian beare his craggy top so hie, As scorning all that come in compasse of his eye, Yet greatlie is he pleas'd Plynillimon will grace Him with a cheerfull looke: and, fawning in his face, His love to Severne showes as though his owne she were, The storie of Severne.Thus comforting the Flood; O ever-during heire Of Sabrine, Locryns child (who of her life bereft, Her ever-living name to thee faire River left) Brutes first begotten sonne, which Gwendolin did wed; But soone th'unconstant Lord abandoned her bed (Through his unchaste desire) for beautious Elstreds love. Now, that which most of all her mightie hart did move, Her Father, Cornwalls Duke, great Corineus dead, Was by the lustfull King unjustlie banished. When shee, who to that time still with a smoothed brow Had seem'd to beare the breach of Locrines former vow, Perceiving stil her wrongs insufferable were; Growne bigge with the revenge which her full breast did beare, And ayded to the birth with every little breath (Alone shee beeing left the spoyle of love and death, In labour of her griefe outrageously distract, The utmost of her spleene on her false Lord to act) Shee first implores their aide to hate him whom shee found; Whose harts unto the depth she had not left to sound. To Cornwall then shee sends (her Country) for supplies: Which all at once in Armes with Gwendolin arise. Then with her warlike power, her husband shee pursu'd, Whom his unlawfull love too vainlie did delude. The fierce and jealous Queene, then voyde of all remorce, As great in power as spirit, whilst hee neglects her force, Him suddainlie surpriz'd, and from her irefull hart All pittie cleane exil'd (whom nothing could convert) The sonne of mightie Brute bereaved of his life; Amongst the Britans here the first intestine strife, Since they were put a-land upon this promis'd shore. Then crowning Madan King, whom shee to Locrine bore, And those which serv'd his Sire to his obedience brought; Not so with blood suffic'd, immediatly she sought The mother and the child: whose beautie when shee saw, Had not her hart been flint, had had the power to draw A spring of pittying teares; when, dropping liquid pearle, Before the cruell Queene, the Ladie and the Girle Upon their tender knees begg'd mercie. Woe for thee Faire Elstred, that thou should'st thy fairer Sabrine see, As shee should thee behold the prey to her sterne rage Whom kinglie Locrins death suffic'd not to asswage: Who from the bordring Cleeves thee with thy Mother cast Into thy christned Flood, the whilst the Rocks aghast Resounded with your shriekes; till in a deadlie dreame Your corses were dissolv'd into that crystall streame, Your curles to curled waves, which plainlie still appeare The same in water now, that once in locks they were: And, as you wont to clip each others neck before, Yee now with liquid armes embrace the wandring shore. But leave we Severne heere, a little to pursue The often wandring Wye (her passages to view, As wantonlie shee straines in her lascivious course) And muster every flood that from her bountious sourse Attends upon her Streame, whilst (as the famous bound Twixt the Brecknokian earth, and the Radnorian ground) Shee every Brooke receives. First, Clarwen commeth in, With Clarwy: which to them their consort Eland win To ayde their goodly Wye; which, Ithon gets againe: She Dulas drawes along: and in her watry traine Clowedock hath recourse, and Comran; which she brings Unto their wandring flood from the Radnorian Springs: As Edwy her attends, and Matchwy forward heaves Her Mistresse. When, at last the goodly Wye perceaves Shee now was in that part of Wales, of all the rest Which (as her very waste) in breadth from East to West, In length from North to South, her midst is every way, From Severns bordring banks unto the either Sea, And might be tearm'd her hart. The ancient Britans heere The River calls to mind, and what those British were Whilst Britain was her selfe, the Queene of all the West. To whose old Nations praise whilst shee her selfe addrest, From the Brecknokian bound when Irvon comming in, Her Dulas, with Commarch, and Wevery that doth win, Perswading her for them good matter to provide. The Wood-Nymphs so againe, from the Radnorian side, As Radnor, with Blethaugh, and Knuckles Forrests, call To Wye, and bad her now bestirre her for them all: For, if shee stuck not close in their distressed Case, The Britans were in doubt to under-goe disgrace. That stronglie thus provok't, shee for the Britans saies; What spirit can lift you up, to that immortall praise You worthilie deserve? by whom first Gaul was taught Her knowledge: and for her, what Nation ever wrought The conquest you atchiev'd? And, as you were most drad, So yee (before the rest) in so great reverence had Your Bards which sung your deeds, that when sterne hosts have stood With lifted hands to strike (in their inflamed blood) One Bard but comming in, their murd'rous swords hath staid; In her most dreadful voice as thundring heaven had said, Stay Britans: when he spake, his words so powrefull were. So to her native Priests, the dreadlesse Druides here, The neerest neighboring Gaul, that wiselie could discerne Th'effect their doctrine wrought, it for their good to learne, Her apt and pregnant Youth sent hither yeere by yeere, Instructed in our Rites with most religious feare. And afterward againe, when as our ancient seat Her surcrease could not keepe, growne for her soile too great (But like to casting Bees, so rising up in swarmes) Our Cymbri with the Gaules, that their commixed Armes Joyn'd with the German powers (those Nations of the North Which over-spread the world) together issued forth: Where, with our brazen swords, we stoutly fought, and long; And after Conquests got, residing them among, First planted in those parts our brave courageous brood: Whose natures so adher'd unto their ancient blood, As from them sprang those Priests, whose praise so farre did sound, Through whom that spacious Gaul was after so renown'd. Nor could the Saxons swords (which many a lingring yeere Them sadlie did afflict, and shut us Britans heere Twixt Severne and this Sea) our mightie minds deject; But that even they which fain'st our weaknes would detect, Were forced to confesse, our wildest beasts that breed Upon our mightie wastes, or on our Mountaines feed, Were farre more sooner tam'd, then heere our Welch-men were: Besides, in all the world no Nation is so deere As they unto their owne; that here within this Ile, Or else in forraine parts, yea, forced to exile, The noble Britan still his countryman releeves; A Patriot, and so true, that it to death him greeves To heare his Wales disgrac't: and on the Saxons swords Oft hazardeth his life, ere with reprochefull words His Language or his Leeke hee'le stand to heare abus'd. Besides, the Britan is so naturallie infus'd With true Poëtick rage, that in their See to the fourth Song. measures, Art Doth rather seeme precise, then comlie; in each part Their Metre most exact, in Verse of th'hardest kind. And some to riming be so wondrouslie inclin'd, Those Numbers they will hit, out of their genuine vaine, Which many wise and learn'd can hardly ere attaine. O memorable Bards, of unmixt blood, which still Posteritie shall praise for your so wondrous skill, That in your noble Songs, the long Descents have kept Of your great Heroës, else in Lethe that had slept, With theirs whose ignorant pride your labours have disdain'd; How much from time, and them, how bravelie have you gain'd! Musician, Herault, Bard, thrice maist thou be renown'd, And with three severall wreathes immortallie be crown'd; Who, when to Penbrooke call'd before the English King, And to thy powerfull Harpe commaunded there to sing, Of famous Arthur told'st, and where hee was interr'd; In which, those retchlesse times had long and blindlie err'd, And Ignorance had brought the world to such a pass As now, which scarce beleeves that Arthur ever was. But when King Henry the second. Henry sent th'reported place to view, He found that man of men: and what thou said'st was true. Heere then I cannot chuse but bitterlie exclame Against those fooles that all Antiquitie defame, Because they have found out, some credulous Ages layd Slight fictions with the truth, whilst truth on rumor stayd; And that one forward Time (perceiving the neglect A former of her had) to purchase her respect, With toyes then trimd her up, the drowsie world t'allure, And lent her what it thought might appetite procure To man, whose mind doth still varietie pursue; And therefore to those things whose grounds were verie true, Though naked yet and bare (not having to content The weyward curious eare) gave fictive ornament; And fitter thought, the truth they should in question call, Then coldlie sparing that, the truth should goe and all. And surelie I suppose, that which this froward time Doth scandalize her with to be her heynous crime, That hath her most preserv'd: for, still where wit hath found A thing most cleerlie true, it made that, fictions ground: Which shee suppos'd might give sure colour to them both: From which, as from a roote, this wondred error grow'th At which our Criticks gird, whose judgements are so strict, And he the bravest man who most can contradict That which decrepit Age (which forced is to leane Upon Tradition) tells; esteeming it so meane, As they it quite reject, and for some trifling thing (Which Time hath pind to Truth) they all away will fling. These men (for all the world) like our Precisions bee, Who for some Crosse or Saint they in the window see Will pluck downe all the Church: Soule-blinded sots that creepe In durt, and never saw the wonders of the Deepe. Therefore (in my conceit) most rightlie serv'd are they That to the Roman trust (on his report that stay) Our truth from him to learne, as ignorant of ours As we were then of his; except t'were of his powers: Who our wise Druides here unmercifullie slew; Like whom, great Natures depths no men yet ever knew, Nor with such dauntlesse spirits were ever yet inspir'd; Who at their proud arrive th'ambitious Romans fir'd When first they heard them preach the soules immortall state; And even in Romes despight, and in contempt of Fate, Graspt hands with horrid death: which out of hate and pride They slew, who through the world were reverenced beside. To understand our state, no marvaile then though wee Should so to Cæsar seeke, in his reports to see What ancientlie we were; when in our infant war, Unskilfull of our tongue but by Interpreter, Hee nothing had of ours which our great Bards did sing, Except some few poore words; and those againe to bring Unto the Latine sounds, and easiness they us'd, By their most filed speech, our British most abus'd. But of our former state, beginning, our descent, The warres we had at home, the conquests where we went, He never understood. And though the Romans here So noble Trophies left, as verie worthie were A people great as they, yet did they ours neglect, Long rear'd ere they arriv'd. And where they doe object, The Ruines and Records we show, be verie small To prove our selves so great: even this the most of all (Gainst their objection) seemes miraculous to mee, That yet those should be found so generall as they bee; The Roman, next the Pict, the Saxon, then the Dane, All landing in this Ile, each like a horrid raine Deforming her; besides the sacrilegious wrack Of many a noble Booke, as impious hands should sack The Center, to extirp all knowledge, and exile All brave and ancient things, for ever from this Ile: Expressing wondrous griefe, thus wandring Wye did sing. But, backe, industrious Muse; obsequiously to bring Cleere Severne from her sourse, and tell how she doth straine Downe her delicious Dales; with all the goodly traine, Brought forth the first of all by Brugan: which to make Her party worthy note, next, Dulas in doth take. Moylvadian his much love to Severne then to showe, Upon her Southerne side, sends likewise (in a rowe) Bright Biga, that brings on her friend and fellow Floyd; Next, Dungum; Bacho then is busily imploy'd, Tarranon, Carno, Hawes, with Becan, and the Rue, In Severn's soveraine Bankes, that give attendance due. Thus as she swoopes along, with all that goodly traine, Upon her other Banke by Newtowne: so againe Comes Dulas (of whose name so many Rivers bee, As of none others is) with Mule, prepar'd to see The confluence to their Queene, as on her course she makes: Then at Mountgomery next cleere Kennet in she takes; Where little Fledding fals into her broader Banke; Forkt Vurnway, bringing Tur, and Tanot: growing ranke, She plyes her towards the Poole, from the Gomerian feelds; Then which in all our Wales, there is no country yeelds An excellenter Horse, so full of naturall fire, As one of Phœbus Steeds had beene that Stalyons sire Which first their race begun; or of th'Asturian kind, Which some have held to be begotten by the Wind, Upon the Mountaine Mare; which strongly it receaves, And in a little time her pregnant part upheaves. But, leave we this to such as after wonders long: The Muse prepares her selfe unto another Song. The seaventh Song. The Argument. The Muse from Cambria comes againe, To view the Forrest of faire Deane; Sees Severne; when the Higre takes her, How Fever-like the sicknes shakes her; Makes mightie Malverne speake his mind In honour of the Mountaine kind; Thence wafted with a merry gale, Sees Lemster, and the Golden Vale; Sports with the Nymphs, themselves that ply At th'wedding of the Lug and Wy; Viewing the Herefordian pride Along on Severns setting side, That small Wigornian part survaies: Where for a while herselfe shee staies. High matters call our Muse, inviting her to see As well the lower Lands, as those where latelie shee The Cambrian Mountaines clome, &amp; (looking from aloft) Survaid coy Severns course: but now to shores more soft Shee shapes her prosperous saile; and in this loftie Song, The Herefordian floods invites with her along, That fraught from plentious Powse, with their superfluous waste, Manure the batfull March, untill they be imbrac't In Sabrins Soveraigne armes: with whose tumultuous waves Shut up in narrower bounds, the Higre wildly raves; And frights the stragling flocks, the neighbouring shores to flie A farre as from the Maine it comes with hideous cry, And on the angry front the curled foame doth bring, The billowes gainst the banks when fiercely it doth fling; Hurles up the slimie ooze, and makes the scalie brood Leape madding to the Land affrighted from the flood; Oreturnes the toyling Barge, whose steresman doth not lanch, And thrusts the furrowing beake into her irefull panch: As when we haplie see a sicklie woman fall Into a fit of that which wee the Mother call, A Simile expressing the Boare or Higre.When from the grieved wombe shee feeles the paine arise, Breakes into grievous sighes, with intermixed cries, Bereaved of her sense; and strugling still with those That gainst her rising paine their utmost strength oppose, Starts, tosses, tumbles, strikes, turnes, touses, spurnes and spraules, Casting with furious lims her holders to the walles; But that the horrid pangs torments the grieved so, One well might muse from whence this suddaine strength should grow. Here (Queene of Forrests all, that West of Severne lie) Her broad and bushie top Deane holdeth up so hie, The lesser are not seene, shee is so tall and large. And standing in such state upon the winding marge, Within her hollow woods the Satyres that did wonne In gloomie secret shades, not pierc't with Sommers sunne, Under a false pretence the Nymphs to entertaine, Oft ravished the choice of Sabrins watry traine; And from their Mistris banks them taking as a prey, Unto their wooddie Caves have carried them away: Then from her inner Groves for succour when they cri'd, Shee retchlesse of their wrongs (her Satyres scapes to hide) Unto their just complaint not once her eare enclines: So fruitfull in her Woods, and wealthy in her Mines, That Leden which her way doth through the Desert make, Though neere to Deane ally'd, determin'd to forsake Her course, and her cleere lims amongst the bushes hide, Least by the Sylvans (should she chance to be espide) Shee might unmaidned goe unto her Soveraigne Flood: So manie were the rapes done on the watry brood, That Sabrine to her Sire (great Neptune) forc't to sue, The ryots to represse of this outrageous crue, His armed Orks hee sent her milder streame to keepe, To drive them back to Deane that troubled all the Deepe. Whilst Malverne (king of Hills) faire Severne over-lookes (Attended on in state with tributarie Brookes) And how the fertill fields of Hereford doe lie. And from his many heads, with many an amorous eye Beholds his goodlie site, how towards the pleasant rise, Abounding in excesse, the Vale of Evsham lies, The Mountaines every way about him that doe stand, Of whom hee's daily seene, and seeing doth command; On tiptoes set aloft, this proudlie uttereth hee: Olympus, fayr'st of Hills, that Heaven art said to bee, I not envie thy state, nor lesse my selfe doe make; Nor to possesse thy name, mine owne would I forsake: Nor would I, as thou doost, ambitiouslie aspire To thrust my forked top into th'ethereall fire. For, didst thou taste the sweets that on my face doe breathe, Above thou wouldst not seeke what I enjoy beneath: Besides, the sundry soyles I every where survay, Make me, if better not, thy equall everie way. And more, in our defence, to answere those, with spight That tearme us barren, rude, and voide of all delight; Wee Mountaines, to the Land, like Warts or Wens to bee, By which, fair'st living things disfigur'd oft they see; This stronglie to performe, a well stuft braine would need. And manie Hills there be, if they this Cause would heed, Having their rising tops familiar with the skie (From whence all wit proceeds) that fitter were then I The taske to under-take. As not a man that sees Mounchdenny, Blorench hill, with Breedon, and the Clees, And many more as great, and neerer me then they, But thinks, in our defence they far much more could say. Yet, falling to my lot, This stoutlie I maintaine Gainst Forrests, Valleys, Fields, Groves, Rivers, Pasture, Plaine, And all their flatter kind (so much that doe relie Upon their feedings, flocks, and their fertilitie) The Mountaine is the King: and he it is alone Above the other soyles that Nature doth in-throne. For Mountaines be like Men of brave heroïque mind, With eyes erect to heaven, of whence themselves they find; Whereas the lowlie Vale, as earthlie, like it selfe, Doth never further looke then how to purchase pelfe. And of their batfull sites, the Vales that boast them thus, Nere had been what they are, had it not been for us: For, from the rising banks that stronglie mound them in, The Valley (as betwixt) her name did first begin: And almost not a Brooke, if shee her banks doe fill, But hath her plentious Spring from Mountaine or from Hill. If Mead, or lower Slade, grieve at the roome we take, Knowe that the snowe or raine, descending oft, doth make The fruitfull Valley fat, with what from us doth glide, Who with our Winters waste maintaine their Sommers pride. And to you lower Lands if terrible wee seeme, And cover'd oft with clowds; it is your foggy steame The powerfull Sunne exhales, that in the cooler day Unto this Region comne, about our tops doth stay. And, what's the Grove, so much that thinks her to be grac't, If not above the rest upon the Mountaine plac't, Where shee her curled head unto the eye may showe? For, in the easie Vale if shee be set belowe, What is shee but obscure? and her more dampie shade And covert, but a Den for beasts of ravin made? Besides, wee are the Marks, which looking from an hie, The travailer beholds; and with a cheerfull eye Doth thereby shape his course, and freshlie doth pursue The way which long before lay tedious in his view. What Forrest, Flood, or Field, that standeth not in awe Of Sina, or shall see the sight that Mountaine saw? To none but to a Hill such grace was ever given: As on his back tis said, great Atlas beares up heaven. Endymion found out the course of the Moone.So Latmus by the wise Endymion is renown'd; That Hill, on whose high top he was the first that found Pale Phœbes wandring course; so skilfull in her Sphere, As some stick not to say that he enjoy'd her there. And those chaste maids, begot on Memorie by Jove, Not Tempe onelie love delighting in their Grove; Nor Helicon their Brooke, in whose delicious brims, They oft are us'd to bathe their cleere and crystall lims; But high Parnassus have, their Mountaine, whereon they Upon their golden Lutes continuallie doe play. Of these I more could tell, to prove the place our owne, Then by his spatious Maps are by Ortellius showne. For Mountaines this suffice. Which scarcelie had he told; Along the fertill fields, when Malverne might behold The Herefordian Floods, farre distant though they bee: For great men, as we find, a great way off can see. First, Frome with forhead cleare, by Bromyard that doth glide; And taking Loden in, their mixed streames doe guide, To meet their Soveraigne Lug, from the Radnorian Plaine At Prestayn comming in; where hee doth entertaine The Wadell, as along he under Derfold goes: Her full and lustie side to whom the Forrest showes, As to allure faire Lug, aboad with her to make. Lug little Oney first, then Arro in doth take, At Lemster, for her Wooll whose Staple doth excell, And seemes to over-match the golden Phrygian Fell. Had this our Colchos been unto the Ancients knowne, When Honor was her selfe, and in her glorie showne, He then that did commaund the Infantry of Greece, Had onely to our Ile adventur'd for this Fleece. Where lives the man so dull, on Britains furthest shore, The excellencie of Lemster wooll. To whom did never sound the name of Lemster Ore? That with the Silke-wormes web for smalness doth compare: Wherein, the Winder showes his workmanship so rare As doth the Fleece excell, and mocks her looser clew; As neatlie bottom'd up as Nature forth it drew; Of each in high'st accompt, and reckoned here as fine, As there th'Appulian fleece, or dainty Tarentyne. From thence his lovely selfe for Wye he doth dispose, To view the goodly flockes on each hand as he goes; And makes his journey short, with strange and sundry tales, Of all their wondrous things; and, not the least, of Wales; Of that prodigious Spring (him neighbouring as he past) That little Fishes bones continually doth cast. Whose reason whil'st he seekes industriously to knowe, A great way he hath gon, and Hereford doth showe Her rising Spires aloft; when as the Princely Wye, Him from his Muse to wake, arrests him by and by. Whose meeting to behold, with how well ordered grace Each other entertaines, how kindly they embrace; For joy, so great a shout the bordering Citie sent, That with the sound thereof, which thorough Haywood went, The Wood-Nymphs did awake that in the Forest won; To know the sudden cause, and presently they ron With lockes uncomb'd, for haste the lovely Wye to see (The floud that grac't her most) this day should married be To that more lovely Lug; a River of much fame, That in her wandering bankes should lose his glorious name. For Hereford, although her Wye she hold so deere, Yet Lug (whose longer course doth grace the goodly Sheere, And with his plentious Streame so many Brookes doth bring) Of all hers that be North is absolutely King. But Marcely, griev'd that he (the neerest of the rest, And of the Mountaine kind) not bidden was a guest Unto this nuptiall Feast, so hardly it doth take, As (meaning for the same his station to forsake) Inrag'd and mad with griefe, himselfe in two did rive; The Trees and Hedges neere, before him up doth drive, And dropping headlong downe, three dayes together fall: Which, bellowing as he went, the Rockes did so appall, That they him passage made, who Coats and Chappels crusht: So violently he into his Valley rusht. But Wye (from her deare Lug whom nothing can restraine, In many a pleasant shade, her joy to entertaine) To Rosse her course directs; and right her Wye or Gwy, so called (in the British) of her sinuosity, or turning. name to showe, Oft windeth in her way, as backe she meant to goe. Meander, who is said so intricate to bee, Hath not so many turnes, nor crankling nookes as shee. The Herefordian fields when welneare having past, As she is going forth, two sister Brookes at last That Soile her kindly sends, to guide her on her way; Neat Gamar, that gets in swift Garran: which do lay Their waters in one Banke, augmenting of her traine, To grace the goodlie Wye, as she doth passe by Deane. Beyond whose equall Spring unto the West doth lie The goodly Golden Vale, whose lushious sents do flie More free then Hyblas sweets; and twixt her bordering hils, The aire with such delights and delicacie fils, As makes it loth to stirre, or thence those smels to beare. Th'Hesperides scarce had such pleasures as be there: Which sometime to attaine, that mighty sonne of Jove One of his Labors made, and with the Dragon strove, That never clos'd his eies, the golden fruit to guard; As if t'enrich this place, from others, Nature spar'd: Banks crown'd with curled Groves, from cold to keepe the Plaine, Fields batfull, flowrie Meades, in state them to maintaine; Floods, to make fat those Meades, from Marble veines that spout, To shew, the wealth within doth answer that without. So brave a Nymph she is, in every thing so rare, As to sit down by her, she thinkes there's none should dare. And forth she sends the Doire, upon the Wye to wait. Whom Munno by the way more kindly doth intreat (For Eskle, her most lov'd, and Olcons onely sake) With her to go along, till Wye she overtake. To whom she condiscends, from danger her to shield, That th'Monumethian parts from th'Herefordian field. Which manly Malvern sees from furthest of the Sheere, On the Wigornian waste when Northward looking neere, On Corswood casts his eie, and on his Malvern Chase. home-born Chase, Then constantly beholds, with an unusuall pase Team with her tribute come unto the Severne. Cambrian Queene, Neere whom in all this place a River's scarcely seene, That dare avouch her name; Teame scorning any Spring But what with her along from Shropshire she doth bring, Except one namelesse Streame that Malvern sends her in, And Laughern though but small: when they such grace that win, There thrust in with the Brookes inclosed in her Banke. Teame lastly thither com'n with water is so ranke, As though she would contend with Sabryne, and doth crave Of place (by her desert) precedencie to have: Till chancing to behold the others godlike grace, So strongly is surpris'd with beauties in her face By no meanes she could hold, but needsly she must showe Her liking; and her selfe doth into Sabrine throwe. Not farre from him againe when Malvern doth perceave Two hils, which though their heads so high they doe not heave, Yet duly do observe great Malvern, and affoord Him reverence: who againe, as fits a gratious Lord, Upon his Subjects looks, and equall praise doth give That Woodberry so nigh and neighbourlie doth live With Abberley his friend, deserving well such fame That Saxton in his Maps forgot them not to name: Which, though in their meane types small matter doth appeare, Yet both of good account are reckned in the Shiere, And highly grac't of Teame in his proud passing by. When soone the goodlie Wyre, that wonted was so hie Her statelie top to reare, ashamed to behold Her straight and goodlie Woods unto the Fornace sold (And looking on her selfe, by her decay doth see The miserie wherein her sister Forrests bee) A Fable in Ovids Metamor.Of Erisicthons end begins her to bethinke, And of his cruell plagues doth wish they all might drinke That thus have them dispoil'd: then of her owne despight; That shee, in whom her Towne faire Beudley tooke delight, And from her goodlie seat conceiv'd so great a pride, In Severne on her East, Wyre on the setting side, So naked left of woods, of pleasure, and forlorne, As she that lov'd her most, her now the most doth scorne; With endlesse griefe perplext, her stubborne breast shee strake, And to the deafened ayre thus passionately spake; You Driades, that are said with Oakes to live and die, Wherefore in our distresse doe you our dwellings flie; Upon this monstrous Age and not revenge our wrong? For cutting downe an Oake that justlie did belong To one of Ceres Nymphes, in Thessaly that grew In the Dodonean Grove (O Nymphes!) you could pursue The sonne of Perops then, and did the Goddesse stirre That villanie to wreake the Tyrant did to her: Who, with a dreadfull frowne did blast the growing Graine: And having from him reft what should his life maintaine, Shee unto Scythia sent, for Hunger, him to gnawe, And thrust her downe his throat, into his stanchlesse mawe: Who, when nor Sea nor Land for him sufficient were, With his devouring teeth his wretched flesh did teare. This did you for one Tree: but of whole Forrests they That in these impious times have been the vile decay (Whom I may justlie call their Countries deadly foes) Gainst them you move no Power, their spoyle unpunisht goes. How manie grieved soules in future time shall starve, For that which they have rapt their beastlie lust to serve! Wee, sometime that the state of famous Britaine were, For whom she was renown'd in Kingdoms farre and neere, Are ransackt; and our Trees so hackt above the ground, That where their loftie tops their neighboring Countries crown'd, Their Trunkes (like aged folkes) now bare and naked stand, As for revenge to heaven each held a withered hand: And where the goodly Heards of high-palm'd Harts did gaze Upon the passer by, there now doth onely graze The gall'd-backe carrion Jade, and hurtfull Swine do spoile Once to the Sylvan Powers our consecrated soile. This uttered she with griefe: and more she would have spoke: When the Salopian floods her of her purpose broke, And silence did enjoyne; a listning eare to lend To Severne, which was thought did mighty things intend. The eight Song. The Argument. The goodly Severne bravely sings The noblest of her British Kings; At Cæsars landing what we were, And of the Roman Conquests here: Then shewes, to her deare Britans fame, How quicklie christned they became; And of their constancie doth boast, In sundry fortunes strangely tost: Then doth the Saxons landing tell, And how by them the Britans fell; Cheeres the Salopian Mountaines hie, That on the west of Severne lie; Calls downe each Riveret from her Spring, Their Queene upon her way to bring; Whom downe to Bruge the Muse attends: Where, leaving her, this Song shee ends. To Salop when her selfe cleere Sabrine comes to showe, And wisely her bethinks the way shee had to goe, South-west-ward casts her course; &amp; with an amorous eye Those Countries whence shee came, survayeth (passing by) Those Lands in Ancient times old Cambria claym'd her due, For refuge when to her th'oppressed Britans flew; By England now usurp't, who (past the wonted Meeres, Her sure and soveraigne banks) had taken sundry Sheeres, Which shee her Marches made: whereby those Hills of fame And Rivers stood disgrac't; accounting it their shame, That all without that Mound which Mercian Offa cast To runne from North to South, athwart the Cambrian wast, Could England not suffice, but that the stragling Wye, Which in the hart of Wales was some-time said to lye, Now onely for her bound proud England did prefer. That Severne, when shee sees the wrong thus offred her, Though by injurious Time deprived of that place Which anciently shee held: yet loth that her disgrace Should on the Britans light, the Hills and Rivers neere Austerely to her calls, commaunding them to heare In her deere childrens right (their Ancesters of yore, Now thrust betwixt her selfe, and the Virgivian shore, Who drave the Giants hence that of the Earth were bred, And of the spacious Ile became the soveraigne head) What from autentique bookes shee liberally could say. Of which whilst shee bethought her; West-ward every way, The Mountaines, Floods, and Meeres, to silence them betake: When Severne lowting lowe, thus gravely them bespake; How mightie was that man, and honoured still to bee, That gave this Ile his name, and to his children three, Three Kingdoms in the same? which, time doth now denie, With his arrivall heere, and primer Monarchy. England. Loëgria, though thou canst thy Locrine easely lose, Yet Wales. Cambria, him, whom Fate her ancient Founder chose, In no wise will forgoe; nay, should Scotland. Albania leave Her Albanact for ayde, and to the Scythian cleave. And though remorselesse Rome, which first did us enthrall, As barbarous but esteem'd, and stickt not so to call; The ancient Britans yet a sceptred King obey'd Three hundred yeeres before Romes great foundation laid; And had a thousand yeeres an Empire strongly stood, Ere Cæsar to her shores here stemd the circling Flood; And long before, borne Armes against the barbarous Hun, Heere landing with intent the Ile to over-run: And following them in flight, their Generall Humber drownd In that great arme of Sea, by his great name renown'd; And her great Builders had, her Citties who did reare With Fanes unto her Gods, and Priests among idolatrous Gentiles. Flamins every where. Nor Troynovant alone a Citty long did stand; But after, soone againe by Ebranks powerfull hand Yorke lifts her Towers aloft: which scarcely finisht was, But as they, by those Kings; so by Rudhudibras, Kents first and famous Canterbury. Towne, with Winchester, arose: And other, others built, as they fit places chose. So Britaine to her praise, of all conditions brings; The warlike, as the wise. Of her courageous Kings, Brute Green-shield: to whose name we providence impute, Divinely to revive the Land's first Conqueror, Brute. So had she those were learn'd, endu'd with nobler parts: As, he from learned Greece, that (by the liberall Arts) To Stamford, in this Ile, seem'd Athens to transfer; Wise Bladud, of her Kings that great Philosopher; Who found our boyling Bathes; and in his knowledge hie, Disdaining humane paths, heere practised to flie. Of justly vexed Leire, and those who last did tug In worse then Civill warre, the Ferrex and Porrex. sonnes of Gorbodug (By whose unnaturall strife the Land so long was tost) I cannot stay to tell, nor shall my Britaine boast; But, of that man which did her Monarchy restore, Her first imperiall Crowne of gold that ever wore, And that most glorious type of soveraignty regain'd; Mulmutius: who this Land in such estate maintain'd As his great Bel-sire Brute from Albions heires it wonne. This Grand-child, great as he, those foure proud Streets begun That each way crosse this Ile, and bounds did them allow. Like priviledge he lent the Temple and the Plow: So studious was this Prince in his most forward zeale To the Celestiall power, and to the Publique weale. Bellinus he begot, who Dacia proud subdu'd; Belinus and Brennus. And Brennus, who abroad a worthier warre pursu'd, Asham'd of civill strife; at home heere leaving all: And with such goodly Youth, in Germany and Gaul As he had gather'd up, the Alpin Mountaines past, And bravely on the banks of fatall Allia chas't The Romans (that her streame distained with their gore) And through proud Rome, display'd his British Ensigne bore: There, ballancing his sword against her baser gold, The Senators for slaves hee in her Forum sold. At last, by power expell'd, yet proud of late successe, His forces then for Greece did instantly addresse; And marching with his men upon her fruitfull face, Made Macedon first stoope; then Thessaly, and Thrace; His souldiers there enricht with all Peonia's spoyle; And where to Greece he gave the last and deadliest foyle, In that most dreadfull fight, on that more dismall day, O'rthrew their utmost prowesse at sad Thermopylæ; And daring of her Gods, adventur'd to have tane Those sacred things enshrin'd in wise Apollo's Fane: To whom when thundring Heaven pronounc't her fearefulst word, Against the Delphian Power he shak't his irefull sword. As of the British blood, the native Cambri here (So of my Cambria call'd) those valiant Cymbri were (When Britaine with her brood so peopled had her seat, The soyle could not suffice, it daily grew so great) Of Denmarke who themselves did anciently possesse, And to that straitned poynt, that utmost Chersonesse, My Countries name bequeath'd; whence Cymbrica it tooke: Yet long were not compriz'd within that little nooke, But with those Almaine powers this people issued forth: And like some boystrous wind arising from the North, Came that unwieldie host; that, which way it did move, The very burthenous earth before it seem'd to shove, And onely meant to claime the Universe its owne. In this terrestriall Globe, as though some world unknowne, By pampred Natures store too prodigally fed (And surfetting there-with) her surcrease vomited, These roaming up and downe to seeke some setling roome, First like a Deluge fell upon Illyricum, And with his Roman powers Papyrius over-threw; Then, by great A great generall of those Northren Nations. Belus brought against those Legions, slew Their forces which in France Aurelius Scaurus led; And afterward againe, as bravely vanquished The Consulls Cæpio, and stout Manlius on the Plaine, Where Rhodanus was red with blood of Latines slaine. In greatnes next succeeds Belinus worthy sonne, Gurgustus: who soone left what his great Father wonne, To Guynteline his heire: whose Martia. Queene, beyond her kind, In her great husbands peace, to shew her upright mind, To wise Mulmutius lawes, her Martian first did frame: From which we ours derive, to her eternall fame. A certain Monster often issuing from the Sea, devoured diverse of the British people.So Britaine forth with these, that valiant Bastard brought, Morindus, Danius sonne, which with that Monster fought His subjects that devour'd; to shew himselfe againe Their Martyr, who by them selected was to raigne. So Britaine likewise boasts her Elidure the just, Who with his people was of such especiall trust, That (Archigallo falne into their generall hate, And by their powerfull hand depriv'd of kingly state) Unto the Regall Chayre they Elidure advanc't: But long he had not raign'd, ere happily it chanc't, In hunting of a Hart, that in the Forrest wild, The late deposed King, himselfe who had exil'd From all resort of men, just Elidure did meet; Who much unlike himselfe, at Elidurus feet, Him prostrating with teares, his tender breast so strooke, That he (the British rule who lately on him tooke At th'earnest peoples pray'rs) him calling to the Court, There Archigallo's wrongs so lively did report, Relating (in his right) his lamentable case, With so effectuall speech imploring their high grace, That him they reinthron'd; in peace who spent his dayes. Then Elidure againe, crown'd with applausive praise, As he a brother rais'd, by brothers was depos'd, And put into the Towre: where miserably inclos'd, Out-living yet their hate, and the Usurpers dead, Thrice had the British Crowne set on his reverend head. When more then thirty Kings in faire succession came Unto that mighty Lud, in whose eternall name Great London still shall live (by him rebuilded) while To Citties she remaines the Soveraigne of this Ile. And when commaunding Rome to Cæsar gave the charge, Her Empire (but too great) still further to enlarge With all beyond the Alpes; the aydes he found to passe From these parts into Gaul, shew'd heere some Nation was Undaunted that remain'd with Romes so dreadfull name, That durst presume to ayde those shee decreed to tame. Wherefore that matchlesse man, whose high ambition wrought Beyond her Empires bounds, by shipping wisely sought (Heere proling on the shores) this Iland to discry, What people her possest, how fashion'd shee did lie: Where scarce a Strangers foote defil'd her virgin breast, Since her first Conqueror Brute heere put his powers to rest; Onely some little Boats, from Gaul that did her feed With tryfles, which shee tooke for nicenesse more then need: But as another world, with all abundance blest, And satisfi'd with what shee in her selfe possest; Through her excessive wealth (at length) till wanton growne, Some Kings (with others Lands that would enlarge their owne) By innovating Armes an open passage made For him that gap't for all (the Roman) to invade. Yet with grim-visag'd Warre when he her shores did greet, And terriblest did threat with his amazing Fleet, Those British bloods he found, his force that durst assaile, And poured from the Cleeves their shafts like showers of haile Upon his helmed head; to tell him as he came, That they (from all the world) yet feared not his name: Which, their undaunted spirits soone made that Conqueror feele, Oft ventring their bare breasts gainst his oft-bloodied steele; And in their Chariots charg'd: which they with wondrous skill Could turne in their swift'st course upon the steepest hill, And wheele about his troopes for vantage of the ground, Or else disranke his force where entrance might be found: And from their Armed seats their thrilling Darts could throwe; Or nimblie leaping downe, their valiant swords bestowe, And with an active skip remount themselves againe, Leaving the Roman horse behind them on the Plaine, And beat him back to Gaul his forces to supply; As they the Gods of Rome and Cæsar did defie. Cassibalan renown'd, the Britans faithfull guide, Who when th'Italian powers could no way be deny'd, But would this Ile subdue; their forces to fore-lay, Thy Forrests thou didst fell, their speedy course to stay: Those armed stakes in Tames that stuckst, their horse to gore Which boldly durst attempt to forrage on thy shore: Thou such hard entrance heere to Cæsar didst allow, To whom (thy selfe except) the Westerne world did bow. And more then Cæsar got, three Emperours could not win, Till the courageous sonnes of our Cunobelin Sunke under Plautius sword, sent hither to discusse The former Roman right, by Armes againe, with us. Nor with that Consull joyn'd, Vespasian could prevaile In thirty severall fights, nor make them stoope their saile. Yea, had not his brave sonne, young Titus, past their hopes, His forward Father fetcht out of the British troopes, And quit him wondrous well when he was strongly charg'd, His Father (by his hands so valiantly enlarg'd) Had never more seene Rome; nor had he ever spilt The Temple that wise sonne of faithfull David built, Subverted those high walls, and lay'd that Cittie wast Which God, in humane flesh, above all other grac't. No marvaile then though Rome so great her conquest thought, In that the Ile of Wight shee to subjection brought, Our A people then inhabiting Hamp. Dorset. Wilt. and Somerset shires. Belgæ and subdu'd (a people of the West) That latest came to us, our least of all the rest; When Claudius, who that time her wreath imperiall wore, Though scarce he shew'd himselfe upon our Southerne shore, It scornd not in his stile; but, due to that his praise, Triumphall Arches claim'd, and to have yeerely Playes; The noblest Navall Crowne, upon his Palace pitcht; As with the Oceans spoyle his Rome who had enricht. Her Caradock (with cause) so Britaine may prefer; Then whom, a braver spirit was nere brought forth by her: For whilst here in the West the Britans gather'd head, This Generall of the rest, his stout Those of Monmouth, and the adjacent Shires. Silures led Against Ostorius, sent by Cæsar to this place With Romes high fortune (then the high'st in Fortunes grace) A long and doubtfull warre with whom he did maintaine, Untill that houre wherein his valiant Britans slaine Hee grievously beheld (o'represt with Roman power) Himselfe wel-nere the last their wrath did not devour. When (for revenge, not feare) he fled (as trusting most, Another day might win, what this had lately lost) To Cartismandua, Queene of Those of Yorkshire, and there by. Brigants for her ayde, He to his foes, by her, most falsely was betray'd. Who, as a spoyle of warre, t'adorne the Triumph sent To great Ostorius due, when through proud Rome hee went, That had her selfe prepar'd (as shee had all been eyes) Our Caradock to view; who in his Countries guise, Came with his bodie nak't, his haire downe to his waste, Girt with a chaine of steele; his manly breast in chaste With sundry shapes of Beasts. And when this Britaine saw His wife and children bound as slaves, it could not awe His manlinesse at all: but with a setled grace, Undaunted with her pride, hee lookt her in the face: And with a speech so grave as well a Prince became, Himselfe and his redeem'd, to our eternall fame. Then Romes great Nero. Tyrant next, the lasts adopted heire, That brave Suetonius sent, the British Coasts to cleere; The utter spoyle of Anglesey, the chiefe place of residence of the Druides. Mon who strongly did pursue (Unto whose gloomy strengths, th'revolted Britans flew) There entring, hee beheld what strooke him pale with dread: The frantick British Froes, their haire dishevelled, With fire-brands ran about, like to their furious eyes; And from the hollow woods the fearlesse Druides; Who with their direfull threats, and execrable vowes, Inforc't the troubled heaven to knit her angry browes. And as heere in the West the Romans bravely wan, So all upon the East the Britans over-ran: The Colony long kept at Mauldon, overthrowne, Which by prodigious signes was many times fore-showne, And often had dismai'd the Roman souldiers: when Brave Voadicia made with her resolved'st men To By Saint Albans. Virolam; whose siege with fire and sword she pli'd, Till leveld with the earth. To London as shee hy'd, The Consull comming in with his auspicious ayde, The Queene (to quit her yoke no longer that delay'd) Him dar'd by dint of sword, it hers or his to try, With words that courage show'd, and with a voice as hie (In her right hand her Launce, and in her left her Shield, As both the Battells stood prepared in the Field) Incouraging her men: which resolute, as strong, Upon the Roman rusht; and shee, the rest among, Wades in that doubtfull warre: till lastly, when she saw The fortune of the day unto the Roman draw, The Queene (t'out-live her friends who highly did disdaine, And lastly, for proud Rome a Triumph to remaine) By poyson ends her dayes, unto that end prepar'd, As lavishly to spend what Suetonius spar'd. Him scarcely Rome recall'd, such glory having wonne, But bravely to proceed, as erst she had begunne, Agricola heere made her great Lieutenant then: Who having setled Mon, that man of all her men, Appointed by the Powers apparantly to see The wearied Britans sinke, and easely in degree Beneath his fatall sword the North-wales men. Ordovies to fall Inhabiting the West, those people last of all Which stoutl'est him with-stood, renown'd for Martiall worth. Thence leading on his powers unto the utmost North, When all the Townes that lay betwixt our Trent and Tweed, Suffic'd not (by the way) his wasteful fires to feed, He there some Britans found, who (to rebate their spleene, As yet with grieved eyes our spoyles not having seene) Him at In the midst of Scotland. Mount Grampus met: which from his height beheld Them lavish of their lives; who could not be compeld The Roman yoke to beare: and Galgacus their guide Amongst his murthered troupes there resolutely di'd. Eight Roman Emperours raign'd since first that warre began; Great Julius Cæsar first, the last Domitian. A hundred thirtie yeeres the Northerne Britans still, That would in no wise stoupe to Romes imperious will, Into the straitned Land with theirs retired farre, In lawes and manners since from us that different are; And with the Irish Pict, which to their ayde they drew (On them oft breaking in, who long did them pursue) A greater foe to us in our owne bowels bred, Then Rome, with much expense that us had conquered. And when that we great Romes so much in time were growne, That shee her charge durst leave to Princes of our owne, (Such as, within our selves, our suffrage should elect) Aviragus, borne ours, heere first she did protect; Who faithfully and long, of labour did her ease. Then he, our Flamins seats who turn'd to Bishops seas; Great Lucius, that good King: to whom we chiefly owe This happinesse we have, Christ crucifi'd to knowe. As Britaine to her praise receiv'd the Christian faith, After (that Word-made Man) our deere Redeemers death Within two hundred yeeres; and his Disciples heere, By their great Maister sent to preach him every where, Most reverently receiv'd, their doctrine and preferd; Interring him, Joseph of Arimathea. who earst the Sonne of God interd. So Britans was she borne, though Italy her crown'd, Of all the Christian world that Empresse most renown'd, Constantius worthy wife; who scorning worldly losse, Her selfe in person went to seeke that sacred Crosse, Whereon our Saviour di'd: which found, as it was sought, From Jerusalem. Salem unto Rome triumphantly she brought. As when the Primer Church her Councells pleas'd to call, Great Britains Bishops there were not the least of all; Against the Arian Sect at Arles having roome, At Sardica againe, and at Ariminum. Now, when with various Fate five hundred yeeres had past, And Rome of her great charge grew weary heere at last; The Vandalls, Goths, and Huns, that with a powerfull head All Italy and France had wel-neare over-spred, To much-endanger'd Rome sufficient warning gave, Those forces that shee held, within her selfe to have. The Roman rule from us then utterly remov'd. Whilst, we, in sundry Fields, our sundry fortunes prov'd With the remorselesse Pict, still wasting us with warre. And twixt the froward Sire, licentious Vortiger, And his too forward sonne, young Vortimer, arose Much strife within our selves, whilst heere they interpose By turns each others raignes; whereby, we weakned grew. The warlike Saxon then into the Land we drew; A Nation nurst in spoyle, and fitt'st to undergoe Our cause against the Pict, our most inveterate foe. When they, which we had hyr'd for souldiers to the shore, Perceiv'd the wealthy Ile to wallow in her store, And suttly had found out how we infeebled were; They, under false pretence of amitie and cheere, The British Peeres invite, the German Healths to view At Stonehenge; where they them unmercifully slew. Then, those of Brutes great blood, of Armorick possest, Extreamly griev'd to see their kinsmen so distrest, Us offred to relieve, or else with us to die: Wee, after, to requite their noble curtesie, Eleven thousand mayds sent those our friends againe, In wedlock to be linkt with them of Brute's high Straine; That none with Brutes great blood, but Britans might be mixt: Such friendship ever was the stock of Troy betwixt. Out of whose ancient race, that warlike Arthur sprong: Whose most renowned Acts shall sounded be as long As Britains name is known: which spred themselves so wide, As scarcely hath for fame left any roomth beside. My Wales, then hold thine owne, and let thy Britains stand Upon their right, to be the noblest of the Land. Thinke how much better tis, for thee, and those of thine, From Gods, and Heroës old to drawe your famous line, Then from the Scythian poore; whence they themselves derive Whose multitudes did first you to the Mountaines drive. Nor let the spacious Mound of that great Mercian King (Into a lesser roomth thy burlinesse to bring) Include thee; when my Selfe, and my deere brother Dee, The ancient bounds of Wales. By nature were the bounds first limited to thee. Scarce ended shee her speech, but those great Mountaines neere, Upon the Cambrian part that all for Brutus were, With her high truths inflam'd, look't every one about To find their severall Springs; and bad them get them out, And in their fulness waite upon their soveraigne Flood, In Britains ancient right so bravely that had stood. When first the furious Teame, that on the Cambrian side Doth Shropshire as a Meere from Hereford divide, As worthiest of the rest; so worthily doth crave That of those lesser Brooks the leading she might have; The first of which is Clun, that to her Mistris came: Which of a Clun Forrest. Forrest borne that beares her proper name, Unto the Golden Vale and anciently ally'd, Of every thing of both, sufficiently supply'd, The longer that she growes, the more renowne doth win: And for her greater State, next Bradfield bringeth in, Which to her wider banks resignes a weaker streame. When fiercely making forth, the strong and lustie Teame A friendly Forest Nymph (nam'd Mocktry) doth imbrace, Her selfe that bravely beares; twixt whom and Bringwood-Chase, Her banks with many a wreath are curiously bedeckt, And in their safer shades they long time her protect. Then takes shee Oney in, and forth from them doth fling: When to her further ayde, next Bowe, and Warren, bring Cleere Quenny; by the way, which Stradbrooke up doth take: By whose united powers, their Teame they mightier make; Which in her lively course to Ludlowe comes at last, Where Corve into her streame her selfe doth head-long cast. With due attendance next, comes Ledwich and the Rhea. Then speeding her, as though sent post unto the Sea, Her native Shropshire leaves, and bids those Townes adiew, Her onely soveraigne Queene, proud Severne to pursue. When at her going out, those Mountaines of command (The Clees, like loving Twinnes, and Stitterston that stand) Trans-Severned, behold faire England tow'rds the rise, And on their setting side, how ancient Cambria lies. Then Stipperston a hill, though not of such renowne As many that are set heere tow'rds the going downe, To those his owne Allyes, that stood not farre away, Thus in behalfe of Wales directly seem'd to say; Deare Corndon, my delight, as thou art lov'd of mee, And Breeden, as thou hop'st a Britaine thought to bee, To Cortock strongly cleave, as to our ancient friend, And all our utmost strength to Cambria let us lend. For though that envious Time injuriously have wroong From us those proper names did first to us belong, Yet for our Country still, stout Mountaines let us stand. Here, every neighbouring Hill held up a willing hand, As freely to applaud what Stipperston decreed: And Hockstow when she heard the Mountaines thus proceed, With ecchoes from her Woods, her inward joyes exprest, To heare that Hill she lov'd, which likewise lov'd her best, Should in the right of Wales, his neighbouring Mountaines stirre, So to advance that place which might them both preferre; That she from open shouts could scarce her selfe refraine. When soone those other Rils to Severne which retaine, And 't ended not on Teame, thus of themselves do showe The service that to her they absolutely owe. First Camlet commeth in, a Mountgomerian mayde, Her source in Severns bankes that safely having layd, Mele, her great Mistris next at Shrewsbury doth meet, To see with what a grace she that faire towne doth greet; Into what sundry gyres her wondered selfe she throwes, And oft in-Iles the shore, as wantonly she flowes; Of it, oft taking leave, oft turnes, it to imbrace; As though she onely were enamored of that place, Her fore-intended course determined to leave, And to that most lov'd Towne eternally to cleave: With much ado at length, yet bidding it adue, Her journey towards the Sea doth seriously pursue. Where, as along the shores she prosperously doth sweepe, Small Marbrooke maketh-in, to her inticing Deepe. And as she lends her eye to Bruge-North. Bruge's loftie sight, That Forest-Nymph milde Morffe doth kindly her invite To see within her shade what pastime she could make: Where she, of Shropshire; I my leave of Severne take. The ninth Song. The Argument. The Muse heere Merioneth vaunts, And her proud Mountaines highly chaunts. The Hills and Brooks, to bravery bent, Stand for precedence from Descent: The Rivers for them shewing there The wonders of their Pimblemere. Proud Snowdon gloriously proceeds With Cambria's native Princes deeds. The Muse then through Carnarvan makes, And Mon (now Anglesey) awakes To tell her ancient Druides guise, And manner of their Sacrifice. Her Rillets shee together calls; Then back for Flint and Denbigh falls. Of all the Cambrian Shires their heads that beare so hie, And farth'st survay their soyles with an ambitious eye, Mervinia Merionethshire. for her Hills, as for their matchlesse crowds, The neerest that are said to kisse the wandring clowds, Especiall Audience craves, offended with the throng, That shee of all the rest neglected was so long: Alleaging for her selfe; When through the Saxons pride, The God-like race of Brute to Severns setting side Were cruelly inforc't, her Mountaines did relieve Those, whom devouring warre else every-where did grieve. And when all Wales beside (by Fortune or by might) Unto her ancient foe resign'd her ancient right, A constant Mayden still shee onely did remaine, The last her genuine lawes which stoutly did retaine. And as each one is prays'd for her peculiar things; So onely shee is rich, in Mountaines, Meres, and Springs, And holds her selfe as great in her superfluous wast, As others by their Townes, and fruitfull tillage grac't. And therefore, to recount her Rivers, from their Meeres or Pooles, from whence Rivers spring. Lins, Abbridging all delayes, Mervinia thus begins; Though Dovy, which doth far her neighboring Floods surmount (Whose course, for hers alone Mountgomery doth account) The Rivers as in order they fall into the Irish Sea.Hath Angell for her owne, and Keriog she doth cleere, With Towin, Gwedall then, and Dulas, all as deere, Those tributary streames she is maintain'd withall: Yet, boldly may I say, her rising and her fall My Country calleth hers, with many another Brooke, That with their crystall eyes on the Vergivian looke. To Dovy next, of which Desunny sea-ward drives, Lingorrill goes alone: but plentious Avon strives The first to be at Sea; and faster her to hie, Cleere Kessilgum comes in, with Hergum by and by. So Derry, Moothy drawes, and Moothy calleth Caine, Which in one channell meet, in going to the Maine, As to their utmost power to lend her all their aydes: So Atro by the arme Lanbeder kindly leads. And Velenrid the like, observing th'others lawe, Calls Cunnell; shee againe, faire Drurid forth doth draw, That from their mother Earth, the rough Mervinia, pay Their mixed plentious Springs, unto the lesser Bay Of those two noble armes into the Land that beare, Which through North-wales. Gwinethia be so famous every where, On my Carnarvan side by nature made my Mound, As Dovy doth divide the Cardiganian ground. The pearly Conwayes head, as that of holy Dee, Renowned Rivers both, their rising have in mee: So, Lavern and the Lue, themselves that head-long throwe Into the spacious Lake, where Dee unmixt doth flowe. Trowerrin takes his streame, here from a native Lin; Which, out of Pimblemere when Dee him selfe doth win, Along with him his Lord full curteously doth glide: So Rudock riseth heere, and Cletor that doe guide Him in his rugged path, and make his greatnes way, Their Dee into the bounds of Denbigh to convay. The loftie Hills, this while attentively that stood, As to survey the course of every severall Flood, Sent forth such ecchoing shoutes (which every way so shrill, With the reverberate sound the spacious ayre did fill) That they were easely heard through the Vergivian Maine To Neptunes inward Court; and beating there, constraine That mightie God of Sea t'awake: who full of dread, Thrice threw his three-forkt Mace about his griesly head, And thrice above the Rocks his fore-head rays'd to see Amongst the high-topt Hills what tumult it should bee. So that with very sweat Cadoridric did drop, And mighty Raran shooke his proud sky-kissing top, Amongst the furious rout whom madnes did enrage; Untill the Mountaine Nymphs, the tumult to asswage, Upon a modest signe of silence to the throng, Consorting thus, in prayse of their Mervinia, song; Thrice famous Saxon King, on whom Time nere shall pray, O Edgar! who compeldst our Ludwall hence to pay Three hundred Wolves a yeere for trybute unto thee: And for that tribute payd, as famous may'st thou bee, O conquer'd British King, by whom was first destroy'd The multitude of Wolves, that long this Land annoy'd; Regardlesse of their rape, that now our harmlesse Flocks, Securely heere may sit upon the aged Rocks; Or wandring from their walks, and straggling here and there Amongst the scattred Cleeves, the Lambe needs never feare; But from the threatning storme to save it selfe may creepe Into that darksome Cave where once his foe did keepe: That now the clambring Goat all day which having fed, And clyming up to see the sunne goe downe to bed, Is not at all in doubt her little Kid to lose, Which grazing in the Vale, secure and safe she knowes. Where, from these lofty hills which spacious heaven doe threat, The wondrous Mountaines in Merionethshire. Yet of as equall height, as thick by nature set, We talke how wee are stor'd, or what wee greatly need, Or how our flocks doe fare, and how our heards doe feed, When else the hanging Rocks, and Vallyes dark and deepe, The Sommers longest day would us from meeting keepe. Yee Cambrian Shepheards then, whom these our Mountaines please, And yee our fellow Nymphs, yee light Nymphs of the Mountains. Oreades, Saint Hellens wondrous way, and Herberts let us goe, And our divided Rocks with admiration showe. Not meaning there to end, but speaking as they were, A suddaine fearefull noyse surprised every eare. The water-Nymphs (not farre) Lin-Teged that frequent, With browes besmear'd with ooze, their locks with dewe besprent, Inhabiting the Lake, in sedgy bowres belowe, Their inward grounded griefe that onely sought to showe Against the Mountaine kind, which much on them did take Above their watry brood, thus proudly them bespake; Tell us, ye haughtie Hills, why vainly thus you threat, Esteeming us so meane, compar'd to you so great. To make you know your selves, you this must understand, That our great Maker layd the surface of the Land, As levell as the Lake untill the generall Flood, When over all so long the troubled waters stood: Which, hurried with the blasts from angry heaven that blew, Upon huge massy heapes the loosened gravell threw: From hence we would yee knew, your first beginning came. Which, since, in tract of time, your selves did Mountaines name. So that the earth, by you (to check her mirthfull cheere) May alwaies see (from heaven) those plagues that poured were Upon the former world; as t'were by scarres to showe That still shee must remaine disfigur'd with the blowe: And by th'infectious slime that doomefull Deluge left, Nature herselfe hath since of puritie beene reft; And by the seeds corrupt, the life of mortall man Was shortned. With these plagues yee Mountaines first began. But, ceasing you to shame; What Mountaine is there found In all your monstrous kind (seeke yee the Iland round) That truly of him selfe such wonders can report The wonders of Lin-teged, or Pemblemere.As can this spacious Lin, the place of our resort? That when Dee in his course faine in her lap would lie, Commixtion with her store, his streame shee doth deny, By his complexion prov'd, as he through her doth glide. Her wealth againe from his, she likewise doth divide: Those White-fish that in her doe wondrously abound, Are never seene in him; nor are his Salmons found At any time in her: but as shee him disdaines; So hee againe, from her, as wilfully abstaines. Downe from the neighboring Hills, those plentious Springs that fall, Nor Land-floods after raine, her never move at all. And as in Sommers heat, so alwaies is she one, Resembling that great Lake which seemes to care for none: And with sterne Eolus blasts, like Thetis waxing ranke, Shee onely over-swells the surface of her bank. But, whilst the Nymphs report these wonders of their Lake, Their further cause of speech the mightie The most famous Mountaine of all Wales, in Carnarvanshire. Snowdon brake; Least, if their watry kind should suffred be too long, The licence that they tooke, might doe the Mountaines wrong. For quickly he had found that straitned poynt of Land, Into the Irish Sea which puts his powrefull hand, Puft with their watry praise, grew insolently proud, And needs would have his Rills for Rivers be allow'd: Short Darent, neer'st unto the utmost poynt of all That th'Ile of Gelin greets, and Bardsey in her fall; And next to her, the Sawe, the Gir, the Er, the May, Must Rivers be at least, should all the world gaine-say: And those, whereas the Land lyes East-ward, amply wide, That goodly Conway grace upon the other side, Borne neere upon her banks, each from her proper Lin, Soone from their Mothers out, soone with their Mistris in. As Ledder, her Allie, and neighbour Legwy; then Goes Purloyd, Castell next, with Giffin, that agen Observe faire Conway's course: and though their race be short, Yet they their Soveraigne Flood inrich with their resort. And Snowdon, more then this, his proper Mere did note The wonders upon the Snowdon. (Still Delos like, wherein a wandring Ile doth floate) Was peremptory growne upon his higher ground; That Poole, in which (besides) the one-eyed fish are found, As of her wonder proud, did with the Floods partake. So, when great Snowdon saw, a Faction they would make Against his generall kind; both parties to appease, Hee purposeth to sing their native Princes praise. For Snowdony, a Hill, imperiall in his seat, The glory of Snowdon-hill. Is from his mighty foote, unto his head so great, That were his Wales distrest, or of his helpe had need, Hee all her Flocks and Heards for many months could feed. Therefore to doe some-thing were worthy of his name, Both tending to his strength, and to the Britans fame, His Country to content, a signall having made, By this Oration thinks both Parties to perswade: Whilst heere this generall Ile, the ancient Britans ow'd, Their valiant deeds before by Severn have been show'd: But, since our furious Foe, these powrefull Saxon swarmes (As mercilesse in spoyle, as well approv'd in Armes) Heere called to our ayde, Loëgria us bereft, Those poore and scatter'd few of Brutes high linage left, For succour hither came; where that unmixed race Remaines unto this day, yet owners of this place: Of whom no Flood nor Hill peculiarly hath song. These, then, shall be my Theame: least Time too much should wrong Such Princes as were ours, since sever'd we have been; And as themselves, their fame be limited between The Severne and our Sea, long pent within this place, Till with the tearme of Welsh, the English now embase The nobler Britains name, that welneere was destroy'd With Pestilence and Warre, which this great Ile annoy'd; Cadwallader that drave to the Armorick shore: To which, drad Conan, Lord of Denbigh, long before, His Countrymen from hence auspiciously convay'd: Whose noble feates in warre, and never-fayling ay'd, Got Maximus (at length) the victorie in Gaul, Upon the Roman powers. Where, after Gratians fall, Armorica to them the valiant Victor gave: Where Conan, their great Lord, as full of courage, drave The Celts out of their seats, and did their roome supply With people still from hence; which of our Colony Was little Britaine call'd. Where that distressed King, Cadwallader, himselfe awhile recomforting With hope of Alans ayde (which there did him detaine) Forewarned was in Dreames, that of the Britans raigne A sempiternall end the angry Powers decreed, A Recluse life in Rome injoyning him to lead. The King resigning all, his sonne young Edwall left With Alan: who, much griev'd the Prince should be bereft Of Britains ancient right, rigg'd his unconquer'd Fleet; And as the Generalls then, for such an Army meet, His Nephew Ivor chose, and Hiner for his pheere; Two most undaunted spirits. These valiant Britans were The first who The West-Saxons country, comprehending Devonshire, Somerset, Wiltshire, and their adjacents. West-sex wonne. But by the ling'ring warre, When they those Saxons found t'have succour still from farre, They tooke them to their friends on Severns setting shore: Where finding Edwall dead, they purpos'd to restore His sonne young Rodorick, whom the Saxon powers pursu'd: But hee, who at his home heere scorn'd to be subdu'd, With Aldred (that on Wales his strong invasion brought) Garthmalack, and Pencoyd (those famous battailes) fought, That North and South-wales sing, on the West-Sexians wonne. Scarce this victorious taske his bloodied sword had done, But at Mount A hill neere Aber-gevenny in Monmouth. Carno met the Mercians, and with wounds Made Ethelbald to feele his trespasse on our bounds; Prevail'd against the Pict, before our force that flew; And in a valiant fight their King Dalargan slew. Nor Conan's courage lesse, nor lesse prevail'd in ought Renowned Rodoricks heire, who with the English fought The Herefordian Field; as Ruthlands red with gore: Who, to transfer the warre from this his native shore, Marcht through the Mercian Townes with his revengefull blade; And on the English there such mighty havock made, That Offa (when he saw his Countries goe to wrack) From bick'ring with his folke, to keepe us Britains back, Cast up that mighty Mound of eighty miles in length, Offa's Ditch. Athwart from Sea to Sea. Which of the Mercians strength A witnesse though it stand, and Offa's name doe beare, Our courage was the cause why first he cut it there: As that most dreadful day at Gavelford can tell, Where under eithers sword so many thousands fell With intermixed blood, that neither knew their owne; Nor which went Victor thence, unto this day is knowne. Nor Kettles conflict then, lesse martiall courage show'd, Where valiant Mervin met the Mercians, and bestow'd His nobler British blood on Burthreds recreant flight. As Rodorick his great sonne, his father following right, Bare not the Saxons scornes, his Britans to out-brave; At Gwythen, but againe to Burthred battell gave; Twice driving out the Dane when he invasion brought. Whose no lesse valiant sonne, againe at Conway fought With Danes and Mercians mixt, and on their hatefull head Down-showr'd their dire revenge whom they had murthered. And, wer't not that of us the English would report (Abusing of our Tongue in most malicious sort As often-times they doe) that more then any, wee (The Welsh, as they us tearme) love glorifi'd to bee, Heere could I else recount the slaught'red Saxons gore Our swords at Crosford spilt on Severns wandring shore; And Griffith here produce, Lewellins valiant sonne (May wee believe our Bards) who five pitcht Battels wonne; And to revenge the wrongs the envious English wrought, His well-train'd martiall troupes into the Marches brought As farre as Wor'ster walls: nor thence did he retire, Till Powse lay wel-neere spent in our revengefull fire; As Hereford layd waste: and from their plentious soyles, Brought back with him to Wales his prisoners and his spoyles. Thus as we valiant were, when valour might us steed: With those so much that dar'd, wee had them that decreed. For, what Mulmutian lawes, or Martian, ever were More excellent then those which our good Howell heere Ordayn'd to governe Wales? which still with us remaine. And when all-powerfull Fate had brought to passe againe, That as the Saxons earst did from the Britains win; Upon them so (at last) the Normans comming in, Tooke from those Tyrants heere, what treacherously they got (To the perfidious French, which th'angry heavens allot) Nere could that Conquerors sword (which roughly did decide His right in England heere, and prostrated her pride) Us to subjection stoope, or make us Britains beare Th'unwieldy Norman yoke: nor basely could we feare His Conquest, entring Wales; but (with stout courage) ours Defi'd him to his face, with all his English powers. And when in his revenge, proud Rufus hither came (With vowes) us to subvert; with slaughter and with shame, O're Severn him we sent, to gather stronger ayde. So, when to Englands power, Albania hers had lay'd, By Henry Beauclarke brought (for all his divelish wit, By which he raught the Wreath) hee not prevail'd awhit: And through our rugged straits when he so rudely prest, Had not his proved Maile sate surely to his breast, A skilfull British hand his life had him bereft, As his sterne brothers hart, by Tirrills hand was cleft. And let the English thus which vilifie our name, If it their greatnes please, report unto our shame The foyle our Gwyneth gave at Flints so deadly fight, To Maud the Empresse sonne, that there he put to flight; And from the English power th'imperiall Ensigne tooke: About his plumed head which valiant Owen shooke. As when that King againe, his fortune to advance Above his former foyle, procur'd fresh powers from France, A surely-leveld shaft if Sent-cleare had not seene, And in the very loose, not thrust himselfe betweene His Soveraigne and the shaft, he our revenge had tri'd: Thus, to preserve the King, the noble subject dy'd. As Madock his brave sonne, may come the rest among; Who, like the God-like race from which his Grandsires sprong, Whilst heere his Brothers tyr'd in sad domestick strife, On their unnaturall breasts bent eithers murtherous knife; This brave adventurous Youth, in hote pursute of fame, With such as his great spirit did with high deeds inflame, Put forth his well-rigg'd Fleet to seeke him forraine ground, And sayled West so long, untill that world he found To Christians then unknowne (save this adventrous crue) Long ere Columbus liv'd, or it Vesputius knew; And put the now-nam'd Welsh on India's parched face, Unto the endlesse praise of Brutes renowned race, Ere the Iberian Powers had toucht her long-sought Bay, Or any eare had heard the sound of Florida. And with that Croggens name let th'English us disgrace; When there are to be seene, yet, in that ancient place From whence that name they fetch, their conquer'd Grandsires Graves: For which each ignorant sot, unjustly us depraves. And when that Tyrant John had our subversion vow'd, To his unbridled will our necks we never bow'd: Nor to his mightie sonne; whose host wee did inforce (His succours cutting off) to eate their war-like horse. Untill all-ruling Heaven would have us to resigne: When that brave Prince, the last of all the British Line, Lewellin, Griffiths sonne, unluckily was slaine, As Fate had spar'd our fall till Edward Longshanks raigne. Yet to the stock of Brute so true wee ever were, We would permit no Prince, unlesse a native here. Which, that most prudent King perceiving, wisely thought To satisfie our wills, and to Carnarvan brought His Queene be'ing great with child, even ready downe to lie; Then to his purpos'd end doth all his powers apply. Through every part of Wales hee to the Nobles sent, That they unto his Court should come incontinent, Of things that much concern'd the Country to debate: But now behold the power of unavoyded Fate. When thus unto his will he fitly them had wonne, At her expected houre the Queene brought forth a sonne. And to this great designe, all hapning as he would, He (his intended course that clearkly manage could) Thus queintly traines us on: Since he perceiv'd us prone Here onely to be rul'd by Princes of our owne, A King both valiant and politique.Our naturalnes therein he greatly did approve; And publiquely protests, that for the ancient love He ever bare to Wales, they all should plainly see, That he had found out one, their soveraigne Lord to bee; Com'n of the race of Kings, and (in their Country borne) Could not one English word: of which he durst be sworne. Besides, his upright heart, and innocence was such, As that (he was assur'd) blacke Envie could not tuch His spotlesse life in ought. Poore we (that not espie His subtilty herein) in plaine simplicity, Soone bound our selves by oath, his choice not to refuse: When as that craftie King, his little childe doth chuse, Yong Edward, borne in Wales, and of Carnarvan call'd. Thus by the English craft, we Britans were enthrall'd: Yet in thine owne behalfe, deare Country dare to say, Thou long as powerfull wert as England every way. And if she overmuch should seeke thee to imbase, Tell her thou art the Nurse of all the British race; And he that was by heaven appointed to unite (After that tedious warre) the red Rose and the white, A Tudor was of thine, and native of thy Mon, From whom descends that King now sitting on her Throane. This speech, by Snowdon made, so luckie was to please Both parties, and them both with such content t'appease; That as before they strove for soveraignty and place, They onely now contend, which most should other grace. Into the Irish Sea, then all those Rilles that ronne, In Snowdons praise to speake, immediatly begon; Lewenny, Lynan next, then Gwelly gave it out, And Kerriog her compeere, soone told it all about: So did their sister Nymphs, that into Mena straine; The flood that doth divide Mon from the Cambrian Maine. It Gorway greatly prais'd, and Seint it lowdly song. So, mighty Snowdons speech was through Carnarvan rong; That scarcely such a noise to Mon from Mena came, When with his puissant troupes for conquest of the same, On Bridges made of Boates, the Roman powers her sought, Or Edward to her sacke his English Armies brought: That Mona strangely stird great Snowdons praise to heare, Although the stock of Troy to her was ever deare; Yet (from her proper worth) as shee before all other Was call'd (in former times) her Country Cambria's mother, Perswaded was thereby her praises to pursue, Or by neglect, to lose what to her selfe was due, A signe to Neptune sent, his boystrous rage to slake; Which suddainly becalm'd, thus of her selfe she spake; What one of all the Iles to Cambria doth belong (To Britaine, I might say, and yet not doe her wrong) Doth equall me in soyle, so good for grasse and graine? As should my Wales (where still Brutes ofspring doth remaine) That mighty store of men, yet more of beasts doth breed, By famine or by warre constrained be to need, And Englands neighboring Shires their succour would denie; My onely selfe her wants could plentiously supply. What Iland is there found upon the Irish coast, In which that Kingdome seemes to be delighted most (And seeke you all along the rough Vergivian shore, Where the incountring tydes outrageously doe rore) That bowes not at my beck, as they to me did owe The dutie subjects should unto their Soveraigne showe; So that th'Eubonian Man, a kingdome long time knowne, Which wisely hath been rul'd by Princes of her owne, In my alliance joyes, as in th'Albanian Seas The Iles upon the West of Scotland. Arrans, and by them the scatt'red Iles upon the West of Scotland. Eubides Rejoyce even at my name; and put on mirthfull cheere, When of my good estate, they by the Sea-Nymphs heare. Sometimes within my shades, in many an ancient wood, Whose often-twined tops, great Phœbus fires withstood, The fearelesse British Priests, under an aged Oake, Taking a milk-white Bull, unstrained with the yoke, And with an Axe of gold, from that Jove-sacred tree The Missleto cut downe; then with a bended knee On th'unhew'd Altar layd, put to the hallowed fires: And whilst in the sharpe flame the trembling flesh expires, As their strong furie mov'd (when all the rest adore) Pronouncing their desires the sacrifice before, Up to th'eternall heaven their bloodied hands did reare: And, whilst the murmuring woods even shuddred as with feare, Preacht to the beardlesse youth, the soules immortall state; To other bodies still how it should transmigrate, That to contempt of death them strongly might excite. To dwell in my blacke shades the Wood-gods did delight, Untroden with resort that long so gloomy were, As when the Roman came, it strooke him sad with feare To looke upon my face, which then was call'd the Darke; Untill in after time, the English for a marke Gave me this hatefull name, which I must ever beare, And Anglesey from them am called every where. My Brooks (to whose sweet brimmes the Sylvans did resort, In glyding through my shades, to mightie Neptunes Court, Of their huge Oakes bereft) to heaven so open lie, That now ther's not a roote discern'd by any eye: My Brent, a pretty Beck, attending Menas mouth, With those her sister Rills, that beare upon the South, Guint, forth along with her Lewenny that doth draw; And next to them againe, the fat and moory Frawe, Which with my Princes Court I some-time pleas'd to grace, As those that to the West directly runne their race. Smooth Allo in her fall, that Lynon in doth take; Mathanon, that amaine doth tow'rds Moylroniad make, The Sea-calfes to behold that bleach them on her shore, Which Gweger to her gets, as to increase her store. Then Dulas to the North that straineth, as to see The Ile that breedeth Mice: whose store so lothsome bee, That shee in Neptunes brack her blewish head doth hide. When now the wearied Muse her burthen having ply'd, Her selfe awhile betakes to bathe her in the Sound; And quitting in her course the goodly Monian ground, Assayes the Penmenmaur, and her cleere eyes doth throwe On Conway, tow'rds the East, to England back to goe: Where finding Denbigh fayre, and Flint not out of sight, Cryes yet afresh for Wales, and for Brutes ancient right. The tenth Song The Argument. The serious Muse her selfe applyes To Merlins ancient prophecies, At Dinas Emris; where hee show'd How Fate the Britaines rule bestow'd. To Conway next she turnes her tale, And sings her Cluyds renowned Vale; Then of Saint Winifrid doth tell, And all the wonders of her Well; Makes Dee, Bruit's historie pursue: At which, shee bids her Wales Adieu. Awhile thus taking breath, our way yet faire in view, The Muse her former course doth seriously pursue. From Penmens craggy height to try her saily wings, Penmenmaure. Her selfe long having bath'd in the delicious Springs (That trembling from his top through long-worne crannies creepe, To spend their liquid store on the insatiate Deepe) Shee meets with Conway first, which lyeth next at hand: Pearle in the River Conway. Whose precious orient Pearle that breedeth in her sand, Above the other floods of Britaine doth her grace: Into the Irish Sea which making out her race, Supply'd by many a Mere (through many severall Rills Into her bosome pour'd) her plentiously shee fills. O goodly River! neere unto thy sacred Spring Prophetique Merlin sate, when to the British King The changes long to come, auspiciously he told. Most happy were thy Nymphs, that wondring did behold, His graver wrinkled brow, amazed and did heare The dreadfull words he spake, that so ambiguous were. Thrice happy Brooks, I say, that (every way about) Thy tributaries be: as is that Towne, where-out Into the Sea thou fall'st, which Conway of thy name Perpetually is call'd, to register thy fame. For thou, cleere Conway, heard'st wise Merlin first relate The Destinies Decree, of Britains future fate; Which truly he fore-told proud Vortiger should lose: As, when him from his seat the Saxons should depose: The forces that should heere from Little Britaine in France. Armorick arrive, Yet farre too weake from hence the enemie to drive: And to that mightie King, which rashly under-tooke A strong-wall'd Tower to reare, those earthly spirits that shooke The great foundation still, in Dragons horrid shape, That dreaming Wisard told; making the Mountaine gape With his most powerfull charmes, to view those Caverns deepe; And from the top of Part of the Snowdon. Brith, so high and wondrous steepe, Where Dinas Emris stood, shew'd where the Serpents fought, The White that tore the Red; from whence the Prophet wrought The Britains sad decay then shortly to ensue. O! happy yee that heard the man who all things knew Untill the generall Doome, through all the world admyr'd: By whose Prophetick Sawes yee all became inspyr'd; As well the forked Neage, that neer'st her Fountaine springs, With her beloved maid, Melandidar, that brings Her flowe, where Conway forth into the Sea doth slide (That to their Mistris make from the Denbighian side) As those that from the hills of proud Carnarvan fall. This scarce the Muse had said, but Cluyd doth quickly call Her great recourse, to come and gard her while shee glide Along the goodly Vale (which with her wealthy pride Much beautifies her banks; so naturally her owne, The situation of Dyfferen Cluyd.That Dyffren Cluyd by her both farre and neere is knowne) With high embatteld hills that each way is enclos'd But onely on the North: and to the North dispos'd, Fierce Boreas finds accesse to court the dainty Vale: Who, whisp'ring in her eare with many a wanton tale, Allures her to his love (his Leman her to make) As one that in himselfe much suffreth for her sake. The Iles upon the North-east &amp; West of Scotland. Orcades, and all those Iles upon the North-east &amp; West of Scotland. Eubides imbrac't In Neptunes aged armes, to Neptune seeming chast, Yet prostitute themselves to Boreas; who neglects The Calidonian Downes, nor ought at all respects The other in-land Dales, abroad that scattred lie, Some on the English earth, and some in Albany; But, courting Dyffren Cluyd, her beautie doth prefer. Such dalliance as alone the North-wind hath with her, Orithya not enjoy'd, from Thrace when hee her tooke, And in his saylie plumes the trembling Virgin shooke: But through the extreame love hee to this Vale doth beare, In the vi. book of Ovids Metamorph. Growes jealous at the length, and mightily doth feare Great Neptune, whom he sees to smug his horrid face: And, fearing least the God should so obtaine her grace, From the Septentrion cold, in the breem freezing ayre, Where the bleake North-wind keepes, still dominering there, From Shetland stradling wide, his foote on Thuly sets: The Tydes out of the North and South Seas, meeting in S. Georges chanel. Whence storming, all the vast Deucalidon hee threts, And beares his boystrous waves into the narrower mouth Of the Vergivian Sea: where meeting, from the South, Great Neptunes surlier tides, with their robustious shocks, Each other shoulder up against the griesly Rocks; As strong men when they meet, contending for the path: But, comming neere the Coast where Cluyd her dwelling hath, The North-wind (calme become) forgets his Ire to wreake, And the delicious Vale thus mildly doth bespeake; Deere Cluyd, th'aboundant sweets, that from thy bosome flowe, When with my active wings into the ayre I throwe, Those Hills whose hoarie heads seeme in the clouds to dwell, Of aged become young, enamor'd with the smell Of th'odoriferous flowers in thy most precious lap: Within whose velvit leaves, when I my selfe enwrap, They suffocate with sents; that (from my native kind) I seeme some slowe perfume, and not the swiftest wind. With joy, my Dyffren Cluyd, I see thee bravely spred, Survaying every part, from foote up to thy head; Thy full and youthfull breasts, which in their meadowy pride, Are brancht with rivery veines, Meander-like that glide. I further note in thee, more excellent then these (Were there a thing that more the amorous eye might please) Thy plumpe and swelling wombe, whose mellowy gleabe doth beare The yellow ripened sheafe, that bendeth with the eare. Whilst in this sort his sute he amorously preferd, Moylvennill neere at hand, the North-wind over-heard: And, vexed at the hart, that he a Mountaine great, Which long time in his breast had felt loves kindly heat, As one whom crystall Cluyd had with her beauty caught, Is for that Rivers sake neere of his wits distraught, With inly rage to heare that Valley so extold; And yet that Brooke whose course so batfull makes her mould, And one that lends that Vale her most renowned name, Should of her meaner farre, be over-gone in fame. Riverets running into Cluyd out of Denbigh and Flintshire.Wherefore, Moylevennill will'd his Cluyd her selfe to showe: Who, from her native Fount, as proudly shee doth flowe, Her hand-maids Manian hath, and Hespin, her to bring To Ruthin. Whose faire seate first kindly visiting, To lead her thence in state, Lewenny lends her sourse: That when Moylvennill sees his Rivers great recourse, From his intrenched top is pleas'd with her supplies. Claweddock commeth in, and Istrad likewise hies Unto the Queene-like Cluyd, as shee to Denbigh drawes: And on the other side, from whence the Morning dawes, Downe from the Flintian hills, comes Wheler, her to beare To sacred Asaph's See, his hallowed Temple; where Faire Elwy having wonne her sister Aleds power, They entertaine their Cluyd neere mighty Neptunes bower: Who likewise is sustain'd by Senion, last that falls, And from the Virgins Well doth wash old Ruthlands walls. Moylvennill with her sight that never is suffic'd, Now with excessive joy so strongly is surpriz'd, That thus he proudly spake; On the Gwynethian ground (And looke from East to West) what Country is there crown'd As thou Part of the Vale call'd Teg-Engle. i. Faire England. Tegenia art? that, with a Vale so rich (Cut thorough with the Cluyd, whose graces me bewitch) The fruitfulst of all Wales, so long hast honor'd bin: As also by thy Spring, such wonder who dost win, That naturally remote, sixe British miles from Sea, A Fountaine ebbing and flowing, contrary to the course of the Sea.And rising on the Firme, yet in the naturall day Twice falling, twice doth fill, in most admired wise. When Cynthia from the East unto the South doth rise, That mighty Neptune flowes, then strangly ebs thy Well: And when againe he sinks, as strangely shee doth swell; Yet to the sacred fount of Winifrid gives place; Of all the Cambrian Springs of such especiall grace, That oft the Of Dee. Devian Nymphs, as also those that keepe Amongst the Corall-Groves in the Vergivian Deepe, Have left their watry bowers, their secret safe Retire, To see her whom report so greatly should admire (Whose waters to this day as perfect are and cleere, As her delightfull eyes in their full beauties were, A virgin while she liv'd) chaste Winifrid: who chose Before her mayden-gem she forcibly would lose, To have her harmlesse life by the leud Rapter spilt: For which, still more and more to aggravate his guilt, The livelesse teares shee shed, into a Fountaine turne. And, that for her alone the water should not mourne, The pure vermillion bloud, that issu'd from her vaines, Unto this very day the pearly Gravell staines; As erst the white and red were mixed in her cheeke. And, that one part of her might be the other like, Her haire was turn'd to mosse; whose sweetnesse doth declare, In livelinesse of youth the naturall sweets she bare: And of her holy life the innocence to show, What-ever living thing into this Well you throwe, Shee strongly beares it up, not suffring it to sinke. Besides, the wholesome use in bathing, or in drinke Doth the diseased cure, as thereto shee did leave Her vertue with her name, that time should not bereave. Scarce of this tedious tale Moylevennill made an end, But that the higher A place mountainous, and somewhat inaccessible. Yale, whose beeing doth ascend Into the pleasant East, his loftier head advanc't. This Region, as a man that long had been intranc't (Whilst thus himselfe to please, the mightie Mountaine tells Such Strange things. farlies of his Cluyd, and of his wondrous Wells) Stood thinking what to doe: least faire Tegenia, plac't So admirably well, might hold her selfe disgrac't By his so barren site, be'ing Mountainous and cold, To nothing more unlike then Dyffren's batfull mould; And in respect of her, to be accounted rude. Yale, for he would not be confounded quite by Cluyd (And for his common want, to coyne some poore excuse) Unto his proper praise, discreetly doth produce A Valley, for a Vale, of her peculiar kind; In goodnesse, breadth, and length, though Dyffren farre behind: On this yet dare he stand, that for the naturall frame, That figure of the Crosse, of which it takes the name, Is equall with the best, which else excell it farre: And by the power of that most sacred Character, Respect beyond the rest unto herselfe doth win. When now the sterner Dee doth instantly begin His ampler selfe to showe, that (downe the verdant Dale) Straines, in his nobler course along the rougher Yale, T'invite his favouring Brookes: where from that spacious Lin The Rivers in the East of Denbigh, falling into Dee.Through which he comes unmixt, first Alwin falleth in: And going on along, still gathering up his force, Gets Gerrow to his ayde, to hasten on his course. With Christioneth next, comes Keriog in apace. Out of the leaden Mines, then with her sullied face Claweddock casts about where Gwenrow shee may greet, Till like two loving friends they under Wrexam meet. Then Alen makes approach (to Dee most inly deere) Taking Tegiddog in; who, earnest to be there, For haste, twice under earth her crystall head doth runne: When instantly againe, Dee's holinesse begun, By his contracted front and sterner waves, to show That he had things to speake, might profit them to know; A Brooke, that was suppos'd much business to have seene, Which had an See to the VIII. Song. ancient bound twixt Wales and England been, And noted was by both to be an ominous Flood, That changing of his Foards, the future ill, or good, Of either Country told; of eithers warre, or peace, The sicknes, or the health, the dearth, or the increase: And that of all the Floods of Britaine, he might boast His streame in former times to have been honor'd most, When as at Chester once king Edgar held his Court, To whom eight lesser Kings with homage did resort: That mightie Mercian Lord, him in his Barge bestow'd, And was by all those Kings about the River row'd. For which, the hallowed Dee so much upon him tooke. And now the time was come, that this imperious Brooke, The long traduced Brute determin'd to awake, And in the Britains right thus boldly to them spake; O yee the ancient race of famous Brute that bee, And thou the Queene of Iles, great Britaine; why doe yee Your Grand-sires God-like name (with a neglectfull eare) In so reproachfull tearmes and ignominy heare, By every one of late contemptuouslie disgra'ct; That he whom Time so long, and strongly hath imbrac't, Should be rejected quite? The reason urged why, Is by the generall foe thus answer'd by and by: That Brutus, as you say, by Sea who hither came, From whom you would suppose this Ile first tooke the name, Meerelie fictitious is; nor could the Romans heare (Most studious of the truth, and neer'st those times that were) Of any such as hee: nay, they who most doe strive, From that great stock of Troy their linage to derive, In all the large descent of Iülus, never found That Brute, on whom wee might our first beginning ground. To this Assertion, thus I faithfully reply; And as a friend to Truth, doe constantlie denie Antiquitie to them, as neerer to those times; Their writings to precede our ancient British Rimes: But that our noble Bards which so divinely sung That remnant of old Troy, of which the Britaines sprung, Before those Romans were, as proofe we can produce; And learning, long with us, ere t'was with them in use. And they but idly talke, upbrayding us with lies. That Geffray Monmouth, first, our Brutus did devise, Not heard of till his time our Adversary saies: When pregnantlie wee prove, ere that Historians dayes, A thousand ling'ring yeeres, our Prophets cleerely song The Britaine-founding Brute, most frequent them among. From Taliessen wise (approved so with us, That what he spake, was held to be oraculous, So true his writings were) and such immortall men As this now-waning world shall hardly heare agen In our owne genuine tongue, that natives were of Wales Our Geffray had his Brute. Nor were these idle tales (As he may find, the truth of our descents that seekes) Nor fabulous, like those devised by the Greeks: But from the first of Time, by Judges still were heard, Discreetlie every At the Stethva: see to the fourth Song. yeere correcting where they err'd. And that whereon our Foe his greatest hold doth take, Against the handled Cause and most doth seeme to make, Is, that we shewe no Booke our Brutus to approve; But that our idle Bards, as their fond rage did move, The Druides would not commit their mysteries to wryting. Sang what their fancies pleas'd. Thus doe I answere these; That th'ancient British Priests, the fearlesse Druides, That ministred the lawes, and were so trulie wise, That they determin'd states, attending sacrifice, To letters never would their mysteries commit, For which the breasts of men they deem'd to be more fit. Which questionlesse should seeme from judgement to proceed. For, when of Ages past wee looke in bookes to read, Wee retchlesly discharge our memory of those. So when injurious Time, such Monuments doth lose (As what so great a Work, by Time that is not wrackt?) Wee utterly forgoe that memorable act: But when we lay it up within the minds of men, They leave it their next Age; that, leaves it hers agen: So strongly which (me thinks) doth for Tradition make, As if you from the world it altogether take, You utterly subvert Antiquitie thereby. For though Time well may prove that often shee doth lie, Posteritie by her yet many things hath known, That ere men learn'd to write, could no way have been shown: For, if the spirit of God, did not our faith assure The Scriptures be from heaven, like heaven, divinely pure, Of Moses mightie works, I reverently may say (I speake with godlie feare) Tradition put away, In power of humane wit it easely doth not lie To prove before the Flood the Genealogie. Nor any thing there is that kindlier doth agree With our descent from Troy (if things compar'd may be) Then peopling of this place, neere to those Ages, when Exiled by the Greeks, those poore world-wandring men (Of all hope to returne into their Country reft) Sought shores whereon to set that little them was left: From some such God-like race we questionlesse did spring, Who soone became so great heere once inhabiting. So barbarous nor were wee as manie have us made, And Cæsars envious pen would all the world perswade, His owne ambitious ends in seeking to advance, When with his Roman power arriving heere from France, If hee the Britains found experienc't so in warre, That they with such great skill could weeld their armed Carre; And, as he still came on, his skilfull march to let, Cut downe their aged Oakes, and in the Rivers set The sharpe steele-poynted stakes, as hee the Foards should pass; I faine would understand how this that Nation was So ignorant hee would make, and yet so knowing warre. But, in things past so long (for all the world) we are Like to a man embarqu't, and travelling the Deepe: Who sayling by some hill, or promontory steepe Which juts into the Sea, with an amazed eye Beholds the Cleeves thrust up into the lofty skie. And th'more that hee doth looke, the more it drawes his sight; Now at the craggy front, then at the wondrous weight: But, from the passed shore still as the swelling saile (Thrust forward by the wind) the floating Barque doth haile, The mightie Giant-heape, so lesse and lesser still Appeareth to the eye, untill the monstrous hill At length shewes like a cloud; and further beeing cast, Is out of kenning quite: So, of the Ages past; Those things that in their Age much to be wondred were, Still as wing-footed Time them farther off doth beare, Doe lessen every howre. When now the mighty prease, Impatient of his speech, intreat the Flood to cease, And cry with one consent, the Saxon state to showe, As angry with the Muse such labour to bestowe On Wales, but England still neglected thus to be. And having past the time, the honorable Dee At Chester was arriv'd, and bad them all adieu: When our intended course, with England we pursue. The eleventh Song. The Argument. The Muse, her native earth to see, Returnes to England over Dee; Visits stout Cheshire, and there showes To her and hers, what England owes; And of the Nymphets sporting there In Wyrrall, and in Delamere. Weever, the great devotion sings Of the religious Saxon Kings; Those Riverets doth together call, That into him, and Mersey fall; Thence bearing to the side of Peake, This zealous Canto off doth breake. With as unwearied wings, and in as high a gate As when we first set forth, observing every state, The Muse from Cambria comes, with pinions summ'd and sound: And having put her selfe upon the English ground, First seiseth in her course the noblest Cestrian shore; Of our great English bloods as carefull heere of yore, As Cambria of her Brutes, now is, or could be then; For which, our proverbe calls her, Cheshire, chiefe of men. And of our Countries, place of Palatine doth hold, And thereto hath her high Regalities enrold: Besides, in many Fields since Conquering William came, Her people shee hath prov'd, to her eternall fame. All, children of her owne, the Leader and the Led, The mightiest men of boane, in her full bosome bred: And neither of them such as cold penurious need Spurs to each rash attempt; but such as soundly feed, Clad in warme English cloth; and maym'd should they returne (Whom this false ruthless world else from their doores would spurne) Have livelihood of their owne, their ages to sustaine. Nor did the Tenants pay, the Land-lords charge maintaine: But as abroad in warre, he spent of his estate; Returning to his home, his hospitable gate The richer and the poore stood open to receave. They, of all England, most to ancient customes cleave, Their Yeomanry and still endevoured to uphold. For rightly whilst her selfe brave England was of old, And our courageous Kings us forth to conquests led, Our Armies in those times (neere through the world so dred) Of our tall Yeomen were, and foot-men for the most; Who (with their Bills, and Bowes) may confidently boast, Our Leopards they so long and bravely did advance Above the Flower-delice, even in the hart of France. The generall bounds of Cheshire.O! thou thrice happy Shire, confined so to bee Twixt two so famous Floods, as Mersey is, and Dee. Thy Dee upon the West from Wales doth thee divide: Thy Mersey on the North, from the Lancastrian side, Thy naturall sister Shire; and linkt unto thee so, That Lancashire along with Cheshire still doth goe. As tow'rds the Derbian Peake, and Moreland (which doe draw More mountainous and wild) the high-crown'd Shutlingslawe And Molcop be thy Mounds, with those proud hills whence rove The lovely sister Brooks, the silvery Dane and Dove; Cleere Dove, that makes to Trent; the other to the West. But, in that famous Towne, most happy of the rest (From which thou tak'st thy name) faire Chester, call'd of old Carelegion; whilst proud Rome her conquests heere did hold Of those her legions known the faithfull station then, So stoutly held to tack by those neere North-wales men; Yet by her owne right name had rather called bee, As her the Britaine tearm'd, The Fortresse upon Dee, Then vainly shee would seeme a Miracle to stand, Th'imaginary worke of some huge Giants hand: Which if such ever were, Tradition tells not who. But, backe awhile my Muse: to Weever let us goe, Which (with himselfe compar'd) each British flood doth scorne; His fountaine and his fall, both Chesters rightly borne; The Country in his course, that cleane through doth divide, Cut in two equall shares upon his either side: And, what the famous Flood farre more then that enriches, The bracky Fountaines are, those two renowned Wyches, The Nant-wyche, and the North; whose either brynie Well, For store and sorts of Salts, make Weever to excell. Besides their generall use, not had by him in vaine, But in him selfe thereby doth holinesse retaine Above his fellow Floods: whose healthfull vertues taught, Hath of the Sea-gods oft, caus'd Weever to be sought, For physick in their need: and Thetis oft hath seene, When by their wanton sports her Ner'ides have beene So sick, that Glaucus selfe hath failed in their cure: Yet Weever, by his Salts, recovery durst assure. And Amphitrite oft this Wisard River led Into her secret walks (the Depths profound and dread) Of him (suppos'd so wise) the hid events to knowe Of things that were to come, as things done long agoe. In which he had beene prov'd most exquisite to bee; And bare his fame so farre, that oft twixt him and Dee, Much strife there hath arose in their prophetick skill. But to conclude his praise, our Weever heere doth will The Muse, his sourse to sing; as how his course he steres: Who from his naturall Spring, as from his neighboring Meres Sufficiently supply'd, shootes forth his silver breast, As though he meant to take directly toward the East; Untill at length it proves he loytreth, but to play Till Ashbrooke and the Lee o're-take him on the way, Which to his journeys end him earnestly doe haste: Till having got to Wyche, hee taking there a taste Of her most savory Salt, is by the sacred tuch, Forc't faster in his course, his motion quickned much To North-wyche: and at last, as hee approacheth neere, Dane, Whelock drawes, then Crock, from that black ominous Mere, Accounted one of those that Englands wonders make; Of neighbours, Black-mere nam'd, of strangers, Breretons-Lake; Whose property seemes farre from Reasons way to stand: For, neere before his death that's owner of the Land, Shee sends up stocks of trees, that on the top doe float; By which the world her first did for a wonder note. His handmayd Howty next, to Weever holds her race: When Peever with the helpe of Pickmere, make apace To put-in with those streames his sacred steps that tread, Into the mighty waste of Mersey him to lead. Where, when the Rivers meet, with all their stately traine, Proud Mersey is so great in entring of the Maine, As hee would make a shewe for Empery to stand, And wrest the three-forkt Mace from out grym Neptunes hand; To Cheshire highly bound for that his watry store, As to the grosser Meres, or standing Lakes. Loughs on the Lancastrian shore. From hence he getteth Goyt downe from her Peakish spring, And Bollen, that along doth nimbler Birkin bring From Maxfields mightie wildes, of whose shagg'd Sylvans shee Hath in the Rocks been woo'd, their Paramour to bee: Who in the darksome holes, and Caverns kept her long, And that proud Forrest made a party to her wrong. Yet could not all intreat the pretty Brooke to stay; Which to her sister streame, sweet Bollen, creeps away. To whom, upon their road shee pleasantly reports The many mirthfull jests, and wanton woodish sports In Maxfield they have had; as of that Forrests fate: Untill they come at length, where Mersey for more state Assuming broder banks, himselfe so proudly beares, That at his sterne approach, extended Wyrrall feares, That (what betwixt his floods of Mersey, and the Dee) In very little time devoured he might bee: Out of the foaming surge till Hilbre lifts his head, To let the fore-land see how richly he had sped. Which Mersey cheeres so much, that with a smyling brow A poëticall description of Wyrrall.He fawnes on both those Floods; their amorous armes that throw About his goodly neck, and bar'd their swelling breasts: On which whilst lull'd with ease, his pleased cheeke he rests, The Naiades, sitting neere upon the aged Rocks, Are busied with their combes, to brayd his verdant locks, Whilst in their crystall eyes he doth for Cupids looke: But Delamere from them his fancie quickly tooke, Who shewes her selfe all drest in most delicious flowers; And sitting like a Queene, sees from her shady Bowers The wanton Wood-Nymphs mixt with her light-footed Fawnes, To lead the rurall routs about the goodly Lawnds, As over A wood growing on a hill or knole. Holt and Heath, as thorough High wood. Frith and Lowe coppis. Fell; And oft at Barly-breake, and Prison-base, to tell (In carrolds as they course) each other all the joyes, The passages, deceits, the sleights, the amorous toyes The subtile Sea-Nymphs had, their Wyrralls love to win. But Weever now againe to warne them doth begin To leave these triviall toyes, which inly hee did hate, That neither them beseem'd, nor stood with his estate (Beeing one that gave him selfe industriously to know What Monuments our Kings erected long agoe: To which, the Flood himselfe so wholly did apply, As though upon his skill, the rest should all rely) And bent himselfe to shewe, that yet the Britains bold, Whom the laborious Muse so highly had extold, Those later Saxon Kings exceld not in their deeds, And therefore with their praise thus zealously proceeds; Whilst, the celestiall Powers th'arrived time attend When o're this generall Ile the Britaines raigne should end, And for the spoyling Pict heere prosp'rously had wrought, Into th'afflicted Land which strong invasion brought, And to that proud attempt, what yet his power might want, The ill-disposed heavens, Brutes ofspring to supplant, Their angry plagues downe-pour'd, insatiate in their waste (Needs must they fall, whom heaven doth to destruction haste. And that which lastly came to consummate the rest, Those prouder Saxon powers (which liberally they prest Against th'invading Pict, of purpose hired in) From those which payd them wage, the Iland soone did win; And sooner overspred, beeing Masters of the Field; Those, first for whom they fought, too impotent to wield, A Land within it selfe that had so great a Foe; And therefore thought it fit them wisely to bestow: Which over Severne heere they in the Mountaines shut, And some upon that poynt of Cornwall forth they put. Yet forced were they there their stations to defend. Nor could our men permit the Britains to descend From Jove or Mars alone; but brought their blood as hie, From Woden, by which name they stiled Mercurie. Nor were the race of Brute, which ruled heere before, More zealous to the Gods they brought unto this shore Then Hengists noble heyres; their Idols that to raise Heere put their German names upon our weekly daies. These noble Saxons were a Nation hard and strong, On sundry Lands and Seas, in warfare nuzzled long; Affliction throughly knew; and in proud Fortunes spight, Even in the jawes of Death had dar'd her utmost might: Who under Hengist first, and Horsa, their brave Chiefes, From Germany arriv'd, and with the strong reliefes See, concerning their comming, to the I. IV. and VIII. Songs.Of th'Angles and the Jutes, them ready to supply, Which anciently had beene of their affinitie, By Scythia first sent out, which could not give them meat, Were forc't to seeke a soyle wherein themselves to seat. Them at the last on Dansk their lingring fortune drave, Where Holst unto their troups sufficient harbor gave. These with the Saxons went, and fortunatly wan: Whose Captaine, Hengist, first a kingdome heere began In Kent; where his great heires, ere other Princes rose Of Saxonies descent, their fulness to oppose, With swelling Humbers side their Empire did confine. And of the rest, not least renowned of their Line, Good Ethelbert of Kent, th'first christned English King, To preach the faith of Christ, was first did hither bring Wise Augustine the Monke, from holy Gregory sent. This most religious King, with most devout intent That mightie Fane to Paule, in London did erect, And priviledges gave, this Temple to protect. His equall then in zeale, came Ercombert againe, From that first christned King, the second in that raigne. The gluttony then us'd severely to suppresse, And make men fit to prayer (much hindred by excesse) That abstinence from flesh for forty dayes began, Which by the name of Lent is knowne to every man. As mighty Hengist heere, by force of Armes had done, So Ella comming in, soone from the Britaines wonne The Countries neighboring Kent: which lying from the Maine, Directly to the South did properly obtaine The Southerne Saxons name; and not the last thereby Amongst the other raignes which made the Heptarchy: So in the high descent of that South-Saxon King, We in the bead-roule heere of our religious bring Wise Ethelwald: alone who Christian not became, But willing that his folke should all receive the name, Saint Wilfrid (sent from Yorke) into his Realme receiv'd (Whom the Northumbrian folke had of his See bereav'd) And on the South of Thames, a seat did him afford, By whom that people first receiv'd the saving Word. As likewise from the loynes of Erchinwin (who rais'd Th'East-Saxons kingdome first) brave Sebert may be prais'd: Which, as that King of Kent, had with such cost and state Built Paules; his Greatness so (this King to imitate) Began the goodly Church of Westminster to reare: The Primer English Kings so truly zealous were. Then Sebba, a Monk in Pauls. Sebba of his seed, that did them all surpasse, Who fitter for a shryne then for a scepter was, (Above the power of flesh, his appetite to sterve That his desired Christ he strictly might observe) Even in his height of life, in health, in body strong, Perswaded with his Queene, a Lady faire and young, To separate themselves, and in a sole estate, After religious sort themselves to dedicate. Whose Nephew Uffa next, inflam'd with his high praise (Enriching that proud Fane his Grandsire first did raise) Abandoned the world he found so full of strife, And after liv'd in Rome a strict religious life. Nor these our Princes heere, of that pure Saxon straine, Which tooke unto themselves each one their severall raigne, For their so godly deeds, deserved greater fame Then th'Angles their Allies, that hither with them came; Who sharing-out themselves a kingdome in the East, With th'Easterne Angles name their circuit did invest, By Uffa in that part so happily begun: Whose successors the Crowne for martyrdome have won From all before or since that ever suffred heere; Redwalds religious sonnes: who for their Saviour deere, By cruell heathenish hands unmercifully slaine, Amongst us ever-more remembred shall remaine, And in the roule of Saints must have a speciall roome, Where Derwald to all times with Erpenwald shall come. When in that way they went, next Sebert them succeeds, Scarce seconded againe for sanctimonious deeds: Who for a private life when he his rule resign'd, And to his Cloyster long had strictly him confin'd, A Corslet for his Cowle was glad againe to take His Country to defend (for his religions sake) Against proud Penda, com'n with all his Pagan power, Those christned Angles then of purpose to devour: And suffring with his folke, by Penda's heathenish pride, As hee a Saint had liv'd, a constant Martyr dy'd. When, after it fell out, that Offa had not long Held that by cruell force, which Penda got by wrong, Adopting for his heire young Edmond, brought him in, Even at what time the Danes this Iland sought to win: Who christned soone became, and as religious growne As those most heathenish were who set him on his throne, Did expiate in that place his predecessors guilt, Which so much Christian blood so cruelly had spilt. For, taken by the Danes, who did all tortures try, His Saviour Jesus Christ to force him to deny; First beating him with bats, but no advantage got, His body full of shafts then cruelly they shot; The constant martyr'd King, a Saint thus justly crown'd. To whom even in that place, that Monument renown'd Those after-Ages built to his eternall fame. What English hath not heard In Suffolke. Saint Edmonds Buries name? As of those Angles heere, so from their loynes againe, Whose hands hew'd out their way to the West-Sexian raigne (From Kenrick, or that claime from Cerdick to descend) A partnership in fame great Ina might pretend With any King since first the Saxons came to shore. Of all those christned heere, who highlier did adore The God-head, then that man? or more that did apply His power t'advance the Church in true sincerity? Great Glastenbury then so wondrously decay'd, Whose old foundation first the ancient Britains lay'd, He gloriously rebuilt, enriching it with plate, And many a sumptuous Cope, to uses consecrate: Ordayning godly lawes for governing this Land, Of all the Saxon Kings the Solon hee shall stand. Otta, brother to Hengist.From Otta (borne with him who did this Ile invade) And had a conquest first of the Northumbrians made, And tributarie long of mightier Hengist held, Till Ida (after borne) the Kentish power expeld, And absolutely sate on the Dierian seat, But afterward resign'd to Ethelfrid the Great: An Army into Wales who for invasion led, At Chester and in fight their forces vanquished; Into their utter spoyle, then publique way to make, The long Religious house of goodly Bangor brake, And slew a thousand Monks, as they devoutly pray'd. For which his cruell spoyle upon the Christians made (Though with the just consent of Christian Saxons slaine) His blood, the hethenish hands of Redwald did distaine. That murtherers issue next, this kingdome were exil'd: And Edwyn tooke the rule; a Prince as just and mild As th'other faithlesse were: nor could time ever bring In all the seaven-fold rule an absoluter King; And more t'advance the fayth, his utmost power that lent: Who reordained Yorke a Bishops government; And so much lov'd the poore, that in the waies of trade, Where Fountaines fitly were, hee Iron dishes made, And fastned them with chaynes the wayfarer to ease, And the poore Pilgrims thirst, there resting, to appease. As Mercia, mongst the rest, sought not the least to raise The saving Christian fayth, nor merits humbler praise. Nor those that from the stem of Saxon Creda came (The Britains who expulst) were any whit in fame, For pietie and zeale, behind the others best; Though heathenish Penda long and proudly did infest The christned neighboring Kings, and forc't them all to bow; Till Oswy made, to God, a most religious vow, Of his aboundant grace would hee be pleas'd to grant, That he this Panim Prince in battell might supplant, A Recluse he would give his daughter and delight, Sweet Alfled then in youth, and as the Morning, bright: And having his request, hee gave as hee obtayn'd; Though his unnaturall hands succeeding Wulpher stayn'd In his owne childrens blood, whom their deare mother had Confirm'd in Christs beliefe, by that most reverent Chad: Yet to embrace the fayth when after he began (For the unnaturalst deed that e're was done by man) If possible it were to expiate his guilt, Heere many a goodly house to holy uses built: And shee (to purge his crime on her deere children done) A crowned Queene, for him, became a valed Nun. What Age a godlier Prince then Etheldred could bring? Or then our Kinred heere, a more religious King? Both taking them the Cowle, th'one heere his flesh did tame, The other went to Rome, and there a Monke became. So, Ethelbald may well be set the rest among: Who, though most vainly given when he was hot and young; Yet, by the wise reproofe of godly Bishops brought From those unstay'd delights by which his youth was caught, Hee all the former Kings of Mercia did exceed, And (through his Rule) the Church from taxes strongly freed. Then to the Easterne sea, in that deepe watry Fen (Which seem'd a thing so much impossible to men) Hee that great Abby built of Crowland; as though hee Would have no others worke like his foundation bee. As, Offa greater farre then any him before: Whose conquests scarcely were suffic'd with all the shore; But over into Wales adventurously hee shot His Mercia's spacious Offa's Ditch. Meere, and Powsland to it got. This King, even in that place, where with rude heapes of stones The Britains had interr'd their Proto-martyrs bones, That goodly Abby built to Alban; as to showe How much the sonnes of Brute should to the Saxons owe. But when by powerfull heaven, it was decreed at last, That all those seaven-fold Rules should into one be cast (Which quickly to a head by Egberts predecessor. Britriks death was brought) Then Egbert, who in France had carefully been taught, Returning home, was King of the West-Sexians made. Whose people, then most rich and potent, him perswade (As once it was of old) to Monarchize the Land. Who following their advise, first with a warlike hand The Cornish over-came; and thence, with prosperous sailes, O're Severne set his powers into the hart of Wales; And with the Mercians there, a bloody battell wag'd: Wherein he wan their Rule; and with his wounds enrag'd, Went on against the rest. Which, sadly when they sawe How those had sped before, with most subjective awe Submit them to his sword: who prosperously alone Reduc't the seaven-fold Rule, to his peculiar throne (Extirping other stiles) and gave it Englands name Of th'Angles, from whose race his nobler fathers came. When scarcely Egbert heere an entire Rule began, But instantly the See to the first Song. Dane the Iland over-ran; A people, that their owne those Saxons payd againe. For, as the Britaines first they treacherously had slaine, This third upon their necks a heavier burthen lay'd Then they had upon those whom falsly they betray'd. And for each others states, though oft they here did toyle, A people from their first bent naturally to spoyle, That crueltie with them from their beginning brought. Yet when the Christian fayth in them had throughly wrought, Of any in the world no story shall us tell, Which did the Saxon race in pious deeds excell: That in these drowsie times should I in publique bring Each great peculiar Act of every godly King, The world might stand amaz'd in this our Age to see Those goodly Fanes of theirs, which irreligious wee Let every day decay; and yet we onely live By the great Freedoms then those Kings to these did give. Wise Segbert (worthy praise) preparing us the seat Of famous Cambridge first, then with endowments great The Muses to maintaine, those Sisters thither brought. By whose example, next, religious Alfred taught, Renowned Oxford built t'Apollo's learned brood; And on the hallowed banke of Isis goodly Flood, Worthy the glorious Arts, did gorgeous Bowres provide. He into severall Shires the kingdome did divide. So, valiant Edgar, first, most happily destroy'd The multitudes of Wolves, that long the Land annoy'd. And our good Edward heere, the Confessor and King (Unto whose sumptuous Shrine our Monarchs offrings bring) That cankred Evill cur'd, bred twixt the throat and jawes. When Physick could not find the remedy nor cause, And much it did afflict his sickly people heere, Hee of Almightie God obtain'd by earnest pray'r, This Tumour by a King might cured be alone: Which he an heyre-loome left unto the English Throne. So, our Saint Edward heere, for Englands generall use, Our Countries Common lawes did faithfully produce, Both from th'old British writ, and from the Saxon tongue. Of Forrests, Hills, and Floods, when now a mighty throng For Audience cry'd aloud; because they late had heard, That some high Cambrian hills the Wrekin proudly dar'd With words that very much had stirr'd his rancorous spleene. Where, though cleere Severne set her Princely selfe betweene The English and the Welsh, yet could not make them cease. Heere, Weever, as a Flood affecting godly peace, His place of speech resignes; and to the Muse refers The hearing of the Cause, to stickle all these stirs. The twelfth Song. The Argument. The Muse, that part of Shropshire plyes Which on the East of Severne lies: Where mighty Wrekin from his hight, In the proud Cambrian Mountaines spight, Sings those great Saxons ruling here, Which the most famous warriors were. And as shee in her course proceeds, Relating many glorious deeds, Of Guy of Warwicks fight doth straine With Colebrond, that renowned Dane, And of the famous Battels tryde Twixt Knute and Edmond-Ironside; To the Staffordian fields doth rove; Visits the Springs of Trent and Dove; Of Moreland, Cank, and Needwood sings; An end which to this Canto brings. The haughty Cambrian Hills enamor'd of their praise (As they who onely sought ambitiously to raise The blood of god-like Brute) their heads do proudly beare: And having crown'd themselves sole Regents of the Ayre (An other warre with Heaven as though they meant to make) Did seeme in great disdaine the bold affront to take, That any petty hill upon the English side, Should dare, not (with a crouch) to vale unto their pride. When Wrekin, as a hill his proper worth that knew, And understood from whence their insolencie grew, For all that they appear'd so terrible in sight, Yet would not once forgoe a jote that was his right. And when they star'd on him, to them the like he gave, And answer'd glance for glance, and brave againe for brave: That, when some other hills which English dwellers were, The lustie Wrekin saw himselfe so well to beare Against the Cambrian part, respectlesse of their power; His eminent disgrace expecting every howre, Those Flatterers that before (with many cheerfull looke) Had grac't his goodly site, him utterly forsooke, And muffled them in clowds, like Mourners vayl'd in black, Which of their utmost hope attend the ruinous wrack: That those delicious Nymphs, fayre Tearne and Rodon cleere (Two Brooks of him belov'd, and two that held him deare; Hee, having none but them, they having none but hee, Which to their mutuall joy, might eithers object be) Within their secret breasts conceived sundry feares, And as they mixt their streames, for him so mixt their teares. Whom, in their comming downe, when plainly he discernes, For them his nobler hart in his strong bosome earnes: But, constantly resolv'd, that (dearer if they were) The Britains should not yet all from the English beare; Therfore, quoth he, brave Flood, though forth by Out of Plinilimon, in the confines of Cardigan and Montgomery. Cambria brought, Yet as faire Englands friend, or mine thou would'st be thought (O Severne!) let thine eare my just defence partake: Which sayd, in the behalfe of th'English, thus he spake; Wise Weever (I suppose) sufficiently hath said Of those our Princes heere, which fasted, watcht, and pray'd, Whose deepe devotion went for others ventrous deeds: But in this Song of mine, hee seriously that reads, Shall find, ere I have done, the Britaine (so extold, Whose height each Mountaine strives so mainly to up-hold) Matcht with as valiant men, and of as cleane a might, As skilfull to commaund, and as inur'd to fight. Who, when their fortune will'd that after they should scorse Blowes with the big-boan'd Dane, eschanging force for force (When first he put from Sea to forrage on this shore, Two hundred See to the 1. Song. yeeres distain'd with eithers equall gore; Now this aloft, now that: oft did the English raigne, And oftentimes againe depressed by the Dane) The Saxons, then I say, themselves as bravely show'd, As these on whom the Welsh such glorious praise bestow'd. Nor could his angry sword, who Egbert over-threw (Through which he thought at once the Saxons to subdue) His kingly courage quell: but from his short retyre, His reinforced troupes (newe forg'd with sprightly fire) Before them drave the Dane, and made the Britaine runne (Whom he by liberall wage here to his ayde had wonne) Upon their recreant backs, which both in flight were slaine, Till their huge murthered heapes manur'd each neighboring Plaine. As, Ethelwolfe againe, his utmost powers that bent Against those fresh supplies each yeere from Denmarke sent (Which, proling up and downe in their rude Danish ores, Heere put themselves by stealth upon the pestred shores) In many a doubtfull fight much fame in England wan. So did the King of Kent, courageous Athelstan, Which heere against the Dane got such victorious daies. So, we the Wiltshire men as worthily may praise, That buckled with those Danes, by Ceorle and Osrick brought. And Etheldred, with them nine sundry Fields that fought, Recorded in his praise, the conquests of one yeere. You right-nam'd English then, courageous men you were When Redding ye regain'd, led by that valiant Lord: Where Basrig ye out-brav'd, and Halden, sword to sword; The most redoubted spirits that Denmarke heere addrest. And Alured, not much inferior to the rest: Who having in his dayes so many dangers past, In seaven brave foughten Fields their Champion Hubba chac't, And slew him in the end, at Abington, that day Whose like the Sunne nere sawe in his diurnall way: Where those, that from the Field sore wounded sadly fled, Were wel-neere over-whelm'd with mountaines of the dead. His force and fortune made the Foes so much to feare, As they the Land at last did utterly forsweare. And, when proud Rollo, next, their former powers repair'd See to the next Song, of Rollo. (Yea, when the worst of all it with the English far'd) Whose Countries neere at hand, his force did still supply, And Denmarke to her drew the strengths of Normandie, This Prince in many a fight their forces still defy'd. The goodly River Lee he wisely did divide, By which the Danes had then their full-fraught Navies tew'd: The greatnes of whose streame besieged Harford rew'd. This Alfred whose fore-sight had politiquely found Betwixt them and the Thames advantage of the ground, A puissant hand thereto laboriously did put, And into lesser Streames that spacious Current cut. Their ships thus set on shore (to frustrate their desire) Those Danish Hulkes became the food of English fire. Great Alfred left his life: when Elflida up-grew, That farre beyond the pitch of other women flew: Who having in her youth of childing felt the woe, Her Lords imbraces vow'd shee never more would know: But differing from her sexe (as, full of manly fire) This most courageous Queene, by conquest to aspire, The puissant Danish powers victoriously pursu'd, And resolutely heere through their thicke Squadrons hew'd Her way into the North. Where, Darby having wonne, And things beyond beliefe upon the Enemy done, Shee sav'd besieged Yorke; and in the Danes despight, When most they were up-held with all the Easterne might, More Townes and Citties built out of her wealth and power, Then all their hostile flames could any way devour. And, when the Danish heere the Country most destroy'd, Yet all our powers on them not wholly were imploy'd; But some we still reserv'd abroad for us to roame, To fetch-in forraine spoyls, to helpe our losse at home. And all the Land, from us, they neever cleerely wan: But to his endlesse praise, our English Athelstan, In the Northumbrian fields, with most victorious might Put Alaffe and his powers to more inglorious flight; And more then any King of th'English him before, Each way from North to South, from West to th'Easterne shore, Made all the Ile his owne; his seat who firmly fixt, The Calidonian hills, and Cathnes poynt betwixt, And Constantine their King (a prisoner) hither brought; Then over Severns banks the warlike Britains sought: Where he their Princes forc't from that their strong retreat, In England to appeare at his Imperiall seat. But after, when the Danes, who never wearied were, Came with intent to make a generall conquest here, They brought with them a man deem'd of so wondrous might, As was not to be matcht by any mortall wight: For, one could scarcely beare his Ax into the field; Which as a little wand the Dane would lightly wield: And (to enforce that strength) of such a dauntlesse spirit, A man (in their conceit) of so exceeding merit, That to the English oft they offred him (in pride) The ending of the warre by combate to decide: Much scandall which procur'd unto the English name. When, some out of their love, and some spurr'd on with shame, By envy some provokt, some out of courage, faine Would under-take the Cause to combate with the Dane. But Athelstan the while, in settled judgement found, Should the Defendant fayle, how wide and deepe a wound It likely was to leave to his defensive warre. Thus, whilst with sundry doubts his thoughts perplexed are, It pleas'd all-powerfull heaven, that Warwicks famous Guy (The Knight through all the world renown'd for Chivalrie) Arriv'd from forraine parts, where he had held him long. His honorable Armes devoutly having hong In a Religious house, the offrings of his praise, To his Redeemer Christ, his helpe at all assayes (Those Armes, by whose strong proofe he many a Christian freed, And bore the perfect marks of many a worthy deed) Himselfe, a Palmer poore, in homely Russet clad (And onely in his hand his Hermits staffe he had) Tow'rds Winchester alone (so) sadly tooke his way, Where Athelstan, that time the King of England lay; And where the Danish Campe then strongly did abide, Neere to a goodly Meade, which men there call the Hide. The day that Guy arriv'd (when silent night did bring Sleepe both on friend and foe) that most religious King (Whose strong and constant hart, all grievous cares supprest) His due devotion done, betooke himselfe to rest. To whom it seem'd by night an Angell did appeare, Sent to him from that God whom hee invoak't by pray'r; Commaunding him the time not idly to for-slowe, But rathe as hee could rise, to such a gate to goe, Whereas he should not faile to find a goodly Knight In Palmers poore attyre: though very meanly dight, Yet by his comely shape, and limmes exceeding strong, He easely might him know the other folke among; And bad him not to feare, but chuse him for the man. No sooner brake the day, but up rose Athelstan; And as the Vision show'd, he such a Palmer found, With others of his sort, there sitting on the ground: Where, for some poore repast they onely seem'd to stay, Else ready to depart each one upon his way: When secretly the King revealed to the Knight His comfortable dreames that lately passed night: With mild and princely words bespeaking him; quoth hee, Farre better you are knowne to heaven (it seemes) then mee For this great Action fit: by whose most drad command (Before a world of men) it's lay'd upon your hand. Then stout and valiant Knight, heere to my Court repaire, Refresh you in my bathes, and mollifie your care With comfortable wines and meats what you will aske: And chuse my richest Armes to fit you for this taske. The Palmer (gray with age) with countenance lowting lowe, His head even to the earth before the King doth bow, Him softly answering thus; Drad Lord, it fits mee ill (A wretched man) t'oppose high heavens eternall will: Yet my most soveraigne Liege, no more of me esteeme Then this poore habit showes, a Pilgrim as I seeme; But yet I must confesse, have seene in former dayes The best Knights of the world, and scuffled in some frayes. Those times are gone with me; and, beeing aged now, Have offred up my Armes, to Heav'n and made my vow Nere more to beare a Shield, nor my declining age (Except some Palmers Tent, or homely Hermitage) Shall ever enter roofe: but if, by Heaven and thee, This Action be impos'd great English King on mee, Send to the Danish Campe, their challenge to accept, In some convenient place proclaiming it be kept: Where, by th'Almighties power, for England Ile appeare. The King, much pleas'd in mind, assumes his wonted cheere, And to the Danish power his choicest Herault sent, When, both through Campe and Court, this Combat quickly went. Which suddainly divulg'd, whilst every listning eare, As thirsting after newes, desirous was to heare, Who for the English side durst under-take the day; The puissant Kings accord, that in the middle way Betwixt the Tent and Towne, to eithers equall sight, Within a goodly Mead, most fit for such a fight, The Lists should be prepar'd for this materiall prize. The day prefixt once com'n, both Dane and English rise, And to th'appointed place th'unnumbred people throng: The weaker female sex, old men, and children young Into the windowes get, and up on stalls, to see The man on whose brave hand their hope that day must bee, In noting of it well, there might a man behold More sundry formes of feare then thought imagine could. One looks upon his friend with sad and heavy cheere, Who seemes in this distresse a part with him to beare: Their passions doe expresse much pittie mixt with rage. Whilst one his wives laments is labouring to asswage, His little infant neere, in childish gibbridge showes What addeth to his griefe who sought to calme her woes. One having climb'd some roofe, the concourse to discry, From thence upon the earth dejects his humble eye, As since he thither came hee suddainly had found Some danger them amongst which lurkt upon the ground. One stands with fixed eyes, as though he were agast: Another sadly comes, as though his hopes were past. This harkneth with his friend, as though with him to breake Of some intended act. Whilst they together speake, Another standeth neere to listen what they say, Or what should be the end of this so doubtfull day. One great and generall face the gathered people seeme: So that the perfect'st sight beholding could not deeme What lookes most sorrow show'd; their griefes so equall were. Upon the heads of two, whose cheekes were joynd so neere As if together growne, a third his chin doth rest: Another lookes or'e his: and others, hardly prest, Lookt under-neath their armes. Thus, whilst in crowds they throng (Led by the King himselfe) the Champion comes along; A man well strooke in yeeres, in homely Palmers gray, And in his hand his staffe, his reverent steps to stay, Holding a comly pase: which at his passing by, In every censuring tongue, as every serious eye, Compassion mixt with feare, distrust and courage, bred. Then Colebrond for the Danes came forth in irefull red; Before him (from the Campe) an Ensigne first display'd Amidst a guard of gleaves: then sumptuously array'd Were twenty gallant youths, that to the warlike sound Of Danish brazen Drums, with many a loftie bound, Come with their Countries march, as they to Mars should dance. Thus, forward to the fight, both Champions them advance: And each without respect doth resolutely chuse The weapon that he brought, nor doth his foes refuse. The Dane prepares his Axe, that pond'rous was to feele, Whose squares were layd with plates, and rivited with steele, And armed downe along with pykes; whose hardned poynts (Forc't with the weapons weight) had power to teare the joynts Of Curas or of Mayle, or what-so-ere they tooke: Which caus'd him at the Knight disdainfully to looke. When our stout Palmer soone (unknowne for valiant Guy) The cord from his straight loynes doth presently untie, Puts off his Palmers weede unto his trusse, which bore The staines of ancient Armes, but show'd it had before Beene costly cloth of Gold; and off his hood he threw: Out of his Hermits staffe his two-hand sword hee drew (The unsuspected sheath which long to it had beene) Which till that instant time the people had not seene; A sword so often try'd. Then to himselfe, quoth hee, Armes let me crave your ayde, to set my Country free: And never shall my hart your help againe require, But onely to my God to lift you up in pray'r. Here, Colebrond forward made, and soone the Christian Knight Encounters him againe with equall power and spight: Whereas, betwixt them two, might easely have been seene Such blowes, in publique throngs as used had they been, Of many there the least might many men have slaine: Which none but they could strike, nor none but they sustaine; The most relentlesse eye that had the power to awe, And so great wonder bred in those the Fight that saw, As verily they thought, that Nature untill then Had purposely reserv'd the utmost power of men, Where strength still answerd strength, on courage courage grew. Looke how two Lyons fierce, both hungry, both pursue One sweet and selfe-same prey, at one another flie, And with their armed pawes ingrappled dreadfully, The thunder of their rage, and boystrous struggling, make The neighboring Forrests round affrightedly to quake: Their sad encounter, such. The mightie Colebrond stroke A cruell blowe at Guy: which though hee finely broke, Yet (with the weapons weight) his ancient hilt it split, And (thereby lessened much) the Champion lightly hit Upon the reverent brow: immediatly from whence The blood dropt softly downe, as if the wound had sense Of their much inward woe that it with griefe should see. The Danes, a deadly blowe supposing it to bee, Sent such an ecchoing shoute that rent the troubled ayre. The English at the noise, wext all so wan with feare, As though They lost the blood their aged Champion shed: Yet were not these so pale, but th'other were as red; As though the blood that fell, upon their cheekes had staid. Here Guy, his better spirits recalling to his ayde, Came fresh upon his foe; when mightie Colebrond makes An other desperate stroke: which Guy of Warwick takes Undauntedly aloft; and followed with a blowe Upon his shorter ribs, that the excessive flowe Stream'd up unto his hilts: the wound so gap't withall, As though it meant to say, Behold your Champions fall By this proud Palmers hand. Such claps againe and cryes The joyfull English gave as cleft the very skies. Which comming on along from these that were without, When those within the Towne receiv'd this cheerfull shout, They answer'd them with like; as those their joy that knew. Then with such eager blowes each other they pursue, As every offer made, should threaten imminent death; Untill, through heat and toyle both hardly drawing breath, They desperatly doe close. Looke how two Boares, being set Together side to side, their threatning tusks doe whet, And with their gnashing teeth their angry foame doe bite, Whilst still they shouldring seeke, each other where to smite: Thus stood those irefull Knights; till flying back, at length The Palmer, of the two the first recovering strength, Upon the left arme lent great Colebrond such a wound, That whilst his weapons poynt fell wel-neere to the ground, And slowly he it rais'd, the valiant Guy againe Sent through his cloven scalpe his blade into his braine. When downeward went his head, and up his heeles he threw; As wanting hands to bid his Countrimen Adieu. The English part, which thought an end he would have made, And seeming as they much would in his praise have said, He bad them yet forbeare, whilst he pursu'd his fame That to this passed King next in succession came; That great and puissant Knight (in whose victorious dayes Those knight-like deeds were done, no lesse deserving praise) Brave Edmond, Edwards sonne, that Stafford having tane, With as succesfull speed won Darby from the Dane. From Lester then againe, and Lincolne at the length, Drave out the Dacian Powers by his resistlesse strength: And this his England cleer'd beyond that raging Humber. Flood, Which that proud King of Hunnes once christned with his blood. By which, great Edmonds power apparantly was showne, The Land from Humber South recovering for his owne; That Edgar after him so much disdain'd the Dane Unworthy of a warre that should disturbe his raigne, As generally he seem'd regardlesse of their hate. And studying every way magnificence in State, At Chester whilst he liv'd at more then kingly charge, Eight tributary See to the X. Song. Kings there row'd him in his Barge: His shores from Pirats sack the King that strongly kept: A Neptune, whose proud sayles the British Ocean swept. But after his decease, when his more hopefull sonne, By cruell Stepdam's hate, to death was lastly done, To set his rightfull Crowne upon a wrongfull head (When by thy fatall curse, licentious Etheldred, Through dissolutenes, sloth, and thy abhorred life, As greevous were thy sinnes, so were thy sorrowes rife) The Dane, possessing all, the English forc't to beare A heavier yoke then first those Heathen slaveries were; Subjected, bought, and sold, in that most wretched plight, As even their thraldome seem'd their neighbors to affright. Yet could not all their plagues the English height abate: But even in their low'st Eb, and miserablest state, Courageously themselves they into action put, And in one night, the throats of all the Danish cut. And when in their revenge, the most insatiate Dane Unshipt them on our shores, under their puissant Swane: And swolne with hate and ire, their huge unweeldy force, Came clustring like the Greeks out of the Woodden-horse: And the Norfolcian Townes, the neer'st unto the East, With sacriledge and rape did terriblest infest; Those Danes yet from the shores we with such violence drave, That from our swords, their ships could them but hardly save. And to renew the warre, that yeere ensuing, when With fit supplies for spoyle, they landed heere agen, And all the Southerne shores from Kent to Cornwall spred, With those disordred troupes by Alaffe hither led, In seconding their Swane, which cry'd to them for ayde; Their multitudes so much sad Ethelred dismay'd, As from his Country forc't the wretched King to flie. An English yet there was, when England seem'd to lie Under the heaviest yoke that ever kingdome bore, Who washt his secret knife in Swane's relentlesse gore, Whilst (swelling in excesse) his lavish Cups he ply'd. Such meanes t'redeeme themselves th'afflicted Nation try'd. And when courageous Knute, th'late murther'd Swanus sonne, Came in t'revenge that act on his great father done, He found so rare a spirit that heere against him rose, As though ordain'd by Heaven his greatness to oppose: Who with him foot to foot, and face to face durst stand. When Knute, which heere alone affected the Command, The Crowne upon his head at faire South-hampton set: And Edmond, loth to lose what Knute desir'd to get, At London caus'd himselfe inaugurate to bee. King Knute would conquer all, King Edmond would be free. The kingdome is the Prize for which they both are prest: And with their equall powers both meeting in the West, The greene Dorsetian fields a deepe vermillion dy'd: Where Gillingham gave way to their great hostes (in pride) Abundantly their blood that each on other spent. But Edmond, on whose side that day the better went (And with like fortune thought the remnant to suppresse That Sarum then besieg'd, which was in great distresse) With his victorious troupes to Salsbury retires: When with fresh bleeding wounds, Knute, as with fresh desires, Whose might though some-what maym'd, his mind yet unsubdu'd, His lately conquering Foe, courageously pursu'd: And finding out a way, sent to his friends with speed, Who him supply'd with ayde: and being helpt at need, Tempts Edmond still to fight, still hoping for a day. Towards Worstershire their Powers both well upon their way, There, falling to the Field, in a continuall fight Two dayes the angry hosts still parted were by Night: Where twice the rising Sunne, and twice the setting, saw Them with their equall wounds their wearied breath to draw. Great London to surprize, then (next) Canutus makes: And thitherward as fast King Edmond Ironside takes. Whilst Knute set downe his siege before the Easterne gate, King Edmond through the West, past in tryumphall state. But this courageous King, that scorned, in his pride, A Towne should be besieg'd wherein he did abide, Into the fields againe the valiant Edmond goes. Kanutus, yet that hopes to winne what he did lose, Provokes him still to fight: and falling backe where they Might field-roomth find at large, their Ensignes to display, Together flewe againe; that Brentford, with the blood Of Danes and English mixt, discoloured long time stood. Yet Edmond, as before, went Victor still away. When soone that valiant Knute, whom nothing could dismay, Recall'd his scattered troupes, and into Essex hies, Where (as ill fortune would) the Dane with fresh supplies Was lately come a-land, to whom brave Ironside makes; But Knute to him againe as soone fresh courage takes: And Fortune (as her selfe) determining to showe That shee could bring an Eb, on valiant Edmonds Flowe, And easely cast him downe from off the top of Chance, By turning of her wheele, Canutus doth advance. Where shee beheld that Prince which she had favor'd long (Even in her proud despight) his murther'd troupes among With sweat and blood besmear'd (Dukes, Earles, and Bishops slaine, In that most dreadfull day, when all went to the Dane) Through worlds of dangers wade; and with his Sword and Shield, Such wonders there to act as made her in the Field Ashamed of her selfe, so brave a spirit as he By her unconstant hand should so much wronged be. But, having lost the day, to Glocester hee drawes, To raise a second power in his slaine souldiers cause. When late-encourag'd Knute, whilst fortune yet doth last, Who oft from Ironside fled, now followed him as fast. Whilst thus in Civill Armes continually they toyle, And what th'one strives to make, the other seeks to spoyle, With threatning swords still drawne; and with obnoxious hands Attending their revenge, whilst either enemie stands, One man amongst the rest from this confusion breaks, And to the irefull Kings with courage boldly speakes; Yet cannot all this blood your ravenous out-rage fill? Is there no law, no bound, to your ambitious will, But what your swords admit? as Nature did ordaine Our lives for nothing else, but onely to maintaine Your murthers, sack, and spoyle? If by this wastfull warre The Land unpeopled lye, some Nation shall from farre, By ruine of you both, into the Ile be brought, Obtayning that for which you twaine so long have fought. Unlesse then through your thirst of Emperie you meane Both Nations in these broyles shall be extinguisht cleane, Select you Champions fit, by them to prove your right, Or try it man to man your selves in single fight. When as those warlike Kings, provokt with courage hie, It willingly accept in person by and by. And whilst they them prepare, the shapelesse concourse growes In little time so great, that their unusuall flowes Surrounded Severns banks, whose streame amazed stood, Her Birlich to behold, in-Iled with her flood, That with refulgent Armes then flamed; whilst the Kings, Whose rage out of the hate of eithers Empire springs, Both armed, Cap à Pe, upon their barred horse Together fiercely flew; that in their violent course (Like thunder when it speaks most horribly and lowd, Tearing the ful-stuft panch of some congealed clowd) Their strong hoofes strooke the earth: and with the fearfull shock, Their speares in splinters flew, their Bevers both unlock. Canutus, of the two that furthest was from hope, Who found with what a Foe his fortune was to cope, Cryes, noble Edmond, hold; Let us the Land divide. Heere th'English and the Danes, from either equall side Were Ecchoes to his words, and all aloud doe cry, Courageous Kings divide; twere pitty such should die. When now the neighboring Floods, will'd Wrekin to suppresse His style, or they were like to surfet with excesse. And time had brought about, that now they all began To listen to a long told Prophecie, which ran Of Moreland, that shee might live prosperously to see A River borne of her, who well might reccon'd be The third of this large Ile: which Saw did first arise From Arden, in those dayes delivering prophecies. The Druids (as some say) by her instructed were. In many secret skills shee had been cond her lere. The ledden of the Birds most perfectly shee knew: And also from their flight strange Auguries shee drew; Supreamest in her place: whose circuit was extent From Avon to the Banks of Severne and to Trent: Where Empresse like shee sate with Natures bounties blest, And serv'd by many a Nymph; but two, of all the rest, That Staffordshire calls hers, there both of high account. The eld'st of which is Canke: though Needwood her surmount, In excellence of soyle, by beeing richly plac't, Twixt Trent and batning Dove; and, equally imbrac't By their abounding banks, participates their store; Of Britaines Forrests all (from th'lesse unto the more) For finenesse of her turfe surpassing; and doth beare Her curled head so high, that Forrests farre and neere Oft grutch at her estate; her florishing to see, Of all their stately tyers disrobed when they bee. But (as the world goes now) ô wofull Canke the while, As brave a Wood-Nymph once as any of this Ile; Great Ardens eldest child: which, in her mothers ground Before fayre Feck'nhams selfe, her old age might have crownd; When as those fallow Deere, and huge-hancht Stags that graz'd Upon her shaggy Heaths, the passenger amaz'd To see their mighty Heards, with high-palmd heads to threat The woods of o'regrowne Oakes; as though they meant to set Their hornes to th'others heights. But now, both those and these Are by vile gaine devour'd: So abject are our daies. Shee now, unlike her selfe, a Neatheards life doth live, And her dejected mind to Country cares doth give. But Muse, thou seem'st to leave the Morelands too too long: Of whom report may speake (our mightie wastes among) Shee from her chilly site, as from her barren feed, For body, horne, and haire, as faire a Beast doth breed As scarcely this great Ile can equall: then of her, Why should'st thou all this while the prophecie defer? Who bearing many Springs, which pretty Rivers grew, Shee could not be content, untill shee fully knew Which child it was of hers (borne under such a fate) As should in time be rays'd unto that high estate. (I faine would have you thinke, that this was long agoe, When many a River, now that furiously doth flowe, Had scarcely learn'd to creepe) and therefore shee doth will Wise Arden, from the depth of her abundant skill, To tell her which of these her Rills it was shee ment. To satisfie her will, the Wisard answers; Trent. For, as a skilfull Seer, the aged Forrest wist, A more then usuall power did in that name consist, Trent signifieth thirtie. Which thirty doth import; by which she thus divin'd, There should be found in her, of Fishes thirty kind; And thirty Abbeys great, in places fat and ranke, Should in succeeding time be builded on her banke; And thirtie severall Streames from many a sundry way, Unto her greatnesse should their watry tribute pay. This, Moreland greatly lik't: yet in that tender love, Which shee had ever borne unto her darling Dove, Shee could have wisht it his: because the daintie grasse That growes upon his banke, all other doth surpasse. But, subject he must be: as Sow, which from her Spring, At Stafford meeteth Penk, which shee along doth bring To Trent by Tixall grac't, the Astons ancient seat; Which oft the Muse hath found her safe and sweet retreat. The noble Owners now of which beloved place, Good fortunes them and theirs with honor'd titles grace: May heaven still blesse that House, till happy Floods you see Your selves more grac't by it, then it by you can bee. Whose bounty, still my Muse so freely shall confesse, As when she shall want words, her signes shall it expresse. So Blyth beares easely downe tow'rds her deere Soveraigne Trent: But nothing in the world gives Moreland such content As her owne darling Dove his confluence to behold Of Floods in sundry straines: as, crankling Many-fold The first that lends him force: of whose meandred waies, And labyrinth-like turnes (as in the Mores shee straies) Shee first receiv'd her name, by growing strangely mad, Or'e-gone with love of Hanse, a dapper More-land Lad. Who neere their crystall springs as in those wasts they playd, Bewitcht the wanton hart of that delicious mayd: Which instantly was turn'd so much from beeing coy, That shee might seeme to doat upon the Morish boy. Who closely stole away (perceiving her intent) With his deare Lord the Dove, in quest of Princely Trent, With many other Floods (as, Churnet, in his traine That draweth Dunsmore on, with Yendon, then cleere Taine, That comes alone to Dove) of which, Hanse one would bee. And for himselfe he faine of Many-fold would free (Thinking this amorous Nymph by some meanes to beguile) He closely under earth convayes his head awhile. But, when the River feares some policie of his, And her beloved Hanse immediatly doth miss, Distracted in her course, improvidently rash, Shee oft against the Cleeves her crystall front doth dash: Now forward, then againe shee backward seemes to beare; As, like to lose her selfe by straggling heere and there. Hanse, that this while suppos'd him quite out of her sight, No sooner thrusts his head into the cheerfull light, But Many-fold that still the Run-away doth watch, Him (ere he was aware) about the neck doth catch: And, as the angry Hanse would faine her hold remove, They struggling tumble downe into their Lord, the Dove. Thus though th'industrious Muse hath been imploy'd so long, Yet is shee loth to doe poore little Smestall wrong, That from her Wilfrunes Spring neere Hampton plyes, to pour The wealth shee there receives, into her friendly Stowr. Nor shall the little Bourne have cause the Muse to blame, From these Staffordian Heathes that strives to catch the Tame: Whom shee in her next Song shall greet with mirthfull cheere, So happily arriv'd now in her native Shire. The thirteenth Song. The Argument. This Song our Shire of Warwick sounds; Revives old Ardens ancient bounds. Through many shapes the Muse heere roves; Now sporting in those shady Groves, The tunes of Birds oft staies to heare: Then, finding Herds of lustie Deare, She Huntresse-like the Hart pursues; And like a Hermit walks, to chuse The Simples every where that growe; Comes Ancors glory next to showe; Tells Guy of Warwicks famous deeds; To th'Vale of Red-horse then proceeds, To play her part the rest among; There shutteth up her thirteenth Song. Upon the Mid-lands now th'industrious Muse doth fall; That Shire which wee the hart of England well may call, Warwickshire the middle Shire of England. As shee her selfe extends (the midst which is decreed) Betwixt S. Michaels Mount, and Barwick-bord'ring Tweed, Brave Warwick; that abroad so long advanc't her The ancient Coat of that Earldome. Beare, By her illustrious Earles renowned every where; Above her neighboring Shires which alwaies bore her head. My native Country then, which so brave spirits hast bred, If there be vertue yet remaining in thy earth, Or any good of thine thou breathd'st into my birth, Accept it as thine owne whilst now I sing of thee; Of all thy later Brood th'unworthiest though I bee. Muse, first of Arden tell, whose foot-steps yet are found Divers Towns expressing her name: as Henly in Arden, Hampton in Arden. &amp;c. In her rough wood-lands more then any other ground That mighty Arden held even in her height of pride; Her one hand touching Trent, the other, Severns side. The very sound of these, the Wood-Nymphs doth awake: When thus of her owne selfe the ancient Forrest spake; My many goodly sites when first I came to showe, Here opened I the way to myne owne over-throwe: For, when the world found out the fitnesse of my soyle, The gripple wretch began immediatly to spoyle My tall and goodly woods, and did my grounds inclose: By which, in little time my bounds I came to lose. When Britaine first her fields with Villages had fild, Her people wexing still, and wanting where to build, They oft dislodg'd the Hart, and set their houses, where He in the Broome and Brakes had long time made his leyre. Of all the Forrests heere within this mightie Ile, If those old Britains then me Soveraigne did instile, I needs must be the great'st; for greatnesse tis alone That gives our kind the place: else were there many a one For pleasantnes of shade that farre doth mee excell. But, of our Forrests kind the quality to tell, We equally partake with Wood-land as with Plaine, Alike with Hill and Dale; and every day maintaine The sundry kinds of beasts upon our copious wast's, That men for profit breed, as well as those of chase. Here Arden of her selfe ceast any more to showe; And with her Sylvan joyes the Muse along doth goe. When Phœbus lifts his head out of the Winters wave, No sooner doth the Earth her flowerie bosome brave, At such time as the Yeere brings on the pleasant Spring, But Hunts-up to the Morne the feath'red Sylvans sing: And in the lower Grove, as on the rising Knole, Upon the highest spray of every mounting pole, Those Quirristers are pearcht with many a speckled breast. Then from her burnisht gate the goodly glittring East Guilds every lofty top, which late the humorous Night Bespangled had with pearle, to please the Mornings sight: On which the mirthfull Quires, with their cleere open throats, Unto the joyfull Morne so straine their warbling notes, That Hills and Valleys ring, and even the ecchoing Ayre Seemes all compos'd of sounds, about them every where. The Throstell, with shrill Sharps; as purposely he song T'awake the lustlesse Sunne; or chyding, that so long He was in comming forth, that should the thickets thrill: The Woosell neere at hand, that hath a golden bill; As Nature him had markt of purpose, t'let us see That from all other Birds his tunes should different bee: For, with their vocall sounds, they sing to pleasant May; Upon his Of all Birds, only the Blackbird whistleth. dulcet pype the Merle doth onely play. When in the lower Brake, the Nightingale hard-by, In such lamenting straines the joyfull howres doth ply, As though the other Birds shee to her tunes would draw. And, but that Nature (by her all-constraining law) Each Bird to her owne kind this season doth invite, They else, alone to heare that Charmer of the Night (The more to use their eares) their voyces sure would spare, That moduleth her tunes so admirably rare, As man to set in Parts, at first had learn'd of her. To Philomell the next, the Linet we prefer; And by that warbling bird, the Wood-Larke place we then, The Red-sparrow, the Nope, the Red-breast, and the Wren, The Yellow-pate: which though shee hurt the blooming tree, Yet scarce hath any bird a finer pype then shee. And of these chaunting Fowles, the Goldfinch not behind, That hath so many sorts descending from her kind. The Tydie for her notes as delicate as they, The laughing Hecco, then the counterfetting Jay, The Softer, with the Shrill (some hid among the leaves, Some in the taller trees, some in the lower greaves) Thus sing away the Morne, untill the mounting Sunne, Through thick exhaled fogs, his golden head hath runne, And through the twisted tops of our close Covert creeps To kisse the gentle Shade, this while that sweetly sleeps. And neere to these our Thicks, the wild and frightfull Heards, Not hearing other noyse but this of chattering Birds, Feed fairely on the Launds; both sorts of seasoned Deere: Here walke, the stately Red, the freckled Fallowe there: The Bucks and lusty Stags amongst the Rascalls strew'd, As sometime gallant spirits amongst the multitude. Of all the Beasts which we for our Of hunting, or Chase. veneriall name, The Hart amongst the rest, the Hunters noblest game: Of which most Princely Chase sith none did ere report, Or by description touch, t'expresse that wondrous sport (Yet might have well beseem'd th'ancients nobler Songs) To our old Arden heere, most fitly it belongs: Yet shall shee not invoke the Muses to her ayde; But thee Diana bright, a Goddesse and a mayd: In many a huge-growne Wood, and many a shady Grove, Which oft hast borne thy Bowe (great Huntresse) us'd to rove At many a cruell beast, and with thy darts to pierce The Lyon, Panther, Ounce, the Beare, and Tiger fierce; And following thy fleet Game, chaste mightie Forrests Queene, With thy disheveld Nymphs attyr'd in youthfull greene, About the Launds hast scowr'd, and Wastes both farre and neere, Brave Huntresse: but no beast shall prove thy Quarries heere; Save those the best of Chase, the tall and lusty Red, The Stag for goodly shape, and statelinesse of head, Is fitt'st to hunt at force. For whom, when with his hounds A description of hunting the Hart.The laboring Hunter tufts the thicke unbarbed grounds Where harbor'd is the Hart; there often from his feed The dogs of him doe find; or thorough skilfull heed, The Huntsman by his The tract of the foote. slot, or breaking earth, perceaves, Or entring of the thicke by pressing of the greaves Where he hath gone to lodge. Now when the Hart doth heare The often-bellowing hounds to vent his secret leyre, He rouzing rusheth out, and through the Brakes doth drive, As though up by the roots the bushes he would rive. And through the combrous thicks, as fearefully he makes, Hee with his branched head, the tender Saplings shakes, That sprinkling their moyst pearle doe seeme for him to weepe; When after goes the Cry, with yellings lowd and deepe, That all the Forrest rings, and every neighbouring place: And there is not a hound but falleth to the Chase. One of the Measures in winding the horne.Rechating with his horne, which then the Hunter cheeres, Whilst still the lustie Stag his high-palm'd head up-beares, His body showing state, with unbent knees upright, Expressing (from all beasts) his courage in his flight. But when th'approaching foes still following he perceives, That hee his speed must trust, his usuall walke he leaves; And or'e the Champaine flies: which when th'assembly find, Each followes, as his horse were footed with the wind. But beeing then imbost, the noble stately Deere When he hath gotten ground (the kennell cast arere) Doth beat the Brooks and Ponds for sweet refreshing soyle: That serving not, then proves if he his sent can foyle, And makes amongst the Heards, and flocks of shag-wooll'd Sheepe, Them frighting from the guard of those who had their keepe. But when as all his shifts his safety still denies, Put quite out of his walke, the wayes and fallowes tryes. Whom when the Plow-man meets, his teame he letteth stand T'assaile him with his goad: so with his hooke in hand, The Shepheard him pursues, and to his dog doth halow: When, with tempestuous speed, the hounds and Huntsmen follow; Untill the noble Deere through toyle bereav'd of strength, His long and sinewy legs then fayling him at length, The Villages attempts, enrag'd, not giving way To any thing hee meets now at his sad decay. The cruell ravenous hounds and bloody Hunters neer, This noblest beast of Chase, that vainly doth but feare, Some banke or quick-set finds: to which his hanch oppos'd, He turnes upon his foes, that soone have him inclos'd. The churlish throated hounds then holding him at bay, And as their cruell fangs on his harsh skin they lay, With his sharp-poynted head he dealeth deadly wounds. The Hunter, comming in to helpe his wearied hounds, He desperatly assailes; untill opprest by force, The Hart weepeth at his dying: his teares are held to be precious in medicine. He who the Mourner is to his owne dying Corse, Upon the ruthlesse earth his precious teares lets fall. To Forrests that belongs; but yet this is not all: With solitude what sorts, that here's not wondrous rife? Whereas the Hermit leades a sweet retyred life, From Villages repleate with ragg'd and sweating Clownes, And from the lothsome ayres of smoky cittied Townes. Suppose twixt noone and night, the Sunne his halfe-way wrought (The shadowes to be large, by his descending brought) A description of the afternoone. Who with a fervent eye lookes through the twyring glades, And his dispersed rayes commixeth with the shades, Exhaling the milch dewe, which there had tarried long, And on the ranker grasse till past the noone-sted hong; When as the Hermet comes out of his homely Cell, Where from all rude resort he happily doth dwell: Hermits have oft had their aboads by waies that lie throgh Forests. Who in the strength of youth, a man at Armes hath been; Or one who of this world the vilenesse having seene, Retyres him from it quite; and with a constant mind Mans beastliness so loathes, that flying humane kind, The black and darksome nights, the bright and gladsome dayes Indifferent are to him, his hope on God that staies. Each little Village yeelds his short and homely fare: To gather wind-falne sticks, his great'st and onely care; Which every aged tree still yeeldeth to his fire. This man, that is alone a King in his desire, By no proud ignorant Lord is basely over-aw'd, Nor his false prayse affects, who grosly beeing claw'd, Stands like an itchy Moyle; nor of a pin he wayes What fooles, abused Kings, and humorous Ladies raise. His free and noble thought, nere envies at the grace That often times is given unto a Baud most base, Nor stirres it him to thinke on the Impostour vile, Who seeming what hee's not, doth sensually beguile The sottish purblind world: but absolutely free, His happy time he spends the works of God to see, In those so sundry hearbs which there in plenty growe: Whose sundry strange effects he onely seeks to knowe. And in a little Maund, beeing made of Oziars small, Which serveth him to doe full many a thing withall, He very choicely sorts his Simples got abroad. Heere finds he on an Oake Rheume-purging Polipode; And in some open place that to the Sunne doth lye, He Fumitorie gets, and Eye-bright for the eye: The Yarrow, where-with-all he stops the wound-made gore: The healing Tutsan then, and Plantan for a sore. And hard by them againe he holy Vervaine finds, Which he about his head that hath the Megrim binds. The wonder-working Dill hee gets not farre from these, Which curious women use in many a nice disease. For them that are with Newts, or Snakes, or Adders stong, He seeketh out an hearbe that's called Adders-tong; As Nature it ordain'd, its owne like hurt to cure, And sportive did her selfe to niceties inure. Valerian then he crops, and purposely doth stampe, T'apply unto the place that's haled with the Crampe. As Century, to close the wideness of a wound: The belly hurt by birth, by Mugwort to make sound. His Chickweed cures the heat that in the face doth rise. For Physick, some againe he inwardly applyes. For comforting the Spleene and Liver, gets for juce, Pale Hore-hound, which he holds of most especiall use. So Saxifrage is good, and Harts-tongue for the Stone, With Agrimony, and that hearbe we call S. John. To him that hath a flux, of Sheepheards purse he gives, And Mous-eare unto him whom some sharpe rupture grieves. And for the laboring wretch that's troubled with a cough, Or stopping of the breath, by fleagme that's hard and tough, Campana heere he crops, approoved wondrous good: As Comfrey unto him that's brused, spetting blood; And from the Falling-ill, by Five-leafe doth restore, And Melancholy cures by soveraigne Hellebore. Of these most helpfull hearbs yet tell we but a few, To those unnumbred sorts of Simples here that grew. Which justly to set downe, even Dodon short doth fall; The Authors of two famous Herbals. Nor skilfull Gerard, yet, shall ever find them all. But from our Hermit heere the Muse we must inforce, And zealously proceed in our intended course: How Arden of her Rills and Riverets doth dispose; By Alcester how Alne to Arro easely flowes; And mildly beeing mixt, to Avon hold their way: And likewise tow'rd the North, how lively-tripping Rhea, T'attend the lustier Tame, is from her Fountaine sent: So little Cole and Blyth goe on with him to Trent. His Tamworth at the last, he in his way doth win: There playing him awhile, till Ancor should come in, Which trifleth twixt her banks, observing state, so slowe, As though into his armes she scorn'd her selfe to throwe: Yet Arden will'd her Tame to serve Ancor. her on his knee; For by that Nymph alone, they both should honor'd be. The Forrest so much falne from what she was before, That to her former height Fate could her not restore; Though oft in her behalfe, the Genius of the Land Importuned the Heavens with an auspicious hand. Yet granted at the last (the aged Nymph to grace) They by a Ladies birth would more renowne that place Then if her Woods their heads above the Hills should seat; And for that purpose, first made Coventry so great (A poore thatcht Village then, or scarcely none at all, That could not once have dream'd of her now stately wall) And thither wisely brought that goodly Virgin-band, Th'eleven thousand maids, chaste Ursula's Commaund, Whom then the Britaine Kings gave her full power to presse, For matches to their friends in Britanny the lesse. At whose departure thence, each by her just bequest Some speciall vertue gave, ordayning it to rest With one of their owne sex, that there her birth should have, Till fulnesse of the time which Fate did choicely save; Untill the Saxons raigne, when Coventry at length, From her small, meane regard, recovered state and strength, By Leofrick her Lord yet in base bondage held, The people from her Marts by tollage who expeld: Whose Dutchesse, which desir'd this tribute to release, Their freedome often begg'd. The Duke, to make her cease, Told her that if shee would his losse so farre inforce, His will was, shee should ride starke nak't upon a horse By day light through the street: which certainly he thought, In her heroïck breast so deeply would have wrought, That in her former sute she would have left to deale. But that most princely Dame, as one devour'd with zeale, Went on, and by that meane the Cittie cleerly freed. The first part of whose name, Godiva, doth forereed Th'first syllable of hers, and Goodere halfe doth sound; For by agreeing words, great matters have been found. But further then this place the mysterie extends. What Arden had begun, in Ancor lastly ends: For in the British tongue, the Britaines could not find, Wherefore to her that name of Ancor was assign'd: Nor yet the Saxons since, nor times to come had known, But that her beeing heere, was by this name fore-shown, As prophecying her. For, as the first did tell Her Sir-name, so againe doth Ancor lively spell Her Christned title Anne. And as those Virgins there Did sanctifie that Place: so holy Edith heere A Recluse long time liv'd, in that faire Abbey plac't Which Alured enricht, and Powlesworth highly grac't. A Princesse being borne, and Abbesse, with those Maids, All Noble like her selfe, in bidding of their Beads Their holinesse bequeath'd, upon her to descend Which there should after live: in whose deere selfe should end Th'intent of Ancors name, her comming that decreed, As hers (her place of birth) faire Coventry that freed. But whilst about this tale smooth Ancor tryfling stayes, Unto the lustier Tame as loth to come her waies, The Flood intreats her thus; Deere Brooke, why doost thou wrong Our mutuall love so much, and tediously prolong Our mirthfull mariage-howre, for which I still prepare? Haste to my broader banks, my joy and onely care. For as of all my Floods thou art the first in fame; When frankly thou shalt yeeld thine honor to my name, I will protect thy state: then doe not wrong thy kind. What pleasure hath the world that heere thou maist not find? Hence, Muse, divert thy course to Dunsmore, by that The High-crosse, supposed to be the midst of England. Crosse Where those two mightie See to the xvi. Song. waies, the Watling and the Fosse, Our Center seeme to cut. (The first doth hold her way, From Dover, to the farth'st of fruitfull Anglesey: The second South and North, from Michaels utmost Mount, To Cathnesse, which the furth'st of Scotland wee account.) And then proceed to showe, how Avon from her Spring, By Newnhams Fount is blest; and how she, blandishing, Newnham Wells. By Dunsmore drives along. Whom Sow doth first assist, Which taketh Shirburn in, with Cune, a great while mist; Though Otherwise, Cune-tre: that is, the Towne upon Cune. Coventry from thence her name at first did raise, Now florishing with Fanes, and proud Piramides; Her walls in good repaire, her Ports so bravely built, Her halls in good estate, her Crosse so richly gilt, As scorning all the Townes that stand within her view: Yet must shee not be griev'd, that Cune should claime her due. Tow'rds Warwick with this traine as Avon trips along, To Guy-cliffe beeing come, her Nymphs thus bravely song; To thee renowned Knight, continuall prayse wee owe, And at thy hallowed Tombe thy yeerely Obiits showe; Who, thy deere Phillis name and Country to advance, Left'st Warwicks wealthy seate: and sayling into France, At Tilt, from his proud Steed, Duke Otton threw'st to ground: And with th'invalewed Prize of Blanch the beautious crown'd (The Almaine Emperors heire) high acts didst there atchieve: As Lovaine thou againe didst valiantly relieve. Thou in the Soldans blood thy worthy sword imbru'dst; And then in single fight, great Amerant subdu'dst. T'was thy Herculian hand, which happily destroy'd That Dragon, which so long Northumberland annoy'd; And slew that cruell Bore, which waste our wood-lands layd, Whose tusks turn'd up our Tilths, and Dens in Medowes made: Whose shoulder-blade remaines at Coventry till now; And, at our humble sute, did quell that monstrous Cow The passengers that us'd from Dunsmore to affright. Of all our English (yet) ô most renowned Knight, That Colebrond overcam'st: at whose amazing fall The Danes remov'd their Campe from Winchesters sieg'd wall. Thy statue Guy-cliffe keepes, the gazers eye to please; Warwick, thy mighty Armes (thou English Hercules) Thy strong and massy sword, that never was controld: Which, as her ancient right, her Castle still shall hold. Scarce ended they their Song, but Avons winding streame, By Warwick, entertaines the high-complection'd Leame: And as she thence along to Stratford on doth straine, Receiveth little Heile the next into her traine: Then taketh in the Stour, the Brooke, of all the rest Which that most goodly Vale of Red-horse loveth best; A Vally that enjoyes a verie great estate, Yet not so famous held as smaller, by her fate: Now, for Report had been too partiall in her praise, Her just conceived greefe, faire Red-horse thus bewraies; Shall every Vale be heard to boast her wealth? and I, The needie Countries neere that with my Corne supply As bravely as the best, shall onely I endure The dull and beastly world my glories to obscure; Neere way-lesse Ardens side, sith my rety'rd aboad Stood quite out of the way from every common road? Great Evshams fertill Gleabe, what tongue hath not extold? As though to her alone belongd the The Sheafe. Garbe of Gold. Of Bevers batfull earth, men seeme as though to faine, Reporting in what store shee multiplies her graine: And folke such wondrous things of Alsburie will tell, As though Aboundance strove her burthened wombe to swell. Her roome amongst the rest, so White-horse is decreed: Shee wants no setting forth: her brave Pegasian Steed (The wonder of the West) exalted to the skies: My Red-horse of you all contemned onely lies. The fault is not in me, but in the wretched time: On whom, upon good cause, I well may lay the crime: Which as all noble things, so mee it doth neglect. But when th'industrious Muse shall purchase me respect Of Countries neere my site, and win me forraine fame (The Eden of you all deservedly that am) I shall as much be praysd for delicacie then, As now in small account with vile and barbarous men. For, from the loftie The Edge-hil Edge that on my side doth lye, Upon my spacious earth who casts a curious eye, As many goodly seates shall in my compasse see, As many sweet delights and rarities in mee As in the greatest Vale: from where my head I couch At Cotswolds Countries foot, till with my heeles I touch The bounds of the Vale of Red-horse. The North-hamptonian fields, and fatning Pastures; where I ravish every eye with my inticing cheere. As still the Yeere growes on, that Ceres once doth load The full Earth with her store; my plentious bosome strow'd With all aboundant sweets: my frim and lustie flanke Her bravery then displayes, with Meadowes hugely ranke. The thick and well-growne fogge doth matt my smoother slades, And on the lower Leas, as on the higher Hades The daintie Clover growes (of grasse the onely silke) That makes each Udder strout abundantly with milke. As an unlettred man, at the desired sight A Similie of the place and people. Of some rare beautie moov'd with infinite delight, Not out of his owne spirit, but by that power divine, Which through a sparkling eye perspicuously doth shine, Feeles his hard temper yeeld, that hee in passion breakes, And things beyond his height, transported strangely speaks: So those that dwell in mee, and live by frugall toyle, When they in my defence are reasoning of my soyle, As rapted with my wealth and beauties, learned growe, And in wel-fitting tearmes, and noble language, showe The Lordships in my Lands, from Rolright (which remaines A witnesse of that day we wonne upon the Danes) To Tawcester wel-neere: twixt which, they use to tell Of places which they say doe Rumneys selfe excell. Of Dasset they dare boast, and give Wormlighton prize, Wondrous fruitful places in the Vale. As of that fertill Flat by Bishopton that lies. For showing of my bounds, if men may rightly ghesse By my continued forme which best doth me expresse, On either of my sides and by the rising grounds, Which in one fashion hold, as my most certaine Mounds, In length neere thirtie miles I am discern'd to bee. Thus Red-horse ends her tale; and I therewith agree To finish heere my Song: the Muse some ease doth aske, As wearied with the toyle in this her serious taske. The fourteenth song. The Argument. Her sundry straines the Muse to prove, Now sings of homely Country love; What moane th'old Heardsman Clent doth make, For his coy Wood-Nymph Feckn'hams sake; And, how the Nymphs each other greet, When Avon and brave Severne meet. The Vale of Evsham then doth tell, How farre the Vales doe Hills excell. Ascending, next, faire Cotswolds Plaines, Shee revels with the Shepheards swaines; And sends the daintie Nymphes away, Gainst Tame and Isis Wedding day. At length, attain'd those Lands that South of Severne lye, As to the varying Earth the Muse doth her apply, Poore Sheep-hook and plaine Goad, she many times doth sound: Then in a Buskind strain she instantly doth bound. Smooth as the lowly streame, shee softly now doth glide: And with the Mountaines straight contendeth in her pride. Now back againe I turne, the Land with mee to take, From the Staffordian heaths as Running by Sturbridge in Worstershire, towards Severne. Stour her course doth make. Which Clent, from his proud top, contentedly doth view: But yet the aged Hill, immoderatly doth rew His loved Feckn'hams fall, and doth her state bemoane; To please his amorous eye, whose like the world had none. For, from her very youth, he (then an aged Hill) Had to that Forrest-Nymph a speciall lyking still: The least regard of him who never seemes to take, But suffreth in her selfe for Salwarp's onely sake; And on that River doats, as much as Clent on her. Now, when the Hill perceiv'd, the Flood she would prefer, All pleasure he forsakes; that at the full-bagd Cow, Or at the curle-fac't Bull, when venting he doth low, Or at th'unhappy wags, which let their Cattell stray, At Nine-holes on the heath whilst they together play, He never seemes to smile; nor ever taketh keepe To heare the harmlesse Swaine pype to his grazing sheepe: Nor to the Carters tune, in whistling to his Teame; Nor lends his listning eare (once) to the ambling Streame, That in the evening calme against the stones doth rush With such a murmuring noyse, as it would seeme to hush The silent Meads asleepe; but, voyd of all delight, Remedilesly drown'd in sorrow day and night, Nor Licky his Allie and neighbour doth respect: And there-with beeing charg'd, thus answereth in effect; That The Lickey, supposed to be the highest ground of this Ile not being a Mountaine. Lickey to his height seem'd slowly but to rise, And that in length and bredth he all extended lyes, Nor doth like other hills to suddaine sharpnesse mount, That of their kingly kind they scarce can him account; Though by his swelling soyle set in so high a place, That Malverns mightie selfe he seemeth to out-face. Whilst Clent and Licky thus, doe both expresse their pride, The Salt Fountaine of Worcestershire.As Salwarpe slips along by Feck'nhams shady side, That Forrest him affects in wandring to the Wych: But he, himselfe by Salts there seeking to enrich, His Feck'nham quite forgets; from all affection free. But she, that to the Flood most constant meanes to be, More prodigally gives her woods to those strong fires Which boyle the source to Salts. Which Clent so much admires, That love, and her disdaine, to madness him provoke: When to the Wood-Nymph thus the jealous Mountaine spoke; Fond Nymph, thy twisted curles, on which were all my care, Thou lett'st the Furnace waste; that miserably bare I hope to see thee left, which so doost mee despise; Whose beauties many a morne have blest my longing eyes: And, till the wearie Sunne sunk downe unto the West, Thou still my object wast, thou once my onely best. The time shall quickly come, thy Groves and pleasant Springs, Where to the mirthfull Merle the warbling Mavis sings, The painfull laborers hand shall stock the roots, to burne; The branch and body spent, yet could not serve his turne. Which when, most wilfull Nymph, thy chaunce shal be to see, Too late thou shalt repent thy small regard of mee. But Saltwarpe downe from Wyche his nimbler feet doth ply, Great Severne to attend, along to Teuksbury, With others to partake the joy that there is seene, When beautious Avon comes unto her soveraigne Severne. Queene. Heere downe from Evshams Vale, their greatnesse to attend, Comes Swilliat sweeping in, which Cotswold downe doth send: And Garran there arrives, the great recourse to see. Where thus together met, with most delightfull glee, The cheerfull Nymphs that haunt the Valley rank and lowe (Where full Pomona seemes most plentiously to flowe, And with her fruitery swells by Pershore, in her pride) Amongst the batfull Meads on Severns either side, To these their confluent Floods, full Boaules of Pery brought: Where, to each others health past many a deep-fetcht draught, And many a sound Carouse from friend to friend doth goe. Thus whilst the mellowed Earth with her owne juice doth flowe, Inflamed with excesse the lustie pampred Vale, In praise of her great selfe, thus frames her glorious tale; I doubt not but some Vale enough for us hath said, To answer them that most with basenesse us upbray'd; Those high presumptuous Hills, which bend their utmost might, Us onely to deject, in their inveterate spight: But I would have them thinke, that I (which am the Queene Of all the British Vales, and so have ever beene Since Gomers Giant-brood inhabited this Ile, And that of all the rest, my selfe may so enstile) Against the highest Hill dare put my selfe for place, That ever threatned Heaven with the austerest face. And for our praise, then thus; What Fountaine send they forth (That finds a Rivers name, though of the smallest worth) But it invales it selfe, and on it either side Doth make those fruitfull Meads, which with their painted pride Imbroader his proud Banke? whilst in lascivious Gyres He swiftly sallieth out, and suddainly retyres In sundry works and trailes, now shallowe, and then deepe, Searching the spacious shores, as though it meant to sweepe Their sweets with it away, with which they are repleat. And men, first building Townes, themselves did wisely seat Still in the bountious Vale: whose burthened Pasture beares The most aboundant swathe, whose Gleabe such goodly eares, As to the weightie sheafe with sythe or sickle cut, When as his hardned hand the Labourer comes to put, Sinks him in his owne sweat, which it but hardly wields: And on the Corne-strew'd Lands, then in the stubble fields, There feed the Heards of Neat, by them the Flocks of Sheep, Seeking the scatt'red Corne upon the ridges steepe: And in the furrowe by (where Ceres lyes much spild) Th'unweldy larding Swine his mawe then having fild, Lies wallowing in the myre, thence able scarce to rise. When as those monstrous Hills so much that us despise (The Mountaine, which forsooth the lowly Valley mocks) Have nothing in the world upon their barren Rocks, But greedy clambring Goats, and Conies, banisht quite From every fertill place; as Rascals, that delight In base and barren plots, and at good earth repine. And though in Winter we to moysture much incline, Yet those that be our owne, and dwell upon our Land, When twixt their burly Stacks, and full-stuft Barnes they stand, Into the softer Clay as easely they doe sinke, Pluck up their heavie feet, with lighter spirits, to thinke That Autumne shall produce, to recompence their toyle, A rich and goodly croppe from that unpleasant soyle. And from that envious Foe which seekes us to deprave, Though much against his will this good we cleerly have, We still are highly prais'd, and honor'd by his hight. For, who will us survey, their cleere and judging sight May see us thence at full: which else the searchingst eye, By reason that so flat and levelled we lie, Could never throughly view, our selves nor could we showe. Yet more; what lofty Hills to humble Valleys owe, And what high grace they have which neere to us are plac't, In A Hill invironed on every side with the Vale of Evsham. Breedon may be seene, beeing amorously imbrac't In cincture of mine armes. Who though he doe not vaunt His head like those that looke as they would Heaven supplant: Yet let them wisely note, in what excessive pride He in my bosome sits; while him on every side With my delicious sweets and delicates I trym. And when great Malvern looks most terrible and grym, Hee with a pleased brow continually doth smile. Heere Breedon, having heard his praises all the while, Grew insolently proud; and doth upon him take Such state, as he would seeme but small account to make Of Malvern, or of Mein. So that the wiser Vale, To his instruction turnes the processe of her tale. T'avoyd the greaters wrath, and shunne the meaners hate, Quoth shee, take my advice, abandon idle state; And by that way I goe, doe thou thy course contrive: Give others leave to vaunt, and let us closely thrive. Whilst idly but for place the loftie Mountaines toyle, Let us have store of graine, and quantity of soyle. To what end serve their tops (that seeme to threat the skie) But to be rent with stormes? whilst we in safety lie. Their Rocks but barren be, and they which rashly clime, Stand most in Envies sight, the fairest prey for Time. And when the lowely Vales are clad in Sommers greene, The grisled Winters snowe upon their heads is seene. Of all the Hills I knowe, let Mein thy patterne bee: Who though his site be such as seemes to equall thee, And destitute of nought that Arden him can yeeld; Nor of th'especiall grace of many a goodly field; Nor of deere Cliffords seat (the place of health and sport) Which many a time hath been the Muses quiet Port. Yet brags not he of that, nor of himselfe esteemes The more for his faire site; but richer then he seemes, Clad in a gowne of Grasse, so soft and wondrous warme, As him the Sommers heat, nor Winters cold can harme. Of whom I well may say, as I may speake of thee; From either of your tops, that who beholdeth mee, To Paradise may thinke a second hee had found, If any like the first were ever on the ground. Her long and zealous speech thus Evsham doth conclude: When straight the active Muse industriously pursu'd This noble Countries praise, as matter still did rise. For Gloster in times past her selfe did highly prize, When in her pride of strength she nourisht goodly Vines, And oft her cares represt with her delicious Wines. But, now th'All-cheering Sun the colder soyle deceaves, And us (heere tow'rds the Pole) still falling South-ward leaves: So that the sullen earth th'effect thereof doth prove; According to their Books, who hold that he doth move From his first Zeniths poynt; the cause we feele his want. But of her Vines depriv'd, now Gloster learnes to plant The Peare-tree every where: whose fruit shee straines for juce, That her pur'st Pery is, which first shee did produce From Worstershire, and there is common as the fields; Which naturally that soyle in most aboundance yeelds. But the laborious Muse, which still new worke assaies, Here sallyeth through the slades, where beautious Severne playes, Untill that River gets her Glosters wished sight: Where, she her streame divides, that with the more delight Shee might behold the Towne, of which shee's wondrous proud: Then takes shee in the Frome, then Cam, and next the Strowd, As thence upon her course she wantonly doth straine. Supposing then her selfe a Sea-god by her traine, Shee Neptune-like doth float upon the bracky Marsh. Where, least shee should become too combersome and harsh, Faire Micklewood (a Nymph, long honor'd for a Chase, Contending to have stood the high'st in Severns grace, Of any of the Dryad's there bordring on her shore) With her coole amorous shades, and all her Sylvan store, To please the goodly Flood imployes her utmost powers, Supposing the proud Nymph might like her woody Bowers. But Severne (on her way) so large and head-strong grew, That shee the Wood-Nymph scornes, and Avon doth pursue; A River with no lesse then goodly Kings-wood crown'd, A Forrest and a Flood by eithers fame renown'd; And each with others pride and beautie much bewitcht; Besides, with Bristowes state both wondrously enricht. Kings Road.Which soone to Severne sent th'report of that faire Road (So burthened still with Barks, as it would over-load Great Neptune with the weight) whose fame so farre doth ring. When as that mightie Flood, most bravely florishing, Like Thetis goodlie selfe, majestically glides; Upon her spacious breast tossing the surgefull Tydes, To have the River see the state to which shee growes, And how much to her Queene the beautious Avon owes. But, noble Muse, proceed immediatly to tell How Evshams fertile Vale at first in liking fell With Cotswold, that great King of Shepheards: whose proud site When that faire Vale first saw, so nourisht her delight, That him she onely lov'd: for wisely shee beheld The beauties cleane throughout that on his sur-face dweld: Of just and equall height two banks arising, which Grew poore (as it should seeme) to make some Valley rich: Betwixt them thrusting out an Elbowe of such height, A nice description of Cotswold. As shrowds the lower soyle; which, shadowed from the light, Shootes forth a little Grove, that in the Sommers day Invites the Flocks, for shade that to the Covert stray. A Hill there holds his head, as though it told a tale, Or stooped to looke downe, or whisper with a Vale; Where little purling winds like wantons seeme to dally, And skip from Bank to Banke, from Valley trip to Valley. Such sundry shapes of soyle where Nature doth devise, That she may rather seeme fantasticall, then wise. T'whom Sarum's Plaine gives place: though famous for her Flocks, Yet hardly doth she tythe our Cotswolds wealthy locks. Though Lemster him exceed for finenesse of her ore, Yet quite he puts her downe for his aboundant store. A match so fit as hee, contenting to her mind, Few Vales (as I suppose) like Evsham hapt to find: Nor any other Wold, like Cotswold ever sped, So faire and rich a Vale by fortuning to wed. Hee hath the goodly Wooll, and shee the wealthy Graine: Through which they wisely seeme their houshold to maintaine. He hath pure wholesome Ayre, and daintie crystall Springs. To those delights of his, shee daily profit brings: As to his large expense, she multiplies her heapes: Nor can his Flocks devour th'aboundance that shee reaps; As th'one with what it hath, the other strove to grace. And, now that every thing may in the proper place Most aptly be contriv'd, the Sheepe our Wold doth breed (The simplest though it seeme) shall our description need, And Shepheard-like, the Muse thus of that kind doth speak; No browne, nor sullyed black the face or legs doth streak, Like those of Moreland, Cank, or of the Cambrian hills That lightly laden are: but Cotswold wisely fills Her with the whitest kind: whose browes so woolly be, As men in her faire Sheepe no emptiness should see. The Staple deepe and thick, through, to the very graine, Most strongly keepeth out the violentest raine: A body long and large, the buttocks equall broad; As fit to under-goe the full and weightie load. And of the fleecie face, the flanke doth nothing lack, But every-where is stor'd; the belly, as the back. The faire and goodly Flock, the Shepheards onely pride, As white as Winters snowe, when from the Rivers side He drives his new-washt Sheepe; or on the Sheering day, When as the lusty Ram, with those rich spoyles of May His crooked hornes hath crown'd; the Bell-weather, so brave As none in all the Flock they like themselves would have. But Muse, returne to tell, how there the Sheepheards King, Whose Flock hath chanc't that yeere the earliest Lambe to bring, In his gay Bauldrick sits at his lowe grassie Bord, With Flawns, Curds, Clowted-creame, and Country dainties stor'd: And, whilst the Bag-pipe playes, each lustie jocund Swaine Quaffes Sillibubs in Kans, to all upon the Plaine, And to their Country-Girles, whose Nosegayes they doe weare, Some Roundelayes doe sing: the rest, the burthen beare. The fountaine of Thames, rising in the South of Cotswold.But Cotswold, be this spoke th'onely praise of thee, That thou of all the rest, the chosen soyle should'st bee, Faire Isis to bring-forth (the Mother of great Tames) With those delicious Brooks, by whose immortall streames Her greatnesse is begunne: so that our Rivers King, When he his long Descent shall from his Bel-sires bring, Must needs (Great Pastures Prince) derive his stem by thee, From kingly Cotswolds selfe, sprung of the third degree: As th'old worlds Heroës wont, that in the times of yore, On Neptune, Jove, and Mars, themselves so highly bore. But easely from her source as Isis gently dades; Unto her present ayde, downe through the deeper slades, The nimbler footed Churne, by Cisseter doth slide; And first at Greeklade gets preheminence, to guide Queene Isis on her way, ere shee receive her traine. Cleere Colne, and lively Leech, so downe from Cotswolds Plaine, At Leechlade linking hands, come likewise to support The Mother of great Tames. When, seeing the resort, From Cotswold Windrush scowres; and with her selfe doth cast The Traine to over-take, and therefore hies her fast Through the Oxfordian fields; when (as the last of all Those Floods, that into Tames out of our Cotswold fall, And farth'st unto the North) bright Enload forth doth beare. For, though it had been long, at length she came to heare That Isis was to Tame in wedlock to be ti'd: And therefore shee prepar'd t'attend upon the Bride; Expecting, at the Feast, past ordinarie grace. And beeing neere of kinne to that most Spring-full place, Where out of Blockleys banks so many Fountaines flowe, That cleane throughout his soyle proud Cotswold cannot showe The like: as though from farre, his long and many Hills, There emptied all their vaines, where-with those Founts hee fills, Which in the greatest drought so brimfull still doe float, Sent through the rifted Rocks with such an open throat, As though the Cleeves consum'd in humor; they alone, So crystalline and cold, as hardneth stick to stone. But whilst this while we talke, the farre divulged fame Of this great Bridale tow'rd, in Phœbus mightie name Doth bid the Muse make haste, and to the Bride-house speed; Of her attendance there least they should stand in need. The fifteenth Song. The Argument. The guests heere to the Bride-house hie. The goodly Vale of Al'sbury Sets her sonne (Tame) forth, brave as May, Upon the joyfull Wedding day: Who, deckt up, tow'rds his Bride is gone. So lovely Isis comming on, At Oxford all the Muses meet her, And with a Prothalamion greet her. The Nymphs are in the Bridall Bowres, Some strowing sweets, some sorting flowres: Where lustie Charwell himselfe raises, And sings of Rivers, and their praises. Then Tames his way tow'rd Windsore tends. Thus, with the Song, the Mariage ends. Now Fame had through this Ile divulg'd, in every eare, The long-expected day of Mariage to be neere, That Isis, Cotswolds heire, long woo'd was lastly wonne, And instantly should wed with Tame, old Chiltern's sonne. Tame, arising in the Vale of Alsbury, at the foot of the Chilterne. And now that Wood-mans wife, the mother of the Flood, The rich and goodly Vale of Alsbury, that stood So much upon her Tame, was busied in her Bowres, Preparing for her sonne, as many sutes of Flowres, As Cotswold for the Bride, his Isis, lately made; Who for the lovely Tame, her Bridegroome, onely staid. Whilst every crystall Flood is to this business prest, The cause of their great speed and many thus request; O! whither goe yee Floods? what suddaine wind doth blowe, Then other of your kind, that you so fast should flowe? What busines is in hand, that spurres you thus away? Faire Windrush let me heare, I pray thee Charwell say: They suddainly reply, What lets you should not see That for this Nuptiall feast wee all prepared bee? Therefore this idle chat our eares doth but offend: Our leysure serves not now these trifles to attend. But whilst things are in hand, old Chiltern (for his life) From prodigall expense can no way keepe his wife; Who feedes her Tame with Marle, in Cordiall-wise prepar'd, And thinks all idly spent, that now she onely spar'd In setting forth her sonne: nor can shee thinke it well, The richnesse of the Vale of Alsbury.Unlesse her lavish charge doe Cotswold's farre excell. For, Alsbury's a Vale that walloweth in her wealth, And (by her wholesome ayre continually in health) Is lustie, frim, and fat, and holds her youthfull strength. Besides her fruitfull earth, her mightie breadth and length, Doth Chiltern fitly match: which mountainously hie, And beeing very long, so likewise shee doth lie; From the Bedfordian fields, where first she doth begin, To fashion like a Vale, to th'place where Tame doth win His Isis wished Bed; her soyle throughout so sure, For goodnesse of her Gleabe, and for her Pasture pure, That as her Graine and Grasse, so shee her Sheepe doth breed, For burthen and for boane all other that exceed: And shee, which thus in wealth aboundantly doth flowe, Now cares not on her Child what cost shee doe bestowe. The Chiltern-Country beginning also to want wood.Which when wise Chiltern saw (the world who long had try'd, And now at last had layd all garish pompe aside; Whose hoare and chalkie head discry'd him to be old, His Beechen woods bereft that kept him from the cold) Would faine perswade the Vale to hold a steddy rate; And with his curious Wife, thus wisely doth debate: Quoth hee, you might allow what needeth, to the most: But where as lesse will serve, what meanes this idle cost? Too much, a surfet breeds, and may our Child annoy: These fat and lushious meats doe but our stomacks cloy. The modest comly meane, in all things likes the wise, Apparrell often shewes us womanish precise. And what will Cotswold thinke when he shall heare of this? Hee'll rather blame your waste, then praise your cost iwiss. But, women wilfull be, and shee her will must have, Nor cares how Chiltern chides, so that her Tame be brave. That Ouze arising neer Brackley, running into the German Sea.Alone which tow'rds his Love shee easely doth convay: For the Oxonian Ouze was lately sent away From Buckingham, where first he finds his nimbler feet; Tow'rds Whittlewood then takes: where, past the noblest Watling. Street, Hee to the Forrest gives his farewell, and doth keepe His course directly downe into the German Deepe, To publish that great day in mightie Neptunes Hall, That all the Sea-gods there might keep it festivall. As wee have told how Tame holds on his even course, Returne we to report, how Isis from her sourse Comes tripping with delight, downe from her daintier Springs; And in her princely traine, t'attend her Marriage, brings Rivers arising in Cotswold, spoke of in the former Song. Cleere Churnet, Colne, and Leech, which first she did retaine, With Windrush: and with her (all out-rage to restraine Which well might offred be to Isis as shee went) Came Yenload with a guard of Satyres, which were sent From Whichwood, to await the bright and God-like Dame. So, Bernwood did bequeath his Satyres to the Tame, For Sticklers in those stirres that at the Feast should bee. These preparations great when Charwell comes to see, To Oxford got before, to entertaine the Flood, Apollo's ayde he begs, with all his sacred brood, To that most learned place to welcome her repaire. Who in her comming on, was wext so wondrous faire, That meeting, strife arose betwixt them, whether they Her beauty should extoll, or shee admire their Laurell for Learning. Bay. On whom their severall gifts (to amplifie her dowre) The Muses there bestowe; which ever have the power Immortall her to make. And as shee past along, Those modest The Muses. Thespian Maids thus to their Isis song; Yee Daughters of the Hills, come downe from every side, And due attendance give upon the lovely Bride: Goe strewe the paths with flowers by which shee is to passe. For be yee thus assur'd, in Albion never was A beautie (yet) like hers: where have yee ever seene So absolute a Nymph in all things, for a Queene? Give instantly in charge the day be wondrous faire, That no disorderd blast attempt her braided haire. Goe, see her State prepar'd, and every thing be fit, The Bride-chamber adorn'd with all beseeming it. And for the princely Groome, who ever yet could name A Flood that is so fit for Isis as the Tame? Yee both so lovely are, that knowledge scarce can tell, For feature whether hee, or beautie shee excell: That ravished with joy each other to behold, When as your crystall wasts you closely doe enfold, Betwixt your beautious selves you shall beget a Sonne, That when your lives shall end, in him shall be begunne. The pleasant Surryan shores shall in that Flood delight, And Kent esteeme her selfe most happy in his sight. The Shire that London loves, shall onely him prefer, And give full many a gift to hold him neer to her. The They al three, Rivers, of greatest note in the Lower Germany, cast themselves into the Ocean, in the Coast opposite to the mouth of Thames. Skeld, the goodly Mose, the rich and Viny Rheine, Shall come to meet the Thames in Neptunes watry Plaine. And all the Belgian Streames and neighboring Floods of Gaul, Of him shall stand in awe, his tributaries all. As of fayre Isis thus, the learned Virgins spake, A shrill and suddaine brute this Mariage Song. Prothalamion brake; That White-horse, for the love she bare to her Ally, And honored sister Vale, the bountious Alsbury, Sent Presents to the Tame by Ock her onely Flood, Which for his Mother Vale, so much on greatnesse stood. From Oxford, Isis hasts more speedily, to see That River like his birth might entertained bee: For, that ambitious Vale, still striving to commaund, And using for her place continually to stand, Proud White-horse to perswade, much busines there hath been T'acknowledge that great Vale of Evsham for her Queen. And but that Evsham is so opulent and great, That thereby shee her selfe holds in the soveraigne seat, This White-horse striveth for soveraignty with all the Vales of Britaine. White-horse all the Vales of Britaine would or'ebeare, And absolutely sit in the imperiall Chaire; And boasts as goodly Heards, and numerous Flocks to feed; To have as soft a Gleabe, as good increase of seed; As pure and fresh an ayre upon her face to flowe, As Evsham for her life: and from her Steed doth showe, Her lustie rising Downes, as faire a prospect take As that imperious Cotswold. Wold: which her great Queene doth make So wondrously admyr'd, and her so farre extend. But, to the Mariage, hence, industrious Muse descend. The Naïads, and the Nymphs extreamly over-joy'd, And on the winding banks all busily imploy'd, Upon this joyfull day, some dainty Chaplets twine: Some others chosen out, with fingers neat and fine, Brave Crownes of Flowers. Anadems doe make: some Bauldricks up do bind: Some, Garlands: and to some, the Nosegaies were assign'd; As best their skill did serve. But, for that Tame should be Still man-like as him selfe, therefore they will that he Should not be drest with Flowers, to Gardens that belong (His Bride that better fitte) but onely such as sprong Flowers of the Medowes and Pastures. From the replenisht Meads, and fruitfull Pastures neere. To sort which Flowers, some sit; some making Garlands were; The Primrose placing first, because that in the Spring It is the first appeares, then onely florishing; The azur'd Hare-bell next, with them, they neatly mixt: T'allay whose lushious smell, they Woodbind plac't betwixt. Amongst those things of sent, there prick they in the Lilly: And neere to that againe, her sister Daffadilly. To sort these Flowers of showe, with th'other that were sweet, The Cowslip then they couch, and th'Oxslip, for her meet: The Columbine amongst they sparingly doe set, The yellow King-cup, wrought in many a curious fret, And now and then among, of Eglantine a spray, By which againe a course of Lady-smocks they lay: The Crow-flower, and there-by the Clover-flower they stick, The Daysie, over all those sundry sweets so thick, As Nature doth her selfe; to imitate her right: Who seems in that her Margarita, is both a Pearle and a Daisy. pearle so greatly to delight, That every Plaine therewith she powdreth to beholde: The crimsin Darnell Flower, the Blew-bottle, and Gold: Which though esteem'd but weeds; yet for their dainty hewes, And for their sent not ill, they for this purpose chuse. Thus having told you how the Bridegroome Tame was drest, Ile shew you, how the Bride, faire Isis, they invest; Sitting to be attyr'd under her Bower of State, Which scornes a meaner sort, then fits a Princely rate. In Flowers of Gardens. Anadems for whom they curiously dispose The Red, the dainty White, the goodly Damask Rose, For the rich Ruby, Pearle, and Amatist, men place In Kings Emperiall Crownes, the circle that enchase. The brave Carnation then, with sweet and soveraigne power (So of his colour call'd, although a July-flower) With th'other of his kinde, the speckled and the pale: Then th'odoriferous Pink, that sends forth such a gale Of sweetnes; yet in sents, as various as in sorts. The purple Violet then, the Pansie there supports: The Mary-gold above t'adorne the arched Bar: The dubble Daysie, Thrift, the Button-batcheler, Sweet William, Sops in wine, the Campion: and to these, Some Lavander they put, with Rosemary and Bayes: Sweet Marjoram, with her like, sweet Basill rare for smell, With many a flower, whose name were now too long to tell: And rarely with the rest, the goodly Flower-delice. Thus for the nuptiall houre, all fitted point-device, Whilst some still busied are in decking of the Bride, Some others were again as seriously imploy'd Strewing hearbs.In strewing of those hearbs, at Bridalls us'd that be; Which every where they throwe with bountious hands and free. The healthfull Balme and Mint, from their full laps doe fly, The sent-full Camomill, the verdurous Costmary. They hot Muscado oft with milder Maudlin cast: Strong Tansey, Fennell coole, they prodigally waste: Cleere Isop, and therewith the comfortable Thyme, Germander with the rest, each thing then in her prime; As well of wholesome hearbs, as every pleasant flower, Which Nature here produc't, to fit this happy houre. Amongst these strewing kinds, some other wilde that growe, As Burnet, all abroad, and Meadow-wort they throwe. Thus all things falling out to every ones desire, The ceremonies done that Mariage doth require, The Bride and Bridegroome set, and serv'd with sundry cates, And every other plac't, as fitted their estates; Amongst this confluence great, wise Charwell here was thought The fitst to cheare the guests: who throughly had been taught In all that could pertaine to Court-ship, long agon, As comming from his Sire, the fruitfull A Hill betwixt Norhamptonshire and Warwick. Helidon, He travelleth to Tames; where passing by those Townes Of that rich Country neere, whereas the mirthfull clownes, With Taber and the pipe, on holydayes doe use, Upon the May-pole Greene, to trample out their shooes: And having in his eares the deepe and Famous rings of Bells in Oxford-shire, called the Crosse-ring. solemne rings, Which sound him all the way, unto the Oxford. learned Springs, Where he, his Soveraigne Ouze most happily doth meet, And him, the thrice-three maids, Apollos ofspring, greet With all their sacred gifts: thus, expert being growne In musicke; and besides, a A fine Poet. curious Maker knowne: This Charwell (as I said) the fitst these Floods among, For silence having call'd, thus to th'assembly song; Stand fast ye higher Hills: low vallies easily lie: And Forrests that to both you equally apply (But for the greater part, both wilde and barren be) Retire ye to your wastes; and Rivers only we, Oft meeting let us mixe: and with delightfull grace, Let every beautious Nymph, her best lov'd Flood imbrace, An Alien be he borne, or neer to her owne Spring, So from his native Fount he bravely flourishing, Along the flowry Fields, licentiously do straine, Greeting each curled grove, and circling every Plaine; Or hasting to his fall, his sholy gravell scowr's, And with his Crystall front, then courts the climing Towres. Let all the world be Judge, what Mountaine hath a name, Like that from whose proud foot, their springs some Flood of Fame: And in the Earth's survay, what seat like that is set, Whose Streets some ample Streame, aboundantly doth wet? Where is there Haven found, or Harbour, like that Road, Int'which some goodly Flood, his burthen doth unload? By whose rank swelling Streame, the far-fetcht forraine fraught, May up to In-land Townes conveniently be brought. Of any part of Earth, we be the most renown'd; That countries very oft, nay, Empires oft we bound. As Rubicon, much fam'd, both for his Fount and Fall, The ancient limit held, twixt Italy and That which was call'd Gallia Cisalpina, and is Lombardy, Romagnia and the Westerne part of Italy. Gaule. Europe and Asia keep on Tanais either side. Such honor have we Floods, the World (even) to divide. Nay: Kingdoms thus we prove are christened oft by us; Iberia takes her name of Crystall Iberus. Such reverence to our kinde the wiser Ancients gave, As they suppos'd each Flood a Deity to have: But with our fame at home returne we to proceed. In Britanne here we find, our Severne, and our Tweed, The tripartited Ile doe generally divide, To England, Scotland, Wales, as each doth keep her side. Trent cuts the Land in two, so equally, as tho Nature it pointed-out, to our great Brute to show How to his mightie Sonnes the Iland he might share. A thousand of this kinde, and neerer, I will spare; Where if the state of Floods, at large I list to show, I proudly could report how Pactolus doth throwe Up graines of perfect gold; and of great Ganges tell, Which when full India's showers inforceth him to swell, Gilds with his glistering sands the over-pampered shore: How wealthy Tagus first by tumbling down his ore, The rude and slothfull Moores of old Iberia taught, To search into those hills, from which such wealth he brought. Beyond these if I pleas'd, I to your praise could bring, In sacred Tempe, how (about the hoofe-plow'd Spring) The Heliconian Maides, upon that hallowed ground, Recounting heavenly Hymnes eternally are crown'd. And as the earth doth us in her owne bowels nourish; So every thing, that growes by us, doth thrive and flourish. To godly vertuous men, we wisely likened are: To be so in themselves, that do not only care; But by a sacred power, which goodnesse doth awaite, Doe make those vertuous too, that them associate. By this, the wedding ends, and brake up all the Showe: And Tames, got, borne, and bred, immediately doth flowe, To Windsor-ward amaine (that with a wondring eye, The Forrest might behold his awfull Emperie) And soon becometh great, with waters wext so rank, That with his wealth he seemes to retch his widned Bank: Till happily attayn'd his Grandsire Chilterns grounds, Who with his Beechen wreaths this king of Rivers crownes. Amongst his holts and hils, as on his way he makes, At Reading once arriv'd, cleere Kennet overtakes: Her Lord the stately Tames, which that great flood againe, With many signes of joy doth kindly entertaine. Then Loddon next comes in, contributing her store; As still we see, The much runnes ever to the more. Set out with all this pompe, when this Emperiall Streame, Himselfe establisht sees, amidst his watry Realme, His much-lov'd Henly leaves, and proudly doth pursue His Wood nymph Windsors seate, her lovely site to view. Whose most delightful face when once the River sees, Which shewes her selfe attir'd in tall and stately trees, He in such earnest love with amorous gestures wooes, That looking still at her, his way was like to loose; And wandring in and out so wildly seems to goe, As headlong he himselfe into her lap would throw. Him with the like desire the Forrest doth imbrace, And with her presence strives her Tames asmuch to grace. No Forrest, of them all, so fit as she doth stand. When Princes, for their sports, her pleasures will command, No Wood-nymph as her selfe such troupes hath ever seene, Nor can such Quarries boast as have in Windsor beene. Nor any ever had so many solemne dayes; So brave assemblies viewd, nor took so rich Breaking up of Deare brought into the Quarry. assaies. Then, hand in hand, her Tames the Forrest softly brings, To that supreamest place of the great English Kings, The Garters Royall seate, from him who did advance That Princely Order first, our first that conquered France; The Temple of Saint George, wheras his honored Knights, Upon his hallowed day, observe their ancient rites: Where Eaton is at hand to nurse that learned brood, To keepe the Muses still neere to this Princely Flood; That nothing there may want, to beawtifie that seate, With every pleasure stor'd: And here my Song compleate. The sixteenth Song. The Argument. Olde Ver, neere to Saint Albans, brings Watling to talk of auncient things; What Verlam was before she fell, And many more sad ruines tell. Of the foure old Emperiall Waies, The course they held, and too what Seas; Of those seaven Saxon Kingdomes here, Their sites, and how they bounded were. Then Pure-vale vants her rich estate: And Lea bewraies her wretched Fate. The Muse, led on with much delight, Delivers Londons happy site; Showes this loose Ages leud abuse: And for this time there staies the Muse. The Brydall of our Tame and Princely Isis past: And Tamesis their sonne, begot, and wexing fast, Inviteth Crystall The river running by Uxbridge and Colbrooke. Colne his wealth on him to lay, Whose beauties had intic't his Soveraine Tames to stay, Had he not been inforc't, by his unruly traine. For Brent, a pretty Brook, allures him on againe, Great London to salute, whose hie-rear'd Turrets throng To gaze upon the Flood, as he doth passe along. Now, as the Tames is great, so most transparent Colne Feeles, with excessive joy, her amorous bosome swolne, That Ver of long esteem'd, a famous auncient Flood (Upon whose aged Bank olde Verlamchester stood, Before the Roman rule) here glorify'd of yore, Unto her cleerer banks contributed his store; Enlarging both her streame, and strengthening his renowne, Where the delicious Meads her through her course doe crown. This The little cleer river by Saint Albans. Ver (as I have said) Colnes tributary brook, On Verlams ruin'd walles as sadly he doth look, Neere Holy Albans Towne, where his rich shrine was set, Old Watling in his way the Flood doth over-get. Where after reverence done, Ver quoth the Ancient Street Tis long since thou and I first in this place did meet. And so it is quoth Ver, and we have liv'd to see Things in farre better state then at this time they be: But he that made, amend: for much their goes amisse. Quoth Watling, gentle flood, yea so in truth it is: And sith of this thou speakst; the very sooth to say, Since Great Mulmutius, first, made me the noblest Way, The soyle is altered much: the cause I pray thee showe. The time that thou hast liv'd, hath taught thee much to knowe. I faine would understand, why this delightfull place, In former time that stood so hie in Natures grace (Which bare such store of graine, and that so wondrous great, That all the neighboring Coast was cald the Whethamsted. soyle of wheate) Of later time is turn'd a hotte and hungry sand, Which scarce repayes the seed first cast into the Land. At which the silent brooke shrunk-in his silver head, And fain'd as he away would instantly have fled; Suspecting, present speech might passed griefe renew. Whom Watling thus againe doth seriously pursue; I pray thee be not coy, but answere my demand: The cause of this (deer Flood) I faine would understand. Thou saw'st when Verlam once her head aloft did beare (Which in her cinders now lies sadly buried heere) With Alablaster, Tuch, and Porphery adorn'd, When (welneare) in her pride great Troynovant she scorn'd. Thou sawest great-burthen'd Ships through these thy valleyes pass, Where now the sharp-edg'd Sithe sheeres up the spyring grasse: That where the ugly Seale and Porpose u'sd to play, The Grashopper and Ant now lord it all the day: Where now Saint Albans stands was called Holme-hurst then; Whose sumptuous Fane we see neglected now agen. This rich and goodly Fane which ruind thou doest see, Quoth Ver, the motive is that thou importun'st me: But to another thing thou cunningly doest flie, And reason seem'st to urge of her sterilitie. With that he fetcht a sigh, and ground his teeth in rage; Quoth Ver even for the sin of this accursed Age. Behold that goodly Fane, which ruind now doth stand, To holy Look before to the XI. Song. Albon built, first Martyr of the Land; Who in the faith of Christ from Rome to Britanne came, And dying in this place, resign'd his glorious Name. In memory of whom, (as more then halfe Divine) Our English Offa rear'd a rich and sumptuous shrine And Monastary heere: which our succeding kings, From time to time endow'd with many goodly things. And many a Christian Knight was buried heere, before The Norman set his foote upon this conquered shore; And after those brave spirits in all those balefull stowres, That with Duke With the eldest sonne of the Conquerour, into the Holy-land. Robert went against the Pagan powers, And in their Countries right at Cressy those that stood, And that at Poyters bath'd their bilbowes in French blood; Their valiant Nephewes next at Agin-court that fought, Whereas rebellious France upon her knees was brought: In this religious house at some of their returns, When nature claym'd her due, here plac't their hallowed urnes: Which now devowring Time, in his so mighty waste, Demolishing those walls, hath utterly defac't. So that the earth to feele the ruinous heaps of stones, That with the burth'nous weight now presse their sacred boanes, Forbids this wicked brood, should by her fruits be fed; As loathing her owne womb, that such loose children bred. Herewith transported quite, to these exclaimes he fell: Lives no man, that this world her grievous crimes dare tell? Where be those noble spirits for ancient things that stood? When in my prime of youth I was a gallant flood; In those free golden dayes, it was the Satyres use To taxe the guilty times, and raile upon abuse: But soothers find the way preferment most to win; Who serving Great mens turnes, become the bauds to sin. When Watling in his words that tooke but small delight, Hearing the angry Brook so cruelly to bite; As one that faine would drive these fancies from his mind, Quoth he, Ile tell thee things that sute thy gentler kind. My Song is of my selfe, and my three sister Streets, Which way each of us runne, where each his fellow meets, Since us, his Kingly Waies, Mulmutius first began, From Sea, againe to Sea, that through the Iland ran. Which that in mind to keep posterity might have, Appointing first our course, this priviledge he gave, That no man might arrest, or debtors goods might seize In any of us fowre his militarie Waies. And though the Fosse in length exceed me many a mile, That holds from shore to shore the length of all the Ile, From where Rich Cornwall points, to the Iberian Seas, Till colder Cathnes tells the scattered Orcades, I measuring but the bredth, that is not halfe his gate; Watling, the chiefest of the foure great Waies.Yet, for that I am grac't with goodly Londons state, And Tames and Severne both since in my course I crosse, And in much greater trade; am worthier farre then Fosse. But ô unhappie chance! through times disastrous lot, Our other fellow Streets lie utterly forgot: As Icning, that set out from Yarmouth in the East, By the Iceni then being generally possest, Was of that people first tearm'd Icning in her race, Upon the Not farre from Dunstable. Chiltern here that did my course imbrace: Into the dropping South and bearing then outright, Upon the Solent Sea stopt on the Ile-of-Wight. And Rickneld, forth that raught from Cambria's farther shore, Where South-Wales now shoots forth Saint David's Promontore. And, on his mid-way neere, did me in England meet; Then in his oblique course the lusty stragling Street Soone overtook the Fosse; and toward the fall of Tine, Into the Germane Sea dissolv'd at his decline. Here Watling would have ceast, his tale as having tolde: But now this Flood that faine the Street in talke would hold, Those ancient things to heare, which well old Watling knew, With these entising words, her fairely forward drew. Right Noble Street, quoth he, thou hast liv'd long, gone farre, Much trafique had in peace, much travailed in warre; And in thy larger course survay'st as sundry grounds (Where I poore Flood am lockt within these narrower bounds, And like my ruin'd selfe these ruins only see, And there remains not one to pittie them or me) On with thy former speech: I pray thee somwhat say. For, Watling, as thou art a military Way, Thy story of old Streets likes me so wondrous well, That of the ancient folk I faine would heare thee tell. With these perswasive words, smooth Ver the Watling wan: Stroking her dusty face, when thus the Street began; When once their seaven-fold Rule the Saxons came to reare, And yet with halfe this Ile sufficed scarcely were, Though from the Inland part the Britans they had chas't, Then understand how heere themselves the Saxons plac't. Where in Great Britans state foure people of her owne Were by the severall names of their abodes well knowne (As, in that horne which juttes into the Sea so farre, Wherein our Devonshire now, and furthest Cornewall are, The old Danmonii dwelt: so hard againe at hand, The Durotriges sat on the Dorsetian Sand: And where from Sea to Sea the Belgæ forth were let, Even from Southhamptons shore, through Wilt and Sommerset, For a more plaine division of the English kingdomes see to the XI. Song. The Attrebates in Bark unto the Bank of Tames, Betwixt the Celtick sleeve and the Sabrinian streames) The Saxons there set down one Kingdome: which install'd, And being West, they it their Westerne kingdom call'd. So Eastward where by Tames the Trinobants were set, To Trinovant their Towne, for that their name in debt, That London now we tearme, the Saxons did possesse, And their East kingdome call'd, as So call'd, of the East-Saxons. Essex doth expresse; The greatest part thereof, and still their name doth beare; Though Middlesex therein, and part of Hartford were; From Colne upon the West, upon the East to A River up on the Confines of Suff. and Essex. Stour, Where mighty Tames himselfe doth into Neptune pour. As to our farthest Rise, where forth those Fore-lands leane, Which beare their chaulky browes into the German Maine, The Angles which arose out of the Saxon race, Allur'd with the delights and fitnes of that place, Where the Iceni liv'd did set their kingdome downe, From where the wallowing Seas those queachy Washes drowne That Ely doe in-Ile, to martyred Edmonds Ditch, Till those Norfolcian shores vast Neptune doth inrich: Which (farthest to the East of this divided Ile) Th'East Angles kingdome, then, those English did instile. And Sussex seemeth still, as with an open mouth, Those Saxons Rule to shew that of the utmost South The Name to them assum'd, who rigorously expeld The Kentish Britans thence, and those rough wood-lands held From where the goodly Tames the Surrian grounds doth sweep, Untill the smiling Downes salute the Celtick Deep. Where the Dobuni dwelt, their neighbouring Cateuclani, Cornavii more remote, and where the Coritani, Where Dee and Mersey shoot into the Irish Sea; (Which welneere o're this part, now called England, lay, From Severne to the Ditch that cuts New-Market Plaine, And from the Banks of Tames to Humber, which containe So many goodly shires of Mersey, Mercia hight) Their mightier Empire, there, the middle English pight. Which farthest though it raught, yet there it did not end: But Offa, king thereof, it after did extend Beyond the Bank of Dee; and by a Ditch he cut Through Wales from North to South, into wide Mercia put Welneere the halfe thereof: and from three peoples there, To whom three speciall parts divided justly were (The Ordovices, now which North-Wales people be, From Cheshire which of old divided was by Dee: And from our Marchers now, that were Demetæ then; And those Silures call'd, by us the South-Wales men) Beyond the Severne, much the English Offa took, To shut the Britans up, within a little nooke. From whence, by Merseyes Banks, the rest a kingdome made: Where, in the Britanes Rule (before) the Brigants sway'd; The powerfull English there establisht were to stand: Which, North from Humber set, they tearm'd North-humberland; Two Kingdomes which had been, with severall thrones install'd. Bernitia hight the one; Diera th'other call'd. The first from Humber stretcht unto the Bank of Tine: Which River and the Frith the other did confine. Diera beareth through the spacious Yorkish bounds, From Durham down along to the Lancastrian Sea-depths neer the shores. Sounds, With Mersey and cleere Tine continuing to their fall, To England-ward within the Pict's renowned Wall, And did the greater part of The Cymbries Land. Cumberland containe: With whom the Britans name for ever shall remaine; Who there amongst the rocks and mountaines lived long, When they Loëgria left, inforc't through powerfull wrong. Bernitia over Tine, into Albania lay, To where the A river running by Edenbrough into the Sea. Frith falls out into the German Sea. This said, the aged Street sagd sadly on alone: And Ver upon his course, now hasted to be gone T'accompany his Colne: which as she gently glides, Doth kindly him imbrace: whom soon this hap betides; As Colne come on along, and chanc't to cast her eye Upon that neighbouring Hill where Harrow stands so hie, She Peryvale perceiv'd prankt up with wreaths of wheat, Peryvale, or Pure-vale, yeeldeth the finest meal, of England. And with exulting tearmes thus glorying in her seat; Why should not I be coy, and of my Beauties nice, Since this my goodly graine is held of greatest price? No manchet can so well the courtly palat please, As that made of the meale fetcht from my fertill Leaze. Their finest of that kind, compared with my wheate, For whitenesse of the Bread, doth look like common Cheate. What Barly is there found, whose faire and bearded eare Makes stouter English Ale, or stronger English Beere. The Oate, the Beane, and Pease, with me but Pulses are; The course and browner Rye, no more then Fitch and Tare. What seed doth any soyle, in England bring, that I Beyond her most increase yet cannot multiply. Besides; my sure abode next goodly London is, To vent my fruitfull store, that me doth never misse. And those poore baser things, they cannot put away, How ere I set my price, nere on my chap-men stay. When presently the Hill, that maketh her a Vale, With things he had in hand, did interrupt her tale, With Hampsted being falne and Hie-gate at debate; As one before them both, that would advance his State, From either for his height to beare away the praise, Besides that he alone rich Peryvale survaies. But Hampsted pleads, himselfe in Simples to have skill, Hampsted excellent for Simples. And therefore by desert to be the noblest Hill; As one, that on his worth, and knowledge doth rely In learned Physicks use, and skilfull Surgerie; Hampsted-hill, famous for Simples. And challengeth, from them, the worthiest place her owne, Since that old Watling once, o're him, to passe was knowne. Then Hie-gate boasts his Way; which men do most frequent; His long-continued fame; his hie and great descent; Appointed for a gate of London to have been, When first the mighty Brute, that City did begin. And that he is the Hill, next Enfield which hath place, A Forrest for her pride, though titled but a Chase. Her Purlewes, and her Parks, her circuit full as large, As some (perhaps) whose state requires a greater charge. Whose High woody Banks. Holts that view the East, do wistly stand to look Upon the winding course of Lee's delightfull Brook. Where Mimer comming in, invites her Sister Beane, Amongst the chalky Banks t'increase their Mistresse traine; Whom by the dainty hand, obsequiously they lead (By Hartford gliding on, through many a pleasant Mead. And comming in hir course, to crosse the common Fare, For kindnes she doth kisse that hospitable Ware.) Yet scarsely comfort Lee (alasse!) so woe begonne, Complaining in her course, thus to her selfe alone; How should my beauty now give Waltham such delight, Or I poore silly Brook take pleasure in her sight? Antiquity (for that it stands so far from view, And would her doating dreames should be believ'd for true) Dare lowdly lie for Colne, that somtimes Ships did passe, To Verlam by her Streame, when Verlam famous was; But, by these later times, suspected but to faine, She Planks and Anchors shews, her errour to maintaine; Which were, indeede, of Boats, for pleasure there to rowe Upon her (then a Lake) the Roman Pompe to showe, When Rome, her forces here did every yeere supply, And at old Verlam kept a warlike Colony. But I distressed Lee, whose course doth plainely tell, That what of Colne is said, of me none could refell, Whom See to the XII. Song. Alfred but too wise (poore River) I may say (When he the cruell Danes, did cunningly betray, Which Hartford then besieg'd, whose Navy there abode, And on my spacious brest, before the Castle road) By vantage of my soyle, he did divide my Streame; That they might ne're returne to Neptunes watry Realme. And, since, distressed Lee I have been left forlorne, A by-word to each Brook, and to the World a scorne. When Sturt, a Nymph of hers (whose faith she oft had prov'd, And whom, of all her traine, Lee most intirely lov'd) Least so excessive greefe, her Mistresse might invade, Thus (by faire gentle speech) to patience doth perswade: Though you be not so great to others as before, Yet not a jot for that dislike your selfe the more. Your case is not alone, nor is (at all) so strange; Sith every thing on earth subjects it selfe to change. Where rivers sometime ran, is firme and certaine ground: And where before were Hills, now standing Lakes are found. And that which most you urge, your beauty to dispoile, Doth recompence your Bank, with quantitie of soyle, Beset with ranks of Swans; that, in their wonted pride, Do prune their snowy plumes upon your pleasant side. And Waltham wooes you still, and smiles with wonted cheere: And Tames as at the first, so still doth hold you deer. To much beloved Lee, this scarcely Sturt had spoke, But goodly Londons sight their further purpose broke: When Tames his either Banks, adorn'd with buildings faire, The City to salute doth bid the Muse prepare. Whose Turrets, Fanes, and Spyres, when wistly she beholds, Her wonder at the site, thus strangely she unfolds: At thy great Builders wit, who's he but wonder may? Nay: of his wisedom, thus, ensuing times shall say; O more then mortall man, that did this Towne begin! Whose knowledge found the plot, so fit to set it in. What God, or heavenly power was harbourd in thy breast, From whom with such successe thy labours should be blest? Built on a rising Bank, within a Vale to stand, The goodly situation of London. And for thy healthfull soyle, chose gravell mixt with sand. And where faire Tames his course into a Crescent casts (That, forced by his Tydes, as still by her he hasts, He might his surging waves into her bosome send) Because too farre in length, his Towne should not extend. And to the North and South, upon an equall reach, Two Hils their even Banks do somewhat seeme to stretch, Those The North &amp; South winds. two extreamer Winds from hurting it to let; And only levell lies, upon the Rise and Set. Of all this goodly Ile, where breathes most cheerefull aire And every way there-to the wayes most smooth and faire; As in the fittest place, by man that could be thought, To which by Land, or Sea, provision might be brought. And such a Road for Ships scarce all the world commands, As is the goodly Tames, neer where Brute's City stands. Nor any Haven lies to which is more resort, Commodities to bring, as also to transport: Our Kingdome that enricht (through which we flourisht long) E're idle Gentry up in such aboundance sprong. Now pestring all this Ile: whose disproportion drawes The publique wealth so drie, and only is the cause Our gold goes out so fast, for foolish foraine things, Which upstart Gentry still into our Country brings; Who their insatiate pride seek chiefly to maintaine By that, which only serves to uses vile and vaine: Which our plaine Fathers earst would have accounted sinne, Before the costly Coach, and silken stock came in; Tobacco.Before that Indian weed so strongly was imbrac't; Wherin, such mighty summes we prodigally waste; That Merchants long train'd up in Gayn's deceitfull schoole, And subtly having learn'd to sooth the humorous foole, Present their painted toyes unto this frantique gull, Disparaging our Tinne, our Leather, Corne, and Wooll; When Forrainers, with ours them warmly cloath and feed, Transporting trash to us, of which we nere had need. But whilst the angry Muse, thus on the Time exclames, Sith every thing therin consisteth in extreames; Lest she inforc't with wrongs, her limits should transcend, Here of this present Song she briefly makes an end. The seventeenth Song. The Argument. To Medway, Tames a suter goes; But fancies Mole, as forth he flowes. Her Mother, Homesdale, holds her in: She digs through Earth, the Tames to win. Great Tames, as King of Rivers, sings The Catalogue of th'English Kings. Thence the light Muse, to th'Southward soares, The Surrian and Sussexian shores; The Forrests and the Downes survaies, With Rillets running to those Seas; This Song of hers then cutteth short, For things to come, of much import. At length it came to passe, that Isis and her Tame Of Medway understood, a Nymph of wondrous fame; And much desirous were, their princely Tames shuld prove If (as a wooer) he could win her Maiden-love; That of so great descent, and of so large a Dower, Might well-allie their House, and much increase his power: And striving to preferre their Sonne, the best they may, Set forth the lusty Flood, in rich and brave array, Bankt with imbrodered Meads, of sundry sutes of flowres, His brest adorn'd with Swans, oft washt with silver showres: A traine of gallant Floods, at such a costly rate As might beseeme their care, and fitting his estate. Attended and attyr'd magnificently thus, They send him to the Court of great Oceanus, The Worlds huge wealth to see; yet with a full intent, To wooe the lovely Nymph, faire Medway, as he went. Who to his Dame and Sire, his duty scarce had done, And whil'st they sadly wept at parting of their Sonne, See what the Tames befell, when t'was suspected least. As still his goodly traine yet every houre increast, And from the Surrian shores cleere Wey came down to meet His Greatnes, whom the Tames so gratiously doth greet, That with the Comming by Fernham, so called of Ferne there growing. Fearne-crown'd Flood he Minion-like doth play: Yet is not this the Brook, entiseth him to stay. But as they thus, in pompe, came sporting on the shole, Gainst Hampton-Court he meets the soft and gentle Mole. Whose eyes so pierc't his breast, that seeming to foreslowe The way which he so long, intended was to go, With trifling up and down, he wandreth here and there; And that he in her sight, transparent might appeare, Applyes himselfe to Fords, and setteth his delight On that which most might make him gratious in her sight. Then Isis and the Tame from their conjoyned bed, Desirous still to learne how Tames their son had sped (For greatly they had hop't, his time had so been spent, That he ere this had won the goodly heyre of Kent) And sending to enquire, had newes return'd againe (By such as they imploy'd, on purpose in his traine) How this their only heyre, the Iles emperiall Flood, Had loytered thus in love, neglectfull of his good. No marvaile (at the newes) though Isis. Ouse and Tame were sad, More comfort of their sonne expecting to have had. Nor blame them, in their looks much sorrow though they show'd: Who fearing least he might thus meanely be bestow'd, And knowing danger still increased by delay, Employ their utmost power, to hasten him away. But Tames would hardly on: oft turning back to show, From his much loved Mole how loth he was to go. The mother of the Mole, old A very woody Vale in Surry. Homesdale, likewise beares Th'affection of her childe, as ill as they do theirs: Who nobly though deriv'd, yet could have been content, T'have matcht her with a Flood, of farre more mean descent. But Mole respects her words, as vaine and idle dreames, Compar'd with that high joy, to be belov'd of Tames: And head-long holds her course, his company to win. But, Homesdale raised Hills, to keep the straggler in; That of her daughters stay she need no more to doubt: (Yet never was there help, but love could finde it out.) Mole digs her selfe a Path, by working day and night (According to her name, to shew her nature right) And underneath the Earth, for three miles space doth creep: Till gotten out of sight, quite from her mothers keep, Her foreintended course the wanton Nymph doth run; As longing to imbrace old Tame and Isis son. When Tames now understood, what paines the Mole did take, How farre the loving Nymph adventur'd for his sake; Although with Medway matcht, yet never could remove The often quickning sparks of his more ancient love. So that it comes to passe, when by great Natures guide The Ocean doth returne, and thrusteth-in the Tide; Tames ebbes &amp; flowes beyond Richmond. Up tow'rds the place, where first his much-lov'd Mole was seen, He ever since doth flow, beyond delightfull Sheene. Then Wandal commeth in, the Moles beloved mate, So amiable, faire, so pure, so delicate, So plump, so full, so fresh, her eyes so wondrous cleer: And first unto her Lord, at Wandsworth doth appeare, That in the goodly Court, of their great soveraigne Tames, There might no other speech be had amongst the Streames, But only of this Nymph, sweet Wandal, what she wore; Of her complection, grace, and how her selfe she bore. But now this mighty Flood, upon his voiage prest (That found how with his strength, his beauties still increast, From where, brave Windsor stood on tip-toe to behold The faire and goodly Tames, so farre as ere he could, With Kingly houses Crown'd, of more then earthly pride, Upon his either Banks, as he along doth glide) With wonderfull delight, doth his long course pursue, Where Otlands, Hampton Court, and Richmond he doth view, Then Westminster the next great Tames doth entertaine; That vaunts her Palace large, and her most sumptuous Fane: The Lands tribunall seate that challengeth for hers, The crowning of our Kings, their famous sepulchers. Then goes he on along by that more beautious Strand, Expressing both the wealth and bravery of the Land. (So many sumptuous Bowres, within so little space, The All-beholding Sun scarse sees in all his race.) And on by London leads, which like a Crescent lies, London lying like a halfe Moon. Whose windowes seem to mock the Star-befreckled skies; Besides her rising Spyres, so thick themselves that show, As doe the bristling reeds, within his Banks that growe. There sees his crouded Wharfes, and people-pestred shores, His Bosome over-spread, with shoales of labouring ores: London-bridge the Crowne of Tames.With that most costly Bridge, that doth him most renowne, By which he cleerely puts all other Rivers downe. Thus furnished with all that appertain'd to State, Desired by the Floods (his Greatnes which awayt) That as the rest before, so somewhat he would sing, Both worthy of their praise, and of himselfe their King; A Catalogue of those, the Scepter heer that swayd, The Princely Tames recites, and thus his Song he laid; As Bastard William first, by Conquest hither came, And brought the Norman Rule, upon the English name: So with a tedious warre, and almost endlesse toyles, Throughout his troubled raigne, here held his hard-got spoyles. Deceasing at the last, through his unsetled State, Left (with his ill-got Crown) unnaturall debate. For, dying at his home, his eldest sonne abroad (Who, in the Holy-warre, his person then bestow'd) His second Rufus next usurpt the wronged raigne: And by a fatall dart, in his New Forrest slaine, Whilst in his proper right religious Robert slept, Through craft into the Throne, the younger Beau-cleark crept. From whom his Scepter, then, whil'st Robert strove to wrest, The other (of his power that amply was possest) With him in battell joyn'd: and, in that dreadfull day (Where Fortune shew'd her selfe all humane power to sway) Duke Robert went to wrack; and taken in the flight, Was by that cruell King deprived of his sight, And in close prison put; where miserably he dy'd: But Henries whole intent was by just heaven deny'd. For, as of light, and life, he that sad Lord bereft; So his, to whom the Land, he purpos'd to have left, The See the last note to the IV. Song. raging Seas devowr'd, as hitherward they saild. When, in this Line direct, the Conquerors issue faild, Twixt Henries Daughter Mauld, the Almayne Emperours Bride (Which after to the Earle of Anjou was affi'd) And Stephen Earle of Bloys, the Conquerors Sisters son, A fierce and cruell war immediately begun; Who with their severall powers, arrived here from France, By force of hostile Armes, their Titles to advance. But, Stephen, what by coyne, and what by forraine strength, Through Worlds of danger gain'd the glorious goale at length. But, left without an heyre, the Empresse issue next, No Title else on foote; upon so faire pretext, The second Henry soon upon the Throne was set, (Which Mauld to Jeffrey bare) the first Plantaginet. Who held strong wars with Wales, that his subjection spurn'd: Which oftentimes he beat; and, beaten oft, return'd: With his sterne Children vext: who (whil'st he strove t'advance His right within this Ile) rays'd war on him in France. With his hie fame in fight, what colde brest was not fir'd? Through all the Westerne world, for wisedome most admyr'd. Then Richard got the Rule, his most renowned sonne, Whose courage, him the name of Cure De Lion won. With those first earthly Gods, had this brave Prince been borne, His daring hand had from Alcides shoulders torne The Nemean Lyon's hyde: who in the Holy-land So dreadfull was, as though from Jove and Neptunes hand, The thundring three-forkt Fire, and Trident he had reft, And him to rule their charge they only then had left. Him John againe succeeds; who, having put-away Yong Arthur (Richards sonne) the Scepter took to sway. Who, of the common-wealth first havock having made, His sacrilegious hands upon the Churches laid, In cruelty and rape continuing out his raigne; That his outrageous lust and courses to restraine, The Baronage were forc't defensive Armes to raise, Their daughters to redeeme, that he by force would seise. Which the first Civill warre in England here begun. And for his sake such hate his sonne young Henry won, That to depose their Prince, th'revengefull people thought; And from the Line of France yong Lewes to have brought, To take on him our Rule: but, Henry got the Throne, By his more forcefull friends: who, wise and puissant growne, The generall Charter seiz'd: that into slavery drew The freest borne English blood. Of which such discord grew, And in the Barons breasts so rough combustions rais'd, With much expence of blood as long was not appeaz'd, By strong and tedious gusts held up on either side, Betwixt the Prince and Peeres, with equall power and pride. He knew the worst of warre, matcht with the Barons strong; Yet victor liv'd, and raign'd both happily and long. This long-liv'd Prince expyr'd: the next succeeded; he, Of us, that for a God might well related be. Our Long-shanks, Scotlands scourge: who to the Orcads raught His Scepter, and with him from wilde Albania brought The reliques of her Crowne (by him first placed here) The seat on which her Kings inaugurated were. He tam'd the desperate Welsh, that out so long had stood, And made them take See before to the IX. Song. a Prince, sprong of the English blood. This Ile, from Sea to Sea, he generally controld, And made the other parts of England both to holde. This Edward, first of ours, a second then ensues; Who both his Name and Birth, by loosenes, did abuse: Faire Ganimeds and Fools who rais'd to Princely places; And chose not men for wit, but only for their faces. In parasites and knaves, as he repos'd his trust, Who sooth'd him in his wayes apparantly unjust; For that preposterous sinne wherein he did offend, In his posteriour parts had his preposterous end. A third then, of that name, amends for this did make: Who from his idle sire seem'd nought at all to take. But as his Grand-sire did his Empires verge advance: So led he forth his powers, into the heart of France. And fastning on that Right, he by his mother had, Against the Salique law, which utterly forbad Their women to enherite; to propagate his Cause, At Cressey with his sword first cancelled those Lawes: Then like a furious storme, through troubled France he ran; And by the hopefull hand of brave Black-Edward wan Proud Poytiers, where King John he valiantly subdew'd, The miserable French and there in mammocks hew'd; Then with his battering Rams made Earth-quakes in their Towres, Till trampled in the dust her selfe she yeelded ours. As mighty Edwards heyre, to a second Richard then (Son to that famous Prince Black Edward, Man of Men, Untimely that before his conquering father dy'd) Too soon the Kingdom fell: who his vaine youth apply'd To wantonnesse and spoyle, and did to favour drawe Unworthy ignorant sots, with whose dull eyes he sawe: Who plac't their like in Court, and made them great in State (Which wise and vertuous men, beyond all plagues, might hate.) To whom he blindly gave: who blindly spent againe, And oft opprest his Land, their riot to maintaine. He hated his Allyes, and the deserving sterv'd; His Minions and his will, the Gods he only serv'd: And finally, depos'd, as he was ever friend To Rybaulds, so againe by Villaines had his end. Henry the Sonne of Gaunt, supplanting Richard, then Ascended to the Throne: when discontented men, Desirous first of change, which to that height him brought, Deceived of their ends, into his actions sought; And, as they set him up, assay'd to pluck him down: From whom he hardly held his ill-atchieved Crown; That, Treasons to suppresse which oft he did disclose, And raysing publike Armes, against his powerfull foes, His usurpation still being troubled to maintaine, His short disquiet dayes scarse raught a peacefull raigne. A fift succeeds the fourth: but how his father got The Crown, by right or wrong, the Sonne respecteth not. Nor further hopes for that ere leaveth to pursue; But doth his claime to France, courageously renew; Upon her wealthy shores un-lades his warlike fraught; And, shewing us the fields where our brave fathers fought, First drew his sun-bright Sword, reflecting such a light, As put sad guilty France, into so great a fright, That her pale Genius sank; which trembling seem'd to stand, When first he set his foot on her rebellious Land. That all his Grand-sires deeds did over, and thereto Those hie atcheevements adde the former could not doe: At Agincourts proud fight, that quite put Poytiers down; Of all, that time who liv'd, the King of most renowne. Whose too untimely end, the Fates too soon did hast: Whose nine yeares noble acts, nine Worlds deserve to last. A sixt in name succeeds, borne great, the mighty sonne Of him, in Englands right that spacious France had wonne. Who coming young to raigne, protected by the Peeres Untill his Non-age out: and growne to riper yeeres, Prov'd upright, soft, and meeke, in no wise loving warre; But fitter for a Cowle, then for a Crowne by farre. Whose mildnes over-much, did his destruction bring: A wondrous godly man, but not so good a King. Like whom yet never man tri'd fortunes change so oft; So many times throwne-down, so many times aloft (When with the utmost power, their friends could them afford, The Yorkists, put their right upon the dint of sword) As still he lost and wonne, in that long bloody warre, From those two Factions stil'd, of York and Lancaster. But by his foes inforc't to yeeld him to their power, His wretched raigne and life, both ended in the Tower. Of th'Edwards name the fourth put on the Regall Wreath: Whom furious bloody warre (that seem'd a while to breath) Not utterly forsooke. For, Henries Queene and heyre (Their once possessed raigne still seeking to repaire) Put forward with their friends, their title to maintaine. Whose blood did Barnets Streets and Teuksburyes distaine, Till no man left to stirre. The Title then at rest, The old Lancastrian Line, being utterly supprest, Himselfe the wanton King to amourous pleasures gave; Yet jealous of his right descended to his Grave. His Sonne an infant left: who had he liv'd to raigne, Edward the fift had been. But justly see againe, As he a King and Prince before had caus'd to die (The father in the Tower, the sonne at Teuksbury) So were his children yong, being left to be protected By Richard; who nor God, nor humane lawes respected. This Viper, this most vile devowrer of his kinde (Whom his ambitious ends had strooke so grosly blind) From their deare mothers lap, them seising for a pray (Himselfe in right the next, could they be made away) Most wrongfully usurpt, and them in prison kept; Whom cruelly at last he smothered as they slept. As his unnaturall hands, were in their blood imbru'd: So (guilty in himselfe) with murther he pursu'd Such, on his haynous acts as lookt not faire and right; Yea, such as were not his expresly, and had might T'oppose him in his course; till (as a monster loth'd, The man, to hell and death himselfe that had betroth'd) They brought another in, to thrust that Tyrant down; In battell who at last resign'd both life and Crown. A seaventh Henry, then, th'emperiall seate attain'd, In banishment who long in Britanne had remain'd, What time the Yorkists sought his life to have bereft, Of the Lancastrian House then only being left (Deriv'd from John of Gaunt) whom Richmond did beget, Upon a daughter borne to John of Sommerset. Elizabeth of York this Noble Prince affi'd, To make his Title strong, thereby on either side. And grafting of the White and Red Rose firme together, Was first, that to the Throne advanc't the name of Tether. In Bosworths fatall Field, who having Richard slaine, Then in that prosperous peace of his successfull raigne, Of all that ever rul'd, was most precise in State, And in his life and death a King most fortunate. This Seaventh, that was of ours, the Eighth succeeds in name: Who by Prince Arthurs death (his elder Brother) came Unto a Land with wealth aboundantly that flow'd: Aboundantly againe, so he the same bestow'd, In Banquets, Mask's, and Tilts, all pleasures prone to try, Besides his secret scapes who lov'd Polygamy. The Abbayes he supprest; a thousand lingring yeere, Which with revenewes large the World had sought to reare. And through his awfull might, for temporall ends did save, To other uses earst what frank devotion gave; And here the papall power, first utterly deny'd, Defender of the Faith, that was instil'd and dy'd. His sonne the Empire had, our Edward sixt that made; Untimely as he sprang, untimely who did fade. A Protestant being bred; and in his infant raigne, Th'religion then receiv'd, here stoutly did maintaine: But e're he raught to man, from his sad people reft, His Scepter he againe unto his Sisters left. Of which the eldest of two, Queen Mary, mounts the Chaire: The ruin'd Roman State who striving to repaire, With persecuting hands the Protestants pursew'd; Whose Martyred ashes oft the wondring Streets bestrew'd. She matcht her selfe with Spaine, and brought King Philip hither, Which with an equall hand, the Scepter sway'd togither. But issuless she dy'd; and under six yeeres raigne, To her wise Sister gave the Kingdome up againe. Elizabeth, the next, this falling Scepter hent; Digressing from her Sex, with Man-like government This Iland kept in awe, and did her power extend Afflicted France to ayde, her owne as to defend; Against th'Iberian rule, the Flemmings sure defence: Rude Ireland's deadly scourge; who sent her Navies hence Unto the either Inde, and to that shore so greene, Virginia which we call, of her a Virgin Queen: In Portugall gainst Spaine, her English ensignes spred; Took Cales, when from her ayde the brav'd Iberia fled. Most flourishing in State: that, all our Kings among, Scarse any rul'd so well: but Henry III. and Edward III. the one raigned 56. the other. 50. two, that raign'd so long. Here suddainly he staid: and with his kingly Song, Whil'st yet on every side the City loudly rong, He with the Eddy turn'd, a space to look about: The Tide, retiring soon, did strongly thrust him out. And soon the pliant Muse, doth her brave wing advance, Tow'rds those Sea-bordring shores of ours, that point at France; The harder Surrian Heath, and the Sussexian Downe. Which with so great increase though Nature do not crowne, As many other Shires, of this inviron'd Ile: Yet on the The Sun in Aries. Weathers head, when as the sunne doth smile, Nurst by the Southern Winds, that soft and gently blowe, Here doth the lusty sap as soon begin to flowe; The Earth as soon puts on her gaudy Summers sute; The Woods as soon in green, and orchards great with fruit. To Sea-ward, from the seat where first our Song begun, Exhaled to the South by the ascending sunne, Fower stately Wood Nymphs stand on the Sussexian ground, Great A Forrest, containing most part of Kent, Sussex, and Surrey. Andredsweld's sometime: who, when she did abound, In circuit and in growth, all other quite supprest: But in her wane of pride, as she in strength decreast, Her Nymphs assum'd them names, each one to her delight. As, Water-downe, so call'd of her depressed site: And Ash-Downe, of those Trees that most in her do growe, Set higher to the Downes, as th'other standeth lowe. Saint Leonards, of the seat by which she next is plac't, And Whord that with the like delighteth to be grac't. These Forrests as I say, the daughters of the Weald (That in their heavie breasts, had long their greefs conceal'd) Foreseeing, their decay each howre so fast came on, Under the axes stroak, fetcht many a grievous grone, When as the anviles weight, and hammers dreadfull sound, Even rent the hollow Woods, and shook the queachy ground. So that the trembling Nymphs, opprest through gastly feare, Ran madding to the Downes, with loose dishev'ld hayre. The Sylvans that about the neighbouring woods did dwell, Both in the tufty Frith and in the mossy Fell, Forsook their gloomy Bowres, and wandred farre abroad, Expeld their quiet seats, and place of their abode, When labouring carts they saw to hold their dayly trade, Where they in summer wont to sport them in the shade. Could we, say they, suppose, that any would us cherish, Which suffer (every day) the holiest things to perish? Or to our daily want to minister supply? These yron times breed none, that minde posteritie. Tis but in vaine to tell, what we before have been, Or changes of the world, that we in time have seen; When, not devising how to spend our wealth with waste, We to the savage swine, let fall our larding mast. But now, alas, our selves we have not to sustaine, Nor can our tops suffice to shield our Roots from raine. Joves Oke, the warlike Ash, veyn'd Elme, the softer Beech, Short Hazell, Maple plaine, light Aspe, the bending Wych, Tough Holly, and smooth Birch, must altogether burne: What should the Builder serve, supplies the Forgers turne; When under publike good, base private gaine takes holde, And we poore woefull Woods, to ruine lastly solde. This uttered they with griefe: and more they would have spoke, But that the envious Downes, int'open laughter broke; As joying in those wants, which Nature them had given, Sith to as great distresse the Forrests should be driven. Like him that long time hath anothers state envy'd, And sees a following Ebbe, unto his former Tide; The more he is deprest, and bruiz'd with fortunes might, The larger Reane his foe doth give to his despight: So did the envious Downes; but that againe the Floods (Their fountaines that derive, from those unpittied Woods, And so much grace thy Downes, as through their Dales they creep, Their glories to convay unto the Celtick deep) It very hardly tooke, much murmuring at their pride. Cleere Lavant, that doth keep the Southamptonian side (Dividing it well-neere from the Sussexian lands That Selsey doth survay, and Solents troubled sands) To Chichester their wrongs impatiently doth tell: And Arun (which doth name the beautious Arundell) As on her course she came, it to her Forrest tolde. Which, nettled with the newes, had not the power to hold: But breaking into rage, wisht Tempests them might rive; And on their barren scalps, still flint and chauke might thrive, The brave and nobler Woods which basely thus upbraid. And Adur comming on, to Shoreham softly said, The Downes did very ill, poore Woods so to debase. But now, the Ouse, a Nymph of very scornefull grace, So touchy waxt therewith, and was so squeamish growne, That her old name she scorn'd should publiquely be knowne. Whose haven out of mind when as it almost grew, New-Haven.The lately passed times denominate, the New. So Cucmer with the rest put to her utmost might: As Ashburne undertakes to doe the Forrests right (At Pemsey, where she powres her soft and gentler Flood) And Asten once distain'd with native English blood: (Whose Soyle, when yet but wet with any little raine, Doth blush; as put in mind of those there sadly slaine, When Hastings harbour gave unto the Norman powers, Whose name and honors now are denizend for ours) That boding ominous Brook, it through the Forrests rung: Which ecchoing it againe the mighty Weald along, Great stirre was like to grow; but that the Muse did charme Their furies, and her selfe for nobler things did arme. The eighteenth Song. The Argument. The Rother through the Weald doth rove, Till he with Oxney fall in love: Rumney, would with her wealth beguile, And winne the River from the Ile. Medway, with her attending Streames, Goes forth to meet her Lord great Tames: And where in bredth she her disperses, Our Famous Captaines she rehearses, With many of their valiant deeds. Then with Kents praise the Muse proceeds. And telles when Albion o're Sea road, How he his daughter-Iles bestow'd; And how grim Goodwin fomes and frets: Where to this Song, an end she sets. Our Argas scarcely yet delivered of her sonne, When as the River downe, through Andredsweald dooth run: Nor can the aged Hill have comfort of her childe. For, living in the Woods, her Rother waxed wilde; His Banks with aged Okes, and Bushes over-growne, That from the Sylvans kinde, he hardly could be knowne: Yea, many a time the Nymphes, which hapt this Flood to see, Fled from him, whom they sure a Satyre thought to be; As Satyre-like he held all pleasures in disdaine, And would not once vouchsafe, to look upon a Plaine; Till chancing in his course to view a goodly plot, Which Albion in his youth, upon a Sea Nymph got, For Oxney's love he pines: who being wildly chaste, And never woo'd before, was coy to be imbrac't. But, what obdurate heart, was ever so perverse, Whom yet a lovers plaints, with patience, could not pearce? For, in this conflict she being lastly overthrowne, In-Iled in his Armes, he clips her for his owne. Who being grosse and black, she lik't the River well. Of Rothers happy match, when Rumney Marsh heard tell, Whyl'st in his youthfull course himselfe he doth apply, And falleth in her sight into the Sea at Rye, She thinketh with her selfe, how she a way might finde A description of Rumney Marsh.To put the homely Ile quite out of Rothers minde; Appearing to the Flood, most bravely like a Queene, Clad (all) from head to foot, in gaudy Summers green; Her mantle richly wrought, with sundry flowers and weeds; Her moystfull temples bound, with wreaths of quivering reeds: Which loosely flowing downe, upon her lusty thighes, Most strongly seeme to tempt the Rivers amorous eyes. And on her loynes a frock, with many a swelling pleate, Embost with well-spread Horse, large Sheepe, and full-fed Neate. Some wallowing in the grasse, there lie a while to batten; Some sent away to kill; some thither brought to fatten; With Villages amongst, oft powthred heere and there; And (that the same more like to The naturall expressing of the surface of a Country in Painting. Landskip should appeare) With Lakes and lesser Foards, to mitigate the heate (In Summer when the Fly doth prick the gadding Neate, Forc't from the Brakes, where late they brouz'd the velvet buds) In which, they lick their Hides, and chew their savoury Cuds. Of these her amourous toyes, when Oxney came to knowe, Suspecting least in time her rivall she might growe, Th'allu'rments of the Marsh, the jealous Ile do move, That to a constant course, she thus perswades her Love: With Rumney, though for dower I stand in no degree; In this, to be belov'd yet liker farre then she: Though I be browne, in me there doth no favour lack. The foule is said deform'd: and she, extreamely black. And though her rich attire, so curious be and rare, From her there yet proceeds unwholsome putrid aire: Where my complexion more sutes with the higher ground, Upon the lusty Weald, where strength doth still abound. The Wood-gods I refus'd, that su'd to me for grace, Me in thy watry Armes, thee suffring to imbrace; Where, to great Neptune she may one day be a pray: The Sea-gods in her lap lie wallowing every day. And what, though of her strength she seem to make no doubt? Yet put unto the proofe shee'll hardly hold him out. With this perswasive speech which Oxney lately us'd, With strange and sundry doubts, whilst Rother stood confus'd, Old See to the XVII. Song. Andredsweald at length doth take her time to tell The changes of the world, that since her youth befell, When yet upon her soyle, scarce humane foote had trode; A place where only then, the Sylvans made abode. Where, feareless of the Hunt, the Hart securely stood, And every where walkt free, a Burgesse of the Wood; Untill those Danish routs, whom hunger-starv'd at home, (Like Woolves pursuing prey) about the world did roame. And stemming the rude streame dividing us from France, Into the spacious mouth of Rother fell (by chance) That Lymen then was nam'd, when (with most irksome care) The heavy Danish yoke, the servile English bare. And when at last she found, there was no way to leave Those, whom she had at first been forced to receive; And by her great resort, she was through very need, Constrained to provide her peopled Townes to feed. She learn'd the churlish axe and twybill to prepare, To steele the coulters edge, and sharpe the furrowing share: And more industrious still, and only hating sloth, A huswife she became, most skild in making cloth. Kentish Cloth. That now the Draper comes from London every yeare, And of the Kentish sorts, make his provision there. Whose skirts (tis said) at first that fiftie furlongs went, Have lost their ancient bounds, now The Weald of Kent. limited in Kent. Which strongly to approve, she Medway forth did bring, From Sussex who (tis knowne) receives her silver Spring. Who towar'ds the lordly Tames, as she along doth straine, Where Teise, cleere Beule, and Len, beare up her limber traine As she removes in state: so for her more renowne, Her only name she leaves, t'her only Maidstone .i. Medway's towne. christned Towne; And Rochester doth reach, in entring to the Bowre Of that most matchless Tames, her princely Paramoure. Whose bosome doth so please her Soveraigne (with her pride) Whereas the royall Fleet continually doth ride, That where she told her Tames, she did intend to sing What to the English Name immortall praise should bring; To grace his goodly Queen, Tames presently proclaimes, That all the Kentish Floods, resigning him their names, Should presently repaire unto his mighty Hall, And by the posting Tides, towards London sends to call Cleere Ravensburne (though small, remembred them among) At Detford entring. Whence as down she comes along, She Darent thither warnes: who calles her sister Cray, Which hasten to the Court with all the speed they may. And but that Medway then of Tames obtain'd such grace, Except her country Nymphs, that none should be in place, More Rivers from each part, had instantly been there, Then at their marriage, first, by In the Faiery Queene. Spenser numbred were. This Medway still had nurst those navies in her Road, Our Armies that had oft to conquest borne abroad; And not a man of ours, for Armes hath famous been, Whom she not going out, or comming in hath seen: Or by some passing Ship, hath newes to her been brought, What brave exploits they did; as where, and how, they fought. Wherefore, for audience now, she to th'assembly calls, The Captains to recite when seriously she fals. Of noble warriors now, saith she, shall be my Song; Of those renowned spirits, that from the Conquest sprong, Of th'English Norman blood: which, matchless for their might, Have with their flaming swords, in many a dreadfull fight, Illustrated this Ile, and bore her fame so farre; Our Heroes, which the first wanne, in that Holy warre, Such feare from every foe, and made the East more red, With splendor of their Armes, then when from Tithons bed The blushing Dawne doth break; towards which our fame begon, By Robert (Curt-hose call'd) the Conquerours eldest sonne, Peter, the Hermit.Who with great Godfrey and that holy Hermit went The Sepulcher to free, with most devout intent. And to that title which the Norman William got, When in our Conquest heere, he strove t'include the Scot, The Generall of our power, that stout and warlike Earle, Who English being borne, was stil'd of Aubemerle; Those Lacyes then no lesse courageous, which had there The leading of the day, all, brave Commanders were. Sir Walter Especk, matcht with Peverell, which as farre Adventur'd for our fame: who in that Bishops warre, Immortall honour got to Stephens troubled raigne: That day ten thousand Scots upon the field were slaine. The Earle of Strigule then our Strong-bowe, first that wonne Wilde Ireland with the sword (which, to the glorious sunne, Lifts up his nobler name) amongst the rest may stand. In Cure de Lyon's charge unto the Holy-land, Our Earle of Lester, next, to rank with them we bring: And Turnham, he that took th'impost'rous Ciprian King. Strong Tuchet chose to weeld the English standard there; Poole, Gourney, Nevill, Gray, Lyle, Ferres, Mortimer: And more, for want of pens whose deeds not brought to light, It grieves my zealous soule, I can not do them right. The noble Penbrooke then, who Strong-bowe did succeed, Like his brave Grand-sire, made th'revolting Irish bleed, When yeelding oft, they oft their due subjection broke; And when the Britans scorn'd, to beare the English yoke, Lewellin Prince of Wales in Battell overthrewe, Nine thousand valiant Welsh and either took or slew. Earle Richard, his brave sonne, of Strong-bowes matchless straine, As he a Marshall was, did in himselfe retaine The nature of that word, being Martiall, like his name: Who, as his valiant Sire, the Irish oft did tame. With him we may compare Marisco (King of Men) That Lord chiefe Justice was of Ireland, whereas then Those two brave Burrowes, John, and Richard, had their place, Which through the bloodied Bogs, those Irish oft did chase; Whose deeds may with the best deservedly be read. As those two Lacyes then, our English Powers that led: Which twenty thousand, there, did in one Battell quell, Amongst whome (troden down) the King of Conaugh fell. Then Richard, that lov'd Earle of Cornwall, here we set: Who, rightly of the race of great Plantaginet, Our English Armies shipt, to gaine that hallowed ground, With Long-sword the brave sonne of beautious Rosamond: The Pagans through the breasts, like thunderbolts that shot; And in the utmost East such admiration got, That the shril-sounding blast, and terrour of our fame Hath often conquered, where, our swords yet never came: As Gifford, not forgot, their stout associate there. So in the warres with Wales, of ours as famous here, Guy Beuchamp, that great Earle of Warwick, place shall have: From whom, the Cambrian Hils the Welsh-men could not save; Whom he, their generall plague, impetuously pursu'd, And in the British gore his slaughtering sword imbru'd. In order as they rise (next Beuchamp) we preferre The Lord John Gifford, matcht with Edmond Mortimer; Men rightly moulded up, for high adventrous deeds. In this renowned rank of warriors then succeeds Walwin, who with such skill our Armies oft did guide; In many a dangerous straight, that had his knowledge tride. And in that fierce assault, which caus'd the fatall flight, Where the distressed Welsh resign'd their Ancient right, Stout Frampton: by whose hand, their Prince Lewellin fell. Then followeth (as the first who have deserved as well) Great Saint-John; from the French, which twice recovered Guyne: And he, all him before that cleerely did out-shine, Warren, the puissant Earle of Surrey, which led forth Our English Armyes oft into our utmost North; And oft of his approach made Scotland quake to heare, When Tweed hath sunk downe flat, within her Banks for feare. On him there shall attend, that most adventurous Twhing, That at Scambekin fight, the English off did bring Before the furious Scot, that else were like to fall. As Basset, last of these, yet not the least of all Those most renowned spirits that Fowkerk bravely fought; Where Long-shanks, to our lore, Albania lastly brought. As, when our Edward first his title did advance, And led his English hence, to winne his right in France, That most deserving Earle of Darby we preferre, Henries third valiant sonne, the Earle of Lancaster, That only Mars of Men; who (as a generall scurge, Sent by just-judging Heaven, outrageous France to purge) At Cagant plagu'd the Power of Flemmings that she rais'd, Against the English force: which as a hand-sell seas'd, Into her very heart he marcht in warlike wise; Took Bergera, Langobeck, Mountdurant, and Mountguyse; Leau, Poudra, and Punach, Mount-Segre, Forsa, wonne; Mountpesans, and Beumount, the Ryall, Aiguillon, Rochmillon, Mauleon, Franch, and Angolisme surpriz'd; With Castles, Cities, Forts, nor Provinces suffic'd. Then took the Earle of Leyle: to conduct whom there came Nine Vicounts, Lords, and Earls, astonisht at his name. To Gascoyne then he goes (to plague her, being prest) And manfully himselfe of Mirabell possest; Surgeres, and Alnoy, Benoon, and Mortaine strooke: And with a fearefull siege, he Taleburg lastly took; With prosperous successe, in lesser time did winne Maximien, Lusingham, Mount-Sorrell, and Bovin; Sackt Poytiers: which did, then, that Countries treasure hold; That not a man of ours would touch what was not gold. With whom our S? Walter Maney. Maney here deservedly doth stand, Which first Inventor was of that courageous band, Who clos'd their left eyes up; as, never to be freed, Till there they had atchiev'd some high adventurous deed. He first into the preasse at Cagant conflict flue; And from amidst a grove of gleaves, and halberds drew Great Darby beaten downe; t'amaze the men of warre, When he for England cri'd, S. George, and Lancaster: And as mine author tells (in his high courage, proud) Before his going forth, unto his Mistresse vow'd, He would begin the war: and, to make good the same, Then setting foot in France, there first with hostile flame Forc't Mortain, from her Towers, the neighbouring Townes to light; That suddainly they caught a Fever with the fright. Thin Castle (neere the Towne of Cambray) ours he made; And when the Spanish powers came Britanne to invade, Little Brittanne in France. Both of their aydes and spoyles, them utterly bereft. This English Lyon, there, the Spaniards never left, Till from all aire of France, he made their Lewes fly. And Fame her selfe, to him, so amply did apply, That when the most unjust Calicians had forethought, Into that Towne (then ours) the French-men to have brought, The King of England's selfe, and his renowned sonne Edward III. and the Black-Prince. (By those perfidious French to see what would be done) Under his Guydon marcht, as private souldiers there. So had we still of ours, in France that famous were; Warwick, of England then High-constable that was, As other of that race, heere well I cannot passe; That brave and god-like brood of Beuchamps, which so long Them Earles of Warwick held; so hardy, great, and strong, That after of that name it to an Adage grew, If any man himselfe adventrous hapt to shew, Bold Beuchampe men him tearm'd, if none so bold as hee. Bold Beuchamp; a Proverbe. With those our Beuchamps, may our Bourchers reckned bee. Of which, that valiant Lord, most famous in those dayes, That hazarded in France so many dangerous frayes: Whose blade in all the fights betwixt the French and us, Like to a Blazing-starre was ever ominous; A man, as if by Mars upon Bellona got. Next him, stout Cobham comes, that with as prosprous lot Th'English men hath led; by whose auspicious hand, We often have been known the Frenchmen to command. And Harcourt, though by birth an Alien; yet, ours wonne, By England after held her deere adopted sonne: Which oft upon our part was bravely prov'd to doe, Who with the hard'st attempts Fame earnestly did wooe: To Paris-ward, that when the Amyens fled by stealth (Within her mightie walls to have inclos'd their wealth) Before her bulwarkt gates the Burgesses hee tooke; Whilst the Parisians, thence that sadly stood to looke, And saw their faithfull friends so wofully bestead, Not once durst issue out to helpe them, for their head. And our John Copland; heere courageously at home (Whilst every where in France, those farre abroad doe roame) That at New-castle fight (the Battell of the Queene, Where most the English harts were to their Soveraigne seene) Tooke David King of Scots, his prisoner in the fight. Nor could these warres imploy our onely men of might: But as the Queene by these did mightie things atchieve; So those, to Britaine sent the Countesse to relieve, As any yet of ours, two knights as much that dar'd, Stout Dangorn, and with him strong Hartwell honor shar'd; The dreaded Charles de Bloyes, that at Rochdarren bet, And on the Royall seat, the Countesse Mountfort set. In each place where they came so fortunate were ours. Then, Audley, most renown'd amongst those valiant powers, That with the Prince of Wales at conquer'd Poyters fought; Such wonders that in Armes before both Armies wrought; The first that charg'd the French; and, all that dreadfull day, Through still renewing worlds of danger made his way; The man that scorn'd to take a prisoner (through his pride) But by plaine downe-right death the title to decide. And after the retreat, that famous Battell done, Wherein, rich spacious France was by the English wonne, Five hundred marks in Fee, that noblest Prince bestow'd For his so brave attempts, through his high courage show'd. Which to his foure Esquires The honorable bountie of the Lord Audley. hee freely gave, who there Vy'd valour with their Lord; and in despight of feare, Oft fetcht that day from death, where wounds gap't wide as hell; And cryes, and parting groanes, whereas the Frenchmen fell, Even made the Victors greeve, so horrible they were. Our Dabridgcourt the next shall be remembred heere, At Poyters who brake in upon the Alman Horse Through his too forward speed: but, taken by their force, And after, by the turne of that so doubtfull fight, Beeing reskew'd by his friends in Poyters fearfull sight, Then like a Lyon rang'd about th'Enemies host: And where he might suppose the danger to be most, Like Lightning entred there, to his French-foes dismay, To gratifie his friends which reskew'd him that day. Then Chandos: whose great deeds found Fame so much to doo, That she was lastly forc'd, him for her ease to wooe; That Minion of drad Mars, which almost over-shone All those before him were, and for him none scarce known, At Cambray's scaled wall his credit first that wonne; And by the high exployts in France by him were done, Had all so over-aw'd, that by his very name He could remove a siege: and Citties where he came Would at his Summons yeeld. That man, the most belov'd, In all the wayes of warre so skilfull and approv'd, The The Black-Prince. Prince at Poyters chose his person to assist. This stout Herculean stem, this noble Martialist, In battell twixt brave Bloys and noble Mountfort, try'd At Array, then the right of Britaine to decyde, Rag'd like a furious storme beyond the power of man, Where valiant Charles was slaine, and the sterne English wan The royall British rule to Mountforts nobler name. Hee tooke strong Tarryers in, and Anjou oft did tame. Gavaches he regayn'd, and us Rochmador got. Where ever lay'd hee siege that he invested not? As this brave Warrior was, so no lesse deere to us, The rivall in his fame, his onely æmulus, Renown'd Sir Robert Knowles, that in his glories shar'd, His chivalry and oft in present perills dar'd; As Nature should with Time, at once by these consent To showe, that all their store they idly had not spent. Hee Vermandoise or'e-ranne with skill and courage hie: Notoriously hee plagu'd revolting Picardy: That up to Paris walls did all before him win, And dar'd her at her gates (the King that time within) A man that all his deeds did dedicate to fame. Then those stout Percyes, John, and Thomas, men of name. The valiant Gourney, next, deservedly we grace, And Howet, that with him assumes as high a place. Strong Trivet, all whose ends at great adventures shot: That conquer'd us Mount Pin, and Castle Carcilot, As famous in the French, as in the Belgique warre; Who tooke the Lord Brimewe; and with the great Navarre, In Papaloon, attain'd an everlasting praise. Courageous Carill next, then whom those glorious daies Produc't not any spirit that through more dangers swam. That princely Thomas, next, the Earle of Buckingham, To Britany through France that our stout English brought, Which under his Commaund with such high fortune fought As put the world in feare Rome from her cynders rose, And of this Earth againe meant onely to dispose. Thrice valiant Hackwood then, out-shining all the rest, From London at the first a poore meane souldier prest (That time but very young) to those great warres in France, By his brave service there himselfe did so advance, That afterward, the heat of those great Battels done (In which he to his name immortall glory wonne) Leading sixe thousand Horse, let his brave Guydon flie. So, passing through East France, and entring Lombardie, By th'greatnes of his fame, attayn'd so high Commaund, That to his charge he got the white Italian Band. With The Marquesse of Mountferato. Mountferato then in all his warres he went: Whose cleere report abroad by Fames shrill trumpet sent, Wrought, that with rich rewards him Milan after won, To ayde her, in her warres with Mantua then begon; By Brother to Galeazo, Vicount of Millan. Barnaby, there made the Milanezes guide: His daughter, who, to him, faire Domina, affy'd. For Gregory then the twelfth, he dangerous Battels strooke, And with a noble siege revolted Pavia tooke. And there, as Fortune rose, or as she did decline, Now with the Pisan serv'd, then with the Florentine: The use of th'English Bowes to Italy that brought; By which he, in those warres, seem'd wonders to have wrought. Our Henry Hotspur next, for hie atchievements meet, Who with the thundring noyse of his swift Coursers feet, Astund the earth, that day, that he in Holmdon's strife Tooke Douglas, with the Earles of Anguish, and of Fyfe. And whilst those hardy Scots, upon the firme earth bled, With his revengefull sword swicht after them that fled. Then Calverley, which kept us Calice with such skill, His honor'd roome shall have our Catalogue to fill: Who, when th'rebellious French, their liberty to gaine, From us our ancient right unjustly did detaine (T'let Bullen understand our just conceived ire) Her Suburbs, and her Ships, sent up to heaven in fire; Estaples then tooke in that day shee held her Faire, Whose Marchandise he let his souldiers freely share; And got us back Saint Marks, which loosely wee had lost. Amongst these famous men, of us deserving most, In these of great'st report, we gloriously prefer, For that his navall fight, John Duke of Excester; The puissant Fleet of Jeane (which France to her did call) Who mercilesly sunk, and slew her Admirall. And one, for single fight, amongst our Martiall men, Deserves remembrance heere as worthily agen; Our Clifford, that brave, young, and most courageous Squire: Who thoroughly provokt, and in a great desire Unto the English name a high report to win, Slew Bockmell hand to hand at Castle Jocelin, Suppos'd the noblest spirit that France could then produce. Now, forward to thy taske proceed industrious Muse, To him, above them all, our Power that did advance; John Duke of Bedford, stil'd the fire-brand to sad France: Who to remove the Foe from sieged Harflew, sent, Affrighted them like death; and as at Sea he went, The huge French Navie fier'd, when horrid Neptune ror'd, The whilst those mightie Ships out of their scuppers pour'd Their trayterous cluttred gore upon his wrinkled face. Hee tooke strong Ivery in: and like his kingly race, There downe before Vernoyle the English Standard stuck: And having on his Helme his conquering Brothers luck, Alanzon on the field and doughty Douglasse layd, Which brought the Scottish power unto the Dauphins ayde; And with his fatall sword, gave France her fill of death, Till wearied with her wounds, shee gasping lay for breath. Then, as if powerfull Heaven our part did there abet, Still did one noble spirit, a nobler spirit beget. So, Salsbury arose; from whom, as from a sourse All valour seem'd to flowe, and to maintaine her force. From whom not all their Forts could hold our trecherous Foes. Pontmelance hee regayn'd, which ours before did lose. Against the envious French, at Cravant, then came on; As sometime at the siege of high-rear'd Ilion, The Gods descending, mixt with mortalls in the fight: And in his leading, show'd such valour and such might, As though his hand had held a more then earthly power; Tooke Stuart in the field, and Generall Vantadour, The French and Scottish force, that day which bravely led; Where few at all escap't, and yet the wounded fled. Mount Aguilon, and Mouns, great Salsbury surpriz'd: Great Ordinance.What time (I thinke in hell) that instrument devis'd, The first appear'd in France, as a prodigious birth To plague the wretched world, sent from the envious Earth; Whose very roring seem'd the mighty Round to shake, As though of all againe it would a Chaos make. This famous Generall then got Gwerland to our use, And Malicorne made ours, with Loupland, and La Suise, Saint Bernards Fort, S. Kales, S. Susan, Mayon, Lyle, The Hermitage, Mountseure, Baugency, and Yanvile. Then he (in all her shapes that dreadfull Warre had seene, And that with Danger oft so conversant had beene, As for her threats at last he seem'd not once to care, And Fortune to her face adventurously durst dare) The Earle of Suffolke, Poole, the Marshall that great day At Agincourt, where France before us prostrate lay (Our Battells every where that Hector-like supply'd, And marcht o're murthered pyles of Frenchmen as they dy'd) Invested Aubemerle, rich Cowcy making ours, And at the Bishops Parke or'ethrew the Dolphins powers. Through whose long time in warre, his credit so increast, That hee supply'd the roume of Salsbury deceast. In this our warlike rank, the two stout Astons then, Sir Richard, and Sir John, so truly valiant men, That Ages yet to come shall hardly over-top am, Umfrevill, Peachy, Branch, Mountgomery, Felton, Popham. All men of great Commaund, and highly that deserv'd: Courageous Ramston next, so faithfully that serv'd At Paris, and S. James de Beneon, where we gave The French those deadly foyles, that Ages since deprave The credit of those times, with these so wondrous things, The memory of which, great Warwick forward brings. Who (as though in his blood he conquest did inherit, Or in the very name there were some secret spirit) Being chosen for these warres in our great Regents place (A deadly Foe to France, like his brave Roman race) The Castilets of Loyre, of Maiet, and of Lund, Mountdublian, and the strong Pountorson beat to ground. Then hee, above them all, himselfe that sought to raise, Upon some Mountaine top, like a Piramides; Our Talbot, to the French so terrible in warre, That with his very name their Babes they us'd to scarre, Took-in the strong Lavall, all Main and over-ran, As the betray'd Mons he from the Marshall wan, And from the treacherous Foe our valiant Suffolke free'd. His sharpe and dreadfull sword made France so oft to bleed, Till fainting with her wounds, she on her wrack did fall; Tooke Joïng, where he hung her Traytors on the wall; And with as faire successe wan Beumont upon Oyse, The newe Towne in Esmoy, and Crispin in Valoyes: Creile, with Saint Maxines bridge; and at Avranches ayde, Before whose batter'd walls the Foe was strongly lay'd, Marcht in, as of the siege at all he had not knowne; And happily reliev'd the hardly-gotten Roan: Who at the very hint came with auspicious feet, Whereas the trayt'rous French he miserably beet. And having over-spred all Picardy with warre, Proud Burgaine to the Field hee lastly sent to darre, Which with his English friends so oft his fayth had broake: Whose Countries he made mourne in clowds of smouldring smoak; Then Gysors he againe, then did Saint Denise, raze. His Parallel, with him, the valiant Scales we praise; Which oft put sword to sword, and foot to foot did set: And that the first alone the Garland might not get, With him hath hand in hand leapt into Dangers jawes; And oft would forward put, where Talbot stood to pause: Equalitie in fame, which with an equall lot, Both at Saint Denise siege, and batt'red Guysors got. Before Pont-Orsons walls, who, when great Warwick lay (And he with souldiers sent a forraging for pray) Six thousand French or'e-threw with halfe their numbred powers, And absolutely made both Main and Anjou ours. To Willoughby the next, the place by turne doth fall; Whose courage likely was to beare it from them all: With admiration oft on whom they stood to looke, Saint Valeries proud gates that off the hindges shooke: In Burgondy that forc't the recreant French to flie, And beat the Rebells downe disordering Normandy: That Amiens neere layd waste (whose strengths her could not save) And the perfidious French out of the Country drave. With these, another troupe of noble spirits there sprong, That with the formost preast into the warlike throng. The first of whom we place that stout Sir Phillip Hall, So famous in the fight against the Count S. Paul, That Crotoy us regain'd: and in the conflict twixt The English and the French, that with the Scot were mixt, On proud Charles Cleremont won that admirable day. Strong Fastolph with this man compare we justly may, By Salsbury who oft beeing seriously imploy'd In many a brave attempt, the generall Foe annoy'd; With excellent successe in Main and Anjou fought: And many a Bulwarke there into our keeping brought; And, chosen to goe forth with Vadamont in warre, Most resolutely tooke proud Renate, Duke of Barre. The valiant Draytons then, Sir Richard, and Sir John, By any English spirits yet hardly over-gone; The fame they got in France, with costly wounds that bought: In Gascony and Guyne, who oft and stoutly fought. Then, valiant Mathew Gough: for whom the English were Much bound to noble Wales in all our Battels there, Or sieging or besieg'd that never fayl'd our force, Oft hazarding his blood in many a desperate course. Hee beat the Bastard Balme with his selected band, And at his Castle-gate surpriz'd him hand to hand, And spight of all his power away him prisoner bare. Our hardy Burdet then with him we will compare, Besieg'd within Saint James de Beneon, issuing out, Crying Salsbury, S. George, with such a horrid shout, That cleft the wandring clowds; and with his valiant crew Upon the envied French like hungry Lyons flew, And Arthur Earle of Eure and Richmont tooke in fight: Then following them (in heat) the Armie put to flight: The Britan, French, and Scot, receiv'd a generall sack, As, flying, one fell still upon anothers back; Where our sixe hundred slew so many thousands more. At our so good successe that once a French-man swore That God was wholly turn'd unto the English side, And to assist the French, the divell had deny'd. Then heere our Kerrill claimes his roome amongst the rest, Who justly if compar'd might match our very best. Hee in our warres in France with our great Talbot oft, With Willoughby and Scales, now downe, and then aloft, Endur'd the sundry turnes of often varying Fate; At Cleremont seiz'd the Earle before his Citty gate, Eight hundred faithlesse French who tooke or put to sword; And, by his valour, twice to Artoyse us restor'd. In this our service then great Arondell doth ensue, The Marshall Bousack who in Beuvoys overthrew; And, in despight of France and all her power, did win The Castles Darle, Nellay, S. Lawrence, Bomelin; Tooke Silly, and Count Lore at Sellerin subdu'd, Where with her owners blood, her buildings hee imbru'd: Revolted Loveers sackt, and manfully supprest Those Rebells, that so oft did Normandy molest. As Poynings, such high prayse in Gelderland that got, On the Savoyan side, that with our English shot Strooke warlike Aiske, and Straule, when Flanders shooke with feare. As Howard, by whose hand we so renowned were: Whose great successe at Sea, much fam'd our English Fleet: That in a navall fight the Scottish Barton beet; And setting foote in France, her horribly did fright: (As if great Chandos ghost, or feared Talbots spright Had com'n to be their scourge, their fame againe to earne) Who having stoutly sack't both Narbin and Deverne, The Castles of De Boyes, of Fringes, tooke us there, Of Columburge, of Rewe, of Dorlans, and Daveere; In Scotland, and againe the Marches East to West, Did with invasive warre most terribly infest. A nobler of that name, the Earle of Surry then, That famous Hëroe fit both for the Speare and Pen (From Floddens doubtfull fight, that forward Scottish King In his victorious troupe who home with him did bring) Rebellious Ireland scourg'd, in Britany and wan Us Morles. Happy time, that bredst so brave a man! To Cobham, next, the place deservedly doth fall: In France who then imploy'd with our great Admirall, In his succesfull Road blew Sellois up in fire, Tooke Bottingham and Bruce, with Samkerke and Mansier. Our Peachy, nor our Carre, nor Thomas, shall be hid, That at the Field of Spurres by Tirwyn stoutly did. Sands, Guyldford, Palmer, Lyle, Fitzwilliams, and with them, Brave Dacres, Musgrave, Bray, Coe, Wharton, Jerningham, Great Martialists, and men that were renowned farre At Sea; some in the French, some in the Scottish warre. Courageous Randolph then, that serv'd with great Command, Before Newhaven first, and then in Ireland. The long-renown'd Lord Gray, whose spirit we oft did try; A man that with drad Mars stood in account most hie. Sir Thomas Morgan then, much fame to us that wan, When in our Maiden raigne the Belgique warre began: Who with our friends the Dutch, for England stoutly stood, When Netherland first learn'd to lavish gold and blood. Sir Roger Williams next (of both which, Wales might vaunt) His marshall Compere then, and brave Commilitant: Whose conflicts, with the French and Spanish manly fought, Much honor to their names, and to the Britaines brought. Th'Lord Willoughby may well be reccond with the rest, Inferiour not a whit to any of our best; A man so made for warre, as though from Pallas sprong. Sir Richard Bingham then our valiant men among, Himselfe in Belgia well, and Ireland, who did beare; Our onely Schooles of Warre this later time that were. As, Stanly, whose brave act at Zutphens service done, Sir Edw. Stanley. Much glory to the day, and him his Knighthood wonne. Our noblest Norrice next, whose fame shall never die Whilst Belgia shall be knowne; or there's a Britany: In whose brave height of spirit, Time seem'd as to restore Those, who to th'English name such honor gayn'd of yore. Great Essex, of our Peeres the last that ere we knew; Th'old worlds Heroës lyves who likely'st did renew; The souldiers onely hope, who stoutly serv'd in France; And on the Towers of Cales as proudly did advance Our English Ensignes then, and made Iberia quake, When as our warlike Fleet road on the surging Lake, T'receive that Citties spoyle, which set her batter'd gate Wide ope, t'affrighted Spayne to see her wretched state. Next, Charles, Lord Mountjoy, sent to Ireland to suppresse The envious Rebell there; by whose most faire successe, The trowzed Irish led by their unjust Tyrone, And the proud Spanish force, were justly overthrowne. That still Kinsall shall keepe and faithfull record beare, What by the English prowesse was executed there. Then liv'd those valiant Veres, both men of great Command Sir Francis, and Sir Horace. In our imployments long: whose either Marshall hand Reacht at the highest wreath, it from the top to get, Which on the proudest head, Fame yet had ever set. Our Sir Henry. Dokwray, Sir Edmond. Morgan next, Sir Samuell Bagnall, then Stout Sir Oliver. Lambert, such as well deserve a living pen; True Martialists and Knights, of noble spirit and wit. The valiant Cicill, last, for great imployment fit, Deservedly in warre the lat'st of ours that rose: Whose honor every howre, and fame still greater growes. When now the Kentish Nymphs doe interrupt her Song, By letting Medway knowe shee tarried had too long Upon this warlike troupe, and all upon them layd, Yet for their nobler Kent shee nought or little said. When as the pliant Muse, straight turning her about, And comming to the Land as Medway goeth out, Saluting the deare soyle, ô famous Kent, quoth shee, What Country hath this Ile that can compare with thee, Which hast within thy selfe as much as thou canst wish? Thy Conyes, Venson, Fruit; thy sorts of Fowle and Fish: As what with strength comports, thy Hay, thy Corne, thy Wood: Nor any thing doth want, that any where is good. Where Thames-ward to the shore, which shoots upon the rise, Rich Tenham undertakes thy Closets to suffize With Cherries, which wee say, the Sommer in doth bring, Wherewith Pomona crownes the plump and lustfull Spring; From whose deepe ruddy cheeke, sweet Zephyre kisses steales, With their delicious touch his love-sicke hart that heales. Whose golden Gardens seeme th'Hesperides to mock: Nor there the Damzon wants, nor daintie Abricock, Nor Pippin, which we hold of kernell-fruits the king, The Apple-Orendge; then the savory Russetting: The Peare-maine, which to France long ere to us was knowne, Which carefull Frut'rers now have denizend our owne. The Renat: which though first it from the Pippin came, Growne through his pureness nice, assumes that curious name, Upon the Pippin stock, the Pippin beeing set; As on the Gentle, when the Gentle doth beget (Both by the Sire and Dame beeing anciently descended) The issue borne of them, his blood hath much amended. The Sweeting, for whose sake the Plow-boyes oft make warre: The Wilding, Costard, then the wel-known Pomwater, And sundry other fruits, of good, yet severall taste, That have their sundry names in sundry Countries plac't: Unto whose deare increase the Gardiner spends his life, With Percer, Wimble, Sawe, his Mallet, and his Knife; Oft covereth, oft doth bare the dry and moystned root, As faintly they mislike, or as they kindly sute: And their selected plants doth workman-like bestowe, That in true order they conveniently may growe. And kils the slimie Snayle, the Worme, and labouring Ant, Which many times annoy the graft and tender Plant: Or else maintaines the plot much starved with the wet, Wherein his daintiest fruits in kernels he doth set: Or scrapeth off the mosse, the Trees that oft annoy. But, with these tryfling things why idly doe I toy, Who any way the time intend not to prolong? To those Thamisian Iles now nimbly turnes my Song, Faire Shepey and the Greane sufficiently supply'd, To beautifie the place where Medway showes her pride. But Greane seemes most of all the Medway to adore, And Tenet, standing forth to the Neere Sandwich. Rhutupian shore, By mightie Albion plac't till his returne againe From Gaul; where, after, he by Hercules was slaine. For, Earth-borne Albion then great Neptunes eldest sonne, Ambicious of the fame by sterne Alcides wonne, Would over (needs) to Gaul, with him to hazard fight, Twelve Labors which before accomplisht by his might; His Daughters then but young (on whom was all his care) Which Doris, Thetis Nymph, unto the Gyant bare: With whom those Iles he left; and will'd her for his sake, That in their Grandsires Court shee much of them would make: But Tenet, th'eldst of three, when Albion was to goe, Which lov'd her Father best, and loth to leave him so, There at the Giant raught; which was perceiv'd by chance: This loving Ile would else have followed him to France; To make the chanell wide that then he forced was, Whereas (some say) before he us'd on foot to passe. Thus Tenet being stay'd, and surely setled there, Who nothing lesse then want and idlenes could beare, Doth onely give her selfe to tillage of the ground. With sundry sorts of Graine whilst thus shee doth abound, She falls in love with Stour, which comming downe by Wye, And towards the goodly Ile, his feet doth nimbly ply. To Canterbury then as kindly he resorts, His famous Country thus he gloriously reports; O noble Kent, quoth he, this praise doth thee belong, The hard'st to be controld, impatientest of wrong. Who, when the Norman first with pride and horror sway'd, Threw'st off the servile yoke upon the English lay'd; And with a high resolve, most bravely didst restore That libertie so long enjoy'd by thee before. Not suffring forraine Lawes should thy free Customes bind, Then onely showd'st thy selfe of th'ancient Saxon kind. Of all the English Shires be thou surnam'd the Free, And formost ever plac't, when they shall reckned bee. And let this Towne, which Chiefe of thy rich Country is, Of all the British Sees be still Metropolis. Which having said, the Stour to Tenet him doth hie, Her in his loving armes imbracing by and by, Into the mouth of Tames one arme that forth doth lay, The other thrusting out into the Celtique Sea. Grym Goodwin all this while seems grievously to lowre, Nor cares he of a strawe for Tennet, nor her Stour; Still bearing in his mind a mortall hate to France Since mighty Albions fall by warres incertaine chance. Who, since his wisht revenge not all this while is had, Twixt very griefe and rage is fall'n extreamly mad; That when the rouling Tyde doth stirre him with her waves, Straight foming at the mouth, impatiently he raves, And strives to swallow up the Sea-marks in his Deepe, That warne the wandring ships out of his jawes to keepe. The Surgions of the Sea doe all their skill apply, If possibly, to cure his greevous maladie: As Amphitrites Nymphs their very utmost prove, By all the meanes they could, his madnes to remove. From Greenwich to these Sands, some Scurvigrasse doe bring, Simples frequent in these places.That inwardly apply'd's a wondrous soveraigne thing. From Shepey, Sea-mosse some, to coole his boyling blood; Some, his ill-seasond mouth that wisely understood, Rob Dovers neighboring Cleeves of Sampyre, to excite His dull and sickly taste, and stirre up appetite. Now, Shepey, when shee found shee could no further wade After her mightie Sire, betakes her to his trade, With Sheephooke in her hand, her goodly flocks to heed, And cherisheth the kind of those choice Kentish breed. Of Villages she holds as husbandly a port, As any British Ile that neighboreth Neptunes Court. But Greane, as much as shee her Father that did love (And, then the Inner Land, no further could remove) In such continuall griefe for Albion doth abide, That almost under-flood shee weepeth every Tide. FINIS. THE SECOND PART, OR A CONTINVANCE OF POLY-OLBION FROM THE EIGHTEENTH SONG. Containing all the Tracts, Riuers, Mountaines, and Forrests: Intermixed with the most remarkable Stories, Antiquities, Wonders, Rarities, Pleasures, and Commodities of the East, and Northerne parts of this Isle, lying betwixt the two famous Riuers of Thames, and Tweed. TO THE HIGH AND MIGHTIE, CHARLES PRINCE OF WALES. TO MY HONOR'D FRIEND M?. DRAYTON. Englands brave Genius, raise thy head; and see, We have a Muse in this mortalitie Of Vertue yet survives; All met not Death, When wee intoomb'd our deare Elizabeth. Immortall Sydney, honoured Colin Clout, Presaging what wee feele, went timely out. Then why lives Drayton, when the Times refuse, Both Meanes to live, and Matter for a Muse? Onely without Excuse to leave us quite, And tell us, Durst we act, he durst to write. Now, as the people of a famish'd Towne, Receiving no Supply, seeke up and downe For mouldy Corne, and Bones long cast aside, Wherewith their hunger may bee satisfide: (Small store now left) we are inforc'd to prie And search the darke Leaves of Antiquitie For some good Name, to raise our Muse againe, In this her Crisis, whose harmonious straine Was of such compasse, that no other Nation Durst ever venture on a sole Translation; Whilst our full language, Musicall, and hie, Speakes as themselves their best of Poesie. Drayton, amongst the worthi'st of all those, The glorious Laurell, or the Cyprian Rose Have ever crown'd, doth claime in every Lyne, An equall honor from the sacred Nyne: For if old Time could like the restlesse Maine, Roule himselfe backe into his Spring againe, And on his wings beare this admired Muse, For Ovid, Virgil, Homer, to peruse. They would confesse, that never happier Pen, Sung of his Loves, his Countrey, and the Men. William Browne. TO HIS NOBLE FRIEND, MICHAEL DRAYTON, ESQUIRE, upon his Topo-chrono-graphicall Poeme. From Cornwal's Foreland to the Cliffs of Dover, O're hilly Cambria, and all England over, Thy Muse hath borne me; and (in foure dayes) showne More goodly Prospects, then I could have knowne In foure yeares Travailes; If I had not thus Beene mounted, on thy winged Pegasus. The famous Rivers, the delightsome Fountaines; The fruitfull Vallies, the steepe-rising Mountaines; The new-built Towres, the ancient-ruin'd Walls; The wholsome Baths, the bedds of Mineralls; The nigh-worne Monuments of former Ages; The Workes of Peace, the Marks of Civill-rages; The Woods, the Forrests, and the open Plaines, With whatsoe're this spacious Land containes, For Profit, or for Pleasure: I o're-looke, (As from one Station) when I read thy Booke. Nor doe mine eyes from thence behold alone, Such Things, as for the present there are done; (Or Places, as this day, they doe appeare) But Actions past, and Places as they were A hundred Ages since, as well as now: Which, he that wearies out his feet to know, Shall never finde, nor yet so cheape attaine (With so much ease and profit) halfe that gaine. Good-speed befall Thee; who hast wag'd a Taske, That better Censures, and Rewards doth aske, Then these Times have to give. For, those that should The honor of true Poesy uphold, Are (for the most part) such as doe preferre The fawning Lynes of every Pamphleter, Before the best-writ Poems. And their sight Or cannot, or else dares not, eye the Flight Of free borne Numbers; least bright Virtue's fame, Which flies in those, reflect on Them, their shame. Tis well; thy happy Judgement, could devise, Which way, a man this Age might Poetize, And not write Satyrs: Or else, so to write That scape thou mayst, the clutches of Despight. For, through such Woods, and Rivers, trips thy Muse, As, will or loose, or drowne him, that pursues. Had my Invention (which I know too weake) Enabled been, so brave a Flight to make; (Should my unlucky Penn have overgone So many a Province, and so many a Towne) Though I to no mans wrong had gone astray, I had been pounded on the Kings hye way. But thou hast better Fortune, and hast chose So brave a Patron, that thou canst not lose By this Adventure. For, in Him, survives His Brother Henrie's Virtues: and hee lives To be that Comfort to thy Muse, which Hee Had nobly (e're his death) begun to be. Yet, overmuch presume not, that these Times, Will therefore value thy Heroick Rymes, According to their Merit. For, although, Hee, and some fewe, the worth of them shall know: This is their Fate. (And some unborne, will say, I spake the Truth; what e're men thinke to Day) Ages to come, shall hugg thy Poesy, As we our deare Friends Pictures, when they dye. Shose that succeed us, Draytons Name shall love, And, so much this laborious Peece approove; That such as write heereafter, shall to trim Their new Inventions, pluck it limbe from limbe. And our great-Grandsonnes Childrens-children may, (Yea shall) as in a Glasse, this Isle survay, As wee now see it: And as those did to, Who lived many hundred yeares agoe. For, when the Seas shall eat away the Shore, Great Woods spring up, where Plaines were heretofore; High Mountaines leveld with low Vallyes lye; And Rivers runne where now the ground is drie: This Poeme shall grow famous, And declare What old-Things stood, where new-Things shall appeare. And hereunto his Name subscribeth He, Who shall by this Prædiction, live with Thee. George Wither. TO MY WORTHY FRIEND MICHAEL DRAYTON, ESQUIRE. An Acrosticke Sonnet upon his Name. Must Albion thus bee Stellified by thee, In her full pompe, that her the world may praise, Cheerefull, Brave Isle, yea shall I live to see Him thus to decke, and crowne thy Front with Bayes, And shall I not in Zeale, and Merit too Expresse to thee my Joy, my Thankes to him; Lesse (sure) then this I may not, will not doe. Drayton, sith still Parnassus thou doest clime, Right like thy selfe, whose Heaven-inspired Muse, As doth the Phenix still her selfe renewing, Yee into other the like life infuse; Thou his rich Subject, he thy Fame pursuing. O hadst thou lov'd him, as hee thee hath done, No Land such Honor, (to all times) had wonne. John Reynolds. POLY-OLBION. [THE SECOND PART.] The nineteenth Booke The Argument. The Muse, now over Thames makes forth, Upon her Progresse to the North, From Cauney with a full carrere, Shee up against the streame doth beare; Where Waltham Forrests pride exprest, Shee poynts directly to the East, And shewes how all those Rivers straine Through Essex, to the German mayne; When Stoure, with Orwels ayd prefers, Our Brittish brave Sea-voyagers; Halfe Suffolke in with them shee takes, Where of this Song an end shee makes. Beare bravely up my Muse, the way thou went'st before, And crosse the kingly Thames to the Essexian shore, An Iland lying in the Thames, on Essex side. Stem up his tyde-full streame, upon that side to rise, Where Albion fained to be the son of Neptune, going over into France to fight with Hercules, by whom he was vanquished, is supposed to leave his children, the Iles of Thanet, Sheppey, Greane, and this Cauney, lying in the mouth of Thames, to the tuition of Neptune their grand father. See to the latter end of the 18. Song. Canvey, Albions child in-Iled richly lyes, Which, though her lower scite doth make her seeme but meane, Of him as dearly lov'd as Shepey is or Greane, And him as dearly lov'd; for when he would depart, With Hercules to fight, she tooke it so to heart, That falling low and flat, her blubberd face to hide, By Thames shee welneere is surrounded every tyde: And since of worldly State, she never taketh keepe, But onely gives her selfe, to tend, and milke her sheepe. But Muse, from her so low, divert thy high-set song To London-wards, and bring from Lea with thee along The Forrests, and the Floods, and most exactly show, How these in order stand, how those directly flow: For in that happy soyle, doth pleasure ever wonne, Through Forrests, where cleere Rills in wild Meanders runne; Where daintie Summer Bowers, and Arborets are made, Cut out of Busshy thicks, for coolenesse of the shade. Fooles gaze at painted Courts, to th'countrey let me goe, To climbe the easie hill, then walke, the valley lowe; No gold-embossed Roofes, to me are like the woods; No Bed like to the grasse, nor liquor like the floods: A Citie's but a sinke, gay houses gawdy graves, The Muses have free leave, to starve or live in caves: The brave scituation of Waltham Forrest.But Waltham Forrest still in prosperous estate, As standing to this day (so strangely fortunate) Above her neighbour Nymphs, and holds her head aloft; A turfe beyond them all, so sleeke and wondrous soft, Upon her setting side, by goodly London grac'd, Upon the North by Lea, her South by Thames embrac'd. Upon her rising point, shee chaunced to espie, A daintie Forrest-Nymph of her societie. Hatfield Forest lying lower towards the East betweene Stortford and Dunmow.Faire Hatfield, which in height all other did surmount, And of the Dryades held in very high account; Yet in respect of her stood farre out of the way, Who doubting of her selfe, by others late decay, Her sisters glory view'd with an astonish'd eye, Whom Waltham wisely thus reprooveth by and by. Deare Sister rest content, nor our declining rue, What thing is in this world (that we can say) is new; The Ridge and Furrow shewes, that once the crooked Plow, Turn'd up the grassy turfe, where Okes are rooted now: And at this houre we see, the Share and Coulter teare The full corne-bearing gleabe, where sometimes forrests were; And those but Caitifes are, which most doe seeke our spoyle, Who having sold our woods, doe lastly sell our soyle; Tis vertue to give place to these ungodly times, When as the fostred ill proceeds from others crimes; Gainst Lunatiks, and fooles, what wise folke spend their force; For folly headlong falls, when it hath had the course: And when God gives men up, to wayes abhor'd and vile, Of understanding hee deprives them quite, the while They into errour runne, confounded in their sinne, As simple Fowles in lyme, or in the Fowlers gynne. And for those prettie Birds, that wont in us to sing, They shall at last forbeare to welcome in the Spring, When wanting where to pearch, they sit upon the ground, And curse them in their Notes, who first did woods confound. Deare Sister Hatfield, then hold up thy drooping head, We feele no such decay, nor is all succour fled: For Essex is our dower, which greatly doth abound, With every simple good, that in the Ile is found: And though we goe to wracke in this so generall waste, This hope to us remaines, we yet may be the last. When Hatfield taking heart, where late she sadly stood, Many Townes that stand on this River, have her name as an addition: as Kythorp Roding, Leaden Roding, with many other. Sends little Roding foorth, her best-beloved Flood; Which from her Christall Fount, as to enlarge her fame, To many a Village lends, her cleere and noble name, Which as she wandreth on, through Waltham holds her way, With goodly Oken wreaths, which makes her wondrous gay; But making at the last into the watry Marsh, Where though the blady grasse unwholesome be and harsh, Those wreaths away she casts, which bounteous Waltham gave, With Bulrush, Flags, and Reed, to make her wondrous brave, And her selves strength divides, to sundry lesser streames, So wantoning shee falls into her Soveraigne Thames. From whose vast Beechy bankes a rumor straight resounds, Which quickly ran it selfe through the Essexian grounds, That Crouch amongst the rest, a Rivers name should seeke, As scorning any more the nickname of a Creeke, Well furnisht with a Streame, that from the fill to fall, Wants nothing that a Flood should be adorn'd withall. On The fruitfulst Hundred of Essex. Benge's Batfull side, and at her going out, With Walnot, Foulnesse faire, neere watred round about. Two Iles for greater state to stay her up that stand, Thrust farre into the Sea, yet fixed to the land; As Nature in that sort them purposely had plac'd, That shee by Sea and Land, should every way be grac'd. Some Sea-Nymphs and besides, her part (there were) that tooke, As angry that their Crouch should not be cald a Brooke; And bad her to complaine to Neptune of her wrong. But whilst these grievous stirres thus hapned them among, Choice Chelmer comes along, a Nymph most neatly cleere, Chelmsford (abruptly Cheynsford) as much to say, as the Ford upon the River Chelmer. Which welneere through the midst doth cut the wealthy Sheere, By Dunmow gliding downe to Chelmsford hold her chase, To which she gives the name, which as she doth imbrace Cleere Can comes tripping in, and doth with Chelmer close: With whose supply (though small as yet) she greater growes. She for old Anciently called Camolodunum where these ominous signes foreran that great overthrow given to the Roman Colony by the Britans. See the 8. Song. Maldon makes, where in her passing by, Shee to remembrance calls that Roman Colony, And all those ominous signes her fall that did foregoe, As that which most expres'd their fatall overthrow; Crown'd Victory reverst, fell downe whereas shee stood, And the vast greenish Sea, discoloured like to blood. Shreeks heard like peoples cries, that see their deaths at hand; The pourtratures of men imprinted in the sand. When Chelmer scarce arrives in her most wished Bay, But Blakwater comes in, through many a crooked way, Which Pant was call'd of yore; but that, by Time exild, Shee Froshwell after hight, then Blakwater instil'd, But few, such titles have the British Floods among. When Northey neere at hand, and th'Ile of Ousey rung With shouts the Sea-Nymphs gave, for joy of their arrive, As either of those Iles in curtesie doe strive, To Tethis Darlings, which should greatest honor doe; And what the former did, the latter adds thereto. But Colne, which frankly lends faire Colechester her name, (On all the Essexian shore, the Towne of greatest fame) Perceiving how they still in Courtship did contend, Quoth she, wherefore the time thus idly doe you spend? What is there nothing here, that you esteeme of worth, That our big-bellied Sea, or our rich land brings forth? Thinke you our Oysters here, unworthy of your praise? Pure Walfleet Oysters. Walfleet, which doe still the daintiest pallats please: As excellent as those, which are esteemed most. Cizicum is a city of Bythinia. Lucrinia is a citie of Apulia upon the Adriatick Sea; the Oysters of which places, were reckoned for great delicates with the Romans.The Cizic shels, or those on the Lucrinian coast; Or Cheese, which our fat soyle to every quarter sends; Whose tacke the hungry Clowne, and Plow-man so commends. If you esteeme not these, as things above the ground, Looke under, where the Urnes of ancient times are found: The Roman Emp'rours Coynes, oft dig'd out of the dust, And warlike Weapons, now consum'd with cankring rust: The huge and massy Bones, of mighty fearefull men, The bones of Gyantlike people found in those parts.To tell the worlds full strength, what creatures lived then; When in her height of youth, the lustie fruitfull earth Brought foorth her big-limb'd brood, even Gyants in their birth. Thus spoke shee, when from Sea they suddenly doe heare A strong and horrid noyse, which struck the land with feare: For with their crooked Trumps, his Tritons, Neptune sent, To warne the wanton Nymphs, that they incontinent Should straight repaire to Stour, in Orwells pleasant Road; For it had been divulg'd the Ocean all abroad, That Orwell and this Stour, by meeting in one Bay, Two, that each others good, intended every way, Prepar'd to sing a Song, that should precisely show, That Medway for her life, their skill could not out-goe: Medway in the 18. Song, reciteth the Catalogue of the English Warriors. For Stour, a daintie flood, that duly doth divide Faire Suffolke from this Shire, upon her other side; By Clare first comming in, to Sudbury doth show, The even course she keepes; when farre she doth not flow, But Breton a bright Nymph, fresh succour to her brings: Yet is she not so proud of her superfluous Springs, But Orwell comming in from Ipswitch thinkes that shee, Should stand for it with Stour, and lastly they agree, That since the Britans hence their first Discoveries made, And that into the East they first were taught to trade. Besides, of all the Roads, and Havens of the East, This Harbor where they meet, is reckoned for the best. Our Voyages by Sea, and brave discoveries knowne, Their argument they make, and thus they sing their owne; In Severns late tun'd lay, that Empresse of the West, See the 4. Song. In which great Arthurs actes are to the life exprest: His Conquests to the North, who Norway did invade, Who Groneland, Iseland next, then Lapland lastly made His awfull Empires bounds, the Britans acts among, This God-like Heroes deeds exactly have beene sung: His valiant people then, who to those Countries brought, Which many an age since that, our great'st discoveries thought. This worthiest then of ours, our Sea-voyages. Argonauts shall lead. Next Malgo, who againe that Conquerors steps to tread, Succeeding him in Raigne, in conquests so no lesse, Plow'd up the frozen Sea, and with as faire successe, By that great Conquerors claime, first Orkney overran; Proud Denmarke then subdu'd, and spacious Norway wan, Ceasd Iseland for his owne, and Goteland to each shore, Where Arthurs full-saild Fleet had ever toucht before. And when the Britans Raigne came after to decline, And to the Cambrian hils their fate did them confine, The Saxon swaying all, in Alfreds powerfull raigne, Our English Octer put a Fleet to Sea againe, Of th'uge Norwegian Hilles, and newes did hither bring, Whose tops are hardly wrought in twelve dayes travailing. But leaving Norway then a Sterboard, forward kept, And with our English Sayles that mightie Ocean swept, Where those sterne people wonne, whom hope of gaine doth call In Hulkes with grapling hooks, to hunt the dreadfull Whall; The great river of Russia.And great Duina downe from her first springing place, Doth roule her swelling waves in churlish Neptunes face. Then Woolstan after him discovering Dansig found, The greatest river of Danske.Where Wixels mighty mouth is powrd into the Sound, And towing up his streame, first taught the English Oares, The usefull way of Trade to those most gainefull shores. And when the Norman Stem here strong and potent grew, And their successefull sonnes, did glorious acts pursue, One Nicholas nam'd of Lyn, where first he breath'd the ayre, Though Oxford taught him Art, and well may hold him deare: Ith' Mathematicks learnd, (although a Fryer profest) To see those Northerne Climes, with great desire possest, Himselfe he thither ship'd, and skilfull in the Globe, Tooke every severall height with his true Astrolobe; The greatest wonder of Nature.The Whirlpooles of the seas, and came to understand, From the foure Card'nall winds, foure indraughts that command Int'any of whose falls, if th'wandring Barque doth light, It hurried is away with such tempestuous flight, Into that swallowing gulfe, which seemes as it would draw The very earth it selfe into th'infernall maw. Foure such Immeasur'd Pooles, Phylosophers agree, Ith foure parts of the world undoubtedly to bee; From which they have supposd, Nature the winds doth raise, And from them to proceed the flowing of the Seas. And when our Civill warres began at last to cease, And these late calmer times of Olive-bearing Peace, Gave leasure to great Minds, farre Regions to descry; That brave adventrous Knight, our Sir Hugh Willoughby, Ship'd for the Northren Seas, mongst those congealed Piles, Fashioned by lasting Frosts, like Mountaines, and like Iles, (In all her fearefulst shapes saw Horror, whose great mind, In lesser bounds then these, that could not be confin'd, Adventured on those parts, where Winter still doth keepe; When most the Icy cold had chaind up all the Deepe) In Bleake Arzina's Road his death neere Lapland tooke, Where Kegor from her scite, on those grim Seas doth looke. Two others follow then, eternall fame that wonne, Our Chancellor, and with him, compare we Jenkinson: For Russia both imbarqu'd, the first ariving there, Entring Duina's mouth, up her proud streame did steere To Volgad, to behold her pompe, the Russian State, Moscovia measuring then; the other with like Fate, Both those vast Realmes survay'd, then into Bactria past, To Boghors bulwarkt walls, then to the liquid wast, Where Oxus roleth downe twixt his farre distant shores, And o're the Caspian Maine, with strong untyred Oares, Adventured to view rich Persias wealth and pride, Whose true report thereof, the English since have tride. With Fitch, our Eldred next, deserv'dly placed is; Both travailing to see, the Syrian Tripolis. The first of which (in this whose noble spirit was showne) To view those parts, to us that were the most unknowne, On thence to Ormus set, Goa, Cambaya, then, To vast Zelabdim, thence to Echubar, agen Crost Ganges mighty streame, and his large bankes did view, To Baccola went on, to Bengola, Pegu; And for Mallaccan then, Zeiten, and Cochin cast, Measuring with many a step, the great East-Indian wast. The other from that place, the first before had gone, Determining to see the broad-wald Babylon, Crost Euphrates, and row'd against his mightie streame; Licia, and Gaza saw, with great Hierusalem, And our deare Saviours seat, blest Bethlem did behold, And Jourdan, of whose waves, much is in Scriptures told. Then Macham, who (through love to long adventures led) Mederas wealthy Iles, the first discovered, Who having stolne a mayd, to whom he was affi'd, Yet her rich parents still her marriage rites deni'd, Put with her foorth to Sea, where many a danger past, Upon an Ile of those, at length by tempest cast; And putting in, to give his tender Love some ease, Which very ill had brook'd, the rough and boystrous Seas; And lingring for her health, within the quiet Bay, The Mariners most false, fled with the Ship away, When as it was not long, but shee gave up her breath; When he whose teares in vaine bewayld her timelesse death: That their deserved Rites her Funerall could not have, A homely Altar built upon her honoured grave. When with his folke but few, not passing two or three, The wonderful Adventure of Macham.There making them a Boat, but rudely of one Tree, Put foorth againe to Sea, where after many a flaw, Such as before themselves, scarce Mortall ever saw; Nor miserable men could possibly sustaine, Now swallowed with the waves, and then spu'd up againe; At length were on the coast of Sun-burnt Affrick throwne: T'amaze that further world, and to amuse our owne. Then Windham who new wayes, for us and ours to trie, For great Morrocco made, discovering Barbarie. Lock, Towerson, Fenner next, vast Guiney forth that sought, And of her Ivory, home in great abundance brought. The East-Indian Voy'ger then, the valiant Lancaster, To Buona Esperance, Comara, Zanziber, To Nicuba, as hee to Gomerpolo went, Till his strong Bottome strucke Molluccos Continent; And sayling to Brazeel another time he tooke Olynda's chiefest Towne, and Harbour Farnambuke, And with their precious Wood, Sugar, and Cotton fraught, It by his safe returne, into his Countrie brought. Then Forbosher, whose fame flew all the Ocean o'r, Who to the Northwest sought, huge China's wealthy shore, When nearer to the North, that wandring Sea-man set, Where hee in our hotst Mon'ths of June and July met With Snow, Frost, Haile, &amp; Sleet, and found sterne Winter strong With mighty Iles of Ice, and Mountaines huge and long. Where as it comes and goes, the great eternall Light, Makes halfe the yeare still day, and halfe continuall night. Mæta Incognita.Then for those Bounds unknown, he bravely set againe, As he a Sea-god were, familiar with the Maine. The Noble Fenton next, and Jackman we preferre, Both Voyagers, that were with famous Forbosher. And Davies, three times forth that for the Northwest made; Still striving by that course, t'inrich the English Trade: And as he well deserv'd to his eternall fame. There by a mightie Sea, Imortaliz'd his Name. Mare Davisium. With noble Gilbert next, comes Hoard who tooke in hand To cleere the course scarse knowne into the New-found Land, And view'd the plenteous Seas, and fishfull Havens, where Our neighbouring Nations since have stor'd them every yeare. Then Globe-engirdling Drake, the Navall Palme that wonne, Who strove in his long Course to emulate the Sunne: Of whom the Spaniard us'd a Prophecie to tell, That from the British Isles should rise a Dragon fell, That with his armed wings, should strike th'Iberian Maine, And bring in after time much horror upon Spaine. This more then man (or what) this Demie-god at Sea, Leaving behind his backe, the great America, Upon the surging Maine his wel-stretch't Tacklings flewd, To fortie three Degrees of North'ly Latitude; Unto that Land before to th'Christian world unknowne, Which in his Countries right he nam'd New Albion; And in the Westerne Inde, spight of the power of Spaine, Hee Saint Iago tooke, Domingo, Cartagene: And leaving of his prowesse, a marke in every Bay, Saint Augustins surpriz'd, in Terra Florida. Then those that foorth for Sea, Industrious Rawleigh wrought, And them with every thing, fit for discovery fraught; That Amadas, (whose Name doth scarsely English sound) With Barlow, who the first Virginia throughly found. As Greenvile, whom he got to undertake that Sea, Three sundry times from hence, who touch'd Virginia. (In his so rare a choyce, it well approov'd his wit; That with so brave a Spirit, his turne so well could fit. O Greenvile, thy great Name, for ever be renown'd, And borne by Neptune still, about this mightie Round; Whose Navall Conflict wanne thy Nation so much fame, And in th'Iberians bred feare of the English name. Nor should Fame speake her low'dst, Of Lane, shee could not lie, Who in Virginia left, with th'English Colony, Himselfe so bravely bare, amongst our people there, That him they onely lov'd, when others they did feare. And from those Barbarous, brute, and wild Virginians wan Such reverence, as in him there had been more then man. Then he which favoured still, such high attempts as these, Rawleigh, whose reading made him ski'd in all the Seas, Imbarqu'd his worthy selfe, and his adventurous crue, And with a prosperous Sayle to those faire Countries flew, Where Orenoque, as he, on in his course doth roule, Seemes as his greatnes meant, grim Neptune to controule; Like to a puisant King, whose Realmes extend so farre, That many a potent Prince his Tributaries are. So are his Branches Seas, and in the rich Guiana, A Flood as proud as he, the broad-brim'd Orellana: And on the spacious firme Manoas mightie seat, The land (by Natures power) with wonders most repleat. So Leigh, Cape Briton saw, and Rameas Iles againe; As Tompson undertooke the Voyage to New-Spaine: And Hawkins not behind, the best of these before, Who hoysing sayle, to seeke the most remotest shore, Upon that new-nam'd Spaine, and Guinny sought his prize, As one whose mighty mind small things could not suffice, The sonne of his brave Syre, who with his furrowing Keele, Long ere that time had touch'd the goodly rich Brazeel. Couragious Candish then, a second Neptune here, Whose fame fild every mouth, and tooke up every eare. What man could in his time discourse of any Seas, But of brave Candish talk'd, and of his voyages; Who through the South Seas past, about this earthly Ball, And saw those Starres, to them that onely rise and fall, And with his silken sayles, stayn'd with the richest Ore, Dar'd any one to passe where he had been before. Count Cumberland, so hence to seeke th'Asores sent, And to the Westerne-Inde, to Porta Ricco went, And with the English power it bravely did surprize. Sir Robert Dudley then, by sea that sought to rise, Hoyst Sayles with happy winds to th'Iles of Trinidado: Paria then he past, the Ilands of Granado; As those of Sancta Cruz, and Porta Ricco: then Amongst the famous ranke of our Sea-searching men, Is Preston sent to Sea, with Summers foorth to finde, Adventures in the parts upon the Westerne-Inde; Port Santo who surpriz'd, and Coches, with the Fort Of Coro, and the Towne, when in submissive sort, Cumana ransome crav'd, Saint James of Leon sack'd; Jamica went not free, but as the rest they wrack'd. Then Sherley, (since whose name such high renowne hath won) That Voyage undertooke, as they before had done: He Saint Iago saw, Domingo, Margarita, By Terra firma sayl'd to th'Ilands of Jamica, Up Rio Dolce row'd, and with a prosperous hand, Returning to his home, touch'd at the New-found-land, Where at Jamicas Iles, couragious Parker met With Sherley, and along up Rio Dolce set, Where bidding him adue, on his owne course he ran, And tooke Campeches Towne, the chief'st of Jucatan. A Freegate, and from thence did home to Britan bring, With most strange Tribute fraught, due to that Indian King, At mightie Neptunes beck, thus ended they their Song, When as from Harwich all to Loving-land along, Great claps and shouts were heard resounding to the shore, Wherewith th' Essexian Nymphs applaud their loved Stour, From the Suffolcean side yet those which Stour preferre Their princely Orwell praise, as much as th'other her: For though cleare Briton be rich Suffolkes from her spring, Which Stour upon her way to Harwich downe doth bring, Yet Deben of her selfe a stout and stedfast friend, Her succour to that Sea, neere Orwels Road doth send. When Waveney to the North, rich Suffolks onely meere, Suffolke bounded on the South and North. As Stour upon the North, from Essex parts this Sheere; Lest Stour and Orwell thus might steale her Nymphes away, In Neptunes name commands, that here their force should stay: For that her selfe and Yar in honor of the Deepe, Were purposed a Feast in Loving-land to keepe. The twentieth Song. The Argument. The Muse that part of Suffolke sings, That lyes to Norfolke, and then brings The bright Norfolcean Nymphes, to ghest To Loving-land, to Neptunes Feast; To Ouze the lesse then downe shee takes, Where shee a Flight at River makes: And thence to Marsh-land shee descends, With whose free praise this Song shee ends. From Suffolke rose a sound, through the Norfolcean shore That ran it selfe, the like had not bin heard before: For he that doth of Sea the powerful Trident weld, His Tritons made proclaime, a A meeting, or Feast of Nymphs. Nymphall to be held In honor of himselfe, in Loving-land, where he The most selected Nymphes appointed had to be. Those Seamayds that about his secret walkes doe dwell, Which tend his mightie heards of Whales, and Fishes fell, As of the Rivers those, amongst the Meadowes ranke, That play in every Foar'd, and sport on every banke, Were summon'd to be there, in paine of Neptunes hate: For he would have his Feast, observ'd with god-like state, When those Suffolcean Floods, that sided not with Stoure, Their streames but of themselves into the Ocean powre, As Or, through all the coast a Flood of wondrous fame, Whose honored fall begets a Orford Haven. Haven of her name. And Blyth a daintie Brooke, their speedy course doe cast, For Neptune with the rest, to Loving-land to hast: When Waveney in her way, on this Septentriall side, That these two Easterne Shires doth equally divide, From The place of her Spring. Laphamford leads on, her streame into the East, By Bungey, then along by Beckles, when possest Of Loving-land, 'bout which her limber Armes she throwes, With Neptune taking hands, betwixt them who inclose, And her an Iland make, fam'd for her scite so farre. But leave her Muse awhile, and let us on with Yar, Which Gariena some, some Hier, some Yar doe name; Who rising from her spring not farre from Walsingham, At Gatesend not far thence.Through the Norfolcean fields seemes wantonly to play, To Norwich comes at length, towards Yarmouth on her way, Where Wentsum from the South, and Bariden doe beare Up with her, by whose wealth she much is honored there, To intertaine her Yar, that in her state doth stand, Norwich, in place the 4. city of England.With Townes of high'st account, the fourth of all the land: That hospitable place to the Industrious Dutch, The Dutch a most industrious poeple.Whose skill in making Stuffes, and workmanship is such, (For refuge hither come) as they our ayd deserve, By labour sore that live, whilst oft the English starve; On Roots, and Pulse that feed, on Beefe and Mutton spare, So frugally they live, not gluttons as we are. But from my former Theame, since thus I have digrest, Ile borrow more of Time, untill my Nymphs be drest: And since these Foods fall out so fitly in my way, A little while to them I will convert my Lay. Roots and Garden-fruits of this Iland.The Colewort, Colifloure, and Cabidge in their season, The Rouncefall, great Beanes, and early ripening Peason; The Onion, Scallion, Leeke, which Housewives highly rate; Their kinsman Garlicke then, the poore mans Mithridate; The savory Parsnip next, and Carret pleasing food; The Skirret (which some say) in Sallats stirres the blood; The Turnip, tasting well to Clownes in Winter weather. Thus in our verse we put, Roots, Hearbs, and Fruits together. The great moyst Pumpion then, that on the ground doth lie, A purer of his kind, the sweet Muske-million by; Which dainty pallats now, because they would not want, Have kindly learnt to set, as yearely to transplant: The Radish somewhat hote, yet urine doth provoke; The Cucumber as cold, the heating Artichoke; The Citrons, which our soyle not easly doth affourd; The Rampion rare as that, the hardly gotten Gourd. But in these triviall things, Muse, wander not too long, But now to nimble Yar, turne we our active Song, Which in her winding course, from Norwich to the Mayne, So called by the falling of Yar into the Sea.By many a stately seat lasciviously doth straine, To Yarmouth till she come, her onely christned Towne, Whose fishing through the Realme, doth her so much renowne, Where those that with their nets still haunt the boundles lake, Her such a sumptuous feast of salted Herrings make, As they had rob'd the Sea of all his former store, And past that very howre, it could produce no more. Her owne selves Harbour here, when Yar doth hardly win, But kindly she againe, saluted is by Thrin, A faire Norfolcean Nymph, which gratifies her fall. Now are the Supposed to be Trumpeters to Neptune. Tritons heard, to Loving-land to call, Which Neptunes great commaunds, before them bravely beare, Commanding all the Nymphs of high account that were, Which in fat Holland lurke amongst the queachy plashes, Or play them on the sands, upon the fomy washes, As all the watry brood, which haunt the German deepes, Upon whose briny Curles, the dewy morning weepes, To Loving-land to come, and in their best attires, That meeting to observe, as now the time requires. When Erix, Neptunes sonne by Venus, to the shore To see them safely brought, their Herault came before, And for a Mace he held in his huge hand, the horne Of that so-much-esteem'd, sea-honoring Unicorne. The vertuall properties incident to waters, as well Seas, as Rivers, expressed by their names in the persons of Nymphs, as hath bin used by the Ancients. Next Proto wondrous swift, led all the rest the way, Then she which makes the calmes, the mild Cymodice, With god-like Dorida, and Galatea faire, With daintie Nets of pearle, cast o'r their braided haire: Analiis which the Sea doth salt, and seasoned keepe; And Batheas, most supreame and soveraigne in the deepe, Brings Cyane, to the waves which that greene colour gives; Then Atmis, which in Fogs and mistie vapours lives: Phrinax, the Billowes rough, and surges that bestrides, And Rothion, that by her on the wilde waters rides; With Icthias, that of Frye the keeping doth retaine, As Pholoë, most that rules the Monsters of the Maine: Which brought to beare them out, if any need should fall, The Dolphin, Sea-horse, Gramp, the Wherlpoole, and the Whall. An hundred more besides, I readily could name, With these as Neptune wil'd, to Loving-land that came. These Nymphs trick'd up in tyers, the Sea-gods to delight: Of Currall of each kind, the blacke, the red, the white; The delicacies of the Sea. With many sundry shels, the Scallop large, and faire; The Cockle small and round, the Periwinkle spare, The Oyster, wherein oft the pearle is found to breed, The Mussell, which retaines that daintie Orient seed: In Chaines and Bracelets made, with linkes of sundry twists, Some worne about their wasts, their necks, some on the wrists. Great store of Amber there, and Jeat they did not misse; Their lips they sweetned had with costly Ambergris. Scarcely the Sea-Nymphs. Neriad's thus arrived from the Seas, But from the fresher streames the brighter Nymphs of Rivers. Niades, To Loving-land make haste with all the speed they may, For feare their fellow-Nymphes should for their comming stay. Glico the running Streames in sweetnesse still that keepes, And Clymene which rules, when they surround their deepes. Spio, in hollow bankes, the waters that doth hide: With Opis that doth beare them backward with the Tyde. Semaia that for sights doth keepe the water cleare: Zanthe their yellow sands, that maketh to appeare, Then Drymo for the Okes that shaddow every banke, Phylodice, the boughs for Garlands fresh and ranke. Which the cleare Naiades make them Coronets of Flowers. Anadems withall, When they are cald to daunse in Neptunes mightie hall. Then Ligea, which maintaines the Birds harmonious layes, Which sing on Rivers banks amongst the slender sprayes, With Rhodia, which for them doth nurse the Roseat sets, Ioida, which preserves the azure Violets. Anthea, of the flowers, that hath the generall charge, And Syrinx of the Reeds, that grow upon the Marge. Some of these lovely Nymphes wore on their flaxen haire Fine Chaplets made of Flaggs, that fully flowred were: With Water-cans againe, some wantonly them dight, Whose larger leafe and flower, gave wonderfull delight To those that wistly view'd their Beauties: some againe, That soveraigne places held amongst the watry traine, Of Cat-tayles made them Crownes, which from the Sedge doth grow, Which neatly woven were, and some to grace the show, Of Lady-smocks most white, doe rob each neighbouring Mead, Wherewith their looser locks most curiously they breyd. Now thus together com'n, they friendly doe devise, Some of light toyes, and some of matters grave and wise. But to breake off their speech, her reed when Syrinx sounds, Some cast themselves in Rings, and fell to Hornepipe rounds: They ceasing, as againe to others turnes it falls, They lustie Galiards tread, some others Jiggs, and Braules. This done, upon the banke together being set, Proceeding in the cause, for which they thus were met, In mightie Neptunes praise, these Sea-borne Virgins sing: The Song of the Sea-Nymphs in praise of Neptune. Let earth, and ayre, say they with the high praises ring, Of Saturne by his Ops, the most renowned Sonne, From all the gods but Jove, the Diadem that wonne, Whose ofspring wise and strong, deare Nymphes let us relate, On mountaines of vast waves, know he that sits in state, And with his Trident rules, the universall streame, To be the onely syre of mightie Polypheme. On fayre Thoosa got old Phorcus loved child, Who in a fained shape that god of Sea beguild. Three thousand princely sonnes, and lovely Nymphs as we, Were to great Neptune borne, of which we sparing be: Some by his goodly Queene, some in his Lemmans bed; Chryasor grim begot, on sterne Medusas head. Swart Brontes, for his owne so mightie Neptune takes, One of the Cyclops strong, Joves Thunder-bolts that makes. Great Neptune, Nelius got, (if you for wisedome seeke) Who was old Nestors syre, the grav'st and wisest Greeke. Or from this King of waves, of such thou lov'st to heare, Of famous Nations first, that mightie Founders were; Then Cadmus, who the plot of ancient Thebes contriv'd, From Neptune God of Sea, his Pedigree deriv'd, By Agenor his old Syer, who rul'd Phenicia long: So Inachus, the chiefe of Argives great and strong Claim'd kinred of this King, and by some beautious Neece, So did Pelasgus too, who peopled ancient Greece. A world of mightie Kings and Princes I could name, From our god Neptune sprung; let this suffice, his fame Incompasseth the world; those Starres which never rise, Above the lower South, are never from his eyes: As those againe to him doe every day appeare, Continually that keepe the Northerne Hemisphere; Who like a mightie King, doth cast his Watched robe, Farre wider then the land, quite round about the Globe. Where is there one to him that may compared be, That both the Poles at once continually doth see; And Gyant-like with heaven as often maketh warres; The Ilands (in his power) as numberlesse as Starres, He washeth at his will, and with his mightie hands, He makes the even shores, oft mountainous with Sands: Whose creatures, which observe his wide Emperiall seat, Like his immeasured selfe, are infinite and great. Thus ended they their Song, and off th'assembly brake, When quickly towards the west, the Muse her way doth take; Whereas the swelling soyle, as from one banke doth bring This The fountaines of these rivers, not farre asunder, yet one running Northward, the other to the East. Waveney sung before, and A description of a flight at River. Ouse the lesse, whose spring Towards Ouse the greater poynts, and downe by Thetford glides, Where shee cleere Thet receives, her glory that divides, With her new-named Towne, as wondrous glad that shee, For frequency of late, so much esteemd should be: Where since these confluent Floods, so fit for Hauking lye, And store of Fowle intice skil'd Falkoners there to flye. Now of a flight at Brooke shall my description be: What subject can be found, that lies not faire to me. Of simple Shepheards now, my Muse exactly sings, And then of courtly Loves, and the affaires of Kings. Then in a Buskind straine, the warlike speare and shield, And instantly againe of the disports of Field; What can this Ile produce, that lyes from my report, Industrious Muse, proceed then to thy Hawking sport. When making for the Brooke, the Falkoner doth espie On River, Plash, or Mere, where store of Fowle doth lye: Whence forced over land, by skilfull Falconers trade: A faire convenient flight, may easily be made. He whistleth off his Hawkes, whose nimble pineons streight, Doe worke themselves by turnes, into a stately height: And if that after After Pigeons, Crowes, or such like. check, the one or both doe goe, Sometimes he them the Lure, sometimes doth water show; The trembling Fowle that heare the Jigging Hawk-bels ring, And find it is too late, to trust then to their wing, Lye flat upon the flood, whilst the high-mounted Hawks, Then being lords alone, in their etheriall walkes, Aloft so bravely stirre, their bells so thicke that shake; Which when the Falkoner sees, that scarce one When they sore as Kites doe. plane they make: The gallant'st Birds saith he, that ever flew on wing, And sweares there is a Flight, were worthy of a King. Then making to the Flood, to force the Fowles to rise, The fierce and eager Hawkes, downe thrilling from the Skies, Make sundry Crossing the ayre in their downe-come. Canceleers e'r they the Fowle can reach, Which then to save their lives, their wings doe lively stretch. But when the whizzing Bels the silent ayre doe cleave, And that their greatest speed, them vainly doe deceive; And the sharpe cruell Hawkes, they at their backs doe view, Themselves for very feare they instantly Lay the Fowles againe into the water. ineawe. The Hawkes get up againe into their former place; And ranging here and there, in that their ayery race: Still as the fearefull Fowle attempt to scape away, With many a stouping brave, them in againe they lay. But when the Falkoners take their Hawking-poles in hand, And crossing of the Brooke, doe put it over land: The Hawke gives it a souse, that makes it to rebound, Well neere the height of man, sometime above the ground; Oft takes a leg, or wing, oft takes away the head, And oft from necke to tayle, the backe in two doth shread. With many a Wo ho ho, and jocond Lure againe, When he his quarry makes upon the grassy plaine. But to my Floods againe: when as this Ouze the lesse Hath taken in cleere Thet, with farre more free accesse To Ouze the great shee goes, her Queene that commeth crown'd, As such a River fits, so many miles renown'd; And poynting to the North, her Christall front she dashes Against the swelling sands of the surrounded Washes; And Neptune in her Armes, so amply doth imbrace, As she would rob his Queene, faire Thetis of her place. Which when rich Marsh-land sees, least she should loose her state, With that faire River thus, shee gently doth debate. Disdaine me not, deare Flood, in thy excessive pride, There's scarcely any soyle that sitteth by thy side, Whose Turfe so batfull is, or beares so deepe a swath; Nor is there any Marsh in all Great Britaine, hath So many goodly seats, or that can truely show Such Rarities as I: so that all Marshes owe Much honor to my name, for that exceeding grace, Which they receive by me, so soveraigne in my place. Though Rumney, as some say, for finenesse of her grasse, And for her daintie scite, all other doth surpasse: Yet are those Seas but poore, and Rivers that confine Her greatnesse but meane Rills, be they compar'd with mine. Nor hardly doth shee tyth th'aboundant Fowle and Fish, Which Nature gives to me, as I my selfe can wish. As Amphitrite oft, calls me her sweet and faire, And sends the Northrene winds to curle my braided haire, And makes the The Washes lying betweene Marsh-land, and the Sea. Washes stand, to watch and ward me still, Lest that rough god of Sea, on me should worke his will. Old Wisbitch to my grace, my circuit sits within, And neere my banks I have the neighbourhood of Lyn. Both Townes of strength and state, my profits still that vent: No Marsh hath more of Sea, none more of continent. Thus Marsh-land ends her speech, as one that throughly knew, What was her proper praise, and what was Ouzes due. With that the zealous Muse, in her Poetique rage, To Walsingham would needs have gone a Pilgrimage, To view those farthest shores, whence little Niger flowes Into the Northrene Maine, and see the gleabe where growes That Saffron, (which men say) this land hath not the like, All Europe that excels: but here she sayle doth strike. For that Apollo pluckt her easly by the eare; And told her in that part of Norfolke, if there were Ought worthy of respect, it was not in her way, When for the greater Ouze, her wing she doth display. The one and twentieth Song. The Argument. Now from New-market comes the Muse, Whose spacious Heath, shee wistly viewes, Those Ancient Ditches and surveyes, Which our first Saxons here did raise: To Gogmagog then turnes her tale, And shewes you Ring-tailes pleasant vale. And to doe Cambridge all her Rites, The Muses to her Towne invites. And lastly, Elies praise shee sings, An end which to this Canto brings. By this our little rest, thus having gotten breath, And fairely in our way, upon Newmarket-Heath: That great and ancient The Divels Ditch. Ditch, which us expected long, Inspired by the Muse, at her arrivall song: O Time, what earthly thing with thee it selfe can trust, When thou in thine owne course, art to thy selfe unjust! Dost thou contract with death, and to oblivion give Thy glories, after them, yet shamefully dar'st live? O Time, hadst thou preserv'd, what labouring man hath done, Thou long before this day, mightst to thy selfe have wonne A Deitie with the gods, and in thy Temple plac'd, But sacriligious thou, hast all great workes defac'd; For though the things themselves have suffered by thy theft, Yet with their Ruines, thou, to ages mightst have left, Those Monuments who rear'd, and not have suffred thus Posteritie so much, t'abuse both thee and us. I, by th'East Angles first, who from this Heath arose, The long'st and largest Ditch, to check their Mercian foes; The great ditch cutting New-market Heath, beginneth at Rech, &amp; endeth at Cowlidge. Because my depth, and breadth, so strangely doth exceed, Mens low and wretched thoughts, they constantly decreed, That by the Devils helpe, I needs must raised be, Wherefore the Devils-Ditch they basely named me: When ages long before, I bare Saint Edmonds name, Because up to my side, (some have supposed) came The Liberties bequeath'd to his more sacred Shrine. Therefore my fellow Dykes, ye ancient friends of mine, That out of earth were raisd, by men whose minds were great, It is no marvaile, though Oblivion doe you threat. First, Alias, Seven mile ditch, being so much in length from the East side of the river Grant to Balsham. From Hinxston to Horsheath five miles. From Melburne to Fulmer, the shortest of the foure. Flemditch next my selfe, that art of greatest strength, That doest extend thy course full seaven large mile in length: And thou the Alias, Seven mile ditch, being so much in length from the East side of the river Grant to Balsham. From Hinxston to Horsheath five miles. From Melburne to Fulmer, the shortest of the foure. Fivemile cald, yet not lesse deare to me; With Alias, Seven mile ditch, being so much in length from the East side of the river Grant to Balsham. From Hinxston to Horsheath five miles. From Melburne to Fulmer, the shortest of the foure. Brenditch, that againe is shortest of the three, Can you suppose your selves at all to be respected, When you may see my truth's bely'd, and so neglected: Therefore deare Heath, live still in prosperous estate, And let thy wel-fleec'd Flocks, from morne to evening late, (By carefull Shepheards kept) rejoyce thee with their praise; And let the merry Larke, with her delicious layes, Give comfort to thy plaines, and let me onely lye, (Though of the world contemn'd) yet gracious in thine eye. Thus said, these ancient Dykes neglected in their ground, Through the sad aged earth, sent out a hollow sound, To gratulate her speech; when as we met againe, With one whose constant heart, with cruell love was slaine: Old Gogmagog, a Hill of long and great renowne, Which neere to Cambridge set, o'rlookes that learned Towne. Of Balshams pleasant hilles, that by the name was knowne, But with the monstrous times, he rude and barbarous growne, A Gyant was become; for man hee cared not, And so the fearefull name of Gogmagog had got: Who long had borne good will to most delicious Grant: But doubting lest some god his greatnesse might supplant. For as that daintie Flood by Cambridge keepes her course, He found the Muses left their old Beotian source, Resorting to her banks, and every little space, He saw bright Phœbus gaze upon her Christall face, And through th'exhaled Fogs, with anger looked red, To leave his loved Nymph, when he went downe to bed. Wherefore this Hill with love, being fouly overgone: And one day as he found the lovely Nymph alone, Thus wooes her; Sweeting mine, if thou mine owne wilt be, C'have many a pretty gaud, I keepe in store for thee. A nest of broad-fac'd Owles, and goodly Urchins too; Nay Nymph take heed of me, when I begin to wooe: And better yet then this, a Bulchin twa yeares old, A curld-pate Calfe it is, and oft could have beene sold: And yet beside all this, c'have goodly Beare-whelps twa, Full daintie for my Joy, when shee's dispos'd to play, And twentie Sowes of Lead, to make our wedding Ring; Bezides, at Sturbridge Fayre, chill buy thee many a thing: Chill zmouch thee every morne, before the Sunne can rise, And looke my manly face, in thy sweet glaring eyes. Thus said, he smug'd his Beard, and stroked up his hayre, As one that for her love he thought had offered fayre: Which to the Muses, Grant did presently report, Wherewith they many a yeare shall make them wondrous sport. When Ringdale in her selfe, a most delicious Dale, The Vale of Ringdale, of the vulgar falsly called Ringtaile. Who having heard too long the barbarous Mountaines tale, Thus thinketh in her selfe, Shall I be silenc'd, when Rude Hills, and Ditches, digg'd by discontented men, Are ayded by the Muse; their Mind's at large to speake: Besides my sister Vales supposing me but weake, Judge meanly of my state, when she no longer stayd, But in her owne behalfe, thus to the other said. What though betwixt two Sheeres, I be by Fortune throwne, This Vale standeth part in Hartfordshire, part in Cambridgeshire. That neither of them both can challenge me her owne, Yet am I not the lesse, nor lesse my Fame shall be: Your Figures are but base, when they are set by me; For Nature in your shapes, notoriously did erre, But skillfull was in me, cast pure Orbiculer. Nor can I be compar'd so like to any thing, By him that would expresse my shape, as to a Ring: For Nature bent to sport, and various in her trade, Of all the British Vales, of me a circle made: For in my very midst, there is a swelling ground, About which Ceres Nymphs dance many a wanton Round. The frisking Fairy there, as on the light ayre borne, Oft runne at Barley-breake upon the eares of Corne; And catching drops of dew in their lascivious chases, Doe cast the liquid pearle in one anothers faces. What they in largenesse have, that beare themselves so hie, In my most perfect forme, and delicacie, I, For greatnesse of my graine, and finenesse of my grasse; This Ile scarce hath a Vale, that Ringdale doth surpasse. When more she would have said, but suddenly there sprung, A confident report, that through the Countrey rung, That Cam her daintiest Flood, long since entituled Grant, A famous Village in the confines of Hartfordshire.Whose fountaine Ashwell crown'd, with many a upright plant, In sallying on for Ouze, determin'd by the way, To intertaine her friends the Muses with a Lay. Wherefore to shew her selfe er'e she to Cambridge came, Most worthy of that Towne to which she gives the name, Takes in her second head, from Linton comming in, By Shelford having slid, which straightway she doth win: Then which, a purer Streame, a delicater Brooke, Bright Phœbus in his course, doth scarcely overlooke. Thus furnishing her bankes; as sweetly she doth glide Towards Cambridge, with rich Meads layd forth on either side; And with the Muses oft, did by the way converse: Wherefore it her behooves, that something she reherse, The Sisters that concern'd, who whispered in her eare, Such things as onely shee, and they themselves should heare, A wondrous learned Flood; and she that had been long, (Though silent, in her selfe, yet) vexed at the wrong Done to Apollo's Priests, with heavenly fire infused, Oft by the worthlesse world, unworthily abused: With whom, in their behalfe, hap ill, or happen well, Shee meant to have a bout, even in despight of Hell, When humbly lowting low, her due obedience done, Thus like a Satyre shee, deliberatly begun. My Invective, thus quoth she, I onely ayme at you, (Of what degree soe'r) ye wretched worldly crue, In all your brainlesse talke, that still direct your drifts Against the Muses sonnes, and their most sacred gifts, That hate a Poets name, your vilenesse to advance, For ever be you damn'd in your dull ignorance. Slave, he whom thou dost thinke, so meane and poore to be, Is more then halfe divine, when he is set by thee. Nay more, I will avow, and justifie him then, He is a god, compar'd with ordinary men. His brave and noble heart, here in a heaven doth dwell, Above those worldly cares, that sinks such sots to hell: A caitife if there be more viler then thy selfe, If he through basenesse light upon this worldly pelfe, The Chimney-sweepe, or he that in the dead of night, Doth emptie lothsome vaults, may purchase all your right; When not the greatest King, should he his treasure raine, The Muses sacred gifts, can possibly obtaine; No, were he Monarch of the universall earth, Except that gift from heaven, be breath'd into his birth. How transitory be those heaps of rotting mud, Which onely to obtaine, yee make your chiefest good? Perhaps to your fond sonnes, your ill-got goods yee leave, You scarcely buried are, but they your hopes deceive. Have I not knowne a wretch, the purchase of whose ground, Was valued to be sould, at threescore thousand pound; That in a little time, in a poore threed-bare coat, Hath walk'd from place to place, to beg a silly groat? When nothing hath of yours, or your base broods been left, Except poore widdowes cries, to memorize your theft. That curse the Serpent got in Paradise for hire, Descend upon you all, from him your devillish Sire, Groveling upon the earth, to creepe upon your breast, And licke the lothsome dust, like that abhorred beast. But leave these hatefull heards, and let me now declare, In th'Helliconian Fount, who rightly christned are: Not such as basely sooth the Humour of the Time, And slubberingly patch up some slight and shallow Rime, Upon Pernassus top, that strive to be instal'd, Yet never to that place were by the Muses call'd. Nor yet our Mimick Apes, out of their bragging pride, That faine would seeme to be, what nature them denide; Whose Verses hobling runne, as with disjoynted bones, And make a viler noyse, then carts upon the stones; And these forsooth must be, the Muses onely heires, When they but Bastards are, and foundlings none of theirs, Inforcing things in Verse for Poesie unfit, Mere filthy stuffe, that breakes out of the sores of wit: What Poet reckes the praise upon such Anticks heap'd, Or envies that their lines, in Cabinets are kept? Though some fantasticke foole promove their ragged Rymes, And doe transcribe them o'r a hundred severall times, And some fond women winnes, to thinke them wondrous rare, When they lewd beggery trash, nay very gibbrish are. Give me those Lines (whose touch the skilfull eare to please) That gliding flow in state, like swelling Euphrates, In which things naturall be, and not in falsely wrong: The Sounds are fine and smooth, the Sense is full and strong, Not bumbasted with words, vaine ticklish eares to feed; But such as may content the perfect man to read. What is of Paynters said, is of true Poets rife, That he which doth expresse things neerest to the life, Doth touch the very poynt, nor needs he adde thereto: For that the utmost is, that Art doth strive to doe. Had Orpheus, whose sweet Harpe (so musically strung) Intised Trees, and Rocks, to follow him along: Th'moralitie of which, is that his knowledge drew The stony, blockish rout, that nought but rudenesse knew, T'imbrace a civill life, by his inticing Layes. Had he compos'd his lines, like many of these dayes, Which to be understood, doe take in it disdaine: Nay, Oedipus may fayle, to know what they would meane. If Orpheus had so play'd, not to be understood, Well might those men have thought the Harper had been wood; Who might have sit him downe, the trees and rockes among, And been a veryer blocke, then those to whom he sung. O noble Cambridge then, my most beloved Towne, In glory flourish still, to heighten thy renowne: The Embleme of Cambridge.In womans perfect shape, still be thy Embleme right, Whose one hand holds a Cup, the other beares a Light. Phocis bedew'd with drops, that from Pernassus fall, Let Cirrha seeke to her, nor be you least of all, Yee faire Beotian Thebes, and Thespia still to Pay My Cambridge all her Rites: Cirrhea send this way. O let the thrice-three Maids, their dewes upon thee raine, From Aganippa's fount, and hoofe-plow'd Hyppocrene. Mount Pindus, thou that art the Muses sacred place In Thessaly; and thou, O Pimpla, that in Thrace They chose for their owne hill, then thou Pernassus hye, Upon whose by-clift top, the sacred company About Apollo sit; and thou O Flood, with these Pure Hellicon, belov'd of the Pierides. With Tempe, let thy walks, and shades, be brought to her, And all your glorious gifts upon my Towne conferre. This said, the lovely Grant glides eas'ly on along, To meet the mighty Ouze, which with her watry throng, The Cantabrigian fields had entred, taking in Th'in-Iled Elies earth, which strongly she doth win From Grants soft-neighbouring grounds, when as the fruitfull Ile, Much wondring at her selfe, thought surely all this while, That by her silence shee had suffred too much wrong. Wherefore in her selfe praise, loe thus the Iland sung. Of all the Marshland Iles, I Ely am the Queene: For Winter each where sad, in me lookes fresh and greene. The Horse, or other beast, o'rway'd with his owne masse, Lies wallowing in my Fennes, hid over head in grasse: And in the place where growes ranke Fodder for my Neat; The Turffe which beares the Hay, is wondrous needfull Peat: Fuell cut out of the earth in squares, like Brickes. My full and batning earth, needs not the Plowmans paines; The Rils which runne in me, are like the branched vaines In humane Bodies seene; those Ditches cut by hand, From the surrounding Meres, to winne the measured land, To those choyce waters, I most fitly may compare, Wherewith nice women use to blanch their Beauties rare. Hath there a man beene borne in me, that never knew Of Watersey the Leame, or th'other cal'd the New. Famous Ditches, or Water-draughts in the Isle. The Frithdike neer'st my midst, and of another sort, Who ever fish'd, or fowl'd, that cannot make report Of sundry Meres at hand, upon my Westerne way, As Ramsey mere, and Ug, with the great Whittelsey: Of the aboundant store of Fish and Fowle there bred, Which whilst of Europes Iles Great Britaine is the Head, No Meres shall truely tell, in them, then at one draught, More store of either kinds hath with the Net been caught: Which though some pettie Iles doe challenge them to be Their owne, yet must those Iles likwise acknowledge me Their soveraigne. Nor yet let that Islet Ramsey shame, Although to Ramsey-Mere shee onely gives the name; Though Ely be in part of Cambridge Shire, yet are these Meres for the most part in Huntingdon Shire.Nor Huntingdon, to me though she extend her grounds, Twit me that I at all usurpe upon her Bounds. Those Meres may well be proud, that I will take them in, Which otherwise perhaps forgotten might have bin. The Towne and Church of Ely.Besides my towred Phane, and my rich Citied seat, With Villages, and Dorpes, to make me most compleat. Thus broke she off her speech, when as the Muse awhile, Desirous to repose, and rest her with the Ile, Here consumates her Song, and doth fresh courage take, With warre in the next Booke, the Muses to awake. The two and twentieth Song The Argument. The Muse, Ouze from her Fountaine brings Along by Buckingham, and sings: The Earth that turneth wood to stone, And t'holy Wells of Harlweston: Then shewes wherefore the Fates doe grant, That shee the Civill warres should chant: By Huntingdon shee Waybridge meetes, And thence the German Ocean greetes. Invention as before, thy high-pitcht pinions rouze, Exactly to set downe how the far-wandring Ouze, The Progresse of the River of Ouze to the German Sea. Through the Bedfordian fields deliciously doth strain, As holding on her course, by Huntingdon againe, How bravely shee her selfe betwixt her Bankes doth beare, E'r Ely shee in-Ile, a Goddesse honored there; From Brackley breaking forth, through soiles most heavenly sweet, By Buckingham makes on, and crossing Watling-Street, Shee with her lesser Ouze, at Newport next doth twin, Which from proud Chiltern neere, comes eas'ly ambling in. The Brooke which on her banke doth boast that earth alone: (Which noted) of this Ile, converteth wood to stone. That little Aspleyes earth we anciently instile, Mongst sundry other things, A wonder of the Ile: One of the wonders of this Iland. Of which the lesser Ouze oft boasteth in her way, As shee her selfe with Flowers doth gorgeously aray. Ouze having Ouleney past, as shee were waxed mad, After this river hath entred Bedford Shire, there is scarce any River in this Iland, that runneth with so many intricate Gyres and turnings as this Ouze. From her first stayder course immediatly doth gad; And in Meandred Gyres doth whirle herselfe about, That, this way, here, and there, backe, forward, in, and out, And like a wanton Girle, oft doubling in her gate, In Labyrinth-like turnes, and twinings intricate, Through those rich fields doth runne, till lastly in her pride, The Shires Hospitious towne, shee in her course divide, Where shee her spacious breast in glorious bredth displayes; And varying her cleere forme a thousand sundry wayes, Streakes through the verdant Meads; but farre she hath not gone, When Ivell a cleare Nymph from Shefford sallying on, Comes deftly dauncing in through many a daintie Slade, Crown'd with a goodly Bridge, arriv'd at Bickleswade, Encouraged the more her Mistris to pursue, In whose cleere face the Sunne delights himselfe to view: To mixe her selfe with Ouze, as on she thus doth make, And lovingly at last hath hapt to overtake; Shee in her Chrystall Armes her soveraigne Ouze doth cling, Which Flood in her Allie, as highly glorying, Shoots forward to Saint Neots, into those nether grounds, Towards Huntingdon, and leaves the lov'd Bedfordian bounds. Scarce is she entred yet upon this second Sheere, The holy Springs of Harlweston.Of which she soveraigne is, but that two Fountaines cleere, At Harlweston neere hand, th'one salt, the other sweet, At her first entrance, thus her greatnesse gently greet. Once were we two faire Nymphs, who fortunatly prov'd, The pleasures of the Woods, and faithfully belov'd Of two such Sylvan gods, by hap that found us here; For then their Sylvan kind most highly honoured were, When this whole Countries face was Forresty, and we Liv'd loosely in the Weilds, which now thus peopled be. Oft interchang'd we sighs, oft amorous lookes we sent, Oft whispering our deare loves, our thoughts oft did we vent Amongst the secret shades, oft in the groves did play, And in our sports our joyes, and sorrowes did bewray. Oft cunningly we met, yet coyly then imbrac't, Still languish'd in desire, yet liv'd we ever chast. And quoth the saltish Spring, as one day mine and I, Set to recount our loves, from his more tender eye The brinish teares drop'd downe, on mine impearced breast, And instantly therein so deeply were imprest, That brackish I became: he finding me depriv'd Of former freshnesse quite, the cause from him deriv'd, On me bestow'd this gift, my sweetnesse to requite, That I should ever cure the dimnesse of the sight. And, quoth the fresher Spring, the Wood-god me that woo'd, As one day by my brim, surpriz'd with love he stood, On me bestow'd this gift, that ever after I Should cure the painfull Itch, and lothsome Leprosie. Held on with this discourse, shee on not farre hath runne, But that shee is ariv'd at goodly Huntingdon; Where shee no sooner viewes her darling and delight, Proud Portholme, but became so ravish'd with the sight, A little Iland made by this River, lying neere Huntingdon. That shee her limber armes lascivously doth throw About the Islets waste, who b'ing imbraced so, Her Flowry bosome shewes to the inamored Brooke; On which when as the Ouze amazedly doth looke On her brave Damask'd breast, bedeck'd with many a flowre (That grace this goodly Mead) as though the Spring did powre Her full aboundance downe, whose various dyes so thicke, Are intermixt as they by one another sticke, That to the gazing eye that standeth farre, they show Like those made by the Sunne in the Celestiall Bow. But now t'advaunce this Flood, the Fates had brought to passe, As shee of all the rest the onely River was: That but a little while before that fatall warre, Twixt that divided Blood of Yorke and Lancaster, Neere Harleswood, above in her Bedfordian trace, Prodigious signes forerunning the wars betwixt the houses of Lancaster and Yorke in this River of Ouze. By keeping backe her streame, for neere three furlongs space, Laying her Bosome bare unto the publique view, Apparantly was prov'd by that which did ensue, In her Prophetique selfe, those troubles to foresee: Wherefore (even as her due) the Destinies agree, Shee should the glory have our civill fights to sing, When swelling in her bankes, from her aboundant Spring, Her sober silence shee now resolutely breakes, In language fitting warre, and thus to purpose speakes. With that most fatall field, I will not here begin, Where Norman William first the Conqueror, did win The day at In Sussex, neere the Sea. Hastings, where the valiant Harold slaine, Resign'd his Crowne, whose soyle the colour doth retaine, Of th'English blood there shed, as th'earth still kept the skarre: Which since not ours begot, but an invasive warre, Amongst our home-fought fields, hath no discription here: In Normandy nor that, that same day fortie yeare, That Bastard William brought a Conquest on this Ile, Twixt Robert his eld'st sonne, and Henry, who the while, His Brothers warlike tents in Palestine were pight, In England here usurp'd his eld'st borne brothers right; Which since it forraine was, not strucke within this land, Amongst our civill fights here numbred shall not stand. The Battell at Lincolne.But Lincolne Battell now we as our first will lay, Where Maud the Empresse stood to trie the doubtfull day, With Stephen, when he here had welneere three yeares raign'd, Where both of them their right couragiously maintain'd, And marshalling their Troups, the King his person put, Into his well-arm'd Maine, of strong and valiant Foot: The Wings that were his Horse, in th'one of them he plac'd Young Alan that brave Duke of Britaine, whom he grac'd With th'Earles of Norfolke, and Northampton, and with those, He Mellent in that wing, and Warren did dispose. The other no whit lesse, that this great day might sted; The Earle of Aubemerle, and valiant Ipres led. The Empresse powers again, but in two Squadrons were: The Vaward Chester had, and Gloucester the Reare; Then were there valiant Welsh, and desperate men of ours, That when supplies should want, might reinforce their powers. The Battels joyne, as when two adverse Seas are dasht Against each others waves, that all the plaines were washt With showers of sweltring blood, that downe the furrowes ran, Ere it could be discern'd which either lost or wan. Earle Baldwin, and Fitzurse those valiant Knights, were seene To charge the Empresse Horse, as though dread Mars had beene There in two sundry shapes; the day that beautious was, Twinckled as when you see the Sunne-beames in a glasse, That nimbly being stirr'd, flings up the trembling flame At once, and on the earth reflects the very same. With their resplendent swords, that glistred gainst the Sunne; The honour of the day, at length the Empresse wonne. King Stephen prisoner was, and with him many a Lord, The common Souldiers put together to the sword. The next, the Battell neere Saint Edmundsbury fought, By our The Battell at Saint Edmunds Bury. Henry the second. Fitz-Empresse force, and Flemings hither brought By th'Earle of Leister, bent to move intestine strife, For yong King Henries cause, crown'd in his fathers life; Which to his kingly Syre much care and sorrow bred, In whose defiance then that Earle his Ensignes spred, Back'd by Hugh Bigots power, the Earle of Norfolke then, By bringing to his ayd the valiant Norfolke men. Gainst Bohun, Englands great high Constable that swayd The Royall forces, joyn'd with Lucy for his ayd Chiefe Justice, and with them the German powers, to expell The Earles of Cornewall came, Gloster, and Arundell, From Bury, that with them Saint Edmonds Banner bring, Their Battels in aray; both wisely ordering The Armies chanc'd to meet upon the Marshy ground, Betwixt Saint Edmunds towne, and Fornham (fitly found) The bellowing Drummes beat up a thunder for the charge, The Trumpets rend the ayre, the Ensignes let at large, Like waving flames farre off, to either hoste appeare: The bristling Pykes doe shake, to threat their comming neere; All clouded in a mist, they hardly could them view, So shaddowed with the Shafts from either side that flew. The Wings came wheeling in, at joyning of whose forces, The either part were seene to tumble from their horses, Which emptie put to rout, are paunch'd with Gleaves and Pyles, Lest else by running loose, they might disranke their Fyles. The Bilmen come to blowes, that with the cruell thwacks, The ground lay strew'd with Male, and shreds of tatterd Jacks: The playnes like to a shop, lookt each where to behold, Where limbes of mangled men on heaps lay to be sold; Sterne discontented Warre did never yet appeare With a more threatning brow, then it that time did there. O Leicester (alas) in ill time wast thou wonne To ayd this gracelesse youth, the most ingratefull sonne Against his naturall Syre, who crown'd him in his dayes, Whose ill-requited love did him much sorrow raise, As Le'ster by this warre against King Henry show'd, Upon so bad a cause, O courage ill bestow'd; Who had thy quarrell beene, as thou thy selfe was skild In brave and martiall feats, thou evermore hadst fild This Ile with thy high deeds, done in that bloody field: But Bigot and this Lord, inforc'd at length to yeeld Them to the other part, when on that fatall plaine, Of th'English and the Dutch, ten thousand men lay slaine. As for the second Fight at Lincolne, betwixt those Who sided with the French, by seeking to depose Henry the sonne of John, then young, and to advaunce The Daulphin Lewes, sonne to Philip King of France, Which Lincolne Castle, then most straightly did besiege; And William Marshall Earle of Pembroke for his Liege, (Who led the faithfull Lords) although so many there, Or in the conflict slaine, or taken prisoners were; Yet for but a surprize, no field appointed fight, Mongst our set Battels here, may no way claime a right. The Battell of Lewes.The Field at Lewes then, by our third Henry fought, Who Edward his brave sonne unto that Conflict brought; With Richard then the King of Almaine, and his sonne Young Henry, with such Lords as to his part he wonne. With him their Soveraigne Liege, their lives that durst engage. And the rebellious league of the proud Barronage, By Symon Mounford Earle of Le'ster their chiefe Head, And th'Earle of Gloster, Clare, against King Henry led; For th'ancient Freedomes here that bound their lives to stand, The Aliens to expulse, who troubled all the land, Whilst for this dreadfull day, their great designes were meant; From Edward the young Prince, defiances were sent To Mountfords valiant sonnes, Lord Henry, Sim, and Guy, And calling unto him a Herauld, quoth he, Flie To th'Earle of Leisters Tents, and publikely proclame Defiance to his face, and to the Montfords name, And say to his proud sonnes, say boldly thus from me; That if they be the same, that they would seeme to be, Now let them in the field be by their Band-roules knowne, Where as I make no doubt, their valour shall be showne. Which if they dare to doe, and still uphold their pride, There will we vent our spleenes, where swords shall it decide. To whom they thus replide, Tell that brave man of Hope, He shall the Mountfords find in t'head of all their Troupe, To answere his proud braves; our Bilbowes be as good As his, our Armes as strong; and he shall find our blood Sold at as deare a rate as his; and if we fall, Tell him weele hold so fast, his Crowne shall goe withall. The King into three fights his forces doth divide, Of which his princely Prince Edward after called Edward the first. sonne the Vaward had to guide: The second to the King of Almaine, and his sonne, Young Henry he betooke, in the third Legion Of Knights, and Men of Armes, in person he appeares. Into foure severall Fights, the desperate Barons theirs. I'th first those valiant youths, the sonnes of Leister came, Of leading of the which, Lord Henry had the name: The Earle of Gloster brought the second Battell on, And with him were the Lords Mountchency, and Fitz-John: The third wherein alone the Londoners were plac'd, The stout Lord Segrave led, the greatest, and the last, Brave Leicester himselfe, with courage undertooke. The day upon the host affrightedly doth looke, To see the dreadfull shocke, their first encounter gave, As though it with the rore, the Thunder would out-brave. Prince Edward all in gold, as he great Jove had beene: The Mountfords all in Plumes, like Estriges were seene, To beard him to his teeth, toth' worke of death they goe; The crouds like to a Sea seemd waving to and fro. Friend falling by his friend, together they expire: He breath'd, doth charge afresh; he wounded, doth retyre. The Mountfords with the Prince vye valour all the day, Which should for Knightly deeds excell, or he, or they, To them about his head, his glistring blade he throwes, They waft him with their swords, as long with equall showes: Now Henry, Simon then, and then the youngest Guy, Kept by his brothers backe, thus stoutly doth reply, What though I be but young, let death me overwhelme, But I will breake my sword upon his plumed helme. The younger Bohun there, to high atchivements bent, With whom two other Lords, Lucy, and Hastings went, Which charging but too home, all sorely wounded were, Whom living from the field, the Barons strove to beare, Being on their partie fixd; whilst still Prince Edward spurres, To bring his Forces up to charge the Londoners, T'whom cruell hate he bare, and joyning with their Force, Of heavy-armed Foot, with his light Northerne Horse, He putting them to flight, foure miles in chase them slew: But ere he could returne, the conquest wholly drew To the stout Barons side: his father fled the field, Into the Abbay there, constrained thence to yeeld. The Lords Fitz-warren slaine, and Wilton that was then Chiefe Justice (as some say) with them five thousand men; And Bohun that great Earle of Her'ford overthrowne, With Bardolfe, Somery, Patshull, and Percie knowne, By their Coat-armours then, for Barons, prisoners ta'n; Though Henry ware the Crowne, great Le'ster yet did raigne. Now for the Conflict next, at Chesterfield that chanc'd Gainst Robert that proud Earle of Darby, who advanc'd His Ensignes gainst the King, (contrary to his oath) Upon the Barons part, with the Lord Devell, both Surpriz'd by Henry Prince of Almain with his power, By comming at so strange an unexpected hower: And taking them unarmd; since meerely a defeat, With our well-ordered fights, we will not here repeat. The Battell at Evsham.The fatall Battell then at fertile Evsham struck, Though with the selfe same hands, not with the selfe same luck: For both the King and Prince at Lewes prisoners taken, By fortune were not yet so utterly forsaken; But that the Prince was got from Le'ster, and doth gather His friends, by force of Armes yet to redeeme his father; And th'Earle of Glo'ster wonne, who through the Mountfords pride Disgrac'd, came with his power to the Emperiall side. When now those Lords, which late at Lewes wonne the day, The Sacrament receiv'd, their Armes not downe to lay, Untill the King should yeeld th'old Charter to maintaine. King Henry and his sonne Prince Edward swore againe, They would repeale those Lawes that were at Oxford made, Or through this bloody warre to their destruction wade. But since the King remain'd in puissant Lei'sters power, The remnant of his friends, whom death did not devoure At Lewes Battell late, and durst his part partake. The Prince excites againe, an Armie up to make, Whom Roger Bigot, Earle of Norfolke doth assist, Englands high Marshall then, and that great Martialist, Old Henry Bohun, Earle of Her'ford, in this warre, Gray, Basset, and Saint-John, Lisle, Percie, Latimer, All Barons, which to him their utmost strengths doe lay, With many a Knight for power their equall every way; And William Valence, Earle of Pembroke, who had fled From Lewes field, to France, thence with fresh succour sped. Young Humphrey Bohun still, doth with great Le'ster goe, Who for his Countries cause becomes his fathers foe. Fitz-John, Gray, Spencer, Strange, Rosse, Segrave, Vessey, Gifford, Wake, Lucy, Vipount, Vaux, Clare, Marmion, Hastings, Clifford. In that blacke night before his sad and dismall day, Were apparitions strange, as drad Heaven would bewray The horrors to ensue, O most amazing sight! Two Armies in the Ayre, discerned were to fight, Which came so neere to earth, that in the morne they found The prints of horses feet remaining on the ground, Which came but as a show, the time to entertaine, Till th'angry Armies joyn'd, to act the bloody Sceane. Shrill shouts, and deadly cries, each way the ayre do fill, And not a word was heard from either side, but kill: The father gainst the sonne, the brother gainst the brother, With Gleaves, Swords, Bills, and Pykes, were murthering one another. The full luxurious earth, seemes surfitted with blood, Whilst in his Unckles gore th'unnaturall Nephew stood; Whilst with their charged Staves, the desperate horsmen meet, They heare their kinsmen groane under their Horses feet. Dead men, and weapons broke, doe on the earth abound; The Drummes bedash'd with braines, doe give a dismall sound. Great Le'ster there expir'd, with Henry his brave sonne, When many a high exployt they in that day had done. Scarce was there noble House, of which those times could tell, But that some one thereof, on this, or that side fell; Amongst the slaughtered men, that there lay heap'd on pyles: Bohuns, and Beauchamps were, Basets, and Mandeviles: Segraves, and Saint-Johns seeke, upon the end of all, To give those of their names their Christian buriall. Ten thousand on both sides were ta'n and slaine that day: Prince Edward gets the gole, and beares the Palme away. All Edward Long-shankes time, her civill warres did cease, The Conflicts at Burton and Burrough Bridge in the second Barons warres Who strove his Countries bounds by Conquest to increase. But in th'insuing raigne of his most riotous sonne, As in his fathers dayes, a second warre begun; When as the stubborne heires of the stout Barons dead, Who for their Countries cause, their blood at Evsham shed, Not able to endure the Spencers hatefull pride, The father and the sonne, whose counsels then did guide Th'inconsiderate King, conferring all his graces, On them who got all gifts, and bought and sold all places, Them raising, to debase the Baronage the more For Gavaston, whom they had put to death before. Which urg'd too farre, at length to open Armes they brake, And for a speedy warre, they up their powers doe make. Upon King Edwards part, for this great Action bent, His brother Edmund came, the valiant Earle of Kent, With Richmount, Arundell, and Pembroke, who engage, Their powers, (three powerfull Earles) against the Baronage. And on the Barons side, great master of the warre, Was Thomas (of the Blood) the Earle of Lancaster, With Henry Bohun, Earle of Hereford, his Peere, With whom (of great command and Martialists) there were Lyle, Darcy, Denvile, Teis, Beach, Bradburne, Bernvile, Knovile, With Badlesmer, and Bercks, Fitz-william, Leyburne, Lovell, Tuchet, and Talbot stout, doe for the Barons stand, Maudute, and Mowbray, with great Clifford that command Their Tenants to take Armes, that with their Landlords runne; With these went also Hugh, and Henry Willington; Redoubted Damory, as Audley, Elmesbridge, Wither, Earles, Barons, Knights, Esquiers, embodied all together, At Burton upon Trent who having gathered head, Towards them with all his power the King in person sped; Who at his neere approach (upon his March) discri'd, That they against his power the Bridge had fortifi'd: Which he by strong assault, assayes from them to win, Where as a bloody fight doth instantly begin, When he to beat them off, assayes them first by shot; And they to make that good, which they before had got, Defend them with the like, like Haylestones from the skie, From Crosse-bowes, and the Long, the light-wingd arrowes flie: But friended with the Flood, the Barons hold their strength, Forcing the King by Boats, and pyles of wood at length, T'attempt to land his force upon the other side. The Barons, that the more his stratagems defide, Withstand them in the streame, when as the troubled flood, (With in a little time) was turned all to blood; And from the Boats and Bridge, the mangled bodies feld, The poore affrighted Fish, their watry walks expeld. While at the Bridge the fight still strongly doth abide, The King had learnt to know, that by a skilfull guide, He by a Fourd not farre might passe his power of Horse, Which quickly he performes, which drave the Barons force From the defended Bridge, t'affront th'approching foe, Imbattelling themselves, when to the shocke they goe, (On both sides so assaild) till th'water, and the shore Of one complexion were, distaind with equall gore. Oft forc'd to change their fights, being driven from their ground, That when by their much losse, too weake themselves they found, Th'afflicted Barons flie, yet still together keepe. The King his good successe, not suffring so to sleepe, Pursues them with his power, which Northward still doe beare; And seldome scapes a day, but he doth charge their Reare: Till come to Burrough Bridge, where they too soone were staid By Andrew Herckley, Earle of Carleill, with fresh ayd Being lately thither come, King Edwards part to take. The Barons range their fights, still good their ground to make; But with long Marches tyerd, their wearied breath they draw, After the desperat'st fight the Sunne yet ever saw, Brave Bohun there was slaine, and Lancaster forsaken Of Fortune, is surpriz'd; the Barons prisoners taken. For those Rebellions, Stirres, Commotions, Uprores, here In Richard Burdeaux raigne, that long so usuall were; Richard the second, borne at Burdeux. As that the first by Straw, and Tyler, with their Rout Of Rebels brought from Kent, most insolent and stout, By entring London, thought the Iland to subdue: Jack Straw, kild by the Maior of London with his dagger.The first of which, the Maior of London bravely slew; Walworth, which wonne his name much honour by the deed: As they of Suffolke next, those Rascals that succeed, By John Litstar, a Dyer of Norwich. Litster led about, their Captaine who enstil'd Himselfe the Commons King, in hope to have exil'd The Gentry from those parts, by those that were his owne, By that brave Bishop (then) of Norwitch overthrowne. Henry Spencer, the warlike Bishop of Norwich. By such unruly Slaves, and that in Essex rais'd By Thomas that stout Duke of Glo'ster, strongly At Hatfield. ceaz'd, As that at Radcot bridge, where the last named Peere, With foure brave Warwicke, Darby, Arundell, &amp; Nottingham. Earles his friends, encountred Robert Vere Then Duke of Ireland cald, by Richard so created, And gainst those Lords maintain'd, whom they most deadly hated; Since they but Garboyles were, in a deformed masse, Not ordered fitting warre, we lightly overpasse. I chuse the Battell next of Shrewsbury to chant, The Battell of Shrewsbury. Betwixt Henry the fourth, the sonne of John of Gant, And the stout Percies, Henry Hotspurre and his Eame The Earle of Wor'ster, who the rightfull Diademe Had from King Richard reft, and heav'd up to his Seat This Henry, whom (too soone) they found to be too great, Him seeking to depose, and to the Rule preferre Richards proclaimed Heire, their cosen Mortimer, Whom Owen Glendour then in Wales a prisoner staid, Whom to their part they wonne, and thus their plot they laid, That Glendour should have Wales, along as Severne went, The Percies all the North, that lay beyond the Trent; And Mortimer from thence the South to be his share; Which Henry having heard, doth for the warre prepare, And down to Cheshire makes, (where gathering powers they were) At Shrewsbury to meet, and doth affront them there: With him his peerelesse sonne, the princely Henry came, With th'Earle of Stafford, and of Gentlemen of name, Blunt, Shyrley, Clifton, men that very powerfull were, With Cockayne, Calverly, Massy, and Mortimer, Gausell, and Wendsley, all in Friends and Tenants strong, Resorting to the King still as he past along; Which in the open field before the ranged fights, He with his warlike Sonne, there dub'd his Mayden Knights. Th'Earle Dowglasse for this day doth with the Percies stand, To whom they Berwicke gave, and in Northumberland Some Seigniories and Holds, if they the Battell got, Who brought with him to Field full many an angry Scot, At Holmdon Battell late that being overthrowne, Now on the King and Prince hop'd to regaine their owne; With almost all the power of Cheshire got together, By Venables, (there great) and Vernon mustred thether. The Vaward of the King, great Stafford tooke to guide. The Vaward of the Lords upon the other side, Consisted most of Scots, which joyning, made such spoyle, As at the first constrain'd the English to recoyle, The high courage of Dowglasse wan him that addition of Doughty Dowglasse, which after grew to a Proverbe.And almost brake their Rankes, which when King Henry found, Bringing his Battell up, to reinforce the ground, The Percies bring up theirs, againe to make it good. Thus whilst the either Host in opposition stood, Brave Dowglasse with his spurres, his furious Courser strake, His Lance set in his rest, when desperatly he brake In, where his eye beheld th'Emperiall Ensigne pight, Where soone it was his chance, upon the King to light, Which in his full carreere he from his Courser threw; The next Sir Walter Blunt, he with three other slew, All armed like the King, which he dead sure accounted; But after when hee saw the King himselfe remounted: This hand of mine, quoth he, foure Kings this day hath slaine, And swore out of the earth he thought they sprang againe, Or Fate did him defend, at whom he onely aym'd. When Henry Hotspurre, so with his high deeds inflam'd, Doth second him againe, and through such dangers presse, That Dowglasse valiant deeds he made to seeme the lesse, As still the people cryed, A Percy Espirance. The King which saw then time, or never to advance His Battell in the Field, which neere from him was wonne, Ayded by that brave Prince, his most couragious sonne, Who bravely comming on, in hope to give them chase, It chanc'd he with a shaft was wounded in the face; Whom when out of the fight, his friends would beare away, He strongly it refus'd, and thus was heard to say, Time never shall report, Prince Henry left the field, When Harry Percy staid, his traytrous sword to weeld. Now rage and equall wounds, alike inflame their bloods, And the maine Battels joyne, as doe two adverse floods Met in some narrow Arme, shouldring as they would shove Each other from their path, or would their bankes remove. The King his traytrous foes, before him downe doth hew, And with his hands that day, neere fortie persons slue: When conquest wholly turnes to his victorious side, His power surrounding all, like to a furious tyde; That Henry Hotspurre dead upon the cold earth lyes, Stout Wor'ster taken was, and doughtie Douglasse flyes. Five thousand from both parts left dead upon the ground, Mongst whom the kings fast friend, great Staffords coarse was found; And all the Knights there dub'd the morning but before, The evenings Sunne beheld there sweltred in their gore. Here I at Bramham More, the Battell in should bring, Of which Earle Percie had the greatest managing, With the Lord Bardolfe there, against the Counties power, Fast cleaving to his friend, even to his utmost houre: In Flanders, France, and Wales, who having been abroad To raise them present powers, intending for a Road On England, for the hate he to King Henry bore; His sonne and brothers blood augmenting it the more, Which in his mightie spirit still rooted did remaine, By his too much default, whom he imputed slaine At Shrewsbury before, to whom if he had brought Supplies, (that bloody field, when they so bravely fought) They surely it had wonne; for which to make amends, Being furnished with men, amongst his forraine friends, By Scotland entred here, and with a violent hand Upon those Castles ceaz'd within Northumberland His Earledome, (which the King, who much his truth did doubt, Had taken to himselfe, and put his people out) Toward Yorkshire comming on, where (soone repaid his owne) At Bramhams fatall More, was fowly overthrowne: Which though it were indeed a long and mortall fight, Where many men were maim'd, and many slaine outright: Where that couragious Earle, all hopes there seeing past, Amongst his murthered troups (even) fought it to the last: Yet for it was atchiev'd by multitudes of men, Which with Ralfe Roksby rose, the Shreefe of Yorkshire then, No well proportion'd fight, we of description quit, Amongst our famous fields; nor will we here admit That of that Rakehel Cades, and his rebellious crue, In Kent and Sussex raisd, at Senok fight that slue The Staffords with their power, that thither him pursu'd, Who twice upon Black heath, back'd with the Commons rude, Incamp'd against the King: then goodly London tooke, There ransoming some rich, and up the prisons broke, His sensuall beastly will, for Law that did preferre, Beheaded the Lord Say, then Englands Treasurer, And forc'd the King to flight, his person to secure, The Muse admits not here, a rabble so impure. The first Battell of Saint Albans.But brings that Battell on of that long dreadfull warre, Of those two Houses nam'd of Yorke and Lancaster, In faire Saint Albans fought, most fatally betwixt Richard then Duke of Yorke, and Henry cald the sixt, Henry the fourth.For that ill-gotten Crowne, which him his Grandsire left, That likewise with his life, he from King Richard reft, When underhand the Duke doth but promove his claime, Who from the elder sonne, the Duke of Clarence came, For which he raised Armes, yet seem'd but to abet The people, to plucke downe the Earle of Somerset, By whom (as they gave out) we Normandy had lost, And yet he was the man that onely rul'd the roast. With Richard Duke of Yorke, (into his faction wonne) Salsbury and Warwicke came, the father and the sonne; The Nevils nobler name, that have renown'd so farre. So likewise with the King in this great action are, The Dukes of Somerset, and Buckingham, with these Were thrice so many Earles, their stout accomplices, As Pembroke great in power, and Stafford with them stand With Devonshire, Dorset, Wilt, and fierce Northumberland, With Sidley, Bernes, and Rosse, three Barons with the rest, When Richard Duke of Yorke, then marching from the west; Towards whom, whilst with his power King Henry forward set, Unluckily as't hapt, they at Saint Albans met; Where taking up the Street, the buildings them enclose, Where Front doth answer Front, &amp; strength doth strength oppose; Whilst like two mightie walls, they each to other stand, And as one sinketh downe under his enemies hand, Another thrusting in, his place doth still supply, Betwixt them whilst on heaps the mangled bodies lie: The Staules are overthrowne with the unweldy thrust, The windowes with the shot, are shivered all to dust. The Winters Sleet or Hayle was never seene so thicke, As on the houses sides the bearded arrowes sticke, Where Warwicks courage first most Comet-like appeard, Who with words full of Spirit, his fighting Souldiers cheerd; And ever as he saw the slaughter of his men, He with fresh forces fil'd the places up agen. The valiant Men brought out of the Marches of Wales. Marchmen thus the battell still maintaine, That when King Henry found on heaps his Souldiers slaine, His great Commanders cals, who when they sadly saw, The honour of the day would to the Yorkists draw, Their persons they put in, as for the last to stand; The Duke of Somerset, Henry Northumberland, Of those brave warlike Earles, the second of that name, The Earle of Stafford, sonne to th'Duke of Buckingham, And John Lord Clifford then, which shed their noble gore Under the Castles signe, (of which not long before, A Prophet bad the Duke of Somerset beware) With many a valiant Knight, in death that had his share: So much great English blood, for others lawlesse guilt, Upon so little ground before was never spilt. Proud Yorke hath got the gole, the King of all forsaken, Into a cottage got, a wofull prisoner taken. The Battell of Blore heath.The Battell of Blore-heath, the place doth next supply, Twixt Richard Nevill, that great Earle of Salisbury, Who with the Duke of Yorke, had at Saint Albans late, That glorious Battell got with uncontrouled Fate: And James Lord Audley stir'd by that revengefull Queene, To stop him on his way, for the inveterate spleene Shee bare him, for that still he with the Yorkists held, Who comming from the North, (by sundry wrongs compeld To parley with the King) the Queene that time who lay In Staffordshire, and thought to stop him on his way, That valiant Tuchet stir'd, in Cheshire powerfull then, T'affront him in the field, where Cheshire Gentlemen Divided were, th'one part made valiant Tuchet strong, The other with the Earle rose as he came along, In camping both their powers, divided by a Brooke, Whereby the prudent Earle, this strong advantage tooke: For putting in the field his Army in aray, Then making as (with speed) he meant to march away, He caus'd a flight of Shafts to be discharged first. The enemy who thought that he had done his worst, And cowardly had fled in a disordred Rout, Attempt to wade the Brooke, he wheeling (soone) about, Set fiercely on that part, which then were passed over; Their Friends then in the Reare, not able to recover The other rising banke, to lend the Vaward ayd. The Earle who found the plot take right that he had layd, On those that forward prest, as those that did recoyle, As hungry in revenge, there made a ravenous spoyle: There Dutton, Dutton kils; A Done doth kill a Done; A Booth, a Booth; and Leigh by Leigh is overthrowne; A Venables, against a Venables doth stand; And Troutbeck fighteth with a Troutbeck hand to hand; There Molineux doth make a Molineux to die, And Egerton, the strength of Egerton doth trie. O Cheshire wert thou mad, of thine owne native gore So much untill this day thou never shedst before! Above two thousand men upon the earth were throwne, Of which the greatest part were naturally thine owne. The stout Lord Audley slaine, with many a Captaine there; To Salsbury it sorts the Palme away to beare. Then faire Northampton next, thy Battell place shall take, The Battell of Northampton. Which of th'Emperiall warre, the third fought Field doth make, Twixt Henry cald our sixt, upon whose partie came His neere and deare Allies, the Dukes of Buckingham, And Somerset, the Earle of Shrewsbury of account, Stout Vicount Beaumount, and the yong Lord Egremount, Gainst Edward Earle of March, sonne to the Duke of Yorke, With Warwicke, in that warre, who set them all at worke, And Falkonbridge with him, not much unlike the other; A Nevill nobly borne, his puisant fathers brother, Who to the Yorkists claime, had evermore been true, And valiant Bourcher, Earle of Essex, and of Eau. The King from out the towne, who drew his Foot and Horse, As willingly to give full field-roomth to his Force, Doth passe the River Nen, neere where it downe doth runne From his first fountaines head, is neere to Harsington, Advised of a place, by Nature strongly wrought, Doth there encampe his power: the Earle of March who sought To proove by dint of sword, who should obtaine the day, From Tawcester traynd on his powers in good aray. The Vaward Warwicke led, (whom no attempt could feare; The Middle March himselfe, and Falkonbridge the Reare. Now July entred was, and ere the restlesse Sunne, Three houres ascent had got, the dreadfull fight begun By Warwicke, who a straight from Vicount Beaumont tooke, Defeating him at first, by which hee quickly brooke In, on th'Emperiall host, which with a furious charge, He forc'd upon the field, it selfe more to enlarge. Now English Bowes, and Bills, and Battle-axes walke, Death up and downe the field in gastly sort doth stalke. March in the flower of Youth, like Mars himselfe doth beare; But Warwicke as the man, whom Fortune seem'd to feare, Did for him what he would, that wheresoere he goes, Downe like a furious storme, before him all he throwes: So Shrewsbury againe of Talbots valiant straine, (That fatall Scourge of France) as stoutly doth maintaine, The party of the King, so princely Somerset, Whom th'others knightly deeds, more eagerly doth whet, Beares up with them againe: by Somerset opposd At last King Henries host being on three parts enclosd, And ayds still comming in upon the Yorkists side, The Summer being then at height of all her pride, The Husbandman, then hard upon his Harvest was: But yet the cocks of Hay, nor swaths of new-shorne grasse, Strew'd not the Meads so thick, as mangled bodies there, When nothing could be seene, but horror every where: So that upon the bancks, and in the streame of The River running by Northampton. Nen, Ten thousand well resolv'd, stout, native English men Left breathlesse, with the rest great Buckingham is slaine, And Shrewsbury whose losse those times did much complaine, Egremont, and Beaumont, both found dead upon the Field, The miserable King, inforc'd againe to yeeld. The Battell of Wakefield.Then Wakefield Battell next, we in our Bedroule bring, Fought by Prince Edward, sonne to that oft-conquered King, And Richard Duke of Yorke, still strugling for the Crowne, Whom Salsbury assists, the man with whose renowne, The mouth of Fame seem'd fild, there having with them then Some few selected Welsh, and Southerne Gentlemen: A handfull to those powers, with which Prince Edward came; Of which amongst the rest, the men of noblest name, Were those two great-borne Dukes, which still his right preferre His cosen Somerset, and princely Excester, The Earle of Wiltshire still, that on his part stucke close: With those two valiant Peeres, Lord Clifford, and Lord Rosse, Who made their March from Yorke to Wakefield, on their way To meet the Duke, who then at Sandall Castle lay, Whom at his (very) gate, into the Field they dar'd, Whose long expected powers not fully then prepar'd, That March his valiant sonne, should to his succours bring. Wherefore that puissant Lord, by speedy mustering His Tenants and such friends, as he that time could get, Five thousand in five dayes, in his Battalion set Gainst their twice doubled strength; nor could the Duke be stayd, Till he might from the South be seconded with ayd; As in his martiall pride, disdaining his poore foes, So often us'd to winne, he never thought to lose. The Prince, which still provok'd th'incensed Duke to fight, His maine Battalion rang'd in Sandals loftie sight, In which he, and the Dukes, were seene in all their pride: And as Yorkes powers should passe, he had on either side Two wings in ambush laid, which at the place assign'd His Rereward should inclose, which as a thing divin'd, Just caught as he forecast; for scarce his armie comes From the descending banks, and that his ratling Drummes Excites his men to charge; but Wiltshire with his force, Which were of light-arm'd Foot, and Rosse with his light Horse, Came in upon their backes, as from a mountaine throwne, In number to the Dukes, by being foure to one. Even as a Rout of wolves, when they by chance have caught A Beast out of the Heard, which long time they have sought; Upon him all at once couragiously doe set, Him by the Dewlaps some, some by the flanke doe get: Some climbing to his eares, doe never leave their hold, Till falling on the ground, they have him as they would, With many of his kind, which, when he us'd to wend, What with their hornes &amp; hoofes, could then themselves defend. Thus on their foes they fell, and downe the Yorkists fall; Red Slaughter in her armes encompasseth them all. The first of all the fights in this unnaturall warre, In which blind Fortune smild on wofull Lancaster. Heere Richard Duke of Yorke, downe beaten, breath'd his last, And Salsbury so long with conquest still that past, Inforced was to yeeld; Rutland a younger sonne To the deceased Duke, as he away would runne, (A child scarse twelve yeares old) by Clifford there surpriz'd, Who whilst he thought with teares his rage to have suffiz'd, By him was answered thus, Thy father hath slaine mine, And for his blood (young Boy) Ile have this blood of thine, And stab'd him to the heart: thus the Lancastrians raigne, The Yorkist in the field on heaps together slaine. The Battell at that Crosse, which to this day doth beare The Battell at Mortimers Crosse. The great and ancient name of th'English Mortimer, The next shall heare have place, betwixt that Edward fought, Entitled Earle of March, (revengefully that sought To wreake his fathers blood, at Wakefield lately shed But then he Duke of Yorke, his father being dead) And Jasper Tudor Earle of Pembroke, in this warre, That stood to underprop the House of Lancaster, Halfe brother to the King, that strove to hold his Crowne, With Wiltshire, whose high prowesse had bravely beaten downe The Yorkists swelling pride in that successefull warre At Wakefield, whose greatst power of Welsh and Irish are. The Dukes were Marchers most, which still stucke to him close, And meeting on the plaine, by that forenamed Crosse; As either Generall there for his advantage found, (For wisely they surveyd the fashion of the ground) They into one maine fight their either Forces make, When to the Duke of Yorke (his spirits as to awake) Three sonnes at once appear'd, all severally that shone, Which in a little space were joyned all in one. Auspicious to the Duke, as after it fell out, Who with the weaker power, (of which he seem'd to doubt) The proud Lancastrian part had quickly put to chase, Where plainly it should seeme, the Genius of the place, The very name of March should greatly favour there, A Title to this Prince deriv'd from Mortimer: To whom this Trophy rear'd, much honored had the soyle. The Yorkists here enrich'd with the Lancastrian spoyle, Are Masters of the day; foure thousand being slaine, The most of which were those, there standing to maintaine The title of the King. Where Owen Tudors lot Was to be taken then; who this young Earle begot On Katherin the bright Queene, the fift King Henries Bride, Who too untimely dead, this Owen had affide. But he a Prisoner then, his sonne and Ormond fled, At Hereford was made the shorter by the head; When this most warlike Duke, in honour of that signe, Which of his good successe so rightly did divine, And thankfull to high heaven, which of his cause had care, Three Sunnes for his device still in his Ensigne bare. The second Battell of Saint Albans.Thy second Battell now, Saint Albans I record, Struck twixt Queene Margrets power, to ransome backe her Lord, Ta'n prisoner at that towne, when there those factions fought, Whom now the part of Yorke had thither with them brought, Whose force consisted most of Southerne men, being led By Thomas Howard Duke of Norfolke, and the head Of that proud faction then, stout Warwicke still that swayd, In every bloody field (the Yorkists onely ayd) When eithers power approch'd, and they themselves had fixt, Upon the South and North, the towne them both betwixt, Which first of all to take, the Yorkists had forecast, Putting their Vaward on, and their best Archers plac'd The Market-sted about, and them so fitly layd, That when the foe came up, they with such terror playd Upon them in the Front, as forc'd them to retreit. The Northerne mad with rage upon the first defeat, Yet put for it againe, to enter from the North, Which when great Warwicke heard, he sent his Vaward forth, T'oppose them in what place so ere they made their stand, Where in too fit a ground, a Heath too neere at hand, Adjoyning to the towne, unluckily they light, Where presently began a fierce and deadly fight. But those of Warwicks part, which scarce foure thousand were, To th'Vaward of the Queenes, that stood so stoutly there, Though still with fresh supplies from her maine Battell fed; When they their courage saw so little them to sted, Deluded by the long expectance of their ayd, By passages too straight, and close ambushments stayd: Their succours that forslow'd, to flight themselves betake, When after them againe, such speed the Northerne make, Being followed with the force of their maine Battell strong, That this disordred Rout, these breathlesse men among, They entred Warwicks Hoste, which with such horrour strooke The Southerne, that each man began about to looke A way how to escape, that when great Norfolke cri'd, Now as you favour Yorke, and his just cause, abide. And Warwicke in the Front even offred to have stood, Yet neither of them both, should they have spent their blood, Could make a man to stay, or looke upon a foe: Where Fortune it should seeme, to Warwicke meant to show, That shee this tide of his could turne, when ere she would. Thus when they saw the day was for so little sould; The King, which (for their ends) they to the field had brought, Behind them there they leave, but as a thing of naught, Which serv'd them to no use: who when his Queene and sonne, There found in Norfolkes tent, the Battell being done, With many a joyfull teare, each other they imbrace; And whilst blind Fortune look'd with so well pleas'd a face: Their swords with the warme blood of Yorkists so inbrude, Their foes but lately fled, couragiously pursude. The Battell of Towton.Now followeth that blacke Sceane, borne up so wondrous hie, That but a poore dumbe shew before a Tragedie, The former Battels fought, have seem'd to this to be; O Towton, let the blood Palme-Sunday spent on thee, Affright the future times, when they the Muse shall heare, Deliver it so to them; and let the ashes there Of fortie thousand men, in that long quarrell slaine, Arise out of the earth, as they would live againe, To tell the manlike deeds, that bloody day were wrought In that most fatall field, (with various fortunes fought) Twixt Edward Duke of Yorke, then late proclaimed King, Fourth of that royall name, and him accompanying, The Nevills, (of that warre maintaining still the streame) Great Warwicke, and with him his most couragious Eame, Stout Falconbridge, the third, a firebrand like the other, Of Salisbury surnam'd, that Warwicks bastard brother. Lord Fitzwater, who still the Yorkists power assists, Blount, Wenlock, Dinham, Knights approved Martialists. And Henry the late King, to whom they still durst stand, His true as powerfull friend, the great Northumberland, With Westmerland, his claime who ever did preferre His kinsman Somerset, his cosen Excester, Dukes of the Royall line, his faithfull friends that were, And little lesse then those, the Earle of Devonshire, Th'Lord Dacres, and Lord Wels, both wise and warlike wights, With him of great command, Nevill and Trolop, Knights. Both armies then on foot, and on their way set forth, King Edward from the South, King Henry from the North. The later crowned King doth preparation make, From Pomfret (where he lay) the passage first to take O'r Aier at Ferybridge, and for that service sends A most selected troupe of his well-chosen friends, To make that passage good, when instantly began The dire and ominous signes, the slaughter that foreran. For valiant Clifford there, himselfe so bravely quit, That comming to the Bridge (ere they could strengthen it) From the Lancastrian power, with his light troupe of Horse, And early in the morne defeating of their force, The Lord Fitzwater slew, and that brave Bastard sonne Of Salsbury, themselves who into danger runne: For being in their beds, suspecting nought at all; But hearing sudden noyse, suppos'd some broyle to fall Mongst their misgovern'd troups, unarmed rushing out, By Cliffords Souldiers soone incompassed about, Were miserably slaine: which when great Warwicke heares, As he had felt his heart transpersed through his eares, To Edward mad with rage, imediatly he goes, And with distracted eyes, in most sterne manner showes The slaughter of those Lords; this day alone, quoth he, Our utter ruine shall, or our sure rising be. When soone before the Host, his glittering sword he drew, And with relentlesse hands his sprightly Courser slew. Then stand to me (quoth he) who meaneth not to flie; This day shall Edward winne, or here shall Warwicke die. Which words by Warwicke spoke, so deeply seem'd to sting The much distempered breast of that couragious King, That straight he made proclaim'd, that every fainting heart, From his resolved host had licence to depart: And those that would abide the hazard of the fight, Rewards and titles due to their deserved right: And that no man, that day, a prisoner there should take; For this the upshot was, that all must marre or make. A hundred thousand men in both the Armies stood, That native English were: O worthy of your Blood What conquest had there been? But Ensignes flie at large, And trumpets every way sound to the dreadfull charge. Upon the Yorkists part, there flew the irefull Beare: On the Lancastrian side, the Cressant waving there. The Southerne on this side, for Yorke a Warwicke crie, A Percy for the right, the Northerne men reply. The two maine Battels joyne, the foure large Wings doe meet; What with the shouts of men, and noyse of horses feet, Hell through the troubled earth, her horrour seem'd to breath; A thunder heard above, an earth-quake felt beneath: As when the Evening is with darknesse overspread, Her Star-befreckled face with Clouds invelloped, You oftentimes behold, the trembling lightning flie, Which suddenly againe, but turning of your eye, Is vanished away, or doth so swiftly glide, That with a trice it touch t'Horizons either side; So through the smoke of dust, from wayes, and fallowes raisd, And breath of horse and men, that both together ceasd The ayre one every part, sent by the glimmering Sunne, The splendor of their Armes doth by reflection runne: Till heapes of dying men, and those already dead, Much hindred them would charge, and letted them that fled. Beyond all wonted bounds, their rage so farre extends, That sullen night begins, before their fury ends. Ten howers this fight endur'd, whilst still with murthering hand Expecting the next morne, the weak'st unconquered stands; Which was no sooner come, but doth begin againe To wrecke their friends deare blood, the former evening slaine. New Battels are begun, new fights that newly wound, Till the Lancastrian part, by their much lesning found Their long expected hopes were utterly forlorne, When lastly to the foe, their recreant backs they turne. Thy Channell then, O A little Rivilet neere to Towton, running into Wharfe. Cock, was fild up with the dead, Of the Lancastrian side, that from the Yorkists fled, That those of Edwards part, that had the Reare in chase, As though upon a Bridge, did on their bodies passe. That Wharfe to whose large banks thou contribut'st thy store, Had her more Christall face discoloured with the gore Of fortie thousand men, that up the number made, Northumberland the great, and Westmerland there layd Their bodies: valiant Wels, and Dacres there doe leave Their carkases, (whose hope too long) did them deceive. Trolop and Nevill found massacred in the field, The Earle of Wiltshire forc'd to the sterne foe to yeeld. King Henry from fayre Yorke, upon this sad mischance To Scotland fled, the Queene sayld over into France, The Duke of Somerset, and Excester doe flie, The rest upon the earth together breathlesse lie. Muse, turne thee now to tell the Field at Hexam struck, Upon the Yorkists part, with the most prosp'rous luck Of any yet before, where to themselves they gain'd The Battell at Hexam. Most safetie, yet their powers least damage there sustain'd, Twixt John Lord Mountacute, that Nevill, who to stand For Edward, gathered had out of Northumberland A sort of valiant men, consisting most of Horse, Which were againe suppli'd with a most puisant force, Sent thither from the South, and by King Edward brought In person downe to Yorke, to ayd if that in ought His Generall should have need, for that he durst not trust The Northerne, which so oft to him had been unjust: Whilst he himselfe at Yorke, a second power doth hold, To heare in this rough warre, what the Lancastrians would. And Henry with his Queene, who to their powers had got, The lively daring French, and the light hardy Scot, To enter with them here, and to their part doe get, Their faithfull lov'd Allie, the Duke of Somerset, And Sir Ralfe Percie, then most powerfull in those parts, Who had beene reconcil'd to Edward, but their hearts Still with King Henry stay'd, to him and ever true, To whom by this revolt, they many Northerne drew: Sir William Taylboys, (cald of most) the Earle of Kime, With Hungerford, and Rosse, and Mullins, of that time Barons of high account, with Nevill, Tunstall, Gray, Hussy, and Finderne, Knights, men bearing mighty sway. As forward with his force, brave Mountacute was set, It hap'd upon his way at Hegly More he met With Hungerford, and Rosse, and Sir Ralph Percy, where, In signe of good successe (as certainly it were) They and their utmost force were quickly put to flight; Yet Percy as he was a most couragious Knight, Ne'r boudg'd till his last breath, but in the field was slaine. Proud of this first defeat, then marching forth againe, Towards Livells, a large Waste, which other plaines out-braves, Whose Verge fresh A little River neere Hexam. Dowell still is watring with her waves, Whereas his posting Scouts, King Henries power discri'd, Tow'rds whom with speedy march, this valiant Generall hied, Whose haste there likewise had such prosperous event, That lucklesse Henry yet, had scarcely cleer'd his Tent, His Captaines hardly set his Battels, nor enlarg'd Their Squadrons on the field, but this great Nevill charg'd: Long was this doubtfull fight on either side maintain'd, That rising whilst this falls, this loosing whilst that gain'd: The ground which this part got, and there as Conquerors stood, The other quickly gaine, and firmely make it good, To either as blind Chance, her favors will dispose; So to this part it eb'd, and to that side it flowes. At last, till whether 'twere that sad and horrid sight, At Saxton that yet did their fainting spirits affright, With doubt of second losse, and slaughter, or the ayd That Mountacute receav'd; King Henries power dismayd: And giving up the day, dishonourably fled, Whom with so violent speed the Yorkists followed, That had not Henry spur'd, and had a Courser swift, Besides a skilfull guide, through woods and hilles to shift, He sure had been surpriz'd, as they his Hench-men tooke, With whom they found his Helme; with most disastrous lucke, To save themselves by flight, ne'r more did any strive, And yet so many men ne'r taken were alive. The Battell of Banbury.Now Banbury we come thy Battell to report, And show th'efficient cause, as in what wondrous sort Great Warwicke was wrought in to the Lancastrian part, When as that wanton King so vex'd his mightie heart: Whilst in the Court of France, that Warriour he bestow'd, (As potent here at home, as powerfull else abroad) A marriage to intreat with Bona bright and sheene, Of the Savoyan Blood, and sister to the Queene, Which whilst this noble Earle negotiated there, The widdow Lady Gray, the King espoused here. By which the noble Earle in France who was disgrac'd, (In England his revenge doth but too quickly hast) T'excite the Northerne men doth secretly begin, (With whom he powerfull was) to rise, that comming in, The Citie of Yorke like to have bin fired by Warwicks faction.He might put in his hand, (which onely he desir'd) Which rising before Yorke were likely to have fierd The Citie, but repuls'd, and Holdorn them that led, Being taken, for the cause made shorter by the head. Yet would not they disist, but to their Captaines drew Henry the valiant sonne of John the Lord Fitz-Hugh, With Coniers that brave Knight, whose valour they preferre, With Henry Nevill, sonne to the Lord Latimer, By whose Allies and friends, they every day grew strong, And so in proud aray tow'rds London march along. Which when King Edward saw the world began to side With Warwicke, till himselfe he might of power provide, To noble Pembroke sends, those Rebels to withstand. Six thousand valiant Welsh, who mustring out of hand, By Richard Harberts ayd, his brother them doth bring, And for their greater strength (appointed by the King) Th'Lord Stafford (of his house) of Powick named then, Eight hundred Archers brought, the most selected men The Marches could make out: these having Severne crost, And up to Cotswould clome, they heard the Northern host, Being at Northampton then, it selfe tow'rds Warwicke wayd, When with a speedy march, the Harberts that forlayd Their passage, charg'd their Reare with neere two thousand horse, That the Lancastrian part suspecting all their force Had followed them againe, their armie bring about, Both with such speed and skill, that e're the Welsh got out, By having charg'd too farre, some of their Vaward lost, Beat to their armie backe; thus as these Legions coast, On Danemore they are met, indifferent for this warre, Whereas three easie hils that stand Trianguler, Small Edgcoat overlooke; on that upon the West The Welsh encampe themselves; the Northerne them possest Of that upon the South, whilst, (by warres strange event) Yong Nevill, who would brave the Harberts in their Tent, Leading a troupe of Youth, (upon that fatall plaine) Was taken by the Welsh, and miserably slaine; Of whose untimely death, his friends the next day tooke A terrible revenge, when Stafford there forsooke The army of the Welsh, and with his Archers bad Them fight that would for him; for that proud Pembroke had Displac'd him of his Inne, in Banbury where he His Paramore had lodg'd; where since he might not be, He backward shapes his course, and leaves the Harberts there, T'abide the brunt of all: with outcries every where The clamorous Drummes &amp; Fifes to the rough charge do sound, Together horse and man come tumbling to the ground: Then limbs like boughs were lop'd, from shoulders armes doe flie; They fight as none could scape, yet scape as none could die. The ruffling Northern Lads, and the stout Welshmen tri'd it; Then Head-pieces hold out, or braines must sore abide it. The Northern men Saint George for Lancaster doe crie: A Pembroke for the King, the lustie Welsh replie; When many a gallant youth doth desperatly assay, To doe some thing that might be worthy of the day: Where Richard Harbert beares into the Northern prease, And with his Poleaxe makes his way with such successe, That breaking through the Rankes, he their maine Battell past, And quit it so againe, that many stood aghast, That from the higher ground beheld him wade the crowd, As often ye behold in tempests rough and proud, O'rtaken with a storme, some Shell or little Crea, Hard labouring for the land, on the high-working Sea, Seemes now as swallowed up, then floating light and free O'th top of some high wave; then thinke that you it see Quite sunke beneath that waste of waters, yet doth cleere The Maine, and safely gets some Creeke or Harbor neere: So Harbert cleer'd their Host; but see th'event of warre, Some Spialls on the hill discerned had from farre Another Armie come to ayd the Northerne side, When they which Claphams craft so quickly not espide, Who with five hundred men about Northampton raisd, All discontented spirits, with Edwards rule displeasd, Displaying in the field great Warwicks dreaded Beare: The Welsh who thought the Earle in person had been there, Leading a greater power (disheartened) turne the backe Before the Northerne host, that quickly goe to wracke. Five thousand valiant Welsh are in chase o'rthrowne, Which but an houre before had thought the day their owne. Their Leaders (in the flight) the high-borne Harberts t'ane, At Banbury must pay for Henry Nevill slaine. The Battell of Stamford, or Loose-coat field.Now Stamford in due course, the Muse doth come to tell, Of thine owne named field, what in the fight befell, Betwixt brave youthfull Wells, from Lincolnshire that led Neere twentie thousand men, tow'rd London making head, Against the Yorkists power, great Warwicke to abet, Who with a puisant force prepared forth to set, To joyne with him in Armes, and joyntly take their chance. And Edward with his friends, who likewise doe advance His forces, to refell that desperate daring foe; Who for he durst himselfe in open Armes to show, Nor at his dread command them downe againe would lay. His father the Lord Wells, who he suppos'd might sway His so outragious sonne, with his lov'd law-made brother, Sir Thomas Dymock, thought too much to rule the other, He strangely did to die, which so incens'd the spleene Of this couragious youth, that he to wreake his teene Upon the cruell King, doth every way excite Him to an equall field, that com'n where they might smite The Battell: on this plaine it chanc'd their Armies met: They rang'd their severall fights, which once in order set, The loudly-brawling Drummes, which seemed to have feard The trembling ayre at first, soone after were not heard, For out-cries, shreekes, and showts, whilst noyse doth noyse confound. No accents touch the eare, but such as death doe sound: In thirsting for revenge, whilst fury them doth guide: As slaughter seemes by turnes to sease on either side. The Southerne expert were, in all to warre belong, And exercise their skill, the Marchmen stout and strong, Which to the Battell sticke, and if they make retreat, Yet comming on againe, the foe they backe doe beat, And Wels for Warwicke crie, and for the rightfull Crowne; The other call a Yorke, to beat the Rebels downe: The worst that warre could doe, on either side she showes, Or by the force of Bils, or by the strength of Bowes; But still by fresh supplies, the Yorkists power encrease: And Wels, who sees his troups so overborne with prease, By hazarding too farre into the boystrous throng, Incouraging his men the adverse troupes among, With many a mortall wound, his wearied breath expir'd: Which sooner knowne to his, then his first hopes desir'd, Ten thousand on the earth before them lying slaine, No hope left to repaire their ruin'd state againe, Cast off their Countries coats, to hast their speed away, (Of them) which Loose-coat field is cald (even) to this day. Since needsly I must sticke upon my former text, The Battell of Barnet. The bloody Battell fought, at Barnet followeth next, Twixt Edward, who before he setled was to raigne, By Warwicke hence expuls'd; but here ariv'd againe, From Burgundy, brought in munition, men and pay, And all things fit for warre, expecting yet a day. Whose brother George Duke of Clarence. George came in, with Warwicke that had stood, Whom nature wrought at length t'adhere to his owne blood: His brother Richard Duke of Gloster, and his friend; Lord Hastings, who to him their utmost powers extend; And Warwick, whose great heart so mortall hatred bore To Edward, that by all the Sacraments he swore, Not to lay downe his Armes, untill his sword had rac'd, That proud King from his Seat, that so had him disgrac'd: And Marquesse Mountacute, his brother, that brave stem Of Nevils noble Stock, who joyned had to them, The Dukes of Somerset, and Excester, and take The Earle of Oxford in; the Armies forward make, And meeting on the plaine, to Barnet very neere, That to this very day, is called Gladmore there. Duke Richard to the field, doth Edwards Vaward bring; And in the middle came that most couragious King, With Clarence his reclaim'd, and brother then most deare; His friend Lord Hastings had the guiding of the Reare, (A man of whom the King most highly did repute.) On puisant Warwicks part, the Marquesse Mountacute His brother, and his friend the Earle of Oxford led The right wing; and the left which most that day might sted, The Duke of Excester; and he himselfe doe guide The middle fight (which was the Armies onely pride) Of Archers most approv'd, the best that he could get, Directed by his friend, the Duke of Somerset. O Sabboth ill bestow'd, O drery Easter day, In which (as some suppose) the Sunne doth use to play, In honour of that God for sinfull man that dy'd, And rose on that third day, that Sunne which now doth hide His face in foggy mists; nor was that morning seene, So that the space of ground those angry hosts betweene, Was overshadowed quite with darknesse, which so cast The armies on both sides, that they each other past, Before they could perceive advantage, where to fight; Besides the envious mist so much deceiv'd their sight, That where eight hundred men, which valiant Oxford brought, Ware Comets on their coats: great Warwicks force which thought They had King Edwards beene, which so with Sunnes were drest, First made their shot at them, who by their friends distrest, Constrayned were to flie, being scattered here and there. But when this direfull day at last began to cleere, King Edward then beholds that height of his first hopes, Whose presence gave fresh life to his oft-fainting troupes, Prepar'd to scourge his pride, there daring to defie His mercie, to the host proclaiming publikely His hatefull breach of faith, his perjury, and shame, And what might make him vile; so Warwicke heard that name Of Yorke, which in the field he had so oft advanc'd, And to that glorious height, and greatnesse had inhanc'd, Then cried against his power, by those which oft had fled, Their swift pursuing foe, by him not bravely led, Upon the enemies backe, their swords bath'd in the gore Of those from whom they ran, like heartlesse men before, Which Warwicks nobler name injuriously defide, Even as the irefull host then joyned side to side. Where cruell Richard charg'd the Earles maine battell, when Proud Somerset therein, with his approoved men Stood stoutly to the shocke, and flang out such a flight Of shafts, as welneere seem'd t'eclipse the welcom'd light, Which forc'd them to fall off, on whose retreit againe, That great Battalion next approcheth the fayre plaine, Wherein the King himselfe in person was to trie, Proud Warwicks utmost strength: when Warwicke by and by, With his left wing came up, and charg'd so home and round, That had not his light horse by disvantagious ground Been hindred, he had strucke the heart of Edwards host: But finding his defeat, his enterprise so lost, He his swift Currers sends, to will his valiant brother, And Oxford, in command being equall to the other, To charge with the right wing, who bravely up doe beare; But Hastings that before raught thither with his Reare, And with King Edward joynd, the host too strongly arm'd. When every part with spoyle, with rape, with fury charm'd, Are prodigall of blood, that slaughter seemes to swill It selfe in humane gore, and every one cries kill. So doubtfull and so long the battell doth abide, That those, which to and fro, twixt that and London ride, That Warwicke winnes the day for certaine newes doe bring, Those following them againe, sayd certainly the King, Untill great Warwicke found his armie had the worse, And sore began to faint, alighting from his horse, In with the formost puts, and wades into the throng; And where he saw death stern'st, the murthered troupes among, He ventures, as the Sunne in a tempestuous day, With darknesse threatned long, yet sometimes doth display His cheerefull beames, which scarce appeare to the cleere eye, But suddenly the clouds, which on the winds doe flie, Doe muffle him againe within them, till at length, The storme (prevailing still with an unusuall strength) His cleerenesse quite doth close, and shut him up in night: So mightie Warwicke fares in this outragious fight. The cruell Lyons thus inclose the dreaded Beare, Whilst Montacute, who strives (if any helpe there were) To rescue his belov'd and valiant brother, fell: The losse of two such spirits at once, time shall not tell; The Duke of Somerset, and th'Earle of Oxford fled, And Excester being left for one amongst the dead, At length recovering life, by night escap'd away, Yorke never safely sat, till this victorious day. Thus Fortune to his end this mightie Warwicke brings This puisant setter up, and plucker downe of Kings. He who those battels wonne, which so much blood had cost, At Barnets fatall fight, both Life and Fortune lost. The Battell at Tewxbury.Now Tewksbury it rests, thy storry to relate, Thy sad and dreadfull fight, and that most direfull Fate Of the Lancastrian Line, which hapned on that day, Fourth of that fatall Month, that still-remembred May: Twixt Edmund that brave Duke of Somerset, who fled From Barnets bloody field, (againe there gathering head) And Marquesse Dorset bound in blood to ayd him there, With Thomas Courtney Earle of powerfull Devonshire: With whom King Henries sonne, young Edward there was seene, To claime his doubtlesse right, with that undaunted Queene His mother, who from France with succours came on land That day, when Warwicke fell at Barnet, which now stand, Their fortune yet to trie, upon a second fight. And Edward who imploy'd the utmost of his might, The poore Lancastrian part (which he doth eas'ly feele, By Warwicks mightie fall, already faintly reele) By Battell to subvert, and to extirpe the Line; And for the present act, his army doth assigne To those at Barnet field so luckily that sped; As Richard late did there, he here the Vaward led, The Maine the King himselfe, and Clarence tooke to guide; The Rearward as before by Hastings was supplide. The Army of the Queene, into three Battels cast, The first of which the Duke of Somerset, and (fast To him) his brother John doe happily dispose; The second, which the Prince for his owne safety chose The Barons of Saint John, and Wenlocke; and the third, To Courtney that brave Earle of Devonshire referd. Where in a spacious field they set their Armies downe; Behind, hard at their backes, the Abbey, and the Towne, To whom their foe must come, by often banks and steepe, Through quickset narrow Lanes, cut out with ditches deepe, Repulsing Edwards power, constraining him to proove By thundring Cannon shot, and Culvering to remoove Them from that chosen ground, so tedious to assayle; And with the shot came shafts, like stormy showres of Hayle: The like they sent againe, which beat the other sore, Who with the Ordnance strove the Yorkists to outrore, And still make good their ground, that whilst the Peeces play, The Yorkists hasting still to hand-blowes, doe assay, In strong and boystrous crowds to scale the combrous Dykes; But beaten downe with Bills, with Poleaxes, and Pykes, Are forced to fall off; when Richard there that led The Vaward, saw their strength so little them to sted, As he a Captaine was, both politique and good, The stratagems of warre, that rightly understood, Doth seeme as from the field his forces to withdraw. His sudden, strange retire, proud Somerset that saw, (A man of haughtie spirit, in honour most precise; In action yet farre more adventurous then wise) Supposing from the field for safetie he had fled, Straight giveth him the chase; when Richard turning head, By his incounter let the desperate Duke to know, Twas done to traine him out, when soone began the show Of slaughter every where; for scarce their equall forces Began the doubtfull fight, but that three hundred horses, That out of sight this while on Edwards part had stayd, To see that neere at hand no ambushes were layd, Soone charg'd them on the side, disordring quite their Ranks, Whilst this most warlike King had wonne the climing Banks, Upon the equall earth, and comming bravely in Upon the adverse power, there likewise doth begin A fierce and deadly fight, that the Lancastrian side, The first and furious shocke not able to abide The utmost of their strength, were forced to bestow, To hold what they had got; that Somerset below, Who from the second force, had still expected ayd, But frustrated thereof, even as a man dismaid, Scarce shifts to save himselfe his Battell overthrowne; But faring as a man that frantique had beene growne, With Wenlock hap'd to meet (preparing for his flight) Upbraiding him with tearmes of basenesse and despight, That cow'rdly he had faild to succour him with men: Whilst Wenlock with like words requiteth him agen, The Duke (to his sterne rage, as yeelding up the raines) With his too pondrous Axe pasht out the Barons braines. The partie of the Queene in every place are kild, The Ditches with the dead, confusedly are fild, And many in the flight, i'th neighbouring Rivers drown'd, Which with victorious wreaths, the conquering Yorkists crownd. Three thousand of those men, on Henries part that stood, For their presumption paid the forfeit of their blood. John Marquesse Dorset dead, and Devonshire that day Drew his last vitall breath, as in that bloody fray, Delves, Hamden, Whittingham, and Leuknor, who had there, Their severall brave commands, all valiant men that were, Found dead upon the earth. Now all is Edwards owne, And through his enemies tents he march'd into the towne, Where quickly he proclaimes, to him that foorth could bring Young Edward, a large Fee, and as he was a King, His person to be safe. Sir Richard Crofts who thought His prisoner to disclose, before the King then brought That faire and goodly Youth; whom when proud Yorke demands, Why thus he had presum'd by helpe of traytrous hands His kingdome to disturbe, and impiously display'd His Ensignes: the stout Prince, as not a jot dismay'd, With confidence replies, To claime his ancient right, Him from his Grandsires left; by tyranny and might, By him his foe usurp'd: with whose so bold reply, Whilst Edward throughly vext, doth seeme to thrust him by; His second brother George, and Richard neere that stood, The murther of Prince Edward. With many a cruell stab let out his princely blood; In whom the Line direct of Lancaster doth cease, And Somerset himselfe surprized in the prease; With many a worthy man, to Gloster prisoners led, There forfeited their lives: Queene Margaret being fled To a religious Cell, (to Tewksbury, too neere) Discoverd to the King, with sad and heavy cheere, A prisoner was convey'd to London, wofull Queene, The last of all her hopes, that buried now had seene. But of that outrage here, by that bold Bastard soone A briefe passage of the Bastard Falkonbridge his Rebellion. Of Thomas Nevill, nam'd Lord Falkonbridge, which wonne A rude rebellious Rout in Kent and Essex rais'd, Who London here besieg'd, and Southwarke having seas'd, Set fire upon the Bridge: but when he not prevaild, The Suburbs on the East he furiously assayl'd; But by the Cities power was lastly put to flight: Which being no set Field, nor yet well ordred fight, Amongst our Battels here, may no way reckoned be. Then Bosworth here the Muse now lastly bids for thee, The Battell of Bosworth. Thy Battell to describe, the last of that long warre, Entit'led by the name of Yorke and Lancaster; Twixt Henry Tudor Earle of Richmond onely left Of the Lancastrian Line, who by the Yorkists reft Of libertie at home, a banish'd man abroad, In Britany had liv'd; but late at Milford Road, Being prosperously ariv'd, though scarce two thousand strong, Made out his way through Wales, where as he came along. First Griffith great in Blood, then Morgan next doth meet Him, with their severall powers, as offring at his feet To lay their Lands, and lives; Sir Rice ap Thomas then, With his brave Band of Welsh, most choyce and expert men, Comes lastly to his ayd; at Shrewsbury ariv'd, (His hopes so faint before, so happily reviv'd) He on for England makes, and neere to Newport towne, The next ensuing night setting his Army downe, Sir Gilbert Talbot still for Lancaster that stood, (To Henry neere Alli'd in friendship as in Blood) From th'Earle of Shrewsbury his Nephew (under age) Came with two thousand men, in warlike Equipage, Which much his power increas'd; when easily setting on, From Lichfield, as the way leads foorth to Atherston, Brave Bourcher and his friend stout Hungerford, whose hopes On Henry long had laine, stealing from Richards troups, (Wherewith they had been mix'd) to Henry doe appeare, Which with a high resolve, most strangely seem'd to cheere, His oft-appauled heart, but yet the man which most, Gave sayle to Henries selfe, and fresh life to his host, The stout Lord Stanley was, who for he had affide The mother of the Earle, to him so neere allide: The King who fear'd his truth, (which he to have, compeld) The yong Lord Strange his sonne, in hostage strongly held, Which forc'd him to fall off, till he fit place could finde, His sonne in law to meet; yet he with him combinde Sir William Stanley, knowne to be a valiant Knight, T'assure him of his ayd. Thus growing tow'rds his hight, A most selected Band of Cheshire Bow-men came, By Sir John Savage led, besides two men of name: Sir Brian Sanford, and Sir Simon Digby, who Leaving the tyrant King, themselves expresly show Fast friends to Henries part, which still his power increast: Both Armies well prepar'd, towards Bosworth strongly preast, And on a spacious Moore, lying Southward from the towne; Indifferent to them both, they set their Armies downe Their Souldiers to refresh, preparing for the fight: Where to the guiltie King, that black fore-running night, Richards fearefull Dreames the night before the Battell.Appeare the dreadfull ghosts of Henry and his sonne, Of his owne brother George, and his two nephewes done Most cruelly to death; and of his wife and friend, Lord Hastings, with pale hands prepar'd as they would rend Him peece-meale; at which oft he roreth in his sleepe. No sooner gan the dawne out of the East to peepe, But Drummes and Trumpets chide, the Souldiers to their Armes, And all the neighboring fields are covered with the swarmes Of those that came to fight, as those that came to see, (Contending for a Crowne) whose that great day should be. First, Richmond rang'd his fights, on Oxford, and bestowes The leading, with a Band of strong and Sinewy Bowes Out of the Army pick'd; the Front of all the field, Sir Gilbert Talbot next, he wisely tooke to weeld, The right Wing, with his strengths, most Northern men that were. And Sir John Savage, with the power of Lancashire, And Cheshire (Chiefe of men) was for the left Wing plac'd: The Middle Battell he in his faire person grac'd, With him the noble Earle of Pembroke, who commands Their Countrey-men the Welsh, (of whom it mainly stands, For their great numbers found to be of greatest force) Which but his guard of Gleaves, consisted all of Horse. Into two severall fights the King contriv'd his strength, And his first Battell cast into a wondrous length, In fashion of a wedge, in poynt of which he set His Archery, thereof and to the guidance let Of John the noble Duke of Norfolke, and his sonne Brave Surrey: he himselfe the second bringing on, Which was a perfect square; and on the other side, His Horsemen had for wings, which by extending wide, The adverse seem'd to threat; with an unequall power. The utmost poynt ariv'd of this expected hower, He to Lord Stanley sends, to bring away his ayd; And threats him by an Oath, if longer he delayd His eldest sonne young Strange imediatly should die, To whom stout Stanley thus doth carelessely reply: Tell thou the King Ile come, when I fit time shall see, I love the Boy, but yet I have more sonnes then he. The angry Armies meet, when the thin ayre was rent, With such re-ecchoing shouts, from eithers Souldiers sent, That flying o'r the field the Birds downe trembling dropt. As some old building long that hath been underpropt, When as the Timber fayles, by the unweldy fall, Even into powder beats, the Roofe, and rotten wall, And with confused clouds of smouldring dust doth choke The streets and places neere; so through the mistie smoke, By Shot and Ordnance made, a thundring noyse was heard. When Stanley that this while his succours had deferd, Both to the cruell King, and to the Earle his sonne, When once he doth perceive the Battell was begun, Brings on his valiant Troups, three thousand fully strong, Which like a cloud farre off, that tempest threatned long, Falls on the Tyrants host, which him with terrour strooke, As also when he sees, he doth but vainly looke For succours from the great Northumberland, this while, That from the Battell scarce three quarters of a mile, Stood with his power of Horse, nor once was seene to stirre: When Richard (that th'event no longer would deferre, The two maine Battels mix'd, and that with wearied breath, Some laboured to their life, some laboured to their death, (There for the better fought) even with a Spirit elate, As one that inly scorn'd the very worst that Fate Could possibly impose, his Launce set in his Rest, Into the thick'st of Death, through threatning perill prest, To where he had perceiv'd the Earle in person drew, Whose Standard-Bearer he, Sir William Brandon slew, The pile of his strong staffe into his arme-pit sent; When at a second shocke, downe Sir John Cheney went, Which scarce a Launces length before the Earle was plac'd, Untill by Richmonds Guard, invironed at last, With many a cruell wound, was through the body gride. Upon this fatall field, John Duke of Norfolke dide; The stout Lord Ferrers fell, and Ratcliffe, that had long Of Richards counsels been, found in the field among A thousand Souldiers that on both sides were slaine, O Red-more, it then seem'd, thy name was not in vaine, When with a thousands blood the earth was coloured red. Whereas th'Emperiall Crowne was set on Henries head, Being found in Richards Tent, as he it there did winne; The cruell Tyrant stript to the bare naked skin, Behind a Herauld truss'd, was backe to Le'ster sent, From whence the day before he to the Battell went. The Battell of Stoke.The Battell then at Stoke, so fortunatly strucke, (Upon King Henries part, with so successefull lucke, As never till that day he felt his Crowne to cleave Unto his temples close, when Mars began to leave His fury, and at last to sit him downe was brought) I come at last to sing, twixt that seventh Henry fought; With whom, to this brave Field the Duke of Bedford came, With Oxford his great friend, whose praise did him inflame To all Atchievements great, that fortunate had bin In every doubtfull fight, since Henries comming in, With th'Earle of Shrewsbury, a man of great command, And his brave sonne Lord George, for him that firmly stand. And on the other side, John Duke of Suffolks sonne, (John Earle of Lincolne cald) who this sterne warre begun, Subborning a lewd Boy, a false Imposter, who By Simonds a worse Priest, instructed what to doe; Upon him tooke the name of th'Earle of Warwicke, heire To George the murthered Duke of Clarence, who (for feare Lest some that favoured Yorke, might under hand maintaine) King Henry in the Tower, did at that time detaine. The Dutchesse of Burgundy was sister to Edward the 4, and so was this Earles mother.Which practise set on foot, this Earle of Lincolne sayld To Burgundy, where he with Margaret prevayld, Wife to that warlike Charles, and his most loved Aunt, Who vexed that a proud Lancastrian should supplant The lawfull Line of Yorke, whence she her blood deriv'd; Wherefore for Lincolnes sake shee speedily contriv'd, And Lovell, that brave Lord, before him sent to land The Lord Francis Lovell. Upon the same pretence, to furnish them a Band Of Almanes, and to them for their stout Captaine gave The valiant Martin Swart, the man thought scarce to have His match for Martiall feats, and sent them with a Fleet For Ireland, where shee had appoynted them to meet, With Simonds that lewd Clerke, and Lambert, whom they there The Earle of Warwicke cald, and publish'd every where His title to the Crowne, in Divelin, and proclaime Him Englands lawfull King, by the fift Edwards name: Then joyning with the Lord Fitz-Gerald, to their ayd The Lord Thomas Geraldine. Who many Irish brought, they up their Ankres wayd, And at the rocky Pyle of On the coast of Lancashire. Fowdray put to shore In Lancashire; their power increasing more and more, By Souldiers sent them in from Broughton (for supply) Sir Thomas Broughton. A Knight that long had been of their confederacy; Who making thence, direct their marches to the South. When Henry saw himselfe so farre in dangers mouth, From Coventry he came, still gathering up his Host, Made greater on his way, and doth the Countrey coast, Which way he understood his enemies must passe: When after some few dayes (as if their Fortunes was) At Stoke, a village neere to Newarke upon Trent, Each in the others sight pitcht downe their warlike Tent. Into one Battell soone, the Almans had disposd Their Army, in a place upon two parts inclosd With Dells, and fenced Dykes, (as they were expert men.) And from the open fields King Henries Host agen, In three faire severall fights came equally devided; The first of which, and fitst, was given to be guided By Shrewsbury, which most of Souldiers choice consisted: The others plac'd as Wings, which ever as they listed, Came up as need requir'd, or fell backe as they found Just cause for their retire; when soone the troubled ground, On her black bosome felt the thunder, which awooke Her Genius, with the shock that violently shooke Her intrayles; this sad day when there ye might have seene Two thousand Almains stand, of which each might have beene A Leader for his skill, which when the charge was hot, That they could hardly see the very Sunne for shot, Yet they that motion kept that perfect Souldiers should; That most couragious Swart there might they well behold, With most unusuall skill, that desperate fight maintaine, And valiant De la Poole, most like his princely straine, Did all that courage could, or noblesse might befit; And Lovell that brave Lord, behind him not a whit, For martiall deeds that day: stout Broughton that had stood With Yorke (even) from the first, there lastly gave his blood To that well-foughten Field: the poore Trowz'd Irish there, Whose Mantles stood for Mayle, whose skinns for Corslets were, And for their weapons had but Irish Skaines and Darts, Like men that scorned death, with most resolved hearts, Give not an inch of ground, but all in pieces hewen, Where first they fought, they fell; with them was overthrowne The Leader Geralds hope, amidst his men that fought, And tooke such part as they, whom he had thither brought. A Field bravely fought.This of that field be told, There was not one that fled, But where he first was plac'd, there found alive or dead. If in a foughten field, a man his life should loose, To dye as these men did, who would not gladly choose, Which full foure thousand were. But in this tedious Song, The too laborious Muse hath taried all too long. As for the Black-Smiths Rout, who did together rise, Michael Joseph with the Cornish Rebels. The Rebellion of Cornwall, in the third yeere of Edward the sixt. Encamping on Blackheath, t'annull the Subsidies By Parliment then given, or that of Cornwall call'd, Inclosures to cast downe, which overmuch enthrald The Subject: or proud Kets, who with the same pretence In Norfolke rais'd such stirres, as but with great expence Of blood was not appeas'd; or that begun in Lent By Wyat and his friends, the Mariage to prevent, Sir Thomas Wyat. That Mary did intend with Philip King of Spaine: Since these but Ryots were, nor fit the others straine, Shee here her Battels ends: and as Shee did before, So travelling along upon her silent shore, Waybridge a neighbouring Nymph, the onely remnant left Of all that Forrest kind, by Times injurious theft Of all that tract destroy'd, with wood which did abound, And former times had seene the goodliest Forrest ground, This Iland ever had: but she so left alone, The ruine of her kind, and no man to bemoane. The deepe intranced Flood, as thinking to awake, Thus from her shady Bower shee silently bespake. O Flood in happy plight, which to this time, remainst, As still along in state to Neptunes Court thou strainst; Revive thee with the thought of those forepassed howers, When the rough Wood-gods kept, in their delightfull Bowers On thy embroydered bankes, when now this Country fild, With villages, and by the labouring plowman tild, Was Forrest, where the Firre, and spreading Poplar grew. O let me yet the thought of those past times renew, When as that woody kind, in our umbragious Wyld, Whence every living thing save onely they exild, In this their world of wast, the soveraigne Empire swayd. O who would ere have thought, that time could have decayd Those trees whose bodies seem'd by their so massie weight, To presse the solid earth, and with their wondrous height To climbe into the Clouds, their Armes so farre to shoot, As they in measuring were of Acres, and their Root, With long and mightie spurnes to grapple with the land, As Nature would have sayd, that they should ever stand: So that this place where now this Huntingdon is set, Being an easie hill where mirthfull Hunters met, From that first tooke the name. By this the Muse arives At Elies Iled Marge, by having past Saint Ives, Unto the German Sea shee hasteth her along, And here shee shutteth up her two and twentieth Song, In which shee quite hath spent her vigor, and must now, As Workmen often use, a while sit downe and blow; And after this short pause, though lesning of her height, Come in another Key, yet not without delight. The three and twentieth Song The Argument. From furious Fights Invention comes, Deafned with noyse of ratling Drummes, And in the Northamptonian bounds, Shewes Whittlewoods, and Sacies grounds; Then to Mount Hellidon doth goe, (Whence Charwell, Leame, and Nen doe flow) The Surface, which of England sings, And Nen downe to the Washes brings; Then whereas Welland makes her way, Shewes Rockingham, her rich aray: A Course at Kelmarsh then shee takes, Where shee Northamptonshire forsakes. On tow'ds the Mid-lands now, th'industrious Muse doth make, The Northamptonian earth, and in her way doth take; As fruitfull every way, as those by Nature, which The Husbandman by Art, with Compost doth inrich, This boasting of her selfe; that walke her Verge about, And view her well within, her breadth, and length throughout: The worst foot of her earth, is equall with their best, With most aboundant store, that highliest thinke them blest. When Whittlewood betime th'unwearied Muse doth win To talke with her awhile; at her first comming in, The Forrest thus that greets: With more successefull Fate, Thrive then thy fellow Nymphs, whose sad and ruinous state We every day behold, if any thing there be, That from this generall fall, thee happily may free, 'Tis onely for that thou dost naturally produce More Under-wood, and Brake, then Oke for greater use: But when this ravenous Age, of those hath us bereft, Time wanting this our store, shall sease what thee is left. For what base Averice now inticeth men to doe, Necessitie in time shall strongly urge them too; Which each divining Spirit most cleerely doth foresee. Whilst at this speech perplext, the Forrest seem'd to be, A Water-nymph, neere to this goodly Wood-nymphs side, (As tow'rds her soveraigne Ouze, shee softly downe doth slide) Tea, her delightsome streame by Tawcester doth lead; And sporting her sweet selfe in many a daintie Mead, Shee hath not sallied farre, but Sacy soone againe Salutes her; one much grac'd amongst the Sylvan traine: One whom the Queene of Shades, the bright Diana oft Hath courted for her lookes, with kisses smooth and soft, On her faire Bosome lean'd, and tenderly imbrac't, And cald her, her Deare heart, most lov'd, and onely chast: Yet Sacie after Tea, her amourous eyes doth throw, Till in the bankes of Ouze the Brooke her selfe bestow. Where in those fertill fields, the Muse doth hap to meet Upon that side which sits the West of Watling-street, With A hill not farre from Daventry. Helidon a Hill, which though it bee but small, Compar'd with their proud kind, which we our Mountaines call; Yet hath three famous Floods, that out of him doe flow, That to three severall Seas, by their assistants goe; Of which the noblest, Nen, to fayre Northampton hies, By Owndle sallying on, then Peterborough plyes Old The ancient name of Peterborough. Medhamsted: where her the Sea-mayds intertaine, To lead her through the Fen into the German Maine. The second, Charwell is, at Oxford meeting Thames, Is by his King convayd into the The French Sea. Celtick streames. Then Leame as least, the last, to mid-land Avon hasts, Which Flood againe it selfe, into proud Severne casts: As on The Spanish Sea. th'Iberian Sea, her selfe great Severne spends; So Leame the Dower she hath, to that wide Ocean lends. But Helidon wax'd proud, the happy Sire to be To so renowned Floods, as these fore-named three, Besides the Hill of note, neere Englands midst that stands, Whence from his Face, his backe, or on his either hands, The Land extends in bredth, or layes it selfe in length. Wherefore, this Hill to shew his state and naturall strength, The surface of this part determineth to show, Which we now England name, and through her tracts to goe. But being plaine and poore, professeth not that hight, As Falkon-like to sore, till lesning to the sight. But as the sundry soyles, his style so altring oft, As full expressions fit, or Verses smooth and soft, Upon their severall Scites, as naturally to straine, And wisheth that these Floods, his tunes to entertaine, The ayre with Halcion calmes, may wholly have possest, As though the rough winds tyerd, were eas'ly layd to rest. Then on the worth'est tract up tow'rds the mid-dayes Sun, His undertaken taske, thus Hellidon begun. From where the kingly Thames his stomacke doth discharge, A discription of the Surface of the sundrie Tracts of England. To Devonshire, where the land her bosome doth inlarge; And with the In-land ayre, her beauties doth releeve, Along the Celtick Sea, cald oftentimes the Sleeve: Although upon the coast, the Downes appeare but bare, Yet naturally within the Countries wooddy are. Then Cornwall creepeth out into the westerne Maine, As (lying in her eye) shee poynted still at Spaine: Or as the wanton soyle, disposd to lustfull rest, Had layd her selfe along on Neptunes amorous breast. With Denshire, from the firme, that Beake of land that fils, What Landskip lies in Vales, and often rising hils, So plac'd betwixt the French, and the Sabrinian Seas, As on both sides adorn'd with many harborous Bayes, Who for their Trade to Sea, and wealthy Mynes of Tinne, From any other Tract, the praise doth clearely winne. From Denshire by those shores, which Severne oft Surrounds, The Soyle farre lower sits, and mightily abounds With sundry sort of Fruits, as well-growne Grasse and Corne, That Somerset may say, her batning Mores doe scorne Our Englands richest earth, for burthen should them staine; And on the selfe same Tract, up Severns streame againe, The Vale of Evsham layes her length so largely forth, As though shee meant to stretch her selfe into the North, Where still the fertill earth depressed lyes and low, Till her rich Soyle it selfe to Warwickshire doe show. Hence somewhat South by East, let us our course incline, And from these setting shores so meerely Maratine, The Iles rich In-land parts, lets take with us along, To set him rightly out, in our well-ordred Song; Whose prospects to the Muse their sundry scites shall show, Where shee from place to place, as free as ayre shall flow, Their superficies so exactly to descry, Through Wiltshire, poynting how the Plaine of Salisbury Shootes foorth her selfe in length, and layes abroad a traine So large, as though the land serv'd scarsely to containe Her vastnesse, North from her, himselfe proud Cotswould vaunts, And casts so sterne a looke, about him that he daunts, The lowly Vales, remote that sit with humbler eyes. In Barckshire, and from thence into the Orient lies That most renowned Vale of White-horse, and by her, So Buckingham againe doth Alsbury preferre, With any English Earth, along upon whose pale, That mounting Countrie then, which maketh her a Vale, The chaulky Chilterne, runnes with Beeches crown'd about, Through Bedfordshire that beares, till his bald front he shoot, Into that foggy earth towards Ely, that doth grow Much Fenny, and surrounds with every little flow. So on into the East, upon the In-land ground, The River running by Uxbridge, falling into the Thames at Colebrooke.From where that Christall Colne most properly doth bound, Rough Chilterne, from the soyle, where in rich London sits, As being faire and flat it naturally befits Her greatnesse every way, which holdeth on along To the Essexian earth, which likewise in our Song, Since in one Tract they lye, we here together take, Although the severall Shires, by sundry soyles doe make It different in degrees; for Middlesex of Sands Her soyle composed hath; so are th'Essexian lands, Adjoyning to the same, that sit by Isis side, Which London over-lookes: but as she waxeth wide, So Essex in her Tydes, her deepe-growne Marshes drownds, And to Inclosures cuts her drier upland grounds, Which lately woody were, whilst men those woods did prize; Whence those fayre Countries lie, upon the pleasant rise, (Betwixt the mouth of Thames, and where Ouze roughly dashes Her rude unweildy waves, against the queachy Washes) Suffolke and Norfolke neere, so named of their Scites, Adorned every way with wonderfull delights, To the beholding eye, that every where are seene, Abounding with rich fields, and pastures fresh and greene, Faire Havens to their shores, large Heaths within them lie, As Nature in them strove to shew varietie. From Ely all along upon that Easterne Sea, Then Lincolneshire her selfe, in state at length doth lay, Which for her fatning Fennes, her Fish, and Fowle may have Preheminence, as she that seemeth to out-brave All other Southerne Shires, whose head the Washes feeles, Till wantonly she kicke proud Humber with her heeles. Up tow'rds the Navell then, of England from her Flanke, Which Lincolneshire we call, so levelled and lanke. Northampton, Rutland then, and Huntingdon, which three Doe shew by their full Soyles, all of one piece to be, Of Nottingham a part, as Lester them is lent, From Bevers batning Vale, along the banks of Trent. So on the other side, into the Set againe, Where Severne tow'rds the Sea from Shrewsbury doth straine, Twixt which and Avons banks (where Arden when of old, See to the 13. Song. Her bushy curled front, she bravely did uphold, In state and glory stood) now of three severall Shires, The greatest portions lie, upon whose earth appeares That mightie Forrests foot, of Worstershire a part, Of Warwickeshire the like, which sometime was the heart Of Arden that brave Nymph, yet woody here and there, Oft intermixt with Heaths, whose Sand and Gravell beare, A Turfe more harsh and hard, where Stafford doth partake, In qualitie with those, as Nature strove to make Them of one selfe same stuffe, and mixture, as they lye, Which likewise in this Tract, we here together tye. From these recited parts to th'North, more high and bleake, Extended ye behold, the Mooreland and the Peake, From eithers severall scite, in eithers mightie waste, A sterner lowring eye, that every way doe cast On their beholding Hills, and Countries round about; Whose soyles as of one shape, appearing cleane throughout. For Moreland which with Heath most naturally doth beare, Her Winter livery still, in Summer seemes to weare; As likewise doth the Peake, whose dreadfull Caverns found, And Lead-mines, that in her, doe naturally abound, Her superficies makes more terrible to show: So from her naturall fount, as Severne downe doth flow, The high Sallopian hills lift up their rising sayles; Which Country as it is the near'st alli'd to Wales, In Mountaines, so it most is to the same alike. Now tow'rds the Irish Seas a little let us strike, Where Chesshire, (as her choyce) with Lancashire doth lie Along th'unlevel'd shores; this former to the eye, In her complexion showes blacke earth with gravell mixt, A Wood-land and a plaine indifferently betwixt, A good fast-feeding grasse, most strongly that doth breed: As Lancashire no lesse excelling for her seed, Although with Heath, and Fin, her upper parts abound; As likewise to the Sea, upon the lower ground, With Mosses, Fleets, and Fells, she showes most wild and rough, Whose Turfe, and square cut Peat, is fuell good ynough. So, on the North of Trent, from Nottingham above, Where Sherwood her curld front, into the cold doth shove, Light Forrest land is found, to where the floting Don, In making tow'rds the Maine, her Doncaster hath won, Where Yorkshire's layd abroad, so many a mile extent, To whom preceding times, the greatest circuit lent, A Province, then a Shire, which rather seemeth: so It incidently most varietie doth show. Heere stony stirrill grounds, there wondrous fruitfull fields, Here Champaine, and there Wood, it in abundance yeelds: Th'West-riding, and North, be mountainous and high, But tow'rds the German Sea the East, more low doth lie. This Ile hath not that earth, of any kind elsewhere, But on this part or that, epitomized here. Tow'rds those Scotch-Irish Iles, upon that Sea againe, The rough Virgivian cald, that tract which doth containe Cold Cumberland, which yet wild Westmerland excels, For roughnesse, at whose point lies rugged Fournesse Fells, Is fild with mighty Mores, and Mountaines, which doe make Her wilde superfluous waste, as Nature sport did take In Heaths, and high-cleev'd Hils, whose threatning fronts doe dare Each other with their looks, as though they would out-stare The Starry eyes of heaven, which to out-face they stand. From these into the East, upon the other hand, The Bishopricke, and fayre Northumberland doe beare To Scotlands bordering Tweed, which as the North elsewhere, Not very fertile are, yet with a lovely face Upon the Ocean looke; which kindly doth imbrace Those Countries all along, upon the Rising side, Which for the Batfull Gleabe, by nature them denide, With mightie Mynes of Cole, abundantly are blest, By which this Tract remaines renown'd above the rest: For what from her rich wombe, each harbourous Road receives. Yet Hellidon not here, his lov'd description leaves, Though now his darling Springs desir'd him to desist; But say all what they can, hee'll doe but what he list. As he the Surface thus, so likewise will he show, The Clownish Blazons, to each Country long agoe, Which those unlettered times, with blind devotion lent, Before the Learned Mayds our Fountaines did frequent, To shew the Muse can shift her habit, and she now Of Palatins that sung, can whistle to the Plow; And let the curious tax his Clownry, with their skill He recks not, but goes on, and say they what they will. Kent first in our account, doth to it selfe apply, Here follow the Blazons of the Shires. (Quoth he) this Blazon first, Long Tayles and Libertie. Sussex with Surrey say, Then let us lead home Logs. As Hamshire long for her, hath had the tearme of Hogs. So Dorsetshire of long, they Dorsers usd to call. Cornwall and Devonshire crie, Weele wrastle for a Fall. Then Somerset sayes, Set the Bandog on the Bull. And Glostershire againe is blazon'd, Weigh thy Wooll. As Barkshire hath for hers, Lets to't and tosse the Ball. And Wiltshire will for her, Get home and pay for all. Rich Buckingham doth beare the terme of Bread and Beefe, Where if you beat a Bush, tis ods you start a Theefe. So Hartford blazon'd is, The Club, and clowted Shoone, Thereto, Ile rise betime, and sleepe againe at Noone. When Middlesex bids, Up to London let us goe, And when our Markets done, weele have a pot or two. As Essex hath of old beene named, Calves and Styles, Fayre Suffolke, Mayds and Milke, and Norfolke, Many Wyles. So Cambridge hath been call'd, Hold Nets, and let us winne; And Huntingdon, With Stilts weele stalke through thick and thinne. Northamptonshire of long hath had this Blazon, Love, Below the girdle all, but little else above. An outcrie Oxford makes, The Schollers have been heere, And little though they payd, yet have they had good cheere. Quoth warlike Warwickshire, Ile binde the sturdy Beare. Quoth Worstershire againe, And I will squirt the Peare. Then Staffordshire bids Stay, and I will Beet the Fire, And nothing will I aske, but good will for my hire. Beane-belly Lestershire, her attribute doth beare. And Bells and Bag-pipes next, belong to Lincolneshire. Of Malt-horse, Bedfordshire long since the Blazon wan. And little Rutlandshire is tearmed Raddleman. To Darby is assign'd the name of Wooll and Lead. As Nottinghams, of old (is common) Ale and Bread. So Hereford for her sayes, Give me Woofe and Warpe. And Shropshire saith in her, That Shinnes be ever sharpe, Lay wood upon the fire, reach hither mee my Harpe, And whilst the blacke Bowle walks, we merily will carpe. Old Chesshire is well knowne to be the Chiefe of Men. Faire Women doth belong to Lancashire agen. The lands that over Ouze to Berwicke foorth doe beare, Have for their Blazon had the Snaffle, Spurre, and Speare. Now Nen extreamely griev'd those barbarous things to heare, By Helidon her sire, that thus delivered were: For as his eld'st, shee was to passed ages knowne, Whom by Aufona's name the Romans did renowne. A word by them deriv'd of Avon, which of long, The Britans cald her by, expressing in their tongue The full and generall name of waters; wherefore shee Stood much upon her worth, and jealous grew to bee, Lest things so low and poore, and now quite out of date, Should happily impaire her dignitie and state. Wherefore from him her syre imediatly she hasts; And as shee foorth her course to Peterborough casts, Shee falleth in her way with Weedon, where tis sayd, Saint Werburge princely borne, a most religious Mayd, From those peculier fields, by prayer the Wild-geese drove, Thence through the Champaine shee lasciviously doth rove Tow'rds faire Northampton, which, whilst Nen was Avon cald, Resum'd that happy name, as happily instald Upon her Northampton, for Northavonton, the towne upon the North of Avon. Northerne side, where taking in a Rill, Her long impoverish'd banks more plenteously to fill, She flourishes in state, along the fruitfull fields; Where whilst her waters shee with wondrous pleasure yeelds, To So called of his many wells or Fountaines. Wellingborough comes, whose Fountaines in shee takes, Which quickening her againe, imediately shee makes To Owndle, which receives contractedly the sound From Avondale, t'expresse that Rivers lowest ground: To Peterborough thence she maketh foorth her way, Where Welland hand in hand, goes on with her to Sea; When Rockingham, the Muse to her faire Forrest brings, Thence lying to the North, whose sundry gifts she sings. O deare and daintie Nymph, most gorgeously arayd, Of all the Driades knowne, the most delicious Mayd, With all delights adorn'd, that any way beseeme A Sylvan, by whose state we verily may deeme A Deitie in thee, in whose delightfull Bowers, The Fawnes and Fayries make the longest dayes, but howers, And joying in the Soyle, where thou assum'st thy seat, Thou to thy Handmaid hast, (thy pleasures to awayt) Faire Benefield, whose care to thee doth surely cleave, Which beares a grasse as soft, as is the daintie sleave, And thrum'd so thicke and deepe, that the proud Palmed Deere, Forsake the closser woods, and make their quiet leyre In beds of platted fogge, so eas'ly there they sit. A Forrest and a Chase in every thing so fit This Iland hardly hath, so neere allide that be, Brave Nymph, such praise belongs to Benefield and thee. Whilst Rockingham was heard with these Reports to ring, The Muse by making on tow'rds Wellands ominous Spring, With A place in the North part of Northamtonshire, excellent for coursing with Greyhounds. Kelmarsh there is caught, for coursing of the Hare, Which scornes that any place, should with her Plaines compare: Which in the proper Tearmes the Muse doth thus report; The man whose vacant mind prepares him to the sport, The The Hare-finder. Finder sendeth out, to seeke out nimble Wat, Which crosseth in the field, each furlong, every Flat, Till he this pretty Beast upon the Forme hath found, Then viewing for the Course, which is the fairest ground, A description of a Course at the Hare. The Greyhounds foorth are brought, for coursing then in case, And choycely in the Slip, one leading forth a brace; The Finder puts her up, and gives her Coursers law. And whilst the eager dogs upon the Start doe draw, Shee riseth from her seat, as though on earth she flew, Forc'd by some yelping A Curre. Cute to give the Greyhounds view, Which are at length let slip, when gunning out they goe, As in respect of them the swiftest wind were slow, When each man runnes his Horse, with fixed eyes, and notes Which Dog first turnes the Hare, which first the other coats, When one Greyhound outstrips the other in the Course.They wrench her once or twice, ere she a turne will take, Whats offred by the first, the other good doth make; And turne for turne againe with equall speed they ply, Bestirring their swift feet with strange agilitie: A hardned ridge or way, when if the Hare doe win, Then as shot from a Bow, she from the Dogs doth spin, That strive to put her off, but when hee cannot reach her, This giving him a Coat, about againe doth fetch her To him that comes behind, which seemes the Hare to beare; But with a nimble turne shee casts them both arrere: Till oft for want of breath, to fall to ground they make her, The Greyhounds both so spent, that they want breath to take her. Here leave I whilst the Muse more serious things attends, And with my Course at Hare, my Canto likewise ends. The foure and twentieth Song. The Argument. The fatall Welland from her Springs, This Song to th'Ile of Ely brings: Our ancient English Saints revives, Then in an oblique course contrives, The Rarities that Rutland showes, Which with this Canto shee doth close. This way, to that faire Fount of Welland hath us led, At The Fountaine of Welland. Nasby to the North, where from a second head Runs Avon, which along to Severne shapes her course, But pliant Muse proceed, with our new-handled sourse, Of whom from Ages past, a prophecie there ran, (Which to this ominous flood much feare and reverance wan) That she alone should drowne all Holland, and should see An ancient Prophecie of the River of Welland. Her Stamford, which so much forgotten seemes to bee; Renown'd for Liberall Arts, as highly honoured there, As they in Cambridge are, or Oxford ever were; Whereby shee in her selfe a holinesse suppos'd, That in her scantled banks, though wandring long inclos'd, Yet in her secret breast a Catalogue had kept Of our religious Saints, which though they long had slept, Yet through the chrystned world, for they had wonne such fame Both to the British first, then to the English name, For their abundant Faith, and sanctimony knowne, Such as were hither sent, or naturally our owne, It much her Genius grievd, to have them now neglected, Whose pietie so much those zealous times respected. Wherefore she with her selfe resolved, when that shee To Peterborough came, where much shee long'd to be, That in the wished view of Medhamsted, that Towne, Which he the greatst of Saints doth by his Name renowne, Shee to his glorious Phane an Offring as to bring, Of her deare Countries Saints, the Martyrologe would sing: And therefore all in haste to Harborough she hy'd, Whence Lestershire she leaves upon the Northward side, The course of Welland to the Sea. At Rutland then ariv'd, where Stamford her sustaines, By Deeping drawing out, to Lincolneshire she leanes, Upon her Bank by North, against this greater throng, Northamptonshire to South still lyes with her along, And now approching neere to this appointed place, Where she and Nen make shew as though they would imbrace; But onely they salute, and each holds on her way, When holy Welland thus was wisely heard to say. I sing of Saints, and yet my Song shall not be fraught With Myracles by them, but fayned to be wrought, That they which did their lives so palpably belye, To times have much impeach'd their holinesse thereby: Though fooles (I say) on them, such poore impostures lay, Have scandal'd them to ours, farre foolisher then they, Which thinke they have by this so great advantage got Their venerable names from memory to blot, Which truth can ne'r permit; and thou that art so pure, The name of such a Saint that no way canst endure; Know in respect of them to recompense that hate, The wretchedst thing, and thou have both one death and date: From all vaine worship too; and yet am I as free As is the most precise, I passe not who hee bee. Antiquitie I love, nor by the worlds despight, I can not be remoov'd from that my deare delight. This spoke, to her faire ayd her sister Nen shee winnes, When shee of all her Saints, now with that man beginnes. Saints in the Primitive British Church.The first that ever told Christ crucified to us, (By Paul and Peter sent) just Aristobulus, Renown'd in holy Writ, a Labourer in the word, For that most certaine Truth, opposing fire and sword, By th'Britans murthered here, so unbeleeving then. Next holy Joseph came, the mercifulst of men, The Saviour of mankind, in Sepulchre that layd, That to the Britans was th'Apostle; in his ayd Saint Duvian, and with him Saint Fagan, both which were His Scollers, likewise left their sacred Reliques here: All Denizens of ours, t'advaunce the Christian state, At Glastenbury long that were commemorate. When Amphiball againe our Martyrdome began In that most bloody raigne of Dioclesian: This man into the truth, that blessed Alban led (Our Proto-Martyr call'd) who strongly discipled In Christian Patience, learnt his tortures to appease: His fellow-Martyrs then, Stephen, and Socrates, At holy Albans Towne, their Festivall should hold; So of that Martyr nam'd, (which Ver'lam was of old.) A thousand other Saints, whom Amphiball had taught, Flying the Pagan foe, their lives that strictly sought, Were slaine where Lichfield is, whose name doth rightly sound, (There of those Christians slaine) Dead field, or burying ground. Then for the Christian faith, two other here that stood, And teaching, bravely seald their Doctrine with their blood: Saint Julius, and with him Saint Aron, have their roome, At Carleon suffring death by Dioclesians doome; Whose persecuting raigne tempestuously that rag'd, Gainst those here for the Faith, their utmost that ingag'd, Saint Angule put to death, one of our holiest men, At London, of that See, the godly Bishop then In that our Infant Church, so resolute was he. A second Martyr too grace Londons ancient See, Though it were after long, good Voadine who reprov'd Proud Vortiger his King, unlawfully that lov'd Anothers wanton wife, and wrong'd his Nuptiall bed; For which by that sterne Prince unjustly murthered, As he a Martyr dy'd, is Sainted with the rest. The third Saint of that See (though onely he confest) Was Guithelme, unto whom those times that reverence gave, As he a place with them eternally shall have. So Melior may they bring, the Duke of Cornwalls sonne, By his false brothers hands, to death who being done In hate of Christian faith, whose zeale lest time should taint, As he a Martyr was, they justly made a Saint. Those godly Romans then (who as mine Authour saith) Wanne good King Lucius first t'imbrace the Christian faith, Fugatius, and his friend Saint Damian, as they were Made Denizens of ours, have their remembrance here: As two more (neere that time, Christ Jesus that confest, And that most lively faith, by their good works exprest) Saint Elvan with his pheere Saint Midwin, who to win The Britans, (com'n from Rome, where Christned they had bin) Converted to the Faith their thousands, whose deare grave, That Glastenbury grac'd, there their memoriall have. As they their sacred Bones in Britaine here bestow'd, So Britaine likewise sent her Saints to them abroad: Britain sendeth her holy men to other countries. Marsellus that just man, who having gathered in The scattered Christian Flocke, instructed that had bin By holy Joseph here; to congregate he wan This justly named Saint, this never-wearied man, Next to the Germans preach'd, till (voyd of earthly feare) By his couragious death, he much renown'd Trevere. Then of our Native Saints, the first that di'd abroad; Beatus, next to him shall fitly be bestow'd, In Switzerland who preach'd, whom there those Paynims slue, When greater in their place, though not in Faith, ensue Saint Lucius (call'd of us) the primer christned King, Of th'ancient Britons then, who led the glorious ring To all the Saxon Race, that here did him succeed, Changing his regall Robe to a religious Weed, His rule in Britaine left, and to Helvetia hied, Where he a Bishop liv'd, a Martyr lastly died. As Constantine the Great, that godly Emperour, Here first the Christian Church that did to peace restore, Whose ever blessed birth, (as by the power divine) The Roman Empire brought into the British Line, Constantinoples Crowne, and th'ancient Britans glory. So other here we have to furnish up our Story, Saint Melon welneere, when the British Church began, (Even early in the raigne of Romes Valerian) Here leaving us for Rome, from thence to Roan was cald, To preach unto the French, where soone he was instauld Her Bishop: Britaine so may of her Gudwall vaunt, Who first the Flemmings taught, whose feast is held at Gaunt. So others foorth she brought, to little Britaine vow'd, Saint Wenlocke, and with him Saint Sampson, both alow'd Apostles of that place, the first the Abbot sole Of Tawrac, and the last sate on the See of Dole: Where dying, Maglor then, thereof was Bishop made, Sent purposely from hence, that people to perswade, To keepe the Christian faith: so Golvin gave we thither, Who sainted being there, we set them here together. As of the weaker Sex, that ages have enshrin'd Amongst the British Dames, and worthily divin'd: The finder of the Crosse Queene Helena doth lead, Who though Rome set a Crowne on her Emperiall head, Yet in our Britaine borne, and bred up choicely here. Emerita the next, King Lucius sister deare, Who in Helvetia with her martyred brother di'd; Bright Ursula the third, who undertooke to guide Th'eleven thousand Mayds to little Britaine sent, By Seas and bloody men devoured as they went: Of which we find these foure have been for Saints preferd, (And with their Leader still doe live incalenderd) Saint Agnes, Cordula, Odillia, Florence, which With wondrous sumptuous shrines those ages did inrich At Cullen, where their Lives most clearely are exprest, And yearely Feasts observ'd to them and all the rest. But when it came to passe the Saxon powers had put The Britans from these parts, and them o'r Severne shut, The Cambro-British Saints. The Christian Faith with her, then Cambria had alone, With those that it receiv'd (from this now England) gone, Whose Cambrobritans so their Saints as duely brought, T'advance the Christian Faith, effectually that wrought, Their David, (one deriv'd of th'royall British blood) Who gainst Palagius false and damn'd opinions stood, And turn'd Menenias name to Davids sacred See, The Patron of the Welsh deserving well to be: With Cadock, next to whom comes Canock, both which were Prince Brechans sonnes, who gave the name to Brecnocksheere; The first a Martyr made, a Confessor the other. So Clintanck, Brecknocks Prince, as from one selfe same mother, A Saint upon that seat, the other doth ensue, Whom for the Christian Faith a Pagan Souldier slue. So Bishops can shee bring, which of her Saints shall bee, As Asaph, who first gave that name unto that See; Of Bangor, and may boast Saint David which her wan Much reverence, and with these Owdock and Telean, Both Bishops of Landaff, and Saints in their Succession; Two other following these, both in the same profession, Saint Dubric whose report old Carleon yet doth carry, And Elery in Northwales, who built a Monastery, In which himselfe became the Abot, to his praise, And spent in Almes and Prayer the remnant of his dayes. But leaving these Divin'd, to Decuman we come, In Northwales who was crown'd with glorious Martyrdome. Justinian, as that man a Sainted place deserv'd, Who still to feed his soule, his sinfull body sterv'd: And for that height in zeale, whereto he did attaine, There by his fellow Monkes most cruelly was slaine. So Cambria, Beno bare; and Gildas, which doth grace Old Bangor, and by whose learn'd writings we imbrace, The knowledge of those times; the fruits of whose just pen, Shall live for ever fresh, with all truth-searching men: Then other, which for hers old Cambria doth averre, Saint Senan, and with him wee set Saint Deiserre, Then Tather will we take, and Chyned to the rest, With Baruk, who so much the Ile of Bardsey blest By his most powerfull prayer, to solitude that liv'd, And of all worldly care his zealous Soule depriv'd. Of these, some liv'd not long, some wondrous aged were, But in the Mountaines liv'd, all Hermits here and there. O more then mortall men, whose Faith and earnest prayers, Not onely bare ye hence, but were those mightie stayres By which you went to heaven, and God so clearely saw, As this vaine earthly pompe had not the power to draw Your elevated soules, but once to looke so low, As those depressed paths, wherein base worldlings goe. What mind doth not admire the knowledge of these men? But zealous Muse returne unto thy taske agen. These holy men at home, as here they were bestow'd, So Cambria had such too, as famous were abroad. Sophy King Gulicks sonne of Northwales, who had seene The Sepulchre three times, and more, seven times had beene On Pilgrimage at Rome, of Beniventum there The painfull Bishop made; by him so place we here, Saint Mackloue, from Northwales to little Britaine sent, That people to convert, who resolutely bent, Of Athelney in time the Bishop there became, Which her first title chang'd, and tooke his proper name. So she her Virgins had, and vow'd as were the best: Saint Keyne Prince Brechans child, (a man so highly blest, That thirtie borne to him all Saints accounted were.) Saint Inthwar so apart shall with these other beare, Who out of false suspect was by her brother slaine. Then Winifrid, whose name yet famous doth remaine, Whose Fountaine in Northwales intitled by her name, For Mosse, and for the Stones that be about the same, Is sounded through this Ile, and to this latter age Is of our Romists held their latest Pilgrimage. But when the Saxons here so strongly did reside, And surely seated once, as owners to abide; When nothing in the world to their desire was wanting, Except the Christian Faith, for whose substantiall planting, Saint Augustine from Rome was to this Iland sent; Those that came from forraine parts into this Ile, &amp; were canonized here for Saints. And comming through large France, ariving first in Kent, Converted to the faith King Ethelbert, till then Unchristened that had liv'd, with all his Kentishmen, And of their chiefest Towne, now Canterbury cald, The Bishop first was made, and on that See instauld. Foure other, and with him for knowledge great in name, That in this mighty worke of our conversion came, Lawrence, Melitus then, with Justus, and Honorius, In this great Christian worke, all which had beene laborious, To venerable age, each comming in degree, Succeeded him againe in Canterbury See, As Peter borne in France, with these and made our owne, And Pauline whose great zeale, was by his Preaching showne. The first to Abbots state, wise Austen did preferre, And to the latter gave the See of Rochester; All canoniz'd for Saints, as worthy sure they were, For establishing the Faith, which was received here. Few Countries where our Christ had ere been preached then, But sent into this Ile some of their godly men. From Persia led by zeale, so Ive this Iland sought, And neere our Easterne Fennes a fit place finding, taught The Faith: which place from him the name alone derives, And of that sainted man since called is Saint-Ives; Such reverence to her selfe that time Devotion wan. So Sun-burnt Affrick sent us holy Adrian, Who preacht the Christian Faith here nine and thirtie yeere, An Abbot in this Isle, and to this Nation deare, That in our Countrey two Provinciall Synods cald, T'reforme the Church that time with Heresies enthrald. So Denmarke Henry sent t'encrease our holy store, Who falling in from thence upon our Northerne shore In th'Isle of An Islet upon the coast of Scotland, in the German Sea. Cochet liv'd, neere to the mouth of Tyne, In Fasting as in Prayer, a man so much divine, That onely thrice a weeke on homely cates he fed, And three times in the weeke himselfe he silenced, That in remembrance of this most abstenious man, How the name of Henry came so frequent among the English.Upon his blessed death the English men began, By him to name their Babes, which it so frequent brings, Which name hath honoured been by many English Kings. So Burgundy to us three men most reverent bare, Amongst our other Saints, that claime to have their share, Of which was Felix first, who in th'East-Saxon raigne, Converted to the faith King Sigbert: him againe Ensueth Anselme, whom Augusta sent us in, And Hugh, whose holy life, to Christ did many win, By Henry the second. Henry th'Empresse sonne holpe hither, and to have Him wholly to be ours, the See of Lincolne gave. So Lumbardy to us, our reverent Lanfranck lent, For whom into this land King William Conqueror sent, And Canterburies See to his wise charge assign'd. Nor France to these for hers was any whit behind, For Grimbald shee us gave (as Peter long before, Who with Saint Austen came, to preach upon this shore) By Alfred hither cald, who him an Abbot made, Who by his godly life, and preaching did perswade, The Saxons to beleeve the true and quickning word: So after long againe she likewise did afford, Saint Osmond, whom the See of Salsbury doth owne, A Bishop once of hers, and in our conquest knowne, When hither to that end their Norman William came, Remigius then, whose mind, that worke of ours of fame, Rich Lincolne Minster shewes, where he a Bishop sat, Which (it should seeme) he built for men to wonder at. So potent were the powers of Church-men in those dayes. Then Henry nam'd of Bloys, from France who crost the Seas, With Stephen Earle of Bloys his brother, after King, In Winchesters rich See, who him establishing, He in those troublous times in preaching tooke such paine, As he by them was not canonized in vaine. As other Countries here, their holy men bestow'd; So Britaine likewise sent her Saints to them abroad, Native English sent into forraine parts, canonized. And into neighbouring France, our most religious went, Saint Clare that native was of Rochester in Kent, At Volcasyne came vow'd the French instructing there, So early ere the truth amongst them did appeare, That more then halfe a God they thought that reverent man. Our Judock, so in France such fame our Nation wan, For holinesse, where long an Abbots life he led At Pontoyse, and so much was honoured, that being dead, And after threescore yeares (their latest period dated) His body taken up, was solemnly translated. As Ceofrid, that sometime of Wyremouth Abbot was, In his returne from Rome, as he through France did passe, At Langres left his life, whose holinesse even yet, Upon his reverent grave, in memory doth sit. Saint Alkwin so for ours, we English boast againe, The Tutor that became to mightie Charlemaigne, That holy man, whose heart was so with goodnesse fild, As out of zeale he wan that mightie King to build That Academy now at Paris, whose Foundation Through all the Christian world hath so renown'd that Nation, As well declares his wealth, that had the power to doe it, As his most lively zeale, perswading him unto it. As Simon cald the Saint of Burdeux, which so wrought, By preaching there the truth, that happily he brought The people of those parts, from Paganisme, wherein Their unbeleeving soules so long had nuzled bin. So in the Norman rule, two most religious were, Amongst ours that in France dispersed here and there, Preach'd to that Nation long, Saint Hugh, who borne our owne, In our first Henries rule sate on the See of Roan, Where reverenc'd he was long. Saint Edmund so againe, Who banished from hence in our third Henries raigne, There led an Hermits life neere Pontoyse, where before, Saint Judock did the like) whose honour to restore, Religious Lewes there interr'd with wondrous cost, Of whose rich Funerall France deservedly may boast. Then Main we adde to these, an Abbot here of ours, To little Britaine sent, imploying all his powers To bring them to the Faith, which he so well effected, That since he as a Saint hath ever been respected. As these of ours in France, so had wee those did show In Germany, as well the Higher, as the Low, Their Faith: In Freezeland first Saint Boniface our best, Who of the See of Mentz, whilst there he sate possest, At Dockum had his death, by faithlesse Frizians slaine, Whose Anniversaries there did after long remaine. So Wigbert full of faith, and heavenly wisedome went Unto the selfe same place, as with the same intent; With Eglemond a man as great with God as he; As they agreed in life, so did their ends agree, Both by Radbodius slaine, who ruld in Frizia then: So in the sacred roule of our Religious men, In Freeze that preach'd the faith we of Saint Lullus read, Who in the See of Mentz did Boniface succeed; And Willihad that of Bren, that sacred Seat supplide, So holy that him there, they halfely deifide; With Marchelme, and with him our Plechelme, holy men, That to the Freezes now, and to the Saxons then, In Germany abroad the glorious Gospell spread, Who at their lives depart, their bodies gathered, Were at old-Seell enshrin'd, their Obiits yearely kept: Such as on them have had as many praises heap'd, That in their lives the truth as constantly confest, As th'other that their Faith by Martyrdome exprest. In Freeze, as these of ours, their names did famous leave, Againe so had we those as much renown'd in Cleave; Saint Swibert, and with him Saint Willick, which from hence, To Cleeve-land held their way, and in the Truths defence Pawn'd their religious lives, and as they went together, So one and selfe same place allotted was to either: For both of them at Wert in Cleaveland seated were, Saint Swibert Bishop was, Saint Willick Abbot there. So Guelderland againe shall our most holy bring, As Edilbert the sonne of Edilbald the King Of our South-Saxon Rule, incessantly that taught The Guelders, whose blest dayes unto their period brought, Unto his reverent Corpse, old Harlem harbour gave; So Werenfrid againe, and Otger both we have, Who to those people preach'd, whose praise that country tells. What Nation names a Saint, for vertue that excels Saint German who for Christ his Bishoprick forsooke, And in the Netherlands most humbly him betooke, From place to place to passe, the secrets to reveale, Of our deare Saviours death, and last of all to seale His doctrine with his blood: In Belgia so abroad, Saint Wynock in like sort, his blessed time bestow'd, Whose reliques Wormshault (yet) in Flanders hath reserv'd. Of these, th'rebellious flesh (to winne them heaven) that starv'd, Saint Menigold, a man, who in his youth had beene A Souldier, and the French, and German warres had seene, A Hermit last became, his sinfull soule to save, To whom good Arnulph, that most godly Emperour gave Some ground not farre from Leedge, his Hermitage to set, Whose floore when with his teares, he many a day had wet, He for the Christian faith upon the same was slaine: So did th'Erwaldi there most worthily attaine Their Martyrs glorious Types, to Ireland first approov'd, But after (in their zeale) as need requir'd remoov'd, They to Westphalia went, and as they brothers were, So they, the Christian faith together preaching there, Th'old Pagan Saxons slew, out of their hatred deepe To the true Faith, whose shrines brave Cullen still doth keepe. So Adler one of ours, by England set apart For Germany, and sent that people to convert, Of Erford Bishop made, there also had his end. Saint Liphard likewise to our Martyraloge shall lend, Who having been at Rome on Pilgrimage, to see The Reliques of the Saints, supposed there to bee, Returning by the way of Germany, at last, Preaching the Christian faith, as he through Cambray past, The Pagan people slew, whose Reliques Huncourt hath; These others so we had, which trode the selfe same path In Germany, which shee most reverently imbrac'd. Saint John a man of ours, on Salzburgs See was plac'd; Saint Willibald of Eist the Bishop so became, And Burchard English borne, the man most great of name, Of Witzburg Bishop was, at Hohemburg that reard The Monastery, wherein he richly was interd. So Mastreight unto her Saint Willibord did call, And seated him upon her See Episcopall, As two Saint Lebwins there amongst the rest are brought; Th'one o'r Isells banks the ancient Saxons taught: At over Isell rests, the other did apply, The Gueldres, and by them interd at Deventry. Saint Wynibald againe, at Hidlemayne enjoy'd The Abbacy, in which his godly time employ'd In their Conversion there, which long time him withstood. Saint Gregory then, with us sprung of the Royall blood, And sonne to him whom we the elder Edward stile, Both Court and Country left, which he esteemed vile, Which Germany receav'd, where he at Myniard led A strict Monastick life, a Saint alive and dead. So had we some of ours for Italy were prest, As well as these before, sent out into the East. King Inas having done so great and wondrous things, As well might be suppos'd the works of sundry Kings, Erecting beautious Phanes, and Monuments so faire, As Monarchs have not since beene able to repaire, Of many that he built, the least, in time when they Have (by weake mens neglect) been falne into decay: This Realme by him enrich'd, he povertie profest, In Pilgrimage to Rome, where meekly he deceast. As Richard the deare sonne to Lothar King of Kent, When he his happy dayes religiously had spent; And feeling the approch of his declining age, Desirous to see Rome in holy Pilgrimage, Into thy Country com'n at Leuca, left his life, Whose myracles there done, yet to this day are rife. The Patron of that place, so Thuscany in thee, At faire Mount-flascon still the memory shall bee Of holy Thomas there most reverently interd, Who sometime to the See of Hereford preferd; Thence travailing to Rome, in his returne bereft His life by sicknesse, there to thee his body left. Yet Italy gave not these honors all to them That visited her Rome, but from Jerusalem, Some comming back through thee, and yeelding up their spirits, On thy rich earth receiv'd their most deserved merits. O Naples, as thine owne, in thy large Territory, Though to our Countries praise, yet to thy greater glory, Even to this day the Shrines religiously dost keepe, Of many a blessed Saint which in thy lap doth sleepe! As Eleutherius, com'n from visiting the Tombe, Thou gav'st to him at Arke in thy Apulia roome To set his holy Cell, where he an Hermite dy'd, Canonized her Saint; so hast thou glorifide Saint Gerrard, one of ours, (above the former grac'd) In such a sumptuous Shrine at Galinaro plac'd; At Sancto Padre so, Saint Fulke hath ever fame, Which from that reverent man 't should seeme deriv'd the name, His Reliques there reserv'd; so holy Ardwins Shrine Is at Ceprano kept, and honoured as divine, For Myracles, that there by his strong faith were wrought. Mongst these selected men, the Sepulchre that sought, And in thy Realme arriv'd, their blessed soules resign'd: Our Bernards body yet at Arpine we may find, Untill this present time, her patronizing Saint. So Countries more remote, with ours we did acquaint, As Richard for the fame his holinesse had wonne, And for the wondrous things that through his Prayers were done, From this his native home into Calabria cald, And of Saint Andrewes there the Bishop was instauld, For whom shee hath profest much reverence to this land: Saint William with this man, a paralell may stand, Through all the Christian world accounted so divine, That travelling from hence to holy Palestine, Desirous that most blest Jerusalem to see, (In which the Saviours selfe so oft vouchsaft to be) Priour of that holy house by Suffrages related, To th'Sepulchre of Christ, which there was dedicated; To Tyre in Syria thence remov'd in little space, And in lesse time ordain'd Archbishop of that place; That God inspired man, with heavenly goodnesse fild, A Saint amongst the rest deservedly is held. Yet Italy, nor France, nor Germany, those times Imployd not all our men, but into colder Clymes, They wandred through the world, their Countries that forsooke. So Sigfrid sent from hence, devoutly undertooke Those Pagans wild and rude, of Gothia to convert, Who having laboured long, with danger oft ingirt, Was in his reverent age for his deserved fee, By Olaus King of Goths, set on Vexovia's See. To Norway, and to those great North-East Countries farre; So Gotebald gave himselfe holding a Christian warre With Paynims, nothing else but Heathenish Rites that knew. As Suethia to her selfe these men most reverent drew, Saint Ulfrid of our Saints, as famous there as any, Nor scarcely find we one converting there so many. And Henry in those dayes of Oxsto Bishop made, The first that Swethen King, which ever did perswade, On Finland to make warre, to force them by the sword, When nothing else could serve to heare the powerfull word; With Eskill thither sent, to teach that barbarous Nation, Who on the Passion day, there preaching on the Passion, T'expresse the Saviours love to mankind, taking paine, By cruell Paynims hands was in the Pulpit slaine, Upon that blessed day Christ dyed for sinfull man, Upon that day for Christ, his Martyrs Crowne he wan. So David drawne from hence into those farther parts, By preaching, who to pearce those Paynims hardned hearts, Incessantly proclaim'd Christ Jesus, with a crie Against their Heathen gods, and blind Idolatry. Into those colder Clymes to people beastly rude, So others that were ours couragiously pursude, The planting of the Truth, in zeale three most profound, The relish of whose names by likelinesse of sound, Both in their lives and deaths, a likelinesse might show, As Unaman we name, and Shunaman that goe, With Wynaman their friend, which martyred gladly were In Gothland, whilst they taught with Christian patience there. Nor those from us that went, nor those that hither came From the remotest parts, were greater yet in name, Then those residing here on many a goodly See, (Great Bishops in account, now greater Saints that be) Some such selected ones for pietie and zeale, As to the wretched world, more clearely could reveale, How much there might of God in mortall man be found In charitable workes, or such as did abound, Which by their good successe in aftertimes were blest, Were then related Saints, as worthier then the rest. Of Canterbury here with those I will begin, Bishops of this land canonized Saints. That first Archbishops See, on which there long hath bin So many men devout, as rais'd that Church so high, Much reverence, and have wonne their holy Hierarchy: Of which he first that did with goodnesse so inflame The hearts of the devout (that from his proper name) As one (even) sent from God, the soules of men to save The title unto him, of Deodat they gave. The Bishops Brightwald next, and Tatwin in we take, Whom time may say, that Saints it worthily did make Succeeding in that See directly even as they, Here by the Muse are plac'd, who spent both night and day By doctrine, or by deeds, instructing, doing good, In raising them were falne, or strengthening them that stood. Then Odo the Severe, who highly did adorne That See, (yet being of unchristened parents borne, Whose Country Denmarke was, but in East England dwelt) He being but a child, in his cleere bosome felt The most undoubted truth, and yet unbaptiz'd long; But as he grew in yeares, in spirit so growing strong: And as the Christian faith this holy man had taught, He likewise for that Faith in Sundry battels fought. So Dunstan as the rest arose through many Sees, To this Arch-type at last ascending by degrees, There by his power confirm'd, and strongly credit wonne, To many wondrous things, which he before had done. To whom when (as they say) the Devill once appear'd, This man so full of faith, not once at all afeard, Strong conflicts with him had, in myracles most great. As Egelnoth againe much grac'd that sacred seat, Who for his godly deeds surnamed was the Good, Not boasting of his birth, though com'n of Royall blood: For that, nor at the first, a Monkes meane Cowle despis'd, With winning men to God, who never was suffic'd. These men before exprest; so Eadsine next ensues, To propagate the truth, no toyle that did refuse; In Haralds time who liv'd, when William Conqueror came, For holinesse of life, attain'd unto that fame, That Souldiers fierce and rude, that pitty never knew, Were suddenly made mild, as changed in his view. This man with those before, most worthily related Arch-saints, as in their Sees Arch-bishops consecrated. Saint Thomas Becket then, which Rome so much did hery, As to his Christned name it added Canterbury; There to whose sumptuous Shrine the neere succeeding ages, So mighty offrings sent, and made such Pilgrimages, Concerning whom, the world since then hath spent much breath, And many questions made both of his life and death: If he were truely just, he hath his right; if no, Those times were much to blame, that have him reckond so. Then these from Yorke ensue, whose lives as much have grac'd That See, as these before in Canterbury plac'd: Saint Wilfrid of her Saints, we then the first will bring, Who twice by Egfrids ire, the sterne Northumbrian King, Expulst his sacred Seat, most patiently it bare, The man for sacred gifts almost beyond compare. Then Bosa next to him as meeke and humble hearted, As the other full of grace, to whom great God imparted His mercies sundry wayes, as age upon him came. And next him followeth John, who likewise bare the name, Of Beverley, where he most happily was borne, Whose holinesse did much his native place adorne, Whose Vigils had by those devouter times bequests The Ceremonies due to great and solemne Feasts. So Oswald of that seat, and Cedwall sainted were, Both reverenc'd and renown'd Archbishops, living there The former to that See, from Worcester transfer'd, Deceased, was againe at Worcester inter'd: The other in that See a sepucher they chose, And did for his great zeale amongst the Saints dispose, As William by descent com'n of the Conquerors straine, Whom Stephen ruling here did in his time ordaine Archbishop of that See, among our Saints doth fall, Deriv'd from those two Seats, styld Archiepiscopall. Next these Arch-Sees of ours, now London place doth take, Which had those, of whom time Saints worthily did make. As Ceda, (brother to that reverent Bishop Chad, At Lichfield in those times, his famous seat that had) Is Sainted for that See amongst our reverent men, From London though at length remoov'd to Lestingen, A monastery, which then he richly had begun. Him Erkenwald ensues th'East English Offa's sonne, His fathers kingly Court, who for a Crosiar fled, Whose works such fame him wonne for holinesse, that dead, Time him enshrin'd in Pauls, (the mother of that See) Which with Revenues large, and Priviledges he Had wondrously endow'd; to goodnesse so affected, That he those Abbayes great, from his owne power erected At Chertsey neere to Thames, and Barking famous long. So Roger hath a roome in these our Sainted throng, Who by his words and works so taught the way to heaven, As that great name to him sure was not vainely given. With Winchester againe proceed we, which shall store Us with as many Saints, as any See (or more) Of whom we yet have sung, (as Heada there we have) Who by his godly life, so good instructions gave, As teaching that the way to make men to live well, Example us assur'd, did Preaching farre excell. Our Swithen then ensues, of him why ours I say, Is that upon his Feast, his dedicated day, As it in Harvest haps, so Plow-men note thereby, Th'ensuing fortie dayes be either wet or dry, As that day falleth out, whose Myracles may wee Beleeve those former times, he well might sainted bee. So Frithstan for a Saint incalendred we find, With Brithstan not a whit the holyest man behind, Canoniz'd, of which two, the former for respect Of vertues in him found, the latter did elect To sit upon his See, who likewise dying there, To Ethelbald againe succeeding did appeare, The honour to a Saint, as challenging his due. These formerly exprest, then Elpheg doth ensue; Then Ethelwald, of whom this Almes-deed hath been told, That in a time of dearth his Churches plate he sold, T'releeve the needy poore; the Churches wealth (quoth he) May be againe repayr'd, but so these cannot be. With these before exprest, so Britwald forth she brought, By faith and earnest prayer his myracles that wrought, That such against the Faith, that were most stony-hearted, By his religious life, have lastly been converted. This man, when as our Kings so much decayed were, As 'twas suppos'd their Line would be extinguisht here, Had in his Dreame reveald, to whom All-doing heaven, The Scepter of this land in after-times had given; Which in Prophettick sort by him delivered was, And as he stoutly spake, it truly came to passe. So other Southerne Sees, here either lesse or more, Have likewise had their Saints, though not alike in store. Of Rochester, we have Saint Ithamar, being then In those first times, first of our native English men Residing on that Seat; so as an ayd to her, But singly Sainted thus, we have of Chichester, Saint Richard, and with him Saint Gilbert, which doe stand Enrold amongst the rest of this our Mytred Band, Of whom such wondrous things, for truths delivered are, As now may seeme to stretch our strait beleefe too farre. And Cimbert, of a Saint had the deserved right, His yearely Obiits long, done in the Isle of Wight; A Bishop, as some say, but certaine of what See, It scarcely can be proov'd, nor is it knowne to me. Whilst Sherburne was a See, and in her glory shone, And Bodmin likewise had a Bishop of her owne, Whose Diocesse that time contained Cornwall; these Had as the rest their Saints, derived from their Sees: The first, her Adelme had, and Hamond, and the last Had Patrock, for a Saint that with the other past; That were it fit for us but to examine now Those former times, these men for Saints that did allow, And from our reading urge, that others might as well Related be for Saints, as worthy every deale. This scruteny of ours, would cleere that world thereby, And shew it to be voyd of partiality, That each man holy cald, was not canoniz'd here, But such whose lives by death had triall many a yeere. That See at Norwich now establisht (long not stird) At Eltham planted first, to Norwich then transferd Into our bedroule here, her Humbert in doth bring, (A Counsellour that was to that most martyred King Saint Edmund) who in their rude massacre then slaine, The title of a Saint, his Martyrdome doth gaine. So Hereford hath had on her Cathedrall Seat, Saint Leofgar, a man by Martyrdome made great, Whom Griffith Prince of Wales, that Towne which did subdue, (O most unhallowed deed) unmercifully slue. So Worster, (as those Sees here sung by us before) Hath likewise with her Saints renown'd our native shore: Saint Egwin as her eld'st, with Woolstan as the other, Of whom she may be proud, to say shee was the Mother, The Churches Champions both, for her that stoutly stood. Lichfield hath those no whit lesse famous, nor lesse good: The first of whom is that most reverent Bishop Chad, In those religious times for holinesse that had, The name above the best that lived in those dayes, That Stories have been stuft with his abundant praise; Who on the See of Yorke being formerly instauld, Yet when backe to that place Saint Wilfrid was recald, The Seat to that good man he willingly resign'd, And to the quiet Closse of Lichfield him confin'd. So Sexulfe after him, then Owen did supply, Her Trine of reverent men, renown'd for sanctitie. As Lincolne to the Saints, our Robert Grosted lent, A perfect godly man, most learn'd and eloquent, Then whom no Bishop yet walkt in more upright wayes, Who durst reproove proud Rome, in her most prosperous dayes, Whose life, of that next age the Justice well did show, Which we may boldly say, for this we clearely know, Had Innocent the fourth the Churches Suffrage led, This man could not at Rome have been Canonized. Her sainted Bishop John, so Ely addes to these, Yet never any one of all our severall Sees Northumberland like thine, have to these times been blest, Which sent into this Isle so many men profest, Whilst Hagustald had then a Mother-Churches stile, And Lindisferne of us now cald the Holy-Ile, Was then a See before that Durham was so great, And long ere Carleill came to be a Bishops seat. Aidan, and Finan both, most happily were found Northumberland in thee, even whilst thou didst abound With Paganisme, which them thy Oswin that good King, His people to convert did in from Scotland bring: As Etta likewise hers, from Malrorse that arose, Being Abbot of that place, whom the Northumbers chose The Bishopricke of Ferne, and Hagustald to hold. And Cuthbert of whose life such Myracles are told, As Storie scarcely can the truth thereof maintaine, Of th'old Scotch-Irish Kings descended from the straine, To whom since they belong, I from them here must swerve, And till I thither come, their holinesse reserve, Proceeding with the rest that on those Sees have showne, As Edbert after these borne naturally our owne. The next which in that See Saint Cuthbert did succeed, His Church then built of wood, and thatch'd with homely reed, He builded up of stone, and covered fayre with Lead, Who in Saint Cuthberts Grave they buried being dead, As his sad people he at his departing wild. So Higbald after him a Saint is likewise held, Who when his proper See, as all the Northren Shore, Were by the Danes destroyd, he not dismayd the more, But making shift to get out of the cruell flame, His Cleargie carrying foorth, preach'd wheresoere he came. And Alwyn who the Church at Durham now, begun, Which place before that time was strangely overrun With shrubs, and men for corne that plot had lately eard, Where he that goodly Phane to after ages reard, And thither his late Seat from An Isle neere to Scotland, lying into the German Ocean, since that called Holy Iland, as you may read in the next page following. Lindisferne translated, Which his Cathedrall Church by him was consecrated. So Acca we account mongst those which have been cald The Saints of this our See, which sate at Hagenstald, Of which he Bishop was, in that good age respected, In Calenders preserv'd, in th'Catalogues neglected, Which since would seeme to shew the Bishops as they came: Then Edilwald, which some (since) Ethelwoolph doe name, At Durham by some men supposed to reside More rightly, but by some at Carleill justifide, The first which rul'd that See, which Henry the first. Beauclerke did preferre, Much gracing him, who was his only Confessor. Nor were they Bishops thus related Saints alone; Northumberland, but thou (besides) hast many a one, Religious Abbots, Priests, and holy Hermits then, Canonized as well as thy great Mytred men: Two famous Abbots first are in the ranke of these, Whose Abbayes touch'd the walls of thy two ancient Seas. Thy Roysill (in his time the tutillage that had Of Cuthbert that great Saint, whose hopes then but a lad, Exprest in riper yeares how greatly he might merit) The man who had from God a prophesying Spirit, Foretelling many things; and growing to be old, His very hower of death, was by an Angell told. At Malroyes this good man his Sainting well did earne, Saint Oswald his againe at holy Lindisferne, With Ive a godly Priest, supposd to have his lere Of Cuthbert, and with him was Herbert likewise there His fellow-pupill long, (who as mine Authour saith) So great opinion had, of Cuthbert and his faith, That at one time and place, he with that holy man, Desir'd of God to dye, which by his prayer he wan. Our venerable Bede so forth that Country brought, And worthily so nam'd, who of those ages sought The truth to understand, impartially which he Delivered hath to time, in his Records that we, Things left so farre behind, before us still may read, Mongst our canoniz'd sort, who called is Saint Bede. A sort of Hermits then, by thee to light are brought, Who liv'd by Almes, and Prayer, the world respecting nought. Our Edilwald the Priest, in Ferne (now holy Ile) Which standeth from the firme to Sea nine English mile, Sate in his reverent Cell, as Godrick thou canst show; His head and beard as white as Swan or driven Snow, At Finchall threescore yeeres, a Hermits life to lead; Their solitary way in thee did Alrick tread, Who in a Forrest neere to Carleill, in his age, Bequeath'd himselfe to his more quiet Hermitage. Of Wilgusse, so in thee Northumberland we tell, Whose most religious life hath merited so well, (Whose blood thou boasts to be of thy most royall straine) That Alkwin, Master to that mightie Charlemaigne, In Verse his Legend writ, who of our holy men, He him the subject chose for his most learned pen. So Oswyn, one of thy deare Country thou canst show, To whom as for the rest for him we likewise owe Much honour to thy earth, this godly man that gave, Whose Reliques that great house of Lesting long did save, To sinders till it sanke: so Benedict by thee, We have amongst the rest, for Saints that reckoned bee, Of Wyremouth worship'd long, her Patron buried there, In that most goodly Church, which he himselfe did reare. Saint Thomas so to us Northumberland thou lent'st, Whom up into the South, thou from his Country sent'st; For sanctitie of life, a man exceeding rare, Who since that of his name so many Saints there are, This man from others more, that times might understand, They to his christened name added Northumberland. Nor in one Country thus our Saints confined were, But through this famous Isle dispersed here and there: As Yorkshire sent us in Saint Robert to our store, At Knarsborough most knowne, whereas he long before His blessed time bestowd; then one as just as he, (If credit to those times attributed may be) Saint Richard with the rest deserving well a roome, Which in that Country once, at Hampoole had a toombe. Religious Alred so, from Rydall we receive, The Abbot, who to all posteritie did leave, The fruits of his staid faith, delivered by his Pen. Not of the least desert amongst our holiest men, One Eusac then we had, but where his life he led, That doubt I, but am sure he was Canonized, And was an Abbot too, for sanctity much fam'd. Then Woolsey will we bring, of Westminster so nam'd, And by that title knowne, in power and goodnesse great; And meriting as well his Sainting, as his Seat. So have we found three Johns, of sundry places here, Of which (three reverent men) two famous Abbots were. The first Saint Albans shew'd, the second Lewes had, Another godly John we to these former add, To make them up a Trine, (the name of Saints that wonn) Who was a Yorkshire man, and Prior of Berlington. So Biren can we boast, a man most highly blest With the title of a Saint, whose ashes long did rest At Dorchester, where he was honoured many a day; But of the place he held, books diversly dare say, As they of Gilbert doe, who founded those Divines, Monasticks all that were, of him nam'd Gilbertines: To which his Order here, he thirteene houses built, When that most thankfull time, to shew he had not spilt His wealth on it in vaine, a Saint hath made him here, At Sempringham enshrin'd, a towne of Lincolneshire. Of sainted Hermits then, a company we have, To whom devouter times this veneration gave: As Gwir in Cornwall kept his solitary Cage, And Neoth by Hunstock there, his holy Hermitage, As Guthlake, from his youth, who liv'd a Souldier long, Detesting the rude spoyles, done by the armed throng, The mad tumultuous world contemptibly forsooke, And to his quiet Cell by Crowland him betooke, Free from all publique crowds, in that low Fenny ground. As Bertiline againe, was neere to Stafford found: Then in a Forrest there, for solitude most fit, Blest in a Hermits life, by there enjoying it. An Hermit Arnulph so in Bedfordshire became, A man austere of life, in honour of whose name, Time after built a Towne, where this good man did live, And did to it the name of Arnulphsbury give. These men, this wicked world respected not a hayre, But true Professors were of povertie and prayer. Amongst these men which times have honoured with the Stile Of Confessors, (made Saints) so every little while, Our Martyrs have com'n in, who sealed with their blood, That faith which th'other preach'd, gainst them that it withstood; As Alnoth, who had liv'd a Herdsman, left his Seat, Though in the quiet fields, whereas he kept his Neat, And leaving that his Charge, he left the world withall, An Anchorite and became, within a Cloystred wall, Inclosing up himselfe, in prayer to spend his breath, But was too soone (alas) by Pagans put to death. Then Woolstan, one of these, by his owne kinsman slaine At Evsham, for that he did zealously maintaine The veritie of Christ. As Thomas, whom we call Of Dover, adding Monke, and Martyr therewithall; For that the barbarous Danes he bravely did withstand, From ransacking the Church, when here they put on land, By them was done to death, which rather he did chuse, Then see their Heathen hands those holy things abuse. Two Boyes of tender age, those elder Saints ensue, Of Norwich William was, of Lincolne little Hugh, Whom th'unbeleeving Jewes (rebellious that abide) In mockery of our Christ at Easter crucifi'd, Those times would every one should their due honour have, His freedome or his life, for Jesus Christ that gave. So Wiltshire with the rest her Hermit Ulfrick hath Related for a Saint, so famous in the Faith, That sundry ages since, his Cell have sought to find, At Hasselburg, who had his Obiits him assign'd. Saxon Kings canonized for Saints.So had we many Kings most holy here at home, As men of meaner ranke, which have attaind that roome: Northumberland, thy seat with Saints did us supply Of thy religious Kings; of which high Hierarchy Was Edwin, for the Faith by Heathenish hands inthrald, Whom Penda which to him the Welsh Cadwallyn cald, Without all mercy slew: But he alone not dide By that proud Mercian King, but Penda yet beside, Just Oswald likewise slew, at Oswaldstree, who gave That name unto that place, as though time meant to save His memory thereby, there suffring for the Faith, As one whose life deserv'd that memory in death. So likewise in the Roule of these Northumbrian Kings, With those that Martyrs were, so foorth that Country brings Th'annoynted Oswin next, in Deira to ensue, Whom Osway that bruit King of wild Bernitia slue: Two kingdomes, which whilst then Northumberland remain'd In greatnesse, were within her larger bounds contain'd; This Kingly Martyr so, a Saint was rightly crown'd. As Alkmond one of hers for sanctity renown'd, King Alreds Christned sonne, a most religious Prince, Whom when the Heathenish here by no meanes could convince, (Their Paganisme a pace declining to the wane) At Darby put to death, whom in a goodly Phane, Cald by his glorious name, his corpse the Christians layd. What fame deserv'd your faith, (were it but rightly wayd) You pious Princes then, in godlinesse so great; Why should not full-mouthd Fame your praises oft repeat? So Ethelwolph her King, Northumbria notes againe, In Martyrdome the next, though not the next in raigne, Whom his false Subjects slue, for that he did deface The Heathenish Saxon gods, and bound them to embrace The lively quickning Faith, which then began to spread. So for our Saviour Christ, as these were martyred: There other holy Kings were likewise, who confest, Which those most zealous times have Sainted with the rest, King Alfred that his Christ he might more surely hold, Left his Northumbrian Crowne, and soone became encould, At Malroyse, in the land, whereof he had been King. So Egbert to that Prince, a Paralell we bring, To Oswoolph his next heire, his kingdome that resign'd, And presently himselfe at Lindisferne confin'd, Contemning Courtly state, which earthly fooles adore: So Ceonulph againe as this had done before, In that religious house, a cloystred man became, Which many a blessed Saint hath honoured with the name. Nor those Northumbrian Kings the onely Martyrs were, That in this seven-fold Rule the scepters once did beare, But that the Mercian raigne, which Pagan Princes long, Did terribly infest, had some her Lords among, To the true Christian Faith much reverence which did add Our Martyrologe to helpe: so happily shee had Rufin, and Ulfad, sonnes to Wulphere, for desire They had t'imbrace the Faith, by their most cruell Sire Were without pittie slaine, long ere to manhood growne, Whose tender bodies had their burying Rites at A Towne in Staffordshire. Stone. So Kenelme, that the King of Mercia should have beene, Before his first seven yeares he fully out had seene, Was slaine by his owne Guard, for feare lest waxing old, That he the Christian Faith undoubtedly would hold. So long it was ere truth could Paganisme expell. Then Fremund, Offa's sonne, of whom times long did tell, Such wonders of his life and sanctitie, who fled His fathers kingly Court, and after meekly led An Hermits life in Wales, where long he did remaine In Penitence and prayer, till after he was slaine By cruell Oswayes hands, the most inveterate foe, The Christian faith here found: so Etheldred shall goe With these our martyred Saints, though onely he confest, Since he of Mercia was, a King who highly blest, Faire Bardney, where his life religiously he spent, And meditating Christ, thence to his Saviour went. Nor our West-Saxon raigne was any whit behind Those of the other rules (their best) whose zeale wee find, Amongst those sainted Kings, whose fames are safeliest kept; As Cedwall, on whose head such praise all times have heapt, That from a Heathen Prince, a holy Pilgrim turn'd, Repenting in his heart against the truth t'have spurn'd, To Rome on his bare feet his patience exercis'd, And in the Christian faith there humbly was baptiz'd. So Ethelwoolph, who sat on Cedwalls ancient Seat, For charitable deeds, who almost was as great, As any English King, at Winchester enshrin'd, A man amongst our Saints, most worthily devin'd. Two other Kings as much our Martyrologe may sted, Saint Edward, and with him comes in Saint Ethelred, By Alfreda, the first, his Stepmother was slaine, That her most loved sonne young Ethelbert might raigne: The other in a storme, and deluge of the Dane, For that he Christned was, receav'd his deadly bane; Both which with wondrous cost, the English did interre, At Wynburne this first Saint, the last at Winchester, Where that West-Saxon Prince, good Alfred buried was Among our Sainted Kings, that well deserves to passe. Nor were these Westerne Kings of the old Saxon straine, More studious in those times, or stoutlier did maintaine The truth, then these of ours, the Angles of the East, Their neer'st and deer'st Allies, which strongly did invest The A people of the Saxons, who gave the name to England, of Angles land. Island with their name, of whose most holy Kings, Which justly have deserv'd their high Canonizings, Are Sigfrid, whose deare death him worthily hath crownd, And Edmund in his end, so wondrously renownd, Saint Edmundsbury.For Christs sake suffring death, by that blood-drowning Dane, To whom those times first built that Citie and that Phane, Whose ruines Suffolke yet can to her glory show, When shee will have the world of her past greatnesse know. As Ethelbert againe alur'd with the report Of more then earthly pompe, then in the Mercian Court, From the East-Angles went, whilst mighty Offa raign'd; Where, for he christned was, and Christian-like abstain'd To Idolatrize with them, fierce Quenred, Offa's Queene Most treacherously him slew out of th'inveterate spleene Shee bare unto the Faith, whom we a Saint adore. So Edwald brother to Saint Edmund, sung before, A Confessor we call, whom past times did interre, At Dorcester by Tame, (now in our Calender.) Amongst those kingdomes here, so Kent account shall yeeld Of three of her best blood, who in this Christian Field Were mighty, of the which, King Ethelbert shall stand The first; who having brought Saint Augustine to land, Himselfe first christned was, by whose example then, The Faith grew after strong amongst his Kentishmen. As Ethelbrit againe, and Ethelred his pheere, To Edbald King of Kent, who naturall Nephewes were, For Christ there suffring death, assume them places hye, Amongst our martyred Saints, commemorate at Wye. To these two brothers, so two others come againe, And of as great discent in the Southsexian straine: Arwaldi of one name, whom ere King Cedwall knew The true and lively Faith, he tyranously slew: Who still amongst the Saints have their deserved right, Whose Vigils were observ'd (long) in the Isle of Wight. Remembred too the more, for being of one name, As of th'East-Saxon line, King Sebba so became A most religious Monke, at London, where he led A strict retyred life, a Saint alive and dead. Related for the like, so Edgar we admit, That King, who over eight did soly Monarch sit, And with our holyest Saints for his endowments great, Bestow'd upon the Church. With him we likewise seat That sumptuous shrined King, good Edward, from the rest Of that renowned name, by Confessor exprest. To these our sainted Kings, remembred in our Song, Holy women Canonized Saints. Those Mayds and widdowed Queenes, doe worthily belong, Incloystred that became, and had the selfe same style, For Fasting, Almes, and Prayer, renowned in our Isle, As those that foorth to France, and Germany we gave, For holy charges there; but here first let us have Our Mayd-made-Saints at home, as Hilderlie, with her We Theorid thinke most fit, for whom those times averre, A Virgin strictlyer vow'd, hath hardly lived here. Saint Wulfshild then we bring, all which of Barking were, And reckoned for the best, which most that house did grace, The last of which was long the Abbesse of that place. So Werburg, Wulpheres child, (of Mercia that had been A persecuting King) by Ermineld his Queene, At Ely honoured is, where her deare mother late, A Recluse had remain'd, in her sole widdowed state: Of which good Audry was King Ina's daughter bright, Reflecting on those times so cleare a Vestall light, As many a Virgin-breast she fired with her zeale, The fruits of whose strong faith, to ages still reveale The glory of those times, by liberties she gave, Saint Audries Liberties.By which those Easterne Shires their Priviledges have. Of holy Audries too, a sister here we have, Saint Withburg, who her selfe to Contemplation gave, At Deerham in her Cell, where her due howres she kept, Whose death with many a teare in Norfolke was bewept. And in that Isle againe, which beareth Elies name, At Ramsey, Merwin so a Vayled Mayd became Amongst our Virgin-Saints, where Elfled is enrold, The daughter that is nam'd of noble Ethelwold, A great East-Anglian Earle, of Ramsey Abbas long, So of our Mayden-Saints, the Female sex among. With Milburg, Mildred comes, and Milwid, daughters deere, To Mervald, who did then the Mercian Scepter beare. At Wenlock, Milburg dy'd, (a most religious mayd) Of which great Abbay shee the first foundation layd: And Thanet as her Saint (even to this age) doth herye Her Mildred. Milwid was the like at Canterbury. Nor in this utmost Isle of Thanet may we passe, Saint Eadburg Abbesse there, who the deare daughter was, To Ethelbert her Lord, and Kents first Christened King, Who in this place most fitst we with the former bring, Translated (as some say) to Flanders: but that I, As doubtfull of the truth, here dare not justifie. King Edgars sister so, Saint Edith, place may have With these our Maiden-Saints, who to her Powlsworth gave Immunities most large, and goodly livings layd. Which Modwen, long before, a holy Irish mayd, Had founded in that place, with most devout intent. As Eanswine, Eadwalds child, one of the Kings of Kent, At Foulkston found a place (given by her father there) In which she gave her selfe to abstinence and prayer. Of the West-Saxon rule, borne to three severall Kings, Foure holy Virgins more the Muse in order brings: Saint Ethelgive the child to Alfred, which we find, Those more devouter times at Shaftsbury enshrin'd. Then Tetta in we take, at Winburne on our way, Which Cuthreds sister was, who in those times did sway On the West-Saxon Seat, two other sacred Mayds, As from their Cradels vow'd to bidding of their beads. Saint Cuthburg, and with her Saint Quinburg, which we here Succeedingly doe set, both as they Sisters were, And Abbesses againe of Wilton, which we gather, Our Virgin-Band to grace, both having to their father Religious Ina, red with those which ruld the West, Whose mothers sacred wombe with other Saints was blest, As after shall be shew'd: an other Virgin vow'd, And likewise for a Saint amongst the rest allow'd; To th'elder Edward borne, bright Eadburg, who for she, (As five related Saints of that blest name there be) Of Wilton Abbasse was, they her of Wilton styl'd: Was ever any Mayd more mercifull, more mild, Or sanctimonious knowne: But Muse, on in our Song, With other princely Mayds, but first with those that sprung From Penda, that great King of Mercia; holy Tweed, And Kinisdred, with these their sisters, Kinisweed, And Eadburg, last not least, at Godmanchester all Incloystred; and to these Saint Tibba let us call, In solitude to Christ, that set her whole delight, In Godmanchester made a constant Anchorite. Amongst which of that house, for Saints that reckoned be, Yet never any one more grac'd the same then she. Deriv'd of royall Blood, as th'other Elfled than Neece to that mighty King, our English Athelstan, At Glastenbury shrin'd; and one as great as shee, Being Edward Out-lawes child, a Mayd that liv'd to see The Conquerour enter here, Saint Christian (to us knowne) Whose life by her cleere name divinely was foreshowne. For holinesse of life, that as renowned were, And not lesse nobly borne, nor bred, produce we here; Saint Hilda, and Saint Hien, the first of noble name, At Strenshalt, tooke her vow, the other sister came To Colchester, and grac'd the rich Essexian shore: Whose Reliques many a day the world did there adore. And of our sainted Mayds, the number to supply, Of Eadburg we allow, sometime at Alsbury, To Redwald then a King of the East-Angles borne, A Votresse as sincere as shee thereto was sworne. Then Pandwine we produce, whom this our native Isle, As forraine parts much priz'd, and higher did instyle, The holyest English Mayd, whose Vigils long were held In Lincolneshire; yet not Saint Frideswid exceld, The Abbesse of an house in Oxford, of her kind The wonder; nor that place, could hope the like to find. Two sisters so we have, both to devotion plite, And worthily made Saints; the elder Margarite, Of Katsby Abbesse was, and Alice, as we read, Her sister on that seat, did happily succeed, At Abington, which first receiv'd their living breath. Then those Northumbrian Nymphs, all vayld, as full of Faith, That Country sent us in, t'increase our Virgin-Band, Faire Elfled, Oswalds child, King of Northumberland, At Strenshalt that was vaild. As mongst those many there, O Ebba, whose cleere fame, time never shall out-weare, At Coldingham, farre hence within that Country plac'd; The Abbesse, who to keepe thy vayled Virgins chast, Which else thou fearst the Danes would ravish, which possest This Isle; first of thy selfe and then of all the rest, The Nose and upper Lip from your fayre faces kerv'd, And from pollution so your hallowed house preserv'd. Which when the Danes perceiv'd, their hopes so farre deluded, Setting the house on fire, their Martyrdome concluded. As Leofron, whose faith with others rightly wayd, Shall shew her not out-match'd by any English Mayd: Who likewise when the Dane with persecution storm'd, She here a Martyrs part most gloriously perform'd. Two holy Mayds againe at Whitby were renown'd, Both Abbesses thereof, and Confessors are crown'd; Saint Ethelfrid, with her Saint Congill, as a payre Of Abbesses therein, the one of which by prayer The Wild-geese thence expeld, that Island which annoy'd, Wild geese falling downe, if they fly over the place. By which their grasse and graine was many times destroy'd, Which fall from off their wings, nor to the ayre can get From the forbidden place, till they be fully set. As these within this Isle in Cloysters were inclosd: So we our Virgins had to forraine parts exposd; As Eadburg, Ana's child, and Sethred borne our owne, Were Abbesses of Bridge, whose zeale to France was knowne: And Ercongate againe we likewise thither sent, (Which Ercombert begot, sometime a King of Kent) A Prioresse of that place; Burgundosora bare, At Evreux the chaste rule, all which renowned are In France, which as this Isle of them may freely boast, So Germany some grac'd, from this their native coast. Saint Walburg heere extract from th'royall English Line, Was in that Country made Abbesse of Heydentine. Saint Tecla to that place at Ochenford they chose: From Wynburne with the rest (in Dorsetshire) arose Chast Agatha, with her went Lioba along. From thence, two not the least these sacred Mayds among, At Biscopsen, by time encloystred and became. Saint Lewen so attayn'd an everliving name For Martyrdome, which shee at Wynokebergin wan, Mayds seeming in their Sex t'exceed the holyest man. Nor had our Virgins here for sanctitie the prize, But widdowed Queenes as well, that being godly wise, Forsaking second beds, the world with them forsooke, To strict retyred lives, and gladly them betooke To Abstinence and Prayer, and as sincerely liv'd. As when the Fates of life King Ethelwold depriv'd, That o'r the East-Angles raign'd, bright Heriswid his wife, Betaking her to lead a strait Monasticke life, Departing hence to France, receav'd the holy Vayle, And lived many a day incloystred there at Kale. Then Keneburg in this our Sainted front shall stand, To Alfred the lov'd wife, King of Northumberland, Daughter to Penda King of Mercia, who though he Himselfe most Heathenish were, yet liv'd that age to see Foure Virgins, and this Queene, his children, consecrated Of Godmanchester all, and after Saints related. As likewise of this Sex, with Saints that doth us store, Of the Northumbrian Line so have we many more; Saint Eanfled widdowed left, by Osway raigning there, At Strenshalt tooke her Vaile, as Ethelburg the pheere To Edwin, (rightly nam'd) the holy, which possest Northumbers sacred seat, her selfe that did invest At Lymming farre in Kent, which Country gave her breath. So Edeth as the rest after King Sethricks death, Which had the selfe same rule of Wilton Abbesse was, Where two West-Saxon Queenes for Saints shall likewise passe, Which in that selfe same house, Saint Edeth did succeed, Saint Ethelwid, which here put on her hallowed weed, King Alreds worthy wife, of Westsex; so againe Did Wilfrid, Edgars Queene, (so famous in his raigne) Then Eadburg, Ana's wife, received as the other, Who as a Saint her selfe, so likewise was she mother To two most holy Mayds, as we before have show'd At Wilton, (which we say) their happy time bestow'd, Though she of Barking was, a holy Nunne profest, Who in her husbands time, had raigned in the West: Th'East-Saxon Line againe, so others to us lent, As Sexburg sometime Queene to Ercombert of Kent, Though Ina's loved child, and Audryes sister knowne, Which Ely in those dayes did for her Abbesse owne. Nor to Saint Osith we lesse honour ought to give, King Sethreds widdowed Queene, who (when death did deprive Th'Essexian King of life) became enrould at Chich, Whose Shrine to her there built, the world did long enrich. Two holy Mercian Queenes so widdowed, Saints became, For sanctity much like, not much unlike in name. King Wulpheres widdowed Pheere, Queene Ermineld, whose life At Ely is renown'd, and Ermenburg, the wife To Mervald raigning there, a Saint may safely passe, Who to three Virgin-Saints the vertuous mother was, The remnant of her dayes, religiously that bare, Immonastred in Kent, where first she breath'd the ayre. King Edgars mother so, is for a Saint preferd, Queene Algyve, who (they say) at Shipston was interd. So Edward Outlawes wife, Saint Agatha, we bring, By Salomon begot, that great Hungarian King; Who when she saw the wrong to Edgar her deare sonne, By cruell Harold first, then by the Conquerour done, Depriv'd his rightfull crowne, no hope it to recover, A Vestall habite tooke, and gave the false world over. Saint Maud here not the least, though shee be set the last, And scarcely over-matcht by any that is past, Our Beauclearks Queene, and borne to Malcolme King of Scots, Whose sanctity was seene to wipe out all the spots Were laid upon her life, when shee her Cloyster fled, And chastly gave her selfe to her lov'd husbands bed, Whom likewise for a Saint those reverend ages chose, With whom we at this time our Catalogue will close. Now Rutland all this time, who held her highly wrong'd, That shee should for the Saints thus strangely be prolong'd, As that the Muse such time upon their praise should spend, Sent in her ambling Wash, faire Welland to attend At Stamford, which her Streame doth eas'ly overtake, Of whom her Mistresse Flood seemes wondrous much to make; For that she was alone the darling and delight Of Rutland, ravisht so with her beloved sight, As in her onely childs, a mothers heart may be: Wherefore that she the least, yet fruitfulst Shire should see, The honourable ranke shee had amongst the rest, The ever-labouring Muse her Beauties thus exprest. Love not thy selfe the lesse, although the least thou art, What thou in greatnesse wantst, wise Nature doth impart In goodnesse of thy soyle; and more delicious mould, Survaying all this Isle, the Sunne did nere behold. Bring forth that British Vale, and be it ne'r so rare, But Catmus with that Vale, for richnesse shall compare: What Forrest-Nymph is found, how brave so ere she be, But Lyfield shewes her selfe as brave a Nymph as shee? What River ever rose from Banke, or swelling Hill, Then Rutlands wandring Wash, a delicater Rill? Small Shire that can produce to thy proportion good, One Vale of speciall name, one Forrest, and one Flood. O Catmus, thou faire Vale, come on in Grasse and Corne, That Bever ne'r be sayd thy sister-hood to scorne, And let thy Ocham boast, to have no litle grace, That her the pleased Fates, did in thy bosome place, And Lyfield, as thou art a Forrest, live so free, That every Forrest-Nymph may praise the sports in thee. And downe to Wellands course, O Wash, runne ever cleere, To honour, and to be much honoured by this Shire. And here my Canto ends, which kept the Muse so long, That it may rather seeme a Volume, then a Song. The five and twentieth Song The Argument. Tow'rds Lincolnshire our Progresse layd, Wee through deepe Hollands Ditches wade, Fowling, and Fishing in the Fen; Then come wee next to Kestiven, And bringing Wytham to her fall, On Lindsey light wee last of all, Her Scite and Pleasures to attend, And with the Isle of Axholme end. Now in upon thy earth, rich Lincolnshire I straine, At Deeping, from whose Street, the plentious Ditches draine, Hemp-bearing Hollands Fen, at Spalding that doe fall Together in their Course, themselves as emptying all Into one generall Sewer, which seemeth to divide, Holland divided into two parts, the Lower, and the Higher. Low Holland from the High, which on their Easterne side Th'in-bending Ocean holds, from the Norfolcean lands, To their more Northern poynt, where The length of Holland by the Sea shore, from the coast of Norfolke to Wainfleet. Wainfleet drifted stands, Doe shoulder out those Seas, and Lindsey bids her stay, Because to that faire part, a challenge she doth lay. From fast and firmer Earth, whereon the Muse of late, Trod with a steady foot, now with a slower gate, Through The Description of the Washes. Quicksands, Beach, and Ouze, the Washes she must wade, Where Neptune every day doth powerfully invade The vast and queachy soyle, with Hosts of wallowing waves, From whose impetuous force, that who himselfe not saves, By swift and sudden flight, is swallowed by the deepe, When from the wrathfull Tydes the foming Surges sweepe, The Sands which lay all nak'd, to the wide heaven before, And turneth all to Sea, which was but lately Shore, From this our Southerne part of Holland, cal'd the Low, Where Crowlands ruines yet, (though almost buried) show Her mighty Founders power, yet his more Christian zeale, Shee by the Muses ayd, shall happily reveale Her sundry sorts of Fowle, from whose abundance she Above all other Tracts, may boast her selfe to be The Mistris, (and indeed) to sit without compare, And for no worthlesse soyle, should in her glory share, From her moyst seat of Flags, of Bulrushes and Reed, With her just proper praise, thus Holland doth proceed. Hollands Oration.Yee Acherusian Fens, to mine resigne your glory, Both that which lies within the goodly Territory Of Naples, as that Fen Thesposia's earth upon, Whence that infernall Flood, the smutted Acheron Shoves forth her sullen head, as thou most fatall Fen, Of which Hetruria tells, the watry Thrasimen, In History although thou highly seemst to boast, That Haniball by thee o'rthrew the Roman Host. I scorne th'Egyptian Fen, which Alexandria showes, Proud Mareotis, should my mightinesse oppose, Or Scythia, on whose face the Sunne doth hardly shine, Should her Meotis thinke to match with this of mine, That covered all with Snow continually doth stand. I stinking Lerna hate, and the poore Libian Sand. A Nymph supposed to have the charge of the Shore. Marica that wise Nymph, to whom great Neptune gave The charge of all his Shores, from drowning them to save, Abideth with me still upon my service prest, And leaves the looser Nymphs to wayt upon the rest: In Summer giving earth, from which I sqare my Fuell cut out of the Marsh. Peat, And faster feedings by, for Deere, for Horse, and Neat. My various Brookes and Pooles worne by the water, into which the rising floods have recourse. Fleets for Fowle, O who is he can tell, The species that in me for multitudes excell! The Duck, and Mallard first, the Falconers onely sport, (Of River-flights the chiefe, so that all other sort, They onely Greene-Fowle tearme) in every Mere abound, That you would thinke they sate upon the very ground, Their numbers be so great, the waters covering quite, That rais'd, the spacious ayre is darkened with their flight; Yet still the dangerous Dykes, from shot doe them secure, Where they from Flash to Flash, like the full Epicure Waft, as they lov'd to change their Diet every meale; And neere to them ye see the lesser dibling Teale In The word in Falconry, for a company of Teale. Bunches, with the first that flie from Mere to Mere, As they above the rest were Lords of Earth and Ayre. The Gossander with them, my goodly Fennes doe show His head as Ebon blacke, the rest as white as Snow, With whom the Widgeon goes, the Golden-Eye, the Smeath, And in odde scattred pits, the Flags, and Reeds beneath; The Coot, bald, else cleane black, that whitenesse it doth beare Upon the forehead star'd, the Water-Hen doth weare Upon her little tayle, in one small feather set. The Water-woosell next, all over black as Jeat, With various colours, black, greene, blew, red, russet, white, Doe yeeld the gazing eye as variable delight, As doe those sundry Fowles, whose severall plumes they be. The diving Dob-chick, here among the rest you see, Now up, now downe againe, that hard it is to proove, Whether under water most it liveth, or above: With which last little Fowle, (that water may not lacke; More then the Dob-chick doth, and more doth love the Salt water. brack) The Puffin we compare, which comming to the dish, Nice pallats hardly judge, if it be flesh or fish. But wherefore should I stand upon such toyes as these, That have so goodly Fowles, the wandring eye to please. Here in my vaster Pooles, as white as Snow or Milke, (In water blacke as Stix) swimmes the wild Swanne, the Ilke, Of Hollanders so tearm'd, no niggard of his breath, (As Poets say of Swannes, which onely sing in death) But oft as other Birds, is heard his tunnes to roat, Which like a Trumpet comes, from his long arched throat, And tow'rds this watry kind, about the Flashes brimme, Some cloven-footed are, by nature not to swimme. There stalks the stately Crane, as though he march'd in warre, By him that hath the Herne, which (by the Fishy Carre) Can fetch with their long necks, out of the Rush and Reed, Snigs, Fry, and yellow Frogs, whereon they often feed: And under them againe, (that water never take, But by some Ditches side, or little shallow Lake Lye dabling night and day) the pallat-pleasing Snite, The Bidcocke, and like them the Redshanke, that delight Together still to be, in some small Reedy bed, In which these little Fowles in Summers time were bred. The Buzzing Bitter sits, which through his hollow Bill, A sudden bellowing sends, which many times doth fill The neighbouring Marsh with noyse, as though a Bull did roare; But scarcely have I yet recited halfe my store: And with my wondrous flocks of Wild-geese come I then, Which looke as though alone they peopled all the Fen, Which here in Winter time, when all is overflow'd, And want of sollid sward inforceth them abroad, Th'abundance then is seene, that my full Fennes doe yeeld, That almost through the Isle, doe pester every field. The Barnacles with them, which wheresoere they breed, On Trees, or rotten Ships, yet to my Fennes for feed Continually they come, and chiefe abode doe make, And very hardly forc'd my plenty to forsake: Who almost all this kind doe challenge as mine owne, Whose like I dare averre, is elsewhere hardly knowne. For sure unlesse in me, no one yet ever saw The multitudes of Fowle, in Mooting time they draw: From which to many a one, much profit doth accrue. Now such as flying feed, next these I must pursue; The Sea-meaw, Sea-pye, Gull, and Curlew heere doe keepe, As searching every Shole, and watching every deepe, To find the floating Fry, with their sharpe-pearcing sight, Which suddenly they take, by stouping from their height. The Cormorant then comes, (by his devouring kind) Which flying o'r the Fen, imediatly doth find The Fleet best stor'd of Fish, when from his wings at full, As though he shot himselfe into the thickned skull, He under water goes, and so the Shoale pursues, Which into Creeks doe flie, when quickly he doth chuse, The Fin that likes him best, and rising, flying feeds. The Ospray oft here seene, though seldome here it breeds, Which over them the Fish no sooner doe espie, But (betwixt him and them, by an antipathy) Turning their bellies up, as though their death they saw, They at his pleasure lye, to stuffe his glutt'nous maw. The pleasures of the Fennes.The toyling Fisher here is tewing of his Net: The Fowler is imployd his lymed twigs to set. One underneath his Horse, to get a shoot doth stalke; Another over Dykes upon his Stilts doth walke: There other with their Spades, the Peats are squaring out, And others from their Carres, are busily about, To draw out Sedge and Reed, for Thatch and Stover fit, That whosoever would a Landskip rightly hit, Beholding but my Fennes, shall with more shapes be stor'd, Then Germany, or France, or Thuscan can afford: And for that part of me, which men high Holland call, Where Boston seated is, by plenteous Wythams fall, I peremptory am, large Neptunes liquid field, Doth to no other tract the like aboundance yeeld. For that of all the Seas invironing this Isle, Our Irish, Spanish, French, how e'r we them enstyle, The German is the great'st, and it is onely I, That doe upon the same with most advantage lye. What Fish can any shore, or British Sea-towne show, That's eatable to us, that it doth not bestow Abundantly thereon? the Herring king of Sea, The faster feeding Cod, the Mackrell brought by May, The daintie Sole, and Plaice, the Dabb, as of their blood; The Conger finely sous'd, hote Summers coolest food; The Whiting knowne to all, a generall wholesome Dish; The Gurnet, Rochet, Mayd, and Mullet, dainty Fish; The Haddock, Turbet, Bert, Fish nourishing and strong; The Thornback, and the Scate, provocative among: The Weaver, which although his prickles venom bee, By Fishers cut away, which Buyers seldome see: Yet for the Fish he beares, tis not accounted bad; The Sea-Flounder is here as common as the Shad; The Sturgeon cut to Keggs, (too big to handle whole) Gives many a dainty bit out of his lusty Jole. Yet of rich Neptunes store, whilst thus I Idely chat, Thinke not that all betwixt the Wherpoole, and the Sprat, I goe about to name, that were to take in hand, The Atomy to tell, or to cast up the sand; But on the English coast, those most that usuall are, Wherewith the staules from thence doe furnish us for farre; Amongst whose sundry sorts, since thus farre I am in, Ile of our Shell-Fish speake, with these of Scale and Fin: The Sperme-increasing Crab, much Cooking that doth aske, The big-legg'd Lobster, fit for wanton Venus taske, Voluptuaries oft take rather then for food, And that the same effect which worketh in the blood The rough long Oyster is, much like the Lobster limb'd: The Oyster hote as they, the Mussle often trimd With Orient Pearle within, as thereby nature show'd, That she some secret good had on that Shell bestow'd: The Scallop cordiall judgd, the dainty Wilk and Limp, The Periwincle, Prawne, the Cockle, and the Shrimpe, For wanton womens tasts, or for weake stomacks bought. When Kestiven this while that certainly had thought, Kestivens Oration.Her tongue would ne'r have stopt, quoth shee, O how I hate, Thus of her foggy Fennes, to heare rude Holland prate, That with her Fish and Fowle, here keepeth such a coyle, As her unwholesome ayre, and more unwholesome soyle, For these of which shee boasts, the more might suffred be; When those her feathered flocks she sends not out to me, Wherein cleare Witham they, and many a little Brooke, (In which the Sunne it selfe may well be proud to looke) Have made their Flesh more sweet by my refined food, From that so ramish tast of her most fulsome mud, When the toyld Cater home them to the Kitchen brings, The Cooke doth cast them out, as most unsavory things. Besides, what is she else, but a foule woosie Marsh, And that shee calls her grasse, so blady is, and harsh, As cuts the Cattels mouthes, constrain'd thereon to feed, So that my poorest trash, which mine call Rush and Reed, For litter scarcely fit, that to the dung I throw, Doth like the Penny grasse, or the pure Clover show, Compared with her best: and for her sundry Fish, Of which she freely boasts, to furnish every Dish. Did not full Neptunes fields so furnish her with store, Those in the Ditches bred, within her muddy Moore, Are of so earthy taste, as that the Ravenous Crow Will rather starve, thereon her stomack then bestow. From Stamford as along my tract tow'rd Lincolne straines, What Shire is there can shew more valuable Vaines Of soyle then is in mee? or where can there be found, So faire and fertile fields, or Sheep-walks nere so sound? Where doth the pleasant ayre resent a sweeter breath? What Countrey can produce a delicater Heath, Then that which her faire Name from Ancaster Heath. Ancaster doth hold? Through all the neighboring Shires, whose praise shall still be told, Which Flora in the Spring doth with such wealth adorne, That Bever needs not much her company to scorne, Though shee a Vale lye low, and this a Heath sit hye, Yet doth she not alone, allure the wondring eye With prospect from each part, but that her pleasant ground Gives all that may content, the well-breath'd Horse and Hound: And from the Britans yet, to shew what then I was, One of the Roman Wayes neere through my midst did passe: Besides to my much praise, there hath been in my mould Their painted Pavements found, and Armes of perfect gold. They neere the Saxons raigne, that in this tract did dwell, No Tract can shew so brave Churches. All other of this Isle, for that they would excell For Churches every where, so rich and goodly rear'd In every little Dorpe, that after-times have fear'd T'attempt so mighty workes; yet one above the rest, In which it may be thought, they strove to doe their best, Of pleasant Grantham is, that Piramis so hye, Rear'd (as it might be thought) to overtop the skie, The Traveller that strikes into a wondrous maze, As on his Horse he sits, on that proud height to gaze. When Wytham that this while a listning eare had laid, To hearken (for her selfe) what Kestiven had said, Much pleasd with this report, for that she was the earth From whom she onely had her sweet and seasoned birth, From Wytham which that name derived from her Springs, A Towne so called. Thus as she trips along, this dainty Rivelet sings. Ye easie ambling streames, which way soe'r you runne, Or tow'rds the pleasant rise, or tow'rds the mid-day Sunne: By which (as some suppose by use that have them tride) Your waters in their course are neatly purifi'd. Be what you are, or can, I not your Beauties feare, When Neptune shall commaund the Naiades t'appeare. In River what is found, in me that is not rare: Yet for my wel-fed Pykes, I am without compare. From Wytham mine owne Towne, first watred with my sourse, As to the Easterne Sea, I hasten on my course. Who sees so pleasant plaines, or is of fairer seene, Whose Swains in Shepheards gray, and Gyrles in Lincolne greene? Whilst some the rings of Bells, and some the Bag-pipes ply, Lincolne anciently dyed the best greene of England. Dance many a merry Round, and many a Hydegy. I envy, any Brooke should in my pleasure share, Yet for my daintie Pykes, I am without compare. No Land-floods can mee force to over-proud a height; Nor am I in my Course, too crooked, or too streight: My depths fall by descents, too long, nor yet too broad, My Foards with Pebbles, cleare as Orient Pearles, are strowd; My gentle winding Banks, with sundry Flowers are drest, The higher rising Heaths, hold distance with my brest. Thus to her proper Song, the Burthen still she bare; Yet for my dainty Pykes, I am without compare. By this to Lincolne com'n, upon whose loftie Scite, Whilst wistly Wytham looks with wonderfull delight, Enamoured of the state, and beautie of the place, That her of all the rest especially doth grace, Leaving her former Course, in which she first set forth, Which seemed to have been directly to the North: Shee runnes her silver front into the muddy Fen, Which lyes into the East, in her deepe journey, when Cleare Ban a pretty Brooke, from Lyndsey comming downe, Botulphs towne contractedly Boston.Delicious Wytham leads to holy Botulphs Towne, Where proudly she puts in amongst the great resort, That their appearance make in Neptunes watry Court. Now Lyndsey all this while, that duely did attend, Till both her Rivals thus had fully made an end Lyndsies oration.Of their so tedious talke, when lastly shee replyes; Loe, bravely here she sits, that both your states defies. Faire Lincolne is mine owne, which lies upon my South, As likewise to the North, great Humbers swelling mouth Encircles me, twixt which in length I bravely lye: O who can me the best, before them both deny? Nor Britaine in her Bounds, scarce such a Tract can show, Whose shore like to the backe of a well-bended Bow, The Ocean beareth out, and every where so thicke, The Villages and Dorps upon my Bosome sticke, That it is very hard for any to define, Whether Up-land most I be, or most am Maratine. What is there that compleat can any Country make, That in large measure I, (faire Lindsey) not pertake, As healthy Heaths, and Woods, faire Dales, and pleasant Hils, All watred here and there, with pretty creeping Rills, Fat Pasture, mellow Gleabe, and of that kind what can, Give nourishment to beast, or benefit to man, As Kestiven doth boast, her Wytham so have I, My Ancum (onely mine) whose fame as farre doth flie, For fat and daintie Eeles, as hers doth for her Pyke, Wytham Eele, and Ancum Pyke, In all the world there is none syke. Which makes the Proverbe up, the world hath not the like. From Razin her cleere Springs, where first she doth arive, As in an even course, to Humber foorth doth drive, Faire Barton shee salutes, which from her Scite out-braves Rough Humber, when he strives to shew his sternest waves. Now for my Bounds to speake, few Tracts (I thinke) there be, The Bounds of Kestiven. (And search through all this Isle) to paralell with mee: Great Humber holds me North, (as I have said before) From whom (even) all along, upon the Easterne shore, The German Ocean lyes; and on my Southerne side, Cleere Wytham in her course, me fairely doth divide From Holland; and from thence the Fosdyke is my bound, Which our first Henry cut from Lincolne, where he found, Commodities by Trent, from Humber to convay: So Nature, the cleere Trent doth fortunatly lay, To ward me on the West, though farther I extend, And in my larger bounds doe largely comprehend Full Axholme, (which those neere, the fertile doe instile) Which Idle, Don, and Trent, imbracing make an Isle. But wherefore of my Bounds, thus onely doe I boast, When that which Holland seemes to vaunt her on the most, By me is overmatcht; the Fowle which shee doth breed: Shee in her foggy Fennes, so moorishly doth feed, That Phisick oft forbids the Patient them for food, But mine more ayrie are, and make fine spirits and blood: For neere this batning Isle, in me is to be seene, More then on any earth, the Plover gray, and greene, The Corne-land-loving Quayle, the daintiest of our bits, The Rayle, which seldome comes, but upon Rich mens spits: The Puet, Godwit, Stint, the pallat that allure, The Miser and doe make a wastfull Epicure: The Knot, that called was Canutus Bird of old, Of that great King of Danes, his name that still doth hold, His apetite to please, that farre and neere was sought, For him (as some have sayd) from Denmarke hither brought The Dotterell, which we thinke a very daintie dish, Whose taking makes such sport, as man no more can wish; For as you creepe, or cowre, or lye, or stoupe, or goe, So marking you (with care) the Apish Bird doth doe, And acting every thing, doth never marke the Net, Till he be in the Snare, which men for him have set. The big-boan'd Bustard then, whose body beares that size, That he against the wind must runne, e're he can rise: The Shouler, which so shakes the ayre with saily wings, That ever as he flyes, you still would thinke he sings. These Fowles, with other Soyles, although they frequent be, Yet are they found most sweet and delicate in me. Thus whilst shee seemes t'extoll in her peculiar praise, The Muse which seem'd too slacke, in these too low-pitcht layes, For nobler height prepares, her oblique course, and casts A new Booke to begin, an end of this shee hasts. The sixe and twentieth Song. The Argument. Three Shires at once this Song assayes, By various and unusuall wayes. At Nottingham first comming in, The Vale of Bever doth begin; Tow'rds Lester then her course shee holds, And sayling o'r the pleasant Oulds, Shee fetcheth Soare downe from her Springs, By Charnwood, which to Trent shee brings, Then showes the Braveries of that Flood, Makes Sherwood sing her Robin Hood; Then rouzes up the aged Peake, And of her Wonders makes her speake: Thence Darwin downe by Darby tends, And at her fall, to Trent, it ends. Now scarcely on this Tract the Muse had entrance made, Enclining to the South, but Bevers batning Slade Receiveth her to Guest, whose comming had too long Put off her rightfull praise, when thus her selfe she sung. Three Shires there are (quoth she) in me their parts that claime, The Vale of Bever bordreth upon 3. Shires. Large Lincolne, Rutland Rich, and th'Norths Eye Nottingham. But in the last of these since most of me doth lye, To that my most-lov'd Shire my selfe I must apply. Not Evsham that proud Nymph, although she still pretend Not a more pleasant Vale in all great Britaine, then Bever. Her selfe the first of Vales, and though abroad she send Her awfull dread Command, that all should tribute pay To her as our great Queene; nor White-horse, though her Clay Of silver seeme to be, new melted, nor the Vale Of Alsbury, whose grasse seemes given out by tale, For it so Silken is, nor any of our kind, Or what, or where they be, or howsoere inclind, Me Bever shall outbrave, that in my state doe scorne, By any of them all (once) to be overborne, With theirs, doe but compare the Country where I lye, My Hill, and Oulds will say, they are the Islands eye. Consider next my Scite, and say it doth excell; Then come unto my Soyle, and you shall see it swell, With every Grasse and Graine, that Britaine forth can bring: I challenge any Vale, to shew me but that thing I cannot shew to her, (that truly is mine owne) Besides I dare thus boast, that I as farre am knowne, As any of them all, the South their names doth sound, The spacious North doth mee, that there is scarcely found A roomth for any else, it is so fild with mine, Which but a little wants of making me divine: Nor barren am of Brookes, for that I still reteine Two neat and daintie Rills, the little Snyte, and Deane, That from the lovely Oulds, their beautious parent sprong From the Lecestrian fields, come on with me along, Till both within one Banke, they on my North are meint, And where I end, they fall, at Newarck, into Trent. Hence wandring as the Muse delightfully beholds The beautie of the large, and goodly full-flockd Oulds, Shee on the left hand leaves old Lecester, and flyes, Untill the fertile earth glut her insatiate eyes, From Rich to Richer still, that riseth her before, Untill shee come to cease upon the head of Soare, Where The 2. famous Wayes of England. See to the 13. Song. Fosse, and Watling cut each other in their course At A little Village at the rising of Soare. Sharnford, where at first her soft and gentle sourse, To her but shallow Bankes, beginneth to repayre, Of all this beautious Isle, the delicatest ayre; Whence softly sallying out, as loath the place to leave, Shee Sence a pretty Rill doth courteously receive: For Swift, a little Brooke, which certainly shee thought Downe to the Banks of Trent, would safely her have brought, Because their native Springs so neerely were allyde, Her sister Soare forsooke, and wholly her applide To Avon, as with her continually to keepe, And wayt on her along to the Sabrinian deepe. Thus with her hand-mayd Sence, the Soare doth eas'ly slide By Lecester, where yet her ruines show her pride, Demolisht many yeares, that of the great foundation Of her long buried walls, men hardly see the station; Yet of some pieces found, so sure the Cyment locks The stones, that they remaine like perdurable rocks: Where whilst the lovely Soare, with many a deare imbrace, Is solacing her selfe with this delightfull place, The Forrest, which the name of that brave Towne doth beare, Lecester Forrest. With many a goodly wreath, crownes her disheveld hayre, And in her gallant Greene, her lusty Livery showes Her selfe to this faire Flood, which mildly as shee flowes, Reciprocally likes her length and breadth to see, As also how shee keepes her fertile purlues free: The Herds of Fallow Deere shee on the Launds doth feed, As having in her selfe to furnish every need. But now since gentle Soare, such leasure seemes to take, The Muse in her behalfe this strong defence doth make, Against the neighbour floods, for that which tax her so, And her a Channell call, because she is so slow. The cause is that shee lyes upon so low a Flat, Where nature most of all befriended her in that, The longer to enjoy the good she doth possesse: For had those (with such speed that forward seeme to presse) So many dainty Meads, and Pastures theirs to be, They then would wish themselves to be as slow as she, Who well may be compar'd to some young tender Mayd, Entring some Princes Court, which is for pompe arayd, A Simily of Soare. Who led from roome to roome amazed is to see The furnitures and states, which all Imbroyderies be, The rich and sumptuous Beds, with Tester-covering plumes, And various as the Sutes, so various the perfumes, Large Galleries, where piece with piece doth seeme to strive, Of Pictures done to life, Landskip, and Perspective, Thence goodly Gardens sees, where Antique Statues stand In Stone and Copper, cut by many a skilfull hand, Where every thing to gaze, her more and more entices, Thinking at once shee sees a thousand Paradices, Goes softly on, as though before she saw the last, She long'd againe to see, what she had slightly past. So the enticing Soyle the Soare along doth lead, As wondring in her selfe, at many a spacious Mead; When Charnwood from the rocks salutes her wished sight, (Of many a Wood-god woo'd) her darling and delight, Whose beautie whilst that Soare is pawsing to behold Cleere Wreakin comming in, from Waltham on the Ould, Brings Eye, a pretty Brooke, to beare her silver traine, Which on by Melton make, and tripping o'r the Plaine, Here finding her surpriz'd with proud Mount-Sorrels sight, By quickning of her Course, more eas'ly doth invite Her to the goodly Trent, where as she goes along By Loughborough, she thus of that faire Forrest sung. O Charnwood, be thou cald the choycest of thy kind, The like in any place, what Flood hath hapt to find? No Tract in all this Isle, the proudest let her be, Can shew a Sylvan Nymph, for beautie like to thee: The Satyrs, and the Fawnes, by Dian set to keepe, Rough Hilles, and Forrest holts, were sadly seene to weepe, When thy high-palmed Harts the sport of Bowes and Hounds, By gripple Borderers hands, were banished thy grounds. The Driades that were wont about thy Lawnes to rove, To trip from Wood to Wood, and scud from Grove to Grove, On Two mightie Rocks in the Forrest. Sharpley that were seene, and Two mightie Rocks in the Forrest. Cadmans aged rocks, Against the rising Sunne, to brayd their silver locks; And with the harmelesse Elves, on Heathy A Hill in the Forrest. Bardons height, By Cynthia's colder beames to play them night by night, Exil'd their sweet aboad, to poore bare Commons fled, They with the Okes that liv'd, now with the Okes are dead. Who will describe to life, a Forrest, let him take Thy Surface to himselfe, nor shall he need to make An other forme at all, where oft in thee is found Fine sharpe but easie Hills, which reverently are crownd With aged Antique Rocks, to which the Goats and Sheepe, (To him that stands remoat) doe softly seeme to creepe, To gnaw the little shrubs, on their steepe sides that grow; Upon whose other part, on some descending Brow, Huge stones are hanging out, as though they downe would drop, Where under-growing Okes, on their old shoulders prop The others hory heads, which still seeme to decline, And in a Dimble neere, (even as a place divine, For Contemplation fit) an Ivy-seeled Bower, As Nature had therein ordayn'd some Sylvan power; A Simily of Charnwood Forrest.As men may very oft at great Assemblies see, Where many of most choyce, and wondred Beauties be: For Stature one doth seeme the best away to beare; Another for her Shape, to stand beyond compare; Another for the fine composure of a face: Another short of these, yet for a modest grace Before them all preferd; amongst the rest yet one, Adjudg'd by all to bee, so perfect Paragon, That all those parts in her together simply dwell, For which the other doe so severally excell. My Charnwood like the last, hath in her selfe alone, What excellent can be in any Forrest showne, On whom when thus the Soare had these high praises spent, She easily slid away into her Soveraigne Trent, Who having wandred long, at length began to leave Her native Countries bounds, and kindly doth receive The lesser Tame, and Messe, the Messe a daintie Rill, Neere Charnwood rising first, where she begins to fill Her Banks, which all her course on both sides doe abound With Heath and Finny olds, and often gleaby ground, Till Croxals fertill earth doth comfort her at last When shee is entring Trent; but I was like t'ave past The other Sence, whose source doth rise not farre from hers, By Ancor, that her selfe to famous Trent prefers, Two Rivers of one name in one Shire. The second of that name, allotted to this Shire, A name but hardly found in any place but here; Nor is to many knowne, this Country that frequent. But Muse returne at last, attend the princely Trent, Who straining on in state, the Norths imperious Flood, The third of England cald, with many a daintie Wood, Being crown'd to Burton comes, to Needwood where she showes Her selfe in all her pompe; and as from thence she flowes, Shee takes into her Traine rich Dove, and Darwin cleere, Darwin, whose fount and fall are both in Darbysheere; And of those thirtie Floods, that wayt the Trent upon, Doth stand without compare, the very Paragon. Thus wandring at her will, as uncontrould shee ranges, Her often varying forme, as variously and changes. First Erwash, and then Lyne, sweet Sherwood sends her in; Then looking wyde, as one that newly wak'd had bin, Saluted from the North, with Nottinghams proud height, So strongly is surpriz'd, and taken with the sight, That shee from running wild, but hardly can refraine, To view in how great state, as she along doth straine, That brave exalted seat, beholdeth her in pride, As how the large-spread Meads upon the other side, All flourishing in Flowers, and rich embroyderies drest, In which she sees her selfe above her neighbours blest. As rap'd with the delights, that her this Prospect brings, In her peculiar praise, loe thus the River sings. Whence Trent is supposed to derive her name. See to the 12. Song.What should I care at all, from what my name I take, That Thirtie doth import, that thirty Rivers make; My greatnesse what it is, or thirty Abbayes great, That on my fruitfull Banks, times formerly did seat: Or thirtie kinds of Fish, that in my Streames doe live, To me this name of Trent did from that number give. What reack I: let great Thames, since by his fortune he Is Soveraigne of us all that here in Britaine be; From Isis, and old Tame, his Pedigree derive: And for the second place, proud Severne that doth strive, Fetch her discent from Wales, from that proud Mountaine sprung, Plinillimon, whose praise is frequent them among, As of that princely Mayd, whose name she boasts to beare, Bright Sabrin, which she holds as her undoubted heyre. Let these imperious Floods draw downe their long discent From these so famous Stocks, and only say of Trent, That Moorelands barren earth me first to light did bring, Which though she be but browne, my cleere complexiond Spring, Gain'd with the Nymphs such grace, that when I first did rise, The Naiades on my brim, danc'd wanton Hydagies, And on her spacious breast, with Heaths that doth abound) Encircled my faire Fount with many a lustie round: And of the British Floods, though but the third I be, Yet Thames, and Severne both in this come short of me, For that I am the Mere of England, that divides The North part from the South, on my so either sides, That reckoning how these Tracts in compasse be extent, Men bound them on the North, or on the South of Trent; Their Banks are barren Sands, if but compar'd with mine, Through my perspicuous Breast, the pearly Pebbles shine: I throw my Christall Armes along the Flowry Vallies, Which lying sleeke, and smooth, as any Garden-Allies, Doe give me leave to play, whilst they doe Court my Streame, And crowne my winding banks with many an Anademe: My Silver-scaled Skuls about my Streames doe sweepe, Now in the shallow foords, now in the falling Deepe: So that of every kind, the new-spawn'd numerous Frie Seeme in me as the Sands that on my Shore doe lye. The Barbell, then which Fish, a braver doth not swimme, Nor greater for the Ford within my spacious brimme, Nor (newly taken) more the curious taste doth please; The Greling, whose great Spawne is big as any Pease; The Pearch with pricking Finnes, against the Pike prepar'd, As Nature had thereon bestow'd this stronger guard, His daintinesse to keepe, (each curious pallats proofe) From his vile ravenous foe: next him I name the Ruffe, His very neere Ally, and both for scale and Fin, In taste, and for his Bayte (indeed) his next of kin; The pretty slender Dare, of many cald the Dace, Within my liquid glasse, when Phæbus lookes his face, Oft swiftly as he swimmes, his silver belly showes, But with such nimble slight, that ere yee can disclose His shape, out of your sight like lightning he is shot. The Trout by Nature markt with many a Crimson spot, As though shee curious were in him above the rest, And of fresh-water Fish, did note him for the best; The Roche, whose common kind to every Flood doth fall; The Chub, (whose neater name) which some a Chevin call, Food to the Tyrant Pyke, (most being in his power) Who for their numerous store he most doth them devoure; The lustie Salmon then, from Neptunes watry Realme, When as his season serves, stemming my tydefull Streame, Then being in his kind, in me his pleasure takes, (For whom the Fisher then all other Game forsakes) Which bending of himselfe to th'fashion of a Ring, Above the forced Weares, himselfe doth nimbly fling, And often when the Net hath dragd him safe to land, Is seene by naturall force to scape his murderers hand; Whose graine doth rise in flakes, with fatnesse interlarded, Of many a liquorish lip, that highly is regarded. And Humber, to whose waste I pay my watry store, Me of her Sturgeons sends, that I thereby the more Should have my beauties grac'd, with some thing from him sent: Not Ancums silvered Eele exceedeth that of Trent; Though the sweet-smelling Smelt be more in Thames then me, The Lamprey, and his The Lamparne. Lesse, in Severne generall be; The Flounder smooth and flat, in other Rivers caught, Perhaps in greater store, yet better are not thought: The daintie Gudgeon, Loche, the Minnow, and the Bleake, Since they but little are, I little need to speake Of them, nor doth it fit mee much of those to reck, Which every where are found in every little Beck; Nor of the Crayfish here, which creepes amongst my stones, From all the rest alone, whose shell is all his bones: For Carpe, the Tench, and Breame, my other store among, To Lakes and standing Pooles, that chiefly doe belong, Here scowring in my Foards, feed in my waters cleere, Are muddy Fish in Ponds to that which they are heere. From Nottingham, neere which this River first begun, This Song, she the meane while, by Newarke having run, Receiving little Snyte, from Bevers batning grounds, At Gaynsborough goes out, where the Lincolnian bounds. Yet Sherwood all this while not satisfi'd to show Her love to princely Trent, as downward shee doth flow, Her Meden and her Man, shee downe from Mansfield sends To Idle for her ayd, by whom she recommends Her love to that brave Queene of waters, her to meet, When she tow'rds Humber comes, do humbly kisse her feet, And clip her till shee grace great Humber with her fall. When Sherwood somewhat backe, the forward Muse doth call; For shee was let to know, that Soare had in her Song So chanted Charnwoods worth, the Rivers that along, Amongst the neighbouring Nymphs, there was no other Layes, But those which seem'd to sound of Charnwood, and her praise: Which Sherwood tooke to heart, and very much disdain'd, (As one that had both long, and worthily maintain'd The title of the great'st, and bravest of her kind) To fall so farre below, one wretchedly confin'd Within a furlongs space, to her large skirts compar'd: Wherefore shee as a Nymph that neither fear'd, nor car'd For ought to her might chance, by others love or hate, With Resolution arm'd, against the power of Fate, All selfe-praise set apart, determineth to sing That lustie Robin Hood, who long time like a King Within her compasse liv'd, and when he list to range For some rich Booty set, or else his ayre to change, To Sherwood still retyr'd, his onely standing Court, Whose praise the Forrest thus doth pleasantly report. The merry pranks he playd, would aske an age to tell, Robin Hoods Story. And the adventures strange that Robin Hood befell, When Mansfield many a time for Robin hath bin layd, How he hath cosned them, that him would have betrayd; How often he hath come to Nottingham disguisd, And cunningly escapt, being set to be surprizd. In this our spacious Isle, I thinke there is not one, But he hath heard some talke of him and little John; And to the end of time, the Tales shall ne'r be done, Of Scarlock, George a Greene, and Much the Millers sonne, Of Tuck the merry Frier, which many a Sermon made, In praise of Robin Hood, his Out-lawes, and their Trade. An hundred valiant men had this brave Robin Hood, Still ready at his call, that Bow-men were right good, All clad in Lincolne Greene, with Caps of Red and Blew, His fellowes winded Horne, not one of them but knew, When setting to their lips their little Beugles shrill, The warbling Eccho's wakt from every Dale and Hill: Their Bauldricks set with Studs, athwart their shoulders cast, To which under their armes, their Sheafes were buckled fast, A short Sword at their Belt, a Buckler scarse a span, Who strooke below the knee, not counted then a man: All made of Spanish Yew, their Bowes were wondrous strong; They not an Arrow drew, but was a cloth-yard long. Of Archery they had the very perfect craft, With Broad-arrow, or But, or Prick, or Roving Shaft, At Markes full fortie score, they us'd to Prick, and Rove, Yet higher then the breast, for Compasse never strove; Yet at the farthest marke a foot could hardly win: At Long-buts, short, and Hoyles, each one could cleave the pin: Their Arrowes finely pair'd, for Timber, and for Feather, With Birch and Brazill peec'd, to flie in any weather; And shot they with the round, the square, or forked Pyle, The loose gave such a twang, as might be heard a myle. And of these Archers brave, there was not any one, But he could kill a Deere his swiftest speed upon, Which they did boyle and rost, in many a mightie wood, Sharpe hunger the fine sauce to their more kingly food. Then taking them to rest, his merry men and hee Slept many a Summers night under the Greenewood tree. From wealthy Abbots chests, and Churles abundant store, What often times he tooke, he shar'd amongst the poore: No lordly Bishop came in lusty Robins way, To him before he went, but for his Passe must pay: The Widdow in distresse he graciously reliev'd, And remedied the wrongs of many a Virgin griev'd: He from the husbands bed no married woman wan, But to his Mistris deare, his loved Marian Was ever constant knowne, which wheresoere shee came, Was soveraigne of the Woods, chiefe Lady of the Game: Her Clothes tuck'd to the knee, and daintie braided haire, With Bow and Quiver arm'd, shee wandred here and there, Amongst the Forrests wild; Diana never knew Such pleasures, nor such Harts as Mariana slew. Of merry Robin Hood, and of his merrier men, The Song had scarcely ceas'd, when as the Muse agen Wades A Riveret parting the two Shires. Erwash, (that at hand) on Sherwoods setting side, The Nottinghamian Fields, and Derbian doth divide, And Northward from her Springs, haps Scardale forth to find, Which like her Mistris Peake, is naturally enclind To thrust forth ragged Cleeves, with which she scattered lyes, As busie Nature here could not her selfe suffice, Of this oft-altring earth the sundry shapes to show, That from my entrance here, doth rough and rougher grow, Which of a lowly Dale, although the name it beare, You by the Rocks might think that it a Mountaine were, From which it takes the name of Scardale, which exprest, Is the hard Vale of Rocks, of Chesterfield possest, By her which is instild; where Rother from her rist, Ibber, and Crawley hath, and Gunno, that assist Her weaker wandring Streame tow'rds Yorkeshire as she wends, So Scardale tow'rds the same, that lovely Iddle sends, That helps the fertile Seat of Axholme to in-Isle: But to th'unwearied Muse the Peake appeares the while, A withered Beldam long, with bleared watrish eyes, With many a bleake storme dim'd, which often to the Skies Shee cast, and oft to th'earth bow'd downe her aged head, Her meager wrinkled face, being sullyed still with lead, Which sitting in the workes, and poring o'r the Mines, Which shee out of the Oare continually refines: For shee a Chimist was, and Natures secrets knew, And from amongst the Lead, she Antimony drew, And Christall there congeal'd, (by her enstyled Flowers) And in all Medcins knew their most effectuall powers. The spirits that haunt the Mynes, she could command and tame, And bind them as she list in Saturns dreadfull name: Shee Mil-stones from the Quarrs, with sharpned picks could get, And dainty Whetstones make, the dull-edgd tooles to whet. Wherefore the Peake as proud of her laborious toyle, As others of their Corne, or goodnesse of their Soyle, Thinking the time was long, till shee her tale had told, Her Wonders one by one, thus plainly doth unfold. My dreadfull daughters borne, your mothers deare delight, The Peakes Wonders. Great Natures chiefest worke, wherein shee shew'd her might; Yee darke and hollow Caves, the pourtratures of Hell, Where Fogs, and misty Damps continually doe dwell; O yee my onely Joyes, my Darlings, in whose eyes, Horror assumes her seat, from whose abiding flyes Thicke Vapours, that like Rugs still hang the troubled ayre, Yee of your mother Peake, the hope and onely care: O thou my first and best, of thy blacke Entrance nam'd The Divels-Arse, in me, O be thou not asham'd, The Divels-arse in the Peake. Nor thinke thy selfe disgrac'd, or hurt thereby at all, Since from thy horror first men us'd thee so to call: For as amongst the Moores, the Jettiest blacke are deem'd The beautifulst of them; so are your kind esteem'd, The more ye gloomy are, more fearefull and obscure, (That hardly any eye your sternnesse may endure) The more yee famous are, and what name men can hit, That best may ye expresse, that best doth yee befit: For he that will attempt thy blacke and darksome jawes, In midst of Summer meets with Winters stormy flawes, Cold Dewes, that over head from thy foule roofe distill, And meeteth under foot, with a dead sullen Rill, That Acheron it selfe, a man would thinke he were Imediately to passe, and stay'd for Charon there; Thy Flore drad Cave, yet flat, though very rough it be, With often winding turnes: then come thou next to me, Pooles Hole.My prettie daughter Poole, my second loved child, Which by that noble name was happily enstild, Of that more generous stock, long honor'd in this Shire, Of which amongst the rest, one being out-law'd here, For his strong refuge tooke this darke and uncouth place, An heyre-loome ever since, to that succeeding race: Whose entrance though deprest below a mountaine steepe, Besides so very strait, that who will see't, must creepe Into the mouth thereof, yet being once got in, A rude and ample Roofe doth instantly begin To raise it selfe aloft, and who so doth intend The length thereof to see, still going must ascend On mightie slippery stones, as by a winding stayre, Which of a kind of base darke Alablaster are, Of strange and sundry formes, both in the Roofe and Floore, As Nature show'd in thee, what ne'r was seene before. Elden Hole.For Elden thou my third, a Wonder I preferre Before the other two, which perpendicular Dive'st downe into the ground, as if an entrance were Through earth to lead to hell, ye well might judge it here, Whose depth is so immense, and wondrously profound, As that long line which serves the deepest Sea to sound, Her bottome never wrought, as though the vast descent, Through this Terrestriall Globe directly poynting went Our Antipods to see, and with her gloomy eyes, To glote upon those Starres, to us that never rise; That downe into this hole if that a stone yee throw, An acres length from thence, (some say that) yee may goe, And comming backe thereto, with a still listning eare, May heare a sound as though that stone then falling were. Yet for her Caves, and Holes, Peake onely not excells, But that I can againe produce those wondrous Wells Of Buckston, as I have, that most delicious Fount, Which men the second Bath of England doe account, Which in the primer raignes, when first this well began Saint Anne of Buckston.To have her vertues knowne unto the blest Saint Anne, Was consecrated then, which the same temper hath, As that most daintie Spring, which at the famous Bath, Is by the Crosse enstild, whose fame I much preferre, In that I doe compare my daintiest Spring to her, Nice sicknesses to cure, as also to prevent, And supple their cleare skinnes, which Ladies oft frequent; Most full, most faire, most sweet, and most delicious sourse. To this a second Fount, that in her naturall course, Tydeswell. As mighty Neptune doth, so doth shee ebbe and flow. If some Welsh Shires report, that they the like can show, I answere those, that her shall so no wonder call, So farre from any Sea, not any of them all. My Caves, and Fountaines thus delivered you, for change, A little Hill I have, a wonder yet more strange, Sandy Hill. Which though it be of light, and almost dusty sand, Unaltred with the wind, yet firmly doth it stand; And running from the top, although it never cease, Yet doth the foot thereof, no whit at all increase. Nor is it at the top, the lower, or the lesse, As Nature had ordain'd, that so its owne excesse, Should by some secret way within it selfe ascend, To feed the falling backe; with this yet doe not end The wonders of the Peake, for nothing that I have, But it a wonders name doth very justly crave: A Forrest such have I, (of which when any speake, Of me they it enstile, The Forrest of the Peake) The Peake Forrest. Whose Hills doe serve for Brakes, the Rocks for shrubs and trees, To which the Stag pursu'd, as to the thicket flees; Like it in all this Isle, for sternnesse there is none, Where Nature may be said to show you groves of stone, As she in little there, had curiously compyld The modell of the vast Arabian stony Wyld. Then as it is suppos'd, in England that there be Seven wonders: to my selfe so have I here in me, My seaven before rehearc'd, allotted me by Fate, Her greatnesse, as therein ordain'd to imitate. No sooner had the Peake her seven proud wonders sung, But Darwin from her Fount, her mothers Hills among, Through many a crooked way, opposd with envious Rocks, Comes tripping downe tow'rds Trent, and sees the goodly Flocks Fed by her mother Peake; and Heards, (for horne and haire, That hardly are put downe by those of Lancashire,) Which on her Mountaines sides, and in her Bottoms graze, On whose delightfull Course, whilst Unknidge stands to gaze, And looke on her his fill, doth on his tiptoes get, He Nowstoll plainly sees, which likewise from the Set, Salutes her, and like friends, to Heaven-Hill farre away, Thus from their lofty tops, were plainly heard to say. Faire Hill bee not so proud of thy so pleasant Scite, Who for thou giv'st the eye such wonderfull delight, From any Mountaine neere, that glorious name of Heaven, Thy bravery to expresse, was to thy greatnesse given: Nor cast thine eye so much on things that be above: For sawest thou as we doe, our Darwin, thou wouldst love Her more then any thing, that so doth thee allure; When Darwin that by this her travell could endure, Takes Now into her traine, (from Nowstoll her great Sire, Which shewes to take her name) with many a winding Gyre. Then wandring through the Wylds, at length the pretty Wye, From her blacke mother Poole, her nimbler course doth plye Tow'rds Darwin, and along from Bakewell with her brings Lathkell a little Brooke, and Headford, whose poore Springs, But hardly them the name of Riverets can affoord; When Burbrook with the strength, that Nature hath her stor'd, Although but very small, yet much doth Darwin sted. At Worksworth on her way, when from the Mynes of Lead, Browne Eclesborne comes in, then Amber from the East, Of all the Darbian Nymphs of Darwin lov'd the best, (A delicater Flood from fountaine never flow'd) Then comming to the Towne, on which she first bestow'd Her naturall Darwin, of the British Doure Guin, which is White water. Darby from thence, as the place by the water. British name, her Darby, so againe, Her, to that ancient Seat, doth kindly intertaine, Where Marten-Brooke, although an easie shallow Rill, There offereth all she hath, her Mistris Banks to fill, And all too little thinks that was on Darwin spent; From hence as shee departs, in travailing to Trent, Backe goes the active Muse, tow'rds Lancashire amaine, Where matter rests ynough her vigor to maintaine, And to the Northern Hills shall lead her on along, Which now must wholly bee the subject of my Song. The seaven and twentieth Song. The Argument. The circuit of this Shire exprest, Erwell, and Ribble then contest; The Muse next to the Mosses flies, And to fayre Wyre her selfe applies, The Fishy Lun then doth shee bring, The praise of Lancashire to sing, The Isle of Man maintaines her plea, Then falling Eastward from that Sea, On rugged Furnesse, and his Fells, Of which this Canto lastly tells. Scarce could the labouring Muse salute this lively Shire, But strait such shouts arose from every Mosse and Mere, And Rivers rushing downe, with such unusuall noyse, Upon their peably sholes, seem'd to expresse their joyes, That Mersey (in her course which happily confines Brave Chesshire from this Tract, two County Palatines) As ravish'd with the newes, along to Lerpoole ran, That all the Shores which lye to the The Irish Sea. Vergivian, Resounded with the shouts, so that from Creeke to Creeke, So lowd the Ecchoes cry'd, that they were heard to shreeke To Fournesse ridged Front, whereas the rocky Pile The circuit and true demension of Lancashire. Of Foudra is at hand, to guard the out-layd Isle Of Walney, and those grosse and foggy Fells awooke; Thence flying to the East, with their reverberance shooke The Clouds from Pendles head, (which as the people say, Prognosticates to them a happy Halcyon day) Rebounds on Blackstonedge, and there by falling fils Faire Mersey, making in from the Derbeian Hills. But whilst the active Muse thus nimbly goes about, Of this large Tract to lay the true Demensions out, The neat Lancastrian Nymphes, for beauty that excell, That for the The Lancashire Horne-pipe. Hornpipe round doe beare away the bell; Some that about the Banks of Erwell make abode, With some that have their seat by Ribbles silver road, In great contention fell, (that mighty difference grew) Which of those Floods deserv'd to have the soveraigne due; So that all future spleene, and quarrels to prevent, That likely was to rise about their long discent, Before the neighbouring Nymphs, their right they meane to plead, And first thus for her selfe the lovely Erwell sayd. Erwels oration.Yee Lasses, quoth this Flood, have long and blindly er'd, That Ribble before me, so falsely have prefer'd, That am a Native borne, and my descent doe bring, From ancient Gentry here, when Ribble from her Spring, An Alien knowne to be, and from the Mountaines rude Of Yorkshire getting strength, here boldly dares intrude Upon my proper Earth, and through her mighty fall, Is not asham'd her selfe of Lancashire to call: Whereas of all the Nymphes that carefully attend My Mistris Merseys State, ther's none that doth transcend My greatnesse with her grace, which doth me so preferre, That all is due to me, which doth belong to her. For though from Blackstonedge the Taume come tripping downe, And from that long-ridg'd Rocke, her fathers high renowne, Of Mersey thinks from me, the place alone to winne, With my attending Brooks, yet when I once come in, I out of count'nance quite doe put the Nymph, for note, As from my Fountaine I tow'rds mightier Mersey float, First Roch a dainty Rill, from Roch-dale her deare Dame, Who honored with the halfe of her sterne mothers name, Growes proud; yet glad her selfe into my Bankes to get, Which Spodden from her Spring, a pretty Rivelet, As her attendant brings, when Irck addes to my store, And Medlock to their much, by lending somewhat more, At Manchester doe meet, all kneeling to my State, Where brave I show my selfe; then with a prouder gate, Tow'rds Mersey making on, great Chatmosse at my fall, Lyes full of Turfe, and Marle, her unctuous Minerall, And Blocks as blacke as Pitch, (with boring-Augars found) There at the generall Flood supposed to be drownd. Thus chiefe of Merseys traine, away with her I runne, When in her prosperous course shee watreth Warrington, And her faire silver load in Lerpoole downe doth lay, A Road none more renownd in the Vergivian Sea. Yee lustie Lasses then, in Lancashire that dwell, For Beautie that are sayd to beare away the Bell, Your Countries Horn-pipe, yee so minsingly that tread, As ye the Eg-pye love, and Apple Cherry-red; He that wil fish for a Lancashire man, at any time or tide, Must bait his hooke with a good Eg-pie, or an Apple with a red side. In all your mirthfull Songs, and merry meetings tell, That Erwell every way doth Ribble farre excell. Her well-disposed speech had Erwell scarcely done, But swift report therewith imediatly doth runne To the Virgivian Shores, among the Mosses deepe, Where Alt a neighboring Nymph for very joy doth weepe, That Symonds-wood, from whence the Flood assumes her Spring, Excited with the same, was lowdly heard to ring; And over all the Moores, with shrill re-ecchoing sounds, The drooping Fogs to drive from those grosse watry grounds, Where those that toyle for Turffe, with peating Spades doe find Fish living in that earth (contrary to their kind) A wonder in Nature. Which but that Pontus, and Heraclia likewise showes, The like in their like earth, that with like moisture flowes, And that such Fish as these, had not been likewise found, Within farre firmer earth, the Paphlagonian ground, A Wonder of this Isle, this well might have been thought. But Ribbell that this while for her advantage wrought, Of what shee had to say, doth well her selfe advise, And to brave Erwels speech, thus boldly she replies. With that, whereby the most thou thinkst me to disgrace, That I an Alien am, (not rightly of this place) My greatest glory is, and Lancashire therefore, To Nature for my Birth, beholding is the more; That Yorkshire, which all Shires for largenesse doth exceed, A kingdome to be cald, that well deserves (indeed) And not a Fountaine hath, that from her wombe doth flow Within her spacious selfe, but that she can bestow; To Lancaster yet lends, me Ribbell, from her store, Which adds to my renowne, and makes her Bountie more. From Penigents proud foot, as from my source I slide, That Mountaine my proud Syre, in height of all his pride, Takes pleasure in my Course, as in his first-borne Flood: And Ingleborow Hill of that Olympian Brood, With Pendle, of the North the highest Hills that be, Doe wistly me behold, and are beheld of me, These Mountaines make me proud, to gaze on me that stand: So Long-ridge, once ariv'd on the Lancastrian Land, Salutes me, and with smiles, me to his soyle invites, So have I many a Flood, that forward me excites, As Hodder, that from home attends me from my Spring; Then Caldor comming downe, from Blackstonedge doth bring Me eas'ly on my way, to Preston the greatst Towne, Wherewith my Banks are blest; whereat my going downe, Cleere Darwen on along me to the Sea doth drive, And in my spacious fall no sooner I arrive, But Savock to the North, from Longridge making way, To this my greatnesse adds, when in my ample Bay, Swart Dulas comming in, from Wiggin with her ayds, Short Taud, and Dartow small, two little Country Mayds, (In those low watry lands, and Moory Mosses bred) Doe see mee safely layd in mighty Neptunes bed; And cutting in my course, even through the very heart Of this renowned Shire, so equally it part, As Nature should have said, Loe thus I meant to doe; This Flood divides this Shire thus equally in two. Ye Mayds, the Horne-pipe then, so minsingly that tread, As yee the Egg-pye love, and Apple Cherry-red; In all your mirthfull Songs, and merry meetings tell, That Ribbell every way, your Erwell doth excell. Heere ended shee againe, when Mertons Mosse and Mere, With Ribbels sole reply so much revived were, That all the Shores resound the Rivers good successe, And wondrous joy there was all over A part of Lancashire so called. Andernesse, Which straight convayd the newes into the upper land, Ingleborow, Pendle, and Penigent, The highest Hils betwixt Barwick and Trent. See to the 28. Song.Where Pendle, Penigent, and Ingleborow stand Like Gyants, and the rest doe proudly overlooke; Or Atlas-like as though they onely undertooke To under-prop high Heaven, or the wide Welkin dar'd, Who in their Ribbles praise (be sure) no speeches spar'd; That the loud sounds from them downe to the Forrests fell, To Bowland brave in state, and Wyersdale, which as well, As any Sylvan Nymphes, their beautious Scites may boast, Whose Eccho's sent the same all round about the Coast, That there was not a Nymph to Jollity inclind, Or of the wooddy brood, or of the watry kind, But at their fingers ends, they Ribbels Song could say, And perfectly the Note upon the Bag-pipe play. That Wyre, when once she knew how well these Floods had sped, (When their reports abroad in every place was spred) It vex'd her very heart, their eminence to see, Their equall (at the least) who thought her selfe to be, Determins at the last to Neptunes Court to goe, Before his ample State, with humblenesse to show The wrongs she had sustain'd by her proud sisters spight, And offring them no wrong, to doe her greatnesse right; Arising but a Rill at first from Wyersdales lap, Yet still receiving strength from her full Mothers pap, As downe to Seaward she, her serious course doth ply, Takes Caldor comming in, to beare her company. From Woolfcrags Cliffy foot, a Hill to her at hand, By that fayre Forrest knowne, within her Verge to stand. So Bowland from her breast sends Brock her to attend, As she a Forrest is, so likewise doth shee send Her child, on Wyresdales Flood, the dainty Wyre to wayt, With her assisting Rills, when Wyre is once repleat: Shee in her crooked course to Seaward softly slides, Where Pellins mighty Mosse, and Mertons, on her sides Their boggy breasts out lay, and Skipton downe doth crawle, To entertaine this Wyer, attained to her fall: When whilst each wandring flood seem'd setled to admire, First Erwell, Ribbell then, and last of all this Wyre, That mighty wagers would have willingly been layd, (But that these matters were with much discretion staid) Some broyles about these Brooks had surely been begun. When Coker a coy Nymph, that cleerely seemes to shun All popular applause, who from her Christall head, In Wyresdale, neere where Wyre is by her fountaine fed, That by their naturall birth, they seeme (in deed) to twin, Yet for her sisters pride shee careth not a pin, Of none, and being help'd, she likewise helpeth none, But to the Irish Sea goes gently downe alone Of any undisturbd, till comming to her Sound, Endangered by the Sands, with many a loftie bound, Shee leaps against the Tydes, and cries to Christall Lon, The Flood that names the Towne, from whence the Shire begun, Her title first to take, and loudly tells the Flood, That if a little while she thus but trifling stood, These pettie Brooks would bee before her still preferd. Which the long-wandring Lon, with good advisement heard, As shee comes ambling on from Westmerland, where first Arising from her head, amongst the Mountaines nurst, By many a pretty spring, that howerly getting strength, Ariving in her Course in Lancashire at length, Lunesdale.To Lonsdale showes her selfe, and lovingly doth play With her deare daughter Dale, which her frim Cheeke doth lay To her cleere mothers Breast, as minsingly she traces, And oft imbracing her, she oft againe imbraces, And on her Darling smiles, with every little gale. When Lac the most lov'd child of this delicious Dale, And Wemming on the way, present their eithers Spring. Next them she Henbourne hath, and Robourne, which do bring Their bounties in one banke, their Mistris to preferre, That shee with greater state may come to Lancaster, Of her which takes the name, which likewise to the Shire, The Soveraigne title lends, and eminency, where To give to this her Towne, what rightly doth belong, Of this most famous Shire, our Lun thus frames her Song. Lancashire, Faire women.First, that most precious thing, and pleasing most to man, Who from him (made of earth) imediatly began, His shee selfe woman, which the goodliest of this Isle, This country hath brought forth, that much doth grace my stile; Why should those Ancients else, which so much knowing were, When they the Blazons gave to every severall Shire, Fayre women as mine owne, have titled due to me? Lancashire Breed of cattel the best.Besides in all this Isle, there no such Cattell be, For largenesse, Horne, and Haire, as these of Lancashire; So that from every part of England farre and neere, Men haunt her Marts for Store, as from her Race to breed. And for the third, wherein she doth all Shires exceed, Lancashire, Deepe mouthd Hounds.Be those great race of Hounds, the deepest mouth'd of all The other of this kind, which we our Hunters call, Which from their bellowing throats upon a sent so roare, That you would surely thinke, that the firme earth they tore With their wide yawning chaps, or rent the Clouds in sunder, As though by their lowd crie they meant to mocke the thunder. Besides, her Natives have been anciently esteem'd, For Bow-men neere our best, and ever have been deem'd So loyall, that the Guard of our preceding Kings, Lancashire Bowmen. Of them did most consist; but yet mongst all these things, Even almost ever since the English Crowne was set Upon the lawfull head, of our Plantaginet, In Honor, next the first, our Dukedome was allow'd, And alwayes with the greatst, revenewes was endow'd: And after when it hapt, France-conquering Edwards blood Divided in it selfe, here for the Garland stood; The right Lancastrian Line, it from Yorks Issue bare; The Red-rose, our brave Badge, which in their Helmets ware, The White and Red Rose. In many a bloody field, at many a doubtfull fight, Against the House of Yorke, which bare for theirs the White. And for my selfe there's not the Tivy, nor the Wye, See to the sixt Song. Nor any of those Nymphs, that to the Southward lye, For Salmon me excels; and for this name of Lun, Llun, in the British, fulnesse. That I am Christned by, the Britaines it begun, Which Fulnesse doth import, of waters still encrease: To Neptune lowting low, when Christall Lun doth cease, And Conder comming in, conducts her by the hand, Till lastly shee salute the poynt of A part of Lancashire jutting out into the Irish Sea. Sunderland, And leaves our dainty Lun to Amphitrites care. So blyth and bonny now the Lads and Lasses are, That ever as anon the Bag-pipe up doth blow, Cast in a gallant Round about the Harth they goe, And at each pause they kisse, was never seene such rule In any place but heere, at Boon-fire, or at Yeule; And every village smokes at Wakes with lusty cheere, Then Hey they cry for Lun, and Hey for Lancashire; That one high Hill was heard to tell it to his brother, That instantly againe to tell it to some other: From Hill againe to Vale, from Vale to Hill it went, The High-lands they againe, it to the lower sent, The mud-exhausted Meres, and Mosses deepe among, With the report thereof, each Road, and Harbor rung; The Sea-Nymphs with their Song, so great a coyle doe keepe, They cease not to resound it over all the Deepe, And acted it each day before the Isle of Man, Who like an Empresse sits in the Virgivian, The Calfe of Man, a little Island.By her that hath the Calfe, long Walney, and the Pyle, As Hand-mayds to attend on her their Soveraigne Isle, To whom, so many though the Hebrides doe show, Acknowlege, that to her they due subjection owe: With Corne and Cattell stor'd, and what for hers is good, (That we, nor Ireland, need not scorne her neighbourhood) Her midst with Mountaines set, of which, from A mountaine in the Isle of Man. Sceafels height, A cleere and perfect eye, the weather being bright, (Be Neptunes visage ne'r so terrible and sterne) The Scotch, the Irish Shores, and th'English may discerne; And what an Empire can, the same this Island brings Her Pedigrees to show, her right successive Kings, Her Chronicles and can as easily rehearce, And with all forraine parts to have had free commerce; Her Municipiall Lawes, and Customes very old, Belonging to her State, which strongly shee doth hold: This Island, with the Song of Lun is taken so, As shee hath speciall cause before all other, who For her bituminous Turfe, squar'd from her Mossy ground, And Trees farre under earth, (by daily digging found, As for the store of Oats, which her blacke Gleabe doth beare, In every one of these resembling Lancashire, To her shee'l stoutly stick, as to her neerest kin, And cries the day is ours, brave Lancashire doth win. But yet this Isle of Man more seemes not to rejoyce For Lancashires good luck, nor with a louder voyce To sound it to the Shores; then Furnesse whose sterne face, With Mountaines set like Warts, which Nature as a grace Bestow'd upon this Tract, whose Browes doe looke so sterne, That when the Nymphs of Sea did first her Front discerne, Amazedly they fled, to Amphitrite's Bower. Her grim aspect to see, which seem'd to them so sower, As it malign'd the Rule which mighty Neptune bare, Whose Fells to that grim god, most sterne and dreadfull are, With Hills whose hanging browes, with Rocks about are bound, Whose weighty feet stand fixt in that blacke beachy ground, Whereas those scattered trees, which naturally pertake, The fatnesse of the soyle (in many a slimy Lake, Their roots so deeply sok'd) send from their stocky bough, A soft and sappy Gum, from which those Tree-geese grow, Call'd Barnacles by us, which like a Jelly first To the beholder seeme, then by the fluxure nurst, Still great and greater thrive, untill you well may see Barnacles one of the British Wonders. Them turn'd to perfect Fowles, when dropping from the tree Into the Meery Pond, which under them doth lye, Waxe ripe, and taking wing, away in flockes doe flye; Which well our Ancients did among our Wonders place: Besides by her strong Scite, she doth receave this grace, Before her neighbouring Tracts, (which Fournesse well may vaunt) That when the Saxons here their forces first did plant, And from the Inner-land the ancient Britains drave, To their distrest estate it no lesse succour gave, Then the trans-Severn'd Hills, which their old stocke yet stores, Which now we call the Welsh, or the Cornubian Shores. What Countrey lets ye see those soyles within her Seat, But shee in little hath, what it can shew in great? As first without her selfe at Sea to make her strong, (Yet how soe'r expos'd, doth still to her belong) And fence her furthest poynt, from that rough Neptunes rage, The Isle of Walney lyes, whose longitude doth swage His fury when his waves, on Furnesse seeme to warre, Whose crooked back is arm'd with many a rugged A scarre is a Rock. scarre Against his boystrous shocks, which this defensive Isle Of Walney still assayle, that shee doth scorne the while, Which to assist her hath the Pyle of Fouldra set, And Fulney at her backe, a pretty Insulet, Which all their forces bend, their Furnesse safe to keepe: But to his inner earth, divert we from the deepe, Where those two mightie Meres, out-stretcht in length do wander, The lesser Thurstan nam'd, the famouser Wynander, So bounded with her Rocks, as Nature would descry, By her how those great Seas Mediterranean lye. To Sea-ward then shee hath her sundry Sands agen, As that of Dudden first, then Levin, lastly Ken, Of three bright Naiades nam'd, as Dudden on the West, That Cumberland cuts off from this Shire, doth invest Those Sands with her proud Style, when Levin from the Fells, Besides her naturall source, with the abundance swells, Which those two mighty Meres, upon her either side Contribute by recourse, that out of very pride, Shee leaves her ancient name, and Fosse her selfe doth call, Till comming to the Sands, even almost at her fall, On them her ancient Style shee liberally bestowes. Upon the East from these, cleere Ken her beautie showes, From Kendale comming in, which shee doth please to grace, First with her famous Type, then lastly in her race, Her name upon those Sands doth liberally bequeath, Whereas the Muse awhile may sit her downe to breath, And after walke along tow'rds Yorkshire on her way, On which shee strongly hopes to get a noble day. The eight and twentieth Song. The Argument. Invention hence her Compasse steeres, Towards Yorke the most renown'd of Shires, Makes the three Ridings in their Stories, Each severally to shew their glories. Ouse for her most-lov'd Cities sake, Doth her Dukes Title undertake; His Floods then Humber welcomes in, And showes how first he did begin. The Muse from Blackstonedge, no whit dismaid at all, With sight of the large Shire, on which shee was to fall, (Whose Forrests, Hils, &amp; Floods, then long for her arive From Lancashire, that lookt her Beauties to contrive) Doth set her selfe to sing, of that above the rest A Kingdome that doth seeme, a Province at the least, To them that thinke themselves no simple Shires to be; But that wherein the world her greatnesse most may see, And that which doth this Shire before the rest preferre, Is of so many Floods, and great, that rise from her, Except some silly few out of her Verge that flow, So neere to other Shires, that it is hard to know, If that their Springs be hers, or others them divide, And those are onely found upon her Setting side. Else be it noted well, remarkeable to all, A great bravery of Yorkshire. That those from her that flow, in her together fall. Nor can small praise beseeme so beautious Brooks as these, For from all other Nymphs these be the Nayades, In Amphitrites Bower, that princely places hold, To whom the Orkes of Sea dare not to be so bold, As rudely once to touch, and wheresoere they come, The Tritons with their Trumps proclaime them publique roome. Now whiles the Muse prepares these Floods along to lead, The wide West-riding first, desires that shee may plead The right that her belongs, which of the Muse she winnes, The West Ridings oration. When with the course of Don, thus she her Tract begins. Thou first of all my Floods, whose Banks doe bound my South, And offrest up thy Streame to mightie Humbers mouth, Much Ewe and Elme upon the Bank of Don.Of Ewe, and climing Elme, that crown'd with many a spray, From thy cleare Fountaine first through many a Mead dost play, Till Rother, whence the name of Rotheram first begun, At that her christened Towne doth loose her in my Don, Which proud of her recourse, tow'rds Doncaster doth drive, Her greatst and chiefest towne, the name that doth derive From Don's neere bordering Banks, when holding on her race, Shee dancing in and out, indenteth Hatfield Chase, Whose bravery hourely adds, new honors to her Banke: When Sherwood sends her in slow Iddle, that made ranke With her profuse excesse, shee largely it bestowes On Marshland, whose swolne wombe with such abundance flowes, As that her batning brest, her Fatlings sooner feeds, And with more lavish waste, then oft the Grasier needs: Whose soyle, as some report, that be her Borderers note, With th'water under earth undoubtedly doth flote: For when the waters rise, it risen doth remaine A strange opinion held by those of the neighboring Villages.High whilst the Floods are high, and when they fall againe, It falleth: but at last, when as my lively Don, Along by Marshlands side, her lusty course hath runne, The little wandring Went, wonne by the lowd report Of the magnifique State, and height of Humbers Court, Drawes on to meet with Don, at her approch to Aire: Now speake I of a Flood, who thinks there's none should dare (Once) to compare with her, supposd by her discent, The darling daughter borne of loftie Penigent, Who from her fathers foot, by Skipton downe doth scud, And leading thence to Leeds, that delicatest Flood, Takes Caldor comming in by Wakefield, by whose force, As from a lusty Flood, much strengthened in her course; But Caldor as shee comes, and greater still doth wax, Beheading, which we call Halifax Law.And travelling along by Heading-Halifax, Which Horton once was cald, but of a Virgins haire, (A Martyr that was made, for Chastity, that there Was by her Lover slaine) being fastned to a tree: The people that would needs it should a Relique be, It Halifax since nam'd, which in the Northerne tongue, Is Holy haire: but thence as Caldor comes along, It chanc'd shee in her Course on Kirkbey cast her eye, Robin Hoods burying place. Where merry Robbin Hood, that honest Thiefe doth lye, Beholding fitly too before how Wakefield stood, Shee doth not onely thinke of lustie Robin Hood, But of his merry man, the Pindar of the Towne Of Wakefield, George a Greene, whose fames so farre are blowne, For their so valiant fight, that every free mans Song, Can tell you of the same, quoth she be talk'd on long, For yee were merry Lads, and those were merry dayes; When Aire to Caldor calls, and bids her come her wayes, Who likewise to her helpe, brings Hebden, a small Rill: Thus Aire holds on her course tow'rds Humber, till she fill Her fall with all the wealth that Don can her affoord. Quoth the West-riding thus, with Rivers am I stor'd. Next guide I on my Wharfe, the great'st in her degree, And that I well may call the worthiest of the three, Who her full fountaine takes from my wast Westerne wild, (Whence all but Mountaineers, by Nature are exild) On Langstrethdale, and lights at th'entrance of her race, When keeping on her course, along through Barden Chase, Shee watreth Wharfdales breast, which proudly beares her name; For by that time shees growne a flood of wondrous fame, When Washbrooke with her wealth her Mistris doth supply; Thus Wharfe in her brave course imbracing Wetherby, See to the 22. Song. Small Cock, a sullen Brooke comes to her succour then, Whose Banks receav'd the blood of many thousand men, On sad Palme-Sunday slaine, that Towton-Field we call, Whose Channell quite was chok'd with those that there did fall, That Wharfe discolored was with gore, that then was shed, The bloodiest field betwixt the White Rose, and the Red, Of welneere fifteene fought in England first and last: But whilst the goodly Wharfe doth thus tow'rds Humber haste, From Wharnside Hill not farre, outflowes the nimble Nyde, Through Nydersdale along, as neatly she doth glide Tow'rds Knarsburg on her way, a pretty little Rill, Call'd Kebeck, stowes her streame, her Mistris Banks to fill, To intertaine the Whafe where that brave Knarsborough Forrest. Forrest stands, Entitled by the Towne, who with upreared hands Makes signes to her of joy, and doth with Garlands crowne The River passing by; but Wharfe that hasteth downe To meet her Mistris Ouse, her speedy course doth hie; Dent, Rother, Rivell, Gret, so on my Set have I, Which from their fountaines there all out of me do flow, Yet from my bounty I on Lancashire bestow, Because my rising soyle doth shute them to the West: But for my Mountaines I, will with the Isle contest, All other of the North in largenesse shall exceed, That ages long before it finally decreed, Pendle Hill is neere upon the verge of this Tract, but standeth in Lancashire.That Ingleborow Hill, Pendle, and Penigent, Should named be the high'st betwixt our Tweed and Trent. My Hills, brave Whelpston then, thou Wharnside, and thou Cam, Since I West-Riding still your onely mother am; All that Report can give, and justly is my due, I as your naturall Dam, share equally with you; And let me see a Hill that to the North doth stand, The proudest of them all, that dare but lift a hand O'r Penigent to peere; not Skiddo, that proud Mount, Although of him so much, Rude Cumberland account, Nor Cheviot, of whose height Northumberland doth boast Scotland. Albania to survey; nor those from Coast to Coast That welneere runne in length, that rew of Mountaines tall, By th'name of th'English Alpes, that our most learned call; As soone shall those, or these remove out of their place, As by their lofty lookes, my Penigent out-face: Yee thus behold my Hills: my Forrests, Dales, and Chases Upon my spacious breast note too how Nature places, Farre up into my West, first Langstrethdale doth lye, And on the Banke of Wharfe, my pleasant Bardon by, With Wharfdale hard by her, as taking hand in hand: Then lower tow'rds the Sea brave Knarsborough doth stand, As higher to my North, my Niddersdale by Nyde, And Bishopsdale above upon my Setting side, Marshland, and Hatfield Chase, my Easterne part doe bound, And Barnsdale there doth butt on Dons wel-watred ground: And to my great disgrace, if any shall object That I no wonder have that's worthy of respect In all my spacious Tract, let them (so wise) survey My Ribbles rising Banks, their worst, and let them say; The Metamorphosis of that Fountaine.At Giggleswick where I a Fountaine can you show, That eight times in a day is sayd to ebbe and flow, Who sometime was a Nymph, and in the Mountaines hye Of Craven, whose blew heads for Caps put on the Skye, Amongst Nymphs of the Mountaines. th'Oread's there, and Sylvans made abode, (It was e'r humane foot upon those Hills had trod) Of all the Mountaine kind and since she was most faire, It was a Satyrs chance to see her silver haire Flow loosely at her backe, as up a Cliffe she clame, Her Beauties noting well, her Features, and her Frame, And after her he goes; which when she did espie, Before him like the winde, the nimble Nymph doth flie, They hurry downe the Rocks, o'r Hill and Dale they drive; To take her he doth straine, t'outstrip him shee doth strive, Like one his kind that knew, and greatly fear'd his Rape, And to the The supposed Genius of the place. Topick gods by praying to escape, They turn'd her to a Spring, which as she then did pant, When wearied with her course, her breath grew wondrous scant: Even as the fearefull Nymph, then thicke and short did blow, Now made by them a Spring, so doth shee ebbe and flow. And neere the Streame of Nyde, another Spring have I, As well as that, which may a wonders place supply, Which of the forme it beares, men Dropping well doe call, Because out of a Rock, it still in drops doth fall, Neere to the foot whereof it makes a little Pon, Which in as little space converteth Wood to Stone, Chevin, and Kilnsey Crags, were they not here in me, In any other place, right well might Wonders be, For their Gygantick height, that Mountaines doe transcend? But such are frequent here, and thus she makes an end. When Your thus having heard the Genius of this Tract, Your, the chiefest River of Yorkshire, who after her long course, by the confluence of other floods, gets the name of Ouse. Her well-deserved praise so happily to act, This River in her selfe that was extreamely loth, The other to deferre, since that shee was to both Indifferent, straitly wills West-riding there to cease; And having made a signe to all the watry prease For silence; which at once, when her commaund had wonne, The proud North-Riding thus for her great selfe begunne. My soveraigne Flood, quoth shee, in nature thou art bound The North-Ridings Oration. T'acknowledge me of three to be the worthiest ground: For note of all those Floods, the wild West-Riding sends, Ther's scarcely any one thy greatnesse that attends, Till thou hast passed Yorke, and drawest neere thy fall; And when thou hast no need of their supplies at all, Then come they flattring in, and will thy followers be; The Simily.So as you oftentimes these wretched worldlings see, That whilst a man is poore, although some hopes depend Upon his future age, yet ther's not one will lend A farthing to releeve his sad distressed state, Not knowing what may yet befall him; but when Fate Doth poure upon his head his long expected good, Then shall you see those Slaves, aloofe before that stood, And would have let him starve, like Spaniels to him crouch, And with their glavering lips, his very feet to touch: So doe they by thee Your; whereas the Floods in me, That spring and have their Course, (even) give thy life to thee: For till that thou and Swale, into one Banke doe take, Meeting at Borough-Bridge, thy greatnesse there to make: Till then the name of Ouse thou art not knowne to owe, A tearme in former times the Ancients did bestow On many a full-bankt Flood; but for my greater grace, These Floods of which I speake, I now intend to trace From their first springing Founts, beginning with the Your, From Morvils mightie foot which rising, with the power That Bant from Sea-mere brings, her somewhat more doth fill, Neere Bishops-dale at hand, when Cover a cleere Rill, Next commeth into Your, whereas that lustie Chace For her lov'd Covers sake, doth lovingly embrace Your as shee yeelds along, amongst the Parks and Groves, In Middlehams amorous eye, as wandringly shee roves, At Rippon meets with Skell, which makes to her amaine, Whom when she hath receav'd into her Nymphish traine, Rippon Fayre.(Neere to that towne so fam'd, for Colts there to be bought, For goodnesse farre and neere, by Horsemen that are sought) Fore-right upon her way shee with a merryer gale, To Borough Bridge makes on, to meet her sister Swale, The reason why Swale is called Holy.(A wondrous holy Flood (which name she ever hath) For when the Saxons first receav'd the Christian Faith, Paulinus of old Yorke, the zealous Bishop then, In Swales abundant streame Christned ten thousand men, With women and their babes, a number more beside, Upon one happy day, whereof shee boasts with pride) Which springs not farre from whence Your hath her silver head; And in her winding Banks along my bosome led, As shee goes swooping by, to Swaledale whence shee springs, That lovely name shee leaves, which foorth a Forrest brings, The Vallies Style that beares, a braver Sylvan Mayd, Scarce any Shire can show; when to my Rivers ayd, Come Barney, Arske, and Marske, their soveraigne Swale to guide, From Applegarths wide waste, and from New Forrest side. Whose Fountaines by the Fawnes, and Satyrs, many a yeere, With youthfull Greens were crownd, yet could not stay them there, But they will serve the Swale, which in her wandring course, A Nymph nam'd Holgat hath, and Risdale, all whose force, Small though (God wot) it be, yet from their Southerne shore, With that salute the Swale, as others did before, At Richmond and arive, which much doth grace the Flood, Richmondshire within Yorkeshire. For that her Precinct long amongst the Shires hath stood: But Yorkshire wills the same her glory to resigne. When passing thence the Swale, this mineon Flood of mine Next takes into her traine, cleere Wiske, a wanton Gyrle, As though her watry path were pav'd with Orient Pearle, So wondrous sweet she seemes, in many a winding Gyre, As though shee Gambolds made, or as she did desire, Her Labyrinth-like turnes, and mad Meandred trace, With marvell should amaze, and comming doth imbrace A Countie within Yorke-Shire. North-Alerton, by whom her honour is increast, Whose Liberties include a County at the least, To grace the wandring Wiske, then well upon her way, Which by her count'nance thinks to carry all the sway; When having her receav'd, Swale bonny Codbeck brings, And Willowbeck with her, two pretty Rivellings, And Bedall bids along, then almost at the Ouze, Who with these Rills enrich'd begins her selfe to rouse. When that great Forrest-Nymph faire Gautresse on her way, Shee sees to stand prepar'd, with Garlands fresh and gay To decke up Ouze, before her selfe to Yorke she show, So out of my full wombe the Fosse doth likewise flow, That meeting thee at Yorke, under the Cities side, Her glories with thy selfe doth equally divide, The East part watring still, as thou dost wash the West, By whose Imbraces Yorke aboundantly is blest. So many Rivers I continually maintaine, As all those lesser Floods that into Darwin straine, Their Fountaines find in me, the Ryedale naming Rye, Fosse, Rycall, Hodbeck, Dow, with Semen, and them by Cleere Costwy, which her selfe from Blackmore in doth bring, And playing as shee slides through shady Pickering, To Darwent homage doth; and Darwent that divides The East-riding and me, upon her either sides, Although that to us both, she most indifferent bee, And seemeth to affect her equally with me, From my Division yet her Fountaine doth derive, And from my Blackmore here her Course doth first contrive. Let my Demensions then be seriously pursude, And let great Britaine see in my brave Latitude, How in the high'st degree, by nature I am grac'd; For tow'rds the Craven Hills, upon my West are plac'd New-Forrest, Applegarth, and Swaledale, Nymphs of the Woods. Dryades all, And lower towards the Ouze, if with my Floods ye fall, The goodly Gautresse keeps chiefe of my Sylvan kind, There stony Stanmore view, bleake with the Sleet and Wind, Upon this Easterne side, so Ryedale darke and deepe, Amongst whose Groves of yore, some say that Elves did keepe; Then Pickering, whom the Fawnes beyond them all adore, By whom not farre away lyes large-spred Blackimore, The Cleeveland North from these, a State that doth maintaine, Leaning her lustie side to the great Germane Maine, Which if she were not heere confined thus in me, A Shire even of her selfe might well be said to be. Nor lesse hath Pickering Leigh, her libertie then this, North-Alerton a Shire so likewise reckoned is; And Richmond of the rest, the greatest in estate, A Countie justly call'd, that them accommodate; So I North-Riding am, for spaciousnesse renown'd, Our mother Yorkshires eld'st, who worthily is crown'd The Queene of all the Shires, on this side Trent, for we The Ridings severall parts of her vaste greatnesse be, In us, so we againe have severall seats, whose bounds Doe measure from their sides so many miles of grounds, A Simily of Yorkshire.That they are called Shires; like to some mightie King, May Yorkshire be compar'd, (the lik'st of any thing) Who hath Kings that attend, and to his State retaine, And yet so great, that they have under them againe Great Princes, that to them be subject, so have we Shires subject unto us, yet wee her subjects be; Although these be ynough sufficiently to show, That I the other two for bravery quite out-goe: Yet looke yee up along into my Setting side, Where Teis first from my bounds, rich The Bishoprick of Durham. Dunelme doth divide, And you shall see those Rills, that with their watry prease, Their most beloved Teis so plenteously increase, The cleere yet lesser Lune, the Bauder, and the Gret, All out of me doe flow; then turne ye from the Set, And looke but tow'rds the Rise, upon the German Maine, Those Rarities, and see, that I in me containe; My Scarborough, which looks as though in heaven it stood, A Catalogue of the wonders of the North-Riding. To those that lye below, from th'Bay of Robin Hood, Even to the fall of Teis; let me but see the man, That in one Tract can show the wonders that I can, Like Whitbies selfe I thinke, ther's none can shew but I, O'r whose attractive earth there may no Wild-geese flie, But presently they fall from off their wings to ground: If this no wonder be, wher's there a wonder found, And stones like Serpents there, yet may yee more behold, That in their naturall Gyres are up together rold. The Rocks by Moultgrave too, my glories forth to set, Out of their cranied Cleeves, can give you perfect Jet, And upon Huntclipnab, you every where may find, (As though nice Nature lov'd to vary in this kind) Stones of a Spherick forme of sundry Mickles fram'd, That well they Globes of stone, or bullets might be nam'd For any Ordnance fit: which broke with Hammers blowes, Doe headlesse Snakes of stone, within their Rounds enclose. Marke Gisboroughs gay Scite, where Nature seemes so nice, As in the same shee makes a second Paradice, Whose Soyle imbroydered is, with so rare sundry Flowers, Her large Okes so long greene, as Summer there her Bowers, Had set up all the yeare, her ayre for health refin'd, Her earth with Allome veines most richly intermin'd. In other places these might Rarities be thought, So common but in me, that I esteeme as nought. Then could I reckon up my Ricall, making on By Rydale, towards her dear-lov'd Darwent, who's not gone Farre from her pearly Springs, but under-ground she goes; As up towards Craven Hills, I many have of those, Amongst the cranied Cleeves, that through the caverns creepe, And dimbles hid from day, into the earth so deepe, That oftentimes their sight, the senses doth appall, Which for their horrid course, the people Helbecks call, Which may for ought I see, be with my Wonders set, And with much marvell seene: that I am not in debt To none that neigboureth me; nor ought can they me lend. When Darwent bad her stay, and there her speech to end, For that East-Riding cald, her proper cause to plead: For Darwent a true Nymph, a most impartiall Mayd, And like to both ally'd, doth will the last should have That priviledge, which time to both the former gave, The East-Ridings oration.And wills th'East-Riding then, in her owne cause to speake, Who mildly thus begins; Although I be but weake, To those two former parts, yet what I seeme to want In largenesse, for that I am in my Compasse scant, Yet for my Scite I know, that I them both excell; For marke me how I lye, yea note me very well, How in the East I raigne, (of which my name I take) And my broad side doe beare up to the German Lake, Which bravely I survey; then turne ye and behold Yorks Ould.Upon my pleasant breast, that large and spacious Ould Of Yorke that takes the name, that with delighted eyes, When he beholds the Sunne out of the Seas to rise, With pleasure feeds his Flocks, for which he scarse gives place To Cotswold, and for what becomes a Pastorall grace, Doth goe beyond him quite; then note upon my South, How all along the Shore, to mighty Humbers mouth, Rich Holdernesse I have, excelling for her graine, By whose much plentie I, not onely doe maintaine My selfe in good estate, but Shires farre off that lye, Up Humber that to Hull, come every day to buy, To me beholding are; besides, the neigbouring Townes, Upon the Verge whereof, to part her, and the Downes, Hull downe to Humber hasts, and takes into her Banke Some lesse but lively Rills, with waters waxing ranke, Shee Beverley salutes, whose beauties so delight The fayre-enamoured Flood, as ravisht with the sight, That shee could ever stay, that gorgeous Phane to view, The Church of Beverley. But that the Brooks, and Bournes, so hotly her pursue, To Kingston and convey, whom Hull doth newly name, Of Humber-bordring Hull, who hath not heard the fame: And for great Humbers selfe, I challenge him for mine: For whereas Fowlwy first, and Shelfleet doe combine, By meeting in their course, so courteously to twin, Gainst whom on th'other side, the goodly Trent comes in, From that especiall place, great Humber hath his raigne, The marks how farre he is called Humber. Beyond which hee's mine owne: so I my Course maintaine, From Kilnseys pyle-like poynt, along the Easterne shore, And laugh at Neptunes rage, when lowdl'est he doth rore, Till Flamborough jutt foorth into the German Sea. The length of the East-Riding upon the Sea. And as th'East-Riding more yet ready was to say, Ouse in her owne behalfe doth interrupt her speech, And of th'Imperious land doth liberty beseech, Since she had passed Yorke, and in her wandring race, By that faire Cities scite, received had such grace, Shee might for it declame, but more to honor Yorke, Shee who supposd the same to bee her onely worke, Still to renowne those Dukes, who strongly did pretend A title to the Crowne, as those who did descend From them that had the right, doth this Oration make, And to uphold their claime, thus to the Floods she spake. They very idly erre, who thinke that blood then spilt, Ouzes Oration. In that long-lasting warre, proceeded from the guilt, Of the proud Yorkists part; for let them understand, That Richard Duke of Yorke, whose brave and martiall hand The Title undertooke, by tyranny and might, The title of the house of Yorke to the Crowne. Sought not t'attaine the Crowne, but from succesfull right, Which still upheld his claime, by which his valiant sonne, Great Edward Earle of March, the Garland after wonne: For Richard Duke of Yorke, at Wakefield Battell slaine, Who first that title broach'd, in the sixt Henries raigne, From Edmond a fift sonne of Edward did descend, That justly he thereby no title could pretend, Before them com'n from Gaunt, well knowne of all to be, The fourth to Edward borne, and therefore a degree Before him to the Crowne; but that which did preferre His title, was the match with Dame Anne Mortimer, Of Roger Earle of March the daughter, that his claime, From Clarence the third sonne of great King Edward came, Which Anne deriv'd alone, the right before all other, Of the delapsed Crowne, from Philip her faire mother, Daughter and onely heire of Clarence, and the Bride To Edmond Earle of March; this Anne her daughter tide In wedlocke to the Earle of Cambridge, whence the right Of Richard as I said, which fell at Wakefield fight, Descended to his sonne, brave Edward after King, (Henry the sixt depos'd) thus did the Yorkists bring Their title from a straine, before the line of Gaunt, Whose issue they by Armes did worthily supplant. By this the Ouze perceav'd great Humber to looke grim; (For evermore shee hath a speciall eye to him) As though he much disdain'd each one should thus be heard, And he their onely King, untill the last deferd, At which hee seem'd to frowne; wherefore the Ouze off breaks, And to his confluent Floods, thus mighty Humber speaks. The Oration of Humber.Let Trent her tribute pay, which from their severall founts, For thirtie Floods of name, to me her King that counts, Be much of me belov'd, brave River; and from me, Receive those glorious Rites that Fame can give to thee. And thou Marsh-drowning Don, and all those that repaire With thee, that bringst to me thy easie ambling Aire, Embodying in one Banke: and Wharfe, which by thy fall Dost much augment my Ouze, let me embrace you all, My brave West-Riding Brooks, your King you need not scorne, Proud Nyades neither yee, North-Riders that are borne; My yellow-sanded Your, and thou my sister Swale, That dauncing come to Ouze, through many a daintie Dale, Doe greatly me inrich, cleare Darwent driving downe From Cleeveland; and thou Hull, that highly dost renowne Th'East-Riding by thy rise, doe homage to your King, And let the Sea-Nymphs thus of mighty Humber sing; That full an hundred Floods my watry Court maintaine, Which either of themselves, or in their greaters traine, Their Tribute pay to me; and for my princely name, From Humber King of Hunns, as anciently it came; So still I sticke to him: for from that Easterne King Once in me drown'd, as I my Pedigree doe bring: So his great name receives no prejudice thereby; For as he was a King, so know ye all that I Am King of all the Floods, that North of Trent doe flow; Then let the idle world no more such cost bestow, Nor of the muddy Nyle, so great a Wonder make, Though with her bellowing fall, shee violently take The neighbouring people deafe; nor Ganges so much praise, That where he narrowest is, eight miles in broadnesse layes His bosome, nor so much hereafter shall be spoke Of that (but lately found) Guyanian Orenoque, Whose A fall of water. Cateract a noyse so horrible doth keepe, That it even Neptune frights; what Flood comes to the Deepe, Then Humber that is heard more horribly to rore? For when my The roring of the waters, at the comming in of the Tyde. Higre comes, I make my either shore Even tremble with the sound, that I afarre doe send. No sooner of this speech had Humber made an end, But the applauding Floods sent foorth so shrill a shout, That they were eas'ly heard all Holdernesse about, Above the Beachy Brack, amongst the Marshes rude, When the East-Riding her Oration to conclude, Goes on; My Sisters boast that they have little Shires Their subjects, I can shew the like of mine for theirs; My Howdon hath as large a Circuit, and as free, A Liberty in the East-riding. On Ouse, and Humbers banks, and as much graceth me, My Latitude compar'd with those that me oppugne: Not Richmond nor her like, that doth to them belong, Doth grace them more then this doth me, upon my coast, And for their wondrous things, whereof so much they boast, Upon my Easterne side, which jutts upon the Sea, Amongst the white-scalp'd Cleeves, this wonder see they may, Some wonders of the East-Riding. The Mullet, and the Awke, (my Fowlers there doe finde) Of all great Britain brood, Birds of the strangest kind, That building in the Rocks, being taken with the hand, And cast beyond the Cliffe, that poynteth to the land, Fall instantly to ground, as though it were a stone, But put out to the Sea, they instantly are gone, And flye a league or two before they doe returne, As onely by that ayre, they on their wings were borne. Then my Prophetick Spring at Veipsey, I may show, That some yeares is dry'd up, some yeares againe doth flow; But when it breaketh out with an immoderate birth, It tells the following yeare of a penurious dearth. Here ended shee her speech, the Ridings all made friends, And from my tyred hand, my labored Canto ends. The nine and twentieth Song The Argument. The Muse the Bishopricke assayes, And to her fall sings downe the Teis, Then takes shee to the dainty Wer, And with all braveries fitted her. Tyne tells the Victories by us got, In foughten Fields against the Scot. Then through Northumberland shee goes, The Floods and Mountaines doth dispose; And with their glories doth proceed, Not staying till shee come to Tweed. The Muse this largest Shire of England having sung, Yet seeing more then this did to her taske belong, Looks still into the North, the Bishopricke and viewes, The Bishoprick of Durham. Which with an eager eye, whilst wistly she pursues, Teis as a bordering Flood, (who thought her selfe divine) Confining in her Course that Countie Palatine, And Yorke the greatest Shire doth instantly begin, To rouze her selfe; quoth shee, Doth every Rillet win Applause for their small worth's, and I that am a Queene, With those poore Brooks compar'd, shall I alone be seene Thus silently to passe, and not be heard to sing, When as two Countries are contending for my Spring: Teis springeth out of Stanmore, which lyeth almost equally between Cumberland, &amp; Northumberland. For Cumberland, to which the Cumri gave the name, Accounts it to be hers, Northumberland the same, Will needsly hers should bee, for that my Spring doth rise, So equally twixt both, that he were very wise, Could tell which of these two, me for her owne may claime. But as in all these Tracts, there's scarce a Flood of fame, But shee some Vally hath, which her brave name doth beare: My Teisdale, nam'd of me, so likewise have I heare, At my first setting foorth, through which I nimbly slide; Then Yorkshire which doth lye upon my Setting side, Me Lune and Bauder lends, as in the Song before Th'industrious Muse hath shew'd; my The Bishoprick of Durham. Dunelmenian shore, Sends Huyd to helpe my course, with some few other Becks, Which time (as it should seeme) so utterly neglects, That they are namelesse yet; then doe I bid adiew, To Bernards battelled Towers, and seriously pursue My course to Neptunes Court, but as forthright I runne, The Skern, a dainty Nymph, saluting Darlington, Comes in to give me ayd, and being prowd and ranke, Shee chanc'd to looke aside, and spieth neere her Banke, Three blacke and horrid pits, which for their boyling heat, (That from their lothsome brimms, doe breath a sulpherous swet Hell-kettles rightly cald, that with the very sight, This Water-Nymph, my Skern is put in such affright, That with unusuall speed, she on her Course doth hast, And rashly runnes her selfe into my widened waste. In pompe I thus approch great Amphetrites state. But whilst Teis undertooke her Story to relate, Wer waxeth almost wood, that she so long should stand Upon those loftie tearmes, as though both sea and land Were tyde to heare her talke: quoth Wer, what wouldst thou say, Vaine-glorious bragging Brooke, hadst thou so cleere a way T'advance thee as I have, hadst thou such meanes and might, How wouldst thou then exult? O then to what a height Wouldst thou put up thy price? hadst thou but such a Trine Of Rillets as I have, which naturally combine, Their Springs thee to beget, as these of mine doe me, In their consenting sounds, that doe so well agree? As Kellop comming in from Kellop-Law her Syre, A Mountaine much in fame, small Wellop doth require, With her to walke along, which Burdop with her brings. Thus from the full conflux of these three severall Springs My greatnesse is begot, as Nature meant to show My future strength and state; then forward doe I flow Through my delicious Dale, with every pleasure rife, And Wyresdale still may stand, with Teisdale for her life: Comparing of their Scites, then casting on my Course, So satiate with th'excesse of my first naturall source, As petty Bournes and Becks, I scorne but once to call, Wascrop a wearish Gyrle, of name the first of all, That I vouchsafe for mine, untill that I arive At Aukland, where with force me forward still to drive, Cleere Gauntlesse gives her selfe, when I begin to gad, And whirling in and out, as I were waxed mad, I change my posture oft, to many a Snakie Gyre, To my first fountaine now, as seeming to retyre: Then suddenly againe I turne my watry trayle, Now I endent the earth, and then I it engrayle With many a turne and trace, thus wandring up and downe, Brave Durham I behold, that stately seated Towne, That Dunholme hight of yore (even) from a Desart wonne, Whose first foundation Zeale, and Piety begun, By them who thither first Saint Cutberts body brought, To save it from the Danes, by fire and sword that sought Subversion of those things, that good and holy were, With which beloved place, I seeme so pleased here, As that I clip it close, and sweetly hug it in My cleare and amorous armes, as jealous time should win Me further off from it, as our divorce to be. Hence like a lustie Flood most absolutely free, None mixing then with me, as I doe mix with none, But scorning a Colleague, nor neere me any one, To Neptunes Court I come; for note along the Strond, From Hartlepoole (even) to the poynt of Sunderland, As farre as A Mountaine on that part of the Shire. Wardenlaws can possibly survey; There's not a Flood of note hath entrance to the sea. Here ended shee her Speech, when as the goodly Tyne, (Northumberland that parts from this Shire Palatine) Which patiently had heard, looke as before the Wer Had taken up the Teis, so Tyne now takes up her, For her so tedious talke, Good Lord (quoth she) had I No other thing wherein my labor to imply, But to set out my selfe, how much (well) could I say, In mine owne proper praise, in this kind every way As skilfull as the best; I could if I did please, Of my two Fountaines tell, which of their sundry wayes, The South and North are nam'd, entitled both of Tyne, As how the prosperous Springs of these two Floods of mine Are distant thirty miles, how that the South-Tyne nam'd, From Stanmore takes her Spring, for Mines of Brasse that's fam'd, How that nam'd of the North, is out of Wheel-fell sprung, Amongst these English Alpes, which as they runne along, England, and Scotland here impartially divide. How South-Tyne setting out from Cumberland is plide, With Hartley which her hasts, and Tippall that doth strive, By her more sturdy Streame, the Tyne along to drive; How th'Allans, th'East, and West, their bounties to her bring, Two faire and full-brim'd Floods, how also from her Spring, My other North-nam'd Tyne, through Tyndale maketh in, Which Shele her Hand-mayd hath, and as she hasts to twin With th'other from the South, her sister, how cleere Rhead, With Perop comes prepar'd, and Cherlop, me to lead, Through Ridsdale on my way, as farre as Exham, then Dowell me Homage doth, with blood of Englishmen, Whose Streame was deeply dy'd in that most cruell warre Of Lancaster and Yorke. Now having gone so farre, Their strengths me their deare Tyne, doe wondrously enrich, As how cleere Darwent drawes downe to Newcastle, which The honour hath alone to entertaine me there, As of those mighty ships, that in my mouth I beare, Fraught with my country Coale, of this Newcastle Coale. Newcastle nam'd, For which both farre and neere, that place no lesse is fam'd, Then India for her Mynes; should I at large declare My glories, in which Time commands me to bee spare, And I but slightly touch, which stood I to report, As freely as I might, yee both would fall too short Of me; but know that Tyne hath greater things in hand: For, to tricke up our selves, whilst trifling thus we stand, Bewitch'd with our owne praise, at all we never note, How the Albanian Floods now lately set afloat, With th'honour to them done, take heart, and lowdly crie Defiance to us all, on this side Tweed that lye; And hearke the high-brow'd Hills alowd begin to ring, With sound of things that Forth prepared is to sing: When once the Muse arives on the Albanian shore; And therefore to make up our forces here before The on-set they begin, the Battels wee have got, Both on our earth and theirs, against the valiant Scot, I undertake to tell; then Muses I intreat Your ayd, whilst I these Fights in order shall repeat. When mighty Malcolme here had with a violent hand, (As he had oft before) destroy'd Northumberland, In Rufus troubled Raigne, the warlike Mowbray then, This Earledome that possest, with halfe the power of men, For conquest which that King from Scotland hither drew, At Anwick in the field their Armies overthrew; The Battell of Anwicke. Where Malcolme and his sonne, brave Edward both were found, Slaine on that bloody field: So on the English ground, When David King of Scots, and Henry his sterne sonne, Entitled by those times, the Earle of Huntingdon, Had forradg'd all the North, beyond the River Teis, In Stephens troubled raigne, in as tumultuous dayes As England ever knew, the Archbishop of Yorke, Stout Thurstan, and with him joynd in that warlike work, See to the 18. Song. Ralfe, (both for wit and Armes) of Durham Bishop then Renownd, that called were the valiant Clergy men, With th'Earle of Aubemarle, Especk, and Peverell, Knights, And of the Lacies two, oft try'd in bloody fights, Twixt Alverton and Yorke, the doubtfull battell got, The Battell of Alverton. On David and his sonne, whilst of th'invading Scot, Ten thousand strew'd the earth, and whilst they lay to bleed, Ours followed them that fled, beyond our sister Tweed. And when Henry the second. Fitz-Empresse next in Normandy, and here, And his rebellious sonnes in high combustions were, William the Scottish King, taking advantage then, The second Battell at Anwicke. And entring with an Host of eighty thousand men, As farre as Kendall came, where Captaines then of ours, Which ayd in Yorkshire raisd, with the Northumbrian powers, His forces overthrew, and him a prisoner led. So Longshanks, Scotlands scourge, him to that Country sped, Provoked by the Scots, that England did invade, And on the Borders here such spoyle and havock made, That all the land lay waste betwixt the Tweed and me. This most coragious King, from them his owne to free, Before proud Berwick set his puisant army downe, And tooke it by strong siege, since when that warlike towne, As Cautionary long the English after held. But tell me all you Floods, when was there such a Field By any Nation yet, as by the English wonne, The Battell at Halidon. Upon the Scottish power, as that of Halidon, Seaven Earles, nine hundred Horse, and of Foot-souldiers more, Neere twenty thousand slaine, so that the Scottish gore Ranne downe the Hill in streames (even) in Albania's sight. By our third Edwards prowesse, that most renowned Knight, As famous was that Fight of his against the Scot, As that against the French, which he at Cressy got. And when that conquering King did afterward advance His Title, and had past his warlike powers to France, And David King of Scots heere entred to invade, To which the King of France did that false Lord perswade, Against his given Faith, from France to draw his Bands, To keepe his owne at home, or to fill both his hands With warre in both the Realmes: was ever such a losse, The Battell at Nevils Crosse.To Scotland yet befell, as that at Nevills Crosse, Where fifteene thousand Scots their soules at once forsooke, Where stout John Copland then, King David prisoner tooke, I'th head of all his troups, that bravely there was seene. When English Philip, that brave Amazonian Queene, Encouraging her men, from troupe to troupe did ride, And where our Cleargy had their ancient Valour tride: Thus often comming in, they have gone out too short. The Battell of Nesbit.And next to this the fight of Nesbit I report, When Hebborn that stout Scot, and his had all their hire, Which in t'our Marches came, and with invasive fire, Our Villages laid waste, for which defeat of ours, When doughty Douglasse came with the Albanian powers, At Holmdon doe but see, the blow our Hotspurre gave To that bold daring Scot, before him how he drave His Armie, and with shot of our brave English Bowes, Did wound them on the backs, whose brests were hurt with blows, Ten thousand put to sword, with many a Lord and Knight, Some prisoners, wounded some, some others slaine outright, And entring Scotland then, all Tividale o'r-ran. The Battell of Flodden.Or who a braver field then th'Earle of Surrey wan, Where their King James the fourth himselfe so bravely bore, That since that age wherein he liv'd, nor those before, Yet never such a King in such a Battell saw, Amongst his fighting friends, where whilst he breath could draw, Hee bravely fought on foot, where Flodden Hill was strew'd With bodies of his men, welneere to mammocks hew'd, That on the Mountaines side, they covered neere a mile, Where those two valiant Earles of Lenox and Arguyle, Were with their Soveraigne slaine, Abbots, and Bishops there, Which had put Armor on, in hope away to beare The Victory with them, before the English fell. But now of other Fields, it fits the Muse to tell, A Road into Scotland by the Duke of Norfolke. As when the Noble Duke of Norfolke made a Road To Scotland, and therein his hostile fire bestow'd On welneere thirtie Townes, and staying there so long, Till victuall waxed weake, the Winter waxing strong, Returning over Tweed, his Booties home to bring, Which to the very heart did vex the Scottish King, The fortune of the Duke extreamely that did grutch, Remaining there so long, and doing there so much, Thinking to spoyle and waste, in England as before, The English men had done on the Albanian shore, And gathering up his force, before the English fled To Scotlands utmost bounds, thence into England sped, When that brave Bastard sonne of Dacres, and his friend, John Musgrave, which had charge the Marches to attend, With Wharton, a proud Knight, with scarce foure hundred Horse, Encountring on the Plaine with all the Scottish force, Thence from the Field with them, so many prisoners brought, Which in that furious fight were by the English caught, That there was scarce a Page or Lackey but had store, Earles, Barrons, Knights, Esquires, two hundred there and more, Of ordinary men, seven hundred made to yeeld, There scarcely hath been heard, of such a foughten field, That James the fifth to thinke, that but so very few, His universall power so strangely should subdue, So tooke the same to heart, that it abridg'd his life. Such foyles by th'English given, amongst the Scots were rife. These on the English earth, the English men did gaine; But when their breach of faith did many times constraine Our Nation to invade, and carry conquests in To Scotland; then behold, what our successe hath bin, Even in the latter end of our eight Henries dayes, Who Seymor sent by Land, and Dudley sent by Seas, With his full forces then, O Forth, then didst thou beare, That Navy on thy Streame, whose Bulke was fraught with feare, When Edenbrough and Leeth, into the ayre were blowne The Siege of Leeth. With Powders sulphurous smoke, &amp; twenty townes were throwne Upon the trampled earth, and into ashes trod; As int' Albania when we made a second Road, In our sixt Edwards dayes, when those two Martiall men, Which conquered there before, were thither sent agen: But for their high desarts, with greater Titles grac'd, The first created Duke of Somerset, the last The Earle of Warwicke made, at Muscleborough Field, Where many a doughty Scot that did disdaine to yeeld, Was on the earth layd dead, where as for five miles space In length, and foure in bredth, the English in the chase, With carkeises of Scots, strew'd all their naturall ground, The number of the slaine were fourteene thousand found, And fifteene hundred more ta'n Prisoners by our men. The Road into Scotland by the Earle of Sussex.So th'Earle of Sussex next to Scotland sent agen, To punish them by warre, which on the Borders here, Not onely rob'd and spoyl'd, but that assistants were To those two puisant Earles, Northumberland, who rose With Westmerland his Peere, suggested by the foes To great Eliza's raigne, and peacefull government; Wherefore that puisant Queene him to Albania sent, Who fiftie Rock-reard Pyles and Castles having cast Farre lower then their Scites, and with strong fires defac'd Three hundred townes, their wealth, with him worth carrying brought To England over Tweed, when now the floods besought The Tyne to hold her tongue, when presently began A rumour which each where through all the Country ran, Of this proud Rivers speech, the Hills and Floods among, And Lowes, a Forrest-Nymph, the same so lowdly sung, That it through Tindale straight, and quite through Ridsdale ran, And sounded shriller there, then when it first began, A repetition of the Hils parting Northumberland and Scotland, as they lye from South to North.That those high Alpine Hills, as in a row they stand, Receiv'd the sounds, which thus went on from hand to hand. The high-rear'd Red-Squire first, to Aumond Hill it told, When Aumond great therewith, nor for his life could hold, To Kembelspeth againe, the businesse but relate, To Black-Brea he againe, a Mountaine holding state With any of them all, to Cocklaw he it gave; And Cocklaw it againe, to Cheviot, who did rave With the report thereof, hee from his mighty stand, Resounded it againe through all Northumberland, That White-Squire lastly caught, and it to Berwick sent, That brave and warlike Towne, from thence incontinent, The sound from out the South, into Albania came, And many a lustie Flood, did with her praise inflame, Affrighting much the Forth, who from her trance awooke, And to her native strength her presently betooke, Against the Muse should come to the Albanian Coast. But Pictswall all this while, as though he had been lost, Picts wall. Not mention'd by the Muse, began to fret and fume, That every petty Brooke thus proudly should presume To talke; and he whom first the Romans did invent, And of their greatnesse yet, the longst-liv'd monument, Should this be over-trod; wherefore his wrong to wreake, In their proud presence thus, doth aged Pictswall speake. Me thinks that Offa's ditch in Cambria should not dare To thinke himselfe my match, who with such cost and care The Romans did erect, and for my safeguard set Their Legions, from my spoyle the proling Pict to let, That often In-roads made, our earth from them to win, By Adrian beaten back, so he to keepe them in, To Sea from East to West, begun me first a wall Of eightie myles in length, twixt Tyne and Edens fall: Long making mee they were, and long did me maintaine. Nor yet that Trench which tracts the Westerne Wiltshire Plaine, Of Woden, Wansdyke cal'd, should paralell with me, Comparing our descents, which shall appeare to be Mere upstarts, basely borne; for when I was in hand, The Saxon had not then set foot upon this land, Till my declining age, and after many a yeare, Of whose poore petty Kings, those the small labors were. That on Newmarket-Heath, made up as though but now, See to the 21. Song. Who for the Devils worke the vulgar dare avow, Tradition telling none, who truly it began, Where many a reverent Booke can tell you of my Man, And when I first decayd, Severus going on, What Adrian built of turfe, he builded new of stone; And after many a time, the Britans me repayr'd, To keepe me still in plight, nor cost they ever spar'd. Townes stood upon my length, where Garrisons were laid, Their limits to defend; and for my greater ayd, With Turrets I was built, where Sentinels were plac'd, To watch upon the Pict; so me my Makers grac'd, With hollow Pipes of Brasse, along me still that went, By which they in one Fort still to another sent, By speaking in the same, to tell them what to doe, And so from Sea to Sea could I be whispered through: Upon my thicknesse, three march'd eas'ly breast to breast, Twelve foot was I in height, such glory I possest. Old Pictswall with much pride thus finishing his plea, Had in his utmost course attain'd the Easterne Sea, Yet there was Hill nor Flood once heard to clap a hand; For the Northumbrian Nymphs had come to understand, That Tyne exulting late o'r Scotland in her Song, (Which over all that Realme report had loudly rung) The Calidonian The great River on which Edenborough standeth. Forth so highly had displeas'd, And many an other Flood, (which could not be appeas'd) That they had vow'd revenge, and Proclamation made, That in a learned warre the foe they would invade, And like stout Floods stand free from this supputed shame, Or conquered give themselves up to the English name: Which these Northumbrian Nymphs, with doubt &amp; terror strook, Which knew they from the foe, for nothing were to looke, But what by skill they got, and with much care should keepe, And therefore they consult by meeting in the Deepe, To be delivered from the ancient enemies rage, That they would all upon a solemne Pilgrimage The Holy Island.Unto the Holy-Isle, the vertue of which place, They knew could very much availe them in this case: For many a blessed Saint in former ages there, Secluded from the world, to Abstinence and Prayer, Had given up themselves, which in the German Maine, And from the shore not farre, did in it selfe conteine A Catalogue of the Rivers of Northumberland, as they run into the German sea, upon the East part of the countrey betwixt the Fals of Tyne and Tweed.Sufficient things for food, which from those holy men, That to devotion liv'd, and sanctimony then, It Holy-Isle was call'd, for which they all prepare, As I shall tell you how, and what their number are. With those the farthest off, the first I will begin, As Pont a pearlesse Brook, brings Blyth which putteth in With her, then Wansbeck next in wading to the Maine, Neere Morpet meet with Font, which followeth in her traine; Next them the little Lyne alone doth goe along, When Cocket commeth downe, and with her such a throng, As that they seeme to threat the Ocean; for with her Comes Ridley, Ridland next, with Usway, which preferre Their Fountaines to her Flood, who for her greater fame, Hath at her fall an Isle, call'd Cocket, of her name, As that great Neptune should take notice of her state; Then Alne by Anwicke comes, and with as proud a gate, As Cocket came before, for whom at her faire fall, (In bravery as to show, that she surpast them all) The famous Isle of Ferne, and Staples aptly stand, And at her comming foorth, doe kisse her Christall hand. Whilst these resolv'd upon their Pilgrimage, proceed, Till for the love shee beares to her deare Mistris Tweed, Of Bramish leaves the name, by which shee hath her birth; And though shee keepe her course upon the English earth, Yet Bowbent, a bright Nymph, from Scotland comming in, To goe with her to Tweed, the wanton Flood doth winne. Though at this headstrong Stream, proud Flodden from his height, Doth daily seeme to fret, yet takes he much delight Her lovelinesse to view, as on to Tweed she straines, Where whilst this Mountaine much for her sweet sake sustaines, This Canto we conclude, and fresh about must cast, Of all the English Tracts, to consummate the last. The thirtieth Song The Argument. Of Westmerland the Muse now sings, And fetching Eden from her Springs, Sets her along, and Kendall then Surveying, beareth backe agen; And climing Skidows loftie Hill, By many a River, many a Rill, To Cumberland, where in her way, Shee Copland calls, and doth display Her Beauties, backe to Eden goes, Whose Floods, and Fall shee aptly showes. Yet cheerely on my Muse, no whit at all dismay'd, But look aloft tow'rds heaven, to him whose powerfull ayd; Hath led thee on thus long, &amp; through so sundry soiles, Steep Mountains, Forrests rough, deepe Rivers, that thy toyles Most sweet refreshings seeme, and still thee comfort sent, Against the Bestiall Rout, and Boorish rabblement Of those rude vulgar sots, whose braines are onely Slime, Borne to the doting world, in this last yron Time, So stony, and so dull, that Orpheus which (men say) By the inticing Straines of his melodious Lay, Drew Rocks and aged Trees, to whether he would please; He might as well have moov'd the Universe as these; But leave this Frie of Hell in their owne filth defilde, And seriously pursue the sterne Westmerian Wilde, First ceazing in our Song, the South part of the Shire, See to the latter end of the 27. Song. Where Westmerland to West, by wide Wynander Mere, The Eboracean fields her to the Rising bound, Where Can first creeping forth, her feet hath scarcely found, But gives that Dale her name, where Kendale towne doth stand, For making of our Cloth scarce match'd in all the land. Then keeping on her course, though having in her traine, But Sput, a little Brooke, then Winster doth retaine, Tow'rds the Vergivian Sea, by her two mighty Falls, (Which the brave Roman tongue, her Catadupæ calls) This eager River seemes outragiously to rore, And counterfetting Nyle, to deafe the neighboring shore, To which she by the sound apparantly doth show, The season foule or faire, as then the wind doth blow: For when they to the North, the noyse doe easliest heare, They constantly affirme the weather will be cleere; And when they to the South, againe they boldly say, It will be clouds or raine the next approaching day. To the Hibernick Gulfe, when soone the River hasts, And to those queachy Sands, from whence her selfe she casts, She likewise leaves her name as every place where she, In her cleare course doth come, by her should honored be. But backe into the North from hence our course doth lye, As from this fall of Can, still keeping in our eye, See to the 27. Song.The source of long-liv'd Lun, I long-liv'd doe her call; For of the British Floods, scarce one amongst them all, Such state as to her selfe, the Destinies assigne, By christning in her Course a Countie Palatine, For Luncaster so nam'd, the Fort upon the Lun, And Lancashire the name from Lancaster begun: Yet though shee be a Flood, such glory that doth gaine, In that the British Crowne doth to her state pertaine, Yet Westmerland alone, not onely boasts her birth, But for her greater good the kind Westmerian earth, Cleere Burbeck her bequeaths, and Barrow to attend Her grace, till shee her name to Lancaster doe lend. With all the speed we can, to Cumberland we hye, (Still longing to salute the utmost Albany) By Eden, issuing out of Husseat-Morvill Hill, And pointing to the North, as then a little Rill, There simply takes her leave of her sweet sister Swale, Borne to the selfe same Sire, but with a stronger gale, The first place of note which shee runnes through.Tow'rds Humber hyes her course, but Eden making on, Through Malerstrang hard by, a Forrest woe begone In love with Edens eyes, of the cleere Naiades kind, Whom thus the Wood-Nymph greets: What passage shalt thou find My most beloved Brook, in making to thy Bay, That wandring art to wend through many a crooked way, Farre under hanging Hills, through many a cragged strait, And few the watry kind, upon thee to await, Opposed in thy course with many a rugged Cliffe, Besides the Northern winds against thy streame so stiffe, As by maine strength they meant to stop thee in thy course, And send thee easly back to Morvill to thy source. O my bright lovely Brooke, whose name doth beare the sound Of Gods first Garden-plot, th'imparadized ground, Wherein he placed Man, from whence by sinne he fell. O little blessed Brooke, how doth my bosome swell, With love I beare to thee, the day cannot suffice For Malerstang to gaze upon thy beautious eyes. This sayd, the Forrest rubd her rugged front the while, Cleere Eden looking back, regreets her with a smile, And simply takes her leave, to get into the Maine; When Below a bright Nymph, from Stanmore downe doth straine To Eden, as along to Appleby shee makes, Which passing, to her traine, next Troutbeck in shee takes, And Levenant, then these, a somewhat lesser Rill, When Glenkwin greets her well, and happily to fill, Her more abundant Banks, from Ulls, a mightie Mere On Cumberlands confines, comes Eymot neat and cleere, And Loder doth allure, with whom she haps to meet, Which at her comming in, doth thus her Mistris greet. Quoth shee, thus for my selfe I say, that where I swell Up from my Fountaine first, there is a Tyding-well, That daily ebbs and flowes, (as Writers doe report) The old Euripus doth, or in the selfe same sort, The Two fountains the one in the South, th'other in Northwales. Venedocian Fount, or the Two fountains the one in the South, th'other in Northwales. Demetian Spring, Or that which the cold Peake doth with her wonders bring, Why should not Loder then, her Mistris Eden please, With this, as other Floods delighted are with these. See to the 5. 10. and 27. Song. When Eden, though shee seem'd to make unusuall haste, About cleere Loders neck, yet lovingly doth cast Her oft infolding Armes, as Westmerland shee leaves, Where Cumberland againe as kindly her receives. Yet up her watry hands, to Winfield Forrest holds In her rough wooddy armes, which amorously infolds Cleere Eden comming by, with all her watry store, In her darke shades, and seemes her parting to deplore. But Southward sallying hence, to those Sea-bordring sands, Where Dudden driving downe to the Lancastrian lands, This Cumberland cuts out, and strongly doth confine, This meeting there with that, both meerly Maratine, Where many a daintie Rill out of her native Dale, To the Virgivian makes, with many a pleasant gale; As Eske her farth'st, so first, a coy bred Cumbrian Lasse, Who commeth to her Road, renowned Ravenglasse, By Devock driven along, (which from a large-brim'd Lake, To hye her to the Sea, with greater haste doth make) Meets Nyte, a nimble Brooke, their Rendevous that keepe In Ravenglasse, when soone into the blewish Deepe Comes Irt, of all the rest, though small, the richest Girle, Her costly bosome strew'd with precious Orient Pearle, Bred in her shining Shels, which to the deaw doth yawne, Which deaw they sucking in, conceave that lusty Spawne, Of which when they grow great, and to their fulnesse swell, They cast, which those at hand there gathering, dearly sell. This cleare pearle-paved Irt, Bleng to her harbor brings, From Copland comming downe, a Forrest-Nymph, which sings Her owne praise, and those Floods, their Fountains that derive From her, which to extoll, the Forrest thus doth strive. Yee Northerne Nymphes of the Forrest. Dryades all adorn'd with Mountaines steepe, Upon whose hoary heads cold Winter long doth keepe, Where often rising Hils, deepe Dales and many make, Where many a pleasant Spring, and many a large-spread Lake, Their cleere beginnings keepe, and doe their names bestow Upon those humble Vales, through which they eas'ly flow; Whereas the Mountaine Nymphs, and those that doe frequent The Fountaines, Fields, and Groves, with wondrous meriment, By Moone-shine many a night, doe give each other chase, At Hood-winke, Barley-breake, at Tick, or Prison-base, With tricks, and antique toyes, that one another mocke, That skip from Crag to Crag, and leape from Rocke to Rocke. Then Copland, of this Tract a corner, I would know, What place can there be found in Britan, that doth show A Surface more austere, more sterne from every way, That who doth it behold, he cannot chuse but say, Th'aspect of these grim Hills, these darke and mistie Dales, From clouds scarce ever cleer'd, with the strongst Northern gales Tell in their mighty Roots, some Minerall there doth lye, The Islands generall want, whose plenty might supply: Wherefore as some suppose of Copper Mynes in me, I Copper-land was cald, but some will have't to be From the old Britans brought, for Cop they use to call The tops of many Hils, which I am stor'd withall. Then Eskdale mine Ally, and Niterdale so nam'd, Of Floods from you that flow, as Borowdale most fam'd, With Wasdale walled in, with Hills on every side, Hows'ever ye extend within your wasts so wide, For th'surface of a soyle, a Copland, Copland cry, Till to your shouts the Hills with Ecchoes all reply. Which Copland scarce had spoke, but quickly every hill, Upon her Verge that stands, the neigbouring Vallies fill; Helvillon from his height, it through the Mountaines threw, From whom as soone againe, the sound Dunbalrase drew, From whose stone-trophied head, it on to Wendrosse went, Which tow'rds the Sea againe, resounded it to Dent, That Brodwater therewith within her Banks astound, In sayling to the Sea, told it in Egremound, Whose Buildings, walks, and streets, with Ecchoes loud and long, Did mightily commend old Copland for her Song. Whence soone the Muse proceeds, to find out fresher Springs, Where Darwent her cleere Fount from Borowdale that brings, Doth quickly cast her selfe into an ample Lake, And with Thurls mighty Mere, betweene them two doe make An The Isle of Darwent. Island, which the name from Darwent doth derive, Within whose secret breast nice Nature doth contrive, That mighty Copper Myne, which not without its Vaines, Of Gold and Silver found, it happily obtaines Of Royaltie the name, the richest of them all That Britan bringeth forth, which Royall she doth call. The Mynes Royall. Of Borowdale her Dam, of her owne named Isle, As of her Royall Mynes, this River proud the while, Keepes on her Course to Sea, and in her way doth win Cleere Coker her compeere, which at her comming in, Gives Coker-mouth the name, by standing at her fall, Into faire Darwents Banks, when Darwent therewithall, Runnes on her watry Race, and for her greater fame, Of Neptune doth obtaine a Haven of her name, When of the Cambrian Hills, proud Skiddo that doth show The high'st, respecting whom, the other be but low, Perceiving with the Floods, and Forrests, how it far'd, And all their severall tales substantially had heard, And of the Mountaine kind, as of all other he, Most like Pernassus selfe that is suppos'd to be, Having a double head, as hath that sacred Mount, Which those nine sacred Nymphs held in so hie account, Bethinketh of himselfe what he might justly say, When to them all he thus his beauties doth display. The rough Hibernian sea, I proudly overlooke, Amongst the scattered Rocks, and there is not a nooke, But from my glorious height into its depth I pry, Great Hills farre under me, but as my Pages lye; And when my Helme of Clouds upon my head I take, At very sight thereof, immediatly I make Th'Inhabitants about, tempestuous stormes to feare, And for faire weather looke, when as my top is cleere; Great Fournesse mighty Fells, I on my South survay: So likewise on the North, Albania makes me way, Her Countries to behold, when A Hill in Scotland. Scurfell from the skie, That Anadale doth crowne, with a most amorous eye, Salutes me every day, or at my pride lookes grim, Oft threatning me with Clouds, as I oft threatning him: So likewise to the East, that rew of Mountaines tall, Which we our English Alpes may very aptly call, That Scotland here with us, and England doe divide, As those, whence we them name upon the other side, Doe Italy, and France, these Mountaines heere of ours, That looke farre off like clouds, shap't with embattelled towers, Much envy my estate, and somewhat higher be, By lifting up their heads, to stare and gaze at me. Cleere Darwent dancing on, I looke at from above, As some enamoured Youth, being deeply struck in love, His Mistris doth behold, and every beauty notes; Who as shee to her fall, through Fells and Vallies flotes, Oft lifts her limber selfe above her Banks to view, How my brave by-clift top, doth still her Course pursue. O all yee Topick Gods, that doe inhabite here, To whom the Romans did, those ancient Altars reare, Oft found upon those Hills, now sunke into the Soyles, Which they for Trophies left of their victorious spoyles, Ye Genii of these Floods, these Mountaines, and these Dales, That with poore Shepheards Pipes, &amp; harmlesse Heardsmans tales Have often pleased been, still guard me day and night, And hold me Skidow still, the place of your delight. This Speech by Skidow spoke, the Muse makes forth againe, Tow'rds where the in-borne Floods, cleere Eden intertaine, To Cumberland com'n in, from the Westmerian wasts, Where as the readyest way to Carlill, as shee casts, Shee with two Wood-Nymphs meet, the first is great and wilde, And Westward Forrest hight; the other but a childe, Compared with her Phere, and Inglewood is cald, Both in their pleasant Scites, most happily instald. What Sylvan is there seene, and be she nere so coy, Whose pleasures to the full, these Nymphs doe not enjoy, And like Dianas selfe, so truly living chast? For seldome any Tract, doth crosse their waylesse waste, With many a lustie leape, the shagged Satyrs show Them pastime every day, both from the Meres below, And Hils on every side, that neatly hemme them in; The blushing morne to breake, but hardly doth begin, But that the ramping Goats, swift Deere, and harmelesse Sheepe, Which there their owners know, but no man hath to keepe, The Dales doe over-spread, by them like Motley made; But Westward of the two, by her more widened Slade, Of more abundance boasts, as of those mighty Mynes, Which in her Verge she hath: but that whereby she shines, Is her two daintie Floods, which from two Hils doe flow, Which in her selfe she hath, whose Banks doe bound her so Upon the North and South, as that she seemes to be Much pleased with their course, and takes delight to see How Elne upon the South, in sallying to the Sea Confines her: on the North how Wampull on her way, Her purlews wondrous large, yet limitteth againe, Both falling from her earth into the Irish Maine. No lesse is Westward proud of Waver, nor doth win Lesse praise by her cleere Spring, which in her course doth twin With Wiz, a neater Nymph scarce of the watry kind; And though shee be but small, so pleasing Wavers mind, That they entirely mix'd, the Irish Seas imbrace, But earnestly proceed in our intended Race. At Eden now arriv'd, whom we have left too long, Which being com'n at length, the Cumbrian hils among, As shee for Carlill coasts, the Floods from every where, Prepare each in their course, to entertaine her there, From Skidow her tall Sire, first Cauda cleerely brings In Eden all her wealth; so Petterell from her Springs, (Not farre from Skidows foot, whence dainty Cauda creeps) Along to overtake her Soveraigne Eden sweeps, To meet that great concourse, which seriously attend That dainty Cumbrian Queene; when Gilsland downe doth send Her Riverets to receive Queene Eden in her course, As Irthing comming in from her most plenteous source, Through many a cruell Crag, though she be forc'd to crawle, Yet working forth her way to grace her selfe with all, First Pultrosse is her Page, then Gelt shee gets her guide, Which springeth on her South, on her Septentrion side, Shee crooked Cambeck calls, to wait on her along, And Eden overtakes amongst the watry throng. To Carlill being come, cleere Bruscath beareth in, To greet her with the rest, when Eden as to win Her grace in Carlils sight, the Court of all her state, And Cumberlands chiefe towne, loe thus shee doth dilate. What giveth more delight, (brave Citie) to thy Seat, Then my sweet lovely selfe? a River so compleat, With all that Nature can a dainty Flood endow, That all the Northerne Nymphs me worthily allow, Of all their Nyades kind the neatest, and so farre Transcending, that oft times they in their amorous warre, See to the 29. Song.Have offered by my course, and Beauties to decide The mastery, with her most vaunting in her pride, That mighty Roman Fort, which of the Picts we call, But by them neere those times was stil'd Severus wall, Of that great Emperour nam'd, which first that worke began, Betwixt the Irish Sea, and German Ocean, The West end of the Picts wall.Doth cut me in his course neere Carlill, and doth end At Boulnesse, where my selfe I on the Ocean spend. And for my Country here, (of which I am the chiefe Of all her watry kind) know that shee lent reliefe, To those old Britains once, when from the Saxons they, For succour hither fled, as farre out of their way, Amongst her mighty Wylds, and Mountains freed from feare, And from the British race, residing long time here, Which in their Genuine tongue, themselves did Kimbri name, Why Cumberland so called. Of Kimbri-land, the name of Cumberland first came; And in her praise bee't spoke, this soyle whose best is mine, That Fountaine bringeth forth, from which the Southern Tyne, (So nam'd for that of North, another hath that stile) This to the Easterne Sea, that makes forth many a mile, Her first beginning takes, and Vent, and Alne doth lend, To wait upon her foorth; but further to transcend To these great things of note, which many Countries call Their wonders, there is not a Tract amongst them all, Can shew the like to mine, at the lesse Sakeld, neere To Edens Bank, the like is scarcely any where, Stones seventie seven stand, in manner of a Ring, Each full ten foot in height, but yet the strangest thing, Their equall distance is, the circle that compose, Within which other stones lye flat, which doe inclose The bones of men long dead, (as there the people say;) So neere to Loders Spring, from thence not farre away, Be others nine foot high, a myle in length that runne, The victories for which these Trophies were begun, From darke oblivion thou, O Time shouldst have protected; For mighty were their minds, them thus that first erected: And neere to this againe, there is a piece of ground, A little rising Bank, which of the Table round, Men in remembrance keepe, and Arthurs Table name. But whilst these more and more, with glory her inflame, Supposing of her selfe in these her wonders great, All her attending Floods, faire Eden doe entreat, To lead them downe to Sea, when Leven comes along, And by her double Spring, being mightie them among, There overtaketh Eske, from Scotland that doth hye, Faire Eden to behold, who meeting by and by, Downe from these Westerne Sands into the Sea doe fall, Where I this Canto end, as also therewithall My England doe conclude, for which I undertooke, This strange Herculean toyle, to this my thirtieth Booke.
