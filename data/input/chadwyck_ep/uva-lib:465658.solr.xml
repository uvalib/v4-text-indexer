      <field name="fulltext">VOL. I. TO RICHARD EARL GROSVENOR, VISCOUNT BELGRAVE, BARON GROSVENOR, THIS TRANSLATION OF JUVENAL IS INSCRIBED, AS AN HUMBLE, BUT SINCERE TESTIMONY, OF THE GRATITUDE AND RESPECT OF THE TRANSLATOR. May 1st, 1802. THE SATIRES OF JUVENAL. SATIRE I. Oh! heavens—while thus hoarse Codrus perseveres To force his Theseid on my tortured ears, Shall I not once attempt “to quit the score,” Always an auditor, and nothing more! Forever at my side, shall this rehearse, His elegiack, that his comick verse, Unpunish'd? shall huge Telephus, at will, The livelong day consume, or, huger still, Orestes, closely written, written, too, Down the broad marge, and yet—no end in view! Away, away!—None knows his home so well, As I the grove of Mars, and Vulcan's cell, Fast by the Æolian rocks!— How the Winds roar How ghosts are tortured on the Stygian shore, How Jason stole the golden fleece, and how, The Centaurs fought on Othrys' shaggy brow, The walks of Fronto echo round and round— The columns trembling with the eternal sound, While high and low, as the mad fit invades, Bellow the same trite nonsense through the shades. I, too, can write,—and, at a pedant's frown, Once pour'd my fustian rhetorick on the town; And idly proved that Sylla, far from power, Had pass'd, unknown to fear, the tranquil hour:— Now I resume my pen; for, since we meet Such swarms of desperate bards in every street, 'Tis vicious clemency, to spare the oil, And hapless paper they are sure to spoil. But why I choose, adventurous, to retrace The Auruncan's route, and, in the arduous race, Follow his burning wheels, attentive hear, If leisure serve, and truth be worth your ear. When the soft eunuch weds, and the bold fair Tilts at the Tuscan boar, with bosom bare; When one that oft, since manhood first appear'd, Has trimm'd the exuberance of this sounding beard, In wealth, outvies the senate; when a vile, A slave-born, slave-bred, vagabond of Nile, Crispinus, while he gathers now, now flings His purple open, fans his summer rings; And, as his fingers sweat beneath the freight, Cries, “Save me—from a gem of greater weight!” 'Tis hard a less adventurous course to choose, While folly plagues, and vice inflames the Muse. For who so slow of heart, so dull of brain, So patient of the town, as to contain His bursting spleen, when, full before his eye, Swings the new chair of lawyer Matho by, Cramm'd with himself! then, with no less parade, That caitiff's, who his noble friend betray'd, Who now, in fancy, prostrate greatness tears, And preys on what the imperial vulture spares! Whom Massa dreads, Latinus, trembling, plies With a fair wife, and anxious Carus buys! When those supplant thee in thy dearest rights, Who earn rich legacies by active nights; Those, whom (the shortest, surest way to rise,) The widow's itch, advances to the skies!— Not that an equal rank her minions hold: Just to their various powers, she metes her gold, And Proculeius mourns his scanty share, While Gillo triumphs, her's and nature's heir! And let him triumph! 'tis the price of blood: While, thus defrauded of the generous flood, The colour flies his cheek, as though he prest, With unsuspecting foot, a serpent's crest; Or stood engaged at Lyons to declaim, Where the least peril is the loss of fame. Ye Gods!—what rage, what frenzy fires my brain, When that false guardian, with his splendid train, Crowds the long street, and leaves his orphan charge To prostitution, and the world at large! When, by a juggling sentence damn'd in vain, (For who, that holds the plunder, heeds the pain?) Marius to wine devotes his morning hours, And laughs, in exile, at the offended Powers: While, sighing o'er the victory she won, The Province finds herself but more undone! And shall I feel, that crimes like these require The avenging strains of the Venusian lyre, And not pursue them? shall I still repeat The legendary tales of Troy and Crete; The toils of Hercules, the horses fed, On human flesh, by savage Diomed, The lowing labyrinth, the builder's flight, And the rash boy, hurl'd from his airy height? When, what the law forbids the wife to heir, The adulterer's Will may to the wittol bear, Who gave, with wand'ring eye, and vacant face, A tacit sanction to his own disgrace; And, while at every turn a look he stole, Snored, unsuspected, o'er the treacherous bowl! When He presumes to ask a troop's command, Who spent on horses all his father's land, While, proud the experienced driver to display, His glowing wheels smoked o'er the Appian way:— For there, our young Automedon first tried His powers, there loved the rapid car to guide; While great Pelides sought superiour bliss, And toy'd and wanton'd with his master-miss. Who would not, reckless of the swarm he meets, Fill his wide tablets, in the publick streets, With angry verse? when, through the mid-day glare, Born by six slaves, and in an open chair, The forger comes, who owes this blaze of state, To a wet seal, and a fictitious date; Comes, like the soft Mæcenas, lolling by, And impudently braves the publick eye! Or the rich dame, who stanch'd her husband's thirst With generous wine, but—drugg'd it deeply first! And now, more dextrous than Locusta, shows Her country friends, the beverage to compose, And, midst the curses of the indignant throng, Bear, in broad day, the spotted corpse along. Dare nobly, man! if greatness be thy aim, And practise what may chains and exile claim: On Guilt's broad base thy towering fortunes raise, For Virtue starves on—universal praise! While crimes, in scorn of niggard fate, afford The ivory couches, and the citron board, The goblet high-emboss'd, the antique plate, The lordly mansion, and the fair estate! O! who can rest—who taste the sweets of life, When sires debauch the son's too greedy wife; When males to males, abjuring shame, are wed, And beardless boys pollute the nuptial bed! No: Indignation, kindling as she views, Shall, in each breast, a generous warmth infuse, And pour, in Nature and the Nine's despite, Such strains as I, or Cluvienus, write! E'er since Deucalion, while, on every side, The bursting clouds uprais'd the whelming tide, Reach'd, in his little skiff, the forked hill, And sought, at Themis' shrine, the Immortals' will; When softening stones grew warm with gradual life, And Pyrrha brought each male a virgin wife; Whatever passions have the soul possest, Whatever wild desires inflamed the breast, Joy, Sorrow, Fear, Love, Hatred, Transport, Rage, Shall form the motley subject of my page. And when could Satire boast so fair a field? Say, when did Vice a richer harvest yield? When did fell Avarice so engross the mind? Or when the lust of play so curse mankind?— No longer now, the pocket's stores supply The boundless charges of the desperate die: The chest is staked!—muttering the steward stands, And scarce resigns it, at his lord's commands. Is it a simple madness,—I would know, To venture countless thousands on a throw, Yet want the soul, a single piece to spare, To clothe the slave, that shivering stands and bare! Who call'd, of old, so many seats his own, Or on seven sumptuous dishes supp'd alone?— Then plain and open was the cheerful feast, And every client was a bidden guest; Now, at the gate, a paltry largess lies, And eager hands and tongues dispute the prize. But first (lest some false claimant should be found,) The wary steward takes his anxious round, And pries in every face; then calls aloud, “Come forth, ye great Dardanians, from the crowd!” For, mix'd with us, e'en these besiege the door, And scramble for—the pittance of the poor! “Despatch the Prætor first,” the master cries, “And next the Tribune.” ‘No, not so;’ replies The Freedman, bustling through, ‘first come is, still, ‘First serv'd; and I may claim my right, and will!— ‘Though born a slave, ('tis bootless to deny, ‘What these bored ears betray to every eye,) ‘On my own rents, in splendour, now I live, ‘On five fair freeholds! Can the purple give ‘Their Honours, more? when, to Laurentum sped, ‘Noble Corvinus tends a flock for bread!— ‘Pallas and the Licînii, in estate, ‘Must yield to me: let, then, the Tribunes wait.’ Yes, let them wait! thine, Riches, be the field!— It is not meet, that he to Honour yield, To sacred Honour, who, with whiten'd feet, Was hawk'd for sale, so lately, through the street. O gold! though Rome beholds no altars flame, No temples rise to thy pernicious name, Such as to Victory, Virtue, Faith are rear'd, And Concord, where the clamorous stork is heard, Yet is thy full divinity confest, Thy shrine establish'd here, in every breast. But while, with anxious eyes, the great explore How much the dole augments their annual store, What misery must the poor dependant dread, Whom this small pittance, cloth'd, and lodg'd, and fed? Wedged in thick ranks before the donor's gates, A phalanx firm, of chairs and litters, waits: Thither one husband, at the risk of life, Hurries his teeming, or his bedrid wife; Another, practised in the gainful art, With deeper cunning tops the beggar's part; Plants at his side a close and empty chair: “My Galla, master;—give me Galla's share.” ‘Galla!’ the porter cries; ‘let her look out.’ “Sir, she's asleep. Nay, give me;—can you doubt!” What rare pursuits employ the clients' day! First to the patron's door, their court to pay, Next to the forum, to support his cause, Thence to Apollo, learned in the laws, And the triumphal statues; where some Jew, Some mongrel Arab, some—I know not who— Has impudently dared a niche to seize, Fit to be p? against, or—what you please.— Returning home, he drops them at the gate: And now the weary clients, wise too late, Resign their hopes, and supperless retire, To spend the paltry dole in herbs and fire. Meanwhile, their patron sees his palace stored, With every dainty earth and sea afford: Stretch'd on th' unsocial couch, he rolls his eyes O'er many an orb of matchless form and size, Selects the fairest to receive his plate, And, at one meal, devours a whole estate!— But who, (for not a parasite is there,) The selfishness of luxury can bear? See! the lone glutton craves whole boars! a beast Design'd, by nature, for the social feast!— But speedy wrath o'ertakes him: Gorged with food, And swoll'n and fretted by the peacock crude, He seeks the bath, his feverish pulse to still, Hence sudden death, and age without a Will! Swift flies the tale, by witty spleen increast, And furnishes a laugh at every feast; The laugh, his friends not undelighted hear, And, fallen from all their hopes, insult his bier. Nothing is left, nothing, for future times, To add to the full catalogue of crimes; The baffled sons must feel the same desires, And act the same mad follies, as their sires. Vice has attain'd its zenith:—Then set sail, Spread all thy canvas, Satire, to the gale— But where the powers so vast a theme requires? Where the plain times, the simple, when our sires Enjoy'd a freedom, which I dare not name, And gave the publick sin to publick shame, Heedless who smiled or frown'd?—Now, let a line, But glance at Tigellinus, and you shine, Chain'd to a stake, in pitchy robes, and light, Lugubrous torch, the deepening shades of night; Or, writhing on a hook, are dragg'd around, And, with your mangled members, plough the ground. What, shall the wretch of hard, unpitying soul, Who, for three uncles, mix'd the deadly bowl, Propp'd on his plumy couch, that all may see, Tower by triumphant, and look down on me! Yes; let him look. He comes! avoid his way, And on your lip your cautious finger lay; Crowds of informers linger in his rear, And, if a whisper pass, will overhear. Bring, if you please, Æneas on the stage, Fierce war, with the Rutulian prince, to wage; Subdue the stern Achilles; and once more, With Hylas! Hylas! fill the echoing shore; Harmless, nay pleasant, shall the tale be found, It bares no ulcer, and it probes no wound. But when Lucilius, fired with virtuous rage, Waves his keen falchion o'er a guilty age, The conscious villain shudders at his sin, And burning blushes speak the pangs within; Cold drops of sweat from every member roll, And growing terrours harrow up his soul: Then tears of shame, and dire revenge succeed— Say, have you ponder'd well the advent'rous deed? Now—ere the trumpet sounds—your strength debate; The soldier, once engaged, repents too late. J. Yet I must write: and since these iron times, From living knaves preclude my angry rhymes, I point my pen against the guilty dead, And pour its gall on each obnoxious head. SATIRE II. O for an eagle's wings! that I might fly To the bleak regions of the polar sky, When from their lips the cant of virtue falls, Who preach like Curii, live like Bacchanals! Devoid of knowledge, as of worth, they thrust, In every nook, some philosophick bust; For he, among them, counts himself most wise, Who most old sages of the sculptor buys; Sets most true Zenos, or Cleanthes' heads, To guard the volumes which he—never reads! Trust not to outward show: in every street, Obscenity, in formal garb, we meet.— And dost thou, hypocrite, our lusts arraign, Thou! of Socratick catamites the drain! Nature thy rough and shaggy limbs design'd, To mark a stern inexorable mind; But all's so smooth below!—“the surgeon smiles, “And scarcely can, for laughter, lance the piles.” Gravely demure, in wisdom's awful chair, His beetling eyebrows longer than his hair, In solemn state, the affected Stoick sits, And drops his maxims on the crowd by fits!— Yon Peribomius, whose emaciate air, And tottering gait, his foul disease declare, With patience I can view; he braves disgrace, Nor skulks behind a sanctimonious face: Him may his folly, or his fate excuse— But whip me those, who Virtue's name abuse, And, soil'd with all the vices of the times, Thunder damnation on their neighbour's crimes! “Shrink at the pathick Sextus! Can I be, Whate'er my guilt, more infamous than he?” Varillus cries: Let those who tread aright, Deride the halt, the swarthy Moor, the white; This we might bear; but who his spleen could rein, And hear the Gracchi of the mob complain? Who would not mingle earth, and sea, and sky, Should Milo murder, Verres theft, decry, Clodius adultery? Catiline accuse Cethegus, Lentulus, of factious views, Or Sylla's pupils, soil'd with deeper guilt, Arraign their master for the blood he spilt? Yet have we seen,—O Shame, for ever fled!— A barbarous judge start from the incestuous bed, And, with stern voice, those rigid laws awake, At which the Powers of War and Beauty quake, What time his drugs were speeding to the tomb The abortive fruit of Julia's teeming womb!— And must not, now, the most debased and vile, Hear these false Scauri with a scornful smile; And, while the hypocrites their crimes arraign, Turn, like the trampled asp, and bite again! They must; they do:—When late, amidst the crowd, A zealot of the sect exclaim'd aloud, Where sleeps the Julian law? Laronia eyed The scowling Stoicide, and taunting, cried, “Blest be the age, that such a censor gave, “The groaning world to chasten and to save! “Blush, Rome, and from the sink of sin arise— “Lo! a third Cato, sent thee from the skies! “But—tell me yet—What shop the balm supplied, “Which, from your brawny neck and bristly hide, “Such potent fragrance breathes? nor let it shame “Your Gravity, to shew the vender's name. “If ancient laws must reassume their course, “Give the Scantinian first its proper force. “Look, look at home; the ways of men explore— “Our faults, you say, are many; theirs are more: “Yet safe from censure, as from fear, they stand, “A firm, compact, impenetrable band! “We know your monstrous leagues; but can you find “One proof in us, of this detested kind? “Pure days and nights with Cluvia, Flora led, “And Tedia chastely shared Catulla's bed; “While Hippo's brutal itch both sexes tried, “And proved, by turns, the bridegroom and the bride! “We ne'er, with mis-spent zeal, explore the laws, “We throng no forum, and we plead no cause: “Some few, perhaps, may wrestle, some be fed, “To aid their breath, with strong athletick bread. “Ye fling the shuttle with a female grace, “And spin more subtly than Arachne's race; “Cower'd o'er your labour, like the squalid jade, “That plies the distaff, to a block belay'd. “Why Hister's freedman heir'd his wealth, and why “His consort, while he lived, was bribed so high, “I spare to tell; the wife that, sway'd by gain, “Can make a third in bed, and ne'er complain, “Must ever thrive: on secrets jewels wait: “Then wed, my girls; be silent, and—be great! “Yet these are they, who, fierce in Virtue's cause, “Consign our venial frailties to the laws; “And, while with partial aim their censure moves, “Acquit the vultures, and condemn the doves!” She paused: the unmanly zealots felt the sway Of conscious truth, and slunk, abash'd, away. But how shall vice be shamed, when, loosely drest, In the light texture of a cobweb vest, You, Creticus, amid the indignant crowd, At Procla and Pollinea rail aloud?— These, he rejoins, are “daughters of the game.” Strike, then;—yet know, though lost to honest fame, The wantons would reject a veil so thin, And blush, while suffering, to display their skin. “But Sirius glows; I burn.” Then, quit your dress; 'Twill thus be madness, and the scandal less. O! could our legions, with fresh laurels crown'd, And smarting still from many a glorious wound, Our rustick mountaineers, (the plough laid by, For city cares,) a judge so drest descry, What thoughts would rise? Lo! robes, which misbecome A witness, deck the awful bench of Rome; And Creticus, stern champion of the laws, Gleams through the tissue of pellucid gauze! Anon from you, as from its fountain head, Wide and more wide the flagrant pest will spread; As swine take measles from distemper'd swine, And one infected grape pollutes the vine. Yes, Rome shall see you, lewdlier clad, erewhile, (For none become, at once, completely vile,) In some opprobrious den of shame, combined With that vile herd, the horrour of their kind, Who twine gay fillets round the forehead; deck With strings of orient pearl, the breast and neck; Sooth the Good Goddess with large bowls of wine, And the soft belly of a pregnant swine.— No female, foul perversion! dares appear, For males, and males alone, officiate here; “Far hence,” they cry, “unholy sex retire, “Our purer rites no lowing horn require!” —At Athens thus, involv'd in thickest gloom, Cotytto's priests her secret torch illume; And to such orgies give the lustful night, That e'en Cotytto sickens at the sight. With tiring-pins, these spread the sooty dye, Arch the full brow, and tinge the trembling eye; Those bind their flowing locks in cawls of gold, Swill from huge glasses of immodest mould, Light, filmy robes of azure net-work wear; And, by their Juno, hark! the attendants swear! This grasps a mirror—pathick Otho's boast, (Auruncan Actor's spoil,) where, while his host, With shouts, the signal of the fight required, He view'd his mailed form; view'd, and admired! Lo, a new subject for the historick page, A mirror, midst the arms of civil rage!— To murder Galba, was—a general's part! A stern republican's—to dress with art! The empire of the world in arms to seek, And spread—a softening poultice o'er the cheek! Preposterous vanity! and never seen, Or in the Assyrian or Egyptian queen, Though one in arms near old Euphrates stood, And one the doubtful fight at Actium view'd. No reverence for the table here is found; But brutal mirth, and jests obscene go round: They lisp, they squeal, and the rank language use, Of Cybele's lewd votaries, or the stews: Some wild enthusiast, silver'd o'er with age, Yet fired by lust's ungovernable rage, Of most insatiate throat, is named the priest, And sits fit umpire of th' unhallow'd feast; Why pause they here? Phrygians long since in heart, Whence this delay, to lop a useless part? Gracchus admired a cornet or a fife, And, with an ample dower, became his wife. The contract sign'd, the wonted bliss implored, A costly supper decks the nuptial board; And the new bride, amid the wondering room, Lies in the bosom of the accursed groom!— Say now, ye Nobles, claims this monstrous deed, The Aruspex or the Censor? Can we need More expiations?—sacrifices?—vows? For calving women, or for lambing cows? The lusty priest, whose limbs dissolv'd with heat, What time he danced beneath the Ancilia's weight, Now flings the ensigns of his god aside, And takes the stole and flammea of a bride! Father of Rome! from what pernicious clime, Did Latian swains derive so foul a crime? Tell where the poisonous nettle first arose, Whose baneful juice through all thy offspring flows. Behold! a man for rank and power renown'd, Marries a man!—and yet, with thundering sound, Thy brazen helmet shakes not! earth yet stands, Fix'd on its base, nor feels thy wrathful hands! Is thy arm shorten'd? Raise to Jove thy prayer— But Rome no longer knows thy guardian care; Quit then the charge to some severer Power, Of strength to punish in the obnoxious hour. “To-morrow, with the dawn, I must attend “In yonder valley!” Why so soon? “A friend “Takes him a husband there, and bids a few”— Few, yet: but wait awhile; and we shall view Such contracts form'd without or shame or fear, And enter'd on the records of the year! Meanwhile, one pang these passive monsters find, One ceaseless pang, that preys upon the mind; They cannot shift their sex, and pregnant prove With the dear pledges of a husband's love: Wisely confined by Nature's steady plan, Which counteracts the wild desires of man. For them, no drugs prolifick powers retain, And the Luperci strike their palms in vain. And yet these prodigies of vice appear, Less monstrous, Gracchus, than the net and spear, With which equipp'd, you urged th' unequal fight, And fled, dishonour'd, in a nation's sight: Though nobler far than each illustrious name, That throng'd the pit, (spectators of your shame,) Nay, than the Prætor, who the Show supplied, At which your base dexterity was tried. That angry Justice form'd a dreadful hell, That ghosts in subterraneous regions dwell, That hateful Styx his sable current rolls, And Charon ferries o'er unbodied souls, Are now as tales or idle fables prized; By children question'd, and by men despised: Yet these, do thou believe. What thoughts, declare, Ye Scipios, once the thunderbolts of war! Fabricius, Curius, great Camillus' ghost! Ye valiant Fabii, in yourselves an host! Ye dauntless youths at fatal Cannæ slain! Spirits of many a brave and bloody plain! What thoughts are yours, whene'er, with feet unblest, An unbelieving shade invades your rest? —Ye fly, to expiate the blasting view; Fling on the pine-tree torch the sulphur blue, And from the dripping bay, dash round the lustral dew. And yet—to these abodes we all must come, Believe, or not, these are our final home; Though now Iërne tremble at our sway, And Britain, boastful of her length of day; Though the blue Orcades receive our chain, And isles that slumber in the frozen main. But why of conquest boast? the conquer'd climes Are free, O Rome, from thy detested crimes. No;—one Armenian all our youth outgoes, And, with curs'd fires, for a base tribune glows. True: such thy power, Example! He was brought An hostage hither, and the infection caught.— O, bid the striplings flee! for sensual art, Here lurks to snare the unsuspecting heart; Then farewell, simple nature!—Pleased no more, With knives, whips, bridles, (all they prized of yore,) Thus taught, and thus debauch'd, they hasten home, To spread the morals of Imperial Rome! SATIRE III. Grieved though I am to see the man depart, Who long has shared, and still must share my heart, Yet (when I call my better judgment home) I praise his purpose; to retire from Rome, And give, on Cumæ's solitary coast, The Sibyl—one inhabitant to boast! Full on the road to Baiæ, Cumæ lies, And many a sweet retreat her shore supplies— Though I prefer even Prochyta's bare strand, To the Suburra:—for, what desert land, What wild, uncultured spot, can more affright, Than fires, wide blazing through the gloom of night, Houses, with ceaseless ruin, thundering down, And all the horrours of this hateful town? Where poets, while the dogstar glows, rehearse, To gasping multitudes, their barbarous verse! Now had my friend, impatient to depart, Consign'd his little all to one poor cart: For this, without the town, he chose to wait; But stopp'd a moment at the Conduit-gate.— Here Numa erst his nightly visits paid, And held high converse with the Egerian maid: Now the once-hallow'd fountain, grove, and fane, Are let to Jews, a wretched, wandering train, Whose furniture's, a basket fill'd with hay,— For every tree is forced a tax to pay; And while the heaven-born Nine in exile rove, The beggar rents their consecrated grove! Thence slowly winding down the vale, we view The Egerian grots—ah, how unlike the true! Nymph of the Spring! more honour'd hadst thou been, If, free from art, an edge of living green, Thy bubbling fount had circumscribed alone, And marble ne'er profaned the native stone. Umbritius here his sullen silence broke, And turn'd on Rome, indignant, as he spoke. Since virtue droops, he cried, without regard, And honest toil scarce hopes a poor reward; Since every morrow sees my means decay, And still makes less the little of to-day; I go, where Dædalus, as poets sing, First check'd his flight, and closed his weary wing: While something yet of health and strength remains, And yet no staff my faultering step sustains; While few gray hairs upon my head are seen, And my old age is vigorous still, and green. Here then, I bid my much loved home farewell— Ah, mine no more!—there let Arturius dwell, And Catulus; knaves, who, in truth's despite, Can white to black transform, and black to white, Build temples, furnish funerals, auctions hold, Farm rivers, ports, and scour the drains for gold! Once they were trumpeters, and always found, With strolling fencers, in their annual round, While their puff'd cheeks, which every village knew, Call'd to “high feats of arms,” the rustick crew: Now they give Shows themselves; and, at the will, Of the base rabble, raise the sign—to kill, Ambitious of their voice: then turn, once more, To their vile gains, and farm the common shore! And why not every thing?—since Fortune throws Her more peculiar smiles on such as those, Whene'er, to wanton merriment inclined, She lifts to thrones, the dregs of human kind! But why, my friend, should I at Rome remain? I cannot teach my stubborn lips to feign; Nor, when I hear a great man's verses, smile, And beg a copy, if I think them vile. A sublunary wight, I have no skill To read the stars; I neither can, nor will, Presage a father's death; I never pried, In toads, for poison, nor—in aught beside. Others may aid the adulterer's vile design, And bear the insidious gift, and melting line, Seduction's agents! I such deeds detest; And, honest, let no thief partake my breast. For this, without a friend, the world I quit; A palsied limb, for every use unfit. Who now is loved, but he whose conscious breast, Swells with dark deeds, still, still to be supprest? He pays, he owes, thee nothing, (strictly just,) Who gives an honest secret to thy trust; But, a dishonest!—there, he feels thy power, And buys thy friendship high from hour to hour. But let not all the wealth which Tagus pours In Ocean's lap, not all his glittering stores, Be deem'd a bribe, sufficient to requite The loss of peace by day, of sleep by night:— O take not, take not, what thy soul rejects, Nor sell the faith, which he, who buys, suspects! The nation, by the great, admired, carest, And hated, shunn'd by Me, above the rest, No longer, now, restrain'd by wounded pride, I haste to shew, (nor thou my warmth deride,) I cannot rule my spleen, and calmly see, A grecian capital, in italy! Grecian? O, no! with this vast sewer compared, The dregs of Greece are scarcely worth regard: Long since, the stream that wanton Syria laves, Has disembogued its filth in Tiber's waves, Its language, arts; o'erwhelm'd us with the scum Of Antioch's streets, its minstrel, harp, and drum. Hie to the Circus! ye who pant to prove A barbarous mistress, an outlandish love; Hie to the Circus! there, in crowds they stand, Tires on their head, and timbrels in their hand. Thy rustick, Mars, the trechedipna wears, And on his breast, smear'd with ceroma, bears A paltry prize, well-pleased; while every land, Sicyon, and Amydos, and Alaband, Tralles, and Samos, and a thousand more, Thrive on his indolence, and daily pour Their starving myriads forth: hither they come, And batten on the genial soil of Rome; Minions, then lords, of every princely dome! A flattering, cringing, treacherous, artful race, Of torrent tongue, and never-blushing face; A Protean tribe, one knows not what to call, Which shifts to every form, and shines in all: Grammarian, painter, augur, rhetorician, Rope-dancer, conjuror, fidler, and physician, All trades his own, your hungry Greekling counts; And bid him mount the sky,—the sky he mounts! You smile—was't a barbarian, then, that flew? No, 'twas a Greek; 'twas an Athenian, too! —Bear with their state who will: for I disdain, To feed their upstart pride, or swell their train: Slaves, that in Syrian lighters stow'd, so late, With figs and prunes, (an inauspicious freight,) Already see their faith preferr'd to mine, And sit above me! and before me sign!— That on the Aventine I first drew air, And, from the womb, was nurs'd on Sabine fare, Avails me not! our birthright now is lost, And all our privilege, an empty boast! For lo! where vers'd in every soothing art, The wily Greek assails his patron's heart, Finds in each dull harangue an air, a grace, And all Adonis in a Gorgon face; Admires the voice that grates upon the ear, Like the shrill scream of amorous chanticleer; And equals the crane neck, and narrow chest, To Hercules, when, straining to his breast The giant son of Earth, his every vein Swells with the toil, and more than mortal pain. We too can cringe as low, and praise as warm, But flattery from the Greeks alone can charm. See! they step forth, and figure to the life, The naked nymph, the mistress, or the wife, So just, you view the very woman there, And fancy all beneath the girdle bare! No longer now, the favourites of the stage Boast their exclusive power to charm the age; The happy art with them a nation shares, Greece is a theatre, where all are players. For lo! their patron smiles,—they burst with mirth; He weeps,—they droop, the saddest souls on earth; He calls for fire,—they court the mantle's heat; 'Tis warm, he cries,—and they dissolve in sweat. Ill-match'd!—secure of victory they start, Who, taught from youth to play a borrow'd part, Can, with a glance, the rising passion trace, And mould their own, to suit their patron's face; At deeds of shame their hands admiring raise, And mad debauchery's worst excesses praise. Besides, no mound their raging lust restrains, All ties it breaks, all sanctity profanes; Wife, virgin-daughter, son unstain'd before,— And, where these fail, they tempt the grandam hoar: They notice every word, haunt every ear, Your secrets learn, and fix you theirs from fear. Turn to their schools:—yon gray professor see, Smear'd with the sanguine stains of perfidy! That tutor most accurs'd his pupil sold! That Stoick sacrificed his friend to gold! A true born Grecian! litter'd on the coast, Where the Gorgonian hack a pinion lost. Hence, Romans, hence! no place for you remains, Where Diphilus, where Erimanthus reigns; Miscreants, who, faithful to their native art, Admit no rival in a patron's heart:— For let them fasten on his easy ear, And drop one hint, one secret slander there, Suck'd from their country's venom, or their own, That instant they possess the man alone; While we are spurn'd, contemptuous, from the door, Our long, long slavery, thought upon no more. 'Tis but a client lost!—and that, we find, Sits wondrous lightly on a patron's mind: And (not to flatter our poor pride, my friend) What merit with the great can we pretend, Though, in our duty, we prevent the day, And, darkling run our humble court to pay; When the brisk prætor, long before, is gone, And hastening, with stern voice, his lictors on, Lest his colleagues o'erpass him in the street, And first the rich and childless matrons greet, Alba and Modia, who impatient wait, And think the morning homage comes too late! Here freeborn youths wait the rich servant's call, And, if they walk beside him, yield the wall; And wherefore? this, forsooth, can fling away, On one voluptuous night, a legion's pay, While those, when some Calvina, sweeping by, Inflames the fancy, check their roving eye, And frugal of their scanty means, forbear, To tempt the wanton from her splendid chair. Produce, at Rome, your witness: let him boast, The sanctity of Berecynthia's host, Of Numa, or of Him, whose zeal divine Snatch'd pale Minerva from her blazing shrine: To search his rent-roll, first the bench prepares, His honesty employs their latest cares: What table does he keep, what slaves maintain, And what, they ask, and where, is his domain? These weighty matters known, his faith they rate, And square his probity to his estate. The poor may swear by all the immortal Powers, By the Great Gods of Samothrace, and ours, His oaths are false, they cry; he scoffs at heaven, And all its thunders; scoffs,—and is forgiven! Add, that the wretch is still the theme of scorn, If the soil'd cloak be patch'd, the gown o'erworn; If, through the bursting shoe, the foot be seen, Or the coarse seam tell where the rent has been. O Poverty, thy thousand ills combined, Sink not so deep into the generous mind, As the contempt and laughter of mankind! “Up! up! these cushion'd benches,” Lectius cries, “Befit not your estates: for shame! arise.” For “shame!”—but you say well: the pander's heir, The spawn of bulks and stews, is seated there; The cry'r's spruce son, fresh from the fencer's school, And prompt the taste to settle and to rule.— So Otho fix'd it, whose preposterous pride, First dared to chase us from their Honours' side. In these curs'd walls, devote alone to gain, When do the poor a wealthy wife obtain? When are they named in wills? when call'd to share The Ædile's council, and assist the chair?— Long since should they have ris'n, thus slighted, spurn'd, And left their home, but—not to have return'd! Depress'd by indigence, the good and wise, In every clime, by painful efforts rise; Here, by more painful still, where scanty cheer, Poor lodging, mean attendance,—all is dear. In earthen ware he scorns, at Rome, to eat, Who, call'd abruptly to the Marsian's seat, From such, well pleased, would take his simple food, Nor blush to wear the cheap Venetian hood. There's many a part of Italy, 'tis said, Where none assume the toga, but the dead: There, when the toil forgone and annual play, Mark, from the rest, some high and solemn day, To theatres of turf the rusticks throng, Charm'd with the farce which charm'd their sires so long; While the pale infant, of the mask in dread, Hides, in his mother's breast, his little head. No modes of dress high birth distinguish there; All ranks, all orders, the same habit wear, And the dread Ædile's dignity is known, O sacred badge! by his white vest alone. But here, beyond our power, array'd we go, In all the gay varieties of show; And when our purse supplies the charge no more, Borrow, unblushing, from our neighbour's store: Such is the reigning vice; and so we flaunt, Proud in distress, and prodigal in want! Briefly, my friend, here all are slaves to gold, And words, and smiles, and every thing is sold. What will you give for Cossus' nod? how high, The silent notice of Veiento buy? —One favourite youth is shaved, another shorn; And, while to Jove the precious spoil is borne, Clients are tax'd for offerings, and, (yet more, To gall their patience,) from their little store, Constrain'd to swell the minion's ample hoard, And bribe the page, for leave to bribe his lord. Who fears the crash of houses in retreat? At simple Gabii, bleak Præneste's seat, Volsinium's craggy heights, embower'd in wood, Or Tibur, beetling o'er prone Anio's flood? While half the city here by shores is staid, And feeble cramps, that lend a treacherous aid: For thus the stewards patch the riven wall, Thus prop the mansion, tottering to its fall; Then bid the tenant court secure repose, While the pile nods to every blast that blows. O! may I live where no such fears molest, No midnight fires burst on my hour of rest! For here 'tis terrour all: midst the loud cry Of “water! water!” the scared neighbours fly, With all their haste can seize—the flames aspire, And the third floor is wrapt in smoke and fire, While you, unconscious, doze: Up, ho! and know, The impetuous blaze which spreads dismay below, By swift degrees will reach the aerial cell, Where, crouching, underneath the tiles you dwell, Where your tame doves their golden couplets rear, “And you could no mischance, but drowning fear!” “Codrus had but one bed, and that, too short, For his short wife;” his goods, of every sort, Were else but few:—six little pipkins graced His cupboard head, a little can was placed On a snug shelf beneath, and near it lay, A Chiron, of the same cheap marble,—clay. And was this all! O no: he yet possest, A few Greek books, shrined in an ancient chest, Where barbarous mice through many an inlet crept, And fed on heavenly numbers, while he slept.— “Codrus, in short, had nothing.” You say true; And yet poor Codrus lost that nothing, too! One curse alone was wanting, to complete His woes: that, cold and hungry, through the street, The wretch should beg, and, in the hour of need, Find none to lodge, to clothe him, or to feed! But should the raging flames on grandeur prey, And low in dust Asturius' palace lay, The squalid matron sighs, the senate mourns, The pleaders cease, the judge the court adjourns; All join to wail the city's hapless fate, And rail at fire with more than common hate. Lo! while it burns, the obsequious courtiers haste, With rich materials, to repair the waste: This, brings him marble, that, a finish'd piece, The far-famed boast of Polyclete and Greece; This, ornaments, which graced of old the fane Of Asia's gods; that, figured plate and plain; This, cases, books, and busts the shelves to grace, And piles of coin his specie to replace— So much the childless Persian swells his store, (Though deem'd the richest of the rich before,) That all ascribe the flames to thirst of pelf, And swear, Asturius fired his house himself. O, had you, from the Circus, power to fly, In many a halcyon village, might you buy Some elegant retreat, for what will, here, Scarce hire a gloomy dungeon through the year! There wells, by nature form'd, which need no rope, No labouring arm, to crane their waters up, Around your lawn their facile streams shall shower, And cheer the springing plant, and opening flower. There live, delighted with the rustick's lot, And till, with your own hands, the little spot; The little spot shall yield you large amends, And glad, with many a feast, your Samian friends. And, sure,—in any corner we can get, To call one lizard ours, is something yet! Flush'd with a mass of indigested food, Which clogs the stomach, and inflames the blood, What crowds, with watching wearied and o'erprest, Curse the slow hours, and die for want of rest! For who can hope his languid lids to close, Where brawling taverns banish all repose? Sleep, to the rich alone, “his visits pays:” And hence the seeds of many a dire disease. The carts loud rumbling through the narrow way, The drivers' clamours at each casual stay, From drowsy Drusus would his slumber take, And keep the calves of Proteus broad awake! If business call, obsequious crowds divide, While o'er their heads the rich securely ride, By tall Illyrians borne, and read, or write, Or (should the early hour to rest invite,) Close the soft litter, and enjoy the night. Yet reach they first the goal; while, by the throng Elbow'd and jostled, scarce we creep along; Sharp strokes from poles, tubs, rafters, doom'd to feel; And plaister'd o'er with mud, from head to heel: While the rude soldier gores us as he goes, Or marks, in blood, his progress on our toes! See, from the Dole, a vast tumultuous throng, Each follow'd by his kitchen, pours along! Huge pans, which Corbulo could scarce uprear, With steady neck a puny slave must bear, And, lest amid the way the flames expire, Glide nimbly on, and gliding, fan the fire; Through the close press with sinuous efforts wind, And, piece by piece, leave his botch'd rags behind. Hark! groaning on, the unwieldy waggon spreads Its cumbrous load, tremendous! o'er our heads, Projecting elm or pine, that nods on high, And threatens death to every passer by. Heavens! should the axle crack, which bears a weight Of huge Ligurian stone, and pour the freight On the pale crowd beneath, what would remain, What joint, what bone, what atom of the slain? The body, with the soul, would vanish quite, Invisible as air, to mortal sight!— Meanwhile, unconscious of their fellow's fate, At home, they heat the water, scour the plate, Arrange the strigils, fill the cruise with oil, And ply their several tasks with fruitless toil: For he who bore the dole, poor mangled ghost, Sits pale and trembling on the Stygian coast, Scared at the horrours of the novel scene, At Charon's threatening voice, and scowling mien; Nor hopes a passage, thus abruptly hurl'd, Without his farthing, to the nether world. Pass we these fearful dangers, and survey, What other evils threat our nightly way. And first, behold the mansion's towering size, Where floors on floors to the tenth story rise; Whence heedless garretteers their potsherds throw, And crush the unwary wretch that walks below! Clattering the storm descends from heights unknown, Ploughs up the street, and wounds the flinty stone! 'Tis madness, dire improvidence of ill, To sup abroad, before you sign your Will; Since fate in ambush lies, and marks his prey, From every wakeful window in the way: Pray, then,—and count your humble prayer well sped, If pots be only—emptied on your head. The drunken bully, ere his man be slain, Frets through the night, and courts repose in vain; And while the thirst of blood his bosom burns, From side to side, in restless anguish, turns, Like Peleus' son, when, quell'd by Hector's hand, His loved Patroclus prest the Phrygian strand. There are, who murder as an opiate take, And only, when no brawls await them, wake: Yet even these heroes, flush'd with youth and wine, All contest with the purple robe decline; Securely give the lengthen'd train to pass, The sun-bright flambeaux, and the lamps of brass.— Me, whom the moon, or candle's paler gleam, Whose wick I husband to the last extreme, Guides through the gloom, he braves, devoid of fear: The prelude to our doughty quarrel hear, If that be deem'd a quarrel, where, heaven knows, He only gives, and I receive, the blows! Across my path he strides, and bids me Stand! I bow, obsequious to the dread command; What else remains, where madness, rage, combine With youth, and strength superiour far to mine? “Whence come you, rogue?” he cries; “whose beans, to-night, Have stuff'd you, thus? what cobler clubb'd his mite, For leeks, and sheep's-head porridge? Dumb! quite dumb! Speak, or be kick'd.—Yet, once again! your home? Where shall I find you? At what beggar's stand, (Temple, or bridge) whimp'ring, with outstretch'd hand?” Whether I strive some humble plea to frame, Or steal in silence by, 'tis just the same; I'm beaten first, then dragg'd in rage away; Bound to the peace, or punish'd for the fray! Mark here the boasted freedom of the poor! Beaten and bruis'd, that goodness to adore, Which, at their humble prayer, suspends its ire, And sends them home, with yet a bone entire! Nor this the worst; for when deep midnight reigns, And bolts secure our doors, and massy chains, When noisy inns a transient silence keep, And harass'd nature woos the balm of sleep, Then, thieves and murderers ply their dreadful trade; With stealthy steps our secret couch invade:— Roused from the treacherous calm, aghast we start, And the flesh'd sword—is buried in our heart! Hither from bogs, from rocks, and caves pursued, (The Pontine marsh, and Gallinarian wood,) The dark assassins flock, as to their home, And fill with dire alarms the streets of Rome. Such countless multitudes our peace annoy, That bolts and shackles every forge employ, And cause so wide a waste, the country fears A want of ore for mattocks, rakes, and shares. O! happy were our sires, estranged from crimes; And happy, happy, were the good old times, Which saw, beneath their kings, their tribunes' reign, One cell the nation's criminals contain! Much could I add, more reasons could I cite, If time were ours, to justify my flight; But see! the impatient team is moving on, The sun declining; and I must be gone: Long since, the driver murmur'd at my stay, And jerk'd his whip, to beckon me away. Farewell, my friend! with this embrace we part: Cherish my memory ever in your heart; And when, from crowds and business, you repair, To breathe at your Aquinum, freer air, Fail not to draw me from my loved retreat, To Elvine Ceres, and Diana's seat:— For your bleak hills my Cumæ I'll resign, And (if you blush not at such aid as mine) Come well equipp'd, to wage, in angry rhymes, Fierce war, with you, on follies and on crimes. SATIRE IV. Again Crispinus comes! and yet again, And oft, shall he be summon'd to sustain His dreadful part:—the monster of the times, Without one virtue to redeem his crimes! Diseased, emaciate, weak in all but lust, And whom the widow's sweets alone disgust. Avails it then, in what long colonnades He tires his mules? through what extensive glades His chair is borne? what vast estates he buys, What splendid domes, that round the Forum rise? Ah, no!—Peace visits not the guilty mind, Least his, who incest to adultery join'd, And stain'd thy priestess, Vesta;—whom, dire fate! The long dark night and living tomb await. Turn we to slighter vices:—yet had these, In others, Seius, Titius, whom you please, The Censor roused; for what the good would shame, Becomes Crispinus, and is honest fame. But when the actor's person far exceeds, In native loathsomeness, his loathsom'st deeds, Say, what can satire? For a fish that weigh'd Six pounds, six thousand sesterces he paid! As those report, who catch, with greedy ear, And magnify the mighty things they hear. Had this expense been meant, with well-timed skill, To gull some childless dotard of a Will; Or bribe some rich and fashionable fair, Who flaunts it in a close, wide-window'd, chair; 'Twere worth our praise:—but no such plot was here: 'Twas for himself he bought a treat so dear! This, all past gluttony from shame redeems, And even Apicius poor and frugal seems. What! You, Crispinus, brought to Rome, erewhile, Lapt in the rushes of your native Nile, Buy scales, at such a price! you might, I guess, Have bought the fisherman himself for less; Bought, in some countries, manors at this rate, And, in Apulia, an immense estate! How gorged the Emperour, when so dear a fish, Yet, of his cheapest meals, the cheapest dish, Was guttled down by this impurpled lord, Chief knight, chief parasite, at Cæsar's board, Whom Memphis heard so late, with ceaseless yell, Clamouring through all her streets—“Ho! shads to sell!” Pierian Maids, begin;—but, quit your lyres, The fact I bring, no lofty chord requires: Relate it, then, and in the simplest strain, Nor let the poet style you Maids, in vain. When the last Flavius, drunk with fury, tore The prostrate world, which bled at every pore, And Rome beheld, in body as in mind, A bald-pate Nero rise, to curse mankind; It chanced, that where the sane of Venus stands, Rear'd on Ancona's coast by Grecian hands, A turbot, wandering from the Illyrian main, Fill'd the wide bosom of the bursting seine. Monsters so bulky, from its frozen stream, Mæotis renders to the solar beam, And pours them, fat with a whole winter's ease, Through the bleak Euxine, into warmer seas. The mighty draught the astonish'd boatman eyes, And, to the Pontiff's table, dooms his prize: For who would dare to sell it? who to buy? When the coast swarm'd with many a practis'd spy, Mud-rakers, prompt to swear the fish had fled From Cæsar's ponds, ingrate! where long it fed, And thus recaptured, claim'd to be restored, To the dominion of its ancient lord! Nay, if Palphurius may our credit gain, Whatever rare or precious swims the main, Is forfeit to the crown, and you may seize The obnoxious dainty, when and where you please. This point allow'd, our wary boatman chose To give—what else, he had not fail'd to lose. Now were the dogstar's sickly fervours o'er, Earth, pinch'd with cold, her frozen livery wore; The old began their quartan fits to fear, And wintry blasts deform'd the beauteous year, And kept the turbot sweet: yet on he flew, As if the sultry South corruption blew.— And now the lake, and now the hill he gains, Where Alba, though in ruins, still maintains The Trojan fire, which, but for her, were lost, And worships Vesta, though with less of cost. The wondering crowd, that gather'd to survey The enormous fish, and barr'd the fisher's way, Satiate, at length retires; the gates unfold!— Murmuring, th' excluded senators behold The envied dainty enter;—On the man To great Atrides press'd, and thus began. “This, for a private table far too great, “Accept, and sumptuously your Genius treat: “Haste to unload your stomach, and devour, “A turbot, destined to this happy hour. “I sought him not;—he mark'd the toils I set, “And rush'd, a willing victim, to the net.” Was flattery e'er so rank! yet he grows vain, And his crest rises at the fulsome strain. When, to divine, a mortal power we raise, He looks for no hyperboles in praise. But when was joy unmix'd? no pot is found, Capacious of the turbot's ample round: In this distress, he calls the chiefs of state, At once the objects of his scorn and hate, In whose pale cheeks distrust and doubt appear, And all a tyrant's friendship breeds of fear. Scarce was the loud Liburnian heard to say, “He sits,” ere Pegasus was on his way; Yes:—the new bailiff of the affrighted town, (For what were Præfects more?) had snatch'd his gown, And rush'd to council: From the ivory chair, He dealt out justice with no common care; But yielded oft to those licentious times, And where he could not punish, wink'd at crimes. Then old, facetious Crispus tript along, Of gentle manners, and persuasive tongue: None fitter to advise the Lord of All, Had that pernicious pest, whom thus we call, Allow'd a friend to sooth his savage mood, And give him counsel, wise at once and good. But who shall dare this liberty to take, When, every word you hazard, life's at stake? Though but of stormy summers, showery springs— For tyrants' ears, alas! are ticklish things. So did the good old man his tongue restrain; Nor strove to stem the torrent's force in vain. Not one of those, who, by no fears deterr'd, Spoke the free soul, and truth to life preferr'd, He temporized—thus fourscore summers fled, Even in that court, securely, o'er his head. Next him, appear'd Acilius hurrying on, Of equal age,—and follow'd by his son; Who fell, unjustly fell, in early years, A victim to the tyrant's jealous fears: But long ere this, were hoary hairs become, A prodigy, among the great, at Rome; Hence, had I rather owe my humble birth, Frail brother of the giant-brood, to earth. Poor youth! in vain the ancient sleight you try; In vain, with frantick air, and ardent eye, Fling every robe aside, and battle wage, With bears and lions, on the Alban stage. All see the trick: and, spite of Brutus' skill, There are who count him but a driveller still; Since, in his days, it cost no mighty pains, T' outwit a prince, with much more beard than brains. Rubrius, though not, like these, of noble race, Follow'd with equal terrour in his face; And, labouring with a crime too foul to name, More, than the pathick satirist, lost to shame. Montanus' belly next, and next appear'd The legs, on which that monstrous pile was rear'd. Crispinus follow'd, daub'd with more perfume, Thus early! than two funerals consume. Then bloodier Pompey, practised to betray, And hesitate the noblest lives away. Then Fuscus, who in studious pomp at home, Plann'd future triumphs for the Arms of Rome. Blind to the event! those arms, a different fate, Inglorious wounds, and Dacian vultures, wait. Last, sly Veiento with Catullus came, Deadly Catullus, who, at beauty's name, Took fire, although unseen: a wretch, whose crimes Struck with amaze even those prodigious times. A base, blind parasite, a murderous lord, From the bridge-end, raised to the council-board; Yet fitter still to dog the traveller's heels, And whine for alms to the descending wheels! None dwelt so largely on the turbot's size, Or raised, with such applause, his wondering eyes; But to the left (O, treacherous want of sight) He pour'd his praise;—the fish was on the right! Thus would he at the fencer's matches sit, And shout with rapture, at some fancied hit; And thus applaud the stage-machinery, where The youths were rapt aloft, and lost in air. Nor fell Veiento short:—as if possest, With all Bellona's rage, his labouring breast Burst forth in prophecy; “I see, I see, “The omens of some glorious victory! “Some powerful monarch captured!—lo, he rears, “Horrent on every side, his pointed spears! “Arviragus hurl'd from the British car: “The fish is foreign, foreign is the war.” Proceed, great Seer, and what remains untold, The turbot's age and country, next unfold; So shall your lord his fortunes better know, And where the conquest waits, and who the foe. The Emperour now the important question put, “How say ye, Fathers, shall the fish be cut?” “O, far be that disgrace,” Montanus cries; “No, let a pot be form'd, of amplest size, “Within whose slender sides, the fish, dread Sire, “May spread his vast circumference intire! “Bring, bring the temper'd clay, and let it feel “The quick gyrations of the plastick wheel:— “But, Cæsar, thus forewarn'd, make no campaign, “Unless your potters follow in your train!” Montanus ended; all approved the plan, And all, the speech, so worthy of the man! Vers'd in the old court luxury, he knew, The feasts of Nero, and his midnight crew; Where, oft, when potent draughts had fired the brain, The jaded taste, was spurr'd to gorge again.— And, in my time, none understood so well, The science of good eating: he could tell, At the first relish, if his oysters fed On the Rutupian, or the Lucrine bed; And from a crab, or lobster's colour, name, The country, nay the district, whence it came. Here closed the solemn farce. The Fathers rise, And each, submissive, from the presence hies:— Pale, trembling wretches, whom the Chief, in sport, Had dragg'd, astonish'd, to the Alban court; As if the stern Sicambri were in arms, Or the fierce Catti threaten'd new alarms; As if ill news by flying posts had come, And gathering nations sought the fall of Rome! O! that such scenes, (disgraceful at the most,) Had all those years of cruelty engrost, Through which, his rage pursued the great and good, Uncheck'd, while vengeance slumber'd o'er their blood! And yet he fell!—for when he changed his game, And first grew dreadful to the vulgar name, They seized the murderer, drench'd with Lamian gore, And hurl'd him, headlong, to the infernal shore! SATIRE V. TO TREBIUS. If—by reiterated scorn made bold, Your mind can still its shameless tenour hold, Still think the greatest blessing earth can give, Is, solely at another's cost to live; If—you can brook, what Galba would have spurn'd, And mean Sarmentus with a frown return'd, At Cæsar's haughty board, dependents both, I scarce would take your evidence on oath. The belly's fed with little cost: yet grant, You should, unhappily, that little want, Some vacant bridge might surely still be found, Some highway side; where, grovelling on the ground, Your shivering limbs compassion's sigh might wake, And gain an alms for “Charity's sweet sake!” What! can a meal, thus sauced, deserve your care? Is hunger so importunate? when there, There, in your tatter'd rug, you may, my friend, On casual scraps more honestly depend; With chattering teeth toil o'er your wretched treat, And gnaw the crusts, which dogs refuse to eat!— For, first, of this be sure: whene'er your lord Thinks proper to invite you to his board, He pays, or thinks he pays, the total sum Of all your pains, past, present, and to come. Behold the meed of servitude! the great Reward their humble followers with a treat, And count it current coin:—they count it such, And, though it be but little, think it much. If, after two long months, he condescend To waste a thought upon a humble friend, Reminded by a vacant seat, and write, “You, Master Trebius, sup with me to-night.” 'Tis rapture all! Go now, supremely blest, Enjoy the meed for which you broke your rest, And, loose and slipshod, ran your vows to pay, What time the fading stars announced the day; Or at that earlier hour, when, with slow roll, Thy frozen wain, Boötes, turn'd the pole; Yet trembling, lest the levee should be o'er, And the full court retiring from the door! And what a meal at last! such ropy wine, As wool, which takes all liquids, would decline; Hot, heady lees, to fire the wretched guests, And turn them all to Corybants, or beasts.— At first, with sneers and sarcasms, they engage, Then hurl the jugs around, with mutual rage; Or, stung to madness by the household train, With coarse stone pots a desperate fight maintain; While streams of blood in smoking torrents flow, And my lord smiles to see the battle glow! Not such his beverage: he enjoys the juice Of ancient days, when beards were yet in use, Press'd in the Social War!—but will not send One cordial drop, to cheer a fainting friend. To-morrow, he will change, and, haply, fill The mellow vintage of the Alban hill, Or Setian; wines, which cannot now be known, So much the mould of age has overgrown The district, and the date; such generous bowls, As Thrasea and Helvidius, patriot souls! While crown'd with flowers, in sacred pomp, they lay, To Freedom quaff'd, on Brutus' natal day. Before your patron, cups of price are placed, Amber and gold, with rows of beryls graced: Cups, you can only at a distance view, And never trusted to such guests as you! Or, if they be,—a faithful slave attends, To count the gems, and watch your finger's ends. You'll pardon him; but lo! a jasper there, Of matchless worth, which justifies his care: For Virro, like his brother peers, of late, Has stripp'd his fingers to adorn his plate; And jewels now emblaze the festive board, Which deck'd, with nobler grace, the hero's sword, Whom Dido prized, above the Libyan lord. From such he drinks: to you, the slaves allot The Beneventine cobbler's four-lugg'd pot, A fragment, a mere shard, of little worth, But to be truck'd for matches—and so forth. If Virro's veins with indigestion glow, They bring him water cool'd in Scythian snow: What! did I late complain a different wine Fell to thy share? A different water's thine! Getulian slaves your vile potations pour, Or the coarse paws of some huge, raw-boned Moor, Whose hideous form the stoutest would affray, If met, by moonlight, near the Latian way: On him, a youth, the flower of Asia waits, So dearly purchased, that the joint estates Of Tullus, Ancus, would not yield the sum, Nor all the wealth—of all the kings of Rome! Bear this in mind; and when the cup you need, Look to your own Getulian Ganymede; A page who cost so much, will ne'er, be sure, Come at your beck: he heeds not, he, the poor; But, of his youth and beauty justly vain, Trips by them, with indifference, or disdain. If call'd, he hears not, or, with rage inflamed— Indignant, that his services are claim'd By an old client, who, ye gods! commands, And sits at ease, while his superiour stands! Such proud, audacious minions swarm in Rome, And trample on the poor, where'er they come. Mark with what insolence another thrusts, Before your plate, th' impenetrable crusts, Black, mouldy fragments, which defy the saw, The mere despair of every aching jaw! While manchets, of the finest flour, are set Before your lord; but be you mindful, yet, And taste not, touch not: of the pantler stand In trembling awe, and check your desperate hand— Yet, should you dare—a slave springs forth, to wrest The sacred morsel from you. “Saucy guest,” He frowns, and mutters, “wilt thou ne'er divine, “What's for thy patron's tooth, and what for thine? “Never take notice from what tray thou'rt fed, “Nor know the colour of thy proper bread?” Was it for this, the baffled client cries, The tears indignant starting from his eyes, Was it for this, I left my wife ere day, And up the bleak Esquilian urged my way, While the wind howl'd, the hail-storm beat amain, And my cloak smoak'd beneath the driving rain! But lo, a lobster introduced in state, Stretches, enormous, o'er the bending plate! Proud of a length of tail, he seems to eye The humbler guests with scorn, as towering by, He takes the place of honour at the board, And crown'd with costly pickles, greets his lord! A crab is yours, ill garnish'd and ill fed, With half an egg—a supper for the dead! He pours Venafran oil upon his fish, While the stale coleworts in your wooden dish, Stink of the lamp; for such to you is thrown, Such rancid grease, as Africk sends to town; So strong! that when her factors seek the bath, All wind, and all avoid, the noisome path; So pestilent! that her own serpents fly The horrid stench, or meet it but to die. See! a sur-mullet now before him set, From Corsica, or isles more distant yet, Brought post to Rome; since Ostia's shores no more, Supply the insatiate glutton, as of yore, Thinn'd by the net, whose everlasting throw Allows no Tuscan fish, in peace, to grow. Still luxury yawns, unfill'd; the nations rise, And ransack all their coasts for fresh supplies: Thence come your presents; thence, as rumour tells, The dainties Lenas buys, Aurelia sells. A lamprey next, from the Sicilian straits, Of more than common size, on Virro waits— For oft as Auster seeks his cave, and flings The cumbrous moisture from his dripping wings, Forth flies the daring fisher, lured by gain, While rocks oppose, and whirlpools threat in vain. To you an eel is brought, whose slender make, Speaks him a famish'd cousin to the snake; Or some frost-bitten pike, who, day by day, Through half the city's ordure, suck'd his way! Would Virro deign to hear me, I could give A few brief hints:—We look not to receive, What Seneca, what Cotta used to send, What the good Piso, to an humble friend;— For bounty once preferr'd a fairer claim, Than birth or power, to honourable fame: No; all we ask (and you may this afford,) Is simply—civil treatment at your board; Indulge us here; and be, like numbers more, Rich to yourself, to your dependents poor! Vain hope! Near him a goose's liver lies, A capon, equal to a goose in size; A boar, too, smokes, like that which fell, of old, By the famed hero, with the locks of gold. Last, if the spring its genial influence shed, And welcome thunders call them from their bed, Large mushrooms enter: Ravish'd with their size, “O Libya, keep thy grain!” Alledius cries, “And bid thy oxen to their stalls retreat, “Nor, while thou grow'st such mushrooms, think of wheat!” Meanwhile, to put your patience to the test, Lo! the spruce carver, to his task addrest, Skips, like a harlequin, from place to place, And waves his knife with pantomimick grace, Till every dish be ranged, and every joint Severed, by nicest rules, from point to point. You think this folly—'tis a simple thought— To such perfection, now, is carving brought, That different gestures, by our curious men, Are used for different dishes, hare and hen. But, think whate'er you may, your comments spare; For should you, like a free-born Roman, dare To hint your thoughts, forth springs some sturdy groom, And drags you straight, heels foremost, from the room! Does Virro ever pledge you? ever sip The liquor touch'd by your unhallow'd lip? Or is there one of all your tribe so free, So desperate, as to say—“Sir, drink to me?” O, there is much, that never can be spoke By a poor client, in a threadbare cloak! But should some godlike man, more kind than fate, Some god, present you with a knight's estate, Heavens, what a change! how infinitely dear Would Trebius then become! How great appear, From nothing! Virro, so reserv'd of late, Grows quite familiar: “Brother, send your plate, “Dear brother Trebius! you were wont to say, “You liked this trail, I think—Oblige me, pray.”— O riches!—this “dear brother” is your own, To you this friendship, this respect is shown: But would you now your patron's patron be? Let no young Trebius wanton round your knee, No Trebia, none: a barren wife procures The kindest, truest friends! such then be yours.— Yet, should she breed, and, to augment your joys, Pour in your lap, at once, three bouncing boys, Virro will still, so you be wealthy, deign To toy and prattle with the lisping train; Will have his pockets too with farthings stored, And when the sweet young rogues approach his board, Bring out his pretty corslets for the breast, His nuts, and apples, for each coaxing guest. You champ on spongy toadstools, hateful treat! Fearful of poison, in each bit you eat: He feasts, secure, on mushrooms, fine as those Which Claudius, for his special eating, chose, Till one more fine, provided by his wife, Finish'd at once his feasting, and his life! Apples, as fragrant, and as bright of hue, As those which in Alcinoüs' gardens grew, Mellow'd by constant sunshine; or as those, Which graced the Hesperides, in burnish'd rows; Apples, which you may smell, but never taste, Before your lord and his great friends are placed: While you enjoy mere windfalls; such stale fruit, As serves to mortify the raw recruit, When, arm'd with helm and shield, the lance he throws, And trembles at the shaggy master's blows. You think, perhaps, that Virro treats so ill, To save his gold: no, 'tis to vex you still: For, say, what comedy such mirth can raise, As hunger, tortured thus a thousand ways? No; (if you know it not,) 'tis to excite Your rage, your frenzy, for his mere delight; 'Tis to compel you all your gall to show, And gnash your teeth in agonies of woe. You deem yourself, (such pride inflates your breast,) Forsooth, a freeman, and your patron's guest; He thinks you a vile slave, drawn, by the smell Of his warm kitchen, there; and he thinks well: For who so low, so wretched, as to bear Such treatment twice, whose fortune 'twas, to wear The golden boss; nay, to whose humbler lot, The poor man's ensign fell, the leathern knot! Your palate still beguiles you: Ah, how nice That smoking haunch! now we shall have a slice! Now that half hare is coming! NOW a bit Of that young pullet! now—and thus you sit, Thumbing your bread in silence; watching still, For what has never reach'd you, never will! No more of freedom! 'tis a vain pretence: Your patron treats you like a man of sense. For, if your can, without a murmur, bear, You well deserve the insults which you share. Anon, like voluntary slaves, you'll throw Your humbled necks, beneath the oppressor's blow, Nay, with bare backs, solicit to be beat, And merit such a friend, and such a treat! SATIRE VI. TO URSIDIUS POSTHUMUS. Yes, I believe that Chastity was known, And prized on earth, while Saturn fill'd the throne; When rocks a bleak and scanty shelter gave, When sheep and shepherds throng'd one common cave, And when the mountain wife her couch bestrew'd With skins of beasts, joint tenants of the wood, And reeds, and leaves pluck'd from the neighbouring tree:— A woman, Cynthia, far unlike to thee, Or thee, weak child of fondness and of fears, Whose eyes a sparrow's death suffused with tears: But strong, and reaching to her burly brood Her big-swoll'n breasts, replete with wholesome food, And rougher than her husband, gorged with mast, And frequent belching from the coarse repast. For when the world was new, the race that broke, Unfather'd, from the soil or opening oak, Lived most unlike the men of later times, The puling brood of follies and of crimes. Haply some trace of Chastity remain'd, While Jove, but Jove as yet unbearded, reign'd: Before the Greek bound, by another's head, His doubtful faith; or men, of theft in dread, Had learn'd their herbs and fruitage to immure, But all was unenclosed, and all secure! At length Astrea, from these confines driven, Regain'd by slow degrees, her native heaven; With her retired her sister in disgust, And left the world to rapine, and to lust. 'Tis not a practice, friend, of recent date, But old, establish'd, and inveterate, To climb another's couch, and boldly slight The sacred Genius of the nuptial rite: All other crimes the Age of Iron curst; But that of Silver, saw adulterers first. Yet thou, it seems, art eager to engage Thy witless neck, in this degenerate age! Even now, thy hair the modish curl is taught, By master-hands; even now, the ring is bought; Even now—thou once, Ursidius, hadst thy wits, But thus to talk of wiving!—O, these fits! What more than madness has thy soul possest? What snakes, what Furies, agitate thy breast? Heavens! wilt thou tamely drag the galling chain, While hemp is to be bought, while knives remain? While windows woo thee so divinely high, And Tiber and the Æmilian bridge are nigh?— “O, but the law,” thou criest, “the Julian law, “Will keep my destined wife from every flaw; “Besides, I die for heirs.” Good! and for those, Wilt thou the turtle and the turbot lose, And all the dainties, which the flatterer, still, Heaps on the childless, to secure his Will? But what will hence impossible be held, If thou, old friend, to wedlock art impell'd? If thou, the veriest debauchee in town, With whom wives, widows, every thing went down, Shouldst stretch the unsuspecting neck, and poke Thy foolish nose into the marriage yoke? Thou, famed for scapes, and, by the trembling wife, Thrust in a chest so oft, to save thy life!— But what! Ursidius hopes a mate to gain, Frugal, and chaste, and of the good old strain: Alas, he's frantick! ope a vein with speed, And bleed him copiously, good doctor, bleed. Jewel of men! thy knees to Jove incline, And let a heifer fall at Juno's shrine, If thy researches for a wife be blest, With one, who is not—need I speak the rest? Ah! few the matrons Ceres now can find, Her hallow'd fillets, with chaste hands, to bind; Few whom their fathers with their lips can trust, So strong their filial kisses smack of lust! Go then, prepare to bring your mistress home, And crown your doors with garlands, ere she come.— But will one man suffice, methinks, you cry, For all her wants and wishes? Will one eye! And yet there runs, 'tis said, a wondrous tale, Of some pure maid, who lives—in some lone vale. There she may live; but let the phœnix, placed At Gabii or Fidenæ, prove as chaste, As at her father's farm!—Yet who will swear, That nought is done in night and silence there? Time was, when Jupiter and Mars, we're told, With many a nymph, in woods and caves made bold; And still, perhaps, they may not be too old. Survey our publick places; see you there, One woman worthy of your serious care? See you, through all the crowded benches, one, Whom you might take securely for your own?— Lo! while Bathyllus, with his flexile limbs, Acts Leda, and through every posture swims, Tuccia delights to realize the play, And in lascivious trances melts away; While rustick Thymelè, with curious eye, Marks the quick pant, the lingering, deep-drawn sigh, And while her cheeks with burning blushes glow, Learns this—learns all the city matrons know. Others, when of the theatres bereft, When nothing, but the wrangling bar, is left, In the long, tedious months, which interpose 'Twixt the Cybelian and Plebeian Shows, Sicken for action, and assume the airs, The mask and thyrsus, of their favourite players. —Midst peals of mirth, see Urbicus advance, (Poor Ælia's choice,) and, in a wanton dance, Burlesque Autonoë's woes! the rich engage In higher frolicks, and defraud the stage; Take from Chrysogonus the power to sing, Loose, at vast prices, the comedian's ring, Tempt the tragedian—but I see you moved— Heavens! dream'd you that Quintilian would be loved! Then hie thee, Lentulus, and boldly wed, That the chaste partner of thy fruitful bed May kindly single from this motley race, Some sturdy Glaphyrus, thy brows to grace: Haste; in the narrow streets long scaffolds raise, And deck thy portals with triumphant bays; That, in thy heir, as swath'd in state he lies, The guests may trace Mirmillo's nose and eyes! Hippia, who shared a rich patrician's bed, To Egypt, with a gladiator, fled, While rank Canopus eyed, with strong disgust, This ranker specimen of Roman lust. Without one pang, the profligate resign'd Her husband, sister, sire; gave to the wind Her children's tears; yea, tore herself away, (To strike you more,)—from Paris and the play! And though, in affluence born, her infant head Had press'd the down of an embroider'd bed, She braved the deep, (she long had braved her fame; But this is little—to the courtly dame,) And, with undaunted breast, the changes bore Of many a sea, the swelling and the roar. Have they an honest call, such ills to bear? Cold shiverings seize them, and they shrink with fear; But set illicit pleasure in their eye, Onward they rush, and every toil defy! Summon'd by duty, to attend her lord, How, cries the lady, can I get on board? How bear the dizzy motion? how the smell? But—when the adulterer calls her, all is well! She roams the deck, with pleasure ever new, Tugs at the ropes, and messes with the crew; But with her husband—O, how chang'd the case! Sick! sick! she cries, and vomits in his face; But by what youthful charms, what shape, what air, Was Hippia won, the opprobrious name to bear, Of Fencer's trull? The wanton well might doat! For the sweet Sergius long had scraped his throat, Long look'd for leave to quit the publick stage, Maim'd in his limbs, and verging now to age. Add, that his face was batter'd and decay'd; The helmet on his brow huge galls had made, A wen deform'd his nose, of monstrous size, And sharp rheum trickled from his bloodshot eyes: But then he was a swordsman! that alone, Made every charm, and every grace his own; That made him dearer than her nuptial vows, Dearer than country, sister, children, spouse.— 'Tis blood they love: Let Sergius quit the sword, And he'll appear, at once,—so like her lord! Start you at wrongs that touch a private name, At Hippia's lewdness, and Veiento's shame? Turn to the rivals of the immortal Powers, And mark how like their fortunes are to ours! Claudius had scarce begun his eyes to close, Ere from his pillow Messalina rose; (Accustom'd long the bed of state to slight For the coarse mattress, and the hood of night;) And with one maid, and her dark hair conceal'd Beneath a yellow tire, a strumpet veil'd! She slipt into the stews, unseen, unknown, And hired a cell, yet reeking, for her own. There, flinging off her dress, the imperial whore Stood, with bare breasts and gilded, at the door, And show'd, Britannicus, to all who came, The womb that bore thee, in Lycisca's name! Allured the passers by with many a wile, And ask'd her price, and took it, with a smile. And when the hour of business now was spent, And all the trulls dismiss'd, repining went; Yet what she could, she did; slowly she past, And saw her man, and shut her cell, the last. —Still raging with the fever of desire, Her veins all turgid, and her blood all fire, With joyless pace, the imperial couch she sought, And to her happy spouse (yet slumb'ring) brought, Cheeks rank with sweat, limbs drench'd with poisonous dews, The steam of lamps, and odour of the stews! 'Twere long to tell what philters they provide, What drugs, to set a son-in-law aside. Women, in judgment weak, in feeling strong, By every gust of passion borne along, Act, in their fits, such crimes, that, to be just, The least pernicious of their sins is lust. But why's Cesennia then, you say, adored, And styled the first of women, by her lord? Because she brought him thousands: such the price, It cost the lady to be free from vice!— Not for her charms the wounded lover pined, Nor felt the flame which fires the ardent mind, Plutus, not Cupid, touch'd his sordid heart; And 'twas her dower that wing'd the unerring dart. She brought enough her liberty to buy, And tip the wink before her husband's eye. A wealthy wanton, to a miser wed, Has all the license of a widow'd bed. But yet, Sertorius what I say disproves, For though his Bibula is poor, he loves. True! but examine him; and, on my life, You'll find he loves the beauty, not the wife. Let but a wrinkle on her forehead rise, And time obscure the lustre of her eyes; Let but the moisture leave her flaccid skin, And her teeth blacken, and her cheeks grow thin; And you shall hear the insulting freedman say, “Pack up your trumpery, madam, and away! “Nay, bustle, bustle; here you give offence, “With snivelling night and day:—take your nose hence!”— But, ere that hour arrive, she reigns indeed! Shepherds, and sheep of Canusinian breed, Falernian vineyards, (trifles these,) she craves, And store of boys, and troops of country slaves; Briefly, for all her neighbour has, she sighs, And plagues her doting husband, till he buys. In winter, when the merchant fears to roam, And snow confines the shivering crew at home; She ransacks every shop for precious ware, Here cheapens myrrh and crystal vases; there, That far-famed gem which Berenice wore, The hire of incest, and thence valued more; A brother's present, in that barbarous State, Where kings the Sabbath, barefoot, celebrate; And old indulgence grants a length of life To hogs, that fatten fearless of the knife. What! and is none of all this numerous herd, Worthy your choice? not one, to be preferr'd? Suppose her nobly born, young, rich, and fair, And (though a coal-black swan be far less rare) Chaste as the Sabine wives, who rush'd between The kindred hosts, and closed the unnatural scene; Yet who could bear to lead an humbled life, Curs'd with that veriest plague, a faultless wife!— Some simple rustick at Venusium bred, O let me, rather than Cornelia, wed, If, to great virtues, greater pride she join, And count her ancestors as current coin. Take back, for mercy's sake, thy Hannibal! Away, with vanquish'd Syphax, camp and all! Troop, with the whole of Carthage! I'd be free, From all this pageantry of worth—and thee. “O let, Apollo, let my children live, “And thou, Diana, pity, and forgive;” Amphion cries; “they, they are guiltless all: “The mother sinn'd, let then the mother fall.” In vain he cries; Apollo bends his bow, And, with the children, lays the father low? They fell; while Niobe aspired to place Her birth and blood above Latona's race; And boast her womb,—too fruitful, to be named With that White Sow, for thirty sucklings famed. Beauty and worth are purchased much too dear, If a wife force them hourly on your ear; For, say, what pleasure can you hope to find, Even in this boast, this phœnix of her kind, If, warp'd by pride, on all around she lour, And in your cup more gall than honey pour? Ah! who so blindly wedded to the state, As not to shrink from such a perfect mate, Of every virtue feel the oppressive weight, And curse the worth he loves, seven hours in eight? Some faults, though small, no husband yet can bear: 'Tis now the nauseous cant, that none is fair, Unless her thoughts in attick terms she dress; A mere Cecropian of a Sulmoness! All now is Greek: in Greek their souls they pour, In Greek their fears, hopes, joys;—what would you more? In Greek they clasp their lovers. We allow These fooleries, to girls: but thou, O thou, Who tremblest on the verge of eighty-eight, To Greek it still!—'tis, now, a day too late. Foh! how it savours of the dregs of lust, When an old hag, whose blandishments disgust, Affects the infant lisp, the girlish squeak, And mumbles out, “My life! My soul!” in Greek! Words, which the secret sheets alone should hear, But which she trumpets in the publick ear. And words, indeed, have power—But though she woo In softer strains than e'er Carpophorus knew, Her wrinkles still employ her favourite's cares; And while she murmurs love, he counts her years! But tell me;—if thou canst not love a wife, Made thine by every tie, and thine for life, Why wed at all? why waste the wine and cakes, The queasy-stomach'd guest, at parting, takes? And the rich present, which the bridal right Claims for the favours of the happy night? The charger, where, triumphantly inscroll'd, The Dacian Hero shines in current gold! If thou canst love, and thy besotted mind Is, so uxoriously, to one inclined, Then bow thy neck, and with submissive air, Receive the yoke—thou must for ever wear. To a fond spouse, a wife no mercy shows:— Though warm'd with equal fires, she mocks his woes, And triumphs in his spoils: her wayward will Defeats his bliss, and turns his good to ill! Nought must be given, if she opposes; nought, If she opposes, must be sold or bought; She tells him where to love, and where to hate, Shuts out the ancient friend, whose beard his gate Knew, from its downy, to its hoary state: And when pimps, parasites, of all degrees, Have power to will their fortunes as they please, She dictates his; and impudently dares, To name his very rivals for his heirs! “Go, crucify that slave.” For what offence? Who the accuser? Where the evidence? For when the life of man is in debate, No time can be too long, no care too great; Hear all, weigh all with caution, I advise— “Thou sniveller! is a slave a man?” she cries. “He's innocent! be't so:—'tis my command, “My will; let that, sir, for a reason stand.” Thus the virago triumphs, thus she reigns: Anon she sickens of her first domains, And seeks for new; husband on husband takes, Till of her bridal veil one rent she makes. Again she tires, again for change she burns, And to the bed she lately left returns, While the fresh garlands, and unfaded boughs, Yet deck the portal of her wondering spouse. Thus swells the list; eight husbands in five years: A rare inscription for their sepulchres! While your wife's mother lives, expect no peace. She teaches her, with savage joy, to fleece A bankrupt spouse: kind creature! she befriends The lover's hopes, and, when her daughter sends An answer to his prayer, the style inspects, Softens the cruel, and the wrong corrects: Experienced bawd! she blinds, or bribes all eyes, And brings the adulterer, in despite of spies. And now the farce begins; the lady falls “Sick, sick, oh! sick;” and for the doctor calls: Sweltering she lies till the dull visit's o'er, While the rank letcher, at the closet door, Lurking in silence, maddens with delay, And in his own impatience melts away. Nor count it strange: What mother e'er was known, To teach severer morals than her own?— No;—with their daughters' lusts they swell their stores, And thrive as bawds, when out of date as whores! Women support the bar: they love the law, And raise litigious questions for a straw; They meet in private, and prepare the Bill, Draw up the Instructions with a lawyer's skill, Suggest to Celsus where the merits lie, And dictate points for statement, or reply. Nay more, they fence! who has not mark'd their oil, Their purple rugs, for this preposterous toil? Room for the lady—lo! she seeks the list, And fiercely tilts at her antagonist, A post! which, with her buckler, she provokes, And bores and batters with repeated strokes; Till all the fencer's art can do she shows, And the glad master interrupts her blows. O worthy, sure, to head those wanton dames, Who foot it naked at the Floral Games; Unless, with nobler daring, she aspire, And tempt the Arena's bloody field—for hire! What sense of shame is to that female known, Who envies our pursuits, and hates her own? Yet would she not, though proud in arms to shine, (True woman still) her sex for ours resign; For there's a thing she loves beyond compare, And we, alas! have no advantage there.— Heavens! with what glee a husband must behold His wife's accoutrements, in publick, sold; And auctioneers displaying to the throng, Her crest, her belt, her gauntlet, and her thong! Or, if in wilder frolicks she engage, And take her private lessons for the stage, Then three-fold rapture must expand his breast, To see her greaves “a-going,” with the rest. Yet these are they, the tender souls! who sweat In muslin, and in silk expire with heat.— Mark, with what force, as the full blow descends, She thunders “hah!” again, how low she bends Beneath the opposer's stroke; how firm she rests, Poised on her hams, and every step contests: How close tuck'd up for fight, behind, before, Then laugh—to see her squat, when all is o'er! Daughters of Lepidus, and Gurges old, And blind Metellus, did ye e'er behold Asylla (though a fencer's trull confest) Tilt at a stake, thus impudently drest! 'Tis night; yet hope no slumbers with your wife; The nuptial bed is still the scene of strife: There lives the keen debate, the clamorous brawl, And quiet “never comes, that comes to all.” Fierce as a tigress plunder'd of her young, Rage fires her breast, and loosens all her tongue, When, conscious of her guilt, she feigns to groan, And chides your loose amours, to hide her own; Storms at the scandal of your baser flames, And weeps her injuries from imagined names, With tears that, marshall'd, at their station stand, And flow impassion'd, as she gives command. You think those showers her true affection prove, And deem yourself—so happy, in her love! With fond caresses strive her heart to cheer, And from her eyelids suck the starting tear: —But could you now examine the scrutore, Of this most loving, this most jealous whore, What amorous lays, what letters would you see, Proofs, damning proofs, of her sincerity! But these are doubtful—Put a clearer case: Suppose her taken in a loose embrace, A slave's or knight's. Now, my Quintilian, come, And fashion an excuse. What! you are dumb? Then, let the lady speak. “Was't not agreed “The man might please himself?” It was; proceed. “Then, so may I”—O, Jupiter! “No oath: “Man is a general term, and takes in both.” When once surprised, the sex all shame forego; And more audacious, as more guilty, grow. Whence shall these prodigies of vice be traced? From wealth, my friend. Our matrons, then, were chaste, When days of labour, nights of short repose, Hands still employ'd the Tuscan wool to tose, Their husbands arm'd, and anxious for the State, And Carthage hovering near the Colline gate, Conspired to keep all thoughts of ill aloof, And banish'd vice, far from their lowly roof. Now, all the evils of long peace are ours; Luxury, more terrible than hostile powers, Her baleful influence wide around has hurl'd, And well avenged the subjugated world! —Since Poverty, our better Genius, fled, Vice, like a deluge, o'er the State has spread. Now, shame to Rome! in every street are found, The essenced Sybarite, with roses crown'd, The gay Miletan, and the Tarentine, Lewd, petulant, and reeling ripe with wine! Wealth first, the ready pander to all sin, Brought foreign manners, foreign vices in; Enervate wealth, and with seductive art, Sapp'd every homebred virtue of the heart; Yes, every:—for what cares the drunken dame, (Take head or tail, to her 'tis just the same,) Who, at deep midnight, on fat oysters sups, And froths with unguents her Falernian cups; Who swallows oceans, till the tables rise, And double lustres dance before her eyes! Thus flush'd, conceive, as Tullia homeward goes, With what contempt she tosses up her nose, At Chastity's hoar fane! what impious jeers, Collatia pours in Maura's tingling ears! Here stop their litters, here they all alight, And squat together in the Goddess' sight:— You pass, aroused at dawn your court to pay, The loathsome scene of their licentious play. Who knows not now, my friend, the secret rites Of the Good Goddess; when the dance excites The boiling blood; when, to distraction wound, By wine, and musick's stimulating sound, The mænads of Priapus, with wild air, Howl horrible, and toss their flowing hair! Then, how the wine at every pore o'erflows! How the eye sparkles! how the bosom glows! How the cheek burns! and, as the passions rise, How the strong feeling bursts in eager cries!— Saufeia now springs forth, and tries a fall With the town prostitutes, and throws them all; But yields, herself, to Medullina, known For parts, and powers, superiour to her own. Maids, mistresses, alike the contest share, And 'tis not always birth that triumphs there. Nothing is feign'd in this accursed game: 'Tis genuine all; and such as would inflame The frozen age of Priam, and inspire, The ruptur'd, bedrid Nestor with desire. Stung with their mimick feats, a hollow groan Of lust breaks forth; the sex, the sex, is shown! And one loud yell re-echoes through the den, “Now, now, 'tis lawful! now admit the men!” There's none arrived. “Not yet! then scour the street, “And bring us quickly, here, the first you meet.” There's none abroad, “Then fetch our slaves.” They're gone. “Then hire a waterman.” There's none. “Not one!”— Nature's strong barrier scarcely now restrains The baffled fury in their boiling veins! And would to heaven our ancient rites were free!— But Africa and India, earth and sea, Have heard, what singing-wench produced his ware, Vast as two Anti-Catos, there, even there, Where the he-mouse, in reverence, lies conceal'd, And every picture of a male is veil'd. And who was then a scoffer? who despised The simple rites by infant Rome devised, The wooden bowl of pious Numa's day, The coarse brown dish, and pot of homely clay? Now, woe the while! religion's in its wane; And daring Clodii swarm in every fane. I hear, old friends, I hear you: “Make all sure: “Let spies surround her, and let bolts secure.” But who shall keep the keepers? Wives contemn Our poor precautions, and begin with them. Lust is the master passion; it inflames, Alike, both high and low; alike, the dames, Who, on tall Syrians' necks, their pomp display, And those who pick, on foot, their miry way. Whene'er Ogulnia to the Circus goes, To emulate the rich, she hires her clothes, Hires followers, friends, and cushions; hires a chair, A nurse, and a trim girl, with golden hair, To slip her billets:—prodigal and poor, She wastes the wreck of her paternal store On smooth-faced wrestlers; wastes her little all, And strips her shivering mansion to the wall! There's many a woman knows distress at home; Not one who feels it, and, ere ruin come, To her small means conforms. Taught by the ant, Men sometimes guard against the extreme of want, And stretch, though late, their providential fears, To food and raiment for their future years: But women never see their wealth decay; With lavish hands they scatter night and day, As if the gold, with vegetative power, Would spring afresh, and bloom from hour to hour; As if the mass its present size would keep, And no expense reduce the eternal heap. Others there are, who centre all their bliss, In the soft eunuch, and the beardless kiss: They need not from his chin avert their face, Nor use abortive drugs, for his embrace. But oh! their joys run high, if he be form'd, When his full veins the fire of love has warm'd; When every part's to full perfection rear'd, And nought of manhood wanting, but the beard. But should the dame in musick take delight, The publick singer is disabled quite: In vain the prætor guards him all he can; She slips the buckle, and enjoys her man. Still in her hand his instrument is found, Thick set with gems, that shed a lustre round; Still o'er his lyre the ivory quill she flings, Still runs divisions on the trembling strings, The trembling strings, which the loved Hedymel Was wont to strike—so sweetly, and so well! These still she holds, with these she sooths her woes, And kisses on the dear, dear wire bestows. A noble matron of the Lamian line, Inquired of Janus, (offering meal and wine,) If Pollio, at the Harmonick Games, would speed, And wear the oaken crown, the victor's meed! What could she for a husband, more, have done, What for an only, an expiring son? Yes; for a harper, the besotted dame Approach'd the altar, reckless of her fame, And veil'd her head, and, with a pious air, Follow'd the Aruspex through the form of prayer; And trembled, and turn'd pale, as he explored The entrails, breathless for the fatal word! But, tell me, father Janus, if you please, Tell me, most ancient of the deities, Is your attention to such suppliants given? If so—there is not much to do in heaven! For a comedian, this consults your will, For a tragedian, that; kept standing, still, By this eternal route, the wretched priest Feels his legs swell, and dies to be releast. But let her rather sing, than roam the streets, And thrust herself in every crowd she meets; Chat with great generals, though her lord be there, With lawless eye, bold front, and bosom bare. She too, with curiosity o'erflows, And all the news of all the world she knows; Knows what in Scythia, what in Thrace is done; The secrets of the step-dame and the son; Who speeds, and who is jilted; and can swear, Who made the widow pregnant, when and where, And what she said, and how she frolick'd there.— She first espied the star, whose baleful ray, O'er Parthia, and Armenia, shed dismay: She watches at the gates, for news to come, And intercepts it, as it enters Rome; Then, fraught with full intelligence, she flies Through every street, and, mingling truth with lies, Tells how Niphates bore down every mound, And pour'd his desolating flood around; How earth, convuls'd, disclosed her caverns hoar, And cities trembled, and—were seen no more! And yet this itch, though never to be cured, Is easier, than her cruelty, endured. Should a poor neighbour's dog but discompose Her rest, a moment, wild with rage she grows; “Ho! whips,” she cries, “and flay that brute accurst; “But flay that rascal, there, who owns him, first.” Dangerous to meet while in these frantick airs, And terrible to look at, she prepares To bathe at night; she issues her commands, And in long ranks, forth march the obedient bands, With tubs, cloths, oils:—for 'tis her dear delight, To sweat in clamour, tumult, and affright. When her tired arms refuse the balls to ply, And the lewd bath-keeper has rubb'd her dry, She calls to mind each miserable guest, Long since with hunger, and with sleep opprest, And hurries home; all glowing, all athirst, For wine, whole flasks of wine! and swallows, first, Two quarts, to clear her stomach, and excite A ravenous, an unbounded appetite! Huisch! up it comes, good heavens! meat, drink, and all, And flows in purple torrents round the hall; Or a gilt ewer receives the foul contents, And poisons all the house with vinous scents. So, dropt into a vat, a snake is said To drink and spew:—the husband turns his head, Sick to the soul, from this disgusting scene, And struggles to suppress his rising spleen. But she is more intolerable yet, Who plays the critick, when at table set; Calls Virgil charming, and attempts to prove, Poor Dido right, in venturing all for love. From Maro, and Mæonides, she quotes The striking passages, and, while she notes Their beauties and defects, adjusts her scales, And accurately weighs, which bard prevails. The astonish'd guests sit mute: grammarians yield, Loud rhetoricians, baffled, quit the field; Even auctioneers and lawyers stand aghast, And not a woman speaks!—So thick, and fast, The wordy shower descends, that you would swear, A thousand bells were jangling in your ear, A thousand basins clattering. Vex no more, Your trumpets, and your timbrels, as of yore, To ease the labouring moon; her single yell Can drown their clangour, and dissolve the spell. She lectures too in Ethicks, and declaims, On the Chief Good!—but, surely, she who aims To seem too learn'd, should take the male array; A hog, due offering, to Sylvanus slay, And, with the Stoick's privilege, repair To farthing baths, and strip in publick there! O, never may the partner of my bed, With subtleties of logick stuff her head; Nor whirl her rapid syllogisms around, Nor with imperfect enthymemes confound! Enough for me, if common things she know, And boast the little learning schools bestow I hate the female pedagogue, who pores O'er her Palæmon hourly; who explores All modes of speech, regardless of the sense, But tremblingly alive to mood and tense: Who puzzles me with many an uncouth phrase, From some old canticle of Numa's days; Corrects her country friends, and cannot hear Her husband solecise, without a sneer! A woman stops at nothing, when she wears Rich emeralds round her neck, and, in her ears, Pearls of enormous size; these justify Her faults, and make all lawful in her eye. Sure, of all ills with which mankind are curst, A wife who brings you money is the worst. Behold! her face a spectacle appears, Bloated, and foul, and plaister'd to the ears, With viscous paste:—the husband looks askew, And sticks his lips in this detested glue. She meets the adulterer bath'd, perfumed, and drest, But rots in filth at home, a very pest! For him she breathes of nard; for him alone, She makes the sweets of Araby her own; For him, at length, she ventures to uncase, Scales the first layer of roughcast from her face, And, while the maids to know her now begin, Clears, with that precious milk, her frowzy skin, For which, though exiled to the frozen main, She'd lead a drove of asses in her train! But tell me yet; this thing, thus daub'd and oil'd, Thus poulticed, plaister'd, baked by turns and boil'd, Thus with pomatums, ointments, lacker'd o'er, Is it a face, Ursidius, or a sore? 'Tis worth a little labour, to survey Our wives more near, and trace 'em through the day. If, dreadful to relate! the night foregone, The husband turn'd his back, or lay alone, All, all is lost; the housekeeper is stripp'd, The tiremaid chidden, and the chairman whipp'd: Rods, cords, and thongs, avenge the master's sleep, And force the guiltless house to wake, and weep. There are, who hire a beadle by the year, To lash their servants round; who, pleased to hear The eternal thong, bid him lay on, while they, At perfect ease, the silkman's stores survey, Chat with their female gossips, or replace The crack'd enamel on their treacherous face. No respite yet:—they leisurely hum o'er The countless items of the day before, And bid him still lay on; till, faint with toil, He drops the scourge; when, with a rancorous smile, “Begone!” they thunder in a horrid tone, “Now your accounts are settled, rogues, begone!” But should she wish with nicer care to dress, And now the hour of assignation press, (Whether the adulterer, for her coming, wait In Isis' fane, to bawdry consecrate, Or in Lucullus' walks,) the house appears, A true Sicilian court, all gloom and tears. The wretched Psecas, for the whip prepared, With locks dishevell'd, and with shoulders bared, Attempts her hair: fire flashes from her eyes, And, “Strumpet! why this curl so high?” she cries. Instant the lash, without remorse, is plied, And the blood stains her bosom, back, and side. But why this fury?—Is the girl to blame, If your air shocks you, or your features shame? Another, trembling, on the left, prepares To open, and arrange the straggling hairs In ringlets trim: meanwhile, the council meet: And first the nurse, a personage discreet, Late from the toilet to the wheel removed, (The effect of time,) yet still of taste approved, Gives her opinion: then the rest, in course, As age, or practice, lends their judgment force. So warm they grow, and so much pains they take, You'd think her honour, or her life at stake! So high they build her head, such tiers on tiers, With wary hands, they pile, that she appears, Andromache, before:—and what, behind? A dwarf, a creature of a different kind:— Meanwhile, engross'd by these important cares, She thinks not on her lord's distrest affairs, Scarce on himself; but leads a separate life, As if she were his neighbour, not his wife? Or, but in this,—that all control she braves; Hates where he loves, and squanders where he saves. Room for Bellona's frantick votaries! room For Cybele's mad enthusiasts! lo, they come! A lusty semivir, whose part obscene, A broken shell has sever'd smooth and clean, A raw-boned, mitred priest, whom the whole choir Of curtail'd priestlings, reverence and admire, Enters, with his wild rout; and bids the fair, Of autumn, and its sultry blasts, beware, Unless she lustrate, with an hundred eggs, Her household straight:—then, impudently begs Her cast-off clothes, that every plague they fear, May enter them, and expiate all the year! But lo! another tribe! at whose command, See her, in winter, near the Tiber stand, Break the thick ice, and, ere the sun appears, Plunge in the crashing eddy to the ears; Then, shivering from the keen and eager breeze, Crawl round the banks, on bare and bleeding knees. Should milkwhite Iö bid, from Meroë's isle, She'd fetch the sunburnt waters of the Nile, To sprinkle in her fane; for she, it seems, Has heavenly visitations, in her dreams— Mark the pure soul, with whom the gods delight, To hold high converse, at the noon of night! For this she cherishes above the rest, Her Iö's favourite priest, a knave profest, A holy hypocrite, who strolls abroad, With his Anubis, his dog-headed god! Girt by a linen-clad, a bald-pate crew, Of howling vagrants, who their cries renew, In every street, as up and down they run, To find Osire, fit father to fit son! He sues for pardon, when the liquorish dame Abstains not from the interdicted game, On high and solemn days; for great the crime, To stain the nuptial couch at such a time, And great the atonement due;—the silver snake, Abhorrent of the deed, was seen to quake! Yet he prevails:—Osiris hears his prayers, And, soften'd by a goose, the culprit spares. Without her badge, a Jewess now draws near, And, trembling, begs a trifle in her ear. No common personage! she knows full well The laws of Solyma, and she can tell The dark decrees of heaven; a priestess she, An hierarch of the consecrated tree! Moved by these claims thus modestly set forth, She gives her a few coins of little worth; For Jews are moderate, and, for farthing fees, Will sell what fortune, or what dreams you please. The prophetess dismiss'd, a Syrian sage Now enters, and explores the future page, In a dove's entrails: there he sees exprest, A youthful lover; there, a rich bequest, From some kind dotard: then a chick he takes, And in its breast, and in a puppy's, rakes, And sometimes in—an infant's: he will teach The art to others, and, when taught, impeach! But chiefly in Chaldeans she believes: Whate'er they say, with reverence she receives, As if from Hammon's secret fount it came; Since Delphi now, if we may credit fame, Gives no responses, and a long dark night, Conceals the future hour, from mortal sight. Of these, the chief (such credit guilt obtains!) Is he, who, banish'd oft, and oft in chains, Stands forth the veriest knave; he who foretold The death of Galba,—to his rival sold! No juggler must for fame or profit hope, Who has not narrowly escaped the rope; Begg'd hard for exile, and, by special grace, Obtain'd confinement in some desert place.— To him your Tanaquil applies, in doubt How long her jaundiced mother may hold out; But first, how long her husband: next inquires, When she shall follow, to their funeral pyres, Her sisters, and her uncles; last, if fate Will kindly lengthen out the adulterer's date, Beyond her own;—content, if he but live, And sure that heaven has nothing more to give! Yet she may still be suffer'd; for, what woes The louring aspect of old Saturn shows; Or in what sign bright Venus ought to rise, To shed her mildest influence from the skies; Or what fore-fated month to gain is given, And what to loss, (the mysteries of heaven,) She knows not, nor pretends to know: but flee The dame, whose Manual of Astrology Still dangles at her side, smooth as chafed gum, And fretted by her everlasting thumb!— Deep in the Science now, she leaves her mate To go, or stay; but will not share his fate, Withheld by trines and sextiles; she will look, Before her chair be order'd, in the book, For the fit hour; an itching eye endure, Nor, till her scheme be raised, attempt the cure; Nay, languishing in bed, receive no meat, Till Petosyris bid her rise and eat. The curse is universal: high and low, Are mad alike the future hour to know. The rich consult a Babylonian seer, Skill'd in the mysteries of either sphere; Or a gray-headed priest, hired by the state, To watch the lightning, and to expiate. The middle sort, a quack, at whose command They lift the forehead, and make bare the hand; While the sly letcher in the table pries, And claps it wantonly, with gloating eyes. The poor apply to humbler cheats, still found Beside the Circus wall, or city mound; While she, whose neck no golden trinket bears, To the dry ditch, or dolphin's tower, repairs, And anxiously inquires, which she shall choose, The tapster, or old-clothes man? which refuse? Yet these the pangs of childbirth undergo, And all the yearnings of a mother know; These, urged by want, assume the nurse's care, And learn to breed the children which they bear. Those shun both toil and danger; for, though sped, The wealthy dame is seldom brought to bed: Such the dire power of drugs; and such the skill, They boast, to cause miscarriages at will! Weep'st thou? O fool! the blest invention hail, And give the potion, if the gossips fail; For, should thy wife her nine months burthen bear, An Æthiop's offspring might thy fortunes heir; A sooty thing, fit only to affray, And, seen at morn, to poison all the day! Supposititious breeds, the hope, and joy Of fond, believing, husbands, I pass by; The beggars' bantlings, spawn'd in open air, And left by some pond side, to perish there.— From hence your Flamens, hence your Salians come; Your Scauri, chiefs and magistrates of Rome! Fortune stands tittering by, in playful mood, And smiles, complacent, on the sprawling brood; Takes them all naked to her fostering arms, Feeds from her mouth, and in her bosom warms: Then, to the mansions of the great, she bears The precious brats, and, for herself, prepares A secret farce; adopts them for her own: And when her nurslings are to manhood grown, She brings them forth, rejoiced to see them sped, And wealth and honours dropping on their head! Some purchase charms, some, more pernicious still, Thessalian philters, to subdue the will Of an uxorious spouse, and make him bear, Blows, insults, all a saucy wife can dare. Hence that swift lapse to second childhood; hence, Those vapours which envelop every sense; This strange forgetfulness from hour to hour; And well, if this be all:—more fatal power, More terrible effects, the dose may have, And force you, like Caligula, to rave, When his Cæsonia squeezed into the bowl, The dire excrescence of a new-dropt foal.— Then Uproar rose; the universal chain Of Order snapp'd, and Anarchy's wild reign Came on apace, as if the queen of heaven Had fired the Thunderer, and to madness driven. Thy mushroom, Agrippine! was innocent, To this accursed draught; that only sent One palsied, bedrid sot, with gummy eyes, And slavering lips, heels foremost to the skies: This, to wild fury roused a bloody mind, And call'd for fire and sword; this potion join'd, In one promiscuous slaughter, high and low, And levell'd half the nation at a blow. Such is the power of philters! such the ill, One sorceress can effect by wicked skill! They hate their husband's spurious issue:—this, If this were all, were not, perhaps, amiss: But they go further; and 'tis now some time, Since poisoning sons-in-law scarce seem'd a crime. Mark then, ye fatherless! what I advise, And trust, O, trust no dainties, if you're wise: Ye heirs to large estates! touch not that fare, Your mother's fingers have been busy there; See! it looks livid, swoll'n:—O check your haste, And let your wary fosterfather taste, Whate'er she sets before you: fear her meat, And be the first to look, the last to eat. But this is fiction all! I pass the bound Of Satire, and encroach on Tragick ground! Deserting truth, I choose a fabled theme, And, like the buskin'd bards of Greece, declaim, In deep-mouth'd tones, in swelling strains, on crimes As yet unknown to our Rutulian climes! Would it were so! but Pontia cries aloud, “No, I perform'd it.” See! the fact's avow'd— “I mingled poison for my children, I; “'Twas found upon me, wherefore then deny?” What, two at once, most barbarous viper! two! “Nay, sev'n, had sev'n been mine: believe it true!” Now let us credit what the tragick stage, Displays of Progne, and Medea's rage; Crimes of dire name, which, disbelieved of yore, Become familiar, and revolt no more. Those ancient dames, in scenes of blood were bold, And wrought fell deeds, but not, as ours, for gold:— In every age, we view, with less surprise, Such horrours as from bursts of fury rise, When stormy passions, scorning all control, Rend the mad bosom, and unseat the soul. As when impetuous winds, and driving rain, Mine some huge rock that overhangs the plain, The cumbrous mass descends with thundering force, And spreads resistless ruin in its course. Curse on the woman, who reflects by fits, And in cold blood her cruelties commits!— They see, upon the stage, the Grecian wife Redeeming, with her own, her husband's life; Yet, in her place, would willingly deprive Their lords of breath, to keep their dogs alive! Abroad, at home, the Belides you meet, And Clytemnestras swarm in every street; But here the difference lies:—those bungling wives, With a blunt axe, hack'd out their husbands' lives; While now, the deed is done with dextrous art, And a drugg'd bowl performs the axe's part. Yet, if-the husband, prescient of his fate, Have fortified his breast with mithridate, She baffles him e'en there, and has recourse To the old weapon, for a last resource. SATIRE VII TO TELESINUS. Yes, all the hopes of learning, 'tis confest, And all the patronage, on Cæsar rest: For he alone the drooping Nine regards— When, now, our best, and most illustrious bards, Quit their ungrateful studies, and retire, Bagnios and bakehouses, for bread, to hire; With humbled views, a life of toil embrace, And deem a crier's business no disgrace; Since Clio, driven by hunger from the shade, Mixes in crowds, and bustles for a trade. And truly, if (the bard's too frequent curse) No coin be found in your Pierian purse, 'Twere not ill done to copy, for the nonce, Machæra, and turn auctioneer at once. Hie, my poetick friend; in accents loud, Commend your precious lumber to the crowd, Old tubs, stools, presses, wrecks of many a chest, Paccius' damn'd plays, Thebes, Tereus, and the rest.— And better so—than haunt the courts of law, And swear, for hire, to what you never saw: Leave this resource to Cappadocian knights, To Gallogreeks, and such newfangled wights, As want, or infamy, has chased from home, And driven, in barefoot multitudes, to Rome. Come, my brave youths!—the genuine sons of rhyme, Who, in sweet numbers, couch the true sublime, Shall, from this hour, no more their fate accuse, Or stoop to pains unworthy of the Muse. Come, my brave youths! your tuneful labours ply, Secure of favour; lo! the imperial eye Looks round, attentive, on each rising bard, For worth to praise, for genius to reward! But if for other patronage you look, And therefore write, and therefore swell your book, Quick, call for wood, and let the flames devour The hapless produce of the studious hour; Or lock it up, to moths and worms a prey, And break your pens, and fling your ink away:— Or pour it rather o'er your epick flights, Your battles, sieges, (fruit of sleepless nights,) Pour it, mistaken men, who rack your brains, In dungeons, cocklofts, for heroick strains; Who toil and sweat to purchase mere renown, A meagre statue, and an ivy crown! Here bound your expectations: for the great, Grown, wisely, covetous, have learn'd, of late, To praise, and only praise, the high-wrought strain, As boys, the bird of Juno's glittering train. Meanwhile those vigorous years, so fit to bear The toils of agriculture, commerce, war, Spent in this idle trade, decline apace, And age, unthought of, stares you in the face:— O then, appall'd to find your better days Have earn'd you nought but poverty and praise, At all your barren glories you repine, And curse, too late, the unavailing Nine! Hear now, what sneaking ways your patrons find, To save their darling gold:—they pay in kind! Verses, composed in every Muse's spite, To the starv'd bard they, in their turn, recite; And, if they yield to Homer, let him know, 'Tis—that He lived a thousand years ago! But if, inspired with genuine love of fame, A dry rehearsal only, be your aim, The miser's breast with sudden warmth dilates, And lo! he opes his triple-bolted gates; Nay, sends his clients to support your cause, And rouse the tardy audience to applause: But will not spare one farthing, to defray The numerous charges of this glorious day, The desk, where throned in conscious pride, you sit, The joists and beams, th' orchestra and the pit. Still we persist; plough the light sand, and sow Seed after seed, where none can ever grow: Nay, should we, conscious of our fruitless pain, Strive to escape, we strive, alas! in vain; Long habit, and the thirst of praise beset, And close us in the inextricable net. The insatiate itch of scribbling, hateful pest Creeps, like a tetter, through the human breast, Nor knows, nor hopes a cure; since years, which chill All other passions, but inflame the ill! But he, the bard of every age and clime, Of genius fruitful, ardent and sublime, Who, from the glowing mint of fancy, pours No spurious metal, fused from common ores, But gold, to matchless purity refined, And stamp'd with all the godhead in his mind; He whom I feel, but want the power to paint, Springs from a soul impatient of restraint, And free from every care; a soul that loves The Muse's haunts, clear founts, and shady groves. Never, no never, did He wildly rave, And shake his thyrsus in the Aonian cave, Whom poverty kept sober, and the cries Of a lean stomach, clamorous for supplies: No; the wine circled briskly through the veins, When Horace pour'd his dithyrambick strains!— What room for fancy, say, unless the mind, And all its thoughts, to poesy resign'd, Be hurried with resistless force along, By the two kindred Powers of Wine and Song! O! 'tis the exclusive business of a breast Impetuous, uncontroll'd,—not one distrest With household cares, to view the bright abodes, The steeds, the chariots, and the forms of gods: And the fierce Fury, as her snakes she shook, And wither'd the Rutulian with a look! Those snakes, had Virgil no Mæcenas found, Had dropt, in listless length, upon the ground; And the still slumbering trump, groan'd with no mortal sound. Yet we expect, from Lappa's tragick rage, Such scenes as graced, of old, the Athenian stage: Though he, poor man, from hand to mouth be fed, And driven to pawn his furniture for bread! When Numitor is ask'd to serve a friend, “He cannot; he is poor.” Yet he can send Rich presents to his mistress! he can buy Tame lions, and find means to keep them high! What then? the beasts are still the lightest charge; For your starv'd bards have maws so devilish large! Stretch'd in his marble palace, at his ease, Lucan may write, and only ask to please; But what is this, if this be all you give, To Bassus and Serranus? They must live! When Statius fix'd a morning, to recite His Thebaid to the town, with what delight They flock'd to hear! with what fond rapture hung On the sweet strains, made sweeter by his tongue! Yet, while the seats rung with a general peal Of boisterous praise, the bard had lack'd a meal, Unless with Paris he had better sped, And truck'd a virgin tragedy for bread. Mirror of men! he showers, with liberal hands, On needy poets, honours and commands:— An actor's patronage a peer's outgoes, And what the last withholds, the first bestows! —And will you still on Camerinus wait, And Bareas? will you still frequent the great? Ah, rather to the Player your labours take, And, at one lucky stroke, your fortune make! Yet envy not the man who earns hard bread, By tragedy: the Muses' friends are fled!— Mæcenas, Proculeius, Fabius, gone, And Lentulus, and Cotta,—every one! Then worth was cherish'd, then the bard might toil, Secure of favour, o'er the midnight oil; Then all December's revelries refuse, And give the festive moments to the Muse. So fare the tuneful race: but ampler gains Await, no doubt the grave historians' pains! More time, more study they require, and pile Page upon page, heedless of bulk the while, Till, fact conjoin'd to fact with thought intense, The work is closed, at many a ream's expense! Say now, what harvest was there ever found, What golden crop, from this long-labour'd ground? 'Tis barren all: and one poor plodding scribe, Gets more, by framing pleas, than all the tribe. True:—'tis a slothful breed, that, nurst in ease, Soft beds, and whispering shades, alone can please. Say then, what gain the lawyer's toil affords, His sacks of papers, and his war of words? Heavens! how he bellows in our tortured ears; But then, then chiefly, when the client hears, Or one prepared, with vouchers, to attest Some desperate debt, more anxious than the rest, Twitches his elbow: then, his passions rise! Then, forth he puffs the immeasurable lies From his swoll'n lungs! then, the white foam appears, And, drivelling down his beard, his vest besmears! Ask you the profit of this painful race? 'Tis quickly summ'd: Here, the joint fortunes place, Of five-score lawyers; there, Lacerta's sole— And that one charioteer's, shall poise the whole! The Generals take their seats in regal wise. You, my pale Ajax, watch the hour, and rise, In act to plead a trembling client's cause, Before Judge Jolthead—learned in the laws. Now stretch your throat, unhappy man! now raise Your clamours, that, when hoarse, a bunch of bays, Stuck in your garret window, may declare, That some victorious pleader nestles there! O glorious hour! but what your fee, the while? A rope of shrivell'd onions from the Nile, A rusty ham, a jar of broken sprats, And wine, the refuse of our country vats; Five flaggons for four causes! if you hold, Though this indeed be rare, a piece of gold; The brethren, as per contract, on you fall, And share the prize, solicitors and all! Whate'er he asks, Æmilius may command, Though more of law be ours: but lo! there stand, Before his gate, conspicuous from afar, Four stately steeds, yoked to a brazen car: And the great pleader, looking wary round, On a fierce charger that disdains the ground, Levels his threatening spear, in act to throw, And seems to meditate no common blow. Such arts as these, to beggary Matho brought, And such, the ruin of Tongillus wrought, Who, with his troop of slaves, a draggled train, Annoy'd the baths, of his huge oil-horn vain; Swept through the Forum, in a chair of state, To every auction,—villas, slaves, or plate; And, trading on the credit of his dress, Cheapen'd whate'er he saw, though penniless! And some, indeed, have thriven by tricks like these: Purple and violet swell a lawyer's fees; Bustle and show above his means, conduce To business, and profusion proves of use. The vice is universal: Rome confounds The wealthiest;—prodigal beyond all bounds! Could our old pleaders visit earth again, Tully himself would scarce a brief obtain, Unless his robe were purple, and a stone, Diamond or ruby, on his finger shone. The wary plaintiff, ere a fee he gives, Inquires at what expense his counsel lives; Has he eight slaves, ten followers? chairs to wait, And clients to precede his march in state? This Paulus knows full well, and, therefore, hires A ring to plead in; therefore, too, acquires More briefs than Cossus:—preference not unsound, For how should eloquence in rags be found? Who gives poor Basilus a cause of state? When, to avert a trembling culprit's fate, Shews he a weeping mother? or who heeds, How close he argues, and how well he pleads? Unhappy Basilus!—but he is wrong: Would he procure subsistence by his tongue, Let him renounce the forum, and withdraw, To Gaul, or Africk, the dry-nurse of law. But Vectius, yet more desperate than the rest, Has open'd (O that adamantine breast!) A rhetorick school; where striplings rave and storm At tyranny, through many a crowded form.— The exercises lately, sitting, read, Standing, distract his miserable head, And every day, and every hour affords, The selfsame subjects, in the selfsame words; Till, like hash'd cabbage serv'd for each repast, The repetition—kills the wretch at last! Where the main jet of every question lies, And whence, the chief objections may arise, All wish to know; but none the price will pay. “The price,” retorts the scholar, “do you say! What have I learn'd?” There go the master's pains, Because, forsooth, the Arcadian brute lacks brains! And yet this oaf, every sixth morn, prepares To split my head with Hannibal's affairs, While he debates at large, “Whether 'twere right, “To take advantage of the general fright, “And march to Rome; or, by the storm alarm'd, “And all the elements against him arm'd, “The dangerous expedition to delay, “And lead his harass'd troops some other way.” —Sick of the theme, which still returns, and still, The exhausted wretch exclaims, Ask what you will, I'll give it, so you on his sire prevail, To hear, thus oft, the booby's endless tale! So Vectius speeds: his brethren, wiser far, Have shut up school, and hurried to the bar. Adieu the idle fooleries of Greece, The soporifick drug, the golden fleece, The faithless husband, and the abandon'd wife, And Æson, coddled to new light and life, A long adieu! on more productive themes, On actual crimes, the sophist now declaims: Thou too, my friend, wouldst thou my counsel hear, Shouldst free thyself from this ungrateful care; Lest all be lost, and thou reduced, poor sage, To want a tally in thy helpless age! Bread still the lawyer earns; but tell me yet, What your Chrysogonus and Pollio get, (The chief of rhetoricians,) though they teach Our youth of quality, the Art of Speech? Oh, no! the great pursue a nobler end:— Five thousand on a bath, they freely spend; More on a portico, where, while it lours, They ride, and bid defiance to the showers. Shall they, for brighter skies, at home remain, Or dash their pamper'd mules through mud and rain? No: let them pace beneath the stately roof, For there no mire can soil the shining hoof. See next, on proud Numidian columns rise An eating-room, that fronts the eastern skies, And drinks the cooler sun. Expensive these! But, (cost whate'er they may,) the times to please, Sew'rs for arrangement of the board admired, And cooks of taste and skill, must yet be hired. Mid this extravagance, which knows no bounds, Quintilian gets, and hardly gets, ten pounds:— On education, all is grudged as lost, And sons are still a father's lightest cost. Whence has Quintilian, then, his vast estate? Urge not an instance of peculiar fate: Perhaps, by luck. The lucky, I admit, Have all advantages; have beauty, wit, And wisdom, and high blood: the lucky, too, May take, at will, the senatorial shoe; Be first-rate speakers, pleaders, every thing; And, though they croak like frogs, be thought to sing. O, there's a difference, friend, beneath what sign We spring to light, or kindly or malign! Fortune is all: She, as the fancy springs, Makes kings of pedants, and of pedants kings. For, what were Tullius, and Ventidius, say, But great examples of the wondrous sway Of stars, whose mystick influence alone, Bestows, on captives triumphs, slaves, a throne? He, then, is lucky; and, amidst the clan, Ranks with the milk-white crow, or sable swan: While all his hapless brethren count their gains, And execrate, too late, their fruitless pains. Witness thy end, Thrasymachus! and thine, Unblest Charinas!—Thou beheld'st him pine, Thou, Athens! and would'st nought but bane bestow; The only charity—thou seem'st to know! Shades of our sires! O sacred be your rest, And lightly lie the turf upon your breast! Flowers round your urns breathe sweets beyond compare, And spring eternal shed its influence there! You honour'd tutors, now a slighted race, And gave them all a parent's power and place. Achilles, grown a man, the lyre essay'd On his paternal hills, and, while he play'd, With trembling eyed the rod;—and yet, the tail Of the good Centaur, scarcely, then, could fail, To force a smile: such reverence now is rare, And boys with bibs strike Rufus on his chair, Fastidious Rufus, who, with critick rage, Arraign'd the purity of Tully's page! Enough of these. Let the last wretched band, The poor grammarians, say, what liberal hand Rewards their toil: let learn'd Palæmon tell, Who proffers what his skill deserves so well. Yet from this pittance, whatsoe'er it be, (Less, surely, than the rhetorician's fee,) The usher snips off something for his pains, And the purveyor nibbles what remains. Courage, Palæmon! be not over nice, But suffer some abatement in your price; As those who deal in rugs, will ask you high, And sink by pence, and half-pence, till you buy. Yes, suffer this; while something's left to pay Your rising, hours before the dawn of day, When e'en the labouring poor their slumbers take, And not a weaver, not a smith's awake: While something's left, to pay you for the stench Of smouldering lamps, thick spread o'er every bench, Where ropy vapours Virgil's pages soil, And Horace looks one blot, all soot and oil! Even then, the stipend thus reduced, thus small, Without a lawsuit, rarely comes at all. Add yet, ye parents, add to the disgrace, And heap new hardships on this wretched race. Make it a point that all, and every part, Of their own science, be possess'd by heart; That general history with our own they blend, And have all authors at their finger's end: Still ready to inform you, should you meet, And ask them at the bath, or in the street, Who nurs'd Anchises; from what country came The step-dame of Archemorus, what her name; How long Acestes flourish'd, and what store Of generous wine, the Phrygians from him bore— Make it a point too, that, like ductile clay, They mould the tender mind, and, day by day, Bring out the form of Virtue; that they prove, A father to the youths, in care and love; And watch that no obscenities prevail— And trust me, friend, even Argus' self might fail, The busy hands of schoolboys to espy, And the lewd fires which twinkle in their eye. All this, and more, exact; and, having found The man you seek, say—When the year comes round, We'll give thee for thy twelvemonth's anxious pains, As much—as, in an hour, a fencer gains! SATIRE VIII. TO PONTICUS. “Your ancient house!” No more.—I cannot see The wondrous merits of a pedigree: No, Ponticus;—nor of a proud display Of smoaky ancestors, in wax or clay; Æmilius, mounted on his car sublime, Curius, half wasted by the teeth of time, Corvinus, dwindled to a shapeless bust, And high-born Galba, crumbling into dust. What boots it, on the lineal tree to trace, Through many a branch, the founders of our race, Time-honour'd chiefs; if, in their sight, we give A loose to vice, and like low villains live? Say, what avails it, that, on either hand, The stern Numantii, an illustrious band, Frown from the walls, if their degenerate race Waste the long night at dice, before their face? If, staggering, to a drowsy bed they creep, At that prime hour when, starting from their sleep, Their sires the signal of the fight unfurl'd, And drew their legions forth, and won the world? Say, why should Fabius, of the Herculean name, To the great altar, vaunt his lineal claim, If, softer than Euganean lambs, the youth, His wanton limbs, with Ætna's pumice, smooth, And shame his rough-hewn sires? if greedy, vain, If, a vile trafficker in secret bane, He blast his wretched kindred with a bust, For publick vengeance to—reduce to dust! Fond man! though all the heroes of your line Bedeck your halls, and round your galleries shine, In proud display; yet, take this truth from me, Virtue alone is true nobility. Set Cossus, Drusus, Paulus, then, in view, The bright example of their lives pursue; Let these precede the statues of your race, And these, when Consul, of your rods take place. O give me inborn worth! Dare to be just, Firm to your word, and faithful to your trust: These praises hear, at least deserve to hear, I grant your claim, and recognise the peer. Hail! from whatever stock you draw your birth, The son of Cossus, or the son of Earth, All hail! in you, exulting Rome espies Her guardian Power, her great Palladium rise; And shouts like Ægypt, when her priests have found, A new Osiris, for the old one drown'd! But shall we call those noble, who disgrace Their lineage, proud of an illustrious race? Vain thought!—but thus, with many a taunting smile, The dwarf an Atlas, Moor a swan, we style; The crookback'd wench, Europa; and the hound, With age enfeebled, toothless, and unsound, That listless lies, and licks the lamps for food, Lord of the chase, and tyrant of the wood! You, too, beware, lest Satire's piercing eye The slave of guilt through grandeur's blaze espy, And, drawing from your crime some sounding name, Declare at once your greatness, and your shame. Ask you for whom this picture I design? Plautus, thy birth and folly make it thine. Thou vaunt'st thy pedigree, on every side To noble, and imperial blood, allied; As if thy honours by thyself were won, And thou hadst some illustrious action done, To make the world believe thee Julia's heir, And not the offspring of some easy fair, Who, shivering in the wind, near yon dead wall, Plies her vile labour, and is all to all. “Away, away! ye slaves of humblest birth, “Ye dregs of Rome, ye nothings of the earth, “Whose fathers who shall tell! my ancient line “Descends from Cecrops.” Man of blood divine! Live, and enjoy the secret sweets which spring In breasts, affined to so remote a king!— Yet know, amid these “dregs,” low grandeur's scorn, Will those be found whom arts and arms adorn: Some, skill'd to plead a noble blockhead's cause, And solve the dark enigmas of the laws; Some, who the Tigris' hostile banks explore, And plant our eagles on Batavia's shore: While thou, in mean, inglorious pleasure lost, With “Cecrops! Cecrops!” all thou hast to boast, Art a full brother to the crossway stone, Which clowns have chipp'd the head of Hermes on: For 'tis no bar to kindred, that thy block, Is form'd of flesh and blood, and their's of rock. Of beasts, great son of Troy, who vaunts the breed, Unless renown'd for courage, strength, or speed? 'Tis thus we praise the horse,, who mocks our eyes, While, to the goal, with lightning's speed, he flies! Whom many a well-earn'd palm and trophy grace, And the Cirque hails, unrivall'd in the race! —Yes, he is noble, spring from whom he will, Whose footsteps, in the dust, are foremost still; While Hirpine's stock are to the market led, If Victory perch but rarely on their head: For no respect to pedigree is paid, No honour to a sire's illustrious shade. Flung cheaply off, they drag the cumbrous wain, With shoulders bare and bleeding from the chain; Or take, with some blind ass in concert found, At Nepo's mill, their everlasting round. That Rome may, therefore, you, not yours, admire, By virtuous actions, first, to praise aspire; Seek not to shine by borrow'd light alone, But, with your father's glories, blend your own. This to the youth, whom Rumour brands as vain, And swelling—full of his Neronian strain; Perhaps, with truth:—for rarely shall we find, A sense of modesty, in that proud kind. But were my Ponticus content to raise His honours thus, on a forefather's praise, Worthless the while,—'twould tinge my cheeks with shame— 'Tis dangerous building on another's fame, Lest the substructure fail, and, on the ground, Your baseless pile be hurl'd, in fragments, round.— Stretch'd on the plain, the vine's weak tendrils try, To clasp the elm they drop from; fail—and die! Be brave, be just; and, when your country's laws Call you to witness in a dubious cause, Though Phalaris plant his bull before your eye, And, frowning, dictate to your lips the lie, Think it a crime no tears can e'er efface, To purchase safety, with compliance base, At honour's cost, a feverish, span extend, And sacrifice for life, life's only end! Life! 'tis not life—who merits death is dead; Though Gauran oysters for his feasts be spread, Though his limbs drip with exquisite perfume, And the late rose around his temples bloom! O, when the Province, long desired, you gain, Your boiling rage, your lust of wealth restrain, And pity our allies: all Asia grieves— Her blood, her marrow, drain'd by legal thieves. Revere the laws, obey the parent state; Observe what rich rewards the good await, What punishments, the bad: how Tutor sped, While Rome's whole thunder rattled round his head! And yet what boots it, that one spoiler bleed, If still a worse, and still a worse succeed; If neither fear nor shame control their theft, And Pansa seize the little Natta left? Haste then, Chærippus, ere thy rags be known, And sell the few thou yet canst call thine own, And O, conceal the price! 'tis honest craft; Thou couldst not keep the hatchet:—save the haft. Not such the cries of old, nor such the stroke, When first the nations bow'd beneath our yoke. Wealth, then, was theirs, wealth without fear possest. Full every house, and bursting every chest— Crimson, in looms of Sparta taught to glow, And purple, deeply dyed in grain of Co; Busts, to which Myro's touch did motion give, And ivory, taught by Phidias' skill to live: On every side a Polyclete you view'd, And scarce a board without a Mentor stood. These, these, the lust of rapine first inspired, These, Antony and Dolabella fired, And sacrilegious Verres:—so, for Rome They shipp'd their secret plunder; and brought home, More treasures from our friends, in peace obtain'd, Than from our foes, in war, were ever gain'd! Now all is gone! the stallion made a prey, The few brood-mares and oxen swept away, The Lares,—if the sacred hearth possest One little god, that pleased above the rest— Mean spoils, indeed! but such were now their best. Perhaps, you scorn (and may securely scorn) The essenced Greek, whom arts, not arms, adorn: Soft limbs, and spirits by refinement broke, Would feebly struggle with the oppressive yoke. But spare the Gaul, the fierce Illyrian spare, And the rough Spaniard, terrible in war; Spare too the Africk hind, whose ceaseless pain Fills our wide granaries with autumnal grain, And pampers Rome, while weightier cares engage Her precious hours—the Circus and the Stage! For, should you rifle them, O think in time, What spoil would pay the execrable crime, When greedy Marius fleeced them all so late, And bare and bleeding left the hapless state! But chief the brave, and wretched—tremble there; Nor tempt too far the madness of despair: For, should you all their little treasures drain, Helmets, and spears, and swords, would still remain; The plunder'd ne'er want arms. What I foretel, Is no trite apophthegm, but—mark me well— True as a Sibyl's leaf! fix'd as an oracle! If men of worth the posts beneath you hold, And no spruce favourite barter law for gold; If no inherent stain your wife disgrace, Nor, happy-like, she flit from place to place, A fell Celæno, ever on the watch, And ever furious, all she sees to snatch; Then choose what race you will: derive your birth From Picus, or those elder sons of earth, Who shook the throne of heaven; call him your sire, Who first inform'd our clay with living fire; Or single from the songs of ancient days, What tale may suit you, and what parent raise. But—if rash pride, and lust, your bosom sway, If, with stern joy, you ply, from day to day, The ensanguined rods, and head on head demand, Till the tired axe drop from the lictor's hand; Then, every honour, by your father won, Indignant to be borne by such a son, Will, to his blood, oppose your daring claim, And fire a torch, to blaze upon your shame!— Vice glares more strongly in the publick eye, As he who sins, in power or place is high. See! by his great progenitors' remains Fat Damasippus sweeps, with loosen'd reins. Good Consul! he no pride of office feels, But stoops, himself, to clog his headlong wheels. “But this is all by night,” the hero cries. Yet the moon sees! yet the stars stretch their eyes, Full on your shame!—A few short moments wait, And Damasippus quits the pomp of state: Then, proud the experienced driver to display, He mounts his chariot in the face of day, Whirls, with bold front, his grave associate by, And jerks his whip, to catch the senior's eye: Unyokes his weary steeds, and, to requite Their service, feeds and litters them, at night. Meanwhile, 'tis all he can, what time he stands At Jove's high altar, as the law commands, And offers sheep and oxen, he forswears The Eternal King, and gives his silent prayers To thee, Hippona, goddess of the stalls, And gods more vile, dawb'd on the reeking walls! At night, to his old haunts he scours, elate, (The tavern by the Idumean gate) Where, while the host, bedrench'd with liquid sweets, With many a courteous phrase, his entrance greets, And many a smile; the hostess nimbly moves, And gets the flaggon ready, which he loves. Here some, perhaps, my growing warmth may blame: “In youth's wild hours,” they urge, “we did the same.” 'Tis granted, friends; but then we stopp'd in time, Nor hugg'd our darling faults, beyond our prime. Brief let our follies be! and youthful sin Fall, with the firstlings of the manly chin!— Boys we may pity, nay, perhaps, excuse: But Damasippus still frequents the stews, Though, now mature in vigour, ripe in age, Of Cæsar's foes to check the headlong rage, On Tigris' banks, in burnish'd arms, to shine, And sternly guard the Danube, or the Rhine. “The East revolts.” Ho! let the troops repair To Ostium, quick! “But where's the General?” Where! Go, search the taverns; there the chief you'll find, With cut-throats, plund'rers, rogues of every kind, Bier-jobbers, bargemen, drench'd in fumes of wine, And Cybele's priests, mid their loose drums, supine! There none are less, none greater than the rest, There my lord gives, and takes the scurvy jest; There all who can, round the same table sprawl, And there one greasy tankard serves for all. Blessings of birth!—but, Ponticus, a word: Own'd you a slave like this degenerate lord, What were his fate? your Lucan farm to till, Or aid the mules, to turn your Tuscan mill. But Troy's great sons dispense with being good, And boldly sin, by courtesy of blood; Wink at each other's crimes, and look for fame, In what would tinge a cobbler's cheek with shame. And have I wreak'd on such foul deeds my rage, That worse should yet remain to blot my page!— See Damasippus, all his fortune lost, Compell'd, for hire, to play a squealing ghost! While Lentulus, his brother in renown, Performs, with so much art, the perjured clown, And suffers with such grace, that, for his pains, I hold him worthy of—the cross he feigns. Nor deem the heedless rabble void of blame:— Strangers alike to decency and shame, They sit with brazen front, and calmly see The hired patrician's low buffoonery; Laugh at the Fabii's tricks, and grin to hear The cuffs resound from the Mamerci's ear! Who cares how low their blood is sold, how high?— No Nero drives them, now, their fate to try: Freely they come, and freely they expose, Their lives for hire, to grace the publick shows! But grant the worst: suppose the arena here, And there the stage; on which would you appear? The first: for who of death so much in dread, As not to tremble more, the stage to tread, Squat on his hams, in some blind nook to sit, And watch his mistress, in a jealous fit!— But 'tis not strange, that, when the Emperour tunes A scurvy harp, the lords should turn buffoons; The wonder is, they turn not fencers too, Secutors, Retiarians.—and they do! Gracchus steps forth: No sword his thigh invests— No helmet, shield—such armour he detests, Detests and spurns; and impudently stands, With the poised net and trident in his hands. The foe advances—lo! a cast he tries, But misses, and, in frantick terrour, flies. Round the throng'd Cirque; and, anxious to be known, Lifts his bare face, with many a piteous moan. “'Tis he! 'tis he!—I know the Salian vest, “With golden fringes, pendent from the breast; “The Salian bonnet, from whose pointed crown, “The glittering ribands float redundant down. “O spare him, spare!”—The brave Secutor heard, And, blushing, stopp'd the chase; for he preferr'd, Wounds, death itself, to the contemptuous smile, Of conquering one so noble, and—so vile! Who, Nero, so depraved, if choice were free, To hesitate 'twixt Seneca and thee? Whose crimes, so much have they all crimes outgone, Deserve more serpents, apes, and sacks, than one. Not so, thou say'st; there are, whom I could name, As deep in guilt, and as accurs'd in fame; Orestes slew his mother. True; but know, The same effects from different causes flow: A father murder'd at the social board, And heaven's command, unsheath'd his righteous sword. Besides, Orestes, in his wildest mood, Poison'd no cousin, shed no consort's blood, Buried no poniard in a sister's throat, Sung on no publick stage, no Troicks wrote.— This topp'd his frantick crimes! this roused mankind! For what could Galba, what Virginius, find, In the dire annals of that bloody reign, Which call'd for vengeance in a louder strain? Lo here, the arts, the studies that engage The world's great master! on a foreign stage, To prostitute his voice for base renown, And ravish, from the Greeks, a parsley crown! Come then, great prince, great poet! while we throng To greet thee, recent from triumphant song, Come, place the unfading wreath, with reverence meet, On the Domitii's brows! before their feet, The mask and pall of old Thyestes lay, And Menalippé; while, in proud display, From the colossal marble of thy sire, Depends, the boast of Rome, thy conquering lyre! Cethegus! Catiline! whose ancestors, Were nobler born, were higher rank'd, than yours? Yet ye conspired, with more than Gallick hate, To wrap in midnight flames this hapless state; On men and gods your barbarous rage to pour, And deluge Rome with her own children's gore: Horrours, which call'd, indeed, for vengeance dire, For the pitch'd coat and stake, and smouldering fire! But Tully watch'd—your league in silence broke, And crush'd your impious arms, without a stroke. Yes he, poor Arpine, of no name at home, And scarcely rank'd among the knights, at Rome, Secured the trembling town, placed a firm guard In every street, and toil'd in every ward:— And thus, within the walls, the gown obtain'd, More fame, for Tully, than Octavius gain'd, At Actium and Philippi, from a sword, Drench'd in the eternal stream by patriots pour'd! For Rome, free Rome, hail'd him, with loud acclaim, The Father of his Country—glorious name! Another Arpine, train'd the ground to till, Tired of the plough, forsook his native hill, And join'd the camp; where, if his adze was slow, The vine-twig whelk'd his back with many a blow: And yet, when the fierce Cimbri threaten'd Rome With swift, and scarcely evitable doom, This man, in the dread hour, to save her rose, And turn'd the impending ruin on her foes! For which, while ravening birds devour'd the slain, And their huge bones lay whitening on the plain, His high-born colleague to his worth gave way, And took, well pleased, the secondary bay. The Decii were plebeians! mean their name, And mean the parent stock from which they came: Yet they devoted, in the trying hour, Their heads to Earth, and each infernal Power; And by that solemn act, redeem'd from fate, Auxiliars, legions, all the Latian state; More prized than those they saved, in heaven's just estimate! And him, who graced the purple which he wore, (The last good king of Rome,) a bondmaid bore. The Consul's sons, (while storms yet shook the state, And Tarquin thunder'd vengeance at the gate,) Who should, to crown the labours of their sire, Have dared what Cocles, Mutius, might admire, And she, who mock'd the javelins whistling round, And swam the Tiber, then the empire's bound; Had, to the tyrant's rage, the town exposed, But that a slave their dark designs disclosed.— For Him, when stretch'd upon his honour'd bier, The grateful matrons shed the pious tear, While, with stern eye, the patriot and the sire, Saw, by the axe, the high-born pair expire: They fell—just victims to the offended laws, And the first sacrifice to freedom's cause! For me, who nought but innate worth admire, I'd rather vile Thersites were thy sire, So thou wert like Achilles, and couldst wield Vulcanian arms, the terrour of the field, Than that Achilles should thy father be, And, in his offspring, vile Thersites see. And yet, how high soe'er thy pride may trace The long-forgotten founders of thy race, Still must the search with that Asylum end, From whose polluted source we all descend. Haste then, the inquiry haste; secure to find Thy sire some vagrant slave, some bankrupt hind, Some—but I mark the kindling glow of shame, And will not shock thee with a baser name. SATIRE IX. JUVENAL, NÆVOLUS. Jun. Still drooping, Nævolus! What, prithee, say, Portends this show of grief from day to day, This copy of flay'd Marsyas? what dost thou With such a rueful face, and such a brow, As Ravola wore, when caught—Not so cast down, Look'd Pollio, when, of late, he scour'd the town, And, proffering treble rate, from friend to friend, Found none so foolish, none so mad, to lend! But, seriously, for thine's a serious case, Whence came those sudden wrinkles in thy face? I knew thee once, a gay, light-hearted slave, Contented with the little fortune gave; A sprightly guest, of every table free, And famed for modish wit and repartee. Now all's revers'd: dejected is thy mien, Thy locks are like a tangled thicket seen; And every limb, once smooth'd with nicest care, Rank with neglect, a shrubbery of hair! What dost thou with that dull, dead, wither'd look, Like some old debauchee, long ague-shook? All is not well within; for, still we find, The face the unerring index of the mind, And as this feels or fancies joys or woes, That pales with sorrow, or with rapture glows. What should I think? Too sure the scene is changed, And thou, from thy old course of life, estranged: For late, as I remember, at all haunts, Where dames of fashion flock to hire gallants, At Isis and at Ganymede's abodes, At Cybele's, dread mother of the gods, Nay, at chaste Ceres', (for at shame they spurn, And ev'n her temples now to brothels turn,) None was so famed: the favourites of the town, Baffled alike in business and renown, Murmuring retired; wives, daughters, were thy own, And—if the truth must come—not they alone. Næv. Right: and to some this trade has answer'd yet; But not to me: for what is all I get? A drugget cloak, to save my gown from rain, Coarse in its texture, dingy in its grain, And a few pieces of the “second vein!” Fate governs all. Fate, with full sway, presides Even o'er those parts, which modest nature hides; And little, if her genial influence fail, Will vigour stead, or boundless powers avail: Though Virro, gloating on your naked charms, Foam with desire, and woo you to his arms, With many a soothing, many a flattering phrase— For your curs'd pathicks have such winning ways! Hear now this prodigy, this mass impure, Of lust and avarice! “Let us, friend, be sure: “I've given thee this, and this;—now count the sums:” (He counts, and woos the while,) “behold! it comes “To five sestertia, five!—now, look again, “And see how much it overpays thy pain:” What! “overpays?”—but you are form'd for love, And worthy of the cup and couch of Jove! —Will those relieve a client!—those, who grudge A wretched pittance to the painful drudge That toils in their disease?—O mark, my friend, The blooming youth, to whom we presents send, Or on the Female Calends, or the day Which gave him birth! in what a lady-way, He takes our favours as he sits in state, And sees adoring crowds besiege his gate! Insatiate sparrow! whom do your domains, Your numerous hills await, your numerous plains? Regions, which such a tract of land embrace, That kites are tired within the unmeasured space! For you, the purple vine luxuriant glows, On Trifoline's plain, and on Misenus' brows; And hollow Gaurus, from his fruitful hills, Your spacious vaults with generous nectar fills: What were it then, a few poor roods to grant, To one so worn with letchery and want? Sure yonder female, with the child she bred, The dog their playmate, and their little shed, Had, with more justice, been conferr'd on me, Than on a cymbal-beating debauchee! “I'm troublesome;” you say, when I apply, “And give! give! give! is my eternal cry.”— But house-rent due, solicits to be sped, And my sole slave, importunate for bread, Follows me, clamouring in as loud a tone, As Polyphemus, when his prey was flown. Nor will this one suffice, the toil's so great! Another must be bought; and both must eat. What shall I say, when cold December blows, And their bare limbs shrink at the driving snows, What shall I say, their drooping hearts to cheer? “Be merry, boys, the spring will soon be here!” But though my other merits you deny, One yet must be allow'd—that had not I, I, your devoted client, lent my aid, Your wife had to this hour remain'd a maid. You know what motives urged me to the deed, And what was promised, could I but succeed:— Oft in my arms the flying fair I caught, And back to your cold bed, reluctant, brought, Ev'n when she'd cancell'd all her former vows, And now was signing to another spouse. What pains it cost to set these matters right, While you stood whimpering at the door all night, I spare to tell:—a friend, like me, has tied Full many a knot, when ready to divide. Where will you turn you now, sir? whither fly? What, to my charges, first, or last, reply? Is it no merit, speak, ungrateful! none, To give you thus a daughter, or a son, Whom you may breed with credit at your board, And prove yourself a man upon record?— Haste, with triumphal wreaths your gates adorn, You're now a father, now no theme for scorn; My toils have ta'en the opprobrium from your name, And stopt the babbling of malicious fame. A parent's rights you now may proudly share, Now, thank my industry, be named an heir; Take now the whole bequest, with what beside, From lucky windfalls, may in time betide; And other blessings, if I but repeat My pains, and make the number three complete.” Juv. Nay, thou hast reason to complain, I feel: But, what says Virro? Næv. Not a syllable; But, while my wrongs and I unnoticed pass, Hunts out some other drudge, some two-legg'd ass, Enough;—and never, on your life, unfold The secret thus, to you, in friendship told; But let my injuries, undivulged, still rest Within the closest chamber of your breast: How the discovery might be borne, none knows— And your smooth pathicks, are such fatal foes! Virro, who trusts me yet, may soon repent, And hate me for the confidence he lent; With fire and sword my wretched life pursue, As if I'd blabb'd already all I knew. Sad situation mine! for, in your ear, The rich can never buy revenge too dear; And—but enough: be cautious, I entreat, And secret as the Athenian judgment-seat. Juv. And dost thou seriously believe, fond swain, The actions of the great, unknown remain? Poor Corydon! even beasts would silence break, And stocks and stones, if servants did not, speak. Bolt every door, stop every cranny tight, Close every window, put out every light; Let not a whisper reach the listening ear, No noise, no motion; let no soul be near; Yet all that pass'd at the cock's second crow, The neighbouring vintner shall, ere daybreak, know; With what besides the cook and carver's brain, Subtly malicious, can in vengeance feign! For thus they glory, with licentious tongue, To quit the harsh command and galling thong. Should these be mute, some drunkard in the streets, Will pour out all he knows, to all he meets, Force them, unwilling, the long tale to hear, And with his stories drench their hapless ear. Go now, and earnestly of those request, To lock, like me, the secret in their breast: Alas! they hear thee not; and will not sell The dear, dear privilege—to see and tell, For more stolen wine than late Saufeia boused, When, for the people's welfare, she—caroused! Live virtuously:—thus many a reason cries, But chiefly this, that so thou mayst despise Thy servant's tongue; for, lay this truth to heart, The tongue is the vile servant's vilest part: Yet viler he, who lives in constant dread, Of the domestick spies that—eat his bread. Næv. Well have you taught, how we may best disdain The envenom'd babbling of our household train; But this is general, and to all applies:— What, in my proper case, would you advise? After such flattering expectations crost, And so much time, in vain dependence lost? For youth, too transient flower! of life's short day The shortest part, but blossoms—to decay. Lo! while we give the unregarded hour, To revelry and joy, in Pleasure's bower, While now, for rosy wreaths our brows to twine, And now for nymphs we call, and now for wine, The noiseless foot of Time steals swiftly by, And ere we dream of manhood, age is nigh! Juv. Oh, fear not: thou canst never seek in vain, A pathick friend, while these seven hills remain. Hither in crowds the master-misses come, From every point, as to their proper home: One hope has fail'd, another may succeed; Meanwhile do thou on hot eringo feed. Næv. Tell this to happier men; the Fates ne'er meant, Such luck for me; my Clotho is content, When all my toil a bare subsistence gains, And fills my belly, by my back and reins. O, my poor Lares! dear, domestick Powers! To whom I come with incense, cakes, and flowers, When shall my prayers, so long preferr'd in vain, Acceptance find? O, when shall I obtain Enough to free me from the constant dread Of life's worst ill, gray hairs and want of bread? On mortgage, six-score pounds a year, or eight, A little sideboard, which, for overweight, Fabricius would have censured; a stout pair Of hireling Mæsians, to support my chair, In the throng'd Circus: add to these, one slave, Well skill'd to paint, another, to engrave; And I—but let me give these day-dreams o'er— Wish as I may, I ever shall be poor; For when to Fortune I prefer my prayers, The obdurate goddess stops at once her ears; Stops with that wax which saved Ulysses' crew, When by the Syrens' rocks and songs they flew, False songs and treacherous rocks, that all to ruin drew. END OF VOL. I.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">VOL. II. THE SATIRES OF JUVENAL. [cont'd.] SATIRE X. In every clime, from Ganges' distant stream To Gades, gilded by the western beam, Few, from the clouds of mental errour free, In its true light or good or evil see. For what, with reason, do we seek or shun? What plan, how happily soe'er begun, But, finish'd, we our own success lament, And rue the pains, so fatally mispent?— To headlong ruin see whole houses driven, Curs'd with their prayers, by too indulgent heaven! Bewilder'd thus by folly or by fate, We beg pernicious gifts in every state, In peace, in war. A full and rapid flow Of eloquence, lays many a speaker low: Even strength itself is fatal; Milo tries His wondrous arms, and—in the trial dies! But avarice wider spreads her deadly snare, And hoards amass'd with too-successful care, Hoards, which o'er all paternal fortunes rise, As o'er the dolphin towers the whale in size. For this, in other times, at Nero's word, The ruffian bands unsheath'd the murderous sword, Rush'd to the swelling coffers of the great, Chaced Lateranus from his lordly seat, Besieged too-wealthy Seneca's wide walls, And closed, terrifick, round Longinus' halls: While sweetly in their cocklofts slept the poor, And heard no soldier thundering at their door. The traveller, freighted with a little wealth, Sets forth at night, and wins his way by stealth: Even then, he fears the bludgeon and the blade, And starts and trembles at a rush's shade; While, void of care, the beggar trips along, And, in the spoiler's presence, trolls his song. The first great wish that all with rapture own, The general cry, to every temple known, Is, gold, gold, gold!—“and let, all-gracious Powers, “The largest chest the Forum boasts, be ours!” Yet none from earthen bowls destruction sip: Dread then the draught, when, mantling, at your lip, The goblet sparkles, radiant from the mine, And the broad gold inflames the ruby wine. And do we, now, admire the stories told, Of the two Sages, so renown'd of old; How this for ever laugh'd, whene'er he stept Beyond the threshold; that, for ever wept? But all can laugh:—the wonder yet appears, What fount supplied the eternal stream of tears! Democritus, at every step he took, His sides with unextinguish'd laughter shook, Though, in his days, Abdera's simple towns, No fasces knew, chairs, litters, purple gowns.— What! had he seen, in his triumphal car, Amid the dusty Cirque, conspicuous far, The Prætor perch'd aloft, superbly drest In Jove's proud tunick, with a trailing vest Of Tyrian tapestry, and o'er him spread A crown, too bulky for a mortal head, Borne by a sweating slave, maintain'd to ride In the same car, and mortify his pride! Add now the bird, that, with expanded wing, From the raised sceptre, seems prepared to spring; And trumpets here; and there the long parade Of duteous friends, who head the cavalcade; Add too, the zeal of clients robed in white, Who hang upon his reins, and grace the sight, Unbribed, unbought,—save by the dole, at night! Yes, in those days, in every varied scene, The good old man found matter for his spleen: A wondrous sage! whose story makes it clear, That men may rise in folly's atmosphere, Beneath Bœotian fogs, of soul sublime, And great examples to the coming time.— He laugh'd aloud to see the vulgar fears, Laugh'd at their joys, and sometimes at their tears: Secure the while, he mock'd at Fortune's frown, And when she threaten'd, bade her hang or drown! Superfluous then, or fatal, is the prayer, Which, to the Immortals' knees, we fondly bear. Some, Power hurls headlong from her envied height, Some, the broad tablet, flashing on the sight, With titles, names: the statues, tumbled down, Are dragg'd by hooting thousands through the town; The brazen cars torn rudely from the yoke, And, with the blameless steeds, to shivers broke— Then roar the fires! the sooty artist blows, And all Sejanus in the furnace glows; Sejanus, once so honour'd, so adored, And only second to the world's great lord, Runs glittering from the mould, in cups and cans, Basons and ewers, plates, pitchers, pots and pans. “Crown all your doors with bay, triumphant bay! “Sacred to Jove, the milkwhite victim slay; “For lo! where great Sejanus by the throng, “A joyful spectacle! is dragg'd along. “What lips! what cheeks! hah, traitour!—for my part, “I never loved the fellow—in my heart.” ‘But tell me; Why, was he adjudged to bleed? ‘And who discover'd? and who proved the deed?’ “Proved!—a huge, wordy letter came to day “From Capreæ.” Good! what think the people? They! They follow fortune, as of old, and hate, With their whole souls, the victim of the state. Yet would the herd, thus zealous, thus on fire, Had Nurscia met the Tuscan's fond desire, And crush'd the unwary prince, have all combined, And hail'd Sejanus, Master of mankind! For since their votes have been no longer bought, All publick care has vanish'd from their thought; And those who once, with unresisted sway, Gave armies, empire, every thing, away, For two poor claims have long renounced the whole, And only ask,—the Circus and the Dole. “But there are more to suffer.” ‘So I find; ‘A fire so fierce, for one was ne'er design'd. ‘I met my friend Brutidius, and I fear, ‘From his pale looks, he thinks there's danger near. ‘What, if this Ajax, in his frenzy, strike, ‘Suspicious of our zeal, at all alike!’ “True: fly we then, our loyalty to show; “And trample on the carcase of his foe, “While yet exposed, on Tiber's banks it lies”— ‘But let our slaves be there,’ another cries: “Yes; let them (lest our ardour they forswear, “And drag us, pinion'd, to the Bar,) be there.” Thus of the favourite's fall the converse ran, And thus the whisper pass'd from man to man. Lured by the splendour of his happier hour, Wouldst thou possess Sejanus' wealth and power; See crowds of suppliants at thy levee wait, Give this to sway the army, that the state; And keep a prince in ward, retired to reign, O'er Capreæ's crags, with his Chaldean train? Yes, yes, thou wouldst (for I can read thy breast) Enjoy that favour which he once possest, Assume all offices, grasp all commands, The Imperial Horse, and the Prætorian Bands. 'Tis nature, this; even those who want the will, Pant for the dreadful privilege to kill: Yet what delight can rank and power bestow, Since every joy is balanced by its woe! —Still wouldst thou choose the favourite's purple, say? Or, thus forewarn'd, some paltry hamlet sway? At Gabii, or Fidenæ, rules propound, For faulty measures, and for wares unsound; And take the tarnish'd robe, and petty state, Of poor Ulubræ's ragged magistrate?— You grant me then, Sejanus grossly err'd, Nor knew what prayer his folly had preferr'd: For when he begg'd for too much wealth and power, Stage above stage, he raised a tottering tower, And higher still, and higher; to be thrown, With louder crash, and wider ruin down! What wrought the Crassi, what the Pompeys' doom, And His, who bow'd the stubborn neck of Rome? What but the wild, the unbounded wish to rise, Heard, in malignant kindness, by the skies! Few kings, few tyrants, find a bloodless end, Or to the grave, without a wound, descend. The child, with whom a trusty slave is sent, Charged with his little scrip, has scarcely spent His mite at school, ere all his bosom glows With the fond hope he never more foregoes, To reach Demosthenes' or Tully's name, Rival of both in eloquence and fame!— Yet by this eloquence, alas! expired Each orator, so envied, so admired! Yet by the rapid and resistless sway Of torrent genius, each was swept away! Genius, for that, the baneful potion sped, And lopt, from this, the hands and gory head: While meaner pleaders unmolested stood, Nor stain'd the rostrum with their wretched blood. “How fortunate a natal day was thine, “In that late consulate, O Rome, of mine!” Oh, soul of eloquence! had all been found, An empty vaunt, like this, a jingling sound, Thou mightst, in peace, thy humble fame have borne, And laugh'd the swords of Antony to scorn! Yet this would I prefer, the common jest, To that which fired the fierce triumvir's breast, That second scroll, where eloquence divine, Burst on the ear, from every glowing line. And he too fell, whom Athens, wondering, saw Her fierce democracy, at will, o'erawe, And “fulmine over Greece!” some angry Power Scowl'd, with dire influence, on his natal hour.— Blear'd with the glowing mass, the ambitious sire, From anvils, sledges, bellows, tongs, and fire, From tempering swords, his own more safe employ, To study rhetorick, sent his hopeful boy. The spoils of war; the trunk in triumph placed, With all the trophies of the battle graced, Crush'd helms, and batter'd shields; and streamers borne From vanquish'd fleets, and beams from chariots torn; And arcs of triumph, where the captive foe Bends, in mute anguish, o'er the pomp below, Are blessings, which the slaves of glory rate, Beyond a mortal's hope, a mortal's fate! Fired with the love of these, what countless swarms, Barbarians, Romans, Greeks, have rush'd to arms, All danger slighted, and all toil defied, And madly conquer'd, or as madly died! So much the raging thirst of fame exceeds The generous warmth, which prompts to worthy deeds, That none confess fair Virtue's genuine power, Or woo her to their breast, without a dower. Yet has this wild desire, in other days, This boundless avarice of a few for praise, This frantick rage for names to grace a tomb, Involv'd whole countries in one general doom: Vain “rage!” the roots of the wild fig-tree rise, Strike through the marble, and their memory dies! For, like their mouldering tenants, tombs decay, And, with the dust they hide, are swept away. Produce the urn that Hannibal contains, And weigh the mighty dust which yet remains: And is this all! Yet this was once the bold, The aspiring chief, whom Africk could not hold, Though stretch'd, in breadth, from where the Atlantick roars, To distant Nilus, and his sun-burnt shores; In length, from Carthage to the burning zone, Where other moors, and elephants are known. —Spain conquer'd, o'er the Pyrenees he bounds: Nature opposed her everlasting mounds, Her Alps, and snows; o'er these, with torrent force, He pours, and rends through rocks his dreadful course. Already at his feet Italia lies;— Yet thundering on, “Think nothing done,” he cries, “Till Rome, proud Rome, beneath my fury falls, “And Africk's standards float along her walls!” Big words!—but view his figure! view his face! O, for some master-hand the lines to trace, As through the Etrurian swamps, by floods increast, The one-eyed chief urged his Getulian beast! But what ensued? Illusive Glory, say. Subdued on Zama's memorable day, He flies in exile to a petty state, With headlong haste; and, at a despot's gate, Sits, mighty suppliant! of his life in doubt, Till the Bithynian's morning nap be out. Nor swords, nor spears, nor stones from engines hurl'd, Shall quell the man whose frown alarm'd the world: The vengeance due to Cannæ's fatal field, And floods of human gore, a ring shall yield!— Fly, madman, fly! at toil and danger mock, Pierce the deep snow, and scale the eternal rock, To please the rhetoricians, and become A declamation—for the boys of Rome! One world, the ambitious youth of Pella found Too small; and toss'd his feverish limbs around, And gasp'd for breath, as if immured the while, In Gyaræ, or Serîpho's rocky isle: But entering Babylon, found ample room, Within the narrow limits of a tomb! Death, the great teacher, Death alone proclaims, The true dimensions of our puny frames. The daring tales, in Grecian story found, Were once believed:—of Athos sail'd around, Of fleets, that bridges o'er the waves supplied, Of chariots, rolling on the stedfast tide, Of lakes exhausted, and of rivers quaft, By countless nations, at a morning's draught, And all that Sostratus so wildly sings, Besotted poet, of the king of kings. But how return'd he, say? this soul of fire, This proud barbarian, whose impatient ire Chastised the winds, that disobey'd his nod, With stripes, ne'er suffer'd from the Æolian god; Fetter'd the Shaker of the sea and land— But, in pure clemency, forbore to brand! And sure, if aught can touch the Powers above, This calls for all their service, all their love!— But how return'd he? say;—His navy lost, In a small bark he fled the hostile coast, And, urged by terrour, drove his labouring prore, Through floating carcases, and floods of gore. So Xerxes sped, so speed the conquering race; They catch at glory, and they clasp disgrace! “Life! length of life!” For this, with earnest cries, Or sick or well, we supplicate the skies. Pernicious prayer! for mark what ills attend, Still, on the old, as to the grave they bend: A ghastly visage, to themselves unknown, For a smooth skin, a hide with scurf o'ergrown, And such a cheek, as many a grandam ape, In Tabraca's thick woods, is seen to scrape. Strength, beauty, and a thousand charms beside, With sweet distinction, youth from youth divide; While age presents one universal face: A faultering voice, a weak and trembling pace, An ever-dropping nose, a forehead bare, And toothless gums to mumble o'er its fare. Poor wretch! behold him, tottering to his fall, So loathsome to himself, wife, children, all, That those who hoped the legacy to share, And flatter'd long,—disgusted, disappear. The sluggish palate dull'd, the feast no more Excites the same sensations as of yore; Taste, feeling, all, a universal blot, And e'en the rites of love remember'd not: Or if,—through the long night he feebly strives, To raise a flame where not a spark survives; While Venus marks the effort with distrust, And hates the gray decrepitude of lust. Another loss!—no joy can song inspire, Though famed Seleucus lead the warbling quire: The sweetest airs escape him; and the lute, Which thrills the general ear, to him is mute.— He sits, perhaps, too distant: bring him near; Alas! 'tis still the same: he scarce can hear The deep-toned horn, the trumpet's clanging sound, And the loud blast which shakes the benches round. Even at his ear, his slave must bawl the hour, And shout the comer's name, with all his power! Add that a fever only, warms his veins, And thaws the little blood which yet remains; That ills of every kind, and every name, Rush in, and seize the unresisting frame. Ask you how many? I could sooner say, How many drudges Hippia kept in pay, How many orphans Basilus beguiled, How many pupils Hæmolus defiled, How many men long Maura overmatch'd, How many patients Themison dispatch'd, In one short autumn; nay, perhaps, record, How many villas call my quondam barber lord! These their shrunk shoulders, those their hams bemoan, This hath no eyes, and envies that with one: This takes, as helpless at the board he stands, His food, with bloodless lips, from others' hands; While that, whose eager jaws, instinctive, spread At every feast, gapes feebly to be fed, Like Progne's brood, when, laden with supplies, From bill to bill, the fasting mother flies. But other ills, and worse, succeed to those: His limbs long since were gone; his memory goes. Poor driveller! he forgets his servants quite, Forgets, at morn, with whom he supp'd at night; Forgets the children he begot and bred; And makes a strumpet heiress in their stead.— So much avails it the rank arts to use, Gain'd, by long practice, in the loathsome stews! But grant his senses unimpair'd remain; Still woes on woes succeed, a mournful train! He sees his sons, his daughters, all expire, His faithful consort on the funeral pyre, Sees brothers, sisters, friends, to ashes turn, And all he loved, or loved him, in their urn. Lo here, the dreadful fine we ever pay, For life protracted to a distant day! To see our house by sickness, pain pursued, And scenes of death incessantly renew'd: In sable weeds to waste the joyless years, And drop, at last, mid solitude and tears! The Pylian's (if we credit Homer's page) Was only second to the raven's age. “O happy, sure, beyond the common rate, “Who warded off, so long, the stroke of fate! “Who told his years by centuries, who so oft “Quaff'd the new must! O happy, sure”—But, soft. This “happy” man of destiny complain'd, Curs'd his gray hairs, and every god arraign'd; What time he lit the pyre, with streaming eyes, And, in dark volumes, saw the flames arise Round his Antilochus:—“Tell me,” he cried, To every friend who linger'd at his side, “Tell me what crimes have roused the Immortals' hate, “That thus, in vengeance, they protract my date?” So question'd heaven Laertes—Peleus so— (Their hoary heads bow'd to the grave with woe) While This bewail'd his son, at Ilium slain; That his, long wandering o'er the faithless main. While Troy yet flourish'd, had her Priam died, With what solemnity, what funeral pride, Had he descended, every duty paid, To old Assaracus, illustrious shade!— Hector himself, bedew'd with many a tear, Had join'd his brothers to support the bier; And Troy's dejected dames, a numerous train, Follow'd, in sable pomp, and wept amain, As sad Polyxena her pall had rent, And wild Cassandra raised the loud lament: Had he but fall'n, ere his adulterous boy Spread his bold sails, and left the shores of Troy. But what did lengthen'd life avail the sire? To see his realm laid waste by sword and fire. Then too, too late, the feeble soldier tried Unequal arms, and flung his crown aside; Totter'd, his children's murderer to repel, With trembling haste, and at Jove's altar fell, Fell without effort; like the steer, that, now, Time-worn and weak, and, by the ungrateful plough, Spurn'd forth to slaughter, to the master's knife, Yields his shrunk veins, and miserable life. His end, howe'er, was human; while his mate, Doom'd, in a brute, to drain the dregs of fate, Pursued the foes of Troy from shore to shore, And bark'd, and howl'd at those she curs'd before. I pass, while hastening to the Roman page, The Pontick king, and Crœsus, whom the Sage Wisely forbad in fortune to confide, Or take the name of happy, till he died. That Marius, exiled from his native plains, Was hid in fens, discover'd, bound in chains; That, bursting these, to Africa he fled, And, through the realms he conquer'd, begg'd his bread, Arose from age, from treacherous age alone: For what had Rome, or earth, so happy known, Had he, in that blest moment, ceased to live, When, graced with all that Victory could give, “Pride, pomp, and circumstance of glorious war,” He first alighted from his Cimbrian car! Campania, prescient of her Pompey's fate, Sent a kind fever to arrest his date: When lo! a thousand suppliant altars rise, And publick prayers obtain him of the skies. Ill done! that head, thus rescued from the grave His Evil Fate and ours, by Nilus' wave, Lopt from the trunk:—such mutilation dire, Cornelius 'scaped; Cethegus fell entire; And Catiline press'd, whole, the funeral pyre. Whene'er the fane of Venus meets her eye, The anxious mother breathes a secret sigh, For handsome boys; but asks, with bolder prayer, That all her girls be exquisitely fair! “And wherefore, not? Latona, in the sight “Of Dian's beauty, took unblamed delight.” True; but Lucretia curs'd her fatal charms, When spent with struggling in a Tarquin's arms; And poor Virginia would have changed her grace, For Rutila's crook'd back, and homely face. “But boys may still be fair?” No; they destroy Their parents' peace, and murder all their joy; For rarely do we meet, in one combined, A beauteous body and a virtuous mind, Though, through the rugged line, there still has run, A Sabine sanctity, from sire to son.— Besides, should nature, in her kindest mood, Confer the ingenuous flush of modest blood, The disposition chaste as unsunn'd snow— (And what can nature more than these bestow, These, which no art, no care can give?)—even then, They cannot hope, they must not, to be men! Smit with their charms, the imps of hell appear, And pour their proffers in a parent's ear, For prostitution!—infamously bold, And trusting to the almighty power of gold: While youths in shape and air less form'd to please, No tyrants mutilate, no Neros seize. Go now, and triumph in your beauteous boy, Your Ganymede! whom other ills annoy, And other dangers wait: his graces known, He stands profess'd, the favourite of the town; And dreads, incessant dreads, on every hand, The vengeance which a husand's wrongs demand: For sure detection follows soon or late; Born under Mars, he cannot scape his fate. Oft on the adulterer too, the furious spouse Inflicts worse evils than the law allows; By blows, stripes, gashes some are robb'd of breath, And others, by the mullet, rack'd to death. “But my Endymion will more lucky prove, “And serve a beauteous mistress, all for love.” No; he will soon to ugliness be sold, And serve a toothless grandam, all for gold. Servilia will not lose him; jewels, clothes, All, all she sells, and all on him bestows; For women nought to the dear youth deny, Or think his labours can be bought too high: When love's the word, the naked sex appear, And every niggard is a spendthrift here. “But if my boy with virtue be endued, “What harm will beauty do him?” Nay, what good? Say, what avail'd, of old, to Theseus son, The stern resolve? what, to Bellerophon?— O, then did Phædra redden, then her pride Took fire, to be so stedfastly denied! Then, too, did Sthenobœa glow with shame, And both burst forth with unextinguish'd flame! A woman scorn'd is pitiless as fate, For, there, the dread of shame adds stings to hate. But Silius comes.—Now, be thy judgment tried: Shall he accept, or not, the proffer'd bride, And marry Cæsar's wife? hard point, in truth: Lo! this most noble, this most beauteous youth, Is hurried off, a helpless sacrifice To the lewd glance of Messalina's eyes! —Haste, bring the victim: in the nuptial vest, Already see the impatient Empress drest; The genial couch prepared, the accustomed sum Told out, the augurs and the notaries come. “But why all these?” You think, perhaps, the rite Were better, known to few, and kept from sight: Not so the lady; she abhors a flaw, And wisely calls for every form of law. But what shall Silius do? refuse to wed? A moment sees him number'd with the dead. Consent, and gratify the eager dame? He gains a respite, till the tale of shame, Thro' town and country, reach the Emperour's ear, Still sure the last—his own disgrace to hear. Then let him, if a day's precarious life Be worth his study, make the fair his wife; For wed or not, poor youth, 'tis still the same, And still the axe must mangle that fine frame! Say then, shall man, deprived all power of choice Ne'er raise to Heaven the supplicating voice? Not so; but to the gods his fortunes trust: Their thoughts are wise, their dispensations just. What best may profit or delight they know, And real good for fancied bliss bestow: With eyes of pity they our frailties scan; More dear to them, than to himself, is man. By blind desire, by headlong passion driven, For wife and heirs we daily weary Heaven; Yet still 'tis Heaven's prerogative to know, If heirs, or wife, will bring us weal or wo. But, (for 'tis good our humble hope to prove,) That thou mayst, still, ask something, from above; Thy pious offerings to the temple bear, And, while the altars blaze, be this thy prayer. O thou, who know'st the wants of human kind, Vouchsafe me health of body, health of mind; A soul prepared to meet the frowns of fate, And look undaunted on a future state; That reckons death a blessing, yet can bear Existence nobly, with its weight of care; That anger and desire alike restrains, And counts Alcides' toils, and cruel pains, Superiour far to banquets, wanton nights, And all the Assyrian monarch's soft delights! Here bound, at length, thy wishes. I but teach, What blessings man, by his own powers, may reach. The path to peace is virtue. We should see, If wise, O Fortune, nought divine in thee: But we have deified a name alone, And fix'd in heaven thy visionary throne! SATIRE XI. TO PERSICUS. If Atticus in sumptuous fare delight, 'Tis taste: if Rutilus, 'tis madness quite: And what diverts the sneering rabble more Than an Apicius miserably poor? In every company, go where you will, Bath, forum, theatre, the talk is still Of Rutilus!—While fit (they cry) to wield, With firm and vigorous arm, the spear, and shield, While his full veins beat high with youthful blood, Forced by no tribune—yet by none withstood, He cultivates the gladiator's trade, And learns the imperious language of the blade. What swarms we see of this degenerate kind! Swarms whom their creditors can only find, At flesh and fish-stalls:—thither they repair, Sure, though deceived at home, to catch them there. These live but for their palate; and, of these, The most distress'd, (while Ruin hastes to seize The crumbling mansion and disparting wall,) Spread richer feasts, and riot as they fall!— Meanwhile, ere yet the last supply be spent, They search for dainties every element, Awed by no price; nay, making this their boast, And still preferring that which costs them most, Joyous, and reckless of to-morrow's fate, To raise a desperate sum, they pledge their plate, Or mother's fractured image; to prepare Yet one treat more, though but in earthen ware! Then to the fencer's mess they come, of course, And mount the scaffold as a last resource. No foe to sumptuous boards, I only scan, When such are spread, the motives, and the man, And praise or censure as I see the feast, Or by the noble, or the beggar, drest: In this, 'tis gluttony; in that, fit pride, Sanctioned by wealth, by station dignified.— Whip me the fool, who marks how Atlas soars O'er every hill on Mauritania's shores, Yet sees no difference 'twixt the coffer's hoards, And the poor pittance a small purse affords! Heaven sent us, “know thyself!”—Be this imprest, In living characters, upon thy breast, And still revolv'd; whether a wife thou choose, Or to the sacred senate point thy views.— Or seek'st thou rather, in some doubtful cause, To vindicate thy country's injured laws? Knock at thy bosom, play the censor's part, And note with caution, what and who thou art, An orator of force and skill profound, Or a mere Matho, emptiness and sound! Yes, know thyself: in great concerns, in small, Be this thy care, for this, my friend, is all: Nor, when thy purse will scarce a gudgeon buy, With fond intemperance, for turbots sigh! O think what end awaits thee, timely think, If thy throat widens as thy pockets shrink, Thy throat, of all thy father's thrift could save, Flocks, herds, and fields, the insatiable grave!— At length, when nought remains a meal to bring, The last poor shift, off comes the knightly ring, And “sad Sir Pollio” begs his daily fare, With undistinguish'd hands, and finger bare! To these, an early grave no terrour brings. “A short and merry life!” the spendthrift sings; Death seems to him a refuge from despair, And far less terrible than hoary hair. Mark now the progress of their rapid fate! Money, (regardless of the monthly rate,) On every side, they borrow, and apace, Waste what is raised before the lender's face: Then, while they yet some wretched remnant hold, And the pale usurer trembles for his gold, They wisely sicken for the country air, And flock to Baiæ, Ostia, Jove knows where.— For now 'tis held (so rife the evil's grown) No greater shame, for debt, to flee the town, Than from the throng'd Suburra to remove, In dogdays, to the Esquilian shades above. One thought alone, what time they leave behind, Friends, country, all, weighs heavy on their mind, One thought alone,—for twelve long months to lose, The dear delights of Rome, the publick shows! Where sleeps the modest blood! In all our veins, No conscious drop, to form a blush, remains: Shame, from the town, derided, speeds her way, And few, alas! solicit her to stay. Enough: to-day my Persicus shall see, Whether my precepts with my life agree; Whether, with feign'd austerity, I prize The spare repast, a glutton in disguise! Bawl for coarse pottage, that my friends may hear, But whisper “sweetmeats!” in my servant's ear. For since, by promise, you are now my guest, Know, I invite you to no sumptuous feast, But to such simple fare, as, long, long since, The good Evander bade the Trojan prince. Come then, my friend, you will not, sure, despise The food that pleased the offspring of the skies; Come, and while fancy brings past times to view, I'll think myself the king, the hero you. Take now your bill of fare: my simple board, Is with no dainties from the market stored, But dishes, all my own. From Tibur's stock, A kid shall come, the fattest of the flock, The tenderest too, and yet too young to browse The thistle's shoots, the willow's watery boughs, With more of milk than blood; and pullets drest With new-laid eggs, yet tepid from the nest, And sperage wild, which, from the mountain's side, My housemaid left her spindle, to provide; And grapes long kept, yet pulpy still, and fair, And the rich Signian and the Syrian pear; And apples, that in flavour and in smell, The boasted Picene equal, or excel:— Nor need you fear, my friend, their liberal use, For age has mellow'd and improved their juice. How homely this! and yet this homely fare, A senator would, once, have counted rare; When the good Curius thought it no disgrace, O'er a few sticks a little pot to place, With herbs by his small garden-plot supplied— Food, which the squalid wretch would now deride, Who digs in fetters, and, with fond regret, The tavern's savoury dish remembers yet! Time was, when, on the rack, a man would lay The season'd flitch, against a solemn day; And think the friends who met, with decent mirth, To celebrate the hour which gave him birth, On this, and what of fresh the altars spared, (For altars then were honour'd,) nobly fared. Some kinsman, who had camps and senates sway'd, Had thrice been consul, once dictator made, From publick cares retired, would gaily haste, Before the wonted hour, to such repast, Shouldering the spade, that, with no common toil, Had tamed the genius of the mountain soil.— Yes, when the world was fill'd with Rome's just fame, And Romans trembled at the Fabian name, The Scauran, and Fabrician; when they saw, A censor's rigour ev'n a censor awe, No son of Troy, e'er thought it his concern, Or worth a moment's serious care, to learn, What land, what sea, the fairest tortoise bred, Whose clouded shell might best adorn his bed.— His bed was small, and did no signs impart, Or of the painter's or the sculptor's art, Save where the front, cheaply inlaid with brass, Show'd the rude features of a vine-crown'd ass; An uncouth brute, round which his children play'd, And laugh'd and jested at the face it made! Briefly, his house, his furniture, his food, Were uniformly plain, and simply good. Then the rough soldier, yet untaught by Greece To hang, enraptured, o'er a finish'd piece, If haply, mid the congregated spoils, (Proofs of his power, and guerdon of his toils,) Some antique vase of master-hands were found, Would dash the glittering bauble on the ground; That, in new forms, the molten fragments drest, Might blaze illustrious round his courser's chest, Or, flashing from his burnish'd helmet, show, (A dreadful omen to the trembling foe,) The mighty sire, with glittering shield and spear, Hovering, enamour'd, o'er the sleeping fair, The wolf, by Rome's high destinies made mild, And, playful at her side, each wondrous child. Thus, all the wealth those simple times could boast, Small wealth! their horses and their arms engrost; The rest was homely, and their frugal fare, Cook'd without art, was serv'd in earthen ware: Yet worthy all our envy, were the breast, But with one spark of noble spleen, possest. Then shone the fanes with Majesty Divine, A present God was felt at every shrine! And solemn sounds, heard from the sacred walls, At midnight's solemn hour, announced the Gauls, Now rushing from the main; while, prompt to save, Stood Jove, the prophet of the signs he gave! Yet, when he thus reveal'd the will of fate, And watch'd attentive o'er the Latian state, His shrine, his statue, rose of humble mold, Of artless form, and unprofaned with gold. Those good old times no foreign tables sought; From their own woods, the walnut tree was brought, When withering limbs declared its pith unsound, Or winds uptore, and stretch'd it on the ground. But now, such strange caprice has seized the great, They find no pleasure in the costliest treat, Suspect the flowers a sickly scent exhale, And think the ven'son rank, the turbot stale, Unless wide-yawning panthers, towering high— Enormous pedestals of ivory, Form'd of the teeth which Elephantis sends, Which the dark Moor, or darker Indian vends, Or those which, now, too heavy for the head, The beasts in Nabathea's forest shed— The spacious orbs support: then they can feed, And every dish, is delicate indeed! For silver feet are view'd with equal scorn, As iron rings, upon the finger worn. To me, for ever be the guest unknown, Who, measuring my expenses by his own, Remarks the difference with a scornful leer, And slights my humble house, and homely cheer. Look not to me for ivory; I have none: My chess-board and my men are all of bone; Nay, my knife-handles; yet, my friend, for this, My pullets neither cut nor taste amiss. I boast no artist, tutor'd in the school Of learned Trypherus, to carve by rule; Where large sow-paps of elm, and boar, and hare, And phœnicopter, and pygargus rare, Getulian oryx, Scythian pheasants, point, The nice anatomy of every joint; And dull blunt tools, severing the wooden treat, Clatter around, and deafen all the street. My simple lad, whose highest efforts rise, To broil a steak, in the plain country guise, Knows no such art; humbly content to serve, And bring the dishes which he cannot kerve. Another lad (for I have two to day) Clad, like the first, in home-spun russet gray, Shall fill our earthen bowls: no Phrygian he, No pamper'd attribute of luxury, But a rude rustick:—when you want him, speak, And speak in Latin, for he knows not Greek. Both go alike, with close, cropt hair, undrest, But spruced to day in honour of my guest; And both were born on my estate, and one, Is my rough shepherd's, one, my neatherd's son. Poor youth! he mourns, with many an artless tear, His long, long absence from his mother dear; Sighs for his little cottage, and would fain Meet his old playfellows, the goats, again. Though humble be his birth, ingenuous grace Beams from his eye, and flushes in his face; Charming suffusion! that would well become, The youthful offspring of the chiefs of Rome.— He, Persicus, shall fill us wine which grew Where first, the breath of life, the stripling drew, On Tibur's hills;—dear hills, that, many a day, Witness'd the transports of his infant play. But you, perhaps, expect a wanton throng Of Gaditanian girls, with dance and song, To kindle loose desire; girls, that now bound Aloft, with active grace, now, on the ground, Quivering, alight, while peals of praise go round. Lo! wives, beside their husbands placed, behold, What could not in their ear, for shame, be told; Expedients of the rich, the blood to fire, And wake the dying embers of desire. Behold? O, heavens! they view, with keenest gust, These strong provocatives of jaded lust; With every gesture feel their passions rise, And draw in pleasure both at ears and eyes! Such vicious fancies are too great for me. Let him the wanton dance, unblushing, see, And hear the immodest terms which, in the stews, The veriest strumpet would disdain to use, Whose drunken spawlings roll, tumultuous, o'er The proud expansion of a marble floor: For there the world a large allowance make, And spare the folly for the fortune's sake.— Dice, and adultery, with a small estate, Are damning crimes; but venial, with a great; Venial? nay, graceful: witty, gallant, brave, And such wild tricks “as gentlemen should have!” My feast, to-day, shall other joys afford: Hush'd as we sit around the frugal board, Great Homer shall his deep-toned thunder roll, And mighty Maro elevate the soul; Maro, who, warm'd with all the poet's fire, Disputes the palm of victory with his sire: Nor fear my rustick clerks; read as they will, The bard, the bard, shall rise superiour, still! Come then, my friend, an hour to pleasure spare, And quit awhile your business and your care; The day is all our own: come, and forget Bonds, interest, all; the credit and the debt; Nay, e'en your wife: though, with the dawning light, She left your couch, and late return'd at night; Though her loose hair in wild disorder flow'd, Her eye yet glisten'd, and her cheek yet glow'd, Her rumpled girdle busy hands exprest— Yet, at my threshold, tranquillize your breast; There leave the thoughts of home, and what the haste Of heedless slaves may, in your absence, waste; And, what the generous spirit most offends, O, more than all, leave there, ungrateful Friends. But see! the napkin, waved aloft, proclaims The glad commencement of the Idæan games, And the proud prætor, in triumphal state, Ascends his car, the arbiter of fate! Ere this, all Rome (if 'tis, for once, allow'd, To say all Rome, of so immense a crowd) The Circus throngs, and—Hark! loud shouts arise— From these, I guess the Green has won the prize; For had it lost, all joy had been supprest, And grief and horrour seized the publick breast; As when dire Carthage forced our arms to yield, And pour'd our noblest blood on Cannæ's field. Thither let youth, whom it befits, repair, And seat themselves beside some favourite fair, Wrangle, and urge the desperate bet aloud; While we, retired from business and the crowd, Stretch our shrunk limbs, by sunny bank or stream, And drink, at every pore, the vernal beam. Haste, then: for we may use our freedom now, And bathe, an hour ere noon, with fearless brow— Indulge for once:—Yet such delights as these, In five short morns, would lose the power to please; For still, the sweetest pleasures soonest cloy, And its best flavour temperance gives to joy. SATIRE XII. TO CORVINUS. Not with such joy, Corvinus, I survey My natal hour, as this auspicious day; This day, on which the festive turf demands The promised victims, at my willing hands. A snow-white lamb to Juno I decree, Another to Minerva; and to thee, Tarpeian Jove! a steer, which, from afar, Shakes his long rope, and meditates the war. 'Tis a fierce animal, that proudly scorns The dug, since first he tried his budding horns Against an oak; free mettled, and, in fine, Fit for the knife, and sacrificial wine. O, were my power but equal to my love, A nobler victim should my rapture prove! A bull high fed, and boasting in his veins, The luscious juices of Clitumnus' plains, Fatter than fat Hispulla, huge and slow, Should fall, but fall beneath no common blow— Fall for my friend, who now, from danger free, Revolves the recent perils of the sea; Shrinks at the roaring waves, the howling winds, And scarcely trusts the safety which he finds! For not the gods' inevitable fire, The surging billows that to heaven aspire, Alone, perdition threat; black clouds arise, And blot out all the splendour of the skies; Loud and more loud the thunder's voice is heard, And sulphurous fires flash dreadful on the yard.— Trembled the crew, and, fix'd in wild amaze, Saw the rent sails burst into sudden blaze; While shipwreck, late so dreadful, now appear'd A refuge from the flames, more wish'd than fear'd. Horrour on horrour! earth, and sea, and skies, Convuls'd, as when poetick tempests rise! From the same source, another danger view, With pitying eye,—though dire alas! not new; But known too well, as Isis' temples show, By many a pictured scene of votive wo; Isis, by whom the painters now are fed, Since our own gods no longer yield them bread!— And such befel our friend: for now a sea, Upsurging, pour'd tremendous o'er the lee, And fill'd the hold; while, press'd by wave and wind, To right and left, by turns, the ship inclined: Then, while Catullus view'd, with drooping heart, The storm prevailing o'er the pilot's art, He wisely hasten'd to compound the strife, And gave his treasure to preserve his life. The beaver thus to scape his hunter tries, And leaves behind the medicated prize; Happy to purchase, with his dearest blood, A timely refuge in the well known flood. “Away with all that's mine,” he cries, “away!” And plunges in the deep, without delay, Purples, which soft Mæcenases might wear, Crimsons, deep-tinctured in the Bætick air, Where herbs, and springs of secret virtues, stain The flocks at feed, with Nature's richest grain. With these, neat baskets from the Britons bought, Rare silver chargers by Parthenius wrought, A huge two-handed goblet, which might strain A Pholus, or a Fuscus' wife, to drain; Follow'd by numerous services of plate, Plain, and enchased; with cups of ancient date, In which, while at the city's strength he laugh'd, The wily chapman of Olynthus quaff'd. Yet show me, in this elemental strife, Another, who would barter wealth for life!— Few gain to live, Corvinus, few or none, But, blind with avarice, live to gain alone. Now had the deep devour'd their richest store; Nor seems their safety nearer than before: The last resource alone was unexplored— To cut the mast and rigging by the board; Haply the vessel so might steadier ride, O'er the vex'd surface of the raging tide. Dire threats th' impending blow, when, thus distrest, We sacrifice a part, to save the rest! Go now, fond man, the faithless ocean brave, Commit your fortunes to the wind and wave; Trust to a plank, and draw precarious breath, At most, seven inches from the jaws of death! Go; but forget not that a storm may rise, And put up hatchets with your sea supplies. But now the winds were hush'd; the wearied main Sunk to repose, a calm unruffled plain; For fate, superiour to the tempest's power, Averted, from my friend, the mortal hour: A whiter thread the cheerful Sisters spun, And lo, with favouring hands their spindles run! Mild as the breeze of eve, a rising gale Rippled the wave, and fill'd their only sail; Others the crew supplied, of vests combined, And spread to catch each vagrant breath of wind: By aids like these, slow o'er the deep impell'd, The shatter'd bark her course for Ostia held; While the glad sun uprose, supremely bright, And hope return'd with the returning light. At length the heights, where, from Lavinum moved, Iülus built the city which he loved, Burst on the view; auspicious heights! whose name, From a white sow and thirty sucklings came. And now, the port they gain; the tower, whose ray Guides the poor wanderer o'er the watery way, And the huge mole, whose arms the waves embrace, And stretching, an immeasurable space, Far into Ocean's bosom, leave the coast, Till, in the distance, Italy is lost!— Less wonderful the bays which Nature forms, And less secure against assailing storms: Here rides the wave-worn bark, devoid of fear; For Baian skiffs might ply with safety here. The joyful crew, with shaven crowns, relate Their timely rescue from the jaws of fate; On every ill a pomp of words bestow, And dwell delighted on the tale of wo. Go then, my boys—but let no boding strain Break on the sacred silence,—dress the fane With garlands, bind the sod with ribands gay, And on the knives the salted offering lay: This done, I'll speed, myself, the rites to share, And finish what remains, with pious care. Then, hastening home, where chaplets of sweet flowers Bedeck my Lares, dear, domestick Powers! I'll offer incense there, and at the shrine Of highest Jove, my father's god, and mine; There will I scatter every bud that blows, And every tint the various violet knows. All savours here of joy: luxuriant bay O'ershades my portal, while the taper's ray Anticipates the feast, and chides the tardy day. Nor think, Corvinus, interest fires my breast: Catullus, for whose sake my house is drest, Has three sweet boys, who all such hopes destroy, And nobler views excite my boundless joy. Yet who besides, on such a barren friend, Would waste a sickly pullet? who would spend So vast a treasure, where no hopes prevail, Or, for a father, sacrifice a quail?— But should the symptoms of a slight disease The childless Paccius or Gallita seize, Legions of flatterers to the fanes repair, And hang, in rows, their votive tablets there. Nay, some with vows of hecatombs will come— For yet no elephants are sold at Rome; The breed, to Latium and to us unknown, Is only found beneath the burning zone: Thence to our shores, by swarthy Moors convey'd, They roam at large through the Rutulian shade, Kept for the imperial pleasure, envied fate! And sacred from the subject, and the state. Though their progenitors, in days of yore, Did worthy service, and to battle bore Whole cohorts; taught the general's voice to know, And rush, themselves an army, on the foe. But what avails their worth! could gold obtain So rare a creature, worth might plead in vain: Novius, without delay, their blood would shed, To raise his Paccius from affliction's bed; An offering, sacred to the great design, And worthy of the votary, and the shrine! Pacuvius, did our laws the crime allow, The fairest of his numerous slaves would vow; The blooming boy, the love-inspiring maid, With garlands crown, and to the temple lead; Nay, seize his Iphigene, prepared to wed, And drag her to the altar, from the bed; Though hopeless, like the Grecian sire, to find, In happy hour, the substituted hind. And who shall say my countryman does ill? A thousand ships are trifles to a Will! For Paccius, should the fates his health restore, May cancel every item framed before, (Won by his friend's vast merits, and beset, On all sides, by the inextricable net,) And, in one line, convey plate, jewels, gold, Lands, every thing to him, “to have and hold.” With victory crown'd, Pacuvius struts along, And smiles contemptuous on the baffled throng; Then counts his gains, and deems himself o'erpaid, For the cheap murder of one wretched maid. Health to the man! and may he thus get more, Than Nero plunder'd! pile his shining store, High, mountain high; in years a Nestor prove, And, loving none, ne'er know another's love! SATIRE XIII. TO CALVINUS. Man, wretched man, whene'er he stoops to sin, Feels, with the act, a strong remorse within; 'Tis the first vengeance: Conscience tries the cause, And vindicates the violated laws; Though the bribed Prætor at their sentence spurn, And falsify the verdict of the Urn. What says the world, not always, friend, unjust, Of this late injury, this breach of trust? That thy estate so small a loss can bear, And that the evil, now no longer rare, Is one of that inevitable set, Which man is born to suffer, and forget. Then moderate thy grief; 'tis mean to show, An anguish disproportion'd to the blow. But thou, so new to crosses, as to feel The slightest portion of the slightest ill, Art fired with rage, because a friend forswears The sacred pledge, intrusted to his cares. What, thou, Calvinus, bear so weak a mind! Thou, who hast left full three-score years behind! Heavens, have they taught thee nothing! nothing, friend! And art thou grown gray-headed to no end!— Wisdom, I know, contains a sovereign charm, To vanquish fortune, or at least disarm: Blest they who walk by her unerring rule!— Nor those unblest, who, tutor'd in life's school, Have learn'd of old experience to submit, And lightly bear the yoke they cannot quit. What day so sacred, which no guilt profanes, No secret fraud, no open rapine stains? What hour, in which no dark assassins prowl, Nor point the sword for hire, nor drug the bowl? The good, alas, are few! “The valued file,” Less than the Gates of Thebes, the Mouths of Nile! For now an age is come, that teems with crimes, Beyond all precedent of former times; An age so bad, that Nature cannot frame, A metal base enough to give it name! Yet you, indignant at a paltry cheat, Call heaven and earth to witness the deceit, With cries as deafening, as the shout that breaks From the bribed audience, when Fæsidius speaks. Dotard in nonage! are you to be told, What loves, what graces, deck another's gold? Are you to learn, what peals of mirth resound, At your simplicity, from all around? When you step forth, and, with a serious air, Bid them abstain from perjury, and beware To tempt the altars,—for a God is there! Idle old man! there was, indeed, a time, When the rude natives of this happy clime Cherish'd such dreams: 'twas ere the king of heaven, To change his sceptre for a scythe was driven; Ere Juno yet the sweets of love had tried, Or Jove advanced beyond the caves of Ide. 'Twas when no gods indulged in sumptuous feasts, No Ganymede, no Hebe serv'd the guests; No Vulcan, with his sooty labours foul, Limp'd round, officious, with the nectar'd bowl; But each in private dined: 'twas when the throng Of godlings, now beyond the scope of song, The courts of heaven, in spacious ease, possest, And with a lighter load, poor Atlas prest!— Ere Neptune's lot the watery world obtain'd, Or Dis and his Sicilian consort reign'd; Ere Tityus and his ravening bird were known, Ixion's wheel, or Sisyphus's stone: While yet the shades confess'd no tyrant's power, And all below was one Elysian bower! Vice was a phœnix in that blissful time, Believed, but never seen: and 'twas a crime, Worthy of death, such awe did years engage, If manhood rose not up to reverend age, And youth to manhood, though a larger hoard Of hips and acorns, graced the stripling's board. Then, then, was age so venerable thought, That every day increase of honour brought; And children, in the springing down, revered The sacred promise of a hoary beard! Now, if a friend, miraculously just, Restore the pledge, with all its gather'd rust, 'Tis deem'd a portent, worthy to appear, Among the wonders of the Tuscan year; A prodigy of faith, which threats the state, And a ewe lamb can scarcely expiate!— Struck at the view, if now I chance to see, A man of ancient worth and probity, To pregnant mules the monster I compare, Or fish upturn'd beneath the wondering share: Anxious and trembling for the woe to come, As if a shower of stones had fall'n on Rome; As if a swarm of bees, together clung, Down from the Capitol, thick-clustering, hung; Or Tiber, swoll'n to madness, burst away, And roll'd, a milky deluge, to the sea. And dost thou at a trivial loss repine! What, if another, by a friend like thine, Is stript of ten times more! a third, again, Of what his bursting chest would scarce contain! For 'tis so common, in this age of ours, So easy, to contemn the Immortal Powers, That, can we but elude man's searching eyes, We laugh to scorn the witness of the skies. Mark, with how bold a voice, and fix'd a brow, The villain dares his treachery disavow! “By the all-hallow'd orb that flames above, “I had it not! By the red bolts of Jove, “By the wing'd shaft that laid the Centaur low, “By Dian's arrows, by Apollo's bow, “By the strong lance that Mars delights to wield, “By Neptune's trident, by Minerva's shield, “And every weapon that, to vengeance given, “Stores the tremendous magazine of heaven!— “Nay, if I had, I'll slay this son of mine, “And eat his head, soused in Egyptian brine.” There are, who think that chance is all in all, That no First Cause directs the eternal ball; But that brute Nature, in her blind career, Varies the seasons, and brings round the year: These rush to every shrine, with equal ease, And, owning none, swear by what Power you please. Others believe, and but believe, a god, And think that punishment may follow fraud; Yet they forswear, and, reasoning on the deed, Thus reconcile their actions with their creed: “Let Isis storm, if to revenge inclined, “And with her angry sistrum, strike me blind, “So, with my eyes, she ravish not my ore, “But let me keep the pledge which I forswore. “Are putrid sores, catarrhs that seldom kill, “And crippled limbs, forsooth, so great an ill! “Ladas, if not stark mad, would change, no doubt, “His flying feet, for riches and the gout; “For what do those procure him? mere renown, “And the starv'd honour of an olive crown. “But grant the wrath of heaven be great; 'tis slow, “And days, and months, and years, precede the blow. “If, then, to punish all, the gods decree, “When, in their vengeance, will they come to me? “But I, perhaps, their anger may appease— “For they are wont to pardon faults like these: “At worst, there's hope; since every age and clime, “See different fates attend the self-same crime; “Some made by villainy, and some undone, “And This ascend a scaffold, That a throne.” These sophistries, to fix awhile suffice, The mind, yet shuddering at the thought of vice; And, thus confirm'd, at the first call they come, Nay, rush before you to the sacred dome: Chide your slow pace, drag you, amazed, along, And play the raving Phasma, to the throng. (For impudence the vulgar suffrage draws, And seems the assurance of a righteous cause.) While you, poor wretch, suspected by the crowd, With Stentor's lungs, or Mars', exclaim aloud: “Jove! Jove! will nought thy indignation rouse? “Canst thou, in silence, hear these faithless vows? “When all thy fury, on the slaves accurst, “From lips of marble or of brass should burst!— “Or else, why burn we incense at thy shrine, “And heap thy altars with the fat of swine, “When we might crave redress, for aught I see, “As wisely of Bathyllus, as of thee!” Rash man!—but hear, in turn, what I propose, To mitigate, if not to heal, your woes; I, who no knowledge of the schools possess, Cynick, or Stoick, differing but in dress, Or thine, calm Epicurus, whose pure mind, To one small garden, every wish confined. In desperate cases, able doctors fee; But trust your pulse to Philip's boy—or me. If no example of so foul a deed, On earth be found, I urge no more: proceed, And beat your breast, and rend your hoary hair; 'Tis just:—for thus our losses we declare; And money is bewail'd with deeper sighs, Than friends or kindred, and with louder cries. There none dissemble, none, with scenick art, Affect a sorrow, foreign from the heart; Content in squalid garments to appear, And vex their lids for one hard-gotten tear: No, genuine drops fall copious from their eyes, And their breasts labour with unbidden sighs. But when you see each court of justice throng'd, With crowds, like you, by faithless friendship wrong'd, See men abjure their bonds, though duly framed, And oft revised, by all the parties named, While their own hand and seal, in every eye, Flash broad conviction, and evince the lie; Shall you alone, on Fortune's smiles presume, And claim exemption from the common doom? —From a white hen, forsooth, 'twas yours to spring, Ours, to be hatch'd beneath some luckless wing! Pause from your grief, and, with impartial eyes, Survey the daring crimes which round you rise; Your injuries, then, will scarce deserve a name, And your false friend be half absolv'd from blame! What's he, poor knave! to those who stab for hire, Who kindle, and then spread, the midnight fire? Say, what to those who, from the hoary shrine, Tear the huge vessels age hath stamp'd divine, Offerings of price, by grateful nations given, And crowns inscribed, by pious kings, to heaven? What to the minor thieves, who, missing these, Abrade the gilded thighs of Hercules, Strip Neptune of his silvery beard, and peel Castor's leaf-gold, where spread from head to heel? Or what to those who, with pernicious craft, Mingle and set to sale the deadly draught; Or those, who in a raw ox hide are bound, And, with an ill-starr'd ape, poor sufferer! drown'd? Yet these—how small a portion of the crimes, That stain the records of those dreadful times, And Gallicus, the city præfect, hears, From light's first dawning, till it disappears! The state of morals would you learn at Rome? No further seek than his judicial dome: Give one short morning to the horrours there, And then complain, then murmur, if you dare! Say, whom do goitres on the Alps surprise? In Meroë, whom the breast's enormous size? Whom locks, in Germany, of golden hue, And spiral curls, and eyes of sapphire blue? None; for the prodigy, among them shared, Becomes mere nature, and escapes regard. When clouds of Thracian birds obscure the sky, To arms! to arms! the desperate Pigmies cry: But soon, defeated in the unequal fray, Disorder'd flee; while, pouncing on their prey, The victor cranes descend, and, clamouring, bear The wriggling mannikins aloft in air. Here, could our climes to such a scene give birth, We all should burst with agonies of mirth; There, unsurprised, they view the frequent fight, Nor smile at heroes scarce a foot in height. “Shall then no ill the perjured head attend, “No punishment o'ertake this faithless friend?” Suppose him seiz'd, abandon'd to your will, What more would rage? to torture or to kill; Yet still your loss, your injury would remain, And draw no retribution from his pain. “True; but methinks the smallest drop of blood, “Squeezed from his mangled limbs, would do me good: “Revenge, they say, and I believe their words, “A pleasure sweeter far than life affords.” Who say? the fools, whose passions, prone to ire, At slightest causes, or at none take fire; Whose boiling breasts, at every turn, o'erflow With rancorous gall: Chrysippus said not so; Nor Thales, to our frailties clement still; Nor that old man, by sweet Hymettus' hill, Who drank the poison with unruffled soul, And dying, from his foes withheld the bowl. Divine philosophy! by whose pure light We first distinguish, then pursue the right, Thy power the breast from every errour frees, And weeds out all its vices by degrees:— Illumined by thy beam, revenge we find, The abject pleasure of an abject mind, And hence so dear to poor, weak, woman-kind. But why are those, Calvinus, thought to scape, Unpunish'd, whom, in every fearful shape, Guilt still alarms, and conscience ne'er asleep, Wounds with incessant strokes, “not loud but deep,” While the vex'd mind, her own tormentor, plies A scorpion scourge, unmark'd by human eyes! Trust me, no tortures which the poets feign, Can match the fierce, the unutterable pain He feels, who night and day, devoid of rest, Carries his own accuser in his breast. A Spartan once the Oracle besought, To solve a scruple which perplex'd his thought, And plainly tell him, if he might forswear A purse, of old, confided to his care. Incens'd, the priestess answer'd—“Waverer, no! “Nor shalt thou, for the doubt, unpunish'd go.” With that, he hasten'd to restore the trust; But fear alone, not virtue, made him just: Hence, he soon proved the Oracle divine, And all the answer worthy of the shrine; For plagues pursued his race without delay, And swept them from the earth, like dust, away. By such dire sufferings did the wretch atone, The crime of meditated fraud alone! For, in the eye of heaven, a wicked deed Devised, is done: What, then, if we proceed?— Perpetual fears the offender's peace destroy, And rob the social hour of all its joy: Feverish, and parch'd, he chews, with many a pause, The tasteless food, that swells beneath his jaws: Spits out the produce of the Albanian hill, Mellow'd by age;—you bring him mellower still, And lo, such wrinkles on his brow appear, As if you brought Falernian vinegar! At night, should sleep his harass'd limbs compose, And steal him, one short moment from his woes, Then dreams invade; sudden, before his eyes, The violated fane and altar rise; And (what disturbs him most) your injured shade, In more than mortal majesty array'd, Frowns on the wretch, alarms his treacherous rest, And wrings the dreadful secret from his breast. These, these are they, who tremble and turn pale, At the first mutterings of the hollow gale! Who sink with terrour at the transient glare Of meteors, glancing through the turbid air! Oh, 'tis not chance, they cry; this hideous crash, Is not the war of winds; nor this dread flash, The encounter of dark clouds; but blasting fire, Charged with the wrath of heaven's insulted sire! That dreaded peal, innoxious, dies away; Shuddering, they wait the next with more dismay, As if the short reprieve were only sent, To add new horrours to their punishment. Yet more; when the first symptoms of disease, When feverish heats, their restless members seize, They think the plague by wrath divine bestow'd, And feel, in every pang, the avenging God. Rack'd at the thought, in hopeless grief they lie, And dare not tempt the mercy of the sky: For what can such expect! what victim slay, That is not worthier far to live, than they! With what a rapid change of fancy roll The varying passions of the guilty soul!— Bold to offend, they scarce commit the offence, Ere the mind labours with an innate sense Of right and wrong;—not long, for nature still, Incapable of change, and fix'd in ill, Recurs to her old habits:—never yet Could sinner to his sin a period set. When did the flush of modest blood inflame The cheek, once hardened to the sense of shame? Or when the offender, since the birth of time, Retire, contented with a single crime? And this false friend of ours shall still pursue His dangerous course, till vengeance, doubly due, O'ertake his guilt; then shalt thou see him cast In chains, 'mid tortures to expire his last; Or hurried off, to join the wretched train Of exiled great ones, in the Ægean main. This, thou shalt see; and, while thy voice applauds The dreadful justice of the offended gods, Reform thy creed, and, with an humble mind, Confess that Heaven is neither deaf nor blind! SATIRE XIV. TO FUSCINUS. Yes, there are faults, Fuscinus, that disgrace The noblest qualities of birth and place; Which, like infectious blood, transmitted, run, In one eternal stream, from sire to son. If, in destructive play, the senior waste His joyous nights, the child, with kindred taste, Repeats, in miniature, the darling vice, Shakes the small box, and cogs the little dice. Nor does that infant fairer hopes inspire, Who, train'd by the gray epicure, his sire, Has learn'd to pickle mushrooms, and, like him, To souse the beccaficos, till they swim!— For take him, thus to early luxury bred, Ere twice four springs have blossom'd o'er his head, And let ten thousand teachers, hoar with age, Inculcate temperance from the stoick page; His wish will ever be, in state to dine, And keep his kitchen's honour from decline! Does Rutilus inspire a generous mind, Prone to forgive, and to slight errours blind; Instil the liberal thought, that slaves have powers, Sense, feeling, all, as exquisite as ours; Or fury? He, who hears the sounding thong, With far more pleasure than the Syren's song; Who, the stern tyrant of his small domain, The Polypheme of his domestick train, Knows no delight, save when the torturer's hand, Stamps, for low theft, the agonising brand.— O, what but rage can fill that stripling's breast, Who sees his savage sire then only blest, When his stretch'd ears drink in the wretches' cries, And racks and prisons fill his vengeful eyes! And dare we hope, yon girl, from Larga sprung, Will e'er prove virtuous; when her little tongue, Ne'er told so fast her mother's wanton train, But that she stopt and breath'd, and stopt again? Even from her tender years, unnatural trust! The child was privy to the matron's lust:— Scarce ripe for man, with her own hand, she writes The billets, which the ancient bawd indites, Employs the self-same pimps, and looks, ere long, To share the visits of the amorous throng! So Nature prompts: drawn by her secret tie, We view a parent's deeds with reverent eye; With fatal haste, alas! the example take, And love the sin, for the dear sinner's sake.— One youth, perhaps, form'd of superiour clay, And warm'd, by Titan, with a purer ray, May dare to slight proximity of blood, And, in despite of nature, to be good: One youth—the rest the beaten pathway tread, And blindly follow where their fathers lead. O fatal guides! this reason should suffice, To win you from the slippery route of vice, This powerful reason; lest your sons pursue The guilty track, thus plainly mark'd by you! For youth is facile, and its yielding will Receives, with fatal ease, the imprint of ill: Hence Catilines in every clime abound; But where are Cato and his nephew found! Swift from the roof where youth, Fuscinus, dwell, Immodest sights, immodest sounds expel; The place is sacred: Far, far hence, remove, Ye venal votaries of illicit love! Ye dangerous knaves, who pander to be fed, And sell yourselves to infamy for bread! Reverence to children, as to heaven, is due: When you would, then, some darling sin pursue, Think that your infant offspring eyes the deed; And let the thought abate your guilty speed, Back from the headlong steep your steps entice, And check you, tottering on the verge of vice. O yet reflect! for should he e'er provoke, In riper age, the law's avenging stroke, (Since not alone in person and in face, But ev'n in morals, he will prove his race, And, while example acts with fatal force, Side, nay outstrip, you, in the vicious course) Vex'd, you will rave and storm; perhaps, prepare, Should threatening fail, to name another heir! —Audacious! with what front, do you aspire To exercise the license of a sire? When all, with rising indignation, view, The youth, in turpitude, surpass'd by you, By you, old fool, whose windy, brainless head, Long since required the cupping-glass's aid! Is there a guest expected? all is haste, All hurry in the house, from first to last. “Sweep the dry cobwebs down!” the master cries, Whips in his hand, and fury in his eyes, “Let not a spot the clouded columns stain; “Scour you the figured silver; you, the plain!” O inconsistent wretch! is all this coil, Lest the front-hall, or gallery, daub'd with soil, (Which, yet, a little sand removes,) offend The prying eye of some indifferent friend? And do you stir not, that your son may see, The house from moral filth, from vices free! True, you have given a citizen to Rome; And she shall thank you, if the youth become, By your o'er-ruling care, or soon or late, A useful member of the parent state: For all depends on you; the stamp he'll take, From the strong impress which, at first, you make; And prove, as vice or virtue was your aim, His country's glory, or his country's shame. The stork, with snakes and lizards from the wood, And pathless wild, supports her callow brood; And the fledg'd storklings, when to wing they take, Seek the same reptiles, through the devious brake. The vulture snuffs from far the tainted gale, And, hurrying where the putrid scents exhale, From gibbets and from graves the carcase tears, And to her young the loathsome dainty bears; Her young, grown vigorous, hasten from the nest, And gorge on carrion with the parent's zest. While Jove's own eagle, bird of noble blood, Scours the wide champaign for untainted food, Bears the swift hare, or swifter fawn away, And feeds her nestlings with the generous prey; Her nestlings hence, when from the rock they spring, And, pinch'd by hunger, to the quarry wing, Stoop only to the game they tasted first, When, clamourous, from the shell, to light they burst. Centronius plann'd and built, and built and plann'd; And now along Cajeta's winding strand, And now amid Præneste's hills, and now, On lofty Tibur's solitary brow, He rear'd prodigious piles, with marble brought From distant realms, and exquisitely wrought: Prodigious piles! that tower'd o'er Fortune's shrine, As those of gelt Posides, Jove, o'er thine! While thus Centronius crowded seat on seat, He spent his cash, and mortgaged his estate; Yet left enough his family to content: Which his mad son, to the last farthing, spent, While, building on, he strove, with fond desire, To shame the stately structures of his sire! Sprung from a father who the sabbath fears, There is, who nought but clouds and skies reveres; And shuns the taste, by old tradition led, Of human flesh, and swine's, with equal dread:— This first: the prepuce next he lays aside, And, taught the Roman ritual to deride, Clings to the Jewish, and observes with awe, All Moses bade in his mysterious law: And, therefore, to the circumcised alone, Will point the road, or make the fountain known; Warn'd by his bigot sire, who whiled away, Sacred to sloth, each seventh revolving day. But youth, so prone to follow other ills, Are driven to avarice, against their wills; For this grave vice, assuming Virtue's guise, Seems Virtue's self, to undiscerning eyes. The miser, hence, a frugal man, they name; And hence, they follow, with their whole acclaim, The griping wretch, who strictlier guards his store, Than if the Hesperian dragon kept the door.— Add that the vulgar, still a slave to gold, The worthy, in the wealthy, man behold; And, reasoning from the fortune he has made, Hail him, A perfect master of his trade! And true, indeed, it is—such masters raise Immense estates; no matter, by what ways; But raise they do, with brows in sweat still died, With forge still glowing, and with sledge still plied. The father, by the love of wealth possest, Convinced—the covetous alone are blest, And that, nor past, nor present times, e'er knew A poor man happy,—bids his son pursue The paths they take, the courses they affect, And follow, at the heels, this thriving sect. Vice boasts its elements, like other arts; These, he inculcates first: anon, imparts The petty tricks of saving; last, inspires, Of endless wealth, the insatiable desires.— Hungry himself, his hungry slaves he cheats, With scanty measures, and unfaithful weights; And sees them lessen, with increasing dread, The flinty fragments of his vinew'd bread. In dogdays, when the sun, with fervent power, Corrupts the freshest meat from hour to hour, He saves the last night's hash, sets by a dish Of sodden beans, and scraps of summer fish, And half a stinking shad, and a few strings Of a chopp'd leek—all told, like sacred things, And seal'd with caution, though the sight and smell, Would a starv'd beggar from the board repel. But why this dire avidity of gain? This mass collected with such toil and pain? Since 'tis the veriest madness, to live poor, And die with bags and coffers running o'er. Besides, while thus the streams of affluence roll, They nurse the eternal dropsy of the soul, For thirst of wealth, still grows with wealth increast, And they desire it less, who have it least.— Now swell his wants: one manor is too small, Another must be bought, house, lands, and all; Still “cribb'd confined,” he spurns the narrow bounds, And turns an eye on every neighbour's grounds: There all allures; his crops appear a foil, To the rich produce of their happier soil. “And this, I'll purchase, with the grove,” he cries, “And that fair hill, where the gray olives rise.” Then, if the owner to no price will yield, (Resolv'd to keep the hereditary field,) Whole droves of oxen, starv'd to this intent, Among his springing corn, by night, are sent, To revel there, till not a blade be seen, And all appear like a close-shaven green. “Monstrous!” you say—And yet, 'twere hard to tell, What numbers, tricks like these have forced to sell. But, sure, the general voice has mark'd his name, And giv'n him up to infamy and shame:— “And what of that?” he cries. “I value more, “A single lupine, added to my store, “Than all the country's praise; if curs'd by fate, “With the scant produce of a small estate.”— 'Tis well! no more shall age or grief annoy, But nights of peace succeed to days of joy, If more of ground to you alone pertain, Than Rome possest, in Numa's pious reign! Since then, the veteran, whose brave breast was gored, By the fierce Pyrrhick, or Molossian sword, Hardly received for all his service past, And all his wounds, two acres at the last; The meed of toil and blood! yet never thought, His country thankless, or his pains ill bought. For then, this little glebe, improved with care, Largely supplied, with vegetable fare, The good old man, the wife in childbed laid, And four hale boys, that round the cottage play'd, Three free-born, one a slave: while, on the board, Huge porringers, with wholesome pottage stored, Smoked for their elder brothers, who were now, Hungry and tired, expected from the plough.— Two acres will not, now, so changed the times, Afford a garden-plot:—and hence our crimes! For not a vice that taints the human soul, More frequent points the sword, or drugs the bowl, Than the dire lust of an “untamed estate”— Since, he who covets wealth, disdains to wait: Law threatens, Conscience calls—yet on he hies, And this he silences, and that defies, Fear, Shame,—he bears down all, and, with loose rein, Sweeps headlong o'er the alluring paths of gain! “Let us, my sons, contented with our lot, “Enjoy, in peace, our hillock and our cot, (The good old Marsian to his children said,) “And from our labour, seek our daily bread. “So shall we please the rural Powers, whose care, “And kindly aid, first taught us to prepare “The golden grain, what time we ranged the wood, “A savage race, for acorns, savage food! “The poor who, with inverted skins, defy “The lowering tempest, and the freezing sky, “Who, without shame, without reluctance go, “In clouted brogues, through mire and drifted snow, “Ne'er think of ill: 'tis purple, boys, alone, “Which leads to guilt,—purple, to us unknown.” Thus, to their children, spoke the sires of yore. Now, autumn's sickly heats are scarcely o'er, Ere, while deep midnight yet involves the skies, The impatient father shakes his son, and cries, “What, ho, boy, wake! Up; pleas, rejoinders draw, “Turn o'er the rubrick of our ancient law; “Up, up, and study: or, with brief in hand, “Petition Lælius for a small command, “A captain's;—Lælius loves a spreading chest, “Broad shoulders, tangled locks, and hairy breast: “The British towers, the Moorish tents destroy, “And the rich Eagle, at threescore, enjoy! “But if the trump, prelusive to the fight, “And the long labours of the camp affright, “Go, look for merchandise of readiest vent, “Which yields a sure return of cent. per cent. “Buy this, no matter what; the ware is good, “Though not allow'd on this side Tiber's flood: “Hides, unguents, mark me, boy, are equal things, “And gain smells sweet, from whatso'er it springs. “This golden sentence, which the Powers of heaven, “Which Jove himself, might glory to have given, “Will never, never, from your thoughts, I trust,— “None question whence it comes; but come it must.” This, when the lisping race a farthing ask, Old women set them, as a previous task; The wondrous apophthegm all run to get, And learn it sooner than their alphabet. But why this haste? Without your care, vain fool! The pupil will, ere long, the tutor school: Sleep then, in peace; secure to be outdone, Like Telamon, or Peleus, by your son. O, yet indulge awhile his tender years: The seeds of vice, sown by your fostering cares, Have scarce ta'en root; but they will spring at length, “Grow with his growth, and strengthen with his strength.” Then, when the firstlings of his youth are paid, And his rough chin requires the razor's aid, Then he will swear, then to the altar come, And sell deep perjuries, for a paltry sum!— Believe your step-daughter already dead, If, with an ample dower, she mount his bed: Lo! scarcely laid, his murderous fingers creep, And close her eyes in everlasting sleep. For that vast wealth which, with long years of pain, You thought would be acquired by land and main, He gets a readier way: the skill's not great, The toil not much, to make a knave complete. But you will say hereafter, “I am free: “He never learn'd those practices of me.” Yes, all of you:—for he who, madly blind, Imbues with avarice his children's mind, Fires with the thirst of riches, and applauds The attempt, to double their estate by frauds, Unconscious, flings the headlong wheels the rein, Which he may wish to stop, but wish in vain; Deaf to his voice, with growing speed they roll, Smoke down the steep, and spurn the distant goal! None sin by rule; none heed the charge precise, Thus, and no further, may ye step in vice; But leap the bounds prescribed, and, with free pace, Scour far and wide, the interdicted space. So, when you tell the youth, that fools alone Regard a friend's distresses as their own; You bid the willing hearer riches raise, By fraud, by rapine, by the worst of ways; Riches, whose love is on your soul imprest, Deep as their country's on the Decii's breast; Or Thebes on his, who sought an early grave, (If Greece say true,) her sacred walls to save. Thebes, where, impregn'd with serpent's teeth, the earth Pour'd forth a marshall'd host, prodigious birth! Horrent with arms, that fought with headlong rage, Nor ask'd the trumpet's signal, to engage.— But mark the end! the fire, derived, at first, From a small sparkle, by your folly nurst, Blown to a flame, on all around it preys, And wraps you in the universal blaze. So the young lion rent, with hideous roar, His keeper's trembling limbs, and drank his gore. “Tush! I am safe,” you cry; “Chaldæan seers, “Have raised my Scheme, and promised length of years.” But has your son subscribed? will he await The lingering distaff of decrepid Fate? No;—his impatience will the work confound, And snap the vital thread, ere half unwound. Ev'n now your long and stag-like age annoys His future hopes, and palls his present joys. Fly then, and bid Archigenes prepare An antidote, if life be worth your care; If you would see another autumn close, And pluck another fig, another rose:— Take mithridate, rash man, before your meat, A father, you? and without med'cine eat! Come, my Fuscinus, come with me, and view, A scene more comick than the stage e'er knew. Lo! with what toil, what danger, wealth is sought, And to the fane of watchful Castor brought; Since Mars the Avenger slumber'd, to his cost, And, with his helmet, all his credit lost! Quit then the plays! the farce of life supplies A scene more comick, in the sage's eyes. For who amuses most?—the man who springs, Light, through the hoop, and on the tight-rope swings; Or he, who, to a fragile bark confined, Dwells on the deep, the sport of wave and wind? Foolhardy wretch! scrambling for every bale Of stinking merchandize, exposed to sale; And proud to Crete, for ropy wine, to rove, And jars, the fellow citizens of Jove! That skips along the rope, with wavering tread, Dangerous dexterity, which brings him bread; This ventures life, for wealth too vast to spend, Farm join'd to farm, and villas without end! Lo, every harbour throng'd and every bay, And half mankind upon the watery way! For, where he hears the attractive voice of gain, The merchant hurries, and defies the main.— Nor will he only range the Libyan shore, But, passing Calpé, other worlds explore; See Phœbus, sinking in the Atlantick, lave His fiery car, and hear the hissing wave. And all for what? O glorious end! to come, His toils o'erpast, with purse replenish'd, home, And, with a traveller's privilege, vent his boasts, Of unknown monsters seen on unknown coasts. What varying forms in madness may we trace!— Safe in his loved Electra's fond embrace, Orestes sees the avenging Furies rise, And flash their bloody torches in his eyes; While Ajax strikes an ox, and, at the blow, Hears Agamemnon, or Ulysses low: And surely he, (though, haply, he forbear, Like these, his keeper and his clothes to tear,) Is just as mad, who, to the water's brim, Loads his frail bark—a plank 'twixt death and him! When all this risk, is but to swell his store, With a few coins, a few gold pieces more. Heaven lours, and frequent, through the muttering air, The nimble lightning glares, or seems to glare: “Weigh! weigh!” the impatient man of traffick cries, “These gathering clouds, this rack that dims the skies, “Are but the pageants of a sultry day; “A thunder shower, that frowns, and melts away.” Deluded wretch! dash'd on some dangerous coast, This night, this hour, perhaps, his bark is lost; While he still strives, though whelm'd beneath the wave, His darling purse with teeth, or hand, to save. Thus he, who sigh'd, of late, for all the gold, Down the bright Tagus and Pactolus roll'd, Now bounds his wishes to one poor request, A scanty morsel and a tatter'd vest; And shows, where tears, where supplications fail, A daubing of his melancholy tale! Wealth, by such dangers earn'd, such anxious pain, Requires more care to keep it, than to gain: Whate'er my miseries, make me not, kind Fate, The sleepless Argus of a vast estate! The slaves of Licinus, a numerous band, Watch through the night, with buckets in their hand, While their rich master trembling lies, afraid, Lest fire his ivory, amber, gold, invade. The naked Cynick mocks such restless cares, His earthen tub no conflagration fears; If crack'd, to-morrow he procures a new, Or, coarsely soldering, makes the old one do. Even Philip's son, when, in his little cell, Content, he saw the mighty master dwell, Own'd, with a sigh, that he, who nought desired, Was happier far, than he who worlds required, And whose ambition certain dangers brought, Vast, and unbounded, as the object sought.— Fortune, advanced to heaven by fools alone, Would lose, were wisdom ours, her shadowy throne. “What call I, then, enough?” What will afford, A decent habit, and a frugal board; What Epicurus' little garden bore, And Socrates sufficient thought, before: These squared by Nature's rules their blameless life— Nature and Wisdom never are at strife. You think, perhaps, these rigid means too scant, And that I ground philosophy on want; Take then, (for I will be indulgent now, And something for the change of times allow,) As much as Otho for a knight requires:— If this, unequal to your wild desires, Contract your brow; enlarge the sum, and take, As much as two,—as much as three—will make. If yet, in spite of this prodigious store, Your craving bosom yawn, unfill'd, for more, Then, all the wealth of Lydia's king, increast By all the treasures of the gorgeous East, Will not content you; no, nor all the gold Of that proud slave, whose mandate Rome controll'd, Who sway'd the Emperour, and whose fatal word Plunged, in the Empress' breast, the lingering sword! SATIRE XV. TO VOLUSIUS BITHYNICUS. Who knows not to what monstrous gods, my friend, The mad inhabitants of Egypt bend?— The snake-devouring ibis, These inshrine, Those think the crocodile alone divine; Others, where Thebes' vast ruins strew the ground, And shatter'd Memnon yields a magick sound, Set up a glittering brute of uncouth shape, And bow before the image of an ape! Thousands regard the hound with holy fear, Not one, Diana: and 'tis dangerous here, To violate an onion, or to stain The sanctity of leeks with tooth profane. O holy nations! Sacro-sanct abodes! Where every garden propagates its gods! They spare the fleecy kind, and think it ill, The blood of lambkins, or of kids, to spill; But, human flesh—O! that is lawful fare, And you may eat it without scandal there. When, at the amazed Alcinoüs' board, of old, Ulysses of so strange an action told, He moved of some the mirth, of more the gall, And, for a lying vagrant, pass'd with all. “Will no one plunge this babbler in the waves, “(Worthy a true Charybdis,)—while he raves “Of monsters seen not since the world began, “Cyclops and Læstrigons, who feed on man! “For me—I less should doubt of Scylla's train, “Of rocks that float and jostle in the main, “Of bladders fill'd with storms, of men, in fine, “By magick changed, and driven to grunt with swine, “Than of his cannibals:—the fellow feigns, “As if he thought Phæacians had no brains.” Thus, one, perhaps, more sober than the rest, Observ'd, and justly, of their travell'd guest, Who spoke of prodigies till then unknown; Yet brought no attestation but his own. —I bring my wonders, too; and I can tell, When Junius, late, was consul, what befel, Near Coptus' walls; tell of a people stain'd, With deeper guilt, than tragedy e'er feign'd: For, sure, no buskin'd bard, from Pyrrha's time, E'er tax'd a whole community with crime; Take then a scene yet to the stage unknown, And, by a nation, acted—in our own! Between two neighbouring towns a deadly hate, Sprung from a sacred grudge of ancient date, Yet burns; a hate no lenients can assuage, No time subdue, a rooted, rancorous rage! Blind bigotry, at first, the evil wrought: For each despised the others gods, and thought Its own the true, the genuine, in a word, The only deities to be adored! And now the Ombite festival drew near: When the prime Tent'rites, envious of their cheer, Resolv'd to seize the occasion, to annoy Their feast, and spoil the sacred week of joy.— It came: the hour the thoughtless Ombites greet, And crowd the porches, crowd the publick street, With tables richly spread; where, night and day, Plunged in the abyss of gluttony, they lay: (For savage as the nome appears, it vies In luxury, if I may trust my eyes, With dissolute Canopus:) Six were past, Six days of riot, and the seventh and last Rose on the feast: and now the Tent'rites thought, A cheap, a bloodless victory might be bought, O'er such a helpless crew; nor thought they wrong, Nor could the event be doubtful, where a throng Of drunken revellers, stammering, reeling-ripe, And capering to a sooty minstrel's pipe, Coarse unguents, chaplets, flowers, on this side fight; On that, keen hatred, and deliberate spite! At first both sides, though eager to engage, With taunts and jeers, the heralds of their rage, Blow up their mutual fury; and anon, Kindled to madness, with loud shouts rush on; Deal, though unarm'd, their vengeance blindly round, And with clench'd fists print many a ghastly wound. Then might you see, amid the desperate fray, Features disfigured, noses torn away, Hands, where the gore of mangled eyes yet reeks, And jaw-bones starting through the cloven cheeks! But this is sport, mere children's play, they cry— As yet beneath their feet no bodies lie, And, to what purpose should such armies fight The cause of heaven, if none be slain outright? Roused at the thought, more fiercely they engage, With stones, the weapons of intestine rage; Yet not precisely such, to tell you true, As Turnus erst, or mightier Ajax, threw; Nor quite so large as that two-handed stone, Which bruised Æneas on the huckle-bone; But such as men, in our degenerate days, Ah, how unlike to theirs! make shift to raise. Even in his time, Mæonides could trace, Some diminution of the human race: Now, earth, grown old and frigid, rears with pain A pigmy brood, a weak and wicked train; Which every god, who marks their passions vile, Regards with laughter, though he loaths the while. But to our tale. Inforced with arm'd supplies, The zealous Tent'rites feel their courage rise, And wave their swords, and, kindling at the sight, Press on, and with fell rage renew the fight. The Ombites flee; they follow:—in the rear, A luckless wretch, confounded by his fear, Trips and falls headlong; with loud yelling cries, The pack rush in, and seize him as he lies. And now the conquerours, none to disappoint Of the dire banquet, tear him joint by joint, And dole him round; the bones yet warm, they gnaw, And champ the flesh that heaves beneath their jaw. They want no cook to dress it—'twould be long, And appetite is keen, and rage is strong. And here, Volusius, I rejoice at least, That fire was unprofaned by this curs'd feast, Fire, rapt from heaven! and you will, sure, agree To greet the element's escape, with me. —But all who ventured on the carcase, swore They never tasted—aught so sweet before! Nor did the relish charm the first alone— Those who arrived too late for flesh, or bone, Stoop'd down, and scraping where the wretch had lain, With savage pleasure lick'd the gory plain! The Vascons once, (the story yet is rife,) With such dire sustenance prolong'd their life; But then the cause was different: Fortune, there, Proved adverse: they had born the extremes of war, The rage of famine, the still-watchful foe, And all the ills beleagured cities know. (And nothing less, should prompt mankind to use Such desperate means.) May this their crime excuse! For after every root and herb were gone, And every aliment to hunger known; When their lean frames, and cheeks of sallow hue, Struck even the foe with pity at the view, And all were ready their own flesh to tear, They first adventured on this horrid fare. And surely every god would pity grant, To men so worn by wretchedness and want, And even the very ghosts of those they ate, Absolve them, mindful of their dreadful state! True, we are wiser; and, by Zeno taught, Know life itself may be too dearly bought; But the poor Vascon, in that early age, Knew nought of Zeno, or the Stoick page.— Now, thanks to Greece and Rome, in wisdom's robe, The bearded tribes rush forth, and seize the globe: Already, learned Gaul aspires to teach, Your British orators the Art of Speech; And Thulé, blessings on her! seems to say, She'll hire a good grammarian, cost what may. The Vascons, then, who thus prolong'd their breath, And the Saguntines, true, like them, to death, Brave too, like them, but by worse ills subdued, Had some small plea for this abhorred food. Diana first, (and let us doubt no more, The barbarous rites we disbelieved of yore,) Rear'd her dread altar near the Taurick flood, And ask'd the sacrifice of human blood: Yet there the victim only lost his life, And fear'd no cruelty beyond the knife. Far, far more savage, Egypt's frantick train, They butcher first, and then devour the slain! But say, what cause impell'd them to proceed, What siege, what famine, to this monstrous deed? What could they more, had Nile refused to rise, And the soil gaped with ever-glowing skies, What could they more, the guilty Flood to shame, And heap opprobrium on his hateful name! Lo! what the barbarous hordes of Scythia, Thrace, Gaul, Britain, never dared,—dared by a race Of puny dastards, who, with fingers frail, Tug the light oar, and hoist the little sail, In painted pans! What tortures can the mind, Suggest for miscreants of this abject kind, Whom spite impell'd worse horrours to pursue, Than famine, in its deadliest form, e'er knew! Nature, who gave us tears, by that alone, Proclaims she made the feeling heart our own; And 'tis her noblest boon: This bids us fly, To wipe the drops from sorrowing friendship's eye, Sorrowing ourselves; to wail the prisoner's state, And sympathize in the wrong'd orphan's fate, Compell'd his treacherous guardian to accuse, While many a shower his blooming cheek bedews, And through his scatter'd tresses, wet with tears, A doubtful face, or boy or girl's, appears. As Nature bids, we sigh, when some bright maid Is, ere her spousals, to the pyre convey'd; Some babe—by fate's inexorable doom, Just shown on earth, and hurried to the tomb. For who, that to the sanctity aspires, Which Ceres, for her mystick torch, requires, Feels not another's woes? This marks our birth; The great distinction from the beasts of earth! And therefore,—gifted with superiour powers, And capable of things divine,—'tis ours, To learn, and practise, every useful art; And, from high heaven, deduce that better part, That moral sense, denied to creatures prone, And downward bent, and found with man alone!— For He, who gave this vast machine to roll, Breathed life in them, in us a reasoning soul; That kindred feelings might our state improve, And mutual wants conduct to mutual love; Woo to one spot the scatter'd hordes of men, From their old forest, and paternal den; Raise the fair dome, extend the social line, And, to our mansion, those of others join, Join too our faith, our confidence to theirs, And sleep, relying on the general cares:— In war, that each to each support might lend, When wounded, succour, and when fall'n, defend; At the same trumpet's clangor rush to arms, By the same walls be shelter'd from alarms, Near the same tower the foe's incursions wait, And trust their safety to one common gate. —But serpents, now, more links of concord bind: The cruel leopard spares the spotted kind; No lion spills a weaker lion's gore, No boar expires beneath a stronger boar; In leagues of friendship, tigers roam the plain, And bears with bears perpetual peace maintain. While man, alas! flesh'd in the dreadful trade, Forges without remorse the murderous blade, On that dire anvil, where primæval skill, As yet untaught a brother's blood to spill, Wrought only what meek nature would allow, Goads for the ox, and coulters for the plough! Even this is trifling: we have seen a rage, Too fierce for murder only to assuage; Seen a whole state their victim piecemeal tear, And count each quivering limb delicious fare. O, could the Samian Sage these horrours see, What would he say? or to what deserts flee? He, who the flesh of beasts, like man's, declined, And scarce indulged in pulse—of every kind! SATIRE XVI. TO GALLUS. Who can recount the advantages that wait, Dear Gallus, on the Military State?— For let me once, beneath a lucky star, Faint as I am of heart, and new to war, But join the camp, and that ascendant hour Shall lord it o'er my fate with happier power, Than if a line from Venus should commend My suit to Mars, or Juno stand my friend! And first, of benefits which all may share: 'Tis somewhat—that no citizen shall dare To strike you, or, though struck, return the blow: But wave the wrong; nor to the Prætor show His teeth dash'd out, his face deform'd with gore, And eyes, no skill can promise to restore! A Judge, if to the camp your plaints you bear, Coarse shod, and coarser greaved, awaits you there: By antique law proceeds the cassock'd sage, And rules prescribed in old Camillus' age; To wit, Let soldiers seek no foreign bench, Nor plead to any charge, without the trench. O nicely do Centurions sift the cause, When buff-and-belt-men violate the laws! And ample, if with reason we complain, Is, doubtless, the redress our injuries gain! Even so:—but the whole legion are our foes, And, with determined aim, the award oppose. “These snivelling rogues take special pleasure still, “To make the punishment outweigh the ill.” So runs the cry; and he must be possest, Of more, Vagellius, than thy iron breast, Who braves their anger, and with ten poor toes, Defies such countless hosts of hobnail'd shoes. Who so untutor'd in the ways of Rome? Say, who so true a Pylades? to come, Within the camp?—no: let thy tears be dried, Nor ask that kindness, which must be denied. For, when the Court exclaims, “Your witness, here!” Let that firm friend, that man of men, appear, And testify but what he saw and heard; And I pronounce him, worthy of the beard, And hair of our forefathers! You may find, False witnesses against an honest hind, Easier than true, (and who their fears can blame?) Against a soldier's purse, a soldier's fame! But there are other benefits, my friend, And greater, which the sons of war attend: Should a litigious neighbour bid me yield My vale irriguous, and paternal field; Or from my bounds the sacred landmark tear, To which, with each revolving spring, I bear, In pious duty to the grateful soil, My humble offerings, honey, meal, and oil; Or a vile debtor my just claims withstand, Deny his signet, and abjure his hand; Term after Term I wait, till months be past, And scarce obtain a hearing at the last. Ev'n when the hour is fix'd, a thousand stays Retard my suit, a thousand vague delays: The Cause is call'd, the witnesses attend, Chairs brought, and cushions laid—and there an end! Cæditius finds his cloak or gown too hot, And Fuscus slips aside to seek the pot; Thus, with our dearest hopes the judges sport, And when we rise to speak, dismiss the Court! But spear-and-shield-men may command the hour: The time to plead, is always in their power; Nor are their wealth and patience worn away, By the slow drag-chain of the law's delay. Add that the soldier, while his father lives, And he alone, his wealth bequeaths or gives; For what by pay is earn'd, by plunder won, The law declares, vests solely in the son. Coranus therefore sees his hoary sire, To gain his Will, by every art, aspire!— He rose by service; rank in fields obtain'd, And well deserved the fortune which he gain'd. And every prudent chief must, sure, desire, That still the worthiest should the most acquire; That those who merit, their rewards should have, Trappings, and chains, and all that decks the brave. THE SATIRES OF AULUS PERSIUS FLACCUS, TRANSLATED INTO ENGLISH VERSE. ? MIHI TRAMA FIGURÆ EST RELIQUA. TO THE RIGHT HONOURABLE ROBERT EARL GROSVENOR, VISCOUNT BELGRAVE, BARON GROSVENOR, THIS TRANSLATION OF PERSIUS IS INSCRIBED, AS A GRATEFUL AND AFFECTIONATE TESTIMONY OF RESPECT FOR THE LONG AND UNINTERRUPTED KINDNESS WITH WHICH HE HAS HONOURED THE TRANSLATOR, AND OF THE SINCEREST ADMIRATION OF HIS TALENTS AND VIRTUES. Oct. 1st, 1817. PROLOGUE. ['Twas never yet my luck, I ween] 'Twas never yet my luck, I ween, To drench my lips in Hippocrene; Nor, if I recollect aright, On the fork'd Hill to sleep a night, That I, like others of the trade, Might wake—a poet ready made! Thee, Helicon, with all the Nine, And pale Pyrene, I resign, Unenvied, to the tuneful race, Whose busts (of many a fane the grace) Sequacious ivy climbs, and spreads Unfading verdure round their heads. Enough for me, too mean for praise, To bear my rude, uncultured lays To Phœbus and the Muses' shrine, And place them near their gifts divine, Who bade the parrot ????? cry; And forced our language on the pie? The Belly: Master, He, of Arts, Bestower of ingenious parts; Powerful the creatures to endue With sounds their natures never knew! For, let the wily hand unfold The glittering bait of tempting gold, And straight the choir of daws and pies, To such poetick heights shall rise, That, lost in wonder, you will swear Apollo and the Nine are there! SATIRE I. Alas, for man! How vain are all his cares! And oh! what bubbles, his most grave affairs! Tush! who will read such trite—Heavens! this to me? Not one, by Jove. Not one? Well, two, or three; Or rather—none: a piteous case, in truth! Why piteous? lest Polydamas, forsooth, And Troy's proud dames, pronounce my merits fall, Beneath their Labeo's! I can bear it all. Nor should my friend, though still, as fashion sways, The purblind town conspire to sink or raise, Determine, as her wavering beam prevails, And trust his judgment to her coarser scales. O not abroad for vague opinion roam; The wise man's bosom is his proper home: And Rome is—What? Ah, might the truth be told!— And, sure it may, it must.—When I behold What fond pursuits have form'd our prime employ, Since first we dropt the play-things of the boy, To gray maturity, to this late hour, When every brow frowns with censorial power, Then, then—O yet suppress this carping mood. Impossible: I could not if I wou'd; For nature framed me of satyrick mould, And spleen, too petulant to be controll'd. Immured within our studies, we compose; Some, shackled metre; some, free-footed prose; But all, bombast: stuff, which the breast may strain, And the huge lungs puff forth with awkward pain. 'Tis done! and now the bard, elate and proud, Prepares a grand rehearsal for the crowd. Lo! he steps forth in birth-day splendour bright, Comb'd and perfumed, and robed in dazzling white; And mounts the desk; his pliant throat he clears, And deals, insidious, round his wanton leers: While Rome's first nobles, by the prelude wrought, Watch, with indecent glee, each prurient thought, And squeal with rapture, as the luscious line Thrills through the marrow, and inflames the chine. Vile dotard! Canst thou thus consent to please! To pandar for such itching fools as these! Fools,—whose applause must shoot beyond thy aim, And tinge thy cheek, bronzed as it is, with shame! But wherefore have I learn'd, if, thus represt, The leaven still must swell within my breast? If the wild fig-tree, deeply rooted there, Must never burst its bounds, and shoot in air? Are these the fruits of study! these, of age! O times, O manners!—Thou misjudging sage, Is science only useful as 'tis shown, And is thy knowledge nothing, if not known? “But, sure, 'tis pleasant, as we walk, to see The pointed finger, hear the loud That's He, On every side:—and seems it, in your sight, So poor a trifle, that whate'er we write, Is introduced to every school of note, And taught the youth of quality, by rote? —Nay, more! Our nobles, gorged, and swill'd with wine, Call, o'er the banquet, for a lay divine. Here one, on whom the princely purple glows, Snuffles some musty legend through his nose; Slowly distils Hypsipyle's sad fate, And love-lorn Phillis, dying for her mate, With what of woeful else, is said, or sung; And trips up every word, with lisping tongue. The maudlin audience, from the couches round, Hum their assent, responsive to the sound.— And are not now, the poet's ashes blest! Now lies the turf not lightly on his breast! They pause a moment—and again, the room Rings with his praise: now will not roses bloom, Now, from his reliques, will not violets spring, And o'er his hallow'd urn their fragrance fling! “You laugh ('tis answer'd,) and too freely here, Indulge that vile propensity to sneer. Lives there, who would not at applause rejoice, And merit, if he could, the publick voice? Who would not leave posterity such rhymes, As cedar oil might keep to latest times; Rhymes, which should fear no desperate grocer's hand, Nor fly with fish and spices through the land! Thou, my kind monitor, whoe'er thou art, Whom I suppose to play the opponent's part, Know—when I write, if chance some happier strain, (And chance it needs must be,) rewards my pain, Know, I can relish praise with genuine zest; Not mine the torpid, mine th' unfeeling breast: But that I merely toil for this acclaim, And make these eulogies my end and aim: I must not, cannot grant: for—sift them all, Mark well their value, and on what they fall: Are they not shower'd (to pass these trifles o'er) On Labeo's Iliad, drunk with hellebore? On princely love-lays drivell'd without thought, And the crude trash on citron couches wrought? You spread the table—'tis a master-stroke, And give the shivering guest a thread-bare cloke, Then, while his heart with gratitude dilates, At the glad vest, and the delicious cates, Tell me, you cry,—for truth is my delight, What says the Town of me, and what I write? He cannot:—he has neither ears nor eyes. But shall I tell you, who your bribes despise? —Bald trifler! cease at once your thriftless trade; That mountain paunch for verse was never made. O Janus, happiest of thy happy kind!— No waggish stork can peck at thee behind; No tongue thrust forth, expose to passing jeers; No twinkling fingers, perk'd like ass's ears, Point to the vulgar mirth:—but you, ye Great, To a blind occiput condemn'd by fate, Prevent, while yet you may, the rabble's glee, And tremble at the scoff you cannot see!— “What says the Town”—precisely what it ought: All you produce, sir, with such skill is wrought, That o'er the polish'd surface, far and wide, The critick nail without a jar, must glide; Since every verse is drawn as straight and fine, As if one eye had fix'd the ruddled line. —Whate'er the subject of his varied rhymes, The humours, passions, vices of the times; The pomp of nobles, barbarous pride of kings, All, all is great, and all inspired he sings! Lo! stripplings, scarcely from the ferule freed, And smarting yet from Greek, with headlong speed, Rush on heroicks; though devoid of skill To paint the rustling grove, or purling rill; Or praise the country, robed in cheerful green, Where hogs, and hearths, and ozier frails are seen, And happy hinds, who leap o'er smouldering hay, In honour, Pales, of thy sacred day. —Scenes of delight!—there Remus lived, and there, In grassy furrows, Quinctius tired his share; Quinctius, on whom his wife, with trembling haste, The dictatorial robes, exulting placed, Before his team; while homeward, with his plough, The lictors hurried—Good! a Homer, thou! There are, who hunt out antiquated lore; And never, but on musty authors, pore; These, Accius' jagg'd, and knotty lines engage, And those, Pacuvius' hard and horny page; Where, in quaint tropes, Antiopa is seen To—prop her dolorifick heart with teen! O, when you mark the sire, to judgment blind, Commend such models to the infant mind, Forbear to wonder whence this olio sprung, This sputtering jargon which infests our tongue; This scandal of the times, which shocks my ear, And which our knights bound from their seats to hear! How monstrous seems it, that we cannot plead, When call'd to answer for some felon deed, Nor danger from the trembling head repel, Without a wish for—Bravo! Vastly well! This Pedius is a thief, the accusers cry. You hear them, Pedius: now, for your reply? In terse antitheses he weighs the crime, Equals the pause, and balances the chime; And with such skill his flowery tropes employs, That the rapt audience scarce contain their joys. O charming! charming! he must sure prevail. This, charming! Can a Roman wag the tail? Were the wreck'd mariner to chaunt his woe, Should I, or sympathy, or alms bestow? Sing you, when, in that tablet on your breast, I see your story to the life exprest; A shatter'd bark, dash'd madly on the shore, And you, scarce floating, on a broken oar?— No, he must feel that would my pity share, And drop a natural, not a studied tear. But yet, our numbers boast a grace unknown To our rough sires, a smoothness all our own. True: the spruce metre in sweet cadence flows, And answering sounds a tuneful chime compose: Blue Nereus here, the Dolphin swift divides; And Idè there, sees Attin climb her sides: Nor this alone—for, in some happier line, We win the chine of the long Apennine! Arms and the man—Here, too, perhaps, you find, A pithless branch beneath a fungous rind? Not so;—a season'd trunk of many a day, Whose gross and watery parts are drawn away. But what, in fine, (for still you jeer me,) call For the moist eye, bow'd head, and lengthen'd drawl, What strains of genuine pathos? —O'er the hill The dismal slug-horn sounded, loud and shrill A Mimallonian blast: fired at the sound, In maddening groupes the Bacchants pour around, Mangle the haughty calf with gory hands, And scourge the indocile lynx with ivy wands; While Echo lengthens out the barbarous yell, And propagates the din from cell to cell! O were not every spark of manly sense, Of pristine vigour quench'd, or banish'd hence, Could this be borne! this cuckoo-spit of Rome, Which gathers round the lips in froth and foam! —The haughty calf, and Attin's jangling strain, Dropt, without effort, from the rheumy brain; No savour they of bleeding nails afford, Or desk, oft smitten for the happy word. But why must you, alone, displeased appear, And with harsh truths thus grate the tender ear? O yet beware! think of the closing gate! And dread the cold reception of the great: This currish humour you extend too far, While every word growls with that hateful gnar! Right! From this hour, (for now my fault I see,) All shall be charming—charming all, for me: What late seem'd base, already looks divine, And wonders start to view, in every line! 'Tis well, you cry: this spot let none defile, Or turn to purposes obscene and vile. Paint, then, two snakes entwined; and write around, Urine not, children, here; 'tis holy ground. Aw'd, I retire: and yet—when vice appear'd, Lucilius, o'er the town, his falchion rear'd; On Lupus, Mutius, pour'd his rage by name, And broke his grinders on their bleeding fame. And yet—arch Horace, while he strove to mend, Probed all the foibles of his smiling friend; Play'd lightly round and round the peccant part, And won, unfelt, an entrance to his heart: Well skill'd the follies of the crowd to trace, And sneer, with gay good humour in his face. And I!—I must not mutter? No; nor dare— Not to myself? No. To a ditch? Nowhere. Yes, here I'll dig—here, to sure trust confide The secret which I would, but cannot, hide. My darling book, a word;—“King Midas wears (These eyes beheld them, these!) such ass's ears!”— This quip of mine, which none must hear, or know, This fond conceit, which takes my fancy so, This nothing, if you will; you should not buy, With all those Iliads that you prize so high. But thou, whom Eupolis' impassion'd page, Hostile to vice, inflames with kindred rage, Whom bold Cratinus, and that awful sire, Force, as thou read'st, to tremble and admire; O, view my humbler labours:—there, if aught, More highly finish'd, more maturely wrought, Detain thy ear, and give thy breast to glow With warmth, responsive to the inspiring flow— I seek no further:—Far from me the rest, Yes, far the wretch, who, with a low-born jest, Can mock the blind for blindness, and pursue With vulgar ribaldry, the Grecian shoe: Bursting with self-conceit, with pride elate, Because, forsooth, in magisterial state, His worship (ædile of some paltry town,) Broke scanty weights, and put false measures down. Far too, be he—the monstrous witty fool, Who turns the numeral scale to ridicule; Derides the problems traced in dust or sand, And treads out all Geometry has plann'd— Who roars outright to see Nonaria seize, And tug the cynick's beard—To such as these, I recommend, at morn, the Prætor's bill, At eve, Calirrhoë, or—what they will. SATIRE II. TO PLOTIUS MACRINUS; (ON HIS BIRTH-DAY.) Health to my friend! and while my vows I pay, O mark, Macrinus, this auspicious day, Which, to your sum of years already flown, Adds yet another—with a whiter stone. Indulge your Genius, drench in wine your cares:— It is not yours, with mercenary prayers, To ask of Heaven what, you would die with shame, Unless you drew the gods aside, to name; While other great ones stand, with down-cast eyes, And, with a silent censer, tempt the skies!— Hard, hard the task, from the low, mutter'd prayer, To free the fanes; or find one suppliant there, Who dares to ask but what his state requires, And live to heaven and earth with known desires! Sound sense, integrity, a conscience clear, Are begg'd aloud, that all at hand may hear: But prayers like these (half-whisper'd, half supprest) The tongue scarce hazards from the conscious breast: O that I could my rich old uncle see, In funeral pomp!—O, that some deity, To pots of buried gold would guide my share! O, that my ward, whom I succeed as heir, Were once at rest! poor child, he lives in pain, And death to him must be accounted gain.— By wedlock, thrice has Nerius swell'd his store, And now—is he a widower once more! These blessings, with due sanctity, to crave, Once, twice and thrice in Tiber's eddying wave He dips each morn, and bids the stream convey The gather'd evils of the night, away! One question, friend:—an easy one, in fine— What are thy thoughts of Jove? My thoughts! Yes; thine. Wouldst thou prefer him to the herd of Rome? To any individual?—But, to whom? To Staius, for example. Heavens! a pause? Which of the two would best dispense the laws? Best shield th' unfriended orphan? Good! Now move The suit to Staius, late preferr'd to Jove:— “O Jove! good Jove!” he cries, o'erwhelm'd with shame, And must not Jove himself, O Jove! exclaim? Or dost thou think the impious wish forgiven, Because, when thunder shakes the vault of heaven, The bolt innoxious flies o'er thee and thine, To rend the forest oak, and mountain pine? —Because, yet livid from the lightning's scath, Thy smouldering corpse (a monument of wrath) Lies in no blasted grove, for publick care To expiate, with sacrifice and prayer; Must, therefore, Jove, unscepter'd and unfear'd, Give, to thy ruder mirth, his foolish beard? What bribe hast thou to win the Powers divine, Thus, to thy nod? The lungs and lights of swine Lo! from his little crib, the grandam hoar, Or aunt, well vers'd in superstitious lore, Snatches the babe; in lustral spittle dips Her middle finger, and anoints his lips, And forehead:—“Charms of potency,” she cries, “To break the influence of evil eyes!” The spell complete, she dandles high in air Her starveling Hope; and breathes a humble prayer, That heaven would only tender to his hands, All Crassus' houses, all Licinius' lands!— “Let every gazer by his charms be won, “And kings and queens aspire to call him son: “Contending virgins fly his smiles to meet, “And roses spring where'er he sets his feet!” Insane of soul—But I, O Jove, am free. Thou know'st, I trust no nurse with prayers for me: In mercy, then, reject each fond demand, Though, robed in white, she at thy altar stand. This begs for nerves to pain and sickness steel'd, A frame of body, that shall slowly yield To late old age:—'Tis well, enjoy thy wish.— But the huge platter, and high-season'd dish, Day after day, the willing gods withstand, And dash the blessing from their opening hand. That sues for wealth: the labouring ox is slain, And frequent victims woo the “god of gain.” “O crown my hearth with plenty and with peace, And give my flocks and herds a large increase!”— Madman! how can he, when, from day to day, Steer after steer, in offerings, melts away?— Still he persists; and still new hopes arise, With harslet and with tripe, to storm the skies. “Now swell my harvests! now my fields! now, now, “It comes—it comes—auspicious to my vow!” While thus, poor wretch, he hangs 'twixt hope and fear, He starts, in dreadful certainty, to hear His chest reverberate the hollow groan Of his last piece, to find itself alone! If from my side-board, I should bid you take Goblets of gold or silver, you would shake With eager rapture; drops of joy would start, And your left breast scarce hold your fluttering heart: Hence, you presume the gods are bought and sold; And overlay their busts with captured gold. For, of the brazen brotherhood, the Power Who sends you dreams, at morning's truer hour, Most purg'd from phlegm, enjoys your best regards, And a gold beard his prescient skill rewards! Now, from the temples, Gold has chased the plain, And frugal ware of Numa's pious reign; The ritual pots of brass are seen no more, And Vesta's pitchers blaze in burnish'd ore. O grovelling souls! and void of things divine! Why bring our passions to the Immortals' shrine, And judge, from what this carnal sense delights! Of what is pleasing in their purer sights?— This, the Calabrian fleece with purple soils, And mingles cassia with our native oils; Tears from the rocky conch its pearly store, And strains the metal from the glowing ore. This, this, indeed, is vicious; yet it tends To gladden life, perhaps; and boasts its ends; But you, ye priests, (for, sure, ye can,) unfold— In heavenly things, what boots this pomp of gold? No more, in truth, than dolls to Venus paid, (The toys of childhood,) by the riper maid! No; let me bring the Immortals, what the race Of great Messala, now depraved and base, On their huge charger, cannot;—bring a mind, Where legal and where moral sense are join'd, With the pure essence; holy thoughts, that dwell In the soul's most retired, and sacred cell; A bosom dyed in honour's noblest grain, Deep-dyed:—with these, let me approach the fane, And Heaven will hear the humble prayer I make, Though all my offering be a barley cake. SATIRE III. What! ever thus? See! while the beams of day, In broad effulgence, o'er the shutters play, Stream through the crevice, widen on the walls, On the fifth line the gnomon's shadow falls! Yet still you sleep, like one that, stretch'd supine, Snores off the fumes of strong Falernian wine. Up! up! mad Sirius parches every blade, And flocks and herds lie panting in the shade. Here my youth rouses, rubs his heavy eyes, “Is it so late? so very late?” he cries; “Shame, shame! Who waits? Who waits there? quick, my page! Why, when!” His bile o'erflows; he foams with rage, And brays so loudly, that you start in fear, And fancy all Arcadia at your ear. Behold him, with his bedgown and his books, His pens and paper, and his studious looks, Intent and earnest! What arrests his speed, Alas! the viscous liquid clogs the reed. Dilute it. Pish! now every word I write Sinks through the paper, and eludes the sight: Now the pen leaves no mark, the point's too fine; Now 'tis too blunt, and doubles every line! O wretch! whom every day more wretched sees— Are these the fruits of all your studies? these! Give o'er at once: and like some callow dove, Some prince's heir, some lady's infant love, Call for chew'd pap; and, pouting at the breast, Scream at the lullaby that woos to rest! “But why such warmth? See what a pen! nay, see!”— And is this subterfuge employed on me? Fond boy! your time, with your pretext, is lost; And all your arts are at your proper cost. While with occasion thus you madly play, Your best of life unheeded leaks away, And scorn flows in apace: the ill-baked ware, Rung by the potter, will its fault declare; Thus—But you yet are moist and yielding clay: Call for some plastic hand without delay, Nor cease the labour, till the wheel produce A vessel nicely form'd, and fit for use. “But wherefore this? My father, thanks to fate, Left me a fair, if not a large, estate:— A salt unsullied on my table shines, And due oblations, in their little shrines, My household gods receive; my hearth is pure, And all my means of life confirm'd, and sure: What need I more”? Nay, nothing; it is well. —And it becomes you, too, with pride to swell, Because, the thousandth in descent, you trace Your blood, unmix'd, from some high Tuscan race; Or, when the knights march by the censor's chair, In annual pomp, can greet a kinsman there! Away! these trappings to the rabble show: Me, they deceive not; for your soul I know, Within, without.—And blush you not to see, Loose Natta's life and yours so well agree? —But Natta's is not life: the sleep of sin Has seiz'd his powers, and palsied all within; Huge cawls of fat envelope every part, And torpor weighs on his insensate heart: Absolv'd from blame by ignorance so gross, He neither sees, nor comprehends his loss; Content in guilt's profound abyss to drop, Nor, struggling, send one bubble to the top! Dread sire of Gods! when lust's envenom'd stings Stir the fierce natures of tyrannick kings; When storms of rage within their bosoms roll, And call, in thunder, for thy just control, O, then relax the bolt, suspend the blow, And thus and thus alone, thy vengeance show, In all her charms, set Virtue in their eye, And let them see their loss, despair, and—die! Say, could the wretch severer tortures feel, Closed in the brazen bull?—Could the bright steel, That, while the board with regal pomp was spread, Gleam'd o'er the guest, suspended by a thread, Worse pangs inflict, than he endures, who cries, (As, on the rack of conscious guilt, he lies, In mental agony,) “Alas! I fall, Down, down the unfathom'd steep, without recal!” And withers at the heart, and dares not show His bosom wife the secret of his woe! Oft (I remember yet,) my sight to spoil, Oft, when a boy, I blear'd my eyes with oil, What time I wish'd my studies to decline, Nor make great Cato's dying speeches mine; Speeches, my master to the skies had raised, Poor pedagogue! unknowing what he praised; And which my sire, suspense 'twixt hope and fear, With venial pride, had brought his friends to hear. For then alas! 'twas my supreme delight To study chances, and compute aright, What sum the lucky sice would yield in play, And what the fatal aces sweep away: Anxious, no rival candidate for fame Should hit the long-neck'd jar with nicer aim; Nor, while the whirling top beguiled the eye, With happier skill the sounding scourge apply. But you have pass'd the schools; have studied long, And learn'd the eternal bounds of Right and Wrong, And what the Porch, (by Mycon limn'd, of yore, With trowser'd Medes,) unfolds of ethick lore, Where the shorn youth, on herbs and pottage fed, Bend, o'er the midnight page, the sleepless head: And, sure, the letter where, divergent wide, The Samian branches shoot, on either side, Has to your view, with no obscure display, Mark'd, on the right, the strait but better way. And yet you slumber still! and still opprest, With last night's revels, knock your head and breast! And, stretching o'er your drowsy couch, produce Yawn after yawn, as if your jaws were loose! Is there no certain mark, at which to aim?— Still must your bow be bent at casual game? With clods, and potsherds, must you still pursue, Each wandering crow that chance presents to view; And, careless of your life's contracted span, Live from the moment, and without a plan? When bloated dropsies every limb invade, In vain to hellebore you fly for aid: Meet, with preventive skill, the young disease, And Craterus will boast no golden fees. Mount, hapless youths, on Contemplation's wings, And mark the Causes and the End of things:— Learn what we are, and for what purpose born, What station here 'tis given us to adorn; How best to blend security with ease, And win our way through life's tempestuous seas; What bounds the love of property requires, And what to wish, with unreprov'd desires: How far the genuine use of wealth extends; And the just claims of country, kindred, friends; What Heaven would have us be, and where our stand, In this Great Whole, is fix'd by high command. Learn these—and envy not the sordid gains, Which recompense the well-tongued lawyer's pains; Though Umbrian rusticks, for his sage advice, Pour in their jars of fish, and oil, and spice, So thick and fast, that, ere the first be o'er, A second, and a third, are at the door. But here, some brother of the blade, some coarse And shag-hair'd captain, bellows loud and hoarse; “Away with this cramp, philosophick stuff! My learning serves my turn, and that's enough. I laugh at all your dismal Solons, I; Who stalk with downcast looks, and heads awry, Muttering within themselves, where'er they roam, And churning their mad silence, till it foam! Who mope o'er sick men's dreams, howe'er absurd, And on protruded lips poise every word; Nothing can come from nothing. Apt and plain! Nothing return to nothing. Good, again! And this it is, for which they peak and pine This precious stuff, for which they never dine!” Jove, how he laughs! the brawny youths around, Catch the contagion, and return the sound; Convulsive mirth on every cheek appears, And every nose is wrinkled into sneers! “Doctor, a patient said, employ your art, I feel a strange wild fluttering at the heart; My breast seems tighten'd, and a fetid smell Affects my breath,—feel here; all is not well.” Med'cine and rest the fever's rage compose, And the third day, his blood more calmly flows. The fourth, unable to contain, he sends A hasty message to his wealthier friends, And just about to bathe—requests, in fine, A moderate flask of old Surrentin wine. “Good heavens! my friend, what sallow looks are here?” Pshaw, nonsense! nothing! “Yet 'tis worth your fear, Whate'er it be: the waters rise within, And, though unfelt, distend your sickly skin.” —And yours still more! Whence springs this freedom, tro'? Are you, forsooth, my guardian? Long ago I buried him; and thought my nonage o'er: But you remain to school me! “Sir, no more.”— Now to the bath, full gorged with luscious fare, See the pale wretch his bloated carcase bear; While from his lungs, that faintly play by fits, His gasping throat sulphureous steam emits!— Cold shiverings seize him, as for wine he calls, His grasp betrays him, and the goblet falls! From his loose teeth, the lip, convuls'd, withdraws, And the rich cates drop through his listless jaws. Then trumpets, torches come, in solemn state; And my fine youth, so confident of late, Stretch'd on a splendid bier, and essenced o'er, Lies, a stiff corpse, heels foremost at the door. Romans of yesterday, with cover'd head, Shoulder him to the pyre, and—all is said! “But why to me? Examine every part; My pulse:—and lay your finger on my heart; You'll find no fever: touch my hands and feet, A natural warmth, and nothing more, you'll meet.” 'Tis well! But if you light on gold by chance, If a fair neighbour cast a sidelong glance, Still will that pulse with equal calmness flow, And still that heart no fiercer throbbings know? Try yet again. In a brown dish behold, Coarse gritty bread, and coleworts stale and old: Now, prove your taste. Why those averted eyes? Hah! I perceive:—a secret ulcer lies Within that pamper'd mouth, too sore to bear Th' untender grating of plebeian fare! Where dwells this natural warmth, when danger's near, And “each particular hair” starts up with fear? Or where resides it, when vindictive ire Inflames the bosom; when the veins run fire, The reddening eye-balls glare; and all you say, And all you do, a mind so warp'd betray, That mad Orestes, if the freaks he saw, Would give you up at once, to chains and straw! SATIRE IV. What! you, my Alcibiades, aspire To sway the state!—(Suppose that bearded sire, Whom hemlock from a guilty world remov'd, Thus to address the stripling that he lov'd.)— On what apt talents for a charge so high, Ward of great Pericles, do you rely? Forecast on others by gray hairs conferr'd, Haply, with you, anticipates the beard! And prompts you, prescient of the public weal, Now to disclose your thoughts, and now conceal! Hence, when the rabble form some daring plan, And factious murmurs spread from man to man, Mute and attentive you can bid them stand, By the majestick wafture of your hand! Lo! all is hush'd: what now, what will he speak, What floods of sense from his charg'd bosom break! “Romans! I think—I fear—I think, I say, This is not well:—perhaps, the better way.”— O power of eloquence! But you, forsooth, In the nice, trembling scale can poise the truth, With even hand; can with intentive view, Amidst deflecting curves, the right pursue; Or, where the rule deceives the vulgar eye With its warp'd foot, th' unerring line apply: And, while your sentence strikes with doom precise, Stamp the black Theta on the front of vice! Rash youth! relying on a specious skin, While all is dark deformity within, Check the fond thought; nor, like the peacock proud, Spread your gay plumage to the applauding crowd, Before your hour arrive:—Ah, rather drain Whole isles of hellebore, to cool your brain! For, what is your chief good? “To heap my board With every dainty earth and sea afford; To bathe, and bask me in the sunny ray, And doze the careless hours of life away.”— Hold, hold! yon tatter'd beldame, hobbling by, If haply ask'd, would make the same reply. “But I am nobly born.” Agreed. “And fair.” 'Tis granted too: yet goody Baucis there, Who, to the looser slaves, her pot-herbs cries, Is just as philosophick, just as wise.— How few, alas! their proper faults explore! While, on his loaded back, who walks before, Each eye is fix'd,—You touch a stranger's arm, And ask him, if he knows Vectidius' farm? “Whose,” he replies? That rich old chuff's, whose ground Would tire a hawk to wheel it fairly round. “O, ho! that wretch, on whose devoted head, Ill stars and angry gods their rage have shed! Who, on high festivals, when all is glee, And the loose yoke hangs on the cross-way tree, As, from the jar, he scrapes the incrusted clay, Groans o'er the revels of so dear a day; Champs on a coated onion dipt in brine; And, while his hungry hinds, exulting dine On barley-broth, sucks up, with thrifty care, The mothery dregs of his pall'd vinegar!” But, if “you bask you in the sunny ray, And doze the careless hours of youth away,” There are, who at such gross delights will spurn, And spit their venom on your life, in turn; Expose, with eager hate, your low desires, Your secret passions, and unhallow'd fires.— “Why, while the beard is nurst with every art, Those anxious pains to bare the shameful part? In vain:—should five athletick knaves essay, To pluck, with ceaseless care, the weeds away, Still the rank fern, congenial to the soil, Would spread luxuriant, and defeat their toil!” Misled by rage, our bodies we expose, And while we give, forget to ward, the blows; This, this is life! and thus our faults are shown, By mutual spleen: we know—and we are known! But your defects elude inquiring eyes!— Beneath the groin the ulcerous evil lies, Impervious to the view; and o'er the wound, The broad effulgence of the zone is bound! But can you, thus, the inward pang restrain, Thus, cheat the sense of languor and of pain? “But if the people call me wise and just, Sure, I may take the general voice on trust!”— No:—If you tremble at the sight of gold; Indulge lust's wildest sallies uncontroll'd; Or, bent on outrage, at the midnight hour, Girt with a ruffian band, the Forum scour; Then, wretch! in vain the voice of praise you hear, And drink the vulgar shout with greedy ear. Hence, with your spurious claims! Rejudge your cause, And fling the rabble back their vile applause: To your own breast, in quest of worth, repair, And blush to find how poor a stock is there! SATIRE V. TO ANNÆUS CORNUTUS. PERSIUS. Poets are wont a hundred mouths to ask, A hundred tongues,—whate'er the purposed task; Whether a Tragick tale of Pelops' line For the sad actor, with deep-mouth, to whine; Or Epick lay;—the Parthian wing'd with fear, And wrenching from his groin the Roman spear. CORNUTUS. Heavens! to what purpose, (sure, I heard thee wrong,) Tend those huge gobbets of robustious song, Which, struggling into day, distend thy lungs, And need a hundred mouths, a hundred tongues? Let fustian bards to Helicon repair, And suck the spungy fogs that hover there, Bards, in whose fervid brains, while sense recoils, The pot of Progne, or Thyestes boils, Dull Glyco's feast!—But what canst thou propose? Puff'd by thy heaving lungs no metal glows; Nor dost thou, mumbling o'er some close-pent strain, Croak the grave nothings of an idle brain; Nor swell, until thy cheeks, with thundering sound Displode, and spirt their airy froth around. Confined to common life, thy numbers flow, And neither soar too high, nor sink too low: There strength and ease in graceful union meet, Though polish'd, subtle, and though poignant, sweet; Yet powerful to abash the front of crime, And crimson errour's cheek, with sportive rhyme. O still be this thy study, this thy care: Leave to Mycenæ's prince his horrid fare, His head and feet; and seek, with Roman taste, For Roman food—a plain but pure repast. Persius. Mistake me not. Far other thoughts engage My mind, Cornutus, than to swell my page With air-blown trifles, impotent and vain, And grace, with noisy pomp, an empty strain. Oh, no: the world shut out, 'tis my design, To open (prompted by the inspiring Nine) The close recesses of my breast, and bare To your keen eye, each thought, each feeling, there; Yes, best of friends! 'tis now my wish to prove, How much you fill my heart, engross my love. Ring then—for, to your practised ear, the sound Will shew the solid, and where guile is found Beneath the varnish'd tongue: for this, in fine, I dared to wish an hundred voices mine; Proud to declare, in language void of art, How deep your form is rooted in my heart, And paint, in words,—ah, could they paint the whole,— The ineffable sensations of my soul. When first I laid the purple by, and free, Yet trembling at my new-felt liberty, Approach'd the hearth, and on the Lares hung The bulla, from my willing neck unstrung; When gay associates, sporting at my side, And the white boss, display'd with conscious pride, Gave me, uncheck'd, the haunts of vice to trace, And throw my wandering eyes on every face, When life's perplexing maze before me lay, And error, heedless of the better way, To straggling paths, far from the route of truth, Woo'd, with blind confidence, my timorous youth, I fled to you, Cornutus, pleased to rest My hopes and fears on your Socratick breast, Nor did you, gentle Sage, the charge decline: Then, dextrous to beguile, your steady line Reclaim'd, I know not by what winning force, My morals, warp'd from virtue's straighter course; While reason press'd incumbent on my soul, That struggled to receive the strong control, And took like wax, temper'd by plastick skill, The form your hand imposed; and bears it still! Can I forget, how many a summer's day, Spent in your converse, stole, unmark'd, away? Or how, while listening with increas'd delight, I snatch'd from feasts, the earlier hours of night? —One time (for to your bosom still I grew) One time of study, and of rest, we knew; One frugal board where, every care resign'd, An hour of blameless mirth relax'd the mind. And sure our lives, which thus accordant move, (Indulge me here, Cornutus,) clearly prove, That both are subject to the self-same law, And from one horoscope their fortunes draw; And whether Destiny's unerring doom, In equal Libra, poised our days to come; Or friendship's holy hour our fates combined, And to the Twins, a sacred charge assign'd; Or Jove, benignant, broke the gloomy spell By angry Saturn wove;—I know not well— But sure some star there is, whose bland controul, Subdues, to yours, the temper of my soul! Countless the various species of mankind, Countless the shades which separate mind from mind; No general object of desire is known; Each has his will, and each pursues his own: With Latian wares, one roams the Eastern main, To purchase spice, and cummin's blanching grain; Another, gorged with dainties, swill'd with wine, Fattens in sloth, and snores out life, supine; This loves the Campus; that, destructive play; And those, in wanton dalliance, melt away:— But when the knotty gout their strength has broke, And their dry joints crack like some wither'd oak, Then they look back, confounded and aghast, On the gross days in fogs and vapours past; With late regret the waste of life deplore, No purpose gain'd, and time, alas! no more. But you, my friend, whom nobler views delight, To pallid vigils give the studious night; Cleanse youthful breasts from every noxious weed, And sow the tilth with Cleanthean seed. There seek, ye young, ye old, secure to find That certain end, which stays the wavering mind; Stores, which endure, when other means decay, Through life's last stage, a sad and cheerless way. “Right; and to-morrow this shall be our care.” Alas! to-morrow, like to-day, will fare. “What! is one day, forsooth, so great a boon?” But when it comes, (and come it will too soon,) Reflect, that yesterday's to-morrow's o'er.— Thus “one to-morrow! one to-morrow! more,” Have seen long years before them fade away; And still appear no nearer than to-day! So while the wheels on different axles roll, In vain, (though govern'd by the self-same pole,) The hindmost to o'ertake the foremost tries; Fast as the one pursues, the other flies! Freedom, in truth, it steads us much to have: Not that, by which each manumitted slave, Each Publius, with his tally, may obtain A casual dole of coarse and damaged grain. —O souls! involv'd in Error's thickest shade, Who think a Roman with one turn is made! Look on this paltry groom, this Dama here, Who, at three farthings, would be prized too dear; This blear-eyed scoundrel, who your husks would steal, And outface truth to hide the starving meal; Yet—let his master twirl this knave about, And Marcus Dama, in a trice, steps out! Amazing! Marcus surety?—yet distrust! Marcus your judge?—yet fear a doom unjust! Marcus avouch it?—then the fact is clear. The writings!—set your hand, good Marcus, here.” This is mere liberty,—a name, alone: Yet this is all the cap can make our own. “Sure, there's no other. All mankind agree, That those who live without controul, are free: I live without controul; and therefore hold Myself more free, than Brutus was, of old. Absurdly put; a Stoick cries, whose ear, Rins'd with sharp vinegar, is quick to hear: True;—all who live without controul are free; But that you live so, I can ne'er agree. “No? From the Prætor's wand when I withdrew, Lord of myself, why, might I not pursue My pleasure unrestrain'd, respect still had, To what the rubrick of the law forbad?” Listen,—but first your brows from anger clear, And bid your nose dismiss that rising sneer; Listen, while I the genuine truth impart, And root those old-wives' fables from your heart. It was not, is not in the “Prætor's wand,” To gift a fool with power, to understand The nicer shades of duty, and educe, From short and rapid life, its end and use: The labouring hind shall sooner seize the quill, And strike the lyre with all a master's skill. Reason condemns the thought, with mien severe, And drops this maxim in the secret ear, “Forbear to venture, with preposterous toil, On what, in venturing, you are sure to spoil.” In this plain sense of what is just and right, The laws of nature and of man unite; That Inexperience should some caution show, And spare to reach, at what she does not know. Prescribe you hellebore! without the skill, To weigh the ingredients, or compound the pill?— Physick, alarm'd, the rash attempt withstands, And wrests the dangerous mixture from your hands. Should the rude clown, skill'd in no star to guide His dubious course, rush on the trackless tide, Would not Palemon at the fact exclaim, And swear the world had lost all sense of shame! Say, is it your's, by wisdom's steady rays, To walk secure, through life's entangled maze? Your's, to discern the specious from the true, And where the gilt conceals the brass from view? Speak, can you mark, with some appropriate sign, What to pursue, and what, in turn, decline? Does moderation all your wishes guide, And temperance at your cheerful board preside? Do friends your love experience? are your stores, Now dealt with closed and now with open doors, As fit occasion calls? Can you restrain The eager appetite of sordid gain; Nor feel, when, in the mire, a doit you note, Mercurial spittle gurgle in your throat? If you can say, and truly, “These are mine, And This I can:”—suffice it. I decline All further question; you are Wise and Free, No less by Jove's, than by the Law's decree. But if, good Marcus, you, who form'd so late, One of our batch, of our enslaved estate, Beneath a specious outside, still retain The foul contagion of your ancient strain; If the sly fox still burrow in some part, Some secret corner, of your tainted heart; I straight retract the freedom which I gave, And hold you Dama still, and still a slave! Reason concedes you nothing. Let us try. Thrust forth your finger. “See.” O, heavens, awry! Yet what so trifling?—But, though altars smoke, Though clouds of incense every god invoke, In vain you sue, one drachm of right to find, One scruple, lurking in the foolish mind. Nature abhors the mixture: the rude clown, As well may lay his spade and mattock down, And with light foot, and agile limbs prepare To dance three steps with soft Bathyllus' air! “Still I am free.” You! subject to the sway Of countless masters, free! What datum, pray, Supports your claim? Is there no other yoke, Than that which, from your neck, the Prætor broke!— “Go, bear these scrapers to the bath with speed; What! loitering, knave?”—Here's servitude, indeed! Yet you unmov'd the angry sounds would hear; You owe no duty, and can know no fear. But if, within, you feel the strong controul— If stormy passions lord it o'er your soul, Are you more free, than he whom threat'nings urge, To bear the strigils, and escape the scourge? 'Tis morn; yet sunk in sloth, you snoring lie. “Up! up!” cries Avarice, “and to business hie; Nay, stir.” I will not. Still she presses, “Rise!” I cannot. “But you must and shall,” she cries. And to what purpose? “This a question! Go, Bear fish to Pontus, and bring wines from Co; Bring ebon, flax, whate'er the East supplies, Musk for perfumes, and gums for sacrifice: Prevent the mart, and the first pepper take From the tired camel, ere his thirst he slake. Traffick, forswear, if interest intervene”— But Jove will over-hear me.—“Hold, my spleen! O dolt! but, mark—that thumb will bore and bore The empty salt, (scraped to the quick before,) For one poor grain, a vapid meal to mend, If you aspire to thrive with Jove your friend!” You rouse, (for who can truths like these withstand?) Victual your slaves, and urge them to the strand. Prepared, in haste, to follow; and, ere now, Had to the Ægean turn'd your vent'rous prow, But that sly Luxury the process eyed, Waylaid your desperate steps, and, taunting, cried, “Ho, madman! whither, in this hasty plight? What passion drives you forth? what furies fright? Whole urns of hellebore might hope, in vain, To cool this high-wrought fever of the brain. What! quit your peaceful couch, renounce your ease, To rush on hardships, and to dare the seas! And, while a broken plank supports your meat, And a coil'd cable proves your softest seat, Suck from squab jugs that pitchy scents exhale, The seaman's beverage, sour at once and stale! And all, for what? that sums, which now are lent At modest five, may sweat out twelve per cent.!— O rather cultivate the joys of sense, And crop the sweets which youth and health dispense; Give the light hours to banquets, love, and wine: These are the zest of life, and these are mine! Dust, and a shade are all you soon must be: Live, then, while yet you may. Time presses.—See! Even while I speak, the present is become The past, and lessens still life's little sum.” Now, sir, decide; shall this, or that, command? Alas! the bait, display'd on either hand, Distracts your choice:—but, ponder as you may, Of this be sure; both, with alternate sway, Will lord it o'er you, while, with slavish fears, From side to side your doubtful duty veers. Nor must you, though in some auspicious hour, You spurn their mandate, and resist their power, At once conclude their future influence vain:— With struggling hard the dog may snap his chain; Yet little freedom from the effort find, If, as he flies, he trails its length behind. “Yes, I am fix'd; to Love a long adieu!— Nay, smile not, Davus; you will find it true.” So, while his nails, gnawn to the quick, yet bled, The sage Chærestratus, deep-musing, said.— “Shall I my virtuous ancestry defame, Consume my fortune, and disgrace my name, While, at a harlot's wanton threshold laid, Darkling, I whine my drunken serenade!” 'Tis nobly spoken:—Let a lamb be brought To the Twin Powers that this deliv'rance wrought. “But—if I quit her, will she not complain? Will she not grieve? Good Davus, think again.” Fond trifler! you will find her “grief” too late; When the red slipper rattles round your pate, Vindictive of the mad attempt to foil Her potent spell, and all-involving toil. Dismiss'd you storm and bluster: hark! she calls, And, at the word, your boasted manhood falls. “Mark, Davus; of her own accord, she sues! Mark, she invites me! Can I now refuse? Yes Now, and Ever. If you left her door, Whole and intire, you must return no more. Right. This is He, the man whom I demand; This, Davus; not the creature of a wand Waved by some foolish lictor.— And is he, This master of himself, this truly free, Who marks the dazzling lure Ambition spreads, And headlong follows where the meteor leads? “Watch the nice hour, and, on the scrambling tribes, Pour, without stint, your mercenary bribes, Vetches and pulse; that, many a year gone by, Greybeards, as basking in the sun they lie, May boast how much your Floral Games surpast, In cost and splendor, those they witness'd last!” A glorious motive! And on Herod's day, When every room is deck'd in meet array, And lamps along the greasy windows spread, Profuse of flowers, gross, oily vapours shed; When the vast tunny's tail in pickle swims, And the crude must foams o'er the pitcher's brims; You mutter secret prayers, by fear devised, And dread the sabbaths of the circumcised! Then, a crack'd egg-shell fills you with affright, And ghosts and goblins haunt your sleepless night. Last, the blind priestess, with her sistrum shrill, And Galli, huge and high, a dread instill Of gods, prepared to vex the human frame With dropsies, palsies, ills of every name, Unless the trembling victim champ, in bed, Thrice every morn, on a charm'd garlick-head, Preach to the martial throng these lofty strains, And lo! some chief more famed for bulk than brains, Some vast Vulfenius, bless'd with lungs of brass, Laughs loud and long at the scholastick ass; And, for a clipt cent-piece, sets, by the tale, A hundred Greek philosophers to sale! SATIRE VI. TO CÆSIUS BASSUS. Say, have the wintry storms, which round us beat, Chased thee, my Bassus, to thy Sabine seat? Does musick there thy sacred leisure fill, While the strings quicken to thy manly quill?— O skill'd, in matchless numbers, to disclose How first from Night this fair creation rose; And kindling, as the lofty themes inspire, To smite, with daring hand, the Latian lyre! Anon, with youth and youth's delights to toy, And give the dancing chords to love and joy; Or wake, with moral touch, to accents sage, And hymn the heroes of a nobler age! To me, while tempests howl and billows rise, Liguria's coast a warm retreat supplies, Where the huge cliffs an ample front display, And, deep within, recedes the sheltering bay. The Port of Luna, friends, is worth your note— So, in his sober moments, Ennius wrote, When, all his dreams of transmigration past, He found himself plain Quintus, at the last! Here to repose I give the cheerful day, Careless of what the vulgar think or say; Or what the South, from Africk's burning air, Unfriendly to the fold, may haply bear: And careless still, though richer herbage crown My neighbours' fields, or heavier crops embrown. —Nor, Bassus, though capricious Fortune grace, Thus, with her smiles, a low-bred, low-born race, Will e'er thy friend, for that, let Envy plough One careful furrow on his open brow; Give crooked age upon his youth to steal, Defraud his table of one generous meal; Or, stooping o'er the dregs of mothery wine, Touch, with suspicious nose, the sacred sign. But inclinations vary:—and the Power That beams, ascendant, on the natal hour, Even Twins produces of discordant souls, And tempers, wide asunder as the poles. The One, on birth-days, and on those alone, Prepares (but with a forecast all his own) On tunny-pickle, from the shops, to dine, And dips his wither'd pot-herbs in the brine; Trembles the pepper from his hands to trust, And sprinkles, grain by grain, the sacred dust. The Other, large of soul, exhausts his hoard, While yet a stripling, at the festive board. To use my fortune, Bassus, I intend: Nor, therefore, deem me so profuse, my friend, So prodigally vain, as to afford, The costly turbot, for my freedmen's board; Or so expert in flavours, as to show How, by the relish, thrush from thrush I know. “Live to your means”—'tis wisdom's voice you hear— And freely grind the produce of the year: What scruples check you? Ply the hoe and spade, And lo! another crop is in the blade. True; but the claims of duty caution crave. A friend, scarce rescued from the Ionian wave, Grasps a projecting rock, while, in the deep, His treasures, with his prayers, unheeded sleep: I see him stretch'd, desponding, on the ground, His tutelary gods all wreck'd around, His bark dispers'd in fragments o'er the tide, And sea-mews sporting on the ruins wide. Sell, then, a pittance ('tis my prompt advice,) Of this your land, and send your friend the price; Lest, with a pictured storm, forlorn and poor, He ask cheap charity, from door to door. “But then, my angry heir, displeased to find His prospects lessen'd by an act so kind, May slight my obsequies; and, in return, Give my cold ashes to a scentless urn; Reckless what vapid drugs he flings thereon, Adulterate cassia, or dead cinnamon!— Can I (bethink in time) my means impair, And, with impunity, provoke my heir? —Here Bestius rails—“A plague on Greece,” he cries, “And all her pedants!—there the evil lies; For since their mawkish, their enervate lore, With dates and pepper, curs'd our luckless shore, Luxury has tainted all; and ploughmen spoil Their wholesome barley-broth with luscious oil.” Heavens! can you stretch (to fears like these a slave) Your fond solicitude beyond the grave? Away!— But thou, my heir, whoe'er thou art, Step from the crowd, and let us talk apart. Hear'st thou the news? Cæsar has won the day, (So, from the camp, his laurell'd missives say,) And Germany is ours! The city wakes, And from her altars the cold ashes shakes.— Lo! from the imperial spoils, Cæsonia brings Arms, and the martial robes of conquer'd kings, To deck the temples; while, on either hand, Chariots of war, and bulky captives stand, In long array. I, too, my joy to prove, Will to the emperor's Genius, and to Jove, Devote, in gratitude, for deeds so rare, Two hundred well-match'd fencers, pair by pair. Who blames—who ventures to forbid me? You? Woe to your future prospects! if you do. —And, sir, not this alone; for I have vow'd A supplemental largess, to the crowd, Of corn and oil. What! muttering still? draw near, And speak aloud, for once, that I may hear. “My means are not so low, that I should care For that poor pittance, your may leave your heir.” Just as you please: but were I, sir, bereft Of all my kin; no aunt, no uncle left; No nephew, niece; were all my cousins gone, And all my cousins' cousins, every one, Aricia soon some Manius would supply, Well pleased to take that “pittance,” when I die. “Manius! a beggar of the first degree, A son of earth, your heir!” Nay, question me, Ask who my grandsire's sire? I know not well, And yet, on recollection, I might tell; But urge me one step further—I am mute: A son of earth, like Manius, past dispute. Thus, his descent and mine are equal prov'd, And we at last are cousins, though remov'd. But why should you, who still before me run, Require my torch, ere yet the race be won? Think me your Mercury: Lo! here I stand, As painters represent him, purse in hand: Will you, or not, the proffer'd boon receive, And take, with thankfulness, whate'er I leave? Something, you murmur, of the heap is spent. True: as occasion call'd, it freely went; In life 'twas mine: but death your chance secures, And what remains, or more, or less, is yours. Of Tadius' legacy no questions raise, Nor turn upon me with a grandsire-phrase, “Live on the interest of your fortune, boy; To touch the principal, is to destroy.” “What, after all, may I expect to have?” Expect!—Pour oil upon my viands, slave, Pour with unsparing hand! shall my best cheer, On high and solemn days, be the singed ear Of some tough, smoke-dried hog, with nettles drest; That your descendant, while in earth I rest, May gorge on dainties, and, when lust excites, Give, to patrician beds, his wasteful nights? Shall I, a napless figure, pale and thin, Glide by, transparent, in a parchment skin, That he may strut with more than priestly pride, And swag his portly paunch from side to side? Go, truck your soul for gain! buy, sell, exchange; From pole to pole, in quest of profit range. Let none more shrewdly play the factor's part; None bring his slaves more timely to the mart; Puff them with happier skill, as caged they stand, Or clap their well-fed sides with nicer hand. Double your fortune—treble it—yet more— 'Tis four, six, ten-fold what it was before: O bound the heap—You, who could yours confine, Tell me, Chrysippus, how to limit mine!</field>
