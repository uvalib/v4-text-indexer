      <field name="fulltext">COUNTRY PHILOSOPHY. WILLIAM AND JAMES. WILLIAM. Good morrow, neighbour, 'tis a tuneful morning: The birds have jump'd into their singing gear Most suddenly, and spring, before our thought, Comes with the wheatear on the fallow side. JAMES. I told my wife that I should find you here On the first blackbird's whistle, and I came And here I find you: let us chat an hour: This is no busy season to our handsâ Time to look round, and little else to do But breathe sound air and broaden like green corn. What power this March sun shakes upon our path. WILLIAM. Lean on this boundary hedgerow of our farms. We are near enough for talking: I can watch My beasts at graze, and you can count your stacks, Your feet upon your holding, mine on mine. JAMES. William, I think I've slipped a score of years Since yesternight: this touch of frost has given A spice and savour to the calm serene, And makes the sunshine burnish on the hedge, Or 'tis my fancy. I'm as fanciful This morning as a youngster of eighteenâ There goes one: listen, down the lane, to the right: He whistles, now he sings by breaks, âFair lips Whom are ye for, if ye are not for me?â WILLIAM. This hawthorn bird is out before the buds That feed him; for the thorny twigs are bare That nurture up their blossoms near the tread Of feet that pause not earthwards for delight, When blooms of may shower on the clasping hands, Or blind those eyes from forward-searching care. JAMES. Why, friend, you have that from some book of songs. WILLIAM. Not I; the air's to blame; if some old thrush In spring forgets his hoarseness into song. I shall be mute enough by harvest week, With other occupation than at ease To lounge and pipe a careless flourish here. JAMES. Each month has office in the farmer's year, And chief in this I count our calling best, That nature's scope and change are all our own, And so we cannot lack variety. See yonder townsman in his warehouse walls: What change, except in his thermometer, With wet or burning pavement, marks his days Or notes the deeper year; and gives him rest From that eternal simper at his wares When customers bite briskly? He shall see, From zero to the dog-day weather-point, One patch of sky. WILLIAM. And yet this very man Secure in his importance, holds us cheap As bumpkins, speaking broad, with swollen hands, And counts his apeish mincings as the trick Of true gentility, âwhat clowns are these.â JAMES. I would not wear his manners for a week To be a squire a twelvemonth and a day; Content to be no better than my father, And, thank these hands, no worse, to pay my way And move about my pastures in no fear Of bailiffs or the rent-day, with a son To take the old place on when I am gone, And keep a stranger from the fields where I Have been a boy and grew a man and died. WILLIAM. Your scheme of life is brother to my own; I shall not change my trade, tho' it has rubs And stiff ones: now this agent of our squire's,â The man was born to plague me, and his thought Comes like a city whiff to taint in smoke The freshness of the morning,âwell this man, Whose soul is in his pockets, and whose eyes Purblind to aught but stiff arithmetic, Would have me square my hedgerows like a rule, And prune to faultless parallelogram The wilderness of May-bloom and its nests. âCut straight that curving brook,â quoth he, âit wastes A good half acre; clear the rubbish growth That cumbers round its reaches; let it run In ship-shape current like the squire's main-drain:â I cannot keep my temper with the man: We'll change the subject. JAMES. O, I let him talk Above his gases and his phosphate base, His lime and silicon: it pleases him And prints well in the âHeraldâ with this head, âThe chemistry of farming:â yet this man Of mighty theory is but a babe In practice; I have seen him over-reach'd By very shallow knaves: this wordy man Bought at the fair last week a flock of ewes Not worth a halter. WILLIAM. Serve him richly right: And yet the squire shall keep him after this; He'll talk him round in his smooth fluent way: Well it's no gear of mine. JAMES. The world flows on, And in its stream some dregs waft uppermost. But truce to these discomfortable themes: Look round, forget them: timid spires of green Creep thro' the fallowy ridges, frail to bear One dew-drop's burthen, yet shall these prevail Weak infants of the harvest to the full And stately ear, to clothe the upland side As with a forest-sea, wherein the breeze Has visible workings, and the cloud is seen To mask and free the light in gleamy falls. WILLIAM. The morning draws, and we have paid enough In leisure to its freshness. I must set Some graftings in my orchard, whence my son, Who knows? shall reap the applesânowâfarewell. But as I go one wordâthat boy of yours Is very often at our place of late: I may not think his early schoolfellow My son his main attraction; and our Jane Is smartened up I fancy when he comes. Well, well, let things fare on: but well I know If there is aught in this I shall be glad, And you I think, James, will not take it ill. THE NAMELESS PICTURE. You say this picture never had a name? I like it best in all the gallery: More than the faces of Italian saints, More than the genial Flemings by their fire, Its plaintive and most touching pensiveness Prevails upon my fancy: this must mean A portrait surely: the reality Of desolation in those girlish eyes Is no ideal study. Can it be A family picture? you reply, that these Are hung together in the entrance hall. The style and dress would give some thirty years Since this was painted. Why, you told me now That you had been a servant in this house More time than that: come, you know more of this: I am a stranger here, and from to-day Return no more: this confidence is safe With one who cannot break it: tell me all.â Then the old servant faltered and refused; But more the stranger pressed him, and at last He spake to this effect: âSome thirty years, ay, more than thirty years, That painting I remember: then it hung In my young master's room where first he saw It waking: and whole days when he was sad, And that, poor boy, was often, or the squire Had vexed his son with crotchets and ill prideâ Then, days and days, a silken veil concealed The painted features: now the veil is gone.â âAnd I remember how a rumour grew That Robert, the old man had plann'd it long, Should wed a neighbour heiress, and she came To visit with her people in full trim, And we supposed the thing as good as done. But Robert on the morning that they left Went to his father's study: in an hour He came upon me with a stormy face, And bade me pack for London on that night; But the old squire left not his room again Till we were gone: I never saw him more. âWe had not been in town above a weekâ It might be more: I think it was a weekâ I was alone with Robert in the house, His only servant, and the house was small; When at the edge of dusk a lady came And wished to see my master: at her face I started as at some unearthly thing, The face had left its canvas at the hall. âWhen she had talked with Robert for a time He led her down to go; and as they past My room she seem'd to pause, and then these wordsâ I could not choose but listen, for the voice Drave some strange power upon me, and the sounds Seemed one by one to burn into my brain And could not be forgotten. Thus she spoke: ââTrue friend, forget me: I am not mine own: Seek out some worthier one and leave this dream: Forget the gentle time that we have known. You know I have forgiven long ago: Nay, what should I forgive? You made me love And have been very true: shall love and truth Demand forgiveness? What had been my life Without thee and before thee? O mine own, My one true love, shall I complain of thee Noble and young, to whom my passionate heart Fled tremulously happy; over-blest That thou wouldst smile upon so mean a thing, Unworthy thee save in her utter love? I have dared to see thee once, I have dared to speak, And tell thee that this marriage shall not cease For one like me. I will not drag thee down, I love thee far too much to drag thee down, Or hold thee from thy station to resume The pleasant hours beside me: not for me Thy people shall reproach thee: truest friend, I know thy utter fealty to refuse The sacrifice, if any choice were thine, So I have left thee none: the die is cast. He is a worthy manâmy husbandâI Am better so, than plaguing thee, a clog About the neck I love, too lowly born To wed with thee, and yet too fondly proud To bar thee from advancement and thy right. Fear not for me, if I can say farewell, Truest and best and dearest, long farewell.â âThen silence; and I heard her lessening feet: The door was closed, and then, methought, there came A sound of heavy falling, and I went And found my master senseless on the stone. Poor lad, he never rallied from that day, Altho' he seemed to all the world but me The same as ever, only somewhat still, And paler than his wont. From day to day He fought his sorrow down, but still it grew And mastered: in his absent way he said Half to himself one night, and half to me: âI wish I had the heart to face again My father: they have written, the old man Is very feeble lately: he and I Are lonely in the world, and shame it is To bicker with each other, for of friends We have not many else.â And that day week A letter came to tell the squire was dead. âThen we returned to this old place with speed. And the old squire was buried, with a score Of coaches, lines of tenants, in the pomp Of a great landlord. Robert lived alone Thereafter many yearsâthat room was his. Poor lad, I wondered that he lived so long. He ever seemed to carry where he went A weight of evil: and a vague suspense Held in his eyes, as if he waited long For something that should come but never came: And yet a gentler master with it all I think we shall not findâBut I am long: He died a young man still, and then the place Past to a distant cousin. The old breed Is gone and ended out, and these I serve Are strangers: not unkind, for me they kept, I had been here so long and here would die. And now you know the little I can tell About the portrait.â THE MOTHER'S ADVICE. I have heard you out, my boy; now let me speak. We are alone together, you and I: So we have been: the new tie changes all. You are not pledged as yet? So far is wellâ Nay now, be patient, hear me till the end: I do not mean to gainsay with one word Your marriage as a marriage: 'tis the way And process of the world: the mother's turn Cedes to this stronger heritage of time, And the wise mother grieves not: only this, I deem it in my duty chiefly now To mind you how past things have stood with us, To argue out your future as I may In all forbearance where I see you touch'd So nearly: therefore hear, my boy, and weigh The words as calmly as the words are said. It is my right and duty to advise Tho' hardly to forbid: these few calm words And I have done: yours is it to decide, The sequel good or evil most is yours: And as you say hereafter so shall I. For when your father died, and left the land Encumber'd, you had been at school a year, And you and I were lonely in the world And very poor at first: the place is small, The income scarce enough to hold our heads Above the yeoman, but the name is old, And you at least are born a gentleman; But one so little rich this name can bring No license to be idle. This alone Were profit more than loss, if this were all. Weigh then, my son, her station with your own, To her in fairness weigh it while you may. Most free am I of narrow county pride, That mates by pedigree, and would despise Earth's fairest choice with no armorial stem; But this at least allow me to premise, As something in the scale of yes or no, Her grade is not as yours: tho' young and fair, The daughter of a village lawyer, still She is not much to bring me for your wife Without a dower to this bare manor-house, Whose crumbling rafters chide their needy lord. You answer this is worldly: love is more Than birth the mock of accident: that she In the sweet garland of her youth outpays A labyrinth of lineage, and the dross Of mercenary heirdom: this is well, And gallant speech, and easy to uphold While yet her flower has freshness: pause on this, And look beyond: for what is man removed Above the herd, who fears to reason out The franchise of his foresight? Think on this, Will her disparity be held as light, As now you hold it, in the testing days When she has lost her beauty? Dare romance Make equal all in love and turn foresworn After a few rough years? No better then Than he who never made pretence to love And wedded for advantage. O my son, Think me not hard and worldly: I have known That poverty beyond the poor man's curse, Which makes the needy gentleman forego His rest to save appearance with the world, Nor shame at last an honourable name. And strong must be that wedded love to save Its gloss in such misfortune: such was ours, Your father's, portion: yours, alas, my son, Not greatly fairer; therefore, bear with me, If, having known the bitterness, I teach The peril to my child. I am not hard Tho' I have had my troubles: I can feel For your young love and you, altho' my voice Must sound from duty with a raven croak Among your may-bloom weather. I have said: Decide my son, in wisdom, I have done. THE APOTHEOSIS OF A TOWN HERO. The sacrifice is endedâfather, come: Beneath the olives yonder there is rest. The hymn of consecration and its close Dwell on my fancy yet: the crowd is poured About the vacant streets: the garlands droop On architrave and fluted column-work. The spiral smoke mounts feebler, and the ash Is embered in the censer: all is done. Henceforth the man DicÃ¦us, at whose hand This city drew such broad prosperity, Is numbered with the everlasting Great For lawful worship, hero, demigod, Guardian for aye of right municipal In this our native city-commonwealth. Hero is God, my father: but you say That this same man, who wrought the state such praise, Was, when he moved among us, much as we; Only with greater fixity of will To make the thing he wished, the thing he did: And you alone of all this town survive Who face to face lived with him, man to man. The times are changed: the hero's stuff is done. I do not think there will be any more. You tell me ânay,â that you and he have trod Thro' foul and fair together, with no thought That you were souls unequal, each to each Conceding, as our common friendships use; Allowing small vexations and the need Of trivial talk for solace on the road: And now that he is equal with the race Of heroes, Heracles, or Brasidas Of age more recentâyou a broken man Declining from the vigour of your time, And daily losing something of the past. You loved the man and watched him mount serene The gradual road of civic eminence. He spread his hands to glory and it came: The elements of discord in his eyes Pealed out their cloudy bolts: the shocks of state Beat on him like a rampart, and he stood In that high region, like a thing at rest, Invulnerably dauntless. At his voice The city armed or rested: absolute In council, as a private citizen He trod our streets and gave his word to all. He ripened thus his glory, chiefly blest To leave it, as he left it, full and fair: For dying, as he died, some worthless man Had surely gained an honourable grave; To him, the crowning and immortal close Of undiminished honour this became, To die where he had conquered, with a smile, Under his country's banner as it stood Upon the alien rampart. At his side You knelt his ancient comrade, and received The latest pressure of the strengthless hand, The recognition of his last regard: The leader, statesman, he, and you his friend A nameless soldier in the city's war. And that you loved the man beyond the taint And touch of envy, envying but his death, Rejoicing in his honour: you are old, My father, now; but this your broken age Is good in this, that you have seen to-day What our most narrow season in the light Forbids the race of man before he sleepâ You have seen a younger generation meet To consecrate the type of living worth In your own day, which you had loved, but these Behold gigantic through the misty years. JAMES AND MARY. Beside a furzy common patched with sand, An ancient mansion stood, a piebald heap Of blackened oak and plaster: in the days Of queenly Bess a hall, a farmstead now. Here Martha Bruce for many years abode, A widowed mother with a single child, Mary a comely blossom of eighteen. Now Martha, ere she fell in widowhood, Had in her cares of wisedom fretful grown: A grievance-searching nature hers, most keen To guage and probe the petty rubs and thorns Of household custom: dwelling on her cares, She bred them for herself from carelessness And want of system; then on these complained In needless-fretful whining, till she made The mote annoyance bulge a beam of wrong, And half believed herself an injured drudge, The very model of a wife ill-used. And thus she found her trouble for herself By faults of nature part, of nurture more: Forsooth she had been delicately bred, A yeoman's daughter upon gentry's verge, Taught that to move in homely usefulness, To touch a pan or darn a stocking end, Were loss of caste: the lady must not toil; And the more helpless the more lady she. And thus the girl grew, till she came to wed, Environed with a draff gentility: And when she wedded with a poorer man She started on the test of married days With slender stock of foresight; soon to fail, And sour herself and make a curse of home, Alternative in shrewing and in tears. And, after years, her goodman chanced to die; She, left with narrow store and one weak child, Held barely on the farm as best she might Unthrifty, cankered with penurious days, While still she gave her want the fiercer sting With jarring discontents, and evil thoughts Against her richer neighbours in the land. And she would prate to Mary as she grew, Filling the child with vainness and conceit, How ne'er another lass in all the shire Could touch her Mary's beauty by a league. And she could tell, nay, well enough she knew, Mary's sweet face should drive the neighbour lads Half mad in time: but she was not for these. Nay, but she hoped her child would bring her ease, And come to marry in a wealthy house, And comfort her old mother's latter days In sunshine and the honour of her name. But to the fair face, dreaming on the world Of future wonder and the things to be, The rolling years came slowly, till the time Had shaped her woman and had overborne Her girlhood. Then the mother looked at her And thought, âMy wish sights haven in this child. My still endeavour all these eighteen years Has fruited richly. I shall see good days And lay my bones in honourable rest.â But westward of the heath by some hours' ride, James Bolton lived, half farmer and half squire, Florid, fair-built, some twenty-four years old: Who rode his hunters: kept his park of deer, A small one: owned some land and rented more. He, from the hunt thrown out one winter eve, Pushed meditative homewards with loosed rein; And chanced on Mary leaning near a well To lift her pitcher: in whose gentle eyes He read a power that seemed to clothe in light The gray lane with its bare and soughing twigs Of leafless hazel: and his horse drew up Guessing the rider's mind. But James's blood Came at a leap in crimson to his face, Deep as the red leaves showering from the eaves Of cottage trailers: somewhat less she blushed; As the warm west answers the eastern glow At sunrise matching with a fainter rose. And so they dwelt confusedly: but he Grasping suggestion, with a quickened brain, From the mid flutter of his heart, devised To feign a thirsty pretext for delay, So perhaps to speak a word or change a glance. And she, how could she else? with some faint smile Willingly gave the bright wave of the well Caught from its source and trickling now no more In prison walls, and reached it, near as fair As she, whose story in the Church is read, The mother of the favoured Israel. So Mary stood: he leaning from his steed Forgot his thirst in gazing o'er the rim Upon the giver, and, so ending, thanked: And with some trivial sentence interchanged Past on and homewards; only to return With the gray light of the succeeding days, And wait beside the freshet till she came. Till it grew custom and they settled hours Of frequent tryst; and love newborn resumed The millionth time upon two wondering hearts His ancient empire; trustful love as young As when the first pale lovers moistened eyes, And trusted vows were everlasting stuff And passion's lease eternal. So the time Wore: and the mother, in short-sighted zeal, For Mary dared not tell her yet of James From some vague awkwardness and half in fear, Dinned in the daughter's ear perpetual praise Of one rich miller in a neighbour vale. Her very model of a son-in-law, This miller with his solemn face inane, Broad-cheeked, and well-to-do, and middle-aged, Easily natured, patient to be led: Slow in his speech, nor rash to overflow In glancing topic or colloquial fence. He, in a mooning fondness for the girl, Would sit, on drowsy Sunday afternoons, On the same parlour chair, in staid routine Of an accredited courtship, much besunned With bland maternal smiles and meaning looks. But Mary sat unmoved with wearied face: For duller seemed the good man than a day That drips without a stint from dawn to dusk. And so he came by clock-work and withdrew The same to a minute, phrasing his farewell Upon a constant formula: nor dreamt In his thick hide that Mary wished him gone Ere he had passed the door: and, week by week, Heavily amorous, still he came and came, And took his courtship as his Sunday beef, Equably stolid, and with both content. But, after that James Bolton sought her heart, On Mary loathing towards that other grew: Where hardly she had borne him from the first Outright she hated now, and gave to James A deeper tenderness: so time went on. At length the miller on a Sunday noon Walked with the mother in the orchard grass; Where, plucking heart with prefatory hems, He told her there and then, âthat, on advice, For folks had told him he had courted now The right time to an ell, who knew the best How such things should be with a thriving man, Who paid his way, and might, but he cared not For such thingsâand worse men had done it tooâ Subscribe himself Esquire. Well, it were best, Since he should wed her daughter, to agree The how and when, and clench the matter soon. The girl seemed shy at times: young girls were shy: Time set that right: it suited him as well. He did not want a girl to droop and pine, And swear she loved him fifty times a-day, Fierce tinder soon burnt out. The best of wives Were they that wed without the trash of hearts And lover nonsense. All that folks required To rub on well together thro' the world Came after marriage.â This he blurted out In puffs unevenly, unusual length Of verbiage for his silence. Martha gave Joyful assent, and promised for her child All should be smooth and settled in a week. Then Martha told her daughter, and the girl Looked scared, but answered nothing for the night; Nor would the mother press her further then. So Mary slipt in silence to her rest; But ere she slept she wrote to James, and told How things went ill against their love at home: And how her mother hurried on the match She hated, and she knew not what to do. On James his trouble thickened as he read, For need of action came in unripe hour, Ere he had settled purpose with himself. He feared his mother likewise; who abode And kept his house with him, and watched her son With jealous and maternal tyranny. She, daughter of a county family, Had ruled her goodman straitly till his death, Quelling his free-will with superior birth And right assumed of territorial pride: And, since this sway bore weaker on the son, She ever strove, by straining it the more, To brace her tottering frail prerogative. Thus, to sustain her ground, she came to feel Past reason querulous on imagined slight And faintest contradiction: and James knew That all her heart, as all her pride, was set To match him with a slip of some great squire, Whose race had held their acres, sire to son, Since rose with rose contended, in a chain Of proud, obscure, and dull gentility. Now James had wrote to Mary he would come The morrow; so he turned the question round Thro' all that day and half a restless night In sleep, that came, more hateful than unrest, To feign distorted shadows of his thought. And so with light he rose, and unrefreshed Rode out across the meadows, crushing down His care with motion in the whistling airs Of morning: and he rested not his steed Until he found her by the lisping well Pallid as he was pale, and in her eyes He read the crisis of his life was come. Then she, âAlas, my own and not my own! I tremble in the presence of this hour, Which parts or binds us all our doom of days Till we are cold in earth, and summer-time Is one with winter on the pulseless heart. We plant weak vows eternal, else unroot The slender threads which held us in a soil Of rich delusion. Thine, O love, to choose: On thee self-doubtful leaning I withhold My wavering judgment: yet in one resolve Most resolute am I, that if mistrust Or fleck of unsure purpose touch thy wish To cast in hand with mine this earthly timeâ I will begone and see thy face no more, And bear it patiently, as bear I can: And better thus, than in my autumn days To hang a clog about the neck I love When this poor cheek has worn its freshness by.â She faltered, ending thus, and dimmed his sight: Yet at his brain, while moister grew his eyes, A selfish instinct came. As one at bay, Environed with self-wrought perplexities, Sees some escape, unhoped for, thrust at him, And, good or evil, grasps itâSo with James, Chancing on sudden outlet, eager flashed Suggestion to ensure it: âWhen I came, And found you, Mary, listening in soft light, Strong love thrust out all hazards to conclude Thy fate and mine together. But thy words, Children of wisdom, wisely have imposed Some rein of caution on the sudden heart, That rushes blindly to its end, with guide, Save heated fancy, none. I now reverse My former mind: I see that wait we must: Wait in no rash endeavour to foresee The sequel, or precipitate the close: And yours to bend this mother to delay Our stolid miller's suit, too mean to raise Much anger, else abhorred: allege, you can, A peck of girlish reasons. Love, take heart; Be, love demands it, in entreaty brave; And all shall prosper nobly, when I win My mother down to reason from her pride.â And so they kissed and parted. But James rode Homewards with loosened rein: no ease at heart: Vext that he had not acted fair and well. So, pricking on the faster to beat down The chafing thought, he took across the fields, To slice an angle from the road, and cleared The fences in his line: but at the third The horse, who rose not, crushing thro' the stakes Rolled on his rider, whom some ploughmen came And found, to bear him homewards sense-bereft. But James was long in fever from his fall, And him his mother tended. But mischance Brought in his coat the letter to her hand, Last writ of Mary, when they brought him in Helpless and stunned. She read it, and long days The mother watched him, scheming to unweave The love this letter taught. Some comfort this, His illness, bad in most, was good in this That she might plot unthwarted: and she held, All means were holy and a mother's right To stave her son from this perpetual shame Of mating low: for all her thought was blind And warped with narrow county pride; and chief She feared her spinster sisters in their hall Lined with the canvas faces of past squires,â Great squires, each in his narrow walk supreme, Lords of the hind and acres at their gate, They drank, bred, hunted their allotted time, Then gave the parish-church one hatchment more. So, from fierce dread this match might come about In her despite, when James was up and sound, The mother stooped to guilt: and first she penned In James's hand close-mimicked some vague lines, Hinting on doubts to Mary, half-grown fears, To let her gently down, and pave the road: So prelude in her final forgery The key-note of her plot: this last she sent A week in rear. From James the writing ran In purport crafty, âThat, in deepest pain, Tortured he wrote with all perplexityâ He was not master of the course of things, He least could guide them: he had broached his love For Mary to his people one by one: Had tried remonstrance, all persuasionâdrops On graniteââWed he must if wed he would Beneath him; he was master of himself. They could not stay his wiving, nor could he Constrain themâand on this their mind was firmâ To change a single nod with his vile choice Caught from the milk-pail.ââ The insidious hand On Mary laid decision what was best, Assured she could but answer and release James of all faith henceforward. As indeed Came the reply of Mary, penned in tears, âBut blaming James in nothing, with a prayer That he might find some worthier than herself To make him happy at a future day. Nor must James fret about her: she would choose Mayhap in time an equal when this dream Had faded, one whose mother should not blush To call her daughterâending with farewell.â And when this came the mother had good heed To intercept it from the sick man's hand. So in her scheme she prospered, still in dread Lest James should move about again too soon And crush her web to nought. But that day month The pale sad Mary, crushed with evil days And goaded by her mother, morn and noon, Wedded the heavy miller, and so passed Beyond the land, to pore in after years On what had been, and train a patient heart In one dull round of loveless duty's sphere. But James, who mended slowly, chanced to read The County Herald, lighting on the news: And for a space the ceiling and the walls Swam round him, sick and stunned. He giddily rose, And strove to dress and dash aside his pain; But on him came his weakness and prevailed, As clearer flashed conviction of his full And utter desolation. Could he mend An hour of her irrevocable doom Now were his strength at fullest? Lost as dead Was Mary now: could strong despair unknit Life-woven vows, the goodman from his wife? And, if he moved, of bad should worse ensue To Mary full as wretched as himself, If he knew right, in this thrice-loathed result Of motherly compulsion. Fool and blind To waver two months since: then blindly ride A break-neck course in spleen: thus men lost all. He wished his neck had broken: this had spared All self-reproach, much bitterness of time Hereafter, and the sting of wasted chance. He must not even see her, but sit still, In forced inaction dribbling out his days With trivial occupation as they came. So wore his life away; till at the last In apathy or weakness, or in both, He wedded as his mother bade him wed, And never knew her guilty till his grave. THE NAIAD. River of mine, dear source and parent stream, Thy daughter loves upon thy lucid edge To dream away the summer, and entwine Thy lilies in her locks the long day thro'. No sister naiad mine to take delight Among thy ripples with me, nor beguile The lazy silence with alternate song. I am alone with nature and my sire. How sweet recumbent by thy gleamy rims To watch this azure Iris floating out Her curtained petals in the rosy dawn. To catch the tender murmur of the sedge Rising and bending in the cloven stream, With all its hoary blooms just crisp with wind. The pastimes of a lonely nymph are these, Not undelightful days of pensive calm: There is a cavern where I love to sleep, With reedy echoes slumberous at its mouth, And overgrown with fern leaves intricate; The bees are rustling thro' it all day long, And drop on drop an amber rillet falls. No mortal eye has seen my secret nest. Thence I behold the pastoral vale and meads Fostered for ever by my father's wave. Thence in mysterious morning I have heard Delicious music far and faint: its notes Float lost in sleepy vales and seem the flute Of some immortal, viewless in deep woods, Striving with silence thro' an Orphic fall Of melody. Beyond, the piny steep Exhales a golden vapour, and between The long-drawn foldings of its sacred vales A foremost temple-porch aÃ«rial, set On purple cliff wine-dark with granite scars. I listen as the throbbing music dies, And find another impulse at my heart. Its mighty weird prevails against my peace Destroying god-like calm, and makes me feed On future like a mortal, with the dreams Of earthly love, unmeet divine repose That knows not sorrow. Will no hero come? Either beneath the tremulous arch of eve, Or thro' the burning dews of sacred morn, And fold me on his heart, and weave me tales Of high achievement, how he braved and slew The dragon in his fastness? Of great wars, Like old Titanic conflict with the gods, Wherein his arm had wrestled strong as they. Then should I love him as he told, and waste My thirsty soul in fervour on his lips; For I am here alone and cumbered down With lonely and unloved divinity. Sweet is this nature, dear my parent stream: I love the velvet hills, and joy to hear The inarticulate music of the earth: And this calm mind immortal, weighing all In contemplation and uneager rest, Is very sweet: why ask this toil of love? Nay, love is more than these, and these with love Are more delicious. Father mine, reclined On thy cold urn, whose everlasting flow Shall make the riper harvest and enrich Innumerable kingdoms, seer and sire, Canst thou unroll the mists across my fate, And read if I am lonely evermore? I love thee well, but thy love is not all: There is a something sweeter yet to be. DANIEL BEFORE BELSHAZZAR. Why have ye led me to this impious hall? Thy face, O King, is altered from the joy Of feasting, and thy mighty ones no more Carouse, but mutely tremble: blank their eyes As yonder idiot faces carved in stone For worship. Hath God spoken at the last? Patient too long, O God, thou speakest now To trace a flaming sentence on the wall Full in the staring of those idols' eyes. The secret words, O King, thou canst not read, Nor find interpretation of their fear. If I declare the writing it shall make Your feast as dust before you: yonder wine Shall burn your lips as poison from the cups Of hallowed gold, whose desecrated use Hath drawn a vengeance from the eternal King Of angels down. Why should I read alone? Where are thy wise Chaldeans? Theirs the craft To read the faces of the silent stars, Assuring smooth dominion to thy pride: They change the map of the eternal heaven Into a lying oracle. Behold The writing: let them read it: there is store Of gold and purple for their ready lies, At such a needful time why are they dumb? Or, if these fail, make incense to your gods, Sweet odours, more libation: in your hour Of prosperous feast they heard your hymns of praise; And now they must requite their worshippers For adoration: surely they can save, For they are gods indeed, not wood or stone. Behold I am a stranger, and alone Amid the pride of Babylon: my race, The children of captivity, were led From Judah by thy father in his war, Mean captives of the sword; and who am I To stand alone amid thy thousand lords, And read thee to thy face the words of fear? And yet, O King, the writing is not hard: Search out the haughty annals of thy reign, For thy recorded empire must ensure This sequel, surely as night draws the day. To godless pride there is but one result, And he who bears himself against high God, Dooms in that hour his own devoted head. Thy gifts be to thyself and not for me. Let other reap reward, but I will none. Shall I presume to barter recompence If I interpret this divine decree? The prophet is no merchant of his craft, Nor sells his inspiration. Learn and hear. Who gave thy father majesty beyond The nations in his glory? Whose right arm Clothed him with terrible fear, and set the necks Of alien kings beneath his wrathful feet? Who gave thy sire his conquest and his throne? Who built secure dominion round his rest, And made him King indeed: a King to slay Or keep alive the nations as he chose, To cancel or establish with his nod? The most high God, the King of kings, gave all, And prospered in thy father's hand a time His delegated sceptre that he throve: Until his heart was lifted in his pride, And God eternal heard his impious joy. For thus the King had spoken as he walked For pleasure on his palace-roof, to view His large metropolis beneath his feetâ âIs not this city Babylon the great, Which I have builded for my realm's abode, The house of all my kingdom, founded sure As an eternal empire in the might Of my great glory; this majestic work For my continual honour till the end?â But while the word was in his throat there fell A voice from heaven upon him in his pride, âThy kingdom is departed:â and they drave The madman from his palace: and he dwelt With beasts and grazed their herbage, as the dews Of heaven were wet upon him: till he knew That the high God, to whom man's kings are dust, Rules in the kingdom of the sons of men, And delegates His power to whom He will. This hast thou known, Belshazzar, yet refused To humble thee before Him. Thou hast dared To lift thyself against the Lord of heaven. Thou hast defiled the vessels of His house With idol wine, and given in these the praise To gods of stone and silver; in whose mouth There is no speech nor seeing in their eyes. But the high God thou hast not glorified: Is not thy breath as vapour in His hand, And all thy ways as nothing in His sight? Then came the hand of anger from the Lord, And in thy feasting hour against the wall It wrote; and word by word I will declare The writing and assurance of thy doom.Mene. Thy kingdom God hath numbered out And finished it henceforward from the earth. Tekel. Thou in the balances art weighed, And God hath found thee wanting utterly.Peres. Thy kingdom is divided: God Hath given it to the Persians and the Medes. Nay, bring me no reward, no scarlet robe Or chain of honour. Why should I desire A barren title in a falling realm? This and thy splendour are no longer thine. The alien armies even now have scaled Thy rampart, or have dried to their device The mighty river's arm, and taught its wave Another course. I forge no idle dream: And even as I speak my words are deed. Is there no sound upon the whispering night Beyond this impious hall? Pale are ye now. I hear the tread of armies: thou, O King, Art nothing, for the Median will not spare. Ye stand like sheep, and herd about the base Of each dumb idol: surely these shall save, For these are gods indeed, and they shall wake From stony sleep and hurl the intruding host Beyond Euphrates. They are gods indeed! Down on thy knees, Belshazzar, for thy time Is at its overthrow: thy sand is run: Thy sceptre is departed evermore: Entreat for mercy thine insulted God. THE END.</field>
