      <field name="fulltext">O! t'is a sacred kinde of Excellence, That hides a rich truth in a Tales pretence! To the right Noble, Algernon, Lord Percy, sonne and heire apparant to the right Honorable Henry Earle of Northumberland. Thrice Noble, and more hopefull Pupill I (ceits) (Who learnes thy Hand to shew thy Hearts con- Would make thy heart, before it Vice doth trie, To know her Lures, to shunne her slie deceits. But, in the Prime but of thy Pupillage Before the ioynts of Iudgement can be knit, (Although for Wit thou mai'st be Wisedomes Page) Vice throwes her Lures aboue thy reach of Wit. But yet when Time shall throwly close thy Mould, Wherein all rare Conceits still cast shall bee, Then shalt thou (with cleere eies) darke lines behold, That leade thee to all knowledge fit for thee. And, sith that Childhood more in Tales delights Then saddest Truths; Ile tell thee merry Tales, Of Lords and Ladies, with their merry Knights, Their merry Blisses, and their sory Bales. The outside of these Tales are painted o're With colours rich, to please thine eagre sence; But, lin'd with naked Truth (yet richly poore) More fit for thy more rich Intelligence. When thou canst cracke this Nut, within the Shell Thou shalt a Kernell finde will please thy Taste; The Pallate of thy Wit will like it well, When thou shalt swallow it, for ioy, in haste. Then make this Nut a whirligigge the while, To make thee merry (if thou canst be so) To see the turning of our Sports to toile, Wherein obserue how pleasures come and go: For, as a whirligigge doth turne so fast, That sharpest sights the fruit do scarse perceiue: So can no Pallate fruits of Pleasure taste When they are come, so soone they take their leaue! Reads little Lord, this Riddle learne to reede; So, first appose; then, tell it to thy Peeres: So shall they hold thee (both in Name and Deed) A perfect Pierc-ey that in darkenesse cleeres. A Pierc-ey, or a piercing Eie doth shew Both Wit and Courage; and, if thou wilt learne By morall Tales sinnes mortall to eschew, Thou shalt be wise, and endlesse glorie earne: That so thou mai'st, the meanest Tutors praise; So, Percies fame shall pierce the Eie of Daies: Then, by those Raies my Pen (inflam'd) shall runne Beyond the Moone, to make thy Moone a Sunne! Meane while, and euer, I rest prest to honour thee with my poore vttermost, Iohn Dauies. To the good Knight, and my much honored Scholler, Sir Philip Carey. Sith Death (deere Sir) hath lately beene so fell, To reaue that life, than deere life deerer farre; This record of his greater rage may quell The lesse (perhaps) in your particular. Faine would I (if I could) beguile your griefe, With telling you of others heauie harmes: But (ah) such guile giues Griefe too true reliefe, In your true humane heart, that Pitty warmes. Life is a Plague: for, who doth liue, must die; Yet some that haue the Plague, doe scape aliue, So life's more mortall than Mortalitie: Then sith that life (like death) doth life depriue, You may reioyce, sith your Adolphus liu'd, True Vertues life, which cannot be depriu'd. Uiuat post funera virtus. As much grieu'd for your losse, as glad any way to shew his loue. Iohn Dauies. To the right worshipfull my deere Scholler Sir Humfrey Baskeruile of Earsley, Knight: And the no lesse louely than vertuous Lady his Wife. Sith I am Lecturing my noblest Schollers, (You being two) this Lecture deigne to reade; For thogh it treats of nought but death &amp; dollers, Yet it with pleasure may your passion feede: For, plagues to see (vnplagu'd) doth Nature please, Although good nature (gladly) grieues thereat; As we are well-ill pleas'd to see at Seas The wofull'st wracke, while we are safe from that. In health to tell what sickenesse we haue past, Makes vs more so?d; for, Gladnes health defends: O then your eies on this Plagues-Picture cast To glad and grieue you for glad-grieuous ends. But my sole End by this poore Meane to yee, Is but to tie your Eares, and Hearts to mee, Iohn Dauies. To my deere, meeke, modest, and intirely beloued Mistris Elizabeth Dutton, Mistris Mary, and Mistris Vere Egerton, three Sisters of hopefull destenies, be all Grace and good Fortune. Sith on my worthiest Schollers I doe muse, How should my Muse to minde you once neglect, Sith you are such? Th?, such she shuld abuse, Should she not vse you with all deere respect. Thou virgin Widow (eldest of the Three) (That hold'st thy widows state, of Death in chief) Death in thy youth (being fast) hath made thee free; Free from thy Ioy, &amp; fastned thee to Griefe. But he that is the Lord of lordly Death, Reserues thine honor'd Sires most honor'd Sire From Deaths dispite, &amp; while he draweth breath, Thou (lowly Soule) art likely to aspire. Thy Sisters (like in Nature, as in Name, And both in Name and Nature nought but good) (Beloued Pupills) well may hope the same, Sith of like grace there is like likelihoode. Yet in the height of Earths felicitie, A meeke regard vnto this Picture giue, To minde you so of lifes mortalitie, So shall yon liue to die, and die to liue. Meane while I hope, through your cleere Stars to spie A Trinitie of Ladies ere I die. He which (for the exercise of your hie humilitie) you please to call Master To my worthy, and worthily beloued Scholer, Thomas Bodenham Esquier, sonne and heire apparant of Sir Roger Bodenham of Rotherwas, Knight of the Bathe. And, if among them that are deere to mee, (Remembred by my Pen, my Muses Tongue,) I should forget to shew my loue to thee, My selfe, but much more thee, I so should wrong. Nay, wrong the right which I to thee doe owe: But neuer shall my loue so guilefull proue, As not to pay thee so deseru'd a due; For, I confesse thou well deseru'st my loue. Thou wert my Scholer; and if I should teach So good a Pupill such a Lesson ill (By mine example) I might so impeach Mine honest fame, and quite disgrace my skill: But when I learne thee such detested Lore, Then loathe my loue, and learne of me no more. Yours, as what's most yours, Iohn Dauies. The last Booke (being a Picture according to the Life) dedicated To the no lesse high in Birth, then honorable in Disposition (right noble in either) the Ladie Dorothie, and Ladie Lucy Percies. Great-little Ladies, greatly might you blame My little care of doing as I ought, Should I neglect to set your noble Name, First of those Principalls whose hands I taught. Yet, the more high your Birth and Places are, The more ye ought to mind the blast of Breath: As Philips Page did shew his Masters care, When most he flourisht, most to thinke on death! Then, with most blisle, when you transported be, Looke on this Picture; so, perceiue ye shall, We fall, like Leaues, in Autumne from the Tree, When Heau'n puffes at Excesse in generall: But from all woes excesse I wish ye may (way! (Throgh Heau'n on Earth) to heau'n the easiest Your Ladiships vnworthie Tutor, Iohn Dauies. To my beloued Master, Iohn Dauies. VVhen I thy Reasons weigh, &amp; meat thy Rimes, I find they haue such happy weight and measure, As makes thy Lines extend to After-times, To leade them to a Masse of Wisedomes Treasure. With weighty Matter so thou load'st thy Lines, As to dimme sights they oft seeme darke as Hell; But those cleere eies that see their deepe designes, Do ioy to see much Matter coucht so well! But these thy Numbers most familiar bee; Because strange Matter plainely they recount: For which Men shall familiar be with thee That know thee not; and, make thy fame to mount. I know no Tongues-man more doth grace his Tong With more materiall Lines, as streight as strong! Ed: Sharphell. To mine entirely beloued, Master Iohn Dauies of Hereford. In all thy Writings thou hast such a Vaine, As but thy selfe thy selfe canst counterfet; Which, lying farre beyond the vulgar straine, Is harder well to open, then to get. Few idle words thou hast to answer for In all thy workes; but, thou dost merite much (Nay supererogate) who dost abhorre Superfluous words, though thine be over-rich! Both Words and Matter do so well agree, To glorifie themselves in either kinde, That we must needs renowne both them, and thee, Who neerely sought (for vs) the same to finde: Thy Numbers flow from such a Minds excesse, As all seeme Raptures, in all happinesse! Ro: Cox. To the Reader in praise of the Author. In every Tale which scarffed Truth containes, We must that Truth vnmaske to see her face: Else see we but the halfe the Tale retaines; Then such (how e're well told) lose halfe their grace. But these are Tales, which (though their truth be maskt) Tickle the itching'st Eares with witching Touches; And so such Eares to listen still are taskt, By subtill clawing, that such Eares bewitches. Canst thou but Riddles reade, and not areede? These Riddles high (well read) stoope to thy reason: That though they fat not Wit, yet Will they feede With Wittes pure Salt, that Wits fresh-Sweetes doth season: The Fiction is for gladdest Will as fit, As is the Morall for the saddest Wit. Anth: Greys. Humours Heauen on Earth. 1 Vpon a time (thus olde wiues Tales begin, Then listen Lordings to an old wises Tale) There were three men, that were, &amp; were not kin, Kinne, as they were of the seuen deadly sinnes, no kinne as they were different sinnes. (Reedeme this Riddle) at the Wine or Ale, Did striue who most should grace the deerest Sin, For which the daintiest Soules are set to sale: For Soules that are most delicate for Sense, Gainst stings of honied sinnes haue least defence. 2 The first (for first Ile tell you eithers name To shew their natures) hight The Glutton. Poliphagus: A greasie guttes, of most vnweldie frame; The second named was The Leacher. Epithymus: Light as a feather, apt to lightest game: The third and last, hight The prowd, vaine, and ambitious man.

A Crowne of Roses ware lasciuiously; A falling Band of Cut-worke (richly sowne) Did his broad Shoulders quite ore-canopy: A waste-coate wrought with floures (as they had growne) In colour'd silke, lay open to the eie: And, as his Bosome was vnbutton'd quite, So were his Points, vntrusst for ends too light! 9 His Doublet was Carnation, cut with greene Rich Taffataes, quite through in ample Cuttes; That so his Wast-coate might, ech where be seene, When lusty Dames should eie this lusty Guttes: And many Fauours hung the Cuttes betweene, And many more, more light, in them he shuttes! So that a vacant place was hardly found About this Fancy, so well-fauour'd round. 10 His Hose was French, and did his doublet sute, For Stuffe and Colour; to which sow'd there were Silke-stockings, which sate strait his thighs about, To make his leg and thigh more quaint appeere: Their colour was, as was the vpper Sute, Saue that the quirkes with gold and gawdie geere Were so embosst, that as the Gallant goes, The glosse did light his feete to saue his toes. 11 His Shooes were like to Sandalls, for they were So caru'd aboue with many a curious Cut, That through the same the stocking did appeere, And in the Lachets were such Ribbands put, As shadow'd all the foote from Sunne well neere, Though, in Rose-forme, the ribband vp was shut: And to make vp aright this Woman-Man, He at his face still fenced with a fan. 12 But Hyselophronus vnlike to him, The Prowd-ambitious mans apparrel described. Was richly clad, but much more graue it was; For, he could not endure such colours trim, Yet vs'd trimme colours to bring drifts to passe: A Backe too bright, doth argue Braines too dim: For, no such Asse as is the golden Asse: But he that State to catch, doth know the knacke, Hides all his haughtie thoughts in humble blacke. 13 His Hat was Beauer of a middle sise, The Band, silke-Sipers foure-fold wreath'd about: A shallow Cambricke Ruffe, with Sets precise, Clos'd with a button'd string, that still hung out; Wherewith he plai'd, while he did Plottes deuise; To gull the Multitude, and rule the Rout: His Sute was Satten, pinckt, and laced thicke, As fit, as faire, without each peeuish tricke. 14 His Cloke cloth-rash with veluet throughly lin'd, (As plaine as Plainenesse) without welt, or garde, To seeme, thereby, to be as plaine in Mind; For, he to seeme good, still had good regarde: His rapier hilts wer blackt, which brightly shin'd, A veluet Scobbard did that weapon warde: The Hangers and the Girdle richly wrought, With Silke of Blacke. poorest colour, deerely bought. 15 His Stockings (sutable vnto the same) Were of blacke silke, and crosse-wise gartered: The Knot whereof a Roses forme did frame, Which neare the ham the sable leaues did spred: His Shooes were veluet, which his foote became, Thus was he clad, from foote vnto the Head: Who still was still, as one of iudgement staid, Before he heard, and poiz'd, what others saide. 16 While first (puft-panch) Poliphagus bespake, (But panted as he spake for want of winde; And at each word his fat for feare did quake, Lest that winds want that fat should melt, or bind, O that (quoth he) then reached to perbrake) Mans Necke were like a The wish of Philoxenus a philosopher.

For, so may men be praisd for deedes vniust, Sith Men, by nature, wrong their Bretheren: But, to correct To rule men well is proper to God and men onely. Men, with directing Rods, Is proper vnto none but Demi-gods. 39 The Spheare of Greatnes (like the highest sphere, That turnes the neather with resistlesse sway) Is the high'st step to his Throne without Peere; And, to the Sunne that makes eternall day; Where Blisse abounds an euerlasting yeare, For which the most deuout doe inly Few or none so mortified, but can be c?tented to liue, rather ruling then ruled. pray: Then, Greatnes is the great'st good vnder heau'n, Which vnto none but Gods on Earth is giu'n. 40 O! how it rapts the Eie of Maiestie, To see all downe-cast vnderneath her feete; That may, if please her, march vpon the Hie, Till she with none, but with the Lowly meete: Then, Humane wisedome.

The Blinde eates many a flie; and so doe you, That chew sweet poyson, which ye should eschue. 58 But ere wee further prosecute her speach, We will describe their Garments (as we may) For as we said the Coate and Cut do teach Sight to discerne what mood the mind doth sway: Logus was clad, as could no State impeach, Sith she was cloth'd with mean, thogh cleane aray: For, she with Garments farre more fit, then faire, But sauegard sought from Passions of the Aire. 59 But, Psyche (whom she guided) like a Queene Was richly deckt, with ornaments diuine: Who liu'd so closely that she scarce was seene, Yet through her Pallace did her glory shine, As if at least she had a Goddesse beene; Whose virtues were apparant to the Eine: Her Ornaments were Wit, Will, Memory, Which richly roab'd her with Regality. 60 Vpon her sacred Head she ware a Crowne (Like that of Ariadnes) all of Starres, To light her feete in darke waies, and vnknowne, And keepe the safest way in Passions warres; Those Starres were royall vertues of her owne (Which some call Cardinall) her gard in Iarres: Who was deckt inly with Pow'r, Grace, and Arte, Being wholy in the whole, and in each Part. 61 Her Vnderstandings Pow'r that Pow'r did line, Which Heau'n and Earth religiously adore; And in her Will she ware Grace most diuine, But in her Memory she Artes did store; That made the Whole most gloriously to shine, But most diuinely did those three decore! Affects and Fantasies her Seruants were, Which were all cloakt with Good, how ill so ere. 62 Hir pr?cely train, which was of works wel wroght, Was borne by Iudgement her chiefe Officer: Then, Contemplation held her, as she ought, By the right Arme, so that she could not steere Fr? those right waies, whereon before she thoght: And double-Diligence before did cleere: The outward Senses her Purueiours were, To whom the Common-sense was Treasorer. 63 Thus were these two attended and araid, Which I haue thus described by the way; And now to prosecute what Logus said From thence where I before did make him stay; Quoth hee, what meane ye thus to be betraid By sinfull Sense, which seekes but your decay? You are to seeke to know her Fallacies, But know them not by seeking in this wise. 64 How neere to temporall and eternall death You are (God wot) ye wot not, ne yet care; Not weying how worlds Worldes weale vncertaine in our life, but determines vtterly in our death. weale wastes with your breath, And that your breaths within your nostrills are; Which to the Aire you must of force bequeath, Perhaps forthwith, at least ere ye beware: If temp'rall death attach ye in this plight, Your temp'rall daies will turne t'eternall night. 65 To yong and old Death is indifferent; The Court and Cottage he frequents alike: Yet, of the twaine, he Courts doth more frequent; And loues those, that do Death is most familiar with those that are most str?ge to him. mind him least, to strike: He wounds the lustfull, vaine, and insolent With their owne weapons, quickly to the quicke: For, euer he doth enuy lifes delight, And makes the same most subiect to his might. 66 How can vaine pleasures please men, hauing sense To feele the sweete and sowre of sinne, and grace? For, if they feele the The sting of Consci?ce kils our liueliest pleasures of the flesh. sting of Conscience, All pleasures of the flesh will giue it place: That grieues the Will, that grieues th'Intelligence, Which take no pleasure in their owne disgrace: But still the lusts offraile flesh to fulfill, Is to disgrace Intelligence, and Will. 67 The obiect of the Will is perfect Good; Which, the Intelligence to her presents; That neuer yet was found in roiall food, In dainty Dames, or regall gouernments; By Daily proofe telles our vnderstandings, that all worldly pleasures are as short, as vaine, and vnsure. Vnderstanding these are vnderstood To yeeld but short, and counterfet Contents: If so they do, how madde are they the while, That giue their pretious Soules for things so vile? 68 The Salomon. wisest yet that euer breath'd this Aire (Of sinfull race) who in his wisedomes might Made proofe of all that was sweet, great, or faire, Yea of all pleasures which the sense delight,) Said of them all (like Wisedoms truest Heire) They were than skumme of Eccles. 1. 2.

Praxis, Phusis follower, Had made them worse, then she them made, by far. 92 But by the way we should not do amisse, Phusis her habit described. To shew how Ladie Phusis was araid, (Sith shee the mother of each matter is) Yer we do prosecute what Logus said: For, so her nature may be knowne by this, As outward, inward Things haue oft bewraid: For, though it seeme the Tale, by force, to part, Its recompenced with Descriptions Art. 93 Vpon her Head she ware a Crowne of Corne, Like that of Ceres; sauing that the same Was mixt (like Achelous his plenteous Horne) With fruits of eu'ry kinde, which her became; Her Haire by her was still disheuled worne, Who naked was, yet her hand hid her shame: Or if a Vaile she ware, it was but when She was to come among licentious men. 94 About her Necke she ware a Carcanet Of eu'ry Iemme as it created was: About her Wrists, in Bracelet-wise, were set The ores of Gold and Siluer, Lead, and Brasse: Thus haue we made this Ladies Counterfet, Who being bare, as barely must it passe: And now returne we eft to Logus speach, Who thus to Phusis chidingly did preach. 95 Phusis (quoth he) I speake with griefe of hart, I needs must chide, sith your fault it procures; Because you haue not plaid a mothers part Touching the breeding of these Sonnes of yours: I know you haue, by nature, so much Art, As might make them obey their Gouernours: And, that you doe not, it is your disgrace, That kill your Children with a kinde As it is saide of the Ape. embrace. 96 You may, perhaps, suppose your selfe you cleere By saying, Custome is another nature. Praxis hath abus'd you much; In alt'ring of their natures, which were deere, For that from you they all receiued such; Which could not be, if you not faultie were, For, you might haue restrain'd them with a touch: If then you had corrected Custome is ouercome by Custome, if Nature be willing. Praxis lore, They would haue bin farre better then before. 97 Little do Mothers know what hurt they do, By their indulgence, to their saucie Sonnes; They make them wanton and rebellious too; For, let loose Nature, it to Natures loosenes must be restrained by Reasons stedfastnes. loosenesse runnes; Till Soule and Body it doth quite vndoe; For, Custome ill good nature ouer-runnes: But, if the Mother be as Mothers ought, She wil by Vse amend what Vse hath wrought. 98 Phusis, not being vs'd such checkes to take, Beganne to kindle with disdainefull ire; And, like a Ouer-kinde mothers make vnkind Children. doating mother, she doth make A stiffe defence, for her sonnes lewd desire: Though fire be good, yet fire in flaxe is not good: so, though pleasure be good, yet in youth it is not good. Alas (quoth she) should they all ioyes forsake, Which both their yeares, and natures do require? Or should they wear their days in wastful thought To bring themselues, and me with them, to nought? 99 You are no friend of theirs, if so you would; And, if not theirs, then mine you cannot be: For, me and them in one Loues Band doth hold; Whom factiously you seeke to disagree: I take their part but as a Mother should, That her deere Childrens A good pret?ce for a fault maks the fault the fouler. good desires to see: For, it a tender Mother doth become, As life to loue the Children of her wombe. 100 And, are they not of flesh and blood compos'd?

For, he loues such to eate, as such do proue; May you not thanke your selfe for such despite? If Babes do burne them in a Candles flame, Are they, or those that giue it them, too blame? 102 These heauy words suncke deepe in Phusis minde, Who (as astonied) at the same did muse; Breath'd short, in Reason is very preualent with the attentiue. passion, as if wanting winde, Yet at the last, his Spirite she vp did rowze, And askt of Logus, in the kindest kinde, What practise she to saue her Sonnes might vse: I hate, as Hell, that Monster, and I would My Sons (quoth she) fr? him, by force, with-hold. 103 Now Logus, glad her nature had such grace, Said, for mine owne part, I will but aduise, Not deale with them; sith they did me When Reason is reiected, men are left to all brutishnesse. disgrace; Therefore I councell, that in any wise You hie to Lady Truth.

Esa. 30 33. spill All those that liue secure in Pleasures glee, And greedily their hungry lusts fulfill; I will (said Phusis;) but where doth she dwell? Thou know'st (deare Logus) but I cannot tell. 105 She wonted was (said he) to neighbour mee; But since that Deceit and Guile excluded Truth fr? the Earth, Fraus and Dolus (wicked Twinnes) The World produc'd, I do her seldome see; For, she from my sights reach so slily rinnes, As though to her I were an enemy, Or made prodigious through my subiects sinnes: Who prosecute her with extreame despight, That now she euen loathes to see the light. 106 Shall I (quoth Phusis) on the Earth her finde? Hardly (quoth Logus) being chas'd from thence. In th'Aire, or Water then, or in the Winde; Or else within the Fires Circumference Is she (quoth she?) said Logus, these by kinde Are mutable, and full of difference; Which she cannot abide, for she is Truth is one, but Errour is manifold. one, And rather will, then with such, liue alone. 107 Is she to Heau'n return'd (quoth she) againe? That's like (said Logus) but th'art ne'r the neere: For, without As without the Sun none can see the Sun, so without Trueth none c? come at the Author of Truth. her, thou canst not Heau'n attaine; For, all by her must come, that must come there. Alas (said she) how shall I her obtaine, Sith I must haue herselfe her selfe to cleere? For, as without the Sunne, none sees the Sunne, So, without her, none wots where she doth wonne. 108 This once (quoth Logus) I will thee direct The best I can, but cannot as I could; I oft haue heard, and finde true, by effect, That she is seene about the Mansion old Of father Time. Chronus, which he did erect For him, and her, (his daughter deere) to hold; Or, Death. Thanatus, his Man, who riddes away That which his Master bringeth to decay. 109 Which Man, and Masters habites we might paint, The description of Chronus and Thanatus. Though we but Chalke, &amp; Coles, and Ashes had: For, Chronus clad is like a mortall Saint In skinnes of Beasts, to shew how life doth fade; (Which of their age did seem to make complaint) Girt with an Halter, or with Girth as bad: Vpon whose Head, in stead of Hat, there stoode An Houre-glasse, as an Embleme of his moode. 110 His Haire was white as was the driuen Snow, And from his Head it seem'd to hang, by drifts Turn'd vp againe; eu'n as the same doth show When it doth hang, so driuen vpon Clifts: His Beard, beneath his girdle-stead did grow, Which, platted, in his bosome oft he shifts: Whose right hand did a Sithe, still mouing weld, And in his left, an Horologe he held. 111 His Man hight Thanatus, bare to the bones, Was more then naked from the toppe to toe: All hairelesse, toothlesse, eielesse, stocks, or stones, Are all as quicke, though he much more can doe: And all he said, I was as you are, once; Which was in sullen silence spoken to: Vpon a Spade he leanes, as if he did By his day-labour liue, call'd Wincke, all hid. 112 To these did Logus Phusis wish to wend Which were to her the Nature c?not abide, Death, nor Time running thereto. loathsom'st wights aliue; And hardly thought that Logus was her frend, (Although she could not otherwise beleeue Sith her and hers she sought still to defend That would to her such wofull councell giue: And, with the water swelling in her eies, She thus to Logus mournefully replies. 113 Alas (quoth she) and to them must I goe? To their most hatefull houses must I hie, That are the greatest workers of my woe, And faine would haue me vtterly to die? What A well tunde tongue cannot please an eare vtterly out of tune. words can please a prowd insulting foe, That holds in scorne his foes humilitie? Then, what hope haue I with them to preuaile, Who, though I kneele to them, will me assaile? 114 What shall I say? alas, what shall I do? To winne their fauour, that will not be wonne? To go to them, I shall my selfe vndo; For, though I kisse their feete, they'l me ore-runne: If not, they'l paine me, and compell me to; The choice is miserable where the best is misery.Both which, if I do go, I cannot shunne: I am amaz'd, I know not what to say, If go, I die; if no, my Sonnes decay. 115 What shall I do? deere Logus, tell me In case of distresse we willingly imbrace the aduice of Reason. what? O happy were I, if this feare were past: There is no cause (quoth Logus) to feare that That no wight liuing can auoide at last; The Stag, the Rauen, and the nine-liu'd Cat Must know those houses, then be not agast, But go on boldly with erected Front, Where you shall see her liue in high account. 116 If at the first you cannot see her face, Their Porter Sicknesse.

Who almost will forsake her deerest Soule, Yer once forsake her deere-bought deerer Sonne: By Logus helpe, she doth her feares controule; And to these houses goes not, but doth runne: And as she hies, she more and more doth learne, This Ladies Lodging rightly to discerne. 124 The descripti? of the house of Time.When to the House of Chronus neere she drew, (Which was a Caue in Rocke of Flint cut out) It, to the sense more horride was in shew; For, it with Mosse was inlaid all about, And ore the Gate, Harts-tongue, &amp; Br?bles grew; As on the top, did Okes, old, stiffe, and stout: Which rocks rogh sides huge mossie Beeches bare, As if the Flint the weathers threats did feare. 125 This antique Top, where these trees did not shade, The vpper Crust of a Rocke vnfrequented.A kind of Mosse ore-sprad, as hard, as hore; Which ne'rthelesse, did softly seeme to vade, And grew farre shorter then it was before; Ore which strange vermin prety Paths had made, Which there did still increase in needlesse store: For, in those Places where men least frequent, There vilest vermine are most resident. 126 About the groundsills of this hideous house (Without) grew Nettles, Noisome Plants produced from Mans more noisome offence.

Then sith we colours want, as all do see, Our too light shadowes must excused bee. 156 There lie two waies from Thænatus his house, (That still are two, sith they still disagree) One on the right hand lies, scarse now in vse, The other on the left, vs'd commonly: That, on the left, is full of all abuse, And leades vnto a world of misery; Wherein Gehennaes Hold is scituate, Which, without Hell is much more horrible then can enter into the thoght or vnderstanding.

O then aduise me (Lady) what to doe: Who said, sith they no better are for vs, Thou must Iustice.

Now runnes the Therefore will I be vnto Ephraim as a moath, and to the house of Iuda as a rottennes, Husea 5. 12. Rot along each bancke &amp; ditch, And, with a murraine strikes Swine, Sheep, and all (Or man, or beast) that chance the same to touch, So, all in fields, as in the Cities fall. The London Lanes (themseluet thereby to saue) Did vomit out their vndigested dead, Who by cart loads, are carried to the Graue, For, all those Lanes with folke were ouerfed. There might ye see Death (as with toile opprest Panting for breath, all in a mortall sweat) Vpon each bulke or bench, himselfe to rest, (At point to faint) his Haruest was so great! The Bells had talkt so much, as now they had Tir'd all their tongs, and could not speake a word; And Griefe so toild herselfe with being sad, That now at Deaths faint threats, shee would but bourd. Yea, Death was so familiar (ah) become With now resolued London Families, That wheresoere he came, he was welcome, And entertain'd with ioyes and iolities. Goods were neglected, as things good for nought; If good for aught, good but to breed more ill: The Sicke despis'd them: if the Sound th? sought, They sought their death which cleaued to th? stil! So Sicke, and Sound, at last Neither their siluer nor their golde shall be able to deliuer them in the day of the lords wrath, &amp;c Zepha. 1, 18. neglected them, As if the Sound and Sicke were neere their last; And all, almost, so fared through the Realme As if their Soules the Iudgement day were past. This World was quite forgot; the World to come Was still in minde; which for it was Her filthinesse is in her skins: she remembred not her last end, therefore shee came downe wonderfully: she had no c?forter, &amp;c. Lament. 1. 9. forgot, Brought on our World this little day of Dome, That choakt the Graue with this contageous Rot! No place was free for Free-men; ne for those That were in Prisons, wanting Libertie; Yet Prisoners frëest were from Plagues and Woes That visite Free-men, but too lib'rally. For, al their food came fr? the helthy house, Which then wold giue Gods plags from thence to keep; The rest, shut vp, could not like bountie vse, So, woefull Pris'ners had least cause to weepe. The king himselfe (O wretched Times the while!) From place to place, to saue himselfe did flie, Which from himselfe himselfe did seekes' exile, Who (as amaz'd) not safe, knew where to lie. Its hard with Subiects when the Soueraigne Hath no place free from plagues his head to hide; And hardly can we say the King doth raigne, That no where, for iust feare, can well abide. For, no where comes He but Death follows him Hard at the Heeles, and reacheth at his head; So sincks al The minh of tabrets ceaseth: the noise of them that reioice endeth: the ioy of the harpe ceaseth. Isai 24. 8. Sports that wold like triumphs swim, For, what life haue we, when we all are dead; Dead in our Spirits, to see our Neighbours die; To see our King so shift his life to saue; And with his Councell all Conclusions trie To keepe themselues from th'insatiate Graue. For, hardly could one man another meete, That in his bosome brought not odious Death; It was confusion but a friend to greet, For, like a Fiend, he baned with his breath. The wildest wastes, and places most remote From Mans repaire, are now the most secure; Happy is he that there doth finde a Cote To shrowd his Head from this Plagues smoaking showre A Beggars home (though dwelling in a Ditch If farre from London it were scituate) He might rent out, if pleas'd him, to the Rich, That now as Hell their London homes doe hate. Now, had the Sunne the Libra September. Ballance entered, To giue his heate by weight, or in a meane, When yet this Plague more heate recouered, And scowr'd the towns, that erst were cl?sed clean. Now, sad Dispaire (clad in a sable weede) Did All attend, and All resolu'd to die; For, Heat &amp; cold, they thought, the Plague would feede Which, like a A Beast neuer but feeding, and when he hath eaten as much as his p?ch ca hold, goe, to a forked tree, and there straines out his foode vndigested, betweane the twist of the tree, and so againe presently falles to feede, and being full, againe to the tree, and so eftsoones to feede. Ierffe, still sinn;d in gluttony. The heau'nly Coape was now ore-canopide, (Neere each ones Zenith (as his sense suppos'd) With ominous impressions, strangely died, And like a Canopie at toppe it clos'd. As if it had presag'd the Iudge was nie, To sit in Iudgement his last doome to giue, And caus'd his cloth of State t'adorne the Skie That All his neare approach might so perceiue Now fall the people vnto publike Fast, And all assemble in the Church to pray; Earely, and late, their soules, there take repast, As if preparing for the later day! Where (fasting) meeting with the sound and sicke, The sicke the sound do plage, while they do pray; To haste before the Iudge the dead and quicke, And pull each other so, in post, away. Now Angells laugh to see how contrite hearts Incounter Death, and scorne his Tiranny; Their Iudge doth ioy to see them play their parts, That erst so liu'd as if they ne'r should die. Vp go their harts &amp; hands, and downe their knees, While Death w?t vp &amp; down, to bring th? down; That vp they might at once (not by degrees) Vnto the High'st, that doth the humble Isai. 57. 15. crowne! O how the thresholds of each double dore Of Heau'n, and Hell, were worne with throngs of ghosts Ne'r since the Deluge, did they so before, Nor euer since so pollisht the side-posts. The Angells, good and bad, are now all toil'd With intertaining of these ceaselesse throngs; With howling some (in heat and horror broild) And othersome in blisse, with ioyfull Songs. Th'infernall Legions, in Battallions, Seeke to inlarge their kingdome, lest it should Be cloid with Collonies of wicked ones; For now it held, more then it well could hold! The Angells, on the Cristall walls of Heau'n, Holpe thousands ore the Gates so glutted were; To whom authoritie by Grace was giu'n (The prease was such) to helpe them ouer there. The Cherubin eie-blinding Maiestie Vpon his Throne (that euer blest hath bin) Is compast with The world is diuided into twelue partes, and ten partes of it are gone already, and halfe of the tenth part: &amp; there remaineth that which is after the halfe of the tenth part. 2. Esd. 14. 10, 11 vnwonted Company, And smiles to see how Angells helpe them in. The heau'nly streets do glitter (like the Sunne) With throngs of Sonnes but newly glorifide; Who still to praise their Glorifier runne Along those streets, full fraught on either side. Now was the earthly Mammon, which had held Their Harts to Earth, held most contagious; A Beggar scornd to touch it (so defilde) So, none but castawaies were covetous. Now Auarice was turned Cherubin, Who nought desir'd but the extreamest Good; For, now she saw she could no longer sinne, So, to the Time she sought to suite her moode, The loathsome Leacher loath'd his wonted sport; For, now he thought all flesh was most corrupt: The brainsicke brawler waxed all-amort; For, such blood-suckers Bane did interrupt. The Pastors now, steep all their words in Brine, With woe, woe, woe, and nought is heard but woe; Woe and alas, they say, the powres diuine Are bent Mankind, for sinne to ouerthrow. Repent, repent, (like Ionas) now they crie, Ye men of England, O repent, repent; To see if so yee maie moue Pitties Eye, To looke vpon you, ere you quite be Neuertheles saith the lord, at those days I will not make a full end of you. Ier 4. 18. spent. And oft whilst he breathes out thess bitter Words, He, drawing breath, drawes in more bitter Bane: For, now the Aire, no Aire but death affords; And lights of Art (for helpe) were in the wane. Nor people praying, nor the Pastor preaching, Death spared ought; but murd'red one and other; He was a walme, he could not stay impeaching, For it is the day of the Lords vengeance, and the yere of rec?pence for the iudgement of Sion. Isai. 34. 8Who smoakt with heat, &amp; chokt, all with the smother. The babe new born he nipt strait in the head With aire that through his yet vnclosed Mould Did pierce his brains, &amp; throgh th? poison spread, So left his life, that scarse had life in hold. The Mother after hies, the Father posts After the Mother; Thus, at Base they runne Vnto the Gole of that great Lord of Hoasts That for those keepes it that runnes for his Sonne. The rest Death trippes, and takes them prisoners; Such lose the Gole without gainesaying-strife; But, all, and some, are as Deaths Messengers To fetch both one and other out of life. The Sire doth fetch the Sonne, the Sonne the Sire, Death, being impartiall, makes his Subiects so: The Priuate's not respected, but intire (Death pointing out the way) away they go. The ceremonie at their Burialls Is Ashes but to Ashes, Dust, to Dust; Nay not so much; for, strait the Pit-man falles (If he can stand) to hide them as he must. A Mount thus made, vpon his Spade he leanes (Tired with toile) yet (tired) prest to toile) Till Death an heape, in his inn'd Haruest, gleanes, That so he may, by heapes, eft seed the Soile. Not long he staies, but (ah) a mightier heape Then erst he hid, is made strait to be hild; The Land is scarse, but yet the Seed is cheape, For, all is full, or rather ouerfill'd. The Beere is laid away, and Cribbes they get Dung-cribs. To fetch more dung for Fields and Garden-plots; Worke-men are scarse, the labour is so great, That (ah) the Seede, They shall die of deaths and diseases, they shall not be lamented, neither shall they be buried, but they shall be as dung vpon the earth, &amp;c. Ier. 16. 4. vnburied, often rottes. It rottes, and makes the Land thereby the worse, For, being rotten, it ill vapors breedes, Which many mortall miseries doe nurse, And the Plague (ouerfed) so, ouerfeedes. Here lies an humane Carcasse halfe consum'd; And there some fow or beast, in selfe same plight; Dead with the Pestilence, for so it fum'd, That all it touched, it consumed quite. Quite through the hoast of Natures Animalls Death like a Conquerer in Triumph rides; And ere he came too neare, each Creature falls, His dreadfull presence then no flesh abides. Now man to man (if euer) fiends became, Feare of infection choakt Humanitie; The emptie Maw (abandon'd) got but blame If it had once but sought for Charitie. The Poore must not about, to seeke for foode, And no man sought them, that they might be fed; Two Plagues, in one, inuaded so their blood, Both Famine, and Infection strikes them dead. Some staid, in hope that Death would be appeas'd, And kept the towns, which th? &amp; theirs had kept; Till their next neighbors were (perhaps) diseas'd; Or with Deaths fatall Fanne away were swept. Th?, fain wold fly but could not (thogh thei wold) For, wil they, nill they, they must keep their house, Till throgh some chink, on th? Death taketh hold, And vs'd them, as he did their neighbours vse. If any at some Posterne could get out, As good they staid, sith sure they staid should be; They haue compassed her about, as the wrtchmen of the field, because she hath prouoked me to wrath, saith the Lord Iere. 4. 17.For, all the Countries watcht were round about, That from the towne, none might a furlong flee. Then, who from Death did flie, the feare of Death Made Free-men keep the fliers in his Iawes; Where (poison'd with his fowle infectious breath) Their flesh and bones he (ne'r suffized) gnawes. Now might ye see the Plague deuoure with speed As it neare famisht were, lest in a while It might be so, and want whereon to feede; So fed, the future hunger to beguile. Now doth it swell (hold hide) nay, If the botch breake not, the Patient liueth not. breake, or die) Till skin doth crack, to make more It killes others with breaking. room for meat Yet meat, more meate it (neuer cloid) doth crie, And all about doth runne the same to get. The Graues do often vomit out their dead, They are so ouer-gorg'd, with great, and small; Who hardly, with the earth are couered; So, oft discouer'd when the Earth did fall. Those which in hie- They that feed delicately perish in the streetes, they that were brought vp in scarlet, embrace the d?g Lament. 4. 5.waies died (as many did) Some worthlesse wretch, hir'd for no worthles fee, Makes a rude hole, some distance him beside, And rakes him in farre off; so, there lies hee. But, if the Pit-man haue not so much sense To see, nor feele which way the winde doth sit To take the same, he hardly comes from thence, But, for himselfe (perhaps) he makes the pit: For, the contagion was so violent, (The wil of Heau'n ordaining so the same) As often strooke stone-dead incontinent, And Natures strongest forces strait orecame. Here lieth one vpon his burning brest, Vpon the Earths cold breast, and dies outright; Who wanting buriall, doth the Aire infest, That like a Basaliske he banes with sight! There reeles another like one deadly druncke, But newly strooke (perhaps) then downe he falls, Who, in the And their corpes shall lie in the streetes of the great citie, &amp;c. Reuel. 11. 8. Streets, or waies, no sooner suncke, But forthwith dies, and so lies by the walles, The Hay-cockes in the Meades were oft opprest With plaguy Bodies, both aliue, and dead; Which being vs'd, confounded Man and Beast, And vs'd they might be ere discouered. For, some (like Ghosts) wold walk out in the night, The Citie glowing (furnace-like) with heate Of this contagion, to seeke if they might, Fresh aire, where oft they died for want of meate. The Traueler that spied (perhaps his Sire) Another farre off, comming towards him Would flie, as from a flying flame of fire That would, if it he met, waste life and limbe. So, towns fear'd townes, and men ech other fear'd; All were (at least) attainted with suspect, Because of their pride the Cities shall be troubled, the houses shall be afraid, men shall feare. 2. Esd. 15, 18.And, sooth to say, so was their enuy stirr'd, That one would seeke another to infect: For, whether the disease to enuy mou'd, Or humane natures malice was the cause, Th'infected often all Conclusions prou'd To plague him that fr? th? himselfe withdrawes! Here do they Gloues, and there they Garters fall; Ruffs, Cuffs, &amp; handkerchers, and such like things They strow about, so to endanger all: For, Enuy now, most pestilently stings! So, heau'n and earth, against Man did conspire, And Man against Man, to exrirpe his Race; Who Bellowes were t'augment Infections fire, And blow abroad the same from place to place. Sedition thus marcht (with a pestilence) Destruction vpon destruction is cried, for the whole Landis wasted &amp;c. Iere. 4. 20. From towne to towne, to make them desolate; The Browne-Bill was too short to keep it thence, For, further off it raught the Bill-mans pate. Nor walls could keepe it out; for, it is said (And truely too) that Hunger breakes stone-walls: The plague of Hunger with the Plagne arrai'd It selfe, to make way, where ere Succour calls. For, hungrie Armies fight as Fiends they were: No humane powre can well their force withstand: They laugh to Iob 41. 20. scorne the shaking of the Speare: And gainst the gods th?selues, th?selues dare band Some ranne as mad (or with wine ouer-shot) From house to house, when botches on them ranne; Who, though they menac'd were with Sword, and Shot, Yet forward ran, &amp; feare nor God nor man! As when a Ship, at Sea, is set on fire, Simil. And (all on flame's) winde-driuen on a Fleete, The Fleete doth flie, sith that Ship doth desire (Maugre all force oppos'd) with it to meete: So flies the Bill-man, and the Muskettire From the approaching desperate plaguy wight, Plagues are sent vnto you and who can driue them away. 2. Esd. 16. 4. As from a flying flame of quenchlesse fire; For, who hath any life, with Death to fight? At all, cries Death, then downe by heaps they fall: He drawes in By, and Maine, amaine he drawes Huge heapes together, and still cries, At all: His hand is in, and none his hand withdrawes. For, looke how Leaues in Autumne from the tree Simil. With wind do fall, whose heaps fil holes in gro?d; So might ye (with the Plagues breath) people see, Fall by great heapes, and fill vp holes profound. No holy Turffe was left to hide the head Of holiest men; but, most vnhall'wed grounds (Ditches and Hie-waies) must receiue the dead, The dead (ah woe the while) so Many dead Bodies shal be in euery place, they shall cast them foorth with silence. Amos 8. 3. oreabounds! Here might ye see as t'were a Mountainet Founded on Bodies, grounded very deepe, Which like a Trophee of Deaths Triumphs set The world on wonder, that did wondring weepe: For, to the middle Region of the Aire, Our earthly Region was infected so, That Foules therein had cause of iust dispaire, As those which ouer Zodome dying go! Some common Carriers, (for their owne behoofe, And for their good, whose Soules for gaines doe Fetching fr? L?d? packs of Plags, &amp; stuffe (grone) Are forc'd to inne it, in some Barne alone. Where, lest it should the Country sacrifise, Barne, Corne, and Stuffe a Sacrifice is sent (In Aire-refining Flames) to th'angrie Skies, While th'owners do their Faults &amp; Losse lament. The Carriers, to some Pest-house, or their owne, Carried, clapt vp, and watcht for comming out, Must there with Time or Death conuerse alone, Till Time or Death doth free the world of doubt: Who thogh they Cariers were, yet being too weak Such heauy double Plagues as these to beare, Out of their houses som by force do break, And This no fiction, nor inserted by poeticall licence: But this verily was performed in the borough of Leominster in the county of Hereford: the one at the commandement of sir Herbert Crost knight, one of the Councell of the Marcher of Wales: the other by the instigation of Sathan, and prococation of the disease. drowne themselues, themselues from plags to cleare. These are reuenges fit for such a God, Fit for his Iustice, Powre, and Maiestie; These are right ierkes of diuine Furies Rod, That draw from Flesh the life-blood mortally. If these are but his temp'rall Punishments, Then what are they surmounting Time and Fate? Melt Flesh to thinke but on such Languishments, That Soule and Bodie burne in endlesse date. His vtmost Plagues extend beyond the reach Of comprehension of the deepest Thought; For, he his wisedome infinite doth stretch To make them absolutely good for nought. Then, O what heart of sensible Discourse, Quakes not, as if it would in sunder fall, But once to thinke vpon such Furies force, As doth so farre surmount the thoughts of all? If humane Wisedome in the highest straine, Should yet stretch further Torments to deuise, They would be such that none could them sustain, Through weight of woes, and raging agonies: Then (O) what be they that deuised are By Torments, deuised by infinite wisedome, are infiite in paine. Wisedome that of Nought made all this All, That stretch as farre past speach, as past compare, Surmounting Wonder; supernaturall! They be the Iudgements of that Trinitie, Which (like themselues) are most inscrutable; Then can mans heart, but either swoone or die, To thinke on anguish, so vnthinkeable. And can our Sense, our Sense so much besot, To thinke such worlds of woe no where exist, Sith in this sensuall World it feeles them not, And so in sinne (till they be felt) insist? Then happy That, that is insensible, Since wee imploy our happinesse of Sense To feele and taste but pleasures sensible; And see no Paine that at their end commence. To breake the Belly of our damn'd Desires With honied Sweets that soone to poison turne; And in our Soules enkindle quenchlesse fires, Which all the frame thereof quite ouerturne. Mortall life is no more (at the most) compared to Eternitie.To please it selfe a Moment, and displease It selfe for euer, with ne'r-ending paines; To ease the Bodie with the Soules disease, To glad the Guttes, to grieue the Heart &amp; Braines. To make the Throat a Through-fare for Excesse, The Belly a Charibdis for the same; To vse Wit still but onely to transgresse, So fares it with sensuall Epicures and Libertines.And make our Sense the Spunge of Sin &amp; Shame: Then happy are sweet Floures that liue and die (Without offence) most pleasing vnto all: And haplesse Man that liues vnpleasingly To Heau'n and Earth; so, liues and dies to fall. The Rose doth liue a sweete life, but to please, And when it dies, it leaues sweet fruit behinde; But Man in Life and Death doth none of these, If Grace by The conuersion of a sinner is most miraculous. Miracle ne'r mend his mind. Blush Man, that Floures should so thy selfe excell That wast created to excell what not? That on the Earth created was to dwell; Then blush for shame to grace thy Beauties blot. Art thou Horizon made (vnholy one) Betwixt immortall Angells, and bruit beasts? Yet wilt twixt beasts and fiends be Horizon By that which Angells grieues, and God detests? Then Plagues must follow thy misguided Will, So to correct thine ill-directing Wit; Such as these are, or others much more ill, The worst of which Sinne (ill of Ills) befit. And loe, for Sinne; how yet the Plague doth rage (With vnappeased furie) more and more, Making our Troy-nouant a tragicke Stage Whereon to shew Deaths powre, with slaughters sore. Great Monarch of Earths ample world he is; And of our little Man is Microcosmos. Worlds (that worlds content) He giues ill Subiects Bale, good Subiects Blisse; So, though he raignes, iust is his Regiment. Our sins (foule blots) corrupt the Earth and Aire; Our sins (soules botches) all this All defile; And make our Soules most foule, that were most faire; For, nought but sin we all, all nought the while! When sharpest wits are whetted to the point, To pierce into all secrets, but to sinne! And all the corps of Luxury vnioint, To see what sensuall ioy might be therein: When as such trickes as no Sunne euer saw Deuis'd are daily by the Serpent-wise, To cramme all Flesh into the Deuills maw By drifts, as scarse the Deuill can deuise! Can God (most iust) be good to men so ill? And can the Earth, and Aire, wherein such liue, Keepe such aliue? O no, all Plagues must fill That Aire, and Earth, that do such plagues reliue. What are those men but plagues, that plague but men? All men are such, that teach sin in effect; And all do so, that sinne but now and then, If now and then they sinne, in ouertact. What can containe vs, if these plagues cannot? If neither these we feele, nor those we shall, Be not of force to keepe our liues from blot, What then remaines but plagues to scowre vs all? Till we wax lesse, and they so multiplide, That we be nothing lesse, than what we are; Conuerted, or confounded we abide In, or without God, with, or without care! If when his yron Rod drawes blood from vs, And is vpon our backes, yea breakes our bones, We cease not yet to be rebellious, What can conuert vs but plagues for the nones! For Natures heart doth yrne with extreame griefe, When wel she weighs her childrens strange estate, Subiect to sinne, and so to sorrowes chiefe, For both in counterchange renew their date: For now we sinne (yea with a witnesse sinne, Witnesse our conscience) then we plagued are, Plagu'd with a witnes, (witnesse plagues that With fury on vs) then, when so we fare Fall we to pray and creepe to Grace for grace, Which being got, and ease, and weale at will, We fall to sinne, and so our soules disgrace: Thus sinne and plagues runne round about vs still This euer-circling Plague of plagues and sinne, Surroundeth Mankinde in an hell of woe, Man is the Axis standing still therein, And goes with it where euer it doth goe; For since he fell, who at this Center staies By Nature (most vnnaturall the while) Here moues man mouelesse as the Axis plaies, And Times turns (turning with him) doth beguile. And yet this Plague (if Griefs tears quench it not) Is like a sparke of fire in flax too drie, And may, if our Lusts coole not, burne more hot Than erst it did; so waste vs vtterly. We see it will not out, but still it lies In our best Cities Bowells like a Cole That threats to flame, and stil doth fall and As appeareth by the Plague bills euerie weeke. rise, Wasting a part, thereby to warne the whole. None otherwise than when (with griefe) we see Some house on fire, we strait, to saue the towne, Simil. Watch, fast, and pray, and most industrious bee, With hooke and line to pull the Building downe: So doth this fire of heau'ns still kindling ire Blister our Cities publike Body so, As we are blister'd, but with so much fire, As we may quench with teares if they do flo. But if it should breake forth in flames afresh, (As (ah) what staies it but vnstinted Grace?) What thing shuld quench it but a world of Flesh? Or desolation it away to chace? Time neuer knew since he beganne his houres, (For aught we reade) a Plague so long remaine In any Citie, as this Plague of ours: For now six yeares in London it hath laine. Where none goes out, but at his comming in, If he but feeles the tendrest touch of smart, He feares he is Plague-smitten for his sinne; So, ere hee's plagu'd, he takes It to the heart: For, Feare doth (Loadstone-like) it oft attract, That else would not come neere; or steale away; And yet this plaguy-feare will scarse coact Our Soules to sinne no more, this Plague to slay. But thou, in whose high hand all hearts are held, Conuert vs, and from vs this Plague auert: So sin shall yeeld to Grace, and Grace shall yeeld The Giuer glory for so deere desert. Too deere for such too worthles wicked Things, At best but clods of base Infirmitie; Too deere for sinne that all this murraine brings; Too deere for those that liue but twice to die. In few, what should I say? the best are nought That breathe, since man first breathing did rebell: The best that breath are worse th? may be thoght, If Thought can thinke the best can do but well: For, none doth well on Earth, but such as will Confesse (with griefe) they do exceeding ill! The best is but a Micah 7. 4. Briere, and Psal. 14. 2. 4 none doth good, But He that makes Vs blamelesse in his Ephes. 5. 12. Blood. FINIS.</field>
