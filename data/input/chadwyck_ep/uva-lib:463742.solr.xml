      <field name="fulltext">TO THE RIGHT Honourable Sir Fraunces Walsingham, Knight, principall Secretarie to her Maiestie, and one of her Highnesse moste Honourable priuie Councell: Antony Munday, vvisheth the happie continuance of earthly Honour, as also to be partaker of the endlesse ioy in the life to come.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Verses in the Libell, made in prayse of the death of Maister Campion, one of the societie of the holie name of Iesus; heere chaunged to the reproofe of him, and the other Traitours. Why doo I vse my paper, inke and pen, and call my wits in co?cell what to say? Such memories were made for woorthy men, And not for such as seeke their Realms decay, An Angels trumpe, exalts y? Subiects trueth: When shame rings foorth y? Traitors fearful rueth. Pardon my want, I offer naught but will, To note downe those, at whome the Skies do skowle: C?pion, his treas?s do exceed my skil, The cause, his comming, &amp; the deede too fowle. Yet giue me leaue in base and homely verse: His lewd attempts in England to rehearse. He came by vowe, the cause, his Princesse foyle, His armour, Treason, to his Countryes woe: His comfort, blood, slaughter &amp; greeuous spoyle, The Deuill his Author had incenst him so. His triumphe, Englands ruine and decay: The Pope his Captaine, thirsting for it aye. From ease to paine, from honour to disgrace, From looue to hate, to daunger beeing well: Thus dyd he fall, flying his natiue place, and Countrey, where by duty he should dwell. Our no Apostle comming to restore: The bloody sway was sometime heere before. His natures flowers, were mixt with h?ny gall, His lewd behauiour, enimie to skill: A climing minde, reiecting wisedomes call, A sugred tongue, to shrowde a vicious will, A Saintlyke face, yet such a deuillish hart: As sparde no trauaile for his co?tries smart. With tongue and pen, the trueth he did suppres, Stopping the way that Christians did desire: Which pleased God for his great wickednes, To stay his race, wherein he dyd aspire. Then his behauiour witnessed the more: What he was then, as also long before. His fare was good, yet he a scornefull cheare, His prison fayre, yet he a froward minde: His councell good, yet deafned was his eare, Perswasions large, he obstinate and blinde. Oh stubborne m?, oh minde &amp; nature stra?ge: Whome wisdom, pittie, grace, nor looue could chaunge. After great pause, they brought him to dispute, With Bookes as many as he could demaund: His cheefest cause, they quickly did confute, His proofe layd downe, reprooued out of hand. So that the simplest present there could say: That Campions cause did beare the shame away. After his foyles so often to his face, It was thought good, Iustice his deedes should trie: Upon appearaunce of so fowle a case, Nature her selfe, wild doome deseruedlie. Traitour he was, by prooues sufficient fo?d: The Iewrie sawe his Treasons so abound. Her Maiestie to be depriu'd of lyfe, A forraine power to enter in our Land: Secrete rebellion must at home be rife, Seducing Preests, receiu'd that charge in h?d All this was cloaked with Religious showe But Iustice tried, and found it was not so. Then rightfull doome bequeathed them to dye, Whose treasons put her Maiestie in feare: Out on the fiend, whose mallice wrought so slie Hath wun a number, part with him to beare But thinketh he, his enuie can preuaile? No, little Dauid did the Giaunt quaile. My gratious Princesse, see your Subiects mone, Such secret foes among them should be found: Who serue your Grace in duety euery one, though treas? seek to make their harts vnso?d. The bloody woolf prayes on y? harmles sheepe: So treason seekes in loyall harts to creepe. England looke vp, thy Children doo rebell, Unreuerent actes haue entred in their minde: The subiect seekes his rightfull Prince to quell, Yea, to his natiue Countrey prooues vnkinde. Campi?, who somtime y? didst sweetly sourse: Prepares his venome to destroy his Nourse. Eliot reioyce, that God prolonged thee, To take the man, who meant vs all such yll: As for thy slaunders, take them patiently, Enuie drawes blood, and yet hee can not kyll. Those who by words he seemde to put in feare: Haue washt their h?ds, in iudgement so?d and cleare. My selfe as witnesse, Sled and all the rest, who had their treasons noted in our Booke: Account our selues of God most highly blest, who gaue vs grace to such attempts to looke. And hauing giuen our witnes sound &amp; plaine: We feare not mallice, nor his spightful train. The well aduised Iewrie on this cause, Who with discretion pondred euerie thing: Behelde their treasons with such heedfull pause, That they fo?d out the depth of Enuies sting. Whereby they saw, the stirrers of this strife: Were farre vnwoorthy any longer life. Yea, Elderton dooth deskant in his rime, The high offences of such gracelesse men: Which causeth him to yrke at euerie crime, And gainst their treasons to prouide his pen, Yet not without wisedome and modestie: To warne all other that liue wickedlie. Remember you that would oppresse the cause, Our Church is Christes, his honour c?not die: Though hell him selfe, reuest his griesly iawes, And ioyne in league, with treason &amp; poperie. Though craft deuise, and cruel rage oppresse: Christe will his chosen, styll in safetie blesse. You thought perhaps, pres?ptious C?pi? could, disseuer those, whom Christ hath ioynd in one: And that our gratious louing sheepheard would, Before the woolfe, forsake his flock alone. No, he preserues his Sheepe for greater good: And drownes y? rauener in his enuious blood. We knowe that Campion liuing did intreate, The Subiect from his vowde humilitie: Nowe therefore shame his dealings dooth repeate, Throughout the world to his great infamie. The skies th? selues, with lowring angry face: Adiudge his deedes, woorthy of all disgrace. All Europe woonders at this shamelesse man, England is fild with rumor of his race: London must needes, for it was present than, wh? Iustice did three Traiterous minds deface. The streets, y? stones, y? steps they halde th? by: Pronounst these Traitours woorthy for to die. The Tower sayeth, he Treason did defend, The Barre beares witnesse of his guilty minde: Tiborne dooth tell, he made a Traitours ende, On euery gate example we may finde. In vaine they work to laude him w? such fame: For heauen &amp; earth beares witnes of his shame. The rightful sentence giuen of him heere, Will charge his conscience in the time to come: Although they say he is excused there, And shall not taste Gods iudgem?t &amp; his doome. Saint Paul dooth say, in reuerence of y? highest: We all shall come before the seate of Christ. There to make aunswer vnto euerie thing, And to receyue reward accordinglie: If well, the Cittie of our heauenlie king, Shall recompence our former miserie. Where we with Angels voice continuallie: Shall laude the gaine we haue so happilie. Then blinded mallice shall perceyue and see, His owne deuises Author of his rueth: And how true Subiects haue felicitie. In recompence of their assured trueth. The one condemnd for his disloyaltie: The other crownd for his fidelitie. Can Treason then preuent our happy peace? Or blustring winds assayle our sprouting Tree? No, soueraine Faith sends down her due encrease, And shroudes her Plant in sweete tranquilitie. So that the foe presuming on his might: Is forste to know: Faith can preuent him quite. Let vs not feare a mortall Tirant then, Seeing Faith &amp; Trueth dooth eleuate our harts: God hath reserued one to conquer ten, Let vs then learne to play true Christi?s parts. The head of him that sought our Co?tries wo: Dooth witnesse shame to all that seeke it so. His youth dooth byd vs bannish filthy pride, his fleeting h?ce, to serue our Prince in trueth: His lewd profession dooth lay open wide, To fall from God, how greeuous is the rueth, His home returne, his Challenge, &amp; deface: Saith: Subiects, keep true harts in euery place. His Hardle drawes his sect vnto like ende, His speeches there, vnfolde their tretcherie: His death dooth say: Who so his life dooth sp?d In faith and trueth, reapes ioy eternallie. His first and last, and all agree in one: Ther's none to helpe vs, but our God alone. Blessed be God, who cut him off so soone, Th?ked be Christ, which blest his seruants so: Happy are we, that haue such comfort woon, curssed are they that thought to work vs woe. Bounden we be to giue eternall prayse: To Iesus name, who did such refuge rayse. FINIS. An other vpon the same. What iron hart, that would not melt in woe, what steele or stoone, could keepe him drie from teares: To see a Subiect fall from duetie so: And arme him selfe vnto his Co?tries feares? In their three deaths, y? standers by might see: The ende of hatred and disloyaltie. England may mone a Subiect erred so, Without respect of God and Natures lawe: And we our selues may show some signe of woe, That treason should our brother fr? vs draw. That Antichrist should gain our C?pi?s hart: And make him Soldier to his co?tries smart. The skowling skies did storme and puffe apace, they could not beare y? wr?g y? malice wrought: The Sun drew in his gold? shining face, y? moistned clowds shed brinish teares w? thought. The riuer Thames against his course would r?: To count the treas?s, C?pion would haue doon. Nature her selfe, with teares bedewd her face, Duetie in countenaunce, looked pale and wan: Shee, for to think her worke should her disgrace, He, to be wanting in an English man. Euen Antichriste, the eldest childe of hell: Began to blush, and thought he did not well. For loe, beholde, when Campion made his end, His hardned hart, refused soueraigne grace: His owne reproche did so his minde offend, That treason did appeare vpon his face. An yrksome spectacle was presented then: In sight of God, of Angels, Saints and men. The heauens did cleere, y? Sun like gold did shine, The Clowdes were drie, the fearfull Riuer ran: Nature and Vertue, wipte their watred eyne, To see that Iustice, cut off such a man. Men, Angels, Saints, and all that saw him die: Gaue thankes to God in heauenly melodie. They saw Peruersenes had withdrawn his minde, And Treason quite supplanted Dueties awe: Presumptuous thoughts, did h?ble Patience blind, There was no place for Graces, well they sawe. His falsehood, treasons and impietie: With blame and shame, did ende in infamie. By whose example, euerie Subiect maye, Be warned howe they fall in such abuse: And all their thoughts on loyaltie to staye, Least they likewise doo taste like sharpe refuse. For Honour dooth exalt the Subiect iust: When Horrour throwes y? Traitour in y? dust: Reioyce, be glad, triumph, sing Himnes of ioy, Campion, Sherwin, Brian, haue their due: They are supprest that sought our great annoy, I hope their fellowes shortly shall ensue. For faithfull minds doo lothe y? they should liue: Who to their Countrey, doo dishonour giue. FINIS. A Dialogue betweene a Christian, and Consolation. Christian speaketh first. Is chaste Susanna in the Iudges handes? Is Daniell left vnto the Lions iawes? Doo Subiects breake bothe God &amp; Natures b?des? And Enuie seeke to put downe Peace her lawes? Dooth perfect awe, and true Religion fayle? Then may I feare that falsehood will preuayle. Consolation. No, Susans foes the Lord will cut in twaine, and stop the mouthes of Danielles enimies: Reioyce therfore, thou hast a noble trayne, Armde by the Lord in most triumphant wise. Whose life and death, thy quarrell will begin: To vanquish falsehood, Sathan, hell and sinne. Beholde of late, a Champion of their traine, Confuted, foyled, yea, and vanquished: With those who did like tretcheries maintaine, In their deuises, they soone perished. Lament not then, for Iustice holds y? swoord: Who to them all, will like desert affoord. Christian. Alas I mourne, and sit with sighing minde, To see my natiue Countrey men rebell: Against the onely Phænix of her kinde, Who dooth in grace and goodnesse all excell. And could proud C?pion thinke to worke her woe: O Lord c?fo?d them all, y? seeke it so. What were his giftes, if we recount ech one? A pregnaunt wit, I graunt to tretcherie: A bad Diuine, seeking promotion, A lustie man, detesting chastitie. A gracelesse impe, sprung vp of basest kinde: A simple man, to beare a loftie minde. His pithie wisedome, style and eloquence, Comparde with those of fame and dignitie: Dooth open plaine his freends insipience, His confutation prooues it woorthilie. All the reportes, whereby his fame began: Were neuer found to harbour in the man. Then boast no farder of his dreadlesse minde, Which rack nor roape, could alter as you say: Recount his treasons, cruell and vnkinde, And then his prayse will soone be layd away. Your praise, his p?pe, nor al you haue in store: Can make the man, the woorthier ere y? more. Consolation. Tis true in deede, their follie is in sight, vnto their shame that take like thing in hand: We needs must win, our Lord himself doth fight The Cananites shalbe expulst the Land. Yea, all the deedes of such vngodly men: Shalbe confounded, nere to rise agen. Campion his quarters on the gates doo showe, His treason, doctrine, and his lyfe too yll: His head set vp, dooth daylie call for moe, Of those that leane vnto like wicked wyll. Well may they flaunt, &amp; florish for a space: But trueth in ende, their dealinges will disgrace. Not hell it selfe, our iniurie can frame, But we shall prosper as the sprouting Baye. God can of stones rayse seede to Abraham, He is our hope, and he wyll helpe vs aye. Christian. Fiat voluntas Dei, then saye I, I trust in God, whether I liue or die. FINIS. The Complaint of a Christion, remembring the vnnaturall treasons of Edmund Campion, and his Confederates. O God from sacred throne beholde, our secrete sorrowes heere: Regard with grace, our helplesse grace, amend our mournfull cheere. Thy Creatures whome thou hast appoint, to liue in Princesse awe: Forsake their duetie, looue and feare, and spurne at dueties lawe. Alas, I rue to thinke vppon, their factes so lately scand: Howe they did seeke their Princesse death, and spoyle of natiue Land. Thy Treasons Campion is bewaylde, of many farre and neere: To thinke what vnkinde actions, thou wouldest haue perfourmed heere. Bohemia Land may well reioyce, Rodulphus Court be glad: That thou to recompence thy paine, such due desart hast had. Germania maye leaue off to mourne, yea, Spayne to muse and Italie: And Fraunce may rent that false report, of thy surmised Tragedie. They that would make these men to seeme, as not her Highnesse foes: O Lorde it is a world to see, the fayned fraude of those. For when as Campion had presumde, to challenge a dispute: His craftie cloake was soone pulde off, Learning did him confute. Albeit his cauilles, skornes and coyle, he bare with shamelesse face: Yet trueth pulde off his craftie vayle, and shewed his wretched case. So that although they did withstand, eche cause of right and reason: Yet Iustice soone found out the depth, of their most wicked treason. Iustice perceiu'd, how vnder cloake, of their Religion: They comprehended trayterous guile, and false sedition. Iustice perceyued howe they sought, within their natiue Soyle: To mooue rebellion and debate, to worke our secrete spoyle. Iustice perceyued how the Pope, with forraine Princes might: Would vse our England as him pleasde, and put our Queene from right. Howe that these men were sent before, by his perswasion: To make all ready gainst the tyme, of his inuasion. So that destruction suddenlie, should come vpon vs all: Those onely sau'd, had holie Graynes, or could the watch woord call. All this did Iustice playne discerne, with many matters more: Where through they had the iust desart, that they deseru'd therefore. God saue Elizabeth our Queene, God sende her happie raigne: And after earthlie Honours heere, the heauenlie ioyes to gaine. And all that seeke her secrete harme, or to annoy her Grace: God turne their hearts, or that they may, enioy but lyttle space. FINIS. Anthony Munday. Honos alit Artes.</field>
