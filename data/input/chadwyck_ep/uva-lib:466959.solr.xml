      <field name="fulltext">THE GREAT PEACE-MAKER. âSlumbrous immensity that knows no bounds, (Since my great depths are hidden from myself), And hoary age, uncounted by the links Of man's brief generations,âthese are mine, Alone of earth's prime elements; and thus, In contemplation of the moving spheres That shine upon my bosom, I repose, Murmuring of ancient Gods and Phantoms pale, Primordial rulers of the elder worldâ Majestical Annihilations, now.â While thus in solemn monologue, the Sea Brooded on twilight times, there slowly rose A crest that wore a pallid diadem Above two cave-like eyes, that, seeming blind, Shot ever and anon a lightning ray From out the darknessâpiercing the far spaceâ Then all again in darkness. A form appeared, Of length voluminous, like the swarthy train Of some stupendous serpent, wise and old, Which rolled its coils with measured energy, And noiseless as a shadow o'er the grass, Unto the brink of the impending cliff, And, with its head outstretched, peered gravely down, Scanning the wonders of the heaving main. Again the Sea in cavernous murmurs spake:â âWhat freights and hopes my fierce uplifting storms Have scattered into spots of drifting foam, O Memory forbear to chronicle; For I have borne a large allotted share In old Destruction's work, and fain would sink Within myself, no more to make response To winds, or thunders, or the voice of Death, But sweep into a silence and a dream, Listening the hush of mine eternity.â The Serpent-form that o'er the beetling cliff Peered down with earnest speculative head, Lower and lower, now in slow descent Glode softly, while the volumed train that lay Athwart the upper fields moved, as it seemed, By fitful glancing lights that urged it on: Meantime the Sea still held its solemn theme. âBut rest unbroken and immortal calm Are not for me; my destiny involves Tempest and shipwreck and the waste of life, With terror and despair for those at home. I am the element whom none profane By social teachings and a useful aim, Sacred alike from consort with mankind, And man's domestic vassals, Earth and Fire, Which do his bidding constantly, and live Subdued beside him by a master-hand, Which puts them to all services and ends.â Now, while the Sea held commune with itself, Softly the Telegraphic coil unwound, And, fold by fold, moved gliding down the cliff, And underneath the waves. The bottom reached, Onward it swerved with undulating line, But course determined; and its hollow eyes, That showed no light nor vision, led the way, By spirit instinctive, while the train moved on, Through the dark silence of the abysmal sea. Again old Ocean spake:â âMan ploughs and sows, And penetrates the bowels of the Earth For mines and treasure; likewise measuring Her periods and the changes of her rocks, Above, and deep beneath. I know no change, Master, or measurer, companion, friend; Like the sublime old Heavens, I dwell alone, Apart from alteration through all timesâ Apart from man's intrusion, who but dares, In his frail bark, at mercy of the winds, The thin foam-surface of my empery To skim. But what is this?âA Shape unknown Moves through my lowest depths. Say, what art thou?âTHE TELEGRAPH. I am the instrument of man's desire To hold communion with his fellow man, In distant fieldsâin other climes afarâ Swifter than flight of migratory birdâ Nay, swift almost as speech from mouth to mouth. THE SEA. Man hath his ships, and on my surface holds Permission to appear; but for my depths, They have been sacred evermore. Depart! THE TELEGRAPH. Slow are his ships, O Sea, when wind and sail Propel, and e'en the engines that surpass All sails, are tedious when compared with me. Thou measurest not thy being by its time; But men are children of a varying span; Their life is made of years, their years of days, And every day to them built up of hours, Which gives them all the hold they have on earth, To do and suffer. THE SEA. 'Tis their destiny: Seek not by science to disturb the law Which framed humanity, and meted out Its time and space. Return, and climb the rock. THE TELEGRAPH. But science also is man's destinyâ Whereby 'tis granted to his working brain, His industry, his patience and resolve, To change his old relations with the law Of space and time; henceforth dependent made On man's advance in knowledge, and the power Of using knowledge. THE SEA. Till perchance his mind, Grown mad with its ambition and success, This strange encroachment on my solemn depths May seek to raise into some mastery Over my realm; wherefore, O Serpent-shape, Turn back, lest I uprend thee, and aloft Send drifting like a wreck of ropes, till cast By my indignant waves upon the strand, To rot amidst the weeds. THE TELEGRAPH. Awhile forbear, Great nurse and cradle of the infant Earth! Nor scorn man's efforts at a natural growth, Which in some distant age may hope to find Maturity, if not perfection. THE SEA. Speak: I am no friend to the busy insect manâ Nor yet his foe. His white sail comethâgoethâ His engines with the long black train of clouds, Pass and repass. So let them. To my vastness, The surfaces they traverse are as lines Of spider-work against the moving sky. I scarce observe their presence;âtherefore speak: But pause while speakingâfor I well observe That never hast thou ceased to glide along While holding parley. THE TELEGRAPH. Wondrous is my power, And certain in its action; but, O Sea, I must lie humbly underneath thy throne, Accordant with thy laws; therefore, I pray, Be patient of my progress, and receive This justifying creed of human hopes. THE SEA. My caverns hear thee, but perchance the sands May be thine only chronicle;âerased With the next tide. THE TELEGRAPH. Let my words be erased When they have done their work. THE SEA. Slumber comes o'er meâ But in my visions shall thy voice be heard. THE TELEGRAPH. In ages past, the sovereigns of the earth Held human lives as dust beneath their feet, And neighbouring nations born but to be made Their tributary vassals; distant lands, Having thy broad arm thrown between, appeared As barbarous,âworthy conquest, or contempt, Long devastating wars, or all the scorn That ignorance could breed. The earth was then A feasting place and footstool for its kings. The kings endowed the soldiers and the priests, Those with their golden garbâwith fruitful fields The others; both becoming thus a power Within a power, and all cementing close Despotic thrones. The People, body and mind, Subdued like metal cast in sandy moulds, Not knowing their own strength, or being weak By ignorance, and lack of rational will, So that they starved not, question'd not the right Of aught, as ordered by these heaven-sent kings, With their strong armies and their banded priests. Whereof it came, that nation thought of nation, Not as a part of the great family Of human kind, but, mainly, as a horde Fit to be slaughtered, plundered, hated, scornedâ Belied in daily speech, and history. Such thoughts and deeds have with those ages passed, And nation knowing nation by the truth,â By actual presence, and familiar words, Spoken or written, will have eyes less prone To see the red necessity of war, Save as a brain-disease of knaves and fools, Nor lend a ready ear to statesmen's tricks, Hatching an insult or alarm of foes, Dispersing thus at home men's active thoughts O'er all their groaning needs and social wrongs. THE SEA. The shadows deepen as the sun departs, And light sinks deeper with his higher rise: So with man's mind as ignorance enfolds, Or knowledge flows forth brighter and more wide; Thus wouldst thou sayâbut what is man to me? THE TELEGRAPH. Thy fellow-being here; on thee dependent For mighty aidsâso far inferior; Yet ranking higher in the eye of God: The soul hath nobler elements than thine. THE SEA. Fear'st thou no tempest?âknow'st thou not one swathe Of my great waters can destroy thee? THE TELEGRAPH. Yes:â But also do I know thy vastness cannot With petty vengeance, and with watchful spleens Accord, nor change the habit of its depths. Destroy me therefore, and again I comeâ Again, and yet againâtill, rolling over, Thou slumberest at my presence.â Yet, once more, Hear me, O Sea! nor scorn the denizens Of thy fair sister Earth, for that in sooth Were but to imitate their own bad deeds Of early times. Large are their debts to thee; The chief, thy means of passage to far lands, From ancient dates; in our own day, the means Of thought-swift messengers beneath thy waves, Till England whispers India in the ear, Americaânorth, southâfrom pole to poleâ And words of friendship may pass round the world Between the dawn and noon. THE SEA. But despotismâ The bondmen and their mastersâhow of these? THE TELEGRAPH. O, well I know that Science will become The new auxiliary of armies:âkings, Leagued 'gainst the people, watchfully prepare All great appliances to guard their thrones, And keep the spirit of Liberty in check, Or crush it into âorder;â clear 'tis seen, That for the people's service and chief good, The aid of commerce and man's common weal, I am not sought by all, but that as swift As fly my lightnings, king may call to king, Asking advice or aid, or giving note Of danger. Feel I not through my quick nerves, How Prussia vibrates into Austria's hand?â And both shoot trembling sparks to the grim eye O' the night-black double eagle of the North, While the Republican Phantom fluctuates, As either moves my wires and passes word O'er lands, 'neath waters, through the forest dark, Till Freedom, like a fly, is all enmeshed. The rest is understood. But, O, vain care, Deep self-deception of short-sighted kings! For though strong armies at an instant called By me, may hurry into foreign landsâ NorthâSouthâEastâWestâman owns one kindred blood;â Knowledge has been before themâfriendship too; By free and daily intercourse of peace, The spirit of human brotherhood has found, And will hereafter find with tenfold force, Its natural sympathy in distant hearts, And war's old beldame prelude, of a witch Sent forth to poison minds and fire the blood With lies and causeless wrath, shall never more Find credence, nor the nations fail to see That slaughtering wars for some decayed great House,â The statesman's idol, or his instrumentâ Some blunder, vanity, or wild desire,â A royal chess-game of the ignorant pastâ Are not a people's will, or choice, nor have A people's sympathy, but rather hate, And loathing, and revulsion from the wounds Of memoryâthe prodigal waste of life, And grinding taxes lasting for an ageâ A mockery to reason. Some great warâ War, for once, noble, necessary, right, And never ceasing till the work's complete And broadly permanent,âthen we may see How knowledge puts down murder. Glory's foodâ Slaughters and annexationsâended quite, Let Glory famish o'er its empty crown,â The starved and accursed Skeleton set up, A monument and warning for all time! The day will comeâwe cannot see the hour, Nor can we measure all the tides of blood Shed by Imperial Alliances; But come it must, or man deserve to be A trampled slave, unpitied even by God, Who gave him power, as palpable as light, To will itâand be free. Wherefore, I pray, O mighty Sea, now that my head hath reached The opposite shore, that I may lie and work Beneath thy watery world, and be the means Of peace on earth, and of good-will to men. THE SEA. Hast thou of this one single sign secureâ One proof of general human brotherhood? The peoples are as kings without their crowns. THE TELEGRAPH. None yet, indeed;ânor yet do I discern What changes centuries may work in thee,â Not in thine elements, but thy domainâ Its landward movements and its shifting depths, Its creatures, and the fires beneath thy throne Which may uplift thy frantic empery, Dispersed amidst heaven's vapour; and ere this, Man may by favour of thy constant tides Find a new motive-power for works of peace. Man needs more timeâtime ere he can attain The reasonable pitch of present hopes, The first fruition of his soul's desire. THE SEA. Can man, the creature of a day, look forth Into the illimitable future?â THE TELEGRAPH. No:â But man is born with an aspiring sense That seeks invisible shores. THE SEA. Through Death's long night! THE TELEGRAPH. O, spiritual morning of the world, When wilt thou dawn?âThe shadows of all life Lie thick around the paths of destiny; The burthens, and the wounds, and waste of toil, The inward-bleeding tears of the tried heart, The steady purpose, and the anguished end, The will unconquered, but old age compelled To stand up in his grave, and presently To lie down, and become, in turn, mere soil For other graves,âall this must surely be. Yet, none the less, as constant victories prove, Shall man's predominant transilient race Toil on, believing something great in store, Since nothing retrogrades, and nought is lost. THE SEA. Child of the hour!âchild of the passing dust,â The busy insect with the aspiring brain,â Whose dust yet feeds my solid sister Earth, Take thy dark course, forgetting not my laws, Which equally may aid thee, or destroy, According to thy knowledge, and the fate That oft befals such knowledge.â Speak no more! The ebbing and the flowing of the life Of man's progressing mind perchance may lead To some superior state, while I remain Slumbering beneath the stars. What God permits I dare not hinder,âtherefore keep thy place: And when I roll my surging prayers to heaven, They shall remember man, and his good works.</field>
