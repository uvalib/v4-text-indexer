      <field name="fulltext">VOL. I. THE ROMAN. A DRAMATIC POEM. SCENE I. A Plain in Italy—an ancient Battle-field. Time, Evening. Persons.—Vittorio Santo, a Missionary of Freedom. He has gone out, disguised as a Monk, to preach the Unity of Italy, the Overthrow of Austrian Domination, and the Restoration of a great Roman Republic.——A number of Youths and Maidens, singing as they dance. ‘The Monk’ is musing. Enter Dancers. Dancers. Sing lowly, foot slowly, oh why should we chase The hour that gives heaven to this earthly embrace? To-morrow, to-morrow, is dreary and lonely; Then love as they love who would live to love only! Closer yet, eyes of jet,—breasts fair and sweet! No eyes flash like those eyes that flash as they meet! Weave brightly, wear lightly, the warm-woven chain, Love on for to-night if we ne'er love again. Fond youths! happy maidens! we are not alone! Bright steps and sweet voices keep pace with our own. Love-lorn Lusignuolo, the soft-sighing breeze, The rose with the zephyr, the wind with the trees. While Heaven, blushing pleasure, is full of love-notes, Soft down the sweet measure the fairy world floats. The Monk advances, meets the Dancers, and points to the turf at their feet. The Monk. Do you see nothing there, There, where the unrespective grass grows green, There at your very feet? Nay, not one step! 'Twould touch it! 'twould profane it! Palsied be The limb that treads that ground! There is a grave— There is a grave;—I saw it with these eyes— A grave! I saw it with these eyes! It holds— It holds—oh Heaven!—my mother! One of the Revellers. Peace, good Padre, Look to thy beads. The turf is level here. Comrades! strike up! ‘Sing lowly, foot——’ The Monk. Who steps, Steps first on me. I say there is a grave, I say it is my mother's: that I loved her, Ay, loved her with more passion than the maddest Lover among ye clasps his one-day wife! And I steal forth to keep my twilight vigil, And you come here to dance upon my heart. You come and—with the world at will for dalliance, The whole hot world—deny me that small grave Whose bitter margin these poor knees know better Than your accustom'd feet the well-worn path To your best harlot's bower. The turf is fair! Have I not kept it green with tears, my mother? You lustful sons of lax-eyed lewdness, do you Come here to sing above her bones, and mock me, Because my flesh and blood cry out, ‘God save them?’ May the Heaven's blight—— One of the Revellers. Nay, holy father, nay, We would not harm thee. Be it as thou wilt. Holy Madonna! there is little dust In this old land, but has been son or mother In its own day. What ho! my merry friends, Come, we must dance upon some other grave. Farewell, good father! Another Reveller. Save you, father! Another. Think not, We would insult thy sorrow. The Monk. Well, forgive me. I pray you listen how I loved my mother, And you will weep with me. She loved me, nurst me, And fed my soul with light. Morning and Even Praying, I sent that soul into her eyes, And knew what Heaven was though I was a child. I grew in stature, and she grew in goodness. I was a grave child; looking on her taught me To love the beautiful: and I had thoughts Of Paradise, when other men have hardly Look'd out of doors on earth. (Alas! alas! That I have also learn'd to look on earth When other men see heaven.) I toil'd, but ever As I became more holy, she seem'd holier; Even as when climbing mountain-tops the sky Grows ampler, higher, purer as ye rise. Let me believe no more. No, do not ask me How I repaid my mother. O thou saint, That lookest on me day and night from heaven And smilest, I have given thee tears for tears, Anguish for anguish, woe for woe. Forgive me If, in the spirit of ineffable penance, In words, I waken up the guilt that sleeps. Let not the sound afflict thine heaven, or colour That pale, tear-blotted record which the angels Keep of my sins. We left her. I and all The brothers that her milk had fed. We left her— And strange dark robbers, with unwonted names, Abused her! bound her! pillaged her! profaned her! Bound her clasped hands, and gagg'd the trembling lips That pray'd for her lost children. And we stood And she knelt to us, and we saw her kneel, And look'd upon her coldly and denied her! Denied her in her agony—and counted Before her sanguine eyes the gold that bought Her pangs. We stood—— One of the Revellers. Nay, thou cowl'd ruffian! hold! There's vengeance for thee yet! Dost thou come here To blast our hearing with thy damned crimes? Seize on him, comrades, tear him limb from limb! The Monk. Yes, seize him! tear him! tear him! he will bless thee If thy device can work a deeper pain Than he will welcome and has suffer'd. Tear him! But, friends, not yet. Hear her last tortures. Then Find, if ye can, some direr pang for me. The Robbers wearied, and they bade us hold her, Lest her death-struggles should get free. She look'd Upon me with the face that lit my childhood, She called me with the voices of old times, She blest me in her madness. But, they show'd us Gold, and we seized upon her, held her, bound her, Smote her. She murmur'd kind words, and I gave her Blows. One Auditor. Fiend! Another. Hound! Another. Demon! Another. Strike him! Another. Hold him down! Kill him for hours! The Monk. Why how now, countrymen? How now, you slaves that should be Romans? Ah! And you will kill me that I smote my mother? Well done, well done, a righteous doom! I smote My mother? Hold! My mother, did I say? My mother? Mine, yours, ours! One Auditor. Seize him. All. Die, liar! Die. The Monk. But my brothers—will you seize my brothers? What! will you let that cursed band escape That hoard the very gold that slew her? Make A full end. Finish up the work. You cowards! What! you can pounce on an unarm'd poor man, But tremble at the gilded traitors! All. Name them! They shall die! Point them out! where are they? The Monk. Here! You are my brothers. And my mother was Yours. And each man among you day by day Takes, bowing, the same price that sold my mother, And does not blush. Her name is Rome. Look round, And see those features which the sun himself Can hardly leave for fondness. Look upon Her mountain bosom, where the very sky Beholds with passion: and with the last proud Imperial sorrow of dejected empire, She wraps the purple round her outraged breast, And even in fetters cannot be a slave. Look on the world's best glory and worst shame. You cannot count her beauties or her chains, You cannot know her pangs or her endurance. You, whom propitious skies may hardly coax To threescore years and ten. Your giant fathers Call'd Atlas demigod. But what is she, Who, worn with eighteen centuries of bondage, Stands manacled before the world, and bears Two hemispheres—innumerable wrongs, Illimitable glories. Oh, thou heart That art most tortured, look on her and say If there be any thing in earth or heaven, In earth or heaven—now that Christ weeps no longer— So most divinely sad. Look on her. Listen To all the tongues with which the earth cries out. Flowers, fountains, winds, woods, spring and summer incense, Morning and eve—these are her voices—hear them! Remember how, in the old innocent days Of your young childhood, these sang blessings on you. Remember how you danced to those same voices, And sank down tired, and slept in joy, not doubting That they would sing to-morrow; and remember How when some hearts that danced in those old days, And worn out laid them down, and have not waken'd, Gave back no answer to the morning sun, She took them to her mother's breast and still Holds them unweary, singing by their slumbers, And though you have forgotten them remembers To strew their unregarded graves with flowers. Oh those old days, those canonizèd days! Oh that bright realm of sublunary heaven, Wherein they walk'd in haloes of sweet light, And we look'd up, unfearing, and drew near And learnt of them what no succeeding times Can tell us since of joy;—for so, being angels, They suffer'd little children. Oh those days! Why is it that we hear them now no more? And the same destiny that brought us pangs Took every balsam hence? Did we wake up From infancy's last slumber in a new And colder world? My mother, thou shalt answer! I hear thee—see thee. The same soul informs The present that look'd once through undimm'd eyes In Childhood's past. What though it shines through tears? It shines. What though it speaks with trembling lips, Tuned to such grief that they say bright words sadly? It speaks. And by that speech thou art the mother That bore us! Oh you sons of hers, remember When joy had grown to passion, and high youth Had aim'd the shafts that lay in Childhood's quiver, If you have ever gone out, (and each Roman Heart must have note of one such better day,) Full of high thoughts, ambitions, destinies, And stood, downcast, among her ruin'd altars, And fed the shameful present with the past; And felt thy soul on the stern food grow up To the old Roman stature: and hast started To feel a hundred nameless things, which Kings Call sins,—and Patriots, virtues: and self-judged, Conscious and purple with the glorious treason, Hast lifted flashing eyes, bold with great futures, And in one glance challenged her earth, seas, skies, And they have said, ‘Well Done.’ And thou hast felt Like a proud child whom a proud mother blesses. Ah! your brows kindle! What! I have said well? What! there are some among you who have been The heroes of an hour? you men of Parma, What! you were Romans once! you worse than slaves, Who, being Romans once, are men of Parma! Tried on the Roman habit, and could wear it But a short hour on your degenerate limbs! Sons of the empress of the world, and slaves To powers a Roman bondman would not count Upon his fingers on a holiday! Do not believe me yet. She is no mother, Who has but nursed your joy and pride. Remember, If thou hast ever wept without a heart To catch one tear, and in the lonely anguish Of thy neglected agony look'd out On this immortal world, and seen—love-stricken— Light after light her shadowy joys take up Thy lorn peculiar sorrow, till thy soul Seem'd shed upon the universe, and grief, Deponent of its separate sadness, clung To the stupendous dolour of all things, And wept with the great mourner, and smiled with her When she came back to sunshine—with the joy Of a young child after the first great grief Wherein a mother's holy words first spake To the young heart of God. But I am dreaming; You have not wept as I have. Yet remember, If she hath shown you softer signs than these— If there are none among you who have given To her chaste beauty, to the woods and mountains, And lone dim places, sorrowfully sweet, Where love first learns to hear himself, and blush not— Thoughts which you would deny me at confession, Thoughts which, although the peril of a soul Hung on their utterance, would have gone unborn In silence down to hell, unblest, unshriven, And, in despairing coyness, daring all, Because they could dare nothing. Like the shy Scared bird, to which the serpent's jaws are better Than his rude eyes. And yet you gave them to her, And these same trembling phantasies went forth, To meet the storms that shake the Apennines, And did not fear. And so you call'd her mother, And so the invisible in you confest The unseen in her; and so you bore your witness To her august maternity, and she Reflected back the troth. Remember, so Great Romulus and those who after him Built the Eternal City, and their own Twin-born eternity—even as the workman Is greater than the work—stood at her knee, And brighten'd in her blessing; and remember If they were sons like you! What! can dead names Stir living blood? Fear not, my countrymen! They are not German chieftains that I spoke of. Tremble not, brethren, they are not our lords. Our lords! they conquered men. They are some souls That once took flesh and blood in Italy, And thought it was a land to draw free breath in, And drew it long, and died here; and since live Everywhere else. What! your brows darken! what! I wrong'd you foully; 'twas no fear that daubed them: What! your cheeks flush as some old soldier's child, Glows at inglorious ease when a chance tongue Speaks of the triumph where his father fell! What then! these dead are yours! Men, what are they? What are they?—ask the world and it shall answer. And you? True, true, you have your creed; you tell me That twice a thousand years have not outworn The empire in that blood of theirs that flows In your dull veins. You tell me you are Romans! Yet they were lords and you are slaves; the earth Heard them and shook. It shakes, perchance, for you; Shakes with the laugh of scorn that there are things Who lick the dust that falls from Austrian feet, And call the gods their fathers! Bear with me, I am not here to reckon up your shames, I will know nothing here but my wrong'd mother. I cry before heaven she is yours. That you May kill me for the part I bore, and then Do judgment on yourselves. Look on that mother Whose teeming loins peopled with gods and heroes Earth and Olympus—sold to slaves whose base Barbarian passions had been proud to swell In death a Roman pageant. Every limb Own'd by some separate savage—each charm lent To some peculiar lust. The form that served The world for signs of beauty parcell'd out A carcase on the shambles, where small kings, Like unclean birds, hang round the expected carrion, And chaffer for the corpse which shall not die! Look on that mother and behold her sons! Alas, she might be Rome if there were Romans! Look on that mother! Wilt thou know that death Can have no part in Beauty? Cast to-day A seed into the earth, and it shall bear thee The flowers that waved in the Egyptian hair Of Pharaoh's daughter! Look upon that mother— Listen, ye slaves, who gaze on her distress, And turn to dwell with clamorous descant, And prying eye, on some strange small device Upon her chains. In no imperial feature, In no sublime perfection, is she less Than the world's empress, the earth's paragon, Except these bonds. These bonds? Break them. Unbind, Unbind Andromeda! She was not born To stand and shiver in the northern blast, Or fester on a foreign rock, or bear Rude licence of the unrespective waves. She is a queen! a goddess! a king's daughter! What though her loveliness defied the heavens; Unbind her, she shall fill them! Man, unbind her, And, goddess as she is, she owns thee, loves thee, Crowns thee! And is there none to break thy chains, My country? Is there none, sons of my mother? Strike, and the spell is broken. You behold her Suppliant of suppliants. Strike! and she shall stand Forth in her awful beauty, more divine Than death or mortal sorrow; clothing all The wrecks and ruins of disastrous days In old-world glory—even as the first spring After the deluge. Why should we despair? The heroes whom your fathers took for gods, Walk'd in her brightness, and received no more Than she gives back to you, who are not heroes, And have not yet been men. They toil'd and bled, And knew themselves immortal, when they hung Their names upon her altars; ask'd no fate But that which you inherit and disdain To call it heritage—subdued the world, And with superior scorn heard its lip-service, And bade it call them Romans, and believe Earth had no haughtier name. Be not deceived. They stood on Roman, you on Parman ground, But yet this mould is the same ground they stood on. The evening wind, that passes by us now, To their proud senses was the evening wind. These are the hills, and these the plains, whereby The Roman shepherd fed his golden flocks, And kings look'd from their distant lands, and thought him Greater than they. The masters of the world Heard the same streams that speak to you, its slaves. These rocks were their rocks, and their Roman spring Brought, year by year, the very self-same blossoms, (The self-same blossoms, but they stood for crowns.) The flowers beneath their feet had the same perfume As those you tread on—do they scorn your tread? They saw your stars; and when the sun went down, The mountains on his face set the same signs To their eyes as to yours. O thou unseen Rome of their love,—immaculate and free! Thou who didst sit amid the Apennines, And looking forth upon the conscious world, Which heard thee and obey'd, beheld thy children From sea to sea! Yes, we are here, my mother, And here beside thy mountain throne we call thee, Ascend, thou uncrown'd queen! Yet a few days, Yet a few days, and all is past. Behold Even now, the harvest seedeth, and the ear Bends rich with death. Yet a few days, my mother, And thou shalt hear the shouting of the reapers, And we who sharp the sickle shall ring out The harvest-home. Nay, look not on me, mother, Look not on me in thy sublime despair; Thou shalt be free! I see it all, my mother, Thy golden fetters, thy profanèd limbs, Thy toils, thy stripes, thine agonies, thy scars, And thine undying beauty. Yes, all, all, And all for us and by us. Look not on me. Ay! lift thy canker'd hands to heaven, earth hath not Room for so vast a wrong. Thou shalt be free, Thou shalt be free, before the heavens I swear it! By thy long agony, thy bloody sweat, Thy passion of a thousand years, thy glory, Thy pride, thy shame, thy worlds subdued and lost, Thou shalt be free! By thine eternal youth, And co-eternal utterless dishonour— Past, present, future, life and death, all oaths, Which may bind earth and heaven, mother, I swear it. We know we have dishonour'd thee. We know All thou canst tell the angels. At thy feet, The feet where kings have trembled, we confess, And weep; and only bid thee live, my mother, To see how we can die. Thou shalt be free! By all our sins, and all thy wrongs we swear it. We swear it, mother, by the thousand omens That heave this pregnant time. Tempests for whom The Alps lack wombs—quick earthquakes—hurricanes That moan and chafe, and thunder for the light, And must be native here. Hark, hark, the angel! I see the birthday in the imminent skies! Clouds break in fire. Earth yawns. The exulting thunder Shouts havoc to the whirlwinds. And men hear, Amid the terrors of consenting storms, Floods, rocking worlds, mad seas and rending mountains, Above the infinite clash, one long great cry, Thou shalt be free! [The audience have one by one stolen away. The Monk, recovering from his enthusiasm, finds himself alone. The Monk. Ah solitude! and have I Raved to the winds? [A pause. Bow not thy queenly head, Beat not thy breast; they do not leave thee, mother! We have no strength to meet the offended terrors Of thy chaste eyes. Yet a few days, my mother, And when the fire of expiation burns, Thou shalt confess thy children. Oh, bear with us, Hath the set sun forsaken thee? We know All that thou art, and we are: and if, mother, The unused weight of the ineffable knowledge Bendeth our souls, forgive us. [Another long pause. Yes, all gone! And not one word—one pitiful cheap word— One look that might have brighten'd into promise! All faint, pale, recreant, slavish, lost. No cur That sniffs the distant bear, and sneaks downcast With craven tail and miscreant trepidation To kennel and to collar, could slink home With a more prone abasement. [Another long pause. Kill me! kill me! Thine hour is not yet come. Then give me mine! Thou must endure, my mother, I have taken A meteor for the dawn. Thou must endure, And toil, and weep. Oh, thou offended majesty! my heart Beats here for thee. Strike it! Thou must endure. I may not, at the peril of my soul, Give thee aught other counsel; and I would not For many souls that any man should dare To give thee this and live. Alas! when truth Is treason, and the crime of what we do Transcends all sins but the more damning guilt Of doing aught beside. [Another pause. Or is it, mother, That thou hast chosen ill? That I, the dreamer, Catch not the language of these waking men? With our humanity infirm upon us, My God! it is a fearful thing to stand Alone, beneath the weight of a great cause And a propitious time! [Another pause. Mother! [A long pause. Be patient, O thou eternal and upbraiding Presence, Which fillest heaven and earth with witness; be What thou hast been: and, if thou canst, forgive What I can not forgive; and let me be What I was. Take, take back this terrible sight! This sight that passeth the sweet boundary Of man's allotted world. Let me look forth And see green fields, hills, trees, and soulless waters Give back my ignorance. Why should my sense Be cursed with this intolerable knowledge? Let me go back to bondage. What am I, That I am tortured to supernal uses, Who have not died; and see the sights of angels With mortal eyes? Unhand me, mother! why Must I, so many years removed from death, Be young and have no youth? What have I done That all thy millions look on thee with smiles, And I with madness? Why must I be great? When did I ask this boon? Why is the dull, Smooth, unctuous current of contented baseness Forbidden to me only? What art thou, Magician! that who serves thee hath henceforth No part on earth beside? That I am doom'd— Am doom'd to preach in unknown tongues, and know What no man will believe? To strive, and weep, And labour with impossible griefs and woes, That kill me in the birth? That I am thus, That I am thus, who once was calm, proud, happy,— Ay, you may smile, you ancient sorrows,—happy. Stay! happy? And a slave? [A very long pause. If I must see thee, If it must be, if it must be, my mother! If it must be, and God vouchsafes the heart No gift to unlearn truth; if the soul never Can twice be virgin? if the eye that strikes Upon the hidden path to the unseen Is henceforth for two worlds; if the sad fruit Of knowledge dwells for ever on the lip, And if thy face once seen, to me, O thou Unutterable sadness! must henceforth Look day and night from all things; grant me this, That thine immortal sorrow will remember How little we can grieve who are but dust. Make me the servant, not the partner, mother, Of woes, for whose omnipotence of pain I have no organs. Suffer that I give Time and endurance for impossible passion; Perchance accumulated pangs may teach me One throe of thy distress. How canst thou think My soul can contain thine? SCENE II. Time and Place as in Scene I. Francesca, a young girl, one of the Auditors in Scene I., has remained hidden among the trees. The Monk, silent, musing. Francesca (musing). While he yet spake I waited for a pause, And now, if I could dare to hear my voice In this most awful silence, it should pray That he would speak again. You heavens, you heavens, Lend me your language. This progressive thought, This unit-bearing speech, whose best exertion Is but dexterity, the juggler's sleight, That with facility of motion cheats The eye, whose noblest effort can but haste The single ball of phantasy, and make Succession seem coincidence, is not For such an hour. Lend me some tongue, you heavens, Worthy of gods: in whose celestial sense The present, past, and future of the soul Sink down as one; even as these dews to-night Fall from a thousand stars. He hears. He turns. Now, now, ye saints! The Monk (turning and perceiving her). Lady, what wouldst thou? [She is silent. Child, What wouldst thou? Francesca. I have heard thee. Dost thou ask? The Monk (pointing to the dancers in the far distance). Did they not hear? Daughter, persuade me this, And I will bless thee. Francesca (taking a flower from her breast). Is that rosebud sweet? luck'd it from a thicket as I pass'd; One day, perhaps, some cottage plot; but now Given up to dominance of vulgar thorns, And weeds of deadlier moral. Yet methinks 'Tis still a rose. Wilt thou receive it? The Monk. Ay. Francesca. I am that rose, my father, so accept Me. The Monk. Child, I will. Francesca. I have heard much to-night Of Roman deeds, of sages, and of heroes, Of sons who loved, and sons who have betray'd. Hath Rome no daughters to repeat her beauty, Renew the model of old time, and teach Her sons to love the mother in the child? Was Rome, my father, built and peopled by One sex? The very marble of your ruins Looks masculine. In heart I roam about them, But whereso'er my female soul peers in —Even to the temple courts—some bearded image Cries Privilege. Doth Salique law entail The heritage of glory? Is there nothing, Nothing, my father, in the work of freedom For woman's hand to do? The Monk. The past, that book Of demonstrated theorems, lies open. Why seek my poor unproved hypothesis, When God hath solved for thee? Child, choose thy page. Here bleeds Lucretia. Rome hath now ten Tarquins (Ten Tarquins, but we call them dukes and kings). There, Arria. Many a Pætus lives to-night Who would have given right joyfully to freedom The Roman heart that makes a sorry slave, If Arria would have shown him how to die. Virginia! Appius—nay, we have no state Where Appius would have deign'd to be a despot. But that divine idea incarnate in Virginia's corse, and teeming in the blood Which quickening in your Roman ground grew up A national virginity—that glory, Though it reach up to heaven, may make its footstool Wherever there is earth enough to die on. Remember her who—— Francesca. Hear me yet, my father, And I will light thee to a sterner text Than thou hast heart to preach from. Yonder castle Darkening the hill—— The Monk. Child, the days come when where The deadliest stronghold of its lordliest keep Spreads the dank flags, tear-damp, of its most dark Detested dungeon, thou—not I—shalt see The wild thyme and the bee. Francesca. Is there nought writ Of Tullia, who once drove the car of blood Over her father's corse? Sir, from those walls My father rules. The Monk (after some silence). Shall Paul stop preaching lest Eutychus sleep? In the Damascene way Shall his eyes shut out light from heaven? Not though It scorch them blind! Truth is a god, my child; Rear thou the altar, he himself provides The lamb. The great judge, Truth, who takes thy verdict, Avenges a false finding though it save Thy brother's soul. Truth is the equal sun, Ripening no less the hemlock than the vine. Truth is the flash that turns aside no more For castle than for cot. Truth is a spear Thrown by the blind. Truth is a Nemesis Which leadeth her belovèd by the hand Through all things; giving him no task to break A bruisèd reed, but bidding him stand firm Though she crush worlds. Francesca. Master! I would serve Truth. The Monk (meditates, then speaks). Oh Freedom! ruddy goddess of the hill, Say, from that breezy ledge of genial rock, Where, yet ere twilight, with thine eastward face Turn'd to to-morrow's sunrise, thou hast laid Thy joyous limbs, dew-bathed—which day scarce tames To sleep—oh say, is this pale dreamer thine? home, poor child, thou hast thy burden; I Add nothing. Francesca. Thou canst speak in parables, Or with stern silence stifle the poor heart That breathes thy words; but, father, I will sit Here at thy feet. The Monk. So does my dog; but do I Take him to council? Francesca. Yet thou givest him To watch thee day and night. Grant me no less. The Monk. Oh tyrant's daughter, lovest thou Roman thus? Francesca. Ay. The Monk (musing). Can the heart be less than what it holds? The fetter'd slave that in his fetters slays His lord, has strength to break them. Arms that break Their chains have strength to throw them in the sea. Perchance I have judged ill. Yes. Unattaint, Perchance, the Arethusan blood of Rome Hath coursed the conduit of a tyrant's veins, And from the fetid entrails of the earth Springs up Diana's fountain. Soul, soul, soul, Wilt thou again believe? Are figs of thistles? Hast thou not tasted of the Dead-Sea fruits? The clouds are midnight with to-morrow's storm: Wilt thou launch freedom in a cockle-shell? What! Patriot, dost thou pay the gold of Rome For phantom ship to skim aërial waves Or desert mirage? Bah! what falconer Shall man this butterfly-hawk? Will that nice beak Stoop to a bloody lure? Poor child, poor child, The feeblest tongue that freemen use will deafen These ears where every word went bowing in! These pamper'd ears, born in the purple chamber Of silken state, these soft voluptuous ears, Dainty and fancy-fed, that of the tribe Of many-visaged language, know alone That bastard and emasculated speech That does court-embassies. That perfumed minion, Which runs the powder'd errands of intrigue; That slave-born slave, that audible obeisance Which on the silver plate of compliment Exchanges rotten hearts. That sleek thrice-curl'd Prim arbiter of vile proprieties, Whose wax-light days begin and end with fashion; That velvet impotent, whose effete passions Wait smiling the fantastic lusts of kings. How shall she bear the sound when a strong land In the rude health of freedom shall say Rome! Go home, girl, thou hast nought in me, nor I In thee. Francesca. Thy words stand 'twixt my home and me. The Monk. Hence! Thou shalt pass them. Freedom's sentinels Challenge no feathers. Francesca. I have heard thy fears, And fear not. Do the damn'd, my father, shrink At voice of angel? Shall not the small sense Of feeblest child sustain the crash of doom? The Monk. The day is thine. a Greek sage once, who stood in spirit Sublime beside his outraged flesh and blood, The only calm beholder. He and thou, Raw girl! have come into one heritage; He in grey hairs, weary and wise, as sage; Thou in the flush of unreflecting days, As woman. With bowed head I stand before thee, Child! teach me. Francesca. Mock me not, oh father, mock Me not. Is it so great a boon to die? The Monk. Have what thou wilt—do what thou wilt. Francesca (throwing herself at his feet). He takes me! You Heavens! he takes me. Master, Teacher, Lord! The Monk. I take thee not. Francesca. Thou canst not drive me from thee! I see it all! He would even crush the fly That hums about him. No, my father, no, I die not thus. The Monk. I take thee not, brave girl, Thy Country claims thee. That great Rome, for whom Many have fallen, but how few have died. That generous country, which, while other lands Build up their bulwarks of their children's dust, Of her best sons, in her worst need, asks only Apotheosis. Dost thou weep to exchange The mortal for the eternal? Francesca. Teach me how To serve her. The Monk. Pay her tithes of the rich love That bore thee to her feet. That love which triumph'd In victory like his of Underwalden, Who buried in his own unconquer'd breast Th' opposing spears. Francesca. Father, I am a poor Weak ignorant. Thy voice falls on my heart Like heavenly music, but alas, I know not What words they sing to it in heaven. I pray thee Give eyes to this blind trouble in my soul, Set me some task—nay, do not spare me, master, Some task at which thy bravest is not brave— Teach me some lesson, in our woman's language, Of action and endurance; I will say it, That thou shalt bless thy scholar! The Monk. Child! child! child! Thou art yet young, and foot of babe can do No sacrilege. But curb these proud beliefs, There comes a time, when holy bounds o'erstept May blast thee. Child, freedom hath sanctuaries, Wherein the chaste hands of her best high-priest Tremble to serve. Slave! merry smiling slave! Dancing an hour since to the shameful music Of thine own chains—— Francesca. Oh father, father, spare me! Make me her lowest servant—— The Monk. Child, not so. How should I judge thee? Enoch was the first, But not the last translated. To both worlds —The inner and the outer—we come naked. The very noblest heart on earth hath oft No better lot than to deserve. And yet, What laurell'd impotent shall show his head Beside that uncrown'd giant? No, my daughter, I think thou hast a place beside the throne. Behold it near the skies: the golden steps Of human toil that reach it, and the angels Ascending and descending. Wilt thou climb? Francesca. Oh father! The Monk. Let me breathe thee round the base Of the celestial steep. I have a task Such as becomes the neophyte of freedom; It shall be thine. Francesca. I clasp thy knees, my father. The Monk. Brave girl, it is a Tyro's task; a baptism That will not drown. The very holiday-work Of glory—— Francesca. May I do no nobler? The Monk. Hear it. Go forth at dawn—as they of old, go forth— Carry nor purse, nor scrip, nor shoes, salute By the way no man. Through this sad broad land, Even from the Alps to the three seas, cry out, ‘Rome is at hand!’ Francesca. Father, no more? The Monk. No more. Francesca. No word of War, Glory, Shame, Tyrants? Nothing Of this Rome's feature? The Monk. Did John Baptist know Whom he foreran? Daughter, thy chains lie there, Not two hours off. No law forbids thee wear them. Francesca. Forgive me, father, I am thine, all thine, But—nay, frown not—what if men tire of this Strange cuckoo note? The Monk. Do two hearts hear the cuckoo With the same beat? Lend me thy lute, dear girl; There was a song that in my wanderings I heard in other years. A wayward song That caught the murmur of the waterfall, By which I sang it. But no matter. 'Twill Find its way where the brawny words of manhood Might be too rude. I would, my poor disciple, I had some foot more fit than an arm'd heel To tread the dwelling of thy woman's soul. And while we commune, daughter,—for alas, A patriot militant has no to-morrows— Hear this first lesson. It may be remember'd When I am not. Stern duties need not speak Sternly. He who stood firm before the thunder, Worshipp'd the still small voice. Let the great world That bears us—the all-preaching world—instruct thee, That teacheth every man, because her precepts Are seen, not heard. Oh, worship her. Fear not Whilst thou hast open eyes, and ears for all The simplest words she saith. Deaf, blind, to these, Despair. That worst incurable, perchance Some voice may heal hereafter, but none here. For before every man, the world of beauty, Like a great artist, standeth day and night, With patient hand retouching in the heart God's defaced image. Reverence sights and sounds, ghter; be sure the wind among the trees Is whispering wisdom. Now assist me, lute. [The Monk sings—recitativo—touching the lute at intervals. There went an incense through the land one night, Through the hush'd holy land, when tired men slept.[Interlude of music. The haughty sun of June had walk'd, long days, Through the tall pastures which, like mendicants, Hung their sere heads and sued for rain: and he Had thrown them none. And now it was high hay-time. Through the sweet valley all her flowery wealth At once lay low, at once ambrosial blood Cried to the moonlight from a thousand fields. And through the land the incense went that night, Through the hush'd holy land when tired men slept. It fell upon the sage; who with his lamp Put out the light of heaven. He felt it come Sweetening the musty tomes, like the fair shape Of that one blighted love, which from the past Steals oft among his mouldering thoughts of wisdom. And she came with it, borne on airs of youth; Old days sang round her, old memorial days, She crown'd with tears, they dress'd in flowers, all faded— And the night-fragrance is a harmony All through the old man's soul. Voices of eld, The home, the church upon the village green, Old thoughts that circle like the birds of Even Round the grey spire. Soft sweet regrets, like sunset Lighting old windows with gleams day had not. Ghosts of dead years, whispering old silent names Through grass-grown pathways, by halls mouldering now. Childhood—the fragrance of forgotten fields; Manhood—the unforgotten fields whose fragrance Pass'd like a breath; the time of buttercups, The fluttering time of sweet forget-me-nots; The time of passion and the rose—the hay-time Of that last summer of hope! The old man weeps, The old man weeps. His aimless hands the joyless books put by; As one that dreams and fears to wake, the sage With vacant eye stifles the trembling taper, Lets in the moonlight—and for once is wise.[Interlude of music. There went an incense through the midnight land, Through the hush'd holy land where tired men slept. It fell upon a simple cottage child, Laid where the lattice open'd on the sky, And she look'd up and said, Those flowers the stars Smelt sweet to-night. God rest her ignorance! There went an incense through the land one night, Through the hush'd holy land when tired men slept; It pass'd above a lonely vale, and fell Upon a poet looking out for signs In heaven and earth, and went into his soul, And like a fluttering bird among sweet strings, Made strange Æolian music wild and dim. [Interlude. A haggard man, silent beneath the stars, Stood with bare head, a hasty step withdrawn From a low tattered hut, wherefrom the faint Low wail of famine, like a strange night-bird, Cried on the air. He had come forth to give His dying child, his youngest one, repose. ‘Father,’ it said, ‘you weep, I cannot die.’ There went an incense through the land that night, Through the hush'd holy land when tired men slept; It came upon his soul, and went down deep Deep to his heart, and threw the new-made hay Upon the coals of fire that ember'd there. And by the rising flame came pictures fair, Of old ancestral fields that strangers till, And patrimony that the spoiler reaps. Then falls the flame upon the pallet near, And forward on the canvas of the night, To the wild father's eye, lights up that landscape Of love and health and hope which yesterday The poorest crumbs of the oppressor's feast Might buy. Oh God! how coarse a crust may be The bread of life. He breathes the night-balm in, And breathes it back the red-hot smoke of vengeance! [Musical interlude. There was a lonely mother and one babe, —A moon with one small star in all her heaven— Too like the moon, the wan and weary moon, In pallor, beauty, all, alas! but change. Through six long months of sighs that moon unwaning Had risen and set beside the little star. And now the little star, whom all the dews Of heaven refresh not, westers to its setting, Out of the moonlight to be dark for ever. O'er the hush'd holy land where tired men sleep, There went an incense through the night. It fell Upon the mother, and she slept—the babe, It smil'd and dream'd of paradise. Thanks, listener. I am a sorry minstrel. Had my art Been echo to the nature in thy face We had heard nobler strains. Francesca (sadly). Alas! there only Is thy child false. The Monk. Ah! sighing still? Francesca. Dear father, One more forgiveness! Spirits half cast out Tear the possess'd and cry. Indulgent master, Complete thy miracle. The Monk (severely). Hath the possess'd Faith to be healed? Francesca. I could do all for love, Bleed, die for it,—even to the second death— I could, I would, I will—but to give flesh For marble; to be crush'd out of the earth By some cold image falling from the clouds! The Monk. Woman, is this a place for earthly passion? Francesca. Not passion, no, not passion. Human light In the stern idol's eyes—a heart, a pulse To sanctify the embrace—the love that throbs Belief—Oh master, master! The Monk. I am patient, Strange priestess—how long are these mysteries? Francesca (pauses). Sir, they are even now ended. I say not Whether the fire be out upon the altar, Or if the holy portals are self-closed Against unpitying eyes; but—they are ended. The Monk. Child, I have wrong'd thee. Francesca. Father, say not so. They are not wrong'd who have no rights. And what Have I before thee? The Monk. More, my daughter, more Than thou or I remembered. Do the stars Frown on us? Yet that cloud of wayward wishes The world sent up at vesper-time hangs now Fevering the heaven between their eyes and ours. Daughter, forget my sins. Fond Hector, arm'd, Smiled a paternity too terrible Even for a hero's child. The earnest soul Drawing a sword is warrior cap-a-pied, And this voice, strife-strain'd, catches ill to-night The pitch of the confessional. Brave girl, Canst thou trust twice? Francesca. Do I trust God the less For an unanswer'd prayer? Command me, master; 'Twas the Promethean madness that essay'd To warm a clay heart with celestial fire. I am content to serve. The Monk. Nay, tell me all. Francesca. Not so, my father. No, thou shalt not cross This threshold. No, thou shalt not stoop so low As to the lintel of a heart like mine! Nay, tempt me not. I have received my sorrow, And am content. The sin was too delicious For feebler retribution. But, oh, once To bear what I have borne this hour sufficeth For one life. The Monk. Thou poor trembling child, be calm. Truth, partial to her sex, made woman free Even of her inmost cell; but man walks round The outer courts, and by the auspices And divinations of the augur reason, Knows her chaste will, her voice, and habit better —With a sure science, more abstract and pure— Than ye who run by instinct to her knee. Answer me, child, perchance—— Francesca. Nay, father, nay, I am not worthy of thine auguries. I will confess. I fear'd—forgive me, father, I did fear that as there have been who flew Wild with their own inevitable shadow; The dark monotony from day to day, Of words that had no image in my brain,— Great everpresent names that stand for nothing In heaven or earth, sounds, awful, awful sounds, For shapes I cannot see, haunting my ears, Might drive me mad. Is not a whisper, father, Fearful at night? Are there not some, my father, Who have been doom'd to drag a skeleton Rattling behind them? Oh, you heavens, you heavens, I shall go mad. The Monk (musingly). Ay, child, those rank weeds, words, Exhaust the soul. Francesca. A little love, dear master, It seem'd to me if I could know and love —Though afar off—this Rome of which thou speakest, It would make life of death. The Monk. Yes, thou must love her, There must be fire from heaven or hell to burn Offerings that burnt were incense, but neglected Pollute the winds. Thou must love Rome, my daughter, As she loves thee. Francesca. Oh, can she love me? How, Oh, tell me how the mortal can win looks From the eternal? How the daughters of men Drew angels down? Alas, thou jestest, father, She—the espoused of ages—how shall I Woo her? The Monk. Even as thou makest other loves. Watch her and wait upon her; let her share Thy morn and eve, and in the sleep of noon Dream of her. Have no shame to see her by Thy bed at night, and to undress thine heart In her sad gaze. In the dull ways of men Sitting and walking lonely, let her image Be thy attendant spirit, and interpret All things into her language. Haply passing A ruin'd garden, all of broken statues, Temples o'er-turn'd, sweet haunts of love and pleasance Defiled and trodden in the outraged earth, And blossoms like the noon for radiance, trampled By foul insulting feet: while over all The appealing music of wronged solitudes, Of shades deflower'd and sanctities profaned, Hangs like a dewy exhalation—then Look up and say, My country! Wandering through The lovely ruin, if thy step should strike On some fair column; prone and moss-interr'd, Fit for a god to stand on; one of those That found amid a desert's sands alone, Should of the wealth of its one witness give Another tome to history—be reverent, Tread as thy feet were among graves—and say, My country! Or, oh prince's daughter, if In some proud street, leaning 'twixt night and day From out thy palace balcony to meet The breeze—that tempted by the hush of eve, Steals from the fields about a city's shows, And like a lost child, scared with wondering, flies From side to side in touching trust and terror, Crying sweet country names and dropping flowers— Leaning to meet that breeze, and looking down To the so silent city, if below With dress disorder'd and dishevell'd passions Streaming from desperate eyes that flash and flicker Like corpse-lights, (eyes that once were known on high, Morning and night, as welcome there as thine,) And brow of trodden snow, and form majestic That might have walk'd unchallenged through the skies, And reckless feet, fitful with wine and woe, And songs of revel that fall dead about Her ruin'd beauty—sadder than a wail— (As if the sweet maternal eve for pity Took out the joy, and, with a blush of twilight, Uncrown'd the Bacchanal)—some outraged sister Passeth, be patient, think upon yon heaven, Where angels hail the Magdalen, look down Upon that life in death and say—My country! SCENE III. The Neighbourhood of Milan, during a Popular Emeute. A great band of Insurgents, armed, and singing, pass over. The Monk stands near. All (chanting as they march). Who would drone on in a dull world like this? Heaven costs no more than a pang and a sigh; Dash off the fetters that bind us from bliss, Fair fall the freeman who foremost shall die! Death's a siesta, lads, take it who can! Wave the proud banners that wave for Milan! Chanted in song, and remember'd in story, Sunk but to rise—like the sun in the wave— Grandly the fallen shall sleep in his glory, Proudly his country thall weep at his grave, And hallow like relics each clod where there ran The blood of that hero who died for Milan! Holy his name shall be, blest by the brave and free, Kept like a saint's day the hour when he died! The mother that bore him, the maid that bends o'er him, Shall weep, but the tears shall be rich tears of pride. Shout, brothers, shout for the first falling man, Shout for the gallant that dies for Milan! Long, long years hence by the home of his truth, His fate, beaming eyes yet unborn shall bedew, Beloved of the lovely, while beauty and youth Shall give their best sighs to the brave and the true! On, spears! spur, cavaliers! Victory our van, Fame sounds the trumpet that sounds for Milan! [They pass; the Monk steps forth, and stopping some of the rearg uard, speaks. The Monk. Would you know The path of that false tyrant, who enslaved Your fetter'd land: and, with her outraged beauties Beaming upon you, made ye glad to die? Soldier. Ay, holy father. The Monk. Would you know the spot Where, in the shoutings of his maniac triumph, He calls his blood-hounds round his gory hands, And cheers them on the prey? Soldier. Since the noon-sun Shone on the flying Austrians, we have track'd them, And burn to sup as we have dined. Speak on. The Monk. If I could count you man by man, and horse By horse, and bayonet by bayonet, And point the very lurking place— Soldier. Nay, speak! The sun sinks, and Milan herself goes down With to-night's dews. Speak, speak, good father. The Monk. Fools! What! do you take me for some Austrian trull, At service of the first camp follower That sues her? Do you think I make my council Of way-side danglers? Dost betray me, fellow? Thou pale-faced German knave, if thou art aught That man may name unblushing, hence and bring me The leaders of this crew. One Soldier to another. Go fetch the captain Of the tenth troop. The Monk. Friend, fetch ten thousand captains, And march them here to march them back again; What! dost thou think Milan's great doom is meat For mouths like thine? Hence, bring your general, And bid him—as he values absolution For all that army of unshriven souls That hope to make their beds in Paradise— Appear with such attendance as befits The majesty of freedom. Hence, and tell him I can show where Milan's great foe is flagrant, And swear upon my priestly faith, this night He shall behold him! [Exit a soldier. Enter General and crowd of troops. General. Sir, and reverend father, Thou wilt forgive me if I am deceived— A straggler of our army brought—but now— An imminent commandment. Was it thine? The Monk. Mine. General. We do trust thou hast not wrong'd us, father: Each passing moment that goes by us now Is full of lives. The Monk. I have not wrong'd you. Hear me. You say you combat for your country—mine, Yours, every man's in whom the proud high blood Of the old time still struggles with the present, And throbs and blushes at degenerate days: The country of the Cæsars, and the saints, And, better still, the land of stirring deeds, Done by rude hands, and heads as yet uncrown'd In earth or heaven; the lady of the kingdoms— The soil on which the gods came down, confounding Their heaven with ours;—restore me if I wander From your own words—you strike for this dear country? All. Die for it! The Monk. And the tide that flowed from those Old Roman veins like empire, so that where The Roman bled he ruled—the blood that soak'd His sovereignty into the land he fell on, Flows in you, and you feel it? General. Reverend father, Time hastes—the news—thine oath—we must hence— The Monk. Peace! Wilt thou direct my gifts, rebellious child? [Turning to the Crowd. Say, will you hear me? Will you know the spot Where the foe lurks I swore to show you? All. Speak! The Monk. You feel the pulses of the Roman blood, You think the masters of the world begot Kings, and not slaves—you come forth with the same Looks, passions, sinews, souls and giant hearts, Which in your sires stood round your ancient heroes, And lifted them to glory on their shields, —Those heroes worshipp'd by the startled earth, Who seeing them above you, call'd them gods— You know the same grand instinct of vast empire, You stand upon the same Italian ground, You stand on that same ground, the same proud people, And the inheritors of ancient worlds, Shout for Milan! What! will you pay your lives To buy a freedom girt by fewer acres Than your old consuls would have thrown away Upon a birth-day gift? What, has this land, This Italy, grown smaller, and lacks ground For such a temple as it once upbore? Or in your base hearts, shrunk with shameful days, Is there no space to build a Roman glory? Go to! you feebler sons of feeble days, You that would totter with the very name By which men call'd your sires! Go to, you pigmies, Who have no more resource in your dwarf nerves, To know the squalor of your futile limbs, Than you have sight or soul or sense to compass The awful stature of a Roman people! Why do I speak of glory? Italy, This Italy, which in its length and breadth Scarce served your fathers for a throne to sit on, Confounds their children with its vast horizon! And the posterity of those who counted Conquests by continents, weigh'd out dominion By hemispheres, and cast a score of kingdoms As dust to balance the unequal scale, Wage comfit combats at a carnival! Coin fatherlands and farthings; and step out Their mimic royalties, and make toy princes Glorious in gilt and gingerbread for kings At school to play with. Husbandmen in crowns, Great in the lordship of a Roman field, Affect the despot, and to trembling townships Nod sovereignty; with equal hand create A constitution, country, and court-cook, Will loyalties, and point with awful finger Which hedge and ditch shall bound a patriotism! While Romans smile, and sons of Cæsar farm Well pleas'd what Cæsar would have deem'd too strait To breed his wild boars for a hunting day, And call it Empire! Enter fresh crowds of Soldiers shouting. Soldiers. Long live the republic! Long live the commonwealth of Lombardy! The Monk. Long live eternal Rome! long live that Rome Which is not dead but sleepeth! long live Rome! Men, this is the great year of resurrection! All who are in their graves shall hear his voice, And come forth! That which twenty centuries hence Lay down a hero, shall rise up a god! Shout, countrymen! and wake the graves; shout, Rome! Republic! Rise! Many voices. Down with him, down with him. Viva Milano! General. A hearing, comrades! Many. Peace! the General speaks! General. Priest, at thy peril—— Many. At thy peril, priest! General. Priest, at thy peril, cease these timeless babblings, Respect thine oath and life. Show us the foe! Soldiers. The foe, the foe, the foe—— The Monk. Each silent man, When I cry Rome! Each false, base-blooded shouter, When you cry Lombardy! Soldiers. Base-blooded! false! Base-blooded! false! give him a ball in the mouth! Milan! Milan! up muskets! General. Shoulder arms! The Monk. Each self-judged helot, pleased to toil, a Goth, When he might rule, a Roman! Rome? Rome? Rome? Bah! by what witchcraft should you know that name, You Tuscans, Luccans, Florentines, Sardinians, Parmans, Placentians, Paduans and—slaves? Soldiers. Spear him—a pike, a pike! Some. Hear the priest! Others (with great uproar). Stone him, Stone him—— The Monk. I am a Roman. Let some Vandal Cast the first stone. SCENE IV. Moonlight. Francesca alone, musing, sitting on a bank beneath trees. Cecco, a friend, enters unperceived, at the close of her soliloquy. Francesca. I will but live in twilight, I will seek out some lone Egerian grove, Where sacred and o'er-greeting branches shed Perpetual eve, and all the cheated hours Sing vespers. And beside a sullen stream, Ice-cold at noon, my shadowy self shall sit, Crown'd with dull wreaths of middle-tinted flowers; With sympathetic roses, wan with weeping For April sorrows; frighten'd harebells, pale With thunder; last, half-scented honeysuckle, That like an ill-starr'd child hides its brown head Through the long summer banquet, but steals late To wander through the fragments of the feast, And glad us with remember'd words that fell From guests of beauty; sunburnt lilies, grey Wind-whispering ilex, and whatever leaves And changeling blossoms Flora, half-asleep, Makes paler than the sun and warmer than the moon! Was ever slave so dark and cold as I? Ah cruel, cruel night! the very stars Put me to shame! I spur my soul all day With thought of tyrants, woes and chains, and curse As oft my pallid and ill-blooded nature, That will not rage. Oh for some separate slave To pity every vassal by! Some tyrant By whom I might set down of all oppressors That they are thus and thus! Oh that some hand, Oh that some one hand, faint and fetter-wrung, Would thrust its clanking wrongs before my eyes, And I could bleed to break them! And thou! country! Thou stern and awful god, of which my reason Preaches infallibly, but which no sense Bears witness to—I would thou hadst a shape. It might be dwarf, deform'd, maim'd,—anything, So it was thine; and it should stand to me For beauty. And my soul should wait on it, And I would train my fancies all about it, Till growing to its fashion, and most nurtured With smiles and tears they strengthen'd into love. But—Santo—this indefinite dim presence I cannot worship. O thou dear apostle, Oh what a patriot could Francesca be If thou wert Rome! Oh what a fond disciple Should his tongue have whose only eloquence Was praise of thee! To what a pile of vengeance One look of retribution in thine eye Were torch enough! Be still, my heart, be still! Ah wilful, wilful heart, dost thou refuse? Nay, be appeased—I bid thee silence, lest Consenting cheeks attest how well thou sayest! Too late, too late. Nay, do you crave, you blushes, Escort of spoken passion, to interpret Your beauties to the moon, which, pale with love And watching for the never-coming night, Mistakes them for some rosy cloud of dawn, And ends her vigil? Heart, have all thy will! Santo, I love thee! love thee! love thee! love thee! Santo, I love thee! oh, thou wild word love! Thou bird broke loose! I could say on and on, And feel existence but to speak and hear. Santo, I love thee! Hear! Francesca loves thee, Santo, I love thee! oh, my heart, my heart, My heart, thou Arab mad with desert-thirst, In sight of water!—think upon the sands, Thou leaping trembling lunatic, and keep Some strength to reach the well. Cecco (approaching). What voice is this, That calls upon a traitor? Francesca. Thou base stranger, Thou coward spy! one that will call on him, Though her tongue pay the forfeit! Yes, vile Austrian, I call him, I,—I, who to save my soul Would scorn to call upon the milk-eyed saints That look from Heaven upon your German deeds And do not blight you! Cecco (drawing near). Sister Roman! well And timely met. Francesca. Cecco! thy lips are traitors, And mouth to German fashions. I believed The hour I sometime pray'd for, come already, And thee an Austrian spy. Cecco. Forgive me that I show'd my passport at a friendly gate, Despair is a poor courtier. I may waste Only so many words as may demand Assistance, if thou hast it, and if not God-speed! It wants but three short hours of dawn, I swore to Santo he should have a Bible Two hours before his time. Francesca. It wants three hours Of dawn—thou sworest he should have a Bible Two hours before his time—Cecco— Cecco. Be brief, For pity. Is there any bold man near Who has and who dare lend? Francesca. Be brief, for pity— Thou sworest he should have—you heavens, you heavens, What do your clouds hide? Cecco. I must leave thee. Francesca (to Cecco, who essays to go: she shows a poniard). Cecco, Tell me; tell all. Ah Cecco—nay, look here In the moonlight—saints! I can use it! Cecco. Strange, Wild girl, how? know'st thou not as well as I Vittorio preaching to some Milanese Who would be patriots if they knew but how, Spent precious hours in which the German foe Slipt from the snare? whereat brave Roderigo— A gallant sword—the greatest libertine In Milan—seized him. In the castle dungeon He lies since noon, and with the coming dawn Dies. Francesca. Dies, dies,—who dies?—pray you, friend, say on; I am not wont to wander. [She sinks gently to the earth. Cecco reclines her on a bank and hasten s on. After awhile Francesca sits up. This is well! That last waltz spent me. Let me see, what gallant Danced young Francesca down? Nay, he'll boast rarely! Yet it seems, long ago—long, long ago. Such dreamless sleep! Thou melancholy moon, What! have I caught my death-damp of the dews? Death,—death,—ah! [A long pause; she sits with her head in her hands. A gallant sword—the greatest libertine In Milan?—yes, yes,—Roderigo,—yes— [Another long pause. He lies since noon—ay, in the castle dungeon, And with the dawn—No, no, thou pitiless sun! Thou durst not rise! Oh sea, if thou hast waves, Quench him! [Another long pause. A gallant sword—the greatest libertine In Milan.—Ah—the greatest libertine? Who says I am not fair? Ye gods! I curse you: Why do ye tempt me? [A very long pause. Cecco passes in returning. It is over, Cecco; Cecco, I tell thee it is past, is past. Santo is free. Look thou that horses wait Near the east gate by sunrise. At the walls My mission ends. Doubt not. I am not mad, I hope I am not. Yet one hour of frenzy Would take me from this hell to heaven. But, Cecco, I would not buy oblivion, at this moment, With a right hand that shakes. I tell thee, haste! Gaze not on me! with all the fiends about me, I have not sat an hour stock-still for nought; Begone! [Exit Cecco. SCENE V. The Common Room of an Inn. Enter, by different doors, a number of Students and Burghers, shouting to each other as they meet and greet. Each and all. The news? The news? The news? The news? The news? One. I've a good tale. Another. I better. Another. I the best. Another. Mine caps superlative. Another. Hurrah! and mine's A feather in the cap. Another. Boys! mine's the bird That grew the feather. The first. Hear me for my age. The second. Me for my honesty. The third. Me for my beauty! The fourth. Me for my wit. The fifth. Me for my eloquence. The sixth. Me For all these. Another. Me for none of them, since naked Beggars are best arm'd. Enter Giacco. Giacco. Halloo! All. Giacco! Giacco! Brave Giacco! Giacco. Here's a tale, my comrades! All. Hear him! One. Hurrah! trust Giacco for a pretty wench And a good story. Another. Nay, for certain, Milan Has no such tell-tale. Another. Lads! a cup all round, Giacco does best! One (aside). Pray Mary! he knows mine; Every good saint! it must be mine. Some. Now, Giacco! Others. Attend! attend! attend! Others. Silence! Now, Giacco! Giacco. There came a man—— One. Ay, 'tis so. Another. Very true— So I say. Another. Hear him! Another. Ay, ay, go on, Giacco! Giacco. There came a man dress'd like a priest—— One. The same. Another. Yes, 'twas a priest. Another. Said I not well? ah, ah! Trust Giacco for a tale. Giacco. A thin pale man—— One. A pale thin man. Another. Yes, pale and spare, I say so. Another. Spare, very spare. Another. The same! the dogs snarl'd at him As he were bones. Giacco. He pass'd down Duomo Street—— One. The very street! Another. Yes, yes, the place, the place, The very place—all but the name—good Giacco! Another. Giacco forgets a little—Yes, yes, Giacco— (Aside). My life on it, he means the place I say! Giacco. Walking down slowly—— One. Yes, yes, walking slowly. Another. Right, Giacco! Another. Well done, Giacco. Another. Ay, I say so; Oh, 'tis my story! Giacco. Walking down he enters A merchant's office hard upon the quay—— One. Wrong, Giacco! Another. Giacco, thou'rt beside thyself! Another. Blind Giacco! Another. Saints and angels! Giacco. Why, I saw him—— Another. Giacco, thou liest! Another. Turn him out! Another. Nay! 'tis flagrant! All. Turn him out! Enter a Village Schoolmaster. Doctor Scio. Men! Some. Room for the Doctor Scio! The reader need not be reminded that Scio is but one syllable in Italian. Others. Chair for the master, there! Others. Hats off! the Doctor! All. Room for the Doctor! Let the Doctor judge! Take him aside, Giovanni. Tell him all! Tell him, Giovanni! Scio (pompously). Children agapete! Well-beloved children! trouble not Giovanni! For as of old the mild mellifluous beams Of Cytherea on the Prince of Troy Stole through the broken pane,—as to Endymion, Through the crack'd casement of consenting cave, The star-train'd goddess came; so from these wide And vomitorial windows, belch'd your tumult To me transgressing. Some. Hear him! Others. Well done, Scio! Hear him! One. Oh learning! what a treasure thou art! Others. Hurrah! Speak, Doctor, speak! Scio. The labourer Is worthy of his hire. Friends, what is hire? All. Wages! Scio. And when, Sirs, does the fatigate Pellosseous, son of sudorific toil, Receive his wage? Is it not, friends, the eve, The sweet stipendiar eve of Saturn's day? Burghers (to each other). Didst hear the like? What 'tis to be a scholar! Scio has my boy—for one. Scio. And shall we, friends, Shall we degrade the majesty of Learning Which I—which I—her infinitesimal Exiguous representative—— Some. Bravo, Well said! Scio. Which I—her representative Exiguous but unworthy—— Some. No, no, Scio, No, not unworthy. Others. Don't be modest, Scio; Unworthy! bah!—— Others. Give us the other words— Go on, Scio, ‘infinite’—— Scio. I say, my friends, Shall I, the representative of Learning, Work first and be paid after, like the plodder In yonder field? My friends, there was a thing, A tool, an article, friends, a utensil Known to our fathers by the sacred names Poculum, cantharus, carchesium, scyphus, Cymbium, culullus, cyathus, amystis, Scaphium, batiola, and now by us Their children, Sirs, albeit unworthy, call'd A cup. All. A cup, a cup, a cup of wine! Well done, old Scio! hurrah! a cup of wine Here for the doctor, oh! a cup of wine. Enter a Stranger, who stands aside. A Burgher bows to him and speaks. Burgher (to Stranger). A stranger? Stranger. Yes. Burgher. You come in good time, Sir; Sir, you're a happy man, I give you joy, Sir; Sir, these are times!—I take it, Sir, few men Can gainsay that, Sir,—these are times, Sir, eh? Stranger. Sir, these are times. Burgher (pointing to Scio). You take me, Sir, I see. Now, Sir, behold that man. I say, Sir, mark him; Now, Sir, you see a man, a man, Sir. Stranger. Sir, I see a man. Burgher. Just my idea, Sir,—Sir, I crave your further knowledge, we are friends— Saints! how a patriot's eye—between ourselves—Sir, A patriot's eye finds out the man of the age. Stranger. There is a nameless something—— Burgher. Sir, you have it; My own idea, Sir, from a boy—a something Indisputably something. Yes, a something As one might say—to speak more plainly—something, A something, Sir,—something in the set of the ear—— Many shout. Scio—Doctor Scio—Silence! The Doctor! Silence! Enter Lelio, a Student. Lelio. Here's news, friends! Many. How now, Lelio? Lelio. Which man here Tells the best tale? Many. I. I. I. I. I. I. Lelio. Nay, everybody! Write me up a nonsuch! I can beat everybody. Heroes can No more. All. A challenge, lads; what ho! a ring, A ring, a ring, a ring! Champion, step out! A ring! a ring! A Student. Go call thy daughter, hostess, Here's that will make her honest. Hostess. Sir? Student. A ring. All. Now, Lelio, now, each man that beats thee wins His bottle. Lelio. Done. You know the fair Francesca, Count Grassi's daughter? All. Are we Milanese? Lelio. Well—— One. Well? Another. Well! Nay, if she's well, Lelio, 'Tis no such story! Lelio. Which man has not seen Young Roderigo Rossi? All. Or the sun, The moon—a star or two—the Duomo—well? Lelio. Young Rossi and a priest fell out last night. Several. A priest—a priest—a priest— One. My life upon it The fellow knows my story. Lelio. On this quarrel, Our gallant Cavaliero dooms his man To die at day-break. Many. By the holy pope, A foul deed—nay, a foul deed. One (aside). Ne'erth less, By heavens I'm glad on't. This is not my story. My priest was a true patriot. Lelio. At midnight—— (Count Grassi's child hath a fair face) Several. At midnight, Count Grassi's child hath a fair face! Fie, Lelio; Why what a traitor art thou! Lelio. Attend, I say! Bold Rossi's lewdness is a proverb—— Several (pour badiner). Hold, Lelio, for pity—there are bachelors here— We are not all companions in misfortune! For pity, Lelio! Lelio. You that shout for pity, If you be Pity's followers, do her now Your best allegiance. Good friends, I, her quæstor, Claim tribute from you. A few tears will pay it. Listen. The young Francesca, at the price Of her fair body, bought the captive's life; The priest is free. Do not cry out. Young Rossi Craved instant payment. She in her superb High loveliness, whose every look enhanced The ransom, sent him from her, glad to grant Another maiden hour for prayer and tears. Francesca wore a poniard. She is now A maid for ever. Hostess (to one standing by). How is that, Sir? Student (aside). Hush! Dead! Several. 'Tis a woful story. Poor Francesca! Scio. Requiem æternam dona eis Domine! Several. Amen. Amen. Hostess (aside). Dead! 'tis against my conscience; Dead! and the Signor Rossi! why a comelier Walks not Milan. Dead—nay, I couldn't have done it! Well, well, there be hard hearts that slight their blessings. So comely a young man! The saints preserve me! Nay, 'twas a sinful blindness. Lelio. How now, hostess, Some wine, some wine; wine, wine. Several. More wine; now, Lelio, Who was this monk?— Lelio. Fill up your glasses, comrades, Sorrow is thirsty fellowship—eh, hostess? Several. Lelio—now, Lelio—name, name, name! Others. This priest, This lady-killing priest! Lelio (to one). Hast thou forgotten A dance with Ginevrà at eve? A priest— One The same? Lelio. The same. One. Vittorio Santo? speak! Another. Santo? Another. Vittorio Santo? Lelio. What! Vicenzo Barnabà! Ah Tomaseo! are ye also Of Nazareth? Well done! tell you my story. Many. Lelio—hear Lelio— Others. Hear! Lelio. It was this Santo. Dost thou mind, Giacchimo, how, deftly feigning Sorrows about a grave, he won our ears And prick'd us on to virtue with the sword Of our own sympathies? With such shrewd warfare— Proteus for transformation—Briareus For head and hands—this strange campaigner carries The fire and sword of his hot argument From cot to palace, plain to mountain-top. The merchant at his ledger, lifting eyes Bloodshot with lack of sleep—for last night blew— Sees him beside his desk at close of day, And thinks the lamp burns dimmer, and believes The untold loss already. The pale priest, Opening his silent lips with such an omen That the faint listener starts, relates how some Great galleon, gallant on her homeward way— A floating Ind, mann'd by the pride of Europe— Storm'd by a scallop fleet of naked pirates, Bestrews their savage shores, and makes each rock Arabia. With keen eyes catching the throes Of his now gasping auditor, the tale Our stern tormentor fashions so astutely, That each new fear, enduing, strains it to Its several shape. Watching each rising hope, He stings it mad with some especial horror, And by a track of anguish feels his way Straight to his victim's heart. In that worst moment The messenger of doom assumes the angel! Looks that evangelise, eyes that beam light Into the soul, till every dead hope glitters Like a crown'd corpse; a moment's shining silence, Slow placid words that hurry to a torrent; Then the gulf-stream of passion! high command, Entreaty, reason, adjuration;—all The martial attitudes of a grand soul. The lavish wealth of infinite resource! Diamonds thrown broad-cast for denaros!—ay, That Argosy he spoke of, scatter'd on The maddest waves of rushing rapid, surging Headlong through foaming straits, above, below, Tossing the wealth of kingdoms, hurtles not With such tumultuous riches as the flood Of his strange eloquence. And then the scared And half-drown'd trader—lifting his blind thought Above the waters, that with sudden ebb Left him in silence—finds he is alone. Of all the golden wreck, his struggling soul Holds fast but this—Rome is that glorious galleon, Now stranded and forlorn: her freight of honours Strew'd up and down the world, purpling strange snows And loading cold barbaric winds with incense. That night, at home, the merchant tells his story, Wherewith, still later, madam at her glass Stirs sleepy Abigail. Sweet Abigail, Still nearer midnight, garrulously coy, 'Twixt amorous Corydon and her warm charms, Weaves the gauze meshes of the thrice-told tale. Next morn on 'Change betimes the story stalks By blind deaf faces, as a spirit might walk Among the wooden gods of the sea-kings. The hour of contract over,—the fierce edge Of morning appetite now turn'd with gold— Nature appeased, and the commercial soul In jolly after-dinner complaisance Relax'd and smiling,—prosperous ears attend The merchant never weary of recounting. ‘Insured, Sir?’ ‘I fear not.’ ‘Heyday, heyday, A sorry venture!’ Then the angry hum Subsiding, all surround the man of facts. Sage heads shook much that day. Municipal Grave brains plagued with strange phantoms, never yet Free of the city, in the sacred gloom Of shades official, ached, and retched, and heaved, To throw the incivic innovation off: And in the pangs of labour crying out, Betrayed the parentage. So this strange priest Made his foes preach for him, till all Leghorn Hung on his lips. With bold incessant presence Whereto no shrine is sacred, no stern fastness Strong, no offended majesty majestic, No sinner excommunicate, no saint Holy, no Dives rich, no Lazarus poor, No human heart unworthy—this strange man— This cowl'd evangelist, that Monk is not— (For he preach'd yesterday that not a bare Untempled spot, unblest, unconsecrate On earth, but is sufficient sanctuary For the best hour of the best life;—no cloud In any heaven so dark that a good prayer Cannot ascend,)—this polyglot of prophets, Roams like a manifold infection, shedding Through the sick souls of men the strange disease Of his own spirit. Not an art or calling Wherein men work'd in peace, but at his touch Spreads the indefinite sorrow. In the field Halting the team of early husbandman, He chides him for the German weeds that choke The Roman crop of glory; bids him seek The plough of Cincinnatus, and bring forth Into the sunshine of the age, that soil, That old heroic soil whence patriots spring! Hard by the wondering swain, sequester'd close By summer elms and vines, the village forge From cheerful anvil all the long day rings The chimes of labour. Thence at winter night Shines to the distant villager the star Of home; to which the homeless wayfarer, Trudging with fainting steps the storm-vex'd moor, Turns hopeless eyes, as to the vestal fire Of sweet impossible peace. Thereby the priest Pausing, the sturdy smith suspends his stroke Before the reverend stranger; who accepts The homage with such liquidating grace That the stunn'd peasant, unabsolved of duty, Renews obeisance. Then the pale intruder Striding some stool, with hand upon the bellows, Moves the slack fire, and bids the work go on: Cursing the slave who stoops for prince or priest The dignity of toil. To the rough music Setting strong words, he sends with easy skill Wrongs, hopes, and duties trooping through the soul Of the stout smith, and there on his own smithy Blows the rough iron of his heart red-hot. Seizing the magic time, with sudden hand He stamps him to the quick;—‘Patriot! the hour Is come to beat our ploughshares into swords, Our pruning hooks to spears!’ The brand driven home, The apostle vanishes, lest weaker words Efface the sign. A Student. Lelio! dost thou remember—— Lelio. I know thy thought,—the shopman of the vale—— Student. Nay, Lelio—— Lelio. Now I have it—the stout Tuscan, With wain o'erloaded—— Student. Not he—— Lelio. Ah! the maid Who sang in German—— Student. No—— Lelio. Stay! she who wore The cameo victory—— Student. Now hear me, Lelio. When he saw—— Lelio. What! when meeting country boys With laurel and acanthus—— Student. No! the saints! Lelio. True, true, the tale of the parch'd field beside The aqueduct—— Student. Wrong! Holy Mary! Lelio. Well—— Student. Peace, I say, Lelio! Lelio. Sometime hence, dear friend; I am not weary. 'Twas of the round tower Of Vesta, whence the epicurean Time, Fresh from the feasts of Rome, took but the heart, And all is there but the celestial flame That consecrated all—— Student. Have thine own way, But were I Lelio—— Lelio. Tut, I know thy story. 'Twas of the eve when, meeting by the way An ancient pedagogue, whose thin, time-worn, And reverend features (whereabout grey locks Hung lank as weeds), great names went in and out, Mournfully populous, like olden heroes Haunting some Roman ruin; our fierce patriot—— Say I not well? Student. Hast thou in truth forgotten The village priest? Lelio. The priest? our priest says little To alb and stole—whether from shrewd self-knowledge, Or feeling that all tyrants are familiars, And that those proud prætorians who subverted The commonwealth of God would lord it over An earthly heritage—therefore, good comrade, Owe us thy tale. Student. One day—— Lelio. One moment first, (‘One day’ can spare it). I shall ne'er forget, When falling in upon a lone wild road With a fat monk, our patriot, for sheer lack Of occupation, challenges a war Of words. Good saints! a firework by a fountain! A schoolboy's freak played out with cannon balls And rotten apples! As our Santo's lightnings Through the thick haze of t'other's sanctity Singed brow and beard, heavens! how the reverend eyes (Wrestling with wrinkles and siesta-time) Did struggle to a stare. And the good man, Heaving his flesh, buzzed like a portly fly In thundery weather; our relentless Santo At parting gives him for to-morrow's text The whip of knotted cords that cleansed the temple. ‘Preach, priest,’ he cries, ‘that from these sacred bounds, This outraged temple Italy, each Roman Scourge those that sell the sacrilegious doves Of perjured peace. O'erturn, o'erturn,’ he cries, ‘The tables of those German money-changers, That make this house of prayer a den of thieves.’ Assaulting thus with rude declaim those ears Dull with the gentle lowings of fat kine And soft excitements of refectory-bell, Our Santo leaves him, ere the saint disturb'd, In doubt of man or demon, could revolve Upon his axis. All. Ah, ah! Well done, Lelio! Lelio. Our friar on this—— One. Why the saints smite thee, Lelio! Now, Lelio!—Eh? nay, Sirs, as I'm alive This was my story! Another. Give thee joy of it, Old Giacco, 'twas a sorry tale, now mine—— Lelio. Friends! we grow solemn. Wine, I say. A song, A song. One. Ay, something loyal—— Lelio. Worthy friends, We should do well to purify the air Whereof these tales were made; forced by our lips Into unwilling treason. One. Lelio! Another. Shame! Lelio. Therefore, my merry boys, I vote a ditty, A well-affected ditty—nay, some say 'Twas writ by Metternich and Del Caretto, At Schoenbrun after dinner. Nay, no groans! Sweet friends, no groans! Nay, hear me, friends. Shouts from many. Down with him! Lelio. No Carbonaro—— Many. Down with him! Lelio. I call it The triple crown, or the three jolly kings, The Devil—— Some. Hear! Some. Hurrah! Lelio. The Devil—— All. Hurrah! Lelio. The Pope and the Kaiser. All. Hurrah! Lelio! Lelio! True to the backbone still! Up with him, boys! Chair him! a hall! a hall! now, Lelio, now! Shout cheerly, man—here's thunder for a chorus! SCENE VI. A Plain. A Cottage. The Monk (Vittorio Santo). Two Children (a Boy and Girl). Their Father and Mother (both young) sit at the cottage door. The Monk draws near. The Monk (aside). This is the spot. From hence my eye unseen Commands their cottage. Hither have I fared Five times at this same hour, and five times learn'd To love my nature better. Here I stood, And felt, when passing gales in snatches bore me Their evening talk, as if some wayward child Had pelted me with flowers. She is a poet, Or in or out of metre. Rome must have her. A mother too, 'tis well; then there is one thing The poet will serve. Ah! art thou forth to-day, Thou little tyrant, that shalt rule for me? My faith! a lovely boy! holy St. Mary! Hark how he carols out his royalty, And, born a sovereign, rules and knows it not. The father must be mine too; he hath bone And sinew, and—if the eye's gauge deceive not— A soul as brawny. Heavy deeds demand Such carriers. I will win or lose this night. Let me draw near. [The Children are sporting. The Girl hides among myrtles, and sings. Girl. Whither wingest thou, wingest thou, winny wind; Where, winny wind, where, oh where? Boy (singing). My sister, my sister, I flit forth to find, My sister, my sister, the orange-flow'r fair! Girl. Since thy songs thy soft sister seek, What wouldst with her? say, oh say. Boy. Oh, to pat her pearl-white cheek, And court her with kisses all day! [The Child bursts from her hiding place, and the Children chase each other over the plain. The Mother. Husband! the music in my soul would chord Most sweetly with thy voice. Take down thy lute. The Father. Nay, Lila; bid me not do violence To this calm sunset. List that golden laughter, Hark to our children! There is music like The hour. From each to each the heart can pass, And know no change. The Mother. Sing me a song about them, Kind husband. Sing that song I made for thee, When once, on a sweet eve like this, we watch'd As now our joyous babes—I blessing them, Thou marvelling, with show of merry jest, How they could be so fair. The Father. Even as thou wilt, Dear Lila. If the spirit of these moments Deem my voice sacrilege, let him forgive The singer for the poet. He sings. Oh, Lila! round our early love, What voices went—in days of old! Some sleep, and some are heard above, And some are here—but changed and cold! What lights they were that lit the eyes That never may again be bright! Some shine where stars are dim; and some Have gone like meteors down the night. I marvell'd not to see them beam, Or hear their music round our way; A part of life they used to seem, But these—oh whence are they? Ear hath not heard the tones they bring, Lip hath not named their name, Like primroses around the spring, Each after each they came. I should not wonder, love, to see In dreams of elder day, The forms of things that used to be, But these—oh whence are they? Dost thou remember when the days Were all too short for love and me, And we roam'd forth at eve in rays Of mingled light from heaven and thee? One gentle sign so often beam'd Upon us with such favouring eyes, That every vow we plighted seem'd A secret holden with the skies. Now sometimes, in strange phantasy, I think, if stars could leave their sphere, And won by the dear love of thee, Renew the constellation here, And shine here with the tender light That glinted through the olden trees, They would come silently and bright, And one by one, like these. How can a joy so pure and free Have sprung from tears and cares? I have no beauty—and for thee, Thou hast no mirth like theirs. Yet with strange right each takes his rest, Even when he will, on thy fair breast, Nor doubts nor fears nor prays. The daisy smiling on the lea Comes not with kindlier trust to be eloved of April days. I look into their laughing eyes, They cannot have more light than thine— But treasured by ten thousand ties, Mine own I know thee, Lila mine. Wistful I gaze on them and say,— Fond, checking with a doubtful sigh The pride that swells, I know not why— These, these, oh whence are they? [The Monk draws near. The Father. Lila! the same pale priest we saw last eve! The Mother. Good husband, bid him here. The dust of travel Tells that his way was weary. Holy Sir, Will't please you sit with us? The herds are milk'd. Our bread is brown, but honest. The Monk. Do not ask me. Are you not happy? The Wife. Happy! reverend father? We thank God, and say yes. This day five years One whom I saw for the first time, through tears, Came with the flowers. When they began to fade How my heart sicken'd! But God call'd him not With them. And though the snows of winter came He stayed, and held enough of summer with him To fill my house. Should I not be most happy? Look on my boy, my merry one! Good father, Which of the angels do they miss in heaven? Ofttimes at mass I press him close, and tremble To the sweet voices, lest at ‘in excelsis’; He should remember, and go back. The Monk. Oh mother, That art, and art not, kind! 'Tis a brave boy. The Mother. And then he is so gentle and so fond, And prattles to me sometimes in strange wisdom, And asks of me in such sweet ignorance, That teaching him I weep; oft, oft, for joy, But oft for very grief, that each task leaves One tiny question less. The Monk. 'Tis a sweet child. The Father. Sir Priest, thou knowest well how poor an image A mother's love will idolize; but this Dear boy hath put a woman's heart in me, He is so good, so dutiful— The Mother. And yet When he kneels by me at his innocent prayer, Oft I look down and feel that I have need To learn of him. The Monk. Let me bless him. The Father. My son, The priest would bless thee on thy birth-day; boy, Come bend thee at his knee. The Monk. Thou little child, Thy mother's joy, thy father's hope—thou bright, Pure dwelling where two fond hearts keep their gladness— Thou little potentate of love, who comest With solemn sweet dominion to the old, Who see thee in thy merry fancies charged With the grave embassage of that dear past, When they were young like thee—thou vindication Of God—thou living witness against all men Who have been babes—thou everlasting promise Which no man keeps—thou portrait of our nature, Which in despair and pride we scorn and worship— Thou household-god, whom no iconoclast Hath broken,—if I knew a parent's joys, If I were proud and full of great ambitions, Had haughty limbs that chafed at ill-borne chains, If I had known a tyrant's scorn and felt That vengeance though bequeathed is still revenge, I would pray God to give me such a son! Therefore, thou little one, mayst thou sleep well This night: and, for thy waking, may it be Where there are neither kings nor slaves. Of all Thy playmates, mayst thou be the first to die— The Mother shrieks. Ah! holy father! The Monk. Smitten in the bud Mayst thou fade on the stalk that had no thorns To save thee from the spoiler—mayst thou— The Mother. Mercy! The Father. Fiend! murderer! The Monk. Did you not bid me bless him? The Mother. My boy! my happy one! my brighteyed babe! The Father. Thou hooded demon! thou hell-priest! The Monk. Be patient. I will take off the blessing; but hear me, And you shall bid me pray for it again. The Mother. Blessing? 'Tis blessing to behold him smile With his bright, innocent, unconscious eyes, Which thou wouldst close for ever! The Monk. Is that blessing? Too happy mother! how thou lov'st to weep! Come hither, child. Nay, daughter, tremble not! He is a Roman, and can fear no man— A child, and dreads not death. 'Tis the purblind Dim sense of after years that makes our monsters. The earth hath none to children and to angels. Eyes weak with vigil, sear'd with scalding tears, Betray us, and we start at death and phantoms Because they are pale. And the still-groping heart Incredulous by over much believing— Walking by sight dreads the unknown, and clings Even to familiar sorrow, and loves more The seen earth than the unseen God. Ay, bright one, Climb near the lips that speak of death. The word Falls on the sunshine of thy face and casts No shadow. Thou dost play among the flowers Morning and even, and the selfsame wind Fosters and scatters them. Why shouldst thou fear? Twine thy young arms, thou little budding vine, Round the old barren oak; 'tis sweet to love thee, Too sweet. I look upon thy brow of promise, And see it in the future like some cloud Uprising from the distant hills, that seemeth To bear up heaven. This may do more. Contain it. Contain it and the things which heaven and earth Cannot contain. In thine unsullied eyes, Not made for tears; in thy bright looks, sweet boy, Wherein the blush yet sleeps which sights of shame Shall call there, till the weary veins refuse Their office, and endurance sends the blood Back from the blanch'd cheeks to the terrible heart To heave and madden there—(let tyrants tremble Who rule pale slaves)—yes, in thy brave proud mien, Thou baby hero, that art born in vain, I see why Roman mothers wept for glory And we for shame. I see the ancient beauty Sport on the plain where Brutus watch'd his children, And given them no supremacy. I see Iulus' self. Cornelia would have own'd These jewels. Regulus saw nothing fairer When from the sands of Carthage his great thought Walk'd by the streams of his Italian hills, And by the well-known grove beheld his children Play round the homeside myrtles, where their mother Sat and look'd eastward! Wherein art thou less Than Roman? Oh thou hapless flower, that canst not Fruit in this frozen land, how shall I bless thee? Art thou not noble, gentle, beautiful? Hast thou one aspiration to climb aught Beside thy mother's knee? Do they not love thee, Believe thee, trust thee, hope in thee, adore thee? Dost thou not take their cares from morn till eve, And in the radiant alchemy of thine eyes Transmute them into joys? Runs not their fate In that inherited blood that warms thy cheek? Were they not things like thee, and are they not Themselves? and do they murmur? What though, fair one, Angels might envy—if they were not angels— The stature that the fresh bright air of freedom Should fan thee to? It passes the court fashion, Breaks footstep in the Austrian ranks, and fits No cell in Spielberg. It might even betide That Roman arms work'd ill in chains; a voice Like that which cheer'd the legions, might be guilty Of old ancestral words which would sound strange In German ears. Nay, there was once a Roman— I saw him, and felt nobler! he was like thee! Like thee as star to star! If you be parents, Fall down and pray that he may die! The Mother. Good padre, Pity us. The Father. Priest! The Mother. Be silent, he is moved, Perchance he was a father. [A long pause, the Monk covers his head with his mantle. The Monk (looking up). Evening comes Apace. The tried ox slackens in the furrow. The shade that on your threshold paused but now, Hath climb'd the vine where from the eaves the swallow Sings early vespers. My full heart prescient Heaves to the falling hour. Children, kneel down, Let holy words spread evening in your souls, Lest they be timeless when the far bell rings Ave Maria. [They kneel. The Monk reads. The Monk. And I heard a voice, A voice from heaven, which said unto me, ‘Write, Blessed are the dead.’; [He pauses. Rise up! I had forgotten! Forgive me! The Mother. Reverend father! The Father. Friend, what say'st thou? The Monk. That if thou wert what that proud man should be Who calls this child ‘my son,’; this land ‘my country,’; Thou hadst cried out ‘Amen!’; The Father. Sir Priest, so please you To speak in riddles—read them. The Monk. I will read them. And mine enigma shall be such grim pastime As fiends might play at. Pity me, this anger Wrongs you. I do forget that you are yet But a few moments off from happiness, And that the music of her shores is singing Still in your ears. We dwellers in the dark Forget the weakness of your daylight eyes. I should remember that the twilight stands 'Twixt night and day. My fierce and tropical fancy, Hot with swift pulses, saw the sun go down, And look'd up for the stars. I had a brother— I had? Oh heaven! there is no Lazarus So poor as Dives fallen! You whose portion In the abounding present is unspent— You with whose friendships and familiar joys Earth is still populous—you who have not Learn'd yet, when stranger lips descant of love, Unconsciously to look upon the turf— You who are only of this upper world, You know not what it costs to say ‘I had.’; But there shall come a time when ye shall sit Safe in this cabin, yet shall feel the rain Falling upon you, though your limbs be dry, And your hearth warm. And then you shall forgive me, And feel that I have something to forgive! Then you shall know how sickly and distract Thoughts grow, that pass their days beneath the sod, And sit whole nights by graves. I had a brother, We were twin shoots from one dead stem. He grew Nearer the sun, and ripen'd into beauty; And I within the shadow of my thoughts, Pined at his side and loved him. He was brave, Gallant and free. I was the silent slave Of fancies; neither laugh'd, nor fought, nor play'd, And loved not morn nor eve for very trembling At their long wandering shades. In childhood's sports He won for me, and I look'd on aloof; And when perchance I heard him call'd my brother, Was proud and happy. So we grew together, Within our dwelling by the desert plain, Where the roe leap'd, And from his icy hills the frequent wolf Gave chivalry to slaughter. Here and there Rude heaps, that had been cities, clad the ground With history. And far and near, where grass Was greenest and the unconscious goat browsed free, The teeming soil was sown with desolations, As though Time—striding o'er the field he reap'd— Warm'd with the spoil, rich droppings for the gleaners Threw round his harvest way. Frieze, pedestal, Pillars that bore through years the weight of glory, And take their rest. Tombs, arches, monuments, Vainly set up to save a name, as though The eternal served the perishable; urns, Which winds had emptied of their dust, but left Full of their immortality. In shrouds Of reverent leaves, rich works of wondrous beauty Lay sleeping—like the children in the wood— Fairer than they. Columns like fallen giants, The victor on the vanquish'd, stretch'd so stern In death, that not a flower might dare to do Their obsequies. And some from sweet Ionia With those Ionia bore to Roman skies Lay mingled, like a goddess and her mother, Who wear, with difference, the co-equal brightness Of fadeless youth. The plain thus strew'd with ages Flower'd in the sunshine of to-day, and bore me The Present and the Past. But there were some Proud changeless stones that stood up in the sun, And with their shadowy finger on the plain Drew the same mystic circle day by day, And these I worshipp'd. Honouring them, because It needs must be they knew the sense that sign Bore in the language of Eternity; And fearing them for that dark hand which ever— When I drew near their awful face at noon, And, spent with wondering, sank down unconscious, And slept upon the turf—came back at even And cast me shuddering out. So days wore on, And childhood. And the shade of all these ruins Fell on my soul. And he, my pride, grew up, With, and without me. And we were such brothers As day and night. We met at morn and eve. Each sun uprose to find us hand in hand, And see a tender parting. Each first star Led back the shades and us. He flush'd with conquest, Rich in the well slain antelope, and all That feathery wage youth loves to take for labour; I laden with new thoughts. Pale, travel-worn, Spent with fierce exercise and faint with toil, I, who—the shepherd of the plain would tell you— Since sunbreak upon one same broken column Sat like a Caryatid. So youth was mine, And seasons crown'd it manhood. Manhood came, And with it those fierce instincts of strange combat, That hurtle in the heart when the new powers, Like eager vassals on Ascension-day, Crowd round the throned will. Childhood and youth May own unwritten law, and kiss the rod That strikes, but parleys not. But man must be A subject, not a slave. And manhood stood Before the shadows that had awed the child, And bade them answer. And they spoke. My heart Stood up. A thousand senses ran to arms, To guard the revelation; but it came not. Like a mask'd guest, the voice went through my soul, And wandering there long days and nights, made all My hours alarums. So the phantom knight, In awful legend of the old Romaunt, By a proud castle winds his ghostly horn, And blows his challenge in at every gate, And through the chafed halls stalks the unearthly sound, And fills with strange ubiquitous defiance Turret and dungeon, battlement and keep, Which groan back answering War. While at the blast Grim sudden furies fill the martial place, Helm rings with hauberk, scutcheon'd gonfalons Wave in no wind. Shields rattle. Chargers neigh To unblown clarions. Weapons clash unbid On the vex'd walls, and men, with swords half-drawn, Start up and stare into the troublous air. Not otherwise the voice disturb'd my soul, Till spectral nights and strange unnatural days Beckon'd their neighbour, Death. I felt him chill The sunshine round me. But I only look'd More fondly for my brother. When day went, And we met by the well-known spot at even, And by the kindred moon, he saw the pale Faint life that lean'd upon his stalwart beauty, I was a dearer burden than the spoils Of his best hunting field. With tender pain He led me forth at sunrise, and came back Before the dews. And, with moist eyes, I mark'd Daily he brought home less and less at even, With forethought of the day's sad robbery, Keeping in fond economy more strength To lend mine indigence. And thus I measur'd My life's receding tide. 'Twas beautiful To see, as each wave ebb'd from earth, the sands Purple with flowers from heaven. He gave me cares, I paid him from the alms the hills, and vales, Plains, ruins, waters, fields, and skies had thrown me Through my long hours of waiting. I beheld him— And so you shall behold your child one day— Sublime as if a god of old had stepp'd Warm from his marble pedestal. I gave him Nectar for gods. I saw his eyes light up, And into his heroic hand I put The weapon of my thoughts. And he smote with it— Look to your boy, he will smite so—he smote And struck such flashes from a despot's helm As might set thrones on fire. And some who winced Complain'd. When the lamb bleats in the Abruzzi, The wolf is silent—'tis the tyrant's music; But let one miscreant yelper howl, and mark How all the pack gives tongue. An outraged people Cries out for ages, and the sacred sound Broods o'er our land, and finds no wind to bear The thankless burden hence. A tyrant yells,— Though but the very meanest starveling hound, The most distemper'd cur that feeds upon The garbage thrown from palaces—no matter— A thousand echoes tell it in Vienna, And fill the air with German. Oh my brother, Would I had been content to be thy debtor, Nor paid thee in a coin that bore the stamp Of freedom in a captive land! They seized him, They seized! Who seized? Some Roman lictor—one Beneath whose reverend hand it would be glory To think that heroes suffer'd so, and counted The touch no shame? Goths, whose barbarian sires Made holiday for ours. Vandals and Huns, The cubs of dams more savage than our mothers Deign'd to enslave; all that rank Northern growth, By whose rude hands the might of bones and thews Bearded our conscript fathers in the forum, And beards their children here,—who sit like them, Silent, but not like them sublime. Camillus! What! can we lounge upon our curule chairs, And play the Roman only in endurance? Earth! what hast thou of vigour less than Greece, That in that genial soil the serpent's teeth Sprang up arm'd men;—and here we have sown heroes And reap—grass! Yes. He fell. Behold your son: Picture him nobler than the noblest vision Of thy day-dreams, poor mother! See, the bloodhounds Have track'd him to your cot. A faded face Lies with dark uprais'd eyes of love before The fond heroic brother. Heavenly calm Warders the room, and of the sweet emotions Of the rejoicing world without, lets in Only the silent sunshine. The door bursts! A shriek! a shout! they seize him! The pale form Springs at the first and falls. Now see your hero Like an inspired colossus striding o'er him. With either hand he hurls a savage hence, Foots each bare neck, with twice another twain Acquaints the sounding walls. Falls by some blow From unseen hand. Sinks by the yelling weight Of crowds. A moment more, and like dead game Slung by some trooper's side, mother, he greets thee, And leaves thee baptized in his sprinkled gore, To faiths kings dream not of. Oh brother, brother, On memory! that canst bring me back such woes And break not! Thus they tore him from me. Ah, Poor tender child, why doth thy baby heart Look up through saddening eyes? What! little one, And canst thou read the future? Dost thou know That he was like thee? Ay, poor mother, clasp him, Clasp him while yet thou mayst! Secure as thou That morn I clasp'd my brother! Dost thou ask What tidings fell upon the failing ear Of him who in the cottage by the plain Lay weeping? Be it as thou wilt, poor mother, It concerns thee;—what if of all thy tears— Thy fated tears—a few are shed too soon? For me I am a rock which, long years hence, The storms stripp'd rudely, and with my few flowers Took all that nursed them, and to after tempests Left but the cold bare stone. In earth or heaven I have no more to fear. But for thee, mother, I will read out this story, and perchance Teach thee to strike the fire that yet may burn The page ere it be thine. The Mother. Oh that thou wouldst! The Monk. Not of the dungeons, those dark catacombs Where our oppressors heap'd their sins for ages, Wrong after wrong, till the o'er-surfeited rock At the great day of reckoning shall belch up A thousand years to cry for vengeance. No, Those Roman limbs were purchased far too dearly To rot in Spielberg. He was tall of stature, And fair to look upon. So shall your son Be tall and fair. It pleasured some small tyrant To see such goodly slaves. The shameful trappings Of a detested loyalty, the fillets That deck the sacrifice, the fearful gewgaws That ratify the compact, when the body Serves what the soul abhors, and with the bribe Tricks out the whoredom, these worse chains replaced The felon's fetters, and the outraged Roman Rose up an Austrian soldier! The plot thickens— The shadow of the end is on my soul— Count tears for words—nay, you are parents—I Was but a brother—wherefore should I speak? Poor mother! in this Jordan I have need To be baptized of you. My soul is wise In grief. Yet a few years and you shall smile— If you can smile—to think I taught ye. Tell me, What would your gallant boy, if tyrants bade him Shed Roman blood like rain? Look on your Roman! Mine was no less!—Was—Oh my heart! He hurl'd— His proud looks prouder than his words of pride,— With desperate hand the execrated sword Flagrant before the despot and defied him! Rent from his breast the gilt dishonour, spurn'd it Into Italian dust. Erect, defiant, Before the host cried Freedom! and was doom'd, Doom'd to a coward's death. They led him forth, They led him forth a pace upon the Lea, Scourged, buffeted, reviled, and only asking To die unbound, with his unconquer'd face Turn'd to the south and home. And they denied him. By a rude trench wher fresh-turn'd earth lay dark, He stood a passing moment, and since then I say ‘I had a brother.’; If I weep To see your child, forgive me, and remember When I drew near his sport this eve, and you Look'd on with smiles, and I with sighs, you marvell'd. Why marvel, when we saw not the same scene? Before you lay the happy evening world, O'er-joyous in the promise of more joy, And there he sported like a merry voice Singing of morrows. Mine eyes sought the same Point of the compass, but for me the shades In my dark soul went forth to meet the night, The night that look'd from grove and thicket, calling By missionary winds and twilight birds All earth to that meek face wherein she payeth Her duties to the moon. He sported, too, In my world, and 'twas sweet to look on him. But to my eyes, in ambient atmospheres Of tints and hues that brighten'd other days, Floated round smiling—like a choir of angels About a cherub—that old dreamy past, In which he plays my brother. Near his feet There was a long sad mound, and by the mound Dark drops of blood. And when he prattled out His childish joy, my heart heard distant muskets, And to my ear the heavy earth fell dead Into a coffinless grave. [The vesper bell sounds from the distant convent. Ave Maria! The Mother (throwing herself passionately to the ground). Ave Maria! Happy evermore, Oh Mater Unigeniti—save, save, Oh save my child! The Father. Ave Maria! Queen Of judgment that went forth to victory! Remember desolation blights the hills That slew the Crucified! Mother avenged! If my first-born must be like thine, grant vengeance Like thine! The Mother. If it must be— The Monk. Ave Maria! say It shall not be! Thou who didst bear salvation! Oh Virgin! thou who in thy breast didst carry The fate of worlds unfainting—give, give stength To these! The Father and Mother. Oh Mother, pity us!— The Monk. Oh Mother, Pity our country! Mater benedicta! Thou who three days didst watch a tomb in tears, Pity our vigil of a thousand years, And bid the dead arise! The Father and Mother. Oh Queen of sighs, Look down on us from thy fair heaven with eyes Softer than evening! The Mother. Mater casta, pia, Quondam afflicta—take him to thy skies! Even what thou wilt for me, but oh, for him Hast thou no place among thy seraphim? Is he not thine? Thou gavest him. Take, oh take The bright gift back, for a sad mother's sake, Oh Mother! The Monk. Ah? The Father. Amen! The Monk. Ave Maria! [They rise. The Father. Priest, hast thou no Amen? The Monk. Did I not tell you That you should crave my blessing, though it fell Black as a curse? The Mother. Alas! The Monk. Says the priest ill Who prays the mother's prayer? The Mother. Be merciful! The Monk. Nay, be you merciful. I look upon This gentle boy, and every blushing feature Of his young beauty cries for mercy— The Mother. Priest, If thou art false in all things as in this, God help thee. I have been a tender mother! The Monk. Thou filiocide! Why should he die? This land, Hath it no place for him? This Roman sunshine, Doth it fall strangely on his cheek? These flowers, Twine they not kindly with his hair, and peep With fondness in his brighter face? The Boy. Oh, mother, Tell him they love me. The Mother. Hush! my beautiful; What is there loves thee not? The Monk. Why should he die, Whom the whole world surrounds, and with chaste voices Woos to sweet life? You craven hearts! Who slew My brother, and shall slay your son? These hills? These woods that frown on you? The sun and moon, That look down on their ancient shrines, and smile That you adore their God? Tell me, what lot Is desperate which the heaven and earth condemn not? Did this land, which bore gods, spend all its strength In the sublime conception, and birth-worn Bring pigmies forth in these last days? What fate Made only Romans mortal? Is it written That when the oppressor meets the oppress'd, and one Dies, it must be the slave? You Romans!—stay, I have o'ershot myself. You will betray me. You have look'd on this child for five long years, Five long fond loving years, and never wish'd To save him—why should I— The Mother. Oh father, save him! Bid me die—on my knees— The Father. Peace. Priest, the cloud Is silent till it lightens; dost thou take me? The Monk. Thou hast a fearless eye. The Father. Priest, try my heart! The Monk. Ah, traitor! what? 'tis well. Yes, he for whom That fair boy prattles hath a lifelong preacher No father yet sat under unconverted. We men are calm or hurricane. The heart Fills silently, and at the last wrong bursts. He laughs his merry creed out at all hours, And day and night looks treason. The Father. Come the day When deeds shall back his looks! The Monk. Well said, brave Roman! Thy hand! and we are brothers. Shall we brook To see this Italy our fathers left us Held for an Austrian garden? The Father. Noble priest, Some say the garden bears strange fruit ere long, But the old soil is crop-sore, and craves fatting With German blood. The Monk. Ah? The Father. Hast thou heard some whispers The wind brings from Sardinia? Is it well? The Monk. All things are well, but silence and endurance. The Father. Bend here! the very spider on the wall Must not hear this— The Monk. (Ay, what so pitiful, So loathsome, but it may connive with kings?) The Father. Hark in thine ear. The jolly lords of Naples, Florence, Turin, Verona, ay, Modena, And some too near to name, ride bravely,—eh? What if the horse kick? The Monk. Ah? The Father. This is fair weather; Worse grubs have grown to butterflies. How now, If these same Duchies spread their wings Republics? What then, my Carbonaro? Is it well? The Monk. 'Tis well. The poorest living face hath grace Beside a death's-head. That fierce king did well Who slew the priests of Baal, hew'd down his groves, And spoil'd his altars. But that king did better Who crown'd Moriah. 'Tis a zealot's faith That blasts the shrines of the false god, but builds No temple to the true. The Father. Ay, what is Truth? Pilate lacks answer. The Monk. The bold man like thee, Who lays his life in a strange hand—— The Father (starting). Ah, Priest! His life—how now? The Monk. Jestest, my gentle Roman? Wronged men like us, sworn to such deeds as ours, Leave courtly phrases when they speak of treason. Alas, poor Italy! to tell his fortune To whom a priest's lips can bring home rebellion, Merits no sorcerer's fee. A truce to trifling. What wasted words are these! Thou art a father, Have I not said to thee this boy that is To die, may live—what more? The Father. No more. Sir Priest, Thou takest me ill. There is no wild rebellion So fierce I have not fire enough to light it. If I had rather chosen to be free, Of all men—so. Thou hast my faith, who holdest My halter. The Mother. And, by Heaven, thou hast it, Priest, Though we were freer than a thousand winds! Ay, and our lives a million million times Lived and died over, so thou wilt but save My child. The Monk. Have I not said it? Wherefore, friends, Is this unseemly turbulence of passion? Did you not call me to your solemn council? Had I not told you how my brother died? Had you not wept with vision of those pangs, Which in that boy's face yet shall rack your eyes?—— The Mother. Shall? Oh, my father! Oh, my father! The Monk. Shall. He who would conquer kings, himself must be The first king conquer'd. Shall a rebel start To hear rebellion? Shall I have my counsel Cried up and down the earth, like the small will Of vulgar majesty? He who would creep To sleeping game is silent. Will they stand Firm, think you, at the judgment and the scaffold, Who start beneath the lintel of their homes, And rave at evening chat? No. He must die. [The mother starts up, seizing a knife that lies near The Mother. Priest! I am but a woman, and a weak one! I think thee faithful, and in that thought bless thee. I am a wife, a wife, Priest, and a true one; I think him brave, and in that thought revere him; But let me doubt ye—only let me doubt ye— And I would wash that hearthstone in your blood, If but the poorest spatter on the wall Would save my child! The Monk (aside). Then by that chain I lead thee, Wild lioness. (Aloud.) There heaves a bosom meet To suckle Freedom. Calm thee, Roman mother, That yet shalt smile in Rome. The day may come To strike; till then seal up thine own hot lips, As thou wouldst seal thy foe's. Be true, a hero Shall call thee ‘mother!’ Fail but in thy fealty To the least word of mine, my heaviest grief Is bliss beside thy lightest. Peace. This seal Makes the bond perfect. Now to calmer counsel. Thou say'st, brave Roman, that our lords ride fiercely, That the steed chafes already—see! he throws them. Who vaults into the saddle? Every flock Has slain its pigmy swain—salvete greges! But, patriot, who shall lead the sheep to pasture, And keep the wolf at bay? The Father. Each separate state Must crown the sovereign people. The Monk. By what name Will men speak, think ye, of that seven-hill'd city, Within whose catacombs dominion sleeps, And in whose ruins Time himself walks lightly, Lest she should stir below? The Father. Rome. The Monk. And the rest, How do you name them? The Father. By the names they found Noble enough to strike in; thus, Milan. The Monk. And why? Is the sky bluer at Milan Than where we stand? Are the clouds red at noon? Or by what mystic omen doth the world Call for this christening? Doth Dame Nature, old, And yearning to be fruitful in her dotage, Breed names, and call them children? When you dream Of our Italian fatherland, it glitters With half a hecatomb of palaces, Each royal. Your free heart is sad. You frown. Strike off their crowns. Salute them commonweals, And wake up shouting ‘Glory!’ How now, Roman, If some strong arm stretching from sea to sea Sweep all your pasteboard kickshaws to the ocean, And leave us the broad field of Italy To build up Rome? Marvel not, gentle friends, Sprung out of yesterday, poor hearts, and growing Like creeping plants, even to the size and fashion Of what ye lean on—marvel not that we Who worship Freedom with one soul, adore her In different deity. As I have told you, Dark fanes and reverend trophies, stones that might Be portals to the world; the fossil limbs By which we build the giants of old time; Grey wonders stranger for decay; strange fragments Of forms once held divine, and still, like angels, Immortal everywhere; lone hermit columns, Whereto the ideal hath no space to add The pile they bore; stern pediments that look'd On altars where antipodes burnt incense, And the three arms of the great globe piled up Their several tribute; all the sacred shades Which the great Past receding from the world Casts out of heaven on earth;—these and like these, The high, the deep, the eternal, the unbounded, Were sponsors to my soul: and if my thought, Where your more nice and neoteric fancy Labours with townships, deals out continents, Think it no marvel. Listen. The sunrise Of that dread day which found me brotherless, Saw a pale face on a low bed. Despair Gave life by taking it. That evening's sun Fell on the empty pallet, and beside it An arm'd man, flush'd to wildness. Lost, alone, Every sweet structure of my heart in heaps, With the one terrible shock; mazed, ignorant Of all things but the one which cast them forth, The desolation in my soul cried out, And rushing to the ruins I fell down, The darkest ruin of all. I knelt and wept, And was a child before them, with the madness Of a man's heart. I fell upon my face. Strange sleep possess'd me. Through the hot short night, Across the hotter desert of my brain My life went past. All seasons new and old, All hours of day and night, all thoughts, fears, fancies, Born on this spot, met as in after-death About me; and of each my tatter'd heart Begg'd healing and found none. At each new face I look'd up wild with hope, and look'd down fierce With chafed expectance. Then I rose and cursed All hope, all thought, all knowledge, all belief, And fell down still believing. With each hour In my spent soul some lingering faith went out, Woes that began in fire had burnt to blackness, The very good within me had grown grim, The frenzy of my shipwreck'd heart had thrown Its last crust overboard—then, then, oh God! Then in the midnight darkness of my passion, The veil was rent which hid the holy of holies, And I beheld and worshipp'd. Mad despair Rung out the desperate challenge—‘What art thou, Unpitying presence! which for years beside These stones hast stood before me, pass'd me, touch'd me, Shook my blind sense, and seal'd my eyes from seeing? Tell me, that I may curse thee!’ The sun rose. Forth towards me as in awful adjuration Each ruin stretch'd appealing shades. There came Soft lightning on my soul, and by a voice Ineffable, and heard not with the ears, ‘Rome.’ At that sound a thousand thousand voices Spread it through all things. Each imperial column, Each prone grey stone, touch'd by the eloquent winds, Heard it and gave it back. Trees, woods and fountains In musical confusion, leaves, buds, blossoms— Even to small flowers unseen, with voices smaller Than treble of a fay—atoms of sound Whereof a thousand falling on one ear, The unwitting sense should count them troubled silence— Birds, brooks, and waterfalls,—all tongues of dawn, The very morning hum of summer time, Swell'd the sweet tumult; early mists that lay Silent on hill-tops, vocal in the sun Roll'd off like waves of voices, the stirr'd air Sung with bright ecstasy. Down came the thunder, Like a vast hull cleaving the sea of sound, That lash'd up louder; then the hills cried out, And emulous the valleys; all the earth Shook with the sounding ardour, and methought My flush'd soul, drunk with zeal, leap'd high and shouted, Rome! With that name, incomprehensible beauty Fill'd the still gratulate air from earth to heaven, And knowing I knew not. Even as one dead I fell. As though that one great sight accomplish'd All consciousness, and the progressive sense Reaching the goal stood still. Ere I awoke, The sun had mounted the proud throne of noon, Received the homage of the world, and stept From his high-place well-pleased. Calm, brave, serene, Refresh'd as from a sleep of ages, weak As a birth-weary mother, but yet strong In cast-out sorrows, I stood up and gazed With long looks of sweet wonder. The fierce craving In my lank hungry soul had ceased. The thirst That burn'd my heart was quench'd. The mystic yearning For something ever near, and ever far, That made my life one dream of wasting fever, Was over. All those indistinct strange voices Wherein, like waters underground, great truths Were heaving in my heart, and lash'd its sides To bursting; those dim tones wherein, like fragrance From troubled flowers at midnight, unseen balm Went up in my dark soul, all the forerunners, The thousand messengers by which this night Had told me it would come,—all partial knowledge Before the consummation fell away As things that had no office; wither'd up Like blossom on the fruit. Thus it must be That noble man who deems his nature born As vast as truth, must sweat, and toil, and suffer, And overcome—enduring. When the heart Adds a new planet to its heaven, great portents Clash the celestial influence; strange signs Of coming dread, mysterious agencies, And omens inconceivable convulse The expectant system, while the stranger sails Still out of sight in space. Dim echoings Not of the truth, but witnessing the truth— Like the resounding thunder of the rock Which the sea passes—rushing thoughts like heralds, Voices which seem to clear the way for greatness, Cry advent in the soul, like the far shoutings That say a monarch comes. These must go by, And then the man who can outwatch this vigil Sees the apocalypse. Oh that first hour Within the Eden of a quiet soul! Oh for that bounteous hour, to him whose youth, Bred up in grief's sad penury, hath found Joy's daily pittance all too poor to lay One pleasance by; oh that Pierian hour When first the plenteous life o'erwelling sends Its irrigating streams before the face Of the young hope, and decks, in frondent distance, To-morrow with the verdure of to-day. That hour when first the slipping foot grows firm Upon some plot of present, and we gaze From the sufficient rock with softening eyes Across the green sweet pastures of the future, And for the first time dare to look on them As heritage. How the exulting thoughts, Like children on a holiday, rush forth And shout, and call to every humming bee, And bless the birds for angels! Oh that hour! In the reflected sunshine of remembrance My heart is melting. Twilight and the dews Proclaim me parlous. 'Tis a sorry string That, being struck, is silent. Farewell Romans. Meet me to-morrow here. This is no mood To plan stern deeds. Farewell. Remember, courage, Truth, silence. If you fail in either, look Upon your boy. SCENE VII. A lonely Spot. The turf-grown site of some old Roman Amphitheatre. A meeting of Minstrels. An aged Bard presides. The Monk enters. The Monk (to a Minstrel). Sir, I have walk'd far and crave a seat. Minstrel (to another). His reverence Is weary and would sit. Is it against The statutes of our order? Second Minstrel. Holy Sir, There are good feet that do not walk Parnassus. Behold us here a minstrel convocation, And deem it no irreverence if we say, That in that company of bards a priest Lacks civic rights. The Monk. Sir, thou art not yet free Of that most holy guild. Thy soul hath yet To learn the instinctive flight which cleaves the air Of immortality. I do perceive As yet it wings by sight. The dove that bears The poet's message starts from that pure height Where earthly fashions fade. Let common eyes Read men in frock and cowl. The creeping thing That harbours in the bark knows not the region Where the fruit hangs. I hoped, Sirs, to find here A nobler estimation. Another Minstrel. And thou shalt. Others. Bravo! Well said. Hear Giulio! Another. This guitar, Its face, Sir Priest, like mine, is brown with age; Find me the newest dainty from Cremona That dares a bar with it! Another. Or mine, and yet 'Twas the sole heritage my grandsire left. Another. Would we, Sir Priest, exchange these twisted entrails For chords of gold? Another. Faith, I would string my lute With hangman's hemp, if it made music. Others. Ay, And I. And I. And I. The President. Sir and good father, You see us here a humble company— I speak the language of the world, Sir, nor Affirming nor denying—(the wayfarer Of many lands is not responsible For each vernacular)—Sir, in what stature We may be seen by the renewing angel Some few years hence I say not, but you see us Being what we are, met to pursue an art Lightly esteem'd, but which to name divine Is not the filial rapture of a son, Since in the change of time it hath not changed; Indigenous to all the earth. A spirit Evoked by many, but a bound familiar To no magician yet. The equal tenant Of loftiest palace and of lowliest cot, Treading the rustic and the royal floor To the same step and time. In every age, With all the reverence that man claims as man, Preaching to clouted clown, and with no more To thronèd kings. The unrespective friend— In such celestial wise as gods befriend— By turns of haughtiest monarch, humblest swain; And with impartial love and power alike Ennobling prince and peasant. Giving all, Receiving never. What else makes a god? What human art looks so divine on earth? And, as you tell us, seraphs in high heaven Find nothing worthier. Sir, accept me well, Let not these lutes, pipes, harps, and dulcimers, And outward signs of the musician's trade, Mis-teach you of us. Reverend Sir, believe not That—priests of Harmony—our service knows One only of her temples. Sir, we hope One day to serve her where the ears of flesh Cannot inherit; where material sounds Enrobe no more her pure divinity. And we, uncumber'd by the aids of sense, Shall see, and in the silent universe Adore her. Holy Sir, each minstrel here Is poet also. The Monk. Canst thou tell me, friend What 'tis to be a poet? President. Such the theme Of this day's contest. The Monk. Let me strike a string In such a strife. President. Read thou this riddle for us, And, father, this my chair I abdicate, And crown thee king of bards. The Monk. Nay, friend, forbear— Prithee no kings. I would believe, good brother, All honest here. Have you a kind harp, friends, That for a stranger's sake will do sweet duty In unaccustomed hands? One. Take mine. Another. Or mine. Another. Or mine. Another (aside). Now, Sackcloth! Another (aside). Look to hear Apollo Discourse Church music! Another (aside). To the buttery-hatch, Ye strolling thrummers. 'Tis alms-giving day, My life the godly almoner is good At broken victuals. How many stale masses, Crusts scriptural and classic bones—— Another. Fie, Henri. Thy wanton ditty! Henri. Ingrate! wot I not The priest was coming? Another (aside). Hush, clean ears, clean ears, A psalm at least! Another. Surely the Song of Songs. Henri. Ay, but no Solomon's. Others. Friends, friends, friends, Silence. The Monk sings. The poet bends above his lyre and strikes— No smile, no smile of rapture on his face;— The poet bends above his lyre and strikes, No fire, no fire of passion, in his eye;— The poet bends above his lyre and strikes, No flush, no prophet's flush, upon his cheek;— Calm as the grand white cloud where thunders sleep, Like a wrapt listener—not in vain to listen— Feeling the winds with every sense to catch Some far sound wandering in the depths of space, The poet bends above his lyre and strikes. [Interlude of music. The poet bends above his lyre and strikes. Ah Heaven! I hear! Again. Ah Heaven, I hear! Again:—the vacant eyes are moist with tears! Again:—they gleam with vision. Bending lower, Crowding his soul upon the strings.—Again. Hark, hark, thou heart that leapest! Ye thrill'd fibres! See the triumphant minstrel in the dust, To his own music. Hark! Angels in heaven Catch it on golden harps! Down float their echoes Richer than dews of Paradise. Inspired, Tuning each chord to the enchanted key, The poet sweeps the strings and wakes, awe-stricken, The sounds that never die. From hill to hill They vibrate round the world of time, as deep Calleth to deep. [Here the Monk ceases to sing. But note like this stirs not The wind of every day. And 'tis the ear To know it, woo it, wait for it, and stand Amid a Babel deaf to other speech, That makes a poet. And from ear like this, That troubling of the air which common men Call harmony, falls unrespected off, As balls from a charm'd life. Hear yet again A better parable. The good man hears The voice in which God speaks to men. The poet, In some wrapt moment of intense attendance, The skies being genial and the earthly air Propitious, catches on the inward ear The awful and unutterable meanings Of a divine soliloquy. Soul-trembling With incommunicable things, he speaks At infinite distance. So a babe in smiles Repeats the unknown and unknowable Joys of a smiling mother. President. Victor, hail! How say you, friends—a triumph? Many. Crown him, crown him! The Monk. Good friends, fair brothers, how have I deserved this? Whose chattels have I seized, whose hearth profaned, Whom have I slain, whose daughter have I ravish'd, That you should cry of crowns? President. Sir, reverend Sir, This chair of state is yours. All. Ascend, ascend! The Monk. Friends, brother bards, since thus you bid me call you, With a long weary journey must I buy The honours of this moment? When I spent Those labours—all my wealth—they were disbursed In the shrewd estimate that so much outlay Invested in your wisdom could but yield A goodly increase. Only on such venture Prudence, the soul's stern sacristan, paid down The perils of this pilgrimage. Which of you, Receiving wherewithal to buy a harp, Shall spend it on a chaplet? Which among you, Playing the overture to some mild air Of sweet attendance and humility, Succeeds it with a march? My gentle friends, Let me go even as I came,—as much Wiser as you may please—in all things else No wit less humble. Sir, and my good father, Resume the place of honour. These grey hairs And time-taught looks beseem it. I beseech you, Speak more at length. Methinks the chorister years Must needs chant nobly in such reverend walls. For me, I claim the seat of a disciple, And if in any wise I have excell'd, And I yet fear, dear friends, you do mistake The stature of your courtesy for that Of my desert—reward me, ere we part, With one more hearing. Many shout. Ten! Agreed. Agreed. Agreed. Long live the Monk. Well said! President. Companions, You have heard the conqueror. While we have forgotten Our wonted duties for this episode, The unoblivious sun hath paused not once; Our time is far spent, and five harps are still Unstruck. Hath any brother yet unheard Any unbaptized child of voice or lute Born since our last song-feast, whereon he craves Fraternal benediction? Let each such Stand forth. A Minstrel. I have a tale of rural pity, Set in a rustic measure to such music As the uncertain winds, and rustling leaves, And devious sounds of night made round the heads Of them it sings. A very simple sorrow, To be heard only in the silent hours It sigh'd in. Use it gently, Sirs; I call it ‘The Winter's Night.’ President. Acquit thee, brother! All. Hear! Minstrel sings. And she stood at its father's gate, At its father's gate she stood, With her baby at her breast; 'Twas about the hour of rest— There were lights within the place— The old moon began to sink, (Long, like her, upon the wane,) It grew dark; she drew her hood Close about her pallid face; At the portal down she sate, Where she will not sit again. ‘Little one,’ she slowly said, Bending low her lowly head, ‘In all this wide world only thee, And my shame, he gave to me. When thou camest I did think On that other gift of his— Hating that I dreaded this. Thou art fair—but so was he; 'Tis a winning smile of thine,— Ah! what fatal praise it is!— One such smile once won all mine. Little one, I not repine, It befits me well to wait My lord's will, till I be dead— Once it was a gentler will!’ With that, a night-breeze full chill, Shook some dead leaves from the lime; At the sad sound, loud and burly Like a warder, went the blast Round about the lordly house; Hustled her with menial wrath, Much compelling forth her cast, Who was all too fain to go; She sank down upon the path— She cower'd lower, murmuring low, ‘What was I that I should earn, For I loved him, more return Than I look'd for of the sun, When he smiled upon me early In our merry milking-time?’ Then was silence all; the mouse Rustled with the beechen mast, The lank fox yelp'd round, the owl Floating, shriek'd pale horror past; Strange and evil-omen'd fowl Croak'd about her, and knew not. Round her had the last bat fed. ‘Little one,’ she said, ‘the cot Where I bore thee was too low For a haughty baron's bride. Little one, I hope to go Where the palace-halls are wide; When thou prattlest at his knee, Wilt thou sometimes speak of me? Tell him, in some eve,’ she said, ‘Where thou knowest I shall be. When he hears that I am grand, In those mansions ever fair, Will he look upon me there As a lady of the land, And think no more in scorn Upon thee and on the dead?’ All below the garden banks, Where the blighted aspens grew, Faded leaves faint breezes blew, As in pity, round her. Then Low whispering in her plaintive plight, Her shivering babe she nearer nurst. ‘'Tis a bitter night,’ said she, ‘Little one, a dreary night. Little shalt thou bless the first, Pass'd upon thy father's ground. Ay! cower closer in thy nest, Birdie! that didst never build. There is warmth enough for thee, Though the frost shall split the tree Where it rocks.’ ‘Little one,’ she said again, ‘Babe,’ she said, ‘my little son, Thou and I at last must part; There is in my freezing heart Only life enough for one. By the crowing of the cocks, Early steps will tread the way, Could mine arms but wrap thee round Till the dawning of the day!’ Silent then she seem'd to pray, Then she spoke like one in pain, ‘Little one, it shall be done, I will keep thee back no more; It were sweet to go together, If thou couldst be mine alone; As it is I must restore Treasure not mine own. All the gift and the sweet thanks Will be over by to-morrow. He must weep some tears to see What at morn they will bring in Where she dared not living come. He will take thee to his home, And bless the mother in the child. Little one, 'tis sweet to me, Who once gave him all I had— Hoped it duty, found it sin— Once more to give all, but now Take no shame, and no more sorrow Than a death-pang sets at rest.’ Closer then her babe she prest, Chiller sank the wintry weather. Once again the owl cried near, Once more croak'd the strange night-bird; From the stagnance of the fosse Lorn pale mists, like winding-gear, Hung about her and look'd sad; Then the blast, that all this while Slumber'd by a freezing fountain, Burst out rudely, like a prince From a midnight revel rushing, In his train a thousand airs, Each ambitious of his guilt, Each as cruel, cold and wild, Each as rugged, chill and stark, Hurtled round their leader crushing All the fretwork of the dark; Frosty palace, turret and tower, Mosque and arabesque, mist-built By winter-fairies. Then, grown gross With the licence of the hour, They smote the mother and the child! Dark night grew darker, not a smile Came from one star. The moon long since Had sunk behind the mountain. At the mirkest somewhat stirred The sere leaves, where the mother sate; For a moment the babe cried, Something in the silence sigh'd, And the night was still. Oh fate! What hadst thou done? Oh that hard sight Which morn must see! When Winter went About the earth at dawn, he rent His locks in pain, and cast grey hairs Upon it as he past. So when Maids, poor mother, wail thy lot— Mournful at the close of day— By that legendary spot Oft they tell us, weeping, how Hoar frost lay on thy pale brow When they found thee, and was not Paler than the clay. A Minstrel. A grievous tale! The Monk. Where's he that dares to say so? Liar! thou art not grieved. Any vile Austrian May serve thy sister so to-morrow night, And he that wears the longest sword among ye Shall fear to draw it! A young Minstrel. Here's my blade! Show me The bloodless German! The Monk. Youth! respect thy master! Dost thou talk treason? What, boy, if the German Be bloodless? He hath blood enough to rule thee! Tut! sheath thy maiden sword—leave pantomime To puppets—I but said thou art not grieved. And I said well. Such thews as thine being grieved Ne'er yet were idlers. Tut, tut, man, be grateful, Thine owner feeds thee well. I never saw A sleeker slave. The Minstrel. Slave! President. Friends, friends, friends, I pray you, Silence. Benvolio's song! A Minstrel. I have a fancy About a rose; sung on the morn I saw My mother's first grey hair. Let your harsh thoughts Breathe gently on it—it is overblown. Oh maiden! touch gently the rose overblown, And think of the mother thy childhood hath known; Smile not on the buds that exult from her stem, Lest her pallor grow paler that thou lovest them. From their beauties, oh maid, each bright butterfly chase, 'Till his duties are paid to that dew-faded face, And forbid the gay bee one deceitful sweet tone, Till his vows are all said to the rose overblown. Sorrow, oh maid, is more grateful than bliss, Rosebuds were made for the light breeze to kiss. And woo how thou wilt in the soft hope to see Some bright bursting blossom that blooms but for thee, Weep thy fond wish, thou shalt look up to find Thy tears worn as gems to beguile the next wind. Turn then thine eyes to the rose overblown, Speak of its place in a tremulous tone, Sigh to its leaves as they fall one by one, And think how the young hopes the heart used to own Are all shedding fast—like the rose overblown. Yes, turn in thy gloom to the rose overblown, Reverently gather each leaf that hath gone, Watch every canker and wail every streak, As thou countest the lines on thy mother's dim cheek; Twilight by twilight, and day after day, Keep sweet attendance on sweeter decay. When all is over weep tears—two or three— And perchance long years hence, when the grass grows o'er thee, Fond fragrant tribute to days long by-gone, Shall be shed on thy grave by some rose overblown. The Monk. We are a wealthy people In all the faculties of woe. We have Our sighs for roses, elegies for sparrows, And seas of salt tears for deceased gold-fish; We eat our pet lambs in a mourning robe, And bury gamecocks with ‘the point of war.’ And since we weep no tears for thee, my country, It needs must be thou hast deserved thy death. Rome, Rome! I was deceived; I thought thee murder'd. Ay, foully, foully murder'd! A Minstrel. Thou hast thought Well. Others. Bravo, Pietro! Others. Hear him! The Monk. This is treason. A priest, I cannot hear my sovereign slander'd! One word more, I denounce you! The President. Friends, attend! Silence! Vicenzo, venerable brother, Methinks I heard thy harp. Its youthful strings Sound to me through the music of those years, Those threescore years, since first we play'd together, As the dear voice of a beloved girl, In virgin throng of louder choristers, While all the troop contend before the ear, Passeth alone and free to the hid heart. Dreaming of youth doth make me young again! Friend, thou hast been a man of grief, and though My dream of thy first music be a dream, Thy sounds to-day are sweeter. Such a touch Hath gracious wisdom. The great harmony Of a most sad sweet life hath been play'd out Upon those strings, and sympathetic chords Repeat it. Holy brother, there are some In this good company who know thee not. Forego the privilege of years, and lift, A moment, all the mantle from thine heart. Our eyes are blind with noonday, and our brows Ache with the tropics. Let us with chaste awe Stand in the mellow evening of thy voice, Before the old man's soul—the rayless sun Seen through the mist of sorrows. Thanks, dear brother, That strain replies. I hear it, like a chime To vespers. Vicenzo. Friend, why is thy speech of ‘brothers?’ My brother died. I heard last night, in the dark, How the first Christians spake to one who went Where I shall soon behold him. Some. Good Vicenzo! Others. Hear! Others. Hear Vicenzo. Vicenzo. Clamorous sirs, you are wise. Give your praise now. You will need all your silence When I have sung. The men of whom I speak Lived by the prime tradition, ere the hands Of ages soil'd it, or the guilt that shrunk Before that bare intolerable witness Bound it in gems and purple. Sirs, my lay Is simple as their faith. [He sings. Brother, there is a vacant spot within our holy band, And poorer is our earthly lot by one strong heart and hand. Yet, brother, it were ill to weep, when life hath been so drear, That we are left alone to keep its painful vigil here. 'Twere ill if thou hast trod the way to count the labouring hours, Or mourn that sorrow fill'd thy cup with hastier hand than ours. Sleep softly by thy bending tree, till death's long sleep be o'er, That thou canst not remember, we remember thee the more. Sleep softly,—that thine heart hath pass'd through all death's deep distress, To such calm rest as now thou hast, shall make us dread it less. Sleep softly, brother, sleep. But oh, if there are hopes more blest Than sleep, where seasons come and go about a dreamless rest; If we may deem this grave a shrine which summer rites observe, Where autumn pours the votive wine, and white-robed winters serve; If we may think that those who now sit side by side with God, Have sent for thee to ask thee how we tread the path they trod; Oh, brother, if it be not sin when God hath broke the chain Of earthly thought, to bind thee in its fever'd links again, This much of all that earth did know, and all that life hath given, The sadness of our love below bequeathes thy bliss in heaven; Remember what the bounden bear, though thou for aye art free, And speak of us as kindly there, as here we think of thee. The Monk. ‘Remember what the bounden bear!’ Old man, We cannot sing this song. There may be lands Where chains are heavy. Here in Italy We wear them as the draught-ox wears his bells— One. Priest! The Monk. Hark that martial strain! Ye Gods, do all Dead tongues cry out at once? A Minstrel. You Romans! see The vision of Quirinus! The Monk. Ha, ha, ha! The Minstrel (sings) Who shall say what thoughts of glory life's mean paths unhonour'd tread, Like those rays of distant suns, that pass us, viewless, overhead? For the heaviest heart that sleepeth hath its heavy sleeping dream, Like the dull light on the ripple of a duller twilight stream; But, oh poet, if the dullard hath a soul beyond thy ken, Who shall paint the hero's vision, who among the sons of men? Who shall paint him, wrapt and lonely, when the god within him speaks, And the passing skirts of Fate smite the blood into his cheeks; When the future on the ocean of his great soul hangs like night, And some hull of thought comes ploughing all its midseas into light? Who shall paint him leaning on the Present, standing on the Past, Gazing o'er the furthest Future deep into the stormy Last; Gazing where on the remotest verge the nether mists are riven,— A giant with an oak-tree staff, looking from sea-sands to heaven? [Interlude of music. One dull day of indolence, the new-thatch'd city being all built, On his sheath'd sword bent Quirinus, with his hand upon the hilt. Round the sun's hid place on high all the stolid heaven was dead, All the flat-floor'd earth below him look'd a temple domed with lead; Not a voice from all the forests! not a beam from all the floods! Sadder for that early autumn, like cold sunshine, lit the woods. Far, the arms of Latian hills held on high a city of power; With the eye of lust Quirinus burnt its beauties tower by tower, Till the conscious Latian hills, jealous of the conqueror's mien, Proudly drew the mists of morning, decent, round the ravish'd scene. Waking from the imperial dream, said Quirinus, looking towards Rome, ‘So the mist of time descending hides me from the years to come!’ Near, below, a rushing torrent its long dance of beauty led, And a forest beast of grandeur cross'd it with a stately tread; Golden ran the rapid river gleaming though the skies were cold, Far into the Sabine distance, mantling with its sands of gold. Said Quirinus, sad, but proudly, gazing with a look sublime, ‘Gods! so fording life, would I send golden sands down streams of time!’ He look'd up to heaven, and he look'd down upon the river strand: Smiling through the crystal water, shining lay the untroubled sand. Said Quirinus, proud, but sadly, gazing upon frith and firth, ‘Gods! so shall the tide of ages rase my footsteps from the earth!’ Sat the sun in his pavilion; the dark drapery, stern and even, Hanging earthward. Before noon the west winds dancing through high heaven, Fill'd with sudden mirth, drew back the giant folds with hands profane; Pleased he saw the earth, and like a young hot prince began to reign. All this while Quirinus bent heroic eyes that could not weep, On a tear of dew that lay dull amid the grass asleep; Even while he gazed a sunbeam, slanting from its radiant path, Dipt into the dew, and came forth like a goddess from the bath. Then Quirinus—‘That such lot were mine, ye arbiters afar! Gods! ye touch the sleeping water and it wakens to a star!’ While he looks the sun is higher, while he looks the star grows old, While he looks, the dews are lying, as the dews lie, dead and cold. Then Quirinus—all the hero looking sadness while he said, ‘Gods! so shall the sun of glory one day leave me cold and dead!’ Then he gazed, as heroes gaze, upon whom,—conscious,—earth and skies Seem gazing back. To their live silence all his living soul replies, ‘Thou who knowest me, whom thus I know,—Eternal as thou art, Oh thou visible! how is it with me in thy silent heart?’ Then the rock beside him crumbled in the noon-heat stone by stone, ‘Gods! the very earth may rot ere a fame like mine be grown!’ Then a salt wind—like a sea-ghost sick of land—faint voices bore, ‘Gods! but once to hear the ages booming on the future shore!’ Then he look'd the sun in the face, like an eagle in his death-sorrow. ‘Gods! the very stars themselves are nearer to us than to-morrow!’ Then in rapture, all the godhead of his line about his brow— ‘Mother! Dionæan Mother! that the years to come were now!’ Soft Idalian incense laid him languid on the amorous sod. At the softest a great thunder shook the mountain like a god. Starting from the Paphian trance, the hero leap'd in the sunlight, All his sudden soul o'erlooking the dull sense of mortal sight; Staring, staring in the air, high over the Roman town, Staring, staring pale and deadly where the future years came down. Dost thou see them, as I see them, like a great mist sinking slow, With the unborn dead o'er-pictured, and the things that shall be? Lo, Woes that throw no shade on joy; joys that shed no light on woe, Flush'd with being yet to be, full of soul that makes no sign, Tarquin chaste beside Lucretia, Tullius mute by Catiline. Dost thou see them, as I see them, like a haze upon the sky, Painted with dumb agonies, and woes that neither strive nor cry; Spell-bound victors unpursuing, routed hosts that do not fly; Lifeless in the form of life, with ineffectual grandeur great, As the foemen, Good and Ill, twin-slumber in the womb of Fate? Dost thou see them, as I see them, dread as when the demon of rain From cloudland verge shakes out a veil of storms across the lower plain? Dost thou see them, wider, wider, from the mountains to the main, Peopling, peopling either heaven, till troubled with the infinite sight, Both horizons flush'd at once attest them in distemper'd light? [Interlude of music. Dost thou see them, as I see them, like a great mist sinking slow, From the everlasting height, floating in celestial show, Silent, vast, like heaven unroll'd, to the eternal hills below? Lo! they touch the earth. Ye Gods! are mine eye-balls crazed with wine? Shock of life, like midnight lightning, shouts along the leaping line. Lo! the children of the ages on the fields of fame beneath, Each in clamour springs from sleep as one day he shall spring from death. Gods! that cry of startled being! Gods! that din of life sublime, Each convulsive form begins the many-colour'd work of time, Each in agony of action flashes through his frenzied part, As in deadly moments years of life gleam through the heaving heart, Gods! I shall go wild with sight! Whirling arms and lambent eyes, Raging, clash in sounds that mock the sadder surge of shrieks and sighs; Each assumes the sudden future, each in turn defied defies, Stream in air the Sabine tresses, Brutus strikes and Cæsar dies! So some host of rayless meteors smite our air, and mad with might, Burst in storms of stars, and charge in flaming legions through the night. All this while Quirinus stood, wrapt as the Python, grand as Jove, His face a microcosm, wherein the passions of the ages strove. Downward, downward, solemn and slow, the dreamy pageant dim descends, A man's height upward life,—no more. In heaven the dead, on earth the fiends. Downward, downward, till the valley, line unconscious line succeeds, Mingling yet a moment lifeless with the life that strives and bleeds. See the insatiate plain engulf! See the still renew'd array, Touching earth, explode with life, and hurtling sink out of the day. Gods! the tapestries of heaven o'erwrought with fate, majestic, fell, And burnt upon the earth, and dropt their flaming fragments into hell! See on high incessant hosts, to where the heavenly vistas close, And the very height of heights with a higher advent glows, Dyed with change: as I have seen when wild meridian moons are bright, Stormy dreams of rainbows colour all the troubled soul of night. See below exhaustless life—hark the still-renewing roar Of successive being kindling from the mountains to the shore! Tumult as of full-grown nations starting into crashing birth; Tumult, tumult, wide as heaven, wild along the rocking earth; Tumult, tumult, from the dizzy maddening mounts' distracted crowd, Pealing out till both horizons own it like a bloody cloud! With such flame and thunder, in the Gallic madman's vision dark, So the ordnance of the world, drawn up, might hail the Omniarch! All this while Quirinus stood, gazing with a wilder gaze, Heaving with a Delphic fury, shouting to the coming days! Warm'd into the gait of time, he springs before the march of things, Imperial with an age of empire, royal with a world of kings! Stand, Quirinus! Hold thine own! Reel not, giant drunk with power! Did no demigod come down to stay thee in that desperate hour, When fortune blew her loudest blast, and, mindful of the ills in store, Play'd a flourish ere she changed her awful stop for evermore; And Rome, upon the hill of fame, above whose height the thunderer nods, Culminated like a globe, and paused before the gasping gods, Awhile in dreadful poise. One moment suns smiled on it dark and cold, And lit a star. It shone. And then (like that tremendous stone of old) Recoiling to infernal depths shook heaven, down-whirling as it fell, Through red storms of molten glories lash'd up from the soil of hell! How shalt thou behold that hour? for ah! the generous and the brave Spring upon the surge of fate, but ebb not with the ebbing wave. In that hour the Dionæan caught him up to heaven; that he Beholding as a god beholdeth, seeing, might survive to see! The Monk (stepping forward). Ye spell-bound men, Who stand and stare each other in the face As though it were an auspice, do you dare Behold on earth what your translated Sire Saw from the heavens? Didst thou not even there, Oh hero! with thy strong humanities Startle the impassive Gods; with mortal cries Stir the still air of immortality, And with thine earthly faculty of tears Distain the empyrean? [Silence. They whisper among themselves. President. Sir, and brother, Show us this vision. The Monk. Doth the heart speak there? Wot you there have been sights ere now which turn'd The seer into stone? There have been words Which made graves tenantless, and hunt the dead Shrieking through hell. There have been tongues that smote The lazy air wherein the gnat did dance, And it hath dropp'd down molten on a soul, And branded it for ever. You know this, And you will hear? A Shout. And we will hear! The Monk. Your blood Be on your heads! A Shout. Be on our heads and thine! The Monk. And mine. If ye be brothers, I shall die With you, and if not, by you. Death is death. [He is silent. The President (after awhile). My brother, we attend thee. The Monk. You will hear me? You will behold? I do beseech that man Who owns a faint heart, friends, to bear it forth Beyond your patriot circle; half a bowshot Will save him. I shall speak low. By the gods, It should be sung in whispers. What! not one? What! you draw nearer? Be not rash, my brothers, Those Cretan mazes that outlie the heart Can no man tread so swiftly. I shall pause. [He is silent—then continues. It is a fearful thing to stand in the path Of destiny. Here on this bridge am I, And you, poor souls, upon the fateful bank Roam up and down, and cast your wistful eyes To the Cimmerian shores, whose twilight reign Your sense, acclimated to Acheron, Mistakes for day. I hold ye back, poor shades, And with a right hand blister'd with the flames, Point to a way of fire. You cannot see The Elysian fields beyond it, and what god Commands you to believe me? My poor brothers, Pass. Some. This is madness! Some. Hush! behold him. Others. Wake, Dreamer! The Monk. I can see nothing in the heaven Or earth why next year should be worse than this; I do not learn from any sign in the sky That you shall dance less lightly at the fair, Or drink your pottle weaker at the wake, Or find the wench less willing at the wedding, Or sing less often in the castle hall, Or think the rich man's nod a poorer fee, Or sit less thankful at the menial's fare, Or rear one chubby slave the less or more, Or share their mother on worse usury With yonder German—— Some. Shame—— Others. Hold! Others. Are we clowns? Others. Peace. Hear him out—hear the priest out. Down with him. Hear him. Hear, hear, hear, hear him out. Down with him. The Monk. 'Tis a hard fate. As yet you are not guilty; As yet the dull Maremma of the future From the mephitic stagnance of the past Stretches as unforbidden. But hear me, And the Egyptian curse turns it to blood! Yet you might tread it—with the march of life Stir the pestiferous slime of days, till weak Or sturdy vitals, soon or late, drop each In his appointed hole. Why should I speak? Friends, 'tis a fearful time. As yet your eyes Have not been open'd to know good from evil. The dread of the great hour before the fall Gathers upon my soul. Now must I do The miracle which paints the universe. You stand before me here all men, all brothers, And I must give you sight. And, seeing, he Who is not straight transfigured to a saint, Must blacken to a fiend. This is that water That rots the adulteress—dare ye drink? Some. Now mercy! Others. Ay, ay, ay, to the dregs. Others. Pour, priest, pour, pour. One. S'death! do you mock us? Speak! The Monk. I pray you, patience, I pray you, patience. These are times, my brothers, When the grand Roman habit is a dress For no man's masquerade. [They continue to shout.] Beseech you, patience, Patience, sweet friends! The cap of liberty Is not a carnival wear. There are laws, friends,— You have not read them—they are writ in German, But they are laws. And by the laws the blush Of shame is disaffected and forbidden, The proud tears of a patriot are not loyal, The thoughts of good men are against the statute; Who would speak like a freeman must content him To walk a chain or two more like a slave. I break no laws. I tell you by the laws To inherit from your sires is robbery, To think what you are thinking is rebellion, To take the counsel of the brave is treason, To strike a despot on his throne is death. I do entreat you, friends, obey the laws! If you were heroes I must hold my peace. I should have sinn'd already. By the laws You should not see this sight if you were heroes; But slaves! behold! [The Monk sings. Some sad slow strain— Deep wails and plaintive pain, With thy most sorrowy soul, my harp, remember! Hie where in some lone spot, By the cold hearth of a forsaken cot, A dying orphan cowers by the last ember! To some unseen green space Of a deserted place, Where the pale grass and the lorn flowers are holy; And of remorseless wrong, In mournful gusts and long, Winds cry at eve, where the betray'd lies lowly: And with them, as they float— The wail and the wind note— Thy woes most sweet bewilderments entwine; And, harp! thou hast not found One desolate sad sound That does not ring like laughter on a grief like mine. My harp! how oft, when cold And worn with cares untold, With hearts untrue, stern looks, and sunless brows, Thy first sweet breath that stole Stirr'd incense in my soul, Like the south wind among the myrtle boughs. But there are in our lot Thoughts where earth's sounds come not— Like the eternal calm of the mid-seas— And all that might have been And all that is,—oh Queen Of minstrelsy, thou hast no voice for these. I hear, soul-wrapt, thy song In stirring notes and strong, High wandering in the years for ever flown; To my exulting sight The gorgeous Past comes bright! In the broad earth too poor for her renown, Italia, great and wise, Sits, and to golden skies Lifts the grand brow which clouds contend to crown. But, oh! if in that hour Of calm unchallenged power, Some vision of prescient fate supreme Forewarn her in mid-pride Of all that must betide, Who, who may sing the anguish of that dream? Thy straining strings should start As breaks her bursting heart, And all thy broken chords confess the unconquer'd theme! Return, my harp, return Beside this broken urn, Count the long days low lying where it lies; Have all thy wandering will! With fitful fancies fill Long interludes of ill! With sweeping blasts and strange unearthly cries, Swift laughter, hurrying fears, Madness, and joys, and tears, And every mood that wayward wildness tries, These are the wingèd years! They pass. And where is she whose greatness claims the skies? Behold her! wan and fair, Her pale arm soil'd and bare, That trembles in the intolerable chain— Behold the woes that rise To her undying eyes, Too proud to faint and too imperial to complain; Behold her bend and grieve From shameful morn to eye, And till, with captive hands, the graves that hide her Slain! Behold the toil that lives And strives, and sinks and strives! Her outraged looks to every heaven addrest! Her pride, grown fierce by fate, Her mien deject and great, Her violated bosom's wild unrest; Behold her—travail-torn— Endured but still unborne Behold what fetters load her queenly breast. Behold the glittering cares Her brow, in mockery, wears, The crowns of thorn and tinsel, tear-empearl'd; Hark the unwonted names That consummate her shames! They dare not call her Rome—no, not down hurl'd And chain'd!—lest at the sound Each Vandal bond they bound Fall from her and confess the empress of the world! Thus with untiring plaint How oft thy fancies paint Each changing mood of her unchanging woe. Before my sadden'd eyes Obedient dolours rise, A thousand subject passions pale and glow! And each new wrong she bears Thou actest in mine ears, And ill complains to ill, and blow resounds to blow! But what shall paint the power Of that disastrous hour, When coarse oppression struck with ruder hand, And, at some worst disgrace, She raised her bleeding face, And saw with folded arms her sons consenting stand? My harp! at that last gaze Her eyes, dishonoured, raise, Thou, with Timanthean woe grown utterless, Changing the unequal key Of slaves that might be free, But rot and smile in unavenged duresse, Thy descant of disdain Loud liftest, till our pain Shows us the shade of her ineffable distress. Then the mists are breaking! Then our hearts are waking! We call her ‘mother’! and she answers! Then The blood that won these plains Boils in our modern veins, Years are unlived! Italia! once again, Where thy proud eagles shine All Roman, and all thine, We rise and—bah! I dream'd that we were men! [Great confusion and outcry; in the midst of which the Monk disappears. SCENE VIII. A Dungeon. The Monk, Vittorio Santo, and a few of his chosen followers (among them ‘The Mother’ of Scene VI.) who are admitted to see him for the last time. They are conversing. His trial, by Austrian Court-martial, takes place at day-break. The Monk. I grant you there must be for every man Some hill, plain, valley, or familiar tree, Beside whose sweetness his young sould beholding, Grew till the invisible within put on The outward beauty. As your Roman mothers Conceiving gazed upon their marble gods, And brought forth sons like them. But if these homesteads Contain that wealth of utterless affections, Hopes, fears, traditions, duties, memories, Inborn respects, instincts of good and evil, That creature faith, that visible religion, Which my soul utters when I say ‘My country,’ Then the best sight makes the best citizen, The horizon of our rights shuts in with age, Each day of weeping leaves us less to weep for, Infirmity makes outlaws, and the blind Are aliens everywhere. A Youth. Belovèd master, For thus—sublime in the near neighbourhood Of death—I must behold thee, even as men On hill-tops seen against the heaven beyond Seem giants—— The Monk. Friend, forbear. Who made me ruler And judge among you—or who gave thee licence To be a slave? Beloved, thou art young: the time May come when thou shalt tremble to create Or to depose a master. In dominion— The universal idol—the world worships The unknown God. Sometimes in these last hours I have had visions of a more divine Iconoclast, who shall demand, ‘Will God Be worshipp'd in the noblest image?’ Let That pass. I feel it has not pass'd for ever. Meanwhile learn this. Drawing near authority To make or to unmake—Man, put thy shoes From off thy feet, for the place where thou standest Is holy ground. A Friend. Who then shall dare rebel? The Monk. Well ask'd, brave patriot, where is that blasphemer Who dares rebel? Let us obey. But, Roman, Shall we obey the living or the dead? ‘The powers that be!’ By what sign will ye know The powers that be? My friends, we are the fools Of eyesight and the earthly habitudes Which cannot look aloft. Walking the plank Of life o'er the abyss, we fear to glance Or upward to the stars, or downward to the grave. Our souls, yoke-strain'd, in attitude of toil Bend earthward. Oft the unworshipp'd angel passeth While we, with eyes fix'd on the ground from which We came, adore his footsteps in the sand. And God, this while, is in the heaven of heavens! Stand! Christian! thou who hastest towards a throne By that old pathway which our fathers wore When a king sat there. Traitor! yon blood-stain'd Mad sans-culotte, whose godless feet are rattling Among kings' bones,—you vulture of the nations, Yelling instinctive through the fateful air To deathstruck dynasties,—yon maniac serf Ringing his broken chains, and piling, wild With freedom, hills of courtly slain to reach The thronèd effigy to which thou kneelest, And strew the imperial tatters to the wind— That outlaw is no rebel! What art thou Who bendest to the empty rags which once Enrobed dominion, and with stiff knee passest That uncrown'd presence, unbegilt, unfeather'd Naked and full of God, whose step disturbs The centre of the world? Friends! Gessler's hat Two centuries hence had more divinity Than any crown to-day. Is aught on earth Eternal? Man has rights; but is a corpse A man? Doth the heir rob the dead? The stars Themselves burn out. Spring, summer, autumn, winter, Each traitor to the past, and each in turn To its own season loyal. Are these things Dumb? Look on high. That which you call rebellion Is but the changed obedience which we pay To changing dispensations. The true rebel Is he who worships for the powers that are Powers that are not. Enter a Jailor secretly disposed to favour the Monk. Jailor. The hour, most reverend Sir, Of which you bade me warn you, struck but now. One more is all the grace I dare. Even that Discover'd, would be bought with all my own. The Monk. Good friend, we thank thee. Did we not know, jailor, That the time cometh when to have done this service To these and me this night shall more avail thee Than an imperial signet, we would speak Of recompence. Yet wear this, [taking a ring from his finger,] and forget not When it was given and why. Enough. We count The moments. Gentle Romans, when ye enter The land of milk and honey, recollect That God spared Rahab. The great day of reckoning Is not so far hence that ye shall forget Vittorio Santo's keeper. A Friend. Show me why It does not dawn to-morrow. 'T may suit well Thy monk's disguise to draw the sword of the Spirit, And wrestle not with flesh and blood, but hath Rome one arm only? How shall he whose tongue Fate hung awry be eloquent? My comrades, Thus! [with a gesture]. In truth, Santo, my right worthy friend, Methinks thou hast even offer'd up thyself And thy good cause on a cold altar—— The Monk. So Did Abel. The Friend. Yes, 'tis well, 'tis very well, Noble no doubt and wondrous heavenly, but—— An elder Friend. Peace, stripling! Friend revered, thou hast wrought out Thy chosen path to freedom. It ends here. The Monk (pointing up). There. I am no such royal guest, dear Cosmo, But I can stand a moment at the gate. Cosmo. We, reverent of thy martyr zeal, but hearing A voice which calls us by a shorter road To be cut out by hands, ask if the sword That patriot draws be guilty? The Monk. When the Baptist Call'd to repentance, did he weigh the dust And measure out the sackcloth? Let a prophet Wait upon silence. Who can hold his peace Hath said his message. Things that once have dwelt In heaven will make that prison, a man's heart, Glad to release them. Let the seer see And he will cry. Herein I have not seen. The image that for me fills earth and heaven Shuts out the shapes beyond. A Woman Yet, father, —oh(‘The Mother’ in Scene VI.) Let me still call thee so!—are there not hard Unripen'd times, when the gold sickle of angels Reaps not the harvest—early dawns of truth, When we must burn a grosser light than day? The Monk. If the true man were of the world, and had The sun of his great orbit in its centre, And kept the measure of its seasons, then, Daughter, thou hadst said well. But he who steps Forth from the radiant chambers of the future To show us how the unseen ages look; He who comes forth a voluntary hostage Of the supreme good-will of times to come; He who grew up among your children's children, And calls by name the years you never knew; He who takes counsel of the things that yet Are not, and answers with his kindling eyes Questions ye cannot hear; he who is set Among us pigmies, with a heavenlier stature And brighter face than ours, that we must leap Even to smite it,—that man, friends, must have The self-existence of a god. From him The poor necessities, hopes, fears, and fashions Of the expedient Present, fall like waves From adamant. Friends! learn a prophet's patience. Do you remember how, in backward years, Night after night the patient harvest-moon Climbs her high seat above the silent fields, In act to reign? Bating no majesty For her great solitude. Unmann'd, below, The golden plenty spreads, unwarn'd of change, Ample repose. From corn-crown'd hill to hill, From waving slope to slope, where sickly winds Disturb'd flit blind from sudden sleep to sleep, From calm auriferous deeps and from the broad Pale distance, drowsy in the genial light, From all the dull expanse of voiceless plains, O'er which, unscared, the midnight curlew cries, No answering horn salutes her. Smile on, pale, Prophetic queen! Know ere thy wane, thine hosts, Thy sounding hosts, shall darken all the vales! Not otherwise the poet and the prophet, The patriot and the sage. The Youth. This is well said. And if we desperate men had calm or leisure To seek the fruit of knowledge where it hangs Through all the fair wide gardens of the soul, Doubtless 'twere reverend idlesse. But, good Sir, A partisan in war time must needs carry His daily meed of duty in his hand. We have no time—we freemen—— The Monk. Ah, young friend, Dost thou too die to-morrow? Gonzalo (a friend). Noble Sir, Forgive him! The Monk. He spake not amiss, Gonzalo, A little out of tune, no more. I thank him. And if I could dismiss you from this last Communion, with no ampler utterance Than yet hath pass'd between us; if I left you Here upon earth, and with the clouds above, To the dim sayings of the sibylline stars, And now, at midnight, gave your tear-blind eyes No compass but the land-marks, which serve angels Journeying heaven and earth, Rezzio's rebuke Flying before would shut against my soul The gates of paradise. I have come short Of my high calling, friends, but (I thank God) Not thus far. The old Castellan, just now, Came not unbidden. I desired, my brethren, To ask of you, this our last mutual hour, A death gift,—if you like it—laid upon My funeral pile. Somewhat I had to say. A Friend (aside). Son. The Son (aside). Father. The Friend (aside). Mine own chaplain—hasten—— The Monk (observing them). Marquis, Are we such strangers? Sirs, ye do me wrong. What chrysm can hold, what hand of flesh can spread The unction of a soul? I bear in me The priesthood of a Christian man, and do My own death-rites. What sins I have, are written On high: and that angelic record needs No death-bed supplement. Son! let us brighten This last best hour with thoughts that shining through To-morrow's tears shall set in our worst cloud The bow of promise. In my life, long past, There is a passage, friends, which set apart From our rich confidence, I have reserved As burden for this hour. Ye are just, brethren, And will believe me that I dig this dust Of personal remembrance as the sands Of golden shores. In giving you the wisdom Which I received, and now commit to your Chaste hands, with prayers ye may be better stewards, I wish, if I may speak thus, to transplant, Not the fruit only, but the tree whereon It grew; that so they may have life in you, Unto a goodlier increase. And for this Awful and mystic husbandry I chose The climate of the grave. And if, dear friends, I stray some moments from my history, Through the sideways of sterile circumstance, Be gracious to the old man garrulous. The old man, friends. Age is the shadow of death, Cast where he standeth in the radiant path Of each man's immortality. What age, To the dumb infant of eternity, Bring threescore years and ten? Brother Gonzalo, Prithee that prison water-jar. My lips Are feverish with to-morrow. [He drinks. Wells the spring Pure even here? Oh nature, nature, thou Hast done thy part! Thanks, gentle friends. Now, soul, I turn thee loose among the fields of old. [He pauses. Imperial Summer in hot luxury Reign'd like a new-crown'd caliph. Heavy Noon, Golden and dead-asleep, oppressive lay, Athwart the sated world. I, book in hand, Wander'd since dawn, it was my wont, those fair Campanian fields where ancient poets went To learn the fragrance of ambrosial air, And every nymph was Hebe—but where now, When the serf makes his lair where Romans dwelt, Nature, disdainful of the hideous trespass, Teaches, retributive, the wasting cheek How slaves should look. From early morn to eve My feet had roam'd these plains, my heart the ages. And burden'd with the brightness of the hour, I sought the shade which old Vespasian built. Those walls which, lest degenerate tongues disturb The indignant dead, we call the Coliseum— Those wondrous walls which, like the monument Of some old city of the plague, stand up Mighty in strength and ruin, with no more Decay than serves for epitaph, and takes Impiety from pride, and breaks the crown'd Pillar of triumph on the conqueror's grave. Those walls whose grey infirmities seem only The mood of an imperishable face, Awful as scars upon a Titan's brow, Dread as a strong man's tears. Small marvel, truly, With that eternal witness looking on, That thou, Campagna! art for very shame True to the days of old! Entering, I sat Refresh'd in shadow, and like some high wizard, In wayward hour, call'd with a god's caprice Spirits of new and old. In that doom-ring Of time, who would not be magician? Now, I sought old chronicles for Nero's house, That golden crown that made mount Palatine Royal. And those imperial halls wherein Cæsar is still august. Now, pensive, sitting Within the very shade of destiny, I saw their ruins strew the hills of Rome. And looking forth through rents, by which the years Pass in and out, I gazed as one should gaze Upon some battle-field of the old gods. And the Olympian slain lay there, unearth'd, With whitening limbs—like bark'd oaks, thunder-scarr'd, Loading the fearful ground, ghastly and gaunt, In all the dreadful attitudes of death. So sojourning—a pilgrim of the past— Kind sleep o'ertook me, travel-worn of soul. My eyes, unconscious, closed to scenes without, And at a shout I opened them within Upon the world of dreams. With strange recoil As at a nod, the extended scroll of time Roll'd up full fifteen ages. That Honorius Who cut the world in two, gave holiday To all the pride of Rome. The new arena, (For in old Rome three hundred years seem'd new,) Which great Vespasian, working for all time, Built up with Jewish hands, (as he would sweat Their immortality into the stone,) Teem'd to the parapet. The sun of noon Shed golden evening through a silken heaven, Fair floating, which for clouds received the incense Of all the Arabies. Luxurious art Ensnared the unwilling winds, and like toil'd eagles, Held them through all the hot Italian day, Flapping cool pleasures. Ever falling-waters Solaced the ear, themselves beheld through fragrance, Till the lapp'd sense in soft confusion own'd Redolent light. Behind a hedge of gold In the elysian field, imperial state Purpled the ring. High, high, and higher rose The babel tower of heap'd up life, and o'er This strange rich arras, rainbow-hued and vast, The eternal marble, imminent, look'd down, And the cyclopean mass of the huge walls Frown'd from the arches. And before their stern And monumental grandeur, the up-piled Mortality was as this hand beside This rock-hewn dungeon. In the midest stand I, On that tremendous theatre condemn'd To play the last red scene of a short life, Lest Cæsar yawn. You heavens! And do the hideous courtesies of war, My senses, quick with fate, learn all the scene, And snuff, prescient, on the heavy air The perfumed death. My foe, a Spartacus In make and weapon, took with careless scorn The languid challenge; and with his flat sword Spurn'd me to action. So have I beheld At the unequal pleasure of the winds, Some poplar giant—tyrant of the plain— Fall foul of some slim cypress. Point to point, And blade to blade, and hilt to hilt opposed, The glittering mazes of the gleaming glaive Coil and recoil. The waxing strife has shrunk The earth to standing-ground. The whole wrapt being Sent hot into the hand, spares not one sense Beyond the sword-arm's circle. Into which Half-understood, the dreadful seas of clamour Thunder their surges. So, meseems, a soul Falling through mid-space hears the passing shout Of unseen worlds. And now the giant, stung, Casts off his sword craft. Striding like a storm, Uproots me, lightening. See my blade fly up Like a flung torch; myself into the dust Hurl'd like a spear; and the Goliath folding His untask'd arms upon his unbreathed breast, Look up without a flush for the well-known Signal of doom. Two hundred thousand hands Gave it. He saw. While the sword rose and fell, Up from the podium to the beetling height I turn'd one dying look to the mute nation Which—stretching neck and nerve with sanguine strain To catch the bloody joy—through all its legions Held such a stifled horrible expectance, As if the greed of anguish could not spare The groan a sigh might cover. Round the vast O'er-peopled hell the terrible haste of death Took my mad eyes, and, in the indistinct Wild glance, its serried thousands glared on me Like one tremendous face. Consenting sat That day, all that the world most loved, fear'd, worshipp'd. Sages whose household words, caught up, made proverbs For far-off nations; grey proconsuls, warriors Whose mere names stood for victory in all The tongues of Europe; senators whose title Ennobled kings; priests of all orders, bishops Whose heavenly treasure was not lent, as yet, To earthly usury; great merchants, men Who dealt in kingdoms; ruddy aruspex, And pale philosopher, who bent beneath The keys of wisdom; artists, and whatever In Rome claimed to be poet; woman, too, And passing fair,—not that mine eye had note Of any separate loveliness, or knew More than a sense of exquisite relief, A more or less in hate, an intuition That in the living mountain which rose round All was not adamant; a milder mood In a most terrible destiny. I saw it, As when upon the fretful parapet Of some vast cloud that doth engird the west, Flush'd and distemper'd with the angry hues Of passionate sunset, oft at eve there shineth A line of purer light. All these sat there Consenting, and with them the purple pride To which all these bow'd down;—and I must die. Swept through the silence a great wind of voices, ‘Look to the podium!’ Breaking from the ranks A Christian priest—I knew him by his habit— Cleaves the gold fences,—lion-proof—with more Than lion's heart, and, as the sword fell, stands 'Twixt me and slaughter. Abdiel with such gesture Held Satan off. The rude barbarian, scorning The feeble game, flings down his sword. That moment Methought hell burst, and in a death-trance heard I The outcry of the damn'd. The observant host Rose like the simultaneous tide when hid Volcanos heave the ocean, and a long Vast wave engulfs an island. Not the war Even of those seas drowning the blasphemies Of shrieking sinking cities, storms the ear Like what I heard. Tremendous rushing life Yell'd round the place, and, as the howling vortex Belch'd up its sounds, the screaming horrors struck The impassive walls, and like caged fiends came back Convulsed with madness. Then the tempest turns Inwards, and with one gust, as at a sign, Guts the stone entrails of the awful tower In whirlwind of revenge. Like an explosion Down hails the hurricane fury. So Vesuvius With mountains wrench'd from her own bowels, piles Shouting the blasted plain. Slain, slain and buried By the same act, under one terrible heap Lay martyr, victor, vanquish'd. Last to die I felt the growing weight and heard through all The exulting thousands. How the sounds dash'd down Like stamping furies. Here the vision ends: With the death-pang I woke. Absolute calm, A silence like the silence of the desert, Silence beyond repose, lone, lifeless, stagnant, Muter than any grave. Silence too dead For living tongue to name. Silence more placid Than peace or night or death; (for these are strings Unstruck but to be stricken;) idiot silence, Sterile, and blank, and blind. A breathless pause In heaven and earth; held till the moving thought Seems turbulence, this human nature grows Unseemly on us, our life's common functions Impertinent and gross, and conscious cheeks Excuse the beating heart with blushes. Silence As of a listening world. Such strange defect, Such lean and hungry quiet, such keen sense Of absence grown effectual, that the ear Faints as for breath, and even the very substance Of latent sound seems dead. Alas! for language, We sing the healing darkness of sweet night, But for Egyptian darkness that was felt Have names no blacker. When you speak of silence, 'Tis as the sweet content of voiceless woods After the nightingale—as the home-genius Sole watching by the sleep of happy babes With finger at her lip, and shows of stillness, Meanwhile the sleeper smileth and the air Stirs with dream-music. When I use the word Think of some other silence. In that other I woke. From sound to stillness as when stormy hearts In passion break. From tempest to dead calm, As when at some strange portent clashing hosts Halt in mid-shock. From all to nothingness, A soul from chaos shot into the void Beyond the universe. In my short rest From imminent heights, the dust of slow decay— Sands from the glass of time shaken of winds— Crumbs from the feast of desolation—strew'd My slumbering face upturn'd. The Gorgon Sleep Made them a shower of stones. My wondering eyes O'er-charged with sense, in shuddering unbelief Unclose upon the lone inane expanse Of summer turf, from which the mouldering walls Shut not the sunshine; like a green still lake Girt by decaying hills. Urging my gaze Round the tremendous circle, arch on arch, And pile on pile, that tired the travell'd eye, I saw the yawning jaws and sightless sockets Gape to the heedless air. Like the death's-head Of buried empire. And the sun shone through them With calm avoidance that left them more dark, And pleasured him with some small daisy's face Grass-grown. As though even from the carrion of gods, The instinct of the living universe Held heaven and earth aloof. All through the lorn Vacuity winds came and went, but stirr'd Only the flowers of yesterday. Upstood The hoar unconscious walls, bisson and bare, Like an old man deaf, blind, and grey, in whom The years of old stand in the sun and murmur Of childhood and the dead. From parapets Where the sky rests, from broken niches—each More than Olympus,—for gods dwelt in them,— Below from senatorial haunts and seats Imperial, where the ever-passing fates Wore out the stone, strange hermit birds croak'd forth Sorrowful sounds, like watchers on the height Crying the hours of ruin. When the clouds Dress'd every myrtle on the walls in mourning With calm prerogative the eternal pile Impassive shone with the unearthly light Of immortality. When conquering suns Triumph'd in jubilant earth, it stood out dark With thoughts of ages: like some mighty captive Upon his deathbed in a Christian land, And lying, through the chant of Psalm and Creed Unshriven and stern, with peace upon his brow, And on his lips strange gods. Rank weeds and grasses, Careless and nodding, grew, and asked no leave, Where Romans trembled. Where the wreck was saddest Sweet pensive herbs, that had been gay elsewhere, With conscious mien of place rose tall and still, And bent with duty. Like some village children Who found a dead king on a battle-field, And with decorous care and reverent pity Composed the lordly ruin, and sat down Grave without tears. At length the giant lay, And everywhere he was begirt with years, And everywhere the torn and mouldering Past Hung with the ivy. For Time, smit with honour Of what he slew, cast his own mantle on him, That none should mock the dead. Oh, Solitude, What dost thou here? Where are those legions? They Were men, not spirits. Where those shouts that like Wild waves upen a low lee shore, but now Lash'd me to death? Thou Earth, where didst thou quake When they went down? Was it that shock, oh Earth, That left these ruins? Crying thus, I ponder'd The subject of my dream. Beside me still Lay that old chronicle whence, as from some Quaint ancient banquet-hall, a gorgeous bevy Of gods and men had pass'd forth with my soul Into sleep's stranger pleasaunce, and thence straying Wander'd the world. The open page, held wide By my stretch'd slumbering arm, interpreted The vision. There my waking eyes had closed. 'Twas where Honorius on a high day gives Games to great Rome; and one unfriended priest, Telemachus by name, soul-stricken, leaps The circus fences, and in mid-arena Stays the unholy combat, and dies there, Stoned by the people. When he walk'd through Rome That morning, no man turned to gaze on him. He had no friend, no mistress, no disciple, No power, fame, fortune, wealth, or human cunning, And hath no record upon earth but this, That he died there. Yet those walls where he suffer'd— Those great imperial monumental walls Built to feast nations in for ever—stand From that day tenantless. In that man's blood Baptized to ruin. Then my heart cried out, Herein, oh prophet, learn a prophet's duty! For this cause is he born, and for this cause, For this cause comes he to the world—to bear Witness. Oh God-ordain'd! thine hands are God's! Sully them not. The days shall come when men Who would be angels shall look back to see What thou wert. Live for them. Speak, speak thy message; The world runs post for thee. The good by nature, The bad by fate;—whom the avenging gods Having condemn'd have first demented. Know By virtue of that madness they are thine. Lay-brothers working where the sanctity Of thine high office comes not. Savage friends Who, scattering in their wrath thy beacon, light The fire that clears the wilderness. Unconscious Disciples, writing up the martyr's title In Hebrew, Greek, and Latin on his cross. Love him who loves thee; his sweet love bath bought A place in heaven. But love him more who hates, For he dares hell to serve thee. Pray for him Who hears thee gladly; it shall be remember'd On high. But, martyr! count thy debt the greater To the reviler; he hath bought thy triumph With his own soul. In all thy toils forget not That whoso sheddeth his life's blood for thee Is a good lover; but thy great apostle, Thy ministering spirit, thy spell-bound World-working giant, thy head hierophant And everlasting high priest, is that sinner Who sheds thine own. A Friend. Alas! Another. 'Tis a hard saying, Who can hear it? SCENE IX. THE TRIAL. An Austrian Court-martial. A number of Officers as Judges. An empty chair for the President, who enters during the proceedings. A subordinate Officer prosecutes. Various Witnesses. A great crowd of Auditors. The Monk stands in the midst with an abstracted air, murmuring to himself. Prosecutor. The court has heard the minstrel, Henri de Jaloux; the most reverend father, Ghiotto Ingordo; and the rustic crowd Brought under guard from Milan. Noble Sirs, Will't please you listen to an aged witness, A simple man, but of a good report, And grey in loyalty. Codardo Goffo, Stand forth! Now worthy Goffo, of what crime Dost thou here charge the prisoner?—— A Judge. Speak, old man! Old Goffo. So please you, I was working in the fields; I serve my lord our bishop—and our bull, Mad with the fly—for, an it please your worships, Since I drove plough, which will be thirty year Come Martinmas, for an it please your worships, My lord the bishop's land—not that I say it For any ill-will to my lord the bishop— But so it is—your worships please to ask Giacchimo,—young Giacchimo—(poor old Giacch, We wore him out.) Your worships, 'tis no use Denying it. But as I say, our bull Curst with the midge—— Prosecutor Speak to the case, old man, You see the prisoner! Old Goffo. Ay, Sir, ay. Our bull, Bit like a loach—— A Judge. Wake up, thou prating loon, Or have thine ears slit! To the case, I say, And leave this babble! Old Goffo. Good, your worships, yes. Where was I, please your worships? Ay. Our bull—— A Judge. Silence! Another Judge. Nay, Colonel, let him on. Well, sirrah! Old Goffo. Our bull, your worship—I am seventy year And more, but let me see the beast, your worship, That throws me, bull or cow, with a fair odds. But, as I say, our Lammas calf—a better Never suck'd dam—'twas eight weeks old that day, Had took the murrain—as it might be here— I made a shift—my poor old back, your worships! And knelt to feed it; when up comes our bull, And down I am. Not that I think, your worships,—— A Judge. Babbling old man, hear me. Answer me shortly What I shall ask thee. Jailor, heat thine irons, And burn his tongue out if he fails. Now, sirrah, What of this man? Old Goffo. Please you, my lord, he came— Not that I ever saw him till that hour— My lord, I am a poor old man, my lords, I am a very poor old man—the bishop—— A Judge. Silence! the prisoner saved you? Is it so? Old Goffo. Please you, my lord, he did, my lord—— A Judge. And you? Old Goffo. My lords, it was the only piece I had— By all the saints!—nay, pray, your worships, mercy, A poor old man! I meant to pay it back— My lord the bishop's steward that same day, Says he, Go buy—— A Judge. Enough! you gave the prisoner A coin—and why? Old Goffo. An offering, please your worships, An old man's life is sweet—I swear, my lords, Only an offering—nay—— Another Judge. Piously done! Speak up, good man! The prisoner took it? Old Goffo. Ah, Sirs, that an honest man who served his bishop Good sixty year—nay, I might say, your worships, Sixty and one: at Martinmas—I mind it Well—I was hired. My mother—rest her soul, She was a mother, sirs,—she says—says she—— A Judge. Jailor, your irons! Old Goffo. Mercy, oh, my lords, I will speak—mercy, oh, my lords—— A Judge. Hear me. Say yes or no. The prisoner kept your coin? Old Goffo. No, please my lord. A Judge. No, sirrah? How? Old Goffo. Nay, mercy! My lords, I will tell all. Judge. Peace, fool, say on. Old Goffo. Please you, he flung it on the ground, and stamp'd it Like any ram—my lords—as I stand here,— And said—— Judge. Ay, tell us what he said. Old Goffo. My lords, I am a very feeble poor old man, I pray your worships mercy—on my knees— My lords—my youngest girl left one small child, For pity's sake, my lords, remember it,— My youngest daughter, please your worships,—she Left him to me—for pity's sake, my lords, My lords, for pity's sake! A Judge. Is there none here Who will interpret this strange witness? Prosecutor. Sir, The poor half-witted dotard fears to be Confounded with his benefactor. I, Marshalling the evidence, heard this from him, That when the prisoner saw the superscription And image of my lord the duke, he spurn'd The money, and declared that masses bought With king-stamp'd price purchased the soul for hell, With sundry other ravings, treating of Rome and Republics. A Judge. I this so? Old Goffo. My lords, 'Tis very true. President (who enters). Eh—eh—why this is treason, Treason—eh—said he so?—honest old man, Speak on—he told thee—eh—yes, yes, he told thee All kinds of things—eh—yes—to slay the bishop, Speak out—fear not—to slay the bishop—eh?—— Old Goffo. My lords, as I shall answer on my soul, He said not so; rather, my lords, he bade—— President. There, get you gone—there, get you gone—— Prosecutor. Call up Signor Pulito Mansueto. Now, Sir, What say you? Mansueto. Sir, I have a son. The son Of my grey widowhood. To whose dear tune I have so play'd my life, in the dim future Of my old heart I own no single hope That has not all his features. What he was To me, a daughter seem'd to my rich neighbour, Worthy Antonio; and wherein my son Fail'd of perfection's stature, it did show Complete in her. Antonio and I, Old Schoolfellows—had mark'd them for each other, Well pleased to make our dynasties shake hands When we might greet no longer. That their love Should have run smoothly in the golden channels Made by the hands that made them, Sir, what father Will doubt? Sirs, where my garden joins the fields Low in the vale, no hedge shuts out the fairies, But Art and Nature, intimately sweet, Exchange their beauties. Fond amidst them runs A brook, that like some babbling child between Two bashful lovers, telling tales to each, Perfects their friendship. Bowering all the way With equal joy, they clothe it, and in love Shut out the very sun. Hither my boy Came oft, at noon, to sing and meditate Antonio's daughter:—his sole confidante An ancient dulcimer, the quaint strange spoil Of some old disinterrèd city. Here, Good Sirs, this traitor met him, and did use— So I learn now—to sing his witchcraft to him, Discoursing much of other mistresses, Freedom and Rome—(the Mussulman): in fine, My son, beguiled, Sirs, by this sorcerer's spell, Slighted Antonio's daughter, and is gone I know not whither. A Judge. Is it likely, friend, The poison wrought no further? Had this knave No monetary service of your son? Had he—— President. Eh—money—eh—old gentleman? What? Did he rob you? Mansueto. On my honour, no. My child, Sir, is no felon. He took nothing But his old lyre. Nay, now you urge my thought, There was an ancient toga which had hung With other Roman relics in my hall, He took that with him. And God bless him with it! Sir, I am not a seer, but methinks Your house is childless. Prosecutor. Call Capo di Matti! Now, Matti, what are you? Matti. My lords, I am, Or was, my lords, of late, house-steward to My lord the marquis. A Judge. And you know this man? President. Eh—eh—you know him? Look the man in the face. Turn about, prisoner! Eh, you dog—— Matti. My lords, He was a frequent guest where I have served, A very turbulent fellow, good my lords, And dangerous to the state. A Judge. And in your business—— President. Eh—yes, your business—eh? your daily business At table, eh? and so forth. You have heard— Speak up, Sir, you have heard? Matti. As this, my lords. His manner was to say with many words, Your worships have no right in Italy, No, not so much as to the ground you stand on. Then 'twas his pleasure to revile crown'd heads; His highness is no duke,—his majesty No emperor or king,—my lord the pope— A Catholic tongue, my lords, may not deliver His awful discourse of my lord the pope! But most, my lords, it was his wont to boast Of some strange secret known to himself only, To sweep your worships from this land, without Gun, sword, or pistol. Which, my lords, I hold To be some compound hot and devilish Of his black art. My lords, I know the time When I have sick'd to hear him. Once, my lords, As I shall answer on my sinful soul, The prisoner promised my late lord, the marquis, To show him all his secret after dinner, I' the garden house. My lords, some said that eve It thunder'd. I knew better. A Judge. This is fearful. Well, Sir,—— Matti. And, please our lordships, at my lord's He wore no cowl—my lords, he is no priest— This gown, my lords, is worn the better to carry His villanous compound. I have heard him say so. A Judge. Heaven and earth! President. What? What? not a priest, and wear Priest's clothes? Why, blasphemy—eh? Blasphemy, Rank blasphemy—put it down so. A Judge. Well, fellow, This shall be thought on. Matti. I do fear to say What more I heard. A Judge. Speak out! Another. Sirrah, thine oath! Matti. Nay then, my lords, nay, to say truth, my lords, A man is none the worse for what he hears— Or you, my lords—— A Judge. Speak to the point! Matti. My lords, Am I held guiltless?—Servants have their duties—— A Judge. Speak out, I say. Matti. My lords, it seems to pass Man's wickedness—but, as I hope to see Heaven and the blessed, this man hath conspired To level every city, small and great, In all this land save one. Sirs, take it down, I swear, my lords, even to the very words A hundred times repeated, till my knees Shook to stand by—‘Rome all, Rome only,’ so He phrased it. I speak true, my lords—— Prosecutor. The Court Shall hear a confirmation. You may go. Stand up, Bugiardo Sporco, serving-man To the aforesaid marquis—— A Voice from the Crowd. But discharged (Let the Court take good note of it) for lying, Theft, and adultery. Prosecutor. Silence! my lord marquis. Now, fellow, have you heard ill of this prisoner? Sporco. Times out of mind, my lord. A Judge. Tell what was wont To be his converse at your master's table. Sporco. First and foremost, to cut all Austrian throats— Pillage all churches—ravish all the women, And hold them afterwards in common; ten To each man. Then he had a plan to roast—— Shouts from the Crowd. Down with the rascal! kill him where he stands. Stones! Stones! Stones! A Judge. Soldiers, save the witness. Another. Charge This rabble. A Friend of the Monk's. Peace, good people. The Crowd. Peace! peace! peace! Prosecutor. Call up—— A Judge. The Court is satisfied. Arraign The prisoner. An Officer. How say'st thou, Vittorio Santo, Sometime, but falsely, self-styled Monk of Jesus, And now on trial. Thou hast had free hearing Of thine accusers. Speak. Guilty ot not? The Monk (musing). ‘It is in vain to rise up early, to sit Up late, to eat the bread of sorrows. So He giveth His beloved rest.’ Officer. Vittorio Santo! self-styled Monk of Jesus, Guilty or not? Answer! The Monk (musing). You, you that cry ‘How long?’ be patient; is not your heaven sweet? Officer. Vittorio Santo—self-styled Monk of Jesus, Guilty or not? The Monk (musing). Brother! it is thy voice; 'Twas well of thee, my brother! to speak now. The home, the plain, the column by the tower, Sickness, thy love, loss, death: the revelation, Resolve, thought, labour, disappointment, triumph, And now the end. Yes, it was well, my brother! A Judge. Shout in his ear. Smite him, ye drowsy guards. What! shall this slave despise us? Corporal, hither! Thou hast a voice, cry out, ‘Vittorio Santo, Guilty or not?’ Corporal (shouts). Santo! Vittorio Santo! Guilty or not? The Monk. I am a Roman. Find me A judge and I refuse not to be tried. Prosecutor. Traitor! thou standest at the judgment-seat Of Wollustling von Bauerhund von Bosen, Baron of Herrschwuth and Scheinheiligkeit, Count d'Omicidio, Marshal in the armies Of that dread sovereign Apostolical Our Liege and thine—the imperial Ferdinand, Emperor of Austria—King—— The Monk. Peace! I have heard His titles. Find me, friend, a judge, and I Refuse not to be tried. The President. A judge! eh? what? A judge—eh—are we not a judge? eh? what? Nay, pull his cowl about his face! There! flout him! Spit at him! Dog! Nay, we will teach thee, cur! A judge forsooth! Pluck the mad priest by the nose; Nay, not a judge? Then hear thy sentence—— The Monk. Spare Thy lips, for I appeal. President. Appeal, appeal, Nay, he appeals, the dog! Appeals! hear that! By Heavens! appeals! Appeal, vile slave? to whom? The Monk. To that which—looking o'er your heads and through These walls, which soon shall be as dust—I see Rise like an awful spirit from the earth. To you, as yet, invisible. To me, Present and filling all things. Strong as fate; Dreadful as heavenly justice; more imperial Than all the builders of the Babylons; Invincible as death; and beautiful As itself only. President. Drag the traitor out! What! Does he threaten us with ghosts? Men rush in shouting. To arms! To arms! Others. The mob! Others. Rebellion! Others. Carbonari! A Judge. Guard the priest! Enter Soldier. Soldier. Captain, twenty thousand men, By my guess—rogues and peasants—— Captain. How far hence Soldier. Three gunshots. Captain. Armed? Soldier. Ordnance, they say! Captain. Who leads? Soldier. A Woman. A Judge. Man the gates! Men (rushing in). The mob! the mob! A Spectator (to the Monk). Be these thy ghosts then? The Monk. Were the troubled waters The angel? Yet how many at Bethesda Saw no more than the trouble! Spectator. Being heal'd, What matter? The Monk. Good friend, much. The heal'd will worship The healer. Men (rushing in). Haste, haste, haste. More. My lords! a woman, My lords! a woman like a prophetess, Hair in the winds, and eyes on fire—— A Judge. We know. Peace! Guards, remove the prisoner! President. Eh—eh—what— Remove—remove—yes, yes, off with him—eh? You lag? You dogs! lend me a bayonet! There, There! by the heels! Drag him out by the heels! A Judge (to the Captain). Tell off two hundred. By the southern gate Lead out your prisoner. Underneath the walls Let him be shot. Face right about, and reach The western heights. Great shouts without. Down with the Austrians! Arms! Blood! Charge! Death—death to tyrants! Victory! Freedom! MISCELLANEOUS POEMS (OF ABOUT THE SAME DATE AS ‘THE ROMAN’). A MUSING ON A VICTORY. (1847.) Down by the Sutlej shore, Where sound the trumpet and the wild tum-tum, At winter's eve did come A gaunt old northern lion, at whose roar The myriad howlers of thy wilds are dumb, Blood-stained Ferozepore! In the rich Indian night, And dreaming of his mate beyond the sea, Toil-worn but grand to sight, He made his lair, in might, Beneath thy dark palm-tree, And thou didst rouse him to the unequal fight— And woe for thee! For some of that wild land Had heard him in the desert where he lay; And soon he snuffs upon their hurtling way, The hunters—bandby band; And up he gat him from the eastern sand And leaped upon his prey. Alas for man! Alas for all thy dreams, Thou great somnambulist, wherein, outlawed From right and thought, thou workest out unawed Thy grand fantastic fancies! Thro' the flood, The pestilence, the whirlwind, the dread plain Of thunders—thro' the earthquake and the storm, The deluge and the snows, the whirling ice Of the wild glacier, every ghastly form Of earth's most vexed vicissitudes of pain,— Thro' worlds of fire and seas of mingled bloods Thou rushest, dreadful as a maniac god; And only finding that thou wert not sane When some great sorrow thunders at thy brain And wakes thee trembling by a precipice. Alas for thee, thou grey-haired man that still Art sleeping, and canst hold thy grandchild high That he may see the gorgeous wrong go by Which slew his father! And for thee, thou bright Inheritress of summer-time and light, Alas for thee, that thy young cheek is flush'd With dreaming of the lion and the foe, Tho' it had been yet paler than the snow Upon the battle-hill, if once had gush'd, But once before thee, even the feeblest flow Of that life's blood that swept in floods below. Alas! that even thy beauty cannot break The vampyre spell of such a war-dream's woe,— Alas! tho' waking might have been to know Things which had made it sweeter not to wake. Alas for man!—poor hunchback—all so proud And yet so conscious; man that stalks divine Because he feels so mortal, speaking loud To drown the trembling whisper in his heart, And wildly hurrying on from crowd to crowd, In hope to shun the faithful shapes that start Wherever lake doth sleep or streamlet shine In silent solitudes. When once in youth Fresh from the spheres, and too severely wise, Truth drew the face he longed yet feared to view, Stung with the instinct that confessed it true He dashed the tablets from her sacred hand; She drops her singing robes and leaves his land; And Fiction, decent in the garb of Truth, While lurking mischief lights her lambent eyes, Seizes the fallen pencil, and with grave Historic features paints the lies we crave. So war became a welcome woe. The grass Grows tear-bedewed upon a lonely grave, And we plant sad flow'rs and sweet epitaphs, And every grief of monumental stone, Above a single woe; but let men sleep In thousands, and we choose their hideous heap For Joy to hold his godless orgies on. Is it that some strange law's unknown behest Makes gladness of the greatest woes we have And leaves us but to sorrow for the less? Even as in outward nature light's excess Is blindness, and intensest motion rest; Or is it not—oh conscious heart declare— That the vast pride of our o'erwrought despair, Seeing the infinite grief, and knowing yet We have no tears to pay such deep distress, Grown wild, repudiates the direful debt, And in its very bankrupt madness laughs?— Yet when this Victory's fame shall pass, as grand And griefless as a rich man's funeral, Thro' nations that look on with spell-bound eye, While echoing plaudits ring from land to land, Alas! will there be none among the good And great and brave and free, to speak of all The pale piled pestilence of flesh and blood, The common cold corruption that doth lie Festering beneath the pall? Alas! when time has deified the thought Of this day's desperate devilry, and men (Who scorn to inherit virtue, but will ape Their sires, and bless them, when they sin) shall shape A graven image of the thought, and then Fall down to worship it—will no one dare, While nations kneel before the idol there, To stand and tell them it is Juggernaut? Alas for man! if this new crime shall yield To truth no harvest for the sighs it cost; If this crowned corpse, this pale ensceptred ghost That stalks, Ferozepore, from thy red field Robed as a king, shall all unchallenged pass Down the proud scene of Time. Alas, alas! If there are some to weep and some to pray, And none to bow their humbled heads and say, Low sighing,—There hath been a mortal strife; And thirteen thousand murdered men lie there, And day and night upon the tainted air Blaspheme the Lord of Life. ISABEL. (1847.) In the most early morn I rise from a damp pillow, tempest-tost, To seek the sun with silent gaze forlorn, And mourn for thee, my lost Isabel. That early hour I meet The daily vigil of my life to keep, Because there are no other lights so sweet, Or shades so long and deep, Isabel. And best I think of thee Beside the duskest shade and brightest sun, Whose mystic lot in life it was to be Outshone, outwept by none, Isabel. Men said that thou wert fair: There is no brightness in the heaven above, There is no balm upon the summer air Like thy warm love, Isabel. Men saw that thou wert bright: There is no wildness in the winds that blow, There is no darkness in the winter's night Like thy dark woe, Isabel. And yet thy path did miss Men's footsteps: in their haunts thou hadst no joy; The thoughts of other worlds were thine in this; In thy sweet piety, and in thy bliss And grief, for life too coy, Isabel. And so my heart's despair Looks for thee ere the firstling smoke hath curled; While the rapt earth is at her morning pray'r, Ere yet she putteth on her workday air And robes her for the world, Isabel. When the sun-burst is o'er, My lonely way about the world I take, Doing and saying much, and feeling more, And all things for thy sake, Isabel. But never once I dare To see thine image till the day be new, And lip hath sullied not the unbreathed air, And waking eyes are few, Isabel. Then that lost form appears Which was a joy to few on earth but me: In the young light I see thy guileless glee, In the deep dews thy tears, Isabel. So with Promethean moan In widowhood renewed I learn to grieve; Blest with one only thought—that I alone Can fade: that thou thro' years shalt still shine on In beauty, as in beauty art thou gone, Thou morn that knew no eve, Isabel. In beauty art thou gone; As some bright meteor gleams across the night, Gazed on by all, but understood by none, And dying by its own excess of light, Isabel. TO A CATHEDRAL TOWER, ON THE EVENING OF THE THIRTY-FIFTH ANNIVERSARY OF WATERLOO. (First Printed in the ‘Athenæum’ of August 3, 1850.) And since thou art no older, 'tis to-day! And I, entranced,—with the wide sense of gods Confronting Time—receive the equal touch Of Past and Present. Yet I am not moved To frenzy; but, with how much calm befits The insufficient passions of a soul Expanding to celestial limits, take Ampler vitality, and fill, serene, The years that are and were. Unchanging Pile! Our schoolboy fathers play in yonder streets, Wherethro' their mothers, new from evening prayer, Speak of the pleasant eve, and say Good Night. Say on! to whom, oh never more shall night Seem good; to whom for the last time hath eve Been pleasant! Look up to the sunset skies As a babe smiles into his murderer's face, Nor see the Fate that flushes all the heaven, Unconscious Mother! Hesper thro' the trees Palpitates light; and thou, beholding peace, Keepest thy vigil and art fond to think His heart is beating for a world of bliss. ‘Oh Sabbath Land!’ Ah Mother, doth thine ear Discern new silence? Dost thou dream what right The earth may have to seem so still to thee? Oh Sabbath Land! but on the Belgian plain The bolt has fallen; and the storm draws off In scattered thunders groaning round the hills And tempest-drops of woe upon the field. The king of men has turned his charger's head Whose hoofs did shake the world, but clatter now Unheeding sod. He turns, and in his track The sorrows of the centuries to come Cry on the air. He rides into the night, Which as a dreadful spirit hails him in With lightnings and with voices. Far behind, In the War-marish, Victory and Glory Fall by each other's hands, like friends of old, Unconquered. And the genius of his race, Pale, leaning on a broken eagle, dies. High in the midst departing Freedom stands On hills of slain; her wings unfurled, her hands Toward heaven, her eyes turned, streaming, on the earth, In act to rise. And all the present Fortunes, Hopes, Oracles, and Omens of the world Sitting alow, as mourners veiled and dumb, Draw, with weird finger, in the battle-slime The signs of Fate. Behold whom War salutes Victor of victors. War, red-hot with toil, Spokesman of Death. Death, pale with sated lust And hoarse with greed. Behold! At his strong call The bloody dust takes life, and obscene shapes Clang on contending wings, wild wheeling round His head exulting. How they hate the light And rout the fevered sunset that looks back Obtesting! How they scream up at the stars And smite in rage the invisible air! How, like A swoop of black thoughts thro' a stormy soul, They rush about the Victor and snatch joys For all the tyrants of the darkened globe. Who shall withstand him? Him the evening star Trembled to see. Our despots, from the first, Bequeathed him each a feature, and he walks The sum of all oppression and the sign. O Earth! O Heaven! O Life! O Death! O Man! Flesh of my flesh, my brother! Is there hope? Soul, soul! behold the portent of the time. High in the Heaven, the angels, much-attent, With conscious faces and averted eyes (As one who feels the wrong he will not see,) Gaze upon God, and neither frown nor smile. Grey Pile, Who lookest with thy kindred hills upon This quiet England, shadow-robed for sleep, I also speak to thee as one whom kin Emboldens. Demigod among the gods, I charge thee by thy human nature speak! Doth she sleep well? Thou who hast watched her face, Tell me, for thou canst tell, doth the flesh creep? Ah! and the soil of Albion stirred that day! Ah! and these fields, at midnight, heaved with graves! The vision ends. Collapsing to a point In Time, I see thee, O red Waterloo, A deadly wound now healed. From whose great scar Upon the brow of Man, the bloody husks Have newly fallen. 'Twas a Felon's blow On one who reeling, drunk with life, above A precipice, fell by the timely steel; Bled, and, deplete, was whole; saw with sane eyes The gulph that yawned; and rises, praising God, To bind the Assassin. CRAZED. (First Printed in the ‘Athenæum’ of November 23, 1850.) ‘The Spring again hath started on the course Wherein she seeketh Summer thro' the Earth. I will arise and go upon my way. It may be that the leaves of Autumn hid His footsteps from me; it may be the snows. ‘He is not dead. There was no funeral; I wore no weeds. He must be in the Earth. Oh where is he, that I may come to him And he may charm the fever of my brain. ‘Oh Spring, I hope that thou wilt be my friend. Thro' the long weary Summer I toiled sore; Having much sorrow of the envious woods And groves that burgeoned round me where I came, And when I would have seen him, shut him in. ‘Also the Honeysuckle and wild bine Being in love did hide him from my sight; The Ash-tree bent above him; vicious weeds Withheld me; Willows in the River-wind Hissed at me, by the twilight, waving wands. ‘Also, for I have told thee, oh dear Spring, Thou knowest after I had sunk outworn In the late summer gloom till Autumn came, I looked up in the light of burning Woods And entered on my wayfare when I saw Gold on the ground and glory in the trees. ‘And all my further journey thou dost know; My toils and outcries as the lusty world Grew thin to winter; and my ceaseless feet In vales and on stark hills, till the first snow Fell, and the large rain of the latter leaves. ‘I hope that thou wilt be my friend, oh Spring, And give me service of thy winds and streams. It needs must be that he will hear thy voice, For thou art much as I was when he woo'd And won me long ago beside the Dee. ‘If he should bend above you, oh ye streams, And anywhere you look up into eyes And think the star of love hath found her mate And know, because of day, they are not stars; Oh streams, they are the eyes of my beloved! Oh murmur as I murmured once of old, And he will stay beside you, oh ye streams, And I shall clasp him when my day is come. ‘Likewise I charge thee, west wind, zephyr wind, If thou shalt hear a voice more sweet than thine About a sunset rosetree deep in June, Sweeter than thine, oh wind, when thou dost leap Into the tree with passion, putting by The maiden leaves that ruffle round their dame, And singest and art silent,—having dropt In pleasure on the bosom of the rose,— Oh wind, it is the voice of my beloved; Wake, wake, and bear me to the voice, oh wind! ‘Moreover, I do think that the spring birds Will be my willing servants. Wheresoe'er There mourns a hen-bird that hath lost her mate Her will I tell my sorrow—weeping hers. ‘And if it be a Lark whereto I speak, She shall be ware of how my Love went up Sole singing to the cloud; and evermore I hear his song, but him I cannot see. ‘And if it be a female Nightingale That pineth in the depth of silent woods, I also will complain to her that night Is still. And of the creeping of the winds And of the sullen trees, and of the lone Dumb Dark. And of the listening of the stars. What have we done, what have we done, oh Night? ‘Therefore, oh Love, the summer trees shall be My watch-towers. Wheresoe'er thou liest bound I will be there. For ere the spring be past I will have preached my dolour through the land, And not a bird but shall have all my woe. —And whatsoever hath my woe hath me. ‘I charge you, oh ye flowers fresh from the dead, Declare if ye have seen him. You pale flowers, Why do you quake and hang the head like me? ‘You pallid flowers, why do ye watch the dust And tremble? Ah, you met him in your caves, And shrank out shuddering on the wintry air. ‘Snowdrops, you need not gaze upon the ground, Fear not. He will not follow ye; for then I should be happy who am doomed to woe. ‘Only I bid ye say that he is there, That I may know my grief is to be borne, And all my Fate is but the common lot.’ She sat down on a bank of Primroses, Swayed to and fro, as in a wind of Thought That moaned about her, murmuring alow, ‘The common lot, oh for the common lot.’ Thus spake she, and behold a gust of grief Smote her. As when at night the dreaming wind Starts up enraged, and shakes the Trees and sleeps. ‘Oh early Rain, oh passion of strong crying, Say, dost thou weep, oh Rain, for him or me? Alas, thou also goest to the Earth And enterest as one brought home by fear. ‘Rude with much woe, with expectation wild, So dashest thou the doors and art not seen. Whose burial did they speak of in the skies? ‘I would that there were any grass-green grave Where I might stand and say, “Here lies my Love;” And sigh, and look down to him, thro' the Earth. And look up, thro' the clearing skies, and smile.' Then the Day passed from bearing up the Heavens, The sky descended on the Mountain tops Unclouded; and the stars embower'd the Night. Darkness did flood the Valley; flooding her. And when the face of her great grief was hid, Her callow heart, that like a nestling bird Clamoured, sank down with plaintive pipe and slow. Her cry was like a strange fowl in the dark: ‘Alas Night,’ said she; then like a faint ghost, As tho' the owl did hoot upon the hills, ‘Alas Night.’ On the murky silence came Her voice like a white sea-mew on the waste Of the dark deep; a-sudden seen and lost Upon the barren expanse of mid-seas Black with the Thunder. ‘Alas Night,’ said she, ‘Alas Night.’ Then the stagnant season lay From hill to hill. But when the waning Moon Rose, she began with hasty step to run The wintry mead; a wounded bird that seeks To hide its head when all the trees are bare. Silent,—for all her strength did bear her dread— Silent, save when with bursting heart she cried, Like one who wrestles in the dark with fiends, ‘Alas Night.’ With a dim wild voice of fear As though she saw her sorrow by the moon. The morning dawns: and earlier than the Lark She murmureth, sadder than the Nightingale. ‘I would I could believe me in that sleep When on our bridal morn I thought him dead, And dreamed and shrieked and woke upon his breast. ‘Oh God, I cannot think that I am blind; I think I see the beauty of the world. Perchance but I am blind, and he is near. ‘Even as I felt his arm before I woke, And clinging to his bosom called on him, And wept, and knew and knew not it was he. ‘I do thank God I think that I am blind. There is a darkness thick about my heart And all I seem to see is as a dream; My lids have closed, and have shut in the world. ‘Oh Love, I pray thee take me by the hand; I stretch my hand, oh Love, and quake with dread; I thrust it, and I know not where. Ah me, What shall not seize the dark hand of the blind? ‘How know I, being blind, I am on Earth? I am in Hell, in Hell, oh Love! I feel There is a burning gulph before my feet! I dare not stir—and at my back the fiends! I wind my arms, my arms that demons scorch, Round this poor breast, and all that thou shouldst save From rapine. Husband, I cry out from Hell; There is a gulph. They seize my flesh.’ (She shrieked.) ‘I will sink down here where I stand. All round How know I but the burning pit doth yawn? Here will I shrink and shrink to no more space Than my feet cover.’ (She wept.) ‘So much up My mortal touch makes honest. Oh my Life, My Lord, my Husband! Fool that cryest in vain! Ah Angel! What hast thou to do with Hell? ‘And yet I do not ask thee, oh my Love, To lead me to thee where thou art in Heaven. Only I would that thou shouldst be my star, And whatsoever Fate thy beams dispense I am content. It shall be good to me. ‘But tho' I may not see thee, oh my Love, Yea, though mine eyes return and miss thee still, And thou shouldst take another shape than thine, Have pity on my lot, and lead me hence Where I may think of thee. To the old fields And wonted valleys where we once were blest. Oh Love, all day I hear them, out of sight, The far Home where the Past abideth yet Beside the stream that prates of other days. ‘My Punishment is more than I can bear. My sorrow groweth big unto my time. Oh Love, I would that I were mad. Oh Love, I do not ask that thou shouldst change my Fate, I will endure; but oh my Life, my Lord, Being as thou art a thronèd saint in Heaven, If thou wouldst touch me and enchant my sense, And daze the anguish of my heart with dreams. And change the stop of grief; and turn my soul A little devious from the daily march Of Reason, and the path of conscious woe And all the truth of Life! Better, oh Love, In fond delusion to be twice betrayed, Than know so well and bitterly as I. Let me be mad.’ (She wept upon her knees.) ‘I will arise and seek thee. This is Heaven. I sat upon a cloud. It bore me in. It is not so, you Heavens! I am not dead. Alas! there have been pangs as strong as Death. It would be sweet to know that I am dead. ‘Even now I feel I am not of this world, Which sayeth, day and night, “For all but thee,” And poureth its abundance night and day And will not feed the hunger in my heart. ‘I tread upon a dream, myself a dream, I cannot write my Being on the world, The moss grows unrespective where I tread. ‘I cannot lift mine eyes to the sunshine, Night is not for my slumber. Not for me Sink down the dark inexorable hours. ‘I would not keep or change the weary day; I have no pleasure in the needless night, And toss and wail that other lids may sleep. ‘I am a very Leper in the Earth. Her functions cast me out; her golden wheels That harmless roll about unconscious Babes Do crush me. My place knoweth me no more. ‘I think that I have died, oh you sweet Heavens. I did not see the closing of the eyes. Perchance there is one death for all of us Whereof we cannot see the eyelids close. ‘Dear Love, I do beseech thee answer me. Dear Love, I think men's eyes behold me not. The air is heavy on these lips that strain To cry; I do not warm the thing I touch; The Lake gives back no image unto me. ‘I see the Heavens as one who wakes at noon From a deep sleep. Now shall we meet again! The Country of the blest is hid from me Like Morn behind the Hills. The Angel smiles. I breathe thy name. He hurleth me from Heaven. ‘Now of a truth I know thou art on Earth. Break, break the chains that hold me back from thee. I see the race of mortal men pass by; The great wind of their going waves my hair; I stretch my hands, I lay my cheek to them, In love; they stir the down upon my cheek; I cannot touch them, and they know not me. ‘Oh God! I ask to live the saddest life! I care not for it if I may but live! I would not be among the dead, oh God! I am not dead! oh God, I will not die!’ So throbbed the trouble of this crazed heart. So on the broken mirror of her mind In bright disorder shone the shatter'd World. So, out of tune, in sympathetic chords, Her soul is musical to brooks and birds, Winds, seasons, sunshine, flowers, and maundering trees. Hear gently all the tale of her distress. The heart that loved her loves not now yet lives. What the eye sees and the ear hears—the hand That wooing led her thro' the rosy paths Of girlhood, and the lenten lanes of Love, The brow whereon she trembled her first kiss, The lips that had sole privilege of hers, The eyes wherein she saw the Universe, The bosom where she slept the sleep of joy, The voice that made it sacred to her sleep With lustral vows; that which doth walk the World Man among Men, is near her now. But He Who wandered with her thro' the ways of Youth, Who won the tender freedom of the lip, Who took her to the bosom dedicate And chaste with vows, who in the perfect whole Of gracious Manhood was the god that stood In her young Heaven, round whom the subject stars Circled: in whose dear train, where'er he passed Thronged charmèd powers; at whose advancing feet Upspringing happy seasons and sweet times Made fond court carolling; who but moved to stir All things submissive, which did magnify And wane as ever with his changing will She changed the centre of her infinite; He In whom she worshipped Truth, and did obey Goodness; in whose sufficient love she felt, Fond Dreamer! the eternal smile of all Angels and men; round whom, upon his neck, Her thoughts did hang; whom lacking they fell down Distract to the earth; He whom she loved, and who Loved her of old,—in the long days before Chaos, the empyrean days!—(Poor heart, She phrased it so) is no more: and O God! Thorough all Time, and that transfigured Time We call Eternity, will be no more. THE SNOWDROP IN THE SNOW. (First printed in the Athenæum of March 1st, 1851.) O full of Faith! The Earth is rock,—the Heaven The dome of a great palace all of ice, Russ-built. Dull light distils through frozen skies Thickened and gross. Cold Fancy droops her wing, And cannot range. In winding-sheets of snow Lies every thought of any pleasant thing. I have forgotten the green earth; my soul Deflowered, and lost to every summer hope, Sad sitteth on an iceberg at the Pole; My heart assumes the landscape of mine eyes Moveless and white, chill blanched with hoarest rime; The Sun himself is heavy and lacks cheer Or on the eastern hill or western slope; The world without seems far and long ago; To silent woods stark famished winds have driven The last lean robin—gibbering winds of fear! Thou only darest to believe in spring, Thou only smilest, Lady of the Time! Even as the stars come up out of the sea Thou risest from the Earth. How is it down In the dark depths? Should I delve there, O Flower, For beauty? Shall I find the summer there Met manifold, as in an ark of peace? And Thou, a lone white Dove, art thou sent forth Upon the winter deluge? It shall cease, But not for thee—pierced by the ruthless North And spent with the Evangel. In what hour The flood abates thou wilt have closed thy wings For ever. When the happy living things Of the old world come forth upon the new I know my heart shall miss thee; and the dew Of summer twilights shall shed tears for me —Tears liker thee, ah, purest! than mine own— Upon thy vestal grave, O vainly fair! Thou should'st have noble destiny, who, like A Prophet, art shut out from kind and kin: Who on the winter silence comest in A still small voice. Pale Hermit of the Year, Flower of the Wilderness! oh, not for thee The jocund playmates of the maiden spring. For when she danceth forth with cymballed feet, Waking a-sudden with great welcoming, Each calling each, they burst from hill to dell In answering music. But thou art a bell, A passing bell, snow-muffled, dim and sweet. As is the Poet to his fellow-men, So mid thy drifting snows, O Snowdrop, Thou. Gifted, in sooth, beyond them, but no less A snowdrop. And thou shalt complete his lot And bloom as fair as now when they are not. Thou art the wonder of the seasons, O First-born of Beauty. As the Angel near Gazed on that first of living things which, when The blast that ruled since Chaos o'er the sere Leaves of primeval Palms did sweep the plain, Clung to the new-made sod and would not drive, So gaze I upon thee amid the reign Of Winter. And because thou livest, I live. And art thou happy in thy loneliness? Oh couldst thou hear the shouting of the floods, Oh couldst thou know the stir among the trees When—as the herald-voice of breeze on breeze Proclaims the marriage pageant of the Spring Advancing from the South—each hurries on His wedding-garment, and the love-chimes ring Thro' nuptial valleys! No, serene and lone, I will not flush thy cheek with joys like these. Songs for the rosy morning; at grey prime To hang the head and pray. Thou doest well. I will not tell thee of the bridal train. No; let thy Moonlight die before their day A Nun among the Maidens, thou and they. Each hath some fond sweet office that doth strike One of our trembling heartstrings musical. Is not the hawthorn for the Queen of May? And cuckoo-flowers for whom the cuckoo's voice Hails, like an answering sister, to the woods? Is not the maiden blushing in the rose? Shall not the babe and buttercup rejoice, Twins in one meadow! Are not violets all By name or nature for the breast of Dames? For them the primrose, pale as star of prime, For them the wind-flower, trembling to a sigh, For them the dew stands in the eyes of day That blink in April on the daisied lea? Like them they flourish and like them they fade, And live beloved and loving. But for thee— For such a bevy how art thou arrayed, Flower of the Tempests? What hast thou with them? Thou shalt be pearl unto a diadem Which the Heavens jewel. They shall deck the brows Of joy and wither there. But thou shalt be A Martyr's garland. Thou who, undismayed, To thy spring dreams art true amid the snows As he to better dreams amid the flames. THE HARPS OF HEAVEN. On a solemn day I clomb the shining bulwark of the skies: Not by the beaten way, But climbing by a prayer, That like a golden thread hung by the giddy stair Fleck'd on the immemorial blue, By the strong step-stroke of the brave and few, Who, stirr'd by echoes of far harmonies, Must either lay them down and die of love, Or dare Those empyrean walls that mock their starward eyes. But midway in the dread emprize The faint and fainter footsteps cease; And, all my footing gone, Like one who gathers samphire, I hold on, And in the swaying air look up and down: And up and down through answering vasts descry Nor Earth nor Heaven; Above, The sheer eternal precipice; below, The sheer eternal precipice. Then when I, Gigantic with my desperate agony, Felt even The knotted grasp of bodily despair Relaxing to let go, A mighty music, like a wind of light, Blew from the imminent height, And caught me in its splendour; and, as flame That flickers and again aspires, Rose in a moment thither whence it came; And I, that thought me lost, Pass'd to the top of all my dear desires, And stood among the everlasting host. Then turn'd I to a seraph whose swift hands, That lived angelic passion, struck his soul Upon a harp—a seraph fair and strong, And faultless for his harp and for his throne, And yet, among The Strength and Beauty of the heavenly bands, No more to be remember'd than some one Poor warrior, when a king of many kings Stamps on the fields, and rears his glittering crop Of standing steel, and the vex'd spirit wings Above the human harvest, and in vain Begins from morn till eve to sum the embattled plain; Or when, After a day of peace, sudden and late The beacon flashes and the war-drums roll, And through the torches of the city gate, All the long winter night a martial race Streams to the nation's gathering-place, And, like as water-drop to water-drop, Pour on in changeless flood the innumerable men. I turn'd, and as from footing in mid-seas Looking o'er lessening waves thou may'st behold The round horizon of unshadow'd gold, I, standing on an amethyst, look'd round The moving Heaven of Harpers throned and crown'd, And said, ‘Was it from these I heard the great sound?’ And he said, ‘What sound?’ Then I grown bolder, seeing I had thriven To win reply—‘This that I hear from thee, This that everywhere I hear, Rolling a sea of choristry Up and down the jewel of Heaven; A sea which from thy seat of light, That seems more loud and bright Because more near, To the white twinkle of yon furthest portal, Swells up those circling shores of chrysolite, And, like an odorous luminous mist, doth leap the eternal walls, And falls In wreaths of melody Adown the azure mountain of the sky; And round its lower slopes bedew'd Breathes lost beatitude; And far away, Low, low, below the last of all its lucent scarps, Sprinkles bewildering drops of immortality. O angel fair, thou know'st what I would say— This sound of harpers that I hear, This sound of harpers harping on their harps.’ Then he bent his head And shed a tear And said, ‘I perceive thou art a mortal.’ Then I to him—‘Not only, O thou bright Seraphic Pity! to a mortal ear These sacred sounds are dear, Or why withholdest not thy ceaseless hand? And why, Far as my dazzled eye Can pierce the lustre of the radiant land, See I the rapt celestial auditory, Each, while he blessed hears, gives back his bliss With never-tiring touch from golden harps like this?’ Then he to me—‘Oh, wherefore hast thou trod Beyond the limit of thine earthly lot? These that we bear Within our hands are instruments of glory, Wherewith, day without night, We make the glory of immortal light In the eyes of God. As for the sound, we hear it not; Yet, speaking to thee, child of ignorance, I do remember that I loved it once, In the sweet lower air.’ Yet he spake once more,— ‘But thou return to the remember'd shore; Why shouldst thou leave thy nation, Thy city, and the house of all most dear? Do we not all dwell in eternity? For we have been as thou, and thou Shalt be as we.’ And he lean'd and kissèd me, Saying, ‘But now Rejoice, O child, in other joys than mine Hear the dear music of thy mortal ear While yet it is the time with thee, Nor make haste to thine exaltation, Though our state be better than thine.’ SONNETS ON THE WAR. (THE CRIMEAN STRUGGLE) (THESE SONNETS WERE FIRST PUBLISHED IN 1855.) L'AVENIR. I saw the human millions as the sand Unruffled on the starlit wilderness. The day was near, and every star grew less In universal dawn. Then woke a band Of wheeling winds, and made a mighty stress Of morning weather; and still wilder went O'er shifting plains, till, in their last excess, A whirlwind whirled across the whirling land. Heaven blackened over it; a voice of woes Foreran it; the great noise of clanging foes Hurtled behind; beneath the earth was rent, And howling Death, like an uncaverned beast, Leaped from his lair. Meanwhile morn oped the East, And thro' the dusty tumult God arose. THE ARMY SURGEON. Over that breathing waste of friends and foes, The wounded and the dying, hour by hour,— In will a thousand, yet but one in power,— He labours thro' the red and groaning day. The fearful moorland where the myriads lay Moved as a moving field of mangled worms. And as a raw brood, orphaned in the storms, Thrust up their heads if the wind bend a spray Above them, but when the bare branch performs No sweet parental office, sink away With hopeless chirp of woe, so as he goes Around his feet in clamorous agony They rise and fall; and all the seething plain Bubbles a cauldron vast of many-coloured pain. THE WOUNDED. ‘Thou canst not wish to live,’ the surgeon said. He clutched him, as a soul thrust forth from bliss Clings to the ledge of Heaven! ‘Would'st thou keep this Poor branchless trunk?’ ‘But she would lean my head Upon her breast; oh, let me live!’ ‘Be wise.’ ‘I could be very happy; both these eyes Are left me; I should see her; she would kiss My forehead: only let me live.’—He dies Even in the passionate prayer. ‘Good Doctor, say If thou canst give more than another day Of life?’ ‘I think there may be hope.’ ‘Pass on. I will not buy it with some widow's son!’ ‘Help,’ ‘help,’ ‘help,’ ‘help!’ ‘God curse thee!’ ‘Doctor, stay, Yon Frenchman went down earlier in the day.’ THE WOUNDED. ‘See to my brother, Doctor; I have lain All day against his heart; it is warm there; This stiffness is a trance; he lives! I swear,— I swear he lives!’ ‘Good Doctor, tell my ain Auld Mother’—but his pale lips moved in vain. ‘Doctor, when you were little Master John, I left the old place; you will see it again. Tell my poor Father,—turn down the wood-lane Beyond the home-field—cross the stepping stone To the white cottage, with the garden gate— O God!’—he died. ‘Doctor, when I am gone Send this to England.’ ‘Doctor, look upon A countryman!’ ‘Devant mon Chef? Ma foi!’ ‘Oui, il est blessé beaucoup plus que moi.’ VOX POPULI. What if the Turk be foul or fair? Is't known That the sublime Samaritan of old Withheld his hand till the bruised wretch had told His creed? Your neighbour's roof is but a shed, Yet if he burns shall not the flame enfold Your palace? Saving his, you save your own. Oh ye who fall that Liberty may stand, The light of coming ages shines before Upon your graves! Oh ye immortal band, Whether ye wrestled with this Satan o'er A dead dog, or the very living head Of Freedom, every precious drop ye bled Is holy. 'Tis not for his broken door That the stern goodman shoots the burglar dead. CZAR NICHOLAS. We could not turn from that colossal foe, The morning shadow of whose hideous head Darkened the furthest West, and who did throw His evening shade on Ind. The polar bow Behind him flamed and paled, and through the red Uncertain dark his vasty shape did grow Upon the sleepless nations. Lay him low! Aye, low as for our priceless English dead We lie and groan to-day in England! Oh, My God! I think Thou hast not finished This Thy fair world, where, triumph Ill or Good, We still must weep; where or to lose or gain Is woe; where Pain is medicined by Pain, And Blood can only be washed out by Blood. CAVALRY CHARGE AT BALACLAVA. Traveller on foreign ground, whoe'er thou art, Tell the great tidings! They went down that day A Legion, and came back from victory Two hundred men and Glory! On the mart Is this ‘to losc?’ Yet, Stranger, thou shalt say These were our common Britons. 'Tis our way In England. Aye, ye heavens! I saw them part The Death-Sea as an English dog leaps o'er The rocks into the ocean. He goes in Thick as a lion, and he comes out thin As a starved wolf; but lo! he brings to shore A life above his own, which when his heart Bursts with that final effort, from the stones Springs up and builds a temple o'er his bones. HOME, IN WAR-TIME. She turned the fair page with her fairer hand— More fair and frail than it was wont to be— O'er each remembered thing he loved to see She lingered, and as with a fairy's wand Enchanted it to order. Oft she fanned New motes into the sun; and as a bee Sings thro' a brake of bells, so murmured she, And so her patient love did understand The reliquary room. Upon the sill She fed his favourite bird. ‘Ah, Robin, sing! He loves thee.’ Then she touches a sweet string Of soft recall, and towards the Eastern hill Smiles all her soul—for him who cannot hear The raven croaking at his carrion ear. WARNING. Virtue is Virtue, writ in ink or blood. And Duty, Honour, Valour, are the same Whether they cheer the thundering steps of Fame Up echoing hills of Alma, or, more blest, Walk with her in that band where she is least Thro' smiling plains and cities doing good. Yet, oh to sing them in their happier day! Yon glebe is not the hind whose manhood mends Its rudeness, yet it gains but while he spends, And mulcts him rude. Even that sinless Lord Whose feet wan Mary washed, went not His way Uncoloured by the Galilean field; And Honour, Duty, Valour, seldom wield With stainless hand the immedicable sword. AMERICA. Men say, Columbia, we shall hear thy guns. But in what tongue shall be thy battle-cry? Not that our sires did love in years gone by, When all the Pilgrim Fathers were little sons In merrie homes of Englaunde? Back, and see Thy satchelled ancestor! Behold, he runs To mine, and, clasped, they tread the equal lea To the same village-school, where side by side They spell ‘our Father.’ Hard by, the twin-pride Of that grey hall whose ancient oriel gleams Thro' yon baronial pines, with looks of light Our sister-mothers sit beneath one tree. Meanwhile our Shakspeare wanders past and dreams His Helena and Hermia. Shall we fight? AMERICA. Nor force nor fraud shall sunder us! Oh ye Who north or south, on east or western land, Native to noble sounds, say truth for truth, Freedom for freedom, love for love, and God For God; Oh ye who in eternal youth Speak with a living and creative flood This universal English, and do stand Its breathing book; live worthy of that grand Heroic utterance—parted, yet a whole, Far, yet unsevered,—children brave and free Of the great Mother-tongue, and ye shall be Lords of an Empire wide as Shakspeare's soul, Sublime as Milton's immemorial theme, And rich as Chaucer's speech, and fair as Spencer's dream. A STATESMAN. Captain be he, my England, who doth know Not careful coasts, with inland welcomes warm; But who, with heart infallible, can go Straight to the gulf-streams of the World, where blow The inevitable Winds. Let cockles swarm The sounded shores. He helms Thee, England! who, Faced by the very Spirit of the Storm, Full at the phantom drives his dauntless prow! And tho' the Vision rend in racks of blood, And drip in thunder from his reeling spars, The compass in his hand, beholds the flood Beneath, o'er-head the everlasting stars Dim thro' the gory ghost; and calm in these, Thro' that tremendous dream sails on to happier seas. POLAND. ITALY. HUNGARY. In the great Darkness of the Passion, graves Were oped, and many Saints which slept arose. So in this latter Darkness, which doth close Upon our noon. That Peace Divine which saves And blesses, and from the celestial waves Of whose now-parted garment our worst woes Did touch a healing virtue, by our foes Is crucified. The inextricable slaves Have slain what should have set them free. Behold The vail is rent! Earth yawns; the rocks are hurled In twain; and Kingdoms long since low and cold, Each with his dead forgotten brow enfurled In that proud flag he fell upon of old, Come forth into the City of the World. JERUSALEM. If God so raise the Dead, shall He pass by The Captive and the immemorable chain? Fud(ce)a capta!—taken but not slain— And cursèd not to die—ah, not to die? Then come out of thine ages, thou art free! Live but one Greek in old Thermopylæ, And Greece is saved! Dark stands the Northern Fate At Europe's open door; upon her nod To pass that breach a hundred nations wait. What! shall we meet her with the bayonet? As the West sets the Sun 'twixt sea and sky In that Great Gate, Immortal! let us set Thy doom; quit Destiny with Destiny, Meet Fate by Fate, and fill the gap with God. AUSTRIAN ALLIANCE. Doth this hand live? Trust not a royal coat, My country! Smite that cheek; there is no stain But of the clay! no flush of shame or pain. This is the smell o' the grave. Lift the gold crown And see that brow. Lo! how the dews drip down The empty house! The worm is on the walls, And the half-shuttered lights are dull and dead With dusty desecration. The soul fled On a spring-day within thy palace-halls, Hapsburg! and all the days of all the springs Of all the ages bring it not again! Vampyre! we wrench thee from the breathing throat Of living Man, and he leaps up and flings Thy rotten carcase at the heads of Kings. CHILDLESS. The Son thou sentest forth is now a Thought— A Dream. To all but thee he is as nought As if he had gone back into the same Bosom that bare him. Oh, thou grey pale Dame, With eyes so wan and wide, what! knowest thou where Thy Dream is such a thing as doth up-bear The earth out of its wormy place? I' the air Dost see the very fashion of the stone That hath his face for clay? Deep, deep, hast found The texture of that single weight of ground Which to each mole and mark that thou hast known Is special burden? Nay, her face is mild And sweet. In Heaven the evening star is fair, And there the mother looketh for her child. THE COMMON GRAVE. Last night beneath the foreign stars I stood And saw the thoughts of those at home go by To the great grave upon the hill of blood. Upon the darkness they went visibly, Each in the vesture of its own distress. Among them there came One, frail as a sigh, And like a creature of the wilderness Dug with her bleeding hands. She neither cried Nor wept; nor did she see the many stark And dead that lay unburied at her side. All night she toiled, and at that time of dawn, When Day and Night do change their More and Less, And Day is More, I saw the melting Dark Stir to the last, and knew she laboured on. ESSE ET POSSE. The groan of fallen Hosts; a torrid glare Of cities; battle-cries of Right and Wrong Where armies shout to rocking fleets that roar On thundering oceans to the thundering shore, And high o'er all—long, long prolonged, along The moaning caverns of the plaining air,— The cry of conscious Fate. The firmament Waves from above me like a tattered flag; And as a soldier in his lowly tent Looks up when a shot strikes the helpless rag From o'er him, and beholds the canopy Of Heaven, so, sudden to my startled eye, The Heavens that shall be! The dream fades. I stand Among the mourners of a mourning land. GOOD-NIGHT IN WAR-TIME. (To Alexander Smith.) The stars we saw arise are high above, And yet our Evensong seems sung too soon. Good-Night! I lay my hand—with such a love As thou wert brother of my blood—upon Thy shoulder, and methinks beneath the moon Those sisters, Anglia and Caledon, Lean towards each other. Aye, for Man is one; We are a host ruled by one trumpet-call, Where each, armed in his sort, makes as he may The general motion. The well-tuned array We see; yet to what victory in what wars We see not; but like the revolving stars Move on ourselves. The total march of all Or men or stars God knows. Lord, lead us on! ENGLAND IN TIME OF WAR. (THESE LYRICS WERE FIRST PRINTED IN 1856.) DESOLATE. From the sad eaves the drip-drop of the rain! The water washing at the latchel door; A slow step plashing by upon the moor; A single bleat far from the famished fold; The clicking of an embered hearth and cold; The rainy Robin tic-tac at the pane. ‘So as it is with thee Is it with me, So as it is and it used not to be, With thee used not to be, Nor me.’ So singeth Robin on the willow tree, The rainy robin tic-tac at the pane. Here in this breast all day The fire is dim and low, Within I care not to stay, Without I care not to go. A sadness ever sings Of unforgotten things, And the bird of love is patting at the pane; But the wintry water deepens at the door, And a step is plashing by upon the moor Into the dark upon the darkening moor, And alas, alas, the drip-drop of the rain! THE MARKET-WIFE'S SONG. In several of the Scottish songs of this volume, the author wishes, notwithstanding whatever couleur locale they may possess, to be understood as speaking rather for a class than a locality. As most of the English provincial dialects are poetically objectionable, and are modifications of tongues which exist more purely in the ‘Lallans’ of Scotland, it seemed to him that when expressing the general peasant life of the empire he might employ the central truth of that noble Doric which is at once rustic and dignified, heroic and vernacular. The butter an' the cheese weel stowit they be, I sit on the hen-coop the eggs on my knee, The lang kail jigs as we jog owre the rigs, The gray mare's tail it wags wi' the kail, The warm simmer sky is blue aboon a', An' whiddie, whuddie, whaddie, gang the auld wheels twa. I sit on the coop, I look straight before, But my heart it is awa' the braid ocean owre, I see the bluidy fiel' where my ain bonny chiel', My wee bairn o' a', gaed to fight or to fa', An' whiddie, whuddie, whaddie, gang the auld wheels twa. I see the gran' toun o' the big forrin' loun, I hear the cannon soun', I see the reek aboon; It may be lang John lettin' aff his gun, It may be the mist—your mither disna wist— It may be the kirk, it may be the ha', An' whiddie, whuddie, whaddie, gang the auld wheels twa. An' I ken the Black Sea, ayont the rock o' dool, Like a muckle blot o' ink in a buik fra' the schule, An' Jock! it gars me min' o' your buikies lang syne, An' mindin' o' it a' the tears begin to fa', An' whiddie, whuddie, whaddie, gang the old wheels twa. Then a bull roars fra' the scaur, ilka rock's a bull agen, An' I hear the trump o' war, an' the carse is fu' o' men, Up an' doun the morn I ken the bugle horn, Ilka birdie sma' is a fleein' cannon ba', An' whiddie, whuddie, whaddie, gang the auld wheels twa. Guid Heavens! the Russian host! We maun e'en gie up for lost! Gin ye gain the battle hae ye countit a' the cost? Ye may win a gran' name, but wad wee Jock come hame? Dinna fecht, dinna fecht! there's room for us a', An' whiddie, whuddie, whaddie, gang the auld wheels twa. In vain, in vain, in vain! They are marchin' near and far! Wi' swords an' wi' slings an' wi' instruments o' war! Oh, day sae dark an' sair! ilka man seven feet an' mair! I bow my head an' say, ‘Gin the Lord wad smite them a'!’ An' whiddie, whuddie, whaddie, gang the auld wheels twa. Then forth fra' their ban' there steps an armed man, His tairge at his breast an' his claymore in his han', His gowd pow glitters fine an' his shadow fa's behin', I think o' great Goliath as he stan's before them a', An' whiddie, whuddie, whaddie, gang the auld wheels twa. To meet the Philistine leaps a laddie fra' our line, Oh, my heart! oh, my heart! 'tis that wee lad o' mine! I start to my legs—an' doun fa' the eggs— The cocks an' hens a' they cackle an' they ca', An' whiddie, whuddie, whaddie, gang the auld wheels twa. Oh, Jock, my Hielan' lad—oh, Jock, my Hielan' lad, Never till I saw thee that moment was I glad! Aye sooner sud thou dee before thy mither's ee' Than a man o' the clan sud hae stept out but thee! An' sae I cry to God—while the hens cackle a', An' whiddie. whuddie, whaddie, gang the auld wheels twa. THE LITTLE GIRL'S SONG. Do not mind my crying, Papa, I am not crying for pain. Do not mind my shaking, Papa, I am not shaking with fear; Tho' the wild wild wind is bideous to hear, And I see the snow and the rain. When will you come back again, Papa, Papa? Somebody else that you love, Papa, Somebody else that you dearly love Is weary, like me, because you're away. Sometimes I see her lips tremble and move, And I seem to know what they're going to say; And every day, and all the long day, I long to cry, ‘Oh Mamma, Mamma, When will Papa come back again?’ But before I can say it I see the pain Creeping up on her white white cheek, As the sweet sad sunshine creeps up the white wall, And then I am sorry, and fear to speak; And slowly the pain goes out of her cheek, As the sad sweet sunshine goes from the wall. Oh, I wish I were grown up wise and tall, That I might throw my arms round her neck And say, ‘Dear Mamma, oh, what is it all That I see and see and do not see In your white white face all the livelong day?’ But she hides her grief from a child like me. When will you come back again, Papa, Papa? Where were you going, Papa, Papa? All this long while have you been on the sea? When she looks as if she saw far away, Is she thinking of you, and what does she see? Are the white sails blowing, And the blue men rowing, And are you standing on the high deck Where we saw you stand till the ship grew gray, And we watched and watched till the ship was a speck, And the dark came first to you, far away? I wish I could see what she can see, But she hides her grief from a child like me. When will you come back again, Papa, Papa? Don't you remember, Papa, Papa, How we used to sit by the fire, all three, And she told me tales while I sat on her knee, And heard the winter winds roar down the street, And knock like men at the window pane, And the louder they roared, oh, it seemed more sweet To be warm and warm as we used to be, Sitting at night by the fire, all three? When will you come back again, Papa, Papa? Papa, I like to sit by the fire; Why does she sit far away in the cold? If I had but somebody wise and old, That every day I might cry and say, ‘Is she changed, do you think, or do I forget? Was she always as white as she is to-day? Did she never carry her head up higher?’ Papa, Papa, if I could but know! Do you think her voice was always so low? Did I always see what I seem to see When I wake up at night and her pillow is wet? You used to say her hair it was gold— It looks like silver to me. But still she tells the same tale that she told, She sings the same songs when I sit on her knee, And the house goes on as it went long ago, When we lived together, all three. Sometimes my heart seems to sink, Papa, And I feel as if I could be happy no more. Is she changed, do you think, Papa, Or did I dream she was brighter before? She makes me remember my snowdrop, Papa, That I forgot in thinking of you, The sweetest snowdrop that ever I knew! But I put it out of the sun and the rain: It was green and white when I put it away, It had one sweet bell and green leaves four; It was green and white when I found it that day, It had one pale bell and green leaves four, But I was not glad of it any more. Was it changed, do you think, Papa, Or did I dream it was brighter before? Do not mind my crying, Papa, I am not crying for pain. Do not mind my shaking, Papa, I am not shaking for fear; Tho' the wild wild wind is hideous to hear, And I see the snow and the rain. When will you come back again, Papa, Papa? ‘HE IS SAFE.’ ‘And it shall come to pass at eventide There shall be light.’ Lord, it hath come to pass. As one day to the world so now to me Thine advent. My dark eve is white as noon; My year so sour and green is gold and red; Mine eyes have seen Thy Goodness. All is done. All things bespeak an end. I am come near The crown o' this steep earth. My feet still stand Cold in the western shadow, but my brow Lives in the living light. The toil is o'er, Surely ‘He giveth His beloved Rest.’ I feel two worlds: one ends and one begins. Methinks I dwell in both; being much here, But more hereafter: even as when the nurse Doth give the babe into the mother's arms, And she who hath not quite resigned, and she Who hath not all received, support in twain The single burden; ne'ertheless the babe Already tastes its mother. Lord, I come. Thy signs are in me. ‘He shall wipe away All tears:’ Thou see'st my tears are wiped away. ‘There shall be no more pain:’ Lord, it is done, Here there is no more pain. ‘The sun no more Shall be their light by day:’ even so, Lord, I need no light of sun or moon! My heart Is as a lamp of jasper, crystal-clear, Dark when Thy light is out, but lit with Thee The sun may be a suckling at this breast, And milk a nobler glory. Lord, I know Mine hour. This painful world, that was of thorns, Is roses. Like a fragrance thro' my soul I breathe a balm of slumber. Let me sleep. Bring me my easy pillows, Margery. I am asleep; this oak is soft: all things Are rest: I sink as into bliss. O Lord, Now lettest Thou Thy servant depart in peace. THE SODGER'S LASSIE.

LADY CONSTANCE. My Love, my Lord, I think the toil of glorious day is done. I see thee leaning on thy jewelled sword, And a light-hearted child of France Is dancing to thee in the sun, And thus he carols in his dance. ‘Oh, a gallant sans peur Is the merry chasseur, With his fanfaron horn and his rifle ping-pang! And his grand havresack Of gold on his back, His pistol cric-crac! And his sword cling-clang! Oh, to see him blithe and gay From some hot and bloody day, Come to dance the night away till the bugle blows “au rang,” With a wheel and a whirl And a wheeling waltzing girl, And his bow, “place aux dames!” and his oath “feu et sang!” And his hop and his fling Till his gold and silver ring To the clatter and the clash of his sword cling-clang! But hark, Thro' the dark, Up goes the well-known shout! The drums beat the turn out! Cut short your coarting, Monsieur l' Amant! Saddle! mount! march! trot! Down comes the storm of shot, The foe is at the charge! En avant! His jolly havresack Of gold is on his back, Hear his pistol cric-crac! hear his rifle ping-pang! Vive l' Empereur! And where's the Chasseur? He's in Among the din Steel to steel cling-clang!’ And thou within the doorway of thy tent Leanest at ease with careless brow unbent, Watching the dancer in as pleased a dream As if he were a gnat i' the evening gleam, And thou and I were sitting side by side Within the happy bower Where oft at this same hour We watched them the sweet year I was a bride. My Love, my Lord, Leaning so grandly on thy jewelled sword, Is there no thought of home to whisper thee, None can relieve the weary guard I keep, None wave the flag of breathing truce for me, Nor sound the hours to slumber or to weep? Once in a moon the bugle breaks thy rest, I count my days by trumpets and alarms: Thou liest down in thy warcloak and art blest, While I, who cannot sleep but in thine arms, Wage night and day fresh fields unknown to fame, Arm, marshal, march, charge, fight, fall, faint, and die, Know all a soldier can endure but shame, And every chance of warfare but to fly. I do not murmur at my destiny: It can but go with love, with whom it came, And love is like the sun—his light is sweet, And sweet his shadow—welcome both to me! Better for ever to endure that hurt Which thou canst taste but once than once to lie At ease when thou hast anguish. Better I Be often sad when thou art gay than gay One moment of thy sorrow. Tho' I pray Too oft I shall win nothing of the sky But my unfilled desire and thy desert Can take it and still lack. Oh, might I stay At the shut gates of heaven! that so I meet Each issuing fate, and cling about his feet And melt the dreadful purpose of his eye, And not one power pass unimpleaded by Whose bolt might be for thee! Aye, love is sweet In shine or shade! But love hath jealousy, That knowing but so little thinks so much! And I am jealous of thee even with such A fatal knowledge. For I wot too well In the set season that I cannot tell Death will be near thee. This thought doth deflour All innocence from time. I dare not say ‘Not now,’ but for the instant cull the hour, And for the hour reap all the doubtful day, And for the day the year: and so, forlorn, From morn till night, from startled night till morn, Like a blind slave I bear thine heavy ill Till thy time comes to take it: come when 't will The broken slave will bend beneath it still. HOW'S MY BOY? ‘Ho, Sailor of the sea! How's my boy—my boy?’ ‘What's your boy's name, good wife, And in what good ship sailed he?’ ‘My boy John— He that went to sea— What care I for the ship, sailor? My boy's my boy to me. ‘You come back from sea. And not know my John? I might as well have asked some landsman Yonder down in the town. There's not an ass in all the parish But he knows my John. ‘How's my boy—my boy? And unless you let me know I'll swear you are no sailor, Blue jacket or no, Brass buttons or no, sailor, Anchor and crown or no! Sure his ship was the “Jolly Briton”’— ‘Speak low, woman, speak low!’ ‘And why should I speak low, sailor, About my own boy John? If I was loud as I am proud I'd sing him over the town! Why should I speak low, sailor?’ ‘That good ship went down.’ ‘How's my boy—my boy? What care I for the ship, sailor, I was never aboard her? Be she afloat or be she aground, Sinking or swimming, I'll be bound Her owners can afford her! I say, how's my John?’ ‘Every man on board went down, Every man aboard her.’ ‘How's my boy—my boy? What care I for the men, sailor? I'm not their mother— How's my boy—my boy? Tell me of him and no other! How's my boy—my boy?’ FAREWELL. Can I see thee stand On the looming land? Dost thou wave with thy white hand Farewell, farewell? I could think that thou art near, Thy sweet voice is in mine ear, Farewell, farewell! While I listen, all things seem Singing in a singing dream, Farewell, farewell! Echoing in an echoing dream, Farewell, farewell! Yon boat upon the sea, It floats 'twixt thee and me, I see the boatman listless lie; He cannot hear the cry That in mine ears doth ring Farewell, farewell! Doth it pass him o'er and o'er, Heard upon the shore behind, Farewell, farewell! Heard upon the ship before, Farewell, farewell! Like an arrow that can dart Viewless thro' the viewless wind, Plain on the quivering string, And plain in the victim's heart? Are there voices in the sky, Farewell, farewell? Am I mocked by the bright air, Farewell, farewell? The empty air that everywhere Silvers back the sung reply, Farewell, farewell! While to and fro the tremulous accents fly, Farewell, farewell! Now shown, now shy, Farewell, farewell! Now song, now sigh, Farewell, farewell! Toy with the grasping heart that deems them nigh, Come like blown bells in sudden wind and high, Or far on furthest verge in lingering echoes die, Farewell, farewell! Farewell, farewell, farewell! Oh, Love! what strange dumb Fate Hath broken into voice to see us hope? Surely we part to meet again? Like one struck blind, I grope In vain, in vain; I cannot hold a single sense to tell The meaning of this melancholy bell, Farewell, farewell! I touch them with my thought, and small and great They join the swaying swell, Farewell, farewell! Farewell, farewell, farewell! Aye, when I felt thee falling On this heaving breast— Aye, when I felt thee prest Nearer, nearer, nearer, Dearer, dearer, dearer— Aye, while I saw thy face, In that long last embrace, The first, the last, the best— Aye, while I held thee heart to heart, My soul had pushed off from the shore, And we were far apart; I heard her calling, calling, From the sea of nevermore Farewell, farewell! Fainter, fainter, like a bell Rung from some receding ship, Farewell, farewell! The far and further knell Did hardly reach my lip, Farewell, farewell! Farewell, farewell, farewell! Away, you omens vain! Away, away! What! will you not be driven? My heart is trembling to your augury. Hence! Like a flight of seabirds at a gun, A thousand ways they scatter back to Heaven, Wheel lessening out of sight, and swoop again as one! Farewell, farewell! Farewell, farewell, farewell! Oh, Love! what fatal spell Is winding, winding round me to this singing? What hands unseen are flinging The tightening mesh that I can feel too well? What viewless wings are winging The siren music of this passing bell? Farewell, farewell! Farewell, farewell, farewell! Arouse my heart! arouse! This is the sea: I strike these wooden walls: The sailors come and go at my command: I lift this cable with my hand: I loose it and it falls: Arouse! she is not lost, Thou art not plighted to a moonlight ghost, But to a living spouse. Arouse! we only part to meet again! Oh thou moody main, Are thy mermaid cells a-ringing? Are thy mermaid sisters singing? The saddest shell of every cell Ringing still, and ringing Farewell, farewell! To the sinking sighing singing, To the floating flying singing, To the deepening dying singing, In the swell, Farewell, farewell! And the failing wailing ringing, The reaming dreaming ringing Of fainter shell in deeper cell, To the sunken sunken singing, Farewell, farewell! Farewell, farewell! Farewell, farewell, farewell? THE MILKMAID'S SONG. Turn, turn, for my cheeks they burn, Turn by the dale, my Harry! Fill pail, fill pail, He has turned by the dale, And there by the stile waits Harry. Fill, fill, Fill pail, fill, For there by the stile waits Harry! The world may go round, the world may stand still, But I can milk and marry, Fillpail, I can milk and marry. Wheugh, wheugh! Oh, if we two Stood down there now by the water, I know who'd carry me over the ford As brave as a soldier, as proud as a lord, Tho' I don't live over the water. Wheugh, wheugh! he's whistling thro,' He's whistling ‘the farmer's daughter.’ Give down, give down, My crumpled brown! He shall not take the road to the town, For I'll meet him beyond the water. Give down, give down, My crumpled brown! And send me to my Harry. The folk o' towns May have silken gowns, But I can milk and marry, Fillpail, I can milk and marry. Wheugh, wheugh! he has whistled thro', He has whistled thro' the water. Fill, fill, with a will, a will, For he's whistled thro' the water, And he's whistling down The way to the town, And it's not ‘the farmer's daughter!’ Churr, churr! goes the cockchafer, The sun sets over the water, Churr, churr! goes the cockchafer, I'm too late for my Harry! And, oh, if he goes a-soldiering, The cows they may low, the bells they may ring, But I'll neither milk nor marry, Fillpail, Neither milk nor marry. My brow beats on thy flank, Fillpail, Give down, good wench, give down! I know the primrose bank, Fillpail, Between him and the town. Give down, good wench, give down, Fillpail, And he shall not reach the town! Strain, strain! he's whistling again, He's nearer by half a mile. More, more! Oh, never before Where you such a weary while! Fill, fill! he's crossed the hill, I can see him down by the style, He's passed the hay, he's coming this way, He's coming to me, my Harry! Give silken gowns to the folk o' towns, He's coming to me, my Harry! There's not so grand a dame in the land, That she walks to-night with Harry! Come late, come soon, come sun, come moon, Oh, I can milk and marry, Fillpail, I can milk and marry. Wheugh, wheugh! he has whistled thro', My Harry! my lad! my lover! Set the sun and fall the dew, Heigho, merry world, what's to do That you're smiling over and over? Up on the hill and down in the dale, And along the tree-tops over the vale Shining over and over, Low in the grass and high on the bough, Shining over and over, Oh, world, have you ever a lover? You were so dull and cold just now, Oh, world, have you ever a lover? I could not see a leaf on the tree, And now I could count them, one, two, three, Count them over and over, Leaf from leaf like lips apart, Like lips apart for a lover. And the hill-side beats with my beating heart, And the apple-tree blushes all over, And the May bough touched me and made me start, And the wind breathes warm like a lover. Pull, pull! and the pail is full, And milking's done and over. Who would not sit here under the tree? What a fair fair thing's a green field to see! Brim, brim, to the rim, ah me! I have set my pail on the daisies! It seems so light—can the sun be set? The dews must be heavy, my cheeks are wet, I could cry to have hurt the daisies! Harry is near, Harry is near, My heart's as sick as if he were here, My lips are burning, my cheeks are wet, He hasn't uttered a word as yet, But the air's astir with his praises, My Harry! The air's astir with your praises. He has scaled the rock by the pixy's stone, He's among the kingcups—he picks me one, I love the grass that I tread upon When I go to my Harry! He has jumped the brook, he has climbed the knowe, There's never a faster foot I know, But still he seems to tarry. Oh, Harry! oh, Harry! my love, my pride, My heart is leaping, my arms are wide! Roll up, roll up, you dull hill-side, Roll up, and bring my Harry! They may talk of glory over the sea, But Harry's alive, and Harry's for me, My love, my lad, my Harry! Come spring, come winter, come sun, come snow, What cares Dolly whether or no, While I can milk and marry? Right or wrong, and wrong or right, Quarrel who quarrel, and fight who fight, But I'll bring my pail home every night To love, and home, and Harry! We'll drink our can, we'll eat our cake, There's beer in the barrel, there's bread in the bake, The world may sleep, the world may wake, But I shall milk and marry, And marry, I shall milk and marry. THE GERMAN LEGION. In the cot beside the water, In the white cot by the water, The white cot by the white water, There they laid the German maid. There they wound her, singing round her, Deftly wound her, singing round her, Softly wound her, singing round her, In a shroud like a cloud. And they decked her as they wound her, With a wreath of leaves they bound her, Lornest leaves they scattered round her, Singing grief with every leaf. Singing grief with every leaf. Sadder grief with sadder leaf, Sweeter leaf with sweeter grief, So't was sung in a dark tongue. Like a latter lily lying, O'er whom falling leaves are sighing, And Autumn vapours crying, Pale and cold on misty mould, So I saw her sweet and lowly, Shining shining pale and holy, Thro' the dim woe slowly slowly, Said and sung in that dark tongue. Such an awe her beauty lent her, While they sang I dared not enter That charmed ring where she was centre, But I stood with stirring blood Till the song fell like a billow, And I saw them leave her pillow, And go forth to the far willow, For the wreath of virgin death. And I stood beside her pillow, While they plucked the distant willow, And my heart rose like a billow As I said to the pale dead— ‘Oh, thou most fair and sweet virginity, Of whom this heart that beats for thee doth know Nor name nor story, that these limbs can be For no man evermore, that thou must go Cold to the cold, and that no eye shall see That which thine unsolved womanhood doth owe Of the incommunicable mystery Shakes me with tears. I could kneel down by thee, And o'er thy chill unmarriageable rest Cry, “Thou who shalt no more at all be prest To any heart, one moment come to this! And feel me weeping with thy want of bliss, And all the unpraisèd beauties of thy breast— Thy breast which never shall a lover kiss!”’ Then I slowly left her pillow, For they came back with the willow, And my heart sinks as a billow Doth implore towards the shore, As I see the crown they weave her, And I know that I must leave her, And I feel that I could grieve her Sad and sore for evermore. And again they sang around her, In a richer robe they wound her, With the willow wreath they bound her, And the loud song like a cloud Of golden obscuration, With the strange tongue of her nation, Filled the house of lamentation, Till she lay in melody, Like a latter lily lying, O'er whom falling leaves are sighing, And the Autumn vapours crying, In a dream of evening gleam. And I saw her sweet and lowly, Shining shining pale and holy, Thro' the dim woe slowly slowly Said and sung in a dark tongue. In the cot beside the water, The white cot by the white water, English cot by English water That shall see the German sea. A HEALTH TO THE QUEEN. While the thistle bears Spears, And the shamrock is green, And the English rose Blows, A health to the Queen! A health to the Queen, a health to the Queen! Fill high, boys, drain dry, boys, A health to the Queen! The thistle bears spears round its blossom, Round its blossom the shamrock is green, The rose grows and glows round the rose in its bosom, We stand sword in hand round the Queen! Our glory is green round the Queen! We close round the rose, round the Queen! The Queen, boys, the Queen! a health to the Queen! Fill high, boys, drain dry, boys, A health to the Queen! Last post I'd a note from that old aunt of mine, 'T was meant for a hook, but she called it a line; She says, I don't know why we're going to fight, She's sure I don't know—and I'm sure she's quite right; She swears I haven't looked at one sole protocol; Tantara! tantara! I haven't, 'pon my soul! Soho, blow trumpeter, Trumpeter, trumpeter! Soho, blow trumpeter, onward's the cry! Fall, tyrants, fall—the devil care why! A health to the Queen; a health to the Queen! Fill high, boys, drain dry, boys, A health to the Queen! My granny came down—‘pour vous voir, mon barbare,’ She brought in her pocket a map—du Tartare— Drawn up, so she vowed, ‘par un homme ah! si bon!’ With a plan for campaigning old Hal, en haut ton. With here you may trick him, and here you may prick him, And here—if you do it en roi—you may lick him, But there he is sacred, and yonder—Oh, la! He's as dear a sweet soul as your late grandpapa! Soho, blow trumpeter, Trumpeter, trumpeter! Blow the charge, trumpeter, blare, boy, blare! Fall, tyrants, fall—the devil care where! A health to the Queen, a health to the Queen! Fill high, boys, drain dry, boys, A health to the Queen! My cousin, the Yankee, last night did his best To prove ‘the Czar—bless you's—no worse than the rest.’ We wheeled the decanters out on to the lawn, And he argued—and spat—in a circle till dawn. Quoth I, ‘If the game's half as thick as you say, The more need for hounds, lad! Hunt's up! Harkaway!’ Soho, blow trumpeter! Trumpeter, trumpeter! Tally-ho, trumpeter, over the ditch— Over the ditch, boys, the broad ditch at Dover! Hands slack, boys, heels back, boys, Yohoicks! we're well over! Soho, blow, trumpeter! blow us to cover! Blow, boy, blow, Berlin, or Moscow, Schoenbrun, or Rome, So Reynard's at home, The devil care which! Hark, Evans! hark, Campbell! hark, Cathcart!—Halloo! Heydey, harkaway! good men and true! Harkaway to the brook, You won't land in clover! Leap and look! High and dry! Tantivy, full cry! Full cry up the hill! Hurrah, and it's over! A burst and a kill. While the thistle bears Spears, And the shamrock is green, And the English rose Blows, A health to the Queen! A health to the Queen, a health to the Queen! Fill high, boys, drain dry, boys, A health to the Queen! The Queen, boys, the Queen! the Queen, boys, the Queen! Full cry, high and dry, boys, A health to the Queen! WOE IS ME. Far in the cradling sky, Dawn opes his baby eye, Then I awake and cry, Woe is me! Morn, the young hunter gay, Chases the shadows gray, Then I go forth and say, Woe is me! Noon! drunk with oil and wine, Tho' not a grief is thine, Yet shalt thou shake with mine! Woe is me! Eve kneeleth sad and calm, Bearing the martyr's palm; I shriek above her psalm, Woe is me! Night, hid in her black hair From eyes she cannot dare, Lies loud with fierce despair; Then I sit silent where She cries from her dark lair Woe is me! THE YOUNG MAN'S SONG. At last the curse has run its date! The heavens grow clear above, And on the purple plains of Hate, We'll build the throne of Love! One great heroic reign divine Shall mock the Elysian isles, And love in arms shall only shine Less fair than Love in smiles! Old Clio, burn thine ancient scroll, The scroll of Rome and Greece! Our war shall be a parable On all the texts of peace, And saints look down, with eyes of praise, Where on our modern field The new Samaritan forelays The wrongs that other healed! What virtue is beyond our prize? What deed beneath you sun More Godlike than the prodigies We mortal men have done? We wearied of the lagging steed, The dove had not a quill To fledge the imaginable speed Of our wild shaft of will; ‘Ah, could each word be winged with wind, And speech be swift as sight!’ We cursed the long arms of that blind Dumb herald on the height, Dark struggling with a mystery He daily hid in shades, As a ghost steams up on the eye, Begins a Fate and fades. ‘If, like a man, dull space could hear! If, like a man, obey!’ We seized this earthly hemisphere, This senseless skull of clay. We drew from Heaven a breath of flame, And thro' the lifeless whole Did breathe it till the orb became One brain of burning soul. As he o'er whom a tyrant reigns, It waits our sovran word, And thinks along the living veins The lightnings of its lord! What Force can meet our matchless might? What Power is not our slave? We bound the angel of the light, We scourged him in a cave. And when we saw the prisoner pine For his immortal land, We wrung a ransom, half divine, From that celestial hand Whose skill the heavy chain subdued, And all a captive's woe Did tame to such a tempered good As mortal eyes can know. Who comes, who comes, o'er mountains laid, Vales lifted, straightened ways? 'Tis he! the mightier horse we made To serve our nobler days! But now, unheard, I saw afar His cloud of windy mane, Now, level as a blazing star, He thunders thro' the plain! The life he needs, the food he loves, This cold earth bears no more; He fodders on the eternal groves That heard the dragons roar, Strong with the feast he roars and runs, And, in his maw unfurled, Evolves the folded fires of suns That lit a grander world! Yon bird, the swiftest in the sky, Before him sprang, but he Has passed her as a wind goes by A struggler in the sea. With forward beak and forward blows, She slides back from his side; While ever as the monster goes, With needless power and pride, Disdainful from his fiery jaws He snorts his vital heat, And, easy as his shadow, draws, Long-drawn, the living street. He's gone! Methinks that over him, Like Curtius in the abyss, I see great gulphs close rim to rim, And Past and Future kiss! Oh, Man! as from the flood sublime Some alp rose calm and slow, So from the exhaling floods of time I see thy stature grow. Long since thy royal brow, uncrowned, Allegiant nature saw, Long since thine eye of empire frowned The heavenly thrones to awe; And now the monarch's breast apart Divides the sinking spray, Fit dome for such gigantic heart As warms so vast a sway. Far o'er the watery wilds I see Thy great right-arm upsurge, Thy right-hand, armed with victory, Is sunburst on the verge! Arise, arise! oh, sword! and sweep One universal morn! Another throe, thou labouring Deep, And all the god is born! So sang a youth of glorious blood. Below, the wind-hawk shook her wings, And lower, in its kingdom, stood A tower of ancient kings. Above, the autumn sky was blue, Far round the golden world was fair, And, gun by gun, the ramparts blew A battle on the air. DEAD-MAID'S-POOL. Oh water, water—water deep and still, In this hollow of the hill, Thou helenge well o'er which the long reeds lean, Here a stream and there a stream, And thou so still, between, Thro' thy coloured dream, Thro' the drownèd face Of this lone leafy place, Down, down, so deep and chill, I see the pebbles gleam! Ash-tree, ash-tree, Bending o'er the well, Why there thou bendest, Kind hearts can tell. 'Tis that the pool is deep, 'Tis that—a single leap, And the pool closes: And in the solitude Of this wild mountain wood, None, none, would hear her cry, From this bank where she stood To that peak in the sky Where the cloud dozes. Ash-tree, ash-tree, That art so sweet and good, If any creeping thing Among the summer games in the wild roses Fall from its airy swing, (While all its pigmy kind Watch from some imminent rose-leaf half uncurled)— I know thou hast it full in mind (While yet the drowning minim lives, And blots the shining water where it strives), To touch it with a finger soft and kind, As when the gentle sun, ere day is hot, Feels for a little shadow in a grot, And gives it to the shades behind the world. And oh! if some poor fool Should seek the fatal pool, Thine arms—ah, yes! I know For this thou watchest days, and months, and years, For this dost bend beside The lone and lorn well-side, The guardian angel of the doom below, Content if, once an age, thy helping hand May lift repentant madness to the land: Content to hear the cry Of living love from lips that would have died: To seem awhile endowed With all thy limbs did save, And in that voice they drew out of the grave, To feel thy dumb desire for once released aloud, And all thy muffled century Repaid in one wild hour of sobs, and smiles, and tears. Aye, aye, I envy thee, Pitiful ash-tree! Water, water—water deep and still, In the hollow of the hill, Water, water, well I wot, Thro' the weary hours, Well I wot thee lying there, As fair as false, as false as fair. The crows they fly o'er, The small birds flit about, The stream it ripples in, the stream it ripples out, But what eye ever knew A rinkle wimple thee? And what eye shall see A rinkle wimple thee Evermore? Thro' thy gauds and mocks, All thy thin enchantment thro'— The green delusion of thy bowers, The cold flush of thy feignèd flowers, All the treacherous state Of fair things small and great, That are and are not, Well I wot thee shining there, As fair as false, as false as fair. Thro' the liquid rocks, Thro' the watery trees, Thro' the grass that never grew, Thro' a face God never made, Thro' the frequent gain and loss Of the cold cold shine and shade, Thro' the subtle fern and moss, Thro' the humless, hiveless bees, Round the ghosts of buds asleep, Thro' the disembodied rose, Waving, waving in the deep, Where never wind blows, I look down, and see far down, In clear depths that do nothing hide, Green in green, and brown in brown, The long fish turn and glide! Ash-tree, ash-tree, Bending o'er the water— Ash-tree, ash-tree, Hadst thou a daughter? Ash-tree, ash-tree, let me draw near, Ash-tree, ash-tree, a word in thine ear! Thou art wizen and white, ash-tree; Other trees have gone on, Have gathered and grown, Have bourgeoned and borne: Thou hast wasted and worn. Thy knots are all eyes; Every knot a dumb eye, That has seen a sight And heard a cry. Thy leaves are dry: The summer has not gone by, But they're withered and dead, Like locks round a head That is bald with a secret sin, That is scorched by a hell within. Thy skin Is withered and wan, Like a guilty man: It was thin, Aye, silken and thin, It is houghed And ploughed, Like a murderer's skin. Thou hast no shoots nor wands, All thy arms turn to the deep, All thy twigs are crooked, Twined and twisted, Fingered and fisted, Like one who had looked On wringing hands 'Till his hands were wrung in his sleep. Pardon my doubt of thee, What is this In the very groove Of thy right arm? There is not a snake So yellow and red, There is not a toad So sappy and dread! It doth not move, It doth not hiss— Ash-tree—for God's sake— Hast thou known What hath not been said And the summer sun Cannot keep it warm, And the living wood Cannot shut it down! And it grows out of thee And will be told, Bloody as blood, And yellow as gold! Ash-tree, ash-tree, That once wert so green! Ash-tree, ash-tree! What hast thou seen? Was I a mother—nay or aye? Am I childless—aye nor nay? Ash-tree, ash-tree, Bending o'er the water! Ash-tree, ash-tree, Give me my daughter! Curse the water, Curse thee, Ash-tree, Bending o'er the water! Leaf on the tree, Flower on the stem, Curse thee, And curse them! Trunk and shoot, Herb and weed, Bud and fruit, Blossom and seed, Above and below, About and about, Inside and out, Grown and to grow, Curse you all, Great and small, That cannot give back my daughter! But if there were any, Among so many, Any small thing that did lie sweet for her, Any newt or marish-worm that, shrinking Under the pillow of the water weed, Left her a cleaner bed, Any least leaves that fell with little plashes, And sinking, sinking, Sank soft and slow, and settled on her lashes, And did what was so meet for her, Them I do not curse. See, see up the glen, The evening sun agen! It falls upon the water, It falls upon the grass, Thro' the birches, thro' the firs, Thro' the alders, catching gold, Thro' the bracken and the brier, Goes the evening fire To the bush-linnet's nest. There between us and the west, Dost thou see the angels pass? Thro' the air, with streaming hair, The golden angels pass? Hold, hold! for mercy, hold! I know thee! ah, I know thee! I know thou wilt not pass me so— The gray old woman is ready to go. Call me to thee, call me to thee, My daughter! oh, my daughter! THE SAILOR'S RETURN. This morn I lay a-dreaming, This morn, this merry morn, When the cock crew shrill from over the hill, I heard a bugle horn. And thro' the dream I was dreaming, There sighed the sigh of the sea, And thro' the dream I was dreaming, This voice came singing to me. ‘High over the breakers, Low under the lee, Sing ho The billow, And the lash of the rolling sea! ‘Boat, boat, to the billow, Boat, boat, to the lee! Love on thy pillow, Art thou dreaming of me? ‘Billow, billow, breaking, Land us low on the lee! For sleeping or waking, Sweet love, I am coming to thee! ‘High, high, o'er the breakers, Low, low, on the lee, Sing ho! The billow That brings me back to thee!’ THE WIDOW'S LULLABY. She droops like a dew-dropping lily, ‘Whisht thee, boy, whisht thee, boy Willie! Whisht whisht o' thy wailing, whisht thee, boy Willie!’ The sun comes up from the lea, As he who will never come more Came up that first day to her door, When the ship furled her sails by the shore, And the spring leaves were green on the tree. But she droops like a dew-dropping lily, ‘whisht thee, boy, whisht thee, boy Willie! Whisht whisht o' thy wailing, whisht thee, boy Willie!’ The sun goes down in the sea, As he who will never go more Went down that last day from her door, When the ship set her sails from the shore, And the dead leaves were sere on the tree. But she droops like a dew-dropping lily, ‘Whisht thee, boy, whisht thee, boy Willie! Whisht whisht o' thy wailing, whisht thee, boy Willie!’ The year comes glad o'er the lea, As he who will never come more, Never, ah never! Came up that first day to her door, When the ship furled her sails by the shore, And the spring leaves were green on the tree. Never, ah never! He who will come again, never! But she droops like a dew-dropping lily, ‘Whisht thee, boy, whisht thee, boy Willie! Whisht whisht o' thy wailing, whisht thee, boy Willie!’ The year goes sad to the sea, As he who will never go more For ever went down from her door, Ever, for ever! When the ship set her sails by the shore, And the dead leaves were sere on the tree. Ever, for ever! For ever went down from her door. But she droops like a dew-dropping lily, ‘Whisht thee, boy, whisht thee, boy Willie! Whisht whisht o' thy wailing, whisht thee, boy Willie!’ A gun, and a flash, and a gun, The ship lies again where she lay! High and low, low and high, in the sun, There's a boat, a boat on the bay! High and low, low and high, in the sun, All as she saw it that day, When he came who shall never come more, And the ship furled her sails by the shore. But she droops like a dew-dropping lily, ‘Whisht thee, boy, whisht thee, boy Willie! Whisht whisht o' thy wailing, whisht thee, boy Willie!’ All as she saw it that day, With a gun, and a flash, and a gun, The ship lies again where she lay, And they run, and they ride, and they run, Merry, merry, merry, down the merry highway, To the boat, high and low in the sun. Nearer and nearer she hears the rolling drum, Clearer and clearer she hears the cry, ‘They come,’ Far and near runs the cheer to her ear once so dear, Merry, merry, merry, up the merry highway, As it ran when he came that day And said, ‘Wilt thou be my dearie? Oh, wilt thou be my dearie? My boat is dry in the bay, And I'll love till thou be weary!’ And she could not say him nay, For his bonny eyes o' blue, And never was true-love so true, To never so kind a dearie, As he who will never love more, When the ship furls her sails by the shore. Then she shakes like a wind-stricken lily, ‘Whisht thee, boy, whisht thee, boy Willie! Whisht whisht o' thy wailing, whisht thee, boy Willie!’ THE GABERLUNZIE'S WALK. The Laird is dead, the laird is dead, An' dead is cousin John, His henchmen ten, an' his sax merrie men, Forbye the steward's son. An' his ain guid gray that he strode sae gay When hunt was up an' on, An' the win' blew fair, an' the grews pu'd sair, An' dawn was on Maol-don, An' the skeigh steeds neigh'd, an' the slot-hounds bay'd, An' up gaed the mornin' sun, An' awa' gaed the deer wi' the merrie men's cheer, Awa' owre the auld Maol-don, An' awa' wi' a shout ran the rabble an' the rout, An' awa' rode cousin John, Wi' his horn, his horn, thro' the merry merry morn, His hunter's horn sae shrill! An' 't was ‘Ho, heigho, hereawa’, Hereawa', hereawa'! Ho, heigho, hereawa'!' A' roun' the hill! Walie! walie! they're a' gane dead, A' owre the seas an' awa' The laird an' his men, the sax an' the ten, They gaed to fight and to fa'. An' walie, an' wae, an' hech! the weary day! The laird is dead an' a'! A' in ae grave by the margent o' the wave Thegither they lay doun, Sax feet deep, where dead men sleep, A' i' the faeman's grun'. Foremost i' the van, wi' his bagpipes i' his han', The steward's ae braw son, An' next the young laird—gin the guid Lord had spared!— A' as he led them on, Wi' his bonnie brow bare an' his lang fair hair, An' his bluidy braid-sword drawn; An' hard by his chief, that in life was sae lief, In death cam cousin John, Wi' his horn, his horn, thro' the merry merry morn, His hunter's horn sae shrill When 't was ‘Ho, heigho, hereawa’, Hereawa', hereawa'!’ Ho, heigho, hereawa'!' A' roun' the hill! Gin ony uphauld the young Laird lies cauld, An' cauld lies cousin John, Sax feet deep, as dead men sleep, A' i' the faeman's grun,' A' in ae grave by the margent o' the wave, Where doun they lay that day, Wi' the henchmen ten, an' the sax merrie men, Ask the gaberlunzie gray. Step an' step, step an' step, gaed the gaberlunzie gray, Faint an lame, wi' empty wame, he hirples on his way. Step an' step, step an' step, an' owre the hill maun he, His head is bent, his pipe is brent, he has na a bawbee. Step an' step, step an' step, he totters thro' the mirk, He hears the fox amang the cocks, the houlet by the kirk. Step an' step, step an' step, an' as he climbs the hill The auld auld moon is gaun doun; the nicht grows cauld an' still, The breathin' kye aroun' him lie, the ingle-light is gane, He wakes the yowes amang the knowes, an' still he gangs his lane. His slow steps rouse the blethrin' grouse, the peewit fa's an' squeals, The nicht-goat bleats amang the peats, an' still he speils an' speils, Step an' step, step an' step, an' up the craigie stark, An' mony a stane ane after ane gangs snirtlin' doun the dark. Step an' step, step an' step, that gaberlunzie gray, A' win's seem tint far far ahint as he gangs on his way. He hears the burn amang the fern, he hears the stoatie cheep, He hears the rustle, an' flit an' fussle, as the kae shifts her roost in her sleep. Step an' step, step an' step, he gangs wi' troubled breath, He feels the silence a' aboon, he feels the warl beneath; Wheet an' wheet about his feet the startit mousie ran, An' as he gaes his riskin' claes aye gar him start an' stan'; An' as he stan's wi' knotted han's, an' leans his chitterin' head, He hears the sod his steps have trod a-tirlin' to his tread; An' crisp foot-fa', an' sibblin sma' o' stealthy cony crappin', An' click o' bat aboon his hat, like fairy fingers snappin', An' ilka yird that ticked an' stirred, where swairdie there is nae, As elfin shools the tittlin' mools gar'd rinkle doun the brae; An' safter soun' alang the groun' the grass-taps thro' an' thro', Gin owre the fiel's the wee bit chiel's were dealin' out the dew. Step an' step, step an' step, an' hech! his freezin' bluid! He gaes into the silence as ane gaes into a wood. The mair the height, mair still the nicht, an' faster did he gang, Step an' step, an' then a step, an' he listens hard an' lang! He listens twice, he listens thrice, but why he disna ken; His cauld skin skeared, an' clipped his beard; he stops an' lists agen. There's somethin' creepin' thro' his banes, there's somethin' stirs his hair: 'Tis mair than use, he canna choose, he listens ten times mair! He pits his pack fra his auld back, he sits him on a stane, His eyelids fa', he gapes his jaw, an' harks wi' might an' main, The mair he list the mair uprist his gray-locks wi' affright, Till ilka hair that he might wear was stiff an' stark upright. His sick heart stops, the low moon drops, the nicht is eerie chill! Wi' sudden shout the dead cry out, like hunters at a kill, Full cry, full cry, the win's sweep by, a horn, a horn is shrill! An' 'tis ‘Ho, heigho, hereawa', Hereawa', hereawa'! Ho, heigho, hereawa'!' A' roun' the hill! LIBERTY TO M. LE DIPLOMATE. Thou fool who treatest with the sword, and not With the strong arm that wields it! Thou insane Who seest the dew-drops on the lion's mane, But dost forget the lion! Oh thou sot, Hugging thy drunken dream! Thou idiot Who makest a covenant against the rain With autumn leaves! Thou atheist who dost chain This miserable body that can rot, And thinkest it Me! Fool! for the swordless arm Shall strike thee dead. Madman, the lion wakes, And with one shake is dry. Sot, the day breaks Shall sober even thee. Idiot, one storm And thou art bare. Atheist, the corse is thine, But lo, the unfettered soul immortal and divine! AN EVENING DREAM. I'm leaning where you loved to lean in eventides of old, The sun has sunk an hour ago behind the treeless wold, In this old oriel that we loved how oft I sit forlorn, Gazing, gazing, up the vale of green and waving corn. The summer corn is in the ear, thou knowest what I see Up the long wide valley, and from seldom tree to tree, The serried corn, the serried corn, the green and serried corn, From the golden morn till night, from the moony night till morn. I love it, morning, noon, and night, in sunshine and in rain, For being here it seems to say, ‘The lost come back again.’ And being here as green and fair as those old fields we knew, It says, ‘The lost when they come back, come back unchanged and true.’ But more than at the shout of morn, or in the sleep of noon, Smiling with a smiling star, or wan beneath a wasted moon, I love it, soldier brother! at this weird dim hour, for then The serried ears are swords and spears, and the fields are fields of men. Rank on rank in faultless phalanx stern and still I can discern, Phalanx after faultless phalanx in dumb armies still and stern; Army on army, host on host, till the bannered nations stand, As the dead may stand for judgment silent on the o'erpeopled land. Not a bayonet stirs: down sinks the awful twilight, dern and dun, On an age that waits its leader, on a world that waits the sun. Then your dog—I know his voice—cries from out the courtyard nigh, And my love too well interprets all that long and mournful cry! In my passion that thou art not, lo! I see thee as thou art, And the pitying fancy brings thee to assuage the anguished heart. ‘Oh my brother!’ and my bosom's throb of welcome at the word, Claps a hundred thousand hands, and all my legions hail thee lord. And the vast unmotioned myriads, front to front, as at a breath, Live and move to martial music, down the devious dance of death. Ah, thou smilest, scornful brother, at a maiden's dream of war! And thou shakest back thy locks as if—a glow-worm for thy star— I dubbed thee with a blade of grass, by earthlight, in a fairy ring, Knight o' the garter o' Queen Mab, or lord in waiting to her king. Brother, in thy plumèd pride of tented field and turretted tower, Smiling brother, scornful brother, darest thou watch with me one hour? Even now some fate is near, for I shake and know not why, And a wider sight is orbing, orbing, on my moistened eye, And I feel a thousand flutterings round my soul's still vacant field, Like the ravens and the vultures o'er a carnage yet unkilled. Hist! I see the stir of glamour far upon the twilight wold, Hist! I see the vision rising! List! and as I speak behold! These dull mists are mists of morning, and behind yon eastern hill, The hot sun abides my bidding: he shall melt them when I will. All the night that now is past, the foe hath laboured for the day, Creeping thro' the stealthy dark, like a tiger to his prey. Throw this window wider! Strain thine eyes along the dusky vale! Art thou cold with horror? Has thy bearded cheek grown pale? 'Tis the total Russian host, flooding up the solemn plain, Secret as a silent sea, mighty as a moving main! Oh, my country! is there none to rouse thee to the rolling sight? Oh thou gallant sentinel who has watched so oft so well, must thou sleep this only night? So hath the shepherd lain on a rock above a plain, Nor beheld the flood that swelled from some embowelled mount of woe, Waveless, foamless, sure and slow, Silent o'er the vale below, Till nigher still and nigher comes the seeth of fields on fire, And the thrash of falling trees, and the steam of rivers dry, And before the burning flood the wild things of the wood Skulk and scream, and fight, and fall, and flee, and fly. A gun! and then a gun! I' the far and early sun Dost thou see by yonder tree a fleeting redness rise, As if, one after one, ten poppies red had blown, And shed in a blinking of the eyes? They have started from their rest with a bayonet at each breast, Those watchers of the west who shall never watch again! 'Tis nought to die, but oh, God's pity on the woe Of dying hearts that know they die in vain! Beyond yon backward height that meets their dying sight, A thousand tents are white, and a slumbering army lies. ‘Brown Bess,’ the sergeant cries, as he loads her while he dies, ‘Let this devil's deluge reach them, and the good old cause is lost.’ He dies upon the word, but his signal gun is heard, Yon ambush green is stirred, yon labouring leaves are tost, And a sudden sabre waves, and like dead from opened graves, A hundred men stand up to meet a host. Dumb as death, with bated breath, Calm upstand that fearless band, And the dear old native land, like a dream of sudden sleep, Passes by each manly eye that is fixed so stern and dry On the tide of battle rolling up the steep. They hold their silent ground, I can hear each fatal sound Upon that summer mound which the morning sunshine warms, The word so brief and shrill that rules them like a will, The sough of moving limbs, and the clank and ring of arms. ‘Fire!’ and round that green knoll the sudden warclouds roll, And from the tyrant's ranks so fierce an answ'ring blast Of whirling death came back that the green trees turned to black, And dropped their leaves in winter as it passed. A moment on each side the surging smoke is wide, Between the fields are green, and around the hills are loud, But a shout breaks out, and lo! they have rushed upon the foe, As the living lightning leaps from cloud to cloud. Fire and flash, smoke and crash, The fogs of battle close o'er friends and foes, and they are gone! Alas, thou bright-eyed boy! alas, thou mother's joy! With thy long hair so fair, thou didst so bravely lead them on! I faint with pain and fear. Ah, heaven! what do I hear? A trumpet-note so near? What are these that race like hunters at a chase? Who are these that run a thousand men as one? What are these that crash the trees far in the waving rear? Fight on, thou young hero! there's help upon the way! The light horse are coming, the great guns are coming, The Highlanders are coming;—good God give us the day! Hurrah for the brave and the leal! Hurrah for the strong and the true! Hurrah for the helmets of steel! Hurrah for the bonnets o' blue! A run and a cheer, the Highlanders are here! a gallop and a cheer, the light horse are here! A rattle and a cheer, the great guns are here! With a cheer they wheel round and face the foe! As the troopers wheel about, their long swords are out, With a trumpet and a shout, in they go! Like a yawning ocean green, the huge host gulphs them in, But high o'er the rolling of the flood, Their sabres you may see like lights upon the sea When the red sun is going down in blood. Again, again, again! And the lights are on the wane! Ah, Christ! I see them sink, light by light, As the gleams go one by one when the great sun is down, And the sea rocks in foam beneath the night. Aye, the great sun is low, and the waves of battle flow O'er his honoured head; but, oh, we mourn not he is down, For to-morrow he shall rise to fill his country's eyes, As he sails up the skies of renown! Ye may yell, but ye shall groan! Ye shall buy them bone for bone! Now, tyrant, hold thine own! blare the trumpet, peal the drum! From yonder hill-side dark, the storm is on you! Hark! Swift as lightning, loud as thunder, down they come! As on some Scottish shore, with mountains frowning o'er, The sudden tempests roar from the glen, And roll the tumbling sea in billows to the lee, Came the charge of the gallant Highlandmen! And as one beholds the sea tho' the wind he cannot see, But by the waves that flee knows its might, So I tracked the Highland blast by the sudden tide that past O'er the wild and rolling vast of the fight. Yes, glory be to God! they have stemmed the foremost flood! I lay me on the sod and breathe again! In the precious moments won, the bugle call has gone To the tents where it never rang in vain, And lo, the landscape wide is red from side to side, And all the might of England loads the plain! Like a hot and bloody dawn, across the horizon drawn, While the host of darkness holds the misty vale, As glowing and as grand our bannered legions stand, And England's flag unfolds upon the gale! At that great sign unfurled, as morn moves o'er the world When God lifts His standard of light, With a tumult and a voice, and a rushing mighty noise, Our long line moves forward to the fight. Clarion and clarion defying, Sounding, resounding, replying, Trumpets braying, pipers playing, chargers neighing, Near and far The to and fro storm of the never-done hurrahing, Thro' the bright weather banner and feather rising and falling, bugle and fife Calling, recalling—for death or for life— Our host moved on to the war, While England, England, England, England, England! Was blown from line to line near and far, And like the morning sea, our bayonets you might see, Come beaming, gleaming, streaming, Streaming, gleaming, beaming, Beaming, gleaming, streaming, to the war. Clarion and clarion defying, Sounding, resounding, replying, Trumpets braying, pipers playing, chargers neighing, Near and far The to and fro storm of the never-done hurrahing, Thro' the bright weather, banner and feather rising and falling, bugle and fife Calling, recalling—for death or for life— Our long line moved forward to the war. IN WAR-TIME A PSALM OF THE HEART. Scourge us as Thou wilt, oh Lord God of Hosts; Deal with us, Lord, according to our transgressions; But give us Victory! Victory, victory! oh, Lord, victory! Oh, Lord, victory! Lord, Lord, victory! Lift Thy wrath up from the day of battle, And set it on the weight of other days! Draw Thy strength from us for many days, So Thou be with us on the day of battle, And give us victory. Victory, victory! oh, Lord, victory! Oh, Lord, victory! Lord, Lord, victory! Let the strong arm be as the flag o' the river, The withered flag that flappeth o'er the river, When all the flood is dried out of the river; Let the brave heart be as a drunkard's bosom, When the thick fume is frozen in the bosom, And the bare sin lies shivering in the bosom; Let the bold eye be sick and crazed with midnight, Strained and cracked with aching days of midnight, Swarmed and foul with creeping shapes of midnight; So Thou return upon the day of battle, So we be strong upon the day of battle, Be drunk with Thee upon the day of battle, So Thou shine o'er us in the day of battle, Shine in the faces of our enemies, Hot in the faces of our enemies, Hot o'er the battle and the victory. Victory, victory! oh, Lord, victory! Oh, Lord, victory! Lord, Lord, victory! Shame us not, oh Lord, before the wicked! In our hidden places let Thy wrath Afflict us; in the secret of our sin Convince us; be the bones within our flesh Marrowed with fire, and all the strings of life Strung to the twang of torture; let the stench Of our own strength torment us; the desire Of our own glorious image in the sea Consume us; shake the darkness like a tree, And fill the night with mischiefs,—blights and dwales, Weevils, and rots, and cankers! But, oh Lord, Humble us not upon the day of battle, Hide not Thy face upon the day of battle, Let it shine o'er us on the day of battle, Shine in the faces of our enemies, Hot in the faces of our enemies, Hot o'er the battle and the victory! Victory, victory! oh, Lord, victory! Oh, Lord, victory! Lord, Lord, victory! Tho' Thou shouldst glorify us above measure, Yet will we not forget that Thou art God! Honour our land, oh Lord! honour our land! Be Thou her armour in the day of battle, Whereon the sword of man shall strike in vain! For Thou canst find the place and leave no scar, Sting of bee, nor fairy-spot nor mole, Yet kill the germ within the core of life. Oh lead her in the glory of her beauty, So that the nations wonder at her beauty! For Thou canst take her beauty by the heart And throw the spout of sorrow from the fountain, The flood of sorrow thro' the veins of joy. Let her soul look out of her eyes of glory, Lighten, oh Lord, fron awful eyes of glory! For Thou canst touch the soul upon its throne, The fortressed soul upon its guarded throne, Nor scorch the sweet air of the populous splendour That comes and goes about a leprous king. Therefore fear not to bless us, oh Lord God! And give us victory! Victory, victory! oh, Lord, victory! Oh, Lord, victory! Lord, Lord, victory! Sight of home, if Thou wilt; kiss of love, If Thou wilt; children at the knees of peace, If Thou wilt; parents weeping in the door Of welcome, if Thou wilt; but victory, Victory, victory! oh, Lord, victory! Oh, Lord, victory! Lord, Lord, victory! Pangs if Thou wilt, oh Lord! Death if Thou wilt! Labour and famine, frost and fire and storm, Silent plague, and hurricane of battle, The field-grave, and the wolf-grave, and the sea! But victory, victory! oh, Lord, victory! Oh, Lord, victory! Lord, Lord, victory! Consider, Lord, the oppressions of the oppressor, And give us victory! The tyrant sitteth on his golden throne In palaces of silver, to his gates The meeting winds blow good from all the world. Who hath undone the mountain where he locks His treasure? In the armoury of hell Which engine is not his? His name infects The air of every zone, and to each tongue From Hecla to the Ganges adds a word That kills all terms of pride. His servants sit In empires round his empire; and outspread As land beneath the water, oh, my God, His kingdoms bear the half of all Thy stars! Who hath out-told his princes? Who hath summed His captains? From the number of his hosts He should forget a nation and not lack! Therefore, oh Lord God, give us victory! The serf is in his hut; the unsacred sire Who can beget no honour. Lo his mate Dim thro' the reeking garlic—she whose womb Doth shape his ignorant shame, and whose young slave In some far field thickens a knouted hide For baser generations. Their dull eyes Are choked with feudal welfare; their rank limbs Steam in the stye of plenty; their rude tongues, That fill the belly from the common trough, Discharge in gobbets of as gross a speech That other maw the heart. Nor doth the boor Refuse his owner's chattel tho' she breed The rich man's increase, nor doth she disdain The joyless usage of such limbs as toil Yoked with the nobler ox, and take as mute A beast's infliction; at her stolid side The girl that shall be such a thing as she, Suckles the babe she would not, with the milk A bondmaid owes her master. Lord, Thou seest! Therefore, oh Lord God, give us victory! The captive straineth at the dungeon-grate. Behold, oh Lord, the secret of the rock, The dungeon, and the captive, and the chain! Tho' it be hidden under forest leaves, Tho' it be on the mountains among clouds, Tho' they point to it as a crag o' the hill, And say concerning it that the wind waileth, Thou knowest the inner secret and the sin! I see his white face at the dungeon bars, As snow between the bars of winter trees. He sinketh down upon the dungeon stones, His white face making light within the dungeon, The claspèd whiteness of his praying hands Flickering a little light within the dungeon. And thro' the darkness, thro' the cavern darkness, Like to a runnel in a savage wood, Sweet thro' the horror of the hollow dark He sings the song of home in the strange land. How long, oh Lord of thunder? Victory! Lord God of vengeance, give us victory! Victory, victory! oh, Lord, victory! Oh, Lord, victory! Lord, Lord, victory! A SHOWER IN WAR-TIME. Rain, rain, sweet warm rain, On the wood and on the plain! Rain, rain, warm and sweet, Summer wood lush leafy and loud, With note of a throat that ripples and rings, Sad sole sweet from her central seat, Bubbling and trilling, Filling, filling, filling The shady space of the green dim place With an odour of melody, Till all the noon is thrilling, And the great wood hangs in the balmy day Like a cloud with an angel in the cloud, And singing because she sings! In the sheltering wood, At that hour I stood; I saw that in that hour Great round drops, clear round drops, Grew on every leaf and flower, And its hue so fairly took And faintly, that each tinted elf Trembled with a rarer self, Even as if its beauty shook With passion to a tenderer look. Rain, rain, sweet warm rain, On the wood and on the plain! Rain, rain, warm and sweet, Summer wood lush leafy and loud, With note of a throat that ripples and rings, Sad sole sweet from her central seat, Bubbling and trilling, Filling, filling, filling The shady space of the green dim place With an odour of melody, Till all the noon is thrilling, And the great wood hangs in the balmy day, Like a cloud with an angel in the cloud, And singing because she sings! Then out of the sweet warm weather There came a little wind sighing, sighing: Came to the wood sighing, and sighing went in, Sighed thro' the green grass, and o'er the leaves brown, Sighed to the dingle, and, sighing, lay down, While all the flowers whispered together. Then came swift winds after her who was flying, Swift bright winds with a jocund din, Sought her in vain, her boscage was so good, And spread like baffled revellers thro' the wood. Then, from bough, and leaf, and bell, The great round drops, the clear round drops, In fitful cadence drooped and fell— Drooped and fell as if some wanton air Were more apparent here and there, Sphered on a favourite flower in dewy kiss, Grew heavy with delight and dropped with bliss. Rain, rain, sweet warm rain, On the wood and on the plain; Rain, rain, still and sweet, For the winds have hushed again, And the nightingale is still, Sleeping in her central seat. Rain, rain, summer rain, Silent as the summer heat. Doth it fall, or doth it rise? Is it incense from the hill, Or bounty from the skies? Or is the face of earth that lies Languid, looking up on high, To the face of Heaven so nigh That their balmy breathings meet? Rain, rain, summer rain, On the wood and on the plain: Rain, rain, rain, until The tall wet trees no more athirst, As each chalice green doth fill, See the pigmy nations nurst Round their distant feet, and throw The nectar to the herbs below. The droughty herbs, without a sound, Drink it ere it reach the ground. Rain, rain, sweet warm rain, On the wood and on the plain, And round me like a dropping well, The great round drops they fell and fell. I say not War is good or ill; Perchance they may slay, if they will, Who killing love, and loving kill. I do not join yon captive's din; Some man among us without sin Perhaps may rightly lock him in. I do not grant the Tyrant's plea; The slaves potential to be free Already are the Powers that be. Whether our bloodsheds flow or cease, I know that as the years increase, The flower of all is human peace. ‘The Flower.’ Vertumnus hath repute O'er Flora; yet methinks the fruit But alter ego of the root; And that which serves our fleshly need, Subserves the blossom that doth feed The soul which is the life indeed. Nor well he deems who deems the rose Is for the roseberry, nor knows The roseberry is for the rose. And Autumn's garnered treasury, But prudent Nature's guarantee That Summer evermore shall be, And yearly, once a year, complete That top and culmen exquisite Whereto the slanting seasons meet. Whether our bloodsheds flow or cease, I know that, as the years increase, The flower of all is human peace. ‘The flower.’ Yet whether shall we sow A blossom or a seed? I know The flower will rot, the seed will grow. By this the rain had ceased, and I went forth From that Dodona green of oak and beech. But ere my steps could reach The hamlet, I beheld along the verge A flight of fleeing cloudlets that did urge Unequal speed, as when a herd is driven By the recurring pulse of shoutings loud. I saw; but held the omen of no worth. For by the footway not a darnel stirred, And still the noon slept on, nor even a bird Moved the dull air; but, at each silent hand, Upon the steaming land The hare lay basking, and the budded wheat Hung slumberous heads of sleep. Then I was 'ware that a great northern cloud Moved slowly to the centre of the heaven. His white head was so high That the great blue fell round him like the wide And ermined robe of kings. He sat in pride Lonely and cold; but methought when he spied From that severe inhospitable height The distant dear delight, The meiting world with summer at her side, His pale brow mellowed with a mournful light, And like a marble god he wept his stony tears. The loyal clouds that sit about his feet, All in their courtier kinds, Do weep to see him weep. After the priceless drops the sycophant winds Leap headlong down, and chase, and swirl, and sweep Beneath the royal grief that scarce may reach the ground. To see their whirling zeal, Unlikely things that in the kennel lie Begin to wheel and wheel; The wild tarantula-will spreads far and nigh, And spinning straws go spiral to the sky, And leaves long dead leap up and dance their ghastly round. And so it happened in the street 'Neath a broad eave I stood and mused again, And all the arrows of the driving rain Were tipped with slanting sleet. I mused beneath the straw pent of the bricked And sodded cot, with damp moss mouldered o'er, The bristled thatch gleamed with a carcanet, And from the inner eaves the reeking wet Dripped; dropping more And more, as more the sappy roof was sapped, And wept a mirkier wash that splashed and clapped The plain-stones, dribbling to the flooded door. A plopping pool of droppings stood before, Worn by a weeping age in rock of easy grain. O'erhead, hard by, a pointed beam o'erlapped, And from its jewelled tip The slipping slipping drip Did whip the fillipped pool whose hopping plashes ticked. Let one or thousands loose or bind, That land's enslaved whose sovran mind Collides the conscience of mankind. And free—whoever holds the rood— Where Might in Right, and Power in Good, Flow each in each, like life in blood. The age has broken from his kings! Stop him! Behold his feet have wings. Upon his back the hero springs. Tho' Jack's horse run away with Jack, Who knows, while Jack keeps on his back, If Jack rule him or he rule Jack? Cuckoo takes the mud away! True the sun doth shine all day; Cuckoo takes the mud away. Who sneers at heirloom rank? God knows Each man that lives, each flower that blows. There may be lords—and a blue rose. Even to the sod whereon you prate This land is ours. Do you debate How we shall manage our estate? Norman, War granted you your lease: The very countersign of Peace Shows the first Lessor can release. Therefore altho' you cannot guide, Be wise; and spare the almighty pride Of that mild monster that you ride. If England's head and heart were one, Where is that good beneath the sun Her noble hands should leave undone! Small unit, hast thou hardiness To bid mankind to battle? Yes. The worm will rout them, and is less. The world assaults? Nor fight nor fly. Stand in some steadfast truth, and eye The stubborn siege grow old and die. My army is manking. My foe The very meanest truth I know. Shall I come back a conqueror? No. Wouldst light? See Phosphor shines confest, Turn thy broad back upon the west; Stand firm. The world will do the rest. Stand firm. Unless thy strength can climb Yon alp, and from that height sublime See, ere we see, the advancing time. Act for to-day? Friend, this ‘to-day’ Washed Adam's feet and streams away Far into yon Eternity. Build as men steer, by chart and pole; Care for each stone as each were sole, Yet lay it conscious of the whole. Sow with the signs. The wise man heeds The seasons. Capricornus feeds Upon the sluggard's winter seeds. Each enterprise, or small or great, Hath its own touchhole; watch and wait, Find that and fire the loaded fate. Do in few acts whate'er thou dost; Let thy oe play to his own cost, Who moves the oftenest errs the most. Choose arms from Nature's armouries, Plagues, conflagrations, storms, and seas, For God is surety for all these. Our town is threatened by a bear, We've manned the thresholds far and near, Fools! send five men to kill the bear. Do good to him that hates thee. Good, Still good. By physic or by food? By letting or by stanching blood? Do as thou wouldst be done by. See What it were well he did to thee, He pure as thou, thou foul as he. Lovest thou not Peace? Aye, moralist, Both Peace and thee. Yet well I wist They who shut Janus did slay Christ. IN WAR-TIME. A PRAYER OF THE UNDERSTANDING. Lo, this is night. Hast thou, oh sun, refused Thy countenance, or is thy golden arm Shortened, or from thy shining place in heaven Art thou put down and lost? Neither hast thou Refused thy constant face, nor is thine arm Shortened, nor from thy principality Art thou deposed, oh sun. Ours, ours, the sin, The sorrow. From thy steadfast noon we turned Into the eastern shade—and this is night. Yet so revolves the axle of the world, And by that brief aversion wheels us round To morn, and rolls us on the larger paths Of annual duty. Thou observant moon, That dancest round the seasonable earth As David round the ark, but half thy ring In process, yet, complete, the circular whole Promotes thee, and expedes thy right advance, And all thy great desire of summer signs. And thou, oh sun, our centre, who thyself Art satellite, and, conscious of the far Archelion, in obedience of free will And native duty, as the good man walks Among the children's faces, with thine house About thee, least and greatest, first and last, Makest of the blue eternal holiday Thy glad perambulation; and thou, far Archelion, feudatory still, of one Not sovran nor in fee of paramount power; Moons round your worlds, worlds round your suns, suns round Such satraps as in orderly degree Confess a lordlier regent and pervade A vaster cycle—ye, so moved, commoved, Revolving and convolving, turn the heavens Upon the pivot of that summery star, Centre of all we know: and thou, oh star, Centre of all we know, chief crown of crowns, Who art the one in all, the all in one, And seest the ordered whole—nought uninvolved But all involved to one direct result Of multiform volution—in one pomp, One power, one tune, one time, upon one path Move with thee moving, Thou, amid thy host Marchest—ah whither? ——Oh God, before Whom We marshal thus Thy legioned works to take The secret of Thy counsel, and array Congress and progress, and, with multitude As conquerors and to conquer, in consent Of universal law, approach Thy bound, Thine immemorial bound, and at Thy face Heaven and earth flee away; oh Thou Lord God, Whether oh absolute existence, Thou, The Maker, makest, and this fair we see Be but the mote and dust of that unseen Unsought unsearchable; or whether Thou Whose goings forth are from of old, around Thy going in mere effluence without care Breathest creation out into the cold Beyond Thee, and, within Thine ambient breath, So walkest everlasting as we walk The unportioned snows; or whether, meditating Eternity, self-centred, self-fulfilled, Self-continent, Thou thinkest and we live, A little while forgettest and we fade, Rememberest and we are, and this bright vision Wherein we move, nay all our total sum And story, be to Thee as to a man When in the drop and rising of a lid Lo the swift rack and fashion of a dream, No more; oh Thou inscrutable, whose ways Are not as ours, whose form we know not, voice Hear not, true work behold not, mystery Conceive not, who—as thunder shakes the world And rings a silver bell—hast sometime moved The tongue of man, but in Thy proper speech Wearest a human language on a word As limpets on a rock, who, as Eternal, Omnipotential, Infinite, Allwise, In measure of Thine operation hast No prime or term, in subject as in scheme No final end, in eidol as in act Nought but the perfect God; oh Thou Supreme, Inaudible, Invisible, Unknown, Thy will be done. A HERO'S GRAVE. O'er our evening fire the smoke is like a pall, And funeral banners hang about the arches of the hall, In the gable end I see a catafalque aloof, And night is drawn up like a curtain to the girders of the roof. Thou knowest why we silent sit, and why our eyes are dim, Sing us such proud sorrow as we may hear for him. Reach me the old harp that hangs between the flags he won, I will sing what once I heard beside the grave of such a son. My son, my son, A father's eyes are looking on thy grave, Dry eyes that look on this green mound and see The low weed blossom and the long grass wave, Without a single tear to them or thee, My son, my son. Why should I weep? The grass is grass, the weeds Are weeds. The emmet hath done thus ere now. I tear a leaf; the green blood that it bleeds Is cold. What have I here? Where, where, art thou, My son, my son? On which tall trembler shall the old man lean? Which chill leaf shall lap o'er him when he lies On that bed where in visions I have seen Thy filial love? or, when thy father dies, Tissue a fingered thorn to close his childless eyes? Aye, where art thou? Men tell me of a fame Walking the wondering nations; and they say, When thro' the shouting people thy great name Goes like a chief upon a battle-day, They shake the heavens with glory. Well-away! As some poor hound that thro' thronged street and square Pursues his loved lost lord, and fond and fast Seeks what he feels to be but feels not where, Tracks the dear feet to some closed door at last, And lies him down and lornest looks doth cast, So I, thro' all the long tumultuous days, Tracing thy footstep on the human sands, O'er the signed deserts and the vocal ways Pursue thee, faithful, thro' the echoing lands, Wearing a wandering staff with trembling hands: Thro' echoing lands that ring with victory, And answer for the living with the dead, And give me marble when I ask for bread, And give me glory when I ask for thee— It was not glory I nursed on my knee. And now, one stride behind thee, and too late, Yet true to all that reason cannot kill, I stand before the inexorable gate And see thy latest footstep on the sill, And know thou canst not come, but watch and wait thee still. ‘Old man!’—Ah, darest thou? yet thy look is kind, Didst thou, too, love him? ‘Thou grey-headed sire, Seest thou this path which from that grave doth wind Far thro' those western uplands higher and higher, Till, like a thread, it burns in the great fire ‘Of sunset? The wild sea and desert meet Eastward by yon unnavigable strand, Then wherefore hath the flow of human feet Left this dry runnel of memorial sand Meandering thro' the summer of the land? ‘See where the long immeasurable snake, Between dim hall and hamlet, tower and shed, Mountain and mountain, precipice and lake, Lies forth unfinished to this final head, This green dead mound of the unfading dead!’ Do they then come to weep thee? Do they kiss Thy relics? Art thou then as wholly gone As some old buried saint? My son, my son, Ah, could I mourn thee so! Such tears were bliss! ‘Old man, they do not mourn who weep at graves like this.’ They do not mourn? What! hath the insolent foe Found out my child's last bed? Who, who, are they That come and go about him? I cry, ‘Who?’ I am his father—I;—I cry ‘Who?’ ‘Aye, Gray trembler, I will tell thee who are they. ‘The slave who, having grown up strong and stark To the set season, feels at length he wears Bonds that will break, and thro' the slavish dark Shines with the light of liberated years, And still in chains doth weep a freeman's tears. ‘The patriot, while the unebbed force that hurled His tyrant throbs within his bursting veins, And, on the ruins of a hundred reigns, That ancient heaven of brass, so long unfurled, Falls with a crash of fame that fills the world, And thro' the clangor lo the unwonted strains Of peace, and, in the new sweet heavens upcurled, The sudden incense of a thousand plains. ‘Youth whom some mighty flash from heaven hath turned In his dark highway, and who runs forth, shod With flame, into the wilderness untrod, And as he runs his heart of flint is burned, And in that glass he sees the face of God, And falls upon his knees—and morn is all abroad. ‘Age who hath heard amid his cloistered ground The cheer of youth, and steps from echoing aisles, And at a sight the great blood with a bound Melts his brow's winter, which the free sun smiles To jewels, and he stands a young man crowned With glittering years among a young world shouting round. ‘Girls that do blush and tremble with delight On the St. John's eve of their maidenhood; When the unsummered woman in her blood Glows through the Parian maid, and at the sight The flushing virgin weeps and feels herself too bright. ‘He who first feels the world-old destiny, The shaft of gold that strikes the poet still, And slowly in its victim melts away, Who knows his wounds will heal but when they kill, And drop by vital drop doth bleed his golden ill. ‘All whom the everpassing mysteries Have rapt above the region of our race, And, blinded by the glory and the grace, Break from the ecstatic sphere—as he who dies In darkness, and in heaven's own light doth rise, Dazed with the untried glory of the place Looks up and sees some well-remembered face, And thro' the invulnerable angels flies To that dear human breast and hides his dazzled eyes. ‘All who, like the sun-ripened seed that springs And bourgeons in the sun, do hold profound An antenatal stature, which the round Of the dull continent flesh hath cribbed and wound Into this kernelled man; but having found Such soil as grew them, burst in blossomings Not native here, or, from the hallowed ground, Tower their slow height, and spread, like sheltering wings, Those boughs wherein the bird of omen sings High as the palms of heaven, while to the sound Lo kingdoms jocund in the sacred bound Till the world's summer fills her moon, and brings The final fruit which is the feast and fate of kings. ‘And darest thou mourn? Thy bones are left behind, But where art thou, Anchises? Dost thou see Him who once bare the slow paternity, Foot-burnt o'er stony Troy? So, thou, reclined Goest thro' the falling years. Here, here where we Two stand, lies deep the flesh thou hast so pined To clasp, and shalt clasp never. Verily, Love and the worm are often of one mind! God save them from election! Pity thee? True he lifts not thy load, but he hath signed And at his beck a nation rose up free; Thy wounds his living love may never bind, But at the dead man's touch posterity Is healed. To thee, thou poor, and halt, and blind, He is a staff no more: but times to be Lean on his monumental memory As the moon on a mountain. Thou shalt find A silent home, a cheerless hearth: but he Shall be a fire which the enkindling wind, Blowing for ever from eternity, Fans till its universal blaze hath shined The yule of thankful ages. Pity thee? A son is lost to thine infirmity; Poor fool, what then? A son thou hast resigned To give a father to the virtues of mankind.’ IN WAR-TIME. AN ASPIRATION OF THE SPIRIT. Lord Jesus, as a little child, Upon some high ascension day When a great people goes to pay Allegiance, and the tumult wild Roars by its thousand streets, and fills The billowy nation on the plain, As roar into the heaving main A thousand torrents from the hills, Caught in the current of the throng Is drawn beneath the closing crowd, And, drowning in the human flood, Is whirled in its dark depths along; And low under the ruthless feet, Or high as to the awful knees Of giants that he partly sees, Blinded with fear and faint with heat, Mindless of all but what doth seem, And shut out from the upper light, Maddens within a monstrous night Of limbs that crush him like a dream; And when his strength no more can stand, And while he sinks in his last swound, Is lifted from the deadly ground, And led by a resistless hand, And thro' the opening agony Goes on and knows not where, beside The mastery of his guardian guide, Goes on, and knows not where nor why, Till, when the sky no more is hid, Between the rocking heads he sees A mount that rises by degrees Above them like a pyramid, And on the summit of the mount A vacant throne, and round the throne Bright-vestured princes, zone by zone, In circles that he cannot count. And feels, at length, a slanting way, And labours by his guardian good Till forth, as from a lessening wood, They step into the dazzling day, And from the mount he sees below The maivel of the marshalled plain, And what was tumult is a reign, And, as he climbs, the princes know His guide, and fall about his feet, Before his face the courtiers fall, And lo! it is the Lord of all, And on his throne he takes his seat; And, while strong fears transfix the boy, The mighty people far and near Throw up upon the eye and ear The flash and thunder of their joy, And, round the royal flag unfurled, In sequent love and circling awe The legions lead their living law, And what was Chaos is a World: So, Lord, Thou seest this mortal me, Deep in Titanic days that press Incessant from unknown access To issues that I cannot see. Caught in the current stern and strong I sink beneath the closing crowd, And drowning in the awful flood Am whirled in its dark depths along, Struggling with shows so thronged and thrust On these wide eyes which bruise and burn, And flash with half-seen sights, or turn To that worse darkness thick with dust, That mindful of but what doth seem, And hopeless of the upper light, I madden in a monstrous night Of shapes that crush me like a dream. Then when my strength no more can stand, And while I sink in my last swound, Lo! I am lifted from the ground, And led by a resistless hand; And thro' the opening agony Go on and know not where, beside The mastery of my guardian guide, Go on, and know not where or why; Nor, tho' I cannot see Thy brow, Distrust the hand I feel so dear, Nor question how Thou wert so near, Nor ask Thee whither goest Thou, Nor whence Thy footsteps first began. Whence, Lord, Thou knowest: whither, Lord, Thou knowest: how Thou knowest. Oh Word That can be touched, oh Spoken Man, Enough, enough, if Thou wilt lead, To know Thou knowest: enough to know That darkling at Thy side I go, And this strong hand is Thine indeed. Yet by that side, unspent, untrod, Oh let me, clinging still to Thee, Between the swaying wonders see The throne upon the mount of God. And—tho' they close before mine eye, And all my course is choked and shut— Feel Time grow steeper under foot, And know the final height is nigh. And as one sees, thro' cambered straits Of forests, on his forward way, Horizons green of coloured day, Oh let me thro' the crowding Fates Behold the light of skies unseen, Till on that sudden Capitol I step forth to the sight of all That is, and shall be, and hath been, And Thou, O King, shalt take Thine own Triumphant; and, Thy place fulfilled, The flaw of Nature shall be healed, And joyous round Thy central throne I see the vocal ages roll, And all the human universe Like some great symphony rehearse The order of its perfect whole; And seek in vain where once I fell, Nor know the anarchy I knew In those congenial motions due Of this great work where all is well, And smile, with dazzled wisdom dumb, —Remembering all I said and sung— That man asks more of mortal tongue Than skill to say, ‘Thy kingdom come.’ HOME, WOUNDED. Wheel me into the sunshine, Wheel me into the shadow, There must be leaves on the woodbine, Is the king-cup crowned in the meadow? Wheel me down to the meadow, Down to the little river, In sun or in shadow I shall not dazzle or shiver, I shall be happy anywhere, Every breath of the morning air Makes me throb and quiver. Stay wherever you will, By the mount or under the hill, Or down by the little river: Stay as long as you please, Give me only a bud from the trees, Or a blade of grass in morning dew, Or a cloudy violet clearing to blue, I could look on it for ever. Wheel, wheel thro' the sunshine, Wheel, wheel thro' the shadow; There must be odours round the pine, There must be balm of breathing kine. Somewhere down in the meadow. Must I choose? Then anchor me there Beyond the beckoning poplars, where The larch is snooding her flowery hair With wreaths of morning shadow. Among the thicket hazels of the brake Perchance some nightingale doth shake His feathers, and the air is full of song; In those old days when I was young and strong, He used to sing on yonder garden tree, Beside the nursery. Ah. I remember how I loved to wake, And find him singing on the self-same bough (I know it even now) Where, since the flit of bat, In ceaseless voice he sat, Trying the spring night over, like a tune, Beneath the vernal moon; And while I listed long, Day rose, and still he sang, And all his stanchless song, As something falling unaware, Fell out of the tall trees he sang among, Fell ringing down the ringing morn, and rang— Rang like a golden jewel down a golden stair. Is it too early? I hope not. But wheel me to the ancient oak, On this side of the meadow; Let me hear the raven's croak Loosened to an amorous note In the hollow shadow. Let me see the winter snake Thawing all his frozen rings On the bank where the wren sings. Let me hear the little bell, Where the red-wing, top-mast high, Looks toward the northern sky, And jangles his farewell. Let us rest by the ancient oak, And see his net of shadow, His net of barren shadow, Like those wrestlers' nets of old, Hold the winter dead and cold, Hoary winter, white and cold, While all is green in the meadow. And when you've rested, brother mine, Take me over the meadow; Take me along the level crown Of the bare and silent down, And stop by the ruined tower. On its green scarp, by and by, I shall smell the flowering thyme, On its wall the wall-flower. In the tower there used to be A solitary tree. Take me there, for the dear sake Of those old days wherein I loved to lie And pull the melilote, And look across the valley to the sky, And hear the joy that filled the warm wide hour Bubble from the thrush's throat, As into a shining mere Rills some rillet trebling clear, And speaks the silent silver of the lake. There mid cloistering tree-roots, year by year, The hen-thrush sat, and he, her lief and dear, Among the boughs did make A ceaseless music of her married time, And all the ancient stones grew sweet to hear, And answered him in the unspoken rhyme Of gracious forms most musical That tremble on the wall And trim its age with airy fantasies That flicker in the sun, and hardly seem As if to be beheld were all, And only to our eyes They rise and all, And fall and rise, Sink down like silence, or a-sudden stream As wind-blown on the wind as streams a wedding-chime. But you are wheeling me while I dream, And we've almost reached the meadow! You may wheel me fast thro' the sunshine, You may wheel me fast thro' the shadow, But wheel me slowly, brother mine, Thro' the green of the sappy meadow; For the sun, these days have been so fine, Must have touched it over with celandine, And the southern hawthorn, I divine, Sheds a muffled shadow. There blows The first primrose, Under the bare bank roses: There is but one, And the bank is brown, But soon the children will come down, The ringing children come singing down, To pick their Easter posies, And they'll spy it out, my beautiful, Among the bare brier-roses; And when I sit here again alone, The bare brown bank will be blind and dull, Alas for Easter posies! But when the din is over and gone, Like an eye that opens after pain, I shall see my pale flower shining again; Like a fair star after a gust of rain I shall see my pale flower shining again; Like a glow-worm after the rolling wain Hath shaken darkness down the lane I shall see my pale flower shining again; And it will blow here for two months more, And it will blow here again next year, And the year past that, and the year beyond; And thro' all the years till my years are o'er I shall always find it here. Shining across from the bank above, Shining up from the pond below, Ere a water-fly wimple the silent pond, Or the first green weed appear. And I shall sit here under the tree, And as each slow bud uncloses, I shall see it brighten and brighten to me, From among the leafing brier-roses, The leaning leafing roses, As at eve the leafing shadows grow, And the star of light and love Draweth near o'er her airy glades, Draweth near thro' her heavenly shades, As a maid thro' a myrtle grove. And the flowers will multiply, As the stars come blossoming over the sky, The bank will blossom, the waters blow, Till the singing children hitherward hie To gather May-day posies; And the bank will be bare wherever they go, As dawn, the primrose-girl, goes by, And alas for heaven's primroses! Blare the trumpet, and boom the gun, But, oh, to sit here thus in the sun, To sit here, feeling my work is done, While the sands of life so golden run, And I watch the children's posies, And my idle heart is whispering ‘Bring whatever the years may bring, The flowers will blossom, the birds will sing, And there'll always be primroses.’ Looking before me here in the sun, I see the Aprils one after one, Primrosed Aprils one by one, Primrosed Aprils on and on, Till the floating prospect closes In golden glimmers that rise and rise, And perhaps are gleams of Paradise, And perhaps—too far for mortal eyes— New years of fresh primroses, Years of earth's primroses, Springs to be, and springs for me Of distant dim primroses. My soul lies out like a basking hound, A hound that dreams and dozes; Along my life my length I lay, I fill to-morrow and yesterday, I am warm with the suns that have long since set, I am warm with the summers that are not yet, And like one who dreams and dozes Softly afloat on a sunny sea, Two worlds are whispering over me, And there blows a wind of roses From the backward shore to the shore before, From the shore before to the backward shore, And like two clouds that meet and pour Each thro' each, till core in core A single self reposes, The nevermore with the evermore Above me mingles and closes; As my soul lies out like the basking hound, And wherever it lies seems happy ground, And when, awakened by some sweet sound, A dreamy eye uncloses, I see a blooming world around, And I lie amid primroses— Years of sweet primroses, Springs of fresh primroses, Springs to be, and springs for me Of distant dim primroses. Oh to lie a-dream, a-dream, To feel I may dream and to know you deem My work is done for ever, And the palpitating fever That gains and loses, loses and gains, And beats the hurrying blood on the brunt of a thousand pains Cooled at once by that blood-let Upon the parapet; And all the tedious taskèd toil of the difficult long endeavour Solved and quit by no more fine Than these limbs of mine, Spanned and measured once for all By that right hand I lost, Bought up at so light a cost As one bloody fall On the soldier's bed, And three days on the ruined wall Among the thirstless dead. Oh to think my name is crost From duty's muster-roll; That I may slumber tho' the clarion call, And live the joy of an embodied soul Free as a liberated ghost. Oh to feel a life of deed Was emptied out to feed That fire of pain that burned so brief a while— That fire from which I come, as the dead come Forth from the irreparable tomb, Or as a martyr on his funeral pile Heaps up the burdens other men do bear Thro' years of segregated care, And takes the total load Upon his shoulders broad, And steps from earth to God. Oh to think, thro' good or ill, Whatever I am you'll love me still; Oh to think, tho' dull I be, You that are so grand and free, You that are so bright and gay, Will pause to hear me when I will, As tho' my head were gray; And tho' there's little I can say, Each will look kind with honour while he hears. And to your loving ears My thoughts will halt with honourable scars, And when my dark voice stumbles with the weight Of what it doth relate (Like that blind comrade—blinded in the wars— Who bore the one-eyed brother that was lame), You'll remember 'tis the same That cried ‘Follow me,’ Upon a summer's day; And I shall understand with unshed tears This great reverence that I see, And bless the day—and Thee, Lord God of victory! And she, Perhaps oh even she May look as she looked when I knew her In those old days of childish sooth, Ere my boyhood dared to woo her. I will not seek nor sue her, For I'm neither fonder nor truer Than when she slighted my love-lorn youth, My giftless, graceless, guinealess truth, And I only lived to rue her. But I'll never love another, And, in spite of her lovers and lands, She shall love me yet, my brother! As a child that holds by his mother, While his mother speaks his praises, Holds with eager hands, And ruddy and silent stands In the ruddy and silent daisies, And hears her bless her boy, And lifts a wondering joy, So I'll not seek nor sue her, But I'll leave my glory to woo her, And I'll stand like a child beside, And from behind the purple pride I'll lift my eyes unto her, And I shall not be denied. And you will love her, brother dear, And perhaps next year you'll bring me here All thro' the balmy April-tide, And she will trip like spring by my side, And be all the birds to my ear. And here all three we'll sit in the sun, And see the Aprils one by one, Primrosed Aprils on and on, Till the floating prospect closes In golden glimmers that rise and rise, And perhaps, are gleams of Paradise, And perhaps, too far for mortal eyes, New springs of fresh primroses, Springs of earth's primroses, Springs to be and springs for me, Of distant dim primroses. A NUPTIAL EVE. Oh, happy, happy maid, In the year of war and death She wears no sorrow! By her face so young and fair, By the happy wreath That rules her happy hair, She might be a bride to-morrow! She sits and sings within her moonlit bower, Her moonlit bower in rosy June, Yet ah, her bridal breath, Like fragrance from some sweet night-blowing flower, Moves from her moving lips in many a mournful tune! She sings no song of love's despair, She sings no lover lowly laid, No fond peculiar grief Has ever touched or bud or leaf Of her unblighted spring. She sings because she needs must sing; She sings the sorrow of the air Whereof her voice is made. That night in Britain howsoe'er On any chords the fingers strayed They gave the notes of care. A dim sad legend old Long since in some pale shade Of some far twilight told, She knows not when or where, She sings, with trembling hand on trembling lute-strings laid:— The murmur of the mourning ghost That keeps the shadowy kine, ‘Oh, Keith of Ravelston, The sorrows of thy line!’ Ravelston, Ravelston, The merry path that leads Down the golden morning hill, And thro' the silver meads; Ravelston, Ravelston, The stile beneath the tree, The maid that kept her mother's kine, The song that sang she! She sang her song, she kept her kine, She sat beneath the thorn When Andrew Keith of Ravelston Rode thro' the Monday morn, His henchmen sing, his hawk-bells ring, His belted jewels shine! Oh, Keith of Ravelston, The sorrows of thy line! Year after year, where Andrew came, Comes evening down the glade, And still there sits a moonshine ghost Where sat the sunshine maid. Her misty hair is faint and fair, She keeps the shadowy kine; Oh, Keith of Ravelston, The sorrows of thy line! I lay my hand upon the stile, The stile is lone and cold, The burnie that goes babbling by Says nought that can be told. Yet, stranger! here, from year to year, She keeps her shadowy kine; Oh, Keith of Ravelston, The sorrows of thy line! Step out three steps, where Andrew stood— Why blanch thy cheeks for fear? The ancient stile is not alone, Tis not the burn I hear! She makes her immemorial moan, She keeps her shadowy kine; Oh, Keith of Ravelston, The sorrows of thy line! THE MOTHER'S LESSON. Come hither an' sit on my knee, Willie, Come hither an' sit on my knee, An' list while I tell how your brave brither fell, Fechtin' for you an' for me: Fechtin' for you an' for me, Willie, Wi' his guid sword in his han'. Hech, but ye'll be a brave man, Willie, Hech, but ye'll be a brave man! Ye min' o' your ain brither dear, Willie, Ye min' o' your ain brither dear, How he pettled ye aye wi' his pliskies an' play, An' was aye sae cantie o' cheer: Aye sae cantie o' cheer, Willie, As he steppit sae tall an' sae gran', Hech, but ye'll be a brave man, Willie, Hech, but ye'll be a brave man. D'ye min' when the bull had ye doun, Willie, D'ye min' when the bull had ye doun? D'ye min' wha grippit ye fra the big bull, D'ye min' o' his muckle red woun'? D'ye min' o' his muckle red woun', Willie, D'ye min' how the bluid doun ran? Hech, but ye'll be a brave man, Willie, Hech, but ye'll be a brave man. D'ye min' when we a' wanted bread, Willie, the year when we a' wanted bread? How he smiled when he saw the het parritch an' a', An' gaed cauld an' toom to his bed: Gaed awa' toom to his bed, Willie, For the love o' wee Willie an' Nan? Hech, but ye'll be a brave man, Willie, Hech, but ye'll be a brave man! Next simmer was bright but an' ben, Willie, Next simmer was bright but an' ben, When there cam a gran' cry like a win' strang an' high By loch, an' mountain, an' glen: By loch, an' mountain, an' glen, Willie, The cry o' a far forrin lan', An' up loupit ilka brave man, Willie, Up loupit ilka brave man. For the voice cam saying, ‘Wha 'll gang?’ Willie, The voice cam saying, ‘Wha'll gang To fecht owre the sea that the slave may be free, An’ the weak be safe fra' the strang?' The weak be safe fra' the strang, Willie; Rab looked on Willie an' Nan, An' hech, but he was a brave man, Willie, Hech, but he was a brave man! I kent by his een he was gaun, Willie, I kent by his een he was gaun, An' he rose like a chief: twice we spak in our grief— ‘Dinna gang!’ ‘My mither, I maun!’ When he said, ‘My mither, I maun,’ Willie, I gied him his sword to his han'. Hech, but ye'll be a brave man, Willie, Hech, but ye'll be a brave man! An' sae it happened afar, Willie, Sae it happened afar, In the dead midnight there rose a great fecht, An' Rab was first i' the war: First i' the haur o' the war, Willie, Wi' his guid sword in his han'! Hech, but ye'll be a brave man, Willie, Hech, but ye'll be a brave man! An' there cam' a dark wicked lord, Willie, There cam' a dark wicked lord, An' oh my guid God! on my bauld bairn he rode, An' smote him wi' his sword: Smote him wi' his sword, Willie, But Rab had his guid sword in han'! Hech, but ye'll be a brave man, Willie, Hech, but ye'll be a brave man! He rushed on the fae in his might, Willie, In his might to the fecht thro' the night, An' he grippit him grim, an' the fae grippit him, An' they rolled owre i' the fecht: They rolled owre i' the fecht, Willie, Rab wi' his guid sword in han'! Hech, but ye'll be a brave man, Willie, Hech, but ye'll be a brave man! When the gran' stowre cleared awa', Willie, When the gran' stowre cleared awa', An' the mornin' drew near in chitter an' in fear, Still, still, in death they lay twa: Still, still, in death they lay twa, Willie, Rab wi' his guid sword in han'! Hech, but ye'll be a brave man, Willie, Hech, but ye'll be a brave man. Then up fra the death-sod they bore him, Willie, The young men an' maidens they bore him, An' they mak the rocks ring 'gin my bairn were a king, An' a' the sweet lassies greet owre him: A' the sweet lassies greet owre him, Willie, An' their proud lips kiss his cauld han', Hech, but ye'll be a brave man, Willie, Hech, but ye'll be a brave man. An' they big him a green grass grave, Willie, They big him a green grass grave, My ain lad! my ain! an' they write on the stane, ‘Wha wad na sleep wi' the brave?’ An' wha wad na sleep wi' the brave, Willie? Wha wad na dee for his lan'? Hech, but ye'll be a brave man, Willie, Hech, but ye'll be a brave man! Noo come to yon press wi' me, Willie, Come to yon press wi' me, And I'll show ye somethin' o' auld lang syne, When he was a bairnie like thee: When he was a bairnie like thee, Willie, And stood at my knee where ye stan', Hech, but ye'll be a brave man, Willie, Hech, but ye'll be a brave man. D'ye see this wee bit bannet, Willie, —I min' weel the day it was new— See how I haud it here to my heart, His wee bit bannet o' blue: His wee bit bannet o' blue, Willie, Wi' its wee bit cockie an' ban'! Hech, but ye'll be a brave man, Willie, Hech, but ye'll be a brave man. D'ye see his ba' and his stickie, Willie, When he played at the ba'; Na, na, ye 're no to tak it in han', Ye 're no sae brave an' sae braw! But gin ye grow braw an' brave, Willie, Aiblins I'se gie 't to your han', Hech, but ye'll be a brave man, Willie, Hech, but ye'll be a brave man. An' this was his Guid Buik, Willie, The Guid Buik that he lo'ed, Where he read the Word o' the great guid Lord Wha bought us wi' His bluid. An' will we spare our bluid, Willie, To buy the dear auld lan'? Hech, but ye'll be a brave man, Willie, Hech, but ye'll be a brave man. They say he's dead an' gane, Willie, They say he's dead and gane. Wad God my bairnies a' were sons, That ten might gang for ane: Ten might gang for ane, Willie, To save the dear auld lan'! Hech, but ye'll be a brave man, Willie, Hech, but ye'll be a brave man. I'd no be lorn an' lane, Willie, I'd no be lorn an' lane, For gin I had him here by the han' He could na be mair my ain: He'd no be mair my ain, Willie, Gin I grippit him by the han'! Hech, but ye'll be a brave man, Willie, Hech, but ye'll be a brave man. An' oh! gin ye gang fra me, Willie, Gin ye gang as he gaed fra me, Ye'll aye be still as near to my heart As the noo when ye sit on my knee: As the noo when ye sit on my knee, Willie, An' I haud ye by the han'. Hech, but ye'll be a brave man, Willie, Hech, but ye'll be a brave man. ‘An' wad ye no greet at a', mither? Wad ye no greet at a'?’ Aye, wad I greet my bonnie bonnie bairn! ‘An' will ye no greet when I fa'?’ Will I no greet when ye fa', Willie? God bless your bonnie wee han'! Hech, but ye'll be a brave man, Willie, I kent weel ye'd be a brave man! Aye, will I greet day an' night, Willie, Aye, will I greet day an' night! But gin ye can see fra your heaven doun to me, Ye'se no be wae at the sight: Ye'se no be wae at the sight, Willie, E'en in your bright blessed lan'! Hech, but ye'll be a brave man, Willie, I kent weel ye'd be a brave man. Ye ken how I greet sae sair, Willie, Ye ken how I greet sae sair, When ye're no my ain guid bairnie the day, An' my een are cloudy wi' care: My een are cloudy wi' care, Willie, An' I lean doun my head on my han', An' think ‘Will ye be a guid man, Willie, Ah, will ye grow a guid man?’ Ye ken when I did na greet sae, Willie, Ye ken when I did na greet sae! Gran' gran' are a proud mither's tears, An' the gate that she gangs in her wae: The gate that she gangs in her wae, Willie, Wi' her foot on her ain proud lan'! Hech, but ye'll be a brave man, Willie, Hech, but ye'll be a brave man. Ye min' how ye saw me greet, Willie, Ye min' how ye saw me greet, When the great news cam' to the toun at e'en, An' we heard the shout in the street: We heard the shout in the street, Willie, An' the death-word it rode an' it ran. Hech, but ye'll be a brave man, Willie, Hech, but ye'll be a brave man. Ye min' how I lift up mine ee', Willie, Ye min' how I lift up mine ee', An' smiled as I smile when I stan' i' the door, An see ye come toddlin' to me: See ye come toddlin' to me, Willie, An' smile afar off where I stan'. Hech, but ye'll be a brave man, Willie, Hech, but ye'll be a brave man. Thank God for ilk tear I let fa', Willie, Thank God for ilk tear I let fa', For oh, where they wipe awa' tears fra' a' een, Sic tears they wad no wipe awa': Sic tears they wad no wipe awa', Willie, Tho' there's nane may be sad i' that lan'! Hech, but ye'll be a brave man, Willie, Hech, but ye'll be a brave man. Noo to your play ye maun gang, Willie, Noo to your play ye maun gang, An' belyve, my ain wee, ye'll come back to my knee, And I'se sing ye an auld Scots sang: I'se sing ye an auld Scots sang, Willie, A sang o' the dear auld lan'! Hech, but ye'll be a brave man, Willie, Hech, but ye'll be a brave man. An' aye d'ye min' what I say, Willie, What ye heard your auld mither say, Better to dee a brave man an' free, Than to live a fause coward for aye: Than to live a fause coward for aye, Willie, An' stan' by the shame o' your lan'! Hech, but ye'll be a brave man, Willie, Hech, but ye'll be a brave man. It's brave to be first at the schule, It's brave to be cock o' the class, It's brave to thwack a strang fule, It's brave to win a wee lass, It's brave to be first wi' the pleugh, An' first i' the reel an' strathspey, An' first at the tod i' the cleugh, An' first at the stag at bay. It's brave to be laird o' the glen, It's brave to be chief o' the clan, But he that can dree for his neebor to dee, Oh, he's the true brave man: He's the true brave man, Willie, An' the fame o' his name sall be gran'! Hech, but ye'll be a brave man, Willie, Hech, but ye'll be a brave man. ALONE. There came to me softly a small wind from the sea. And it lifted a curl as it passed by me. But I sang sorrow and ho the heavy day! And I sang heigho and well-away! Again there came softly a small wind from the sea, And it lifted a curl as it passed by me. And still I sang sorrow and ho the heavy day! And I sang heigho and well-away! Once more there came softly that small wind from the sea, And it lifted a curl as it passed by me. I hushed my song of sorrow and ho the heavy day, And I hushed my heigho and well-away. Then, when I was silent, that small wind from the sea, It came the fourth time tenderly to me; To me, to me, Sitting by the sea, Sitting sad and solitary thinking of thee. Like warm lips it touched me—that soft wind from the sea, And I trembled and wept as it passed by me. FAREWELL. Hear me, hear me, now! By this heaven less pure than thou, Fare thee well! By this living light Less bright, Fare thee well! By the boundless sea Of mine agony, Fare thee well! That unfathomed sea Which must roll from me to thee, Must roll from thee to me, Fare thee well! By the tears that I have bled for thee, Farewell! By the life's-blood I will shed for thee, Farewell! By that field of death and fear Where I'll fight with sword and spear The fight I'm fighting here, Fare thee well! By a form amid the storm, Fare thee well! By a sigh above the cry, Fare thee well! By the war-cloud and the shout That shall wrap me round about, But can never shut thee out, Fare thee well! By the wild and bloody close, When I loose this hell of woes, And these fires shall eat our foes, Fare thee well! By all thou'lt not forget, Fare thee well! By the joy when first we met, Fare thee well! By the mighty love and pain Of the frantic arms that strain What they ne'er shall clasp again Fare thee well! By the bliss of our first kiss, Fare thee well! By the locked love of our last, Till a passion like a blast Tore the future from the past, Fare thee well! By the nights that I shall weep for thee, Farewell! By the vigils I shall keep for thee, Farewell! By the memories that will beam of thee, Farewell! By the dreams that I shall dream of thee, Farewell! By the passion when I wake Of this heart that will not break, That can bleed but cannot break, Fare thee well! By that holier woe of thine, Fare thee well! By thy love more pure than mine, Fare thee well! By the days thou shalt hold dear for me. The lone life thou shalt bear for me, The grey hairs thou shalt wear for me, Farewell! By thy good deeds offered up for me, Farewell! When thou fillest the wanderer's cup for me, Farewell! When thou givest the hungry bread for me, Farewell! When thou watchest by the dead for me, Farewell! By the faith of thy pure eyes, By the hopes that shall arise Day and night to the deaf skies, Fare thee well! By that faith I cannot share, Fare thee well! By this hopeless heart's despair, Fare thee well! By the days I have been glad for thee, The years I shall be sad for thee, The hours I shall be mad for thee, Farewell! SLEEPING AND WAKING. I Had a dream—I lay upon thy breast, In that sweet place where we lay long ago: I thought the morning woodbine to and fro With playful shadows whipped away my rest, And in my sleep I cried to thee, too blest, ‘Rise, oh my love, the morning sun is bright, Let us arise, oh love, let us arise; The flowers awake, the lark is in the skies, I will array myself in my delight, And we will—’ and I woke to death and night! ‘HE LOVES AND HE RIDES AWAY.’ 'Twas in that island summer where They spin the morning gossamer, And weave the evening mist, That, underneath the hawthorn-tree, I loved my love, and my love loved me, And there we lay and kissed, And saw the happy ships upon the yielding sea. Soft my heart, and warm his wooing, What we did seemed, while 'twas doing, Beautiful and wise; Wiser, fairer, more in tune, Than all else in that sweet June, And sinless as the skies That warmed the willing earth thro' all the languid noon. Ah that fatal spell! Ere the evening fell I fled away to hide my frightened face, And cried that I was born, And sobbed with love and scorn, And in the darkness sought a darker place, And blushed, and wept, and blushed, and dared not think of morn. Day and night, day and night, And I saw no light, Night and day, night and day, And in my woe I lay And dreamed the dreams they dream who cannot sleep: My speech was withered, and I could not pray; My tears were frozen, and I could not weep. I saw the hawthorn rise Between me and the skies, I felt the shadow was from pole to pole, I felt the leaves were shed, I felt the birds were dead, And on the earth I snowed the winter of my soul. Like to the hare wide eyed, That with her throbbing side Pressed to the rock awaits the coming cry, In my despair I sate And waited for my fate; And as the hunted hare returns to die, And with her latest breath Regains her native heath, So, when I heard the feet of destiny Near and more near, and caught the yelp of death, Toward the sounding sea, Toward my hawthorn-tree, Under the ignorant stars I darkly crept: ‘There,’ I said, ‘they'll find me dead, Lying within my maidenhead.’ And at my own unwonted voice, I wept; And for my great heart-ache, Within a little brake I lay me weary down and weary slept, Nor ever oped mine eyes till morn had left the lake. Her morning bath was o'er, And on the golden shore She stood like Flora with her floral train, And all her track was seen Among the watery sheen, That blushed, and wished, and blushing wished again, And parted still, and closed, with pleasure that had been. Oh the happy isle, The universal smile That met, as love meets love, the smile of day, And touched and lit delight Within the common light, Till all the joy of life was ecstacy, And morn's wild maids ran each her flowery way, And shook her dripping locks o'er hill, and dale, and lea! ‘At least,’ I said, ‘my tree is sear and blight, My tree, my hawthorn-tree!’ With downcast eyes of fear I drew me near and near, Dazed with the dewy glory of the hour, Till under-foot I see A flower too dear to me: I pause, and raise my full eyes from the flower, And lo! my hawthorn-tree! As a white-limbed may, In some illumined bay, Flings round her shining charms in starry rain, And with her body bright Dazzles the waters white, That fall from her fair form, and flee in vain, Dyed with the dear unutterable sight, And circle out her beauty thro' the circling main, So my hawthorn-tree Stood and seemed to me The very face that smiled the summer smile: All lesser light-bearers Did light their lamps at hers— She lit her own at heaven's, and looked the while A purer sweeter sun, Whence beauty was begun, And blossomed from her blossoms thro' the blossoming isle. Then I took heart, and as I looked upon Her unstained white, I said, ‘I am not wholly vile.’ Thus my hawthorn-tree Was my witness unto me, And so I answered my impleading sin Till blossom-time was o'er, And with the autumn roar Mine unrebuked accuser entered in, And I fell down convinced, and strove with shame no more. Some time after came to me, An image of the hawthorn-tree, And bore the old sweet witness; and I heard, And from among the dead I lifted up my head, As one lifts up to hear a little bird, And finds the night is past and all the east is red. Small and fair, choice and rare, Snowy pale with moonlight hair, My little one blossoms and springs! Like joy with woe singing to it, Like love with sorrow to woo it, So my witty one so my pretty one sings! And I see the white hawthorn-tree and the bright summer bird singing thro' it, And my heart is prouder than kings! While I look on her I seem Once again in the sweet dream Of that enchanted day, When, underneath the hawthorn-tree, I loved my love and my love loved me: And lost in love we lay, And saw the happy ships upon the yielding sea. While I look on her I seem Once again in that bright dream, Beautiful and wise: Wiser, fairer, more in tune, Than all else in that sweet June, And sinless as the skies That warmed the willing earth thro' all the languid noon. Like my hawthorn-tree, She stands and seems to me The very face that smiles the summer smile: All lesser light-bearers Do light their lamps at hers— She lights her own at heaven's, and looks the while A sweeter purer sun, Whence beauty is begun, To blossom from that blossom thro' the blossoming isle. Thou shalt not leave me, child! Come weather fierce or mild, My babe, my blossom! thou shalt never leave me! Life shall never wean us, Nor death shall e'er have room to come between us, And time may grieve me but shall ne'er bereave me, Nor see us more apart than he hath seen us. For I will fall with thee, As a bird from the tree Falls with a butterfly petal whitely shed, And falling—thou and I— I shall not dread to die, But like a child I'll take my flower to bed. And when the long cold death-night hath gone by, In the great darkness of the sepulchre I'll feel and find thee near, My babe, my white white blossom! And when the trumpet cries, I shall not fear to rise, But wear thee o'er the spot upon my bosom, And come out of my grave and bear the awful eyes. THE CAPTAIN'S WIFE. I do not say the day is long and weary, For while thou art content to be away, Living in thee, oh Love, I live thy day, And reck not if mine own be sad and dreary. I do not count its sorrows or its charms: It lies as cold, as empty, and as dead, As lay my wedding-dress beside my bed When I was clothed in thy dear arms. Yet there is something here within this breast Which, like a flower that never blossoms, lieth; And tho' in words and tears my sorrow crieth, I know that it hath never been exprest. Something that blindly yearneth to be known, And doth not burn, nor rage, nor leap, nor dart; But struggles in the sickness of my heart, As a root struggles in a vault of stone. Now, by my wedding-ring, I charge thee do not move That heavy stone that on the vault doth lie; I charge thee be of merry cheer, my love, Nor ever let me know that thou dost sigh, For, ah! how light a thing Would shake me with the sorrow I deny! I am as one who hid a giant's child In her deep prison, and, from year to year, He grew to his own stature, fierce and wild, And what she took for love she kept for fear. Oh, thou enchanter, who dost hold the spells Of all my sealèd cells, Oh Love, that hast been silent all too long, A little longer, Love, oh, silent be; My secret hath waxed strong, My giant hath grown up to angry age; Do thou but say the word that sets him free, And, lo! he tears me in his rage! I do not say the day is sad and dreary, For while thou art content to be away, Living in thee, oh Love, I live thy day, And reck not if mine own be wan and weary. I look down on it from my far love-dream, As some drowned saint may see with musing eyes Her lifeless body float adown the stream, While she is smiling in her skies. But do thou silence keep! For I am one who walketh on the ledge Of some great rock's sheer edge: I walk in beauty and in light, Self-balanced on the height: A breath!—and I am breathless in the deep. Oh, my own Love, I warn Thy grief to be as still as they who tread The snow of alpine peak, And see the pendulous avalanche o'erhead Hang like a dew-drop on a thorn! I charge thee silence keep! My life stands breathless by her agony, Oh, do not bid her leap! I am as calm as air Before a summer storm; The ocean of my thoughts hath ceased to roll; This living heart that doth not beat is warm; I think the stillness of my face is fair; The cloud that fills my soul Is not a cloud of pain. Beware, beware! one rash Sweet glance may be the flash That brings it raving down in thunder and in rain! No, do not speak: Nor, oh! let any tell of thy pale cheek, Nor paint the silent sorrow of thine eye, Nor tell me thou art fond, or gay, or glad; For, ah! so tuned and lightly strung am I, That howsoe'er thou stir, I ring thereby. Thy manly voice is deep, But if thou touch from sleep The woman's treble of my shrill reply, Ah, who shall say thine echoes may not weep? A jester's ghost is sad, The shades of merriest flowers do mow and creep, And oh, the vocal shadows that should fly About the simplest word that thou canst say, What after spell shall ever lay? Hast thou forgot when I sat down to sing To my forsaken harp, long, long ago, How thou, for sport, wouldst strike a single string, And hark the hovering chorus come and go, Low and high, high and low, Till round the throbbing wire Rose such a quivering quire, As all King David's wives were echoing The tenor of their king. Like those dear strings, my silent soul is full Of cries, as a ripe fruit is full of wine. The fruit is hanging fair and beautiful, And dry-eyed as a rose in the sunshine, But try it with a single touch of thine, And, lo! the drops that start, And all the golden vintage of its heart! So, thinking of thy debt to Love and me, In some dull hour beyond the sea, Do thou but only say— As carelessly as men do pay their debts— ‘Oh, weary day!’ And that one sigh o'ersets The hive of my regrets, ‘Ah, weary, weary day, Oh, weary, weary day, Oh, day so weary, oh, day so dreary, Oh, weary, weary, weary, weary, weary, Oh, weary, weary!’ GRASS FROM THE BATTLE-FIELD. Small sheaf Of withered grass, that hast not yet revealed Thy story, lo! I see thee once more green And growing on the battle-field, On that last day that ever thou didst grow! I look down thro' thy blades and see between A little lifted clover leaf Stand like a cresset: and I know If this were morn there should be seen In its chalice such a gem As decks no mortal diadem Poised with a lapidary skill Which merely living doth fulfil And pass the exquisite strain of subtlest human will. But in the sun it lifteth up A dry unjewelled cup, Therefore I see that day doth not begin; And yet I know its beaming lord Hath not yet passed the hill of noon, Or thy lush blades Would be more dry and thin, And every blade a thirsty sword Edged with the sharp desire that soon Should draw the silver blood of all the shades. I feel 't is summer. This whereon I stand Is not a hill, nor, as I think, a vale; The soil is soft upon the generous land, Yet not as where the meeting streams take hand Under the mossy mantle of the dale. Such grass is for the meadow. If I try To lift my heavy eyelids, as in dreams A power is on them, and I know not why. Thou art but part; the whole is unconfest: Beholding thee I long to know the rest. As one expands the bosom with a sigh, I stretch my sight's horizon; but it seems, Ere it can widen round the mystery, To close in swift contraction, like the breast. The air is held, as by a charm, In an enforcèd silence, as like sound As the dead man the living. 'T is so still, I listen for it loud. And when I force my eyes from thy sole place And see a wider space, Above, around, In ragged glory like a torn And golden-natured cloud, O'er the dim field a living smoke is warm; As in a city on a sabbath morn The hot and summer sunshine goes abroad Swathed in the murky air, As if a god Enrobed himself in common flesh and blood, Our heavy flesh and blood, And here and there As unaware Thro' the dull lagging limbs of mortal make, That keep unequal time, the swifter essence brake. But hark a bugle horn! And, ere it ceases, such a shock As if the plain were iron, and thereon An iron hammer, heavy as a hill, Swung by a monstrous force, in stroke came down And deafened Heaven. I feel a swound Of every sense bestunned. The rent ground seems to rock, And all the definite vision, in such wise As a dead giant borne on a swift river, Seems sliding off for ever, When my reviving eyes, As one that holds a spirit by his eye With set inexorable stare, Fix thee: and so I catch, as by the hair, The form of that great dream that else had drifted by. I know not what that form may be; The lock I hold is all I see, And thou, small sheaf! art all the battle-field to me. The wounded silence hath not time to heal When see! upon thy sod The round stroke of a charger's heel With echoing thunder shod! As the night-lightning shows A mole upon a momentary face, So, as that gnarled hoof strikes the indented place, I see it, and it goes! And I hear the squadrons trot thro' the heavy shell and shot, And wheugh! but the grass is gory! Forward ho! blow to blow, at the foe in they go, And 'tis hieover heigho for glory! The rushing storm is past, But hark! upon its track the far drums beat, And all the earth that at thy roots thou hast Stirs, shakes, shocks, sounds, with quick strong tramp of feet In time unlike the last. Footing to tap of drum The charging columns come; And as they come their mighty martial sound Blows on before them as a flaming fire Blows in the wind; for, as old Mars in ire Strode o'er the world encompassed in a cloud, So the swift legion, o'er the quaking ground, Strode in a noise of battle. Nigh and nigher I heard it, like the long swell gathering loud What-time a land-wind blowing from the main Blows to the burst of fury and is o'er, As if an ocean on one fatal shore Fell in a moment whole, and threw its roar Whole to the further sea: and as the strain Of my strong sense cracked in the deafened ear, And all the rushing tumult of the plain Topped its great arch above me, a swift foot Was struck between thy blades to the struck root, And lifted: as into a sheath A sudden sword is thrust and drawn again Ere one can gasp a breath. I was so near, I saw the wrinkles of the leather grain, The very cobbler's stitches, and the wear By which I knew the wearer trod not straight; An honest shoe it seemed that had been good To mete the miles of any country lane, Nor did one sign explain 'T was made to wade thro' blood. My shoe, soft footstooled on this hearth, so far From strife, hath such a patch, and as he past His broken shoelace whipt his eager haste. An honest shoe, good faith! that might have stood Upon the threshold of a village inn And welcomed all the world: or by the byre And barn gone peaceful till the day closed in, And, scraped at eve upon some homely gate, Ah, Heaven! might sit beside a cottage fire And touch the lazy log to softer flames than war. Long, long, thou wert alone, I thought thy days were done, Flat as ignoble grass that lies out mown By peaceful hands in June, I saw thee lie. A worm crawled o'er thee, and the gossamer That telegraphs Queen Mab to Oberon, Lengthening his living message, passed thee by. But rain fell: and thy strawed blades one by one Began to stir and stir. And as some moorland bird Whom the still hunter's stalking steps have stirred, When he stands mute, and nothing more is heard, With slow succession and reluctant art Grows upward from her bed, Each move a muffled start, And thro' the silent autumn covert red Uplifts a throbbing head That times the ambushed hunter's thudding heart; Or as a snow-drop bending low Beneath a flake of other snow Thaws to its height when spring winds melt the skies, And drip by drip doth mete a measured rise; Or as the eyelids of a child's fair eyes Lift from her lower lashes slow and pale To arch the wonder of a fairy tale; So thro' the western light I saw thee slowly rearing to thy height. Then when thou hadst regained thy state, And while a meadow-spider with three lines Enschemed thy three tall pillars green, And made the enchanted air between Mortal with shining signs, (For the loud carrion-flies were many and late), Betwixt thy blades and stems There fell a hand, Soft, small and white, and ringed with gold and gems; And on those stones of price I saw a proud device, And words I could not understand. Idly, one by one, The knots of anguish came undone, The fingers stretched as from a cramp of woe, And sweet and slow Moved to gracious shapes of rest, Like a curl of soft pale hair Drying in the sun. And then they spread, And sought a wonted greeting in the air, And strayed Between thy blades, and with each blade As with meeting fingers played And tresses long and fair. Then again at placid length it lay, Stretched as to kisses of accustomed lips; And again in sudden strain Sprang, falling clenched with pain, Till the knuckles white, Thro' the evening gray, Whitened and whitened as the snowy tips Of far hills glimmer thro' the night. But who shall tell that agony That beat thee, beat thee into bloody clay Red as the sards and rubies of the rings; As when a bird, fast by the fowler's net, A moment doth forget His fetters, and with desperate wings A-sudden springs and falls, And (while from happy clouds the skylark calls) Still feebler springs And fainter falls, And still untamed upon the gory ground With failing strength renews his deadly wound? At length the struggle ceased; and my fixed eye Perceived that every finger wan Did quiver like the quivering fan Of a dying butterfly, Nor long I watched until Even the humming in the air was still. Then I gazed and gazed, Nor once my aching eyeballs raised Till a poor bird that had a meadow nest Came down, and like a shadow ran Among the shadowy grass. I followed with mine eyes; and with a strain Pursued her, till six cubits' length beyond Thy central sheaf, I found A sight I could not pass. The hacked and haggard head Of a huge war-horse dead. The evening haze hung o'er him like a breath, And still in death He stretched drawn lips of rage that grinned in vain; A sparrow chirped upon His wound, and in his dying slaver fed, Or picked those teeth of stone That bit with lifeless jaws the purple tongue of pain. But I remembered that dead hand I left to trace the childless lark, And back o'er those six cubits of grass-land, Blade by blade, and stalk by stalk, As one doth walk Who, mindful, counts by dark Along the garden palings to the gate, I felt along the vision to where late There lay that dead hand white; But now methought that there was something more Than when I looked before, And what was more was sweeter than the rest; As when upon the moony half of night Aurora lays a living light, Softer than moonshine, yet more bright. And as I looked I was aware Another hand was on the hand, A smaller hand, more fair But not more white, as is the warm delight That curves and curls and coyly glows About the blushing heart of the white rose More fair but not more white Than those broad beauties that expand And fall, and falling blanch the morning air. Both hands lay motionless, The living on the dead. But by and by The living hand began to move and press The cold dead flesh, and took its silent way So often o'er the unrespective clay, In such long-drawn caress Of pleading passion, such an ecstacy Of supplicating touch, that as they lay So like, so unlike, twined with the fond art And all the dear delay And dreadful patience of a desperate heart, Methought that to the tenement From which it lately went, The naked life had come back, and did try By every gate to enter. While I thought, With sudden clutch of new intent The living grasp had caught The dead compliance. Slowly thro' The dusky air she raised it, and aloft, While all her fingers soft And every starting vein Tightened as in a rack of pain, Held it one straining moment fixed and mute, And let it go. And with a thud upon the sod, It fell like falling fruit. Then there came a cry, Tearless, bloodless, dry Of every sap of sorrow but its own— It had no likeness among living cries; And to my heart my streaming blood was blown As if before my eyes A dead man sprang up dead, and dead fell down. The carrion-hunting winds that prowl the wold, Frenzied for prey, sweep in and bear it on, Far, far and further thro' the shrieking cold, And still the yelling pack devour it as they run. And silence, like a want of air, Was round me, and my sense burned low, And darkness darkened; and the glow Of the living hand being gone, The dead hand showed like a pale stone Full fathom five Under a quiet bay. But still my sight did dive To reach it where it lay, And still the night grew dark, and by degrees The dead thing glimmered with a drownèd light, As faces seem and sink in depths of darkening seas. Then, while yet My set eyes saw it, as the sage doth set His glass to some dim glimpse afar That palpitates from mote to star, It was touched and hid; Touched and hid, as when a deep sea-weed Hides some white sea-sorrow. All My sight uprose, and all my soul (As one who presses at the pane When a city show goes by), Crowded into the fixed eye, And filled the starting ball. Nor filled in vain. I began to feel The air had something to reveal. Beyond the blank indifference Was underlined another sense, Was rained a gracious influence; And tho' the darkness was so deep, I knew it was not wholly dead, Nor empty, as we feel in sleep That some one standeth by the bed. I beheld, as who should look In trance upon a sealèd book. I perceived that in a place The night was lighter, as the face Of an Indian Queen when love Draws back the dark blood from her sick Pale cheek Behind the sable curtain that doth not move. No outer light was shed, But as the mystery Before my stronger will did slowly yield, I saw, as in that dark hour before morn When the shocks of harvest corn Exhale about the midnight field The wealth of yellow suns, and breathe a gentle day. I saw the shape of a fair bended head, And hair pale streaming long and low Veiling the face I might not know, And dabbling all the ground with sweet uncertain woe. Much I questioned in my mind Of her form and kind, But my stern compelling eye Brought no other answer from the air, Nor did my rude hand dare Profane that agony. I watched apart With such a sweet awe in my heart As looks up dumb into the sky When that goddess, lorn and lone, Who slew grim winter like a polar bear, And threw his immemorial white Upon her granite throne, Sits all unseen as Death, Save for the loss of many a hidden star And for the wintry mystery of her breath, And at a far-sight that she sees, Bowed by her great despair, Bendeth her awful head upon her knees, And all her wondrous hair Dishevels golden down the northern night. At length my weary gaze Rents: and, haze in haze Pervolving as in glad release, I saw each separate shade Slide from his place and fade, And all the flowering dark did winter back Into its undistinguished black. So the sculptor doth in fancy make His formèd image in the formless stone, And while his spells compel, Can see it there full well, The ivory kernel in the ivory shell, But shakes himself and all the god is gone. Alas! And have I seen thee but an hour? And shalt thou never tell Thy story, oh thou broken flower, Thou midnight asphodel Among the battle grass? Too soon! too soon! But while I bid thee stay, Night, like a cloud, dissolves into the day, And from the city clock I hear the stroke of noon. AFLOAT AND ASHORE. ‘Tumble and rumble, and grumble and snort, Like a whale to starboard, a whale to port; Tumble and rumble, and grumble and snort, And the steamer steams thro' the sea, love!’ ‘I see the ship on the sea, love, I stand alone On this rock, The sea does not shock The stone; The waters around it are swirled, But under my feet I feel it go down To where the hemispheres meet At the adamant heart of the world. Oh, that the rock would move! Oh, that the rock would roll To meet thee over the sea, love! Surely my mighty love Should fill it like a soul, And it should bear me to thee, love; Like a ship on the sea, love, Bear me, bear me, to thee, love!’ ‘Guns are thundering, seas are sundering, crowds are wondering, Low on our lee, love. Over and over the cannon-clouds cover brother and lover, but over and over The whirl-wheels trundle the sea, love, And on thro' the loud pealing pomp of her cloud The great ship is going to thee, love; Blind to her mark, like a world thro' the dark, Thundering, sundering, to the crowds wondering, Thundering ever to thee, love.’ ‘I have come down to thee coming to me, love, I stand, I stand On the solid sand, I see thee coming to me, love; The sea runs up to me on the sand, I start—'t is as if thou hadst stretched thine hand And touched me thro' the sea, love. I feel as if I must die For there's something longs to fly, Fly and fly, to thee, love. As the blood of the flower ere she blows Is beating up to the sun, And her roots do hold her down, And it blushes and breaks undone In a rose, So my blood is beating in me, love! I see thee nigh and nigher, And my soul leaps up like sudden fire, My life's in the air To meet thee there, To meet thee coming to me, love! Over the sea, Coming to me, Coming, and coming to me, love!’ ‘The boats are lowered: I leap in first, Pull, boys, pull! or my heart will burst! More! more!—lend me an oar!— I'm thro' the breakers! I'm on the shore! I see thee waiting for me, love!’ ‘A sudden storm Of sighs and tears, A clenching arm, A look of years. In my bosom a thousand cries, A flash like light before my eyes, And I am lost in thee, love!’ THE GHOST'S RETURN. Skirlin' an' birlin', tunin' an' croonin', Reelin' an' skreelin', they piped doun the glen, Lang Hugh an' black Sandie, Ian Dhu an' wee Dandie, Wha wad na gang wi' the braw Hielan'men? Skirlin' an' birlin', tunin' an' croonin', Reelin' an' skreelin', they piped doun the glen, Wi' a rout an' a shout, an' a' the lasses out, Wha wad na gang wi' the braw Hielan'men? Skirlin' an' birlin', tunin' an' croonin', Reelin' an' skreelin', they piped doun the glen! Wi' the hot light o' noon an' the blue sky aboon, Ilka man sword in han' gaed the braw Hielan'men! Ken ye why we weep? Think ye that they sleep, Ilka man on his ain bluidy brae, Ilk ane whar he died wi' a faeman by his side, An' the pibroch can wauk him na mae? Or the news cam' fra the fiel' we ken'd it a' too weel, Our bonnie bonnie braw Hielan'men! Not a foot ony stirred to meet the bluidy word, As the death-roll cam' slow up the glen. Had ye seen any sight of terror and affright? Did their ghosts walk in white up the glen? We saw na ony sight o' terror an' affright, An' white's no for braw tartaned men! Fra the hour they gaed that day, oh the glen was fu' o' wae, Our bonnie bonnie braw Hielan'men! Sair, sair, an' mair an' mair, our hearts were fu' o' care, And our een speerit aye doun the glen; Till ae morn it did befa' that we waukit up a', An' the light it was sweet, but an' ben, An' a' that lang day we had na ony wae, An' no ee cared to speer doun the glen. Not a lassie but apart hid her wonder in her heart, An' lay close till the day began to dee, Lest her canty een confest the secret o' her breast, For she said, ‘They will a' weep but me.’ But when we met at een by the thorn upon the green, An' the tale we a' tellt was the same, Not a word mair we said, but lik ane hid her head, An' kenned that her man was at hame. DAFT JEAN. Daft Jean, The waesome wean, She cam' by the cottage, she cam' by the ha', The laird's ha' o' Wutherstanelaw, The cottar's cot by the birken shaw; An' aye she gret, To ilk ane she met, For the trumpet had blawn an' her lad was awa'. ‘Black, black,’ sang she, ‘Black, black my weeds shall be, My love has widowed me! Black, black!’ sang she. Daft Jean, The waesome wean, She cam' by the cottage, she cam' by the ha', The laird's ha' o' Wutherstanelaw, The cottar's cot by the birken shaw; Nae mair she creepit, Nae mair she weepit, She stept 'mang the lasses the queen o' them a', The queen o' them a', The queen o' them a', She stept 'mang the lasses the queen o' them a'. For the fight it was fought i' the fiel' far awa', An' claymore in han' for his love an' his lan', The lad she lo'ed best he was foremost to fa'. ‘White, white,’ sang she, ‘White, white, my weeds shall be, I am no widow,’ sang she, ‘White, white, my wedding shall be, White, white!’ sang she. Daft Jean, The waesome wean, She gaed na' to cottage, she gaed na' to ha', But forth she creepit, While a' the house weepit, Into the snaw i' the eerie night-fa'. At morn we found her, The lammies stood round her, The snaw was her pillow, her sheet was the snaw; Pale she was lying, Singing and dying, A' for the laddie wha fell far awa'. ‘White, white,’ sang she, ‘My love has married me, White, white, my weeds shall be, White, white, my wedding shall be, White, white,’ sang she!

FOR CHARITY'S SAKE. ‘Oh dark-eyed maid,’ The soldier said, ‘I've been wounded in many a fray, But such a dart As you shoot to my heart I never felt till to-day. Then give to me Kisses, one, two, three, All for dear Charity's sake. And pity my pain, And meet me again, Or else my heart must break.’ Peggy was kind, She would save the blind Black fly that shimmered the ale, And her quick hand stopped If a grass-moth dropped In the drifted snows of the pail. One, two, three, Kisses gave she, All for dear Charity's sake; And she pitied his pain, And she met him again, For fear his heart should break. The bugle blew, The merry flag flew, The squadron clattered the town; The twigs were bright on the minster elm, He wore a primrose in his helm As they clattered thro' the town. Heydey, holiday, on we go! Heydey, holiday, blow boys, blow! Clattering thro' the town. And when the minster leaves were sear, On a far red field by a dark sea drear, In dust and thunder, and cheer, boys, cheer, The bold dragoon went down. Shiver, poor Peggy, the wind blows high; Beg a penny as I go by, All for sweet Charity's sake: Hold the thin hand from the shawl, Turn the wan face to the wall, Turn the face, let the hot tears fall, For fear your heart should break. WIND. Oh the wold, the wold, Oh the wold, the wold! Oh the winter stark, Oh the level dark, On the wold, the wold, the wold! Oh the wold, the wold, Oh the wold, the wold! Oh the mystery Of the blasted tree On the wold, the wold, the wold! Oh the wold, the wold, Oh the wold, the wold! Oh the owlet's croon To the haggard moon, To the waning moon, On the wold, the wold, the wold! Oh the wold, the wold, Oh the wold, the wold! Oh the fleshless stare, Oh the windy hair, On the wold, the wold, the wold! Oh the wold, the wold, Oh the wold, the wold! Oh the cold sigh, Oh the hollow cry, The lean and hollow cry, On the wold, the wold, the wold! Oh the wold, the wold, Oh the wold, the wold! Oh the white sight, Oh the shuddering night, The shivering shuddering night, On the wold, the wold, the wold! ‘WHEN THE RAIN IS ON THE ROOF.’ Lord, I am poor, and know not how to speak, But since Thou art so great, Thou needest not that I should speak to Thee well. All angels speak unto Thee well. Lord, Thou hast all things: what Thou wilt is Thine. More gold and silver than the sun and moon; All flocks and herds, all fish in every sea; Mountains and valleys, cities and all farms; Cots and all men, harvests and years of fruit. Is any king arrayed like Thee, who wearest A new robe every morning? Who is crowned As Thou, who settest heaven upon thy head? But as for me— For me, if he be dead, I have but Thee! Therefore, because Thou art my sole possession, I will not fear to speak to Thee who art mine, For who doth dread his own? Lord, I am very sorrowful. I know That Thou delightest to do well; to wipe Tears from all eyes; to bind the broken-hearted; To comfort them that mourn; to give to them Beauty for ashes, and to garb with joy The naked soul of grief. And what so good But Thou that wilt canst do it? Which of all Thy works is less in wonder and in praise Than this poor heart's desire? Give me, oh Lord, My heart's desire! Wilt Thou refuse my prayer Who givest when no man asketh? How great things, How unbesought, how difficult, how strange, Thou dost in daily pleasure! Who is like Thee, Oh Lord of Life and Death? The year is dead; It smouldered in its smoke to the white ash Of winter: but Thou breathest and the fire Is kindled, and Thy summer bounty burns. This is a marvel to me. Day is buried; And where they laid him in the west I see The mounded mountains. Yet shall he come back; Not like a ghost that rises from his grave. But in the east the palace gates will ope, And he comes forth out of the feast, and I Behold him and the glory after him, Like to a messaged angel with wide arms Of rapture, all the honour in his eyes, And blushing with the King. In the dark hours Thou hast been busy with him: for he went Down westward, and he cometh from the east, Not as toil-stained from travel, tho' his course And journey in the secrets of the night Be far as earth and heaven. This is a sum Too hard for me, oh Lord; I cannot do it. But Thou hast set it, and I know with Thee There is an answer. Man also, oh Lord, Is clear and whole before Thee. Well I know That the strong skein and tangle of our life Thou holdest by the end. The mother dieth— The mother dieth ere her time, and like A jewel in the cinders of a fire, The child endures. Also, the son is slain, And she who bore him shrieks not while the steel Doth hack her sometime vitals, and transfix The heart she throbbed with. How shall these things be? Likewise, oh Lord, man that is born of woman, Who built him of her tenderness, and gave Her sighs to breathe him, and for all his bones— Poor trembler!—hath no wherewithal more stern Than bowels of her pity, cometh forth Like a young lion from his den. Ere yet His teeth be fangled he hath greed of blood, And gambols for the slaughter: and being grown, Sudden, with terrible mane and mouthing thunder, Like a thing native to the wilderness He stretches toward the desert; while his dam, As a poor dog that nursed the king of beasts, Strains at her sordid chain, and, with set ear, Hath yet a little longer, in the roar And backward echo of his windy flight, Him, seen no more. This also is too hard— Too hard for me, oh Lord! I cannot judge it. Also the armies of him are as dust. A little while the storm and the great rain Beat him, and he abideth in his place, But the suns scorch on him, and all his sap And strength, whereby he held against the ground, Is spent; as in the unwatched pot on the fire, When that which should have been the children's blood Scarce paints the hollow iron. Then Thou callest Thy wind. He passeth like the stowre and dust Of roads in summer. A brief while it casts A shadow, and beneath the passing cloud Things not to pass do follow to the hedge, Swift heaviness runs under with a show, And draws a train, and what was white is dark; But at the hedge it falleth on the fields— It falleth on the greenness of the grass; The grass between its verdure takes it in, And no man heedeth. Surely, oh Lord God, If he has gone down from me, if my child Nowhere in any lands that see the sun Maketh the sunshine pleasant, if the earth Hath smoothed o'er him as waters o'er a stone, Yet is he further from Thee than the day After its setting? Shalt Thou not, oh Lord, Be busy with him in the under dark, And give him journey thro' the secret night, As far as earth and heaven? Aye, tho' Thou slay me Yet will I trust in Thee, and in his flesh Shall he see God! But, Lord, tho' I am sure That Thou canst raise the dead, oh what has he To do with death? Our days of pilgrimage Are three-score years and ten; why should he die? Lord, this is grievous, that the heathen rage, And because they imagined a vain thing, That Thou shouldst send the just man that feared Thee, To smite it from their hands. Lord, who are they, That this my suckling lamb is their burnt-offering? That with my staff, oh Lord, their fire is kindled, My ploughshare Thou dost beat into Thy sword, The blood Thou givest them to drink is mine? Let it be far from Thee to do to mine What if I did it to mine own, Thy curse Avengeth. Do I take the children's bread And give it to the dogs? Do I rebuke So widely that the aimless lash comes down On innocent and guilty? Do I lift The hand of goodness by the elbowed arm And break it on the evil? Not so. Not so. Lord what advantageth it to be God If Thou do less than I? Have mercy on me! Deal not with me according to mine anger! Thou knowest if I lift my voice against Thee, 'Tis but as he who in his fierce despair Dasheth his head against the dungeon-stone, Sure that but one can suffer. Yet, oh Lord, If Thou hast heard—if my loud passion reached Thine awful ear—and yet, I think, oh Father, I did not rage, but my most little anger Borne in the strong arms of my mighty love Seemed of the other's stature—oh, good Lord, Bear witness now against me. Let me see And taste that Thou art good. Thou who art slow To wrath, oh pause upon my quick offence, And show me mortal! Thou whose strength is made Perfect in weakness, ah, be strong in me, For I am weak indeed! How weak, oh Lord, Thou knowest who hast seen the unlifted sin Lie on the guilty tongue that strove in vain To speak it. Call my madness from the tombs! Let the dumb fiend confess Thee! If I sinned In silence, if I looked the fool i' the face And answered to his heart, ‘There is no God,’ Now in mine hour stretch forth Thy hand, oh Lord, And let me be ashamed. As when in sleep I dream, and in the horror of my dream Fall to the empty place below the world Where no man is: no light, no life, no help, No hope! And all the marrow in my bones Leaps in me, and I rend the night with fear! And he who lieth near me thro' the dark Stretcheth an unseen hand, and all is well. Tho' Thou shouldst give me all my heart's desire, What is it in Thine eyes? Give me, oh God, My heart's desire! my heart's desire, oh God! As a young bird doth bend before its mother, Bendeth and crieth to its feeding mother, So bend I for that good thing before Thee. It trembleth on the rock with many cries, It bendeth with its breast upon the rock, And worships in the hunger of its heart. I tremble on the rock with many cries, I bend my beating breast against the rock, And worship in the hunger of my heart. Give me that good thing ere I die, my God! Give me that very good thing! Thou standest, Lord, By all things, as one standeth after harvest By the threshed corn, and, when the crowding fowl Beseech him, being a man and seeing as men, Hath pity on their cry, respecting not The great and little barley, but at will Dipping one hand into the golden store Straweth alike; nevertheless to them Whose eyes are near their meat and do esteem By conscience of their bellies, grain and grain Is stint or riches. Let it, oh my God, Be far from Thee to measure out Thy gifts Smaller and larger, or to say to me Who am so poor and lean with the long fast Of such a dreary dearth—to me whose joy Is not as Thine—whose human heart is nearer To its own good than Thou who art in heaven— ‘Not this but this:’ to me who if I took All that these arms could compass, all pressed down And running over that this heart could hold, All that in dreams I covet when the soul Sees not the further bound of what it craves, Might filch my mortal infinite from Thine And leave Thee nothing less. Give me, oh Lord, My heart's desire! It profiteth Thee nought Being withheld; being given, where is that aught It doth not profit me? Wilt Thou deny That which to Thee is nothing, but to me All things? Not so. Not so. If I were God And Thou——Have mercy on me! oh Lord! Lord! Lord, I am weeping. As Thou wilt, oh Lord, Do with him as Thou wilt; but oh, my God, Let him come back to die! Let not the fowls O' the air defile the body of my child, My own fair child that when he was a babe I lift up in my arms and gave to Thee! Let not his garment, Lord, be vilely parted, Nor the fine linen which these hands have spun Fall to the stranger's lot! Shall the wild bird —That would have pilfered of the ox—this year Disdain the pens and stalls? Shall her blind young, That on the fleck and moult of brutish beasts Had been too happy, sleep in cloth of gold Whereof each thread is to this beating heart As a peculiar darling? Lo, the flies Hum o'er him! Lo, a feather from the crow Falls in his parted lips! Lo, his dead eyes See not the raven! Lo, the worm, the worm Creeps from his festering horse! My God! my God! Oh Lord, Thou doest well. I am content. If Thou have need of him he shall not stay. But as one calleth to a servant, saying ‘At such a time be with me,’ so, oh Lord, Call him to Thee! Oh bid him not in haste Straight whence he standeth. Let him lay aside The soilèd tools of labour. Let him wash His hands of blood. Let him array himself Meet for his Lord, pure from the sweat and fume Of corporal travail! Lord, if he must die, Let him die here. Oh take him where Thou gavest! And even as once I held him in my womb Till all things were fulfilled, and he came forth, So, oh Lord, let me hold him in my grave Till the time come, and Thou, who settest when The hinds shall calve, ordain a better birth; And as I looked and saw my son, and wept For joy, I look again and see my son, And weep again for joy of him and Thee! THE BOTANIST'S VISION. The sun that in Breadalbane's lake doth fall Was melting to the sea down golden Tay, When a cry came along the peopled way, ‘Sebastopol is ours!’ From that wild call I turned, and leaning on a time-worn wall Quaint with the touch of many an ancient day, The mappèd mould and mildewed marquetry Knew with my focussed soul; which bent down all Its sense, power, passion, to the sole regard Of each green minim, as it were but born To that one use. I strode home stern and hard; In my hot hands I laid my throbbing head, And all the living world and all the dead Began a march which did not end at morn. THE ORPHAN'S SONG. I had a little bird, I took it from the nest; I prest it, and blest it, And nurst it in my breast. I set it on the ground, I danced round and round, And sang about it so cheerly, With ‘Hey my little bird, and ho my little bird, And oh but I love thee dearly!’ I make a little feast Of food soft and sweet, I hold it in my breast, And coax it to eat; I pit, and I pat, I call it this and that, And sing about it so cheerly, With ‘Hey my little bird, and ho my little bird, And ho but I love thee dearly!’ I may kiss, I may sing, But I can't make it feed, It taketh no heed Of any pleasant thing. I scolded, and I socked, But it minded not a whit, Its little mouth was locked, And I could not open it. Tho' with pit, and with pat, And with this, and with that, I sang about it so cheerly, And ‘Hey my little bird, and ho my little bird, And ho but I love thee dearly.’ But when the day was done, And the room was at rest, And I sat all alone With my birdie in my breast, And the light had fled, And not a sound was heard, Then my little bird Lifted up its head, And the little mouth Loosed its sullen pride, And it opened, it opened, With a yearning strong and wide. Swifter than I speak I brought it food once more, But the poor little beak Was locked as before. I sat down again, And not a creature stirred, I laid the little bird Again where it had lain; And again when nothing stirred, And not a word I said, Then my little bird Lifted up its head, And the little beak Loosed its stubborn pride, And it opened, it opened, With a yearning strong and wide. It lay in my breast, It uttered no cry, 'Twas famished, 'twas famished, And I couldn't tell why. I couldn't tell why, But I saw that it would die, For all that I kept dancing round and round, And singing above it so cheerly, With ‘Hey my little bird, and ho my little bird, And ho but I love thee dearly!’ I never look sad, I hear what people say, I laugh when they are gay And they think I am glad. My tears never start, I never say a word, But I think that my heart Is like that little bird. Every day I read, And I sing, and I play, But thro' the long day It taketh no heed. It taketh no heed Of any pleasant thing, I know it doth not read, I know it doth not sing. With my mouth I read, With my hands I play, My shut heart is shut, Coax it how you may. You may coax it how you may While the day is broad and bright, But in the dead night When the guests are gone away, And no more the music sweet Up the house doth pass, Nor the dancing feet Shake the nursery glass; And I've heard my aunt Along the corridor, And my uncle gaunt Lock his chamber door; And upon the stair All is hushed and still, And the last wheel Is silent in the square; And the nurses snore, And the dim sheets rise and fall, And the lamplight's on the wall, And the mouse is on the floor; And the curtains of my bed Are like a heavy cloud, And the clock ticks loud, And sounds are in my head; And little Lizzie sleeps Softly at my side, It opens, it opens, With a yearning strong and wide! It yearns in my breast, It utters no cry, 'Tis famished, 'tis famished, And I feel that I shall die, I feel that I shall die, And none will know why. Tho' the pleasant life is dancing round and round And singing about me so cheerly, With ‘Hey my little bird, and ho my little bird, And ho but I love thee dearly!’ TOMMY'S DEAD. You may give over plough, boys, You may take the gear to the stead, All the sweat o' your brow, boys, Will never get beer and bread. The seed's waste, I know, boys, There's not a blade will grow, boys, 'Tis cropped out, I trow, boys, And Tommy's dead. Send the colt to fair, boys, He's going blind, as I said, My old eyes can't bear, boys, To see him in the shed; The cow's dry and spare, boys, She's neither here nor there, boys, I doubt she's badly bred; Stop the mill to-morn, boys, There'll be no more corn, boys, Neither white nor red; There's no sign of grass, boys, You may sell the goat and the ass, boys, The land's not what it was, boys, And the beasts must be fed: You may turn Peg away, boys, You may pay off old Ned, We've had a dull day, boys, And Tommy's dead. Move my chair on the floor, boys, Let me turn my head: She's standing there in the door, boys, Your sister Winifred! Take her away from me, boys, Your sister Winifred! Move me round in my place, boys, Let me turn my head, Take her away from me, boys, As she lay on her death-bed, The bones of her thin face, boys, As she lay on her death-bed! I don't know how it be, boys, When all's done and said, But I see her looking at me, boys, Wherever I turn my head; Out of the big oak-tree, boys, Out of the garden-bed, And the lily as pale as she, boys, And the rose that used to be red. There's something not right, boys, But I think it's not in my head, I've kept my precious sight, boys— The Lord be hallowed! Outside and in The ground is cold to my tread, The hills are wizen and thin, The sky is shrivelled and shred, The hedges down by the loan I can count them bone by bone, The leaves are open and spread, But I see the teeth of the land, And hands like a dead man's hand, And the eyes of a dead man's head. There's nothing but cinders and sand, The rat and the mouse have fed, And the summer's empty and cold; Over valley and wold Wherever I turn my head There's a mildew and a mould, The sun's going out over head, And I'm very old, And Tommy's dead. What am I staying for, boys, You're all born and bred, 'Tis fifty years and more, boys, Since wife and I were wed, And she's gone before, boys, And Tommy's dead. She was always sweet, boys, Upon his curly head, She knew she'd never see 't, boys, And she stole off to bed; I've been sitting up alone, boys, For he'd come home, he said, But it's time I was gone, boys, For Tommy's dead. Put the shutters up, boys, Bring out the beer and bread, Make haste and sup, boys, For my eyes are heavy as lead; There's something wrong i' the cup, boys, There's something ill wi' the bread, I don't care to sup, boys, And Tommy's dead. I'm not right, I doubt, boys, I've such a sleepy head, I shall never more be stout, boys, You may carry me to bed. What are you about, boys, The prayers are all said, The fire's raked out, boys, And Tommy's dead. The stairs are too steep, boys, You may carry me to the head, The night's dark and deep, boys, Your mother's long in bed, Tis time to go to sleep, boys, And Tommy's dead. I'm not used to kiss, boys, You may shake my hand instead. All things go amiss, boys, You may lay me where she is, boys, And I'll rest my old head: 'Tis a poor world, this, boys, And Tommy's dead. ‘SHE TOUCHES A SAD STRING OF SOFT RECALL.’ Return, return! all night my lamp is burning, All night, like it, my wide eyes watch and burn; Like it, I fade and pale, when day returning Bears witness that the absent can return, Return, return. Like it, I lessen with a lengthening sadness, Like it, I burn to waste and waste to burn, Like it, I spend the golden oil of gladness To feed the sorrowy signal for return, Return, return. Like it, like it, whene'er the east wind sings, I bend and shake; like it, I quake and yearn, When Hope's late butterflies, with whispering wings, Fly in out of the dark, to fall and burn— Burn in the watchfire of return, Return, return. Like it, the very flame whereby I pine Consumes me to its nature. While I mourn My soul becomes a better soul than mine, And from its brightening beacon I discern My starry love go forth from me, and shine Across the seas a path for thy return, Return, return. Return, return! all night I see it burn, All night it prays like me, and lifts a twin Of palmèd praying hands that meet and yearn— Yearn to the impleaded skies for thy return. Day, like a golden fetter, locks them in, And wans the light that withers, tho' it burn As warmly still for thy return; Still thro' the splendid load uplifts the thin Pale, paler, palest patience that can learn Nought but that votive sign for thy return— That single suppliant sign for thy return, Return, return. Return, return! lest haply, love, or e'er Thou touch the lamp the light have ceased to burn, And thou, who thro' the window didst discern The wonted flame, shalt reach the topmost stair To find no wide eyes watching there, No withered welcome waiting thy return! A passing ghost, a smoke-wreath in the air, The flameless ashes, and the soulless urn, Warm with the famished fire that lived to burn— Burn out its lingering life for thy return, Its last of lingering life for thy return, Its last of lingering life to light thy late return, Return, return.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">VOL. II. BALDER. PART THE FIRST. PERSONS. Balder (a Poet). Amy (his wife). Doctor Paul. An Artist. A Servant. SCENE I. A Study, with Books, MSS. and Statues. A Window looks over a Country Valley to the neighbouring Mountains. A Door in the Study communicates with an adjoining Room. Balder (musing). To-morrow I count thirty years, save one. Ye grey stones Of this old tower gloomy and ruinous, Wherein I make mine eyrie as an eagle Among the rocks; stones, valley, mountains, trees, In which I dwell content as in a nest Of Beauty,—comprehended less by more— Or above which I rise, as a great ghost Out of its mortal hull; vale, mountains, trees, And stones of home, which, as in some old tale O' the east keep interchange of prodigies With me, and now contain me and anon Are stomached by mine hunger, unappeased That sucks Creation down, and o'er the void Still gapes for more; ye whom I love and fear And worship, or i' the hollow of my hand Throw like a grain of incense up to Heaven, Tell me your secrets! That ye have a heart I know; but can it beat for such as I? Or do I unbeheld behold the fair And answering mystery of your countenance Passionate with rains and sunshine, and, unheard, Have audience of your voices, but as one Who in a temple passes unrespect Between the kneeling suppliant and the saint, Meeting the uplifted face and the rapt eyes That look beyond? Am I but as a fly Touching the vestal beauties of a maid Unchidden; intimate but by how much Inferior? Do ye speak over my head Even as we pray aloud before a child? You trees that I have loved so well, ye flowers Unto whom, by so much as ye are more In beauty, hath befallen a better love Than mine, being her chosen who to me Is as your airy fragrance and mere hues To your unblushed substantial; thou sweet vale In which my soul, calm lying like a lake, Reflects the stars, or, stirred, upon the shores Of mountains maketh music, or more loud, Rising in sudden flood, and breaking up That firmament to heaped and scattered stars, Chaotic to and fro from hill to hill Defiesthe rounding elements, and rolls Reverberating thunder; have I lived Not unbeloved, and shall I pass away Not all unwept? You floors, in whose black oak The straitened hamadryad lives and groans, Ye creaking dark and antiquated floors, Who know so well in what sad note to join The weary lullaby what time she rocks Her babe, and murmurs music sad and low, So sad and low as if this tower did keep The murmur of the years as a sea-shell The sea, or in these legendary halls The mere air stirred, and with some old unknown Sufficient conscience moved upon itself, Whispering and sighing; ruined castle-wall Whereby she groweth like some delicate flower In a deserted garden, thou grim wall Hemming her in with thine unmannered rock Wherein I set her as a wandering clown Who, in a fairy-ring, by night doth seize Some elfin taper, and would have it burn In his gaunt lanthorn wrought by human hands Uncouth, yet art so passing bright with her— So fragrant! little window in the wall, Eye-lashed with balmy sprays of honeysuckle, Sweet jessamine, and ivy ever sad, Wherein like a most melancholy eye, All day she sits and looks forth on a world Less fair than she, and as a living soul Informs the rugged face of the old tower With beauty; when the soul hath left the face The sad eye looks no longer from the lid, The sweet light is put out in the long rain, The flower is withered on the wall, the voice Will never murmur any more, and ye, Ye, that both spake and saw, are dumb and blind, —Blind save when midnight bolt from your death's-head Starts like a bloody eyeball, or your rot Glimmers in corse-lights on the shuddering dark—— And dumb, but for such noise as dumb men make, When winds are moaning in your empty jaws— Will there be aught to tell of what has been? Where for so many nights and days she wept, Shall not sweet colours in the slanting sun Cross and recross, and floor the empty space With rainbows? Will the lingering swallow stay Within, as conscious of an influence Like summer? Will an earlier primrose shine On a peculiar season whereabout The winds beat idly? Shall the winter thrush Alight upon your dreary round and sing As to a nestling? Shall the village school Know the low turret where all stricken birds Do shelter? Or the curious traveller note The lonely tower where evermore the dew Hangs on the herbs of ruin? Sun and moon Rising and setting, but now face to face In equal Heaven, remember us! O ye Celestial lovers, you at least should make A love immortal! On this final eve Methinks that ye look down on me with eyes Of human contemplation. Lady Moon, Casting as yet no shade, thy shade dissolved In daylight of thy lord, O royal Sun, Who though at last thou sink beneath the tides She raiseth, unsubdued shalt glorify The fatal waters, and still shine on her With undiminished love, to you I leave Our memories. Oh consecrate these stones And point with mindful shadow day and night, Where we lie dust below. SCENE II. The same. From the adjoining Room, through the half-opened Door, are heard the Rocking of a Cradle and the Voice of Amy. Amy. The years they come, and the years they go Like winds that blow from sea to sea; From dark to dark they come and go, All in the dew-fall and the rain. Down by the stream there be two sweet willows, —Hush thee, babe, while the wild winds blow,— One hale, one blighted, two wedded willows All in the dew-fall and the rain. She is blighted, the fair young willow, —Hush thee, babe, while the wild winds blow,— She hears the spring-blood beat in the bark; She hears the spring-leaf bud on the bough; But she bends blighted, the wan weeping willow, All in the dew-fall and the rain. The stream runs sparkling under the willow, —Hush thee, babe, while the wild winds blow,— The summer rose-leaves drop in the stream; The winter oak-leaves drop in the stream; But she bends blighted, the wan weeping willow, All in the dew-fall and the rain. Sometimes the wind lifts the bright stream to her, —Hush thee, babe, while the wild winds blow,— The false stream sinks, and her tears fall faster; Because she touched it her tears fall faster; Over the stream her tears fall faster, All in the sunshine or the rain. The years they come, and the years they go; Sing well-away, sing well-away! And under mine eyes shines the bright life-river; Sing well away, sing well-away! Sweet sounds the spring in the hale green willow, The goodly green willow, the green waving willow; Sweet in the willow, the wind-whispering willow; Sing well-away, sing well-away! But I bend blighted, the wan weeping willow, All in the sun, and the dew, and the rain. SCENE III. The same. A Table covered with MSS. and Books. Balder, solus. Balder. Looking upon the lives of other men, I see them move in apt and duteous signs, That look like cause and consequent, through type And antitype, day after equal day, Year after answering year, from sire to son. But life hath been to me a strange wild dream, Wherein the prodigies that haunt and home Within a human bosom have been brought Marvel by marvel, as to Adam once The monsters of the Earth, that I might name them, And know them, and be friends with them. A youth In years, I hold the weft and woof of age, And wheresoever Time may cut the web, Can find no novel texture. One sole thread Thou owest me, Lachesis! but I will trust thee, Oh thou unfailing debtor! Upon Earth All sights I have beheld but one; all sorrows Either in type or kind endured but one. Death, careful of my learning, hath withstayed His final presence, lest his shade allay My wounds, and, as before the King of Beasts, The lesser horrors of the wilderness Flee at his great approach. I have not seen him, In cause or in effect. But he will come! For till he come my perfect manhood lacks, And this that I was born to do is done By nothing less than man. That I should do it, And be the King of men, and on the inform And perishable substance of the Time Beget a better world, I have believed Up thro' my mystic years, since in that hour Of young and unforgotten exstacy I put my question to the universe, And overhead the beech-trees murmured ‘Yes.’ Therefore I grew up calm like a young god, Having in well-assured serenity No haste to reach and no surprise to wear The inevitable stature; nor thought strange To feel me not as others, to pursue Amid the crowd a solitary way, And take my own in the o'er-peopled world, And find it no man's else. When at the first, Because I was no higher than mankind, All men went past, and no man looked on me, I felt no humbler. When this ample frame Expanded into majesty, and they Who saw fell back admiring, I beheld Their change, not mine; for the unconscious child, Tho' for his childhead he be special child, Is universal man, and in his thoughts Doth glass the future. The thin sapling oak, Hid in the annual herbage of the field, Hath oaken members, and can boast no more When they defy the storms of heaven, and roost The weary-winged Ages. One alone, Early and late,—faithful as she who knows And keeps the secret of the foundling heir— Did bear me witness. Nature from my birth Confessed me, as who in a multitude Confesseth her beloved and makes no sign; Or as one all unzoned in her deep haunts, If her true-love come on her unaware, Hastes not to hide her breast, nor is afraid; Or as a mother 'mid her sons displays The arms their glorious father wore, and, kind, In silence with discerning love commits Some lesser danger to each younger hand, But to the conscious eldest of the house The naked sword; or as a sage amid His pupils in the peopled portico, Where all stand equal, gives no precedence, But by intercalated look and word Of equal seeming, wise but to the wise, Denotes the favoured scholar from the crowd; Or as the keeper of the palace gate Denies the gorgeous stranger and his pomp Of gold, but at a glance, although he come In fashion as a commoner, unstarred, Lets the prince pass. I think my hour is nigh. I am almost equipped; and earth and air Are full of signs. The uncommanded host Of living nations, swaying to and fro Like waves of a great sea that in mid-shock Confound each other, white with foam and fear, Roar for a leader. All this last strange year The clouds seemed higher, and each bird of wing Doubled his usual flight, and the blue arch Opened above, expansive; even as tho' The labouring world drew in a deeper breath, And raised her swelling bosom nearer Heaven With expectation. My prophetic heart Confirmed the omen, and, as ere the crash Of earthquake the dull sun stands clothed upon With sackcloth, and as to his golden head Shorn, I am troubled with the fate not yet Accomplished; an unreasoning melancholy Directs me; I have lingered by the Past As by a death-bed, with unwonted love And such forgiveness as we bring to those Who can offend no more. The very stones Of old memorial have been dear to me, Sitting long days on ancient stiles worm-worn, And gazing thro' green trees o'er grassy graves Upon the living village and the dead, The early and the latter tryst that all Have kept so long and well; or to the pile Reared by those English whose ancestral feet Trod the same path their children's children keep Still hallowed, where the beauty of the vale, The blushing girl of yonder bridal train, Walks in her love and joy, and passing slow Salutes unconscious with her wedding skirt The gable end, no greyer than of yore, When by the same dark yew for ever old, The same grey Time did hold his scythe above Her grandame's head, whose silk of long ago So rustled on the wall when she went by A happy bride, and heard perchance that day Tales from wan lips of the far morning when Her mother's mother passed as fair as she. Or on the leafy and live-long repose Of country labour, and the unhasted life That plods with equal step the wonted way, A-field at morn and homeward slow at eve, And slow with eve and morn through drowsy day Doth toil and feed and sleep and feed and toil. Or on lone homesteads and the untrespassed rest Of immemorial pastures, and the tread Of dreamful herds in verdant peace unvexed And taskless thro' the round of sauntering day, And all the dewy leisure of the meads. As though the coming din of war should scare The tenants of the field, and wildered fear Distract the rural motion, and repeat In bleating folds and trampled harvests loud With dread, the desperate and delirious pulse Of man; and knowing I did look my last Of pastoral quiet, and the passive gait Of ease that is the step of all their world, Their world at pace with solemn things above, With tardy-footed twilight, and all powers Eterne that tread time with celestial wont Immortal, with the seasons of the earth, And with the calm procession of the stars. 'Tis well that on the landmark of to-day I lean awhile, and with clear eyes look back Upon the way I came, ere once again I set forth on my journey to the goal Which I have sworn to win. That bard who lies Like the old knight i' the picture, at the root Of our hereditary tree, (first sire Of the long line where Shakspeare is not last) And by his posture measures height with none, Beheld a ‘House of Fame.’ For me, I seek A sterner architecture and a dome More like the heavens, upon that hill which he Who climbs is strongest among living men, The seat of templed Power. Not Fame but Power. Or Fame but as the noise of Power, a voice That in the face is wind, but in the ear Truth, Knowledge, Wisdom, Question, Speculation, Hope, Fear, Love, Hate, Belief, Doubt, Faith, Despair, Every strong gust that shifts the sails of man, And so far worth the utterance; Fame the paid Muezzin on the minaret of Power, Calling the world to worship; Fame the pied And gilded following of the royal house, Whose function is without, to spread the awe Of Power among the common herd, and hand External homage to the chaste convoy Of them who serve in presence; or at best, An argent herald running on before, Nor daring once to turn his menial mouth To tell me what I know, and whose great trump Tho' it blow Regnarok and wake the graves, Is but a sounding brass. Not Fame but Power. Power like a god's and wielded as a god! I would have been the wind, and unbeheld Rase the tall roaring forest, not the flash That cannot move unseen; the influence Unnamed that finds a city and leaves a tomb, But not the conflagration to flame wide A rabble holiday, round which the Town Gapes, and whereof all men have leave to speak, Cried in the civic streets and parodied In pictures; and for which, at last put out, No hand so base but had availed to do The final deed, nor urchin but hath spat Enough extinction. Whatsoe'er attains In solitude, and out of sight doth sling The stone of practice where no vulgar tongue May cry unskilled applause on the wide throw Of strong attempt, nor ever in men's eyes Hath eminence so young that the kind hand Of popular approval dare be laid Upon its head, I love. The Victory Which hath no mortal opposite to try Conclusions and assess my over-match, I covet. I could wish that the good Powers, Which watched over my making had denied The gifts that quell mankind. I would have gone Into the wilderness, and in some cell Of task severe and exercise divine, Grown god-like till perforce the vigilant gods Seeing me there made me their deputy As being next to them. I would have sat And blessed creation, seeing in calm joy The thankless welfare, and content to know, That from their far thrones, Potentates of Heaven, When a new glory flushed this planet earth Did look to me on mine. Whatever rules By its mere nature and that native place Holding of nought below it, from below Receives nor of accession or decess, Nay by its sovereign essence, is beyond The praise and subject homage of the ruled, I would have been; up from the viewless air That feeds the unconscious world, or this rare life Full in these throbbing veins that moves unfelt The beating heart I feel, to the supreme And central force that sways the universe Unknown, and, being absolute, well pleased Resigns the weight of glory, and permits To shining suns and stars the gorgeous crown, And golden signs of empire. I do think My throne is set. If this next year might bring My one delayed experience! And, that past, End, as with harvest, in some genial close Of happier fortunes! For the fruit of sorrow, Tho' it do grow in the shade ere it be ripe, Asks light and heat, and I am now as when Oblivious Nature holds the time o' year, Brimfull in a dead level of dull days, Till, reaching forth a hand, the sudden sun Touches the cup, and spills upon the earth The mantling season. (Taking up a Manuscript.) Oh thou first, last, work! Thou tardy-growing oak that art to be My club of war, my staff, my sceptre! Thou Hast well nigh gained thine height. My early planned, Long meditate, and slowly-written epic! Turning thy leaves, dear labour of my life, Almost I seem to turn my life in thee. Thy many books my many votive years, And thy full pages numbered with my days. I could look back on all that I have built As on some Memphian monument wherein The kings do lie in glory, every one Each in his house, and forward to thy blank Fair future, as one gazes into depths Of necromantic crystal, and beholds The heavens come down. I think I have struck off One from the weary score of human tasks. Having so told my story in a tongue So common to the ages, that no man In after times shall tell it, but the fact To which I have given voice shall be laid by, And this my sterling with mine image on, Present the ponderous bulk; and I shall leave This history my autograph, wherein The hand that writes is part of what is writ, And I, like the steeped roses of the east, Become the necessary element Of that which doth preserve me. Howsoe'er This be, and whether I attain or fail To add another to those lights of heaven That rule our day and night,—to set a sun Of joy above us, or some saddest moon Whose pale reflected rays, from their first aim And primal course bent back and contravert Like some Apollo's golden shaft returned From an opposing bow, shall still bespeak The splendour of their quiver—I do feel I have deserved to win. Thought, Labour, Patience, And a strong Will, that being set to boil The broth of Hecate would shred his flesh Into the cauldron, and stir deep with arms Flayed to the seething bone ere there default One tittle from the spell—these should not strive In vain! No. I have lived what I have sung, And it shall live. The flashes of the fire Are fire, that which was soul is spirit still, And shall not die. I sat above my work As God above the new unpeopled world Sat and foresaw our days, and sun and cloud Of good and ill passed o'er the countenance Ineffable, and filled the plains below; Smiled all a floral kingdom thro' the world, Or frowned a race of lions. With the year That ended yesterday, I close the book Of mortal contest, and begin to sing Record of the aërial tournaments Whereof we are but shadows, on the fields Where spirit meets with spirit, and god with god. And first thee, Death,—— Enter Servant, with post-bag. Letters! (Opens and reads.) Balder (after a long pause). Oh men, oh men, What are ye that I yearn to you, and ye To me, but that no grasp of mortal love Against the strong enribbed heart can break The mystic band that limits each from each, Nor sternest edifice of separate life Can wholly shut ye out? If nought can make Us one, why can we not be twain in peace? Why do you touch me, why do your kind eyes, Unasked, look into mine? Why does your breath Fall warm upon me, and infect my veins With strange commotion? Is it to be borne, That ye will neither enter into me, Nor leave me? that men look upon my face, And take me for another; that I know Your wants before you tell them, feel the pains You feel; give language to your secret bliss Better than you who know it? That ye cure My bodily ailments with the selfsame drug That heals the fool; that he who should cut off This right hand with nice science, that foreknows Each sequent vein and muscle, learned his skill Upon a felon? That my last death-sob Will be much like what any hangman hears, And that the very meanest lips alive Do speak some word of mine? Thou happy God, That hast no likeness, wherefore hast Thou made Me thus? Have I not gone into unknown Unentered lands, and heard in alien tongue Strange man unto strange man unload his heart, And started in my soul, and said, ‘Eh ghost! Art thou I?’ Am I one and every one, Either and all? The innumerable race, My Past; these myriad-faced men my hours? What! have I filled the earth, and knew it not? Why not? How other? Am I not immortal? And if immortal now, immortal then; And if immortal then, existent now; But where? Thou living moving neighbour, Man, Art thou my former self—me and not me? Did I begin, and shall I end? Was I The first, and shall I one day, as the last, Stand in the front of the long file of man, And looking back, behold it winding out, Far thro' the unsearched void, and measuring time Upon eternity, and know myself Sufficient, and, that like a comet, I Passed thro' my heaven, and fill'd it? [Through the door are heard the rocking of a cradle, and the voice of Amy.] Amy (singing) The cuckoo-lamb is merry on the lea, The daisied lea; I would I were the lamb! While that the lark will pipe, the lamb will dance, And when the lark is mute he danceth still; Up springs the lark, and pipes again for joy! He, more by birth, than we by toil and skill, Is happy with no labour but to live; He leapeth early, and he leapeth late; He leapeth in the sunshine and the rain, Nor fears the hour that will not find him blest, And milky plenty sauntering by his side. Also the lamb that doth not toil nor spin, Lies where he will, and where he lieth sleeps. Sleeps on the hill-top like a cloud o' the hill, Sleeps where the trembling Lily of the Vale, Albeit she is so spotless, sleepeth not, But like a naked fairy fears all night The wind that for her beauty cannot sleep. Sleeps on the nettle or the violet: Or where the sun doth warm his trance with light, Or where the runnel murmureth cool dreams, Or where the eglantine not yet in bloom, Like a sweet girl full of her sweeter thought, Reveals unheard the sweetness still to be. Or where the darnel nods, and, as they tell Of beauty nursed upon a savage dug, Sucks grace from the harsh bosom of the waste. Sleeps in the meadow buttercups at noon, —A babe a-slumber in a golden crib— Or like a daisy by the way-side white, And like a daisy quieteth the way. The lamb, the lamb, I would I were the lamb! Balder (musing). Thou most pure And guileless voice. I never breathed thee! No, Thou meek misfortune, thou art not my past. My Amy, my own Amy, whom of old I found as a wild sailor of the sea Comes on some happy isle of Love and Peace, Some isle where joys that in all other climes, Sweet flying thro' the night of his dark way, A moment rest upon his sail, pass on, And are beheld no more, in equal haunts And bright assured communion ever dwell, Day without night, and native, brood and sing! Thou who thro' the stern ordeal of this life Didst cling beside me, while I showed my power, And turned the dust and ashes where I stood, To gold and ruby, so that the great throng Cried out for envy, and with murderous shout Demanded the pure jewel I had not, And when I trembled, knowing that mine art Was ended, and the clamorous people saw, Unseen didst slide thy wealth into my hand And save me, so that I, serene, unclosed My palm before the Judge, and lo! a pearl; My first Love and my last, so far so near, So strong, so weak, so comprehensible In these encircling arms, so undescribed In any thought that shapes thee; so divine, So softly human that to either stretch, Extreme and farthest tether of desire It finds thee still; my ministering saint, Attendant sprite, enshrined Egeria! My ornament, my crown, my Indian gem And incommunicable amulet Upon my breast, not me but warm with me! (pauses.) You heavens! how far a little breath may blow The unstable bubble of inflated thought! O voice, O little voice, what power of thine Disbands my hosts, which, as a crowd of shades That scatter at a word, in sudden rout Like the four winds unloosed have sprung apart And vanished into distance, until I, Whose royal and innumerable train Out-trooped the legioned gods, am left alone As one uncounted? How those charmèd walls, And airy castles, that we rear to hold The powers that plague us, and do well contain Imprisoned fiends, are pervious to the touch Of any human hand! That we should build them, And a mere child should put his vital finger Thro' the main bulwark! That the head should write, And, with a gush of living blood, the heart Should blot it! As one proves there is no God And falls upon his knees. Right sapient sage! Supreme intelligence! Sole substantive! Lord of the empty dark! True Prince of Nil And Nihilo! a royal argument; But ere thou sign triumphant demonstration Be blest and let a benefit refute thee! My little Amy! [Exit. SCENE IV. The Empty Study. Through the half-open Door is heard the voice of Amy. Amy. My lord, that walkest thro' the universe, Did I not go beside thee, as a child, With humble step and looking to thy face? My king, who reignest wheresoe'er thou art! All do thy hest, my King! but who as I? Hast thou not all thy subjects here in me? My husband, who hast loved me like a god, And blessed me, surely I did well to love Thee as a god?—but can a god forget? Wherein have I offended? Nay, thy brow Is sweet and cloudless—I have done no ill. My husband, have I not been still thy bird, Thy dove, thy snow-white dove, upon thy wrist, Or in thy breast, or feeding from thy lips, Or round thine head, or fluttering with fond feint Before thy footsteps—with mine eyes on thee? Was I not as a lamb around thy feet, That loved thee? For my neck thou didst entwine Sweet garlands and I followed thee, nor knew The inexorable sadness, till a door Opened, and thou art among men, and I Am but a lamb, and bleat about the gate. My husband, I have been an orphan fawn That ran beside the cubless lioness; Who spared her, and did make with her what sport Befits the offspring of the forest king. And the poor fawn still gambolled in her blood. Have I not been a moth about thy light Scorched, scorched; but, husband! when the wound was worst, Winging with madder passion still to thee! Wert thou not always as a crescent moon, And I thy star within thee, till the time Came, and the lengthening distance, and I knew My rising and my setting were not thine. Oh was I not a floweret in thine hand When thou didst stand upon the peak of thought Gazing to heaven, which with a thunder-shock Rolled back, and angels came to thee, and thou Didst stretch to them thine open hands uplift In welcome, and I fell to where I am. I think they touched thine eyes, and that thenceforth Thou seest all things clearly, and me here, Nor knowest it is very far from thee. Oh husband! it is night here in the vale, And I lie on the rugged earth who had Thy bosom; moreover I cannot hear Thy voice, nor tho' thou seest me can I see Thy face. It is not with me as with thee; The shadows here are always long and deep, Also the night comes sooner than to thee. SCENE V. The Study. Balder, at his writing-table. Balder. Death, thou must stand aside! The mood is not Upon me, and my gold is only dug I'the vein. The microcosmos, like its twin, Hath climates and their seasonable fruits. My brain is warm, and I behold the sun; Clear as a pulsing wave of hyaline, And I cry ‘Light;’ tender and beautiful As the west waiting for the evening star, And loveliness, like a fair girl, comes forth Into the dewy silence. As I throb The sense responds, and, like a courtier's eyes, Finds for each royal folly of my soul Portentous reason. The disordered fact Outruns its antecedent, and so much Eternity within doth set at nought The wont of time, that I am stirred yet ere Disturbance, and do suffer by the ill Not yet admitted to the sum of things. I will await what figure now unseen Is to rise up and lay his charmed hand Upon this inner harp, from string to string Already trembling, and arrive, tho' late, To give a name to that foredone effect Which else had lacked a father. [He meditates, writes, and reads aloud. ‘Then saw I Genius, blind, with upturned face, As one who hears, and to the struggling sense (Tottering beneath accomplishment, and faint In touch of the inestimable prize) Each from his office brings her conscript powers Auxiliar, and in strained conflux sustains The sole perception; happy so to gain The one sufficient knowledge, and therein Utterly blessed. Like a listening saint Lifting her wrapt brow to the audible Heaven. Nor sightless by defect, but that her lids Closed o'er the needless eyes. Her moving lips Perfunctory incessant murmur made, And thus she held her unrespective way, Following the upper sound which no man heard, Summer and winter, day and night; but more Like a sweet madness in those dearer times Where?n the hornèd seasons fill and wane, Spring, autumn. morn, and eve; o'er hill and alp, Forest and city, steep and battlement, Or wrought or native; through vales, gulphs, and ca And midnight solitudes, and martial plains, And sun, and storm, and frost, and flood, and fire.’ Bah, is this Genius who should rule the world And be incarnate God? Rather, methinks, Some maimed celestial, feeling back her way To the lost heavens, or that fair Eve whom once Genius, what time she ‘listened to the voice,’ Caught in his arms in Eden. (Turning to a statue.) Listening Eve! What marvel that my spell-bound fancy drew The captive, not the captor? As the earth Revolves, and we behold the vanished stars Of yesterday, that, being fixed, remain To gladden lands beyond us, so in thee, Immortal! this our Present, wondering, comes Round to the sight of long lost Paradise, And all the primal act. And we go down To death, but thou, fast held, remainest to rise On other times, and, orient by our fall, Shalt light the orb of ages. Thou rare power. Sluggard, ungrateful, wayward, false, and vain, Whom men call Muse! I cannot fetter thee, But I can punish. Back into the void, And bring me what I seek? [He writes. Now what art thou, Genius? (reads.) ‘There came a chariot o'er the earth, Swift on strange wheels, such as eye hath not seen, Nor can see, in the speed of their great course Viewless, but leaving tracks which nations ran To wonder at. Whether o'er rugged rocks Passing, and turning all their streams to tears Sad down the channelled visage of the hills; Or o'er the level sea, whirling strange dews And rainbows to a luminous mist, wherein Mermaids in sportive companies made play Beneath their dark hair, till the heaving sea Blushed like a cloudy morn, and dolphins leaped, And Triton mounted on a foaming wave Sounded pursuit; or o'er the beaten road Of daily use raising a dust that fell Upon the things that were, and made them new. (The clime cleared, and on either hand the path Arcadian did spontaneous holiday Prankt with its herbs of grace. Fair sun and moon, From signs of fortune with consenting stars In sweet succession, or conjunctions rare Shone festal round the car, while Time himself Grew young, and ran before. Fierce beasts that shun The common sunshine, rose, and each subdued, Moved to the genial light, from his dark den Approaching tame by every forest glade, Where Una led the lion. Nor rude race Of daily men, that like a city flood, Came headlong heedless mixed in civic din, Escaped the spell; nor touched the enchanted ground But sudden as to music in the air, Grave measured step and custom of the gods O'ertook them—Salian and Œnoplian dance Heroic, and the front of golden days.) Or whether over Alpine solitudes Ploughing such record as nor mountain storms That rage midway, nor high above the thunder The ceaseless snows of silent centuries Efface; or crossing immemorial plains Indentured where the furrows fill with flowers As with a Tyrian rain; where'er on earth It found the barren wilderness, and left Eden—if Eden was the rosy prime, The master passion, and first ecstasy Of this our world. Nor drawn by steed, nor steered By human hand, it came an empty car To the embattled people as of will, And took its martial station in the van, And post of honour. Then the mighty men Climbed, venturous, its crystal sides wherein The changing tumult of the mirrored field Shone, like opposing armies. But behold A marvel! for the empty car was full, And none could enter. Therefore moved with fear And jealous doubt, they called the legions round To thrust it forth, which passive in the midst Stood stirless—tho' still wheeled the wheeling wheels Invisible with motion. But when spears Were couched and charging, sudden from the ground Wingless it rose! and all the baffled host Fell with deceived expectance. As it rose Slow thro' the day, the wondrous wheels being still Hung in the air, and the great multitude With upturned eyes amazed at once cried out Their likeness, and of countless voices each Belied its neighbour. But the car sublime Above the round horizons, each on each Widening like circles in the stagnant sea Of space disturbed, showed like a lesser world Dyed with the coloured earth, and as it went Heavenward, and we astonished still beheld, Lo! we were ware as of a countenance Unspeakable, and as of burning hands Waving farewells, and somewhat of a form Sitting within the brightness. Then convulsed With shame, both of their tardy eyes obscure And lost revenge, from instant bows and slings, Artillery and every loud offence, Sudden the universal host upsent Impotent rage. As tho' the earth that lay A sleeping beast, sprang up, and with a roar Shaking his shaggy hide, with thickest dust Darkened the air. Then the mysterious wheels Whirled in the sky; the burning hands uplift Pointed to Heaven; and the tremendous car Launched thro' the seas of light, and passed the noon As the mere yellow strand whence it set sail To sea; careering as to reach the goal Of all things, and come back. And, as it passed, He whom we saw threw out a golden chain, And linked the sun, and led him from his lair Obedient, while night fell on earth; and He Shot thro' the darkness and was lost. But soon, —Himself unseen—I knew his viewless way, Thro' the stirred Heavens where I saw the stars Leaving their spheres, till as it were a host Of meteors shone across the streaming sky. Nor him victorious long the toil delayed, But on a time thro' all the flaming air Rose the large dawn of his far-off return, And as it rose and rose embraced the earth Into a breast of glory; such great day Began the morning as if life had changed Its metre, heaving nature had attained To grander issues, and a rounded year Came up the ampler east. And Him I saw Rushing upon the Orient; in his train, Fierce as reluctant lions dragged at speed Behind a victor,—all their forest-brood Roaring around and leaping—captive suns Attend him, and their wild and scattered moons Whiten the air. Then the pale nations cast Dust on their heads, and hid their dazzled eyes, And over all a great sound, full of death, Shrieked like a plague-wind from a battle-field, Noisome with mortal horror thro' the land. “Woe, woe, we cast him from us in his day, And now he will return to take the world And burn it in his fury!”’ (Throws the MS. to the ground.) Lie thou there! Genius is yet unwritten. [Through the door is heard the voice of Amy. Happy eve, happy eve! But the mavis singing in the eve, Singeth for the silence of the eve. Happy flower, happy flower, But the golden secret of the flower, Hidden honey sweeter than the flower. Happy moon, happy moon, But the loving moonlight of the moon, Tender wonder fairer than the moon. Little child, little child, As the evening mavis unto me, As the twilight mavis unto me. Little child, little child, As the hidden honey unto me, As the golden honey unto me. Little child, little child, As the wondrous moonlight unto me, As the better moonlight unto me. SCENE VI. The Vacant Study. Through the open Door the voice of Amy. Amy. Sleep thee, my child, altho' when thou didst sleep And shut thine eyes methought the world was blind. Sleep thee, my child, altho' thy mother wakes, Sleep, happy babe, upon a woeful breast. Oh, babe, I can endure to live; oh babe, I see thee thro' the anguish of my years Like a star rising thro' the smoke of hell. Oh babe, I have escaped to thee beyond, Beyond the present torture, calm and sweet; A moment, and I reck not of the fiends. And I am bathed in dews, and in thy sphere Thou bearest me naked of all my woes Which burn upon me, babe, but are not me. My vesture is on fire; all all in vain, In vain I tear it, knotted strong and deep With chains more cruel than the flames, in vain I run and fan them in the wind of life. A moment I am free beyond the years! Thou risest, oh my star, and I to thee! A moment, and the flesh must needs be here, And the fierce anguish knotted to the flesh, And I am like a spirit in thine urn, Cool thro' the balmy shades of painless heaven. Sleep, sleep, my babe, thou shalt not cry me nay; Sleep, sleep, my babe, my babe, while it is night, Ah, who shall say the morn may not be fair? Sleep, little babe, and let my terror sleep! Oh sleep awhile, and stop the wheels of fate. I think that there is privilege in woe, And sorrow may not seize us everywhere, And havoc doth not hunt where'er he list, And sleep is halcyon time when griefs are still. Sleep, sleep, my babe, and let me clasp thee fast And know a little space thou canst not die, Nor earth nor heaven or plots or works thine ill. Sleep, sleep, my babe, my babe, and let me hold My destiny a moment in mine arms, Nor find it heavier than can rise and fall Harmless as thou upon my heaving breast. Alas! alas! the vision of my youth! When that I lifted not mine eyes to pray, But I beheld HIM thro' the cloudless air, Walking as on a morning mountain-top Transfigured, with the azure clothed about, Nor on a higher earth, but lower heaven! Sleep, sleep, my babe, and dream thy mother's dream, That all her joy may be contained in thee. He stood in light, he stood in blinding light! I loved, I climbed to reach him where he stood, I the weak woman, I the child of clay! I fell; to see him, from the beetling brink, Stretching for ever unavailing arms To her who, as in dreams, for ever falls. Oh hapless, hapless heart, too proud to fall! Oh hapless, hapless limbs, too frail to climb! Heart of these limbs, how couldst thou be so proud? Oh limbs, how could ye mate so proud a heart? Sleep, sleep, my babe, and dream thy mother's dream, And if to wake like her, oh wake no more! If thou couldst grow what once I prayed to be, If I could see a daughter at his side, And he might look upon himself more fair, And all her mother with a kinder fate! Tho' I have failed and fallen in the race, Thou shalt redeem me, and with better limbs Contend. And I will kneel and shew my scars, And make too memorable with my tears Each treacherous fortune where thy mother fell. And break with mine own hands her image fair, And show her to thine eyes so wan and weak, Crazed with waste life and unavailing days. And stir thee, blushing with her penitence, And in the fire of a great love and woe Become as nought before thee, that thou, Babe, Inherit from her ashes, and arise Triumphant from the pyre, and so in death I load thee with my hopes, and win in thee! Awake, awake, my babe, my only babe, Sleep not too deeply, babe, thou art my heart, And only by its pulse I know I live. SCENE VII. The Study. Balder, writing. Balder (reads). ‘I stood and did not dream. Before me was the great plain, and behind The long dark mountains over which the sun Held noon; and as I stood the earth till now All summer trembled, and beyond the ridge A pulsing murmur as of coming seas On echoing shores from out a further void, Grew in the far dim distance, as once more Old ocean made invasion, and advanced With all his waves. And as a dreamer hears What sounding on her fleeing track pursues The frantic soul that in the panic dies, In louder progress, strepitous, so came The great approach. Whereat the agued earth With deadly fear did shiver to her core. And the sound rose, and her great dread became Convulsion, and the rampant uproar beat Wilder alarum on the battered ear, Swift waxing to the tumult of a host Charging to battle all on serried steeds That stepped as one. I strained to the event With eye-balled sight as to a cry i' the dark, And all the unseen pursuit more near enraged, —The panting terror and the throbbing chase,— Wilder as if the beating heart o' the world In palpitation mad and moribund Huge in its quaking tenement did shake Th' enribbed rocks. And—as me, utterless, Strong tumult choked, and sick expectance pale, And horror of the end—a louder blast Rush'd o'er, and sudden at a thunder peal, As tho' the loaded sound did with a roar Discharge its cause, while the great herd that grazed The summits parted like a scattered flock Beneath a lion, somewhat leaped the hills, The awful hills, and on the shattered plain Came like the crash of doom! Riderless he, Who can bestride him? Tho' his reeking flanks Sonorous clang with loud caparison Of sounding war. A moment, and he stands Heightened with pride, dilate at haughty gaze, His swelling frame to half the horizon round Breathing defiance; fierce his levelled head Equals the clouds; his eye is as a hot And bloody star; his nostrils as the red Round throat of fiery ordnance, and his snort Ten thousand clarions. Such a steed, so wild, Left, in some ancient battle of the gods, Great Mars unhorsed. And now as one who sees His foe beyond the river, with a plunge Divides the waters, he with sudden spring From the recoiling fields that reeled and broke, Breasted the big spent clouds that, faint with flight, Each upon each lay cumulous, and thro' That sundered sea, tremendous, a mile hence, Swift as a bolt and heavy as a hill, Shocked the rent plain, and in as wild rebound, Leaped in mere strength a thousand fathoms high, Lashing new winds, and, wanton in descent, Spurning far heaven with upslung vehemence Of impious heels; and gnashing rooted oaks, Wilful did fling them into either sky Like loathed grass. Then sudden in career He stretched across the flats. His mighty limbs Resulting in the plunge from rest to speed Caverned whereon he stood, and left his place Mixed in tumultuous ruin. As he went His hot hoofs thundering filled the fatal air Recalcitrant, and scattered rocks and stones, Crushed hall and hamlet, trampled tower and town, Aye peaceful earth, and sods that nursed the lamb, Red with the trodden flocks, in hurtled death Swept the disastrous land. As when some mine, Dark filled with sulphurous slaughter, at a nod Belching its storm, o'er whelms in sudden wreck The startled siege. O'er all the wide expanse The wondrous swift concussion of his course Sped desolation; far and near I saw How dust-clouds, hovering like the pestilence, Marked fallen cities, that on either hand Confessed the unseen commotion where he passed. And round the extremest verge dim rocks were rent, And him in distance lost a sound betrayed, The loud world groaned within as the great cry Of crushed mankind proclaimed the track of “War.”’ SCENE VIII. The Vacant Study. Through the open door the voice of Amy. Amy. Is there no hostel by the way of life? My wayfare was from far as I can see; As far my toil is hot and white before; I stagger with my load, and halt midway, And trembling turn beseeching eyes and vain Backward and forward from my pitiless place. The weary miles lie infinite beyond, And each might be the future and the past. I would lay down my burden lest I die. Is there no hostel by the way of life? SCENE IX. The Study. Balder, at his writing-table. Balder. This very morn Thro' her green island home the laughing spring Drove, flinging joy, her blossom-laden car. Forth from the polar cavern of the snows, Dripping with winter, leaped a northern storm, And shook himself; and she lay buried white Beneath an avalanche. At that dread sight Up rose the West, and such a wind went by As stunned the isle with voices, like a chief Rushing to battle with a sounding host In shouting ranks wide on the echoing hills. At first a roar of warning, ‘to the north!’ Then like the shriek of all a ravished land, ‘O Europe, Europe, Europe, Europe, Europe!’ And then like the world's trumpet blown to war, ‘The North, the North, the North, the North, the North!’ Enter, under the window, wandering Sailors, singing. Sailors. ‘How many?’ said our good Captain. ‘Twenty sail and more.’ We were homeward bound, Scudding in a gale with our jib towards the Nore. Right athwart our tack, The foe came thick and black, Like Hell-birds and foul weather—you might count them by the score. The Betsy Jane did slack To see the game in view. They knew the Union-Jack, And the tyrant's flag we knew! Our Captain shouted ‘clear the decks!’ and the Bo'sun's whistle blew. Then our gallant Captain, With his hand he seized the wheel, And pointed with his stump to the middle of the foe. ‘Hurrah, lads, in we go!’ (You should hear the British cheer, Fore and aft.) ‘There are twenty sail,’ sang he, ‘But little Betsy Jane bobs to nothing on the sea!’ (You should hear the British cheer, Fore and aft.) ‘See yon ugly craft With the pennon at her main! Hurrah, my merry boys, There goes the Betsy Jane!’ (You should hear the British cheer, Fore and aft.) The foe, he beats to quarters, and the Russian bugles sound; And the little Betsy Jane she leaps upon the sea. ‘Port and starboard!’ cried our Captain; ‘Pay it in, my hearts!’ sang he. ‘We're old England's sons, And we'll fight for her to-day!’ (You should hear the British cheer, Fore and aft.) ‘Fire away!’ In she runs, And her guns Thunder round. [Exeunt Sailors. Balder. As he who turns From the full-shining and white orb of noon Sees a black sun in air, this chant of Freedom Leaves in my soul its hideous contrary. [Pauses. Be patient, Death, for if not thee I paint, None but thine immemorial minister, Thy dear abortion whom thy craft sent here That by his side thou mayst look good and fair, Prevents thine honours. My poor goosequill! Bah! Had I a pen plucked where Celæno flies Uncleanest! My old ink-horn!—why thou drop Of rheum! thou milk-pot!— [Writes and then reads. Lo Tyranny! a Juggernaut than he Who makes an Indian Bacchanal blush blood At his unuttered hideousness more foul. Nor on a car of India, but upborne Upon a monstrous shape for which the brood Of creeping reptiles, or the noisome plagues Egyptian found no type, nor Hydra old, Nor fell Chimæra. High the idol sat, Gore-stained, nor arm to seize, nor leg to stand Had he, but from his beast his branchless trunk Rose festerous thro' the morning. What he rode Headless came onward, manifold and one As a dishevelled legion, and far off Showed like a galley of ten thousand oars In numberless commotion, nor in stroke Ordered, but with division infinite Beating the air; for round its dreadful length Such moving arms innumerous like a fry Of twining fiery Pythons plied the earth Incessant, and, alternate feet and hands, Bore the black bulk, or with contentious haste Incredible, before, beside, behind, In manifold appearance all too slow To feed consumption, filled the ghastly maw Of him who sat above, and eyes had none, Nor human front, nor but a mouth obscene, Abominable, that for ever yawned Insatiate, drivelling from its carrion sides Infernal ichor. Wide the cavern gaped, Still straining wider, and thro' gurgling weight Of seething full corruption night and day His craving bowels, famished in his fill, Bellowed for more. Which, when the creature heard That bore him, dread, like a great shock of life, Convulsed it, and the myriad frantic hands Sprang like the dances of a madman's dream. And so he came; and o'er his head a sweat Hung like a sulphurous vapour, and beneath Fetid and thunderous as from belching hell, The hot and hideous torrent of his dung Roared down explosive, and the earth, befouled And blackened by the stercorous pestilence, Wasted below him, and where'er he passed The people stank. SCENE X. The Vacant Study. Through the open door the voice of Amy. Amy. Neither gold nor silver, oh ye heavens! Only a little sunshine and sweet air, The sunshine and the air of the old days! Only to be a feather on the stream, A thistle-plume upon the changing wind Hither and thither; to go to and fro And up and down the joyance of the world, The happy world, and be a part of all. Ye are now unto me, oh ye bright heavens, As one who should misuse the deaf and blind In secret, but full loud when men are by Speaketh rich words of love into the ears That hear not, and before the sightless eyes Makes vain ado of all they cannot see. I pray ye ope the lattice of my soul And let the wind blow on me ere I die, And let me hold my forehead to the light, And let me feel the falling of the dews, And know the holy blessing of the rain! SCENE XI. The Vacant Study. Through the open door the voice of Amy. Amy. My babe, my babe, when thou art grown to age, What will thy speech avail thee among men? Thy father-land speaks not thy mother-tongue. For loving me, and thou wilt love me, babe, I shall be still thy book, and all thy words Of love and gladness thou shalt spell in me. And loving me—and thou wilt love me, babe, Shall I not be thy beauty and thy good? And thou wilt seek mine image in the earth, And make thy world of all things likest me. Thou wilt not make day night, nor night thy day, But dwell in the unvalued parts of day. Shadow shall be thy light, and light thy shade. What men forget, thou wilt remember well, And all they know and love thou wilt forget. Also, poor babe, thou wilt not hear the birds Of morning, but if any night fowl wail Far in the lonely hills, thou wilt awake, And I shall see thee listen in my breast! Nor shall thine eye pursue the butterflies, Nor joy in shining beetle, nor humming bee; But thou wilt clap thine hands to feel the bat Stirring the twilight; and at hoot of owl Shalt laugh and leap as at a mother's voice. Also when thou shalt go upon thy feet, Thy tiny feet beside me, well I know Thou wilt not bring me daisies, nor sweet cups Of gold and pearl, nor ever-ringing bells. But we shall pass the flowery banks and braes, Unheeded as a winter—thou and I. Thy little footstep will be old and staid, And thou wilt gaze upon the ground like me. And I shall see thee stoop for withered straws, And every joyless waif the wind lets fall. I think thou wilt not pass a blighted leaf Dead in the dust: and I shall lead thee by The churchyard yew with lingering gaze and long Reluctant; I shall sit me down and weep, And thou wilt climb my lap, and deck my head With garlands, till I tremble at thy glee, And lift my hands to find—hemlock and rue. Also, poor babe, these walks that once I loved And tended shall have nought for thee in spring Or summer, but thy childish eye shall light With knowledge when in any plot unseen December brings the thorn that flowers in vain, Or hellebore, like a girl-murderess, Green-eyed and sick with jealousy, and white With wintry thoughts of poison. All the year Thou wilt be doleful in the planted beds And bowers, but a strange sense shall draw thee where Whatever nook that never saw the sun Is dark and cold, with undescended dews And saddest moss, and mildew of the wood And wall, and livelong orpine that cannot die. Moist ivy, and inglorious moschatel Like a blind beggar 'neath a upas-tree Sickening below the nightshade. And thine heart Shall fill thee, and thou shalt be rich and glad As at a garden! Oh my babe, my babe, That wert to be his glory and his joy, The flower of women and the star of men. Latest of mortal daughters, and the best. The final Eve to sum up once for all The loveliness of woman, and touch lips With her who first began us; the born theme Of all the poets since the world was new, Who singing as they could still sang of her, And knowing only she must be, knew not Or when or where. She, she, that was to come In the whole image of the Beautiful, Between the attending Loves, and bear aloft Wisdom and knowledge as a wreathèd lyre That sounds but with her going, trembling sweet In trembling garlands; or with bolder hand Run o'er all noble arts as one runs o'er A nine-stringed harp, and at her changing will, Equal in each, be every Muse in turn, And multiply the Graces as she moved! His words are on my lips, my babe, my babe, He sang them to me, child, in olden days, Till I sprang up before him, full of pride, And reeled, and fell, and mourned until thou camest, And ever since have sung his song to thee. And thou wilt grow like me, my babe, my babe, And he shall seek and seek thro' all the earth, Nor see his heart's desire until he die! Will no one snatch thee from my bosom, babe, And save thee from thy mother? Do not love me, No, do not love me, no, no, do not love me, No, do not love me; 'tis the lullaby I'll sing all day. No, do not love me, no, No, do not love me. Dost thou waken, babe? Hush, hush, rebellious! Is my breast so hard A pillow? Nay, what ails thy mother's milk? Ah, dost thou turn from me, my little babe? Does the spell work already? Love me, love me! Love me, my babe, lest I go mad with fear! SCENE XII. The Study. Balder, at his writing-table. Balder. The great array is marshalled; on the right Freedom, Truth, Justice, Mercy, Love, and Peace Captained by Genius, stand under the broad Standard of day held by the east and west With sanguine hands and high. In horrid rank Sinister, front to hostile front opposed Beneath a banner dark as if black winds Of chaos rose in tempest and did blow The billowy verge of everlasting night O'er the celestial border, glare the host That follow the blind Power whose headless beast Some evil god directs. Above his crest Driven in the inevitable storm behind, Like lambent flames of darkness licking far The middle air, his terrible ensign Roars to the coming war. They stand at gaze, Expecting till the equal voice of Death Midway between the fierce and serried vans Give signal of advance. But his great place Is empty, and the crowded action waits. Through the door comes the voice of Amy. Amy (sings). Up went the jaunty jay, Bough by bough, bough by bough, Up went the jaunty jay, Up the tall tree. Up the tall tree where a happy bird was singing, By his mossy home was singing, To his callow brood was singing In the green tree; In the tall tree-top, in the merry tree-top, —Alas, so merry! In the brave tree-top, Waving to and fro. As a gay gallant up the stairs of pleasure, By leaps the jaunty jay went up the tree. Thou knowest, O mother bird! for thou wert by, O mother-bird, thy young, thy callow young! When he stood o'er them as one stands at meat, Did they not lift their heads up as to thee? And like a fruit he plucked them one by one, —The jay, the shining jay, the jocund jay;— In the tall tree-top, in the merry tree-top, —Alas, so merry!— In the brave tree-top, Waving to and fro. Like a gay gallant from a ruined maiden, The painted jay came smirking down the tree. Oh bird, oh crying bird, oh mother bird, Oh childless bird, could I not die for thee? Yes, I could die for thee! SCENE XIII. The Study. Balder, at his writing-table. Balder. Had it been my portion here With these obedient limbs and iron aid Of some unconscious instrument to dig The unquestionable soil, so that this hand Thus armed should with no further cost than throes Of definite volition—as to grasp, To sink, to raise,—complete the stated dues Of daily labour! Were I born to plough, While the lark drops upon his meal, the long Material black and measurable furrow, Whereof the brute sense of returning steer, Treading the line, observant, testifies That it is made indeed, and grossest clown Who holds two eyes in use is a critic Superfluously endowed! Happier to drive The patient ass along the beaten way, Laden with humble fruits to the set mart Of fixed reward, and back to certain rest, And sweet assured possession, than like me Bound helpless on the fury of the winds, To scour the plains I seek not, scale the height Where my brain swims, and leap, as in a dream, Down into the unfathomable void, While from the fall—like my back-streaming hair— Fear-blown in all my veins the blood streams back, And faints with horror. I that am called proud, Lying most humbly weary and abject On the immoveable earth that doth so please This mortal frame, and seeing my dull race Doing their easy pleasures to and fro, Self-ordinate, could sometimes sell my birth-right For any pottage that would feed the flesh Of other men upon me. Death, Death, Death! I have seen every face but thine to-day! And to behold thee, from sunrise till now, How have I strained these eyeballs! [Exit. Through the open door comes the voice of Amy. Amy. A pool in a deep valley at dead noon, Lidless and shadeless like a burning eye, Low lieth looking at the summer sun: So in my bosom, oh my babe, my babe, Thou liest low, and lookest up to me. SCENE XIV. The Study. Balder (solus) at his writing-table. Balder. My heart is heavy. This it is to speak On Alpine heights, and with the profane breath Of innocent words, to bring the avalanche Upon my human head. I might have known That he who treads these altitudes must walk As from the mansions of eternal snow I have beheld two customary stars Go forth in sovereign converse, like to gods, But seen to speak, not heard. A dread is on me As in a mortal illness, when the flesh Knows in the air the coming dart, and shakes With terror. I have called so loud and long Into the twilight cave of Mystery; And now at length, when thro' the cavernous dark I hear far answering feet, my stout heart sinks. That Dream! As some wild legendary rhyme Heard on a grandame's knee, that being at end Is still again begun, while at each turn O' the winding tale the listener, cowering low, Whispers the wonted question, to receive More cold and pale the expected old reply That lifts another hair, I ponder o'er My strange adventure, and do press and wring The mirk and husk of memory. Once again I'll fill the cup to the enchanted brim And drink it slowly. Yesterday I sat From early morn till dark and strove in vain To see the face of Death. And in the night I dreamed. Methought I stood within this room, As on the day when first I saw it grey And empty; o'er my head a single branch Of ivy threaded the high wall and hung In green possession. And medreamed I stood Robed like a necromancer, and with spells Called on the name of Death. The wizard's store Hung at my girdle, and on this last prize I spent it sternly with the desperate hand Of him who will be Prince or Beggar—each New spell was more tremendous than the last. At first there was great silence thro' the cell, And then the cell was moved, tho' nothing stirred, But under the gross visible I knew An inner perturbation, as the crowd Before the curtain feel the viewless scene Inscrutable which heaves the swaying folds That roll the mystery from stage to roof, And roof to stage. And then a hush like death; And thro' the hush a somewhat in the air Twisting and falling; and I looked and saw The ivy-branch, and all the branch was bare, And the broad leaves lay shrivelled on the ground. The fourth time the strong silence in the cell Was as the straining silence of the rack, When the still-tightening torture wrenches him Who will not speak. The great veins in my brow Throbbed with suppression, and such consciousness I had of coming uproar, rising up Thro' the containing stillness—as the fire Of Ætna swells under her dark blind hill And bursts in desolation—that my lips Cried out. As if the sudden whip of Hell Flashed on a pack of demons caught asleep, The place brake silence, and a naked shriek Came thro' the right-hand wall and, shrieking, passed Out on the left, and when I called, returned, Still shrieking, and so out upon the right, And to and fro until my deafened brain Reeled, and I fell down flat and slept as dead. Then to me, sleeping, in my ear, these words, Not as from outer nature, yet in voice Not mine, tho' nearer to me than the ear That heard it, as if in my head the blood Along the intricate deep veins did hiss A whisper and fled shivering to the heart. ‘Bring me the inflated skin thou callest Life, And I will turn the wind-bag inside out And clothe me.’ I am not the fool of dreams, Yet hold it not incredible that things Are seen before their time, and,—as to-night In this strange vision, where, while all was still I felt the undelivered silence swell— Somewhat to be lies in the womb of Now, And eyes unstayed by mortal obscuration Behold at once the Mother and the Child. A white skin and the sweet fair-seeming flesh Shut back the common eye-sight; but there be Who looking fast on the unblushed repose Of Beauty—where she lieth bright and still As some spent angel, dead-asleep in light On the most heavenward top of all this world, Wing-weary—seized with sudden trance and strong Thro' the decorous continent and all The charmed defence of Nature can behold The circling health beneath them, the red haste Of the quick heart, and of her heaving breast The cavernous and windy mysteries; Yea, all the creeping secrets of her maw, The busy rot within her, and the worm That preys upon her vitals. So perchance I see the Future in the Present. Or If in the smoothest hour of patent nature That overhanging weight of Destiny Which loads the heavy air do brood on us, What wonder that our tenderer substance take Impress divine, and show the awful stamp And parody of Fate? One can be brave At noon, and with triumphant logic clear The demonstrable air, but ne'ertheless, Sometimes at Hallowe'en when, legends say, The things that stir among the rustling trees Are not all mortal, and the sick white moon Wanes o'er the season of the sheeted dead, We grow unreasonable and do quake With more than the cold wind. The very soul, Sick as the moon, suspects her sentinels, And thro' her fortress of the body peers Shivering abroad; our heart-strings over-strung, Scare us with strange involuntary notes Quivering and quaking, and the creeping flesh Knows all the starting horrors of surprise But that which makes them, and for that, half-wild, Quickens the winking lids, and glances out From side to side, as if some sudden chance Of vision, some unused slant of the eye, Some accidental focus of the sight O' th' instant might reveal a peopled world Crowding about us, and the empty light Alive with phantoms. Doubtless there are no ghosts; Yet somehow it is better not to move Lest cold hands seize upon us from behind, Or forward thro' the dim uncertain time Face close with paly face. My ominous Dream Leaves me in shuddering incredulity As logically white. SCENE XV. The Vacant Study. Through the door the voice of Amy. Amy. Out of the dungeon comes the captive's cry, Whose no man knoweth, nor shall ever know. The cry! the cry! out of the sealèd cell That no man may look into, comes a cry! Up thro' the dumb sod of a churchyard green, One of the undistinguishable dead Below the many many graves complains. The Beloved and Unbeloved are lying there, The stifling earth on them. The cry is dull, Whose no man knoweth, nor shall ever know. Thy cry, thy feeble cry, my little babe! All the long day and all the weary night! I bend me down over the sealèd cell, And strain my ears against the sodden grave, And weep and know not, nor shall ever know. SCENE XVI. The Study. Balder (solus) at his writing-table. Balder. Yesterday I said That as the lion at the water-brooks Prints his dread feet, to-morrow's great event Fording our sleep to his appointed place Beyond that Rubicon perchance may leave His footsteps in the sand. 'Twas but a fancy, But in a sleepless night seeking those steps Thro' all the inner wilderness, I came On other scars and traces, real as rock, Familiar too, and terribly historic As the carved walls whereon a martyr leaves His storied wrongs. I see the Poet's heart Is but a gem whereon his woe doth cut Her image, and he turns upon the world And sets his signet there in high wild shapes The necessary convex of a wound As miserably deep. I cannot stamp The face of Death upon the universe Till Death hath graven the seal. I wait that one Last dreadful blazon to fulfil a shield Persèan; that being held up to the day Shall make mankind my marble. Yet how long? Proud Death, thou keepest not the company Of lowlier pains and griefs. It may require A greater light than I have known to cast Thine awful shadow. Whom thou visitest With thy best pomp, and all the circumstance Of special love, are not of those who house The common brood of sorrow; but they seem Set up in shine of great prosperity Upon the dial of Time, with one sole shade To point the final hour. Yet peradventure We who stand out of the sweet sun perceive No shadow, not because the shade is less But more. Aye, in this twilight atmosphere Thou mayest approach unseen as air in air, And strike me unaware. But near or far I need thee, and in all the strange sad past Of my predestined life to say ‘I need,’ Hath been to move the universal wheels In answering motion, which in act I knew When the concluding cause and last result Of thousands dropped into my open want The supplementary fruit. Whether my will Hath power on nature, or this heart of mine Is so compacted in the frame and work Of all things that in various kind they keep Attuned performance, I know not. Perhaps There comes to each man in his day some word Whereto the tacit Visible without Is the foregone conclusion. As amid The silent summer eve of violet air That which thou seest hath no superscription Or title written; when we speak of it 'Tis with a finger pointed to the sky, ‘Behold!’ as in despair of human speech. But lo, if in that moment and the hap Of other descant one say ‘Holiness,’ A pulse of sweet emotions thro' the dark, As tho' that somewhat in the mystery Responded to a name! Such moments make My hours, such hours my days, such days my years. (A long pause.) Who is to die? It is not credible That this I have begun should come to end For lack of human lives, or that a pang Not mortal should fly wide of me; of me Who had I the round earth within my hand O'er-populous as a green water-drop, Would swallow it to taste a novel savour. (Another pause.) If I could give up This seasoned body to the advance of death, And from my vantage-post within survey The slow assault, and mark the victor, held In view before the garrisoned approach And each well-fought obstruction, and so write The story of the siege—ay, while he climbed The mound I sat on, till the pen fell, struck Fron mine untrembling hand! But who shall bear To the externe and living world, that last Convicting record? What strong sign convey Safe thro' the taken barriers, and the close Opposing ranks of Death the lineaments Which end his long disguise? No. The same key Which let him thro' the circle of the sense Would close the gate behind him, and secure The first last secret all men hear, and none Betray. If but to me the privilege To know and to declare! To suffer all That in our common nature doth fulfil And end perception, with a sense exempt From that benign conclusion! In the arms Of health to hold each form of mortal ill, Till death should die upon my conscious breast, And I by superhuman strength complete The sum of human sorrow—God to see, And man to suffer! The unchanged gold On the charred bones of the Pompeian bride, Tho' it survive the murderous fire, hath felt A deadly heat. If I could seize a soul And part to part adjust my qualities Upon it, so that like to like consort Might form a whole whereof the half could die And the remainder watch it!(Starting up.) You just gods, Is it not thus already—you good gods— [He walks in great agitation. (Sits again.) A thought stood at the threshold of my heart And shut the light out. It has past, and I Have not yet half beheld it. But I know That as its shadow came along the way I looked up, and the valley and the hills A moment swerved and failed, and as a smoke Rolled over in a wind of coming death. Through the door is heard the voice of Amy. Amy. If thou wouldst sleep, my babe, if thou wouldst sleep And weary of the never-ending day! Thou hast not milked me of my sorrow, babe, Why must thou moan and watch and wake like me? My babe, my babe, is it not well with thee? And if not well, the end is come indeed. My place was dark, and o'er a darker place A great hand held me that I could not see. Below us the dark gulph, for ever deep, Above us, thro' the dark, a light of day, And thou wert as a jewel on my breast, Sweet shining in the light that lit not me. The hand is weary with upholding me! If ill hath touched thee, babe, we are given o'er, Given o'er and dropt, a pillage and a prey! Ah! in the dark gulph what shall not seize thee! If thou wouldst sleep, my babe, if thou wouldst sleep, Nor scare me with the mystery of thine eyes. Alas, thy parted lips, my babe, my babe! Alas, the hot breath from the cankered rose! Alas, the little limbs! Alas, the heart That beateth like a wounded butterfly! My babe, my babe, what hath befallen thee? I see it all; I see, I see it all! How couldst thou lie upon my breast and live? The doom has run its date, the hour is here! Not enough, babe, oh! not enough, my babe, That I who was the favourite and the flower, Bruised and beaten by a thousand ills, As to the utter shelter and mere shed Of this great gilded palace-world did creep With thee, not wholly lost since thou wert not, Nor in my desolation desolate, Because the glory could not give thee more Than me, or the bare walls of sorrow less. My babe, it was too good for thee and me. God hath abandoned us, and from His home Is driving forth the mother and her child. My child, my child, the wolf is in the way, And what if he doth choose the suckling lamb? Hush babe, my little babe, my only babe, That I might die for thee, my babe, my babe. Balder (sinking his head into his hands). So soon, so soon! My lamb, my lily-bud, My little babe! My daughter, oh my daughter! (A long pause.) (Looking up.) Yes, I redeem the mother with the child! Fate, take thy price! If this hand shakes to pay it, 'Tis with the trembling eagerness of him Who buys an Indian kingdom with a bead. 'Tis past. I rise up childless, but no less Than I. There was one bolt in all the heavens Which falling on my head had with a touch Rent me in twain. This bursting water-spout Hath left me whole, but naked. Better so Than to be cloven in king's raiment. Ay, My treasure-house is broken, and I lose What nothing can restore, and poorer men Had held to the last drop of desperate blood. But I, who know the secrets of the place, Breathe freely when I learn the worst, and find The felon sought no further. Yet my babe! My tiny babe!— SCENE XVII. The Study. Balder, solus. Through the door comes a sound of weeping. Balder. My heart doth beat, But I am calm, calm as a winter tree Whereon one dead leaf flutters in the wind. The waters of my soul that swelled so high, Broke up my deeps and filled my universe, Have sunk to such a mirror as reflects The heaven and earth, and makes whatever face Bends anew o'er them out of the unknown A part of all things. Now I cannot weep. I have climbed out o' the thunder, and most cold Upon the heights of everlasting snow Stand with cherubic knowledge. This hot breast Seems valley deep, and what the wind of Fate Strikes on that harp strung there to bursting, I, Descending, mean to catch as one unmoved In stern notation. A strange sense of sight, Fearless that lightning-like finds easiest way Self-warranted where way is none, makes wide Mine eyes that could look thro' into the depths Behind the face of God. 'Tis well. Even so Would I meet Death. [Exit through the door of the adjoining room. SCENE XVIII. The Study. Balder, solus. Balder. If to the long mysterious trance of death There be immortal waking, he who lifts His head from the clay pillow, and doth stretch Eternal life thro' all his quickening limbs, And conscious on his opening orbs receives Remembered light, and rises to be sure He hath revived indeed, tastes in that first Best moment what the infinite beyond Can never give again. I should awake On some such resurrection, having lived Thro' what I feared was mortal, and endured That most malignant hour which must or close The perilous adventure, or, being forced, Admit to happier times. The ground grows firm Beneath; the elfin atmosphere of spells That smit these limbs with palsy, has given place To vital air. I smell the native world. The fortress of the last enchanter yields; My life is free before me. I am strong; I shall survive, subdue, surmount, attain! Thou mystery, which dost attend my voice Like a tame beast, and goest in and out Whene'er I will, and liest at my feet, Come let me paint the picture I have bought So dearly, but, being painted, will hold cheap, Ay, tho' I rent it at the yearly cost Of such an annual tribute! Here! Be here! He comes. Even now this black environment Grows cold with his approach; and as on one Benighted in the forest dreadful eyes Shine thro' the dark, and Somewhat unbeheld Draws nigh, thro' the thick darkness of my night I see thine eyes, oh Death! [Takes pen and paper, in attitude to write. The voice of Amy comes through the door. Amy. That I might die and be at rest, oh God! That I might die and sleep the sleep of peace; That I might die and close these eyes within That shut not when the outer lids are sealed; That I might die and know the balm of death Cool thro' my loosened limbs; that I might die, That I might die and stretch me out unracked, And feel but as I died what is not pain. It is dead midnight, and the time to sleep.— My light has gone out in the dead midnight; All things are equal in the utter dark; I cannot see my way upon the world. All in the dark a tempest beateth me, Black waves out of the north and of the south, Black waves out of the east and of the west, Black falling waves that drench me from the sky! On every side the waters lash me round, And lift me till I know not where I stood, And wist not where is earth or where is heaven! [Listening, he falls into a reverie. Balder. Little babe, Who wentest out from us two days ago Not to return, what has become of thee In this great universe? That thou art changed I know; for whereas thou hadst lain since birth On the warm breast that fed thee in a dream Of peace, and, like a flower, wert given and ta'en Unconscious, on a morn thou didst awake, And while we weeping strove to keep thee, thou, As at some awful voice that called thee hence On high behest, becamest a man in will, And ceasing thy babe's cry didst go in haste! We also went a little way with thee, As they whose best-beloved doth cross the seas Attend him to the shore—even to the brink Of the great deep, and stretch along the sands Wringing vain hands of sorrow; yet none saith ‘Why goest thou?’ nor with naked sword of love Denies; and none doth leap into his fate, Crying ‘I also,’ and with desperate clasp Hang on his neck till breakers far behind Forbid return. Spell-bound they stand and dry On the sea-line, and not a quivering lip Murmureth ‘To-morrow;’ but his sire doth seize The prow that would recede, and with stern will Holds it, rebellious, to the task, and she Who bore him, with her tears and trembling hands Constrains and hastes him lest he lose the tide. So also in a dream as one who walks Asleep, and with her sunk eye on a star, Rising doth take her slumbering babe, and o'er The snows of midnight to the precipice Paceth with silent purpose, doubting nought, And turneth on the brink, with empty hands, And to her bed unconscious, nor till morn Beholds the vacant pillow—and, well-known, Her foot-prints,—passionate; we went with thee, And did return alone. My babe, my babe, What have we done? At whose sufficient pledge, Upon whose testimony, and well-sworn Assurance have we left thee, and believed? Did I go down before thee? Did I try The unventured way? With which hand did I smooth Thy pillow? Or with what nice care explore The grave which in my trance I called thy bed? Thy bed? wert thou so cradled? Doth the boor Upon the hungry common save his hide By such a lodging as thou in thy pomp Didst enter, while the sable priest gave thanks, And praised the long home where he would not chain His dog? Thy home, poor babe? Bah! the stone den Of murder is more human; the dank keep Of felon anguish built to house despair Hath not a cell so rude! [Muses. Was it a door From this most ordered world into the waste Of all things? Have we shut thee forth, poor child, And wist not of thy journey, nor the end And exit of that gloomy subterrene Which thou didst enter, and whose unknown mouth May be in Chaos? This, the upper gate, Was fair, and, hanging o'er, the flowers looked down After thee going, shedding many dews That went as falling stars into the gulph, A moment bright like thee. But, oh thou babe, What of the nether port, which thou hast reached Who wert so swift to go? We shut thee in As to a chamber of rest, and did confirm The outer bars, and on the adit set The seal of Hermes, and o'er all dispread The cheerful turf, and sowed it round with spring. Mad faith!—false father!—customary fool!— Tool of low instinct and obsequious use!— Curse thee, blind slave! why didst thou leave her thus In her worst need? Who, who shall certify Her rest? And thou, oh mother, that didst plunge So boldly into the vexed flood of life, Holding thy babe aloft, with thy right hand, Braving the billows; what unseen sea-scourge Had struck thee, that thou too didst bow thine head A-sudden succourless, and hast gone down As others? Doth no voice out of the ground, Up thro' the music of the grasshoppers Smite thee? Whence, mother, had thy nursling child This gift to sleep alone? Whence knowest thou, O mother, who in its long dying swoon Didst warm it in thy bosom, and forfend The summer wind, and kiss the tenderness Of years upon its momentary brow, And with the wild haste of thy maddened eyes Course heaven and earth, as to glean anywhere One help forgotten; and at the last breath Distraught and bending over it didst break Thy life upon it, if perchance that balm Might heal; and ere it died wert as one dead With dread of ill, whence knowest thou what change Absolves thy care? What thunder or what bush Of burning spake to thee when thou didst rise And veil thy face, and, unresisting, feel The child go from thee out into the rains And dews, and didst kneel silent while we threw Cold earth upon it, and piled up that wall Which late compunction and awakening throes, Pangs of reproach and passion of despair, And starting eyes mocked by the empty world, And famished breasts convulsed when nights are chill, And stretched-forth arms that waste with vacancy, And all the tumult of the desperate heart That leaps to the impossible desire And unsurrendered bliss, can pass no more. SCENE XIX. The Study. Balder, at his writing-table, preparing to write, when the voice of Amy comes through the open door. Amy. My heart is shivered as a fallen cup And all the golden wine is in the earth. My heart is stricken, and it cannot heal. Tho' thou art but a little grave I know, O little grave, it will bleed into thee For evermore, and thou wilt not be filled. The fountains of my fate are dry; my soul Is dying in the famine of my lot. I am a dead leaf in a wintry wind; My stem is broken from the tree of life, I wither in the sun and in the air, I wither in the rain and in the dews. And though the wind doth throw me on the tree, Oh wind! thou canst not bind what thou didst break; I wither in the verdure of the leaves.— Beneath my window built the nightingale; Ah cruel, who despoiled her happy nest! And in his wanton gripe he crushed her egg, Her one lone egg;—so doth Fate crush my heart. The spring returns unto the nightingale, The nightingale shall find a happier tree; The ravished nest must drift upon the day, The wind shall toss it as an idle straw, The rain shall tread its ruins to the earth, And I am all despoiled for evermore. [He rises sorrowfully, and shuts the door. Balder. How often our twin passions do exchange Fraternal uses, and alike in face But opposite in sex, confound the eye That reckons on their valour, or makes bold Upon presumptive weakness, nor descries The pious counterfeit when manly strength Presents meek maidenhead, or female parts Complete the heroic brow, and she who lacks So much of manhood plights her faith as man, Or strong Sebastian's virile arm redeems The gage of virgin Viola. To-day My grief—like one who crossed in hapless love Betakes him to the wars, and tells in blows His bitter need of kisses—speaks with voice Of fiery wrath. Writes and then reads. Lo, Justice! and led in By History, as by a little child. She, moving as a goddess, slow drew nigh Three adverse forms and human to behold, Each a Colossus; Insolence, and Fraud, And Malice. These approaching her, advanced A step, and drew their several weapons. One With voice like a cracked trumpet, and too loud For that he said; and one with whisper dire, Like the great ghost of a great sound, as large But bodiless; the third as still as death. They came: then Justice, lifting up her hand, ‘Back to your shapes!’ The three fell down headlong. The first a Cur deformed, of monstrous birth, With head that Parthian-like still looked behind And fled from what he hurt; the next a Spider, Gaunt black and lean, full of unnatural eyes Detestable; the third a reeking Toad. Bare in the day, these, or with horrid whine Slunk to the earth, or crouched in dark and foul Discovery, or swat a cancerous pool Of poison, and lay hid. But Justice spake: ‘Because ye did your will upon the weak, Because ye had no pity on the poor, Because your hands were quick to stab the fallen, Because ye made your pillage of the slain, Because ye lay in ambush for the brave, Because ye stole by night upon the good, Because ye dug a pitfall for the true, Because ye overcried the voice of Right, Because ye clapped your hands when strong men lied, Because ye smote the cheek of innocence, And spat your fetid spume in Wisdom's face; Because being bestial, ye bewitched men's eyes To see my sons as beasts, and ye as men, Because in all your sins ye knew your sin, And saw me while ye sware that I was not, And heard me thro' the clamour of your tongues, And shouted more lest men should see ye shake; Because my sons have spoken in mine ears, And all ye did to them of old I know; Because, accursed! they shall not defile Their hands to slay you, since with such as ye 'Twere equal shame to be at peace or war; Because outcast from heaven, and earth, and hell, Detect, disowned, detested, and despised, There is no power to which ye can be true, And Satan cannot trust ye more than God, I come!’ She wrenched the bandage from her eyes, And looked on them:—and—as the summer bolt Falls in the forest on the gathered leaves Of winter, and they start into a flame Out of their empty place,—a kindling fire Consumed them, and a sudden rolling smoke Showed they had been. And lo! from out the smoke I saw the grim and clanking skeleton Of the dead dog, licked bare to the white bones, Run as alive. With skull revert, and jaws That may not cease to move, but make no sound, He flees for ever o'er the startled earth, A terror and a sign. SCENE XX. The Vacant Study. Through the door the voice of Amy. Amy. Oh wounded dove, oh dove with broken wing, Oh dying dove, wert thou not beautiful? Why didst thou hide thee, trembler, from the day, And strain into the crevice of the cliff, And press thy beating breast against the hill, As if the rock should ope and let thee in? I took thee to my heart, oh snow-white dove, I would have kissed and kissed thee o'er and o'er, But thou wert fierce with fear, and with wild eyes Didst turn upon me like a frantic maid That struggles with a lover in the dark, Bruising the hands that would have cherished her, And gnashing on the lips that seek her own Oh dove, I also fall with broken wing, I also strive and turn upon my fate, And strike the inevitable hands in vain. I also strain my bosom to the earth, The earth that will not ope and let me in. SCENE XXI. The Vacant Study. Through the door the voice of Amy. Amy. That I might only die and be at rest, That I might die and sleep the sleep of peace, That I might die and close these eyes within, These eyes that start and stare so hot with life, And mad-wide while the outer lids are sealed! That I might die and know the balm of death, And feel but as I died what is not pain. The summer is a load upon my sense, A pile of durance builded over head; The battening shadow, and the fattening earth, And all the thick abundance of the trees! Fall, Summer! rend the cerements of my tomb! If I might know that aught that binds can break! If I might struggle thro' my choking banks, And cheat me with the transport that I rise! Alas, thou fallest, and I am not free! Alas, alas, thou canst not let me forth! Alas, alas, the grave-clothes, not the grave! Alas, alas, the vaulted adamant, And dolour of inexorable things! SCENE XXII. The Vacant Study. Through the door the voice of Amy. Amy. Swallow, that yearly art blown round the world, What seekest thou that never may be found? Whither for ever sailing and to sail? I think the gulphs have sucked thine haven down, And thou still steerest for the vanished strand. What cheer, what cheer, oh fairy marinere Of windy billows, sea-mew of the air? The viewless oceans wash thee to and fro, Spout thee to Heaven, and dive thee to the deep. Swallow! I also seek and do not find. SCENE XXIII. The Court-yard of the Tower. Balder, solus. Enter Dr. Paul. Balder. Doctor! Doctor. You're well? My patient? Balder. Only now She went to sit beside the little grave. Prithee, friend, wait awhile. It were ill-done So soon to follow. Doctor. Is this pilgrimage A manner with her? Balder. Thou may'st even trace The path her feet have worn across the mead Straight from our threshold. Many times a day She rises up as who should hear a sound Far off. I have gone with her hour by hour, And still she hath the step of expectation, Kneels by the woful mound and leans her ear Upon the earth, lifts her wan cheek with flush And gesture of surprise, feels one by one The gaps and junctures of the ungrown sod As 'twere new broken, and anon doth shake Her piteous head, and look into my face As if I wronged her; and so home in haste Unresting. But she watcheth night and day To steal unnoticed forth, and then she stays Till someone lead her homeward. Drawing nigh Beneath the twilight I perceive she sits Upon a neighbouring stone, and by her lips I think she sings, slow swaying to and fro, As one who rocks a child. I give her way, For fancy,—like the image that our boors Set by their kine,—doth milk her of her tears, And loose the terrible unsolved distress Of tumid Nature. Under observance She hath been silent since that mortal hour; Lying close like a toiled bird, that with wide eyes Is mute and strange, but, being alone, lets forth Its sad wild cry. Paul, I have heard that cry Twice lately in the dark, here, where we sit! How I have been so long both deaf and blind Confounds invention, but my sense at last Is opened, and I do perceive this ill Is not a growth of yesterday. They tell In sea tales of deaf men made whole amid The roar of battle, who go forthwith mad, Wild with the naked torment of the bruised Unseasoned function. I do think my case Is such a thunderous healing. What I hear Strikes through the feeble garment of the flesh, And stuns the very soul. My book stands still. I am no carpet knight, and in my time Have known hard knocks, but, callous as I am, This breaks endurance. Since the malady That racked her, three short summers since, I held Her sorrows to be no more than the toys And creatures of a tender melancholy, The honey-droppings of an atmosphere So delicate that every mist and whiff Which sails a grosser sky came down in rain. But this is hell, and the infernal fall Of burning snow. Doctor. Poor thing, poor thing, poor thing! How long think you? Balder. An hour? Doctor. If it must be. We men of drug and scalpel still are men And have our feelings. I call us the gnomes Of science, miners who scarce see the light Working within the bowels of the world Of beauty. Balder. But your toil, like theirs, gives wealth And warmth, and glory, to a fairer sphere, Brings forth the golden wonder, which in hand Of prince or clown, of poet or of fool, Is standard still; lights up the common hearth Of household joy familiar, and makes bright The jewelled front of kings. Doctor. Ah, my good friend, I was a poet once, and thought strange things, Very strange things. How I would walk alone And mutter in my going, dare the heavens As thus! clap sudden hand upon my brow, Hold up a finger and cry hist! to the air, Walk you a mile bareheaded in the rain, Stop, gaze the ground, stamp like a bull, and sigh, Sigh like a painted Boreas! or, in fierce Obstetric frenzy of the labouring Muse, Collar the astonished wayfarer with ‘Sir, Your tablets!’ scare the woodman's hut with calls For pen and paper, or make eloquent The graphic bark of beech. Ah, those days when I courted Sophonisba, long ago, And we two loved the moonlight and wrote verses! It melts my very heart to think on't! Balder. Love Makes us all poets. Each man in his turn, At culmination of one happy hour Consummate of some sole and topmost day Hath his apotheosis. Nature thus, Ere she send forth her mintage to the world Assays it for eternity, and sets The stamp of sterling manhood. From the mount Of high transfiguration you come down Into your common life-time, as the diver Breathes upper air a moment ere he plunge, And, by mere virtue of that moment, lives In breathless deeps and dark. We poets dwell Upon the height, saying, as one of old, ‘Let us make tabernacles: it is good To be here.’ Doctor. Out of mortal sight! Ay, you Live to posterity. Balder. Your pardon; no! Doctor. To the mere present? Balder. No. I do not scorn Fame, and those wide and calmer after days Where Time's thick flood grows quiet, letting down Its golden grains to be the jealous wealth Of nations; but I choose to say, ‘I live To God and to myself.’ Of God I know Little to satisfy a human heart So fashioned to adore Him; of myself Still less, yet somewhat; of posterity This only,—that in circling cycles, come What will come on the ever-rolling years, The Ages will not outlive a true man And his Divine Creator. Doctor. Well, well, poet, If love makes heroes it makes fools. And Nature, If, as you say, fresh from that crucible, She marks us current, full as often signs The cap of Momus as the bay of Cæsar. Were you but where I am, and with my eyes Saw as I see to what this love can bring Men down. Balder. Not love, but passion, the mere dance Of this gross body to the soul's sweet singing, Which you mistake for love, because sometimes The singer, high and pale, descends to join (With haughtier step as consciously a god) The Paphian measure of his mortal twin. And strange reflection of the glowing flesh Doth flush the soul. Doctor. I have walked far. Balder. We'll enter— From the high window in the turret there, I see the churchyard in the dale. Doctor. Dost spend The day in watching? Balder. I keep vigil on her As any star behind his golden face Spends his great gifts upon his proper world, And lights us with an idle faculty. [They enter the Tower, and mount to the Study. Doctor A poet's studio! I have often passed The lintel of your home, but ne'er before The threshold of its penetralia. I Long to behold your gods. Balder. Expect none, Paul. Doctor. How? Balder. Expect none, my friend, if seeing me Thou hast seen none. My word on it Æneas Is godless, or ‘Penatiger Æneas.’ Doctor. Thou Pagan! why the room is an Olympus! Balder. Olympus' top is a long way from heaven. Doctor. From heaven say you? The mason, by my count, Is greater than the house, and I perceive That old Italian, whose Uranian pride When his great prince had forfeited the skies, Built him another heaven, and filled the dome With angels, like the first. Balder. Ay, dauntless Michael, Who drew the Judgment, in some daring hope That, seeing it, the gods could not depart From so divine a pattern. Doctor. Ah! thou, too, Sad Alighieri, like a waning moon Setting in storm behind a grove of bays! Balder. Yes, the great Florentine, who wove his web And thrust it into hell, and drew it forth Immortal, having burned all that could burn, And leaving only what shall still be found Untouched, nor with the smell of fire upon it, Under the final ashes of this world. Doctor. Shakspeare and Milton! Balder. Switzerland and home. I ne'er see Milton, but I see the Alps, As once sole standing on a peak supreme, To the extremest verge summit and gulph I saw, height after depth, Alp beyond Alp, O'er which the rising and the sinking soul Sails into distance, heaving as a ship O'er a great sea that sets to strands unseen. And as the mounting and descending bark Borne on exulting by the under deep, Gains of the wild wave something not the wave, Catches a joy of going, and a will Resistless, and upon the last lee foam Leaps into air beyond it, so the soul Upon the Alpine ocean mountain-tost, Incessant carried up to heaven, and plunged To darkness, and still wet with drops of death Held into light eternal, and again Cast down, to be again uplift in vast And infinite succession, cannot stay The mad momentum, but in frenzied sight Of horizontal clouds and mists and skies And the untried Inane, springs on the surge Of things, and passing matter by a force Material, thro' vacuity careers, Rising and falling. Doctor. And my Shakspeare! Call Milton your Alps, and which is he among The tops of Andes? Keep your Paradise, And Eves, and Adams, but give me the Earth That Shakspeare drew, and make it grave and gay With Shakspeare's men and women; let me laugh Or weep with them, and you—a wager,—ay, A wager by my faith—either his muse Was the recording angel, or that hand Cherubic which fills up the Book of Life, Caught what the last relaxing gripe let fall By a death-bed at Stratford, and henceforth Holds Shakspeare's pen. Now strain your sinews, poet, And top your Pelion,—Milton Switzerland, And English Shakspeare— Balder. This dear English land! This happy England, loud with brooks and birds, Shining with harvests, cool with dewy trees, And bloomed from hill to dell; but whose best flowers Are daughters, and Ophelia still more fair Than any rose she weaves; whose noblest floods The pulsing torrent of a nation's heart; Whose forests stronger than her native oaks Are living men; and whose unfathomed lakes For ever calm the unforgotten dead In quiet graveyards willowed seemly round, O'er which To-day bends sad, and sees his face. Whose rocks are rights, consolidate of old Thro' unremembered years, around whose base The ever-surging peoples roll and roar Perpetual, as around her cliffs the seas That only wash them whiter; and whose mountains, Souls that from this mere footing of the earth Lift their great virtues thro' all clouds of Fate Up to the very heavens, and make them rise To keep the gods above us! Doctor. Your hand on it! Balder. The wicket swings, how now? Doctor. A tattered man. Balder. I must go down— Doctor. An aged peasant woman, A chubby child beside her; by my soul The rosy blossom and the withered crab, Both on one bough? who are they? Balder. Pensioners. Doctor. Your's? Balder. Her's. Doctor. Some say the illumining sun is dark; But poor as you are— Balder. Is this blossom sweet? Doctor. Most fragrant! Balder. Yet I plucked it on a rock Where common grass had died. Learn this, my friend, The secret that doth make a flower a flower, So frames it that to bloom is to be sweet, And to receive to give. The flower can die, But cannot change its nature; though the earth Starve it, and the reluctant air defraud, No soil so sterile and no living lot So poor but it hath somewhat still to spare In bounteous odours. Charitable they Who, be their having more or less, so have That less is more than need, and more is less Than the great heart's goodwill. Here are books, here A picture, still unpacked, from the great city, Sent by an early college friend, who vows A pilgrimage to these old hills; and there (Arrived this morning from the muse knows where) That strange sweet mystery, the early scrawl Of young Ambition. Genius is born blind; See how the nursling fumbles for the dug, Lipping each barren likeness; now distent As limpet on a rock, and sucking hard The east-wind, and now drawing with a touch Nectar for gods; 'twill help the hour on— (Going.) Stay! Paul, thou art somewhat of an antiquary; Let these walls entertain thee; at thy leisure Spell out these parchments, which my chamberlain, The spider, deems too bare for such a presence, And with his orfrays and embroidery Decks an' I will or no. To my heart, Paul, The mouldering stones of this old tottering tower Are not more ancient; this, for all I feel, Might be the dust of centuries! Doctor. What are they? Balder. Listen: when we came here, a bridal pair, Joyous and young and poor, I took this room For mine, the forge in which to beat my gifts To the white heat that lights and warms the world; And so I left it bare. We had small store, And that I spent on her's. But still she came, And sat beside me at her daily tasks In happy silence; then I said ‘not here!’ But she said ‘here!’ and kissed me; oh those days! She was so fair—— Doctor. She was? Balder. She is; she was So fair, so delicately bred; I saw Her there, and all the strong unseemly place Disturbed me. ‘Oh for cloth of gold,’ I cried, ‘To make a palace for thee!’ But she smiled. When she came in I felt the cold grey air Strike her like a stone, and when she walked methought, Oft as she passed between me and the wall, The rudeness of the unhewn and jagged rock, Albeit that bodily it touched her not, Harried her beauty; and, whene'er she sat Looking her sweet content, stern histories Sank from the dark roof thro' the dungeon day, And fell upon her face like grinding dust Upon the apple of mine eye. She knew My trouble, saying, ‘Where thou art, to me Heaven arches o'er thee, and I dwell in tents Of azure; but, my husband! as thou wilt. Nevertheless, not silver and not gold, Silver and gold are not for me or thee; But oh, my poet husband! what thou hast Give me.’ And so I hung the room with Thought. Morning and noon, and eve and night, and all The changing seasons; scenes, or new or old, Strange faces and familiar; forms of men Or gods in valleys deep, or mountains high; And how she loved them! Tarry till I come. [Goes. Doctor (unfolding a scroll). What's here? sad heart! some withered primroses! (Reads.) ‘Spring, who did scatter all her wealth last year, Had gone to heaven for more; and coming back Flower-laden after three full seasons, found The Earth, her mother, dead. Far off, appalled With the unwonted pallor of her face, She flung her garlands down, and caught, distract, The skirts of passing tempests, and thro' wilds Of frozen air fled to her, all uncrowned With haste,—a bunch of snowdrops in her breast, Her charms dishevelled, and her cheeks as white As winter with her woe. She fell upon The corse, and warmed it. The maternal earth, Which was not dead, but slept, unclosed her eyes. Then Spring, o'erawed at her own miracle, Fell on her knees; and then she smiled and wept. Meanwhile the attendant birds her haste outstripped, Chasing her voice, crowd round and fill the air With jocund loyalty; and eager winds Her suitors, at full speed with Love and wild, Hie by her in the lusty cheer of March, Crying her name. Laughed Spring to see them pass, —Laughing in tears. Then it repented her To see the old parental limbs of Earth Lie stark as death; and fared she forth alone To where she left her burden in the void Beyond the south horizon; her fair hair Streaming spring clouds among the vernal stars. Returning, slow with flowers, she dressed the Earth, Which had sat up, and, being naked, blushed, And stretched her conscious arms to meet the Spring, Who breathed upon her face, and made her young. Then did her mother Earth rejoice in her; And she with filial love and joy admired, Weeping and trembling in the wont of maids. Meantime her pious fame had filled the skies; He that begat her, the almighty Sun, Passing in regal state, did call her “child,” And blessed her and her mother where they sat— Her by the imposition of bright hands, The Earth with kisses. Then the Spring would go, Abashed with bliss, decorous in the face Of love parental. But the Earth stood up, And held her there; and, them encircling, came All kind of happy shapes that wander space, Brightening the air. And they two sang like gods Under the answering heavens.’ Doctor (unrolling another scroll). Here Summer, (reads.) ‘Summer, Mother of gods and men, with equal face Unchangeable, and such wide eyes divine As on the Athenian hill-top Phidian Jove Inherited; whose universal sense Seems made with ampler vision to behold A larger world than ours. She leans in light On rose-leaves, as a long and lazy cloud Leans on the broad bed of the blushing west. In her right hand a horn of plenty, red With fragrant fruits exuberant; in her left The early harvest; crowned with oak and ash, Her hot feet slippered in the calid seas. Her voice is like the murmur of the floods Sluggard with noon, or the thick-leaved response Of sultry forests to the languid winds Dull with the dog-days.’ Nay, no more; one knows This better out of doors. Now Autumn! blow A windy morning, and a whirr of wings. [Unrolling another scroll, reads. ‘He stands beside a throne of golden hills, And up the steep steps of the royal throne The burdened forests climb like countless slaves Laden with gold. He stands and heeds them not; Meanwhile his hand, with air abstract and wan, From the abounding tribute of the earth Scatters imperial largesse. All her fields Are his; they own their lord; his barns are full, His rivers run with wine, and his red plains Shout with the vintage. Yet he stands beside His golden throne, and looketh up to heaven, And sigheth in the melancholy winds, And smileth sweeter sadness. He hath learned The lesson of power; therefore his locks are sere, Therefore there is no light in the sunk eyes Which day and night reproach the sun and stars With the unsated hunger of a soul That is no richer tho' the world be won.’ Too sentimental! He should take a license To kill game.— (Unrolling another scroll.) Autumn still? Corpo di Bacco! A metamorphosis! ‘The Death of Autumn!’ [Reads. ‘Sometimes an aged king upon his bed, He dieth 'mid the conscious hush of all His reverent realm, and silent snows him wind. Or, haply, at midnight a choir of winds Chanting great anthems, bear him to his rest. And sometimes doing battle with his fate, A wreathed wrestler from a gorge of wine, He falls in pride; a giant in his blood, Dashed with the purple feast as to his robes Of azure triumph and his golden crown Olympic, while his dying eye on fire Brings a red glow into the cheeks of Death, His ghastly foe, and his felled stature shakes The sounding halls. And sometimes as a maid Dead and undone, the pale and drowned year Lies still and silent on the mortal shore, With dank unmeaning lips and sightless eyes Ooze-filled, and blanch limbs stark and stiff beyond The draggled robes soaked with a colder death. And sometimes as a trusting maid who waits Her far false lover, and thro' long lone hours Expects in vain, but as the sun goes down, Chilled with the bitter day where love is not, Blighted and mute, astonied beyond speech, Stands utterless; while all within is changed From life to death, and under that pale breast Unheaving and those glittering eyes transacts The alchemy of ruin. Nor she weeps, Nor starts, nor shrieks, nor throws her arms to heaven, But motionless and crimson with her wrong Dies in her silence, and falls still as leaves Thro' stiller air.’ Enough. Shall I try Winter? [Unrolling another scroll, reads. ‘Who is he That o'er green pastures of the latter year, And on the mountain-tops, and through the woods Passeth amid the pageant of the world Silent and ceaseless, laying hand on nought? Not as content, for greed is in his eye, But patient in the confidence of fate. Downward in face, and as to his bent head Covered; by night and day, in sun or rain, Unlooked for, unforeseen, but ever found, And keeping ever on an aimless way With the firm foot of purpose, as in dreams We walk to airy biddings, and as on A king's death-day, while all the court stand round Power unresigned, the inevitable heir Doth eye the crown and pace the palace floors Expectant. But none know him for a king Nor do him homage. The too-lusty green Of the o'er-confident time unawed stands out Into his path, and the insulting growth Below retards his unrespected feet. He sees, and a cold smile comes on his face As moonlight upon ice; the shivering wind Starts from his side, and fleeing ominous, Spreads such a sign as in the latter day Shall blow from chill Damascus; but no roll Of answering thunder nor dread bolt of wrath Smites the roused world that listens and forgets. Yet some are wise. With him on hill-tops hoar The o'erruling spirits and attentive hours Confer, and seek and take his high behest In secret, and make peace with things to come. And failing Autumn, like an aged king, Talked with him on the field of cloth of gold, And as he spake fell dead; and the lush powers, And pleasures full, which ruled the summer reign (Like ships on a calm sea, that, sinking slow, Of all their gallant bulk above the wave Leave but a naked mast) sank one by one Into the earth, and in the wonted place Were found in lesser fashion, daily less. And now the fields are empty, but He walks Hale and unminished to and fro and up And down, and more and more the observance Of the astonished year is turned and turned Upon the Solitary, and the leaves Grow wan with conscience, and a-sudden fall Liege at his feet, and all the naked trees Mourn audibly, lifting appealing arms. Which when he knew, as a pale smoke that grows Keeping its shape, he rose into the air And froze it, and the broad land blanched with fear, And every breathless stream and river stopped, And thro' him, walking white and like a ghost With grim unfurnished limbs, the cold light passed And cast no shade. Then was he king indeed, And all the undefended World he saw Bare at his will. His brow grew black on her; And with a sound that killed her shuddering heart, He whistled for the North.’ Nay, rheumatism Forbid! Let's have some sunshine (unrolling scrolls) —Æschylus— Thor—Balder—a Viking—a Runic Skald— Kun-y-a and the Gopees—Seeva-deo— What next? Stay, here's some warmth in prospect. ‘Dawn.’ (Reads.) ‘See her in naked beauty, calm as snow, And cradled in a cloud upon the east. Unblushed, unconscious, with unopened lids, Fair as the first of women where she lay Among the asphodels of Paradise Before God breathed for her the breath of life.’ Too cool, I long for morning. Here! (Opening a scroll, and reading.) ‘Lo, Morn, When she stood forth at universal prime, The angels shouted, and the dews of joy Stood in the eyes of earth. While here she reigned Adam and Eve were full of orisons, And could not sin. And so she won of God That ever when she walketh in the world It shall be Eden. And around her come The happy wonts of early Paradise. Again the mist ascendeth from the earth And watereth the ground, and at the sign Nature, that silent saw our woe, breaks forth Into her olden singing, near and far The full and voluntary chorus tune Spontaneous throats, and the ten thousand strings That by meridian day, being struck, give out A muffled answer, peal their notes, and ring Reverberating music. Once again The heavens forget their limits, pinions bright O'er-passing mix the ethereal bounds with ours, And winds of morning lead between their wings Ambrosial odours and celestial airs Warm with the voices of a better world. Dews to the early grass, Light to the eyes, Brooks to the murmuring hills, Spring to the earth, Sweet winds to opening flowers, morn to the heart! But more than dew to grass or light to eyes Or brooks to murmuring hills or spring to earth Or winds to opening flowers, morn to the heart! Once more to live is to be happy; Life With backward-streaming hair and eyes of haste That look beyond the hills, doth urge no more Her palpitating feet; Her wild hair falls Soft thro' the happy light upon her limbs, She turns her wondering gaze upon herself, Sweet saying—“It is good.” Once more the soul Rises in Eden to immortal gifts, And by the side of morning,—new from heaven, Fresh from the stores of all things, and within Her limpid face still wearing reflex bright Of joys that shall be,—dances glad with strange Unutterable Knowledge. We are healed; The curse falls from our eyelids; all the thorns And thistles that do plague us, clad in gems Stand round; and we behold them as they are, And call them jewelled friends. All fetters break; From the tremendous girdle that doth round The globe and keep her, to these heavy bonds That bind us to her, and whose last stronghold Is clenched in central fires. We are not dogs Nailed to a needful den, but wingèd lions, And walk the earth from choice,—the fair free earth That willeth to be here, and cares not yet To mount up like a coloured cloud to God. The pulse of Being flows, the ill that ran Along her veins, the hand of Incubus Upon her throat, are gone like night! All things Do well, and still his function is to each Consummate welfare. As the unheeded garb Upon the rising and the falling breast Of beauty, that still moveth as she moves, Breathes with her breath and quivers with her sighs, So Nature's varied robe lies light on her, The beautiful broad surface of the world And all its kingdoms. Memory that stirred And murmured thro' the helpless dreamy dark, Snuffing the eternal air, sinks silent down To utter sleep, for whereas day that is Bendeth beneath the golden multitude Of all the days that have been, each to-morrow Heavier for yesterday, Morn hath no past. Primeval, perfect, she, not born to toil, Steppeth from under the great weight of life, And stands as at the first. The feast is spread, And none know wherefore. Wherefore? who shall ask? Who cannot feast? As a rich bride in smiles And blushes for her much bliss eateth not, And seeth that they serve a sacrament And something more than wine, the poet sits. While Who stood glorious at the shining head Of jubilee, where men a light beheld And he a presence, clad in sounding joy Moves down the festal aisles. As a true queen, In whose ennobling eyes her lowliest guests Are princes, so she slow descends to far Forgotten places, and with her mere smile Rights the unequal board. Light shines to light Down to the earth and upward to the heaven, And whatsoe'er unknown it is whereof Our lives default, whatever of divine Whose all irreparable absence makes The nameless dolour of a mortal day, Returns in full. As love, that hath his cell In the deep secret heart, doth with his breath Enrich the precincts of his sanctuary And glorify the brow and tint the cheek; As in a summer garden one beloved Whom roses hide, unseen fills all the place With happy presence; as to the void soul Beggared with famine and with drought, lo God! And there is great abundance; so comes MORN, Plenishes all things and completes the world.’ (Opening another scroll.) Now for the matron sister, drowsy Noon, The lotus-eater, nay, nay, I must keep My eyes open; I'll pass her for the next. This should be evening by its place. No title! (Reads.) ‘And seest thou her who kneeleth clad in gold And purple, with a flush upon her cheek, And upturned eyes full of the love and sorrow Of other worlds? 'Tis said that when the son Of God did walk the earth, she loved a star Which went aloft with God, but, lest she die, Day after day looks out on her from heaven At sunset smiling, so she wears her robe Sad but imperial, as of right a queen.’ [Turns to another scroll, unrolls, and reads. ‘And lo the last strange sister, but tho' last Elder and haught, called Night on earth, in heaven Nameless, for in her far youth she was given, Pale as she is, to pride, and did bedeck Her bosom with innumerable gems, And God, He said, “Let no man look on her For ever,” and, begirt with this strong spell, The moon in her wan hand she wanders forth, Seeking for some one to behold her beauty, And wheresoe'er she cometh eyelids close, And the world sleeps.’ I'm sleepy too; Heigho! Is this a dream? (Opens a scroll and reads.) ‘I knew a family Of fairies. Thou wouldst hear their history? But how? I cannot speak of them apart; Nay, hardly of the matter of this breath May frame their common story. Our least word Too palpable is grosser than the strength Of all, as one bright water-drop contains An animaicular people. Oberon, Step forth, and let me fit thee with a sound Wherein from top to toe thou wouldst not stand Hid as an urchin in his grandsire's coat! Their dwelling-place was by the water's edge Under a stone. The mosses of the brink Spread ample shade with branching arms at noon, And there each day they lay at ease, all three Singing a drowsy chorus like the hum Of hovering gnat above a bed at night, Heard when the house is still. Such needful rest Concludes the daily feast;—a grain of grass In no more honey-dew than loads an ant Driven like an ass before them. Once a day They fed at home, but morn and eve I saw Where in green ambush under milking kine, Looking up, all, as to a precipice, They watched the pail, and when the white plash fell Cupped in some patent floweret, gathering round, Climbed the laborious stem, and bending o'er, Drank deep; which done, they seek the lucid lake, And sailing forth in pride, the emerald wing Of summer beetle is a barge of state; Her cock-boat, red and black, the painted scale Of lady-fly aft in the fairy wake Towed by a film, and tossed perchance in storm, When airy martlet, sipping of the pool, Touches it to a ripple that stirs not The lilies. Thus I knew the tiny band, Nor only so, but singly, and of each The several favour; yet I can but speak With organs made to tell of gods and men. Thou who wouldst know them better think the rest, And with some fine suggestion which has taste Of a remembered odour, silent sweet, Or what rare power divides the last result Of mortal touch, and to the atomy Gives an unnamed inferior, or what sense Responds the tremors of the soul and takes The sound of wings that, unbeheld by eyes, Mystic and seldom thro' its upper air Pass as in wandering flight; therewith behold My vision, and therewith accept the parts Of the so delicate whole which my strained care Brought not unminished, nor could bring, but found As 'twere an elfin draught in faëry cup, And to be spilled by the mere pulse of hands Like mine. Therewith attach each separate grace Of those thus fair together; know what made Each brother beauteous, what more subtle charm The lovelier sister, and what golden hair Hung over her as sometimes shimmereth light From smallest dew-drop, else unseen, that crowns The slimmest grass of all the shaven green At morning. Love them by their names, for names They had, and speech that any word of ours Would drop between its letters uncontained; Love them, but hope not for impossible knowledge. In their small language they are not as we; Nor could, methinks, deliver with the tongue Our gravid notions; nor of this our world They speak, tho' earth-born, but have heritage From our confines, and property in all That thro' the net of our humanity Floats down the stream of things. Inheriting Below us even as we below some great Intelligence, in whose more general eyes Perchance Mankind is one. Neither have fear To scare them, drawing nigh, nor with thy voice To roll their thunder. Thy wide utterance Is silence to the ears it enters not, Raising the attestation of a wind, No more. As we, being men, nor hear but see The clamour and the universal tramp Of stars, and the continual Voice of God Calling above our heads to all the world.’ I like this better. Shall I try again? Wheugh! what a roomful; I'm not half-way round. Courage, Paul! one more venture! (Unrolls a scroll, and reads.) ‘Chamouni!’ ‘If Thou hast known anywhere amid a storm Of thunder, when the Heavens and Earth were moved, A gleam of quiet sunshine that hath saved Thine heart; Or where the earthquake hath made wreck, Knowest a stream, that wandereth fair and sweet As brooks go singing thro' the fields of home; Or on a sudden when the sea distent With windy pride, upriseth thro' the clouds To set his great head equal with the stars Hast sunk Hell-deep, thy noble ship a straw Betwixt two billows; Or in any wild Barbaric, hast, with half-drawn breath, passed by The sleeping savage, dreadful still in sleep, Scarred by a thousand combats, by his side His rugged spouse—in aught but sex a chief— Their babe between; Or where the stark roof-tree Of a burnt home blackened and sear lies dark, Betwixt the gaunt-ribbed ruin, hast thou seen The rose of peace; Or in some donjon deep, Rent by a giant in the blasted rock And proof against his peers,—hast thou beheld Prone in the gloom, naked and shining sad In her own light of loveliness, a fair Daughter of Eve: Then as thou seest God In some material likeness, less and more, Thou hast seen Chamouni, 'mid sternest Alps The gentlest valley; bright meandering track Of summer when she winds among the snows From Land to Land. Behold its fairest field Beneath the bolt-scarred forehead of the hills Low lying, like a heart of sweet desires, Pulsing all day a living beauty deep Into the sullen secrets of the rocks. Tender as Love amid the Destinies And Terrors; whereabout the great heights stand Down-gazing, like a solemn company Of gray heads met together to look back Upon a far fond memory of youth. Northward and southward of my hut, from heaven To earth, two gates of ice shut in the scene, As tho' between twin icebergs a green sea Had melted, and the summer sun and sky Shone in the waters. All the vale is flowers. Take thy staff shod with iron, gird thy loins For conflict. Let us to the northern gate! Is this a wood of pines? Are these but rocks, Hurled by the winter tempest? Did a chance O'erthrow these trunks—in the stern wont of war Supine? Or was it here the Thunderer smote The Giants—And the battered remnant stand Astonied giving glory to the Heavens? Aye, these are pines; but thou shalt turn and break The hugest on thy knee, having once passed Out of their umbrage, and in open day Fronted the everlasting looks of them Who sit beyond in council; round whose feet Are wrapped the shaggy forests, and whose beards, Down from the great height unapproachable, Descend upon their breasts. There, being old, All days and years they maunder on their thrones Mountainous mutterings, or thro' the vale Roll the long roar from startled side to side When whoso, lifting up his sudden voice, A moment speaketh of his meditation, And thinks again. There shalt thou learn to stand One in that company, and to commune With them, saying, “Thou, oh Alp, and thou, and thou And I.” Nathless, proud equal, look thou take Heed of thy peer, lest he perceive thee not,— Lest the wind blow his garment, and the hem Crush thee, or lest he stir, and the mere dust In the eternal folds bury thee quick! The forest now behind thee, at thy feet The torrent, thrust thine head back as who seeks The polestar; and above the mountains green, And o'er the shepherd's shealing,—less than nest On tree-top—and o'er woods that are as moss, Black on a ruin,—over the icy sea —A billowy Sibir of ten thousand hills As tho' yon white rocks, bending evermore So potently above the floods, begat A likeness, and from out their yielding breasts Compelled a brood of stone—o'er naked crags,— Aye, above where the shyest roe unseen Draws the thin breath, and marmot cannot pass The inexorable famine,—over wilds For ever dead, and snow, and upper snow, And wastes above the snow, see nearer heaven The base of a great pyramid, and rise Slow to this peak, like a grey pinnacle Of the towered earth piercing the cloudless skies. To us how calm and lonely, tenantless And silent as the still and empty air, But to that height the seldom mountaineer Looks from the extremest footing of some ridge Incredible, three times beyond our ken, And to his keen and upward-straining eyes Round it midway the circling eagles sail, As daws that round some thin and distant spire On English hill, scarce seen thro' lucent air Are motes in the evening sun. Drop from the Alp to lowest vale remote Breathless; nor be the first in that great fall. So yon dark glacier from his native snows Fell on the narrow valley, which beneath, Like a poor foundered skiff, when some vast whale In his unwieldy death-pang leaps and falls, Is sunk and lost. Grim with mortality, War-stained he lies in heavy length, and bleeds, A hill of death. Behold aloft the seas Whence he came down, unmelting seas of snow Well-named, the ocean of a frozen world. A marble storm in monumental rage, Ploughed on the fragment of a shattered moon. Passion at nought and strength still strong in vain, A wrestling giant, spell-bound, but not dead. As tho' the universal deluge passed These confines, and when forty days were o'er Knew the set time obedient and arose In haste: but Winter lifted up his hand And stayed the everlasting sign which strives For ever to return. Cold crested tides And cataracts more white than wintry foam Eternally in act of the great leap That never may be ta'en, these fill the gorge And rear upon the steep uplifted waves Immoveable, that proudly feign to go,— And on the awful ramparts of the rock Bend forward, as in motion—side by side Mixed manifold, rank after mingling rank, In all the throng of multitude, but each Condign, and in a personality Confest. Nor from the valley seen as waves. But as lone shepherd, on some battle hill, At setting of a chill moon on the wane, Beholds his heroes from their unknown graves Snow-cold, with blades of ice, out of the night, The peopled peopling night, o'er airy crag Crowding unstaunched invasion, with consent Of hands that point advance, and martial gaze Of helmèd heads, silent, majestical,— All ghosts! Or as some great acropolis, Above the wondering eyes of ancient men, On sacred feast, a statuary host, Sent out her idols round the incandent hill, And all her marble deities went by In solemn march, tall, white, innumerable, Each after each divine; while far beneath, Lone, like some shattered pillar of the skies, Half-buried by his fall, headlong and prone, The broken worship of a ruder race, A Greater lay. Or so methinks of old, Below a mount of Jewry, Dagon fell Before the Highest; and in him subdued From their high seats, fair bowers, dim haunts beloved, And temples of the abdicated earth, Upon a day the great mythology Came forth by legions to behold the sign. Dethroned, discrowned, divestured; with bare brows Paler than men; proud whispering as they pass, In murmur of a thousand waterfalls, While somewhat like the finger of the world Pointeth above their heads into the heavens, And crash as of avenging thunderbolts Pursues them,—nor can haste the step of gods. Low in the abject earth lies Chamouni,— Low in the last profound, whose narrow deep Seems from yon midway and diminished peak— So hunters say—who, clinging to the rock, Dizzy look down—a gulph of mountain-mist, Rainbowed, or if substantial, sunk and lost, Drowned in the abyss of air, and lapsed below Terrestrial, hopeless in a void of dreams. Beheld as one should spy from upper wave Of seas unsounded fathomless and dark, Low, thro' mysterious waters infinite, Illumined by a gleam, some jewelled mine Emerald and ruby flashing dreamy gold, Rent in the nether bed of the mid-main. Nor less above yon midway crag the calm Unventured summit, than if who descried The deep-sea gulph, with sudden gaze revert, Sees from his span of footing on the wave Far in unearthly ether unassailed, A great white cloud serene in sacred light And happy skies. Here, in the lowest vale, Sit we beside the torrent, till the goats Come tinkling home at eve, with pastoral horn Slow down the winding way, plucking sweet grass Amid the yellow pansies and harebells blue. “The milk is warm, The cakes are brown; The flax is spun, The kine are dry; The bed is laid, The children sleep; Come, husband, come, To home and me.” So sings the mother as she milks within The chalet near thee; singing so for him Whom every morn she sendeth forth alone Into the waste of mountains, to return At close of day as a returning soul Out of the infinite; lost in the whirl Of clanging systems and the wilderness Of all things, but to one remembered tryst, One human heart and unforgotten cell, True in its ceaseless self, and in its time Restored. But now the dusk which like a tarn Lay long since in the hollows of the hills, Swells from deep caves and tributary glens Unnumbered, till the lower mountain tops Are covered, and the dull and dead sea line Rests tideless on a shore of sacred snow. And now an unknown trouble has made cold Those higher Alpine foreheads whence supreme Over our darkness a serener day Looked westward and to all that we saw not, The glory and the loss. For they do watch The journey of the setting sun as one Who when the weaker inmates of the house Have sunk about his feet in dews and shades Of sorrow, watches still with brow of light And manly eye a brother on his way; But when the lessening face shines no return Thro' distance slowly lengthening and sinks slow Behind the hill-top, nor him. looking back, The straining sense discerns, nor the far sound Of wheels, stands fixed in sudden gloom profound, And thoughts more stern than woe. Over those heights Untrod, nor to be trodden, let thy soul Pass like a fleeting sunshine. Let it glide Over the summit, southward, and descend Where, thro' black mountains, a great river of snow Banked by two Alps, from the eternal source Whiter than clouds between the awful shores Shines to the valley. Meantime we below Tread the dark vale uplooking; or sit long, With hopeless upturned eyes, as one let down Into the abyss of everlasting night, From the impossible deep should gaze in vain Up through the silent chaos to the skirts Of ordered Nature. What is he, unseen, Who with the dreadful glacier as a sceptre Touches the vale, and in his left hand holds Yon rounded summit as an orb of state? Thou canst not see them now, but forth to meet The sovereign symbol, venerable woods Climb the huge steep where age and pride allow, And send their lither progeny to scale The bleaker rock, ambitious. These, inured, Attain the lower precipice, nor blench, Storm-bred: but these fall back aghast in sight Of everlasting Winter, where, snow-borne, In his white realm, for ever white, he sits Invisible to men; and in his works Gives argument of that which, seen, makes faint Aspiring Nature, and his throne a mount Not to be touched. On either wilderness A snow-land spreads along the level skies. Now from the eastward midnight draweth nigh, When all things rest from labour. As she goes Her vestments floating shut out moon and stars Mysterious; and she breathes before her face Darkness where all is dark. Mute goeth she, And silently on either hand unyokes The willing mountains from beneath their load Even now dispersing while the valley shakes, And in his bed the sleeping peasant stirs, And dreams of thunder. They, beheld no more, Leave only to the cataracts, and thee, The great snow baseless in mid-heaven, self-shown, Out-stretched and equal, like supporting wings, Or thro' the windy and tumultuous dark Down the long glacier sounding to the vale. There was a legend wild, whispered at eve, Late round the dying watch-fires to awed men, In those dead seasons whence our Danish sires, Of the Great Arctic Ghost, the efficient power And apparition of the frozen North, The mystic swan of Norna, the dread bird Of destiny, world wide, with roaring wings, Flapping the ice-wind and the avalanche, And white and terrible as polar snows. By them unseen behold it! thro' the night Swooping from heaven, its head to earth, its neck Down-streaming from the cloud; above the cloud Its great vans thro' a rolling dust of stars Thunderous descending in the rush of fate.’ After Mont Blanc one may sit down unblamed. Eh! this is tempting—these old eyes were dull Not to see this at room's-length! A veiled frame! Reverently set in honour, and once wreathed, It seems, with living flowers now long, long, dead! The veil of funeral black, embrowned with dust! A portrait as I guess—I'll see it. Enter Balder. Balder. Hold! 'Tis sacred! Doctor. Pardon, friend, you make me nervous,— I thought these heads said ‘Hold.’ Balder. They had cried out If I had held my peace. A time may come To raise that veil. Not now. Doctor. Your invalid? Balder. Not yet returned. I'll fetch her. [Goes to window. Look here, Paul! That figure stealing down the linden grove! 'Tis Evening, or 'tis she! she comes! she comes! Doctor. 'Tis a most happy symptom. Let her take Her will. I'll wait. Balder. Good God! she turns aside From the field-path into the winding track We used in other days. Doctor. Still happier sign! Nay, I'll not hurry her. Balder. Thanks, thanks. Doctor. But, friend, Hast thou no song to wear the hour away: I'm weary. Balder. Paul, thou art an emperor! Decree. Doctor. Thou hadst of old ‘a song of seasons,’ With dainty amours and a fire-side close Most comfortable. Balder. Ay, an evensong. [Goes to his harp, and sings. In the spring twilight, in the coloured twilight, Whereto the latter primroses are stars, And early nightingale Letteth her love adown the tender wind, That thro' the eglantine In mixed delight the fragrant music bloweth On to me, Where in the twilight, in the coloured twilight, I sit beside the thorn upon the hill. The mavis sings upon the old oak tree Sweet and strong, Strong and sweet, Soft, sweet, and strong, And with his voice interpreteth the silence Of the dim vale when Philomel is mute! The dew lies like a light upon the grass, The cloud is as a swan upon the sky, The mist is as a brideweed on the moon. The shadows new and sweet Like maids unwonted in the dues of joy Play with the meadow flowers, And give with fearful fancies more and less, And come, and go, and flit A brief emotion in the moving air, And now are stirred to flight, and now are kind, Unset, uncertain, as the cheek of Love. As tho' amid the eve Stood Spring with fluttering breast, And like a butterfly upon a flower, Spreading and closing with delight's excess, A-sudden fanned and shut her tinted wings. In the spring twilight, in the coloured twilight, Ere Hesper, eldest child of Night, run forth On mountain-top to see If Day hath left the dale, And hears, well-pleased, the dove From ancient elm and high In murmuring dreams still bid the sun good-night, And sound of lowing kine, And echoes long and clear, And herdsman's evening call, And bells of penning folds, Sweet and low; Oh maid, as fair as thou Behold the young May moon! Oh! happy, happy maid, With love as young as she In the spring twil ght, in the coloured twilight, Meet, meet me, by the thorn upon the hill. [Interlude of Music. At the midsummer, at the high midsummer, Deep in the darkness let me sit embowered All alone; What time the children of the earth and heaven, As of two houses whom a feud divides, Meet in the mingling mystery of midnight, And melting clouds sink low with woers' tears, Felt but unseen, dropping a balm of joy Whereto the love-touched leaves Tremble and whisper thro' the gentle land. The incense riseth and the incense falleth And all the stolen hour is stirred with kisses, And silent loves constrain the passionate time; Rich loves that as they list Exchange and take and give Unmeted mede and debts for ever due. And sweets are mixed along the languid air Like balmy breath of lovers warm and near, And glowing faces meeting thro' the dark. Hush! for the world stands still Held in mere joy, as nought on earth would lose The happy place and moment where it stood. Hush! o'er a stillness, still as Love's delight, Hearts gushing, bosoms heaving, moving arms Winding, unwinding; lips that close and part And love still ending and beginning; Hush! Put back the dawn, O Phosphor! Set again! Fall like a sweet drop from the honeyed heavens! Go down, and carried by a tender cloud! The exquisite best moment of the night Sinks down with thee. This is the ecstasy! It sheds, it sheds! The night is filled with flowers, ——The viewless night, faint night, the yielding night, The favouring night,—with flowers and happy rain! As tho' to-morrow's blossoms spreading odours As they float Soft thro' the season, shy thro' the dark season, Like a warm dew sank murmuring from the skies. [Interlude of Music. Fall, fall, fall, Fall, fall, fall, Oh orchard fruit fall from the fading tree, Fall fruit of Autumn on the sullen sod, Heavy and dead as clods into a grave. Fall, fall, fall, Fall, fall, fall, Lone lingering rose thou knowest all must die! Canst thou convince the breeze of spring, or blush The summer thro' the cheeks of sallow day? Thou, sick with solitude, and blanched with tears? Fall, fall, fall, Fall, fall, fall, Sere leaf that quiverest thro' the sad still air, Sere leaf that waverest down the sluggish wind, Sere leaf that whirlest on the Autumn gust, Free in the ghastly anarchy of death. The sad still air which as a alkahest, Potent and silent doth dissolve the year; The sluggish wind that as a red stream slow With carnage welters dull, and steams with death; The sudden gust that like a headsman wild, Uplifteth Beauty by her golden hair, To show the world that she is dead indeed! Fall, fall, fall, Fall, fall, fall, Fall twilight rain that dost not strive nor cry, But chillest all the time with silent sorrow; And not a wind does violence, nor a plaint Stirs the dank quiet of the latter leaves; But—as in speechless looks of him who stands, Withered and wan by the wayside of Fate, Timeless, unwelcome, all his better lot Outlived, and the dear fashion of his day And race forgotten, bended to his ill, And lifting not the unavailing voice Which no man heedeth—lorn and stillest tears Grow in the fade eyes of the relict world. [Interlude of Music. Trim the lamp, Pile the fire; Brim the cup, Touch the strings; Sigh of love, Sing of joy; Trill of maids, Chant of men! Oh the young, And the fair; Oh the love, And the wine; Log of Yule, Log of Yule, In thy glamour They shine! For an hour We are gods, And of all Love hath given Lacking none From our world See the sun Of our days! Round the forms That to-day Blushed with life Meet and smile All the shapes Of the past In the light Glimmer pale. Early loves, Friends of yore, Ancient eyes, Voices old, Where the blaze Charms the air By our hearth Come again. And the sounds And the dreams And the quick And the dead In spell-dance Move round me, In murmur And maze. Oh ye Loves! Oh ye Days! Oh ye Dead! Oh ye Dreams! Bar the door, Bar the door, With a shout, Shut them in! For all the outer world is rocked in war! The powers of harm break faith, and in mad might Yell for the rout and will not be denied! Even now the hungry sea begins to wreck, And the impatient storms, eager for ill, Bide not the expected signal, but blow out The lingering Light that flickered in the west. To-day is dead an hour before his time! Good spells are broken, and the shrieking night, Down from the haunted and mysterious hills, Comes black and shuddering, wrapped about with snows, Like a starved Ethiop sheeted from the grave. SCENE XXIV. The Study. Balder, solus, writing. Enter Amy. Amy. I have somewhat to say: let me come close, Close to thine ear; my husband, I am well! Balder. Thy pain?—— Amy. Gone! I am well; speak very low; The butterfly fresh from his living grave Feels not so frail and new. Hist, not a word, 'Tis resurrection morning; I am free. Balder. My poor child—— Amy. Nay, I know; I am not mad; Hush! for I think a whisper would disturb This footing; I am well, so well! I feel I have slipped through the chains that held me down; I could move like a mote thro' the warm air Up to the hills. Let us go to the hills. Hush, do not answer. I have spoken now. I though it would not last while I could tell thee. [Exit. Balder (going to his harp and touching a solemn sweet air). I praise thee, mother earth! oh earth, my mother! Oh earth, sweet mother! gentle mother earth! Whence thou receivest what thou givest I Ask not as a child asketh not his mother, Oh earth, my mother! [Amy reappears, habited. Balder. And thy lute, Amy? I will bring thy lute. Nay, my poor nightingale, and art thou dumb By day? But thou wilt be the lark, my child, So near heaven's gate. Look to the morning hills, With such a golden tumult over them As if the everlasting port above For the imperial Sun did ope and close With clangor. Well, well, I'll not let thee sing, But thou shalt murmur to me as the dove When she alit upon the mountain-top And found the leaf of peace. And I will make Thy lute-strings shimmer as the sunshine shook About her as she murmured. [Takes up his hat and staff. My Alp stick! I think thou art King Edward's staff to-day, For I feel more than king and half confessor. [They pass side by side into the fields. Amy. The hay, the new-mown hay! the birds, the birds! Balder. The audible soul of the warm balmy wind That moves in music. Yonder pensive thrush Singing his rhythmic cadence, and, below, The blackbird, earnest in the flowering thorn, Chanting his mellow prose as tho' he told A wonted story, ever old and new! The fitful chaffinch, like a bashful youth That hurries forth his love in sudden speech And blushing pause, the loud and cheerful wren, The sparrow's chirp, the swallow on the wall— The swallow that pours out her liquid joy Upon the morning flood of happiness, Wherein it falls with silver sound and sweet As water into water; these, and all The warbling voices breathing of the South, The slender treble of the tuneful year With throbbing throats that chorus sunshine thro' The vocal world, dainty, and soft, and low! And high o'er all a languid noise of rooks, Lost in bright air, circling in sunny calm, Or cawing from the haunt of oaken green The leafy rest of June! [They enter a meadow of flowers. Amy. See! Balder. Seems it not, My Amy, that this prattling Babe, the Earth, Sole sitting at the footstool of the Heaven, Strives to repeat her stars? Amy. Yes. Balder. Thy small feet May tread the pathway careless of the dews: We mortals are contemned of Nature,—she Casts not her pearls before us. But look, Amy, This blade of grass from the untrodden field, This green perfection of abundant health, Complete with dew. Herein behold why Nature Is the one Teacher whom the Poet needs, For she alone can show him in her works Consummate art, and that supreme excess Which fashions her fair work until the bound Of possible performance, and the verge Of the wrapt heart's belief; and while we say, ‘Behold the final good!’ sprinkles a dew, And with divine complacence, passeth both. Or having wrought her statue from a block Infallible, with an unfailing hand Quickens the faultless whole, and with a touch Makes cold Perfection live. With her he sees Not only snow, but driven snow, nor driven snow But on the sacred summit of an Alp Immaculate, and on the whitest peak, Whiter than white; the flower not only fair, But fragrant, and the light not only warm, The fire not only bright; the summer fruit Sweet to the taste but sweeter to the eye, And over all its tangible a bloom That never can be touched. She, only she, In her least work, as in her greatest, shows To his confessing eyes the unattained And unattainable, and tho' his pride, Stung to its strength, outstrain the furthest stretch Of man, and bring the trophies of the world, She, still unsatisfied, by Day and Night Points upward, saying,—‘Be ye perfect as Your Father in the Heavens!’ Thou hearest me not; Thy cheek is wet with tears; thou art pale and red; Amy, my little child! Amy. Oh, Love, I live! I am! I feel! The Earth is not a dream! The Prison doors are broken! I am free! I stand forth in the sun! I know the wind! The utter world doth touch me! I can grasp The hands that stretch forth from the mystery That passeth! I am crowded with my life! It is too much! the vital march doth stop To press about me! Air, give air—too much, Too much—forgive, forgive, forgive—— Balder. My Loved! My Lost! my Wept! my early-risen! I clasp thee Fresh from the dead! 'Tis past; new-waked from sleep Sudden amid the concourse of sweet sounds, The rush, the pageant tumult, and this tramp Of Being, the weak sense bewildered laughs And weeps by turns. Amy. Husband, till now, thy speech Was my sole music, whereunto I kept The maimed attendance of these feeble feet; To-day 'tis but a note—the first, the best— In somewhat that fills all this sunshine space With sound——since 'tis for sound to stir the heart Unseen. Balder. Here let us rest. Thou hast said well 'Tis Resurrection-day. For I remember Once in a sleep of childhood I looked forth Thro' a wide summer window, on a still And Garden-world. Eden, as at the first I saw, and all the summers since the first, Above it like a golden silent sea, Lay warm and sweet and slumb'rous, soaking deep All things in honeyed light—flowers, fruits, and trees, Which breathed their gums and amber, and let down From their festooned fair tops that no wind stirred Visible odours—and the tepid Lakes And the dissolving Hills. And far below, Down thro' green warmth of the relaxed sod To hidden secrets of the inner Earth Slow sank incumbent, sinking, sinking Light. 'Twas Resurrection-morn. Where I beheld City had never stood, nor ways of men, Nor place of funeral. But the Dead came up Like spring-Flowers, white and golden, thro' the ground, Lifting a little earth, as snowdrops lift, On their strange heads. This morning, as I stood Beside my open window, ere thou camest, And looked upon the day, methought I saw My childhood's dream. Is it a dream? For thou Art such a thing as one might think to see Upon a footstone, sitting in the sun, Beside a broken Grave! [They sit musing. Amy. Thou hast been silent So long, that the slow shade of the tree-top Moved like a dark hand o'er the grass, and took Another daisy. Balder. I do know this moment! This is the very wind that long ago In the first morning of sweet life we breathed By the open gate of Love, when thou and I Went happy in together, knowing not The place, nor heeding if 'twere Earth or no. We were so young, thou wert so pure, the woes And weary ills that keep the gate of Love Looked on us as on shapes concerning whom They had no charge; the guardians of the trees Slept all, and with us the sublimer Fates Dealt softly as with children. Did we dream A dream of years upon some flowery knoll, And do we wake where we lay down? Is this The outer world? Is this the common day Of all the living? Oh Amy! my own child, I could believe this fancy; never since I felt this wind upon me in my youth Have I beheld thee as now. Dost thou remember The old days when at trysting-time thou camest Forth down the winding valley to the stile To meet me, and beside me all the sweet Meandering way trode back in silent joy, With downcast eyes that ever sought the ground, But tell-tale smiles that could not choose but come Me-ward; quick smiles that every word of mine Stirred up anew so often that they met Like sudden roses caught in a warm wind, And did provoke each other, ruffling sweets In dear confusion, and in all the change Of my swift fancy changing till they lay Upon thee like the thousand lines of light Upon the shimmering water that the west Moves with a sigh? So we past slowly on, And so, fond gazing on thy silent face, I poured the glorious wine of love into A vase of crystal, where it blushed and shone More fair. Sometimes I marvel when I think Of those first days of love; love that unknown Knew not himself, and still went in and out Among the happy inmates of the heart As an unconscious prophet walks amid His brethren ere his equal lips be touched With the live coals of fire. I that so long Spake, and we knew not that I spake of love Because it filled my speech, and being all Seemed nothing, I who that I saw it not Never believed it present, nor remembered That the sole face on which I cannot look Is this men know for mine—how did I win thee? Canst tell me? Amy. I can sing a little song. [She sings. The sun he riseth up on new year's day, And looketh on the earth and goeth down; The earth she stirreth to be looked upon. The faithful sun he riseth day by day, And looketh on the earth and goeth down; The earth she trembleth to be looked upon. The faithful sun he riseth day by day, And looketh on the earth and goeth down; The earth she blusheth to be looked upon. The faithful sun he riseth day by day, And looketh on the earth and goeth down; The earth she smileth to be looked upon. The faithful sun he riseth day by day, And looketh on the earth and goeth down; The earth she sigheth to him from the south; The earth she stands before him all in flowers; The many-voiced earth, she calleth him; She singeth at his chamber that he rise, And long time holdeth him lest he go down. Balder. Thou wert as silent as a bird that sits On her dear treasure, and while steps pass nigh Is hushed and hid, but, when the plunderer nears And only silence could have saved her, cries. I ne'er forget my little Amy's face Upon the blessed chance that owned us one; The happy chance that struck me by her side, And all heard that which else had died unheard! Amy. How did she look? Balder. She looked in her surprise As when the Evening-Star ta'en unaware, While fearless she pursues across the Heaven Her Lover Sun,—and on a sudden stands Confest in the pursuit before a world Upgazing—in her maiden innocence Disarms us, and so looks that she becomes A worship evermore. The bare hill-top Shines near above us; I feel like a child Nursed on his grandsire's knee that longs to stroke The bald bright forehead; shall we climb? [They ascend the hill. The fort Is won, and here I plant the stalwart sign Of sovereignty. A little while this staff Shall be the solar centre of creation. All that thou seest is thine! [He lies down. How passing sweet To rest the weight of this mortality Upon such friendly turf, while the free soul Released from earthly shackles shines a star, Above the great horizon of this world, Giving and taking Light. Lo, the wide sea Of air from the high shore whereon we lie, To the far mountains. Thou couldst lay thy fair And buoyant breast upon it, and go down Into the limpid ocean as the swan Goes down into the lake. How strange to know Yon dim old British camp across a plain Of fifty waving miles. Dost thou remember, Dear love, when we two in the central green Of that mauled mountain which our giant sires Had clipped and cropped as 'twere a Dutch-land tree, Sat a long summer day, and far and near Saw the great martial circles widening out Ring after ring, as tho' the snake that dwells In the world's core had wound him forth and lay Motionless in the sunshine, coil in coil, His great head in the midst, and the green grass Sprang up and knew him not, his one hour's sleep A thousand years. Hark, hark, the gathering herds Round the low valley pool. What! tears again! Bright summer showers! Amy. Oh love, the song of life! Oh love, the music of the world! my ears Are open! since the years I was a child I have not heard it! Tho' mine eyes have seen The ordered pomp and sacred dance of things, And marvelled at the measure, it passed on In silence, but to-day, to-day, I hear The voice to which it moves! Too sweet, too sweet. [They pause. Balder. And now my years come on me, and the life That shall be! I am faint with too much light, But as a death-bed soul exults in death, My spirit soars triumphant as I sink. The day is full of suns; I lie a-dream, And o'er me the colossus of my fate Stands to the white heavens from the shadeless earth, And casts no shadow! This is that same hour That I have seen before me as a star Seen from a rushing comet thro' the black And forward night, which orbs, and orbs, and orbs, Till that which was a shining spot in space Flames out between us and the universe, And burns the heavens with glory. [Pauses. Now I live! The weakness has gone by. This seasoned body O'ermasters the strong element, and turns The potent draught to balm; the Olympian wine That made me reel throbs thro' these larger veins A nobler blood. Come such a day as melts The hard earth back to her primeval drop, And I could look it in the face! my chains Break from my ampler limbs. If thou didst start I could believe that I sprang up a god, And am a god for ever. Do not kiss me, Lest the remembered touch of those dear lips Bring back a mortal pleasure. Amy, Amy, Will we not save the world? Amy. 'Tis a fair world! Balder. Look down upon it in the sunny haze Of silent noon, sole in the void of heaven Asleep, divine with the unconscious smile Of everlasting beauty. A well-spread And ordered world; not the bright elements Innumerous of unrespective change, The broken argosy of the universe On spangled waters; but a multiform Supreme event, the single continent Of all; like immaterial deity, Full of the coloured thought of an unmade Creation. Amy. 'Tis thy kingdom, 'tis thy kingdom, My king, my king! Balder. I will arise and reign: As God contains the world I will contain Mankind, and in the solvent of my soul The peopled and unpeopled ages. They, Born and unborn, are one in me, and freed From the disturbing thrall of space and time Take each and all, in one eternal whole, Ordained places, like a heaven of stars. Thou hast said well 'tis a fair world, but what Do the trees hide? and yon far cloud of smoke Over the sulphurous city? Amy, Amy, I yearn towards my race! I have been like A prophet fallen on his prostrate face Upon the hill of fire. Mine hour is come, The earthquake has yawned by me, I have seen The seething core of nature, both these ears Are deaf with voices, I am blind with light, My heart is full of thunder! In the form Of manhood I will get me down to man! As one goes down from Alpine tops with snows Upon his head, I, who have stood so long On other Alps, will go down to my race, Snowed on with somewhat out of Divine air, And merely walking thro' them with a step God-like to music like the golden sound Of Phœbus' shouldered arrows, I will shake The laden manna round me as I shake Dews from this morning tree. And they shall see And eat, and eating live, and living know, And knowing worship. We will lead the flocks Of the whole earth, walking before with staves Of light—— Amy. I—I, too, even I? ah, husband, To feel beside thee! Balder. But I see them, Amy, Whitening the world like harvest. Wheresoe'er We stay they pasture; in the temperate sun Disport on hills for ever green and fair, Or at our word with universal feet Pass to new fields, their great sound overhead Borne like a banner: under favouring skies Drink of salubrious streams, in innocent lands Lie down to harmless sleep, and rise with us To follow day and summer round the globe! Amy. My husband! Balder. Sing a song of love to me, This glory burns me up; fetch me some tears. Amy (sings). There grew a lowly flower by Eden-gate Among the thorns and thistles. High the palm Branched o'er her, and imperial by her side Upstood the sunburnt Lily of the east. The goodly gate swung oft with many gods Going and coming, and the spice-winds blew Music and murmurings, and paradise Welled over and enriched the outer wild. Then the palm trembled fast-bound by the feet, And the imperial Lily bowed her down With yearning, but they could not enter in. The lowly flower she looked up to the palm And lily, and at eve was full of dews, And hung her head and wept and said, ‘Ah these Are tall and fair, and shall I enter in?’ There came an angel to the gate at even, A weary angel, with dishevelled hair; For he had wandered far, and as he went, The blossoms of his crown fell one by one Thro' many nights, and seemed a falling star. He saw the lovely flower by Eden-gate, And cried, ‘ah, pure and beautiful!’ and turned And stooped to her and wound her in his hair, And in his golden hair she entered in. Husband! I was the weed at Eden-gate, I looked up to the lily and the palm Above me, and I wept and said, ‘ah these Are tall and fair, and shall I enter in?’ And one came by me to the gate at even, And stooped to me and wound me in his hair And in his golden hair I entered in Balder. Nay the poor wanderer, fallen from heaven, drew near The guarded gate; but with his forfeit skies Had lost his privilege and master-sign, And turned aside and plucked an asphodel, And, wearing, passed unchallenged. Amy. Hist! who comes? Ah husband, we must be alone to-day! I feel new-married and do blush to speak. Let us go hence. Balder. An artist by his satchel. Lie silent he will pass us. (Starts up.) What! my comrade! Artist. My old friend! Balder. Welcome! but how many days Before your assignation? Artist. Fairly asked. Sooth is, I was a wooer of Dame Nature Down in your sylvan valley there. My goddess Left me love-tokens, but denied herself; I wearied, you may guess; and every night Looked upward to these western tops and saw Her footsteps, and the cloudy draperies She put aside in passing, closing red Behind her, dyed with honour. So I came To sit here and waylay her. Balder. Amy, this Is that good Gerald whom thou knowest well By many a song and fireside history. Dear old companion, we must meet again; This is a sweet and solemn festival Which we two keep together, she and I. But ere you leave us for my sake remember One of the songs we used to sing of old; We sang it three at once, and it was called ‘The Song o' the Sun.’ The glowing orb of joy Within my head must shine, or 'twill consume me. You, each of you, chime in the needful chorus. I am the sun! Artist. With all my heart. Begin. Balder. Thou knowest it, little Amy? Amy. Did I e'er Forget a word of thine? [Balder rises to his feet. Artist. Phœbus-Apollo! Balder. Earliest bird Thou hearest me, Me afar off Thro' the dark. Roll O days into the years, and O years into the ages, and O ages into the mystery of God! Oh Love, oh Life, and all ye jocund train Virtues and Joys, my lusty Company, Be loud around me! Sing because I sing! Call each to each as I call unto you! Love calling unto Life ‘Oh Life! Oh Life!’ Life calling unto Love ‘Oh Love! Oh Love!’ ‘How beautiful oh Life!’ ‘How beautiful oh Love!’ I am the sun singing behind the mountains! Thou heaven, that didst watch for me on the hills, Sitting upon the hill-tops above the valley of beauty, Thou hearest me afar off singing behind the mountains, And hast let fall thy mourning, and thy bosom is pale. Also blushes are on thy cheeks lest I see thee, oh thou most beautiful. But I will see thee, O thou most beautiful! Robe thee in purple, take thy clouds about thee, Rise up, O queen, with gold upon thy brows, Behold I reach thee forth my golden sceptre, Behold I give thee morning as a garment, Sit on thy hill, and I will touch thy hill, And thou shalt sit upon a diamond throne, And shalt be glorified before my world! For I see thee, O thou most beautiful! Quiet valley, valley deep and still, Dost thou hear my voice behind the mountains? I will come gently as a father peepeth Over the cot, over the cot of beauty, So will I lift my face up over thee. Love, love, love, how beautiful oh love! Art thou well-awakened, little flower? Are thine eyelids open, little flower? Are they cool with dew, O little flower? Hath the south touched thee? Hath the fairy kissed thee? Wilt thou come forth, come forth, into my day? Ringdove, ringdove, This is my golden finger Between the upper branches of the pine! Come forth, come forth, and sing into my day! Butterfly, butterfly, This is my golden finger, I will feel for thee down among the roses, Sweet in the roses, in the climbing roses, And put thee from thy bed into my day! Love, love, love, how beautiful, O love! I will arise, I will awake the world! They shall be glad because of me, I feel The joy-light shining thro' their lids of sleep, Like music from the hollow of the earth! [They sing. It is time, O ye leaves, On the tree-tops Of morning; Laugh down The trees, That the pastures May wake! Awake! It is time, O ye streams, On the hill-tops Of morning; Run down The hills, That the valleys May wake! Awake! It is time O ye bells, In the grey spire Of morning; Ring down The spire, That the hamlet May wake! Awake! I am the sun, I am above the mountains, My joy is on me, I will give you day! I will spend day among you like a king! Your water shall be wine because I reign! I stave my golden vintage on the mountains, And all your rushing rivers run with day! I am the sun, I am above the mountains! Arise, my hand is open, it is day! Rise! as men strike a bell and make it music, So have I struck the earth and made it day! Move, move, O world, on all your brazen hinges, Send round the thunder of your golden wheels; Throng out, O millions, out, O shouting millions; Throng out, O millions, shouting, shouting day! For as one blows a trumpet through the valleys, So from my golden trumpet I blow day! O earth, O flowers, O birds, O,O men, Day is proclaimed! I called until I heard The caverns echo! Day is everywhere! White-favoured day is sailing on the sea, And, like a sudden harvest in the land, The windy land is waving gold with day! As for you whom I have awakened, do As shall seem good in all your shining eyes, Your eyes still wet with morning. They shall dry, And day shall fade. But I have done my task: Do yours! And what is this that I have given, And wherefore? look ye to it! As ye can, Be wise and foolish to the end. For me, I, under all heavens, go forth praising God! Artist. I also. And I also singing lauds To see you both so happy. [Exit. Balder. Brave old friend! Amy. Shall we walk, husband, to yon shady tree Above the little stream? [They walk. Balder. Alas! that one Should use the days of summer but to live, And breathe but as the needful element The strange superfluous glory of the air! Nor rather stand apart in awe beside The untouched Time, and saying o'er and o'er In love and wonder, ‘these are summer days.’ Amy. Let us sit here. [They sit. Balder. Under this ash, last spring, I saw a sight more sweet than ever clown Came on a-sudden in a fairy-ring By summer moon. A growth of primroses, Thick as the stars by night, and like the stars In constellations and in orbits due, Shone round the central tree. I could believe Queen Flora, on a royal progress tired, Halted beneath it, and her flowery court Pitched their fair tents about her, or, well-pleased, Sole or by twins, in fragrant converse, lay Upon the enchanted ground. Thou hadst a song, A country song, a chanted calendar, Fit to be timbrelled to the tambourine— [Amy interrupts him. Amy (sings). First came the primrose, On the bank high, Like a maiden looking forth From the window of a tower When the battle rolls below, So looked she, And saw the storms go by. Then came the wind-flower In the valley left behind, As a wounded maiden pale With purple streaks of woe When the battle has rolled by Wanders to and fro, So tottered she, Dishevelled in the wind. Then came the daisies, On the first of May, Like a bannered show's advance While the crowd runs by the way, With ten thousand flowers about them they came trooping through the fields. As a happy people come, So came they, As a happy people come, When the war has rolled away, With dance and tabor, pipe and drum, And all make holiday. Then came the cowslip, Like a dancer in the fair, She spread her little mat of green, And on it danced she. With a fillet bound about her brow, A fillet round her happy brow, A golden fillet round her brow, And rubies in her hair. No more, no more, for I am tired of singing, I'll make a garland, as in olden days, And crown thee as of old. [She runs off to neighbouring flowers. Balder. Thou most pure essence, Wilt thou exhale i' the sun? Being from me Tho' but a little way mine eyes do fear To leave thee, as they fear to leave the light In a dew-drop. Happy perchance for thee, If the spell brake and light returned to light! Yet the strong Fate that mixed us hath wrought well. I am for thee; thou mightest have crossed this world Among our grosser motions as a spirit Unseen, nor having organs to discourse The rare ethereal of its too divine And necessary beauty; but O soul, O woman mere and absolute, O Amy! Upon a sacred moment thou didst come Into the body of my Love and Power, And henceforth art a worship, being seen And known unto the eyes and hearts of men For ever; to whom temples shall be built, And nations offer gifts of sighs and tears. Thou, little one, who sittest twining flowers, White flowers that lie like dew upon thy breast Thou fairer blossom, and salutest each With such new joy and fond discovery As if thou least of living things couldst spare A loveliness, and to thee most of all 'Twere wondrous to be fair,—Thou who, too rich And poor, when thy dear arms are round my neck Hast no belief in human lot more proud, Nor knowledge of a place in the wide world So regal—little knowing what thou art,— If I could tell thee all, wouldst thou grow pale And tremble? I know not. Nay if this hour The green hill and the world below the hill Fell from thee, and thou shining like a saint Ineffable in mid heaven wert left bare To the assembled and upturned gaze Of this great Universe, I could believe Thou wouldst no more than lift up thy pure eyes Unconscious, and walk forth among the stars, As in a planted garden. Well for thee, Dear child, in thine eternal childhood more Than I who wrestling would join arms with gods! Do these things haunt thee? Dost thou ever dream That thro' all human precincts evermore, Wherever Love hath honour and Beauty fame Thou shalt be welcome? Dost thou think at all Of those who in the centuries to come Shall seek thee? Men who in a golden time, Noblest, shall rule a nobler race than ours. These shall have read the shining scroll on high And known what thoughts they be that God writes down Upon his starry tablets, and for these, Full-grown, this Mother Earth round whom to-day Men stand as children spelling Truths unknown, Shall close the open book upon her knee, And tell out of her deep invisible heart The secrets of her youth! But these shall pause To hear thee, Amy; bending from their thrones, Among which thou with simple step and sweet, Dressed in thy country life, goest in and out By right, for thou art mine! In penury, In cold oblivion, in a tortured life, Have strange looks lightened from thee? Hast thou seen How proud they are who in the years to be Would give their queenly crowns to change one day With thee, or have it for a moment said Of them as it shall be for ever said Of Amy? Has it been that thou hast lain Grandly upon the racking hours, aye curved The paly channels of thy tears with pride? Smile on, for well thou may'st! If haughty eyes Refuse thee, and the front of jewelled state Thine unadorned poor presence, if false tongue Blaspheme thee, or cold heart look lightly on Thy woe, doth ever music in the air Perplex thee? Doth the mist of morning shape Altar and arch and all the fretted pile Pompous and grey, where men one day shall sit Upon the graves of them who passed thee by, And use their sculptured pride to rest the weight Of the forgotten flesh that the wrapt soul May hear me well because I speak of Thee, In terror or in beauty? And my love A rushing mighty wind goes thro' the place In thunders whereat underfoot the dead Move the cold stones, and the great roofs and aisles Are shaken as with passion! And thou, Amy, As a white bird across a sunset sky In likeness of an angel to and fro High wingest thro' the tumult of the dome, In the red windy music. Or, the storm Being spent, and stillness like the sudden dark Fallen on the listening senses, in the pause I breathe upon the dumbness of the air And heal it, and my breath sweet thro' the hush Floodeth the fragrant silence which unstirred Fills full of me, as an unclouded noon Of balmy light; and thro' that golden noon Thou sinkest slow while reverent heads are bowed, And bosoms heave, and the cold thrill of awe Pales the proud face and bends the feeble knees As if a God came down. For thou art mine, And I will have it so. Amy (returning). A crown! a crown! Balder. My beautiful! Amy. Am I? Then give me now The long long promised lesson; teach me what Is beauty. I am very well to-day, My brain is like that sea of glass and fire Whereof we read together, whereupon The angels walked. Let them walk thro' my soul. Dost thou remember idle days when we Lay here, and thou didst roll the broken rocks That spun into the valley round as stars? So take the worlds and bowl them round about me, For well I think thou canst; and I'll not flinch; Nay try me! Balder. And thou liest among the bells And blossoms, and lookest up to any star, And thinkest in some Angel's face to read The mystery of beauty? Loveliness Is precious for its essence; time and space Make it nor near nor far nor old nor new, Celestial nor terrestrial. Seven snowdrops Sister the pleiads, the primrose is kin To Hesper, Hesper to the world to come! For sovereign Beauty as divine is free; Herself perfection, in herself complete, Or in the flowers of earth or stars of heaven. Merely contained in the seven-coloured bow Arching the globe, and still contained in each Of all its raindrops. This, my thought, I give To thee, and am no poorer; no, nor thou Still giving, nor a singular of all Who ever shall possess it, tho' my thought Become the equal birthright of unborn Nations of men, in every heart a whole. There cannot be a dimple on the cheek But all an everlasting soul hath smiled; Day is but day to all the eyes on earth, No less than day to mine. Love strong as death Measures eternity and fills a tear; And beauty universal may be touched As at the lips in any single rose. See how I turn toward the turf, as he Who after a long pilgrimage once more Beholds the face that was his desert dream, Turning from heaven and earth bends over it, And parts the happy tresses from her brow, Counting her ringlets, and discoursing bliss On every hint of beauty in the dear Regained possession, oft and oft retraced, So could I lie down in the summer grass Content, and in the round of my fond arm Enclose enough dominion, and all day Do tender descant, owning one by one Floweret and flower, and telling o'er and o'er The changing sum of beauty, still repaid In the unending task for ever new, And in a love which first sees but the whole, But when the whole is partially beloved Doth feast the multitude upon the bread Of one, endow the units with no less Than all, and make each meanest integer The total of my joy. Yet I have stood And clasped the earth as if she were a maid; And held her, bearing all her sparkling stars Upon her like a vase of Castalie Upon a Greek girl's head, and made my boast Of her, and as a lover let her fill My feeding eyes! Or I have hovered far Upon the verge of all things, and beheld The round globe as a fruit upon a tree, The spangled tree that night by starry night Stands o'er us, and have seen an angel pass, Pluck it and cool his lips, and drop the hull To chaos, and this earth, that I have loved And worshipped, fall out of the universe As unrespected as a dead leaf falls From summer aspen, while the innumerous stars Twinkled and quivered in the wind of God Walking between the shade of fruited heavens Untold as once between the river-trees Of Eden. But wherever I beheld Or one or every one, the whole or part, Some better thing that is not either or all For ever putteth forth from all and each A hand, and toucheth me, as he of old Was touched in sleep; and I as one in sleep Know not or how or where, but, having felt, Believe, and serve the Invisible Unknown, Calling it Beauty. Therefore in sweet awe Tread the bright mystery of the sod beneath Thy feet, thou priest of Beauty! who dost stand Bareheaded neath the stars, nor dare to slight Her presence in the floweret of the field! Beware, for beauty, as a maid, delights In summer ambush. Often the mere hem And flutter of her garment doth betray Her covert; or low murmurings of the leaves O'er-fond about her naked loveliness, Or jealous whisperings of envious winds, Or voice of birds when her unwonted smile Makes sudden sunshine in the dusky dell, Or stir of showers that fall like kisses on her, Or song of streams made happy by her limbs, Is all her bruit. And oft she buried is —Rapt from her upper realm by gnomes and ghouls, A moment powerful in the pause of Fate. And her immortal body thrust in haste Below the earth some lingering tress reveals That floateth like a floweret in the wind. There shalt thou stand, and say thy counter-spell, Bard of the future! Master-Prophet! Man Of men, at whose strong girdle hang the keys Of all things! Lo, the gaping earth and all The breathing presence of the Goddess risen, At thy shrunk side full statured from the grave. Amy. Art thou not he? Balder. The day shall answer. Amy. I Will answer for the day. And being He Thou must be born to feel as no man felt Before thee. Husband, to be born to feel As no man felt before thee! I do yearn To know! Not yonder panting lamb that kneels To drink is more athirst— Balder. My beaming Amy! I stroke the tresses from thine eager brow, And looking on thee deem the prodigy Already wrought. Amy. Thou wilt not mock me, husband; Thou must have somewhat in thee hid and deep, Which, when the future Truth shall be revealed, Will rise to meet it. Try thy soul for me With many thoughts as fishers try a lake With flies; it may be thou shalt find a shape Whereunto something in thy soul shall rise That never yet hath risen. Hast thou no guess Like the dim pictures of a blind man's brain, Or as altho' thou touch me in the dark I know the hand is thine. Balder. The man born blind, Having felt fire and handled a round ball, Hath better image of the luminous sun, Nay is more able to conceive the truth Of some ethereal colour indescript By gross experiment and thick contact Of palpable occasion, than my soul To know the Absolute. Nevertheless, I have my blind man's dream, and tell it thee As Blind to Blind. In Deity, my child, There is which no man hath seen, nor can see, Nor in the eternity to come will see. To know it undestroyed were to be God Indeed. That Work of God's which is concrete Of this tremendous attribute we name Sublime; and in the corporal Idol own What angels and archangels in their hour Of ecstasy when they look up to God Undazzled, and outpierce the watching eyes Ineffable before the throne that from Eternity and to Eternity Ever awake and waking ever new From a past lesser sense as from a sleep In the unchanging Glory more and more And more for ever and for ever know— Day without dark—a still increasing light, Cannot behold. We feel annihilation As 'twere afar off, and mortality Is moved with muffled pangs. For so God wills His worship, and the strange perfunctory flesh Hath charge concerning us and bids the soul To rites unknown, as a dumb servitor His Lord to prayer. Also there is in God Which being seen would end us with a shock Of pleasure. It may be that we should die As men have died of joy, all mortal powers Summed up and finished in a single taste Of superhuman bliss: or it may be That our great latent love, leaping at once A thousand years in stature—like a stone Dropped to the central fires, and at a touch Loosed into vapour—should break up the terms Of separate Being, and as a swift rack Dissolving into heaven, we should go back To God. What incarnation doth obscure This attribute to safety and the health Of mortal apprehension, I accept As beautiful. Thus in all forms I see A mediator between God and man After the order of Melchisedek, A priest and king. Ruling them as a king Who have no God; but in the sacred sight Of a diviner faith as sovereign priest Being God with us. And thus the shows of earth Must needs survive this world. And thus produced From their adverse far points in time and space All extant opposites of love and fear Meet somewhere in the heavens. How of this truth The inward voice not knowing what it saith, Like a daft maid that hath a tale by rote, Age after age to immemorial man Unwearied nor to weary taketh up The world-old parable! In every tongue Speaking of the Sublime and Beautiful As of eternal twins, one dark, one fair, She leaning on her grand heroic brother As in a picture of some old Romaunt. Amy. Now I will crown thee. Balder. Wherefore? for we rule By right which any diadem on earth Nor gives nor takes. Here on this summer bank With neither gold nor tinsel, cap nor crown, Hocus nor title, puck nor premier, gown Nor robe of state, nor conjuring rod nor sceptre, Nor high nor low grimace of sovereignty, To lie here thus and find the earth and air Conscious; or mid their fealty and unclaimed Allegiance, free as the wild phantasy I follow, and as far from common men, Sole wandering like an unasserted god Displendoured undeclared but not unknown Thro' the sequestered places of my reign, Lone glens and glades, dells and enchanted streams, Silent hill sides, and holy mountain tops Untenanted, without the care of kings, Counsel or forethought or the toil of change, But pausing in mere power where'er I love, As the heart beats to people them at will From heaven!—my Amy, my throned queen, is this Royal? Amy. My dread lord, my dear husband, oh My teacher, friend, and father, all in one, My poet! Balder. Shall I do a miracle To please thee? This green realm of thine, this fair Sweet hill is lonely. Yon much-whispering stream Interprets no fond lovers; the old thorn Flowers for no village maid; the aged oak Shades not the hoary council of the dale; Yet ne'er was silent wilderness more apt For vocal habitation. Say wilt thou Be monarch of a Pastoral? Shall I Endow thy reign with subjects? Amy. Whence and how? Balder. This empty space above the turf is full Of living shapes, that shapes as yet are not, But possible to my strong-gazing eye Charming the air. Shall they come down to thee? There are necessities they must obey, Laws which these undimensioned wanderers Cry out to think of; thou hast heard them cry When we have sat together on the hill Upon a night of wind, for well they know That whoso of their viewless race shall pass Hapless across the field of poet's gaze Is bound. Amy. Thou seest him? Balder. I but feel the place Informed with presence, which my fixèd eye Constrains, till having broken the first law The essential motion self-perpetuate Of spirits, and unhesitating change, Time holds and all the straits of lower life Compel. Amy. Alas! Alas! Balder. I see them yield Ponderable, visible, subdued To mortal separation and the lot Of self and substance; flushed with earth, and sad With human beauty. Amy. Pity! Balder. My own Amy! Amy. Heed it not, Love. A shower out of yon Heaven Depeopled. Tell me. Balder. These existences, Won from the elements, and of a life Unknown, nor bounded by the days of ours, Cannot regain estate and order in The evermoving orbit and weird dance Of spirits whence they fell; which, while mine eye Detains them, desperate, is beyond the verge Ethereal and inexorable revolves Careering thro' the spheres. They, lost, return No more to airy being, but, having touched This globe, are thenceforth a terrestrial part; Assume our fate, and clothed upon as we Take human functions, but, by gross decess Of organs and the lower use of speech Cannot convey out of their charged souls The secrets of the past; and looking wrongs Untold, and incommunicable woes, And strange imprisoned joys for ever dumb, Go forth disguised in manhood to enrich A thankless world. Thou art wistful, my fair face. To thee I dream. Amy. Dream on! Balder. Nay, not for thee The populous fever of a poet's brain. Amy. To-day! To-day! To-day thou saidst to me I should be with thee in thy Paradise. Balder. Ay, but the three days in the heart of the earth? Dear happy child of sunshine, bless thy lot! The grave for me! For thee, who watchest in love, The garden of the sepulchre! Amy. I ask not To see thine awful visions, but the Prophet, Having come down the hill, interpreteth To feeble ears. And all the shaking signs And thunders of the mountain may be read In whispers. Therefore put me like a sense Behind thine eyes, and let me know the unknown Thicken to apprehension. Balder. Come and see. At sultry noon, when earth and heaven are still, And everywhere the full and helpless air O'er-fed with summer weighs upon the lids, Hast thou, long looking thro' the trance o' the time To the far misty distance, pale with heat, Beheld what more beheld became a cloud, Mountainous. But, at first, being less than seen, Did stir thee with no more than an unwilled Attention, subtle consciousness of great Approach, as yet beyond the shadowy verge Of knowledge; which, being grown, became a sense Of form behind the veil, and quickened still Through the swift dawn of vision to the day Of perfect sight. Ask me no more. Alas! Thine eyes are dim, my child, as if their rays Shone inward; look forth on me! This is thine, This sun-light world! Sport thee, Proserpina, In upper air, with native things that are! Enough for thee, O fairest, that the flowers Are fair; enough for them that, being born, Thou takest them to a breast more fair than they. Not thine to seek them in the earth, not thine The gendering caves and secrets where the spring Is gestate, and the summer yet to be Seethes dark. That underflow and subterrene Wherein the future heaves, and time to come, Like an embowelled earthquake yet unbelched, Disturbs our world, is mine. Amy. I cannot play; My heart is heavy with thy strange sad thoughts; The daisies look too happy; tell me, love, Some sorrowy history. Balder. I had a dream Last night; and it was sad enough to tell In a wan autumn night of falling stars. Thou wert most beautiful, but some dread fate Had touched thee, and dried up the hidden springs Of mortal being; like a famished plant Which fills its outer blossom from the core Of vital substance, the material life Within thee fed a phantom, and did pass Transmuted into beauty. I beheld. I clasped thee as the circling shore doth clasp The ebbing sea, or one that loves a ghost Straineth the vain air in his void embrace; As who should take the snow into his breast, I took thee pale and cold, and bared my sword, And glaring upon heaven and hell defied The hosts to touch thee; and above, below, There was such silence that the bitter laugh Within my empty heart rose out of me To the four corners of the world, and came Back like the mockery of exulting fiends! Thou wert exhaling, as a flower that spends Its soul in fragrance, and I seized the flower, And in the hollow of these passionate hands Strove in my mortal agony to shut The breath of life; oh how I cherished thee! I took thy trembling lamp, and in my robe Of love enwinding wrapt it from the wind, And made a tabernacle next my heart, And drew my soul out of the universe To watch it there, and see with deadlier truth The soft unflickering flame burn low and low. If Death had come to snatch thee from my arms, We had fought sore, and my wild grasp had proved Too strong even for him; but thy life died; And while I held thee, faded from my sight Like autumn in November. And I hugged —A desperate infidel—the limbs wherefrom The sap did sink, and even while I gazed The beauty fell. Calling on summer time, And giving names of gladness to the sparse Sick leaves that waited thin and flushed with death The last dread gust, but inly cursing God, And groaning in my soul for whomso lay In straits like mine. Then, in the wont of dreams, We were apart. As when some pair in lands Of buried thunder, walk forth side by side,— The unknown line of fate between—and earth Yawns, and each, moonstruck, on a separate shore Receding diverse, swift thro' sounding glooms, Knows but a lengthening distance and a black Abyss. Anon, I must return; what sprite Of eager evil rode upon the wind I wist not, and I knew not in my dream What dreadful need compelled me, nor what hands Innumerable, wheresoe'er I turned, Thrust me to thee; nor how thro' ill on ill, Battling and bruised, with the blind might of love I sought thee, nor why drawing near I saw One as expectant on the threshold stand, And one that kept the stair, and ready doors Oped as I came, and no man asked me whence, Till at the highest of the creaking house Lo the strewn rushes, and a hush of awe! And some who in the way would check my speed With words unheard; and, through the whispered press, Fevered and loud the dread and hissing breath Of mortal throes. Then cried I once as he Who takes his death, and sprang in, and fell down Wild on my knees beside thee, thee upon A low poor pallet by the hasty hand Of pity rudely curtained, and above The bed, thro' a mean lattice wide for air, The still and starry heaven that I saw not Shone. I rent back what hid thee, and beheld The tortured witness of thy dying face, Thy face, Which thou didst lift a little way to me, Silent, as conscious all the fearful tale Was writ there, and didst creep upon the arms That clasped thee, and being pillowed once again On the sole breast where thou couldst sleep in peace, The struggling life gave way before the wont Of rest. The painful limbs contract with pangs Relented, and with sudden weight and strange The fleshless form wan as a withered child Sank low. I felt; and a great wind of fear Struck down my heart, and deadly consciousness Of present evil met an outer sea Of flooding ill unknown, that surged me in From all the black horizon of the night, Drowning the world. I clenched thee where my heart Had broken, but thou stretched out madest no sign. No, tho' I bent above thy face, and all The throbbing functions of my desperate life Forsworn that thou didst live, stood still to see. Thy tongue is silent, and thy moveless breast— Thou hast gone down out of thine eyes, 'tis dust The tugging earth doth claim; the strife is o'er, And the stern universe too strong for me. Then I looked up, and a great inward cry, With the whole utterless strength of my mad soul, Arose. Whereat my inner frame convulsed Quaked and rocked Reason from her seat. No man Heard it, no, not the listening mourners round The chamber door, no, not thyself, tho' late Perception lingered in the ear of Death; But it filled Heaven, Amy, and the very stars Shook. Wherefore art thou putting back the wind As if it were an enemy? Alas Her flushed cheeks! and her hands upon her brow! My little Amy, I am near, fear not! We are awake! I touch thee with my hand! Thou hast not stirred—this is the very place Where we two sat, and knew that we were happy— It must be well with thee— Amy. My pain! my pain! Oh Husband, tell me it is evening; say The sun is set; say it is dark to thee; No, no, it comes! it comes! Husband! it comes! Like a great Vampyre blackening all the air Milking the day of light and sucking blood Out of the cheeks o' the World. My pain! my pain! [Pauses. Why dost look wretched, Husband? we are fools. No, there was nothing fair! 'twas all a dream! A flight of happy angels stopped to rest And stood upon the earth and hid it out! And now they rise again; hark how they rise! And all that seemed the surface of the world Goes up, and the foul earth is like a skull Scalped of its golden hair. Do not go up! Do not go up! I catch your skirts! my child, My little child, my little child,—me also— Me also—oh me also! Balder. The sun shines, This flower is the same colour; the bird sings; The clouds, the plain, the mountains, are not changed. SCENE XXV. The Study. Balder. solus. Balder. Who is He To whom this toilsome and producing earth Is as a cunning workman? what are they Whose lot is to enjoy as ours to lose? To what fair soil do they transplant our bliss And batten on the harvests that did sprout In blood of ours? Where be those planted fields Wherein the everlasting flowers are full That budded here;—whose tender germs, forsooth, In all the universe could find no place Warm as this bosom, and that would not root Save in a human heart? Where art thou, joy Of yesterday? In whatsoever world Whatever eyes inherit thee, what lips Would taste, what hands majestical possess, What breast contain, I interdict them all! Thou art mine! Do thou but bless them with thy least Enjoyment and I curse thee with my curse, A Father's! What! am I but dung, you Heavens, To grow your lush delights? Fool, fool, fool, fool! What is the flower but that on which it fed? The same continued atoms now reset In fashion to be glorious! Are we not As he who lay a hundred years ago In yon cross road, an elm-stake thro' his midst That burgeoned, and he went up thro' its veins Out of his prison into the bright air And laughed green leaves, and so his felon shame, His rotting shame, dark in the wormy earth, Sprang to a tree, that with ten thousand hands Greets the familiar winds, and first and last Salutes the sun? Ay, if I could go up! If all these whirling passions lifted me As whirlwinds lift the sea or the Simoom, Dust such as I! Oh Earth, that every year Conceivest and hast no power to bring forth, And year by year beginnest a psalm unsung, So as with thee is it with all of thine? As one who in a crowd of recreant men Begins a chant of freedom, and with brow Lift to the glowing sun, sings the first stave Triumphant, but no ring of bold refrain Surrounds him pausing for the wonted shout, And he looks down to pallid lips and eyes And all the silent treason, and, undone, Sinks on the sward, and hides his shamèd face; So ever looking to a golden time At each new year, impatient, thou criest out ‘There shall be!’—and art silent, casting dust Upon thine head. Oh, season ever new, Oh Spring that risest with us, sun by sun! Whither thine hurrying stream, where thy full tide, Thy neap excess, and overflow? What vale Far off in heaven, dost thou yearly flood With rainbow waters worthy of thy well, Ah fountain Arethuse? For never here Thy consummation; but what time we hail Thine outleap, and the pulsing channels sing, Somewhat beyond the verdurous verge drinks down The sudden waters, leaving yellow sands That autumn gathers, till the rock beneath Shines in the frost of winter. Where on earth Is the unknown meridian of that day Which to the Morn I met upon the east, Should be as man to babe? Doth the young moon Complete her promised light or multiply Her beauty by her days? Where is that rose Which he who gave its bud as hieroglyph Of budding love would own the equal sign Of love's full-flowered perfection? Of what blood And changeling race are we who fill this earth, Whereunto, hour by hour of every day And night of all its fruitful centuries, Children are born? Oh little child, girl-child, Last daughter of the old manorial house In the green village, thou who when the sun Is rising, and above, below, around, The dew-drops shine, as every bough and spray, Blade, leaf, small petal and least acrospire, Yea, the unbodied joyance of the air Had eyes, and smiled to see him, comest forth Into the morning as an element Of such etherial season duly sweet And sweetly due, while singing birds and bees Sound like the bubbling of that stream of day Whereby thou, tripping, givest song for song! Fair happy child, who goest at thy will Into the sunny midst as a white bird Into the crystal water that reflects Spotless a spotless image, pure in pure, And each unlessened still enhancing each,— The image whitens the white wave, the wave Adds the pure image to the floating snow;— Thou who art native to the good of all; For whom the unsullied fairness of the earth Guards not herself, nor deprecating hands Mystic arise out of the Beautiful To put thee from the beauty; who dost tread The daisies like a morning-wind and spill Dews from lithe buttercups that fill again With drops of pleasure; Oh thou unknown essence! So near the eyes, so distant from the heart, When dost thou take our nature, and become No more than we? Something within her looks A strange light through her lashes, and a joy Beyond our throb. It cannot be that this Abideth with her, for such bliss fulfilled Thro' all the coming seasons that must yet Accomplish woman, and increasing still Within the ampler temple, were a sight To breed rebellion in the universe, Burn every world with jealousy of her's, Summer this earth, and make the schooldame Nature Break thro' the ill-assumed severity Of her enforcèd aspect, with a cry Be all the mother, catch thee to her heart, Begin the golden ages, and in thee Restore mankind. Therefore, thou most fair child, Here thou hast no completion. In what hour Of what set night wilt thou give up this ghost, Exhaled as the last fragrance from a flower Unchanged in hue? Upon what destined morn Shall she come down a stranger to the board Where the same face and form shall take a place Not hers, and answer to familiar names That have no owner upon earth? Of them Who loved her is there one who shall be grave With an unconscious sorrow, knowing nought, But saying in himself, since such a day My heart is poorer? Is there one of all, Who thinking of a blissful time gone by That floats in on his day-dream, like sweet air From heaven, sun-bright and full of golden sounds Going and coming, at one happy voice Among the choir, starting, shall cry ‘Ah whose?’ And muse, and pass his hand across his brow Perplexed? Will they be sodden with a spell, Nor lift astonished eyes and hands to see Her shining crescent fill no fuller moon Than others? Nor so much as droop a lid Sighing, as when the pulsing heart of youth In mere abundance of young life's excess Beats an unknown approach that never comes, And we look up expecting, and look down With melancholy wisdom mildly sad, Smiling moralities? They will behold, And she shall grow and marry, breed and die, Even as her mother, and of many none Shall question her. Nevertheless at last Truth shall be justified. Of them who deck Her bier, or chant her thro' the pompous aisle, Or load the blazoned marble with her broad And gravid virtues, or in sable grief Swell the dark progress winding long and slow, Stately to honourable tombs, no hand Will write upon her coffin, ‘This is she Who played among the roses.’ Bitter heart, That art so sternly just, is she as far From the dear promise of her youth as thou From yesterday? Thou little phantom child, That merely passing thro' my trancèd soul, Hast left thy bright path, like the quivering track Of any fleeting star, what is that scheme Of life where this divine emotion finds Its equal place, and in the balanced whole Of still renewed proportion gives and takes Worthy consent? Where doth the Man complete The Poet? My chief impulse, and king-thought, Capital virtue, and consummate act, To what consorted system, yet unknown, Do these belong? Of what colossal frame Do I, like some rude hewer of the rock, Dishume the giant limb from my rent heart, And cannot guess its fellows? Mystery Of mysteries, like some great vapouring cloud Topping a cumulous Heaven of mysteries! [A long pause. Have we been all at fault? Are we the sons Of pilgrim sires who left their lovelier land, And do we call inhospitable climes By names they brought from home? Who shall declare? Which of us hath beheld what first was called ‘Order’? Since bad hath worse, who testifies That our serenest spectacle is not The prime Confusion? Where the human sight That ever looked on what they name in Heaven Beauty and Good? That which we fondly deem A happy universe of part with part Well-placed, and call it the full countenance And noblest front of things, I could believe To be upon the very skirts of God, Ay where they roll in tumult, and do flap In the wind of his going. This is Chaos, The Chaos whereof Poets sang, and sing Unconscious, never having seen or heard The harmony of Nature. This broad light Is darkness. I who speak of me and mine, Am but a living hand rent from its trunk In the black vortex, and amid the waste Of loaded disproportion and the foul Incongruous ferment of these elements Which might be worlds and men, touching at once The grains of all unlikeness, to and fro And up and down among the seething mass For ever lifted, grasping dust or flame, Each while I hold it Me, and each alike Put out for any other. Nought between A god's heart and the abominable extremes Of the worst brood of sin's most lcathsome world Impossible; nought certain but the pain Of finding all unsure. SCENE XXVI. The Study. Balder, solus. Through the door the voice of Amy. Amy. Surely the Lord is cruel but to me, And over bounteous to the race of men With mercy taken from my single lot. I am the dwarf of this great family, The favoured lips do drink the wine of life, And all the mingled lees fill up my fate. I am a place where music music meets, Putting it out; by how much joy is loud, I am the darker silence: all the lines Of sorrow cross above my wretched head. They are grown sour with sweetness, they are proud With pleasure, they care not to keep awake Even to be happy. Like a slave they bid Their bliss abide their time, and, like a slave, It fans their happy faces while they sleep. Ah Heaven! they sleep upon the flowery banks, And daylight flowers fill them with honey dreams, And pleasured smiles do light their languid lips. Ah Heaven! they stand amid the fruited trees, The golden-fruited trees, and every wind Daubs the ripe fruit upon their sated lips. Ah Heaven! they lie beside the living stream, And the superfluous stream o'er-wells his banks, And laps sweet waters to their happy lips. Where they do most enjoy my need is worst; The living cup they spill would save my life; The joy that wearies them would give me rest. I lie down in the night but cannot sleep; I keep vain vigil for my plighted bliss; I strain after the fruit I may not touch, And cannot reach the river tho' I die! SCENE XXVII. The Study. Balder, solus. Balder. And is this your device, you Heavens, When ye would have the music of our groans? The feeble lamentations of such pale Hereditary anguish as is born To pangs, and with the dread entail receives Inheritance of patience, the dull howl With which accustomed guilt receives his stripe In skin that thickens to the lash, each ill That carries with the wrong the slow redress Cries not for you; the lax and languid strings, Which Nature, careful of herself, doth loose To save her heart, cannot ring out such sounds As startle pleasure in your sated ears. They should be giants who make sport for gods! As we enjoy we suffer; legends tell That Eden is the utter wilderness, And the archangel's stature did become The measure of the fiend. Therefore, ye eld And sager gods, whose reeking Vulture once Did gorge your youthful vengeance on the rock In Crete, ye have grown wise, and no more Subtract the needful vitals that may throb A lustier pang, nor bleed the bull ye bait. Prometheus, keep thine heart! There is no trick Of Hell's contrivance that can plague thee so, Nor with as subtle mastery dispense Such dire infliction! Even the rude skill Of mortal cruelty hath learned to breed The gladiator to die hard; and they Who roast the human feast upon the shore Do supple him with kindness. What nice nerve Thrills the best pleasure twangs the sorest pain; The sense that faints with bliss will faint with woe: And he who dieth of a rose is damned Upon the thorn. Therefore, ye jubilant gods, Pamper the victim, fill his veins with joy, Build him of soft endurance, tender and strong As a flayed lion; finish each stern power To such an exquisite final that it ends A plumèd feeling; let delicatesse Weave his thin cuticle, and mesh him in; Be his most sensitive structure the extreme That meets and makes a whole with matchless strength— Even as the dread Apocalyptic beasts Were full of eyes. Thews of asbestos, ribs Of adamant, wound in so fine a thread Of life produced and ambient that he stands The heroic total of great opposites; Firm as a tower in any wind that blows, And trembling to a fragrance in the wind! Then on some human pyre whose dainty frame, As 'twere of frankincense and gums of Ind, His vital heat might warm into decay, Stretch him out, like the prophet on the dead, Limb upon fateful limb, and bind him down With the strong bonds of love, and rivet fast What everlasting anguish could not break! And fire the pile! and let your ready flames Wrap the incumbent health and scorch the strength They not consume! unguarded, unsuspect, Naked, and toiled, not as a hero falls, Nor in the wont of battle to receive His fate, and, by contending, half subdue; But bound and prone, expatiate with nice art To the invenient horror, oped and spread To the elective lust of keener flame, Lifting with incommunicable throes The inevitable torment, leaping high In vain and higher, every desperate strain Stirring new fires that burn a loftier bound That fans worse anguish and more wild despair For ever self-renewed, let him plunge, gods, And cheer Olympus! SCENE XXVIII. The Study. Balder. Enter Dr. Paul. Balder. Come? Thanks! Doctor. How? is she worse? Balder. I know not that. I sent for thee to hear yet once again The story of her sorrows. Doctor. The old errand! Balder. Not so. Thou hast been here in vain to seek A hope, but I send for thee now to find. Cure her! Doctor. Four solemn times within this month Have I told thee—— Balder. Paul, Paul, if I can bear My portion in this venture dost thou blench At thine? Is it so very much that thou Who canst sit careless of the stars, whose hand Shakes not already with adverse aspècts, Shouldst draw the horoscope once more for me And cast the fates anew? 'Tis the last time. I swear that what conjuncts for bliss or bale This sovereign hour determines I accept As doom. Therefore be patient. Strain thy skill! Draw it so well that were the burning sun Nought but an eyeball, and his sight to thine As he to thee, he could not magnify Thy deviation! Thine art is not mine, I am no Esculapian, but I know Less alteration than our sense can mete Would make the inexorable asymptote Close like fond lips. Get thee new instruments; No pinhole points and measure of mortal hairs, But compass that shall set his foot between Two feathers of a butterfly; a scale Scored with—— Doctor. Well, well, I'll see her, and do my best. But hope for nought; if even thine anxious gaze— And love is more than science,—can discern No better sign. Balder. Full many a time and oft I have sat still thro' all a summer day, And listened to its change as to a book Read by untiring lips. Thou wouldst have sworn The day was like a field of buttercups, Where every shining moment stood and smiled Beside his golden likeness; but not I! I know the hours, and call them by their names, As a shepherd his sheep. So in thy world The microcosm—— Doctor. Ah that word microcosm! A true word, my dear poet, a true word, For in six days God makes us, and, alas, If the seventh day wherein He rests be not The sabbath of the grave—— Balder. In that world, Paul, Which is thy study, as this other mine, I would look with thine eyes. Doctor. As you will, friend. Shall I go in? Balder. Ay, no, I had forgotten; She sleeps; I'll waken her. Doctor. Not hastily. Balder. With saddest music. [Goes to his harp by the open window. Do ye well to smile Superior, ye wise Heavens, because ye see I am a coward and fool Time to keep Fate at the door? All this and more I know No less than you. I am as wise as you If this be wisdom! I pray you cloud over. [Balder sings. In the hall the coffin waits, and the idle armourer stands, At his belt the coffin nails, and the hammer in his hands. The bed of state is hung with crape—the grand old bed where she was wed— And like an upright corpse she sitteth gazing dumbly at the bed. Hour by hour her serving men enter by the curtained door, And with steps of muffled woe pass breathless o'er the silent floor, And marshal mutely round, and look from each to each with eye-lids red, ‘Touch him not,’ she shrieked and cried, ‘he is but newly dead!’ ‘Oh, my own dear mistress,’ her ancient Nurse did say, ‘Seven long days and seven long nights you have watched him where he lay.’ ‘Seven long days and seven long nights,’ the hoary Steward said, ‘Seven long days and seven long nights,’ groaned the Warrener grey, ‘Seven,’ said the old Henchman, and bowed his aged head; ‘On your lives!’ she shrieked and cried, ‘he is but newly dead!’ Then a father Priest they sought, The priest that taught her all she knew, And they told him of her loss. ‘For she is mild and sweet of will, She loved him, and his words are peace, And he shall heal her ill.’ But her watch she did not cease. He blest her where she sat distraught, And showed her holy cross,— The cross she kissed from year to year— But she neither saw nor heard; And said he in her deaf ear All he had been wont to teach, All she had been fond to hear, Missalled prayer, and solemn speech, But she answered not a word. Only when he turned to speak with those who wept about the bed, ‘On your lives!’ she shrieked and cried, ‘he is but newly dead!’ Then how sadly he turned from her it were wonderful to tell, And he stood beside the death-bed as by one who slumbers well, And he leaned o'er him who lay there, and in cautious whisper low, ‘He is not dead, but sleepeth,’ said the Priest, and smoothed his brow. ‘Sleepeth?’ said she, looking up, and the sun rose in her face! ‘He must be better than I thought, for the sleep is very sound.’ ‘He is better,’ said the Priest, and called her maidens round. With them came that ancient dame who nursed her when a child; ‘Oh Nurse,’ she sighed, ‘oh Nurse,’ she cried, ‘oh Nurse!’ and then she smiled, And then she wept; with that they drew About her, as of old; Her dying eyes were sweet and blue, Her trembling touch was cold; But she said, ‘my maidens true No more weeping and well-away; Let them kill the feast. I would be happy in my soul. “He is better,” saith the Priest; He did but sleep the weary day, And will waken whole. Carry me to his dear side, And let the halls be trim; Whistly, whistly,’ said she, ‘I am wan with watching and wail, He must not wake to see me pale, Let me sleep with him. See you keep the tryst for me, I would rest till he awake And rise up like a bride. But whistly, whistly!’ said she. ‘Yet rejoice your Lord doth live; And for his dear sake Say Laus Domine.’ Silent they cast down their eyes, And every breast a sob did rive, She lifted her in wild surprise And they dared not disobey. ‘Laus Deo,’ said the Steward, hoary when her days were new, ‘Laus Deo,’ said the Warrener, whiter than the warren snows; ‘Laus Deo,’ the bald Henchman, who had nursed her on his knee. The old Nurse moved her lips in vain And she stood among the train Like a dead tree shaking dew. Then the Priest he softly stept Midway in the little band And he took the Lady's hand ‘Laus Deo!’ he said, aloud, ‘Laus Deo!’ they said again, Yet again, and yet again, Humbly crossed and lowly bowed, Till in wont and fear it rose To the Sabbath strain. But she neither turned her head Nor ‘whistly, whistly,’ said she. Her hands were folded as in grace, We laid her with her ancient race And all the village wept. Balder. I think she stirs. Go in! [The Doctor enters, remains, and reappears. Balder. Is there no change? Doctor. None that brings hope. Balder. That day seems scarcely past— That day of—— Doctor. My poor friend, when a ship strikes Long time on the mad surge she heaves and falls, And dips in winds and waves her leaning spars: Till, like a dying horse, with a last plunge She rises, reels, and over from the reef Goes mast-down in the deep. To see her rise Rises the landsman's cheer along the shore, And sinks with her. Balder. Enough. Paul, long ago I said a time would come to raise the veil On yonder scroll. Lift it to-day. I owe No less excuse for my relentless gripe, And thy still barren labour. Read out, Paul, For I would hear what I have lost; albeit To me those words are but a rosary, As unlike what they count as beads and prayers. Read slowly, and with a minute respect, As thou wouldst touch the enchanted elements On a magician's table—poor to look on, But things that, being moved, perplex the stars, And knot the threads of Nature. Do but fail Or falter, and by Heaven! I strike thee dead! Aye, marvel at me, for thou knowest not What I shall see. For thee, as men infer From maps and charts the living earth and heavens, Learn there what once was she—what is she now Thou knowest. Doctor (aside). He is pale,—pale to his lips, His eye is set. I'll humour him. [Doctor lifts the veil, and reads the scroll beneath. (Reads.) ‘In her, Nature's first thought was beauty; she conceived Her image sitting in her robe of white Thinking of spring, and, at the fancy moved, Smiling breathed softly, and did turn to make The firstling snowdrop of the stainless year. And, as the year arose, her fairer thought Took substance, and, consummate in her care, Grew with the growing year; for at her will Day after day past by, and passing dropt Its own memorial flower, the better sign Of all; and night by night, when shades are deep, And that mysterious sorrow is transact Unseen, and there is weeping in the air, She, understanding all, midst common dews, Caught the accepted tear that makes the hour So holy. Nor herself in greater deeds Forgot the less, thro' each surpassing mood In which with higher ecstasy she wrought Abundant summer, whatsoe'er confessed Her happier hand—elect and dedicate Encreased the secret store; and over all Frequent and fond with dainty change and wise— As meet perfection of each part admits Phœbus or Dian,—various balm of life She poured from golden and from silver vase Of sun and moon. But when the year was grown, (And sweet by warmer sweet to nuptial June The flowery adolescence slowly filled, Till in a passion of Roses all the time Flushed, and around the glowing Heavens made suit) And onward through the rank and buxom days, Tho' she ceased not to work and help the year Great with the burden of the honeyed past, And gave her good deliverance and great pomp Of harvest, and in royal glory robed Matron and mother, to her dearer hoard She added nought, nor what her love had hid Unclosed before the broad unclouded face And heated welfare of the lusty world. But when the destiny that haunts the proud Did tardy judgment, and the prosperous year, Struck in her young maternity, beheld First born and last lie low, and wrapping wild The early mists about her, on the ground Amid her prostrate hopes disconsolate Sat veiled: or standing forth with upstretched hands And strange appealing eyes, and wildered face Hectic with fate, looked like her spring-time self Transfigured on some martyr pile of woe Seen through the flame; then Nature knew her hour And at conjunction of the setting signs Opened her sacred Casket and took forth Well-pleased: and of the lone and latter rose, Pale autumn violets, and all hapless blooms Did make in mournful fragrance sadly sweet The mortal breath of beauty.’ Balder. Do not smile! This is no dream, for she came in September, And if she were o'erlaid with lily-leaves, And substantived by mere content of dews, Or limbed of flower-stalks and sweet pedicels, Or made of golden dust from thing of bees, Or caught of morning mist, or the unseen Material of an odour, her pure text Could seem no more remote from the corrupt And seething compound of our common flesh! Nay, as I oft have told thee—a whole year Ere she was born, her mother fed on fruits. Read on, Sir Science, for thou readest truth! Truth is a Janus, Paul, but either face Herself, therefore be reverent. Doctor reads. ‘I have seen The poet in his pride, who of his urns And lachrymals and crystal chalices Hath one, most treasured of his treasure-house, To which he goeth only with full heart And leaves the fulness there; ambrosial blood As of that cluster, weeping wine, wherein The blessing is, its vintage all unpressed Save by the purple and spontaneous touch Of too abundant being. Nature thus. The Poet Nature, singing to herself— Did make Her in sheer love, having delight Of all her work, and doing all for joy. And built her like a Temple wherein cost Is absolute, dark beam and hidden raft Shittim, each secret work and covert use Fragrant and golden, all the virgin walls Pure, and within without, prive and apert, From buried plinth to viewless pinnacle Enriched to God. Ah, was the very air Etherial round her, so that whoso breathed Revived to his best nature and grew bright For her sake, as a mote from dim to dim Sails the sunbeam?—What deity indwelt Her still small voice, which was her perfect selt Audible—that most happy voice, which when It rose to gladness made men rich and glad Unminished, and receiving but to spend Sweeter abundance with a lovelier will. Gayer for gaiety, but of the gay Still gayest, as bright sun o'er brightened fields Seems brighter, gaining from the light he gives. That voice which was to sorrow as its sigh, And by the side of wonted circumstance Went as the tinkle of Titania's feet, Ringing the hour of day on fairy bells Marriage or funeral. Nor less blessed when It fell into the bosom of the poor Like gold and silver. That dear voice which when She sang her life, the charmed listener hearing, Accepted for consummate loveliness Till she was mute, and, his divided soul Returning to the eyes, her silent beauty By the higher sense perceived, seemed insomuch Diviner music. Oft have I admired When the poor wayfarer on whom she looked Clothed in his tattered fortune did take rank A moment in her smile, and could not ask The alms his famine craved; the passing thief Had virtue in her service, and the clown Grace to be hers. The maimed who chanced to meet Her far-off beauty on the way, aside Drew into shadow till she passed, nor begged Aught that might turn the light of her fair face On the too conscious fault; and Lazarus Covered his sores with deeper sense of ill. Rude country-wives to whom in lane or mead Happened her sweet regards. with honoured face And thankful did obeisance going by As owning bounty and a duty known Unschooled; the village children at the door— Little two-year children—having gazed, Ran to her as she passed and caught her skirt And looking up laughed strange intelligence, Abashed and pleased, in the mere act repaid, And wiser than the three-score-years-and-ten That chid the holy freedom, being purblind. For they who saw her were as one who knows A mystic sign and smiles with consciousness. There is a soul unto the grosser sense Of spoken language, an unuttered thought Virgin and peerless, which no man hath said Nor hath the hope to hear upon the earth, Tho' it be dear as the unbodied dream Of early love, familiar as the wife Upon his breast, albeit untouched as maids In Paradise. In every human speech No speaker but hath with him, undeclared, This angel; and doth bear about a thing Too lovely for his lips, beloved unnamed. As every heart upon its secret, so The world did look on her! Where'er she went Nature, in dale or hill, in cot or grove, Owned her, and in the shepherd or the lamb Confest no less. The Lamb which to her knee Came fearless, unsuspicious of the gray Grim guardian of the fold who harmed her not Nor challenged her just right what-time she took The lambkin willing, to her purer breast. Thus or in haunts beloved or foreign fields Her equal way was all among her own, Unquestioned still, nor anywhere or new Or strange. We had a wonted bower, secluse, Of honeysuckle wild in mossy dell Facing the noon, and sheltered from the north By denser shade; flowery it was and deep, And caught the flowing light as chaliced leaves The sunset. In the inner sanctities Shy birds did nest, and all the summer through, Entering, with tumult of distress I shook The troubled verdure, but she came at will And sat there; and the birds went in and out As tho' she were so merely beautiful That nought betrayed her limits and she mixed She, undistinguished—with the love-lit air The fragrance and the summer joy that lived In that green bower, So lovely in her rest More lovely her awakened beauty played The smiling pastime of her innocent life Gracious and holy, wherein fairest thought And fond performance thro' melodious hours Rhymed like a gentle ballad. All she did Expressed her. The mild lore and simple arts She knew and loved might exercise unblamed Chaste Flora's self or what pure essence warms The happy difference of a morn of May. Song and answering lute, and mute delight Of pencilled touch, and nice dexterity Of bending Eve in gardened Paradise Were hers; she had a faërie forestrie Of birds, and bees, and summer flies; she knew Sweet mysteries of sunrise and sunset, Of seasons, moons, and clouds. But chief in joy Her skill was among flowers, which in her hand Took better hues, and fell under her looks Into an ordered beauty as before Their queen; and when they crowned her, unaware The butterfly did court the rose as still Upon the blushing tree. Yet more I loved An art which of all others seemed the voice And argument; rare art, at better close Of chosen day, worn like a jewel rare To beautify the beauteous, and make bright The twilight of some sacred festival Of love and peace. Her happy memory Was many poesies, and when serene Beneath the favouring shades and the first star, She audibly remembered, they who heard Believed the Muse no fable. As that star Unsullied from the skies, out of the shrine Of her dear beauty beautifully came The beautiful, untinged by any taint Of mortal dwelling, neither flushed nor pale, Pure in the naked loveliness of Heaven. Such and so graced was she. But not alone, Ah purest! not alone in thy first reign Of placid pastures and beseeming woods Palatial, where the conscious waterfalls That leaped in bliss beside thee did no more Than all that gave thee thro' the loyal year Duteous attendance, not alone by glen Or mountain wert thou absolute! nor he Who passed thee, tutelar, amid the wilds Of thine accustomed sanctuary alone Thy worshipper! Hers was no vulgar glare Startling the dazzled crowd to blink and gaze, Nor came she glorious as a summer noon, Melting all looks to pleasure and all limbs Relaxing as with heat, and thro' the sense Sending soft breath of love and southern joy. The happy paths she blessed led not to courts Or cities. Loved and loving she would live No more accompanied than by what train Is love's, and in the love-feast of her days Served while she sat or sat whileas she served! To know where winding from the ancient tree By the gray style thro' copse and daisied dell, In every mood of immemorial mind The simple village went a thousand years; Or o'er the brook upon the stepping-stones To follow unperplexed thro' bosky maze, The feet of sorrow to her shyest lair; Or at the ruined cot, and down the dim Deserted path, to watch under the dust The unwonted grass rise slowly up and lift The memory of the dead from off the earth; Or round the wildered garden to convince The graceless moss of greed; Or from lone lane At summer eve to trace some ancient track A-field and learn what need or joy of life Saw viewless landmarks in the devious way, Her daily pleasaunce. But where men are met, If unpropitious hap or lot unsought Awhile constrained her, fate that did the wrong, Jealous, allowed no other; as a King Seizing his bride, rapt from her native bowers Circassian, in the amorous crime completes His cruelty and makes the captive queen. Not otherwise, and looking like a flower Dropt in the city street—some blossom fair That grew dew-nursed and lone green miles away— Into the heedless crowd that knew her not She came uncrowned, and they wist not she came; Till simply sitting in the parlous midst Her presence like a silent virtue spread About her. For a little while she sat Unhonoured, but a consciousness disturbed The spot, and as a holy influence Did touch the unwilling people into awe, Whom gentle observance and sweet respect Disposed, till who partook her magic ring Still or discursive, sole or sociable, Each in his several function did denote Her place. Nor customary in mere use Perfunctory, and rite of cap or knee, The general homage; but of some inborn Content and central sanction in the soul, Inmost and earlier than where creeds begin Or doubts divide. Men turned and asked not why, Nor, seeing, marvelled that they turned; but apt Took reverent distance: nor, decorous, ceased The fealty of regard. With decent eyes And with no louder sign nor needless bruit Of the unuttered reason than what-time On wintry day they face by mute consent The seldom sun. Thus she who came unknown Into the stranger crowd with modest step And eyes that rather would be ruled than rule, Having no need of praise, nor hope of fame, Nor conscience of dominion, did subdue Its chaos to her nature, being divine. And merely present could no less than stir The dull and gresser essence to revolve About her, as by instinct and hid force Of that well-ordered universe whereof Its matter was a part. Herself informed The jarring elements, till, as her sway No utter sign enforced, nor shows of power, Nor but a golden sweet necessity Sovereign, unseen, the subject heart gave like Confession. Not as they confess a queen With sudden shout, but as two friends regard A rising star, and speak not of it while It fills their gaze. The loud debate grew low, What was unseemly chastened, and the fear Of Beauty waking her moralities Sent thro' adjusted limbs the long-forgot Ambition to be fair. Nor sex, nor rank, Nor age, nor changed condition, did absolve Her rule, which whatsoever was remote From sin the more saluted. Everywhere Babes smiled on her, and women on her face Did look as women look in happy love. So the world blessed her; and another world Like spheres of cloud that interpenetrate Till each is either, met and mixed with this. And as the angel Earth that bears her heaven About her so that whereso'er in space Her footstep stayeth we look up and say That Heaven is there—She moved and made all times And seasons equal; trode the mortal life Immortally, and with her human tears Bedewed the everlasting, till the Past And Future lapsed into a golden Now For ever best. She was much like the moon Seen in the day time, that by day receives Like joy with us, but when our night is dark, Lit by the changeless sun we cannot see, Shineth no less. And she was like the moon, Because the beams that brightened her passed o'er Our dark heads, and we knew them not for light Till they came back from hers; and she was like The moon, that whatsoe'er appeared her wane Or crescent was no loss or gain in her But in the changed beholder. I, who saw Her constant countenance, and had its orb Still full on me with whom she rose and set, Knew she had no lunation. In herself The elements of holiness were merged In white completion, and all graces did The part of each. To man or Deity Her sinless life had nought whereof to give Of worse or better, for she was to God As a smile to a face. Ah God of Beauty! Where in this lifeless picture my poor hand Hath done her wrong, forgive; she was Thy smile, How could I paint her? That I dared essay Her image and am innocent, I plead Resistless intuition, which believes Where knowledge fails and, powerless to define Or to confound, still calls the face and smile Not one, but twain, and contradicts the sense Material, which, beholding her, beholds Essence not Effluence, nor Thine but Thee.’ Doctor. Aye—veil it over! Balder. Once again I say Cure her! Doctor. And, good friend, hear me once for all. I have brought to your wife's lamented case What skill I own,—and twenty years of cure Have taught me something—but for much esteem Of her and you, I made her malady The subject of my college. I stand here A simple country surgeon, but where'er Men worship Science, some one of her Priests Calls me his friend; whatever oracles, As yet unbruited, murmur from the cell, I learn from these. Therefore in my poor words You hear a verdict sworn to by the prime Of Europe. Balder. There is no most rare device Occult, or cunning of the eye or hand, Or mastery of subtle elements, Beyond thee? Doctor. No. Balder. Whatever lesson new These latter days have spelled in the unread And polyglot palimpsest of this body Is thine already? Thou hast it within By rote? Doctor. Yes. Balder. Let us speak of other things. The sun must be near setting—shall we watch him From the old rampart of my Ruin? Follow. Doctor. With all my heart! [They ascend to the ramparts. Doctor. (emerging). Truly the light is sweet! That winding stair—two hundred steps and more—— My head swims. Balder. 'Tis a fearful height. My Dog, Whose stature thou didst praise, seen hence appears Notably less. His kennel which thou knowest Befits a mastiff of the English breed, Might house a cur. We have a legend here. A maniac dwelt in this old tower and hence Throwing his keeper, hid the battered corse In yonder tarn. His ghost preserves my fish. A dalesman would as soon drop line in hell As in the murder-pool. Doctor. I shudder. Balder. Sounds The old tale credible? How say thy craft? Is the leap death? Doctor. Death to a hundred lives! His mother would not know the face that reached Yon stones from these. Balder. Thou art a feeble man, I am no giant, but am thrice thy match; Cure her! Doctor. Thou hast mine answer. Balder. And thou mine. Cure her. Doctor. I cannot. Balder. In mine art I know Passion and terrible occasion make Men poets, poets gods. Thine may have like Apotheosis. Cure her! Doctor. Hands off! see The precipice we stand on—— Balder. Ah! ah! ah! Cure her! Doctor. Thou jestest with me! Balder. By the Heavens No! Doctor. Stand back! Balder. Cure her! Doctor. Free me! Mercy! Help! We have been friends, thou wilt not murder me? Balder. We have been lovers, but I sent a shaft Into her heart. If thou canst draw it forth Well; but if not—— Doctor. Nay, I can fight for life! Madman! Hold! Murderer! Mercy! Mercy! Balder. Cure her! Doctor. Spare me! my wife! my children! Balder. Cure her! Doctor. Christ! God! oh God! Balder. Cure her! Doctor. I will! Balder (releasing him). Thou wilt not! Liar! Begone! Haste! Lest in my despair Thou 'scape not twice. SCENE XXIX. The Study. Balder, solus. Balder. I will sit down And let the stars roll on. Such pitiless signs Cannot for universal health maintain An hour's ascendant. If the heavens could halt I might despair, but the worst orb that moves Betters my fate. SCENE XXX. The Study. Balder sits by the open window. Balder. Thou dull tree, What and hast thou gained nothing? Not a twig, A leaf, a flower, a colour? By my count Thou shouldst have leafed and summered, seared and died Since I sat down beside thee. Nay, if I Had lifted up this head that thou dost shade, To see thee branchless, thy dismantled trunk Worm-wemmed in hollow age—I could have said ‘Why this is well, yes, thou and I, old friend, Have filled our days.’ [Turns to papers on the table. How goes the human year? The first of a new month! I take my times And seasons as a traveller in the night Kneels by the stone beside the unknown way, And gropes with patient finger the moss-grown And mouldering miles; while at his trembling touch Out of the ignorant strange dark comes forth The old remembered name, and or the light Of home, or the intolerable flash That sends him scorched and moaning. I remember A year ago to-day I left my fields To dwell in cities. How that black sad time Frowns back to this. The first dark day it rained, An inky rain blackening the civic shrubs And birds apostate whom my heart knew not. Between the door-sills flowed the narrow street, Betwixt the house-tops crept as foul a mirk, Soaking and cheerless, as if overhead Another street, inverted in the air, Let down an answering ooze; and I beheld Nor felt it was not well; till suddenly Upon the morrow eve the sun shone in, The country sun—and I rose up in haste And clasped my hands and cried ‘not here, not here For pity!’ as she cries whom secret shame Hath soiled, and puts away with passionate tears The old familiar kisses. The third day I went; but in those three days saw strange sights And many, which men told me that the eyes Which dwell there daily saw and did not weep. I saw the palaces of thronèd Law Where Law supreme in red and ermine sits, And, like the fool's cap on the telescope With his pert sheepskin shuts out sun and stars. I saw the man-fruit on the gallows-tree, It hung up like a fruit and like a fruit Shook in the wind, like a fruit was plucked down And the dark wintry branch stood bare. That day I saw a withered woman in her rags Watch by a door and snatch what lay within And feed her young. I saw a stout arm seize And hale her to a dungeon. The same hour I saw a young man in the flush of youth Broad in the sunshine of the city street, Meet a poor soul that once had been a maid; She knew that she was desolate, and he Spat in her ruined face because he might. I did not hear that he was hanged or chained. And so the world went on. But was it thus That in the Eye of Him who made the world While it was yet unmade the thing to be Did golden revolution, and appeared So lovely that He made it? If this earth Be but a Lazary, a madman's cell, A gaol, a charnel, wherefore was it reared So like a temple? Hath a den of thieves The gates called ‘Beautiful?’ Or are these hills, Whereon the consecrated Noon doth set The golden candlestick, and robèd Eve Shall light her late burnt-offering in the west, The changers' tables? Yet ah, who shall say ‘My Father's House,’ and by that right divine Dispose unblamed within? Whose sinless cords Shall cleanse it? What sufficient touch of faith Removing the great mountain that on high Holds back the imminent Hyaline, unsluice The second deluge? Where is he on earth, At whose great word I, who sit here to-day In her fair porch and royal gate of all One sore from head to heel, should rise and walk? And at what word that did not make me whole, Would I, for all the beauty of my place, Lift from the chaste chryselephantine floors One leprous limb? Yet who shall dare to cast A stone upon my sin, or with white hands Hale me beyond the portals? Drugs there be For every ill, and in their books the wise Apportion each to each; but who shall bring The living instance to the written saw? For every sickness of a human soul There may be balm in Gilead, but what eye Infallible shall find, what lip shall name My hid disease? To hell, ye empirics! And burn your statutes. Who shall legislate For the unseen performance of the heart? Or in the balance of his justice weigh The imponderable soul? By what gross word Of this her rude interpreter assess Her necessary silence? By what work Of menial senses judge her viewless hand, Her secret enterprise, her unobeyed Commandment; good in service turned to ill, Or ill so carried that it looked like good? What profiteth to draw your lines about A haunted house, or hem a ghost with trench And scarped epaulment? Canst thou chain the wind, Or put material fetters upon thought That bloweth where it listeth? Or debar The Soul from her delight? Who shall keep watch O'er the forbidden treasure, and attach Her going out and coming in? Show me The etherial captive naked in the sun, Bound at thy chariot wheels; bend at thy will Her free immortal limbs; pass, under seal, The charter of her rights, repeal this sin, Enact yon virtue, with a single groat Endow a starved remembrance, confiscate That in the past that I could tell thee of, And I will hear! Aye, send thy Sheriff, King, Into this bosom; apprehend this pang; Touch Me or these; arrest that bloody knife Wherewith I quiver; standing by my side Thrust in thine arm if thou art man, oh King! And stay these burning hands that day and night Are felon here! ‘King!’ Aye, that word crowns all! Where is our King? If there be some man built For each due office, and no man alive But in his place is matchless, where is he The head and master workman to dispose Tasks fit for all, and each to his fit task? For we are the disordered elements Of that tremendous engine which, compact, Should put a soul into this floating earth And drive her thro' the stars; make headlong way Dead in the wind of chance and all the tides Of fortune, laugh to scorn the storms of fate, Make white the deeps of chaos, and, at last, Cast her eternal anchor on the shore Of far applauding Heaven. But now unplaced, Constrict in bonds inordinate, or ties With hopeless lesion lax, in unexplained Society consorted to no end, Or from connexion apt or impotent Absolved and separate, dissolute, poured down In orderly disorder, quick or dead, Inert or vital, as the several part Motive or to be moved fulfills in vain Its own peculiar, fruitful now no more In general welfare and the good of all— We lie on heap, and each constituent finds Disastrous sloth or detrimental use; Dead in himself, or motionless as dead Oppressed beneath his fellows, or, uplift By wilful hand of hapless circumstance And so applied, in sad unequal case With unadapted organs ill performs Unsuited functions, fine with gross, and gross With fine. If One Infallible might speak And make these dry bones live! If any sign Could daily end this dire perplexity! We are the sons of anguish; we are born In labour and to labour; toil and pain Begin us, and shall end us. It is well. We are your slaves, work your high pleasure on us! Aye, load us till we crack, and our great wills Shall not be less than yours! None of these things Move us, for none of these things our proud hearts Arraign or shall arraign you, O ye gods! We are no rebels; this our loud demand Is not the ill blooded and morose complaint Of secret hate, or the promulgèd war Of overt treason, but a claim of right Preferred by lips still loyal in the phrase Of sweet subjection, the ensheathed appeal Of armed allegiance, the obtesting cry Of a forgotten people. Ye are gods, And we are men; so let it be. But ye Speak not our language nor we yours. If one Might rede aright to us your dark decrees, Whereof we pay infraction with the blood Of ignorance! If any daily voice, Were it no larger than this grasshopper's, In our own tongue could only say to us ‘Well done, well done, thy feet are in the way, This path beyond the darkness is the same; Thou hast not walked in dreams, nor in thy sleep Hath any passing mischief carried thee Far from the roads of morning! Nought is lost. That which thou sawest thou sawest, what thine ear Heard hath been spoken; thou art not yet false; This that thou callest good is good: go on, It shall be well with thee in all the worlds!’ But now am I as one blindfold and bound, Who, 'mid a sounding pageant, pressed and thronged With tramp of steeds and shout of changed event, Roar of innumerable multitude, And banners' proud advance and clang of horns Dying the gaudy air with hot acclaim, And flux and reflux of resistless tide, Doth take from side to side with helpless face Blind buffet of the surging turbulence And strong bewilderment, and feels his blood Down-dropping, and his wounds; but heedeth more The wonder of his heart, and moans and moans, ‘Alas that I could see!’ ‘I?’ who am I? Whence? How? Why? Whither? This old world that stands Before me day and night, what? wherefore? Down Thou pompous and intolerable ruin! I weary of thee! Thou art out of knowledge; Thy centuries untold; thy Builders where? Thy fashion lost; thy substance without name; The very need that thou didst satisfy Forgot. Why cumberest thou the fields of air, Incantada? The cardinal intent, The regnant virtue, final element, And master good, the better truth of all, Which on its ordered arms upbears these shows As leaves upon a tree; that which beheld Infers the necessary universe As substance shadow; and, being known indeed, Is the old fruit which, eaten, maketh gods, Who shall discover and therein first find Himself and all his race? There is some truth Unknown, whose very footsteps are more bright Than any visible face, and on whose track Unlooked for the glad heart in loud surprise Doth open like a hound. Sometimes I pass Plain after plain of many-trodden life, And never cross it; and anon when Hope Grown careless hath unleashed his pursuivants And all the long invariable way Stretches in lifeless waste—my dazzled eyes And the long trail of light! This panting heart Racing pursuit where as she runs the run Gives strength to run and warm and warmer air Leads on the nose of capture, mad to win O'ertakes the brightening leagues; then all at fault Stands fixed and bays the sky. As one should trace An angel to the hill wherefrom he rose To Heaven, and on whose top the vacant steps In march progressive with no backward print A-sudden cease. Sometimes, being swift, I meet His falling mantle torn off in the wind Of great ascent, whereof the attalic pomp Between mine eyes and him perchance conceals The bare celestial. Whose still happier speed Shall look up to him while the blinding toy In far perspective is but as a plume Dropped from the eagle? Whose talarian feet Shall stand unshod before him while he spreads His pinions? Who shall take him by the hand? I have tried all Philosophies; I know The height and depth of science; I have dug The embalmèd Truth of Karnak and have sailed Tigris and Ganges to the sacred source Of eastern wisdom; I have lived a life Of noble means to noble ends; and here I turn to the four winds, and say ‘In vain, In vain, in vain, in vain!’ The end is come. I stand upon the Babel I have built, I have surpassed the mountains, the great globe Lies inexhaustible below, my days Are still before me; these unconquered limbs Invulnerable hang by my strong side Brawny with toil; but I have worked my last. I cannot lift these arms. I have attained The furthest realm aërial where the air Is gross enough to breathe, and Nature's self Refuses to o'erbuild the vital bound And lift me into death. I lay me down Upon my life-long work the wretchedest man That ever fought and lost. What I have done, No more being done, is vain, and more being done Unsouls the bulk that went before, and rears A pyramid to hold into the sun The offence of my mortality. My pride Hath climbed till I can hardly see the earth Beneath me, and from that last possible height Looks up with fainting eyeballs to behold A heaven no whit more near. Is there no help? [A pause. O Thou Invisible, whoe'er thou art, Who with sufficient presence and plenary touch Extensive, whether in the unfathomed east And west or in the terrible extremes Beyond the Pole Star and the Southern Cross They mark the immeasurable round of heaven, At once distendest with co-equal life The order'd spheres; either withdraw thyself From the serene and golden harmony Of that inspirèd matter overhead Which circleth irrespective day and night In heedless welfare; either give up realms That once were Chaos to the mortal shock Of the last anarchy; let maddened day Scorch hope to ashes, and the flaming night Affright us till the yell of our despair Rise in the howling regions; be exhaled O Power, let me behold the sudden stars Meet in omnipotent havoc that results To utter space and ebbs and flows and ebbs In vast conflux and infinite recoil Systole and diastole, till lo! A universe that like our mortal lot Panteth to death, and in the hopeless sight We leap to final flames; or now at last Unveil Thyself and save us! Come forth strong To judgment! Justify the shows of things, And heal her and this world! SCENE XXXI. The Study. Balder at his table in act to write. Through the door the voice of Amy. As she sings he rises and rushes from the room. Amy. That I might die and be at rest, O God! That I might die and sleep the sleep of peace! That I might die and know the balm of death Cool thro' my limbs and all my silenced heart! O God, that I might die! that I might die! Death, Death, thou wilt not take me? should I bring Disquiet to thy kingdom? Yesterday Was pain, and had a yesterday of pain Whereto it was to-morrow; and pain, pain This dark to-day, to-morrow's yesterday And yesterday's to-morrow; then why not To-morrow? and why less because with thee? I know the wanderer in the desert heat When the well faileth and the cruise is spent Sees with his eyes his great necessity And hears the murmur of his strong desire And speeds—to drearer wastes and deadlier sand. If I am he, O Death, and thou my Thought Hast lain so long before me cool and sweet And art the mirage of a wretched heart! In what fair shape hast thou beguiled me not? O Death in all this vision of the world What have I seen, Betrayer, if not thee? Sometimes I climb, and thou upon the height My mother waiting for her weary child With outstretched circling arms and bosom bare! Or I am falling in a draw-well deep Red round with infinite depth of hateful eyes And night-mare mocking faces, and below Thou liest like a smile of love and peace. Sometimes I am a maimèd captive, bound To the swift chariot of the pitiless sun, And thou art night that dost unloose my chain! Or I a pilgrim at the gate of heaven, Torn with the thorniest way, and thou O Death A virgin angel met upon the verge, And pitiful thou dost divesture me And there of all my tattered earthly weeds Spreadest a bed where I may sleep my last Nor enter weary on the happy land. Or I a floating vapour, white and wan, Casting a shade and shedding doleful dews, And thou a sunshine from a sun unseen Dost touch me, passing, to a rarer change. I float and sadden not the summer air Nor shed a doleful dew nor cast a shade. Or I am sailing on an ocean wild And o'er the bark I bend me, fain to die, And hopeless look into the sea; and eyes Shine up like drownèd jewels from the depths, And somewhat riseth in the deep to me, And in the waters a familiar face And a hand waving to the mermaid-cells. Touch me, O Death! This moment let me sleep! I can do all, O Death, but doubt in thee. Touch me, O Death, least I be wild with fear! Aye, now thou art again as thou hast been. Stay with me; lay thine hand upon my brow, Cool, cool; bend o'er me; let thy shadowy hair Shut out the distance from my aching eyes. Stand between me and the unsetting sun; Console the frailty of my feeble limbs And task me with a burden I can bear! I fling me on the shore; I cannot try The ocean of interminable life. Hush me, and sing me to a better mind. A little rest, a little rest, O Death, Ere the great labour of the world to come! SCENE XXXII. The Study. Balder sits at the table, turning the leaves of a MS. Page after page! from earliest light of dawn To the first evening star, and still in vain! The eye indeed perceives, but the shut soul Hath no reception. As in a great house Upon a day of mourning when the lord Pines in his closet, and the eager crowds Fill the contentious vestibule and keep Jostling attendance, what the sense admits Stands in the outer precincts of my head But gains not me. Nay, thro' dull walls I hear The intolerable murmur, and go back To darker depths. If these ears would forget! These eyes contain their uses in the straits Of function, and the strong impediment Of wood and stone! A little rest! An hour's Oblivion! Six days have I sat as now, In the same chamber, at the well-known place, In the same chair, before the wonted table, With the same pen dipped in the self-same horn, The altar laid as when the god came down, And every duteous rite of sacrifice But not the fire from heaven! You pitying gods, I am content to suffer; as ye will Work all your pleasure on me; but I pray, Having so far advanced my monument, Let me not die unhonoured. I ask not Space for the dearest business of life; But if we are to die unloose these limbs A little season, grant but what reprieve May place the final stone which shall surmount Our ashes, and these votive hands shall shed The blood ye long to taste! these mindful arms Embrace your vengeance! [Pauses. If ye ever heard, Save what is left of me! Ye will lose nought; I shall die nobler game. Hack me to earth By this slow baiting and the inglorious wounds Will mortify, and I that might have roared At bay upon your foremost, and, upreared Like a wild desperate Lion, have made sport For your divinest prowess, may turn tail And trail my hinder death along the ground Of craven faint retreat. Now! now! ye swift And interposing powers! the cry! the cry! [Amy is heard thro' the door. Amy. Blind, blind I stand and dare not stir for fear. Blind, blind I turn my face up to the sky. I have no hope to hide my bruisèd face Which evermore a strong hand in the air Smites with a burning rod and will not rest. SCENE XXXIII. The Study. Balder solus. Through the half-open door is heard the voice of Amy. [He rises and shuts the door Balder. In vain! There is but one wall upon earth Thou canst not pass: One door that being closed Is closed on thee; one refuge where even thou Art silent. If I hide myself in deeps Of lonely woods the murmuring trees take up Thine argument; if in the further wilds Of the waste hills, my heart is full of tongues And each to either in untiring round They tell thy story. She of old who fled Before the humming fly, and coursed the world Uncomforted, wild with the ceaseless sound Susurrent, was in better case than I Who have no hope of change, and with swift flight Should bear as swift a woe. I am impaled Here where I stand; my hurt, alas, not mortal, But touching at the very hinge and crank The springs of action and the palsied limbs Of staring struck desire. 'Tis hard, 'tis hard, To lie upon this earthly battle-field Among the sick and helpless in the rear And see the strife and the eternal prize Borne off by other hands, and hear the trump And all the victory which thou canst not share. But nature smooths the pillow that she spreads, The fevered hand is weary of the sword, The fallen warrior's eye hath lost its fire, His voice its thunder; his unstanchèd wound Hath bled ambition, and the sick man's pap Is not the bait of war. Ask what he feels Who with the pulse of promise and the limbs Of young performance and the lusts of youth Swelling and flushing on unconquered brows And favouring heavens above him and great signs In the consenting earth, mounts to his dear And proud intent, and hears already rise The shout of conquest, and, in grasp of all, Yea in the triumph of his measured strength— That leans over accomplishment to close With forward acquisition,—stops stone still, Spell-bound. And spell-bound, locked and motionless, With unseen prowess of inglorious war Hid in his silent body, strives with fate And spends his might within. (As one doth grind The set teeth down, and in his clenchèd palm Break his own bones, and cram his chargèd veins To bursting, string each muscle till it crack, Hold but a little breath with will enough To bind the winds of Heaven, and stay a hand With force that could arrest the headlong world And no man knows it.) He thro' starting eyes Sees all that should be his, and, like a fierce And hungry mastiff held back by a chain In the full scent and sight of his near prey, And strong to seize, that gasps and claws the ground And wears his bloody talons to the bone With unrelaxed endeavour, he beholds While the auspicious light goes down the sky And high in Heaven the awful omens change, And 'mid the murmurs of impatient earth He stands for ever straining to the breach Of still denied occasion. My keen ears Heard each careering star that rounds the sky, And knew them by their sounds. But now to list In vain, nor know if the great march of worlds Stand still! When life was sweet I would have died That men might happier live; when hard existence Toiled thro' its sweats of blood, I would have lived That men might nobler die; but now alike To live unfruitful and to die unblest! Heavens! that the creak of passing wain should hide The voice that drowns the rolling universe! That thou, despite of me, canst fill the world, And no more pressure of this hand than holds A bundle of unbruised buttercups Could still thee! That the bannered host of man Under my leading starts on its white way Down the rejoicing ages, and thou, Amy, Canst take the car of glory by the wheel And stop it; with a single touch arrest That wondrous wingèd horse whereon I rode, And throw mankind in me. SCENE XXXIV. A Field near the Tower. Balder solus. Oh God! to how great office was I born, To how proud exaltation came I in Unquestioned as one comes unto his own. For nor was it forbidden me to hold The pen of sovereign Nature when she bent To send her message to the sons of men, Nor,—being her Scribe, and finding in her eyes Maternal favour—undismissed to sit At her dread feet, while her much-musing Voice Like muffled thunders of a storm unburst Did murmur to her heart. Nor she disdained In royal leisure to remember me; Keeping her eyes upon the wilderness In mercy, and dividing to my sense The o'er-great burden of her gaze and speech. And I being asked made answer, having grace To speak. Nor unto me was it denied To hear responsive secrets from her lips. Nor to behold her undestroyed what time She held her court and all the subject Powers Of the obedient Universe appeared To hear her bidding, and to each her hand Dispensed his several task. Nor unto me Wholly inhibited, nor by these orbs In this dark day forgot, the blinding sight Of that all incommunicable hour And ecstasy when she who wears the stars Sitting alone amid Infinitude Nor seeing from her all-surveying throne Sovereign or peer, deth veil her awful head And own a Master. Naked from the womb She took me, and she clothed me round about, Nor have I other garment than the robe She gave; wherefore I, driven forth and disowned, Displaced, dishonoured, cut off once for all, Outcast and unauthentic, by my weeds Still seem her servant. All that seek her grace Salute me, and my hands are full of bribes. They whom she loves are free to me in speech No longer mine, and uncommanded slaves Contend to do me service. Hereabout I am confessor to a thousand flowers And wheresoe'er I stand some one begins Her unsought confidence: each several Oak Standing above me, hoarse with waving arms, Makes me companion of his difficult strength As Cromwell spake to Milton. From what state Am I cast down! Where shall I rest who lay In the hid core of silence and did sleep Cradled in central calm? In what world find A dwelling? Under what less potentate A new allegiance? Beneath what dark Heavens A worship? From what spot of lower spheres A Universe? In Heaven, Hell, Earth, or Air, Aught that can satisfy a heart which once Beat in the very breast and vital seat Of all things, and being forced to the extremes, Resents the unblest deformity and hath No function of a heart? Oh Queen, oh Mother, Take, take me back! I that ne'er wept before! Thou seest! Silent? Silent and these tears! Nay this is to outrun the Destinies. True I am fallen indeed, but not yet dead! Dead? How if dead not fallen? And perhaps From the high place I filled no more removed Than that her mournful and imperial hands Might urn me in a star? And as one bears A heavy sleeper with fast closèd lids Whose dreams like shadows of the truth repeat The outer perils darkly, in this sleep I have had visions? Hence wild phantasy! I live! Hast thou forgotten me? This brow These limbs that at thy feet thou hast so oft Looked down upon in love that I have seen The spheres grow pale missing their wonted light, How are they less than then? A friend—a foe— The beneficial difference of the sword Is in the using! Something I have done, Something may do. Chaos hath still his standard. Speak, or I join it! lead the dark attack By the most secret way; betray thy counsels; Make thy hid thoughts the common sport o' the air, Map thy designed war, and thine arch-foe Forearm with master-spells. Aye silence, silence. Why not? How should I move thee, O sublime Invulnerable? Though I not behold Thy countenance, I know that if the smile Dimmed on thy lips, or round thy brow serene Tempered the gracious summer, these whose sight Attains thy face had drooped their sudden heads With hopeless frost. But is it wise in thee With this imperial scorn to rouse an arm Which once was worth thine honour? To send forth Wrath which was once thine angel? And unloose A tongue which learned its language on thy breast Amid the nursling thunders? Thou art there And shalt be; nor can I aspire to shake Thy throne. But this terrestrial sovereignty, This sublunary verge and late domain Of empire, who shall save it? Speak to me! Or by a conscript hell—— [Pauses. In vain, in vain! Smile on! I see it all. Thou hast ta'en thought Of this defection. What I lift is not The hand that moved the heavens. Thy pride hath snapped The weapon it disused. The self-same touch Put me at once from duty and disservice, And dwarfed me from my native healthful height Below obnoxious stature. Shall I look Into the wayside pool to see my face, And shall a water-beetle blot it out? I could believe no less. Poor mannikin, Prate as thou list—pray, sing, preach, rave, despair, Square to the sun, defy the stars! Thou art free! Royally done! I am too mean a thing To have mine anger reckoned. This weak arm Is warrant for desertion; this cold heart May throb for whom it list; this scrannel voice Pipe here or there unchallenged. Everywhere Misfortune hath the privilege of treason And impotence prescription to rebel! Once it had not been thus; no, nor couldst thou, Oh Unapproachable Serenity, Have heard me all unmoved. But now sit calm. Wert thou the merest maid that ever lay Well-portioned and well-pleased before her glass Braiding her locks and shining thro' her curls Upon the kneeling lover at her feet Enough refusal, insolent and vain, Round her most dainty finger slow and cold With equal touch and languid cruelty Twining his heart-strings and her golden hair, I could not harm thee. I, who from thine height Beheld, and,—since we claim for corporal self Whatever bears the living head wherefrom The soul looks out—I that saw down from thence To the far footing of the solid dark My starry stature; I who with stern eye Did gaze into the opening infinite, And on the scale of that perspective scan This measured earth; I who would equal space, And as a thing apart in outer courts Contain creation; I am even contract To the dimensions of some elfin world. This checquered field shall be my vast expanse; Yon tree Igdrasil; any passing cloud In golden distance o'er my sinking head Shall arch sufficient Heaven; the nightly Moon Toil the horizon of a fairy ring As once I led her the majestic march Of this great globe, and in impatient power Danced round her steps as David round the Ark, And wheeling into utter depths returned About her languid motion. Day by day Shall bring my grain of wheat and drop of dew Content; and I shall see the rising Sun Above the Mole-heaps as I saw him once Above the hills of God! SCENE XXXV. The Study. Balder, solus. Balder. I could believe I heard myself grow thin, The slack and empty sail cling close and dry Upon the cordage masts and stays of life, My bare unmuffled bones collapse and clank And what was round and cheerful in this body Fall out of observation. Let it fall, It has survived my use—this goodly space And palace of the flesh which hall by hall I have given up, retreating from a voice Without, till, more than housed in the strait bounds Of its most secret cell, I find at last How little it bested me. I that laid My hand upon this breast and deemed I throbbed Beneath; who held my unity of powers In such most sweet conversion that it seemed Love was essential in the tranquil soul And wisdom cordial in the beating heart, Where am I? Did the echoes of the house Deceive me, and the murmur of the shell? My soul hath gone back like a sea on heaps Before a Prophet's rod; leaving that bare Which never saw the light—the gulphs and deeps And all the infand unknown which since the first It covered but was not. And I sit here Within my passions; and that writhing round Of rooted serpents rises like a ring Of licking flames about me. Some are dead And others gnaw them. Of the living, some Lie lank as worms; some roar as dragons; all Enjoy or suffer; and I see unmoved How each fulfils his office; coils and glides, Plays as when Eve stood smiling, warms, desires, Swells, springs, falls, maddens, struggles, twists and dies, Strangled in its own knots. I see them,—mine Not me; myself in the hot midst, a cold Calm lidless eye that neither hopes nor fears Nor loves nor hates nor smiles nor weeps nor prays. It cannot last. I am a living man Not an anatomy for time and change To scalpel when they teach the younger gods And show them subject man. You heavens, what right Makes me the bleeding instance? Why am I The Paragon of woes? How dare they seize These organs to discuss the novel signs Of unaccustomed torture? Must I bear That they may be instructed; with keen edge Distinguish what is mortal from the threads Of inconclusive anguish, and in slow Discovery one by one dissect away The stamens of endurance, with fine point Experimental and touch exquisite Detect of each rare core the central sense, Open the vesture of the secret nerve, Make bare the naked torment and lay out The warm and quivering Nature styled and strung For vital exposition? Malefactors, Who in the last resource of desperate hope Yield up their breathing bodies to the schools, Die under such division. Human hate On choicest victim of her direst hour Hath not accomplished it; the subtlest pains Of her most fell invention cannot pass That Lethe through which pitying Powers convey The wretch for whose worst crime in their just eyes 'Tis more than expiation to be aim Of such unheard-of purpose. Hell itself Hath no such agony; the very Damned Are plunged in whole. SCENE XXXVI. A Hill near the Tower Balder, solus. Balder. Like a sailing eagle old Which with unwavering wings outspread and wide Makes calm horizons in the slumbrous air Of cloudless noon and fills the silent heaven With the slow circulation of a course More placid than repose, this shining still And universal day revolves serene Around me, hasting not and uncompelled. But the tumultuous thought within my head Is a poor captive beast, that to and fro, Wild in the trepidation of mad pain Beats its red bars in blood. Gods! how it climbs This throbbing dungeon, leaps and falls and leaps In strong attempt, and strains a battered face Against the narrow outlets, gnaws the holds Of iron and shakes loud with desperate will The adamantine doors. What! have I caged A leopard in my pleasure-house? Am I A doomed city? are these halls a roost For owls and dragons? Shall the bittern cry Out of the stagnant courses of my heart And the fox litter in her palaces? My seat wherein I sat is overturned, My images are broken and cast down, My set and sacred places are defiled, My fair adornèd walls dismantled all And all the tattered tapestries of life Rent on the floors of Ruin! I do not rage Nor rave; but I ask you O ye blue heavens, What have I done? I do remember me That on a cottage threshold once I saw An idiot child. His blue orbs in his brow Were as when some round rosy cloud of morn Opens deep azure eyes and we see thro' To heaven. On his calm countenance there lay A lazy day of self-sufficing hours, And all the changes in his face were made By the soft feet of pleasure slow and fair. Is there a soul behind you? There was none In him! He was born deaf and dumb and blind And foolish. But he was as bright as you. SCENE XXXVII. A Glen among the Hills near the Tower. Balder, solus. Balder. I will return. Sitting down here this morn I turned my back Upon the sun, and now he sees my face. Waste hours—where all are waste! A round of sand Built in the endless sands with walls of sand. That the red Tartarean world I feel Within me hath reality without Amid the discord of my soul I yet Can make denial heard. And as a man With whose disloyal organs ruthless Fever Hath tampered till some play him false and all Are treasonable, touching one by one His harlequin environment constrains Protean shapes to stand and give response, And of attested qualities constructs A synthesis more sure than the sick eye, I, whom nor morning gladdens nor meek eve Consoles, do know my desperate malady And testify that fruitless eve and morn Have both done well. I will not be deceived, And so my day becomes a manifold And drear induction that sets Truth from Truth, As the blind hesitating sire of old Jacob from Esau; and with tender strength Of one who going must divide fond arms Enfolding, and unravel with stern love Soft intertwining fingers of dear hands That clasp him, doth unlock the enfoundered hulls And spars of the strange worlds I see and feel, And bid them pass as twain. Here where I sit The sun must needs be sweet,—the bees sing in it, And yon large fly—a hawk among his kind— Still in the very level of mine eye Keeps on the wing, with shining long delay Or sudden flash of capture. On the bank The nodding moor-hen lands to preen her quills. The trout hath left the alders of the pool And basks. Her beak the brooding king-fisher Shows, breathless, at her callow hole above The brook; within the eddies of the brook The water-mouse dissolves and reappears; Therefore 'tis halcyon weather. [He rises and walks homewara. The small flock That lay but now, fleece upon panting fleece, About the knees of yonder aged oak— Their lusty lord upon a gnarled root High in the cooler midst—descend and fill The lengthening shade. The weed that shuts at noon Is closer than a sleeping infant's lid; And the pale evening rose hath not yet set Her chalice for the dews; therefore it is That heavy hour of silent afternoon When even grief can slumber and forget. For me I know no seasons, nor will trust The tale of the extravagant heart that tells Between the orient and the setting sun A year of days, and calls the outer world Chaos let loose. [Enters the Garden. This green turf nicely fine A fairy host marshals its serried spears Innumerable, and of all not one Hath turned an edge; a human conflict here Had trodden it as o'er our helmèd heads The wrestling gods contending trample down A field of legions. Up the new spread walk Well-trimmed, my morning footsteps where I came,— Eight hours since by the dial,—still remain; None other near them: therefore I have been Alone, and as I walk I print a like And solitary record, therefore now I am alone. If I went forth at morn Thro' a well-tilled soft garden, and came back This very hour to find it trodden hard, Stamped to a summer floor, and all my home Threshed out upon it, flying here and there, Chaff on the wind, 'twere less incredible Than this approven solitude. Across My doorway I perceive the gossamer Drew silver bars behind me. They have lost The immaterial beauty of the morn, When passing on the gleaming wind they seem Rather effect than cause, the cutting sheen Of somewhat on the eye too swift for sight, Or hung across the early way appear A shining prohibition in the air No more. But these are stiff as rods of glass, And flat with drought. Therefore since I went forth None hath gone in or out. This looks like peace, And I must needs believe it. [Enters a room. How the motes In idle sunshine slowly circulate, A little heaven of worlds as calm and sweet As any stars above us. Eh! my breath Sucks gulphs beneath the golden equipoise And sets a viewless tide that bears away Systems and suns. Thou great astronomer, Perplexed by some new motion, Who on high Beyond thy telescopic organ stands Breathing? A wood wren! and the open lattice He passes deftly with familiar wing. No chance intruder, or the crystal panes Had toiled him, and my first step at the door Had been his fearful signal! Is the day Such and so comparably native here That even the tenants of the silent wood Deem it their own possession? Peace— [Enters an inner room. Asleep! Her pallid head upon her hand, and all The blighted harvest of her locks unsheaved Upon her pillow; whence a single hair Hangs its sweet tendril and by duest time Still kept to the fair rise and shadowy fall Of her white breast denotes how undisturbed The obedient air about her! To my cheek 'Tis hot and angered as with glare of fire! But the Mimosa by her doth not fade; Some dew is on the blossoms that she wears, Plucked, doubtless, in the shadow of the dell;— And I observe yon frail-winged butterfly Which fluttered through the eastern casement cool With freshest odours—and whose fairy fans Had shrivelled in a heat which cherishes This human flesh—doth palpitate unharmed Mid through the glow that scorched me. Inch by inch Adjusting every witness of the soul By such external warrants, I do reach Herself, the centre and untaken core Of this enchanted Castle whose far lines And strong circumvallations in and in Concentring I have carried, but found not The foe that makes them deadly; and I stand Before these most fair walls and know he lies Contained, and in the wont of savage war Prowl round my scatheless enemy and plot Where, at what time, with what consummate blow To storm his last retreat and sack the sense That dens her fierce malease. I am as one Who hearing music thro' the dark doth press Straight towards the sound and comes upon a tower, And feels along the impediment whereby To pass it; and the walls still put him back And the contained voice still calls and he Still pressing to the sound still journeyeth round His hid desire; and now by ear led on Draws nigh,—and now, when close pursuit should break The skin of fleshed enjoyment, hears the voice Fainter and fainter from the further cell. And so unconscious treads a beaten ring Following that moony voice that wanes and fills And wanes, and at the worst again is new. Till at the last, instructed by defeat, Step by slow step he measures round the wall The crescent sound, and at one loudest spot Of proximate possession lays his siege, And with his straining strength and bruised hands Would force the unyielding Stone! Thus have I tracked That still unseen disturber of my days Who in this holy sanctuary hath made His sacrilegious dwelling; yea could lay A finger on the small fair space that hides Within such alabaster and most pure Sarcophagus the cancerous atomy Which with its black disease, as with a stench, Infects this gracious world. From the wide air Thro' the freed earth and up the very stairs Of home, entrenched against me, hold by hold, Implacable with steady overthrow Of hounding hate incessant I dislodge him, And here before a scale of living bone Come to my final stop! and though my arms Can hem him in, and his unforced place To these avenging and swift hands be near As their own marrow, know him here at last Impregnable. Heavens! that the very knife Which doth uproot a weed would cut more deep Than should eradicate from the restored Sweet universe that thread of bitterness Which feeds the mighty shade that poisons all! That with one little stroke I could cut out This œcumenical and central wrong, And dare not do it! With no stronger use Of no more muscles than would rend this hair, This little hair—I could end once for all That sole accursed evil which hath been My Master! That the mortal chase hath brought Mine enemy to ground, and he lies here As far off from my just revenge as in The farthest of the stars! SCENE XXXVIII. The Hill-side. Enter Balder. Balder. Was this world built for happiness, that man In all his agonies since pain began Hath, as of intuition, changed its use And customary order; made the Night A banquet-hall for his cold feast of Death, And Day his weary chamber? Or was't wrought In equal seasons, that the separate walls Of twain but neighbouring mansions might contain The happy and the wretched? I that walked All this long night upon the bare hill-top Grow heavy in the sunshine and would sleep. [He lies down and sleeps—after a while starts up. This dream! why I came leaping out of it Half-witted and half-dead as one escapes From dungeons into air. I must have wept, too, The grass below my face is all bedewed,— Away! [Turns and sleeps. [Leaps up with disordered looks. No, no, it cannot be, it must not be, It shall not be!—Amy! [Looking up, his eye catches the clouds. You white full heavens! You crowded heavens that mine eyes left but now Shining and void and azure!— Ah! ah! ah! Ah! ah! ah! ah! ah! ah! ah! ah! ah! ah! By Satan! this is well. What! am I judged? You ponderous and slow-moving ministers, Are you already met? Are crimes begot Above? And do we sin to give the train And hungry following of the stately gods An office? Doth their pastime tarry there Because I lag? Is it to be endured That while I sleep the ready forum forms About me, and the conscript fathers wait The unaccomplished wrong? Hence! clear the heavens! Break up! What! can I not so much as dream But your substantial thunders must surround The ghostly fault, and with material towers And bodily environment hem in The thin unflesh'd commission? Do you close Upon me like a weary prey run down, Stalked to the final onset? But I live! Will you sit at the board while the meal walks? How if you are too soon? Who sees the game? Look down upon us here—which is your man? What have I done? My hands are white—behold! You solemn imperturbable o'er-high All-seeing and prededicate avengers, For once ye sit in vain! My will is not Yours; nor shall any terrors of your loud Discomfiture, nor any warning sign— No, tho' the rocked right half of heaven rolled o'er And stood at heaps on the sinister side— Unplant my fixed resolve. Mine eyes do pierce The lower ostentations of your brief And temporary royalty to reach A Paramount Supreme. SCENE XXXIX. The Study. A Writing-table, with Paper and Pens. Balder. Yes, I will bear, forbear, hope, labour, wait, Yet once again. He who from love of day Doth end his life in the obscurest hour Of long-lived night flies not from aged Nox But from unborn Aurora. 'Tis the part Of wisdom to endure. Whatever clime Surround, more fair, this sublunary scene, Howe'er we name those undiscovered Powers That rule us and do place our weal and woe, The problem of the wretched is to pass Not the set circumscription of his known And ordered ill, but the unsearched confines Of their supreme disposals. Failing that All fails; and the poor slave for whom extends No safe inviolable shore, no last Red Stygian frontier where the angry hordes Of hurrying hell must needs stand balked and droop The unavailing scorpions,—had best bend To his worst task, nor heat the blood of swift Inevitable vengeance. Once again— [Through the open door, Amy is heard. Amy. If thou art not, O death, if thou art not, I am immortal and not born to die, And time hath no dominion over me. Is this the secret of my wretched lot, Is this the secret of a happy world And all the joy of life that glads not me? I think I am immortal; I do think My unrespective being takes to-day The further woes of an eternal fate. In vain the earth is happy, and in vain, In vain, a little space above my head The dread and over-arching destiny Is calm and fair; I feel from pole to pole, Nor know the year that doth devour mine heart! Oh, God! Thou hast not made me for my lot, I faint in prospect of the shoreless sea! I cannot stand under the universe! That it would sink and crush me once for all! That I were broken as a thing defect, Wholly rubbed out as of no right to be, And as a heedless error of the hand Cancelled for ever from the book of life! [After a long silence she is heard again. That I might die and be no more at all, That I might cease out of the scheme of things, And all my place be filled up evermore! I am galled with my destiny; that one Would take my lot out of my scorched hands, And all my heritage in heaven and earth. Oh, God, forget me from thy universe, Oh, God, I have retired out of my life, The functions of my soul are dead, and I Am but a burning hope of not to be! Oh, God fulfil me; I am but this thirst, This all-consuming thirst, quench it and me! [After a long silence she is heard again. My punishment is more than I can bear, Oh, men, oh, living men, oh, passers by, No, this was not my sentence, no man yet For such a fault hath heard so hard a doom! For a small matter did they shut me in Upon the eve of war, and on the morn The tower was taken and the gaoler fled! My cell is in the dank and hollow ground, The ruins fell above it; no man knows Its place; I am forgotten in my land. I lay my hand upon the creeping thing, The worm crawls o'er me; the snail harbours up My limbs. I am as dark and all-forgot As any stone that never saw the sun And is and was and will be in the earth. I hear the sound of life above my head. The toads leap with it, and the very rock Shakes with the overgoing; but I know The fallen ruins lie on heap; my cry Can never struggle to the day; no man Will ever seek me. Hist! they move the stones! Fast, faster! or I famish! This was not My sentence! I was not shut in for this! No man could treat me so! oh, men, oh, men, The tower was taken and the gaoler fled,— Let me out, let me out! I starve! I starve! [Listening to this he rises. Balder. You great Gods, Here like a night-mare do I shake you off! [After a pause. Poor child, Come hither, perchance I can help thee. Hear me. [She comes. By all her wrongs, Her unrespited Patience, unreleased Endeavour, unremembered sighs and tears; By her unheard poor prayers, her unfulfilled Long hope, her uncrowned faith, her love unblest, Her unallayed incomparable sorrow; By all that hath no worthy place on earth, All that hath won no summons from the skies, I swear to set her free! Amy (kneeling before him). To set me free? Am I to be free? oh to set me free? It cannot be so. Sir, thou knowest not; They have forgotten me where I do lie; The tower was taken and the gaoler fled; The ruins fell on heap; the many stones Are o'er me; no man can come near nor tell The under earth is hollow. Oh to help me, Oh to come near me, oh to set me free! [She sinks on the floor weeping. Balder (musing). This leprosy Of murder being fairly out on me Hath lost its worst disease. The dark excess That for so many days o'er-loaded all My swollen veins, strangled each vital service, And pressing hard the incommoded soul In its unyielding tenement convulsed The wholesome work of nature, is expelled. The crisis of my malady is past And leaves me sane but hideous. I do stand Blood-hot from head to heel but cool within. Blood-wet and steaming blood from every pore Incarnadine, but retching at those mouths The red surcharge that killed me. I am calm And being calm shall better aim the bolt Forged and flung down amid the thunder-rain Of Passion. That great rain that did so drown The present where it fell that all beyond Looked back upon already seems a world Before the flood. I will even let her forth As a poor bird out of a burning cage. Nought in the direst caverns of the dark Untried unknown can be less kind to her Than I have been. Somewhere, perhaps, in space There may be better places than this world; No worse. Yes, I will let thee forth, poor child, Aye tho' the seven times sacred bars be built Of the twelve holy jewels, and I break The door that will not open! Amy! Amy! She sleeps! What! hath the very breath of murder Such odour of its substance that the air About me brings her to a doze like Death? 'Tis well! so can I test the untried strength That seems invincible. How now—how then? [He bends over her. Now,—These dark tresses that I lift aside To see the brow they shade, and, in my hand, Having no sensible motion yet do lie With something of agreement; nor as things Wholly inert, but lighter than their weight With strange and inner help:—then—Nay for if The hair grow after death? I have read so. Now a most pallid cheek and leaden lids Closed lids still livid with her latest pain; And on the cheek and on the lid two tears. Then—but they'll scatter morning flowers upon her, And if some dew-drops fall upon her face They must needs be as these—no lovelier No purer, nor less meet to call to mind The briny taste of human sorrow. Now A little stirring of the breast—then none. Now not so much as drives away the fly Upon her bosom—then—— You Gods, I curse ye! [After a pause. I did not tremble, therefore I can do't. [A very long silence, during which she still sleeps at his feet. Clock strikes. Another hour, and thou that sleepest there Hast like a rosy Angel that o'erstands The pale flat corse that is and is not she, Stood in my eyes and tried me. Am I bent Grey, weathered, travel-stained? The hidden truth And secret of that strange geography We traverse in the journey we call life I know not; but I know that in this hour I have inhabited each backward spot Left long ago, long past and, by my count, Almost as far behind as Heaven before. Whenever I did take thee by the hand With fatal purpose, thou sweet looking up Didst lead my ignorant steps and charmed eyes To ome dear olden scene and moment where I could not kill thee. None seemed far and none More near than any other. But I turned Upon the bruisèd body at my feet And would not see the phantom. Then it sang. And then I heard thee like a bell i' the air, Stirring the silver silence circulate About thee into music; while around Dreamy upon the wind the floating past Circled thee shining, as stained clouds about The watery moon, and all the ancient joy Came forth revolving in the coloured void, Well-wonted, nor life-weary, but with looks Terribly sweet, as waiting on thy voice And only lacking thee to be again. And I am shaken with grief and my black fate Shrieks as a night of tempest at my head And the dream passes like far village chimes Blown on a rushing twilight full of rain. I did not tremble; therefore I can do't. Who if not I? Poor Dove, Poor Dove, I caught thee In the eagle's talons and did carry thee Up to the heights I dared nearest the sun And scorched thee blind! And shall my pinions fail To hurry thee beyond the temperate bound Of mortal anguish, or refuse that great And consummating mercy-stroke that cleaves The last of vital ether and doth end Captive and captor in the final blaze Of solar conflagration! I can do it. Whether these mortal Dædalean wings Will bear me living to the central pyre, The dire event must try. Enough to know I shall not die till I have seen thee first In safe destruction; this most exquisite flesh These tender filaments will have transpired Invisible in incense filling Heaven Ere I am ashes. Oh my Beautiful My Beautiful why wert thou ever mine? Why didst thou love me? What had I to do With thee? Oh Eve, oh happy happy Eve, Why didst thou hear my voice? Was Paradise Too narrow to content thee? Paradise That if thou wert immortal would have brought Some better flower for every sweeter day Of thy still blest for-ever; nor had asked More answering care than this—that for the fame Of her dear handiwork thou shouldst not bend Thy cheek above her blushing rose nor wear Her lily in thy breast! What dost thou here? Have I the hand that pencils the white page Of snowdrops, or doth hang on the fine ear Of each unhurt fair blossom morn by morn Its pendulous jewel; is my manly texture Soft as the silken slopes of Venus' thigh, That I should touch thee? Can I give thee food Celestial? or what vital element Dissolve in a sweet draught of delicate air And serve thee? Is my home an amber tent Of April cloud? Are my black oaken floors Light-paven levels such as spirits walk At moon-rise? Can I take an evening mist And dip it in the west and clothe thy limbs With gold and purple? Have I zephyr-winds To wait upon thee, and to snood thine hair With gossamer? Then wherefore art thou mine? That any immortality of pangs The damned know not might buy this boon for me, This only boon—to set thee back again In thy first best estate! to wrench mine heart-strings From thy life's web and burn them in deep hell! What weary Angel exiled from the skies, Her baby at her breast, with failing strength Paused at this earth and left thee? Thou wert not Of us and being grown up shouldst have gone Back to thine heaven; or having business here It should have been in some excepted task Set out and sacred from the common lot. If there be any still and vesper hour More pure than all the day, thou shouldst have been Its tutelar, to lead it in and out, Versed in the duteous season and each rite Of welcome and farewell. This changeful earth Should be to thee a garden where we take Rare pleasaunce and in happy weather walk But do not dwell. Thou shouldst have dwelt afar With everlasting Morning, going forth With her and from her chaste urn unrebuked —Dipping thy sinless hand—shouldst sprinkle dews Or at the side of Spring, her handmaiden Bearing her violets, what time she comes Over the hills descending shouldst have passed Into this valley blessing it and me. And shouldst have loved me only while the fields Were sown, nor pitied me forlorn, nor heard My vows, nor faithless to thy Goddess-queen Forgot thy better duty, but have gone When she went, singing o'er the southern slopes Joyous beside her; turning on the height For my sake and in richer violet-beds Betraying that thine hand relaxed with thought. So thou shouldst still have left me and returned With the pervading year, for ever young, Till that sad season when thy tearful care Found not the old man on the wonted hill Nor by the thorn nor the memorial tree; And made a time of strange forget-me-nots And melancholy flowers that love the rain Setting the fairest banks with saddest blooms And by a grassy mound in one deep dell Beating thy breast let fall the store of spring, So that to other vales the spring came late Tarrying for thee. And whenceforth thou being given To sudden sighs and musings didst not keep Thine old unblamed attendance, and no more Didst sow thy flowers with free impartial hand, But, sick with fitful fancies, oft delayed Oft hasted, till for many hapless years Spring lost her fame on earth; nay had a weird And crazy name, because that fall by fall Thou still remindful didst steal back alone To trim my grave, and ever and anon After the snows were white didst visit me Being ill at rest; and lo! in that strange dell Unseasonable thaws and timeless flowers And none knew why. But I have taken thee And in my coarse and savage ignorance Put thee to mortal uses. Bent these hands Which from some flowery chalice should have fed The early bee, to grind the daily bread Of household travail, set to vulgar toil These tender fingers which were made to unfold The plaited wings of butterfly or know One violet from another, and this frame For which if she had found it anywhere Forsaken Nature of herself had wrought Peculiar season, left a prey to harsh Inclement fortunes, torn by winds of woe, Bit by the frosts of poverty and struck To the scorched marrow by the burning stroke I did not feel. Thou art avenged! avenged! Oh Amy! wilt thou go back to thy fields Of childhood, and the walls of the old home That loved thee? Wilt thou wander late at eve, When all the west is still and black, and pass Among the dim trunks of remembered trees Like a returning sunset? Will the flowers Be fairer there to-morrow, and grey men Look on the year and praise it with the years Of youth, and all the village that so long Had drooped for thee, like a revivèd plant That drinks by dark a subtle sustenance Which no man seeth, lift the sudden head That yesterday was low? There wilt thou be Oread and Naiad, or from many oaks Whisper thy secret, wander like a sigh Thro' green woods where we wandered, or persuade Misfortune from the happy cots we loved, Or spread by tranquil Night or genial Day Felt but unseen a necessary health Within, without, thro' all the charmèd place, The hearth serener and the happier bed, The ways auspicious and the waters safe? No go not there! The very paths are yet Bare with my footsteps. I shall haunt thee still. I have distraught thy world, and thy poor skill Can never recompose it. Night by night Thou shouldst behold me in the western sky Dyed with thy blood. Spring, Summer, Autumn, Winter, Should be the racking seasons of the day I killed thee; every custom of mankind A various form of murder; aye the knife Upon the unoffending cottage board Round which the children sit, should rise unheld And stab thee to the heart. Rather return Into this general nature, whereof thou Art not so much a part or element As the consummate whole in a given space More visible,—a ripple of the sea. The whole is happy; sink into the whole. I think there is no separate tenement —No, though thou wert an angel far in heaven— Where thy meek subject soul would dare refuse Ingress to mine. Better be re-dissolved, Nor have one atom of thine unconstrained Free essence so defined as to receive The local weight of sorrow, nor a sense So fashioned to contain a human thought As to remember me! SCENE XL. The Study. Balder, solus, at the open window. Balder. Oh you o'er-arching and high heavens on whom I call, because that as remote from me Ye must be good; that as diverse from me Ye must be strong; that as serene above The comprehension of my human sense, Ye may be happy; is it well, you heavens, That ye look down on such a thing as I? If your innumerous hosts be seraphs crowned, Thronèd, with radiant limbs and upturned eyes Reflecting God,—and such, methinks, but now I saw at eve ere the great choir was filled Taking their thrones expectant of the hour, And for the general anthem one by one Tuning their harps and shedding dewy tears Ecstatic,—if they sit there to adore, And have perpetual function of mere praise, Were it not wise, ye heavens, to draw your clouds Between us? I was faithful once as they, And mighty as the mightiest who doth sweep His golden starry strings, and with the sound Lighten these tuneless deeps. If I were God They should not see this heart. SCENE XLI. The Study. Balder, solus, by the window. Balder. And once since then it hath been night and day. Before my open eyes the useless sun Perfunctory again hath been drawn up Over yon east. Why I know not, nor care, For in my soul the season hath not changed. [Pauses. It must be done. How I have learned so well That the dread lesson going to and fro On the bare surface of my beaten brain Hath trod out its own footsteps. Yet once more Let me dispose it in the attitude Of due performance. This most sovereign gift Of long-sought death should be the last and best Of all our sweet love-tokens, and bestowed In the ripe moment and receptive throb Of her consent, my hint and cue to be Her own entreaty. Good. [Pauses. ‘That I might die,’ And then I strike. [Pauses. —Who struck? Liar, not I! For in this forehead came the mortal dint And stunned me! Down from my flayed shoulders thou Intolerable weight that like a beast Hast dropt on me out of the mystery And blackest umbrage. I have enough to bear, I hurl thee off—aye, tho' thou clawest my life And rollest into Hell. I have not sinned! It is no sin! Did she not beg for death? Is it not blessed to give? And if the gift Bankrupt the giver—how? You heavens, if I Am merely poor that she who gave her mite Was Crœsus' widow! Did she not pray too? Have I not heard her at midnight and noon? And she was righteous, and her righteous prayer Must needs avail: what is to come must come. Whether by thunder-bolt, or secret touch Of plague, or undetermining event Of irrespective hap, or by the hand Of love, how guiltier? Beast, I have not sinned! Off!—Why 'tis well. Thus as with sudden shout I scare it from me, and these worse within That like a pack of hungry wolves disperse A moment into darkness and return Ravening the more. Vain labour to vain end. Even let them gorge their full. My pride is carrion And stinks to be devoured. Hie in you hell-dogs And split your hides! There is no good in me; Why cavil in what fashion I shall wear The necessary evil of an essence Inexorably bad? If that which lives In this detested arm had warmed the sap And swelled the branches of some innocent tree, A murderer would have plucked it. Do you weep Ye heavens? Let fall your balmy tears in vain. Aye, make the grass green that she may not tread; Let brooks prate idly, fill the empty earth With wasted flowers. What matter? Have your will Niggard or good. None evermore shall see Or hear. My Beautiful, my Beautiful, Thou art slain! Thou art slain! God, that I had not been; That I had perished in my father's veins! That some fore-blasting flash had dried me up, And nature had not known an hour or womb So cursed as to conceive me! [He sits silent for two hours by the window. Forty times and five, And every time to each twin beak a meal; Two meals and but a single fly to each Fourscore and ten; but I perceive the bird Feedeth by favour, and the further beak That hath a forward air and overhangs The pendant threshold at each dole enjoys A double bounty. Do both parent birds Concern in this fond labour? I think both. They seem alike; but measuring with mine eye By the small boles and bosses of the nest I mark that the alternate visitant Plants its right tiny foot where the left claw Of the last comer rested, and this so Not once or twice within the laws of chance, But in such due succession as bespeaks Or choice or habit personal. If choice Then both by differentia, since in birds The sense of numbers, if such sense exist, Solely perceptive must of need omit Numerical relation, and if habit Both by the hypothesis. Oh thou great grief, That like a lion at the foot of a tree Dost wait for me—gape thy red jaws! I come! It must be done. The very day is doomed. A shut and funeral city hung with black Is not more different from the daily streets Than this day from another. As on morn Of foul and horrid execution The sullen Tyrant orders from the North His hideous hordes upon the glowing land That loved the captive, Winter ere his time Upon the genial season hath advanced Sudden with all his Power. Down the moist walls The long snail slimes; cold things of fen and pool Come within doors and as a native stone Do crawl the grisly hearth; and in my soul This palpable obscurity repeats The outer darkness, and within, without, Cosmic and microcosmic, as yon twain Round answering hemispheres, world answers world. I cannot see the hills or the mild sky, Or aught of gentler aspect that beheld Might yet dissuade me. To mine inward eyes That might have met unmanned such sweet array Of sacred opposition, there is now Nought but the inner mist and through the mist A path stark clear. Therefore it must be done. As one who having stared upon the sun, Turning his eyeballs downward doth bedaub The blotted world with black, to my hot sight A moving pall is in the air and when I think of her it falls upon the face I could not slay. Therefore it must be done. Nature herself consenting to the deed Lets her veil round it, and to me shut in Of all her universe doth leave alone The victim and the knife. Therefore, oh God, It must be done. [He attempts to rise. I will arise. Rare moment! The slow will hath not reached the idle thews, Yet, being dispatched, the irrevocable deed Is now in act, and I that have not moved Already am felonious. What! is this A dream, that the strong cause o'ershoots the effect And passes with its message the untouched Dull functions it should stir? At length I stand. What! am I chained? Have I trunk-hose of lead? The door—the door—my limbs do help the ground Sucking me in. The threshold is not yet. I labour against the stedfastness o' the air, Which bars my breast, and, as two walls of ice Falling together with mine head between, Enlocks me. Hands, hands, nothing but hands—Ah! Is it so horrible that very nothing Conceives to stay it? Off! I will be free. Darkness at noon! Aye, aye, the flood swells fast. This lightning—— [Sinks in a swoon. [After lying long he rccovers and sits up. A swoon? So best. Zero once past is past, And the uncounted scale beneath hath not A credible extreme. I am a man Who with the very gate of death shuts out Each earthly work behind him, and, with all His human powers in one, comes back to do A single office. By this strait I leave The womb of failing nature, and am born Invincible; safer perhaps to know The range of chance, and stronger to have felt The worst of mortal weakness. Weakness? Bah! I turned the sword of manhood in my hand And with mine eye I tried it, and on edge The broad attempered steel went out of sight. A true Damascus blade! [Clock strikes. One, two, three, four, Five, six, seven. Never trembling wretch that hears The form of Justice, strained at the approach Of that one final word that holds his fate, As I for that last stroke. I well remember that at eight o'clock We, far asunder, kept a tryst in Heaven Night after night for years. At that sweet hour, She had a prayer she used to say for me, And ever since I think the very time Repeats it. I have need of prayers to-night, And I do think the evening air so oft Ensweetened with her deprecating breath Will then be gracious for her. I'll not haste Nor to the moment of the deed abate One jot that smooths the doing. [Going to the window. Brittle world! Thou hast another hour ere I do break thee. For she shall live until the clock strikes eight. Oh heavy, heavy curfew! SCENE XLII. The Vacant Study. Busts, books, a harp, &amp;c. A locked writing-case on the table. Enter Amy (her face very pale,—her hair dishevelled,—her dress disordered). Amy. Aye—this is the place, This is the chamber of his nights and days. Let me lie close. Where be these mistresses For which his lawful wife must sit in the shade? [Taking up the writing-case. What are you in here? [Shaking the case. Do you know me, girls? This makes the treason full; I have endured Too long. Have I not loved him like a god? Am I not beautiful? Is it no shame That he should leave these limbs for harridans That I can shake together in a box? It must be ended—I will wait him here And he shall do me right. [Crouches down in a corner. Enter Balder.—He stands a long time silent. Balder. Ye pale companions, marble counsellors, Who for so many years have been content To ratify my will; or in the shine Of whose mysterious influence I have been The unwitting creature of a power unknown Wrought by the pitiless necessity Of your supreme ascendant; Deities Or Slaves,—I know not whether—but not stones! Ye who have darkened with me as white brows Of the invulnerable rocks with thunder, And in my triumphs have been moved as gods Changing unchangeable with such a truth Of inner motion that the deferent eye Obeyed the conscious soul and saw a change Sweeter than mortal beauty, like the smiles That flit and flicker in dim light about The lips of death! Oh thou dear sanctuary, Wherein as in a body I have dwelt The informing spirit, finding more and more My wish forelaid, my wants fulfilled in thee, Till going forth from thee the plastic sense Subserves thee, absent, and I stretch the hand To the familiar distance, and raise vain eyes,— As an unbodied ghost new given to air Enfolds the immaterial arms, and strains To lift the wonted limbs! my stringless harp, —Poor empty skull that hadst so sweet a tongue— Ye broken tablets;— [Opening the case and taking forth a scroll. Thou material soul, Thou uncontained dimension, thou dead self, Which art not I, and shalt perhaps revive When this I am is nought; thou wondrous voice That canst be seen and touched; thou strange parhelion That wilt not set with me; thou Ariel Fast in the rifted pine; thou Afreet dread And fierce, whom, sealed by a strong sign of power, As in a charmèd vial thus I hold Inert and silent, so that a child's hand May bear thee harmless, place thee here and here, Take thee and leave thee,—thou that being loosed Mayst leap forth like a blast of the simoom And tear a host to tatters; thou entombed And mummied past; thou colourless substantial Which in a light unrisen shalt be called A microcosm of beauty; thou dull moonstone Dark as cold lava now—that rushing o'er The upturned heads of nations might'st have shone A blazing portent, troubling thrones of kings; Thou black uncomely root; thou trifling seed; Thou grain of poison or of antidote So little and so much; thou extillation And sacred concrete of the golden cloud That filled the azure of my years, and like The legendary water-drop that falls On Abyssinian summit and becomes Egyptian harvests—wert to flood the earth; Oh thou that I have made in fear and awe And ignorance, knowing only thou canst smite Angels and fiends, and shake the shrines of Gods; Thou hidden secret, master Alchemy And cunningest composition of mine art, Which as a fireball with this unknown hand Approaching through the dark I thought to throw Into the smouldering ashes of mankind And see, with thunder like the clap of doom, From earth to heaven—as if a pillared light Shot up from the rent centre of the world— The midnight of my wretched race made day With my unthought-of glory— [Amy, rising suddenly, approaching wildly, snatches the scroll and throws it through the open window into the moat. Amy. Glory? see! Can it light up that pit down where I dwell Out of the light of day and of the stars? Out of the light o' the grave;—Aye, the dull earth Below the dead is not so black with night But the great day shall stir it! Is it well That the dull earth below the dead hath light And I am dark for ever? Is that well? Is that well, husband? Husband, is it well? Oh yes, thy glory! Yes—he must have glory, Yes, he must have his glory; he can stand All day in the sun, but he must have his glory! He has walked here up in the sunshine world, He has been in the wind and the sweet rain, And none cried ‘Upset the cup o' the honey-time, Upset the cup o' the honey-time,’ And I am empty and dry. [Looks vacantly on the ground. Thy glory? I pray thee, husband, tell me what it is. Is it a god that it can set me free? Hath it limbs to burrow? Can it reach me? Is it any thing that I have known? There was Love—I knew it—thou taughtest me. How many songs hast thou not sung of love? [Sings. ‘When first I courted thee, Amy, The years we knew were fair and few, I was gay as break of day, And thou wert pure as dew. I looked into thy face, Amy, No word I said, no tear I shed, My love-light true fell in thy dew, And came back rosy-red.’ Or, ‘Love broke his golden bow, chasing thee long ago, Then the boy cried, Thou didst in pity turn’—— Nay not that, but, ‘Come love, and bring Sweet hope and joy’—— Words, words! what are they, down Where I am? Oh, my husband, would it reach me? Dost think that it would reach me for thy sake? Dost think it would? And will it fetch me back? Being thine? I do remember all things thine Did love me. There was never dog of thine But if I looked would run before my eyes And bay for pleasure; if I dropped my glove 'Twould carry it, poor Pompey! Bay? Who spoke Of Bays? Is this a time to mock me, Husband? Yet some one hath said somewhat of the sea; I think I heard it; Didst thou speak of the sea? Why do I see the sea? And was it kind That thou shouldst maunder to me of the sea? To me? To me? Alas! the moonlight water! Dost thou mind when we sailed together, love, We two alone, and thou didst say the moon Was like a silver boat,—and so the silver Slanted—I know not how,—and I fell in Deep, deep. But I am deeper, deeper now. I think the sea-rocks gaped and I fell here With all the sea between me and the wind, And the sea-rock between me and the sea. I strike it thus.— [Striking her head against the stone wall. Balder. My Amy! Amy. Why how now? Do not move me, but rather move it for me; For why should I lie here out of the world? Thou knowest not, husband, what it is to lie With all the sea between thee and the wind, And the sea-rock between thee and the sea. I say why should I lie here? Out of all The beauty of the earth, the blessed chime Of things, the touch and furthest cast of good, The common warmth of human kind, the voice Of man or God? Out of the very sea That rolls and rolls above my aching head And will not cool these lips? Man, what have I To do with thee? How long is't since we two Drew near? If I am altered since we met, What then? Have we dwelt at the further poles For nought? Because my puppet warmed thy bed And filled thy chair have we been side by side? Ah, ah! didst never look in at the eye And miss me? What, didst never hear my heart Like a clock ticking in an empty house? Husband? Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah,— [Pauses. Do not disbelieve. They will scoff at thee, they will shake thy dream Out of thy soul, they will deny, deny This where I am, but thou hast heard a voice Out of its depths, thou hast heard it! does it sound Like a beloved familiar? Is there fire Above-ground that could smelt what thou didst love To this? Hast met it anywhere on earth My husband? Aye, and have I frightened thee Into my mate? Shoot out thine eyeballs more! See! see! [Dancing before him. Thou canst not shut up ears and eyes. List to my voice, my voice which I upheave As I did force it through a dome of brass. Mine hour is come. I will cry in thine ears And burst in crying. Canst thou tell how deep By the sound? Black—black—Hast a good ear for colour? It bubbles thro' it all, up—up—I think Thou dost not hear me, but thou shalt hear once, Once, only once, and I will be so silent, So silent—thou shalt not look pale at me, Thou shalt not chatter thy long teeth at me. Thou shalt not show out thy black beard at me. What, does it grow so fast? What, have I scared thee? What, does the white skin shrink back down the roots? Art thou a porcupine? What! Shall I dance? Aye, husband, dance and sing; aye, hear me sing. Hear! thou shalt hear; my voice is coming up; Hark, hark, it comes; dyed with the dark, it comes! Now it comes into me, now I will cry; [She shrieks. I am his wife! This is my murderer! Make way, make way, this is a murderer! I am in hell, slain, lost, robbed, murdered, mad, He did it, he! Balder. He knows it. Amy. Mad, mad, mad. [Sinking in his arms in a swoon. Balder. Now, now, my soul! it must be ere she wake. I will bear this alone; she shall not know The hand that strikes—This hand! Nor man nor fiend Would do thee harm but me! Now—now—yet oh! That it must be now. That it had been while The fire of madness burned her, and she swelled And blackened like a burning house, once home, Now but a house in flames. For home is not The stone that holds it; and the elements That once were Amy, and which marked thy place And made thee visible, were neither thou Nor all thou wert to me, nor all thou art, Lying this moment here, here as of old, And with no sign in heaven or earth to say That thou canst never waken as of old. Yet one more kiss which thou canst not return. Return? And hast thou given thy last? Oh, Amy, Wake, wake! My last? And taken as the others? [Bows his head into his hand. Accursed coward, and is this thy love? Poor slaughtered innocent, thou hadst good right To scorn me! Closer, closer to my heart, There thou didst find the bane, and shouldst receive The final counterpoison. [Begins to divest her. Heaving breast, How oft have I undone thy weeds as now, And very softly, very silently As now—and not more tenderly, no not More tenderly, no, on thy bridal night, No, not more tenderly. But oh, you heavens, Wherefore and wherefore? Here, under her bosom, It cannot fail here. Hide thee, hide thee, Heart; Poor fluttering bird, why wilt thou stir the lilies? Dost thou not know me who I am? Soft, soft; Thou hast so often struggled in mine arms Asleep, and I have wakened thee with kisses, I pray thee do not struggle now, my child, I cannot rouse thee from this dream. Oh God, If she should clasp her hands upon her breast And moan! If she should feel through this thin trance The cold steel ere it pierce and call on me For help!—but I will hold thee fast, my child, Fast in these arms altho' thou start and cry, And shield thee from myself! If I strike ill The first stroke, and she wake and strive for life; If she should ope her eyes but once too late And go forth to believe for evermore I struck unkindly— [Throws a kerchief over her face. No, she shall not see me. And now thy living face is gone for ever, And I have murdered thee before thy time. Nor God nor Demon could have wrung from me This moment, this last moment, only thou, Oh, only thou.— [Frantically lifts the kerchief. Amy! Thou, thou, all thou! Help me, my child. Aye, look so beautiful. 'Tis well; if there be heaven this is not To kill thee.—Now. THE END LATER MISCELLANEOUS POEMS. THE MAGYAR'S NEW-YEAR-EVE. (1859.) By Temèsvar I hear the clarions call: The year dies. Let it die. It lived in vain. Gun booms to gun along the looming wall, Another year advances o'er the plain. The Despot hails it from his bannered keep: Ah, Tyrant, is it well to break a bondsman's sleep? He might have dreamed, and solved the conscious throes Of Time and Fate in some soft vision blest: Sighed his thick breath in childhood's happy woes, Or spent the starry tumult of the breast On some dear dreamland maid, nor known how high The blind heart beats to hours like this. 'Tis nigh! Lo in the air a trouble and a strife; I feel the future. Mighty days to come Strain the strong leash a moment into Life: Shapes beckon: voices clamour and are dumb: And viewless nations charge upon the blast That blows the spectral host to silence, and is past. Hark, hark! the great hour strikes! The stroke peals ‘one;’ Again! again! God! Have the earth and sky Stopped breathing? Will it never end? 'Tis done. The years are rent asunder with a cry, The big world groans from all her gulphs and caves, And sleeping Freedom stirs, and rocks the martyrs' graves. Oh. ye far Few, who, battle-worn and grey, Watch from wild peaks the plains where once ye bled, Oh ye who but in fortune less than they Keep the lone vigil of the immortal Dead, Behold! And, like a fire from steep to steep, Draw, draw the dreadful swords whereon ye lean and weep! And oh you great brave harvest, that, war-ploughed And sown with men, a grateful country yields, You bearded youth who, beardless, saw the proud Ancestral glories of those smoking fields That now beneath ten grassy years lie cold, Rise! Shew your children how your fathers fought of old! But we are fettered, and a bondsman's ire, Howe'er it flash, can only end in show'rs. Who shall unlade these limbs? Alas, the fire Of passion will not melt such chains as ours; We have but heated them in wrath of men To harden them in women's tears. What then? Less than both hands at once what Freeman gives To Freedom? Stand up where the Tyrant stands, Draw in one breath the strength of slavish lives, Lift the twin justice of your loaded hands, And with that double thunder in the veins Launch on his fated head the vengeance of your chains! They hear! I see them thro' dissolving night! Like sudden woods they rise upon the hills! The mountains stream with a descending sight, The hollow ear of vacant landscape fills, From side to side the living landscape warms, To arms! Yon bleeding cloud is spread! Day breaks! To arms! Aye, Tyrant, the day breaks. Look up and fear. To arms! A greater day than day is born! To arms! A larger light than light is near! A blacker night than midnight foams with morn! Arise, arise, my Country, from the flood! Arise, thou god of day, and dye the east with blood! THE YOUTH OF ENGLAND TO GARIBALDI'S LEGION. (1) Those 1,067 Cacciatori, who, after conquering in the Lombard campaign, set out, unassisted, and ‘looking upon themselves as already dead’ (vide Times), to complete, in face of a fleet and three armies, the work of Italian emancipation. (1860.) O ye who by the gaping earth Where, faint with resurrection, lay An empire struggling into birth, Her storm-strown beauty cold with clay, The free winds round her flowery head, Her feet still rooted with the dead, Leaned on the unconquered arms that clave Her tomb like Judgment, and foreknew The life for which you rent the grave, Would rise to breathe, beam, beat for you, In every pulse of passionate mood, A people's glorious gratitude,— But heard, far off, the mobled woe Of some new plaintiff for the light; And leave your dear reward, and go In haste, yet once again to smite The hills, and, like a flood, unlock Another nation from the rock; Oh ye who, sure of nought but God And death, go forth to turn the page Of life, and in your heart's best blood Date anew the chaptered age; Ye o'er whom, as the abyss O'er Curtius, sundered worlds shall kiss, Do ye dream what ye have done? What ye are and shall be? Nay, Comets rushing to the sun, And dyeing the tremendous way With glory, look not back, nor know How they blind the earth below. From wave to wave our race rolls on, In seas that rise, and fall, and rise; Our tide of Man beneath the moon Sets from the verge to yonder skies; Throb after throb the ancient might In such a thousand hills renews the earliest height. 'Tis something, o'er that moving vast, To look across the centuries Which heave the purple of a past That was, and is not, and yet is, And in that awful light to see The crest of far Thermopylæ, And, as a fisher draws his fly Ripple by ripple, from shore to shore, To draw our floating gaze, and try The more by less, the less by more, And find a peer to that sublime Old height in the last surge of time. 'Tis something: yet great Clio's reed, Greek with the sap of Castaly, In her most glorious word midway Begins to weep and bleed; And Clio, lest she burn the line Hides her blushing face divine, While that maternal muse, so white And lean with trying to forget, Moves her mute lips, and, at the sight, As if all suns that ever set Slanted on a mortal ear What man can feel but cannot hear, We know, and know not how we know, That when heroic Greece uprist, Sicilia broke a daughter's vow, And failed the inexorable tryst,— We know that when those Spartans drew Their swords—too many and too few!— A presage blanched the Olympian hill To moonlight: the old Thunderer nods; But all the sullen air is chill With rising Fates and younger gods. Jove saw his peril and spake: one blind Pale coward touched them with mankind. What, then, on that Sicanian ground Which soured the blood of Greece to shame, To make the voice of praise resound A triumph that, if Grecian fame Blew it on her clarion old, Had warmed the silver trump to gold! What, then, brothers! to brim o'er The measure Greece could scarcely brim, And, calling Victory from the dim Of that remote Thessalian shore, Make his naked limbs repeat What in the harness of defeat He did of old; and, at the head Of modern men, renewing thus Thermopylæ, with Xerxes fled And every Greek Leonidas, Untitle the proud Past and crown The heroic ages in our own! Oh ye, whom they who cry ‘how long’ See, and—as nestlings in the nest Sink silent—sink into their rest; Oh ye, in whom the Right and Wrong That this old world of Day and Night Crops upon its black and white, Shall strike, and, in the last extremes Of final best and worst, complete The circuit of your light and heat; Oh ye who walk upon our dreams, And live, unknowing how or why The vision and the prophecy, In every tabernacled tent— Eat shew-bread from the altar, and wot Not of it—drink a sacrament At every draught and know it not— Breathe a nobler year whose least Worst day is as the fast and feast Of men—and, with such steps as chime To nothing lower than the ears Can hear to whom the marching spheres Beat the universal time Thro' our Life's perplexity, March the land and sail the sea, O'er those fields where Hate hath led So oft the hosts of Crime and Pain— March to break the captive's chain, To heal the sick, to raise the dead, And, where the last deadliest rout Of furies cavern, to cast out Those Dæmons,—ay, to meet the fell Foul belch of swarming Satan hot From Ætna, and down Ætna's throat Drench that vomit back to hell— In the east your star doth burn; The tide of Fate is on the turn; The thrown powers that mar or make Man's good lie shed upon the sands, Or on the wave about to break Are flotsam that nor swims nor stands; Earth is cold and pale, a-swoon With fear; to the watch-tower of noon The sun climbs sick and sorrowful, Or, like clouded Cæsar, doth fold His falling greatness to behold Some crescent evil near the full. Hell flickers; and the sudden reel Of fortune, stopping in mid-wheel Till the shifted current blows, Clacks the knocking balls of chance And the metred world's advance Pauses at the rhythmic close; One stave is ended, and the next Chords its discords on the vext And tuning Time: this is the hour When weak Nature's need should be The Hero's opportunity, And heart and hand are Right and Power, And he who will not serve may reign, And who dares well dares nought in vain. Behind you History stands a-gape; On either side the incarnadine Hot nations in whom war's wild wine Burns like vintage thro' the grape, See you, ruddy with the morn Of Freedom, see you, and for scorn As on that old day of wrath The hosts drew off in hope and doubt, And the shepherd-boy stept out To sling Judæa upon Gath, Furl in two, and, still as stone, Like a red sea let you on. On! ay tho' at war's alarms That sea should flood into a foe! On! the horns of Jericho Blow when Virtue blows to arms. Numberless or numbered—on! Men are millions, God is one. On! who waits for favouring gales? What hap can ground your Argosy? A nation's blessings fill your sails, And tho' her wrongs scorched ocean dry, Yet ah! her blood and tears could roll Another sea from pole to pole. On! day round ye, summer bloom Beneath, in your young veins the bliss Of youth! Who asks more? Ask but this, —And ask as One will ask at Doom— If lead be true, if steel be keen? If hearts be pure, if hands be clean? On! night round ye, the worst roak Of Fortune poisoning all youth's bliss; Each grass a sword, each Delphic oak An omen! Who dreads? Dread but this,— Blunted steel and lead unsure, Hands unclean and hearts impure! Full of love to God and man As girt Martha's wageless toil; Gracious as the wine and oil Of the good Samaritan; Healing to our wrongs and us As Abraham's breast to Lazarus; Piteous as the cheek that gave Its patience to the smiter, still Rendering nought but good for ill, Tho' the greatest good ye have Be iron, and your love and ruth Speak but from the cannon's mouth— On! you servants of the Lord, In the right of servitude Reap the life He sowed, and blood His frenzied people with the sword, And the blessing shall be yours, That falls upon the peacemakers! Ay, tho' trump and clarion blare, Tho' your charging legions rock Earth's bulwarks, tho' the slaughtered air Be carrion, and the encountered shock Of your clashing battles jar The rung heav'ns, this is Peace, not War With that two-edged sword that cleaves Crowned insolence to awe, And whose backward lightning leaves Licence stricken into law, Fill, till slaves and tyrants cease, The sacred panurgy of peace! Peace, as outraged peace can rise When her eye that watched and prayed Sees upon the favouring skies The great sign, so long delayed, And from hoofed and trampled sod She leaps transfigured to a god, Meets amid her smoking land The chariot of careering War, Locks the whirlwind of his car, Wrests the thunder from his hand, And, with his own bolt down-hurl'd, Brains the monster from the world! Hark! he comes! His nostrils cast Like chaff before him flocks and men. Oh proud, proud day, in yonder glen Look on your heroes! Look your last, Your last: and draw in with the passionate eye Of love's last look the sights that paint eternity. He comes—a tempest hides their place! 'Tis morn. The long day wanes. The loud Storm lulls. Some march out of the cloud, The princes of their age and race; And some the mother earth that bore Such sons hath loved too well to let them leave her more. But oh, when joy-bells ring For the living that return, And the fires of victory burn, And the dancing kingdoms sing, And beauty takes the brave To the breast he bled to save, Will no faithful mourner weep Where the battle-grass is gory, And deep the soldier's sleep In his martial cloak of glory, Sleeps the dear dead buried low? Shall they be forgotten? Lo, On beyond that vale of fire This babe must travel ere the child Of yonder tall and bearded sire His father's image hath fulfilled, He shall see in that far day A race of maidens pale and grey. Theirs shall be nor cross nor hood, Common rite nor convent roof, Bead nor bell shall put to proof A sister of that sisterhood; But by noonday or by night In her eyes there shall be light. And as a temple organ, set To its best stop by hands long gone, Gives new ears the olden tone And speaks the buried master yet, Her lightest accents have the key Of ancient love and victory. And, as some hind, whom his o'erthrown And dying king o'er hill and flood Sends laden with the fallen crown, Breathes the great trust into his blood Till all his conscious forehead wears The splendid secret that he bears, For ever, everywhere the same, Thro' every changing time and scene, In widow's weeds and lowly name She stands a bride, she moves a queen; The flowering land her footstep knows; The people bless her as she goes, Whether upon your sacred days She peers the mightiest and the best, Or whether, by the common ways, The babe leans from the peasant's breast, While humble eyelids proudly fill, And momentary Sabbaths still The hand that spins, the foot that delves, And all our sorrow and delight Behold the seraph of themselves In that pure face where woe grown bright Seems rapture chastened to the mild And equal light of smiles unsmiled. And if perchance some wandering king, Enamoured of her virgin reign, Should sue the hand whose only ring Is the last link of that first chain, Forged by no departed hours, and seen But in the daylight that hath been, She pauses ere her heart can speak, And, from below the source of tears, The girlhood to her faded cheek Goes slowly up thro' twenty years, And, like the shadow in her eyes, Slowly the living Past replies, In tones of such serene eclipse As if the voices of Death and Life Came married by her mortal lips To more than Life or Death—‘A wife Thou wooest; on yonder field he died Who lives in all the world beside.’ Oh, ye who, in the favouring smile Of Heaven, at one great stroke shall win The gleaming guerdons that beguile Glory's grey-haired Paladin Thro' all his threescore jousts and ten, —Love of women, and praise of men, The spurs, the bays, the palm, the crown,— Who, from your mountain-peak among Mountains, thenceforth may look along The shining tops of deeds undone, And take them thro' the level air As angels walk from star to star, We from our isle—the ripest spot Of the round green globe—where all The rays of God most kindly fall, And warm us to that temperate lot Of seasoned change that slowly brings Fruition to the orb of things, We from this calm in chaos, where Matter running into plan And Reason solid in a man Mediate the earth and air, See ye winging yon far gloom, Oh, ministering spirits! as some Blest soul above that, all too late, From his subaltern seat in heaven Looks round and measures fate with fate, And thro' the clouds below him driven Beholds from that calm world of bliss The toil and agony of this, And, warming with the scene rehearst, Bemoans the realms where all is won, And sees the last that shall be first, And spurns his secondary throne, And envies from his changeless sphere The life that strives and conquers here. But ere toward fields so old and new We leap from joys that shine in vain, And rain our passion down the blue Serene—once more—once more—to drain Life's dreadful ecstasy, and sell Our birthright for that oxymel Whose stab and unction still keep quick The wound for ever lost and found, Lo, o'erhead, a cherubic And legendary lyre, that round The eddying spaces turns a dream Of ancient war! And at the theme Harps to answering harps, on high, Call, recall, that but a strait Of storm divides our happy state From that pale sleepless Mystery Who pines to sit upon the throne He served ere falling to his own. LOVE. TO A LITTLE GIRL. (1862.) When we all lie still Where churchyard pines their funeral vigil keep, Thou shalt rise up early While the dews are deep; Thee the earliest bird shall rouse From thy maiden sleep, Thy white bed in the old house Where we all, in our day, Lived and loved so cheerly. And thou shalt take thy way Where the nodding daffodil Tells thee he is near; Where the lark above the corn Sings him to thine ear; Where thine own oak, fondly grim, Points to more than thou canst spy; And the beckoning beechen spray Beckons, beckons thee to him, Thee to him and him to thee; Him to thee, who, coy and slow, Stealest through dim paths untrod Step by step, with doubtful glance, Taking witness quick and shy Of each bud and herb and tree If thou doest well or no. Haste thee, haste thee, slow and coy! What! art doubting still, though even The white tree that shakes with fear When no other dreams of ill, The girl-tree whom best thou knowest, Waves the garlands of her joy, And, by something more than chance, Of all paths in one path only The primroses where thou goest Thicken to thy feet, as though Thou already wert in heaven And walking in the galaxy. Do those stars no longer glisten To thy steps, ah! shivering maid, That, where upper light doth fade At yon gnarled and twisted gate, Thou dost pause and tremble and so, Listening stir, and stirring listen? Not a blossom will illume That chill grove of cambering yew Wherein Night seems to vegetate, And, through bats and owls, a dew Of darkness fills the mortal gloom. Haste thee, haste thee, gaze not back! Of all hours since thou wert born, Now thou may'st not look forlorn; Though the blackening grove is dread, Shall he plead in vain who pled ‘To-morrow?’ Through the tree-gloom lonely One more shudder, and the track Softens: this is upland sod, Thou canst smell the mountain air, What was heavy overhead Lightens, the black whitens, the white brightens! Ah, dear and fair, Lo the dazzling east, and lo, Someone tall against the sky Coming. coming, like a god, In the rising morn! And when the lengthening days whose light we never saw Have melted his sweet awe, And thy fond fear is like a little hare, Large-eyed and passionately afraid, That peepeth from the covert of her rest Into the narrow glade Between two woods, and doth a moment dare The sunshine, and leap back; yet forth will fare Again, and each time ventures further from the nest, Till, having past the midst ere she be 'ware, Bold with fear to be so much confest She flees across the sun into the other shade; Flees as thou that didst so coyly draw Near him and nearer, and art trembling there Midway 'twixt giving all and nought, In a moment, at a thought, Bashful to panic, hidest on his breast; Once again beneath the hill Where round our graves these funeral pines refuse The clamorous morning, thou shalt rise up early When we all lie still. Thou shalt rise up early while Down the chimney, ample and deep, Dreaming swallows gurgle, and shrill In window-nook the mossy wren Chirps an answer cheerly, Chirps and sinks to sleep. In the crossed and corbelled bay Of that ivied oriel, thou Lovest at morn and eve to muse; But this once thou shalt not stay To mark the forming earth. and how Far and near, in equal grey Of growing dawn, thy well-known land Now to the strained gaze appears The nebulous umbrage of itself, and now, Ere one can say this or this, Divides upon the sense into the world that is, As the slow suffusion that doth fill Tender eyes with soft uncertainties, Suddenly, we know not when, Shapes to tears we understand; Such tears as blind thy eyes with light, When thou shalt rise up, white from white, In thy virgin bed On that morn, and, by and by, In thy bloom of maidenhead Beam softly o'er the shadowy floor, And softly down the ancient stairs, And softly through the ancestral door, And o'er the meadow by the house Where thy small feet shall not rouse From the grass those unrisen pray'rs, The skylarks, though thy passing smile Shall touch away the dews. And thou shalt take thy way, Ah whither? Where is the dear tryst to-day? Trembler, doth he wait for thee By the ash or the beech-tree? With the lightest earliest breeze The dodder in the hedge is quaking, But the mighty ash is still a-slumber; All its tender multiplicity Drooped with a common sleep, by twos and threes, That triple into companies, Which, in turn, do multiply Each by each into an all So various, so symmetrical, That the membered trunk on high Lifts a colour'd cloud that seems The numberless result of number. Now still as thy still sleep, soft as thy dreams, They slumber; but when morning bids The world awake, the giant sleeper, waking, Shall lift at once his shapely myriads up, As thou at once upliftest thy two lids. Ah, guileless eyes, from whom those lids unclose; Ah, happy, happy eyes! if morning's beams Awake the trees, how can they sleep in yours? Look up and see them start from their repose! Yet nay, I think thou wouldst forbid them hear What some one comes this morn to say; Therefore, sweet eyes, shine only on the ground, Nor venture to look round, Lest thou behold how subtly the flow'rs sigh Among the whispering grasses tall, And see thy secret pale the lily's cheeks, Or redden on the daisy's lips, Or tremble in the tremulous tear Wherewith the warmer light of day fulfils That frigid beauty of the wort whose stars Look, thro' the summer darkness, like the scars Of those lunar arrows shot From the white string of that silver bow Wherewith, as we all wot, Because it was a keepsake of her Greek, Diana shooteth still on every moony night. What is it, then, that this close buttercup Is shutting down into a golden shrine? What hath the wind betrayed to the wind-flow'r, That, on either side, it so adjures Thy passing beauty, by such votive hands Point to point with praying finger-tips? I know not how such secrets go astray, Nor how so dear a mystery Foreslipped the limits of its destined hour; Perhaps, the mustered spring, in whatsoe'er Deep cavern of the earth, ere it come here, It takes the flowery order of the year, Heard the soft powers speak of this loveliness That in due season should be done and said, As if it were a part o' the white and red Of summer; or perchance some zephyr, willing To sweeten the stol'n fragrance of a rose, Caught one of thy breaths, and blew it To the flow'rs that suck the evening air, And in it some unspoken words of thine Went thro' the floral beauty, and somewhere Therein came to themselves, and made the fields aware. Thus, or not thus, surely the cowslips knew it; Else wherefore did they press Their march to this sole day, and long ago Set their annual dances to it? This day of all the days that summer yields? Didst thou not mark how sure and slow They came upon thee with exact emprise? First a golden stranger, meek and lone, Then the vanward of a fairy host Following the nightingales, Bashful and bold, in sudden troops and bands, Takes the willowy depths of all the dales, And, on unsuspected nights, Makes vantage-ground of mounts and heights Till, ere one knew, a south wind blew, And a fond invasion holds the fields! Over the shadowy meadowy season, up and down from coast to coast, A pigmy folk, a yellow-haired people stands, Stands and hangs its head and smiles! And art thou conscious that they smile, and why? That with such palpitating flight Thou fleest toward the linden-aisles? Ah, yet a moment pause among The lime-trees, where, from the rich arches o'er thee, The nightingale still strews his falling song As if the trees were shaken and dropt sweetness; No heed? More speed? Ah, little feet, Is the ground soaked with music that ye beat Silver echoes thence, and keep Such quick time and dainty unison With the running cadence of the bird That he hath not heard A note to fright him or offend, While down the tell-tale path from end to end Such a ringing scale has run thro' his retreat? The limes are past, and ye speed on; Ah, little feet, so fond, so fleet, Fleeter than ever—why this fleetness? Who is this? a start, a cry! A blind moment of alarms, And the tryst is in his arms! Fluttering, fluttering heart, confess Truly, didst thou never guess That he would be here before thee? Didst thou never dream that ere The last glow-worm 'gan to dim, Or the dear day-star to burn, Or the elm-top rooks to talk, Or the hedge-row nests to threep, He was waiting for thee here? Ah! ne'er so fair, ah! ne'er so dear, For his love's sake pardon him, Smile on him again, and turn With him thro' the sweetbrier glade, With him thro' the woodbine shade; In the sweetbrier wilderness, To his side, ah! closer creep, In the honeysuckle walk Let him make thee blush and weep, While the wooing doves, unseen, Move the air with fond ado, And, lest the long morning shine Show you to some vulgar eye, To ye, passing side by side, With a grace that copies thine, Favouring trees their boughs incline; While, where'er ye wander by, Hawthorn and sweet eglantine From among their laughing leaves Stretch and pluck ye by the sleeves: And all flow'rs the hedge doth hide Sigh their fragrance after you; And sly airs, with soft caresses, Letting down thy golden tresses, Marry those dear locks with his; While from the rose-arch above thee, Where the bowery gate uncloses, Budded tendrils, lithe and green, Loosen on the wind and lean Each to each, and leaning kiss, Kiss and redden into roses. Oh, you Lovers, warm and living! And ah, our graves, so deep and chill! As ye stand in upper light Murmuring love that never dies, While your happy cheeks are burning, Will ye feel a distant yearning? Will a sudden dim surprise Lift up your happy eyes From what you are taking and giving, To where the pines their funeral vigil keep, And we all lie still? Love on, plight on, we cannot hear or see. Oh beautiful and young and happy! ye Have the rich earth's inheritance. For you, for you, the music and the dance That moves and plays for all who need it not, That moved and played for us, who, thus forgot, In the dark house where the heart cannot sing Nor any pulse mete its own joyous measure, See not the world, nor any pleasant thing; And ye, in your good time, have come into our pleasure. Ah, while the time is good, love on, plight on! Leap from yourselves into the light of gladness! The light, the light! surely the light is sweet? And, if descending from those ecstasies, Ye touch the common earth with wavering feet, Your life is at your will; whate'er betide, We shall not check or chide. The hand is dust that might restrain; The voice whose warning should distress ye By any augury of doubt or sadness, Can never speak again. The angel that so many woo in vain Descends, descends! Ah, seize him ere he soar; Ah, seize him by the skirt or by the wing; What matter, so that, like the saint of yore, Ye do not let him hence until he bless ye? In our youth we had our madness, In the grave ye may be wise. Love on, love on, for Love is all in all! Manners, that make us and are made of us, Who with the self-will of an infant king Do fashion them that have our fashioning, And make the shape of our correction; Virtue, that fruit whose substance ripens slow, And in one semblance having past from crude To sweet, rots slowly in the form of good; Joy, the involuntary light and glow Of this electric frame mysterious, That, radiant from our best activities, Complexion their fine colours by our own; And Duty, the sun-flower of knowledge,—these Change and may change with changing time and place: But Love is for no planet and no race. The summer of the heart is late or soon, The fever in the blood is less or more; But while the moons of time shall fill and wane, While there is earth below and heaven above, Wherever man is true and woman fair, Through all the circling cycles Love is Love! And when the stars have flower'd and fall'n away, And of this earthly ball A little dust upon eternity Is all that shall remain, Love shall be Love: in that transcendent whole Clear Nature from the swift euthanasy Of her last change, transfigured, shall arise; And we, whose wonted eyes Seek vainly the familiar universe, Shall feel the living worlds in the immortal soul. But nor of this, Nor anything of Love except its bliss, On that summer morning shalt thou know; Nor, in that moment's apotheosis When, like the sudden sun That, rising round and rayless, bursts in rays, And is himself and all the heavens in one, Love in the sun-burst of our own delight Makes us for an instant infinite, Owning no first or last, before or after, Child of Love, shalt thou divine That, years and years before thy day, In the little Arcady And planted Eden of thy line, On such mornings such a maid Lived and loved as thou art living and loving, Through the flowery fields where thou art roving, And in the favourite bowers and by the wonted ways, Stepped the morning music with thy grace; Smiled the sunshine which thou with her face Smilest; so, with sweeter voice, Helped the vernal birds rejoice, Or, when passing envy stayed Matins green and leafy virilays Startled her sole self to hear, Like a scared bird hushed for fear; Or, more frightened by my passionate praise, Rippled the golden silence with shy laughter. Yet I saw her standing there, While my happy love I made, Standing in her long fair hair, And looking (so thou lookest now) As when beneath an April bough In an April meadow, Light is netted into place By a lesser light of shadow;— Standing by that tree where he This morn of thine makes love to thee Leaning to his half-embrace, Leaning where, full well I know, While slow day grows ripe to noon Thou untired shalt still be leaning, Still, entranced by Love's beguiling, Listening, listening, smiling, smiling; Leaning by the tree—Ah me, Leaning on the name I cut In the bark which, while she tarried here, Chased it with duteous silver year by year; But from the hour that heard her coffin shut Blindly closed over the withered meaning, Till argent vert and verdant argentrie Encharged each simple letter to a rune. Ah me, ah me! the very name To which—another yet the same— (The same, since all thy loveliness is she, Another, since thou dost forget me)— Thou answerest, as she answered me When on summer morns she met me, While the dews were deep,— She whom earliest bird did rouse From her maiden sleep, From her bed in the old house, Her white bed in the old house,— She whom bird arouseth never From that sleep upon the hill Where we all lie still. For what is, was, will be. Suns rise and set And rise: year after year, as when we met, In one brief season the epiphany Of perfect life is shown, and is withdrawn; As maidens bloom and die: but Maidenhood for ever Walks the eternal Spring in everlasting Dawn. AN AUTUMN MOOD. (1863.) Pile the pyre, light the fire—there is fuel enough and to spare; You have fire enough and to spare with your madness and gladness; Burn the old year—it is dead, and dead, and done. There is something under the sun that I cannot bear: I cannot bear this sadness under the sun, I cannot bear this sun upon all this sadness. Here on this prophecy, here on this leafless log, Log upon log, and leafless on leafless, I sit. Yes, Beauty, I see thee; yes, I see, but I will not rejoice. Down, down, wild heart! down, down, thou hungry dog That dost but leap and gaze with a want thou canst not utter! Down, down! I know the ill, but where is the cure? Moor and stubble and mist, stubble and mist and moor, Here, on the turf that will feel the snows, a vanishing flutter Of bells that are ringing farewells, And overhead, from a branch that will soon be bare, Is it a falling leaf that disturbs my blood like a voice? Or is it an autumn bird that answers the evening light? The evening light on stubble and moor and mist, And pallid woods, and the pale sweet hamlets of dying men. Oh, autumn bird! I also will speak as I list. Oh, woods! oh, fields! oh, trees! oh, hill and glen! You who have seen my glory, you who wist How I have walked the mornings of delight— Myself a morning, summer'd through and lit With light and summer as the sunny dew With sun: you saw me then— You see me now; oh, hear my heart and answer it. Where is the Nevermore and the land of the Yesterdays? Aye, Where are Youth and Joy, the dew and the honey-dew, The day of the rose, and the night of the nightingale? Where— Where are the sights and the sounds that shall ne'er and shall e'er Come again? Once more I have cried my cry, once more in vain I have listen'd; once more, for a moment, the ancient pain Is less, though I know that the year is dead and done. Once more I bear Under the sun the sadness, over the sadness the sun. Bear? I have borne, I shall bear. But what is a man That his soul should be seen and heard in the trees and flow'rs of the field? Have I tinctured them mortal? or doth their mortality yield Me like a fragrance of autumn? Ah! passion of Eve, Ah! Eve of my passion,—which is it that aches to complain? Oh, old old Minstrelsy, oh, wafty winds of Romaunt, Blow me your harps. My sick soul cannot weave These gossamers of feeling that remain To any string whereon its ill may grieve. Blow me your harps—harp, wind-harp, dulcimer, Citerne, bataunt, And mandolin, and each string'd woe Of the sweet olden world, and let them blow By me, as in sea-streams the sea-gods see The streaming, streaming hair Of drownèd girls, and every sorrowy sin O' the sea. And so let them blow out the din Of daylight, and blow in, With legendary song Of buried maids, The evening shades. And when the thronging harps, and all The murmurings of wild wind-harps, Are still; And shimmer of dim dulcimer, And thrill of trill'd citerne, And plaint of quaint bataunt, and throb of long Long silent mandolin, And every other sound that grieves, Hath dropt into its colour on the leaves, In the silence let me hear The round and heavy tear Of orchards fall. And as I listen let the air unseen Be stirr'd with words; Let the ripe husk of what is gape open and shed What has been; Through click of gates and the games Of the living village at play, Let me hear forgotten names Of ancient day. Down like a drop of rain from the evening sky Let somewhat be said; Up from the pool, like a bubble, let something reply, In the tongue of the dead. Through the swallows that fly their last Round the grey spire of the past, In the faded elms by the height, Let the last hour of light Strike, and the yellow chimes Forget and remember A dream of other times. And above let the rocks be warm with the mystical day that is not To-day or to-morrow; And from the nest in the rock let me hear the croon Of orphan-doves that yearn For the wings that will never return. And below the rocks, on the grassy slopes and scarps, Let the tender flowering flame of the exquisite crocus of sorrow Sadden the green of the grass to the pathos of gentle September. And below the slopes and scarps, where the strangled rill Blackens to rot, Let the unrest of the troublous hour Blossom on through the night, and the running flow'r O' the fatuous fire flicker, and flicker, and flare, Through the aimless dark of disaster, the aimless light of despair. And meantime, let the serious evening star Contemplative, enlarge her slow pale-brow'd Regard, until she shake With tears, and sudden, snatch a hasty cloud To hide whate'er in those pure realms afar Is likest human sadness: and, full-soon, Let night begin to slake The west; and many-headed darkness peer From every copse and brake; While from a cottage nigh, Where the poor candle of dull Poverty May barely serve to show Her stony privilege of woe, Or if, like her, it try To leave the cabin'd precincts of its lot, Steals trembling forth to struggle and expire; A milkless babe that shall not see the morn Starves to the fretted ear, With lullaby and lullaby, And rocking shadow to and fro Athwart the lattice low; And from yon western ridge, black as the bier Of day, let a faint, far-off horn, Mourning across the ravish'd fields forlorn, Sound like a streak of sunset seen through the grief of the moon. And, further yet, from the slant of the seaward plain, The bleating and lowing of many-voicèd flocks and herds, Forced from their fields, mix on the morning breeze With sob of seas, Till the long-rising wind be high, And, from the distant main, A gale sweep up the vale, and on the gale a wail Of shipwreck fill and fail, Fail and fill, fill and fail, like a sinking, sinking sail In the rain! But ere all this to us let the dim smoke rise! To us from the nearest field, from the nearest pyre Of stubbled corn, let the dim smoke rise; and let The fire that loosens the stubble corn Loose the soul like smoke, and let tears in the eyes Confuse the passionate sense till the heart forget Whether we be the world, or whether the fading world be We. SONNETS AND OTHER SHORT POEMS. (Several among these existed only in MSS. and had not received the writer's finishing work.) TWO EPIGRAMS. I. ON A PORTRAIT PRESENTED TO J. Y. SIMPSON, M.D. (AFTERWARDS SIR JAMES SIMPSON). Unto myself my better self you gave. I give yourself yourself: but ah, my friend, In how inverse a ratio! To amend The unjust return these thanks are all I have, Except a sigh, when that poor ‘all’ is o'er, To feel, alas, no less your debtor than before. II. ON THE DEATH OF EDWARD FORBES. Nature, a jealous mistress, laid him low. He woo'd and won her; and, by love made bold, She showed him more than mortal man should know, Then slew him lest her secret should be told. ON A RECENTLY FINISHED STATUE. 1854. Said Sculptor to immaculate marble—‘Show Thine essence; into necessary space Most pure describe thine unshaped Purity!’ And lo this Image! As a bubble blown, Swiftly her charms, dilating, went through all The zones of sphered Perfection, till the stone Smiled as to speak. Some coming thought half-shown Forms on her parting lips, so that her face Is as a white flow'r whence a drop of dew, White with the fragrant flow'r, inclines to fall. ‘Oh Everlasting Silence keep her so! Immortalise this moment, lest she grow To such a living substance as can die!’ He cried. Consent Eternal heard his cry. THE CONVALESCENT TO HER PHYSICIAN. Friend, by whose cancelling hand did Fate forgive Her debtor, and rescribe her stern award, Oh with that happier light wherein I live May all thine after, years be sunned and starred! May God, to Whom my daily bliss I give In tribute, add it to thy day's reward, And mine uncurrent joy may'st thou receive Celestial sterling! Aye and thou shalt thrive Even by my vanished woes: for as the sea Renders its griefs to Heaven, which fall in rains Of sweeter plenty on the happy plains, So have my tears exhaled; and may it be That from the favouring skies my lifted pains Descend, oh friend, in blessings upon thee! SAMUEL BROWN. (Died, on September 20, 1856, at Morningside, near Edinburgh, Dr. Samuel Brown, well known and dear to the fit and few throughout England and Scotland. He was struck with mortal illness when on the eve of completing the scientific labours to which his splendid talents had been devoted; and, after eight painful years of patient and unconquered hope, was obliged to leave the demonstration of his discoveries to the good fortune of future times.) He came with us to thy great gates, oh Thou Unopened Age. Our noise was like the wind Chafing the wordy Deep; but broad and blind They stood unmoved. Then He,—we knew not how,— Laid forth his hand upon them. Lo, they grind Revolving thunders! Lo, on his dark brow The unknown light! Lo Azrael came behind And touched him. They clanged back, and all was Now. We wondered and forgot; but He, unbent, With eye still strained to the forbidden day, Towered in the likeness of his great intent As if his act should be his monument, Till Azrael pitied such sublime dismay, And led him onward by another way. TO PROFESSOR AND MRS. J. S. BLACKIE. If Time that feeds love dies to die no more, Immortal hours, dear friends, were yours and mine; For Morn that on the hills oped eyes divine, And Eve that walked like Mary by the shore Where that old Dreamer, as he built, of yore, Saw her, and told his dream in such a shrine (1) Tintern Abbey, dedicated to the Virgin. As was a kind of Mary, and the shine Of Noon, and starry censers swinging o'er With Night, all made ye dearer: thou whose soul, Palimpsest of a dead and living world, Taketh no dust from that nor stain from this, And thou who with thyself hast so empearled The writing—knowing well how rare it is— That the scrolled jewels and the jewelled scroll In total more than both complete a married whole. TO THE AUTHORESS OF ‘AURORA LEIGH.’ Were Shakspeare born a twin, his lunar twin (Not of the golden but the silver bow) Should be like thee: so, with such eyes and brow, Sweeten his looks, so, with her dear sex in His voice, (a king's words writ out by the queen,) Unman his bearded English, and, with flow Of breastfull robes about her female snow, Present the lordly brother. Oh Last-of-kin, There be ambitious women here on earth Who will not thank thee to have sung so well! Apollo and Diana are one birth, Pollux and Helen break a single shell. Who now may hope? While Adam was alone Eve was to come. She came; God's work was done. TO MRS. J. S. BLACKIE. Dear Friend, once, in a dream, I, looking o'er The Past, saw the Four Seasons slow advance Dancing, and, dancing, each her cognizance So gave and took that neither dancer bore Her sign, but in another's symbol wore An amulet to lessen or enhance Herself: till as they fast and faster dance I see a dance and lose the dancing four. Thus thy dear Poet, at his sportive will, Commingling every seasonable mood Of old and young, and the peculiar ill Of each still healing with the other's good, Bends to a circle life's proverbial span Where childhood, youth, and age are unity in man. DEDICATORY. Beauty is One. But that so equal gold, Run in the apt and kindly difference Of each receptive and significant sense, Configures to our many-minded mould. Therefore, oh Love, though I no more behold That sometime world where summer eloquence I saw and spake, (adding nor time nor tense, But singing forth the silent music old), Yet walled in winter cities still sing I; For conscious of thy beauty mere and whole, The perfect unit of thy face and soul (Thy face thy soul confest to mortal eye, Thy soul thy face by new perceptions known), Thy One becomes my Many. Take thine own. SISTER TO SISTER, ON RECEIVING A PORTRAIT IN A LOCKET. ‘When I received that love which is a face, When I perceived that face which is a love, Two voices, like those two old nations, strove Within my heart, and the first-born gave place And served the younger. “Ah this golden space Doth cage the airy pinions of my dove! And ah this value, which might prove and more Another love, seems simony to the grace Of ours!” Thus while one passion doth protest, The other cries: “I care not how it be! For, givest thou much or little, worst or best, Nor am I richer nor thou dispossest; My fond subtraction is still thine in me, And all thy dear remainder mine in thee!”’ ON THE DEATH OF MRS. BROWNING. Which of the Angels sang so well in Heaven That the approving Archon of the quire Cried, ‘Come up hither!’ and he, going higher, Carried a note out of the choral seven; Whereat that cherub to whom choice is given Among the singers that on earth aspire Beckoned thee from us, and thou, and thy lyre Sudden ascended out of sight? Yet even In Heaven thou weepest! Well, true wife, to weep! Thy voice doth so betray that sweet offence That no new call should more exalt thee hence But for thy harp. Ah lend it, and such grace Shall still advance thy neighbour that thou keep Thy seat, and at thy side a vacant place. TWO SONNETS ON THE DEATH OF PRINCE ALBERT. I. [In a great house by the wide Sea I sat] In a great house by the wide Sea I sat, And down slow fleets and waves that never cease Looked back to the first keels of War and Peace; I saw the Ark, what time the shoreless flat Began to rock to rising Ararat; Or Argo, surging home, with templed Greece To leeward, while, mast-high, the lurching fleece Swung morn from deep to deep. Then in a plat Of tamarisk a bird called me. When again My soul looked forth I ponder'd not the main Of waters but of time; and from our fast Sure Now, with Pagan joy, beheld the pain Of tossing heroes on the triremed Past Obtest the festive Gods and silent stars in vain. II. [And as I mused on all we call our own] And as I mused on all we call our own, And (in the words their passionate hope had taught Expressing this late world for which they fought And prayed) said, lifting up my head to the sun, ‘Ne quibus diis immortalibus,’—one Ran with fear's feet, and lo! a voice distraught ‘The Prince’ and ‘Dead.’ And at the sound methought The bulwark of my great house thunder'd down. And, for an instant,—as some spell were sapping All place—the hilly billows and billowy hills Heaved through my breast the lapping wave that kills The heart; around me the floor rises and falls And jabbling stones of the unsteady walls Ebb and flow together, lapping, lapping. TO 1862. (IN PROSPECT OF WAR WITH AMERICA.) I Oh worst of years, by what signs shall we know So dire an advent? Let thy New-Year's-day Be night. At the east gate let the sun lay His crown: as thro' a temple hung with woe Unkinged by mortal sorrow let him go Down the black noon, whose wan astrology Peoples the skyey windows with dismay, To that dark charnel in the west where lo! The mobled Moon! For so, at the dread van Of wars like ours, the great humanity In things not human should be wrought and wrung Into our sight, and creatures without tongue By the dumb passion of a visible cry Confess the coming agony of Man. II. Even now, this spring in winter, like some young Fair Babe of Empire, ere his birth-bells ring, Shewn to the people by a hoary King, Stirs me with omens. What fine shock hath sprung The fairy mines of buried life among The clods? Above spring flow'rs a bird of spring Makes February of the winds that sing Yule-chants: while March, thro' Christmas brows, rimehung, Looks violets: and on yon grave-like knoll A girlish season sheds her April soul. Ah is this day that strains the exquisite Strung sense to finer fibres of delight An aimless sport of Time? Or do its show'rs, Smiles, birds and blooms betray the heart of conscious Pow'rs? III. Methinks the innumerable eyes of ours That must untimely close in endless night Take in one sum their natural due of light: Feather'd like summer birds their unlived hours Sing to them: at their prison pitying flow'rs Push thro' the bars a Future red and white, Purple and gold: for them, for them, yon bright Star, as an eye, exstils and fills, and pours Its tear, and fills and weeps, to fill and weep: For them that Moon from her wild couch on high Now stretches arms that wooed Endymion, Now swooning back against the sky stares down Like some white mask of ancient tragedy With orbless lids that neither wake nor sleep. IV. Hark! a far gun, like all war's guns in one, Booms. At that sign, from the new monument Of him who held the plough whereto he bent His royal sword, and meekly laboured on, Till when the verdict of mankind had gone Against our peace, he, waiving our consent, Carried the appeal to higher courts, and went Himself to plead—She whom he loved and won, The Queen of Earth and Sea,—her unrisen head Bowed in a sorrowy cloud—takes her slow way To her great throne, and, lifting up her day Upon her land, and to that flag unfurl'd Where wave the honour and the chastity Of all our men and maidens living and dead, Points westward, and thus breaks the silence of the world:— V.(A QUEEN'S SPEECH.) ‘Since it is War, my England, and nor I On you nor you on me have drawn down one Drop of this bloody guilt, God's Will be done, Here upon earth in woe, in bliss on high! Peace is but mortal and to live must die, And, like that other creature of the sun, Must die in fire. Therefore, my English, on! And burn it young again with victory! For me, in all your joys I have been first And in this woe my place I still shall keep, I am the earliest widow that must weep, My children the first orphans. The divine Event of all God knows: but come the worst It cannot leave your homes more dark than mine.’ TO TÖCHTERCHEN, ON HER BIRTHDAY. As one doth touch a flower wherein the dew Trembles to fall, as one unplaits the ply Of morning gossamer, so tenderly My spirit touches thine. Yet, daughter true And fair, great Launcelot's mighty nerve and thew Best clove a king or caught a butterfly, (Since each extreme is perfect mastery —Accurate cause repaid in the fine due Of just effect—) and, child, it should be so With Love. The same that nicely plundereth The honeyed zephyrs for thy cates and wine Should train thee with the tasks of toil and woe, Or hold thee against adverse life and death, Or give thee from my breast to dearer arms than mine. TO THE SAME. Töchterchenlein, by whom the least became The greatest title of dear Daughterhood, Who hast not laid down life, nor spilled thy blood For me, but throbbed them thro' the living frame Of duteous days less different than the same, Yet not too much the same to be construed In number, that still multiplied thy good, And, by the figure of a changing name For changeless love, helped my weak utterance Of thy desert; as step by step we climb A height, or by a thousand measure one: I verse this Poetry which thou hast done, As he who gazing on a rhythmic dance Finds even his common speech a little keep the time. TO A FRIEND IN BEREAVEMENT. No comfort, nay, no comfort. Yet would I In Sorrow's cause with Sorrow intercede. Burst not the great heart,—this is all I plead— Ah sentence it to suffer, not to die. ‘Comfort?’ If Jesus wept at Bethany, —That doze and nap of Death—how may we bleed Who watch the long sleep that is sleep indeed! Pointing to Heaven I but remind you why On earth you still must mourn. He who, being bold For life-to-come, is false to the past sweet Of Mortal life, hath killed the world above. For why to live again if not to meet? And why to meet if not to meet in love? And why in love if not in that dear love of old? AT THE GRAVE OF A SPANISH FRIEND. Here lies who of two mighty realms was free; The English-Spaniard, who lived England's good With such a Spain of splendour in the blood As, flaming through our cold utility, Fired the north oak to the Hesperian tree, And flower'd and fruited the unyielding wood That stems the storms and seas. Equal he stood Between us, and so fell. Twice happy he On earth: and surely in new Paradise, Ere we have learn'd the phrase of those abodes, Twice happy he whom earthly use has given, Of all the tongues our long confusion tries, That noblest twain wherein the listening gods Patient discern the primal speech of Heaven. TO AN AMERICAN EMBASSY. (WRITTEN AT FLORENCE, 1866.) Since Sovereign Nature, at the happy best, Is rightful and sole paragon of Art, Who, tho' she but in part, and part by part, Paints, carves, or sings the whole, is still possest By thee, all thee, oh somewhere unconfest Apollo! in the worlds of men who art A man, and, with a human body and heart, Lookest her visible truths, and livest the rest; Surely that strategy was well design'd Which, laying siege to Art's proud Capital, Armed not, against her matchless pow'rs-that-be, Music, Painting, Sculpture, Poetry, But sent a living womanhood of all To queen, by their own laws, the masters of mankind. JOHN BOHUN MARTIN. (CAPTAIN OF ‘THE LONDON’.) Keeping his word, the promised Roman kept Enough of worded breath to live till now. Our Regulus was free of plighted vow Or tacit debt: skies fell, seas leapt, storms swept; Death yawned: with a mere step he might have stept To life. But the House-master would know how To do the master's honours; and did know, And did them to the hour of rest, and slept The last of all his house. Oh, thou heart's-core Of Truth, how will the nations sentence thee? Hark! as loud Europe cries ‘Could man do more?’ Great England lifts her head from her distress, And answers ‘But could Englishman do less?’ Ah England! goddess of the years to be! Florence: February, 1866. DEPRECATING A GIFT. (OF SOMETHING MADE BY THE GIVER.) Child, your effectual hands create too much. The things they fashion having, thenceforth, less The type of matter than the preciousness Of you, how can I serve myself of such? The kindred in my being doth avouch Your essence; in the very press and stress Of action I am foiled to a caress. Ah! give me something you but meant to touch! Something your love has ripen'd till I'm 'ware Of thoughts that came in light and stay'd in sweet, Or th' apostolic shadow of your care, Passing by, hath healed of malady, Or wholed in use and grace: gifts rare and meet, But not too rarely yours to be for me Still meet, nor meetly mine to be still yours and rare. PERHAPS. Ten heads and twenty hearts! so that this me, Having more room and verge, and striking less The cage that galls us into consciousness, Might drown the rings and ripples of to be In the smooth deep of being: plenary Round hours; great days, as if two days should press Together, and their wine-press'd night accresce The next night to so dead a parody Of death as cures such living: of these ordain My years; of those large years grant me not seven, Nor seventy, no, nor only seventy sevens! And then, perhaps, I might stand well in even This rain of things; down-rain, up-rain, side-rain; This rain from Earth and Ocean, air and heaven, And from the Heaven within the Heaven of Heavens. TO JAMES H. Without Life's toil to win Life's earthly prize What was thy mystery, oh, early Dead? The careless world but counted thy young head Among the multifarious heads that rise And sink, forgot. For thee, no watching eyes Starred darkness; no torch led thee to the bed Of clay. Yet (if the Apostle justly said Of all oblation) who or lives or dies So well as to achieve a fairer fame Than henceforth should be thine, oh, unknown youth, Since on your votive marble, for once, Truth Indites an Epitaph, and, 'neath thy name, Transcends all laudatory verse in one, ‘To him John Hunter raised this tributary stone.’ ON READING A DICTATED LETTER. Dear Friend, methinks when thus thy plenary soul Speaks from yon pale default that lies so low, The hale and stalwart by thy couch must know Such fond intoleration to be whole As he, who, where the storms of battle roll, Himself unthrown beholds the cannon throw His father at his feet, and, while a woe Of splendid shame dements him to that sole Passion, above the fallen field looks round The red conversion of the baptized ground For aught whereon to spend his sanguine wealth And, seeking not the value but the cost, Rushes to win whatever, won or lost, May end this gross unwounded infamy of health. UNDER ESPECIAL BLESSINGS. (AUGUST 1869.) Lord Christ, Lord Christ, ah for a little space Turn hence. Some day, when I again am low In the new dust of whatsoever blow Time hath in license, from Thy perfect place Oh let the awful solace of thy face Sun me, but not now! Lord, Thou seest me! How Can I, o'erborne by what Thy hands bestow, Bear what Thine eyes? Now, therefore, of Thy grace I ask but that if ever, as of yore, Thou lookest up and sigh'st, my kneeling thought May kiss Thy skirt, and Thou, who know'st if aught Touch Thee, mayst know, and through Thee, what no more Is I, but, ne'ertheless, began in me, May rise to Him Whom no man hath seen, nor can see. ON RECEIVING A BOOK FROM ‘X. H.’ Oh, great-eyed contemplation whom I saw Walk by the blue shores of the Northern Sea Leaning upon a giant, who for thee Seemed gentle, while black Night far west did gnaw The jagged Eve, and, near, the flapping caw Round Beatoun's shadowy Tower croaked down on me More than the gloom of Night: ere thou couldst see Beyond the inhuman ruin, or withdraw Thy soul from eyes, which, as one tune can fill Two voices, made the pathos of that soul A double passion, standing dim and still I saw and wondered. Is this book thy scroll, Ah Sybil? Hast thou writ the unheard cry I saw thee look that eve to Eartn and Sea and Sky? TO JAMES Y. SIMPSON. Who, after inestimable benefits to mankind, died in mid-hope of new achievements. Oh teeming heart, that, for this once, in vain Big with our good, didst undeliver'd die, Had some god got thee with a progeny O'er-great, that, born, might even dispute the reign Of Death, as Death had seen the realms of Pain Won by thine elder brood? We marvell'd why, So seeming-careless of his sovereignty, He spared and spared thee: doth this day explain The Fabian greed that grudged a needless blow? Knowing too well what deity possest Thee, did the dead-eyed strategist foreknow How the huge god must choke the mortal breast? The mortal breast, deep under clod and sod, Out of the half-saved world drag down the abortive god? ON RECEIVING A BOOK FROM DANTE ROSSETTI. Since he is Poet of whom gods ordain Some most anthropic and perhuman act Whereby his manhood shall so man his fact That but his man of man is born again, And since humanity is most humane, Not at our pyramid's base, where we have tact Of dust and supersurge the common tract Of being, but up there, where form doth reign To apex, let a Poet ask no fame But that which, high o'er floods of Life and Death From singing arks Ararat echoeth To Ararat, and let him rather be, Oh Poet, writ on yonder page by thee Than hear what vulgar breath should make his world-wide name. THREE SONNETS ON LOVE AND BEAUTY. I. TO A PROMESSA SPOSA. Look on this flower, which, from its little tree Of bodily stem and branches and leaves green, Leans lovelier, being toucht, and smelt, and seen A Rose, a Rose, a Rose! and, though thy three Senses praise it triply unto thee, And all their parlous difference intervene, Yet unto thee, who knowest what they mean, Thee who art one, and hast been, and shalt be, Is one as thou; one Rose, one beauteous Rose, One rosy Beauty. Who shall reason why The slow stem, on a sudden season, shows It can be worm unto this butterfly? We know but this, that when yon ecstasy Transfigures the green tree, its time of fruit is nigh. II. TO THE SAME. Oh Soul! that this fair flower dost so mirrour, Ask of thyself, saying—‘Soul beautiful, Oh Soul-in-love, oh happy, happy Soul, That wert so dull and poor, and this sweet hour Art so more floral even than a flower, That in thee it is better'd to a full, Whereto each former rose is poor and dull, Ah, what doth thus enlarge thee and empower, That thou who, at thy most, wert a priesthood, A vassal strength, a bliss feudàtory, Hast grown a final joy, an absolute good, A god that, for being god, believest in God The more?’ Thou canst not clear this mystery, Ah happy, happy soul, whose fruit of life is nigh. III. TO A FAIR WOMAN, UNSATISFIED WITH WOMAN'S WORK. If Beauty is a name for visible Love, And Love for Beauty in the conscious soul, Which when commoving to its highest whole, Or making that whole part of wholes above Itself, feels, like an eye, that it doth move, But cannot see the motion visible To others and in others; if the sole Difference is ours who see the spirit a dove, Or feel the dove a spirit; and if in All worlds Love, Love, as song and text allege, Sums the full good of life, who shall not bow To Beauty? Thou, born in her shrine, if thou Shouldst dare profane her, what would be thy sin? The sacrilegious priest does more than sacrilege. TO THE TIBER. On its late (in 1871) Inundation of Rome. Well done, old Flood, that, hiding a clear eye Beneath thy yellow veil, dost wend among Those epic hills and dales of seven-topp'd song, To keep watch on the stone eternity Whereof the mortal tenants die and die; One more is gone, the deadliest of the long Line, the foul vast of whose unmeasured wrong Twined to its summit in the triple Lie Of that thrice-cursèd Crown. And thou, brave flood, Enterest a thousand years of carrion To swill away the deeps of dung and blood, And drown the garbaged tribes that stank thereon, That so, at least, the new investiture Be on clean threshold and a hearth-stone pure. [Where are you, Poets, that a Hero dies] Where are you, Poets, that a Hero dies Unsung? He who, when Duty brought too soon His billet of rest toiled on till he had won The countersign of Glory? There he lies, And in the silence of your poesies He looks a Poem; yea, so made and done As if the Bardic Heavens had thrown him down In model to your making. Close his eyes, That yours may learn him. To fulfil the Law In Gospel, force the seeds of use to flower In Beauty, to enman invisible Truth And then transfigure—this is Poetry. And this the World and his dear Country saw Hymned unawares in that unconquer'd youth Who, scorning to give less than all his power, Having bled for us, then aspired to die; And, dying thus, left one more pledge behind That England may again deserve to lead Mankind. ENGLAND'S DAY: A WAR-SAGA. COMMENDED TO GORTSCHAKOFF. GRANT, AND BISMARCK; AND DEDICATED TO THE BRITISH NAVY. 1871. Russian, Yankee, and Prussian, Wherever you be, That stand by the shores of our sea And shake your fists over, This is the Castle of Dover, You knaves! And yon's the flag unfurl'd, That shall flog you over the waves Of the world. Ay, by the shores of our sea, You knaves! For wherever the breeze blows free, And the hurling, swirling, up and down deeps go thundering under and over, There the sea is our sea, And there's a Castle of Dover, Which carries a flag unfurl'd That shall flog you off the waves Of the world. What are you trying to say, You knaves? Whatever it be, it so maddens the waves That not a word comes this way. Speak up! you've no need to be shy, This is the land of charity, Where we never regret the labours We spend for the sake of our neighbours: So no more thrimming and thrumming, But mention whatever you want; And if you can show us 'tis good for you, We're just the People to grant. Should you like, for instance, a drubbing or two? We'll take neither fees nor thanks, But do you the very best we can do: Ay! and do it aboard your own planks, And ask you nothing for coming! Louder, my boy, ahoy! Why what the fiends can you say That makes such mountainous weather? You look to be talking loud, But I hear you no more than I see a feather That a cyclone spouts to a cloud. If you've got any breath, don't save it. Well done! once more! I have it— ‘England’—that's good for one's ears— ‘England’—all right! and three cheers— But unless that voice of your own Can hoist up higher, I'm blest If I'll catch a word of the rest! For you no sooner open your jaws Than there roars such a vast sea-shout That I hear you no more than I'd hear the daws If Dover cliffs tumbled down. Now then, there's a lull, sing out! Yo hoy! that's better. Soho! I've got it! ‘England’—Yes—No— ‘Has had her day.’ Oh, that's your say— ‘England has had her day!’ O ye who bear, on every sea, That flag of flags, so often sung, Whose name, in every human tongue, Is t'other word for Victory, That banner of eternal youth Your sires and grandsires, great and good, Have colour'd with their mortal blood And cross'd with their immortal truth, A cheer, a cheer, and you shall hear News that's worth a British cheer. Do you see yon braggarts three, Like three swash-bucklers in a play? They've found it out for you and me, So 'twon't be civil to say Nay. And verse one of chapter A In this great discovery Is ‘England’—what? ay, wait for that And while you wait, my hearts, haul down Your wind-blown pageant of renown,— Yon glorious weed whose bayonets The grasping tyrant ne'er forgets,— Yon harp whose throbbing chords can beat All sounds of battle but retreat,— And let the keeper's hand lay low The lions that ne'er fell to foe;— Reef, reef the flapping toy away, England, my hearts,—has had her day! Now, true-blues, you've heard the news, Hip hip hip, hurrah? Not hip hip hip, hurrah, my boys, But hip hip hip, aha! From decks to shrouds, from shrouds to clouds, Hip hip hip, aha! The stays are taut, the sails are caught, With ha, ha, ha, ha, ha! Like woods at play, the big masts sway, With ha, ha, ha, ha, ha! The big ships ride from side to side, With ha, ha, ha, ha, ha! The north waves roll from pole to pole, Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha! From pole to pole the south winds troll, Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha! From air to sea, from sea to air, The cross-clang clamours everywhere, Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha! From Baffin Bay, by Matapan, Round Hindostan, and far Japan, Back, back, to where it first began, Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha! Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, my boys, Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha! The very globe shakes like a man, With ha, ha, ha, ha! Russians, Yankees, Prussians, all you Who stand there scowling at Dover, ‘England has had her day’—is that your cry? Flood and earthquake! it's our cry too! Had it, had it, a thousand times over! Yea, and as sure as sky is sky, And sea is sea, and shore is shore, You shall see England have one day more! And such a day shall England have, That a thousand cities over the wave Shall wring their bitter hands and say, ‘England, England, has had her day!’ Some of us, when that day is done, You knaves! Shall go down with the battle sun In the battle waves. But as day by day The sun goes round Where'er yon flag's unfurled, And still through dews of morn Comes back to find Britannia crown'd, And tell her of her world, So sure with morrow At sweet sunrise, Like mourn of horn, Like roll of drum, Like boom of gun, Like swell of bells, Our name and our fame Thro' England's tears shall come Up the skies! And, putting by the shades From early window-pane Of castled palace or white-cottaged lane, Pass without rebuke, And look On what the sun sees: Little children on their knees, And pale dishevelled maids, And ancient sires whose sorrow is not sorrow, And mother sitting by the bed, Where, years ago, was born The face she shall not see again, Who bows the passionate winter of the head And sobs Amen. And some of us shall come In triumph home Beneath yon flag unfurl'd! Over the foam, over the foam, Conquerors, conquerors, conquerors home. Joyously sailing the lightsomest foam That the gayest of gales ever curl'd. On, on, over ocean and ocean, To the goal of the patriot's devotion, Once more, with heaving heart, to see The Native-land of all the free, The Mother-earth of Liberty, The sacred soil that bears the tree That sowed the world. On, on, over ocean and ocean, On, on, by shores that gaze and wonder, Shores where friendly cities shout, Shores where frantic foes blaze out Their paffing wrath in vain. On, on, like gods on living thrones of thunder, Heclas and Ætnas smoking thro' the main: On, on, like kings and kings, In wingèd towns and tow'rs with wings; On, on, town after town, And, in their train, Up ocean hill and down hollow, Horn'd Leviathans that mount and wallow, And all The jubilant Elephant-herd of the sea, That roar and roll and follow Where the sea-shepherds call. But some of those who come In glory home That day, Shall envy us who sleep In the Deep, Far away! When they see the eyes that weep, When they hear the lips that pray, Because we sleep Far away! Millions and millions of eyes that weep, Millions of lips that cry To God that day, Because we sleep Far away!— Thousands and thousands of eyes that are dry As they never were dry till that day, Because we sleep Far away!— Thousands of lips that shall keep Silence to God and Man that day,— Silence, silence, deep,— Deep, deep as the Deep Where we sleep Far away! FRAGMENTS. THE OLIVE. I have heard a friar say That the Olive learned to pray In Gethsemane,— A holy man was he, Jacopo by name,— All upon his bended knees From Jerusalem He crossed Kedron brook And to the garden came Of Gethsemane, And the very olive-trees Are there to this day. And I would have you know, For I loved to hear him speak, Good Friar Jacopo!— That on an Easter-week, In the time long ago Of bloody Pilate ‘King of Rome,’ (1) Often, as doubtless the reader will remember, so called in old ballads and carols. Lord Jesus To the garden-gate did come Of Gethsemane. And as He came at the dear look O' the Lord a sudden shudder shook The wood, and wooden moans and groans Allowed the silence of the stones. (The stones that next day, as 'tis said, Oped their mouths and spake the dead.) And when He bent His sacred knees The shame of limbs that could not bend Suppled every bough's end To a lythe And pliant wythe. But ere He spake a-silent stood Every tree in all the wood, And the silence began to fill Inly, as the ears with blood When the outer world is still. And when He spake at the first ‘Let this cup’ did somewhat swell Every twig and tip asunder, Like the silence in the head When the veins are nigh to burst; And at the second was nothing seer To stir, but all the swollen green Blackened as a cloud with thunder; But in the final agony, When His anguish brake its bands And the bloody sweat down-fell, At the third ‘Let this cup’ As He lifted up His hands Black drops fell from every tree And all the forest lifted up. The Lord went to Calvary— Well, perhaps, for you and me, Brother, who being men are fain To profit by the blessed loss That quivers overhead while we At the foot of the cross-mast With the hereditary face Reckon up our selfish gain, Rend his sacred weeds and cast Lots for the vesture of His grace,— Aye, at the dabbled foot of the Cross While that dear blood doth flow. The Olive cannot chaffer so, Not being a man, altho' Since the pallors of that hour It hath kept a human power And is not quite a tree; Now and then Round the unbelief of men It lifts up praying hands, Because it is so much a tree And cannot tell its tale Nor reach To clear its knowledge into speech. And whether on that awful day In Gethsemane There was wind, Or whether because day and night And day again all winds that blew From the City on the height Shuddered with the things they knew I know not, but you shall find An Almighty Memory— That yearly grows and flowers and fruits And strikes the blindness of its roots And suckers forth, but howsoe'er It blindly beat itself beyond Its planted first can do no more Than stretch the measure of its bond And shape as it had shaped before The arborous passion that can ne'er Be paroled into shriving air— Sicken in the leafy blood And turn it deadly pale. And as when a strong malady Of tertian and quatertian pain, Turning the cause whence it began Into the woe of man, By loops and conduits else too fine For an incarnadine, Hath shaken, shaken it from the body into space, When life and health again co-reign, And all youth's rosy cheer Tunes every nerve and summers every vein, Some crucial habit of the brain Sudden repeats the unforgotten throe— SONG OF A MAD GIRL, WHOSE LOVER HAS DIED AT SEA. Under the green white blue of this and that and the other, That and the other, and that and the other, for ever and ever, Under the up and down and the swaying ships swingswonging, There they flung him to sleep who will never come back to my longing. The Father comes back to his child and the son comes back to his Mother, But neither by land or sea Will he ever come back to me, Never, never, never Will he come back to me. All day I run by the Cliff, all night I stand in the sand, All day I furrow and burrow the holmes and the heights. But whether by night or day There's never a trace or a track, Never a word or a breath, In the swill and the swoop and the flash and the foam and the wind, Never a fleck or a speck Coming, coming my way. The mew comes back to the strand and the ship comes back to the land, But he will never come back To all the prayers that I pray thro' the scorching black of the day And the freezing black of the nights, Never, never come back To the ear that harks itself deaf and the eye that strains itself blind, And the heart that is starving to death. He was chill and they threw him to cold, He was dead and they threw him to drown, He was weary and wanted rest— They should have laid him on my breast, He would have slept on my breast, But they threw him into the boiling boil and bubble, The wheel and the whirl, the driff and the draff Of the everlasting trouble. I swear to you he was mine! I swear to you he was my own. Madam, if I may make so bold, Do you know what the dead men do In the black and blue, in the green and brown? Deep, deep, you think they sleep Where the mermen moan and the mermaids weep? Ah, ah, you make me laugh! I'm not yet twenty years old, But lean your ear And you shall hear A little thing that I know. Up and up they come to the top, Down and down they go down. To and fro the finny fish go, But slow and slow, and so and so, Low over high, high under low, Up and up they come to the top, Down and down they go down: When the sun comes up they come to the top, When the sun sinks they go down. FRAGMENT OF A SLEEP-SONG. Sister Simplicitie, Sing, sing a song to me, Sing me to sleep. Some legend low and long, Slow as the summer song Of the dull Deep. Some legend long and low, Whose equal ebb and flow To and fro creep On the dim marge of grey 'Tween the soul's night and day, Washing ‘awake’ away Into ‘asleep.’ Some legend low and long, Never so weak or strong As to let go While it can hold this heart Withouten sigh or smart, Or as to hold this heart When it sighs ‘No.’ Some long low swaying song, As the swayed shadow long Sways to and fro Where, thro' the crowing cocks, And by the swinging clocks, Some weary mother rocks Some weary woe. Sing up and down to me Like a dream-boat at sea, So, and still so, Float through the ‘then’ and ‘when,’ Rising from when to then, Sinking from then to when While the waves go. Low and high, high and low, Now and then, then and now, Now, now; And when the now is then and when the then is now, And when the low is high and when the high is low, Low, low; Let me float, let the boat Go, go; Let me glide, let me slide Slow, slow; Gliding boat, sliding boat Slow, slow; Glide away, slide away So, so. BALLAD. Oh Ladye fair, oh Ladye fair and mine, Where'er thou be, Canst thou divine The Love that hungers thus in me? The secret cell where lone I lie and sigh for thee? Long, long I wait, but shall I wait in vain? How long the Summer waited for the Rose! Ah say, oh say I shall not wait in vain! How long, ah fairest! must I keep The vigil of unsleeping eyes? Summer's sighs avail, Summer that sang himself to sleep, Summer that piping in a grove all day Played out his lovelorn soul upon the nightingale, Oh songs more blest than mine, ah happier sighs! For at rich midnight all the bells Of all the valley-lilies rang a tune Like moonlight up and down the dells, And June As a naked maiden thro' the shades Slipt thro' the woods and took her throne. By this the east is red and white, The queen of months is seen and known, Like flocks of doves that soar and fall, Like butterflies that hover and alight, Like tears of ecstasy when tear on tear From both wild eyes rains thro' the wreathèd hands, The blush of morning drops upon the lands, The Rose, the Rose is here! And rapture, rapture crowns the passion of the year Hark, hark, Something stirs the arching green, Thro' the verdurous aisles the doves are cooing, And the birds of smaller quire, As fairies that do run and sing Before the bridal of their queen, Flittering and fondly twittering, Lead thro' the languid air the sick delight of wooing. Sure thro' the distance dim I see the morn again! Leaves that meet and part the hues of dawn disclose. Has she heard my woes? Has she pitied all my pain? 'Tis she! 'tis she! As Summer waited for the Rose I shall not wait in vain! As June soft slipping warms the purple Dark, So thou slippest thro' the shades to me, So throbs my throbbing heart its thickening throbs to thee. LORD ROBERT. Tall and young and light of tongue, Gallantly riding by wood and lea, He was ware of a maiden fair And turned and whispered, ‘Remember me.’ (Oh Lord Robert, Lord Robert, Lord Robert, Oh Lord Robert, 'tis I, 'tis I; Under their feet where the cross-roads meet Dost thou think I can lie and lie, Lord Robert, Lord Robert, Lord Robert?) Day by day she walks that way Never hoping by wood or lea To be ware of the stranger gay Who turned and whispered, ‘Remember me.’ (Oh Lord Robert, Lord Robert, Lord Robert, Oh Lord Robert, 'tis I, 'tis I; Under their feet where the cross-roads meet Dost thou think I can lie and lie, Lord Robert, Lord Robert, Lord Robert? Chance for chance he rides that way, And again by wood or by lea He was ware of the maiden fair, And again he whispered, ‘Remember me.’ (Oh Lord Robert, Lord Robert, Lord Robert, Oh Lord Robert, 'tis I, 'tis I; Under their feet where the cross-roads meet Dost thou think I can lie and lie, Lord Robert, Lord Robert, Lord Robert?) Chance for chance that way rode he, And again where he was ware, Debonnair to that maiden fair He turned and said, ‘You remember me.’ (Oh Lord Robert, Lord Robert, Lord Robert, Oh Lord Robert, 'tis I, 'tis I; Under their feet where the cross-roads meet Dost thou think I can lie and lie, Lord Robert, Lord Robert, Lord Robert?) Chance for chance on a summer-day, Meeting her still by wood and lea, He leaped gay from his gallant grey And said, ‘I see you remember me.’ (Oh Lord Robert, Lord Robert, Lord Robert, Oh Lord Robert, 'tis I, 'tis I; Under their feet where the cross-roads meet Dost thou think I can lie and lie, Lord Robert, Lord Robert, Lord Robert?) Chance for chance when they hap'd to meet He pressed on her lip, he breathed in her ear, Dear dear words and kisses sweet, Words and kisses too sweet, too dear. (Oh Lord Robert, Lord Robert, Lord Robert, Oh Lord Robert, 'tis I, 'tis I; Under their feet where the cross-roads meet, Dost thou think I can lie and lie, Lord Robert, Lord Robert, Lord Robert?) When the morn enchants the east, When the south is dazed with noon, When the eve weeps to the west, When the night beguiles the moon, The maid moon that sat so lowly, Sat so lowly with bended head, Sat so lowly and rose so slowly, Rose so slowly and walked so lowly, Ever, ever with bended head, Till the black, black hour of the starless sky, The black, black hour and the dark, dark bed, And live maids weep as they turn in their sleep, Weep in their sleep and know not why, And the white owls shriek and the dead men croon. Now all ye gentlemen, grand and gay, When you meet a maid by wood or lea, Sir Knight, I pray, ride on thy way, Nor turn and whisper, ‘Remember me.’ Lest you drink no wine so strong or fine But out of the cup, like a shell of the sea, Thou shalt learn how slaves from their wormy graves Can do that bidding, ‘Remember me.’ (Oh Lord Robert, Lord Robert, Lord Robert, Oh Lord Robert, 'tis I, 'tis I; Under their feet where the cross-roads meet Dost thou think I can lie and lie, Lord Robert, Lord Robert, Lord Robert?) Lest never in hall when the knights stand tall And the goblets flash and the ladies shine, And thou risest up the king of them all, To drink to wassail and woman and wine, Risest up with thy jewelled cup, But out of the cup, like the sea in a shell, A voice thou hast known by hill and wood, A voice, a voice thou hast known too well! And the cold wine boils on the lip like blood, And the blood streams cold to the heart like wine, Cold and hot to the heart like wine. (Oh Lord Robert, Lord Robert, Lord Robert, Oh Lord Robert, 'tis I, 'tis I; Under their feet where the cross-roads meet Dost thou think I can lie and lie, Lord Robert, Lord Robert, Lord Robert?) FRAGMENT OF BALLAD. How shall I sing? the thing I crave To say is speechless as a Lover's trance. How shall I give to thee What even now is all so wholly thine That but by losing thee in me Or me in thee it never can be mine? As a sliding wave of sliding sea Before my following hand doth dance Ever and ever onward to the shore, And breaks and is a thousand things at once, And from the moment's multiplicity Takes itself up again into a wave: So all I feel and see Breaks to the thousand-fold of Fate and Chance, But from the moment's multiplicity Takes itself up into the thought of thee. FRAGMENTS OF POEMS FOUND SINCE THE WRITER'S DEATH. BAYONET SONG. Fire away, fire away, boys must have their play, There'll be hard work yet Before sunset: But what of the day when the boys have had their play? When the boys have played, why then, Aha! 'Twill be time for the men, Hurrah! And the bayonet! But, men, as we've nothing to do till then, And the match is on out there, I think you and I may as well stand by And see that the game goes fair. No drummer! no tambourettes, The earth is our drum wherever we come, Bayonets, bayonets, bayonets, bayonets, Bayonets, bayonets, bayonets, bayonets, Where's the drumstick that ever could beat, Where's the drumhead that ever could drum, Like the mighty foot of our thousand feet, And the earth that is dumb till we come and come? Come and come and come and come Bayonets, bayonets, bayonets, bayonets. ‘Love your enemy’—yes, 'tis the Briton's grace! I love him so well that I'd see his face. Yon little ninepins all in a row, How can I tell if I love 'em or no? So hurrah, lads, up we go! Here's to our nearer meeting, And if when we come within greeting I see my own special foe, I'll leave him to Tom or John, And find my work further on, And perhaps he and I will shake hands by and bye Side by side as we lie (To-night on the gory slope of the hill As the dew-tears drop from the sky above At the silent thought Of the friends whom we love Better still), And wait for the surgeon's cart That's always coming and never comes, And when a couple of bearers pass I'll give him my turn, Tho' the flesh-wounds smart, And the bone-wounds burn, And the life-tide's running dry Because he's my enemy. But that's when I've spiked up John's and Tom's And Rosie's and Poll's and Marjorie's And little Jack's and todlin May's And the victory's won and the bloody day's Done, and of flesh that is grass Along the braes the bloody hay's Made, that is made, hurrah! With the bayonet. For till you show me the Sacred Word I'm for Peter and his good sword, Only I hope if we'd drilled him here He'd not have missed the head for the ear. Gods, I'd give a Life's delights To have been there that night of nights, With ten such men as I see here now, When they spat their sin on the Sinless Brow And struck Him without let,— And have heard the ten steels clash at my call And seen the ten steels flash in the hall As we did them all up to the wall, High Priest, low Priest, Romans and all, Great and small up to the wall, Up to the wall with the bayonet. I would keep or lose my right hand By the love of every man here For the dear native land. There is not a man here this day Of whom come what come can I could speak with an accent of scorn. Who feels his courage grow colder At sight of the foe, Whose conscience is bolder Because we are shoulder to shoulder, Who goes up the hill because we are men And not because he is man, He shall serve his country yet But not with the bayonet. Well done—I like your eyes, Neither sunrise Nor sunset. Well done—I know the grips That will tell to barrel and stock What the beard hides on the lips: No strain on the rein, no tug on the slips. No drummer! no tambourettes! The earth is our drum wherever we come, Bayonets, bayonets, bayonets, bayonets, Bayonets, bayonets, bayonets, bayonets, Where's the drumstick that ever could beat, Where's the drumhead that ever could drum, Like the mighty foot of our thousand feet, And the earth that is dumb till we come and come? Till we come and come and come and come, Bayonets, bayonets, bayonets, bayonets! You are not dogs but Lions, and who Holds Lions in leash? Hurrah, My Lions! with just such a pack I'd hunt down the gods of Olympus! Alack, This mount is all an Olympus. Up there You see the bird-popping goddikins—ten To one I'll warrant you—bah! What then? Who cares while theirs is the ten to the one And ours is the one to the ten? Were't one to twenty which of us would shirk The odds or the glory? You see How the land lies? This fox-cover up the long rise, Then fifty paces of open, and then the breast-work. Scatter the pack in cover, make them cast wide, From wood-side to wood-side. Go in like hounds and come out At the top like men and lions—full swing Up the wood, but when it's grey-blue Overhead come together like men. A halt for breath, Slow-time and still as death To the covert-edge, and then The rush and the roar and the spring! Hunt's up, my Lions, hie in, hurrah! MENTANA. ‘Mother, I hear a word In the air!’ Play on, play on, my son, The word thou hast heard is some bright sweet bird That singeth, why and where Who knows? As who knows why and whither The little wind blows That bloweth hither and thither But hardly stirs thy hair, Hardly stirs the gossamers Or a film of thy golden hair. ‘Oh Mother, Mother dear, Bend down, bend down to me! Ah Mother, what dost thou hear?’ Hush, hush, my son, I hear a word in the air. ‘Ah Mother, why is thy face so white? Ah Mother, Mother, why Are thine eyes alight? Ah Mother, why is thy face so red? Mother, Mother, the hair of thine head—’ Silence, boy, we are near them, Silence, boy, the dead, the dead, I hear them, I hear them, I hear them! They come, they come, they are here, they are gone, And they cried, with a single cry, ‘Mentana!’ The word is said, the night is fled, Ere we knew it dawn 'tis day, The graves are wide, the dead are up and away, On the racing winds they race To call the living land. Boy, I am again a wife! Boy, I saw thy father's face! Round him rode the self-same band, That went round him that great day To Glory's latest Altar-place— Went around and fell around, When the red-legged assassin on the hill With conjurations bloody and base Jabbered the slanting sunset to his will, And by such pests did so incriminate The air with murder, that, when, weary and late, Upon the well-won field the conqueror stood Masters of all the eye could see, The star-cracked and berotted victory Burst in each glorious hand And tore the sacred limits of sweet life, And sluiced the dear heart's blood. Ah God! if such blood could sink into the ground! Up, up, my son, up, up, my soldier-son! On with thy white-cross cap, while I Bind me around with tri-colour And let us go. Whither? Whither they have gone before! Haste! The dead have fleeter feet than ours. See, the answering vales already move! What is that, that like a moving sea Floods towards the citied lilies of the towers That soon shall ring ‘Mentana!’ Well done, well done, Thy little sword and gun, Thou shalt wave the sword while I will cry ‘Mentana!’ See, as we run the hamlets run, The little towns are waving in the sun, ‘Mentana!’ Hark the bells thunder, hark the trumpets blow ‘Mentana!’ The mountains hear, the mists divide, Look, look, on high, The great tops crowned with joy and pride Clang to the clanging vales below, ‘Mentana!’ A thousand clarions blaze from side to side ‘Mentana!’ What, must we rest again the little feet? Cub of the Lion is thy dam too fleet? Yet thou hast proved thy kind, For see the misty miles behind, And lo, before us what was dim is clear. The city-walls, the city-gate, The towers, the towers That from our mountain seemed like flowers, But hence like Pedestals that wait The Statue of our Italy divine. That Italy who, tho' she hath been hewn In pieces,—as when the demons hew An angel, whose immortal substance true To his Eternal Image is not slain, But from a thòusand falchions rears again Still undivided by division His everlasting beauty, whole and one— When sounds the trump whereat the nations rise Shall lift her unseamed body to the skies And in her flesh see (God)— SNOWDROPS. Have you heard the Snowdrops ringing Their bells to themselves? Smaller and whiter than the singing Of any fairy elves Who follow Mab their Queen When she is winging On a moth across the night And calls them all With a far-twinkling call Like the tiniest ray of tiniest starlight That ever was seen? Far and near, high and low, Don't you hear the little bells go? Not in the big winds that blow The roaring beeches to and fro, Not in the lower rivers Of the breeze Below the trees, When the stiff bracken shines, And the thin bent quivers, And the limp green waves to and fro, You shall hear the little bells go, But in the jets and rivulets That sputter from the melting snows When against the mighty bole Of a beech they dash and swirl And twist and twirl, The licking leaves throw A thousand airy drops invisible Down the strong perpendicular To where the snowdrops are; Tiny drops that fall and meet, And swift and sweet Run dim viewless course of fitful force, Like an airy waterfall You shall hear the little bells go All the tiny snowbells swinging, Tiny chauntlets high and low. NEW-YEAR'S EVE. As when at twelve o'clock Strong January opes the gates of Life And we that were so cabined and so dark Within the round tower of the rounded year Feel the far Spring blown in on us and look Straight to the primroses, and with the swallow Skim thro' the dawns of daffodils and up To bluebell skies, and from the bluebell skies, Like a wild hawk upon a flight of doves, Swoop upon June and Paradise, and on Beyond the bounds of Eden to an Earth Boss'd with great purples of new-clustered wine Betwixt the tented harvests red and gold, And so into a cloud, and know no more——</field>
