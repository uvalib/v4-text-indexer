      <field name="fulltext">The Booke. Those Epigrams faine would I owe, Where euery Word, is a Word and a Blow. Reprofes, where they are Well deseru'd; must be Well paide. To the Right noble Lord the Earle of Buckingham, be much mirth, permanent Pleasure, and endlesse happinesse, here, and else where. To Thee, whose Worth hath doubl'd good-hopes Cape Thrice in high pleasures Seas, I send this Toy, To mocke such Apes (or Beasts in humanè shape) As giue vs cause of laughter, and annoy. Her's Wit too ranke, sith sprong from too much soyle; Whereat such Apes as but Saintes counterfet, Do mop and mox; good sport, in sport, to spoile,: But, iustest Ierkes their wry-mouths right shall set. If some Lines broader bee, than long, herein, (To make the lash (with laughter) lowd ech blow) It is, broad Faults to scourge with greater dyn, To feare, much more than hurt, offenders so: Then when (deare Lord) great cares your greatnes grieue, Laugh at these Ierkes (like Greatnes) in your sleeue. To the Printer. Printer, here's for thee; yet, 'tis not for mee; But cleane against mee: for, thei'l ban my Birth Whose Crimes I scourge; but, that is good for thee: For, most will rather buy their Plague, with mirth, Than profit that, with pleasure, holds not Quarter; Then, still French-crowne me, sith I am thy Martyr. And yet, least, so, I should no Martyr bee, Giue mee the Fame, take Gould and Blame to Thee. Againe, of my Selfe. Some (not a few) who long to raise their Name In Proems to their Bookes, seeme foes to Fame: Nay, more than seeme; who vow (to grace their They publish Books for profit, not for praise: (daies) And, hate all friendship held with pride or fame, Though to their Bookes, they vse to put their name. But I am none of those (dissembling so) Ile speake the truth; And, therfore All shall know, That FAME and I haue beene too long in loue, Now to be foes: Nay, still Ile striue to prooue The vt'most of mine Ut'most for her sake; Yea life forgoe, ere She should me forsake. And if She haue mee, through my Fortunes wrack, Ile fly her; so, to binde her to my Backe: For Men by Nature, rather then thei'le be Nothing, of Something; they desire to flee Vpon the Winges of euiternall FAME Beyond Decay; and Bee, though but in Name. And be it that vnsanctified Wit With hellish Flashes may soone kindle it, And make it burne in glory still; yet lust I more for That, than all that turnes to dust. Say, tis a burning feauer of the Soule To long for that which hurts, not makes her whole And, that that Aire is too too pestilent, That makes the Sicknes much more violent: Yea, Water (though from Castaly it came) Is best forborne if it but oyles the Flame; Yet can I not but say yea, lowdly cry, I loue, nay doate on all Eternity, Saue that which hath relation so to ill As makes Eternity abhord: Yet fill My Muse a Bowle of Nectar drawne from thence Whence all Gods Stellifide haue influence, And Ile carouse so freely of the same, That paine Ile beare, as pleasure 'twere, for Fame. And though I reele beneath the Wheele of Fate, Yet Fame shall follow me through loue or hate: That if to higher Stiles I cannot climbe, All Times shall Stile mee Taxer of my Time. It's a mad world my Maisters. And a merry world my Mistrisses. O braines, what Bounds are set to lymit you, In madnesse? wil you crack the Pan, your fence? Will you be mad with Reason? are you true Vnto my Iudgement, Soueraigne of your Sence? Lo, how you me expose to endles Spight: To Censure, that may Patience quel to beare it? Will you interre my Name in datelesse Night, And for your Glory must I Shame inherit? Do you containe such Powrs as are of force To giue me Honor for Wit well imploid; Yet make 'twixt Wit and Wisdome such diuorce, As, with Worlds-hate, I shall bee still anoyd? Put that hate in one Scale (O Weight past Weight!) And in the other put Ayres worser name, (Cal'd fame for Folly, or a vaine conceit) Wil This, not light; That, heauy make my fame? Shal aged Thoughts so doat? Shal Childhood now Inuade my Iudgement with so fierce assault, That it to idle Fancies so should bow, As still to beare the weight of Follyes fault? And shall I sell my Birth-right for such Grewell As feeds, but fattens not; or, sats but Fooles? Will you to my good Name become so cruell As still to haue me whipt in Wisedomes Schooles? Be quiet Wit, leaue beating of my Braine To do the Worke of playing but on Crimes: To Scourge the Follyes of the World is vaine, If thy Whips Lines be nought but rotten Rymes. Muses, why sleepe ye? Will ye see me sinke O're head and eares in shame, who doe adore you? Stretch out your hands: what! fr? me do you shrink To drowne in deepe disgrace while I implore you? Braines, seek you glory of Herostratus, To make your Findings curst to After-times? Call in my Muse and check her thus, and thus; What do I now? thus (xxx) crosse I out her Rimes, VVho knowes how neere the Article of Death My Fame and I am? And what 'compt I must Giue for each vaine and ill imployed breath I fetch for life? To what then doe I trust? My Fame. Why, that may dye before me? Or My Pleasure? That dies with mee. VVhat ist then Makes me thus plague (which I am forty for, For hauing cause) my selfe and other men? Faults; Faults &amp; nought but faire &amp; fowlest Faults, Both in my selfe, and others I espie. Tush, th' are nere mended with such mad Assaults As make them worse, and many more thereby. I hope of better: Aretine, whom Fame Stil'd Scourge of Princes (such I leaue to such) Kept them in awe: So may an Epigram VVith other soft-brow'd Sinners, doe as much, But, Oh, I am too broad; and, that doth irke. But how should I scourge broad sinnes otherwise? Must I not make them bare before I ierke? Who knowes not that? Why then let that suffice. VVhat? Wit, how now? Hast 'suces for these scapes? VVilt thou turne Foole, yet wittily defend it? Hast thou so many anticke formelesse Shapes? Yet ween'st it such as Wisdome cannot mend it? Where art thou Wisdome? wilt thou suffer Wit To runne wilde now in mee; and hauocke make Of all my Reason in a franticke fit? O Heau'ns! where am I? Doe I sleepe, or wake? In yonder Sky the Skie? Is that the Sunne Which I haue wakinge seene? Is this the Earth Where safe I walkt; and now will let me runne To breake mine Honors neck, in brain-sick mirth? Are these the Folke I foole with, which I see? Or shadowes? Shadowes? No. What else? Madmen The greater number: so, will Martyre mee For whipping of but One, and fearing Ten. A hall, mad Bedlams, now my Braines (like yours) Begin to crow: my Muse, this Afternoone, Must dance a Brawle: O! looke! Apollo lowres To see his Priest so subiect to the Moone! Gods me, how now? what strange confused noise Of murmur heare I? O! the Earth doth shake: Powles makes her People volley-foorth her voyce Against me for their ierks. Harke! O! I quake. S'foote what are these that pynch me? Goblins? Elues? A wanion on the Elues for me; What now? Pinch you behind, ye Nits, to saue yourselues? Before me too? Saint George; then haue at you. What Weather's this? how soddain is this Storme? Whence fall these Stones that so do barter me? What! from the Winds wide Mouth? can they inorme? I weigh them not a Mite, so light they be. Harke how it thunders! All the world's afire With flashes of the fury of the mad. Looke, looke, they come; beware, retire, retire: Hold Braines; this feare, I feare, will make you gad. Apollo helpe me. No? Wilt leaue me thus? What! not one glance of fauour in this Case? Then, Luna help; be thou propitious. Why, so: thou cheer'st me in this Wild-goose-chase? But soft! What smell is this: It wounds my Braine? Breath of Blaspheamers: Fy, is no Place free From this so banefull Ayre? Can I remaine No where, but, lik a Plague, 'twill follow me? O what a Hell is this? A hell? No, no; It's better than some Scapes, that more offend: T'is but the bleating of some Calfe, or so, That feeles my Spleenes iust Ierks; &amp; there's an end. Bitter zeale, is lesse than Loue. Fame, gathering out of her own moti? strength, And liuely grown by laboure in her flight, I seeke to hold; yet draw her out at length With this my mirry Muse: But, here's the spight: To follow Mirth, as maym'd, she euer vses; For, Bolts from Dolts still cripple mirry-Muses. A Caueat. To bite is but a dogged part; to sting Is but a Snakes, Wasps, Hornets, or a Bees; These Men do shun, sith, Dole, or Death they bring; Yet some haue, oft, a Medcine made of These; So, though I byting, barke; and stinging, hisse; Yet make of all a Medcine for thy Misse. To Martiall. Martiall, th' art still renownd for thy Free-wit; But, oft reproached for thy Looser-pen: Yet, Wise-men (longing for a merry-Fit) Reade thee with Praise &amp; Pleasure, now and then: Then I (too proudly humble) thinke not scorne, They Wit-all call my name for thy Fames horne. The BOOKE to Grauitie. Sterne Grauity auert thy face from me; Or, looke not saddly on me: for, I am Too light, somewhere, for Eyes too sad to see; And yet such lightnesse shews but Uice her shame: But, to reproue Uice viciously, is more Amisse, I feare: the salu's worse than the Sore: Yet, Grace it selfe can hardly Wit perswade That it is sin to call a Spade a Spade. The BOOKE to the Reader. Look'st thou for Wit well relish'd? here, each Letter Yeelds fresh-Wit season'd well with Salt and Pepper: Then, if they last not, or do proue vnsaury, It's through thy Foolry, rather than my Knau'ry. Againe. [Art good; and bad thy wit? then, touch me not] Art good; and bad thy wit? then, touch me not: For, I doe often ierke the honest Sot. Art bad, and thy wit good? Forbeare, much more, To touch mee: for, I lash such till they roare. Or, art thou good, and great thy Wits extent? Th' wilt loue me, tho thou loathe mine Excrement. But be thou good or bad: for Six-pence, I Will glad and grieue thee, make thee laugh &amp; cry O! take my money, For this Sowre-Honey. Why Poets of the present times, be not so well esteem'd as those of former. It's Enuy that doth make vs better deeme Of men erst breathing, th? now drawing breath: So, Poets, that now liue; we dis esteeme, And read them not, with pleasure, till their death. Of the worth of wittiest Workes, or Bookes. Rare Bookes are Of-springs of Wits most compleate, Distill'd from purest Braines refined Spirits, Which thereby are consum'd: then, such rare merits Transcend all Patrons Guifts how euer great. Mercy with Iustice. Should I, with ierkes of wit, whip euery Vice, That now are w?dring: I should make my booke Swell as it had the worst of Poysons tooke; And, make men swell as poison'd, with the price: But, some Ile whip; the rest Ile spare for some Of more Wit, and lesse grace in time to come. Those Lines which all, or none do vnderstand, Do neither with Wit, Art, nor Iudgment stand. Those Rimes are best (though least of most esteem'd) That (like sage Platoes Suppers) best do please When they diiested be; how er'e mis-deem'd They be at first: And, so I would haue these. Of My selfe; and, this Bable, my Booke. Some lothe to be laught at for what they write; But, I do hold that wrong these Writings right: Then, iudge of these too Foolish Writings state, That onely aime but to be laughed at. [Epigrams.] Against Pseucus the too cunning Palmister, and Poet. Epigram. 1. Pseucus is perfect in Chirosophy: That is; hee's hand-wise, stealing coningly: But, oft he's well laugh'd at for stealing Rimes; So hee's Hand-wise, &amp; Head-foole too, somtimes. Upon one named R: Holland, who kept one Nell Cotton. Epigram. 2. A light yong-man, who lou'd the like yong-woman Desir'd their Things to either might be common: So, gaue her, wh? her good wil he had gott?, A Yard of Holland, for a N-ell of Cotton. Against the nobly-desended Muscus, who wedded a Butchers fat Daughter. Epigram. 3. The well-borne Muscus wedded hath, of late, A Butchers Daughter Fat, for Pounds &amp; Plate: Which Match is like a Pudding; sith in That He puts the Bloud; her Father all the Fat. Against Faber, the Eartlesse forger. Epigram. 4. Faber, the Forger, would himself bestow, In marr'age faine; and sweares he nought doth owe True: for, hee's Earelesse, and hyres all he weares: So, oweth not so much as Clothes, or Eares! Against Dromus, the Borrowing barraine, or bankroupt Discourcer. Epigram. 5. Dromus, in talke, repeates but old-said Sawes Of other M?s; &amp; then Discourse with-draws: So, (like a rotten Naile) he cannot bore Through rotten wood without a way before.

A good wife's (like a Snaile) nere out of doore (Except her Head) to shun, and let abuse: That makes bad husbands goe abroad the more To horne their wiues (poore Snales) for keeping house A good Wife should be vnlike the Moone. Epigram. 66.

Of Cleobulinas darke Discourse. Epigram. 76. Cleobulina, speakes by Parrables, In Riddles (darke) her sence she doth insold: No Eagles eye (though holpe with Spectacles) Can see the way her meaning to vnfold: But aske her for a Gowne, what she will do? Those words shee'le eccho plainly, She will doo. What Lawyers are like. Epi. 92. Lawyers are like the Tongues of Ballances, Foes to th' oreweighd with Coyne &amp; Countnances, Who still encline vnto the weightiest side; And there while weight remaines, they do abide. Lawes were better to be like Hunters Toyles, which they be not: Than like Cob-webs, which they be. Epi. 93. Like Cob-webs, Lawes still take the little flyes, When as the Waspe &amp; Hornet scapes with ease But Hunters Toyles the great Beasts do surprise; And let the little scape: were Lawes like these, The great should haue less power the small to hurt Or, if they did, they should be hamperd fort. Of the vnbloudy warres of Poets. Epi. 79. The Banquet of the Centaures made (it's sed) The Cups to flye at one anothers head: And oft such Banquets are with Mars his Mates, Where Boles let out and take in blood of Pates: But Poets are more wise and merry men, That freely drinke and war but with the Pen.

In euery Month eu'n as the Moone doth change; So Fluxus state a change doth still sustaine; Now fills, th? falls (with Course vnstaid, as strange) Like a stronge Felt, soone downe, then vp againe: Were he starke Lunatick t'would not do so: Yet like his Braines, his state doth ebbe and flow! Against Phannius sad lookes, linde with lightnesse. Epigram. 82. Phannius, doth s?d his Conscience to the Stews; Yet vp his Countenance demurely Mewes, Like an Italians wife: the worse for that; For so it more deceaues in I know what. Of Nichus good fortune, being robd. Epigram. 83. Copper-nos'd Nichus swears that rob'd he was: But I suppose the Theefe was but an Asse; For that he left behinde him, and did lose, The precioust Thing he had; which was his Nose!

Of my Selfe. Epigram. 86. Cornelius, Gallus, Sappho, Pindarus, Anacreontes, Alceon, Orpheus, Propertius, Uirgill, Ouid, Iuuenall Callimachus, Philotes, Martiall, Catullus and Tibullus; These haue sung In seu'rall Straines of Loue and whores among: Then, haue, I Precedents for what I do Against o're doing Drabbs that men vndo; But if the Bridwell Lash them nothing irks, They will but laugh at these poore paper-Iirks. Of Frontus his Formosity and Deformity. Epi. 87. Frontus, the Gallant, is both faire, and foule; Which Contradiction, faith can hardly win: Yet being braue in Body, soild in Soule, Maks good hee's faire without, and foule within: And though his Suits be silks of seuerall formes, He's but inuolud with Excrements of Wormes; For which he's sued both within, and out; And so his onely beauty is in Sute.

One Kingman dwelt at the signe of the White Horse in Islington; wearing out there 2. leases of 21. yeares a peece: the Landlord, at last, being bid more rent by another, vnkindly vnhorst him when he was least able to goe on foote. A lirke for that. Epi. 91.

Some Colts (wild younsters) that nere broken were Hold it a doughty deed to steale a Deere: If cleanly they come off, they feast anon; And say their Prey is good fat Venison: If otherwise, by them it doth appeare That that which they haue stollen then, is Deare! Of Fidlers cheape good cheare. Epigram. 94. Fidlers still fill their Eares with cheapest Notes; And fill their Bellyes seld, at their owne Cost: That makes the Wag-strings haue such greedy throts Wh? they (shotfree) do feed on sod &amp; rost: For when they come to that, to them its Nuts To stretch their great, &amp; grate their smaller Guts.

Of one that would haue an Epitaph to ermoue the King in a Suite. Epigram. 102. One searse like One, came to me when I was Extremely busie in mine idlenesse, Beseeching me to help him in a Case Of too ill hap, which he did worse expresse. He said he had Petitioned the King For help therein; who gratiously did grant it; But for (poore man) it lack't remembring, He (sighing) said; that he as yet, did want it. Therefore (with killing words, vrg'd mortally) An Epitaph he begg'd as t'were for Bread) To moue the King, God blesse him man (quoth I) Amen (quoth he) but this will strike it dead. Then thus (the best I could) I made him one: Here lies a Suite that lately was a foote; Yet weakly passed (wel-neere all alone) Unto a Royal Hand that strength put too't, But falling from that warme Hand caught such cold, That it (alas) dide sooner than it should: So, if that sacred high Hand raise it not, The Suitor with the Suit below must rot. Then all good People that in Court are mute, Pray for the rising of this simple Sute. Of Curius and Phrynees careles dancing. Epig. 103.

Of Stasicrates his great offer to great Alexander. Epi. 106. Stasicrates (an Architect) of yore, To Alexander came, and fault did finde With all his Statuaes; saying they were poore, And too too small for one of so great mind.

The right shall hold the hugest Citty there, Along the left-hand-Palme (as it were sweat) Shall run her fairest Riuer, which doth beare The royal'st Ships: These Greats are like thee, great These will be sempiternall, worthy thee: But, vading thinges thy glory will deceiue: All other Artists are but Shades to me; On Earth alone I endlesse glory giue: But, with one drop of inck, some Poets Pen Can make him longer liue, a God, with Men!

The Stoicks held, it's better be a foole In humane shape; then to be ne're so wise In brutish Forme: but, Cornius hates their schoole: For, hee's a Man-beast in his Luxuries: Yet is his Bash, of Braines, exceeding full; But, makes himselfe (damn'd Beast) a common Bull! Against the Prodigall Brutes excessiue riotousnesse. Epigram. 108. VVhen Brute (the Waster) to accompt must come For his Expences, at the day of doome; Inprimis (he must say) for Phesant-Poults, For Fidlers, Singers, Plaiers, Buffoxs, Dolts, For rich Perfumes, Confections, Suger, Sack, For Fashions, &amp; New-fangles for the Back; For Hankes, for Hounds, for Trulls, and such like Toies, For Suppers still, to still but roring Boyes; For Cards and Dice, and what by them was lost By Cheaters Craft, and such-like other cost: Which seu'rall Items, hauing surely Summes Tide, with a dismall Black-line, to their Bummes: Making the totall, thousands to surmount Twenty times doubled: how will this account Passe with the Iudge whose doome is strict &amp; pure? Faith, then these Items, Ite will procure: But this Quietus est, will little boote, Sith this cold Reckoning hath a burning Foote. Of Cælestines performing Lycurgus his Law. Epig. 109. Licurgus made a Law, (which youth approues) That if an old man, cold in loues desire, Had matcht a wife as young as youngest Loues, She might a young-man choose to get his Heyre. Then English Cælestine this Law obserues: Who wiuing late an old man, she doth take A lusty youth (his man) that for him serues To keepe a coyle; so, saues his Maisters Stake: Whether meat or drinke be most desired or may bee best foreborne. Epi. 110. Whether we meate or drinke may best forbeare some make a doubt although the case be cleer, For some, through age, do loose their eating quite; But to the last, theyle drinke with rare delight: Many their mawes to meat by sicknesse lose; But, drinke is euer meat and drinke to those: And as Lifes latest refuge is the Heart, So drink's the harts; which drinks, &amp; then doth part This makes so many health it, as they doe, Till they be heart-sicke; and then drinke they too: So drinke is theirs in Sicknesse and in Health, And loue, like Man and Wife in wo, and wealth: But (Healthers) though this health stil like you so, Yet do but kisse it and so let it go. Of my selfe. Epi. 111. Somtimes a man, with wealth and wit endow'd, Offerd his Soueraigne largely, but for this; That in his eare he might bee, oft, allow'd In sight, to say, God speed, with voyce submisse: But (Lord!) were I in this mans coat or case, I scarce should saue my selfe with so much grace. Against Drunkards. Epi. 112. A man (they say) surmounts all Creatures far, Yet Dogs, than some men, are more regular: For after-noone they goe alone from feasts: But some men cannot; they are worse than beasts. The quality of diuers Nations. Epi. 113. The Portugall both seemes and is a foole: The Spaniard's not too wise; yet seems not so: The French seemes fond but learnes in wisedomes: schoole, The English wise; but it he cannot shew: Th' Italian wise each way (the World doth wot) And so the Douch would be, but for the Pot. Against the fantasticall Attire that many Ladies weare now a daies. Epi. 114. If Ladies Maners with their Gands agree; Then they Seeme such, they would not seeme to Bee; But if they would not Bee as th' are in sight, Let them not weare what makes them seeme so light Of the strange dareing of yong gallants of these familiar times. Epi. 115. Vertumnus was a God the Romans seru'd, That gouernd Mindes &amp; could all shapes assume; Oh! if that Quality were yet reseru'd For some audacious Lads that would presume: What Ladies Locks, nay what Queenes Clossets shold Be left vnlockt the Wags would be so bold! Of Dawlus his vnkind kindnesse. Epi. 116. Crowes will not feed their yong til 9. daies old, Because their vnkind colour makes th? doubt Them to be theirs; which makes th? to with-hold Their helpe, till Time the truth by proofe brings out, If Dawlus then were witty as a Daw, Hauing a Child so farre vnlike him selfe, He would from him his helping-hand with-draw, And let th' vndoubted father keepe the Elfe: But (Nat'rall) he, is kinder than a Crow, To keepe the Brat, whose Sire he doth not know. Against D. Tangus his swelling phisick. Epi. 117. Tangus, the Phisick-doctor, loues a VVhoore Better then giuing phisick to the poore. He hath the arte of Bawdry better farre Than Phisick: yet, in both doth make and Marre: He makes a Maide a VVhoore; so, mares her quite: And makes a sound man sick, or dead out-right. What Virgin can resist, when he doth boast He can restore her Mayden head, if lost: VVhich at her marriage shalbe found as strict As any Girles that Loue did ne're aflict. When he doth promise, by a phisick-feate, To let the Wombe &amp; Pappes from growing great. To giue her Vnguents and Complexions store To make her Beauties rare Reflexions more: To keepe her Body still, in healthfull state; And make her mirry in despight of Fats. VVhich hauing VVill to promise, Skill, to do; VVhat VVench can choose but loue &amp; please him too? Tangus, your Arte your Nature truly hits. That helpes or hinders Loues stil-burning sits. But take heed (Tangus) how you empty still The VVombes which you with working-phisick fill, Least some repentant wench which vsde you haue Say at her end you vsde her like a Knaue: Then, let mee thee admonish (without stripes) Giue no more Phisick with such Glister-pipes. Of the Phisitions meanes and opportunity to be baudy. Epi. 118. No Craft, like that of Phisick, hath such times, For baudy-matches, &amp; such carnall crimes: No houses are so close, nor walls so strong, No Prisons nor no Monastries, among, Which may or can the Emperick shut out: Nay, more, he maketh iealous husbands pout: For, sole he must be with their Loue sicke wiues, To minister what they loue as their liues. Eudemus so did Phisicke Liuia, (sicke) And Uectius Valentinus did the like To Messalina: So, they nere do faile Of time to giue close Phisicke at the ( ) Of Leuis his Colours. Epi. 119. Leuis goes al in coluors, light, as bright; And stalkes, speaks bigge: so that a man would sweare That he some Peacock were at the first sight: For, he more colours hath, and much more deare: Yet he no colour hath, or small (at most) To keepe a Lords wife at the Bare ones cost. Of Curius his courage neuer cooled. Epi. 120. By Conquest Proculus, the Emperour, Took, of Sarmatiam Maids, an hundred, which In fifteene dayes and nights he did deflowre; But, Herc'les in a night did hafe as much. And Theophrastus tells in India growes An Hearb so rare, whereof when one hath eaten, He threescore times and ten, at once, did close, In the Venetian fight; yet scapt vnbeaten. Well; these are Prodigies, and are beleeu'd No further than their tellers credit goes: But Curius sweares he ne're was yet depriu'd Of force for that: so, all his time bestowes In Venus seruice; But, at last, some knocks He needs must haue; els scapes well with a Poxe. Against Glossus immoderate desire of glory. Epi. 121. Glossus will doe no good without you praise him, So, in his goodnes stil vaineglory stayes him: Like a full pierced vessell in his bent, That will not run vnlesse you giue it vent. Of false Prophets. 122. If Prophets were deriu'd of profitting, Then Lawyers Prophets be, still Prophesying. Of couetons Patrons. Epi. 123. Patrons are Latrons: then, by this, Th' are worst of greedy People: Whose Cognizance a Wolfes-head is; And in his Mouth a Steeple. Of Fluscus the proud Miser, and his more proud and miserable wifes making their Tombe before their death. Epig. 124. Fluscus, &amp; his grim wife their Tomb haue made Before their death; and in the Church it pight; As some do make a Deaths-head and a Spade To mortifie them with that mortall sight: Yet These are humble made by This they make; But Those do make That only for Prides sake: Then how their thoughts should there entombed be, Yet here liue proud and harde, I hardly see. Againe. Epi. 125. To make that which bereaues vaine Pride of breath, Prides life in life, is pride in life and death. Of Caylus getting by giuing ground to his enemies. Epi. 126. Caylus, doth thriue in giuing ground t'his foes; So he in going backward, foreward goes: Much like a Wyer-drawer, who hath the knack, To draw the more, the more he draweth backe. How a Man more then Woman is shrewd. Epigram. 127. A false speech, Custome hath for true, alow'd In calling curst Wiues shrewed: when in truth, The Husbands of such wiues are truely shrew'd; For, of th' ensuing Sayings, it ensuth: Who gets a Wife (we say) he wiued is; Or, if apparrell; hee's apparrelled: If Riches; hee's enritched: So, by this, When he hath got a Shrew, he is Shrewed, For, names of Sheepe or Shrews all woemen keep; Then men are Shrew'd whose wom? ar not Sheep. That which is farre fetcht and deere bought is good for Ladies. Epi. 128. My Lady calls for Wine; yet ere shee drinkes, She curiously demands what cost the Tun? If it be said Ten-pound; she from it shrinkes; And, mewing sayes shee'le none: But, let it run Into another Bowle; then, bring it her, And say it cost much more; shee drinks it straight, And sweares it's much more delicate, than deere: So, wine she measures by the prices weight; This is a feauer of the Minde; then, she Should still, be kept from drink; so, cur'de to be. Of my venturing in the Lottery. Epigram. 129. I long'd to venture in the Lottery An Angell; but was loth to part with that: Did I both long, and loath? yes, that did I; Long for a Prize, yet loath to be laught at. But yet I ventur'd; and for that I haue That which I had; No hope my selfe to saue. If what I had I haue, I'me as I was: True: for I am, and was for this, an Asse. My Rimes that ran before my reason into the Lottery. Epi. 130. Crownes are inestimable: yet if I With halfe one get 4000. Crownes I lye: Yet that this lying Sin I should eschue; Fortune (I find) hath made me speak too true. Of Leuis his heauines and lightnes. Epigram. 131. Leuis, is light and heauy both at once; Strange Paradox! for, he is euer drunke: And therefore drinkes he freely (for the nonce) Vntill he other sinkes, or quite is sunke: And then (as Drunkard know) himselfe he feeles Light in the Head and heauy in the Heeles. Against those that taxe this present Age for blind ignorance, sith it sees not how to commend their pretended knowledge. Epi. 132. To taxe the Age wherein we liue for want Of Learning, Wit, or Grace, is but to vant Our priuate glory in the Ages shame: Which is (alas!) too deerely purcha'st Fame: Sith hee that seeks to rise by all mens fall, His fame is, like himselfe, still loth'd of all: For, be it that most men, (meere lead) doe sincke Ore-head, that seeke to swim in learned Inke; And, quite are drown'd when they do seek to gage The ground of Arts full Sea, that swells with rage Of heauenly Windes high raptures: yet there bee Some, that with diuing, can the bottome see; And each least thing that in it mooues or lyes, Sith, skilfully, they diue with open eyes. Now, if this Some be not the greater heape Of men: t'was so when Learning was most cheape: Men of all Ages were none otherwise; Fooles still surpast the number of the wise. Then, let this Age that (on the Brow of Time) Sees writ the former best of Prose and Rime; And well can adde (as former Times haue done) To all Arts that were formerly begun, With heauy Taxes not be so opprest; “The Bird's too bad that fileth her owne Neast. Againe. Epigram. 133. The Wits (though wilde in this) haue now a Straine VVhen they applaud each others versing Veine To say, they write three Ages, if not more, From being well conceiu'd. Lord! this lies sore Vpon the Stomack of the present Age VVhich saith; It knowes such Poets write in rage VVhich still blinds Reason; so, they maddly write: Then would they haue the Age, but at first sight, So mad to know that Language; which (perch?ce) Themselues, in that, must oft plead ignorance VVere they examined throughly to the quick? God shield the Age should be so Lunatick: As all Arts grow with Age; so, Wit hath growth: Then, th' Age wants no Discretion, but the Youth. Epigram. 134. Great Alexander, Aristotle Will'd To end his Booke, of Beasts, which he beg?; For which his paines he so his Cofers fill'd As might suffize to make a Beast a Man! It was eight hundred Talents mounting to Foure hundred, foure score, thousand Crowns (at least) And all for writing but of Beasts; which do Make men no wiser than to know a Beast. But though some moderne VVriters write of Men And of their better Parts (the Soule and Minde) Yet of our moderne Keysars (now, and then) They get a Gird (perhaps) or els but Winde: Belike to saue their Arte they guird them so; And giue no vent, lest it abrode should slow. Of the vnutterable idlenesse of our She-gallants (vngentle-gentlewomen) of these times. Epigram. 135. Lord! how it would a Cato vex to heare The sad'st discourses of some Courtly Dames: As how the Gown doth fit; how stand the Haire: How the face slikt: how trickt their outward frams. VVhat Looks do most become; what gate is best: How they should Sit, Lie, Rise; (and these last two They Stand on most) how such &amp; such were drest: Wo giues them place, and who do take it too. What bowings they salute with; how they kisse, (Or Lippe or Cheeke) and who the same deserues: Who they doe visit; who their seruant is: Who they least loue; and who then most obserues. What women should be Coacht, (or Horst at least) And who Caroch't with Horses full of life: (O wanton Mares!) and where they late did feast. Who Gold may wear: who Pearl or Stones less rife Then be there old Crones (mothers of such Maids) Who tell, how many Sutors they haue had; How many Guifts; how many louing Ayds: Who makes them merry, &amp; who makes them sad. How faire they were in youth, what they haue seen, Heard-felt, or (feelingly) what vnderstood? What Lords once lou'd th?; who they might haue beene, Who are of sullen, who of merry mood. All this and (O fie, fie!) much more then this, These, old and young, (no Barrell better hearing) Still twattle to spoyle Time (that pretious is) Wh? they do meet; which irks a wise mans hearing And if a sober young-man lights among them, His staidnes makes them reele with mirth, as drunk With girds they wr?g him, sith he doth not wrong th? And, at his chast behauiour fleer like Punks. But a right courtly lad, that will be bold, And tosse, &amp; touse, &amp; wring, &amp; wrong them most: That Reacher onely hath their hearts in hold; The Sober soule they hold a simple Ghost. Well Wantons take your time, it wil away: Laugh while yea can, ye shall not while yee would, Make fooles of wise men; (fooles so euer may) And shew good Carriage in your being bold: But, when yee haue done all, if I obserue yee, To After-times, in Bryne, I will preserue yee. Against the no lesse vaine discourses of our as idle He-Gallants. Epigram. 136. Bvt do vaine Women herein onely sinne? I would they did for Mens sakes; but (alas!) It is too true that Men offend herein No lesse than Women: for, each golden Asse, Or gaudy Cocks-cembe whole Meal-times engrose In talke of Plaies (that's now a Common-place) And Censuring of Plaiers; which is drosse Of Wit; and thus they question, too, the Case. What Quarrells (stil'd the Bysnesse) now depend? Anh who about the same haue crost the Seas? Who seconds are, and who besids intend The like? and when we shall heare more of these? Who must call such and such t'accompt? for what? Nay, that's no matter, sith there's notice tane Now of that Bissnesse, (so, ingag'd by That) For, sowre lookes past in Powls or Milford-lane. Who are behind hand for the Foole or Lye? Who for a smarting iest, or bruizing knock? Who for a Sta?ke? miss-taken on the Bye? Who for a ?wryh?ooke, or directer mock? Who do our London fine-Wiues Husbands horne? What Punks are extant? where they may be found? What Feather's best? what Colour most is worne? What Gallants flote? and which are now a Ground? What Fashion's in request? what Tailors go Oftest to France for new? Who makes a Hose, Or Doublet best? who steales most stuff? and who By Taylors Bills and filchings most do lose? Who's most fantastick? and who weares his Weeds After the newest Garbe? what Lords we haue Like, or vnlike themselues? who are but Weeds? And who but empty heads held high and braue? Whose Hawk slew best? what ho?d most glory w?? What Matches, late, wer bowld? by wh?, &amp; where? What rule was at the Race? what Race was run? Who won or lost at either; here, or there? How many Train-sents run were in a Day? What Lords were at them? whose Horse got the Bell? Who most did brag? and who most Bets did Lay? Who odds did giue? who giue, and take aswell? These are the Common-places which they vse That be our brightest Gallants, in discourse; And oft among Relate they flying Newes (How euer false) which is as bad, or worse. Then, our She-gallants, foolish with excesse, Still come beneath like Hees for foolishnesse! The Miseries of Marriage. Epigram. 137. Continuall Care; tormenting Ielousie; Domestick Iarrs; vnbraidings with the Dowr Comparisons of eithers liberty; The doubtfull end of Children; lookes too sow'r; Wiues Parents powrings; strang heires; death of right; Traitor &amp; Theef, in Bozome, house, &amp; Bed; These miseries on most men married, light; Yet thinke they liue no life till they are Wed: Its true indeed, they liue no life till then; That is; they liue no life of wretch men. Of Manes his obsession. Epigram. 138. Er'e he was married, Manes saith that he Was tempted by the Deuill; but, ere since, The Deuill hath him in sate-Custody Whose fell tormentings passe his patience: Then better tempted still, than so to marry; Yet some had rather damned be than tarry. On the death of Henry the fourth French King murdered. Epigram. 139. Though Kings are Gods, yet shal they die like men: (What shalbe, shalbe) but, most christian Kings Haue dide like Beasts; nay, like Beasts most vnclean, Sought but for slaughter, like pernitious Things! Two Henries, Kings, most Christi? Kings of France, (Now drown'd in their own bloud) this truth defend; And though the last had eu'n predominance Of Fates and Men, yet both haue wrought his end. Once dryv'n to Diepe, by Fate (in deepe distresse) He was; and thence by Fate brought back againe. Warre making way) to reigne in quietnesse: So, when he fled, his Fates bid Neptune reigne, His Flight, that so he might both liue and die In Purple; fatall, to French-Maiesty! Of the force of Beauty, ioyn'd with pompe, and Maiesty. Epi. 140. Marcus Antonius (as Plutarch shoes) Commanding Cleopatra to appeare Before him (sith she succored his foes) She came in pompe (as one that had no Peere) Along the Riuer Cydnus in a Gallion, The Poope whereof was all of masty Gold; And vnderneath the like most rich Pauillion She lay her selfe, more rich a thousand fold. Surrounded with sweet Singers; and, with all, The heau'nlist Instruments that Songs could grace; Her Seruants clad in Robes maiesticall Brodred with Pearle, t'wixt richest Golden-lace, Thus came she gliding, on the Siluer Streame, Forced with siluer Oares, and silken Sailes; (Crowned her selfe with deerest Diadem) Towards Anthony; with whom she so preuailes That she Captiu'd him, being Conquerour; For, she on Beauties Priuiledge did stand (Consorted with this Wealth, Port, Pompe &amp; Pow'r) That She Commands him, that did her Command. But though she made this Pagan much transgesse; Some Saints in shew, do oft much worse with lesse! Against Marcus his insatiablenesse, and basenesse in his leachery. Epi. 141. So deerely did Darius still esteeme Of his night-pleasures, that his Bed was spred Like a Pauillion; ouer which did seeme A Vine to grow, all Gold enamelled! Which as an Arbour, did the Bed inuolue; The Grapes whereof were Pearl as big as Plumbes; Whose price was more than Algrim can resolue; His Pillowes value worth vnualued Summes! Yet Marc had rather lie with's Drab (thogh s?ck) In Straw, than in this State, without his Punck. Of making Aurum potabile. Epi. 142. Lapis Phylosophorum, nor (as yet) Quinta-essentia could e're well be made: But Aurumpot-abile (being wet) Many drie Wags do make; and then doth vade; For, in proiecting Tauernes (night, and day) Gold oft to liquer runnes, to run away. Of Florus his holsome Tongue. Epi. 143. Florus, did once affect the name of Man; And then he fought a Virgin-fray; since when Hee hath fresh-ayr'd it so, with his Tongues Fan, That it is now as fresh as it was then. But since that priuat fights so fatall grew, That one, or both must die, or lye by it; (As Hell and vengance) he doth such eschue; And, on his Manhoods old-Store, liues by Wit. But yet his Tongue is potent, full of spight, That all Affections (tame or wild) commands; And therein now consists his greatest might: So, hath his Tongue the valour of his blands: A good and gratious Tongue hath Florus then, Sith it will rather make, than marr good-men. On the gaging of Fumus his Iewell by his man. Epigram. 144. Fvmus, looks vp his wife, as is the guize Of the Italian; and, doth put a Lock Vpon her Iewell; sith he deere doth prize What, being abused, base doth make his Stock: But his Mans Key still opes it, who can do well; So, opes the Lock to gage his Masters Iewell. On Light bright Lucilla her white going. Epigram. 145. Lvcilla, lightly all in white doth goe, To lay her Chastity a whiting so. Of one speaking ill of me before many. Epig. 149. One, before many, spake but ill of mee. Yet rather I had one spake ill (alone) Of mee, to many, that indifferent be, Then many so should speake, before but One. On Fugus his cooling his flaming fury with discretion. Epi.. 150. That Fugus, in a Duell, hotly fought, Is no great wonder, being so well wrought By his too busie foe: but, that he flew (Without wings) from the field, is scarsely true: It was no flight from fighting with his foe; He did but walke to coole his fury so. That the men of these new times, are much wiser then those of the old. Epi. 151. In old time, men were much less wise than now; For, but with good they then could hinder ill: But now, men (wiser growne) doe well know how To let one Mischiefe with another still. From more great, then good men, good Lord deliuer me. Epigram. 152. Of our great-men Ile speake nor good nor bad, For, speak I good, thats' more than wel I know If ill I speake; perchange I may be made To rue it; Then, go by Ieronimo. How Fortune fauourd ill fauour'd Marcus, Epigram. 153. As Marc beneath his Maiesties Window past, She spitting out, by chance, it trickt him trym: When, had she seen his lookes, she would haue cast They were so foule: so, Fortune fauour'd him! Dicers are worse than Userers: and why. Epigram. 154. Dicers are worse than Vserers: for, these But ten get with an hundred: Dicers cast An hundred in with ten: But some do leese Thousands to One: whose Bones make Dice at last! Where Rollus his late rich widow (now his proud wifes) eares grew. Epigram, 155. Rollus a Widow woo'd; but, t'would not be; She still held out, to keepe him lowly in: Then downe at last he fell vpon his knee For grace vniting, which he (so) did win: So then, he well perceau'd, (which now he feeles) His haughty Widdowes Eares were at her Heeles! Beares baited loose is, the worst of loose sports: and why. Epigram. I like not (of loose sports) Beare baitings play; Sith Beares, broke loose, teach men to run away. On Parnus, Borrowing and Paying. Epigram. Parnus (in debt) workes out the Saboth day: So owes, and borrowes of the Lord, to pay. On much-promising hopefull (yet vnhelpfull Lords, Epigram. Lords, promise soone; but, to performe, are long; Then, would their Purse-stringes tyd were to their Tongue. On Cosmus great want in great wealth and wasting in sparing. Epigram. There needs no Cesterne where a Fountaine is; Yet Cosmus hoords vp wealth, although hee knows No end therof: so much the worse for this: For, though his Fount, &amp; Cesterne still or'eflowes, Nought runs to wast: yet all he wasts, with scath, That he pounds vp, who wanteth what he hath! Iests, and iibing Answeares. Epigram. 97. A mastife, in a Frosty morn did, run At witty gamesome Gallus; but he bowd Some stones to take, but (frozen) tooke vp none: Then (being Crost) thus Gallus curst alow'd; Pox on't (quoth he) while that dog tare his hose, Where Stones are tyde, and Ban-dogs be so loose. Of one that refused to lend friend 20. nobles, when he sent to him for it with, and without a sure Token. Epigram. 157. A gamster borrow'd fiue pound of a Friend; which lost, he sent to him for fiue pound more By'th' Token he fiue pounds before did lend: But he refused vtterly; and swore That not a Mite, of him should more begotten Vntill he truely had receau'd that Token. Of a Crook-back that desir'd an vpright Iudge to right his wrong. Epi. 158. A crook-back praid a Iudge to right his wrong Where to the Iudge replid, I would I could: But (O!) you haue been wrong your selfe so long, That now I cannot right you, though I would. Of Luce, and her Leuity. Epigram. 159. Of faire light Luce, a Thing was sought, by one: But she withstood him; and, withall, she said, Had she a hundred Things she should haue none. But I haue known (quoth he) since you were Maid When hauing but one onely Thing in store, You let an hundred vse the same end more. Of a Single ey'd Fencer his blind match. Epigram. 160. A Fencer, with one Eye, desir'd to play For th' other: which another would not do; (As he had reason:) for, though it were day, He could not stake, and see to play well too. Of Tullus his disprouing a Tailors Will. Epigram. 161. Braue Tullus made a Suite of trym Attire; For which his Tailor brought him in his Bill Who therein so did Crosse his due desire, That he did quite disproue the Taylors Will: Who, in a fume, thus said, he neuer knew Any braue Gentile deale so like a Iew! Of Drusus his guift in reuersion taken too soone in possession. Epigram. 102. When I leaue off this Sute which now I weare, (quoth Drusus to his Man) Ile giue it thee: But when, at night, he vncasd him (without feare, Of his Sutes losse) his man, that promis'd Fee, Soone seis'd vpon; and, wore the same: but, lo, His Master chast he was so sawcy growne; And askt him, what he meant to serue him so? Why Sir (quoth he) I do but weare mine owne: For, when you left them off, you promis'd me They should be mine: and so they are you see. Of the Sacrifice of Lent. Epi. 163. A country-parrish (Westward-ho) call'd Lent, By chance was set on fire, and burnd amayne; One askd the name thereof, as by he went; T'was told him Lent: who streight replide againe, Fridaies and Saturdaies (that make vs wither) Pray'ye put in too, and burne them altogether. Against fighting in fashion. Epi. 164. If thou wouldst fight in fash'on, now, thou must Scorne all defence as Valors onely shame; And come vp close, that Brest to Best may iust, Vpon no guards, but at the Heart to ame. This is the fashon'd fight this Time affords, For (Switzer-like) we fight for (senelesse) spoile: Then all as good to fight with Kniues as Swords, Sith all Defence doth but our honor foile! Then Fencers, wherto serues your fencing-skill Which you stile Noble science? you (I thinke) Should, to the Parliament, prefer a Bill T'repeale this Act of Custome, least it sinck: For, Custome, and the Deuill, do men perswade To damne th?selues, by fight, to spoile your trade.

Madge once set Hodge to watch when Puddings plaid That on the fire were seething in a Pan: Boy, play they now (quoth she?) not yet (he said) At last they, boyling, brake, and all-out ran. Lad, play they yet (qd she) quoth he yong (Goose) They now play all (like Gepsies) vast and loose. So, chaft, why chaf'st qd she? why, quoth the Elfe? To zee a Pudding creepe out of himselfe. Of a Maids light hearing. Epi. 168. I haue heard of you, Claius, said a Maide; O, but (quoth he) recant what you haue saide, Least you be shent: for, if you heard of me T'was in a Bawdy-house, where euer be Those I conuerse with: then if there you heare Of me, or of mine Actions, it is cleare You are too blame to hearken for me, so, Wher Maids ne're come, but Whoores away they go.

Of Quacus, his cooling his heate with Whey. Epigram. 170. Quacus, drinks nought but Whay, himselfe to coole, Yet loues a Drab, as nought by Wine, he drunk So, with his Bable, still he plares the Foole, To make his wife, to weepe, to laugh, his Puncke; But, were I her; I would not foole it too, To weepe, but laugh; yet, for him, euer Doo. Epigram. 177. A Wife, whose Husband lay a Bed diseas'd, Went with his Water (scarse conceal'd from To seeke for help, or how he might be eas'd, (vew) And meeting with another wife she knew, Who with her there did then expostulate, About what then she bare, and how she far'd: Who told her straight, it was her Husbands State; And went for help for paine about his Yard: Hath he a Yard (quoth she) and Cupids Martir? O! you are blest: would mine had but a Quarter! But, she should haue a Yard her Back to mete, For playing so, her Quarters in the Street. Of Rampa, and her fowle trading at the Faire. Epigram. 172. Rampa, the Sempster goes to Faires a pace To sell her ware; and, so, to mend her Case: But, there her case is mar'd; for on each pack, Shee, packing loosly, proues a naughty-pack. The while, at home, her husband keeps the shop; And of that Faire sowne seed still reapes the Crop. Of mine Ouerseer. Epi. 173. My o'rethwart neighbor though, for debt, by night He scarse dares shew his scalp; yet builds so hie (With quarter staues) as he orelooks me quite; So, hee's mine Ouer-seer ere I dye. Then shall my Will, to Ill, still foreward run; For, he hath hornes, of powr to see that done. Of Homouthius his chast adultery. Epi. 174.

Of Hornsbie's Incredulity. Epi. 175. Tell Hornsby (that doth keep a Tabling-house) His Wife too fast doth bear men in his Tables Heele not beleeue the same for twenty Nobles; No, though he see't, yet dumb is as a Lowse: For, should he speak his liuing quite would faile, Sith all he hath he holds but by the Tayle. Against the faith, hope, and charity, of our yoeng Maister Hal. Epi. 176. Young Hal is wanton, with expectance still, And, longs to haue his Sire curb'd of his will By vnexpected death; that, so, he might Be Heyre of all; and be an arrant Knight: And so he may; for, of him proofe I haue, He may bee errant Knight, or arrant Knaue.

Of Nais her keeping an Ordinary and her being ordinary. Epi. 178. Nais keepes and Ordinary, and entertaines (like Uenice) all Gods good, or Diuells Ills: Protestants, Papists, Brownists, Puritanes, Hand ouer Hip-well shee their Bellies fill: As some doe hers; yea, in her husbands sight; So, with his leaue, shee dubs him Uulcans Knight. Againe. Epi. 179. Nais still doth vaunt she is a Gentle-wo-man; It's true; for, shee in loue refuseth no man: Then, why do I so much misname her, Nais, That is to men so sparing of her Nayes? Againe, for a parting blow. Epi. 180. Naies keeps a house of carding, but, nere spins, (Yet, often relies) vnlesse it be the webbs Of others woes: She, (lately lowe) begins To rise apace: so, Flouds do follow Ebbs: She needs not, now, to ply Wheels Reels, or Rocks Her Guests and Gamesters do so ply her Box. Of Pagus the Pedagogus proud all-tong'd-Daughter. Epi. 181. Pagus, the Pedant, learns his daughter Greeke, Hebrue, and Latine: nor is she to seeke In Spanish, French, and the Italian, Douch, Danish, Spruce, and the Slauonian: Yea, Verses makes in all these. Wondrous thing! That any man a maid so vp should bring, While he commits Idolatry with her. Which makes her scorne her mother her should beare, Or he beget her (proud foole!) yet, I say, When Sires doe play the Puppies, Puppies may. Againe of his vncharitable prayer. Epi. 182. When Pagus Pupills play the wags, hee bringes Them in his prayer, which he, saying, sings: So for their pennance, plagues them in pure prayer As if a murraine yet, were in that Ayre: For, all his houshold, so, doe know their crimes; For which Clock like he strikes, and after chimes: Then praying thus without pure charity, His prayer turnes to pure iniquity. Of Roring Neds endlesse Ende. Epig. 193. The wise-man Pogg, shewes needy roring Ned (Who often blood hath brocht, &amp; often bled) His endlesse ende: which (well) he cannot choose; For all may see 'twill be an endlesse Noose. A hard choyce. Epi. 184. I faine would marry; but, more faine liue sole, Though without wife, I am but halfe my whole: For, man and wife one body make; and some By marrying, marre two Bodies. I am dumbe, Or, know not what to say: For, this good-naught Makes me a fickle Sheptick in my thought: Yet, when I meane to wed, Ile leaue their Schoole, And, to be held more wise, play more the foole. Of a Curat's hauing two wiues at once giuen him in marriage. Epi. 185. A Parson, that one only Daughter had Match'd her vnto a Curat; but was glad To giue, for lack of Portion to lay downe; A Benefice, he held beside his owne.

With which two wiues he liues, with much ado; The Teithe of one being Dowry to the two. Of rich Rooke his kitchen-phisick against Vertigo. Epi. 186. Rich Rooke eates bitter Almonds, as a Trick To keepe downe Fumes, e're to the wine hee w?ds And, so, he drinks til he with healths, be sick; So, bitter Meanes haue, thus, more bitter Ends: But if this bitternesse had turn'd to hony He would haue sunck the World with Meath for money. Of Flauias paynting; and, playing the Squirell. Epigram. 187. Flauia is faire; yet paints her selfe: oh strange, That true, to feined Beauty so should change! She brauely goes; and yet her Case is thought Bare, as her Pin-case, worne, with Pins, to nought: For, she for Coyne (Like Uenice) takes all Nations To exercise, in her, their Occupations; While she goes (like a Countesse) in her Vaile; So, (Squirrell-like) she's couer'd with her Taile. Against Kit's weake wooing of Kate. Epigram. 188. Kit, art a Man? yet, get Kate canst thou not? Oh shame! sith with a Child she late was got. Of Fuluiaes recreation, and occupation. Epigram. 189. Fvluia, for recreation (as she sweares) Danceth each day, as she were made therefore; The while her Dancing-Mate so charms her eares That soone she is bewitch't to play the whore: So she (good hows-wife) turnes her Recreation (Which takes vp all her Time) t'an Occupation. On Phraxus his euer-secret passions. Epigram. 190. Bvt of his secret Passi?s Phraxus speakes To his deere Mistresse, while his griefe she mocks Sith probably she weenes (sith so he breaks) His greatest secret Passion is the Pox. Of Barbus his triall of a foolish conclusion. Epigram. 191. Barbus, by night, once reading in a Booke That broad Beards argu'd folly; tooke a Glasse And Light, with all, vpon his own to looke; Who burnt it, when he saw how broad it was: Then, in the margent, for this earnest iest, He verily may write Probatum est. Of the goodnesse and necessity of Phisitions. Epigram. 192. Some hold Phisitions well may spared be In eu'ry State where men, in order, liue; VVith whose opinion I can ne're agree; And I haue reason too; which thus I giue; If they were spar'd, then Men would (like a floud) O'rewhelm the VVorld; Phisitions then are good. Of their Deerenesse. Epi. 193. Like Haukes, Phisitions euer are esteem'd; VVhich as they kill Thrush, Partridge, Duck, or Crane Are priz'd thereafter: so, is euer deem'd Phisitions skill by those they kill, or bane. If but poore Clownes or Trade-men they destroy, Th' are held of small accompt: if Lords, or Earles, Then more much, more: but if they skill employ To kill a Prince, th' are held as deere as Peales: Then all Phisitions, that would faine be deere, Employ their skill (at least) to kill a Peere. On trauersing the error of an Action. Epigram. 194. One Lawier once an others wife did woo That she with him would enter action too: The issue ioyn'd, the husband wronged so (Seeing th' intruder quite his wife o're thro) He right well swing'd them both for that compaction: So, Canuased the error of their Action. Of Poggius his poore successe in Palmistry and wooing Epigram. 195. Poggius (whose skill in Palmistrie is poore) Tooke vp his Mistris hand, therein to pry; Then said (and therewithall he sighed sore) Sweet, all my fortunes in your hand doth lye: Then safe Ile keep them for, and from you too, Quoth, she againe; so, he for nought doth woo. Of true Loue. Epi. 196. True Loue's in talke, and in society; The rest, can Asses do aswell as wee. Against the corrupt iudgement of Bullus in choise, of his Wife. Bullus hath chose his wife but with his Eyes; And left his Eares, lest they should them controule, So she plaid faire in sight th?; now, he cries His choyce, before his Choosers, playes him foule: If foule she play, and he doth see the same, His Eyes, and not his Eares, are still too blame. Of the Bastard Fluctus his beeing vndone by his Drab. Epi. 197. Fluctus his doing Drab did him vndoe: And so a Drab hath made and mar'd him too. Of roring Robulus his bloudlesse combats. Epi. 198. Some men fight brauely without brauing word But roring Robulus ne're fighteth so; Who euer braules; but, neuer drawes his Sword; Or, if he do, puts vp without a Blow: Yet, he being round with all, (not round to smite) Ciphers their Number that will roundly fight. Of Rufus his giuing the lie, without a Stabbe. Epigram. 199. Rvde Rufus to his Mistris gaue the lie; For which she did protest Reuenge, with speed: But She no reason hath for that; for why? When women lie, they stand men most in steed. Ioan's as good as my Lady. Epi. 200. Ioane in the Darke's as good as my Ladie; But I know a Ioane farre better in Light: Yet Ile not deny but my Lady may bee As lusty (at least) as Ioane in the night. Of Gauffus his mis-matching his matchlesse faire Daughter. Epiram. 200. The Grazier Gnuffus match'd his daughter late To no great rich, though ancient, gentleman The good old man (according to his State) Loues-duties paies her, yearely (as he can) But sith She spends so fast, she pines (I feare) For want of Commings in her Charge to beare. Against a foolish Pratler. Epi. 202. Thy Tong's so loose and light, that eu'n thy breath Makes it so wagge as it nere still doth stand; Whose fustian Strains work Apprehensions Death: For, neither sad, nor mad them vnderstand. Of our English Gallants-going in blacke in Lent. 203. Ovr Gallants euery Lent go al in black As if with time they mourn'd for their offence But their life shewes it's but to hide the knack Of subtill lightnesse clokt with greate preience: Then, were it but for that, they black should weare Sith they are not so good as they appeare. Of Poets beeing deiected. Epig. 204. Some Lands there are where men are without heads: Some, all hermaphrodits; some where the seeds Of men are black as Inke: Some, where they hie Without feet: Some, where they haue but one Eye Plac'd in their forehead, hauing heads like dogs: Some, where they are halfe fish; &amp; liue (like frogs.) In, or about the Waters: Some, where they Haue brows so hard that no steel pierce them may. Some wher m? ch?ge to wolues &amp; beasts more vile And they resume their shape they had ere while. Some, where they mouthlesse are, and liue by smel: Some, wher their length lacks halfe of halfe an Ell: Some, where they Giants be: Some, where they are Foure footed, hayrie, and like Beasts do fare. Some, where they haue a Foote of such extent That from the Sunne it shrouds then like a Tent: But Time nor Place such men could euer show, That liue quite hartlesse as most Poets now. Of Womens Metamorphosis according to time and place. Epigram. 205. Some Women are in Churches Saints, or more; Angells abroad; at home too like the Diuell: At Windowes, Syrens: Parrots, at the Dore: And in their Gardens Goats, or more vnciuill: Yet tradesmen that nere match til they haue much, In deadly danger are to meet with such. Tis merry, when knaues meet. Epi. 206. Conceipted youths, when they at wine are met Mong other matters lightly they inquire What well pend Pamphlet lately out is set? What merry Epigrams or soure Satire? Then fall they to repeat some sugred Lines Of this or that mans: When some lustfull Gull, Comes in with Nashes choosing Ualentines; To wit, his Dildo knowne to euery Trull. I come (saith he) sweet Linnen by thy leaue; (O good, ifaith, (saith one) then on hee goes) Softly my fingers vp their Curtaines heaues: And there Gomorrahs filth (at full) he showes. All that can say this as their Pater noster Haue seene the Lions, sweet well seasoned youths About the Muses Minions still they muster To get some swelling lines to fill their mouthes: But for their owne Muse it doth euer sing, Rime without Reas'n a common English thing. Against Balladders. Epi. 207. Cherillus, that: of many verses, made Seauen only good: for which his poesie He had seauen gobbes of Gold; and for the bad, He had a buffet on the Uisnomy: If Balladers, that but defloure the Muse, Were so rewarded for their versifiing. It would (like Pan) appeare vpon their Browes, Sith out of tune they doe so often sing: For if seauen lines they chance to draw aright, They milli?s make that would make Patience smite. None can be sad and glad at once; if it be not in contrition. Epi. 126. Stella, the Padua Poet, pleasant was; Pox on't, how Puppie-like, with P. I play: Asse for example: fye, away with Asse, Asse, cannot set a Sample (I dare say) He writes so ill: and so those Poets doe That will at once write light and heauy too, For, at one time whose Muse is light and sad, I muse not though his Muse doth write as mad. Of and against the word creepe. Epig. 209. Creepe, is a Metaphor that's euer vs'd In controuerted questions of our faith; Wherein the word (orevs'd) is much abusd; For, this Schisme then crept in, th' opponent saith. Though Creepe bee most significant to show How Errors came in slowly, more and more; Yet so to spur-gall Creepe to make it goe still on that errand, shewes our Tongs too poore, Or Wit's too bare: But now such questions deepe, Do run abroad too fast they doe not creepe. Of the power and price of gold. Epi. 110. O gold (the Darling of this later Season, Sole Load-starre to all hearts, Star to all eyes That canst doe all without or Rime or Reason) How blest are they that most doe thee surprise? By thee the iealous husband is appeased; The desperate Riuall is well pacifi'de: By thee, the watchful'st Keepers soone are seisd; By thee, th' vniustest wrongs are iustifide: By thee, the Uestall, true Wise, Widdow, Trull Are bought and sold: the noblest Lady too, Will wiue a Mony-Bag, if huge, and full, Who know their seruice, then, poore Knights will do. By thee each Lock is pickt, each Gate flies ope; Nay more; thy crowns can mightiest kings vncrown By thee, all things beaneth the heau'nly Coape In Natures pow'r, are rais'd, or ouerthrowne: Nay more, the very Lord of all this All (Who can no more beguile, than be beguil'd) Was sold for money; and a sum but small; So, thou art Dominus fac totum Stilde. Yet run'st from me in Earnest, and in Game, Though oft I write with thee, to spread thy fame! Againe of the same. Epi. 211. The great'st are caught with Gold: for, giue me It, Ile, make the Great'st my fri?d with little wit: But once if Gold and I at variance be, The Great will scorne; the Small, abandon me Though Wit and Grace I had: for, VVit, &amp; Grace Are precious made with Gold: els both are base! Against Plumus his foolish pride. 212. Plumus is high, yet higher is his Heart: Lands, Plate and Coyne he hath; yet hath he more; More Lands than Wit; more Coyne and Plate, than Art: And yet the Arts (he sweares) he doth adore: Hard-hearted Arts, that for his kind good will, Permit base folly his high Heart to fill. Of my incountring a Wag-taile, while I held my tongue. Epiram. 213. VVhy fliest thou Muse, at Fame, that flies from thee? Or seek'st to retriue that thou canst not trusse? Spare, spare thy Paines, &amp; after Angels flee, That make their Takers Great, as Glorious! As at a Stationr's Shop I stood, at gaze, There chanst to light a Wag-taile (light as fine) And ask'd for Epigrams in Caged Phraze: VVherewith the Shop-man foorth-with shew'd her mine. VVhat he (quoth She?) th? pull'd her mouth ascue) Alasse (good man) is this his Poetrie? Yea (said my friend) th? from her them she threw, As if she felt them touch her honesty. Still saying, He? yea, (said the seller) he; And good they be, or else good VVits mistake That hold them such; So let them be (quoth she) And, therewith all, another mouth did make. Thus by a mouth so wrested quite awry, Had I like sentence: meane while mute I stood (Poore Innocent) and durst not aske her why She so did sleight them that were held so good: For, they are still defil'd that Pitch do touch; So, I forbare to touch this filthy Thing, Although She made mee swell, and grieue, and grutch; Vowing this bitter wayward VVaspe t'vnsting: But tis not possible I should preuaile; For, spight of me sheele haue it in her tayle. My Corollary. But yet her pride, exprest with such disdaine, Humbled me much, that lookt for much applause: That Puttocke made me Peacocke vaile my Traine; And thought her sent of purpose for that cause: Thus waxt my mind more sweet b'her bitter doom And so, sometimes the bad do better some! Of roring boyes Resolutions. Epi. 214. The roring Boyes exclaime against their Peter, And say, he dide not as he liud a space: Who melted at his death like Sheltons Meeter That's harsh; but yet inclinde t'a little grace: But he that holds it out, when he is in (In Newgate) till they be at Tiburne trust, Like a true Diuell: (whose grace is all in Sin) This man, in their accompt, is onely iust: But, if at last to grace he once but yeeld, Hee's like a Boy, and dide but like a Child. Against carnall desire. Epigram. 215. O damd Desire, what spirit hath thee inspir'd, That (like the Moone) dost waxe and wane in change Afflictions water c?not quench thee, fir'd: Nor loathd Disease estrange thee from the strange Thy pleasure's but a moment (if it bee A pleasure which so soone to Paine doth turne.) And thought it wasts the Marrow feeding thee, Yet stil thou burn'st while thou hast ought to burn Thine heate is hatefull (falsly called loue) Made by the motion of the fowlest Mynd: For when thou dost thy sweetest pleasures proue, They cloy, but not content thee: so, behind Thy pleasure rests: which thou (tir'de) canst not try; So, thou art made but weake, not holpe thereby. Against Chione her feeding on fat Woodcocks. Epigram. 116. O Chione thine Eyes all Eyes do feast, Thy Lake-laid Cheekes excel the reddest Rose; Thine Iuory Front, and Alabaster Brest Do men entice, as Carion ticeth Crowes: I see great men thou drawst; and smile to see How thou dost plume on them, and they on thee. Against Aglaope, her sweete voice, and sow'r vice. Epigram. 154. Aglaope, (that courted is of States, Whose Angells voyce the Angells imitates) Still lullabies all mortall Cares asleepe, Such due proportion still her voice doth keepe; But yet her voice (as voice of People goes) Doth nought but (Siren-like) worke people woes. Of Phagus his being a Papist inward. Epigram. 218 Phagus his Panch is grown beneath his knees, So many fat Recusants he deuours; But does it but for good, the World well sees: That's for good Cheare, as long as life endures: Than sith he feeds on sheepe Catholicall! His Guts (at least) are most papisticall! In defence of Womens well clothing and dressing themselues. Epigram. 219. Gamphalantes, (that naked Libians are) Liue peaceably (poore Soules) sith bare they be: Adam and Eue the while they naked were, They liu'd (good Soules) in great tranquillity! And yet while men are bare, they liue in peace, As hauing nought wherewith to vex each other: But women being bare, men would oppresse And so insult vpon them altogether: That makes all wo-men couet still good Clothing, Lest men should fall to Lusting or to Loathing. Of Knights of famous memory. Epigram. 220. Of Cirus thus the Histories report He knew his Soldiers names by memory, Although they were (almost) a countlesse sort, Yet he by name knew all that Company! T'was strang (wer't done by Nature or by Art.) But some Knights of my knowledge can do this; Let any Pezant dwelling in that Part, At New-yeares-tyde, but of a Present misse Thei'l know him after twenty yeares (perhaps) (O memory of rare continuance!) Poore Pezant be thou ware of After-claps: For, thou art well remembred with a vengance: Such Art of memory such Land-Lords vse, As Capon-cram their kitchins with their Muse. Against telling of incredible Truths. Epigram. 221. Sooth-sayer Accius, in Tarquins fight, they say, Did with a Razor forthwith cut in two A Whet-stone; which I thinke (as well I may) Is wondrous hard for men of God to doe: And if a man somewhere should this maintaine He sure should haue the Whet-stone for his paine. Then better leaue (sometimes) some Truths vntold Least some men should true men for lyers hold. Against Canizius his witty familiarity. Epigram. 222. Canizius hath a fine face't conceipt; A pleasant Wit, but most vnprofitable: To Cheate by Rules of Arte he hath the fleight; And there withall he is most affable; For in a Howre, aswell as in an Age, Familiar growes, and shewes his Consenage! Of Aristotles faith concerning womens flesh. Epigam. 223. Aristotle, (who had no common VVit) Thought comm? women should haue adorati?: For, he t'his Hermia performed it; Yea, sacrifiz'd to her with veneration: If all his Doctrines were like this, I knew, His true disciples would not be so few. Of Dawlus his finding of a light Iewell in the Darke Epigram. 224. Dawlus, vpon his Way, late, in the Darke, A Iewell fo?d, which eu'ry man Might weare. T'was full of Spirit; nay more a firy Sparke, That stood, t'enflame Desire of Vseing, There: It was a precious Punck, yet seem'd too cheape, But found too deere: for, while he Cultur'd her And therein sowing, She his Purse did reape Growne to the full'st; and Inn'd it other where. And so, at once his Crime and Crosse he bore For Closing in a Common to the poore: Nay, sure, his Crosses She did all ingrosse; For, for his paines, She left him ne're a Crosse! Of the best Playmakers deere-bought praise. Epigram. 225. Play-wrights your Trade is tickle, full of toile; For, you are bo?d to please the thwartest Minds Who (like cros-seas, that rough Winds stil turmoile) Tosse vp &amp; down your praise, with various Winds! It's easie to cry Hisse; but, tis not so To silence it, and Claps of hands to raise: Not as at brawling Dogs, where both VVe do; But into Claps, that Clap vp all with praise. Those whom yee trade with, weigh your skill and paines By their owne gaines; &amp;, though al three be great, They weigh not you according to their Gaines; But by your Skils, that Fame and Famine get: Then of all Glory, purchas'd by the small, A Play-wright, for his Praise, payes most of all! Against Iustice Boniface his iniustice. Epigram. 226. Though Iustice Boni-face do lack much law, Yet lacks no lawlesse skil huge Bribes to draw So, sells, he Iustice for a currant Fee, That all may Iustice currant from him see: If all his Iustice currant be, like this; He may passe currant where nought currant is. Against the maner of our moderne Duells. Epigram. 227. Stay Gallants; run not on, with wrong too rife; Away with this damn'd Custome which ye vse: Ist not inough to venture Soule and Life On Ualors tearmes, and no man to refuse? But must I come vp too, vpon no Guards, That Bulke to Bulke may iustle; (hit, or misse;) And they expos'd to scorne, that scorne not Wards; Are we turn'd Beasts to thinke vs Men for this? Sir, do your worst; here stand I That to dare, It I defendant bee: If Challenger; Haue at yee, with braue courage; yet with Care Of being Foild, that here but once can erre: If this no Manhood be, thus well to passe, I hold the brauest Man, the plainest Asse. Of my Foes and their dwelling. Epigram. 228. Most of my Foes dwell At the signe of Ierusalem betweene Strawberry Bancke, and Prim-rose hill. in Ierusalem; Th?, most are Turks, few Christians are with them. Of a letter in fauour, that prou'd an hinderer in fact. Epigram. 229. Paulinus, prai'd a friend, of noble Bloud, To write his Letter for a Benifice Vnto a Bishop for Paulinus good, VVhich he did to Paulinus preiudice: For, he writ coldly: so, the Letter prou'd A letter of the suite the Letter mou'd. On Glaius and bright Mistrisse Grace a Light-one, that lightened a worke of Darknesse. Epigram. 230. Grace in the Darke, stood full in Glaius way, Whose brau'ry (like the su) turn'd night to day She would not moue althogh she mou'd him much Nor speake; although he did her homely touch; Yea toucht her to the quick in Sinfull Case: So, Glaius quickly deadly sin'd with Grace. Of Signior Shancus his feeding vpon Weedes turn'd into good Meate. Epig. 231. Spruce Signior Shancus hath good Clothes, and Victle Escheated to him oft, (great Lord of Little) Yet oft, in sommer, pawns his winter-weeds; And them redeemes with those which Sommer breeds: So, makes great shift with smal; great cause (I think) His Clothes must yeeld him coyne, &amp; meate, &amp; drink: For, if, with Coyne he should redeeme his Clothing, He should be Somthing that shuld feed on nothing. So, Still should cry any food any feeding. &amp;c. On a worke of Supererogation. Epigram. 231. There is a place vpon this middle Earth, Wher men, that vs'd much fasting, oft did eate: There, certaine Tearmes of yeares they fed with mirth; And, honesty the Place did then entreat. But when an hous-wife, that was Catholik, Or too too Vniuersall, had set vp An Ordinary neere, for dull and quicke, Away went they, with her, to dine; and sup: T'was Charity to helpe a poore Begynner; And, for her gayne, in loue, to vse this Sinner. Of Vlalia's Uisitations. Epigram. 232. Vlalia, in a Choch, as bright as Sunn's, To visit Ladies goes from Place to place; And, as she goes, the thundring Chariot runnes To shew (as Phœbus doth) her bright-light Face: But, while she visits Ladies in pretence, She entertaines some Lords Incontinence. To Sir Iohn Harrington. Epigram. 233. I dare not say your Wit was wisedome pointed, When you in Aiax had your Wit annoynted: Sith by no small Fooles, yet accompted wise, Such straines of Wit are held but Fooleries: But, this I say, and say what well I wot, (Vlisses vpon Aiax plaid the Sot: For, what you put in Aiax, was more woorth, By odds, than what Vlisses then put forth. Of Faustine's plaine and pert well-doing. Epigram. 234. Faustine delights to dance, to Mask, and Mum, But while she either doth she doth agree (In sight, yet secretly) to Doo with some; Yet, so she doth that euery Eye may see She's a good Dooer: (badly-good) the whiles She ner'e deceaues those Eyes she so beguiles. Of Fuluia her high flying. Epigram. 235. Fvluia now flies abrod (flye high my Muse) Vpon the restlesse Wings of high Desire: She stoupes to none but Lords: for she doth vse To fly no lower, but flies ofter higher: She is wel born and bred; so beares to breed (seed) Braue Barns, full stuft with bright (though Bastard Of the Game call'd; Laugh and Lye downe, Epigram. 236. I see and laugh, still laugh at what I see, Democritus, therein I play thy Part: I see some Mad-dames, honest held to be, That oft in sport doe whore it, by their Art: Yet (meerely) seeme chast, till they be ny downe, So still I laugh to see them laugh and lye downe. Of the force of my Lo: Mayors Pageant. Epigram. 237. My Lord Maiors Pageant, though it be (I grant) Weake for inuention, (but of strong effect) Yet drawes some Mad-dames, like an Adamant, So light they be, and light Shewes so affect: No; tis no Pageant maks them thether go; But to be prest for Venus seruice so. Against saplesse Sottus his vnkind heate. Epigram. 238. A thousand pound a yeare, yet haire, nor heire, Hath Sottus; but still weares, a Coife, or Cap: If Man b'a Tree (turn'd vpward) and his Haire, Be as the Rootes; then Sottus hath no Sap In Winter: no; for Virgoes heate before Hath dride him, with a Pox, and will do more. On Sirrah and his Wife Sarahs false play with him, for his profit. Epigram. 239. Sirrah, come hither; let me speake with thee: hark in thine Eare; thy Wise plates false (they say) With thee at Tick-tack: Peace; ô silent be: She hurts thee not; yet winnes much by her play! A while a go, thou know'st, thou wast but poore; But, since, by false play she so much hath got That now thou keep'st the Woolfe well, from the dore; Though yet (perhaps, thou c?st not keep the Goate: For, she beares men a pace, (as rich as daynty) So still she wins, for thee, the Horne of Plenty! Of Gallae's too good agreement with me. Epigram. 240. Euen as a Glasse reflects a mans owne shape Vpon himselfe; so Galla doth to me; Sindes, when I smile; nay gapeth when I gape; And sigheth when I sigh; as one were we: But ô my mind this hollow Glasse suspects: Because she burnes as well as she reflects.

The best Kings Ire burnes more than Fire. Epigam, 253. When the darke Cloud of Princes secret hate Is ready to breake out, out Flies it then With lightning and lowd thunder, to amaze And quite roote out the hated Man from Men! Then as thou wouldst not die by thunder-claps, Incur no hate of Kings what euer haps. Uideo et taceo. Epigram. 254. As he that (ouer-curious) Bane receaues To know the quality and force of it, Dies, by that force, er he th' effect perceaues; (And worthy too, for fooling so with Wit) So, they that loue to looke too curiously Into the liues of Kings, their fault to know, Oft so oresee themselues, in what they see, That they, thereby, themselues quite ouerthrow! For, such as are not pleas'd with Phœbus Raies, That yeelds all comfort vnto all that liue, But needs must see how he his Beames displayes, And the whole Body, that such light doth giue: No maruel though they blind th?selues thereby; Then winck (with Sem) wh? thou dost faults discry, For, no Spie's in such danger as this Spy. To my deare Liege Lord King Iames. Epigram. 255. Vtopicall State-Writers (who doe pen With Idlenesse, and haue no inte-rest Nor knowledge in the rules that gouerne Men) New Models make of Rule, that still do rest On disproportion'd Ioynts of Regunent Of Nations different in their Rules extent: Which in the State off kindle quenchlesse fires: But thou rul'st right without these skyruy Squires. Againe to my Liege Lord King Iames. Epi. 256.

Against Sottus his long wronge knowledge. Epi. 259. It is vnmeet that Sense abroad should stirre, And (like a wanton Rigge) at randome run: But when her soueraigne Reas'n commandeth her Vpon some vrgent cause; which being done, T'returne with speed to her, that sent her out, T'informe her in her doubt's of good or ill: Then like a sober Hand-maid, keepe about Her Soueraigne Reas'n, to doe what else she will: But, Sot, his sense from Reas'n hath rangd so long, (And dotes on all) that all he knowes is wrong.

Cracus if thou did'st know, (but O thou breakst The heart of Knowledge with thine ignorance) how il thou gard'st thy faith, for which thou speakst Thou nere wol'st speak but with thy countenance: For that scar's babes: sith thou fightst (being stout) Better with swords than words: than face it out. Of false praise. Epi. 262. The praise of Arts, which ill we deeme, Like smoke goes out as soone as seeme: The rightest Seruingmen are the rightest Courtiers. Epi. 263. Courtiers may seruingmen be stil'd: what then? Then, cannot they serue God, for seruing men. How an Harlot is like Hell. Epi. 263. A Strumpet's like the vgly mouth of Hell, That night and day is open to receiue All sinners that will pay for sinning well; Which still she takes and oft the Poxe doth giue. Counterfeit Piety is double iniquity. Epigram. 264. Old Will vpon the Sabath will not lose A Sermon for his Dinner; yet (though pure) Cheates like a Deuill: for, about he goes, At play, all simple sinners to deuoure: He needs not then, at Sermons sit so ciuill For feare of hell, being an incarnat Diuill. Against powdered Haire. Epigram. 265. The Daies of old did Ashes vse to throw (In signe of meekenesse) on the h?bled Head: But now, in signe of Pride (in Heart, and Shew) Our Mad-dames cast sweet-powder in their stead: But they whose Tops are euer powder'd so, Their T????

Gallus found Galla (e're she quite was lost) Where Time &amp; Place betraide her to his lust: Yet first the faire-Maide his fowle offer crost, But he (like Ioab) stabb'd, as her he bust: VVhich she tooke patiently: how e're afraide: And so a Goate like Man the Maide dis-Maide.

Against Fuluiae's Transcendency. Epi. 271. Fvluia is brought to nought; then cannot she In the Predicaments comprized be, So, some, Transcendent she must be of force; But how that is, transcendeth my discourse: Yet now I ha't t'a haire; she doth transcend All that the Poxe can marre &amp; nought can mend. Against proud great-bellied Ventus, the Smell feast. Epi. 272. The word Maiestas, of these two compos'd Maior and Status, argues great estate: Then O, how vainely Uentus is dispos'd, To strut and looke as if he had no Mate: When (God doth know) that if his state be great, Its in his Panch with eating others meat. Against Vulpus his endlesse distinguishing. Epig. 273. Exact Distinctions breed perspicuousnesse; But many breed but loath'd Obscurity: This, Uulpus makes, to shew his nimblenesse; In arguing, to distinguish endlesly: VVhich if he do, but truth so to depraue, I'le prooue him without Logick but a Knaue: If this Stile be to common; him I'le make A learned Knaue for true distinctions sake. Poets gaine is Fame and Famine. Epigram. 274. The Poets proper Ensigne is the Swan Sole Bird of Phœbus: so it well may be; For, she doth sing before her death: so, Man (Turn'd Gull) call'd Poet, makes that melody: Because he sings before his death and Fame, So, perisheth, through want, to get a Name! Against the enuy of Muranus. Epigram. 275.

Against the bare Brests of too well cloth'd wenches. Epigram. 277. Why bare yee so your Brests, audacious dames? Is it to giue mens eyes a taste of that You yet do hide, t'augment their lustfull Flames? Or else to draw their tongues to wanton Chat? It seemes y'are hot, that so low naked go, And looke for cooling at some Vent below. No Kingdome to Content. Epigram. 278. Wilt thou be rich? then thy desire decrease; So shall thy wealth, in want, amaine increase. Spare, to spend; like thine owne friend. Epigram. 279.

Noble Notatus (ah) was lately found In a Burdello; but he kept him sound From all pollution: as the Sun doth gilde Many a Dung-hill without be'ng defilde; Yet sith Notatus Spirit his Flesh still shrouds, If he will Shine he must not line such Clouds. Against Vanus his effeminate going. Epigram. 284.

Against Phenenna'es painting her selfe. Epigram. 285. Phenennaes face (although a Counterfeit All painted o're) is still so kept from Aire With Maskes &amp; Chyn-clouts, that no sun can see't; Yet is She no lesse Fowle than Shee is Faire: Her Colour's faire (gramercie Colours sor't) But Fowle's her face, and lookes her selfe vnlike As now She lookes: that's of the fairer sort: Yet al her face, so slubberd, She doth slike: Which Ill, She colours well; yet all her grace Is but to lie, and lieth in her face. Againe, on the same Subiect. Epigram. 286. Botts on these Masks &amp; Clout; which now are set To hyde such Fronts that for such lyes excell; Well-colour'd Gorgons-made when Nature sweat Too much to hold her Working-toole too well: So, are but Natures shame, and Graces scorne; Yet in Charoches beare they, and are borne.

The full drawes dry, the empty casts aside. Against golden Asses. Epi. 288. Many men-Beasts go gilt now at all Peeces, who are at best, but Sheep with golden-fleeces: If that in Cholcos had beene of this sort, Iason had plaid the Sheepe ere Shipt him for't, Of Phisitions abyding at Bathe. Epigram. 289. Leeches, at Bath, for Wealth, not health do waite, So, come not to the Bathe, but to the Bayte. Of Flauia'es lookes after her fall. Epigram. 290. Flauia lookes feebly since she caught a fall: So, lookes as if She could not Doe withall. Against the wretchednesse of rich-men. Epigram. 291. The Griffons 'mong the Indians keepe their Mines Of Gold, yet they no vse thereof do make: So, a monied-Miser mid'st his plenty pines; And Money keepes for Monies only sake: Kept he a Whore as well, then Sin they would not: For, her he would not vse, and others should not.

Of Rutus his indifferency in Religion. Epigram. 293. Rutus holds all Religions; and in all He is of none; like a still slyding Bourne That takes all colours which therein doe fall It hauing none: then hee'l not burne but turne.

Downe with your Uardingales, Trulls out of frame (sick of the Fashion) for, they mount too hie: They hide your Wast: O no, they shew the same; That is; your Antick Superfluity: The time hath been, they did the heeles surround; But now they doe the head; and men must leane Vpon your shoulders, from the vpper Ground, To looke downe for your middle, without meane: Your Waste is shamefull then, sith it to hide, Your English Bummes are still so Frenchifide. Against promise-breaking. Epi. 298. Ventus doth promise much; yet stil doth break; So all his promises are great, and weake, Like Bubbles in the water (round and light) Swelling so great that they doe breake outright. Against the misery of rich Misers. Epi. 299. Varus shuts vp his Coyne from all with Sparrs; And, from himselfe, he locks it most of all: For all his Thoughts (too hard) like Iron Barres) Keepe it from him, so liues on pittance small: Hee hath not what he hath; wealth makes him want, Yet thinkes he still to last, being Adamant; If so he should, in cares that so excell, Hee's damn'd already: for hee's heere in hell. Of and against Pegus his oft change of faith: Epig. 300. Pegus is pleas'd his faith now thrice to turne, Yet ne'rethelesse is hot as fire therein: But, dares not hang; and, much lesse dares he burne: No; that's to lose but, he doth change to win: But, while he sought to win so, it ensu'th, His Tongue at Trey-trip plaid; so, lost his truth. Of one that stands silent. Epig. 301. The silenc'd Stander (yong graue Longebeard) Is lately trauell'd to disperce the Word In hugger-mugger, where he may be heard, Among the Brethren, that with him accord, Yet, being gon, he leaues his wife at home, With other Brethren standing in his Roome.

Of Sponguis his chewing the Cud. Epig. 303. One hundred nintie fiue strange sorts of Wine In Plinies time were extant, and in vse: Which subdeuided, did more sorts conteine; Whereof, when I to Spongius speake, he chewes: Liquorish Cud; and licks his Lips, as if His Mouth, did water after all the chiefe. Against Dauus his daring. Epig. 304. Dauus still sweares, his nature is so hot, He's ne're without a Quarrell; and, it's true, He's ne're without a quarrell to the Pot; But, others he, for feare, doth still eschue: So, with the Pot, though he doth quarrell ay, Yet at the Pot, for feare, makes neuer fray; But, paies for all, to shun it if he may.

Or, if a truer Cause should be asign'd, He purgeth so, for want of health of Mind. Against Clerus his darke dealing. Epig. 311. Clerus, of me, would needs be taught to write: But I was loath for feare his Purse was light: He gaue me airy VVords; and said he would VVhen I had taught him, turne that Ayre to gold. I taught him to write faire and renningly; VVho, for that cunning, paid me cunningly.

Betweene two Drabs I lye (with much adoe) Each night; yet lye in seuerall houses too: They (Starchers) neighbour me so neere, that I May well be said betweene them both to lye.

Of Rorers, soft speaking. Epigram. 327. Since Duells damn'd were, by a Souraignes doom The lowdest Rorers speake in eithers Eares: Yet dare not for their Eares to Calis roame, But, in the Streets, still end their Fraies, and Feares: So, by the high-way now, their Manhoods liue, Like Theeue that steale, in hope of a Repriue. Of Scalpus his Haires humility. Epigram. 328 Scalpus, his Haire apparent, leaues his Crowne, As fast as, in the Aire, doth Thistle-downe: But, This with Aire doth so; but That, with Fire, Becomes so humble, that would else aspire. Of Phrynas, huge-limbd Husbands Metamorphosis. Epigram. 329. What! Phryna, is your Pheare become your Maide? Make you a Woman of so huge a Man? Sets he your Ruffes for Cuffes, without your aide?

Epigram. 332 Of the Bird Rue, that beares an Elephant, Writes good Sir Iohn, surnamed Mandeuile; Encrease my fayth, deere Loue; for 'tis too scant To credit this; but yet, here, in this Isle, There be some Bride-wel Birdes that wel wil beare (How euer ill) huge Men as Mice they were.

Against fond as furious Frontus, his swaggering to regaine his pawn'd Apparell. Epigram. 334. The Brokers haue fond Frontus cloths as pledges, For Coyne to keepe his Corps in sweetest sinne: And beeing forfeited, he them besiedges With thundring oaths and blowes his cloaths to win: But they hold hard (hard horsons) without dread; So, Anuile like, endure the Hammer-head. Against Spongus, a plaine Farmers Bastard, that had gotten to be of a great Lords bed-chamber. Epigram 335. Spongus, what makes you so your Sire to scorne? Is it because he all in Frize doth goe, And you in golden coates, though ouerworne; That's cast Apparell of your Lords, or so? He honours you; you him in scorne forsake: So, makes an Idoll of a Golden-Asse; While you your selfe thereby a Diuell make.

Snap-haunce speakes quicke &amp; lowd; but stil amisse White powder then were best for him; for, when He spits his spight, but leaden stuffe it is, Which euermore annoyes the sence of Men: Th? Snap-haunce, cease to snap; for thy lowd so?ds: Do yeeld such noisom stuffe that sence confounds. Against Rufus the Appollo ger. Epigram. 337. Rufus, you write Appollogies to Cloud Your trechery with which you men delude; That, like a Cuttle, you may so, vnuiew'd, Abuse th' insipient plumbeus multitude: Than sith you knauishly thus Cuttleize; I may, lesse lauishly, thus Inkhornize. Against a Marchants as light as bright Wife, still wearing a great Chaine of Gold or'ethwart. Epigram. 338. See vou yon'd Merchants wife, in Satten clad? It is Lucilla, Light as Leuity. It cannot be, her Chaine must make her sad, It is so heauy past all grauity. Nay, more, she'l Car'd (that shewes her houswifery) Away her Pence, by Pounds; her Pounds, by scores To make her Light: O then t'was cleane awry To call her Light; for, Lightly, so be whores. That Stile's too foule for one so Faire and Rich: Than, better call her Fancy; or Proud-(.) Of my Selfe. Epigram. 339. A friend of mine reproud me, sith I was Too Busie in correcting Leehery; Saying I was too open.

Against the gallant Glossus his mis-measuring. Epigram. 342. Glossus is gallant, yet doth measure keepe; He eats and drinkes in measure; so doth sleep: He measures Lands in trauell; so doth Seas: In Measure he doth dance, toyles, takes his ease: Yet (Robin-Hood) metes, somethings might be left He metes Maid marions by the Bow, and Shaft.

Mintha (ripe Medler) would be medling still, With things that most concerne mee, by her will She vnder me would sain haue liu'd by doing Thinges in my house, for which she stil was woing: Her Lippes, and Hippes, in grosse, she offer'd mee For Fine, if so she might my Tenant bee. So, I should be her Tenant, and she mine, For no great Rent, but for too grosse a Fine: Soft Mintha, in some others house go prancke yee; Yours is an Ordinary; I'le none, I thanke yee.

A pretty Occupation! and were hee. Aliue, and here to sell his VVare, he might Gaine what he would, if his curst Diu'ls would be Pleas'd to make Men and Women faire and bright For, now men fairely play the women too; Then, for his gaine he might the Land vndoe: Nay, though they painted &amp; but borrrowed raim?t Tom, for his Diu'ls, should haue royall payment. Of Raggus and his proiect. Epigram. 349. Raggus, with open mouth pursues strange Proiects, And of the State, reuiles the Eye of wit; That, hauing open'd it, so many Prospects To worldes of wealth; yet, sees no benefit: Saw it as thou dost (Ragge) that so dost raue, It saw but how to play the Foole and Knaue: For with thy sight (at best) it would perceiue It selfe, and others how but to deceiue.

One Long being seru'd with processe to appeare, Appear'd forth with; but 'twas another where Than where he should: and so, for his contempt, Was taken by a writ, no place exempt: Then, quite beside himselfe, came all agast; Shewing, That was not Long that came at last. To a blind Har: Par: Epigram. 353. Some neighbour Nations when their Out-lawes flye, Hang vp their pictures which should them betide, So (for thou Out-law art in Poetry) Thy Picture I trust vp on Times backe-side. For which (too like it, without grace or wit) Thou martyrd'st me in thy Wits feeble fire: But shall I malice? no, I pitty it: Sith thou art worthy of no witty Ire: For, thy Lines weakenes all men wonder at, That (like a Parrat) prat'st thou wot'st not what. Eundem. A blinde Harper. Epi. 353. Yet with the Hornes of thy weake pow're (whose Roote) Goes through thy brows, but coms not ny thy brain Thou but'st at wales; but Ile say nothing to't, (Though I be Welsh) sith all thou dost is vaine: Thy best is but to filch from good Sir Iohn, Some Epigrams; whereof a Welsh is one.

Young Taurus, like his Sire doth fare &amp; doe, And, like his Wife doth beare as well as strike: That's done by nature; and, by nature too, Olde Taurus needs must get (this Calfe) his like. Against lame Hipp. Epi. 357. Old Hip; well, let him goe; he is not worth The talking of; yet setts himselfe still forth As if he were a man might weare a Robe, Although the old Scabbe, be as poore as Iobe. Nay, now I lye; for, Iob, though he had nought, Yet nought he ow'd; but, this poore pach is thought Much worse th? Nought with wrangling; he is (so) Poorer then Iob; for, Iob but scabs did owe.

Besides, you haue a Trick (as I heare say) When some Boote-makers come your Bootes to (try) You send your Man with them, elswhere, for pay; Meane while, like Mercury, with them you slie Straite to bespeake (oh Neate-skin'd Auarice!) A paire of New-boots, els-where, at that price. Against Passus his superfluity in want. Epigram. 362. Passus doth passe his Bounds in all he doth, In all he thinks, in all he saies, or writes: Nay, he's him selfe superfluous; yea, a Moath Of Common-weales; but not like one indites, Sith he consumes no Sense: for, thus he writ: Her corrall-lips of hue: Of hue; oh marke How hue, so plac'd, discoulor doth his wit; And, with a dull redundance makes it darke: Then sith that Hue the Sence slue senclesly, Against that Hue, with open mouth, I cry.

Blacke Iack is Brimfull of Religion; Yet games he night and day: VVhy, well Don Iohn If thou go'st right to Heau'n, th' hast found a way, Besides Good-works: for, all thy worke is play: But, so to play, no Soule nor Credit saues: For, still at Gleeke, is but a Gleeke of knaues. Of a merry World. Epi. 365. Lord! what a merry World is this now grown? Late call'd a Uale of Troubles and of Teares; The Temples-Marke quite puts the Sermon downe For great resot of Commons, Mad dames, Peeres. The World runnes all on Wheeles; for, as I went From Temple-barre to Bed-ward, was so barr'd VVith Rankes of Coaches, of such huge extent, That, as with ?Edons? prest, with me it far'd: For, for a ?Bor stoore? hardly found I Way Or if i did, t'was Edg-long, soild with Durt; ?Yet? In and Out I danc't a nasty Hay; And, glad I was I had none other Hurt: But, wisht each Coach had Carted the owner That all my mire (at least) had fall'n vpon her. To my dread Lord King Iames. Epi. 366. Deere Liege, should I applaud thy Parts, or Minde, I should but render thee thy Due: but yet The Concaue of a CROWNE my cause that wind Although thy Vertues were but counterfeit. And should I praise thee, past all Praises Pitch, Being thy Vassal though thou wert deuine, I should be thought to claw where it doth itch, ?Coynign? false praise on Stuffe that will not shine. But Kings may well deserue and haue best Parts; Yet haue not all the good some worser haue: Then where Defect declines thy deere Deserts, Hard by doth mount, what makes thee brightly braue For, Bounty, Clemency, and chast desire Aboue all Kings do make my King aspire. Againe in honour of him. Epi. 367. To speake by Weight; (that is, to weigh our words Before we speake) found Iudgement doth require To speake in N?ber, best with Wit accords: To speake in Measure, Reason doth desire: If then to speake in Number, Weight, &amp; Measure; Be with Wit, Reason, and Iudgement to speake well, Then, Uerse, with Cadence sweet, &amp; meetest sea-sure On choiest Subiect, doth all speech excell: Poets thus speake, and lawes for speaking draw; Then, the best Poet is a Speaking-law. To the High and Mighty, Charles, Prince of Wales. Epi. 368. Great-little Charles, made so by Time, and Place Yet times least glimpse thy place (at lest) doth grace Althogh mans greatnes, time to thee denies, Yet Grace, aboue Mans greatnesse, That supplies, But, maugre Spight thy Name and fame shall gaine A Place, and Name with Stars call'd great Charles-waine: Which stil I wish; &amp; who doth't not desire, Would they were nought as naught; or Tow in Fire. To the no lesse than most graue Counsellor of Counsellors, Thomas Uicount Brackley Lord Chancellor of England. Epi. 369. Y'aue past the Storms of Youth and Passion too; And now, in Calmes of Ages Hau'n remayne: Now sees your Soule most clearely what to doe; And those vndo that doe their Conscience straine: In Summe, for all (that may your glory spread) Your pain your Braine, to ease, &amp; please your Head.

To the true Patterns of Noblesse and Heroicall vertue, Richard Earle of Dorset, and Sir Edward Sackuill Knight of the Bath his most noble Brother. Epigram. 372. You Starres that in our States Spheare shine as bright As Suns fixt neere our Zenith, daying Night: Stil on such Dayes-eyes shine (though planted low) By Fortunes hand, as turne to such as you To be set open, when they (hid) hang downe Their heads for want of Grace to make th? known. I need not force the free; you shine on such, No Starres within our Hemispheare so much: So much for that; but this much more for you, (Though more you cannot haue then is your due) You, for your high Worthes Rayes, I'le Raise to be Castor and Pollux both to Heau'n and me. To the Right noble Lord, Theophilus, Lord Walden. Epigram. 373. My Cunning sooner shall my right hand leaue Than not to giue where once it did receiue: But, Golden Ayre to giue, for Golden Earth, Is lesse Materiall, and no cause of Mirth: Yet, Ca?use? of Mirth these Papers do infold: That I, in[illeg.], do gieue thee for thy Gold: But what, in earnest I would giue (with mirth) To thee, is glory; both in Heau'n, and Earth. To the Right Honorable Sir Francis Bacon Knight. &amp;c. Epi. 259. Thi' admired Sire was Wit &amp; Wisdomes Source, And thou his Sonne, resemblest him in those: Thy Hand is open; close is thy Discourse: For; much in few, thy thy Iudgement doth inclose. But, when thou art disposed to set ope A Flood of Eloquence, to Whast all Eares With head-long sway) vnto thine vtmost scope, When, stubborn'st Rocks of L?e?ts it ouerbeares: So, thou do'st grace the Law, as it doth Thee; But, of all Lawyers, Thou alone for me. To my much honored the Lord Hayes. Epigram. 375. Thou do'st the Court Lord too much grace, To be forgotten in this place: Where I desire to praise such Ones As (worthy) are Court-Minions. Then, this thou art (I dare auouch) A Good, Great Courtier (seldome such!) That's honest with due Complement; Which is most noble in extent: Heere, sith no further Grace, hath gon, He put a Prick. To driue It on. To my Noble, highly valued friend, Pupill, and Alyes Man, Sir Edward Herbert, of Montgomery, Knight of the Bath. Epi. 376. Sith thou thy Name and Nation honorest With Worth (like Britains Crown) past price at least, Giue me leaue (least worth of thy least Alyes) To tell the World thus much, and then it dyes: For, in this World, where Grace doth liue by Sin, Can nothing liue that is not dead within. To my honorable, ingenious, worthy, friend, Sir Iohn Constable, Knight. Epi. 377. Didst thou but know (deer Knight) how much my heart Desires to Stellifie thee for thine Art: And what e're else by Worth can be possest, Thou would'st beleeue my Heart is thine, at least. Th? take my Heart, which thus on thee is whorl'd And loue it; so, my Heart is worth a World. To my much honored and intirely beloued Sir William Alexander Knight. Epi. 378. Thy Pen, which from some Angel is acquir'd, With heauenly Grace to shew thy Wit &amp; skil, So farre out-shines my poore Rookes ruder Quil, That, in it's beames mine seemes a Cole vnfir'd; But, let them lie till they become intir'd, Then, thine shall mine with equall glory fill; Yet so as, knowne, t'was so by thine attir'd, That all the Glory thine may merit still: Yet, here my lauish Pen runs o're so much With blurring inck, be blotting blacker Crimes, That (loosly) it, the Times too neere doth touch; That is; too broadly blots these looser Times: But, sooth to say; my Muse became thus loose Through vice; at which she hisseth like a goose. To my venerable friend Master Doctor Goade. Epi. 379. Thou art not like, but eu'n a reall Goad, Sharpe at one End (thy Head) to driue men on (That are opprest with sad sinnes heauie Load) Where they may rest from being we-be-gon: Then, he that will not goe, when thou dost prick, Is dull, in sense; or else, an Halter-sick. To my worthy, and beloued friend Doctor Pierce; Parson of Saint Christophers, London. Epigram. 380. In this but Froth of Wit to sowse your name Is but to soile it; so, incurre your blame. These Purgings of my Braine become not you In any sort to See; much lesse alowe. You needs must say, my Leisure I abuse To make these Iests the Stasions of my Muse. What will you more (deere Doctor) I confesse I am all yours, but not my Foolishnesse. Yet, Garce, Art, Wit, and Worth (and all diuine) May make you (bright Sun) on this Dunghill shine Without defiling of your spotlesse Raies: Then, scowre my guilt with Birch; but, gilde my Baies. To my best beloued friend, and aliz-man, Master Iohn Sanford. Epi. 381. Iohn, thou art like a Hand that changeth not His Name, or Nature; clouched, or dilated: So, thou art One, what euer be thy Lot: And still, by Fortune, rather chekt, than Mated: But, if she had but Eyes to see thy Worth, The North should grace thee, as thou dost the North With radiant Beames, On Learnings Streames. In Fortunes Spheare long be his Grace &amp; place, That, like the Sunne, exhald thy streames to grace. To the all witty, Sir Io: Har Sir, you and I (but Oh I doe you wrong, To rank with you, for friends, means, wit, or art) Are like (they say) in setting of a Song, Tho you sing more in tune, in euery Part. But, as I can, by Nature, I doe hit Those Notes you strike, vpon a iarring string: And it is true. we haue one fashion'd Wit, Which may (alike) to vs displeasure bringe. But shall wee cease to sing for this? Oh no, We can no more doe that, than cease to say God sane the Kinge: and they that would not so, Would some straite lines had trust out of the way. But on our gamesome Numbers who doth force, Their Sence, not Ours, to vexe vs; ill they wot What powre are in (our Pates) the wodden Horse, To doe their Names away with Wits hot-shot. But wee will Libell none; for tis vnfit, The world's not worth a Libell of rich Wit. To my ingenious deere friend and Country-man Mr. Iohn Hoskins, Councellor at Law. One County first susteind our weight; yet wee Doe liue no burthen to the place, so prest; But Luster: else some flatter thee and mee, Yet, say they what they will, our soules know best: And for my part, I hope that Thou, and I, Ere wee'le disgrace it, wee with Grace will dye. To my worthy, ingennus, and ingenius Pupill Mr. Thomas Bond. Vnder my hand I had you once; and now Y'are fallen vnder but my Pen, my Plow; Wherewith your Name I culture thus; you bee A Bond that binds, because you are so Free. To my witty and worthy friend, Inigo Iohnes Esquier, surueigher of his Maiestie workes. VVits mirrour, Inigo, wherein Men see Their Figure; which thou dost to them reflect By forming, or, to them, conforming thee: For which thou win'st both riches and respect: Fortune and Fauour with great Art conspir'd, To make thee Modell out each Edifice Ere it be squar'd for Court; which thee hath Squird; And may doe, SIR, for many a rare Deuice! Thy Place I wish not; but thy wakefull Wits, To make my Place fit mee, as thine thee fits: Then, lend me, while thou sleepst, thy pure acumen To Knight me (old Boy) after many New-men. To my learnedly witty friend, Mr. Beniamin Iohnson. Thy sconse (that guards thy wits as it they guard) Is sound, &amp; large, yet no whit can be spard For thy Wits throng: that Plenty makes thee scarce, Which makes thee slow, as sure in Prose or Uerse, As say thy worst detractors; then, if thou For all eternity, writ'st Sure and Slowe, Thy Wits, as they come thronging out of Dore, Do sticke a while, to spread their praise the more. To my darling-friend Mr. Richard Dorington. Dicke, I am thine: then (thou hast to the end, A sore disease, that Physicke will not mend: Yet, tis no Falling-sicknes, for Ile stand As fast to thee, as is thy Heart and Hand: And I haue reason for it; for thou art As deere to mee as is my Hand or Heart. Then, if I doe disease thee, it shall bee, As Physicke doth, of good, to better thee, Sith thou aforehand giu'st mee Fee on Fee. To my beloued, and most praise worthy friend, Mr. Lyte of Lytes-cary. Sith Art and Nature did agree, To make thee Lyte of Lyte; Thou art a Type of Christ, sith hee Is very Light of Light: Thou light'st (like him) with Wit and grace, Whose Fame (like his) fils Time and Place. To my beloued, Mr. Robert Branthwaite. I loue thee Robin; If I should not, I Should giue my heart the stab, my tongue the lie: The Sword of sorrow still should pierce my heart, If it should not affect thy deere desert: In few, I know no man more worthy loue For all that may Affection Stay, or Moue. To my worthy approued deere friend Mr. Iackson, Manciple of All Soules Colledge in Oxford. If wee must speake as we haue found; why then, Th' hast beene to me and mine, the best of Men: For, of all those that euer yet I prou'd, Thou best deseru'st of mee to be belou'd. Thine Out-sides plaine, but yet within thy Brest, A Heart (I finde) as braue and free doth rest As that great Cæsars, who would euer moane The passed day, wherein he pleasur'd none. Thou art a Townseman, yet the Countrey mend'st, &amp; glad'st it with what there thou get'st &amp; spend'st For, two Months, in a time of pestilence, There, freely cheer'd, I saw thy great expence. While thou in Oxford (plagu'd) wast then expos'd To death: thy family and mine dispos'd In safety there, where wee, besides, were fed; While thou for vs did'st liue among the dead. Iackson's thy name; then thou art mine (alacke Th' art haplesse so) for some doe ca'l me Iacke. But, like a Father, thou to Iacke hast bin; That is, in kindnesse, farre beyond his Kin. Then, Iack's thy sonne, to loue and honour thee; And so, for fostring both, must Iack's Siluanus Sonne bee. Thus, though Iacke can not giue thee reason for't, Hee'le giue thee Rime, Renowne &amp; good report. And if that be too thyn for thy desert. Wer't thou not all heart, thou shouldst haue his Heart, Yet, for thine may be sicke, when his is sound, He giues it thee, sith so to thee it's bound. To my worthy approued friend Mistris Sisley Tyse. Thy Vertues do intice me, Tyse, to set Thy name (for Loue and Fames sake) in my Rimes Least Time should either Them or Thee forgett, Whose Wisdome, Woman-hood, &amp; parts (like crimes) Do staine most Wiues, as Phœbus doth the Fire; Then, liue thou in my Rime, till Time expire. Of my Selfe, and my Booke. I must confesse my Muse is in the wrong, Though rightly she doth securge what is amisse: But being pregnant, Shee to lash doth longe, Though her complexion quite be mar'd by this: For most will say, Shee like a Diuell lookes: Yet, let none iudge, but such as can write Bookes. Against Yellow, starcht bands. For a Farewell. These Ruffes, sick of the Ianndize (black, or Yellow) Do shew their Wearers are or Deep or Shallow In Pouerty, or Wit: Then, would they were Al black with Cuffes that Yellow Ruffes do weare: And he whose Wife doth weare them, I suppose With Cause still feares he weares the Yellow-hose. To my deare Mother; the Citty of Hereford. Thou gau'st me breath; and I wil giue thee fame By writing, in a double Kind: thy Name I Borrow'd once to adde to mine: and yet I hold it to it still; for which the debt Is clearest fame Ile pay thee, at long running; Else shall my hand and head forget their cunning.

I lou'd Faire-writing; and, could Write as faire As any that for That had got that Aire. I taught it others; but my greatest Fee Was fairest-fame the fowler shame for mee In Mens accompt; who hold all Gettings vaine That tend to Grace and Glory more than Gaine. My Heart was Manly, in a double-sence, Kind to my Friends and apt to giue offence To my Offenders: so, Heart, Hand, and Head Had precious Guifts, that did me little stead. I found the World as Abel found it; sith It harm'd me most that medl'd least therewith. I found my Flesh my Houshold Foe; while I The Diuell found my forraigne enemy: So, Inwardly and Outwardly I found My life still Millitant; till in this Ground I lay intrench'd: where safe I lie from fight, Equall to Cæsar in our present plight: If oddes there be; herein it now doth rest, I, being a Christian-man, must needs be best: My soule is in his hand, that made me so; His Glories Subiect still, in Weale, or Woe.

An excuse for Faults escapt in Printing by reason my Occasions would not permit me to looke to the Presse. When Printing first was borne (it seems) it had This curse with it; That it should beare no Book But it, with Falts, should make the Father sad, Then Reader to the Faults vouchsafe to looke: And mend, or make them worse; all's one to me, They be not mine; but theirs that, now, o're see.
