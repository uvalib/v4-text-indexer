      <field name="fulltext">SONGS IN THE TWILIGHT. LIFE'S CONTRASTS. He wooed her in the sweet spring days, When flowers were scenting all the air, And soft winds whispered in the leaves, And skies were blue, and life was fair. He won her on a summer eve, Beneath a stretch of purple sky, And through the fields they walked that night, Pledged to each other till they die. Upon them fell the sweet moonshine: Was it a dream? or was it true? The world at once had grown so bright That sooth to say they hardly knew. He wedded her in the long, long days; The bells rang out; he bore her home; And time flew by on rapid wing— Across two lives new light had come. Dear household ways, and household truth, And homely peace, and gentle cheer; And days and nights of full content, In which each grew to each more dear. Then came a boy to crown their love, With rose-bud lips for mother's kiss, To give the earth a richer joy, To lend each day a fresher bliss. Ah! why should summers ever wane, Or tempest sweep across the sky; Or change pass o'er a happy dream— Love grow to pain;—and pleasures die? Why should the face be wan with grief, Or heart, o'ercharged with weight of care, Sicken beneath a hope deferred, And nurse a keen and dark despair? Why not all life be as that night, 'Mid breath of flowers—'neath shining skies, When the fair girl was wooed as wife, With whispered words and sweet replies? The din of war shook all the land, And harshly grated on the ear, And loving homes sent forth their best, And loving hearts forced back the tear. The cause of freedom, truth, and right, Summoned the noble and the brave; And he must march down to the West, And fill, if need, a soldier's grave. “He dared not shrink from such a call,” So spoke he to the trembling wife; Where others went he too must go, Honour was dearer far than life! She listened weeping to his words, Close held him to her breaking heart, And all the world grew dark and cold; 'Twas death in life from him to part. “Dora, my wife, my life, my love, The great God lives in yonder sky; Trust Him;—I leave but for a time: Is He not, darling, always nigh? “Sweet heart, lift up thy drooping head; Look with brave eyes straight into mine; When far away on tented field, Their light will often on me shine. “I would be strong, not weak, true wife— Help me to say the last ‘good-bye;’ For here, or there, where'er I be, Am I not thine until I die? “Yea, after death: if I should fall 'Mid battle's storm upon the plain, Thou and our boy will join me soon; And life is little: death is gain.” Then, after many a clinging kiss, He gently tore himself away; And she, with sorrow in her heart, Was left alone to wait and pray. She sought for patience, and was calm— She stilled the sorrow at her heart; She went about her household ways— The child to soothe her did his part. So went the days, a weary round, Telling each other as they passed, All bearing this one weight of care— And still the saddest was the last. Then flashed a message 'neath the sea, Which smote upon the startled ear, And emptied Christmas homes of joy, Filling a nation's heart with fear. A battle had been fought and won, The balls of death left many slain, Hundreds died fighting in the breach, Hundreds lay wounded on the plain. A whole brigade was under fire, Each shot a gallant soldier's knell; Hardly a man escaped with life, So murd'rous was the fatal shell— Friends came to break the fatal news, But faltered, and their voices shook; She raised her eyes in sudden fear, And searched each face with eager look— And when she heard that he had died Amongst the foremost in the fight, The hand of death was at her heart, And on her fell a cloud like night. They strove to speak some healing words, To take from sorrow's edge the pain— Poor breaking heart! What comfort now?— With love both life and hope were slain. Then with a brain all sick and blind, And with a sharp, unconscious cry, Stricken, she shrank upon the ground: Ah, well indeed if she could die! But not for her such sweet release; She woke to life, not love again; And crept about as one whose heart Is daily hurt by some great pain. She bowed her head to God's decree, “Thy will,” she meekly said, “be done;” But the deep wound still bled within, And often forced from her a moan. Her child too sickened, pined, and died; And when she laid it in its shroud, She wept, but not as mothers weep, Whose grief is violent and loud. She could not sorrow for the boy, That she had given life to save, But only wished she too could die, And lie beside him in the grave.— Her face grew hollow, and a fire Like crimson burned on either cheek; Her eyes had caught the wistful look Of one who far-off worlds doth seek. They buried her in winter days, When all the land was white with snow; Thankful to God her pain had passed, And restful death had crowned her woe.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">SONNETS. PAST AND PRESENT. I Old scenes are here; here is the ivied grange, And here the lake, the valley, and the hill, The wood, the stream that turns the busy mill— The same as when by them I used to range. Though years have fled, yet nothing looketh strange, And as I gaze the Past seems with me still; The Past! the thought of which has power to thrill— The same, yet not the same. There is a change, And all around a different aspect wears. What is it? Friends, the good and true, are gone, And with them gone the charm of happy years, And much that hope had fondly built upon; So from my heart well up unbidden tears, For dear ones who have left me one by one. II Ah me! I sicken for the dear old days, When friends and youth and joy enriched the time, And all came well: summer, or winter's rime, December's cold, or sweet and blooming Mays, The stretch of wold, or shady forest-ways, Scent of bright gorse, or wafts of fragrant thyme, Silence of noon, or birds' song in the Lime; And yet I feel the old charm as I gaze— 'Tis gone! departed with the friends, who lie Nearer than all to hearts that yearn in vain, To keep them still,—not keeping them to die:— 'Twas they who made the light of days gone by. Our crown of sorrow this,—its keenest pain,— Loved ones must go, and only things remain. III Yet be it so. Glide on, thou rushing stream; Raise still your tops to heaven, ye sunlit hills; Flash down the mountain's side, ye foaming rills; And wear, ye valleys, still your radiant gleam, The tender beauty of the Painter's dream. If friends must go, they only seem to die; Lost for a time to touch and ear and eye; And passed a moment from our loving sight, But yet to be restored to our embrace. For if like them we seek the true and right, Clad in the strength of love's transcendent grace, And climb the upward path from height to height, We too shall stand where God's uplifted face Fills all high heaven's sphere with holy light. LIFE. O Life, Life, Life! O full and bounteous Life! Bright with thy glowing suns and mellow moons, And homes with smiles and happy faces rife; Fair morns, and tender eves, and amber noons,— I love thee and this upper world, the flowers, The woods, the dells, the streams, and grassy glade, The quiet forest-paths where leafy bowers By interlacing boughs are greenly made. Well love I too the joyous birds' sweet song, That fills the copses in the budding spring; Yet for a higher life than this I long, Which will with it a true completeness bring; And did the Dove's swift power to me belong, I'd prune for upward flight my rapid wing. DEATH. O Death, Death, Death! unlovely, cruel Death! Grim King of Terrors, with thy barbèd dart! Why should I fear thee, dreadful though thou art, Or speak thy name with low and bated breath, And eyes that fill with swelling tears beneath Their quivering lids, as throbs my timid heart? Why should I shrink at thought of thee, or start? What though thy curse still sadly lingereth? Nought art thou but the travail pangs before The birth which ushers in a higher life; The surge which bears the vessel to that shore Where storms shall rage no more, and joys are rife; A Port of quiet rest for evermore, Beyond the reach of sorrow, sin, and strife.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">[SACRED LYRICS] HOW SHOULD I LIKE TO DIE? How should I like to die? you ask; and where? Well, I will try to give an answer true; I have not made these questions much my care— They have not troubled me; Friend, have they you? How would I die? Not in a far-off land, 'Mid faces strange, and voices all unknown; No, let me feel the touch of friendly hand; I fain would fall asleep anear mine own. For it were sweet to die 'mongst those loved best, The true, the tender, and the near and dear; To lay my dying head upon their breast, And have their kindly voices in my ear. Pleasant to see, down-bending from above, Affection's yearning gaze, and on it dwell; To pass away 'mid looks and tones of love; To catch the words of low and fond farewell. Where would I die? I would the call might come 'Mid old familiar scenes and cherished ties; In some dear chamber of the hallowed home, There would I close on earth my dying eyes. When earthly lights are burning dim and low, And earthly faces fade from out my sight, And earthly voices faintly come and go, And round me gather shadows of the night— I then would rest my last and parting gaze On things and persons known to me of yore, Who made the sweetness of the happy days When all the hours some pleasure to me bore. So would I calmly pass from earth away, When life is wearing to the welcome ev'n, Falling asleep, to wake when dawns the day, And find myself with Christ in home and heav'n. KING DAVID. Up and down his lonely chamber Paced the King with breaking heart, Struggling with a hopeless sorrow,— Like a stricken deer, apart; Wan his face, and very haggard— Furrowed all his brow with care; Great drops stood upon his forehead; From his eyes stared grim despair. Wrung he sore his hands in anguish, Whilst the tears fell thick and fast, And his manly frame was shaken Like a reed before the blast. Oft in faltering broken accents, Which betrayed a soul undone, Raising weeping eyes to heaven, Wailed he out, “My son! my son!” “Absalom, my own, my dear one, Dearer than all sons to me; Absalom, my loved and lost one, Would that I had died for thee!” Thus he sobbed forth his deep sorrow, Moaning ever, moaning low; All the spirit torn and tortured With the greatness of his woe. Where were now the fascination, Glories of the hair and face, All the grace and all the glamour, Pride of honour, pomp of place? Dimmed the splendour and the beauty, Sullied, faded, soiled, brought low; On his lips the seal of silence, Death's cold hand upon his brow. In that grief so wild and piteous, Did the King recall his shame? Did no thought of foul transgression Scorch and scathe his soul like flame? Passed before his mind the murder, Dead Uriah's bloody grave; How, by craft and cruel counsel, He was slain the true and brave? Thought he how his guilty passion Struck at honour, name, and fame; Wrought the husband's dark undoing, And Bath-Shua's utter shame? Through his weeping and his mourning Thrilled no voice upon his ear, Like the trump of judgment sounding, Shaking all his soul with fear? Ah, what mem'ries wrung his spirit, Desolate, bereft, undone, Forced that cry of desolation— “Absalom, my son! my son!” For again the Prophet's judgment, Terrible, intrepid, calm, Smote with fear the quailing monarch, Robber of the poor man's lamb. Now he sees the flashing aspect, Hears once more the damning ban, As the Seer brands the sinner, “Thou, O David, art the man!” But the climax of his anguish, Torture added to his pain, Was the deed of dark rebellion In which Absalom was slain. Absalom, the loved and cherished, Nearest, dearest to his heart, Traitor to his crown and kingdom! —This it was that barbed the dart. Was there hope for one so guilty, Cut off reckless in his sin? Would for him God's heaven open? Could such sinner enter in? This the crown of all his sorrow; Ah, this left him woe-begone, Wrung that cry of sore bereavement, “Absalom, my son! my son!” In this world where woe and sadness Are but as a common thing, Grief for life gone out in darkness, Has than all a fiercer sting. Ah, no pang is half so poignant, Sorrow greater there is none, Than beside a hopeless death-bed, To wail out, “My son! my son!” Then the racked and tortured spirit, Musing on the dark to be, Sobs aloud in piteous angish, “Would God I had died for thee!” COMPLETED JOY. Of all the words that fill the ear with gladness, And like rich treasure in the heart we hide, Of all the promises that banish sadness, What passes this, “I shall be satisfied”? What satisfied? The soul's immortal longing; The thirsting for the good, the true, the right; The vast desires that come upon us thronging; The hungering for knowledge and for light? Shall there no wish be ever on us growing, That ours were service pure as saints' above? No wish: since we are filled to overflowing With all the fulness of the Godhead's love. O blessed hope; hope that no more for ever Desires unsatisfied shall vex the soul; That yearnings unfulfilled shall trouble never The peace of those that reach the heavenly goal. I cannot tell the glories of that heaven Where God in Christ, and Christ in God, is all; Where burn the lamps, the mystic wondrous Seven, And saints in lowly adoration fall. Enough for hearts weary of sin and sorrow, And still athirst when earthly streams are tried, Enough that soon shall dawn that glorious morrow When we, awaking, shall be satisfied. No longer then bewildered by false seemings, The substance shall be ours, the shadow gone; Beguiled no longer by unstable dreamings, We from the dark shall pass into the sun. Here, then, I rest at peace, all doubtings over; “Here,” can I say, “I will with joy abide;” No bliss beyond this wish I to discover; Enough for me, “I shall be satisfied.” THE SORROWFUL SEA. There is a sorrow on the sounding sea, A trouble ever heaving in its breast, A wail as from a soul in agony, An undertone of wild and sad unrest. The waves break mournfully upon the shore, Or surge in fitful fury 'gainst the rock; Anon retreat with melancholy roar, Tortured and torn, and writhing from the shock. What hear we in that sorrowful sea-moan? A dirge-like voice, a sound of hoarse farewells, Despair that lurks in ev'ry hollow tone, Sadder than requiem rung from funeral bells. I catch the cry of storm-tossed men from far, A shriek of wrecked ones thrilling 'cross the deep Rising to God upward from star to star, As cruel waters o'er the drowning sweep. Courage and youth no pity have from thee, Nor hope a spell to tame thy heartless might; Prayer cannot charm thee, oh thou cruel sea! Nor love o'ercome thee in the dreadful fight. When will thy waves in tranquil stillness lie? The sorrow in thy heart for ever cease? And the loud clash of tempests pass and die Into the harmony of endless peace? The earth lies quiet like a child asleep: The deep heart of the heaven is calm and still, Must thou alone a restless vigil keep, And with thy sobbing all the silence fill? The wail of sorrow rising from thy breast Tells of a hidden and a nameless pain; Will nothing soothe that anguish into rest, So that it never, never wake again? O God, bring Thou the promised happy time Which is to bless the ages yet to be; Ring in with bells of heav'n's own sweetest chime The golden year when “shall be no more sea.” THE CHALLENGE TO THE SWORD. “O thou sword of the Lord, how long will it be ere thou be quiet? Put up thyself into thy scabbard; rest, and be still.” —Jer. xlvii. 6. O sword of the Lord, wilt thou never be still? How long wilt thou flash to destroy and to kill? Return to the scabbard: rest, rest in the sheath! Wilt thou never have done with the dark work of death? O sword of the Lord, must the shriek rend the air, The cry of the widow and child in despair? Must the vineyard be wasted, the field trampled down, And the festering dead choke the streets of the town? Wilt thou never be sated with blood of the slain, The moans of their anguish, their wounds, and their pain? Are the harvests this green earth is ever to yield Red harvests reaped down in the fierce battlefield? Sick at heart with thy triumphs, we ask thee how long Wilt thou mow down the young, and the brave, and the strong? Are War's carnage and carnival never to cease? Shall the world never bask in the sunshine of peace? O sword of the Lord, sharp, furbished, and keen, Thou art drunk with the blood of the slaughtered, I ween; End, end, and for ever, the strife and the pain, And the battle that hurtles aloud on the plain. Rest, rest in thy scabbard; rust, rust in thy sheath; Cease at last to lay low the thick swathes of death; Sleep, if but for a season; be quiet, be still; Of anguish and blood thou hast more than thy fill. Let it break, the glad day by prophets foretold, When earth shall rejoice in the bright age of gold; When the din of the conflict for ever is o'er, And nation shall rise against nation no more! Then the sword to a share shall be beaten and turned, The spear to a pruning-hook, the battle-axe burned; Then the use of the drum and the trumpet shall cease, Or sound but to herald the long reign of peace. THE CHALLENGE ANSWERED. “How can it be quiet, seeing the Lord hath given it a charge against Ashkelon, and against the sea-shore? there hath He appointed it.” —Jer. xlvii. 7. How can it be quiet,” this sword of the Lord? God has spoken in judgment and given the word; 'Tis He who unsheathes it, 'tis He sends it forth, Grim and ghastly, to deal with the nations of earth. “How can it be quiet?” The charge has been given To take its keen blade and “bathe it in heaven;” For the crimes that are daily relentlessly done, Call it forth from the scabbard to flash in the sun. God has sent it in doom 'gainst the sea-shore of pride, 'Gainst Ashkelon's sins in their full-breasted tide; So it holds ever on in its terrible path, Bearing with it the sign of the Holy One's wrath. “Quiet!” What, when the wailings of grief and despair, The sighings of sorrow are filling the air; When such wrongs and such horrors through Christendom sweep, As cause devils to laugh, and good angels to weep! “Quiet!” What, when dark hotbeds of vice curse each town, When the rich men are boasting, the poor trodden down, When sedition and murder are stalking abroad, And men are blaspheming the name of their God! “Quiet!” What, when the cries of disease and of pain, Rise from hearts that are breaking, again and again, When folly and passion, ambition and strife, Are killing all hope in full many a life! The stern sword of the Lord on its mission must go, And the record of earth be one burden of woe, War's tocsin must sound, ay, and thousands be slain, And crimsoned with blood be the fair harvest plain. It will not be quiet, nor rest evermore, Till the Light shall arise and the darkness be o'er; Till tyranny ceases, cruel bigotry, lust, And God's enemies lie at His feet in the dust. When the sword has fulfilled the stern charge of the Lord, And accomplished the righteous behests of His word, When have passed from the world the dark shadows of ill, 'Twill return to the scabbard, 'twill rest and be still. Patience yet for a while, and then all will be well, Sin and death shall be bound in their own native hell; The Saviour shall claim the whole world for His own, And on earth shall establish His kingdom and throne. EVER WITH GOD. “When I awake, I am still with Thee.” —Psalm cxxxix. 18. When sinks the sun far in the glimmering west, And shadows lengthen over field and fell, I lay me down in peace and take my rest, For Thou in safety, Lord, dost make me dwell. Thou drawest round the curtains of the night, And sendest sleep to close my heavy eyes, Keeping true watch, until the morning light Reddens the east and steals along the skies. Meanwhile, within the Everlasting Arms, Which underneath me lovingly are spread, I rest secure with Thee from all that harms; Thy breast a pillow for my weary head. Sweet is the sleep o'ershadowed by Thy love, Sweeter the dreams all brightened by Thy grace; All heaven appears descending from above, When I in visions see Thy glorious face. And when the dayspring ripples o'er the lawn, When pipes the early bird in bush and tree, And dewdrops turn to diamonds in the dawn, When I awake, Lord, I am still with Thee. “With Thee!” this is my first and earliest thought; “With Thee!” this in my heart finds latest place; “With Thee!” the consciousness with joy is fraught; I sleep to wake within Thy sweet embrace. So shall it be in that, the last long sleep, When I am laid within my narrow bed, Thou wilt a tender watch upon me keep, For precious in Thy sight are all Thy dead. And when the Easter morning breaks the gloom, And death and darkness shall for ever flee, Triumphant rising from the yawning tomb I shall awake, to know “I'm still with Thee.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">MISCELLANEOUS. THE CONVENT GRATE. What, will he never, never come? I sent to him an hour ago. I cannot bear the madd'ning strain, The fires within me that consume, The torture, agony, and pain, The horror of the coming tomb. These old men are so slow—so slow! The day is wearing on to eve, The last that I shall ever see— He would not mock me or deceive. If I could break these prison bars, Through which I hardly see the stars, To him all quickly would I flee, And pour into his awe-struck ear My tale of sin, to lay all bare My heart, my soul, its shame and fear; These, these before my conscience glare, And drive and goad me to despair. I long denied and cloaked it all, My heart was hard as this cold stone 'Gainst which I press my aching breast To still its throbbings into rest. I did not even make a moan, Nor sob, nor utter any cry, Not when I found myself alone; No, not a tear was in my eye, Although I saw her bleeding fall, And felt and knew that she would die. But now I am no longer brave; My heart is filled with bitter dread; I know they've dug for me a grave— I long my soul to purge and save; To-morrow sees me with the dead. But hark! Ah, surely this is he Who comes to shrive my guilty soul. I hear the key turn in the door; How shall I tell my bitter dole, Lay bare my crime, reveal my woe? Yet all shall be confessed by me. I hear his step upon the floor— Father! father! thou art come! I will no more, no more be dumb, Thou shalt know all, all, all. Yes; I am guilty! do not shrink, Oh! do not turn away thy face; Have mercy, father; show some grace— I stand upon the icy brink Of death; I know my fate, my doom— The rack, the torture! Save me, save! If that thou canst. I do repent. Oh! must I leave the prison's gloom To meet the headsman's cruel eye! Beneath his glittering axe to die, Then thrown into the loathsome grave! Is there no hope they will relent? Father, I turn to you with tears; I am so young—my mother dead— No one to care for me or lead; A child, a foolish child in years. Listen again. I see your eyes Are yearning towards me. Ah, you feel For me. I hear your sighs; Your heart is human—'tis not steel; It is not death I so much dread, If there were rest when I am dead. Ah, to lay down my head to sleep On earth's calm breast, no more to weep, Or waken to another morn To face man's cruel hate and scorn! Ah, this were blessed, this were sweet! But oh, to think that I must meet The Judge upon the Judgment Seat! I dread His wrath—I fear His ire— The deathless worm—the quenchless fire; Save me from these, the curse, the ban, Save me, dear Father, if you can! Yes, I will tell you all.—Bend down Your ear, and do not shrink or start; Take pity on me; do not frown, As I lay bare to thee my heart. Young Giuglio,—I remember not The time when we were not as one. Our homes were near, among the vines— To grow together was our lot. We played as children in the sun, We worked together in the shade, We sat together neath the pines, We knelt together, and we prayed; And in San Joseph's solemn aisle, Heard what the holy father said, When speaking of the joys of heaven, How men repent and are forgiven. We loved, loved truly, without guile. I hardly knew a mother's love— I was an infant when she died, And she was taken up above To rest with God in Paradise, Far from my wistful heart and eyes, And, from my weeping father's side. For me, I was left near alone, And did what pleased me,—worked or played, Wandered by valley, stream, and glade, And so grew up. Some called me fair, And praised the lustre of my hair. I cared not for their praise or blame, One only did I seek to please— Others to me were all the same; But Giuglio, oh my love, my life! My Morning-Star, my joy, my light! Sweet as the breezes of the May; He was to make me his own wife— To keep me ever in his sight, And be mine own strong staff and stay. And so for me the world grew bright, More sweet the day; more fair the night. The world was like a Paradise, From which there rose a happy hymn, And angels from the heavens looked down With kind and sympathising eyes. And I was seated on a throne, And queen-like reigned in bliss alone, Crowned with my Giuglio's happy love, A crown to me all crowns above. I must not linger on the joy, The bliss was brief. A serpent came Into my garden,—brought a curse, It wore a woman's face,—was fair, Had fatal beauty to destroy; Black browed, with eyes of subtle flame, And glorious clouds of purple hair, With meshes to ensnare the soul. She had a cold and cruel smile, False, false, and fitted to beguile. She caught my Giuglio in her snare. His love from me she slowly stole, And made him her poor foolish slave, Drawing him surely by her art. The world for me became a grave, Wherein lay buried my dead heart, And over which she lightly trod. She triumphed when she saw me sad— I was to her but as the sod On which she placed her dainty feet. Her scorn, her laughter, made me mad. The sunshine left my darkened life, 'Twas all o'ershadowed with a cloud. I withered 'neath the inward strife; I longed to wear the deathly shroud, That all the passion and the fever Might pass, for ever and for ever, And I low in the ground, at rest, The green grass waving o'er my breast. Oh, to have died there at his feet! That would have been most sweet, most sweet. But death was not so to be won— I was to live, live sadly on, When all that made life dear was gone. The days passed by, I know not how, I could not say if summer shone, Or winter came with chilling snow— My heart was dead, and still, and cold— My face grew pinched, and grey, and wan— And youth was o'er, and I was old. My life became a wintry thing— For me there was no future spring. One evening late I walked alone, My heart hard, lifeless as a stone; And through the garden passed, and by The thick-leafed vines, and through the flowers Which scented all the dusky air, I paused a moment with a sigh— All was so sweet and fragrant there. Father, I think I smell them now, Jasmine, and rose, and lily fair. Then heard I voices, saw them pace The twilight alleys, up and down. Love looked from out his up-turned face, And set upon her head a crown. He drew her dainty hand in his, She leaned against him all her weight, He stooped and gave her one long kiss— And I was forced to see their bliss. I, that stood there so desolate, I heard her laugh a silver laugh, It pierced me like a sharpened sword, It ran like fire through all my blood, It maddened me as there I stood, A devil it within me stirred— It was too sweet,—too sweet by half. I looked on—stricken, wounded, slain, With tortured heart and whirling brain. Father, would'st know what then took place? They walked together to the door, I followed through the dusky gloom, Drawn by a fatal secret force That held and pressed me more and more, And drew me onward to my doom. With heart aflame and ghastly face, I saw them part with fond embrace, And then he left her. She went in— I glided swiftly after her. She turned; she saw me where I stood; She smiled the smile of those who sin. I for a moment did not stir, And then in wild and wrathful mood I spoke; she answered, laughed; and then I felt the dagger 'neath my breast; Held it a moment tightly pressed; And as I heard the laugh again That stung me with a sudden pain, I raised my hand,—there shrilled a cry, Upon her dress I saw a stain; 'Twas blood, red blood; I knew the why— The dagger! Yes, close to my heart, Hidden beneath my dress it lay; But why I kept it closely there, I hardly know or cannot say. Perhaps that it might give me rest, And save me from my dark despair. Father, I think that I was mad— I left the house; I did not care What next befell. Why should I flee, For what was left of life to me? 'Tis all confused what happened then; A crowd of faces; startling cries; Women aghast and wondering men; My father, horror in his eyes, Their lids all red with unshed tears; And Giuglio with a face like stone, White, as the dead, with such a look Of woe, as though had passed whole years And left him old. His whole frame shook And trembled like the aspen leaf, And in his eyes, as in a book, I read my guilt. And then a swoon Brought for a season sweet relief. Oh, never to have waked again! That in death's arms I might have lain! The waking came too soon, too soon, I woke, and found me here. The rest You know. Father, I am to die— To-morrow? Is it then so near? Only a summer night between Me and the bitter doom I fear? A few more hours,—what shall have been? Can it indeed be then so soon? Shall I not see again that moon Which shineth brightly through these bars, Nor look upon those happy stars, Nor move amongst the fragrant flowers, Nor train again the trellised vine? No! I can reckon up the hours Before they take this life of mine. Well, let that go. My sin! my sin! Can I for this forgiveness win? Say, is there hope for me—and where? Tell me some refuge from despair. For oh, to die with this poor hand All red with blood! and then to go And meet with God, where she will be To charge the guilty deed on me! For then together we shall stand, And on my brow will burn the brand Of murder! Oh, the woe, the woe, The deathless worm, the quenchless flame, The horror, agony, and shame! Have pity, Father, save, oh save! Let me not fill a hopeless grave! “Mary!” the Virgin Mother mild, The gentle, good, and undefiled, What, what,—oh, tell me what of her? She is too pure, too far above A wicked, cruel thing like me; I am not worthy of her love, Or tenderness—No, let that be— For if I prayed she would not hear; No cry of mine her heart would move; She standeth on the glassy sea, And songs of angels, sweet and clear, Fill with their harmonies her ear. What knows she of the maddened mind, The tortured heart, the burning brain, The deep remorse, the gnawing pain, The fears that all my senses bind, The horror more than I can tell, The dread that scorches like a hell? Speak not of her. Tell me of one, If such there be, who will not scorn A sinner guilty, lost, undone, Outcast from all, helpless, forlorn; Who will both pity and show grace. Tell me of such, Father, I pray, Nay, look not with that hopeless face, The hours are speeding fast away; To me is left but little space Before the breaking of the day. And at the dawn—you know the rest. Ah, lives no pity in your breast? That Crucifix—you hold it there Between me and my dark despair, Truly I trusted to it once My hope lay in that carvéd bronze. But now,—nay, Father,—do not start, I need a living, loving heart; His,—His,—I need,—the Man, the Man, Who died upon the bitter cross, And mockery and anguish bare, And shame, and suffering and loss, And all, and more than nature can; Bare it for sinners on the rood— Ah, He was merciful and good! I would have nothing pass between Me and the Christ on whom I lean. Oh, it were wondrous strange and sweet To fall like her of old, love-led, Down at His own dear blessed feet, And wash them with the tears I shed, And weep, and weep, till I were dead. He would not spurn me from the place, For He was ever full of grace, And loving, pitiful, and kind. The lost He came to seek and find; The broken heart to heal and bind. Have mercy, Jesu; here I lie; Low from the dust to Thee I cry; No one so lost, undone, as I. Oh, by Thy seven bleeding wounds, And by the scars on hands and side, By shudd'ring wail, and awful sounds, That pierced the skies from Calvary, And by the flowing, crimson tide, Oh, save me, Jesu, or I die! Hark! Hark! Did'st thou not hear them toll The great and solemn funeral bell? 'Twas for the passing of my soul That loudly rang that dismal knell. Now shrive me—speak the words of peace. 'Tis well. My death is drawing near, The headsman, he will soon be here— I hear his steps. Well, let him come; I am prepared to meet my doom, Nor think, good Father, I would live; I shrink no longer from the tomb, Dark though it be, and full of gloom. But Giuglio!—pray him to forgive; And say that I still thought of him, E'en 'neath the headsman's axe so keen, And loved him. Say all this from me, And more,—I hope to meet him, where In the now near eternity There is no sin, and no despair. One moment—kneel with me in prayer— Now, Father,—let us go. WILLIAM D'ALBINEY. A BALLAD. Fair England's Knights and Barons brave Rose in one noble band, Their altars and their hearths to save From a tyrant's cruel hand. With fearless hearts resolved they stood Their freedom to obtain; Nor would they, though it cost their blood, In serfdom base remain. King John had trampled on their rights, To the winds had flung the oath, Which, on his faith, he gave his knights, Pledging his solemn troth. And so their men they summoned all To join them in the fray; Ready in such a cause to fall, Could they not win the day. Amongst them was a man of fame, A valiant knight and bold; William D'Albiney hight his name, With a heart as true as gold. They placed him foremost in command, A Captain true and tried, To lead in fight the noblest band In all the country's side. Then at their head he marchèd down, Where Thames doth broadly sweep By meadow, village, busy town, To Rochester's great keep. The Archbishop held its castle strong, A holy man and true, Who from his soul abhorred the wrong, As holy man should do. And when these trusty knights and brave Marched there in warlike state, Praying that entrance they might have, He opened wide the gate. They enter 'neath the archway's gloom, They mount the narrow stair; And now they know their cruel doom, The place is blank and bare; For here there are no sheep or beeves To smoke upon the board; No bread is here; of harvest sheaves There is no golden hoard. They stand dismayed, they stand aghast, They gaze around in fear; Has the gate been passed by them at last That they may perish here! Then murmurs rise, both loud and deep, Hoarse as the ocean's roar When waters leap with an angry sweep Upon the rock-bound shore. “Let's quit this cursed niggard place Before it be too late; Better the foeman's brand to face Than famine be our fate!” Above the din one voice was heard, It rose and stilled the cry; D'Albiney's heart with rage was stirred, A fire flashed from his eye. “What, Knights! Deserters! Can it be? Ye will not thus deny Your manhood and your chivalry! 'Twere better far to die.” Soon as his tongue had spake the words Then sharp the war cry rose; From scabbards leaped the polished swords, Ready to smite their foes. The town itself shall yield them all That they can wish or need; They will not leave the city's wall; The Burghers them shall feed. “Let but D'Albiney lead them forth,” They cry as with one breath, “To east, or west, or south, or north, They'll follow him to death.” King John when he the tidings hears, That Rochester is ta'en, Swears, by the holy Mother's tears, It shall be won again. And so he marches quickly down The city fair to save; Blockades the castle and the town, With valiant men and brave. Thick showers of stones and arrows fly, Which darken all the air, Hurled at the castle's ramparts high, And the men besiegèd there. But the gallant knights inside the gate All bear themselves right well; And if they're doomed by cruel fate, Their lives will dearly sell. 'Tis well that they are true of heart, And nerved for bloody fight; Ready with life and all to part, Rather than yield the right; For the barons who had pledged their troth To help them and their cause, Who on the Gospels swore an oath They would uphold the laws, And help D'Albiney in his strait, And lend to him their aid, Now leave him, cowards! to his fate; The cravens, sore afraid! He and his men, both one and all, Alone defy the foe; Right gallantly they keep the wall, And work the siegers woe. One day John and a peerless knight, In warlike pomp and state, With armour gleaming in the light, Rode to the castle gate. The knight he bore for noble name Savarii de Marleon; From fields of Brittany he came To fight for great King John. A man with cross-bow in his hand Stood on the castle tower; Best of D'Albiney's noble band, Of his body-guard the flower. Then up he spoke unto his lord, Then boldly out spoke he; And low and earnest was his word, But brave and fierce and free. “Is it thy will, great knight,” he said, “That I should smite the king? A word, and John is with the dead, By arrow from this string. The king he is our bitter foe, Cruel as death is he; This arrow, sire, shall lay him low, And England shall be free.” He raised the cross-bow up on high, Placed arrow on the string; Full soon the wingèd bolt shall fly, To pierce the unconscious king. But up and spoke D'Albiney now, And, oh, he spoke right loud: And dark as the thunder was his brow, Ere it bursts from the riven cloud. “No, Villain, no! what! dost not fear To lift unhallowed hand Against the Lord's anointed here, The king of all this land? “Forbear, forbear the bloody deed, And let the king pass on; Though death indeed be tyrants' meed, Harm not the royal John.” To him the Villain then did say, “This king we must not spare; If he should worst us in the fray, What deed will he not dare?” To whom the knight, with reverent head, Did thus at once reply, “God's will be done!” and then he said, “Not thus King John must die.” Like David once, when Israel's king Before him sleeping lay, D'Albiney scorned to do such thing, Or take his life away; But spared the man that was his foe, Nor harmed his sacred head, Although he might have struck the blow Had laid him with the dead. But ill King John repaid the knight For this great act of grace; With him the might was more than right, So mean his heart, and base. When famine pressed D'Albiney sore, And hunger gnawed his men, And e'en the hope itself was o'er That buoyed him up till then. He did on great St. Andrew's Day A solemn council hold, Where swarmed, like tigers held at bay, His gallant men and bold. Ready they are still to hold out, And die, if so must be; Or sally forth with cry and shout To meet the enemy. But, as their cause was hopeless all, He passed the castle gate, And marched into the royal hall Where the king did keep his state. And then, with dauntless mien and word, He looked John in the face, And at his feet threw down his sword, And asked for royal grace. But, filled with wrath and rage, the king By all the saints did say, That he and all his men should swing On gallows high that day. Then up and spake Savarii bold— Oh, but out and brave spake he— “My lord the king, I pray you hold; This must not—shall not be! “It were a base and coward thing To harm these soldiers brave; Unworthy of thee, noble king, To dig for them a grave! “Nor is the war yet over, sire, Its fortunes soon may turn; The barons, filled with righteous ire, For vengeance fierce will burn. “And if they conquer us in fight, Then they will work their will, And will not spare a knave or knight, Will hang and burn and kill. “And none will rise up in thy cause, No champion wilt thou find, If thou dost break fair honour's laws, And cast them to the wind.” King John he heard with lowering look, With fierce and gleaming eyes; Such counsel he was loth to brook, Though he felt it true and wise. And, after time of sullen gloom, The silence deep he broke, And, with a brow as dark as doom, He to Savarii spoke. D'Albiney and his men, he said, He should not hang, but spare; They to Corfe Castle should be led And kept in dungeon there. And so it was. These men so bold, Baron, and Knave, and Knight, Were in Corfe Castle placed in hold; Maugre both ruth and right. But God who watches o'er the brave, To rescue soon or late, Let not the dungeon be their grave, Averting such a fate. D'Albiney went across the main, And dwelt on foreign strand; Nor did he ever see again, His green and pleasant land. A holy Monk of St. Alban's fair His body home did bring, And laid it reverently where With hymns the cloisters ring. In Wymondham, a saintly place, And blessed by priestly rite— Wherever sound sweet songs of grace, And prayers rise day and night; They laid him with the chant and psalm, In a great and honoured tomb, Where he lies in deep, untroubled calm, Till breaks the day of doom. And to this shrine of the noble dead Full many a pilgrim stole, To hear prayers read and masses said For the good D'Albiney's soul.</field>
