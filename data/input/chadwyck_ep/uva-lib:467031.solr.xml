      <field name="fulltext">VOL. I POEMS. 1833. I write, endite, I point, I raze, I quote, I interline, I blot, correct, I note, I make, allege, I imitate, I feign. Drayton. For I, that God of Lov'is Servantes serve, Ne dare to love, for mine unlikelinesse, Prayin for spede, al should I therefore sterve, So ferre am I fro his help in darknesse; But nathelesse, if this may doe gladnesse To any lovir, and his cause aveile, Have he the thanke, and mine be the traveile. Chaucer: Troilus and Creseide. DEDICATORY SONNET, TO S. T. COLERIDGE. Father, and Bard revered! to whom I owe, Whate'er it be, my little art of numbers, Thou, in thy night-watch o'er my cradled slumbers, Alluding to the poem called “Frost at Midnight,” by S. T. Coleridge. The reference is especially to the following lines: But thou, my babe! shalt wander like a breeze, By lakes and sandy shores, beneath the crags Of ancient mountain, and beneath the clouds Which image in their bulk both lakes, and shores, And mountain crags: so shalt thou see and hear The lovely shapes and sounds intelligible Of that eternal language, which thy God Utters, who from eternity doth teach Himself in all, and all things in himself. As far as regards the habitats of my childhood, these lines, written at Nether Stowey, were almost prophetic. But poets are not prophets. Didst meditate the verse that lives to shew, (And long shall live, when we alike are low) Thy prayer how ardent, and thy hope how strong, That I should learn of Nature's self the song, The lore which none but Nature's pupils know. The prayer was heard: I “wander'd like a breeze,” By mountain brooks and solitary meres, And gather'd there the shapes and phantasies Which, mixt with passions of my sadder years, Compose this book. If good therein there be, That good, my sire, I dedicate to thee. Hartley Coleridge. SONNETS. I. TO A FRIEND. This sonnet, and the two following, my earliest attempts at that form of versification, were addressed to R. S. Jameson, Esq., on occasion of meeting him in London after a separation of some years. He was the favourite companion of my boyhood, the active friend and sincere counsellor of my youth. “Though seas between us broad ha' roll'd” since we “travell'd side by side” last, I trust the sight of this little volume will give rise to recollections that will make him ten years younger. He is now Judge Advocate at Dominica, and husband of Mrs. Jameson, authoress of the “Diary of an Ennuyée,” “Loves of the Poets,” and other agreeable productions. When we were idlers with the loitering rills, The need of human love we little noted: Our love was nature; and the peace that floated On the white mist, and dwelt upon the hills, The peace that sleeps upon the dewy hills.Wordsworth's Song at the feast of Brougham Castle. To sweet accord subdued our wayward wills: One soul was ours, one mind, one heart devoted, That, wisely doating, ask'd not why it doated, And ours the unknown joy, which knowing kills. But now I find, how dear thou wert to me; That man is more than half of nature's treasure, Of that fair Beauty which no eye can see, Of that sweet music which no ear can measure; And now the streams may sing for others' pleasure, The hills sleep on in their eternity. II. TO THE SAME. In the great city we are met again, Where many souls there are, that breathe and die, Scarce knowing more of nature's potency, Than what they learn from heat, or cold, or rain, The sad vicissitude of weary pain:— For busy man is lord of ear and eye, And what hath nature, but the vast, void sky, And the throng'd river toiling to the main? Oh! say not so, for she shall have her part In every smile, in every tear that falls, And she shall hide her in the secret heart, Where love persuades, and sterner duty calls: But worse it were than death, or sorrow's smart, To live without a friend within these walls. III. TO THE SAME. We parted on the mountains, as two streams From one clear spring pursue their several ways; And thy fleet course hath been through many a maze In foreign lands, where silvery Padus gleams To that delicious sky, whose glowing beams Brighten'd the tresses that old Poets praise; Where Petrarch's patient love, and artful lays, And Ariosto's song of many themes, Moved the soft air. But I, a lazy brook, As close pent up within my native dell, Have crept along from nook to shady nook, Where flowrets blow, and whispering Naiads dwell. Yet now we meet, that parted were so wide, O'er rough and smooth to travel side by side. IV. The Man, whose lady-love is virgin Truth, Must woo a lady that is hard to win: She smiles not on the wild and wordy din Of all-confiding, all-protesting Youth; The Sceptic's apathy; the garb uncouth, And Cynic sneer of o'er-experienced Sin, The Serpent, writhing in its worn-out skin, Craving again to flesh its sated tooth, She quite abhors. She is not fond, nor coy— Self-seeking love, and self-appraising scorn, She knows not. She hath utterly forsworn, Her worldly dower of wealth, and pride, and joy— Her very beauty none but they discover, Who for herself, not for her beauty, love her. V. What was't awaken'd first the untried ear Of that sole man who was all human kind? Was it the gladsome welcome of the wind, Stirring the leaves that never yet were sere? The four mellifluous streams which flow'd so near, Their lulling murmurs all in one combined? The note of bird unnamed? The startled hind Bursting the brake—in wonder, not in fear, Of her new lord? Or did the holy ground Send forth mysterious melody to greet The gracious pressure of immaculate feet? Did viewless seraphs rustle all around, Making sweet music out of air as sweet? Or his own voice awake him with its sound? VI. I Loved thee once, when every thought of mine Was hope and joy,—and now I love thee still, In sorrow and despair:—a hopeless will From its lone purpose never can decline. I did not choose thee for my Valentine By the blind omen of a merry season,— 'Twas not thy smile that brib'd my partial reason, Tho' never maiden's smile was good as thine:— Nor did I to thy goodness wed my heart, Dreaming of soft delights and honied kisses, Although thou wert complete in every part, A stainless paradise of holy blisses: I lov'd thee for the lovely soul thou art,— Thou canst not change so true a love as this is. VII. Is love a fancy, or a feeling? No, It is immortal as immaculate Truth. 'Tis not a blossom, shed as soon as youth Drops from the stem of life—for it will grow In barren regions, where no waters flow, Nor ray of promise cheats the pensive gloom. A darkling fire, faint hovering o'er a tomb, That but itself and darkness nought doth shew, Is my love's being,—yet it cannot die, Nor will it change, though all be chang'd beside; Tho' fairest beauty be no longer fair, Tho' vows be false, and faith itself deny, Tho' sharp enjoyment be a suicide, And hope a spectre in a ruin bare. VIII. Whither is gone the wisdom and the power That ancient sages scatter'd with the notes Of thought-suggesting lyres? The music floats In the void air; e'en at this breathing hour, In every cell and every blooming bower The sweetness of old lays is hovering still: But the strong soul, the self-constraining will, The rugged root that bare the winsome flower Is weak and wither'd. Were we like the Fays That sweetly nestle in the fox-glove bells, Popular fancy has generally conceived a connection between the Fox-glove and the good people. In Ireland, where it is called Lusmore (the great herb) and also Fairy-cap, the bending of its tall stalks is believed to denote the unseen presence of supernatural beings. The Shefro, or gregarious Fairy, is represented as wearing the corolla of the Fox-glove on his head, and no unbecoming headdress either. See Crofton Croker's “Fairy Legends of the South of Ireland,” a book to the author of which, unknown as he is to me, I gladly seize this opportunity of returning thanks for huge delight and considerable accession of fairy lore. Crofton Croker is evidently a man of genius and poetical feeling. Is it not to be wished that he had given more free way to the poetry of his nature? He seems almost afraid lest some one should suspect him of fearing and believing in the good people himself, and consequently tells his stories as if he did not believe them, which makes them appear more like great big Irish lies than the genuine educts of superstition. Now this may be proper enough in such tales as Daniel O'Rourke's Voyage to the Moon, Ned Sheehy's Excuse, and some others; but still superstition is one thing, and lying another, and though the superstitious are often mendacious, or rather destitute of any standard of truth within their minds, and when hard pushed will consciously and conscientiously forge to keep up the credit of their creed, (countless are the falsehoods that have been told as well as believed, for conscience sake,) yet really superstitious persons do not, Falstaff-like, set about of malice prepense to raise a laugh by the enormity of their inventions. Many thanks to Crofton for his three delectable little volumes; but I do suspect, that from injudicious emulation of Tam-o-Shanter, he sometimes “mars a curious tale in telling it.” It is his manifest endeavour to be as Irish as possible, but are his Irishmen always genuine Milesians? Are they not too much like the Kilmallocks, and Mactwolters, and Brulgrudderies? all excellent fellows in their way, but not fit company for Fairies. A certain dash of the ludicrous is not amiss in a terrible story, because fear is a ridiculous passion, whether its object be man or goblin; but it should be naïveté, or unconscious humour, not irony or sarcasm, far less the slang knowingness of a heaxer. Of all the imaginations of Erin, the Banshce is the most affecting, and the best authenticated. There are some narratives of this apparition attested by startling evidence. But perhaps the most beautiful fancy is the Thierna-na-Oge, or land of youth, a region of perpetual spring beneath the waters, where there is no decay, no change, no time, but all remains as at the moment of submersion. To this Moore alludes in those lines:— On Lough Neagh's bank, as the fisherman strays, When the clear, cold eve's declining, He sees the round towers of other days, In the wave beneath him shining. To return to the Fox-glove. Query. Is not the proper etymology Folk's, i.e. Fairie's glove? Surely Renard does not wear gloves in popular tradition. Or lurk and murmur in the rose-lipp'd shells Which Neptune to the earth for quit-rent pays, Then might our pretty modern Philomels Sustain our spirits with their roundelays. IX Long time a child, and still a child, when years Had painted manhood on my cheek, was I; For yet I lived like one not born to die; A thriftless prodigal of smiles and tears, No hope I needed, and I knew no fears. But sleep, though sweet, is only sleep, and waking, I waked to sleep no more, at once o'ertaking The vanguard of my age, with all arrears Of duty on my back. Nor child, nor man, Nor youth, nor sage, I find my head is grey, For I have lost the race I never ran: A rathe December blights my lagging May; And still I am a child, tho' I be old, Time is my debtor for my years untold. X. Youth, love, and mirth, what are they—but the portion, Wherewith the Prodigal left his Father's home, Through foreign lands in search of bliss to roam, And find each seeming joy a mere abortion, And every smile, an agonised distortion Of pale Repentance' face, and barren womb? Youth, love, and mirth! too quickly they consume Their passive substance, and their small proportion Of fleeting life, in memory's backward view, Still dwindles to a point, a twinkling star, Long gleaming o'er the onward course of Being; That tells us whence we came, and where we are, And tells us too, how swiftly we are fleeing From all we were and loved, when life was new. XI. How long I sail'd, and never took a thought To what port I was bound! Secure as sleep, I dwelt upon the bosom of the deep And perilous sea. And though my ship was fraught With rare and precious fancies, jewels brought From fairy-land, no course I cared to keep, Nor changeful wind nor tide I heeded ought, But joy'd to feel the merry billows leap, And watch the sun-beams dallying with the waves; Or haply dream what realms beneath may lie Where the clear ocean is an emerald sky, And mermaids warble in their coral caves, Yet vainly woo me to their secret home; And sweet it were for ever so to roam. XII. Once I was young, and fancy was my all, My love, my joy, my grief, my hope, my fear, And ever ready as an infant's tear, Whate'er in Fancy's kingdom might befal, Some quaint device had Fancy still at call, With seemly verse to greet the coming cheer; Such grief to soothe, such airy hope to rear, To sing the birth-song, or the funeral, Of such light love, it was a pleasant task; But ill accord the quirks of wayward glee, That wears affliction for a wanton mask, With woes that bear not Fancy's livery; With Hope that scorns of Fate its fate to ask, But is itself its own sure destiny. XIII. Too true it is, my time of power was spent In idly watering weeds of casual growth,— That wasted energy to desperate sloth Declined, and fond self-seeking discontent,— That the huge debt for all that nature lent I sought to cancel,—and was nothing loth To deem myself an outlaw, sever'd both From duty and from hope,—yea, blindly sent Without an errand, where I would to stray:— Too true it is, that, knowing now my state, I weakly mourn the sin I ought to hate, Nor love the law I yet would fain obey: But true it is, above all law and fate Is Faith, abiding the appointed day. XIV. On a Picture of the Corpse of Napoleon lying in State. Lo! there he lies. Is Death no more than this? Is this the worst that mighty mortal can Inflict upon his fellow? Could the man— The strongest arm of angry Nemesis,— The rod that routed hosts were fain to kiss, Whom failing Faith afar with terror eyed, And Atheism madly deified— Could he with all his wars and policies Effect but this? To antedate a year That cold unfeeling calm, that even now Blanks the dark meaning of that deep-lined brow, And from the loose lip half uncurls the sneer? If such be Death, O man, then what art thou, That for the fear of Death would'st live in fear? XV. TO WORDSWORTH. There have been poets that in verse display The elemental forms of human passions: Poets have been, to whom the fickle fashions And all the wilful humours of the day Have furnish'd matter for a polish'd lay: And many are the smooth elaborate tribe Who, emulous of thee, the shape describe, And fain would every shifting hue pourtray Of restless Nature. But, thou mighty Seer! 'Tis thine to celebrate the thoughts that make The life of souls, the truths for whose sweet sake We to ourselves and to our God are dear. Of Nature's inner shrine thou art the priest, Where most she works when we perceive her least. Thou worshippest at the Temple's inner shrine, God being with thee, when we know it not. Wordsworths' sonnets. XVI. NOVEMBER. The mellow year is hasting to its close; The little birds have almost sung their last, Their small notes twitter in the dreary blast— That shrill-piped harbinger of early snows; The patient beauty of the scentless rose, The Chinese, or monthly rose, so frequently seen clustering round the cottage-porch, both in the remotest vales and in the immediate outskirts of busy, smoky towns, is almost destitute of scent. The manner in which this cheerful foreigner persevers in the habits of a warmer climate, through all vicissitudes of ours, is a remarkable instance of vegetable nationality. Oft with the Morn's hoar crystal quaintly glass'd, Hangs, a pale mourner for the summer past, And makes a little summer where it grows: In the chill sunbeam of the faint brief day The dusky waters shudder as they shine, The russet leaves obstruct the straggling way Of oozy brooks, which no deep banks define, And the gaunt woods, in ragged, scant array, Wrap their old limbs with sombre ivy twine. XVII On parting with a very pretty, but very little Lady. 'Tis ever thus. We only meet on earth That we may know how sad it is to part: And sad indeed it were, if, in the heart, There were no store reserved against a dearth, No calm Elysium for departed Mirth, Haunted by gentle shadows of past Pleasure; Where the sweet folly, the light-footed measure, And graver trifles of the shining hearth Live in their own dear image. Lady fair, Thy presence in our little vale has been A visitation of the Fairy Queen, Who for brief space reveals her beauty rare, And shews her tricksy feats to mortal eyes, Then fades into her viewless Paradise. XVIII. NIGHT. The crackling embers on the hearth are dead; The indoor note of industry is still; The latch is fast; upon the window sill The small birds wait not for their daily bread; The voiceless flowers In the “Bride's Tragedy,” by Thomas Beddoes, of Pembroke College, Oxon, occurs a hypothetical simile which some prosewitted dunce of a reviewer thought proper to assail with great animosity. Something, I forget what, is Like flower's voice—if they could but speak. Whoever feels the beauty of that line, has a soul for poetry.—how quietly they shed Their nightly odours;—and the household rill Murmurs continuous dulcet sounds that fill The vacant expectation, and the dread Of listening night. And haply now she sleeps; For all the garrulous noises of the air Are hush'd in peace; the soft dew silent weeps, Like hopeless lovers for a maid so fair— Oh! that I were the happy dream that creeps To her soft heart, to find my image there. XIX. THE FIRST BIRTH DAY. The Sun, sweet girl, hath run his year-long race Through the vast nothing of the eternal sky— Since the glad hearing of the first faint cry Announc'd a stranger from the unknown place Of unborn souls. How blank was then the face, How uninform'd the weak light-shunning eye, That wept and saw not. Poor mortality Begins to mourn before it knows its case, Prophetic in its ignorance. Thou know'st, the first time that we smell the air We waule and cry. When we are born, we cry that we are come To this great stage of fools. Shakspeare: King Lear, Act 4. The thought, which is obvious enough indeed, occurs in an older writer than Shakspeare, and might probably be traced to some of the fathers, or to Seneca. Robert Greene reproaches Shakspeare with reading Seneca done into English. But soon The hospitalities of earth Earth fills her lap with pleasures of her own. Yearnings she hath in her own natural kind, And even with something of a mother's mind, And no unworthy aim, The homely nurse doth all she can To make her foster-child, her inmate man, Forget the glories he hath known, And that imperial palace whence he came. —Wordsworth. engage The banish'd spirit in its new exile— Pass some few changes of the fickle Moon, The merry babe has learn'd its Mother's smile, Its Father's frown, its Nurse's mimic rage. XX. Whither—Oh—whither, in the wandering air, Fly the sweet notes that 'twixt the soul and sense Make blest communion? When and where commence The self-unfolding sounds, that every where Expand through silence? seems that never were A point and instant of that sound's beginning, A time when it was not as sweet and winning, As now it melts amid the soft and rare, And love-sick ether? Purple the sails, and so perfumed, that The winds were love-sick with them. Shakspeare: Antony and Cleopatra, Act. 2. Imitators and alterers do not often improve upon Shakspeare, but when they do, it is but fair to give them credit for it. Dryden, in his “All for Love,” has omitted all the philosophy, and two thirds of the poetry of Shakspeare's play, but he has certainly made a much more compact and consecutive drama; and by putting the description of Cleopatra's “grand aquatic procession” into the mouth of Antony himself, has made it a natural and dramatic portion of the play; whereas, in Shakspeare, it has too much the air of a quotation from an epic or descriptive poem. Neither Shakspeare nor Dryden have done much more than versify Plutarch's, or rather Dr. Philemon Holland's prose, and they were wise in not hunting after useless originality: but Shakespeare has added some exquisitely poetical touches. At the helm A seeming mermaid steers; the silken tackles Swell with the touches of those flower soft hands, That yarely frame their office. From the barge A strange invisible perfume hits the sense Of the adjacent wharfs. The city cast Her people out upon her; and Antony, Enthroned i' the market-place, did sit alone, Whistling to the air; which, but for vacancy, Had gone to gaze on Cleopatra too, And left a gap in nature. If Antony owed to the Egyptian Queen the loss of his empire and life, he is indebted to her for a less hateful renown than would have clung to his name had she never “pursed up his heart on the river of Cydnus.” The murderer of Cicero is merged in the lover of Cleopatra. Gone it is—that tone Hath pass'd for ever from the middle earth, The phrase occurs in a hymmn of the Saxon poet Cædmon, and seems to imply, not the supposed centrality of the earth in the firmament, but the intermediate condition between the poles of good and evil. I have here adapted it to signify, that on earth we only contemplate objects in transitu, being unable to trace any process to its origin or its termination. Yet not to perish is the music flown— Ah no—it hastens to a better birth— Then joy be with it—wheresoe'er it be, To us it leaves a pleasant memory. XXI. Love is but folly,—since the wisest love, Itself disclaiming, would invent a use For its free motion.—Penitents recluse, That scarce allow the natural heart to move, With amorous ditties woo the mystic dove, Or fondly bid their heavenly Spouse unloose Their sacred zones.—The politic excuse Of worldlings would to worldly endso improve The gentle madness.—Courtiers glibly preach How Love and Woman best rehearse the play That statesmen act.—The grave fine-spoken leech Counts how the beatings of the pulse betray The sweet disease.—And all the poets teach That love alone can build the lofty lay. XXII. Youth, thou art fled,—but where are all the charms Which, tho' with thee they came, and pass'd with thee, Should leave a perfume and sweet memory Of what they have been?—All thy boons and harms Have perish'd quite.—Thy oft renew'd alarms Forsake the fluttering echo.—Smiles and tears Die on my cheek, or, petrified with years, Shew the dull woe which no compassion warms, The mirth none shares. Yet could a wish, a thought, Unravel all the complex web of age,— Could all the characters that Time hath wrought Be clean effaced from my memorial page By one short word, the word I would not say, I thank my God, because my hairs are grey. XXIII. I thank my God because my hairs are grey! But have grey hairs brought wisdom? Doth the flight Of summer birds, departed while the light Of life is lingering on the middle way, Predict the harvest nearer by a day? Will the rank weeds of hopeless appetite Droop at the glance and venom of the blight That made the vermeil bloom, the flush so gay, Dim and unlovely as a dead worm's shroud? Or is my heart, that, wanting hope, has lost The strength and rudder of resolve, at peace? Is it no longer wrathful, vain, and proud? Is it a Sabbath, or untimely frost, That makes the labour of the soul to cease? XXIV. It must be so,—my infant love must find In my own breast a cradle and a grave; Like a rich jewel hid beneath the wave, Or rebel spirit bound within the rind Of some old wreathed oak, or fast enshrin'd In the cold durance of an echoing cave:— Yea, better thus than cold disdain to brave:— Or worse,—to taint the quiet of that mind, That decks its temple with unearthly grace. Together must we dwell, my dream and I,— Unknown must live, and unlamented die, Rather than soil the lustre of that face, Or drive that laughing dimple from its place, Or heave that white breast with a painful sigh. XXV. FROM COUNTRY TO TOWN. Written in Leeds, July, 1832. I left the land where men with Nature dwelling, Know not how much they love her lovely forms— Nor heed the history of forgotten storms, On the blank folds inscribed of drear Helvellyn; I sought the town, where toiling, buying, selling— Getting and spending, poising hope and fear, Make but one season of the live-long year— Now for the brook from moss-girt fountain welling, I see the foul stream hot with sleepless trade; For the slow creeping vapours of the morn, Black hurrying smoke, in opake mass up-borne, O'er dinning engines hangs, a stifling shade— Yet Nature lives e'en here, and will not part From her best home, the lowly-loving heart. XXVI. CONTINUED. 'Tis strange to me, who long have seen no face, That was not like a book, whose every page I knew by heart, a kindly common-place— And faithful record of progressive age— To wander forth, and view an unknown race; Of all that I have been, to find no trace, No footstep of my by-gone pilgrimage. Thousands I pass, and no one stays his pace To tell me that the day is fair, or rainy— Each one his object seeks with anxious chase, And I have not a common hope with any— Thus like one drop of oil upon a flood, In uncommunicating solitude— Single am I amid the countless many. XXVII. If I have sinn'd in act, I may repent; If I have err'd in thought, I may disclaim My silent error, and yet feel no shame— But if my soul, big with an ill intent, Guilty in will, by fate be innocent, Or being bad, yet murmurs at the curse And incapacity of being worse That makes my hungry passion still keep Lent In keen expectance of a Carnival; Where, in all worlds, that round the sun revolve And shed their influence on this passive ball, Abides a power that can my soul absolve? Could any sin survive, and be forgiven— One sinful wish would make a hell of heaven. XXVIII. TO SHAKSPEARE. The soul of man is larger than the sky, Deeper than ocean—or the abysmal dark Of the unfathom'd centre. Like that Ark, Which in its sacred hold uplifted high, O'er the drown'd hills, the human family, And stock reserved of every living kind, So, in the compass of the single mind, The seeds and pregnant forms in essence lie, That make all worlds. Great Poet, 'twas thy art To know thyself, and in thyself to be Whate'er love, hate, ambition, destiny, Or the firm, fatal purpose of the heart, Can make of Man. Yet thou wert still the same, Serene of thought, unhurt by thy own flame. XXIX. Why should I murmur at my lot forlorn? The self-same Fate that doom'd me to be poor Endues me with a spirit to endure All, and much more, than is or has been borne By better men, of want, or worldly scorn. My soul has faith, my body has the nerve To brave the penance that my sins deserve. And yet my helpless state I deeply mourn: Well could I bear to be deserted quite,— Less should I blame my fortune were it worse,— But taking all, it yet hath left me friends, For whom I needs must mourn the wayward spite That hides my purpose in an empty purse, Since what I grateful wish, in wishing ends. XXX. What can a poor man do but love and pray? But if his love be selfish, then his prayer, Like noisome vapour, melts in vacant air. I am a debtor, and I cannot pay. The alms which drop upon the public way,— The casual tribute of the good and fair, With the keen, thriftless avarice of despair I seize, and live thereon from day to day, Ingrate and purposeless.—And yet not so: The mere mendicity of self-contempt Has not so far debased me, but I know The faith, the hope, the piety, exempt From worldly doubt, to which my all I owe. Since I have nothing, yet I bless the thought,— Best are they paid whose earthly wage is nought. XXXI. What is young Passion but a gusty breeze Ruffling the surface of a shallow flood? A vernal motion of the vital blood, That sweetly gushes from a heart at ease, As sugar'd sap in spicy-budding trees? And tho' a wish be born with every morrow, And fondest dreams full oft are types of sorrow, Eyes that can smile may weep just when they please. But adult Passion, centred far within, Hid from the moment's venom and its balm, Works with the fell inherency of sin, This ineradicable taint of sin. Childe Harold: Canto IV., 126. Nor feels the joy of morn, nor evening calm: For morn nor eve can change that fiery gloom That glares within the spirit's living tomb. XXXII. FROM PETRARCA. “Solo e pensoso i piu deserti campi.” In this and other translations from the Italian, I have not succeeded in preserving the simple purity of the original diction so completely as I could have wished. Italian words are so beautiful, that they are when “unadorned, adorned the most.” English, with all its excellencies, is so deficient in euphony, and so large a part of its vocabulary is debased by association, that it always requires strong or deep pathos, beautiful images, profound thought, rapid and striking interest, or much artifice in composition; something, in short, to withdraw the attention from the coarseness of the vehicle. We cannot emulate the simplicity of the Greeks or the Italians. The poet, indeed, who can and dare, may be austere; but austerity and simplicity are different things. Simplicity is never, austerity is always, conscious of itself. The Sunday habit of a modest country girl is simple—the regulation dress of a nunnery is meant to be austere. Simplicity does not seek what it feels no need of—Austerity rejects what it judges unfit. But neither simplicity nor austerity are necessarily poetical. The simple must be beautiful, the austere must be great, or they have no place in genuine poetry. A daisy is simple, a turnip still simpler, yet the former belongs to the poetry of Nature, the latter to her most utilitarian prose. Lonely and pensive o'er the lonely strand, “With wandering steps and slow,” I loiter on, My eyes at watch, to warn me to be gone If mark of human foot impress the sand; Else would my piteous plight be rudely scann'd, And curious folk would stare to see the wan And deathlike images of joy foregone, And how I inly waste like smouldering brand. Or I would fain believe the tangled wood Which girds the small field on the mountain side The one sole witness to my crazy mood; But ah! what sandy waste, or forest dim, My haunt obscure from Love can ever hide? Where'er I think, I converse hold with him. XXXIII. The vale of Tempe had in vain been fair, Green Ida never deem'd the nurse of Jove; Each fabled stream, beneath its covert grove, Had idly murmur'd to the idle air; The shaggy wolf had kept his horrid lair In Delphi's cell, and old Trophonius' cave, And the wild wailing of the Ionian wave Had never blended with the sweet despair Of Sappho's death-song: if the sight inspired Saw only what the visual organs shew, If heaven-born phantasy no more required, Than what within the sphere of sense may grow; The beauty to perceive of earthly things, The mounting soul must heavenward prune her wings. XXXIV. TO A LOFTY BEAUTY, FROM HER POOR KINSMAN. Fair maid, had I not heard thy baby cries, Nor seen thy girlish, sweet vicissitude, Thy mazy motions, striving to elude, Yet wooing still a parent's watchful eyes, Thy humours, many as the opal's dies, And lovely all;—methinks thy scornful mood, And bearing high of stately womanhood,— Thy brow, where Beauty sits to tyrannize O'er humble love, had made me sadly fear thee; For never sure was seen a royal bride, Whose gentleness gave grace to so much pride— My very thoughts would tremble to be near thee; But when I see thee at thy father's side, Old times unqueen thee, and old loves endear thee. THOUGHTS AND FANCIES. A TASK AD LIBITUM. TO A LADY. You bid me write, and yet propose no theme. Must I then shoot my shafts of poesy At the vast, void, invulnerable air? Or lead my Pegasus a steeple-hunting? Or issue forth with chiming hue and cry, With trampling feet of thorough-paced blank verse And winding horn of long-drawn melody In chase of butterflies? Or shall I rather, In gentler figure, make believe to hang My careless harp upon a willow tree, That every gale may prattle with its strings? 'Tis strange that any bard should lack a theme In such a world of wonders. Look abroad, Around you, and above you, and within you: The stars of heaven (as elder sages told) Roll on from age to age their lonely way To their own music. So the humbler spirit Hears in the daily round of household things A low sweet melody, inaudible To the gross sense of worldlings. The still, and music of humanity. Wordsworth's Tintern Abbey.—Aye, I grant That earth and sky are cunning instruments; But who may rouse their sleeping harmony, And not torment the strings to grinding discord, Or vex the hearers with the weary drone Of half-forgotten lays, like buzzing night-flies, Thwarting the drowsiness themselves produce? All, all is stale: the busy ways of men, The gorgeous terrors of the steel-clad warrior, The lover's sighs, the fair one's cruelty, Or that worst state, when love, a rayless fire, Is sever'd quite from hope and tenderness, Or dogg'd by base suspicion, hurries onward, Scared by its own black shadow.—These are themes Unmeet for thee, or old, or harsh and strange. The gentler joys, the calm sequester'd hours Of wedded life: the babble sweet of babes, That unknown tongue, which mothers best expound, Which works such witchery on a parent's heart, Turning grave manhood into childishness, Till stoic eyes with foolish rheum o'erflow, And fluent statesmen lisp again,—for love Will catch the likeness of the thing beloved,— These have been sung a thousand times before; And should I sing of thee and thy soft brilliance, Thy tender thoughts, in reckless laughter melting, Thy beautiful soul, that shapes thine outward form To its own image,—thy essential goodness, Not thine, but thee,—thy very being's being, Thy liquid movements, measured by the notes Of thy sweet spirit's music,—the unearthly sound Of that beloved voice, less heard than felt, That wins the wayward heart to peace, and lulls The inmost nature to that blissful sleep Which is awake to heaven, and brings no dream, But foretaste of the best reality: Then must I modulate empyreal ether To strains more sweet than mortal sense could bear. SONG. The earliest wish I ever knew Was woman's kind regard to win; I felt it long ere passion grew, Ere such a wish could be a sin. And still it lasts;—the yearning ache No cure has found, no comfort known: If she did love, 'twas for my sake, She could not love me for her own. STANZAS. She was a queen of noble Nature's crowning, A smile of her's was like an act of grace; She had no winsome looks, no pretty frowning, Like daily beauties of the vulgar race: But if she smiled, a light was on her face, A clear, cool kindliness, a lunar beam Of peaceful radiance, silvering o'er the stream Of human thought with unabiding glory; Not quite a waking truth, not quite a dream, A visitation, bright and transitory. But she is changed,—hath felt the touch of sorrow, No love hath she, no understanding friend; Oh grief! when heaven is forced of earth to borrow What the poor niggard earth has not to lend; But when the stalk is snapt, the rose must bend. The tallest flower that skyward rears its head, Grows from the common ground, and there must shed Its delicate petals. Cruel fate, too surely, That they should find so base a bridal bed, Who lived in virgin pride, so sweet and purely. She had a brother, and a tender father, And she was lov'd, but not as others are From whom we ask return of love,—but rather As one might love a dream; a phantom-fair Of something exquisitely strange and rare, Which all were glad to look on, men and maids, Yet no one claim'd—as oft, in dewy glades The peering primrose, like a sudden gladness, Gleams on the soul—yet unregarded fades— “And the rathe primrose that forsaken dies.”—Lycidas. The joy is ours, but all its own the sadness. 'Tis vain to say—her worst of grief is only The common lot, which all the world have known; To her 'tis more, because her heart is lonely, And yet she hath no strength to stand alone,— Once she had playmates, fancies of her own, And she did love them. They are past away As Fairies vanish at the break of day— And like a spectre of an age departed, Or unsphered Angel woefully astray— She glides along—the solitary hearted. A BROTHER'S LOVE TO HIS SISTER. Full ill, I ween, can measured speech reveal, Or thought embody, what true bosoms feel, For hollow falsehood long has set her sign On each soft phrase that speaks a love like mine: The choicest terms are now enfeoff'd to folly, Enfeoff'd himself to popularity. Shakspeare: Henry IV., Part 1st. To vain delight, or wilful melancholy. Oh! for a virgin speech, a strain untainted By worldly use, with holy meaning sainted, Thoughts to conceive, and words devote to tell The strength divine of love, its secret spell, Of brother's love, that is within the heart A spiritual essence, and exists apart From passion, vain opinion, hopes and fears, And every pregnant cause of smiles and tears. A life that owes no fealty to the will, Nor takes infection of connatural ill— That feels no hunger and admits no doubt, Nor asks for succour of the world without, But is, itself, its own perfected end, The one sole point to which its workings tend. A love like this so pure of earthly leaven, That hath no likeness in the earth or heaven, No correspondent in the world of sight, No symbol in the total Infinite, Was ne'er engendered in the soul or eye From aught conceived of form or quality, He loves not right that asks, or answers why; It is not born of weakness, common needs, Or gainful traffic in convenient deeds: The joy, the good, that name and being owe To sin and pain, it can and will forego; For moral good is but the thrall of time, That marks the bourne of virtue, and of crime. A joy it hath that, underived of pain, Its proper nature shall for aye retain: A good it is that cannot cease or change With man's desire, or wild opinion's range: A law it is, above all human state, A perfect freedom, and an absolute fate. “OF SUCH IS THE KINGDOM OF GOD.” In stature perfect, and with every gift Which God would on his favourite work bestow, Did our great Parent his pure form uplift, And sprang from earth, the Lord of all below. But Adam fell before a child was born, And want and weakness with his fall began; So his first offspring was a thing forlorn, In human shape, without the strength of man: So, Heaven has doom'd that all of Adam's race, Naked and helpless, shall their course begin,— E'en at their birth confess their need of grace— And weeping, wail the penalty of sin. Yet sure the babe is in the cradle blest, Since God himself a baby deign'd to be— And slept upon a mortal mother's breast, And steep'd in baby tears—his Deity. O sleep, sweet infant, for we all must sleep— And wake like babes, that we may wake with Him, Who watches still his own from harm to keep, And o'er them spreads the wings of cherubim. WRITTEN ON THE FIRST OF NOVEMBER, 1820. Hail, dark November! spurious progeny Of Phœbus and old Night,—thou sable mourner, That lead'st the funeral pageant of the year,— Thou Winter's herald, sent before thy lord To bid the earth prepare for his dread presence,— I gladly wish thee welcome, for thou wear'st No flaunting smile to mock pale Melancholy, Which ever loves its likeness, and derives From most discomfort, truest consolation. The world is heartsick, and o'erwearied Nature Bears, in her lost abandonment, the mark Of ills expected, and of pleasures past, And, like a late-repenting prodigal, Deals out with thrift enforc'd the scant remains Of lavish'd wealth, sighing to think upon The riotous days, that left no joy unrifled, No store reserv'd, to comfort poor old age: The tip-toe levity of spring, flower-deck'd, And Summer's pride, and Autumn's hospitality Have eat up all. And now her festal robes Are worn to rags,—poor rents of tatter'd state, Telling a tale of mad, luxurious waste, Yet not enough to cover nakedness,— A garb of many hues, and wretched all. There is a desperate patience in her look, And straggling smiles, or rather ghosts of smiles, Display the sadness of her wrinkled visage. Anon, with gusty rage, she casts away Her motley weeds, and tears her thin grey locks, And treads her squalid splendour in the mire; Then weeps amain to think what she has done, Doom'd to cold penance in a sheet of snow. EPIGRAM. They say Despair has power to kill With her bleak frown; but I say No: If life did hang upon her will, Then Hope had perish'd long ago: Yet still the twain keep up their “barful strife,” For Hope Love's leman is, Despair his wife. IN THE MANNER OF A CHILD OF SEVEN YEARS OLD. 'Tis silly, sooth, And dallies with the innocence of love Like the old age.— Ah! woe betide my bonny bride, For war is in the land, And far and wide the foemen ride With ruthless bloody brand. Still as a dream the purple beam Of eve is on the river, But ghastly bright, at the dead of night, A blood-red flame will quiver. Fair in the skies the sun will rise, As ever sun was seen, But never again our window pane Shall back reflect his sheen: For the warrior stern our cot will burn, And trample on the bower; It grew for years of smiles and tears, 'Twill perish in an hour. Those firs were old, our grandsires told, In their good fathers' days; And my soul it grieves that their needle leaves Must crackle in the blaze. Beneath their shade how oft we played! There was our place of wooing:— But now we're wed, and peace is fled, And we shall see their ruin. In battle plain shall I be slain, And never would I shrink, Oh! were that all, what may befall To thee, I dare not think. And our sweet boy, our baby joy, He'll for his mother cry, Till the hot smoke, his voice shall choke, And then my bird will die. Green are the graves, and thick as waves, Within our holy ground— And here, and there, an hillock fair, An infant's grave is found. Our fathers died, their whole fireside Is laid in peace together, But vile as stones, our bleaching bones Must brave the wind and weather. Nay, love, let's fly, to the hill so high, Where eagles build their nest; Among the heather we'll couch together, As blithely as the best. We'll leave the bower and tender flower That we have nursed with care; But the wild blue bell shall bloom as well Beside our craggy lair. We shall not die, for all birds that fly Shall thither bring us food, And come the worst, we'll be help'd the first, Before the eagle's brood. The mist beneath, that curls its wreath Around the hill-top hoar, There will we hide, my bonny bride, And ne'er be heard of more. SENSE, IF YOU CAN FIND IT. Like one pale, flitting, lonely gleam Of sunshine on a winter's day, There came a thought upon my dream, I know not whence, but fondly deem It came from far away. Those sweet, sweet snatches of delight That visit our bedarken'd clay, Like passage birds, with hasty flight, It cannot be they perish quite, Although they pass away. They come and go, and come again; They're ours, whatever time they stay: Think not, my heart, they come in vain, If one brief while they soothe thy pain Before they pass away. But whither go they? No one knows Their home,—but yet they seem to say, That far beyond this gulf of woes, There is a region of repose For them that pass away. TO SOMEBODY. And the imperial votaress passed on In maiden meditation fancy free. —Shakspeare. I blame not her, because my soul Is not like her's,—a treasure Of self-sufficing good,—a whole Complete in every measure. I charge her not with cruel pride, With self-admired disdain; Too happy she, or to deride, Or to perceive my pain. I blame her not—she cannot know What she did never prove: Her streams of sweetness purely flow Unblended yet with love. No fault hath she, that I desire What she cannot conceive; For she is made of bliss entire, And I was born to grieve. And though she hath a thousand wiles, And, in a moment's space, As fast as light, a thousand smiles Come showering from her face,— Those winsome smiles, those sunny looks, Her heart securely deems, Cold as the flashing of the brooks In the cold moonlight beams. Her sweet affections, free as wind, Nor fear, nor craving feel; No secret hollow hath her mind For passion to reveal. Her being's law is gentle bliss, Her purpose, and her duty; And quiet joy her loveliness, And gay delight her beauty. Then let her walk in mirthful pride, Dispensing joy and sadness, By her light spirit fortified In panoply of gladness. The joy she gives shall still be her's, The sorrow shall be mine; Such debt the earthly heart incurs That pants for the divine. But better 'tis to love, I ween, And die of slow despair, Than die, and never to have seen A maid so lovely fair. SONG. Among the controversies of the day, not the least important is that respecting the song of the Nightingale. It is debated whether the notes of this bird are of a joyous or a melancholy expression. He who has spoken so decisively of “the merry Nightingale,” must forgive my somewhat unfilial inclination toward the elder and more common opinion. No doubt the sensations of the bird while singing are pleasurable, but the question is, What is the feeling which its song, considered as a succession of sounds produced by an instrument, is calculated to carry to a human listener. When we speak of a pathetic strain of music, we do not mean that either the fiddler or his fiddle are unhappy, but that the tones or intervals of the air are such as the mind associates with tearful sympathies. At the same time, I utterly deny that the voice of philomel expresses present pain. I could never have imagined that the pretty creature “sets her breast against a thorn;” and could not have perpetrated the diabolical story of Tereus. In fact, nature is very little obliged to the heathen mythology. The constant anthropomorphism of the Greek religion sorely perplexed the ancient conceptions of natural beauty. A river is turned into a god, who is still too much of a river to be quite a god. It is a statue of ice in a continual state of liquefaction. 'Tis sweet to hear the merry lark, That bids a blithe good-morrow; But sweeter to hark in the twinkling dark, To the soothing song of sorrow. Oh nightingale! What doth she ail? And is she sad or jolly? For ne'er on earth, was sound of mirth So like to melancholy. The merry lark, he soars on high, No worldly thought o'ertakes him; He sings aloud to the clear blue sky, And the daylight that awakes him. As sweet a lay, as loud, as gay, The nightingale is trilling; With feeling bliss, no less than his, Her little heart is thrilling. Yet ever and anon, a sigh, Peers through her lavish mirth; For the lark's bold song is of the sky, And her's is of the earth. By night and day, she tunes her lay, To drive away all sorrow; For bliss, alas! to night must pass, And woe may come to-morrow. NEW-YEAR'S DAY. While the bald trees stretch forth their long, lank arms, And starving birds peck nigh the reeky farms: While houseless cattle paw the yellow field, Or coughing shiver in the pervious bield, And nought more gladsome in the hedge is seen, Than the dark holly's grimly glistening green— At such a time, the ancient year goes by To join its parents in eternity— At such a time the merry year is born, Like the bright berry from the naked thorn. The bells ring out; the hoary steeple rocks— Hark! the long story of a score of clocks; For, once a year, the village clocks agree, E'en clocks unite to sound the hour of glee— And every cottage has a light awake: Unusual stars long flicker o'er the lake; The moon on high, if any moon be there, May peep, or wink—no mortal now will care— For 'tis the season, when the nights are long; There's time, e'er morn, for each to sing his song. The year departs, a blessing on its head, We mourn not for it, for it is not dead: Dead? What is that? A word to joy unknown, Which love abhors, and faith will never own. A word, whose meaning sense could never find, That has no truth in matter, nor in mind. The passing breezes gone as soon as felt, The flakes of snow that in the soft air melt, The wave that whitening curls its frothy crest, And falls to sleep upon its mother's breast. The smile that sinks into a maiden's eye, They come, they go, they change, they do not die. So the Old Year—that fond and formal name, Is with us yet, another and the same. And are the thoughts, that ever more are fleeing, The moments that make up our being's being, The silent workings of unconscious love, Or the dull hate which clings and will not move, In the dark caverns of the gloomy heart, The fancies wild and horrible, which start Like loathsome reptiles from their crankling holes, From foul, neglected corners of our souls, Are these less vital than the wave or wind, Or snow that melts and leaves no trace behind? Oh! let them perish all, or pass away, And let our spirits feel a New-Year's day. A New-Year's day—'tis but a term of art, An arbitrary line upon the chart Of Time's unbounded sea—fond fancy's creature, To reason alien, and unknown to nature. Nay—'tis a joyful day, a day of hope! Bound, merry dancer, like an Antelope; And as that lovely creature, far from man, Gleams through the spicy groves of Hindostan, Flash through the labyrinth of the mazy dance, With foot as nimble, and as keen a glance. And we, whom many New-Year's days have told The sober truth, that we are growing old— For this one night—aye—and for many more, Will be as jocund as we were of yore, Kind hearts can make December blithe as May, And in each morrow find a New-Year's day. ON A YOUNG MAN DYING ON THE EVE OF MARRIAGE. With contrite tears, and agony of Prayer, I know not who first used this expression, nor at what time it entered into my mind. It occurs where one should hardly expect to find it—in Darwin's Botanic Garden; but I had never read the “Botanic Garden” at the time that I wrote this epitaph. Doubtless I have read the phrase elsewhere. It could not be of Darwin's invention. God we besought, thy virtuous youth to spare, And thought, Oh! be the human thought forgiven, Thou wert too good to die, too young for heaven— Yet sure the prayers of love had not been vain, If death to thee were not exceeding gain. Tho' for ourselves, and not for thee we mourn, The weakness of our hearts thou wilt not scorn; And if thy Saviour's, and thy Father's will, Such angel love permit, wilt love us still, For Death, which every tie of earth unbinds, Can ne'er dissolve the “marriage of pure minds.” Let me not to the marriage of pure minds Admit impediments. Shakspeare's Sonnets. TO THE NAUTILUS. The skilful observations of a lady, Madame Power, have lately made known to us several particulars of the nature and habits of the Argonauta or Paper Nautilus, and have confirmed much of what was related by Aristotle and Pliny, which modern naturalists had doubted. It now appears certain that the fish (a species of the sepia or cuttle fish) is the natural occupant, and not, like the parasite crabs, the usurper of the shell which it inhabits. It is furnished with eight arms, between one pair of which there is a thin membrane that is generally stretched over the shell and nearly envelopes it. But in fine still weather, when the animal rises to the surface of the water, and is not conscious of being observed, it erects the two arms with the membrane which then takes the place of a sail, and appears of a silvery hue, with dark spots. The six other arms are at the same time turned down over the edge of the shell, and used as three pairs of oars to steer and balance the creature. If it catches sight of an intrusive observer, the Argonauta turns its sail over the shell, folds in its oar arms, and sinks to the bottom. If pursued, it emits ink, like the other sepias, and thus escapes from its enemy in a cloud of darkness. I recollect to have seen, in manuscript, a most beautiful copy of verses, founded on this habit of the Nautilus. Had they been in print, mine should never have appeared. The same may be said of the lines “to certain gold fishes.” A real poet, among many strains of “higher mood,” of which he deems the world unworthy, has an exquisite little piece on those beautiful creatures, in which he has exhibited a more than pictorial power of language. It is saying far too little to say, that he makes you see the gold fish—that they flash, in all their effulgence of hue, and complicity of motion, “on that inward eye which is the bliss of solitude”— he makes you feel as if you were a gold fish yourself. It is said, that the gold fish (Cyprinus Auratus of Linnæus) was originally confined to a little lake of China. Where Ausonian summers glowing, Warm the deep to life and joyance, And gentle zephyrs, nimbly blowing, Wanton with the waves that flowing By many a land of ancient glory, And many an isle renown'd in story, Leap along with gladsome buoyance, There Marinere, Do'st thou appear, In faery pinnace gailey flashing, Through the white foam proudly dashing, The joyous play-mate of the buxom breeze, The fearless fondling of the mighty seas. Thou the light sail boldly spreadest, O'er the furrow'd waters gliding, Thou nor wreck, nor foeman dreadest, Thou nor helm nor compass needest, While the sun is bright above thee, While the bounding surges love thee, In their deepening bosoms hiding, Thou canst not fear, Small Marinere, For though the tides with restless motion, Bear thee to the desert ocean, Far as the ocean stretches to the sky, 'Tis all thine own, 'tis all thy empery. Lame is art, and her endeavour Follows nature's course but slowly, Guessing, toiling, seeking ever, Still improving, perfect never; Little Nautilus, thou shewest Deeper wisdom than thou knowest, Lore, which man should study lowly: Bold faith and cheer, Small Marinere, Are thine within thy pearly dwelling,— Thine, a law of life compelling, Obedience, perfect, simple, glad and free, To the great will that animates the sea. [Sweet Love, the shadow of thy parting wings] Sweet Love, the shadow of thy parting wings Hangs on my soul, like the soft shade of even, Farewell to thee, for thou art going to Heaven, And I must stay behind, with all the things Which thou, and thy benign administerings Once made most sweet, of sweetness now bereaven; Whose memory, as a sour fermenting leaven, Perverts all nature with an ill that springs From good corrupted. Oh! for mercy—Love, Stay with me yet, altho' thy comrade fair, The smiler Hope, be gone to realms above, Stay with thy youngest sister, meek Despair— For meek she is in truth, as brooding dove, If thou with her the lowly bosom share. SONG. Say—what is worse than blank despair, 'Tis that sick hope too weak for flying, That plays at fast and loose with care, And wastes a weary life in dying. Though promise be a welcome guest, Yet may it be too late a comer, 'Tis but a cuckoo voice at best, The joy of spring, scarce heard in summer. Then now consent, this very hour, Let the kind word of peace be spoken; Like dew upon a withered flower, Is comfort to the heart that's broken. The heart, whose will is from above, Shall yet its mortal taint discover, For Time, that cannot alter love, Has power to slay the wretched lover. SONG. She is not fair to outward view As many maidens be, Her loveliness I never knew Until she smil'd on me; Oh! then I saw her eye was bright, A well of love, a spring of light. But now her looks are coy and cold, To mine they ne'er reply, And yet I cease not to behold, The love-light in her eye: Her very frowns are fairer far, Than smiles of other maidens are. EPITAPH. ON A MOTHER AND THREE INFANTS. From God they came, to God they went again; No sin they knew, and knew but little pain: And here they lie, by their fond mother's side, Who lived to love and lose them, then she died. LEONARD AND SUSAN. This tale, which was first published in Blackwood's Magazine, was intended to form part of a series of narrative and reflective pieces, which should have been intitled “Lucubrations of an Old Bachelor.” Leonard was to have been an old man in my, i.e. the Old Bachelor's childhood. This, of course, throws the supposed date of the incidents at least a century back, and may obviate the charge of exaggeration which has been alleged against my description of prison sufferings. A debtor's gaol, however, is still, I suspect, pretty much what it always has been—a place of low dissipation or unprincipled luxury for the dishonest; of ruin, and misery, and debasement to the unfortunate. Blessed be the memory of that benevolent jurist who struggled so manfully against the barbarism of antichristian ordinances! May the softest air of Paradise calm and heal the frenzy which crossed him in an evil hour; and if separated spirits have any perception of what passes in the world they have left, may his spirit be comforted in seeing the good work which he well begun, perfected to a good end. Our Judges are very fond of asserting that “Christianity is parcel of the law:” it will be more to the purpose when we can truly say that the law is parcel of Christianity. I wish that future ages—on the very improbable supposition that this trifle should exist in a future age—may think the representation of an election a caricature. No reflection is meant upon Nabobs in general. “Wherever the carcase is, there will the vultures be gathered together.” Wherever there is a new way opened to riches, there will be a concourse of those who own no God but Mammon; a Fiend compared to whom Juggernaut is merciful, and Cotytto is pure. But there will also be many who seek wealth as the means of doing good, and many such have returned from the shores of Hindostan. Such characters as my Nabob were probably more common when the East first became the scene of British enterprise than at present. India is now visited by men of better education, more refined habits, more philosophic minds; and moreover, the press—Heaven's blessing upon it!—forbids any man to be very overtly wicked in any quarter of the globe, who wishes to come back and enjoy his gettings in England. It is hardly worth while to mention that most of the lugubrious love ditties in this volume were conceived in the character of the love-lorn “old bachelor.” For what many will deem their silly “mock-platonism,” and “querulous egotism,” I am only dramatically answerable. I, does not always mean myself. They were a gentle pair, whose love began They knew not when—they knew not of a time When they loved not. In the mere sentient life Of unremember'd infancy, whose speech, Like secret love's, is only smiles and tears, The baby Leonard clapp'd his little hands, Leapt in his nurse's arms, and crow'd aloud When Susan was in sight, and utter'd sounds Most strange and strangely sweet, that nothing meant But merely joy, as in the green-wood tree The merry merle awakes his thrilling song, Soon as the cool breath of the vernal dawn Stirs the light leaflets on the motionless boughs. Mute as the shadow of a passing bird On glassy lake, the gentle Susan lay, Hush'd in her meek delight. A dimpled smile Curl'd round her tiny, rosy mouth, and seem'd To sink, as light, into her soft full eyes— A quiet smile, that told of happiness Her infant soul investing, as the bud Infolds the petals of the nascent rose. Born in one week, and in one font baptized, On the same festal day—they grew together, And their first tottering steps were hand in hand, While the two fathers, in half-earnest sport, Betroth'd them to each other. Then 'twas sweet For mother's ears, to hear them lisp and try At the same words, each imitating each; But Leonard was the babe of nimbler tongue, And ‘Sister Susan’ was the first plain phrase His utterance master'd—by that dear kind name He call'd the maid, supplying so a place Which Nature had left void. An only child Of a proud mother and a high-born sire, Full soon he learn'd to mount a palfrey small, Of that dwarf race that prance unclaim'd and free O'er the bleak pastures of the Shetland Isles. And who may tell his glory or his pride When Susan, by her mother's arms upheld, Sat, glad though fearful, on the courser's rear, While he, exulting in his dauntless skill, Rein'd its short testy neck, and froward mouth, Taming its wilful movement to the pace That palfrey suits of wandering lady fair? Bold were his looks, his speech was bold and shrill, His smooth round cheeks glow'd with a ruddy brown, And dark the curls that cluster'd o'er his head, Knotty and close. In every pliant limb A noble boy's ambitious manliness Elastic sprung. Yet child more loving, fond, Ne'er sought the refuge of a parent's side. But Susan was not one of many words, Nor loud of laughter; and she moved as soft As modest Nymphs, in work of artist rare, Seem moving ever. In her delicate eye And damask cheek there dwelt a grace retired, A prophecy of pensive womanhood. And yet, in sooth, she was a happy child; And, though the single treasure of her house, She neither miss'd a brother's love, nor lack'd The blest emotions of a sister's soul. She thought no sister lov'd a brother more Than she her brother Leonard—him who show'd The strawberry lurking in the mossy shade, The nest, in leafy thicket dark embower'd, The squirrel's airy bound. No bliss he knew, No toy had he—no pretty property— No dog—no bird—no fit of childish wrath, That was not hers. The wild and terrible tales His garrulous old nurse o'ernight had told, He duly in the morning told to her, With comments manifold; and when seven years Made him a student of learn'd Lilly's page, With simple, earnest, kindly vanity, He fill'd her wondering ear with all his lore Of tense, and conjugation, noun, and verb; Searching the word-book for all pretty names, All dainty, doating, dear diminutives Which the old Romans used to woo withal. So pass'd those happy seasons, when no law Of jealous custom, no suspected harm Bids fresh virginity beware of man; And, like two sexless bees, from flower to flower, They wander'd unreproved. But soon an age Of fearful wishes found the spotless pair, And Susan felt, unprompted, that the name Of sister was not hers by right of kind. Reserv'd she grew, and though she thought no ill, She sigh'd in fear, and strove to frame her speech To formal phrase of maiden courtesy. Sore wonder'd Leonard at her mien constrain'd, Her flitting blush, her intermitted words, That seem'd unwelcome strangers to her lips, And to her thought unknown. Why thus withdrawn Her trembling hand, that wont in his to lie, Still as the brooding warbler in her nest, Close as the soft leaves of the rose unblown?— Why shrinks she from his kiss, his watchful gaze, With such a faint and half-reproachful smile— Nor longer may permit her flowing hair To seek the pillow of his breast? Ah! why Is he no more her brother? But, ere long, New passion budding in his vernal soul, Fill'd him with joy to think no kindred tie, No common blood forbade the current free Of his warm wistful sighs. The tale is old Of “passionate first love” with all its dreams Sleeping and waking—all its cherish'd pains, Uneasy raptures, quarrels, fantasies, Quaint wiles, and riddles read by lovers' eyes, And bland deceptions meant not to deceive. Though wooing well might seem a useless toil, When Love, a goodly plant, in cradle sown, Shot forth its leaves spontaneous to the warmth Of genial youth, yet Leonard duly paid The appointed duty of an amorous swain, “With adorations and with fertile tears,” And “loyal cantos of contemned love,” As if in truth his Susan were a dame Haughty and fierce, as Lady of Romance, That must be woo'd with blows, and won with scars And homicide. Sometimes a shepherd he, And soft and silly as his fancied flock: Anon an arm'd and errant Paladin, He talk'd of forests dark, and deserts drear, And foes defied, and giants huge o'erthrown,— And all for Susan's sake. Young love is still, Like Eastern sages, parabolical; And bliss, unearn'd, scarce knows itself to be, But by the contrast of imagined woe. What more of patient suit and coy delay, Or passion paid, or maiden pride required, I pause not to relate; nor how, at last, The seemly ceremonial courtship done, With interchange of braided locks and rings, And holy kiss, they seal'd their plighted troth, In their glad parents' sight. Unskill'd am I Such scenes to paint—to me, alas! unknown. Unmeet historian of a golden time, I cannot give the charm of life renew'd To pleasures long forgot; for happy days, Unvaried save by sun, or sunny shower, Are bare of incident as dreamless sleep, Or sweet existence of a flower unseen. Suffice to say, that Leonard and his maid Grew up to man's estate and womanhood. Their pure affection, ripening with their years, Like a bright angel's broad o'ershadowing wings, Guarded their spirits, kept their inmost thoughts All lovely, pure, and beautiful. Secure In the assurance of an authorized pledge, They, unrepining, brook'd their bliss deferr'd By charge parental, till maturer years Should fit them for the cares of wedded life. Alas! too wisely spake the poet wise— “The course of true love never did run smooth,” How clear soe'er the stream. Though like estate, Congenial birth, affection tried and true, Taste, tempers, studies, finely harmonized By sympathy in dissimilitude— Divided excellence, that sought and found Its full perfection in the bond of love, Decreed the union of the happy pair, Whose mutual passion was obedience To those beloved parents, who had wish'd Their offspring blended in a common stock Ere either babe was born; yet eyeless Fate And human baseness wrought the righteous will Of fate-controlling Heaven. The lovely maid Was doom'd on earth to droop, a virgin flower, Unsoil'd of earth, to bloom in Paradise. Accursed faction poisons e'en the fount Of household amity. A man there came Of dubious honour, and of race unknown, Deep laden with the plunder'd wealth of Ind; And he, forsooth, must shine a rising star In Britain's senate, make and unmake laws He learn'd but late to keep; beat down prerogative, “And make bold power look pale”—a patriot he, Profound economist, the people's friend, And champion of reform. Now Leonard's sire Was one of ancient lineage, and estate For many generations handed down, Without an acre added or impair'd— He counted a long line of senators Among his ancestry, and ill could brook The lineal honours of his house usurp'd By the ill-gotten purse of yesterday. And now the day of license was at hand, Britain's septennial Saturnalia, When the soft palm of nice nobility, Ungloved, solicits the Herculean gripe Of hands with bestial slaughter newly stain'd; When ladies stoop their coroneted brows, And patriotic kisses deal to churls A gipsy would refuse; and, reeling ripe, Big Independence, reeking as he goes Through the rank toll-booth, works his burly way To hiccup perjury.—O Mountain Nymph! —O Virgin Liberty! behold thy shrine, And send a snow-blast from thy native hills, Or thy fat offerings will all dissolve And choke the world with incense.—Plutus now, And roaring Bacchus, are thy ministers, While swoln Corruption, like a toad, half-hid Beneath the purple trappings of the throne, Distends her bloated features with a laugh, To hear the many take thy name in vain. Unequal strife had Leonard's sire to wage— Too proud to flatter, and too proud to yield The palm to flatterers, he fondly deem'd Hereditary gratitude—the name Of his time-honour'd house—and all the links That bind the present to the past, and make Each moment sponsor for eternity, Were barriers potent to resist the flood Of pauper treason, back'd with traitorous gold. Hark!—the loud war proclaim'd by drum and fife, And labell'd banners, that affront the sky With gaudy blazonry of factious hate, Turning the innocent hues of flower and field To party shibboleths. The clear blue sky Frown'd on the crimson of the regal rose— Nor spared the maiden blush. Fierce riot rung In homely mansions, long devote to peace, And mild, benignant mirth. From vale to vale The uproar echoed through the spacious shire, The clang o'erpowering of the madding wheels That glow'd incessant in the whirling fog Of sleepy dust that courts the ground in vain. The Sabbath bells alarm the slumbering dead With irreligious peals; old Silence flies From all her hallow'd haunts, and hides her head In the brute dumbness of o'ergorged excess:— Talk not of Hecatombs, imperial feasts, Or antique feats of Roman gluttony; For every alehouse is a temple now, And flocks and herds but half suffice to stay The popular maw.—Not sapient Egypt's god, The lowing Apis, had escaped the knife, Had slavish Egypt ever claim'd the right Of unbought suffrage and election free. Who dare deny—that beast, and fish, and fowl Were made for man? Calves, sheep, and oxen, slain In freedom's cause, by freemen are devour'd— A feller fate attends the generous steed— Outworn with toil, he gluts a freeman's cur. But Leonard—and the gentle Susan? Where Walk they the while? Oft, when the rafter'd hall Shook with the jovial laugh of loyalty, Till each grim ancestor and grandam fair, That on the smoky canvas smiled for aye, In multiplied confusion roll'd around, Would Leonard steal into the quiet air Of pensive Night, Love's trusty confidante, To meet his Susan on the silent hill, And silent sit beneath the silent moon; His hand laid lightly on his Susan's palm, While thousand, thousand voices, heard afar, Were soft as murmurs of the distant ocean— Solemn and soft—and yet a weary sound To her, who knew her parent's heart estranged From him she long'd to call her second sire; For Susan's father, reckless of her tears, Of ancient neighbourhood, and deeds of love Too natural to call for gratitude— Blind to the pleadings of the meek, sad eyes Of his child's mother, and his only child— Had pledged his voice, and purse, and utmost power To his friend's rival—whether borne away By the loud torrent of the popular cry, That universal voucher, for whose truth No man can vouch—or vex'd by wounded pride For prudent counsel by his friend refused, Or by congenial baseness, and the bent And instinct of an earthy, purblind spirit That hated honour, as a darkling fiend Detests the sun, to kindred baseness drawn— My Muse, unversed in vileness, not reveals. Fearful the perils that beset our youth, But are there none that lie in wait for age? Is not the sight, whose erring faith mistakes An exhalation for a guiding star, Better than total blindness? Good it were To be a Persian, and adore the sun At morn and eve—or deem the changeful moon Imperial arbitress of fickle fate, To hail the day-dawn as a visible God, Or, trembling, think the terrible vast sea A living Godhead in a wrathful mood, Rather than dwell within the gaol of sense, To see no God in all the beauteous world— To feel no God in man.— 'Twas sad to mark The passive Susan pace the public way; Her meek, obedient head with weight oppress'd Of gaudy colours, that but ill became Her pale fair cheek—to hear her soft low voice Reluctant task'd to warble scurril rhymes, Set by some ale-bench Pindar to such tunes As carmen whistle. Worse it was to find The Nabob and his train of Bacchanals Establish'd in her home; but worst to see Her Leonard welcomed with such courtesy As courtiers use to men they hate and fear. In vain the eulogists of good old times Upheld the good old cause. New wealth prevail'd, And Leonard's sire, the lavish contest past, Found he had fell'd his ancient oaks in vain, In vain had pawn'd his green, ancestral fields, Bereft his son of just and lineal hopes, Quench'd the grey vigour of his kindly age With loyal draughts, and joyless nights of noise In vain. Indignant he is doom'd to hear The upstart's triumph clamouring at his doors— And finds—the sole reward of thousands spent For Church and King—the prudent world's contempt, Unspotted honour, and a shatter'd frame, A broken fortune, and a broken heart. Sad change for Leonard—to no gainful art Or science bred, untaught to bow his way Through servile crowds, to fix the flitting eye Of selfish patronage, or cling secure To the huge timbers of the rotting state A battening barnacle, by sloth retain'd, And nourish'd by decay. His wants, though few, Were yet refined, and he had known the bliss Of leisure, which is truest liberty. And—cruel fate—the time is now fulfill'd, The year, the month, the long expected day Of expectation, which had look'd so fair In the dim brightness of futurity— The very day prefix'd to shake the tower Of the old ivied church with wedding peals, When Susan should have trod the church-way path A blushing bride. The weary week past o'er, And Leonard, in the melancholy hall, Sat listless, gazing on the naked walls, And bare, cold floors—for greedy law had stripp'd The antique mansion of its tapestry, And Vandal officers had laid their hands On musty relics of the olden time, On smoky pedigrees, and antlers vast Of stags, that fell ere the great Baron fought At Agincourt; brown bills in rusty ranks, Primeval guns, of formidable length, With stubborn matchlocks—all immovable; Fragments of centuries past, not worth a doit— But precious ever, and twice precious now, When all the glory, bounty, wealth, and power Derived from dark imaginative days, Was clean departed from the honour'd line— Say rather, vanish'd from the realm of chance, To be for aye a thought, a deathless truth, A thing of monumental memory. “'Tis a fair show; a goodly bridal-bower; Yon grim officials too! attendance meet To grace a marriage feast.” Thus Leonard spake, And could have laugh'd in downright agony; But check'd his soul, and almost thought he bore His grief most patiently; for sorrow seem'd Reproachful to his father. Mute he sat, Culling old saws and comfortable texts, To cheer the old man's desolate heart, and still Rejecting all; when lo! a message came, An instant summons from his Susan's sire. Like one lone wandering on a perilous moor, That hears a voice in darkness, and proceeds, In desperate haste, to meet or friend or foe, Regardless whether—Leonard hurried forth To meet his doom. A little gloomy hope, Much like despair, was kindled in his eye, And made his heart beat audible and hard. The faint alarm had caught his father's view, As silently he clasp'd his palsied hand; The old man shook his head with such a smile As had no comfort in 't. With louring looks, And a proud menial's scanted courtesy, Was Leonard usher'd to the well-known room Vocal so oft with Susan's melody, And gladden'd with her smile. 'Tis double woe, The woe that comes where joy was sweetest found. There sat the parents of his wife betroth'd, Dear as his own, in happier days, and call'd By the same filial names. The mother meek, With sad o'ercharged eyes that dare not weep, Obey'd the mandate of her husband's hand, And hastily, without a word, withdrew, Casting on Leonard one mute pleading glance, That said—‘Remember, he is Susan's father— Though your's he will not be.’—Long pause ensued— At length the stern man spake: “Young Sir,” said he, “I have an irksome duty to perform, But 'tis a duty that I owe my child. Few words are best—my daughter is not for you— My reasons need no tongue to plead for them— Urge not my promise—you are not the youth To whom my word was given—I pledged the girl To the inheritor of my friend's estate, Not to the heir of my foe's beggary.” Big-hearted Leonard neither dropt a tear, Nor spake reproachful word; more grieved to find A soul so base in form so long revered, Than for the signet set to his despair— The coward murder of his dying hope, And the sweet records of young innocent years Transform'd to shame-envenom'd agony. Yet long he linger'd at the gate, and raised To Susan's chamber window a long look Of resignation deep—a long farewell; But she was nowhere to be seen; and yet, He fondly dream'd—what will not lovers dream?— He heard her sigh, and leant a listening ear To hear her sigh once more.—Full well he knew, Though nought distrusting Susan's simple faith, His claim annull'd—his suit by her forbidden. Not all the sophistry of love, though urged With eloquence divine, and looks of warmth To thaw the “chaste and consecrated snow.” On Dian's bosom, That lies on Dian's lap.Shakspeare's Timon of Athens. could induce the maid To wave obedience, or make head against The strong religion of her filial fear. So, hopeless—purposeless, he loiter'd home, If home it could be call'd—begarrison'd With portly bailiffs, and by duns besieged; Keen-eyed solicitors, and purple hosts, And sallow usurers—miscreants, that grow fat, On general ruin—bills mis-spelt, as long As his old father's boasted pedigree. Proud Leonard felt it shame, a burning shame, To waste a sigh upon his personal grief Amid the helpless downfall. Nought he told, His father nought inquired, for all was known Without the painful index of sad speech. They talk'd of things long past—of better times, And seem'd as they were merry. 'Twas the last, The saddest night beneath the ancient roof. The next beheld them inmates of a gaol— And gaol-bird was the word that Susan heard, Whenever Leonard or his sire was named. There is no man can love as woman loves, With such a holy, pure, and patient fire, Or Susan had gone mad.—She pray'd, and wept, And wept, and pray'd—but never look'd reproach To him, for whose degenerate soul she pray'd— And pray'd she might not scorn him, might not hate The author of her being. Though no word— No brief adieu—had closed the failing eyes Of her departing hope—for every port And inlet to her home was closed, and none Dared name her lover; yet firm faith survived, The strong assurance of a vow enroll'd In heaven, and her own wise innocence Forbade suspicion of her Leonard's truth, And bade her live, though sure a blessed thing For her it were to die. What life was hers! Hard-eyed rebuke, and wrath and ribald scorn, Solicitation of a mother's tears, And the perpetual siege of fancies fair Reflected from old days of happiness, With Babel dissonance her heart assailing, Made misery many-faced—a hideous dream— A monster multiform—a dizzy round Of aye-revolving aspects—woeful all. Sweet Susan ever was a lowly maid, Unpractised in the arts of maiden scorn; Yet she could teach “her sorrow to be proud,” And walk the earth in virgin majesty, As one who owed no homage to its rules, No tribute to its faithless flattery. She loved her silent, solitary woe, And thought, poor soul! all nature sympathised With her lone sorrow. Every playful breeze That dallied with the moonlight on the leaves, Sung mournful solace to her wounded spirit, As if it were indeed a mournful sound, Mournfully kind. The gladsome nightingale, That finds the day too short for half her bliss, And warbles on, when all the tuneful grove Is silent as the music of the spheres, Sounded to her like wakeful melancholy Dwelling on themes of old departed joy. The nightingale grew dumb—the cuckoo fled— And broad-eyed Summer glared on hill and plain— And still no word. Was Leonard dead, or flown Before the swallow? Doth he dwell forlorn As the last primrose in the shadowy glade, That bloom'd too late, and must too soon decline? The birds are silent, and the shallow brook Is hardly heard beneath the dark, dark weight Of over-roofing boughs! And is he gone— Gone like the riotous waters of the rill, That smoking, gleaming, whitening on their way, Display'd an earth-born Iris to the sun, And in their beauty and their pride exhaled? Ah no! He lives, in sunless prison pent, Watching the death-bed of his prison'd sire; Who, on low pallet stretch'd, in noisome den, Scarce wider than a captive lion's cage, Breathes the mephitic and incarcerate fog That morn not freshens nor still even cools: His dosing slumbers broke with clank of chains, And felons' curses, and the horrid mirth Of reckless misery. Beside him sat His once gay consort, squalid now, and lost To self-respect, with grey dishevell'd locks, All loosely wrapt in rags of silk array. Her aspect, channell'd with impatient tears; Now sullen mute, now loud in wordy woe, Chiding the murmurs of her gasping spouse, And the meek patience of her boy. 'Twas well The poor old man heard little, nothing mark'd, For drowsy death lay heavy at the gates Of outward sense, and the beleaguered brain Refused its office. Long he lay, and seem'd A moving, panting corse, without a mind, By some foul necromancer's horrid charm In life detain'd. No word to living soul He spake, and though he sometimes mutter'd prayers, His understanding pray'd not. Leonard pray'd— But silent as the voiceless intercourse Of spirits bodiless—whose every thought Is adoration. Not in Heaven unmark'd The mute petition. Sudden as the gleam Of heavenly visitation, a new light, A glory settled on the pallid face Of Leonard's sire. The dull unmeaning eye Of dotage and disease, in rapture fixt, Glow'd with a saintly fire. The imprison'd soul, As rushing gladly to its dungeon doors, Peer'd out, and look'd abroad—one moment—then Ecstatic flew. “I am going to leave thee, boy— I thought to leave thee in far other plight— But that which is, must be. Unseemly 'twere To see a dying father claim his son's Forgiveness—else might I implore of thee To spare thy foolish father's memory. The world will deal ungently with my name, But, Leonard, never let thy heart consent To the blind, coward, malice of the crowd! And if the prayer of thy father's spirit Be heard in Paradise, my soul shall pray, Even at the foot of the Almighty's throne, For thy best welfare. Good it is that thou Hast been afflicted in thy lusty youth, So happier days shall close thine honour'd age— And, dear my child, I am in haste to Heaven; My sin is pardon'd, and a mystic robe Of woof celestial decks my better part. But my poor limbs—far from the reverend dust Of my dead ancestry—without a chaunt, Hatchment, or hearse, or green memorial sprigs Of shiver'd box-wood, and sweet rosemary, Must soon be earth'd up in a vulgar grave. The hireling shepherd of this wretched fold Will hurry o'er his ill-paid task of prayer— And I shall be forgot. But when the smile Of Fortune shall repay thy honest toil, Restore thy father's relics to the home Of thy forefathers' bones. Thy mother—know She is thy mother, and thy father's wife. O God, receive my spirit!” Thus he spake— Clasp'd his son's hand—and died without a groan. Did Leonard weep? Oh, no; he knew too well The selfish baseness of a private woe— He shed no tear upon the barren grave, But cast a long, sad, yearning look to Heaven, And thought of Susan and his sainted sire. There is a spell in patient filial love, Can charm the deafest and the hardest heart, And e'en relax the gripe of hungry law. So the bleak mercy of a liberal age Dismiss'd poor Leonard, and his mother, mark'd With branded and convicted poverty, From the ungenial refuge of a gaol Into the general air. 'Tis sweet to see The day-dawn creeping gradual o'er the sky: The silent sun at noon is bright and fair, And the calm eve is lovely; but 'tis sad To sink at eve on the dark dewy turf, And feel that none in all the countless host Of glimmering stars beholds one little spot, One humble home of thine. The vast void sky, In all its trackless leagues of azure light, Has not one breath of comfort for the wretch Whom houseless penury enfranchises, A brother freeman of the midnight owl, A sworn acquaintance of the howling winds And flaggy-pinion'd rain. Now Leonard leaves The prison gates;—but whither will he go? Must he, the high-born, high-soul'd youth, implore The stinted kindness of offended kin— Crave pardon for the deadly sin of need; And wrench from shame, not love, a pittance less Than goes to feed the hounds? This he must do, Or eat the bread of loathsome beggary; For though he did not scorn the honest plough, He knew not how to guide it. Rustic churls Bemock'd his threadbare, pale gentility, And would not grant him leave to toil for hire. Oh, cruel fate!—his spirit stoop'd to beg A shelter for his mother—'Twas refused. No matter—There was kindness in the clouds, And son and mother lay secure, beneath The sylvan roof of charitable boughs. The Lady, proudest of the proud, forgot Her in-bred pride, and wept consoling tears, And praying—pour'd a blessing on her child. There is more mercy in the merciful God Than e'er inhabited the pregnant eyes Of men, who waste unprofitable tears For all imaginable woes, and leave The poor uncomforted, to wail their own. There came a kinsman from a foreign land, O'erfraught with wealth,—whose British heart, unspoil'd, Had stood the siege of Oriental suns, And the dire sap of all-transmuting gold— A rich good man.—He blamed the tardy winds Which would not let him free his old kind coz From durance vile of helpless poverty; But still the son survived—the widow'd wife Still drew her woeful breath—and he had power To call the orphan to a friendly home— To bid the widow wear her comely weeds Beside a plenteous and a smiling board. Few days transpired, and Leonard was again The heir of thousands—the undoubted lord Of his paternal acres, all redeem'd. The ancient pictures re-assumed their place In the old smoky hall—the antique arms In dusty state resumed their dusk repose. The branching trophies, and the furry spoils Of many an oft-related, endless chase, Found their due station; while the worn-out steeds, Repurchased, roam'd the venerable park, From vilest drudgery freed. The hallow'd bones Of the late lord, unearth'd, were laid in state With old, ancestral, lordly rottenness; And if the pride of earth be known in Heav'n, Earth's noblest pride—then Leonard's Angel sire Look'd down exultant on his marble tomb, And blest his only child. And shall no drop Of all this blessing comfort Susan's soul? Right sorry now, I ween, her sordid sire For his o'er prudent haste, and breach of faith:— He saw his daughter's beauty marr'd with tears; Her soul benumb'd with dull continuous woe, And a strange wildness in her sad, soft eye, That rather told of visionary gleams, And silent commerce with the viewless world, Than aught which man may love. If e'er she spake, Her voice was hollow as the moaning wind, An echo of despair. Yet she would sing Throughout the long hours of the frosty night: It would have wrung your very heart to hear her— She sang so like a ghost. “Will the proud youth,” Thus, measuring other natures by his own, Her father thought—“Will Leonard love her still? Will the large-acred heir, whom late I spurn'd, Accept my child—when all her bloom is fled— Her eye no longer bright—and her sweet wits By sorrow crazed? I did him grievous wrong— And will he sue me for my wither'd rose, And give the glory of his ancient name— The lusty verdure of his years, and all His hopes on earth, to a poor moonstruck maid, The daughter of his father's enemy?” Base, slanderous fears! For Leonard's love was strong Beyond the might of mutability. No rash impatience of the youthful blood, No sudden liking of enamour'd sense, His vow had prompted—and no change of hue, Nor loss of lively cheer, the work of woe, Could shake his truth. I need not say—how soon His suit renew'd—nor with what faint excuse By Susan's sire admitted.—Oh, blind haste!— Of unadvised bliss—that came so late, And wrought its tyrannous effect so soon. For sorrow had become the element, The pulse, the sustenance of Susan's soul, And sudden joy smote like the fire of Heaven, That, while it brightens, slays. A hectic flush, Death's crimson banner, cross'd her marble cheek— And it was pale again.—The strife was past— She lies, a virgin corse, in Leonard's arms.— He saw her shrouded relics laid to rest In his ancestral sepulchre. That done, He was a wanderer long in foreign lands: But when the greenness of his agony Was sere with age, the hoary man return'd; And after some few years in virtue spent, He died.—His bones repose in Susan's grave; And he is with her, in the land where love, Immortal and unstain'd, is all in all. ALBUM VERSES. As dark hair straggling o'er a snow-white breast, Or the light tracks by fairy feet imprest, Or those which tremulous music would indite In the pure ether of a summer's night, If music's course were palpable to sight,— So fine, in sable tinct and sinuous grace, The meaning lines which female fingers trace. Well then may I, whose characters are quaint As antique legend of a monkish saint, As hieroglyphic of the wise Egyptian, Or prentice-posing doctor's learn'd prescription; As Runic, Coptic, Chaldee, Erse, or Ogham, Or schoolboy's tasks, for which their masters flog 'em; As hand of cooks, by love impelled to scrawl, Or hand of Bishops, which is worst of all;— Well may I view the argent field with fear, And all the soft memorials treasured here, When ask'd by one to whom I can't say nay, My poor poetic mite of verse to pay; When bid the melody of song to garble, Mix hemp with finest flax, and brick with marble. I own I like to see my works in print; The page looks knowing, though there's nothing in't: But still a thought shows neatest, to my mind, In well-bound Album penn'd by maiden kind. So smooth each well-turn'd distich seems to flow, So bright appears each ardent thought to glow, So close the epithets in front adhere To their o'ertopping subjects in the rear, While, like tall Captains, leading each his column, As Ensigns spruce, and like Drum-Majors solemn, In single file the capitals aspire, Proud of their comely shape and trim attire: We think our thoughts so very fine are grown, We scarce can think they ever were our own. But how can partial judgment ere be bribed By halting rhymes in uncouth text inscribed? Or who 'll admire me when, poor barren elf, I scarce, with all my pains, admire myself? In eastern tales we read, how, in one night, A gorgeous palace grew by magic might, A solid pile of Iris-tinted light. Whate'er of beautiful or strange, the deep, Unmoved by winds, and hush'd in endless sleep, In its abysmal waters held a fee, Or the dark earth's infernal treasury, Withheld from mortal touch, and mortal view, Spontaneous in that wondrous fabric grew. As soft and silent as the falling dew, It came by strong behest of wizard power, Nor broke the stillness of the darksome hour. At once mature its radiant domes it rears 'Mid groves of spice and incense, odorous tears Dropping from hoary trunks, that tell of distant years, As if a weary age had passed away In time-forgetting sleep since yesterday. There the dark cypress waved its lofty spire By walls of ice, and battlements of fire, And where the mighty banian's “echoing shade” The fig tree, not that kind for fruit renown'd, But such as at this time to Indians known, In Malabar or Deccan spreads her arms, Branching so broad and long, that in the ground The bended twigs take root, and daughters grow About the mother tree, a pillar'd shade High overarch'd, with echoing walks between. Paradise Lost, b. ix. The palace is Aladdin's. It is needless to mention how much my description is indebted to Thalaba. The imagination of Southey is as thoroughly Arabesque as that of Moore's is Persian. Thalaba, Kehama, and Lalla Rookh, have completely orientalized our imaginations. I love Albums. They sometimes procure a sunny look, or a kind word, for some hard-favoured son of the muse, that else might wither in the “shade of cold neglect.” Surely there is a moral value in whatever enables a poor man to confer a kindness. Spreads far and wide its verdurous colonnade, The silver portals sent their lucid streams Adown the umbrageous aisles in lengthen'd beams: The fading hues, so fair, so fleet, alas! That o'er the cheek of eve like blushes pass In unabating beauty, here were blended, Unchanged to last till earth itself were ended. Now, strange to say, this work of mystic art, The old world's wonder, stored in every part With every idol of a wanton heart,— From artist's negligence, or art's defect, Or some close purpose of the architect, One window had, unfinish'd, unadorn'd, An uncouth gap, forgot, or shunn'd, or scorn'd; A yawning void deform'd the gayest bower That e'er receiv'd a royal paramour; And stranger still, not all the flowery groves That waved around, nor all the fair alcoves, Elaborate pride of oriental loves, Nor radiant splendours that outshone the skies, From that unsightly blank could screen the critic eyes: It grew the talk of all who loved to wonder, It help'd the crowd to stare, the wise to blunder,— The magic beauties ne'er perplex'd their soul, But all were gravell'd with that frightful hole. Wild is the tale, but such in fact we find The course and current of the general mind. So fairest things, unnumber'd and unnoted, Pass with the hour while rare defects are quoted— The timeless frost that in their cradle nips, The babes of April, or one short eclipse, One blighting meteor's momentary blaze, Outlast in fame an age of sunny days. So gentle lady—may I freely call thee My gentle friend—it haply may befal thee. When this fair volume, like an honour'd fane, Or holy tomb of Saint or Martyr slain, In Truth's defence, or virgin void of stain, With gems of verse from many a region brought, Shall gleam effulgent with untainted thought, And each soft hand that loves to rest in thine, With dear memorial decks the beauteous shrine, Then the wild words, that like bewilder'd chimes Limp into tune, and stumble upon rhymes, And these rude characters, the meet apparel Of the strange fancies of my old-world carol, Shall oft detain the eye that heedless strays O'er the smooth page, which calls for nought but praise. Where all's so good, the critic senses starve all, But lines like mine will suit them to a marvel. Nay sometimes many a softer gaze beguile, And change a winning to a wondering smile; May light the orbs of darkly-rolling eyes, With the wide brilliance of a gay surprise; May prompt some voice in tones acute to ask, To whom was given, or who usurp'd the task, To set, 'mid famous Bards' melodious strains, The product of his own fantastic brains? What strange acquaintance of a maiden fair Could plant a thistle in her prim parterre? Then may'st thou say—but say whate'er you choose, Or if you will, confess yourself my muse. AN OLD MAN'S WISH. I have lived, and I have loved, Have lived and loved in vain; Some joys, and many woes have proved, That may not be again; My heart is cold, my eye is sere, Joy wins no smile, and grief no tear. Fain would I hope, if hope I could, If sure to be deceived, There's comfort in a thought of good, Tho' 'tis not quite believed— For sweet is hope's wild warbled air, But—Oh—its echo is despair. THE SABBATH-DAY'S CHILD. TO ELIZABETH, INFANT DAUGHTER OF THE REV. SIR RICHARD FLEMING, BART. Pure, precious drop of dear mortality, Untainted fount of life's meandering stream, Whose innocence is like the dewy beam Of morn, a visible reality, Holy and quiet as a hermit's dream: Unconscious witness to the promised birth Of perfect good, that may not grow on earth, Nor be computed by the worldly worth And stated limits of morality; Fair type and pledge of full redemption given, Through Him that saith “Of such is the kingdom of Heaven.”— Sweet infant, whom thy brooding parents love For what thou art, and what they hope to see thee, Unhallow'd sprites and earth-born phantoms flee thee; Thy soft simplicity, a hovering dove, That still keeps watch, from blight and bane to free thee, With its weak wings, in peaceful care outspread, Fanning invisibly thy pillow'd head, Strikes evil powers with reverential dread, Beyond the sulphurous bolts of fabled Jove, Or whatsoe'er of Amulet or charm Fond Ignorance devised to save poor souls from harm. To see thee sleeping on thy mother's breast, It were indeed a lovely sight to see— Who would believe that restless sin can be In the same world that holds such sinless rest? Happy art thou, sweet babe, and happy she Whose voice alone can still thy baby cries, Now still itself; Yet pensive smiles, and sighs, And the mute meanings of a mother's eyes Declare her thinking, deep felicity: A bliss, my babe, how much unlike to thine, Mingled with earthly fears, yet cheer'd with hope divine. Thou breathing image of the life of Nature! Say rather, image of a happy death— For the vicissitudes of vital breath, Of all infirmity the slave and creature, That by the act of being perisheth, Are far unlike that slumber's perfect peace Which seems too absolute and pure to cease, Or suffer diminution, or increase, Or change of hue, proportion, shape, or feature; A calm, it seems, that is not, shall not be, Save in the silent depths of calm eternity. A star reflected in a dimpling rill That moves so slow it hardly moves at all; The shadow of a white-robed waterfall, Seen in the lake beneath when all is still; A wandering cloud, that with its fleecy pall Whitens the lustre of an autumn moon; A sudden breeze that cools the cheek of noon, Not mark'd till miss'd—so soft it fades, and soon— Whatever else the fond inventive skill Of Fancy may suggest can not supply Fit semblance of the sleeping life of infancy. Calm art thou as the blessed Sabbath eve, The blessed Sabbath eve when thou wast born; Yet sprightly as a summer Sabbath morn, When surely 'twere a thing unmeet to grieve; When ribbons gay the village maids adorn, And Sabbath music, on the swelling gales, Floats to the farthest nooks of winding vales, And summons all the beauty of the dales. Fit music this a stranger to receive; And, lovely child, it rung to welcome thee, Announcing thy approach with gladsome minstrelsy. So be thy life—a gentle Sabbath, pure From worthless strivings of the work-day earth: May time make good the omen of thy birth, Nor worldly care thy growing thoughts immure, Nor hard-eyed thrift usurp the throne of mirth On thy smooth brow. And though fast-coming years Must bring their fated dower of maiden fears, Of timid blushes, sighs, and fertile tears, Soft sorrow's sweetest offspring, and her cure; May every day of thine be good and holy, And thy worst woe a pensive Sabbath melancholy. MAY, 1832. Is this the merry May of tale and song? Chill breathes the North—the sky looks chilly blue, The waters wear a cold and iron hue, Or wrinkle as the crisp wave creeps along, Much like an ague fit. The starry throng Of flowrets droop o'erdone with drenching dew, Or close their leaves at noon, as if they knew, And felt in helpless wrath, the season's wrong. Yet in the half-clad woods the busy birds Chirping with all their might to keep them warm; The young hare flitting from her ferny form; The vernal lowing of the amorous herds; And swelling buds impatient of delay, Declare it should be, tho' it is not, May. ISABEL. Where dwells she now? That life of joy That seem'd as Time could ne'er destroy, Nor frail infectious sense alloy, Its self-derived and self-sufficing gladness? Abides she in the bounds of space, Or like a thought, a moment's grace, Is she escaped from time and place, The dull arithmetic of prison'd sadness? May she behold this spot of earth, This human home, that saw her birth, Her baby tears, her infant mirth, The first quick stirrings of her human mind? May she return to watch the flowers She planted last in fairy bowers?— They freshen yet with summer showers, And gambol with the frolic summer wind. That lovely form, that face so bright, That changeful image of delight, May it no more to waking sight, Or spiritual ken, in very truth appear? That visible shape, that kind warm glow— That all that Heaven vouchsafed to shew— 'Tis gone. 'Twas all our sense could know, Of her we loved, whom yet we hold so dear. The world hath lost the antique faith, In shade and spectre—warning wraith, That wander'd forth to blast, and scathe Poor earth-clogg'd, dark humanity. No more the mystic craft of hell, In cavern mirk, with impious spell, Evokes the naked souls that dwell In uncreated night's inanity. 'Tis well that creed is out of date, And men have found, at last, though late, That loathing fear, and fearful hate, And rankling vengeance, all are cruel liars; And all the doctrine that they teach Of ghosts that roam when owlets screech, Is but the false and fatal speech Of guilty terrors, or of worse desires. But is there not a charm in love, To call thy spirit from above? Oh—had I pinions like a dove, Were I like thee, a pure enfranchised soul, Then might I see thee as thou art, Receive thee in my inmost heart; But can it be? She has no part In all she loved beneath the steadfast pole. REPLY. Ah—well it is—since she is gone, She can return no more, To see the face so dim and wan, That was so warm before. Familiar things would all seem strange, And pleasure past be woe; A record sad of ceaseless change, Is all the world below. The very hills, they are not now The hills which once they were; They change as we are changed, or how Could we the burden bear? Ye deem the dead are ashy pale, Cold denizens of gloom— But what are ye, who live to wail, And weep upon their tomb? She pass'd away, like morning dew, Before the sun was high; So brief her time, she scarcely knew The meaning of a sigh. As round the rose its soft perfume, Sweet love around her floated; Admired she grew—while mortal doom Crept on, unfear'd, unnoted. Love was her guardian Angel here, But love to death resign'd her; Tho' love was kind, why should we fear, But holy death is kinder? FRAGMENT. What is the life of man? From first to last, Its only substance, the unbeing past! The infant smiling in its sleep must dream Of something past, before the vexing beam Of daylight smote the unaccustom'd eye, Ere the faint mother heard its first faint cry; Lull'd in its rocking nest, it seeks in vain For what has been, and ne'er can be again. The child, through every maze of wakening lore, Hunts the huge shadow of what was before, Sees his old toys in misty phantoms glide, 'Twixt hope and dim oblivion magnified; As oft on misty hills huge spectres run, And stalk gigantic from the setting sun— Still urging onward to the world unseen, Yet wishing, hoping nought, but what has been. But what has been? But how, and when, and where? Was there a time, when, wandering in the air, The living spark existed, yet unnamed, Unfixt, unqualitied, unlaw'd, unclaim'd, A drop of being, in the infinite sea, Whose only duty, essence, was to be? Or must we seek it, where all things we find, In the sole purpose of creative mind— Or did it serve, in form of stone or plant, Or weaving worm, or the wise politic ant, Its weary bondage—ere the moment came, When the weak spark should mount into a flame? TO ? I love thee—none may know how well, And yet—I would not have thee love me; To thy good heart 'twere very hell, To love me dear, and not approve me. Whate'er thou lov'st it is not thine, But 'tis thyself—then sad it were, love, If thou for every sin of mine, Should weep, repent,—mayhap, despair—love. Then love me not—thou can'st not scorn; And mind—I do not bid thee hate me; And if I die, oh, do not mourn, But if I live, do new create me. EXPERTUS LOQUITUR. “'TIS SAD EXPERIENCE SPEAKS.” There never was a blessing, or a curse, So sweet, so cruel, as a knack of verse. When the smug stripling finds the way to rhyme, Glad as the wild bee 'mid a bed of thyme; With dulcet murmuring, all a summer's day, With many a scrap of many a purposed lay— Fitful, yet gentle, as a summer wind, Pleased with himself, and pleased with all mankind, Sure of the praise which partial friends bestow, He breathes in bliss, if bliss may be below. Pass some few years—and see where all will end. The hireling scribe, estranged from every friend, Or if one friend remain, 'tis one so brave, He will not quit the wreck he cannot save; The good man's pity, and the proud man's scorn, The Muse's vagabond, he roams forlorn— Thought, wit, invention, tenderness have left him, All wealth of mind, save empty rhyme, bereft him— Yet write he must, for still he needs must eat— Retail fantastic sorrow by the sheet— Sing in his garret of the flowery grove, And pinch'd with hunger, wail the woes of love— Oh may all Christian souls while yet 'tis time, Renounce the World, the Flesh, the Devil, and Rhyme. A FAREWELL. In these “piping times of peace,” undergraduates take the place of Ensigns, and the close of the Long Vacation is attended with the same gales of sighs, and showers of tears, as heretofore the sailing of a regiment for actual service. Examinations are as terrible to the fair as battles, and the future first-class man, or wrangler, is as interesting as the possible hero. There is something very fascinating about an Undergraduate; he is a rose unblown, and wears “the beauty of promise;” he is a member of an ancient establishment, therefore his youth and freshness are at once contrasted and sanctified by beautiful antiquity; he is a spring flower growing on the steeple of a gothic cathedral. He is enough a man to make his notice worth having by a young lady, and yet so much a boy, that ladies of a certain age can make a pet of him. He has the reputation of learning without the odium of displaying it; above all, he has a certificate of gentility, which, let his real rank and fortune be what it will, passes unchallenged everywhere but in his own University. There, indeed, he is under the necessity of proving and maintaining his caste, and the stain of a mercantile or agricultural connection can only be washed out with claret. Everywhere else the “Collegian” is absolute sumptus, a gentleman. But this enviable distinction belongs to Oxford and Cambridge alone. Edinburgh or Glasgow are no recommendation except to phrenological females, and Trinity College, Dublin, is as alien to English associations as Salamanca or Benares. The London University may have its day, but its day is not yet come. At present it is looked upon as coldly by the petticoat as by the gown. Should a youth be introduced to a fair partner at a country ball as a collegian, and prove, after all, to be only a member of Stincomalee, the lady's delicacy would be as much shocked as if she were to find that the very delightful naval officer with whom she had been dancing under the ambiguous title Captain, was the skipper of a small vessel engaged in the Irish butter trade. It is well: the members of the liberal establishment must be gentlemen, if they desire to be accepted as such. Learning, of itself, confers no rank in England. It does not even give the éclat of a fashionable lion. But, as the passport to learned professions, it enables a man, with good conduct, to overcome any disadvantage of birth, and to achieve a place in the best circles of society. Perhaps this is as it should be. The peculiar advantage of being an Oxonian or a Cantab is specially felt in the vacation, and in the country. In London they form a pleasant variety indeed, but excite no commotion. They are but as a drop of wine in the ocean. In Liverpool, or Manchester, they are out of place. The academical aristocracy is too strong a discord in the commercial concert. In Bath or Cheltenham they degenerate into mere gentlemen loungers; they partake, but they do not create or authorise, the general dissipation. But in small villages, with a good neighbourhood and romantic scenery, they are just what they should be. The custom of reading parties is one of the favourable signs of the times. They read very little: if men want to read, let them take a back-room in Cheapside, or the county gaol. At Ambleside, in Wales, in the Isle of Wight, or the Highlands, what have Euclid or Aristotle to do? But they gladden the waters with their music, and the fair with their gallantry; and what is better still, fill their imagination with beautiful images, and their hearts with kind feelings. It was on a rusticating (not a rusticated) Cantab that these lines were composed. He was a poet in thought, but either “wanted the accomplishment of verse,” or which is more probable, concealed his possession of it. Long will his amiable manners and green-ribboned guitar, be remembered in Grasmere. NOT ORIGINALLY WRITTEN IN THE AUTHOR'S OWN NAME. Sweet vale, tho' I must leave Thy green hills and thy waters, Nor sing again at eve, To charm thy winsome daughters, Yet I shall fondly think of thee, And thy fair maids will think of me, When I am far away. I'll think of thee, but not as men, Who vex their souls with thinking, With feverish thirst, the reeky fen Of sluggard memory drinking; Nor shall thy maidens fair and free With ought of sadness think of me, When I am far away. The fairy lake, tho' still it seems, Is evermore a-flowing; A moment ends the silvery gleams That flash as we are rowing. Yet that smooth lake as smooth shall flow, And light oars flash, when gay youths row, When I am far away. So may the tide of virgin life, As smooth, as quick, as clear, If e'er, in momentary strife, It dimple with a tear, As soon regain its sweet repose— And rest in peace, because it flows, For ever on its way. HORACE. Book I., Ode 38. “Persicos odi, puer, apparatus.” Nay, nay, my boy—'tis not for me, This studious pomp of eastern luxury: Give me no various garlands—fine With linden twine, Nor seek, where latest lingering blows The solitary rose. Earnest I beg—add not, with toilsome pain, One far-sought blossom to the myrtle plain, For sure, the fragrant myrtle bough Looks seemliest on thy brow; Nor me mis-seems, while, underneath the vine, Close interweaved, I quaff the rosy wine. DEATH. Oh! weep not for the happy dead, Your tears reproach the Lord; To him her virgin soul was wed, And strong in love, to him she fled From mother's house, and parent's smiling board Alas! we cannot choose but weep, For we are sore bereaven; And all of her that we can keep Is but an image on the deep, The deep calm soul, that shows reflected heaven. If angel spirits aught may know Of hearts they left behind, If e'er they cast a look below, The sacrifice of pious woe May yield a tender joy, even to the angel kind. INANIA MUNERA. Ah! why should pity wet my bier, And give my corse her tardy tear? And the same eye that coldly slew me, With tears untimely warm bedew me? Alas! for harm is fleet as wind, And healing ever lags behind. Perhaps, when life well nigh is spent, She'll faintly smile a sad consent,— And, just before she sees me die, Will heave a kind repentant sigh: For sigh of ruth—Oh, wayward fate!— Will ever come—and come too late. She cannot undo what is done; For, if a smile were like the sun, And sighs more sweet than gales that creep O'er rosy beds where fairies sleep, And every tear like summer rain To thirsty fields—'twere all in vain. For never sun so bright was seen Could make a leaf that's sere be green; Nor spicy gale, nor April shower, Restore to bloom a faded flower: Thus sun, and wind, and balmy rain, And smiles, and sighs, and tears, are vain. TO MY UNKNOWN SISTER-IN-LAW. Mary, our eyes are strangers, but our hearts Are knit in active sympathy of love For one, whom love of thee hath sanctified. The lawless wanderings of his youthful thought For thee he curbed—for thee assumed the yoke Of humble duty—bade the world farewell, With all its vanities of prose and rhyme— The secular pride of startling eloquence, The victory of wordy warfare—all That charm'd his soul in academic bowers. Not small the struggle and the sacrifice, When men of many fancies, daring minds, That for the substance and the form of truth Delight to fathom their own bottomless deeps, Submit to authorised creeds and positive laws— Appointed rites and ceremonial duty— And he, the pastor of a christian flock, That is no hireling drudging at a task Ungenial, nor intruder, bold and proud, Unhallow'd, unanointed, self-inspired, Of all men hath the greatest need of love, To keep his thoughts, his hopes, his heart at home.— If human speech have aught of holiness, 'Tis all comprised in three thrice-holy names Of Father, Husband, Minister of Christ:— Or if a holier title yet there be, That name is Mother. Dearest sister, I Am one of whom thou doubtless hast heard much— Not always well.—My name too oft pronounced With sighs, despondent sorrow, and reproach, By lips that fain would praise, and ever bless me. Yet deem not hardly of me: who best know Most gently censure me,—and who believes The dark inherent mystery of sin Doubts not the will and potency of God To change, invigorate, and purify The self-condemning heart. Good night:—e'en now Perhaps thou art sleeping by my brother's side, Or listening gladly to the soft, sweet breath Of thy dear babe—while I must seek a couch Lonely, and haunted much by visions strange, And sore perplexity of roving dreams, The spectres manifold of murdered hours:— But yet, good night—good be the night to thee, And bright the morrow:—Once again, good night. A MEDLEY. Shall I sing of little rills, That trickle down the yellow hills, To drive the Fairies' water-mills?— Rills, upon whose pebbly brink, Mountain birds may hop and drink— Perching with a neck awry— Darting upwards to the sky— The artless cunning of their eye— Then away, away, away— Up to the clouds that look so grey— Away, away, in the clear blue heaven, Far o'er the thin mist that beneath is driven— Now they sink, and now they soar, Now poised upon the plumy oar— Do they seek—at brightest noon, For the light-inveiled moon? Climbing upwards would they know Where the stars at morning go? If I err not—no—no—no— Soar they high, or skim they low, Every little bird has still His heart beside the mountain rill. What if we have lost the creed, Which thought the brook a God indeed? Or a flood of passionate tears, Inexhaustible by years? Or imagined, in the lymph, The semblance of a virgin nymph, With panting terror, flying ever, From hairy Satyrs' foul endeavour? Hence! phantoms of a blinded age, That dream'd of nought but lust and rage, The echo of a Sabbath bell Is sweeter in the lonely dell, Than the quaint fable of the wood-god's lay, That only warbled to betray. Ah—never, never may the thought be mine, Though sung by poets old in song divine, Which deem'd the pure, and undisturbed sky, The palace of a tyrant deity— Which in the thunder, heard a voice of anger, And ruthless vengeance in the storm's loud clangour, Which found in every whisper of the woods, In every moaning of the voiceful floods, A long record of perishable languish, Immortal echo of a mortal anguish. Nay—mine be still, The happy, happy faith— That in deep silence hymning saith— That every little rill, And every small bird, trilling joyfully— Tells a sweet tale of hope, and love, and peace, Bidding to cease The heart's sharp pangs, aye throbbing woefully. Or shall I sing of happy hours, Number'd by opening and by closing flowers? Of smiles, and sighs that give no pain, And seem as they were heaved in vain— Softly heard in leafy bowers, Blent with the whisper of the vine, The half-blush of the eglantine, And the pure sweetness of the jessamine: What is it those sighs confess? Idle are they, as I guess, And yet they tell, all is not well:— There is a secret, dim, demurring, There is a restless spirit stirring,— Joy itself, the heart o'erloading, Hath a sense of sad foreboding. Then away to the meadows, where April's swift shadows Glide soft o'er the vernal bright patches of green, Like waves on the ocean, the wheat blades in motion, Look blither, and brighter, where sunbeams have been; So little, little joys on earth, Passing gleams of restless mirth— Momentary fits of laughter Still bequeath a blessing after— Flitting by on angel wing— And like voices perishing; At the instant of their birth, Never, never, count their worth, By the time of their enduring— They are garners in a dearth, Pleasant thoughts for age securing— Rich deposits, firm ensuring, Bliss, if bliss below may be, And a joy for memory. Such themes I sang—and such I fain would sing, Oft as the green buds shew the summer near— But what availeth me to welcome spring, When one dull winter is my total year. When the pure snow-drops couch beneath the snow, And storms long tarrying, come too soon at last, I see the semblance of my private woe, And tell it to the dilatory blast. Yet will I hail the sunbeam as it flies— And bid the universal world be glad— With my brief joy all souls shall sympathise— And only I, will all alone be sad. THOUGHTS. Oh, sacred Freedom! thou that art so fair, That all, who once have seen thee, love thee ever— Thou apparition, that hast been so rare That wise men say thou wert embodied never; And learned sages, doating on their lore, Say thou hast been, and never shalt be more. When Reason—that whate'er it is, must be— Was tangled in the complex web of life, And Sin, the fruit of that forbidden tree, Made human choice an everlasting strife; Then every Passion, native to the hour, Claim'd Reason's privilege and Reason's power. Yet some there are, and some that still have been, Who feel, and hate, yet cannot cease to feel The conscious issue of the cause unseen, The fate that whirls around the restless wheel— Some to the stars ascribe the inborn evil, Some to the Gods, and others to the devil, To live without a living soul, To feel the spirit daily pining, Sinking beneath the base control Of mindless chance, itself consigning To the dull impulse of oppressive time, To find the guilt without the power of crime.— Such is the penance, and the meed Of thoughts that, boasting to be free, Spurning the dictates of a practic creed, Are tangled with excess of liberty, Making themselves sole arbiters of right, Trampling on hallow'd use with proud delight. Perchance they roam in Duty's sacred name, Commission'd to erect the world anew— All worldly ties, all interests they disclaim, Sworn votaries of the beautiful and true; But vainly deem their own device, in sooth, The very substance of eternal truth. Their duty still is Duty to deny, To burst her bonds and cast her cords away: As some turn rebels for pure loyalty, And some, to save the soul, the body slay: If any law they own, that law decrees, That sovereign right is born of each man's phantasies. 'Twere woe to tell what lamentable wreck Such dreams may bring upon the public weal, If once restraint be broken from the neck Of such as grossly think, and fiercely feel, In whom the noble parts by Nature lent, Are sway'd and biass'd from their kindly bent. Thralls of the world, to whom the world affords No hope but only this—to toil for food, And eat that they may toil—vassals of lords With slavish minds and tyrant wills endued, Whose only charity is selfish waste, Whose brightest honour 'tis, to sin with taste. The master of a slave is never free, But still himself the slave of sensual fear:— Woe to mankind—for ever doom'd to be The slaves of slaves. The only freedom here Lives in the spirit that disowns the bands, And dares refuse imperious Fate's commands. From age to age, beneath the base control Of servile time, we drudge in sloth or toil; If hope of freedom fire the indigant soul, Then follows terror wild, and bloody spoil— Mad Revolution, like a headlong flood, O'erwhelms alike the evil and the good. ADDRESS TO CERTAIN GOLD FISHES. Restless forms of living light Quivering on your lucid wings, Cheating still the curious sight With a thousand shadowings;— Various as the tints of even, Gorgeous as the hues of heaven, Reflected on your native streams In flitting, flashing, billowy gleams! Harmless warriors, clad in mail Of silver breastplate, golden scale;— Mail of Nature's own bestowing, With peaceful radiance mildly glowing,— Fleet are ye, as fleetest galley Or pirate rover sent from Sallee; Keener than the Tartar's arrow, Sport ye in your sea so narrow. Was the sun himself your sire? Were ye born of vital fire? Or of the shade of golden flowers, Such as we fetch from eastern bowers, To mock this murky clime of ours? Upwards, downwards, now ye glance, Weaving many a mazy dance; Seeming still to grow in size When ye would elude our eyes— Pretty creatures! we might deem Ye were happy as ye seem,— As gay, as gamesome, and as blithe, As light, as loving, and as lithe, As gladly earnest in your play, As when ye gleam'd in far Cathay; And yet, since on this hapless earth There's small sincerity in mirth, And laughter oft is but an art To drown the outcry of the heart; It may be, that your ceaseless gambols, Your wheelings, dartings, divings, rambles, Your restless roving round and round The circuit of your crystal bound,— Is but the task of weary pain, An endless labour, dull and vain; And while your forms are gaily shining, Your little lives are inly pining! Nay—but still I fain would dream That ye are happy as ye seem, Deck'd in Oriental pride, By homely British fire-side. WHAT I HAVE HEARD. I've heard the merry voice of spring, When thousand birds their wild notes fling, Here and there, and every where, Stirring the young and lightsome air;— I've heard the many-sounding seas, And all their various harmonies:— The tumbling tempest's dismal roar, On the waste and wreck-strew'd shore— The howl and the wail of the prison'd waves, Clamouring in the ancient caves, Like a stifled pain that asks for pity:— And I have heard the sea at peace, When all its fearful noises cease, Lost in one soft and multitudinous ditty, Most like the murmur of a far off city:— Nor less the blither notes I know, To which the inland waters flow,— The rush of rocky-bedded rivers, That madly dash themselves to shivers; But anon, more prudent growing, O'er countless pebbles smoothly flowing, With a dull continuous roar, Hie they onward, evermore: To their everlasting tune, When the sun is high at noon, The little billows, quick and quicker, Weave their mazes, thick and thicker, And beneath in dazzling glances, Labyrinthine lightning dances, Snaky network intertwining, With thousand molten colours shining: Mosaic rich with living light, With rainbow jewels gaily dight— Such pavement never, well I ween, Was made, by monarch or magician, For Arab, or Egyptian queen; 'Tis gorgeous as a prophet's vision; And I ken the brook, how sweet it tinkles, As cross the moon-light green it twinkles, Or heard, not seen, 'mid tangled wood, Where the soft stock-dove lulls her brood, With her one note of all most dear— More soothing to the heart than ear. And well I know the smother'd moan Of that low breeze, so small and brief, It seems a very sigh, whose tone Has much of love, but more of grief. I know the sound of distant bells, Their dying falls and lusty swells; That music which the wild gale seizes, And fashions howsoe'er it pleases. And I love the shrill November blast, That through the brown wood hurries fast, And strips its old limbs bare at last; Then whirls the leaves in circling error, As if instinct with life and terror— Now bursting out enough to deafen The very thunder in the heaven; Now sinking dolefully and dreary, Weak as a child with sport a-weary. And after a long night of rain, When the warm sun comes out again, I've heard the myriad-voiced rills, The many tongues, of many hills— All gushing forth in new-born glory, Striving each to tell its story— Yet every little brook is known, By a voice that is its own, Each exulting in the glee, Of its new prosperity. SONNET. All Nature ministers to Hope. The snow Of sluggard Winter, bedded on the hill, And the small tinkle of the frozen rill— The swoln flood's sullen roar, the storms that go With crash, and howl, and horrid voice of woe, Making swift passage for their lawless will— All prophesy of good. The hungry trill Of the lone birdie, cowering close below The dripping eaves—it hath a kindly feeling, And cheers the life that lives for milder hours. Why, then, since Nature still is busy healing, And Time, the waster, his own work concealing, Decks every grave with verdure and with flowers,— Why should Despair oppress immortal powers? BY A FRIEND. I know not whether I am not taking an unwarrantable liberty giving publicity to these stanzas; but their appearance in my volume is a pleasant record of a valuable friendship, and I trust my friend will not be displeased to see his pretty and tender effusion along with his old acquaintances of mine, some of which owe their preservation to his kind opinion of their merits. I have heard thy sweet voice in the song, And listen'd with delight— I've seen thee in the glittering throng, The fairest 'midst the bright— I've mark'd thee smile on gallants gay, And envied them the lot, While from the crowd I turn'd away, Alone regarded not. Oh, Lady! it were vain, I own, To hope for charms like thine! The brow that would beseem a crown Will frown on love like mine: That form of light—that heavenly face, Those eyes of sweetest hue, Were form'd some kingly throne to grace, And not for me to sue. Yet, though forbidden by despair The dream of happier hours— As once I wreath'd thy sunny hair With Summer's brightest flowers— I'll follow still, with love unseen, Thy smile, thy voice's tone; My heart shall own no other queen, But worship thee alone. POLETES APOIETES. No hope have I to live a deathless name, A power immortal in the world of mind, A sun to light with intellectual flame The universal soul of human kind. Not mine the skill in memorable phrase, The hidden truths of passion to reveal, To bring to light the intermingling ways, By which unconscious motives darkling steal; To show how forms the sentient heart affect, How thoughts and feelings mutually combine, How oft the pure, impassive intellect Shares the mischances of his mortal shrine. Nor can I summon from the dark abyss Of time, the spirit of forgotten things, Bestow unfading life on transient bliss— Bid memory live with “healing on its wings.” Or give a substance to the haunting shades, Whose visitation shames the vulgar earth, Before whose light the ray of morning fades, And hollow yearning chills the soul of mirth. I have no charm to renovate the youth Of old authentic dictates of the heart,— To wash the wrinkles from the face of Truth, And out of Nature form creative Art. Divinest Poesy!—'tis thine to make Age young—youth old—to baffle tyrant Time, From antique strains the hoary dust to shake, And with familiar grace to crown new rhyme. Long have I loved thee—long have loved in vain, Yet large the debt my spirit owes to thee, Thou wreath'dst my first hours in a rosy chain, Rocking the cradle of my infancy. The lovely images of earth and sky From thee I learn'd within my soul to treasure; And the strong magic of thy minstrelsy Charms the world's tempest to a sweet, sad measure. Nor Fortune's spite—nor hopes that once have been— Hopes which no power of Fate can give again,— Not the sad sentence—that my life must wean From dear domestic joys—nor all the train Of pregnant ills—and penitential harms That dog the rear of youth unwisely wasted, Can dim the lustre of thy stainless charms, Or sour the sweetness that in thee I tasted. FROM PETRARCH. Se lamentar augelli, o verdi fronde. The birds piped mournfully; the dark green leaves Moved, sweetly trembling, to the summer breeze,— And deep and low, the lucid rill, that weaves Its murmuring mazes in the flowery leas, Warbled along its old monotonies:— Such blended sounds my reckless ear received, And hearing, heard not,—while my spirit grieved, Loving its grief, and feeding its disease. A mournful strain I conn'd—when she for whom I vext my soul, because she was conceal'd, Shone forth on high, to wondering sense reveal'd:— “Why ever thus,” said she, “thy days consume? Dying, I live,—and when I closed my eyes They open'd to the light of Paradise.” REGENERATION. I need a cleansing change within— My life must once again begin— New hope I need, and youth renew'd, And more than human fortitude,— New faith, new love, and strength to cast Away the fetters of the past. Ah! why did fabling Poets tell That Lethe only flows in Hell? As if, in truth, there was no river, Whereby the leper may be clean, But that which flows, and flows for ever, And crawls along, unheard, unseen, Whence brutish spirits, in contagious shoals, Quaff the dull drench of apathetic souls. Ah, no! but Lethe flows aloft With lulling murmur, kind and soft As voice which sinners send to heaven When first they feel their sins forgiven: Its every drop as bright and clear As if indeed it were a tear, Shed by the lovely Magdalen For Him that was despised of men. It is the only fount of bliss In all the human wilderness— It is the true Bethesda—solely Endued with healing might, and holy:— Not once a year, but evermore— Not one, but all men to restore. [Bandusian spring, more gaily bright] O Fons Bandusiæ, splendidior vitro, Dulci digne mero, non sine floribus, Cras donaberis hædo. Bandusian spring, more gaily bright, In thy never-ceasing birth, Than gem compact of solar light, That, fetter'd long in darksome earth, Leaps forth to greet a kindred ray— Thou art worth a Poet's lay. Flowers—them we will not give,— Thou hast plenty of thy own; Little lambkins;—let them live, Thou wert loth to hear them moan: Let them frisk upon thy bourn, And in thee view the budding horn. Well I know, an ancient Poet Promised thee a kid to-morrow— I, a Christian Bard, well know it,— If he paid it, 'twas thy sorrow:— But he never did the thing Which he was constrain'd to sing. Poet he, that would have been A Christian Poet if he could,— One that felt far more, I ween, Than he ever understood,— One that only wanted telling The truth that in his heart was dwelling. Bandusian fount! I know not thee, And learned critics much are troubled, To find, if yet a stream there be, Where, long of yore, thy waters bubbled, And I could almost wish there were not, Since all who loved thee dearly are not. The barren rocks are still the same— The fertile streams are changing ever, So, lives, in nature's endless fame, The Carthaginian's vain endeavour— But, Horace, we can only guess The sweet home of thy happiness. Yet fare thee well, thou lovely spring, And never may thy nymphs desert thee, For while one Bard on earth may sing, Not all the powers of earth can hurt thee: And tho' no lamb to thee we give, Blest shalt thou be as long as lambkins live. WRITTEN IN JANUARY, 1833. The old year is gone—so uncivil was I, That I made not a couplet to bid him good bye, But now that the new year has fairly come in, Not to bid him a welcome, were surely a sin— So welcome I bid him, tho' not to myself, Yet to all who are wealthy in hope or in pelf, All hearty good fellows to whom life is dear, I heartily wish you a happy new year. To the man, who is fit to be married, a wife, And a grave unto him that is tired of life; To my friends, that they may not have much to forgive, To my foes, that they just may forget that I live; To my love—that her charms may to her be a blessing, Tho' to me I confess, they are rather distressing— For the man of her choice may good fortune await him, And then—why, I'll try very hard not to hate him. THE BIRTH-DAY. TO JAMES BRANKER, ESQ. Even as the wise astronomer invents Zones, colures, cycles, in the trackless sky— Or as the mariner, whose daring art Maps out the undistinguishable main With curious lines, that, to the mind untaught, Seem all mysterious as a wizard's scheme, Or the fine traces in a lady's palm, Interpreted by Egypt's wandering brood,— So man delights in the wide waste of time, The tide of moments ebbing as they flow, To set his land-marks; and recording names, Pavilions of the pausing memory, Historic pillars, quaintly sculptured o'er With hieroglyphics of the heart. Not least, In the memorial list of holy times, Is that permitted epoch of pure mirth, A good man's birthday, when the very poor Pour forth the savings of the stinted meal To make one hour rejoice in wealth of joy:— Then, long of yore, when duty seem'd to frown, And love parental wore a brow severe, And children trembled in their father's eyes, The sternest sires were not afraid to smile, And doff'd their honest, sage hypocrisy, Because the birth-day came but once a year. And those whom fortune, choice, or chance have cast On the wild billows of the changeful world, Tho' haply wandering amid Afric sands, Or wedged in thundering straits of “thick-ribb'd ice,” Or lost in the dark city's wilderness, Will find their hearts at home, when annual comes The merry birth-day,—and recall the hours, The vernal hours, when life itself was bliss, And every birth-day a new argument Of hope and pride. Alas! too oft the day Remains a hollow cenotaph of Hope, When Hope is dead and gone. The worst— The worst of hearts, that hath not ceased to feel, Grows soft and childish, when the number'd hour Records the moment of a mother's pain— When the faint mother lifted first her eyes To Heaven in thankfulness—then cast them down Upon her babe in love.—Oh, gracious Heaven! Thy mighty law—in spite of rebel will, Spite of all theories of doubting man— Still rules triumphant through the tribes of life, Confutes the quirks of calculating pride, And, o'er the feeblest of all feeble things, Sheds the strong potency of love divine: For God is stirring in the mother's heart— The living God is in her milky breast— And God's own image, fresh from paradise, Hallows the helpless form of infancy. Oh that the God, the same all bounteous Lord That aids the mother in her agony, Would save her from the feller pangs, that oft From love, the sweetest and the holiest love, Extract all sweetness and all self-esteem, Making the image of the child beloved Like a foul phantom, that pollutes the soul,— A spell, a bondage, a continued fear, A slow consuming fever of the heart, In sorrow's gloomy creed, almost a sin. Fain would the shame-struck parent tear away The once glad epoch from the calendar, The birth-day of the graceless prodigal, Whose name, forbidden, leaves a blank deform'd In household records, and familiar feasts, Breeding sharp envy of that parent's lot Whose tear was dropp'd upon an infant's grave. Or if the birth-day bring no thought of shame, It rarely comes without a drop of woe, That checks the gay laugh with a sudden sigh. But these are gracious griefs.—For all 'tis good, Whose taste of goodness is not lost—though sore May be the thought—to measure back their course Oft as the birthday comes. Wild voyagers, Launch'd on the perilous sea of human life, Awhile we paddle by the sunny shores, The native shores of homely infancy. Young courage, buoyant on the venturous surge, Taunting the prescience of maternal fear, Swims light and joyous with the out-bound tide, That evermore, at stated hour, comes home, And brings a freight of crimson shells, and weeds, That mock the things of earth with semblance quaint, Imperial cradles of purpureal sheen, And wreathed trumpets, curiously convolved, Wherein the ocean's mighty harmonies Serenely murmur in a humming slumber. So childhood passes—but the whistling breeze Of Time calls shrill, and forth the vessel flies:— The mother, wailing on the wave-kiss'd shore, Trusts her last counsels to the impatient breeze That will not hear them—strains her dewy eyes Till the proud sails diminish to a speck— That speck to nothing,—questions still the grey Unfixt horizon, till the setting sun Sinks sudden in the darkness of the waves; Then homeward hastening, looks upon the stars, And knows that he beholds them, who no more Shall look with her upon their household flowers. Where will he go? To lands of pearl and gold In search of gain? or to the fields of Fame, Where the coarse herb, with honourable blood Manured and water'd—marl'd with bleaching bones— Flags rank and noisome o'er promiscuous graves? Will he, with petty traffic, slow and sure, From point to point, along the low flat coast, Wakeful and cautious cruise? or launching forth On the vast main, spread every glittering sail To catch the winds of chance, and bear away For frozen continents, or empires dark With howling woods, or girt with burning sand? Or will he loiter by the enchanted isles Of Love, where oft the languid air becalms The willing bark? or doth he seek in vain For that lost land, in elder time submerged Beneath the Atlantic wave? But hold—no more.— Too long we dally with a quaint conceit, While the swift birth-day wears to jocund night. Thrice happy they, who rest, ere day declines, Beneath the trees they planted in the morn:— And thou, my friend, whom honourable toil Hath timely raised to honourable wealth, And power to diffuse that happiness Which thou hast earned—may worthily rejoice, Oft as thy annual natal feast arrives, to see Thy sire, and hers, whom love to thee hath join'd In holy bands, beside thy cheerful board, Placidly smiling in their calm old age, And blessing Heaven that they can bless the day When thou wast born. TO A POSTHUMOUS INFANT. Child of woman, and of Heaven, Ere thy birth, of sire bereaven, Offspring of a widow'd dove, Of half thy heritage of love Defeated, ere thy little breath Was drawn from atmosphere of death— Smiler, that shalt ne'er beguile Father's tear with baby smile, Never laugh on father's knee, Knows thy father aught of thee? May the spirit of the Blest Look upon its earthly nest? Breathe upon thine infant slumbers The music of angelic numbers, Glide into the growing soul, To form, “to kindle, or controul?” May the sainted parent bless His own, the new-born fatherless? HOMER. Far from all measured space, yet clear and plain As sun at noon, “a mighty orb of song” Illumes extremest Heaven. Beyond the throng Of lesser stars, that rise, and wax, and wane, The transient rulers of the fickle main, One steadfast light gleams through the dark, and long, And narrowing aisle of memory. How strong, How fortified with all the numerous train Of human truths, Great Poet of thy kind, Wert thou, whose verse, capacious as the sea, And various as the voices of the wind, Swell'd with the gladness of the battle's glee— And yet could glorify infirmity, When Priam wept, or shame-struck Helen pined. VALENTINE. TO A FAIR ARTISTE. Written in 1813. These, if not the first verses that I ever wrote, are the first with which I succeeded in pleasing even myself:—in fact, the first in which I was able to express a preconceived thought in metre. I have selected them from a mass of juvenile, or more properly, puerile poetry, not as any better, or much worse, than the rest, but from the pleasant associations connected with them. It will do nobody any harm, and to some may be an agreeable remembrancer of old times. The young lady to whom it was addressed is the eldest daughter of the late William Green, an artist of great merit, who possessed a true sense of the beautiful in nature. The lady is now a wife and mother, and probably regards the pictorial skill of her youth, and the compliments it may have gained her, as things that have been. O, mistress of that lovely art Which can to shadows form impart— Can fix those evanescent tints, Fainter by far than lovers' hints, And bring the scenes we love to mind, When we have left them far behind,— Thou seest an image in thy glass Which does e'en Raphael's art surpass, But which Dan Cupid has been able To copy in my heart's soft table. How proud 'twould make a connoisseur To have so beauteous a picture! For me, I own, it ill contents me; To have a copy but torments me, Unless I might possess, as well, That copy's fair original. THE FORSAKEN TO THE FAITHLESS. I do not write to bid thee come unto me— I will not pray thee spare my virgin fame: Since I am won, 'tis useless now to woo me— Undone I am, thou canst not more undo me. Boast thy poor triumph o'er an empty name, When she that shamed it sleeps in silent death; For what is reputation but a bubble, Blown up by Vanity's unthinking breath,— A thing which few, with all their toil and trouble, Can carry with them to their home, the grave. Since men are fire, and we are as the stubble, Men's faults are wink'd at—ours, alas! seen double. No pardon of the partial world I crave, That still is Folly's mouth-piece, Custom's slave. Not for my name I mourn—but thou hast ta'en A dearer jewel—even my precious soul. Nor thou, nor all the world, can give again What I have thrown away! Tho' Time may roll His centuries on, when I shall be forgotten, Thy falsehood mute, and cold thy fickle lust,— When this polluted body shall be rotten, And, undistinguish'd, sleep with virgin dust,— Tho' all may cease, the stars give o'er to shine, Nor more be witness to that sin of mine,— Still should I feel my unredeemed loss, And 'mongst the blessed be a thing unblest; No power that is can make me what I was— Oh, might I then not be! Oh, vain request! TO THE MEMORY OF CANNING. Early, but not untimely, Heaven recall'd To perfect bliss, thy pure, enlighten'd mind; And tho' the new-born freedom of mankind Is sick of fear to be again enthrall'd, Since thou art gone; and this fair island, wall'd With the impregnable, unmaster'd sea, Mourns with a widow's grief for loss of thee,— Should we repine, as if thou wert install'd In Heaven too soon? Nay, I will shed no tear. Thy work is done. It was enough for thee To own the glorious might of Liberty, And cast away the bondage and the fear Of rotten custom; so the hope, which Fate Snatch'd from thy life, thy Fame shall consummate. LIBERTY. Say, What is Freedom? What the right of souls Which all who know are bound to keep, or die, And who knows not, is dead? In vain ye pry In musty archives, or retentive scrolls, Charters and statutes, constitutions, rolls, And remnants of the old world's history:— These show what has been, not what ought to be, Or teach at best how wiser Time controuls Man's futile purposes. As vain the search Of restless factions, who, in lawless will, Fix the foundations of a creedless church— A lawless rule—an anarchy of ill: But what is Freedom? Rightly understood, A universal license to be good. WHO IS THE POET? Who is the Poet? Who the man whose lines Live in the souls of men like household words? Whose thought, spontaneous as the song of birds, With eldest truth coeval, still combines With each day's product, and like morning shines, Exempt from age? 'Tis he, and only he, Who knows that Truth is free, and only free; That Virtue, acting in the strict confines Of positive law, instructs the infant spirit In its best strength, and proves its mere demerit Rooted in earth, yet tending to the sky: With patient hope surveys the narrow bound, Culls every flower that loves the lowly ground, And fraught with sweetness, wings her way on high. THE USE OF A POET. A thousand thoughts were stirring in my mind, That strove in vain to fashion utterance meet, And each the other cross'd—swift as a fleet Of April clouds, perplex'd by gusts of wind, That veer, and veer, around, before, behind. Now History pointed to the custom'd beat, Now Fancy's clue unravelling, led their feet Through mazes manifold, and quaintly twined. So were they straying—so had ever stray'd; Had not the wiser poets of the past The vivid chart of human life display'd, And taught the laws that regulate the blast, Wedding wild impulse to calm forms of beauty, And making peace 'twixt liberty and duty. YOUNG LOVE. The nimble fancy of all-beauteous Greece, Fabled young Love an everlasting boy, That held of nature an eternal lease, Of childhood, beauty, innocence, and joy; A bow he had, a pretty childish toy, That would not terrify his mother's sparrows, And 'twas his favourite play to sport his arrows, Light as the glances of a wood-nymph coy. O happy error! Musical conceit, Of old idolatry, and youthful time! Fit emanation of a happy clime, Where but to live, to breathe, to be, was sweet, And Love, tho' even then a little cheat, Dream'd not his craft would e'er be call'd a crime. DEATH-BED REFLECTIONS OF MICHELANGELO. Not that my hand could make of stubborn stone Whate'er of Gods the shaping thought conceives; Not that my skill by pictured lines hath shown All terrors that the guilty soul believes; Not that my art, by blended light and shade, Express'd the world as it was newly made; Not that my verse profoundest truth could teach, In the soft accents of the lover's speech; Not that I rear'd a temple for mankind, To meet and pray in, borne by every wind— Affords me peace—I count my gain but loss, For that vast love, that hangs upon the Cross.

      <field name="fulltext">VOL. II. POSTHUMOUS POEMS. 1850. ???? ??? ???????? ????, ??? ???????? ???????. ???? ????. SONNETS. I. TO S. T. COLERIDGE. If when thou wert a living man, my sire, I shrank unequal from the task to praise The ripening worth of thy successive days, What shall I do since that imputed fire, Extinct its earthly aliment, doth aspire, Purged from the passionate subject of all lays, From all that fancy fashions and obeys, Beyond the argument of mortal lyre? If while a militant and suffering saint, Thou walk'dst the earth in penury and pain, Thy great Idea was too high a strain For my infirmity, how shall I dare Thy perfect and immortal self to paint? Less awful task to “draw empyreal air.” II. Oh! my dear mother, art thou still awake? Or art thou sleeping on thy Maker's arm,— Waiting in slumber for the shrill alarm Ordain'd to give the world its final shake? Art thou with “interlunar night” opaque Clad like a worm while waiting for its wings; Or doth the shadow of departed things Dwell on thy soul as on a breezeless lake! Oh! would that I could see thee in thy heaven For one brief hour, and know I was forgiven For all the pain and doubt and rankling shame Which I have caused to make thee weep or sigh. Bootless the wish! for where thou art on high, Sin casts no shadow, sorrow hath no name. 1845. III. Hast thou not seen an aged rifted tower, Meet habitation for the Ghost of Time, Where fearful ravage makes decay sublime, And destitution wears the face of power? Yet is the fabric deck'd with many a flower Of fragrance wild, and many-dappled hue, Gold streak'd with iron-brown and nodding blue, Making each ruinous chink a fairy bower. E'en such a thing methinks I fain would be, Should Heaven appoint me to a lengthen'd age; So old in look, that Young and Old may see The record of my closing pilgrimage: Yet, to the last, a rugged wrinkled thing To which young sweetness may delight to cling! IV. Let me not deem that I was made in vain, Or that my Being was an accident, Which Fate, in working its sublime intent, Not wish'd to be, to hinder would not deign. Each drop uncounted in a storm of rain Hath its own mission, and is duly sent To its own leaf or blade, not idly spent 'Mid myriad dimples on the shipless main. The very shadow of an insect's wing, For which the violet cared not while it stay'd, Yet felt the lighter for its vanishing, Proved that the sun was shining by its shade: Then can a drop of the eternal spring, Shadow of living lights, in vain be made? V. Pains I have known, that cannot be again, And pleasures too that never can be more: For loss of pleasure I was never sore, But worse, far worse it is, to feel no pain. The throes and agonies of a heart explain Its very depth of want at inmost core; Prove that it does believe, and would adore, And doth with ill for ever strive and strain. I not lament for happy childish years, For loves departed, that have had their day, Or hopes that faded when my head was grey; For death hath left me last of my compeers: But for the pain I felt, the gushing tears I used to shed when I had gone astray. VI. Why should I murmur at my lot forlorn? The self-same Fate that doom'd me to be poor Endues me with a spirit to endure All, and much more than is, or has been borne By better men, of want and worldly scorn. My soul has faith—my body has the nerve To brave the penance that my sins deserve: And yet my helpless state I deeply mourn. Well could I bear to be deserted quite; Less should I blame my fortune were it worse: But taking all, it yet hath left me friends, For whom I needs must mourn the wayward spite That hides my purpose in an empty purse; Since what I grateful wish, in wishing ends. VII. When I review the course that I have run, And count the loss of all my wasted days, I find no argument for joy or praise In whatsoe'er my soul hath thought or done. I am a desert, and the kindly sun On me hath vainly spent his fertile rays. Then wherefore do I tune my idle lays, Or dream that haply I may be the one Of the vain thousands, that shall win a place Among the Poets,—that a single rhyme Of my poor wit's devising may find grace To breed high memories in the womb of time? But to confound the time the Muse I woo; Then 'tis but just that time confound me too. VIII. A lonely wanderer upon earth am I, The waif of nature—like uprooted weed Borne by the stream, or like a shaken reed, A frail dependent of the fickle sky. Far, far away, are all my natural kin: The mother that erewhile hath hush'd my cry, Almost hath grown a mere fond memory. Where is my sister's smile? my brother's boisterous din? Ah! nowhere now. A matron grave and sage, A holy mother is that sister sweet. And that bold brother is a pastor meet To guide, instruct, reprove a sinful age, Almost I fear, and yet I fain would greet; So far astray hath been my pilgrimage. IX. How many meanings may a single sigh Heave from the bosom; early, yet too late, I learn'd with sighs to audit mine estate, While yet I deem'd my hope was only shy And wishing to be woo'd. Fain to descry The little cloud I thought could never vex My vernal season, I would still perplex With sighs the counsel of my destiny. Still it moved on, and ever larger grew, And still I sigh'd and sigh'd—and then I panted; For now the cloud is huge, and close to view. It burst; the thunder roar'd, the sharp rain slanted, The tempest pass'd, and I was almost fain To sigh forlorn, and hear the sigh again. X. How shall a man fore-doom'd to lone estate, Untimely old, irreverently grey, Much like a patch of dusky snow in May, Dead sleeping in a hollow, all too late— How shall so poor a thing congratulate The blest completion of a patient wooing, Or how commend a younger man for doing What ne'er to do hath been his fault or fate? There is a fable, that I once did read, Of a bad angel, that was someway good, And therefore on the brink of Heaven he stood, Looking each way, and no way could proceed; Till at the last he purged away his sin By loving all the joy he saw within. XI. It were a state too terrible for man, Too terrible and strange, and most unmeet, To look into himself, his state to scan, And find no precedent, no chart, or plan, But think himself an embryo incomplete, Or else a remnant of a world effete, Some by-blow of the universal Pan, Great nature's waif, that must by law escheat To the liege-lord Corruption. Sad the case Of man, who knows not wherefore he was made; But he that knows the limits of his race Not runs, but flies, with prosperous winds to aid; Or if he limps, he knows his path was trod By saints of old, who knew their way to God. XII. Think upon Death, 'tis good to think of Death, But better far to think upon the Dead. Death is a spectre with a bony head, Or the mere mortal body without breath, The state foredoom'd of every son of Seth, Decomposition—dust, or dreamless sleep. But the dear Dead are they for whom we weep, For whom I credit all the Bible saith. Dead is my father, dead is my good mother, And what on earth have I to do but die? But if by grace I reach the blessed sky, I fain would see the same, and not another; The very father that I used to see, The mother that has nursed me on her knee. XIII. What is the meaning of the word “sublime,” Utter'd full oft, and never yet explain'd? It is a truth that cannot be contain'd In formal bounds of thought, in prose, or rhyme. 'Tis the Eternal struggling out of Time. It is in man a birth-mark of his kind That proves him kindred with immaculate mind, The son of him that in the stainless prime Was God's own image. Whatsoe'er creates At once abasement, and a sense of glory, Whate'er of sight, sound, feeling, fact, or story, Exalts the man, and yet the self rebates, That is the true sublime, which can confess In weakness strength, the great in littleness. XIV. HOMER. Far from the sight of earth, yet bright and plain As the clear noon-day sun, an “orb of song” Lovely and bright is seen, amid the throng Of lesser stars, that rise, and wax, and wane, The transient rulers of the fickle main, One constant light gleams through the dark and long And narrow aisle of memory. How strong, How fortified with all the numerous train Of truths wert thou, Great Poet of mankind, Who told'st in verse as mighty as the sea, And various as the voices of the wind, The strength of passion rising in the glee Of battle. Fear was glorified by thee, And Death is lovely in thy tale enshrined. XV. 'Twere surely hard to toil without an aim. Then shall the toil of an immortal mind Spending its strength for good of human kind Have no reward on earth but empty fame? Oh, say not so. 'Tis not the echoed name, Dear though it be—dear to the wafting wind, That is not all the poet leaves behind, That once has kindled an undying flame. And what is that? It is a happy feeling Begot by bird, or flower, or vernal bee. 'Tis aught that acts, unconsciously revealing To mortal man his immortality. Then think, O Poet, think how bland, how healing, The beauty thou hast taught thy fellow men to see. XVI. TO WILLIAM WORDSWORTH. Yes, mighty Poet, we have read thy lines, And felt our hearts the better for the reading. A friendly spirit, from thy soul proceeding, Unites our souls; the light from thee that shines Like the first break of morn, dissolves, combines All creatures with a living flood of beauty. For thou hast proved that purest joy is duty, And love a fondling, that the trunk entwines Of sternest fortitude. Oh, what must be Thy glory here, and what the huge reward In that blest region of thy poesy? For long as man exists, immortal Bard, Friends, husbands, wives, in sadness or in glee, Shall love each other more for loving thee. XVII. TO THE SAME. And those whose lot may never be to meet Kin souls confined in bodies sever'd far, As if thy Genius were a potent star, Ruling their life at solemn hours and sweet Of secret sympathy, do they not greet Each other kindly, when the deep full line Hath ravish'd both—high as the haunt divine And presence of celestial Paraclete? Three thousand years have pass'd since Homer spake, And many thousand hearts have bless'd his name, And yet I love them all for Homer's sake, Child, woman, man, that e'er have felt his flame; And thine, great Poet, is like power to bind In love far distant ages of mankind. XVIII. RYDAL. Nigh to the mansion of a titled dame, A charitable lady, the recluse, Begirt with trees too reverend for use, A village lies, and Rydal is its name. Its natives know not what is meant by fame; They little know how men in future time Will venerate the spot, where prose and rhyme Too strong for aught but Heaven itself to tame, Gush'd from a mighty Poet. Yet all calm, Calm as the antique trunks whose hollow age The woodman spares, sweet thoughts on every page Breathe for the soul admonitory balm. 'Tis Nature teaching what she never knew; The beautiful is good, the good is true. XIX. From infancy to retrospective eld, Year after year, we slide from day to day Like a sleek stream, from bay to sinuous bay Wearing the course it evermore hath held. The crumbling banks, that have so long compell'd The stream to wind, to haste, to strive, or stay, Drop down at last and quite choke up the way That once they foil'd. The river that rebell'd Becomes a marsh, prolific of ill weeds. Such is the life of him who streams along A lazy course, unweeting of his deeds; Till duty, hope, love, custom, prayers and creeds Crumble away, and yield to helpless wrong, That from the mere disuse of right proceeds. XX. TO ALFRED TENNYSON. Long have I known thee as thou art in song, And long enjoy'd the perfume that exhales From thy pure soul, and odour sweet entails And permanence, on thoughts that float along The stream of life, to join the passive throng Of shades and echoes that are memory's being Hearing we hear not, and we see not seeing, If passion, fancy, faith move not among The never-present moments of reflection. Long have I view'd thee in the crystal sphere Of verse, that, like the beryl, makes appear Visions of hope, begot of recollection. Knowing thee now, a real earth-treading man, Not less I love thee, and no ore I can. XXI. I know too little of thee, my dear friend, Or else too much,—for nothing less than all Were quite enough to guide me to the end And fatal purpose of thine earthly call. I know thy will is stubborn as a wall Against all acts that trespass or offend. I know there is no sin or fault so small Wherewith the current of thy soul would blend; But yet I know that there is something yet Which I know not, a burden on thy breast No joy of earth can make thy heart forget; The sleepless thought that will not be at rest, That, like a wee bird struggling in the net, Still whines and twitters of its distant nest. April, 1846. XXII. TO DR. DALTON. This world so beautiful cannot produce A thing more beauteous than a head of snow, Or smoothly bald and bright with sunny glow, That has been busied still in things of use. The adventurous restlessness of Scottish Bruce Led him to trace the backward course of Nile; But I would rather trace that serious smile, That seems habitual to a lip, not loose, Nor yet constrain'd; a brow not wrinkled much, An eye not dimm'd but disciplined by age. I could not know thee when thou wast the page Of the young Lady Science, ere the touch Unfelt of years had worn thy youth away; I cannot trace thee to thy youthful day. XXIII. TO JOANNA BAILLIE. Long ere my pulse with nascent life had beat, The ripe spring of thy early Paradise With many a flower, and fruit, and hallow'd spice, Was fair to fancy and to feeling sweet. Time, that is aye reproach'd to be so fleet, Because dear follies vanish in a trice, Shall now be clean absolved by judgment nice, Since his good speed made thee so soon complete. But less I praise the bounty of old Time, Lady revered, our Island's Tragic Queen, For all achievements of thy hope and prime, Than for the beauty of thine age serene, That yet delights to weave the moral rhyme, Nor fears what is, should dim what thou hast been. XXIV. ON READING THE MEMOIR OF MISS GRIZZLE BAILLIE. Genius, what is't? A motion of the brain. And valour is the toughness of a nerve, And the strong virtue that will never swerve Is but the “lazy temperance” of a vein. And what is pity but a twitching pain, Seeking its own relief in pious acts? Thus wisdom, seeking all things to explain, Out of all good the soul of good detracts. The simple woman that records the worth Of the brave saints to whom she owed her birth, Confutes a doctrine that she never knew. For goodness, more than ever was perceived By sense, or in the visible world achieved, By might of mere believing, she makes true. XXV While I survey the long, and deep, and wide Expanse of time, the Past with things that were Throng'd in dark multitude; the Future bare As the void sky when not a star beside The thin pale moon is seen; the race that died While yet the families of earth were rare, And human kind had but a little share Of the world's heritage, before me glide All dim and silent. Now with sterner mien Heroic shadows, names renown'd in song, Rush by. And, deck'd with garlands ever green, In light and music sweep the bards along; And many a fair, and many a well-known face, Into the future dive, and blend with empty space. XXVI. Ah me! It is the saddest thing on earth To see a change where much is yet unchanged, To mark a face, not alter'd, but estranged From its own wonted self, by its own hearth So sadly smiling, like the ghost of mirth, That cannot quite desert its long abode. The very sigh that lifts the weary load Of pain, and loosens the constraining girth Within the breast, a semi-tone of laughter; Though joy to woe, as light to shade is turn'd, The trick of joy is not so soon unlearn'd: The substance flits, the shadow lingers after. The soul once rich in joy, though poor it be, Will yet be bounteous in its poverty. XXVII. Accuse not gracious Nature of neglect, Nor doubt the wise intent of Providence, Because a human thing not quick of sense, With scarce a twinkling spark of intellect, With much of body's, more of mind's defect, Hath hobbled upon earth for eighty years; And now, unconscious of the hopes and fears That the past life of wiser men dissect, Is dozing deathward. Deep and dark immured The corn-seed in the dead-throng'd catacomb, From light shut out, was yet from blight secured And Turk and Mam'luke, in oblivious tomb: And thus, for eighty years, good man, in thee The seed has slept, sepulchred in simplicity. XXVIII. MUSIC. Sweet music steals along the yielding soul, Like the brisk wind that sows autumnal seeds; And it hath tones like vernal rain that feeds The light green vale, ordain'd ere long to roll In golden waves o'er many a wealthy rood; And tones it hath, that make a lonely hour The silent dwelling of some lovely flower, Sweet Hermitess of Forest solitude. I loved sweet Music when I was a child, For then my mother used to sing to me: I loved it better when a youth so wild, With thoughts of love it did so well agree; Fain would I love it to my latest day, If it would teach me to believe and pray. XXIX. Oh! that a tone were lasting as a thought, A feeling joy, eternal as a truth! Then were my spirits charm'd to endless youth, All time enrich'd with what a moment brought. That one sweet note, so sweet itself, and fraught With all the warbled sweetness of the stream Of rippling sound, continuous as a dream — A dream of song, that waking turns to nought. I cannot find it, I cannot resume The thrilling calm, the gladness so intense, So simple, perfect, neither soul nor sense For hope had need, for hoarding thought had room: Yet shall the moral heart for aye retain The once-seen songstress, and the once-heard strain. XXX. I would, my friend, indeed, thou hadst been here Last night, beneath the shadowy sycamore, To hear the lines, to me well known before, Embalm'd in music so translucent clear. Each word of thine came singly to the ear, Yet all was blended in a flowing stream. It had the rich repose of summer dream, The light distinct of frosty atmosphere. Still have I loved thy verse, yet never knew How sweet it was, till woman's voice invested The pencill'd outline with the living hue, And every note of feeling proved and tested. What might old Pindar be, if once again The harp and voice were trembling with his strain. XXXI. DIANA AND ENDYMION. It was a learned fancy, that bestowed A living spirit and a human will On those far lights that, whether fixt and still, Or moving visibly along the road, Were mighty to predestine, rule, forbode; Yea, to disclose, to long observant skill, Not season's course alone, but good and ill, For aye appointed in no changeful code. A freer, yet a gentler wit, devised That quaint old Fable, that beheld the moon Gazing for hours on her Endymion, Till she turned pale, by jocund morn surprised; While he, wrapped up in trance or vision dim, Sleeps in her sight that ever wakes for him. XXXII. ECLIPSE. So pure, so clear, amid the vast blue lake, Sole regent of the many-scattered isles, Making of myriad million, billion miles One beauty, floats she brilliantly awake, Unconscious of the doom that must o'ertake Her maidenhood before the night goes by, And make a lurid blot upon the sky, And all her cheer transform to dim opaque. But happy art thou, Moon; no fault of thine, No just displeasure of thy lord, the Sun, Clothes thee in weed of penance, murk and dun; For thine own self thou still art free to shine. That earth which moves between mankind and thee, Inflicts no stain upon thy purity. XXXIII. TO AN AGED BEAUTY. Once thou wert young, 'twas very long ago, Yet some there are to whom thy fixt idea, Even now, is fresh as sea-born Cytherea. The waves of time, that ever backward flow, Behind them leave the quiet tints that glow On each successive billow. Months, nor years, Nor maddest mirth, nor dim heart-wasting tears Attaint the truths that true minds truly know. Once thou wert young, and still art young to me, Though fifty summers faded since we met; Thy timid glance I cannot cease to see, Thy bird-like voice to me is piping yet. If Time turn back to say that thou art old, I'll swear he lies, and will thy youth uphold. XXXIV. I saw thee in the beauty of thy spring, And then I thought how blest the man shall be That shall persuade thy maiden modesty To hearken to his fond soliciting. Thou wert so fair, so exquisite a thing, I thought the very dust on which thy feet Had left their mark exhaled a scent more sweet Than honey-dew dropt from an angel's wing. I see thee now a matron and a mother, And I, alas! am old before my day. Both to myself and thee I owe another— A holier passion, a devouter lay. Each spark of earthly fire I now must smother, And wish for nought for which I dare not pray. XXXV. TO MISS MARTHA H—. Martha, thy maiden foot is still so light, It leaves no legible trace on virgin snows, And yet I ween that busily it goes In duty's path from happy morn to night. Thy dimpled cheek is gay, and softly bright As the fixt beauty of the mossy rose; Yet will it change its hue for other's woes, And native red contend with piteous white. Thou bear'st a name by Jesus known and loved, And Jesus gently did the maid reprove For too much haste to show her eager love. But blest is she that may be so reproved. Be Martha still in deed and good endeavour, In faith like Mary, at His feet for ever. XXXVI. SECOND NUPTIALS. There is no jealousy in realms above: The spirit purified from earthly stain, And knowing that its earthly loss was gain, Transfers its property in earthly love (Tho' love it was she does not yet reprove) To her by Heaven appointed to sustain The honour'd matron's part; to bear the pain, The joy, the duty, all things that behove A Christian wedded. She that dwells on high May be a guardian angel to the wife That her good husband chooses to supply Her place, vacated in the noon of life; With holy gladness may support the bride Through happy cares to her by death denied. XXXVII. Not in one clime we oped the infant eye To the blank light of yet unmeaning day; Nor in one language timely taught to pray, Did we lisp out the babies' liturgy. But even then, we both alike did sing Our joys and sorrows in the self-same way, Instinct the same sweet native tune did play, From laugh to smile, from sob to chasten'd sigh, Our tutor'd spirits were alike subdued. What wonder, then, if, meeting in this isle, We eke imperfect speech with sigh and smile, The catholic speech of infancy renew'd. True love is still a child, and then most true When most it talks, and does as children do. XXXVIII. Two nations are there of one common stock; One in the heart of Europe fortified, The other freshen'd by the daily tide Shaping from age to age her bulwark rock. Two faithful members of the holy flock, In the most holy bond of love allied, United the valour, worth, and selfless pride Of two great kindreds, like a braided lock— A braided lock, I've seen—so nicely braided, With softest interchange of brown and gold, Each into each so exquisitely shaded, That they were ever twain could not be told. E'en so for thee, sweet daughter of my friend, May Albion and Allmain their virtues blend. XXXIX. Right merry lass, thy overweening joy Turns an old man into a merry boy. One hour with thee pays off the long arrears, The heavy debt of almost fifty years. Oft have I view'd that lake so beautiful, And felt its quiet power, benign, to lull The inward being to a soft repose; Patient, yet not forgetful of the woes That are the heritage of mortal breath, As if one note divided life and death. But thou, sweet maid, with ready mirth dost fill The wide survey of water, wood, and hill. I feel a pulse of pleasure newly born, And scarce believe that “man was made to mourn.” XL. KESWICK. The Church is holy still, and consecrate To mute attention and meek whispering prayer, Though he,—the mighty voice, no more is there, That gave the high roof a religious weight, And the tall shaft upraised with hope elate, And hallow'd all the holy well of air. With duteous footstep to the church repair Where lies the good, the kind, the wise, the great. Old Skiddaw stands upon his base so long, And Wallow Crag is yet a bastion proud, And rough Lodore with thunder-rain is loud, And Greta murmurs yet her ancient song. Revere the vale, where Southey's corpse is laid, Nor fear to pray—where he so long has pray'd. XLI. EDWARD—CHILD AND MAN. I saw thee, Edward, when thy baby cries Sounded in mother's ears a swift alarm; I saw thee cradled on thy father's arm, When he, with many smiles and many sighs, Guess'd in the quick gleam of thy new wak'd eyes The inward stirrings, not matured to thought, Not broken to the curb of must and ought, And yet instinct with all thy destinies. I see thee now a far experienced man, Who from late boyhood to the rear of youth Hast seen in many lands new forms of truth, And haply learned with foreign eye to scan Old England's faults; yet dost thou fondly love her, And with a true friend's boldness, dost reprove her. XLII. TO MISS ISABELLA FENWICK. Fain would I put my meanings in the tongue Familiar, lady, to thy earliest years, That gives the finest edge to social jeers; The language, which by merry bard was sung In times of old, to ladies fair, among The courts devoted to sublime amours By gay trouveurs, and knightly troubadours, Accents o'er which the Scottish Mary hung Her beauteous head enamour'd. Yet I trust Thou wilt not scorn the talk of this old isle, The tongue which Milton raised to themes sublime, On which keen Pope bestowed his poignance just, Which Cowper graced with melancholy smile, And Spenser hallowed with immortal rhyme. XLIII. WRITTEN IN A SEASON OF PUBLIC DISTURBANCE. Calm is the sky: the trees are very calm. The mountains seem as they would melt away, So soft their outline mingles with the day. Surely no sound less holy than a psalm Should interrupt the stillness and the balm Of such a morn, whose grave monastic grey Clothes the meek east in garment meek to pray With sweet humility, without a qualm. And yet, even now, in this most blessed hour, Who knows but that the murderous shot is sped In the fell jar of poverty and power? The man but now that lived, may now be dead. Has Nature of her human brood no care, That on their bloody deeds she smiles so fair? XLIV. TO MRS. CHARLES FOX. Now the old trees are striving to be young, And the gay mosses of the Christmas days To the fresh primrose must forego their praise: Now every flower by vernal poets sung, And every bird the [bursting] woods among, And all the many-dappled banks and braes, Recal remembrance of immortal lays, But speak to me in a forgotten tongue. Yea, dearest lady, they do speak to me As to a banish'd man that hath forgot Almost his mother's language, and cannot, Without sore pain and stress of memory, Reply to words that yet he hears with joy, And by their strangeness make him half a boy. XLV. TO MRS.? Sweet lady, thou art come to us again: The mountains still are in their ancient seats; Still on the turfy mound the young lamb bleats, Whose coat of March is washed with April rain. But since no Philomel can here complain, Let, lady, one poor bard lament to thee The murderous death of many a noble tree, That wont to shade thee in the grassy lane. Would that religion of old time were ours, (In that one article, not all the others,) Which the first Romans held, who reared the towers, Nigh the moist cradle of the Foundling Brothers, The faith that did in awe and love instal, For many an age the Fig-Tree Ruminal. The Fig-Tree Ruminal,—Ficus ruminalis, beneath which Romulus and Remus, according to the tradition, were found by the shepherd Faustulus. XLVI. TO LOUISE CLAUDE. I would not take my leave of thee, dear child, With customary words of compliment: Nor will I task my fancy to invent A fond conceit, or sentence finely filed; Nor shall my heart with passionate speech and wild, Bewail thy parting in a drear lament. Wit is not meet for one so innocent, Nor passionate woe for one so gaily mild. I will not bid thee think of me, nor yet Would I in thy young memory perish quite. I am a waning star, and nigh to set; Thou art a morning beam of waxing light; But sure the morning star can ne'er regret That once 'twas grey-haired evening's favourite. XLVII. HOPE. Hope, I have seen thee oft by pilgrim hand Of vagrant artist vividly pourtray'd In the sweet likeness of a wishing maid, Content from day to day on ocean strand, Loving the long-drawn wrinkles of the sand Wrought by the incessant ingress of the sea, Because the waves are rolling from the land Where the dear lad is now, where'er it be. See how the maid upon the anchor leans, Gazing beyond the long horizon's bound. Rude is the picture, but a truth profound Wakes in the heart to tell you what it means; For Hope still stands beside the vast dark sea, Watching the tides of blank futurity. XLVIII. FREEDOM. Say, what is freedom? What the life of souls Which all who know are bound to keep, or die, And who knows not is dead? In vain we pry In the dark archives and tenacious scrolls Of written law, tho' Time embrace the rolls In his lank arms, and shed his yellow light On every barbarous word. Eternal Right Works its own way, and evermore controls Its own free essence. Liberty is duty, Not license. Every pulse that beats At the glad summons of imperious beauty Obeys a law. The very cloud that fleets Along the dead green surface of the hill Is ruled and scatter'd by a Godlike will. XLIX. TO H. W. In days of old, if any days be old, Beneath the shadow of the ancient hill, We roam'd together by the wandering rill; Thou a light-footed hunter, free and bold, And I a straggler from the self-same fold, Rough, ragged, wild, with haggard looks that still Dwelt on the ground, as if predestined ill Blighted the joy of youth. Twelve years are told, And now we meet again; thou, like the wind That drives the grey cloud to the infinite sea, Hast traversed all the world's variety, From Western Isles to Oriental Ind; I am the lazy pod among the heather That slumbers sound in spite of wind and weather. L. TO H. N. COLERIDGE. Kinsman—yea, more than kinsman—brother, friend,— O more than kinsman! more than friend or brother! My sister's spouse, son to my widow'd mother!— How shall I praise thee right, and not offend? For thou wert sent a sore heart-ill to mend. Twin stars were ye, thou and thy wedded love, Benign of aspect as those imps of Jove, In antique faith commission'd to portend To sad sea-wanderers peace; or like the tree By Moses cast into the bitter pool, Which made the tear-salt water fresh and cool; Or even as spring, that sets the boon earth free— Free to be good, exempt from winter's rule: Such hast thou been to our poor family. LI. FAITH. How much thy Holy Name hath been misused, Beginner of all good, all-mighty Faith! Some men thy blessed symbols have abused, Making them badge or secret shibboleth For greed accepted, or for spite refused, Or just endured in fear of pain or death. To some, by fearful conscience self-accused, Thou com'st a goblin self, a hideous wraith! With such as these thou art an inward strife, A shame, a misery, and a death in life, A self-asserting, self-disputing lie; A thing to unbelief so near allied, That it would gladly be a suicide, And only lives because it dare not die. LII. FEAR. Dim child of darkness and faint-echoing space, That still art just behind, and never here, Death's herald shadow, unimagined Fear; Thou antic, that dost multiply a face, Which hath no self, but finds in every place A body, feature, voice, and circumstance, Yet art most potent in the wide expanse Of unbelief,—may I beseech thy grace? Thou art a spirit of no certain clan, For thou wilt fight for either God or Devil. Man is thy slave, and yet thy lord is man; The human heart creates thee good or evil: As goblin, ghost, or fiend I ne'er have known thee, But as myself, my sinful self, I own thee. LIII. PRAYER. There is an awful quiet in the air, And the sad earth, with moist imploring eye, Looks wide and wakeful at the pondering sky, Like Patience slow subsiding to Despair. But see, the blue smoke as a voiceless prayer, Sole witness of a secret sacrifice, Unfolds its tardy wreaths, and multiplies Its soft chameleon breathings in the rare Capacious ether,—so it fades away, And nought is seen beneath the pendent blue, The undistinguishable waste of day. So have I dream'd!—oh, may the dream be true!— That praying souls are purged from mortal hue, And grow as pure as He to whom they pray. LIV. There was a seed which the impassive wind, Now high, now low, now piping loud, now mute, Or, like the last note of a trembling lute, The loved abortion of a thing design'd, Or half-said prayer for good of human-kind, Wafted along for ever, ever, ever. It sought to plant itself; but never, never, Could that poor seed or soil or water find. And yet it was a seed which, had it found, By river's brink or rocky mountain cleft, A kindly shelter and a genial ground, Might not have perish'd, quite of good bereft; Might have some perfume, some faint echo left, Faint as the echo of the Sabbath sound. LV. FROM MICHAEL ANGELO. The might of one fair face sublimes my love; For it hath wean'd my heart from low desires, Nor death I need, nor purgatorial fires. Thy beauty, antepart of joys above, Instructs me in the bliss that saints approve; For oh! how good, how beautiful must be The God that made so good a thing as thee, So fair an image of the heavenly Dove. Forgive me if I cannot turn away From those sweet eyes that are my earthly heaven, For they are guiding stars benignly given To tempt my footsteps to the upward way; And if I dwell too fondly in thy sight, I live and love in God's peculiar light. LVI. Still for the world he lives, and lives in bliss, For God and for himself. Ten years and three Have now elapsed since he was dead to me And all that were on earth intensely his. Not in the dim domain of Gloomy Dis, The death-god of the ever-guessing Greek, Nor in the paradise of Houris sleek I think of him whom I most sorely miss. The sage, the poet, lives for all mankind, As long as truth is true, or beauty fair. The soul that ever sought its God to find Has found Him now—no matter how, or where. Yet can I not but mourn because he died That was my father, should have been my guide. SONNETS SUGGESTED BY THE SEASONS. I. FEBRUARY 1ST, 1842. One month is past, another is begun, Since merry bells rung out the dying year, And buds of rarest green began to peer, As if impatient for a warmer sun; And though the distant hills are bleak and dun, The virgin snowdrop, like a lambent fire, Pierces the cold earth with its green-streak'd spire; And in dark woods the wandering little one May find a primrose. Thus the better mind Puts forth some flowers, escaped from Paradise, Though faith be dim as faintest wintry skies, And passion fierce as January wind. O God, vouchsafe a sunbeam clear and kind, To cheer the pining flow'ret ere it dies. II. MARCH, 1846. Now Nature in her vernal green is clad, And windy March puts on the robe of May; The primrose is abroad, the buds half-way Open their lips; all things are blithe and glad: Then wherefore should I droop in semblance sad, And contradict the promise of the air? Ah, me! I can but think of those that were, And now are not—of those dear friends I had, And have not. Alice, thou art very meek, And hast the faith that makes affliction good. It would be wholesome to my perilous mood If I could see the tear upon thy cheek. Methinks we could talk out a day—a week, Of those we loved. Oh, Alice! would we could. III. THE VERNAL SHOWER. Welcome once more, my pretty Lady Spring: So young a Spring we have not seen for years. Even thy brief morning fit of girlish tears Was bright and sweet as droppings from the wing Of kindly sylph, through ether voyaging On some good errand to the distant spheres; And every bud and blade, to which adheres The pure aspersion, seems a conscious thing, Renew'd in spirit. Light the birdie leaps, Shaking translucent gems from every spray; And merrily down the many-shadow'd steeps The streamlets whiten, all in new array. Joy to the vale if Summer do but keep The bounteous promise of this April day. Grasmere, April, 1842. IV. 1ST OF APRIL, 1845. Sweet month of Venus, meekly thus begun, Too pensive for a day of antique folly, In yellow garb of quiet melancholy Thy patient pastures sleep beside the sun; And if a primrose peep, there is but one Where wont the starry crowd to look so jolly. Alone, amid the wood, the Christmas holly Gleams on the bank with streaming rain fordone, And yet the snowdrop and the daffodils Have done their duty to the almanack. And though the garden mould is blank and black, With bloom and scent the gay mezereon fills The longing sense; and plants of other climes In the warm greenhouse tell of better times. V. MAY, 1840. A lovely morn, so still, so very still, It hardly seems a growing day of Spring, Though all the odorous buds are blossoming, And the small matin birds were glad and shrill Some hours ago; but now the woodland rill Murmurs along, the only vocal thing, Save when the wee wren flits with stealthy wing, And cons by fits and bits her evening trill. Lovers might sit on such a morn as this An hour together, looking at the sky, Nor dare to break the silence with a kiss, Long listening for the signal of a sigh; And the sweet Nun, diffused in voiceless prayer, Feel her own soul through all the brooding air. VI. MAY MORNING. In days of yore, while yet the world was young, Fair nymphs arose to grace the morn of May, And ere the East had doffed the pearly grey, Went forth to catch the jewell'd drops that hung On the fresh virgin leaves the woods among; And many a delicate foot-mark might be seen, Tinting the silvery lawn with darker green; And many a bird, untimely waked, upsprung, Scattering the maythorn's white. O lovely season, Where art thou gone? Methinks the cold neglect Of thy old rites, perchance may be the reason Thou wilt not punctual keep thy wonted time, But, angry at our slothful disrespect, Carest not to quit some duteous happier clime. VII. MAY 25TH, 1840. How strange the cold ungenial atmosphere, Beneath the cover of so bright a sky! Each way-side flower hath oped its little eye; The very coyest birds of all the year Have ventured forth to see if all be clear. Full-leaved the pendant birches droop and sigh; The oak is clothed in vernal majesty; White-chaliced lilies float upon the mere. The very warmth that made this world of beauty Is summon'd to another tract of duty, And leaves a substitute so stern and cold, We half regret old winter's honest rule, The roaring chimney and the log of yule: May hath such airs as May had not of old. VIII. TO DORA QUILLINAN. Well, this is really like the poet's May, The merry May of which we used to hear, Big with the promise of the coming year! The apple-trees their rosy bloom display, The flowerets, many-hued, that line the way, Long-soak'd with rain, and chill'd with whistling blast, Look happy now, like maidens, that at last Are to be wedded, after long delay. Oh! that the joy, the fragrance, and the bloom, That bid all life and even poor man be glad, Might waft a breath of comfort to the room Where she lies smitten, yet not wholly sad, Waiting with frame immortal to be clad, In patient expectation of her doom! IX. Oh, what a joy is in the vernal air! For Nature now is like a budding girl, Whose merry laugh displays, more white than pearl, Teeth that make lovers old as me despair. And yet, though Time has written on my hair A notice from all amorous thoughts to part, This day persuades long slumbering hopes to start, Like cuckoo notes, from winter's drowsy lair. Yet, my young love, I hope not for the thing That is the prism of my soul. Oh, no! I scorn the wish that to my love would bring Laborious days, and poverty, and woe. I only wish thou mayst beloved be By a much better man, as I love thee. X. AUTUMN FLOWERS. The flowers of Spring, they come in sweet succession, Snowdrop and crocus, and mezereon, thick Studded with blossom upon leafless stick, And the young ivy, ceaseless in progression; They triumph in their hour of brief possession. Then Summer comes, with her voluptuous rose, And sweet carnation in half-blown repose; The plant where pious maids discern the passion, The death by which we live. But I was born When the good year was like a man of fifty, When the wild crabtree show'd a naked thorn, And tall brown fern disguised the red deer's horn; Like meats upon a board, august and thrifty, Large flowers blaze out at intervals forlorn. XI. SEPTEMBER. The dark green Summer, with its massive hues, Fades into Autumn's tincture manifold. A gorgeous garniture of fire and gold The high slope of the ferny hill indues. The mists of morn in slumbering layers diffuse O'er glimmering rock, smooth lake, and spiked array Of hedge-row thorns, a unity of grey. All things appear their tangible form to lose In ghostly vastness. But anon the gloom Melts, as the Sun puts off his muddy veil; And now the birds their twittering songs resume, All Summer silent in the leafy dale. In Spring they piped of love on every tree, But now they sing the song of memory. XII. NOVEMBER. Now the last leaves are hanging on the trees, And very few the flowers that glint along The deep dark lanes and braes, erewhile as throng With peeping posies as the limes with bees; Nought in the garden but stiff sticks of peas, And climbing weeds inextricably strong; And scarce a fragment of autumnal song Whistles above the surly morning breeze. Yet still at eve we hear the merry owl, That sings not sweetly, but he does his best; The little brown bird with the scarlet vest Chirrups away, though distant storms do howl. Then let us not at dark November scowl, But wait for Christmas with a cheerful breast. XIII. WRITTEN IN A PERIOD OF GREAT MONETARY DISTRESS. Though Night and Winter are two gloomy things, Yet Night has stars, and Winter has the moss, And the wee pearly goblets that emboss The lumbering wall on which the redbreast sings. Now the old year spreads wide his dusky wings, And hovers o'er his many children dead; Few are the blessings on his hoary head, Bestow'd by hearts whom cruel memory wrings, And sad forebodings, for no stars are seen In the dull night and winter of distress. The chaliced mosses and the velvet green, That clothe November with a seemly dress, As furry spoils that cheer the red-haired Russ, Shield not the poor from blasts impiteous. Nov. 3, 1847. XIV. CHRISTMAS DAY. Was it a fancy, bred of vagrant guess, Or well-remember'd fact, that He was born When half the world was wintry and forlorn, In Nature's utmost season of distress? And did the simple earth indeed confess Its destitution and its craving need, Wearing the white and penitential weed, Meet symbol of judicial barrenness? So be it; for in truth 'tis ever so, That when the winter of the soul is bare, The seed of heaven at first begins to grow, Peeping abroad in desert of despair. Full many a floweret, good, and sweet, and fair, Is kindly wrapp'd in coverlet of snow. XV. ON A CALM DAY TOWARDS THE CLOSE OF THE YEAR. There never was an hour of purer peace! Methinks old Time, in mere mortality, Gives up the ghost, contented not to be, And all the pulses of great Nature cease. Whate'er betokens hope, life, or increase, The gladsome expectation, or the dread Of chance and change upon to-morrow fed, Await the expiration of their lease In dumb dull apathy. Not on the tree Stirs the brown leaf; or, if detached, it drop, So very slow it wavers to the ground One might suppose that central gravity, Prime law of nature, were about to stop: Ne'er died a year with spirit so profound. Dec. 1835. XVI. DECEMBER, 1838. The poor old year upon its deathbed lies; Old trees lift up their branches manifold, Spiry and stern, inveterately old; Their bare and patient poverty defies The fickle humour of inconstant skies. All chill and distant, the great monarch Sun Beholds the last days of his minion. What is 't to him how soon the old year dies? Yet some things are, but lowly things and small, That wait upon the old year to the last; Some wee birds pipe a feeble madrigal, Thrilling kind memories of the summer past; Some duteous flowers put on their best array To do meet honour to their lord's decay. XVII. NEW YEAR'S DAY. A new-year's day! Time was that I was glad When the new year was usher'd into life With midnight fiddle, morning drum and fife. I wonder'd then how any could be sad Because another year had gone to add One figure to the date of human strife. And yet I knew that sin and pain were rife, That age would fain be cold, that youth was mad;— All this I knew, yet, knowing, ne'er believed; And now I know it, and believe it too: But yet I am not of all grace bereaved; I wish the hope that hath myself deceived May, like the happy year, itself renew, And be at least to one dear maiden true. SONNETS AND OTHER POEMS ON BIRDS, INSECTS, AND FLOWERS. HUMMING BIRDS. The insect birds that suck nectareous juice From straightest tubes of curly-petaled flowers, Or catch the honey-dew that falls profuse Through the soft air, distill'd in viewless showers, Whose colours seem the very souls of gems, Or parting rays of fading diadems:— I have but seen their feathers,—that is all. As much as we can know of poets dead Or living; but the gilded plumes that fall Float on the earth, or in the wind dispread Go everywhere to beautify the breeze. Sweet wind, surcharged with treasures such as these, I may not feel:—I never may behold The spark of life, that trimmed in garb so bright That flying quintessence of ruby, gold, Mild emerald, and lucid chrysolite. Yet am I glad that life and joy were there, That the small creature was as blithe as fair. THE CRICKET. The Naturalist of the Supplement to the British Almanack tells me that Crickets rusticate in Summer, and return to their firesides in Winter. I would I knew this for a fact. Where art thou, merry whistler of the hearth? What time the grate is stuffed with arid moss, I miss thy shrill monotony of mirth, And do not love the bar's ferruginous gloss, When summer nights are blinking-dark and cold, And the dim taper cheerless to behold. I thought thee sleeping in some cranny snug, Insensible to human weal or woe, Till earlier night bids shake the lazy rug, And lifts the poker for decisive blow. But thou hast left thy ashy winter mansion To air thy crisp cased wings in wide expansion. If I should see thee in thy summer dress, 'Tis odds if I should know thee, winter friend! The love I have not, but revere no less, That can so closely to thy ways attend. And glad am I the cricket has a share Of the wide summer, and the ample air. LINES WRITTEN OPPOSITE A DRAWING OF A PARROT AND BUTTERFLY. Bright creatures are ye, bird and butterfly, The joyous progeny of the breeding sun, Who worked below, his “'prentice hand to try,” On topaz, ruby, and carnelian. Then, breathing upwards, first essayed the rose, Sweet emanation of the soul of earth; Then would the gilded fly its wings disclose, Proud of the beauty of its gorgeous birth. But brightest gems would murmur, if they might, Because for woman, not themselves, they glow. Blest are the insects, brood of warmth and light, Who feel their life, how brief they cannot know; But happier far the bird that can repeat Sweet words, by sweeter lips made doubly sweet. [Who would have thought, upon this icy cliff] “When Messrs. Hawes and Fellowes ascended Mont Blanc in July, 1827, they observed a butterfly near the summit. Mr. C. Shewell saw two crimson moths at nearly the same elevation.” Who would have thought, upon this icy cliff, Where never ibex bounded, Nor foot of chamois sounded, Where scarce the soaring hippogriff Would venture, unless truly, To this exalted Thule, He carried the thought of a metaphysician, Or theory of an electrician;— Who would have dream'd of seeing thee, Softest of summer's progeny? What art thou seeking? What hast thou lost? That before the throne of eternal frost Thou comest to spread the crimson wing, Thou pretty fluttering thing? Art thou too fine for the world below? Or hast thou lived out thy joy and thy spring? And hast thou sworn To live forlorn An anchorite in a cave of snow, Or Palmer lonely wandering? Or dost thou fancy, as many have done, That, because the hill-top is nearest the sun, The sun loves better the unthawed ice, That does nothing but say that he is bright, And dissect, like a prism, his braided light— Than the gardens of bloom and the fields of spice? Didst thou think that the bright orb his mystery shrouds In a comfortless mantle of sleet-driving clouds? Alas! he never loved this place; It bears no token of his grace; But many a mark of the tempest's lash, And many a brand of the sulphurous flash. 'Tis better to dwell among corn-fields and flowers, Or even the weeds of this world of ours, Than to leave the green vale and the sunny slope, To seek the cold cliff with a desperate hope. Flutter he, flutter he, high as he will, A butterfly is but a butterfly still. And 'tis better for us to remain where we are, In the lowly valley of duty and care, Than lonely to stray to the heights above, Where there 's nothing to do, and nothing to love. THE NIGHTINGALE. A mighty bard there was, in joy of youth, That wont to rove the vernal groves among, When the green oak puts forth its scallop'd tooth, And daisies thick the darkening fallows throng; He listen'd oft, whene'er he sought to soothe A fancied sorrow with a fancied song, For Philomela's ancient tale of ruth, And never heard it, all the long night long; But heard, instead, so glad a strain of sound, So many changes of continuous glee, From lowest twitter, such a quick rebound, To billowy height of troubled ecstasy— Rejoice! he said, for joyfully had he found That mighty poets may mistaken be. See Coleridge's Poems, Vol. i., p. 211. Sunday, Sept. 27th, 1840. THE CUCKOO. Thou indefatigable cuckoo! still Thy iteration says the self-same thing, And thou art still an utterance of the spring As constant as a self-determined will. The quiet patience of a murmuring rill Had no beginning and will have no ending; But thou art aye beginning, never blending With thrush on perch, or lark upon the wing. Methinks thou art a type of some recluse Whose notes of adoration never vary: Who of the gift of speech will make no use But ever to repeat her Ave Mary.— Two syllables alone to thee were given, What mean they in the dialect of heaven? May 22nd, 1848. THE ANEMONE. Who would have thought a thing so slight, So frail a birth of warmth and light, A thing as weak as fear or shame, Bearing thy weakness in thy name,— Who would have thought of finding thee, Thou delicate Anemone, Whose faintly tinted petals may By any wind be torn away, Whose many anthers with their dust, And the dark purple dome their centre, When winter strikes, soon as it likes, Will quit their present rest, and must Hurry away on wild adventure? What power has given thee to outlast The pelting rain, the driving blast; To sit upon thy slender stem, A solitary diadem, Adorning latest autumn with A relic sweet of vernal pith? Oh Heaven! if, as faithful I believe, Thou wilt the prayer of faithful love receive, Let it be so with me! I was a child— Of large belief, though froward, wild. Gladly I listened to the holy word, And deem'd my little prayers to God were heard. All things I loved, however strange or odd, As deeming all things were beloved by God. In youth and manhood's careful sultry hours, The garden of my youth bore many flowers That now are faded; but my early faith, Though thinner far than vapour, spectre, wraith, Lighter than aught the rude wind blows away, Has yet outlived the rude tempestuous day, And may remain, a witness of the spring, A sweet, a holy, and a lovely thing; The promise of another spring to me, My lovely, lone, and lost Anemone! EUPHRASIA OFFICINALIS, OR EYE-BRIGHT. There is a flower, a tiny flower, Its hue is white, but close within 't There is a spot of golden tint, Therein abides a wondrous juice, That hath, for such as know its use, A sweet and holy power. It is the little Euphrasy, Which you no doubt have often seen Mid the tall grass of meadow green; But never deem'd so wee a wight Endow'd with medicinal might To clear the darken'd eye. And maybe now it hath no more The virtue which the kindly fays Bestow'd in fancy's holy days; Yet still the gold-eyed weedie springs, To show how pretty little things Were hallow'd long of yore. THE COWSLIP. Lady, beyond the wide Atlantic main Huge trees hast thou beheld, and gorgeous flowers, And poor may be to thee, and dim, and plain The simple posies of this isle of ours; Yet, lady, humbly I present to thee A flower refined in her simplicity. The lady cowslip, that, amid the grass, Is tall and comely as a virgin queen. The primrose is a bonny peasant lass, The bold and full-blown beauty of the green; She seems on mossy bank, in forest glade, Most meet to be the cowslip's waiting maid. But the coy cowslip—coy, though doom'd to stand In state erect upon the open field— Declines her head, the lady of the land That must be public, fain would be conceal'd, Knowing how much she ought to all impart, Yet much retaining with an artless art; For there is beauty in the cowslip bell That must be sought for ere it can be spied, And her pure perfume must be known full well Before its goodness can be testified; And therefore do I give the flower to thee, Thinking thee better than I know or see. THE COWSLIP AND THE LARK. My pretty lady cowslip! prim and shy, Dress'd in the vernal garb of Roman bride, I wish thee sometimes in a long road-side My solitary dream to purify. And thou, bold lark! thou shivering voice on high! Invisible warbler of the blue expanse! Why wilt thou not, my merry bird, advance, And glad Winander with thy minstrelsy? The fancy sweet of Persia feign'd the love Of the voluptuous rose and nightingale. And Kent flows on,—the merry lark above And the meek cowslip bending in the vale;— What if there be mysterious love between The brave bird of the sky and floweret of the green. ON A BUNCH OF COWSLIPS, GROWN NEAR THE WRAY, AND PRESENTED TO THE AUTHOR BY A LADY. Sweet stranger lady, of a southern land, And hast thou ventured so far north away? Has the soft magic of a lady's hand Evoked thy slimness from the cold north clay? Thy sister Primrose is a damsel bold That will be found, mayhap before we seek; Thou art a lady, coy, yet not so cold, Tall and erect, though modest, yet not weak. Thou art not lively in thy bashful mood, But rather, like a sweet devoted Nun, Fearing the guile of selfish solitude, Content of many sisters to be one. I cannot look upon thee, delicate plant, Nor taste the gentleness of thy perfume, And not conceive the living world too scant To give thy beauties and thy meanings room. What time the Fairies made their orbs of green, And gave to every herb mysterious power, Thou wert the chosen crest of Elfin Queen, Her banner tall in battle's perilous hour. When eve of May, and all its wizard spells, Was aye succeeded by the glad May morn, The pendant Cowslip, with its silent bells, Adorn'd the pole by village maidens borne. When London yet was but a scatter'd town, Dotting gay fields and garden with her towers, And gravest cits, with a relaxing frown, Let out their tripping girls to gather flowers. Ah! surely it had been a lovely sight To see them trooping, ere the sun was high, Back to their frugal homes with garlands dight Of Cowslips pale, in sweetness doom'd to die. The ruddier daughters of the hamlet oft With balls of Cowslips pelted one another, Or heap'd the hay, so flowery, sweet, and soft, With fragrant load some panting nymph to smother. Maybe, these frolics of the antique age Were all too rude, meek lady-flower, for thee: Methinks thy fittest doom, on holy page Of book devout, to fade in sanctity; Where pious woman oft is wont to read, And seeing thy pale relics, stops to pray, That, like the virgin daughter of the mead, She may be sweet, and hallow'd in decay. July 13, 1844. THE CELANDINE AND THE DAISY. I love the flowers that Nature gives away With such a careless bounty: some would deem She thought them baubles, things of no esteem, Mere idle followers of unthrifty May. See in the lane, where geese and donkeys stray, The golden flower, the countless Celandine: Though long o'erlook'd, it needs no praise of mine, For 'tis one mightier poet's joy and theme. See how the Daisies whiten all yon lea! A thing so dear to poet and to child, That when we see it on neglected wild, We prize old Nature's generosity. The Celandine one mighty bard may prize; The Daisy no bard can monopolise. THE SNOWDROP. Yes, punctual to the time, thou 'rt here again, As still thou art:—though frost or rain may vary, And icicles blockade the rockbirds' aery, Or sluggish snow lie heavy on the plain, Yet thou, sweet child of hoary January, Art here to harbinger the haggard train Of vernal flowers, a duteous missionary. Nor cold can blight, nor fog thy pureness stain. Beneath the dripping eaves, or on the slope Of cottage garden, whether mark'd or no, Thy meek head bends in undistinguish'd row. Blessings upon thee, gentle bud of hope! And Nature bless the spot where thou dost grow— Young life emerging from thy kindred snow! THE GENTIANELLA. Pretty stranger in our gardens, We should beg thee thousand pardons, Long forgotten, far too long, Never mention'd yet in song. Strange it is, that never ditty Ever told thee thou wert pretty: Rondo none, nor ritornella, Praises thee, my Gentianella. Very well I know thee, why Thou art not like the cloudless sky, Nor like the virgin's melting eye. Poets seek in fields and trees Quaint conceits and similes; But thine azure is thine own,— Nothing like it have I known; Seems it not of upper earth: Surely it must have its birth In the darkness far below, Where the dark-eyed sapphires grow? Lovely votary of the sun, Never wishing to be won By a vain and mortal lover, Shrinking closely into cover When thy true love hath departed, Patient, pure, and simple-hearted. Like an exile doom'd to roam, Not in foreign land at home,— I will call thy azure hue Brightest, firmest, truest blue. THE LILY OF THE VALLEY. Some flowers there are that rear their heads on high, The gorgeous products of a burning sky, That rush upon the eye with garish bloom, And make the senses drunk with high perfume. Not such art thou, sweet Lily of the Vale, So lovely, small, and delicately pale,— We might believe, if such fond faith were ours, As sees humanity in trees and flowers, That thou wert once a maiden, meek and good, That pined away beneath her native wood For very fear of her own loveliness, And died of love she never would confess. May 24th, 1846. THE DANDELION. Strange plants we bring from lands where Caffirs roam, And great the traveller in botanic fame That can inflict his queer and ugly name On product of South Afric sands or loam, Or on the flexile creeper that hath clomb Up the tall stems of Polynesian palms; And now with clusters, or with spikes, embalms The sickly air beneath the glassy dome In lordly garden. Haply time may be When botanist from fire-born Owhyhee Shall bear thee, milky mother of white down, Back to his isle, a golden gift superb;— Give name uncouth to diuretic herb, And from the Dandelion reap renown. TO THE PLANT “EVERLASTING.” And is it thus? Shall roses fade, And violets wither in the shade? Must the tall lily lose her height, And sickly pale usurp her white? And shall the luscious woodbine shed The quaint horns of each clustering head? Must the sweet lady jessamine, Pride of the cottar's porch, resign The virgin pureness of her coronal, And thou sustain no change at all? The snowdrops, with their fairy bells, Have but one chilly month of beauty; Then the rank-set daffodils Take the term of vernal duty: And then in order due succeed The cowslip, maiden of the mead, And primrose of the “river's brim,”— A village lassie, frank and free, Unlike the cowslip, tall and slim— A lady she of high degree, Like a Roman bride in her bridal trim. But these, and many more as gay, As innocent and frail as they, By Nature strewn in sweet disorder, Or nicely prank'd in bed and border, Babes of April, pets of May, Like joys of childhood pass away. Summer has a hotter grace, Of darker leaf and broader face. I never loved them much, and so I'm well content to let them go. And yet they tarry, trying ever— Vainly trying to be—what? To be young in vain endeavour,— Venerable they are not. Never mind!—we see the stems Of summer flowers, all bare and seedy, Like princes, stript of diadems, In garden plots hirsute and weedy. And when green Autumn, matron sage, A lady of a “certain age,” Majestic trails her sinuous train, And clothes the yellow fields with grain, She hath attendance meek of flowers, As bold and purple, ripe and rosy, As dowagers right red and cosy: Grave matrons in the fairy hospitals, Staid, stately, formal, bearded seneschals; The painted pageantry of fairy bowers; The darlings of a region far away, Late-flowering heaths of Southern Africa, Fuchsias from Chili, dahlias from Peru, And strange varieties of motley hue, Or gorgeous tints, that show what art can do. But Winter comes,— They perish; let them go! There still are flowers, whose ancestors were born Beneath the southern reign of Capricorn, That deck old Winter under glassy frames. I love them not, and do not know their names. I better like the lichen's crackly scale, The velvet moss, or verdant fox's tail. But thus it seems that Nature ranges In perpetuity of changes; For every age she hath a symbol, And tells it what it ought to be; Youth, like Spring-time, light and nimble, Evanescent in its glee; Middle age, like woman wedded, Should be Summer altogether;— Only mark, it is not needed There should be any rainy weather. Autumn beauties, such there are, Of forty years, or rather more, But not so delicately fair As twenty years ago they were, Yet rich and ripe as Autumn's store. And Winter—no, I will not tell How age is Winter's parallel. If like it be in anything, 'Tis nearest to successive Spring. Spring, Summer, Autumn, with their train, Pass away and come again; For every spray and every flower, When sever'd from the natal stem, May yield its fragrance for an hour In coronary diadem: But having done its best, it dies— Its sweetest odours are its parting sighs. But what art thou, that bear'st a name Synonymous with poet's fame; Thou yellow, husky, arid thing; Thou mere antipathy to Spring; Not sweet to smell, nor fair to sight, And useless as an anchorite, Who feasted on continual fasting, Art thou indeed “the Everlasting?” Yes, so indeed, 'tis ever so; 'Tis right that God should only show His goodness for a little while. Brief is the being of a smile, And pity's tears are quickly dry, And all good things are born to die; While things unholy, of small worth, Endure a weary time on earth. But think not, therefore, that the good Is but the Giver's fitful mood. He only lets us have a taste Of heavenly good, and then in haste Withdraws it, that we may be led To seek it at the fountain-head; While for the earth he leaves a feint, The idol of the permanent,— A something very like, indeed, But not the same; a worthless weed That hath the form, but not the power, The juice, or fragrance of a flower. THE FORGET-ME-NOT. There is a little and a pretty flower, That you may find in many a garden plot; Yet wild it is, and grows amid the stour Of public roads, as in close-wattled bower: Its name in English is, Forget-me-not. Sweet was the fancy of those antique ages That put a heart in every stirring leaf, Writing deep morals upon Nature's pages, Turning sweet flowers into deathless sages, To calm our joy and sanctify our grief. And gladly would I know the man or child, But no!—it surely was a pensive girl That gave so sweet a name to floweret wild, A harmless innocent, and unbeguiled, To whom a flower is precious as a pearl. Fain would I know, and yet I can but guess, How the blue floweret won a name so sweet. Did some fond mother, bending down to bless Her sailing son, with last and fond caress, Give the small plant to guard him through the fleet? Did a kind maid, that through her lover all By which a maid would fain belovèd be, Leaning against a ruin'd abbey wall, Make of the flower an am'rous coronal, That still should breathe and whisper, “Think of me?” But were I good and holy as a saint, Or hermit dweller in secluded grot, If e'er the soul in hope and love were faint, Then, like an antidote to mortal taint, I'd give the pretty flower Forget-me-not. SONNETS AND OTHER POEMS REFERRING TO THE PERIOD OF INFANCY AND CHILDHOOD. CHILDHOOD. Oh what a wilderness were this sad world If man were always man, and never child; If Nature gave no time, so sweetly wild, When every thought is deftly crisped and curled, Like fragrant hyacinth with dew impearled, And every feeling in itself confiding, Yet never single, but continuous, gliding With wavy motion as, on wings unfurled, A seraph clips Empyreal! Such man was Ere sin had made him know himself too well. No child was born ere that primeval loss. What might have been, no living soul can tell: But Heaven is kind, and therefore all possess Once in their life fair Eden's simpleness. TO AN INFANT. Wise is the way of Nature, first to make This tiny model of what is to be, A thing that we may love as soon as see, That seems as passive as a summer lake When there is not a sigh of wind to shake The aspen leaf upon the tall slim tree. Yet who can tell, sweet infant mystery, What thoughts in thee may now begin to wake? Something already dost thou know of pain, And, sinless, bear'st the penalty of sin; And yet as quickly wilt thou smile again After thy cries, as vanishes the stain Of breath from steel. So may the peace within In thy ripe season re-assert its reign. TO AN INFANT. Sure 'tis a holy and a healing thought That fills my heart and mind at sight of thee, Thou purest abstract of humanity. Sweet infant, we might deem thy smile was brought From some far distant Paradise, where nought Forbad to hope whate'er of good may be, Where thou could'st know, and feel, and trust, and see That innocence which, lost, is vainly sought In this poor world. Yet, if thou wert so good As love conceives thee, thou hadst ne'er been born; For sure the Lord of Justice never would Have doomed a loyal spirit to be shorn Of its immortal glories—never could Exile perfection to an earth forlorn. TO AN INFANT. WRITTEN ON A SNOWY DAY. Some say, sweet babe, thy mind is but a blank, As white and vacant as the level field Of unsunned snow, that passively must yield To human foot, to vapour dull and dank, To wheel indenting slow, with sullen clank, To wanton tracery of urchin wild. I deem not so of any human child, Nor can believe our nature ever sank To such a lowness. Nay, my pretty boy! In thy shrill laugh there is intelligence; And though we can but guess, or how, or whence Thy soul was wafted—from what realm of joy Or mere privation thou hast hither come,— Thought has come with thee, happy thought, though dumb. TO A DEAF AND DUMB LITTLE GIRL. Like a loose island on the wide expanse, Unconscious floating on the fickle sea, Herself her all, she lives in privacy; Her waking life as lovely as a trance, Doomed to behold the universal dance, And never hear the music which expounds The solemn step, coy slide, the merry bounds, The vague, mute language of the countenance. In vain for her I smooth my antic rhyme; She cannot hear it, all her little being Concentred in her solitary seeing— What can she know of beaut[eous] or sublime? And yet methinks she looks so calm and good, God must be with her in her solitude. THE GOD-CHILD. I stood beside thee in the holy place, And saw the holy sprinkling on thy brow, And was both bond and witness to the vow Which own'd thy need, confirm'd thy claims of grace; That sacred sign which time shall not efface Declared thee His, to whom all angels bow, Who bade the herald saints the rite allow To the sole sinless of all Adam's race. That was indeed an awful sight to see; And oft, I fear, for what my love hath done, As voucher of thy sweet communion In thy [sweet] Saviour's blessed mystery. Would I might give thee back, my little one, But half the good that I have got from thee. TWINS. But born to die, they just had felt the air, When God revoked the mandate of their doom. A brief imprisonment within the womb, Of human life was all but all their share. Two whiter souls unstained with sin or care Shall never blossom from the fertile tomb;— Twin flowers that wasted not on earth their bloom, So quickly Heaven reclaimed the spotless pair. Let man that on his own desert relies, And deems himself the creditor of God, Think how these babes have earned their paradise, How small the work of their small period: Their very cradle was the hopeful grave, God only made them for His Christ to save. BOYHOOD AND GIRLHOOD. Did our first parents in their happy seat, New from the Maker's hand, a wedded pair, In livelier hues their several sex declare Than that brave boy, and that wee lady sweet? Though not in measure nor in mind complete They come, a perfect husband and a bride; Yet is the seal impressed and testified By prophet Nature, till the season meet. The girl, a girl instinct with simple arts, And all the innocent cunning of her sex; A very girl, delighting to perplex The eye of love with antic change of parts: Burly and bold the lad, his mien denotes One-hearted manhood even in petticoats. To K. H. I. THE INFANT GRANDCHILD OF A BLIND GRANDFATHER Oh sweet new-comer to the changeful earth! If, as some darkling seers have boldly guessed, Thou hadst a being and a human birth, And wert erewhile by human parents blest, Long, long before thy present mother pressed Thee, helpless stranger, to her fostering breast; Then well it is for thee that thou canst not Remember aught of face, or thing, or spot, But all thy former life is clean forgot: For sad it were to visit earth again, And find it false, and turbulent, and vain; So little better than it was of yore, Yet nothing find that thou hast loved before; And restless man in haste to banish thence The very shadow of old reverence. But well for us that there is something yet, Which change cannot efface, nor time forget;— The patient smile of passive babyhood, The brook-like gurglings, murmuring after meaning, The waking dream, the shade as softly screening The innocent sweetness of the opening bud, Which future love and sager thought encloses, As dewy moss, that swathes the swelling roses, Till thought peers forth, and murmurs break to words, With human import in the notes of birds. And thus sweet maid! thy voice, so blithe and clear, Pours all the spring on thy good grandsire's ear, Filling his kind heart with a new delight, Which Homer may in ancient days have known, Till love and joy create an inward sight, And blindness shapes a fair world of its own. Let mutability, then, work its will, The child shall be the same sweet creature still. [Thou, Baby Innocence!—unseen of me] Thou, Baby Innocence!—unseen of me, New bursting leaflet of the eternal tree, That thou art sweet, is all I know of thee. I know thou must be innocent and fair, And dimpled soft as other babies are; But then—what impress doth thy image bear? Which most prevails, the mother or the sire? Are thine eyes like thy father's—made of fire, Keen to discern, and dauntless to inquire? Or, like thy mother's, meek as summer eve, Gracious in answer, open to receive, Types of a soul most potent to believe? Is thy chin cleft as sunny side of peach? And have thy lips their own peculiar speech, And murmurs that can chide, caress, beseech? Thy little hands are busy,—that I know; Thy tiny feet are fidging to and fro; But what 's the inner mood that stirs them so? Not knowing what thou art, I deem it meet To think thee whatsoe'er I think most sweet,— A bud of promise—yet a babe complete. [Fain would I dive to find my infant self] Fain would I dive to find my infant self In the unfathomed ocean of the past; I can but find a sun-burnt prattling elf, A forward urchin of four years at least. The prettiest speech—'tis in my mind engrained— That first awaked me from my babyhood: 'Twas a grave saw affectionately feign'd— “We 'll love you, little master,—if you 're good.” Sweet babe, thou art not yet or good or bad, Yet God is round thee, in thee, and above thee; We love, because we love thee, little lad, And pray thou may'st be good—because we love thee. ON AN INFANT'S HAND. What is an infant but a germ, Prophetic of a distant term? Whose present claim of love consists In that great power that Nature twists With the fine thread of imbecility, Motion of infinite tranquillity. Joy that is not for this or that, Nor like the restless joy of gnat, Or insect in the beam so rife, Whose day of pleasure is its life; But joy that by its quiet being Is witness of a law foreseeing All joy and sorrow that may hap To the wee sleeper in the mother's lap. Such joy, I ween, is ever creeping On every nerve of baby sleeping; But, baby waking, longest lingers In tiny hand and tiny fingers, [Like lamp beside sepulchral urn, Much teaching that it ne'er did learn, Revealing by felicity, Foretelling by simplicity, And preaching by its sudden cries, Alone with God the baby lies.] How hard it holds!—how tight the clasp! Ah, how intense the infant grasp! Electric from the ruling brains The will descends and stirs and strains That wondrous instrument, the hand, By which we learn to understand, How fair, how small, how white and pure, Its own most perfect miniature. The baby-hand that is so wee, And yet is all it is to be; Unweeting what it has to do, Yet to its destined purpose true. The fingers four, of varied length, That join or vie their little strength; The pigmy thumb, the onyx nail, The violet vein so blue and pale; The branchy lines where Gipsy eld Had all the course of life beheld: All, to its little finger's tip, Of Nature's choicest workmanship. Their task, their fate, we hardly guess,— But, oh, may it be happiness! Not always leisure, always play, But worky-day and holy-day; With holy Sabbath interspersed, And not the busiest day the worst. Not doomed, with needle or with pen, To drudge for o'er-exacting men, Nor any way to toil for lucre At frown of he or she rebuker; But still affectionate and free Their never weary housewifery. Blest lot be thine, my nestling dove, Never to work except in love; And God protect thy little hand From task imposed by unbeloved command! TO JEANNETTE, SIX WEEKS OLD. Our birth and death alike are mysteries, And thou, sweet babe, art a mysterious thing, In mute simplicity of passive being, A co-essential symbol of the life Which God hath made a witness of himself; The all of God which heathen wisdom knew, And heathen ignorance so far mistook, Seeking the substance in the duskiest shade; Dusky and distant as the pillar'd cloud That never nearer, never farther, taught The chosen seed their journey o'er the wild, But in the promised land was seen no more. Dim is the brightest shadow of the Lord That earth reflects: an infant's life might seem A scarce distinguishable effluence— An air-blown globule of the living ocean. And yet, methinks, sweet babe! if I should kneel And worship thee for thy meek innocence, I less should err than Egypt's white-swathed priest, Who bade the prostrate toiling race adore The one great life incarnate in the bull, Ibis, or cat, monkey or crocodile,— More wisely sin than did the Persian sage, Who held that God enshrined His Majesty In the huge mass of the insensate sun, That loves not when it warms. Yes, boby dear! In thee do we behold a symbol meet For joyous love and reverential musing; Symbol of all that God through Nature gives To sight, and touch, imparted and revealed. But more thou art for hope and holier love— For self-assuring faith, thou art far more Than any sweet and fair similitude Which sense most exquisite could match with thee; For hopeful love, that loving thy wee self, Loves yet in thee a future nobler being, A Christian maid, maybe a Christian mother; For Faith, that in the utmost thou canst be To mortal sight, though good thou wert, and holy As that dear maiden—mother of her Lord, Sees but a seed, a type unrealised, Not what thou art or shalt be, though the prayer Of parent's heart were answered full in thee, But as all Christ's beloved shall behold Each other in the clearness of His day, When child and parent, husband, wife, the king And lowly subject, scholar and untaught, The babe that drew but once its breath on earth And the grey chronicle of ninety years, Shall meet together in one family, Coëval children of the one great Sire. TO THE SAME, ON HER FIRST BIRTHDAY. 'Tis right the joyous epoch of thy birth Should be a sunshine holyday on earth; All Nature keeps it: now the boisterous North Holds his chill breath; the birds are peeping forth, Sweet little things, but yet not half so sweet As thou, sweet flow'ret of a year complete! I would, my babe, that prayer of force divine, Or dedicated task, or vow of mine To be performed, or suffered, as of old Sad saints endured, or errant champion bold Achieved on Syrian plains or Alpine passes cold— That any work more meet for solemn time, More grave and arduous than the easy rhyme Which now, my love, 'tis well enough I can Make faster far than many a wiser man— Could gain for thee the moment of a bliss, Were it no longer than a raptured kiss, Or spare thy little life the pelting pain That soon is past, but comes too soon again. But vain the vow—the very wish is vain. The caverned saint's long life of martyrdom, The knees that leave their dints on convent stone, The breath that is but one perpetual groan, Are useless all one pause of peace to win: No pain of man can expiate a sin. But wherefore dream of what I fain would do, Or prate of pain beneath a sky so blue? 'Tis Spring with Nature—tender Spring with thee, But the sere Autumn follows hard on me. It may be, pretty babe, ere thou canst know The man that loves thee, and be-rhymes thee so, I may be gone, and never see thee more; But yet I see thee on the farther shore, Clad in thine infant robes of innocence, Pure even as now, baptised from all offence, A spirit mature—yet with no more to fear Than the sweet infant of a single year TO MARGARET, ON HER FIRST BIRTHDAY. One year is past, with change and sorrow fraught, Since first the little Margaret drew her breath, And yet the fatal names of Sin and Death, Her sad inheritance, she knoweth not. That lore, by earth inevitably taught, In the still world of spirits is untold; 'Tis not of Death or Sin that angels hold Sweet converse with the slumb'ring infant's thought. Merely she is with God, and God with her And her meek ignorance. Guiltless of demur, For her is faith a hope; her innocence Is holiness: the bright-eyed crowing glee That makes her leap her grandsire's face to see, Is love unfeigned and willing reverence. March 3rd, 1843. N.B.—It was the opinion of certain ancient divines that when babies smile in sleep their guardian angels are whispering to them. THE FOURTH BIRTHDAY. Four years, long years, and full of strange event To thee, sweet boy, though brief and bare to me, Of thy young days make up the complement, And far out-date thy little memory. How many tears have dropp'd since thou wert born, Some on the cradle, some upon the grave! Yet having thee, thy father, not forlorn, Felt he had something yet of God to crave. For who hath aught to love, and loves aright, Will never in the darkest strait despair; For out of love exhales a living light, A light that speaks—a light whose breath is prayer. Sorrow hath been within thy dwelling, child, Yet sorrow hath not touch'd thy delicate bloom; So, the low floweret in Arabian wild Grows in the sand, nor fades in the simoom. What thou hast lost thou know'st not, canst not know, Too young to wonder when thy elders moan; Thou haply think'st that adult eyes can flow With tears as quick and transient as thine own. The swift adoption of an infant's love Gives to thy heart all infant hearts require; Unfelt by thee, the mortal shaft that clove In twain thy duty, left thy love entire. Ne'er be thy birthday as a day unblest, Which thou or thine might wish had never been; But in thine age, a quiet day of rest, A sabbath, holy, thoughtful, and serene. THE INFANT'S SOUL. Sweet baby, little as thou art, Thou art a human whole; Thou hast a little human heart, Thou hast a deathless soul. Yet, being all that man can be, There 's something yet behind; Sweet angels in their ministry Must yet build up the mind. Soul! never say the soul is not In thing that does not think; No thought hast thou, sweet thing, I wot, When thy thin eyelids wink. The soul is life, the life that lives, And shall exist for aye; And buzzes 'mid the million hives That swarm out every day. In every man, in every babe, Beneath the spacious cope, Where eastern wight with astrolabe Might take the horoscope. TO DEAR LITTLE KATY HILL. Oft have I conn'd, in merry mood or grave, For many a babe a sad or merry stave, In merry love of softly smiling baby, Or love subdued by fear of what it may be. But then all babies are so much alike, 'Twere easier far to single out a spike, The fairest spike in all a field of barley; Or mid the drops of dew that late or early Shine to the rising or the setting sun, To mark and memorise a single one; In a long bank to find the violet That is, or should be, Flora's own dear pet; To stamp a signet on the sweetest note That spins itself in Philomela's throat; The very whitest spot of all to show In a flat ocean of untainted snow; The blackest spot of utter dark to tell, Or do aught else which is impossible, Than to explain to each expectant mother How her sweet thing is sweeter than another. So ancient fathers deemed, and wisely deemed, Or, if not so, yet beautifully dreamed, At the last day, the day of wrath and love, The cherished nestlings of the mystic dove Shall spring from earth and meet the promised skies All in one shape, one feature, and one size, Welcome alike before the Almighty throne, Each in the Saviour's likeness, not its own, Alike all blessed, and alike all fair, And only God remember who they were. Yet love on earth will always make or find (They saw but ill who said that Love was blind) In things most like a lovely difference, Distinguish innocence from innocence. And lynx-eyed Love, my little Catherine, Perceives a self in that smooth brow of thine: Thy small sweet mouth, with speechless meaning rife, Moves hopes and smiles with something more than life: The lucid whiteness of the flower-soft skin, Transparent, shows a wakening soul within, That ever and anon peeps through those eyes, Soft as the tenderest light of vernal skies, Blue as the shadow of the halcyon's breast, On the calm waves herself has lulled to rest; Informed with light, by turns revealed and hid By gentle movement of the dewy lid: E'en in the quivering of thy little hands A spirit lives and almost understands. Oh, may each omen of thy form and hue, The lamb's pure white, the clear and hopeful blue, The gracious blending of unbroken lines, Which thy round shape continuously combines, Portend the blended graces of a soul Whose various virtues form a virtuous whole! TO CHRISTABEL ROSE COLERIDGE. Nature and Fortune, and the doom severe Of my own faults, forbid me to desire The bliss of fathers seated by the fire; Happy to know their darlings all are near, Happy the crowing note of babe to hear, Happy with lads that, restless to inquire, Ask curious questions that might tease and tire Aught less affectionate than parent's ear. Yet though the name of uncle, in the mind Of childhood, be with horrid deeds combined Of bloody Richard, and that covetous man That left the poor babes in the wildering wood, I would be Uncle Toby if I could, Or Oliver returned from Hindostan. Sweet Christabel, that hath a lovely name That would the sweetest thing commemorate That ever poet dreamed, be not thy fate Like hers, to tremble with a faultless shame! Oh, may no act of thine provoke the blame Which, least deserved, is ever keenest felt! Thine innocent flesh, that softest touch can melt, May never worldly thought or speech defame! But in the world thou must be incomplete, For who of Christabel can close the story?— The name, sweet child, it is an omen meet Of all that earth bestows of good and glory. May'st thou for aye in love and fancy dwell Like thy good grandsire's lovely Christabel! PRIMITIÆ. Sweet child! I write, because I fain would see In thy unspotted book my jagged hand, The rudest sketch and primal prophecy Of what thy wit may win or sense command. Some men would tell thee that thy soul is yet An album, open for all men to write in. I deem not so, for thou canst not forget What most thou art, and what I most delight in. Ere thou wert born “into this breathing world,” God wrote some characters upon thy heart. Oh, let them not like beads of dew impearl'd On morning blades before the noon depart! But morning drops before the noon exhale, And yet those drops appear again at even; So childish innocence on earth must fail, Yet may return to usher thee to heaven. FAITH, HOPE, AND CHARITY. The Christian virtues, one, two, three, Faith and Hope and Charity, May all find exercise in thee. In Faith, sweet infant that thou art, Of God's sublime decrees a part, Thy mother holds thee to her heart. Hope is the joy of Faith. It were Sad to behold a babe so fair Without the hope that makes a joy of care. Well 'twill be if we can learn, If loving thee, babe, we discern The love of God, and let it clearly burn. The love which sanctifies desire Is, like the bush, unhurt by fire,— For which God grants what longing souls desire. LINES, WRITTEN IN A BIBLE PRESENTED BY THE AUTHOR TO HIS GODCHILD. 'Tis little I can give thee now, And less that I shall leave; Yet this small present, as I trow, Is, in acquittance of my vow, The very best That could attest My anxious love For thee, sweet Dove, The best thou canst receive. MEDITATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE PIECES. MEMORIAL POEMS. WHY IS THERE WAR ON EARTH? WRITTEN ON A CALM AND BEAUTIFUL DAY IN MAY, 1848. Why is there war on earth? Earth is most sweet When all things are at peace, or only strive How to make up the largest sum of joy. 'Tis now sweet Spring. Methinks 'twere wise to deem Our longest life but a protracted Spring— Hope's blossom swelling in the pregnant bud Of mother Faith, that fosters by concealing, And owes its beauteous vigour Strength and beauty—First Sketch. to a root Unseen below, like dark antiquity. But there is war, because man craves the fruit Of Autumn in the aye-beginning Spring. We would have perfect freedom upon earth;— Ah, fools! to think that freedom can consist In selfish singleness of myriad wills, Worse than the old Epicurean fancy Of waving atoms hook'd into a world! But madder yet to think that million wills, Each crushing other, can compose one will, Constituent of universal truth. We would be free as nature, but forget That Nature wears an universal Or, an everlasting. law, Free only, for she cannot disobey. We would be the sons of Nature—would be free As Nature is. But can we then forget That Nature is an everlasting law, And free because she cannot disobey?—First Sketch. She hath no self to sacrifice: but man, By sinning, made out of himself a self Alien from God, that must be self-destroy'd Ere man can know what freedom is, or feel His spirit enfranchised,—general as the light Diffused through ether in its purity, And by the various sympathies of earth, Blent and dissected into various hues That all are light, as a good man's good works, All, all are love. Thank God, the times are pass'd When fear and blindly-working ignorance Could govern man. 'Tis Faith and duteous love Out of a multitude must form a state. We have escaped from Egypt; but we walk Wall'd by the waters of a blood-red sea, Parted perforce, impatient to o'erwhelm us, Soon as we not believe the awful word, That bids the tide of ruin now to flow. Yet we are spared; but shall we long be spared In sleep fool-hardy, or ingrate repining, When all around, as from the serpent's tooth By Cadmus sown, in the wild Theban fable, Spring armed hosts, all mad for liberty, And yet permitting nothing to be free, Save naked power, unclad with reverend form, Unsanctified by faith, by love unbalm'd We have escaped from Egypt; but we roam In a bare wilderness, and we lack— We lack, or heed not—the prophetic voice, Which Israel had, but would not always hear. Hence from the corse of vanquish'd tyranny, As from the serpent's teeth by Cadmus sown, Spring armed hosts [ ] eager to be slaves, Crying for liberty, but meaning nought Saving naked power, unclad with reverend form, Unsanctified by faith, by love unbalm'd.— First Sketch. LINES WRITTEN BY H. C. IN THE FLY-LEAF OF A COPY OF LUCRETIUS PRESENTED BY HIM TO MR. WORDSWORTH. In the far north, for many a month unseen, The blessed sun scarce lifts his worshipp'd head; No hardy herb records where he hath been; But pale cold snows, with dim abortive sheen, Show like the winding-sheet of Nature dead. Yet ofttimes there the boreal morning gleams, Flickering and rustling through the long, long night; So hid from truth, and its all-cheering beams, The mind, benighted, dawns with gorgeous dreams, Cold, restless, false, unprofitably bright. If such delusion held thy earthly thought, Lucretius, still thou wast a lofty mind; For, spurning all that hopes and fears had taught, Thy venturous reason, hopeless, fearless, sought In its own pride its proper bliss to find. Oh! was it fear of what might be in realms Of blank privation made thee seek the peace That the dead faith affords?—fear that dishelms The vessel of the soul, and quite o'erwhelms The spiritual life, that rather would surcease, Or be an atom, motion, air, or flame, Whose essence perishes by change of form, Than wander through the abyss without an aim, Duty, or joy—to feel itself the same, Though naked, bodiless, weak, amid the storm? LINES SUGGESTED BY A CAST FROM AN ANCIENT STATUE OF THE INFANT HERCULES STRANGLING THE SERPENTS. Behold Art's triumph! Yea, but what is Art? Is it the Iris sent from mind to heart? Or a bright exhalation, raised, refined, And organized with various hues of mind? Nay, let the mind and heart, as nature meant, Unite to work their Maker's great intent; As light and heat, diffused by the same sun, To sense are diverse, but in essence one. The poet's craft in rosy breath transpires, And the quick music of a thousand lyres, That wake to ecstasy the slumbering air, Dies into nought, or flits we know not where. The patient sculptor views, from day to day, An image that can never pass away; With resolute faith, which nothing can surprise, Beholds the type in true proportions rise: His progress slow, and every touch as slight As dawn encroaching on a summer night; His purpose sure, for consummated beauty To him is love, religion, law and duty. Long ere our God vouchsafed himself to be A baby God, a human Deity, The vast prophetic impulse of the earth Foretold, and shadow'd forth the mystic birth; Nor all the art of sacerdotal lies, Nor the world's state, could so incarnalise The strong idea, but that men, set free By pure imagination's liberty, Conceived the fancy of a boy divine. Some fables fashion'd a fierce God of wine, Abortive issue of intense desire, Begot by Thunder and brought forth by Fire. Some milder spirits cull'd two twinkling lights From the throng'd brilliance of their Grecian nights, And gave them names, and deem'd them great to save The wandering mariner on the weltering wave. Some, wiser still, believed the sun on high A deathless offspring of the empyreal sky, A personal power that could all truths reveal, Mighty to slay, and merciful to heal. Some feign'd—and they came nearest to the truth— A destined husband of eternal youth, Born of a mortal mother, and, ere born, Doom'd to the pilgrim's houseless lot forlorn, To fight and conquer, a victorious slave, Strong in subjection, by obedience brave. Such thought possess'd the nameless artist's mind When he the God, the baby God, design'd, That perfect symbol of awaken'd will, Matching its might against predestinate ill. The serpent writhing round his lower part, His infant arm defies to reach his heart. One mighty act is all the wondrous boy, Line, limb, and feature, all are strength and joy. Yet half an hour ago that infant slept, Smiled at his mother's breast, and haply wept: And when his task is done, the serpent slain, Soft in his cradle-shield may sleep again. SUMMER RAIN. Thick lay the dust, uncomfortably white, In glaring mimicry of Arab sands. The woods and mountains slept in hazy light; The meadows look'd athirst and tawny tann'd; The little rills had left their channels bare, With scarce a pool to witness what they were; And the shrunk river gleam'd 'mid oozy stones, That stared like any famish'd giant's bones. Sudden the hills grew black, and hot as stove The air beneath; it was a toil to be. There was a growling as of angry Jove, Provoked by Juno's prying jealousy— A flash—a crash—the firmament was split, And down it came in drops—the smallest fit To drown a bee in fox-glove bell conceal'd; Joy fill'd the brook, and comfort cheer'd the field. TO W. W., ON HIS SEVENTY-FIFTH BIRTHDAY. Happy the year, the month, that finds alive A worthy man in health at seventy-five. Were he a man no further known than loved, And but for unremember'd deeds approved, A gracious boon it were from God to earth To leave that good man by his humble hearth. But if the man be one whose virtuous youth, Loving all Nature, was in love with truth; And with the fervour of religious duty Sought in all shapes the very form of beauty;— Feeling the current of the tuneful strain, Joy in his heart, and light upon his brain, Knew that the gift was given, and not in vain; Whose careful manhood never spared to prune What the rash growth of youth put forth too soon; Too wise to be ashamed to grow more wise; Culling the truth from specious fallacies:— Then may the world rejoice to find alive So good, so great a man, at seventy-five. WRITTEN AT BELLE-VUE, AMBLESIDE. Still is it there, the same soft quiet scene, Which, whether sodden with importunate rain, Or sprinkled with the yellow sun, that pours Columnal brightness through the fissured clouds Of autumn eve, or, e'en as now display'd, In the full brightness of the argent moon, Is yet the same, the same beloved scene, Which neither time nor change shall wipe away From the capacious memory of the soul. Oh blessed faculty of inward sight, Safe from disease and mortal accident As love itself, secure from dull caprice Of prohibition! Blind Mæonides, That, wandering by the myriad-sounding sea, Saw not his footsteps on the passive beach, Nor saw, alas! the many beauteous eyes That gleam'd with gladness at his potent song, Had yet a world of beauty—verdant hills, Bright with the infinite motion of their leaves; Close-vested towers in olive-groves embower'd, Whence the gold-cinctured dove for ever coo'd, Wide-laughing ocean, rich with southern gleam Purpureal, jewell'd with a hundred isles, Or roused indignant from its slumberous depths To smite the long-presumptuous rampart, piled Without a prayer;—Achilles vast, reclined, Listening afar the tumults of the field;— Sweet Helen, sad amidst her loveliness, Taming her once glad motions to the halt Of Priam, leaning on her rounded arm;— Pelides, glittering like an evil star;— Or love-struck Hecuba, when first she wept O'er the new-ransom'd carcase of her best, Her fate-devoted Hector. So, if He Who in his judgments is for ever good, Should make the brightest noon a night to me, Yet will those fields, those lowly heaving hills, That roving river, that pure inland lake, And those neat dwellings that assure my heart That not alone I love and linger here, Abide the heir-looms of my inner life, As sweet, as vivid to my happier dreams, As when through tears I saw her snatch'd away. NAWORTH. When English lords and Scottish chiefs were foes, Stern on the angry confines Naworth rose; In dark woods islanded its towers look'd forth, And frown'd defiance to the growling North; With donjon-keep and long embattled wall, Portcullis, portal, and wide-echoing hall, Where erst the warrior carved in gloves of steel, And the stone pavement clang'd with iron heel. The very type was Naworth of a time Whose sins and woes by age are made sublime. There came the vagrant minstrel—not in vain, For ladies loved, and lords repaid his strain. What though his song was oft of loves unholy, And fights,—fantastic brood of restless folly? What though the plaudits, clatter'd on the stones, Bemock'd and deafen'd the poor captive's groans, Doom'd in sad durance pining to abide The long delay of hope from Solway's further side? Let us in thankfulness our God adore, Because such things have been, and are no more: Nor let a Queen, a matron pure and young, And sweet as e'er by vagrant bard was sung, Conspire with those who would, with eyeless rage, Deface the relics of ancestral age; But, as her duty, be it still her joy All to improve, and nothing to destroy. So Naworth stands, still rugged as of old, Arm'd like a knight without, austerely bold; But all within bespeaks the better day, And the bland influence of a Morpeth's sway. LINES. Oh for a man, I care not what he be, A lord or labourer, so his soul be free, Who had one spark of that celestial fire That did the Prophets of old time inspire, When Joel made the mystic trumpet cry, When Jeremiah raised his voice on high, And rapt Isaiah felt his great heart swell With all the sins and woes of Israel! Not such am I,—a petty man of rhyme, Nursed in the softness of a female time. From May of life to Autumn have I trod The earth, not quite unconscious of my God; But apter far to recognise his power In sweet perfection of a pencill'd flower, A kitten's gambols, or a birdie's nest, A baby sleeping on its mother's breast, Than in the fearful passages of life,— The battle-field, the never-ceasing strife Of policy that ever would be wise, Dissecting truth into convenient lies; The gallows, or the press-gang, or the press; The poor man's pittance, ever less and less; The dread magnificence of ancient crime, Or the mean mischief of the present time. Yet there is something in my heart that would Become a witness to eternal good. Woe to the man that wastes his wealth of mind, And leaves no legacy to human kind! I love my country well,—I love the hills, I love the valleys and the vocal rills; But most I love the men, the maids, the wives, The myriad multitude of human lives. HIDDEN MUSIC. There came a stream of music on my ear From the dark centre of an aged wood, Now muffled deep, and now ecstatic clear, Bright as a prophecy of coming good. I knew not, and I did not care to know, What voice or what mechanic instrument Utter'd the sounds, whose never-ending flow [Contain'd] my soul in such sublime content. 'Twas no small, light, and self-repeating air, The close we guess before 'tis well begun; 'Twas the united voice of everywhere, Past, present, future, all in unison. It was a strain might usher in the birth Of human life, and soothe its earliest cry, And sound the last farewell to mother earth, When souls for heaven mature are glad to fly. All elements of sound, and all the wealth Of music's universal speech was there, And ever and anon the wily stealth Of Love was murmuring in the fitful air. I HAVE WRITTEN MY NAME ON WATER. THE PROPOSED INSCRIPTION ON THE TOMB OF JOHN KEATS. And if thou hast, where could'st thou write it better Than on the feeder of all lives that live? The tide, the stream, will bear away the letter, And all that formal is and fugitive: Still shall thy Genius be a vital power, Feeding the root of many a beauteous flower. ON A PICTURE OF A VERY YOUNG NUN, NOT READING A DEVOTIONAL BOOK, AND NOT CONTEMPLATING A CRUCIFIX PLACED BESIDE HER. So young, too young, consign'd to cloistral shade, Untimely wedded,—wedded, yet a maid; And hast thou left no thought, no wish behind, No sweet employment for the wandering wind, Who would be proud to waft a sigh from thee, Sweeter than aught he steals in Araby? Thou wert immured, poor maiden, as I guess, In the blank childhood of thy simpleness; Too young to doubt, too pure to be ashamed, Thou gavest to God what God had never claim'd, And didst unweeting sign away thine all Of earthly good,—a guiltless prodigal. The large reversion of thine unborn love Was sold to purchase an estate above. Yet by thy hands, upon thy bosom prest, I think, indeed, thou art not quite at rest; That Christ that hangs upon the sculptured cross Is not the Jesus to redeem thy loss; Nor will that book, whate'er its page contain, Convince thee that the world is false and vain. E'en now there is a something at thy heart That would be off, but may not, dare not, start; Yes, yes! thy face, thine eyes, thy closed lips, prove Thou wert intended to be loved and love. Poor maiden! victim of the vilest craft At which e'er Moloch grinn'd or Belial laugh'd, May all thy aimless wishes be forgiven, And all thy sighs be register'd in Heaven, And God his mercy and his love impart To what thou should'st have been, and what thou art! BEAUTY. Oh! why is beauty still a bud unfolding, A greater beauty that can never be, Yet always is its faint fair self beholding, In all of fair and good that man may see? Nay, beauty is with thee the power of life, The germ and sweet idea of thy being; As beauty fashion'd that first maid and wife, That made primeval man rejoice in seeing. He dream'd of beauty, and he wish'd to see A form to be the substance of his dream; So want begot a child of vacancy, And that now is which did before but seem. Adam did love before he look'd on Eve; He found himself unblest in Eden's bower. A love there is that does not yet conceive Its own existence: 'tis a simple power,— A power that most does recognise its might In weakness, want, and everlasting yearning; Whose heaven is soaring, seeking, endless flight, Whose hell is thirst and everlasting burning. For what is hell, but an eternal thirst, And burning for the bounty once rejected? And what is heaven, but God on earth rehearsed, In the calm centre of the Lord perfected? Then ask not why is beauty but a bud, That never more than half itself discloses; Sweet flower, like thee is every human good, And love divine is seen in unblown roses. FAIRY LAND. Yes, I am old, and older yet must be, Drifting along the everlasting sea; And yet, through puzzling light and perilous dark, I bear with me, as in a lonely ark, A precious cargo of dear memory; For, though I never was a citizen, Enroll'd in Faith's municipality, And ne'er believed the phantom of the few To be a tangible reality, Yet I have loved sweet things, that are not now, In frosty starlight, or the cold moonbeam. I never thought they were; and therefore now No doubt obscures the memory of my dream. My Fairy Land was never upon earth, Nor in the heaven to which I hoped to go; For it was always by the glimmering hearth, When the last fagot gave its reddest glow, And voice of eld wax'd tremulous and low, And the sole taper's intermittent light, Like a slow-tolling bell, declared good night. Then could I think of Peri and of Fay, As if their deeds were things of yesterday. I felt the wee maid in her scarlet hood Real as the babes that wander'd in the wood, And could as well believe a wolf could talk As that a man beside the babes could stalk, With gloomy thoughts of murder in his brain; And then I thought how long the lovely twain Threaded the paths that wound among the trees, And how at last they sunk upon their knees, And said their little prayers, as prettily As e'er they said them at their mother's knee, And went to sleep. I deem'd them still asleep Clasp'd in each other's arms, beside a heap Of fragrant leaves;—so little then knew I Of bare-bone Famine's ghastly misery. Yet I could weep and cry, and sob amain, Because they never were to wake again; But if 'twas said, “They'll wake at the last day!” Then all the vision melted quite away; As from the steel the passing stain of breath, So quickly parts the fancy from the faith. And I thought the dear babes in the wood no more true Than Red Riding Hood,—aye, or the grim loup-garou, That the poor little maid for her granny mistook; I knew they were both only tales in a book. THE ROYAL MAID. Oh, thou sweet daughter and last lingering flower Of a great nation's loyal hope and love, Last of a line of kings whose royal dower Is virgin loveliness sublimed to power, The yearning blossom of the expectant dove On the strong eagle's spacious wings upborne; Or shall I call thee prophecy of spring, In thine own virgin pureness blossoming, Like the white May-bloom on the naked thorn; Nay, rather art thou like a flower Crowning some high crazy tower, So sweetly smiling on the rifted wall, That, for thy sake, we would not see it fall. Oh, royal maid, excuse the idle brain That, knowing thee but in thy loved ideal, Plays with thine image, and would very fain Love and revere thee too as something real; The human accents of thine innocent thought Would rather think thee flower, or happy bird, Than the dull lesson that thou hast been taught; Rather would deem thee bird, that glad and free Warbles its wood-notes wild on greenwood tree, Than tutor'd captive of a gilded cage, Unweeting echo of a prating age. Alas! a prisoner born, and bred a slave, But late awaken'd from a happy trance, Reft of the best of what thy fortune gave, Thy childish, aimless, wantless ignorance:— Ah, what a hopeless task it is for thee To govern free men that were never free. Easy it were, I doubt not, to obey, If to obey were duty's consummation; But throned servility, compell'd to sway A shackled sceptre by the year and day— ON THE DEATH OF HENRY NELSON COLERIDGE. ADDRESSED TO A FRIEND. Great joy was mine to hear a second ho pe, Another little maid, was born to thee, On whom your elder darling needs must look With some surprise, as on a legacy From some old miser uncle never seen. And when I learned that, on the self-same day That gave that pure ideal of new life, A softly-breathing infant, to the air, The vow confirmed had made among thy kindred A serious matron of a maiden gay, I did design a furious gush of song, A merry multiplicity of rhymes, Where little sense were needed, save the sense, That one delight is in a score of souls. But death had struck me; God had called away One whom the world, and I among the world, Had augured to an honest course of glory; Whose earliest youth was crowned with laureate wreath On the proud banks of Isis and of Cam; Eton's prime scholar, and the youth adroit To turn the nicest phrases of the Greeks, The very quintessence of Roman speech, To modern meanings and to modish arts, Which neither Greek nor Roman ever knew. Vain knowledge this, unprofitable skill, So may you think, and truly would you say, But that the mind thus curiously trained In the pure beauty of Hellenic art, And grandeur elegant of gorgeous Rome, Becomes to beauty feelingly awake, Nice to perceive, glad to believe and love Whate'er of beautiful abides in forms, Hues, sounds, emotions of the moral heart, Feeling a universal harmony Of all good things seen, or surpassing sense, And for the love of all that lovely is, And for a dauntless spirit unsubdued By a too general lack of sympathy Fighting for truth. My sister loved him well! She was a maid—alas! a widow now— Not easily beguiled by loving words, Nor quick to love; but, when she loved, the fate Of her affection was a stern religion, Admitting nought less holy than itself. Seven years of patience, and a late consent Won for the pair their all of hope. I saw My sweetest sister in her honeymoon, And then she was so pensive and so meek That now I know there was an angel with her That cried, Beware! But he is gone, and all The fondest passages of wedded life And mutual fondling of their progeny, And hopes together felt, and prayers when both Blended their precious incenses, and the wish That they together might behold the growth And early fruit, most holy and approved, Of their two darlings, sinks in viewless night And is no more. Thus ever in this world are joy and woe; The one before, the other hurrying after, And “cadent tears” are ever prone to flow In the quaint channels that are made by laughter. Jan. 28, 1843. AGNES. In an old house, a country dwelling, nigh A river, chafed by many a wave-worn stone, A good man kept old hospitality, With a warm purse well filled by industry And prosperous dealings in the torrid zone. His spouse was comely, stricken well in years; His daughters' faces lighted all the house, And they had tongues as well as eyes and ears. But one there was, the youngest of the dears, A child sedate, as still as any mouse. Still as a little timid mouse she sat; And yet her stillness seemed not to be fear, Like mouse's hiding from the whisker'd cat. Oh no! whate'er the subject of our chat, She seemed to drink it in with eye and ear. I cannot say she had a speaking eye, For when my eye with hers would fain converse, She would begin her needle's task to ply, Stirring her little fingers busily; And, wanting work, the kitten would she nurse. Soon as she could, she unobserved withdrew, Determined of my purpose to defeat me. And yet I loved her, as I always do All pretty maids that are too young to woo, However scurvily they choose to treat me. Years have gone by, her worthy father dead, And she could deem herself a child no longer. Who can conceive what thoughts in her were bred, When she beheld her elder sisters wed, And womanhood in her grew daily stronger? Or did she feel a warning in her heart, An inward clock, that timely struck eleven, And said, sweet Agnes, tender as thou art, One hour is thine; be ready to depart; Thy spouse affianced waits for thee in heaven? I cannot tell, for I was far away, By what slow course of gracious discipline, Through gradual shades of unperceived decay, As moonlight steals on fading summer day, Her spiritual eye was trained to light divine. But yet I trust she never knew the woe Of body's waste, that brings despair and dearth Unto the soul; that living death, so slow, That leaves to those that would yet would not go, No love of heaven, but weary hate of earth. Nay, better, loving dearly to the last All that she ever loved, with fond delay The latest hour before her spirit past, Prayed yet, though feeling that her lot was cast, Like Jesus, that the cup might pass away. FAREWELL! Hath the vast ocean, that strange, humorous thing, In all its depths or perilous banks a shell That hath matured a pearl; let Ocean bring That pearl to thee, and like some gentle spell Which never witch or wicked wizard muttered, But still hath dwelt in angel heart unuttered— Mark on the pearl the sad, sweet word, farewell! Hath the dead earth, dead now, but once alive In every atom,—every pore and cell Relics of life, or fated gems that strive To be their proper selves, and pant and swell Towards Light, the universal mediator, And daily witness of the one Being greater, Hath it aught sadder, sweeter, than farewell! And hath the air—the always gracious air— That ever fleeting yet would gladly dwell For ever in the lowly voice of prayer— Full loth, I ween, when ruder sounds compel Its passive nature to unwilling madness;— Hath air a joy so meek, so sweet a sadness, As when she murmurs in a last farewell! TO A FRIEND SUFFERING UNDER A RECENT BEREAVEMENT. Think not, my friend, my heart or hand are cold Because I do not, and I cannot weep. Too sudden was the knowledge of the woe, And it requires some time, some thoughtful pause, Ere we believe what but too well we know. Some men are lessoned long in sorrow's school, And serve a long apprenticeship to grief, So, when the ill day comes, their minds are clad In funeral garments. Death came here at once, Like the sun's setting in the level sea; No meek, pale warning, melancholy eve, Weaned the fond eyesight from the joyous day; 'Twas full-orbed day, and then 'twas total night— Sad night for us, but better day for her. Well may'st thou mourn, but mourn not without hope: Thou art not one, I know, that can believe A pausing pulse, an intermitted breath, Or aught that can to mortal flesh befal, Can turn to nothing any way of God, Or frustrate one good purpose of our Lord. She was a purpose of the great Creator, Begun on earth, and well on earth pursued, Now in the heaven of heavens consummate, Or happy waiting the predestined day, The flower and glory of her consummation. A SCHOOLFELLOW'S TRIBUTE TO THE MEMORY OF THE REV. OWEN LLOYD. I. I was a comrade of his childish days, And then he was to me a little boy, My junior much, a child of winning ways, His every moment was a throb of joy. Fine wit he had, and knew not it was wit, And native thoughts before he dreamed of thinking; Odd sayings, too, for each occasion fit, To oldest sights the newest fancies linking. And his the hunter's bounding strength of spirit, The fisher's patient craft, and quick delight To watch his line, to see a small fish near it; A nibble—ah! what ecstasy!—a bite. Years glided on, a week was then a year, Fools only say that happy hours are short; Time lingers long on moments that are dear, Long is the summer holiday of sport. But then our days were each a perfect round; Our farthest bourne of hope and fear, to day; Each morn to night appeared the utmost bound, And let the morrow—be whate'er it may. But on the morrow he is in the cliff— He hangs midway the falcon's nest to plunder; Behold him sticking, like an ivy leaf, To the tall rock—he cares not what is under. II. I traced with him the narrow winding path Which he pursued when upland was his way; And then I wondered what stern hand of wrath Had smitten him that wont to be so gay! Then would he tell me of a woful weight— A weight laid on him by a bishop's hand, That late and early, early still and late, He could not bear, and yet could not withstand. Of holy thoughts he spake, and purpose high, Dead in his heart, and yet like spectres stirring; Of Hope that could not either live or die, And Faith confused with self-abhorred demurring. How beautiful the feet that from afar Bring happy tidings of eternal good: Then kiss the feet that so bewildered are; They cannot farther go where fain they would. III. I saw his coffin—'twas enough I saw That he was gone—that his deep wound was healed; No more he struggles betwixt faith and law, The fulness of his bliss is now revealed: He rests in peace; in Langdale's peaceful vale He sleeps secure beneath the grassy sod; Ah, no! he doth not—he hath heard “All hail “Thou faithful servant,” from the throne of God! TO THE MEMORY OF JAMES GREENWOOD. I. Oh, Death! thou art indeed an awful thing Did we believe in all we ought to know; Yet ever brooding, thine invisible wing Casts not a shadow in the vale below. With vernal thyme the turfy hillocks swell, Old Fairfield's side is sweet with fragrant larches, And the slim lady birch he loved so well With paly verdure decks her graceful arches. The lovely things to which he gave a soul, Till they became a body to his mind, Are what they were before the booming toll Declared his corse to hallow'd earth consign'd. Yet in one house, that stands upon the brow, One thought of death and of the dead is all; Their depth of grief is all their comfort now, They pray to God to help their tears to fall. II. He whom they miss, he was not of this land, No grey-coat shepherd of the hill or plain; For he was born where the tall chimneys stand, And the hot wheels are whirring still for gain. And yet as well he loved the mountain height As he himself had been a mountain boy, As well he loved the croft with daisies dight As one that never knew a fiercer joy. Sure thou hast seen, whoever thou may'st be, If thou hast ever seen a London square, A pining thing that ought to be a tree, And would be so if not imprison'd there. And haply thought how beautiful and large The limbs and leaves of that imprison'd thing Had been, if planted by the emerald marge Of dripping well to shade the grateful spring. 'Twas so with him: in office close and dun Full soon he learn'd the needful lore of trade; Skill'd to compute how much the bargain won, And ponder hard if more might have been made. But not the spirit of the world which grew Still more and more beyond the state's control, Could quench his thirst of beauty or subdue The love of Nature which possess'd his soul. So he became a dweller of the hills, And learned to love the village ways so well, He prized the stream that turned the wealthiest mills Less than the syke that trickles down the fell. III. Sad doth it seem, but nought is truly sad, Or only sad that we may better be; We should in very gulphs of grief be glad, The great intents of God could we but see. Think of the souls that he in heaven will meet, Some that on earth he knew and loved most dearly; And whose perfection at their Saviour's feet, Without a stain of earth, will shine so clearly. Think, too, of souls on earth unknown to him, Whom he will know as well as kin or neighbours— Laborious saints, that now with seraphim Expect the blessed fruit of all their labours. Think that he is what oft he wished to be While yet he was a mortal man on earth; Then weep, but know that grief's extremity Contains a hope which never was in mirth. June, 1845. TO A LADY, ON THE DEATH OF HER MOTHER AND DAUGHTER. Sara,—so let me call thee, since that name Is most familiar to thy friendly ear, And for a mother that is now no more, And for a sister passing dear to me— Long time it seems since thou and I have spoke In verse or honest prose, or, happier still, With running comment of looks, lips, and eyes, And silence, when our mutual thought was heard, Discoursed by mute and secret sympathy, Interpreted by some half-melting star, That seemed a part of twilight, or akin To the retiring, pensive, tawny hill, So dim reflected in the dozing lake, It wot not of its presence;—lake once proud Of diamonds dripping from thy silvery oar, When thou, thy boat, and its long-beaded wake, Seem'd like the shadow of a Glendoveer, Floating above in smallest skiff of heaven,— So shy, he would and yet would not be seen. Those times are past,—and I have known thee tamed To sober womanhood and matron grave, Yet like the ever-glad Hesperian tree, Whose summer fruitage gleams through vernal flowers; And I have seen thee, too, in double grief For two pure souls removed, so like each other, They may be playmates in the bowers of bliss,— For souls like theirs receive no taint of time. And who can doubt that each fine faculty, But half-developed in the prophet spring Of thy sweet Katherine's little life, shall bloom In God's own light, consummate and fulfilled? ON THE DEATH OF THOMAS JACKSON, LATE OF LOW WOOD INN, WHO DIED BY A FALL FROM AN APPLE TREE. There is the lake and there the quiet hills, A casual passer would observe no change; Nor sign would see of widow's grief that kills Even Nature's joy, and makes old beauty strange. The last time I beheld thee, lovely lake, Thou wert composed in that expectant calm, Which any sigh of love-sick maid might shake, Or dying close of penitential psalm. I thought of Death. Who doth not think of Death? And felt how sweet a boon that death might be, Were it indeed a calm to feel the breath Whene'er it came of stirring Deity. I thought of Death. But did not think how near That awful sound to its most awful meaning; The babe that feels its mother's breast so near, Slumbers and sucks and never dreams of weaning. And even so we thought his honest face Would ever greet us when we came again; It seemed a natural product of the place, Warmed by the sun and freshened by the rain. But he is gone, the form we long have seen, The vivid image that we bore away, Is now a shadow of what once hath been, The spectre of a body in decay. The lake is there, the hills their distance keep, The tall trees stand as if they mourned for ever, But leave the widowed house alone to weep, Nor seek the widowed heart from grief to sever. For he is gone that was to us a smile, An honest face to welcome when he came; Short was the time, but yet a weary while When Death was struggling with the shattered frame. And many thoughts he had, as may be guessed, And shows of earth that with the vision blended; Shows that at times perplexed, but later blessed The spirit equipped just ere the strife was ended. Perhaps the latest object to employ His parting thought upon the death-bed pillow, Was the dear image of his orphan boy, With small foot challenging the frisky billow. Whatever sight or sound possessed him last, Whatever sound of nature tolled his knell, Gentle the sounds and fair the forms that past Before his closing eye, and all was well. Yes, all was well, for 'twas the will of Him, Who knows both when to sow and when to reap; And now amid the smiling cherubim, Beholds the tears of them he bad to weep. False is the creed, because the heart is dead, That blames the widow's or the orphan's tear; Eyes that beheld the Lord full oft were red With human sorrow while they tarried here. Mourn, for 'tis good for all of us to mourn, In this dark valley where our way we grope; Our very sorrow proves us not forlorn; We mourn, but not as mourners without hope. The lake is still the same, the changeful skies Change by a Law that we may not control, Sage Nature is not bound to sympathise With every passion of a single soul. Look not for sorrow in the changeful skies, The mountain many-hued, or passive lake, But look to Him, who sometimes will chastise Those whom he loves, but never will forsake. ON THE LATE DR. ARNOLD. Spirit of the Dead! Though the pure faith of Him that was on earth Thy subject and thy Lord forbids a prayer— Forbids me to invoke thee as of yore:— (Weak souls, that dared not meet their God alone, Sought countenance and kind companionship Of some particular saint, whose knees had grazed The very rock on which they knelt, whose blood Had made or sanctified the gushing well, Many of the holy wells are said to have sprung from the blood of Martyrs: for example, St. Winifred's in Wales. Round which their fond, mistaken piety Had built a quaint confine of sculptured stone:—) Yet may I hope that wheresoe'er he is, Beneath the altar, by the great white throne, In Abraham's bosom, or amid the deep Of Godhead, blended with eternal light, One ray may reach him from the humble heart That thanks our God for all that he has been. What he is now we know not: he will be A beautiful likeness of the God that gave Him work to do, which he did do so well. Whom Jesus loves, to them he gives the grace For Him to do and suffer in the world; To suffer for the world was His alone. But he in whom we joyed—for whom we mourn— Did he not suffer? Worldly men say, No! Of ills which they call ill he had not many; The poverty which makes the very poor Begrudge a morsel to their very child, Was never his; nor did he “pine in thought,” Seeing the lady of his love possessed By a much richer and no better man. To him the lady of his love was wed, Soon as his manhood authorised a wife; And though the mother of his many babes, To him she still was young, and fair, and fresh, As when the golden ring slipp'd from his hand Upon her virgin finger. Yet he suffered Such pains and throes as only good men feel: For he assumed the task to rear the boy, The bold, proud boy unto a Christian man. 'Twas not with childhood that he had to do, Its wayward moods and ready penitence, That still is prompt to kiss, if not the rod, At least the hand that wields it; not to watch Sweet instinct reaching after distant reason, And mere affection trained to duteous love (Though such the solace of his happy home, Else how had he the hard behest endured?)— Nor was it all—oh, bliss! if it had been— To teach the young capacious intellect How beauteous Greece and Rome, the child “Rome, the child,” &amp;c. Alluding to the heathen prophecy, that Metis, Thetis, &amp;c., were destined to produce a child more potent than his sire, which gave Jupiter so much alarm. foredoomed To catch the sceptre from its parent, spake, Fitting high thoughts with words, and words with deeds. 'Twas his to struggle with that perilous age Which claims for manhood's vice the privilege Of boyhood;—when young Dionysus Dionysus, Aphrodite—Bacchus, Venus. But the Greek divinities were not originally identical with the Roman idols, by whose names they are generally called. Dionysus, or Bacchus, was in all probability an Indian type of the sun, or rather of the great productive energy of the Universe, said to be the youngest of the gods, because his worship was last introduced into Greece. There can be no doubt that the Greeks blended the traditions of their local heroes with the astronomical mythology derived from Egypt and Phœnicia, of which the earliest form survives in India, especially among the wide-spreading Boodhists. seems All glorious as he burst upon the East, A jocund and a welcome conqueror; And Aphrodite, sweet as from the sea She rose and floated in her pearly shell, A laughing girl;—when lawless will erects Honour's gay temple on the mount of God, And meek obedience bears the coward's brand; While Satan, in celestial panoply, With Sin, his lady, smiling by his side, Defies all heaven to arms! 'Twas his to teach, Day after day, from pulpit and from desk, That the most childish sin which man can do Is yet a sin which Jesus never did When Jesus was a child, and yet a sin For which, in lowly pain, He lived and died: That for the bravest sin that e'er was praised The King Eternal wore the crown of thorns. In him was Jesus crucified again; For every sin which he could not prevent Stuck in him like a nail. His heart bled for it As it had been a foul sin of his own. Heavy his cross, and stoutly did he bear it, Even to the foot of holy Calvary; And if at last he sunk beneath the weight, There were not wanting souls whom he had taught The way to Paradise, that, in white robes, Thronged to the gate to hail their shepherd home! EPITAPH ON OWEN LLOYD. Could love devout, or longing sighs, or tears, From God obtain a grant of lengthened years, Then, wandering reader, thou hadst never stood Beside the grave of one so young and good. Still in the small but consecrated place He spake of judgment and he spake of grace; Of judgment dread, and merciful delay: And latest spake of that, the latest day, When those,—how few!—that may compare with him, Shall mount on high with brightest seraphim! MISCELLANEOUS POEMS, CHIEFLY LYRICAL. PLAYFUL AND HUMOROUS PIECES. THE BLIND MAN'S ADDRESS TO HIS LOVE. There is a beauty in the mind, That makes thee fair to me, Sweet Mary Anne, though I am blind, And blind I still must be. I sit in darkness; but I know If thou to me art near, Through all my limbs I feel a glow, A sudden gush of cheer. Put thy least finger's smallest tip Upon my wildest hair, Each vein and nerve in me will skip,— I know that thou art there. They tell me thou art fair to see, And of thy waist so trim; I know thou art straight as poplar tree, And delicately slim. They tell me that thine eyes are black, As black as burning coal: I look, but find my eye-balls lack The light that's in my soul. Thy hand is very soft I know— They tell me it is white; But it is not like the falling snow, Because it does not bite. For cold and biting are the flakes, The melting flakes of snow, When the blinding snow-storm overtakes The blind men as they go. But thy hand is soft, it melts away, And then I hear thee speak; And ever thy words are blithe and gay, But thy voice is smooth as thy cheek. So well I love the thought I have, I do not wish to see; I will live on in my darksome cave, So thou wilt live with me. SONG. TO A WELSH AIR, “AR HYD Y NOS. Old I am, yet not past feeling, Maiden think not so; Time, the thief, for ever stealing Moments as they go. Still the moment dear has left me, Moment that of self bereft me, Moment that did wound with healing, Cause and cure of woe. Hope, and yet not hope, it gave me— Oh! that lovely smile— Hope, alas! too brief to save me, Yet 'twas sweet the while, Bright as joy, and sweet as pity, Little like thyself, and pretty, Nought beside can now enslave me, Nothing else beguile Old I am and daily older, Not in days alone, Yet, methinks, that I am bolder Since that grey I'm grown; Young, I had not dared address thee, Old, I may presume to bless thee, Hope is dead and fancies moulder, All but Love is flown. Smile again. The look that gazes, Asks not, wants not, no; Laugh at me and all my praises, Laugh at all my woe. But when I have done with sighing, In the quiet churchyard lying, Softly smile upon the daisies On my grave that grow. ON SEEING THREE YOUNG LADIES ON GRASMERE LAKE. Within the compass of a little vale There lies a Lake unknown in Fairy tale, Which not a Poet knew in ancient days, When all the world believed in Ghosts and Fays; Yet on that Lake I have beheld a Boat That seemed a fairy Pinnace all afloat, On some bless'd mission to a distant isle, To do meet worship to some ruined pile, Where long of yore the Fairies used to meet And haply hallow with their last retreat; For all alone the boat was on the waters, And in it three of “Beauty's youngest daughters.” Sometimes at rest, like infant on a pillow, Then gliding soft as light upon a billow, When lady's hand drew nigh to lady's breast The oar, so fond:—yet there it might not rest, But thence dispatched, went forth like errant knight For new achievement on the plain so bright. Oh! when it stopped, the boat, and damsels three Charming the calm air with their triple glee, While all the shadows on the lake projected, Moved little as the mountains they reflected; It seemed a thing ordained for aye to stay Just where it was and sleep from day to day. And when it moved with slide and gentle stroke, Rippling the shadow of the hanging oak, Sole motion, only life on all the mere, 'Twas like the motion of the lapsing year, Which none would more expect or wish to cease Than his own pulse. The fancy of old Greece That gave to beauty and to loveliness The definite outline and the shape express, Could not conceive, and therefore could not make, Aught so divine as that still evening Lake, With shadow deep, with gold and purple glowing, And those three lovely maids upon its bosom rowing. MARRIED LIFE. WRITTEN ON THE ANNIVERSARY OF A WEDDING DAY. The earth once more hath run its annual round, And smiles as faintly at the paling sun As when by holy rite ye twain were bound, And a glad brother's voice proclaimed ye one; One in the Lord, as one in heart and choice, For ye alike had chosen the better way, And therefore will with holy glee rejoice, When Autumn grave brings back the wedding-day. All hath not haply been as young conceit Of wedded bliss the story would compose, But have ye found the song of love less sweet Because translated into household prose? Duties there needs must be, and toils, and cares, And there may be some salutary pains, That unexpected come and unawares To all that walk in wedlock's lightest chains. The man who tills the blessed Saviour's land, Must sow a seed that oft is long a growing; And she that would assist with patient hand, Must water daily while her spouse is sowing. The world besieges sore the wedded pair, And many a charm of youth is early blighted, But Heaven preserve ye both from fruitless care, And bless the day whereon ye were united. A POOR MAN'S REASONS FOR NOT MARRYING. I heard thy voice amid the psalm, Where many voices meet, Yet thy low voice was like a calm, It was so soft and sweet. 'Twas like a calm upon the ocean, When seas have been in wild commotion. I heard thy voice one summer eve Within thy lowly cot, When I am sure thou didst believe That mortal heard it not. And then thy voice was bold and strong, Singing a solitary song. I heard a meagre mother sing, With small and whining note, To soothe a little pining thing, From bare and hungry throat; And then I thought, O lady mine, May never such a song be thine! LINES WRITTEN IMPROMPTU AFTER HEARING A LADY SINGING. Like a blithe birdie in a darksome isle Of changeless holly mid a spacious wood; Such was the song, and such the pensive smile, Robed in the garb of early widowhood. And yet not so, the birdie has a nest, And sings of hopes and joys that yet are coming, When every bush is in its vernal best, And all her callow brood are sunk to rest To thousand thousand insects' joyous humming. But not in hope the human songstress trills The lilt of joy, or long, long note of sorrow; We sing not well till frequent proofs of ills Have made us too distrustful of to-morrow; And yet sometimes we gladly would be gay— So let's rejoice in joy of yesterday. Dec. 26th 1840. GOOD NIGHT. Good night, good friend, good night to thee, Good night, sweet lady fair and free, For the night has been a good night to me, Though thou art come from a far countree. Smiles soft and still, not laughter high, Have gladdened our quiet company, And ever and aye with a happy sigh Thou smilest on the baby sleeping by. See how the baby smiles in her sleep. What dream on her soul doth lightly creep? What fancy so pretty is playing bo-peep With the innocent's thoughts in the fields of sleep? When slumbering babies smile in a dream, 'Tis their angel, as antique faith would deem, That plays with their hearts like a moonlight beam, Stealing through chinks to a hidden stream. Good night, good night, the smile is past, And I must say good night at last; I am long agoing, but hark to the blast, And the rain that patters so loud and fast. But I will carry sweet thought away, To sweeten my bread for many a day, When I think of the beautiful babe that lay So calm yet as bright as an image of May. VALENTINE, BY AN AGED LOVER. Some ladies like a man whose hair Is bright as threads of gold, Some the dark youth and some the fair, But few the man that's old. My locks were jetty black in May, But latest autumn makes them grey. Where is the maiden that will twine Round doddered oak, a lithe woodbine, And choose an old man for her valentine. 'Twere vain to say thou wilt be free To merry be or grave; Better an old man's darling be, Than be a young man's slave. 'Twere vain to talk of common sense, And lessons of experience; For tears that in the dim eye shine, And trace the wrinkle's furrowed line, Were never shed by winsome valentine. LINES. If I were young as I have been, And you were only gay sixteen, I would address you as a goddess, Write loyal cantos to your boddice, Wish that I were your cap, your shoe, Or any thing that's near to you. But I am old, and you, my fair, Are somewhat older than you were. A lover's language in your hearing Would sound like irony and jeering. Once you were fair to all that see, Now you are only fair to me. [As the dew of the morning bestars every blade] As the dew of the morning bestars every blade, But ere noon is no more on the plain, Yet abides in the bell of the flower in the shade Till dew comes at evening again. So the feelings of youth, the fond faith of the heart, In manhood dry up like the dew. Oh! let them survive in the soul's better part, Till death shall the morning renew. [Never till now I felt myself so old] Never till now I felt myself so old As seeing you so tall, such bursting roses Just at the time when rosy buds unfold Their sweet concealment into summer posies. So may I measure time, nor cease to see His silent work in still maturing graces. I quite forgive what he has done to me, For what he has bestow'd on your sweet faces. TO A FRIEND LEAVING GRASMERE. Sweet Grasmere vale, though I must leave Thy hills and quiet waters, Nor sing again at fragrant eve To glad thy winsome daughters, Yet will I fondly think of thee, And thy fair maids will think of me, When I am far away. I think of thee, but 'tis a thought That has no touch of sadness; I joy to think that I have brought To thee so much of gladness. Such thoughts I fain would leave behind To maidens that are fair and kind, When I am far away. SONG. Have you seen the stars at morning, How they blend with rising day, Paling still and still adorning All the morn with their decay. Paling, blinking, Coyly winking, While the gold usurps the grey. So with fancies of the heathen, Brightest stars of heathen night, Slowly of their reign bereaven, Lose themselves in Gospel light. Stars of warning Melt in morning, End their task and bid good night. SONG. You ask me to sing—I'd be glad if I could Sing like a thrush in the underwood, Like a twinkling lark that sings up in the sky, Or a swan that sings only when going to die. Ere now I have sung, when my heart was young, Like cock-crow loud and clearly, But I cannot sing now, I protest, I vow, Because I love you dearly. Could I sing like a syren—but that would I not, Could I sing like a minstrel whose name is forgot, But whose strain is a treasure which all men may borrow, To harmonise joy and to sweeten their sorrow, Oh, then I would sing to my dear, dear thing, Like cock-crow loud and clearly, But I cannot sing now, I protest, I vow, Because I love you dearly. Could I sing what I feel, and express by a note How justly esteeming, how fondly I dote, Then would music no more be a nice thing of art, But as in old time the true voice of the heart. I could sing all day long—sing song after song, Like an angel singing clearly, But I cannot sing now, I protest, I vow, Because I love you dearly. THE SOLACE OF SONG. When on my mother's arm I lay A happy helpless thing, Still was I glad by night and day To hear my mother sing, Baby, baby, do not cry, It was a lovely lullaby. I was a boy, a wayward boy, And yet I still would cling, With something like a baby joy, To any that could sing. Sing up, sing high, a merry lay, For 'tis a merry holiday. I was a youth, a sighing youth, A zephyr of the spring, And then I thought that all was truth That I was fond to sing. Sweetly, sweetly let me die In the soft breathing of a sigh. But now, alas, I am a man, And time has pruned my wing, And I have but a little space To flutter and to sing. Singing to the autumn blast, Be my sweetest song my last. And should I live to be an old, An old forgotten thing, Yet never may my heart be cold When holy maidens sing. Holy, holy, may the Psalm My very latest sense embalm! A SONG WITHOUT A TUNE. A song without a tune I made in the month of June, Eighteen hundred and forty-eight; 'Tis right to be exact in date. Sweet lassy, parted we have been A full twelvemonth and more, And many a change the world has seen, And many a heart been sore. Kings that were mighty monarchs then Are not, or nothing are but men. And many a maid that loved a man Of wealth and high degree Must try to love him, if she can, In perilous poverty. For in the wild creed of the time, To have been rich is deem'd a crime. We were not rich, we were not kings, We are just where we were; No hope has borne us on its wings, To drop us in despair. I might forget an hour had pass'd Since the sweet hour I saw thee last, Thou art so very like the maid I saw twelve months ago; And yet almost I am afraid Thou dost not feel it so. Thou art, my love, the same to me, But am I quite the same to thee? The lines are deeper on my brow, The corners of my eyes Are quaintly netted, I allow, As wings of dragon flies; My cheek the red and yellow dapple, Much like a last year's russet apple. A year is nothing to a man That forty years hath seen; But, ah! it is no little span, 'Twixt fifteen and sixteen. Now I perceive a year hath flown, And thou almost a woman grown. A something sure hath cross'd thy view, Or perhaps some lady sage Hath told what to thy hopes is due, And to thy stately age: Yet thou hast not forgot me—no; But thou would'st very fain do so. Farewell! I will not vex thee more,— I would not be a blot On thy fair page, a fretting sore, An ever-tangled knot. What matter what thou think'st on me, While thy young heart is glad and free. GOD SAVE THE QUEEN. A NEW VERSION. Not what I would, but what I could, I give our little Queen so good, Adapting thus a custom'd strain To the sweet promise of her reign, Whatever men in any part lie, May they be loyal all as Hartley Coleridge. God save our Island's hope, Long live the people's hope, God bless our Queen. Still may our Queen be free, Then evermore will she Love that good liberty Which makes her Queen. Oh! may she prize that gem Bright in her diadem, Fair on her brow; So, to the end of days, May God approve her ways, And heaven resound her praise As earth does now. Lord keep her evermore, Pure in her own heart's core, Kind and serene; So shall the wise and good Reverence her womanhood, And the glad multitude Love their young Queen. May He that dwells on high All her thoughts sanctify; Seraphs unseen Sing up with holy glee, “Let this maid's name still be Omen of victory,” God save the Queen! [A wanton bard in heathen time] “Non bene conveniunt nec unâ in sede morantur Majestas et amor.”—Ov. Met., ii. 846. A wanton bard in heathen time, In sensual age and sensual clime, Hath sung that no accord can be Of love with god-like majesty. Far other had his sentence been Had gentle Ovid ever seen An English home, a Christian Queen; For love, content in cot to dwell, Becomes a British palace well. And our young Queen, whose happy choice Has made a noble land rejoice, Is sure the monarch need not smother The feelings of a wife and mother. A wife and mother truly great, In woman's duties consummate, Such is she now. And every wife And mother wishes joy and life To the good Queen that dignifies The mother's cares, the baby's cries. Now, every mother in the isle, When she beholds her infant smile, Should have a good wish and a prayer For her the matron Queen so fair; Who, though a Queen, has that in common With every homely household woman, That she has got a babe to love, And knows there is a God above That will the babes alike receive; For they have all one mother Eve— May in one well of life be laved, And by one Jesus shall be saved. Oh! may that God prepare their hearts, Alike to fill their several parts. Dec., 1840. THE GUERNSEY LILY. AMARYLLIS SAMIENSIS. “This plant was brought from Japan, where it was found by Kaempfer and also by Thunberg, who visited that country in 1775. It was first cultivated in the garden of John Morin, at Paris, where it blowed for the first time on the 7th of October, 1634. It was then made known by Jacob Cornutus, under the name of ‘Narcissus Japonicus flore rutilo.’ After this it was again noticed by John Ray, in 1665, who called it the Guernsey Lily. A ship, returning from Japan, was wrecked on the coasts of Guernsey, and a number of the bulbs of this plant, which were on board, being cast on shore, took root in that sandy soil.”—Beckman's Inventions, vol. iii. Far in the East, and long to us unknown, A lily bloom'd, of colours quaint and rare; Not like our lilies, white, and dimly fair, But clad like Eastern monarch on his throne. A ship there was by stress of tempest blown, And wreck'd on beach, all sandy, flat, and bare;— The storm-god bated of his rage to spare The queenly flower, foredoom'd to be our own. The Guernsey fisher, seeking what the sea Had stolen to aid his hungry poverty, Starts to behold the stranger from afar, And wonders what the gorgeous thing might be, That like an unsphered and dejected star Gleam'd in forlorn and mateless majesty. TO A YOUNG LADY FROM A FOREIGN CLIME. Thou sweet exotic, lovely brown! No fair one could be sweeter,— Young as thou art, thou wilt not frown Upon an old man's metre. Rich is the sky where thou wert born, And gorgeous were the flowers; But yet I trust thou wilt not scorn This cold blue sky of ours. And though the flowers of Westmorland Do not surcharge the wind With burden of perfume so bland As flowers of Western Ind; Yet are they sweet if they be sought Where careless eyes would miss them; They crouch so low, as if they thought A maid should stoop to kiss them. Our little birds they are not deck'd With hues of molten gems; Their modest plumes do not reflect The rays of diadems. But yet they twitter sweetly, sweetly, Their little notes so clear, Methinks they could not sing more fitly To little maiden's ear. There is a blackness in thine hair— A deep black in thine eye— That do not speak of English air, But of a hotter sky. And there is something in the mouth, Not easy to be told, That marks thee of the passionate south, And not of northern mould. Then learn to love all simple things, That pretty are and cool. Look how the swallow dips its wings, And glides along the pool; For it hath felt the Afric suns Voluptuously hot, Yet comes to rear its little ones Beside the English cot. So may'st thou keep the tropic glow And the full joy of life, Yet tame thy current to the flow Of a cheerful English wife. AN AUTOGRAPH. What is the trifle which you would demand? The self-betraying of a tremulous hand, That ne'er in useful labour was employed, Though once with self-production overjoyed. Its strutting capitals and whisking tails, Quaint cyphers, slanting to the veering gales Of vanity and would-be wit, implied That e'en my digits felt a Poet's pride. That pride of rhyme, that pert, pen-jerking joy, Has left me long. I am no more a boy; For yesternoon, alas! brought home to me The solemn tidings I was forty-three. At such an age the triumph of the pen Is poor indeed to poor and pensive men. And yet my pen finds something still to fee it, Though mean my name, yet you desire to see it. SONG. Rose, and violet, and pansy, Each has told a tale of love, Various with the freak of fancy. Apt and bold the fields to rove, See the pansy; Seek her not in secret grove. Rose of summer, lovely creature! Who did ever look on thee, But beheld the very feature Which he most was glad to see,— Fairest, dearest, Whosoe'er the dear may be? Long ago, when I was roaming, In a shady path I met, Dim and blue as summer gloaming, Far apart from all the rest, Meek and lowly, Her, my own dear violet. THE OLD ARM-CHAIR: AN AUTOBIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH. High was my lineage, many an age ago My grandsire nursed the mystic mistletoe, By Druid shorn for dark primeval rite, With golden sickle by the pale moonlight, When forests dank of patriarchal oak, “That never echo'd to the woodman's stroke, In boundless contiguity of shade,” Possess'd the destined seats of wealth and trade. The dappled deer, the sullen shaggy bear, The tall elk, bursting from its bosky lair, And all the natural tribes of earth and air, All, all, familiar with the gnarled tree, Did homage to my sire's antiquity. Had he possess'd a human heart and speech As sage to know and eloquent to teach As his dark brethren of Dodona, then What tales could he have told of beasts and men! Of Giant Albion, and his peer in fame, That to far-jutting Cornwall Cornwall. The Giants Albion and Corineus are memorised by Geoffrey of Monmouth and by Spenser. left his name,— Of Trojan Brutus, and his progeny, The boast of many a Welsh long pedigree, And many a king and chief, forgotten long, Embalm'd in Geoffrey's prose and Spenser's laureate song: But mute he was, unable to divine The lamentable lot of old Locrine; Nor aught of Camber Camber gave name to Cambria and Cumberland; Albinact to Albania, the poetic name of Scotland. or of Albinact Could he relate, nor of poor Lear distract, Though once, I think, that Lear was fain to house And sing mad songs beneath my grandsire's boughs: And sure the kindly tree bemoan'd his grief, With groaning fibre and with quivering leaf. The Romans came,—they came, they fought, they slew, They conquer'd, reign'd awhile, and then withdrew From Britain's isle. Yet, as wild winds bestrew The long lanes that they make in close defiles Of intermingled underwood for miles, With wrecks and relics of their fatal glee, And trophies of triumphant anarchy; So, when the hairy myriads of the North O'erleap'd the barrier,—when the Pict rush'd forth, And Caledonia pour'd from cavern'd rocks, From all her crankling bays and sinuous lochs, From purple moor, green shaw, and quaking fen, Her grisly superfluity of men,— And not to heal, but aggravate the sore, Came the red sea-kings from the Saxon shore, Wave after wave, and blast outhowling blast, Till all despair'd that any would be last;— Though shy Civility and stately Form Or fled or fell before the human storm, Nor quite effaced were all the steps of Time, For Druid saw was blent with Runic rhyme,— The oak, which Briton bards had sung beneath, And whence the Roman pluck'd his civic wreath, Was still an oak, and grew in power and pride, With its old shade, new kingdoms to divide. My grandsire's story it were long to tell,— How long he flourish'd, how at last he fell! Was it his doom in shallow bark to bow His knotty strength, and form a pirate's prow? Made he the vast beam of a baron's hall, Or board smooth-rubb'd for lavish festival? Or iron-headed ram, to smite the tottering wall? Ah no! He was a dedicated tree From the first germ of his nativity. For many a year in holy peace he stood, The tallest of a noble brotherhood; At length a godly king bestow'd their trunks On a fraternity of studious monks,— Good men, that wore the penitential weed. Unquiet times of such meek men have need. Long was the age—some thought an age too much— That I was hallowed from a woman's touch. I was a mere discomfort of a chair; Monk did not sit in me, and did not dare: My wooden arms had never clasped the fair. My bones were stiff to plague the bones of others. The long bare legs of those long-praying brothers In me have left a dell, a hollow dint, Beyond the date of reminiscent print. But when bluff Harry rent the British rose From the old stalk on which her sister grows, When Luther's trumpet with a voice of storm Defied the Pope and bid the Church reform, Then I, alas! was but a bit of wood; For those who leaned on me, and those that stood, Or knelt beside me in accustom'd prayer, Became the pensioners of earth and air. Poor wanderers, doom'd from doubting souls to crave The shelter and the food which late they gave. While I—last note of a forgotten ditty, No more a thing of worship, scarce of pity— Am fain to rest unconsecrated now, Like a pale votary forced to break her vow, The humble inmate of a genial room, Far from monastic pomp, monastic gloom. I will not say how many men have sat Between my arms to slumber or to chat; What flying maid, what panting fugitive, What sinner breathing the last word—forgive; What lady-love, that dotes on babe so fresh, And feels the life in its soft dimpling flesh; Nor what besides of sorrow or of mirth I may have witness'd by the glowing hearth. 'Tis true—(I fear not to reveal the truth)— My later days were gayer than my youth; Yet may my age for aye respected be, For one good woman's sake that sat on me. TO THE MAGPIE. What shall we say of thee, pert, perking Mag, Whose every motion seems to fish for praise, Whose whole existence is a game at brag? Art thou a stranger quite to poet's lays, With black and white thy pretty self adorning, Like a blithe widow in her second mourning? Thou wert the pet bird of the God of wine, And dear thou art, and should'st be very dear, To that great Son of Jove whose mighty line, After long strife, and many a toilsome year, Regain'd at last their lawful heritage, And reign'd in southern Greece for many an age. For great Alcides never had a home— No wonder if his loves were vagabond. Once in a hollow vale he chanced to roam, And of a village maid grew sudden fond. What shall we say?—the buxom village lass Became the mother of Æchmacoras. Æchmacoras, fil. Herculis, ex vitiatâ Phillone, filiâ Alcimedontis Herois; qui cum in lucem editus fuisset, ab Alcimedonte, unà cùm matre Phillone, in proximo monte feris expositus fuit: ibi vagientem infantem cùm pica imitaretur, ad hujus avis vocem, quòd puerilem esse credidisset, Hercules fortè illàc iter habens conversus, puellam et a se genitum puerum agnovit, ambosque vinculis liberavit.—Pausan. in Arcadic. (Hofmanni Lex. Univ.) The brawny sire, as usual, went his way, New loves to woo—new monsters to destroy. But the poor mother—she that went astray— All husbandless, with her unfathered boy— What can she do? Her ruthless father's curse Bids her conceal a small sin with a worse. She wrapt her baby in a lion's skin, The lion's skin her roving lover gave, And left the helpless witness of her sin In the dark wood. Ye happy wood-nymphs, save, As ye would keep your innocence secure, The helpless thing—like you—so sweet and pure. Nought that the poet feigned in happiest mood, Or pagan priest invented in his trade, Was ever half so beautiful or good As the kind things that Nature's self hath made: O'er the poor babe the magpie chatters still, Soothes with its wings, and feeds it with its bill. Ere long the strenuous foe of Hydra came— He came in pride of some new conquest won; But when he saw how pale the hapless dame, The childless mother, by himself undone, Enraged he rushed into the forest wild, To seek the pledge of love, the hapless child. I will not say how loud the thickets crash'd, For he would never step an inch aside; Or how far off the timid lions lash'd Their sides; or how, less wild, the serpents eyed The trampling terror. Nought he cared for this— For lion's inward growl, or serpent's smothered hiss— But ever onward he pursued the cry, The still repeated one note of the bird, That faithful sat where that poor babe did lie. Still he pursued the note, and never err'd; And there he found them both—the babe and Mag— In the dark wood, beneath the mossy crag. The babe became a hero in its time; The bird, its task performed, it fled away. To the good bird I dedicate this rhyme; The hero lives in many an antique lay. Oh could my song preserve thy nest of briar, As thou the babe Herculean for its sire! TO A RED HERRING. Wonder of art and nature! ocean-born, Like Aphrodite, Queen of Love and Life, And those white nymphs that dwell in crystal bowers, And oft, when ships were rare, and none had burst Into that ocean which first Cortez view'd From Darien's heights, beneath the summer moon, Were wont to weave their labyrinthine dance On the smooth surface of the sacred sea, To minstrelsy of kindred sprites of air,— Child of the waves! whose antique ancestry Saw unappall'd, say rather with huge joy, The avenging fountains of the deep broke up, And the vast hollow globe of waters pour Dark and continuous o'er the offending earth. Then did the creatures of the sea rejoice! The arrowy shark shot swift o'er cities drown'd, But soon grew sluggish with mere gluttony; Then herrings fearless stray'd o'er all the world, For even the hungriest tyrants of the floods, The finny aristocracy, o'ergorged With flesh, for fish had no more appetite Than pious Papist at the end of Lent. Herrings were happy then, but were not red; The green effulgence of their scaly suit Rippled the sunny sea with emerald light For many a league, what time their countless hosts Sped from their chill septentrion nursery, In numbers without number, numberless! A tribe to which the whole of Adam's race, By Leuwenhoeck seen through optic lens, With all whom Malthus, and his sage compeers, Extinguish'd in the breeding womb of time By vice and misery—and, oh, ye Gods! Moral restraint, were but a band élite, A biped aristocracy, as few As Protestants in Erin, as the pale Albino monster upon Afric shore, As gentlemen in Parliament reform'd, As honest men—in any place you please. TO A CAT. Nelly, methinks, 'twixt thee and me, There is a kind of sympathy; And could we interchange our nature,— If I were cat, thou human creature,— I should, like thee, be no great mouser, And thou, like me, no great composer; For, like thy plaintive mews, my muse, With villainous whine doth fate abuse, Because it hath not made me sleek As golden down on Cupid's cheek; And yet thou canst upon the rug lie, Stretch'd out like snail, or curl'd up snugly, As if thou wert not lean or ugly; And I, who in poetic flights Sometimes complain of sleepless nights, Regardless of the sun in heaven, Am apt to dose till past eleven. The world would just the same go round If I were hang'd and thou wert drown'd; There is one difference, 'tis true,— Thou dost not know it, and I do. [Angels have wings? Well, let them grow—] Angels have wings? Well, let them grow— May it be long before you know Whether they have or not. But geese have wings, and quills as good, Perhaps, as wings of angels could Supply—could they be got. But oh! dear lady, why contrive To make the vainest man alive Conceited more than ever: I will not call these pens divine, But certain they were pens of thine, And that's enough, however. DE ANIMABUS BRUTORUM. No doubt 'twere heresy, or something worse Than aught that priests call worthy of damnation, Should I maintain, though in a sportive verse, That bird or fish can e'er attain salvation; Yet some have held that they are all possess'd, And may be damn'd, although they can't be bless'd. Such doctrine broach'd Antonio Margerita, A learned Spaniard, mighty metaphysical. To him the butterfly had seem'd a Lytta,— His wasp-stung wits were grown so quaint and phthisical; To him the sweetest song of Philomel Had talk'd of nothing in the world but hell. Heaven save us all from such a horrid dream! Nor let the love of heaven,—of heaven, forsooth!— Make hard our hearts, that we should so blaspheme God for Christ's sake, and lie for love of truth. Poor Tray! art thou indeed a mere machine, Whose vital power is a spirit unclean? If all the lives that throng the air and earth, And swarm innumerous in the slimy deep, Die once for all, and have no second birth,— If, ceasing once, they do not even sleep, But are no more than sounds of yesterday, Or rainbow tints that come and pass away,— Yet are they not to loving Nature lost; She doth but take them to herself again! The curious pencilling of moonlit frost Melts in the morning ray, and leaves no stain; Yet every drop preserved distils in showers, And winds along the path of dewy flowers. Nor shall they all in their oblivion lie, Nor lack the life, though vain that life may be, Which breathes in strains that wasting time defy: A poet's song can memorise a flea; The subtle fancy of deep-witted Donne, The wee phlebotomist descanted on. And once that strenuous insect leap'd by chance Upon the white breast of a Gallic dame; Forthwith the wits of universal France Vied to consign the happy flea to fame! Pasquier, the gravest joker of his age, Berhymed La Puce in many a polished page. The Teian bard, so skittish and so hoary, That loved so well all things that merry be, In honied phrases gave to blithest glory The shrill cicada chirping cheerily; The bloodless songster drunk with balmy dew, Whose happy being every year is new. That sad old wag, that Peter Pindar hight, Who was no worshipper of William Pitt's, Did whilome soar a bold Pindaric flight To celebrate the progeny of nitts, Telling how once a creature without wings The crown invaded of the best of kings. The insect empress, and her clustering throng Of chemists, famed for geometric skill, Have lent their laboured sweets to Virgil's song, Their stings bequeathed to wicked Mandeville; Wealthy as Tyre their homes, the more their sorrow, Like Tyre despoiled, and smothered like Gomorrah. “Go to the ant, thou sluggard, and be wise!” So said the amorous king that wrote of hyssop,— You know the rest. Nothing that creeps or flies Reads half so good a lesson in all Æsop. Great Johnson has berhymed the words; I swear, He'd better far have left them as they were. No question you have heard of Virgil's gnat, Which by our gentle Spenser was transmuted, Though probably I need not tell you that Its authenticity is much disputed; And 'tis denied also by judgments nice That Homer ever sung of frogs and mice. If Homer did not, some one did, I'm sure; The tale is extant in the choicest Greek. Can living tongue express, in phrase so pure, The deep bass croak, and shriller treble squeak? And Aristophanes no title lacks To his brekekekek koax koax. But thou dark dweller of the central rock, Spawned ere avenging waves the hills o'erflowed, Survivor of full many an earthquake's shock, Last of the Troglodytes, primæval toad, Like antique virtue, hated upon earth, Or trampled under foot, like modest worth,— Time was (or else our ancestors were liars) That thou to mystic verse wert not unknown, When witches danced around Tartarean fires, To screech of owls and mandrake's fatal groan; For thou could'st drain the marrow, mad the brains, Or foulest passion breed in chastest veins. Most poets are great wanderers by night, And love the moon, though sons of Phœbus call'd; And well we ken the small scarce-moving light Of the she, wingless, amorous emerald, That keeps her lone lamp burning for her mate, Pining because he always is so late. Unlike her kindred of the glowing zone, That star the dark groves of the tropic even, There the proud earth has comets of her own, And every shoal out-fires the distant heaven, And all the groves and underwoods unfold A gorgeous blossoming of fire and gold. Is it to soothe our sorrow, or deride, That these bright insects leave both flower and tree, And swarm upon the new-heaped earth beside The pit designed for dead mortality? Who has not heard of death-lights on a grave? And these are death-lights, gay, and bright, and brave! But who may count, with microscopic eye, The multitudes of lives that gleam and flash Behind the rousing keel, and multiply In myriad millions, when the white oars dash Through waves electric, or at stillest night Spread round the bark becalm'd their milky white? Oh, had the bards that did so sweetly sing In times of old, when poesy was young, Known but the half, in their quick blooming spring, Of what we know, how sweetly had they sung! Then many a plant, that yet has not a name, Had won a story and a deathless fame; And many a living thing of instinct wise, Of form majestic, or of brightest plume, That o'er the vast South Sea unwearied flies, Or mid the broad magnolia's fiery bloom Builds its low nest, had been beloved of men, Like Robin Redbreast and plain Jenny Wren. TO GOODY TWOSHOES. Ah, little Goody! I have known thee long, And feel it strange to call thee Lady Jones. Art thou as happy mid the bowing throng As when thou hadst thy two shoes on the stones? Sole sound of comfort that could reach thy heart, When thy companion child must needs depart. Thy lamb, thy raven, and thy box of letters, Thy love for all the tribes of earth and air, Thy shrewd odd sayings, apt to make thy betters, Or folks so called, look round with wondrous stare, And deeper minds reflect on wisdom given To fortune's waifs by compensating Heaven;— All these, to curious childhood dear, as new, Retain a value to the satiate age, And press full oft before the inward view Of souls long strangers to the brief square page, The tinselled covers, and the strange old pictures That served our ancestors instead of lectures. I've trembled with thee in the church so cold, And fearful in its soundless solitude. What place so weary as deserted fold, Where few hours past the shepherd wise and good Had spoke the words that take the sting from death, And change our human tears to wells of faith? But more of fear and more of pain was thine, And short and smothered was thy sweet breath, when A little musty hay, a narrow line Of darkness, parted thee from evil men, With horrid whisper plotting crime and plunder, Mocking with muttered oaths the awful thunder. A neighbourhood unmeet for one like thee; Yet out of evil, maids whose minds are right, As thine was in its sweet simplicity, Draw blessings for themselves; celestial light Beams on the weakest in extreme distresses— Assurance, where proud prudence hardly guesses. Such wert thou, Goody, in thy childish days, And though, no doubt, thou didst grow old in time, And wert a spinster much deserving praise, That praise I will not speak in prose or rhyme; For rather I'd believe thee tripping still With Ralph the Raven, and with Baa-Lamb Bill. TO ROBERT SOUTHEY, NEITHER THE ESQUIRE, THE LAUREATE, THE LL.D., BUT THE GOOD MAN, THE MERRY MAN, THE POET, AND THE DOCTOR. He was not born beneath the Cambrian hills; No mountain breezes lull'd his infant slumbers; Loud rattling cars, and penny-dropping tills, And blended murmurs of conglomerate numbers, Were the chief sounds that baby Robert heard; The pecking sparrow, his sole household bird. Great Bristol was his nest and natal town, And not till he had cast his baby frock He felt the liberal air of Durdum Down, Or look'd on Avon from St. Vincent's rock, Whence many a bark was seen in trim array, Bound on bad quest to hapless Africa. 'Tis hard to say what might have been his lot, If born with Nature from the first to dwell; Yet am I prone to guess that he would not Have conn'd, or known, or loved her half so well. She was a stranger to his opening eyes, Clad with the charm of still renew'd surprise. And finding little in the daily round To fashion fancy from the things of sense, His love of kin was all the more profound; Not wide in surface, but in act intense, Affection still a dutiful reality, The ground and law, and soul of all morality. Yet keeping still his little heart at home, He wander'd with his mind in realms remote, Made playmates of the Fairy, Sylph, and Gnome, And knew each Giant, Knight, and Wight of note Whate'er of wonderful the East and North, Darkly commingling, gender'd and brought forth. Sweet thought he found, and noble, in the story Of the Wehr-Wolf and sweet Red Ridinghood, Shudder'd at feast of Ogre, raw and gory, And watch'd the Sleeping Beauty in the wood. THE LARCH GROVE. Line above line the nursling larches planted, Still as they climb with interspace more wide, Let in and out the sunny beams that slanted, And shot and crankled down the mountain's side. The larches grew, and darker grew the shade; And sweeter aye the fragrance of the Spring; Pink pencils all the spiky boughs arrayed, And small green needles called the birds to sing. They grew apace as fast as they could grow, As fain the tawny fell to deck and cover, They haply thought to soothe the pensive woe, Or hide the joy of stealthy tripping lover. Ah, larches! that shall never be your lot; Nought shall you have to do with amorous weepers, Nor shall ye prop the roof of cozy cot, But rumble out your days as railway sleepers. DENT. I. There is a town, of little note or praise, Narrow and winding are its rattling streets, Where cart with cart in cumbrous conflict meets, Hard straining up or backing down the ways, Where insecure the crawling infant plays, And the nigh savour of the hissing sweets Of pan or humming oven rankly greets The hungry nose that threads the sinuous maze; Yet there the lesson of the pictured porch, The beauty of Platonic sentiment, The sceptic wisdom, positive in doubt, All creeds and fancies, like the hunter's torch, Caught each from each, perfection find in Dent, Where what they cannot get they do without. GEOLOGY. II. In that small town was born a worthy wight, (His honest townsmen well approve his worth,) Whose mind has pierced the solid crust of earth, And roam'd undaunted in the nether night. His thought a quenchless incorporeal light, Has thrid the labyrinth of a world unknown, Where the old Gorgon time has turned to stone Long thorny snake and monstrous lithophyte. Long mayst thou wander in that deep obscure, And issuing thence, good sage, bring with thee still That honest face, where truth and goodness shine; Right was thy creed, as all thy life was pure. And yet if certain persons had their will, The fate of Galileo had been thine. TRANSLATIONS. FROM THE GERMAN. There is an angel that abides Within the budding rose; That is his home, and there he hides His head in calm repose. The rose-bud is his humble bower, And yet he often loves to roam; And wending through the path of Heaven, Empurples all the track of even. If e'er he sees a maiden meek, He hovers nigh, and flings Upon the modest maiden's cheek The shadow of his wings. Oh, lovely maiden, dost thou know Why thy cheeks so warmly glow? 'Tis the Angel of the Rose, That salutes thee as he goes. FROM CATULLUS. PASSER, DELICIÆ MEÆ PUELLÆ. Little sparrow, pretty sparrow, Darling of my “winsome marrow,” Plaything, playmate, what you will, Tiny love, or naughty Phil, Tempted, teased, to peck and hop On her slender finger top, Free to nuzzle and to rest In the sweet valley of her breast; Her wee, wee comfort in her sorrow's wane, When sinks to sleep the fever of her pain. Little sparrow, come to me, I can play as well as she, And like her I would be fain Thou could'st sport away my pain, Dear to me as fruit of gold, Which by crafty lover roll'd, In that fleet maiden's path, untwisted all The quaint knots of her cincture virginal. FROM CATULLUS. LUGETE, O VENERES CUPIDINESQUE. Weep and wail, ye Cupids all, That are pretty and but small; Weep, ye pretty winged brothers, Weep, ye pretty goddess mothers; Every soul on earth that's pretty, Weep and wail for very pity. He is dead, the pretty sparrow, Darling of my “winsome marrow,” Dearer than her own eyes to her; For so well the creature knew her, She did not know her mother better; Not a moment would he quit her, Hopping hither, flitting thither, Ever blest while he was with her; Piping shrill and twittering clearly, To her alone whom he loved dearly. Now the dark way he is wending, Whence they say is no ascending. Ill luck be with thee, gloomy hollow, That every pretty thing dost swallow, To steal away my pretty sparrow! Alas! poor bird—oh, deed of sorrow! My sweet one's eyes, with tears so salt, Are red and swollen; 'tis all thy fault. SCHILLER'S TRANSLATION OF MACBETH. In Schiller's translation of Macbeth, in the 3rd Scene of the 1st Act, lines, of which the following are a free version, are substituted for the original Conference of the Weird Women, previous to the entrance of Macbeth and Banquo. It was manifestly the purpose of Schiller to discard the witch element altogether out of his “Weird Sisters,” and to raise them to a level with the Eumenides and Parcæ. As a modern poet, writing for time present, and probably for the time to come, he might be right in omitting the killing swine, the sailor's thumb, the chestnut munching; but his idea is not in the spirit of ancient or modern demonology. If Schiller showed a more refined taste, Shakspeare exhibits a wider knowledge and a deeper philosophy. First Witch. Sister, let's hear: what hast thou been doing? Second. On the sea I 've been busy at wrecking and ruin. Third. Sister, what thou? First. I saw a fisherman all in rags— A very heap of rags was he,— Yet he mended his nets and sang merrily, And cared no more how the old world wags, Than if he 'd the wealth of the sea in his bags. At his work late and early, The light-hearted churl, he Sang merrily, greeting the eve and the morn. I hated his mirth—'twas too much to be borne To see him so merry both early and late. I had sworn the deadly oath of hate, And his note must be changed or I forsworn. So the next time that his net he dragg'd, With a golden burden the full net swagg'd. 'Tis down on the nail the yellow ones glimmer; He gloats till his peepers wax dimmer and dimmer. He hugg'd the bright devil, he lugg'd it along, And there was an end of his mirth and his song; And then he lived like the Prodigal Son, And he gave to his lust dominion. But Mammon, the rogue, he soon was gone,— He fled with a lusty pinion. 'Twas faery gold, and he thought “All 's well;” He knew not—the fool!—'twas the loan of hell. And all was spent, and grim Want came; Away slunk the lads of the revel. Grace cast off him, and he cast off shame, And he gave himself up to the Devil. And he served the fiend with hand and will, And he went to and fro to pillage and kill. I chanced to pass this very day Where on the gold he lighted: On the bare beach I found him howling away, With wan looks scathed and blighted. And hark what said the hope-lorn elf:— “False witch, false ocean's daughter, Thou gavest me gold,—thou shalt have myself!” So plunged in the salt water. STATIUS, LIB. I.493. His chilly lips hard closing at the sight, His every member grueing with delight, At once by tokens manifest he spies That they are here, whom quaintly twisted plies And knots and labyrinths of oracular saw, Inspired by Phœbus, named his sons-in-law, In form of beasts foreshown. With palms outspread Towards the sky, in awful accent said The king illumined: Thou, whose compass dread And universal empire dost contain Both heaven and earth and all their woe and pain; Night, that transmittest stellar influence With manifold illapse to heal the sense Of weary mortals by a kind renewing, Till Titan bid them to be up and doing: At last in happy hour thou bring'st to me The truth long sought in sore perplexity,— Reveal'st the principles of Destiny. Aid but the work, and make the omen sure, From age to age thy rites shall still endure. Yon house shall honour thee, O reverend Night! With sable victims and drink-offerings white Of purest milk. The hallow'd flame shall sup The liquid gifts and eat the entrails up. Hail secret place, all hail thou seat divine, Mysterious symbol of the dreadful Trine! PÆAN OF ARIPHOON THE SICYONIAN. ?????? ????????? ??????? Holiest and first of all the happy powers, Sacred Hygeia! let me dwell with thee— For all the remnant of my living hours, Come thou, benign, and share my home with me; For if there be or good or grace In riches, offering, or high place Of godlike empery or delight, Which, in the hidden nets of Aphrodite, We would inveigle—aught at all That from the gods poor man obtains To soothe him in his toils and pains,— Blest Hygeia! at thy call Blossoms every pleasant thing: With thee the Graces spend their spring; But without thee No living thing can happy be. PROMETHEUS. A FRAGMENT. SCENE. —A desolate spot, supposed to lie beyond the limits of the habitable earth. Prometheus discovered chained to a rock. Soft Music is heard in the distance, which, as it gradually draws nearer, becomes graver and slower. Chorus of Sylphs on the wing, who enter singing as follows:— Lightly tripping o'er the land, Deftly skimming o'er the main, Scarce our fairy wings bedewing With the frothy mantling brine, Scarce our silver feet acquainting With the verdure-vested ground; Now like swallows o'er a river Gliding low with quivering pinion, Now aloft in ether sailing Leisurely as summer cloud; Rising now, anon descending, Swift and bright as shooting stars, Thus we travel glad and free. Deep in a wilderness of bloom, We felt the shaking of the air Blown o'er deserts vast and idle, O'er ambrosial fields of flowers, O'er many a league, where never man Imprest his footstep o'er the sand, Or shook the dry and husky seeds From the tall and feathery grass. But 'twas not the liquid voice Of warbling Nymphs their sea-love soothing, 'Twas not the billows of the breeze That tells when sister Sylphs are coming; Nay, 'twas a sound of terror and woe, A noise of force and striving: It was not the meeting of icebergs, Whose crash might out-thunder the thunderer, And their glare make the lightning look dim; It was not the storm of the secret ocean, That lashes the shore to the wild bear's howling; For the loud-throated tempests are silent with horror, And the sea stands still in amaze. 'Twas the piercing cry of immortal agony, That taught a strange tongue to the first unkind echoes Of this dull lump of earth, this joyless mountain. [Perceiving Prometheus. Oh, sight of fear! What shape is that, what goodly form divine, That in yon bare and storm-beleaguer'd rift Stands like a mark for sun and frosty wind By turns to waste their idle shafts upon? How horribly it glares! No sign of life, Save in the ghastly rolling of those eyes! Lives it, indeed? Or is the loathing spirit Pent in a corse, a gaol, a hulk of flesh, That is no more its own? Oh! do not look at it, Or we shall all grow like it. Let us hence,— Yet, hold! it breathes; methinks that I should know— Hark! did he stir? Oh, no, he cannot!—fast, Fast as a frozen sea, quite motionless! Though every sinew stares as he were bent To unfix the mountain from its rooted base, And whelm us with the ruins! Ah, poor wretch! The mountain shall as soon unfix itself As he wipe off the sweat-drop from his brow, Or make his bosom lighter by a sigh, He is so fast impaled. His noble limbs And spacious bulk, as tightly manacled As a fair gazelle in the serpent's coil, And every feature of his face grown stiff With the hard look of agony. Prometheus. Oh, me! Sylph. Behold, his teeth unlock, his black lips ope, As he would speak to us! Oh, thou sad spectacle! Prometheus. What now? Is aught forgotten? Hath the God, With his wise council, hatch'd some new device To plague the rebel? Is it not enough? Nay, be not slack; ye 're welcome:—sweet were a change, If but a change of tortures! But to grow A motionless rock, fast as my strong prison, Age after age, till circling suns outnumber The sands upon the tide-worn beach. No hope, Or that sad mockery of hope that fools With dull despair, spanning the infinite! Torment unmeasurable! Sylph. Alas! art thou The lofty-soul'd Prometheus? Prometheus. Ay! the fool That dared the wrath of Jove, hated of all That share his feasts and crouch before his throne; The mighty seer, the wise Prometheus. Ah, for himself not wise! Poor, poor weak slaves, Do ye not scorn me? But I cannot shake, Or ye might see how fearful I am grown, That nought have more to fear! Sylph. Oh, fear not us! A long, long way we come to visit thee; To this extreme of earth On clipping pinions borne. For the grating of fetters, The voice of upbraiding, The deep, earthly groan Of anguish half-stifled; The ear-piercing shriek Of pain in its sharpness,— A concert, all tuneless, came ruffling the rose-buds, Where sweetly we slumber'd the sultry hours; So with pinions unsmoothed, and tresses unbraided, Our bright feet unsandall'd, we leap'd on the air. Like the sound of the trumpet we shook the wide ether. A moment we quiver'd, then glancing on high, Ascended a sun-ray, light pillar of silver, And seem'd the gay spangles that danced in the beam. Soon in the cool and clear expanse Of upper air we sail'd, so fleet, so smooth, Our feathery oars we waved not, and that flight, Which left whole empires in its rear uncounted, As bubbles in the wake of some swift bark, Seem'd like a sleep of endless blessedness. Thus floating, we arrived At the last confines of the fair creation; Right o'er this spot unholy, Where tired Nature left her work half done. Oh, how unlike those happy fields of light Where late we voyaged! The thick, dark air, Still pressing earthward, closes o'er our heads With dull and leaden sound, like sleepy waters. Prometheus. Never till this day Did life disturb the dense eternity Of joyless quiet; never skylark's song, Or storm-bird's prescient scream, or eaglet's cry, Made vital the gross fog. The very light Is but an alien that can find no welcome; So horrible the silent solitude, That e'en those vile artificers of wrong, Brute instruments of ghastly cruelty, Whose grisly faces were too fell to dream of,— Even they seem'd comfortable when they turn'd Their backs upon me! Oh, too bitter shame, I could have wept to beg them tarry longer! Sylph. And didst thou weep? And did they leave thee thus? Oh, pitiless slaves! Prometheus. No, I did not weep. Fall'n as I am, I closed my eyelids hard; They burn'd like fire, and seem'd as they were full. But, no! the dew of tears was scorch'd away. I did not—sure they could not see me—weep. I bade them farewell, and my voice was firm: I think it made them tremble, for the sound Of their departure seem'd to shun my ear, As they had done some perilous deed in haste, And dared not look on it. They stole away: The patter of their feet still fretted me, Like drops in caves that evermore are ceasing, Yet never cease, so long they seem'd agoing. Methought 'twere joy to heave a groan unheard, Unmark'd of coward scorn. Nay, do not weep, Or I shall e'en heap shame upon my shame, And all that yet remains of god in me Be quench'd in tears. Alas, my gentle sprights! But now I wish'd to glide into a stream, And lose myself in ocean's liberty, Leaving my empty chains a monument And hollow trophy of the tyrant's rage; Or be a lump of ice which you might thaw With the kind warmth of sighs. And hard I strove To put away my immortality, Till my collected spirits swell'd my heart Almost to bursting; but the strife is past. It is a fearful thing to be a god, And, like a god, endure a mortal's pain; To be a show for earth and wondering heaven To gaze and shudder at! But I will live, That Jove may know there is a deathless soul Who ne'er will be his subject. Yes, 'tis past. The stedfast Fates confess my absolute will,— Their own co-equal. I have struggled long, And single-handed, with their triple power, And most opposing, still been most their slave. And yet, the will survived: Lord of itself; Free to disclaim the foreseen forced effect Of its free workings. Now, we are agreed, I and my destinies. The total world,— Above, below, whate'er is seen or known, And all that men, and all that gods enact, Hopes, fears, imaginations, purposes; With joy, and pain, and every pulse that beats In the great body of the universe, I give to the eternal sisterhood, To make my peace withal! And cast this husk, This hated, mangled, and dishonour'd carcase Into the balance; so have I redeem'd My power, birthright, even the changeless mind, The imperishable essence uncontroll'd. Sylph. Strange talk, Prometheus! Every scornful word, And every bitter boast, may add an age Of torture to thy doom. We would in truth That we might melt thy fetters with our sighs! But what we can, we will. Hold but thy peace; Or, if thou wilt forbid us, scoff, revile, But let us beg for thee. Our wilful prayer, By thee forbidden, leaves thy pride unstain'd, Thy will unmaster'd. He did love us once: The mighty Jove did love us. Did? He does. There is a spell of unresisted power In wonder-working weak simplicity, Because it is not fear'd. Prometheus. Fair creature, pause! I am not so ungentle as to chide The idle chirpings of imprison'd love, That warbles freely in its narrow cage; But I would bid the nightingale be dumb, Or ere her amorous descant should betray Her covert to the spoiler. Sylph. Spare thy fears; For we have winning wiles and sorceries, Such incantations as thy sterner wit Did never dream of. Time hath been ere now That Jove hath listen'd to our minstrelsy, Till wrath would seem to drop out of his soul Like a forgotten thing. Our smallest note, Catching his ear at any breathing space Amid his loudest threats, would make him mute As wondering childhood. True, the fault is great, But we are many that will plead for thee; We and our sisters, dwellers in the streams That murmur blithely to the joyous mood, And dolefully to sadness. Not a nook In darkest woods but some of us are there, To watch the flowers, that else would die unseen. And some there are that live among the wells Of hidden waters in the central earth, Or keep their state in caves where diamonds grow. And the soft amethyst and emerald Bask in the streamy and perpetual light Of that mysterious stone that owes the day No tribute for its lustre: in whose beam A thousand gems give out their thousand hues, As to their proper sun; not, as on earth, By art and toil enforced. Our sisters, they, The friendly sprites, to thee, I guess, well known, Who show the swains where treasured fountains lie; And those who used to guide thee in thy quest For the earth's riches, brass and valued gold. Prometheus. I well remember, for I know you all, Where'er ye sojourn, and whatever names Ye are or shall be called; fairies, or sylphs, Nymphs of the wood or mountain, flood or field: Live ye in peace, and long may ye be free To follow your good minds. Sylph. Ah, that we will! Are we not bold to bid a god repent; To break upon his slumbers with our prayers; To watch him day and night; to wear him out With endless supplication? Perhaps to beg His kind attention to a pleasant tale; To cheat him into pity, and conclude Each story with Prometheus? Prometheus. Bold and rash! Sylph. He shall not 'scape us. Not a hold secure In all his empire but our airy host Shall there prevent him. If in quaint disguise He roam the earth, or float adown the streams To tempt or Naiad's love, or woman's eye, Though watchful Juno were deceived, yet we Should know him still. Ha! then should be our time. Surprise him then, there 's nought he can refuse, Lest we expose him to the laughing sky, As Vulcan did the War-god. Yet no shape Of dreadful majesty, nor sacred haunt, Our close and passionate suit shall overawe; For he shall hear us in the vocal gloom Of green Dodona's leafy wilderness, And where from all apart he oft retires To brood upon his glory. Ours shall be The one request that he shall ever hear Till thou art pardon'd. Can he then be stern, When all the praise, the sweetness of his reign, The joy that he was glad to look upon, The boundless ether's fitful harmony, And the wild music of the ocean caves, Is turn'd to sighing and importunate grief For poor Prometheus? Prometheus. Gentle powers, forbear! 'Twere worse than all my former miseries Should my huge wreck suck down the friendly skiff That proffer'd aidance. Oh! that Jupiter Had hurl'd me to the deep of Erebus, Where neither god nor man might pity me. Where I might be unthought of as the star Last outpost of the bright celestial band, That walks its circuit of a thousand years, Shooting faint rays at black infinity. But now shall I become a common tale, A ruin'd fragment of a worn-out world; Unchanging record of unceasing change, Eternal landmark to the tide of time. Swift generations, that forget each other, Shall still keep up the memory of my shame Till I am grown an unbelievëd fable. Horsed upon hippogriffs, the hags of night Shall come to visit me; and once an age Some desperate wight, or wizard, gaunt and grey, Shall seek this spot by help of hidden lore, To ask of things forgotten or to come. But who, beholding me, shall dare defy The wrath of Jove? Since vain is wisdom's boast, And impotent the knowledge that o'erleaps The dusky bourne of time. 'Twere better far That gods should quaff their nectar merrily, And men sing out the day like grasshoppers, So may they haply lull the watchful thunder. Sylph. Ah, happy men, whose evil destiny, Self-baffled, falls! The fellest storm that blows, The soonest wafts them to an endless calm. Would we were mortal! Prometheus. Wherefore would ye so? What coy delight awakes to sun or stars But e'en a thought conveys you to the cradle Of its young sweetness? Sylph. True; but what delight Shall dare awake while all the spacious world Is anguish with the terror of thy pains, And sick for thy affliction? Prometheus. You, at least, Have nought to fear. Your unsubstantial forms Present no scope to the keen thunderbolt; Nor adamant can bind your subtle essence, Which is as fine as scent of violets, Quick as the warbled notes of melody, And unconfinable as thoughts of gods. Then go your way. Forget Prometheus, And all the woe that he is doom'd to bear; By his own choice this vile estate preferring To ignorant bliss and unfelt slavery. Sylph. Well, we will go, but never to forget Thee, nor omit thy cause. 'Tis vain to strive, For Jove is not one half so merciless As thou art to thyself. But fare thee well; Our love is all as stubborn as thy pride, And swift as firm. For ere yon full-orb'd moon, That now emerges from that dark confine, And, scaling slow the steep opposed heaven, Is red and swoln, assume her silvery veil And high career of virgin quietness, Shall we alight upon the topmost peak Of Jove's Olympus. Prometheus. Ye are free to go Where'er ye will, but not to plead for him Whom Jove abhors. No, not to pity him, Or ye may wish your errant range of wing Were narrow as the evening beetle's rounds. Sylph. Not free to pity! What were Jove himself If pity had not been? Was not he once A hapless babe, condemn'd to die ere born? But when he smiled, unweeting of his doom, And press'd his little hand on Rhea's bosom, Then gentle pity touch'd his mother's heart, Till very softness made her bold to brave The sternness of her hoary husband's ire. Oh, we have hung upon our motionless wings, And watch'd her bending sadly o'er his cradle, Shading his rosy face with her dark locks In such sweet stillness of o'ermaster'd sorrow, As if she fear'd a sigh might wake her bird, Or call his ruthless father to devour him. And when at length e'en love to love gave way, And she consented to resign her babe, To the kind nymph who promised to conceal him, With all a mother's tender fortitude, She wash'd the tear-drops from his fair round cheeks With rain from her own eyes; for she was melted, Yet nothing shaken. Pity made her firm. Yet when the Oread virgin turn'd away, And he, with baby cries, stretch'd out his arms Over her ivory shoulders, well I ween She would have given her godhead for a heart That might have broken. Then we sang our songs, And soothed her melancholy thoughts with tales How he should come to be a mighty god, And blast his foes with fiery thunderbolts. And day by day, in sunshine or in storm, We posted 'twixt far Ida and Olympus To bear her kisses to her growing babe, And bring back daily tidings of his weal. He was a lovely child, a boy divine; And joy'd to listen to the gurgling music Of Ida's many streams. We little thought That he would prove so stern and tyrannous. Prometheus. 'Tis ever so. Full many an innocent flower Is womb and cradle to a poisonous berry. Mark the cub lion, stolen from its dam, Loved playmate of the youngling foresters, Who laugh to see it shake its maneless neck, And lash with little tail, and beat the earth In angry sportiveness. Wait but awhile, That lion's roar, like the low thunder-groan, That rumbles under foot before an earthquake, Shall send an horrible silence o'er the waste, That every living thing shall send away, Like shadow'd clouds when sun and wind are striving. Sylph. And yet 'twas sweet to listen to his tales, And watch the strivings of the god within him. For all his prattle and his childishness Were godlike, full of hope and prophecy. And so he waxëd lusty, fair, and tall, And added sinew changed his baby flesh, That dimpled erst at every touch of love; And the loose ringlets of his silky hair Knotted in crisper curls. His deepening voice Told like a cavern'd oracle the fall Of sky-throned dynasties. He grew, and grew, A star-bright sign of fated empery; And all conspiring omens led him on To lofty purpose and pre-eminence. The mountain eagles, towering in their pride, Stoop'd at his beck and flock'd about his path, Like the small birds by wintry famine tamed; Or with their dusky and expansive wings Shaded and fann'd him as he slept at noon. The lightnings danced before him sportively, And shone innocuous as the pale cold moon In the clear blue of his celestial eye. Oft the nigh thunder-clap, o'er Ida's peak, Chiding the echoes that bemock'd it, paused, And with a low abasëd voice did homage To its predestined Lord. But more than all, With no ambiguous sign, the gifted Themis, Thy mother, O Prometheus! pointed out The very spot—a lovely spot it was, Untrodden then, and wild, without a sound, Save old Æsopus and his lovely song, Where the glad sons of the deliver'd earth Shall yearly raise the multitudinous voice, Hymning great Jove, the God of Liberty! Then he grew proud, yet gentle in his pride, And full of tears, which well became his youth, As showers do spring. For he was quickly moved, And joy'd to hear sad stories that we told Of what we saw on earth, of death and woe, And all the waste of time. Then would he swear That he would conquer time; that in his reign It never should be winter; he would have No pain, no growing old, no death at all. And that the pretty damsels, whom we said He must not love, for they would die and leave him, Should evermore be young and beautiful; Or, if they must go, they should come again, Like as the flowers did. Thus he used to prate, Till we almost believed him. Oft at eve We sang the glories of the coming age, And oft surprised the wanderer in the woods With bodements sweet of immortality. Prometheus. Aye, ye were blest with folly. Who may tell What strange conceits upon the earth were sown And gender'd by the fond garrulity Of your aëreal music? Scatter'd notes, Half heard, half fancied by the erring sense Of man, on which they fell like downy seeds Sown by autumnal winds, grew up, and teem'd With plenteous madness. Legends marvellous Of golden ages past, and dreams as wild, As sweetly wild, of that auspicious birth, That glorious advent of delight unfading, Which brooks, and vesper gales, and all divine Mysterious melodies, in sleep or trance, Or lonely musing heard, to that blind race So oft announced. Vain phantasies and hopes, That shall be hopes for aye, from sire to son Descending; chaunted in a hundred tongues By errant minstrels borne from land to land, And in the storm-bewilder'd bark convey'd To furthest isles, where yet unheard of man The surges roar around. The various tribes, Condemn'd alike to ever-present woe, With various phantoms of futurity Shall soothe their weary hour. Beneath the wain Of slow Bootes, where a mimic moon, Like fiery ensign of a spiritual host, Flick'ring and rustling, streams along the sky; Where the black pine-woods splinter in the blast That rides tempestuous o'er a wilderness Of ancient snow, whose ineffectual gleam Thwarts the pale darkness of the long long night, And Ocean, slumbering in his icy bed, Hears not the shrill alarum of the storm. There Scalds uncouth, in horrid accents screaming, To clash of arms and outcries terrible, Tuning their song, shall tell of shadowy realms Where the brave dead, the mighty of old time, Urge the fierce hunt, the bloody banquet share, And drink deep draught nectareous from the skulls Of slaughter'd foes. But, in the perfumed groves, Of the soft, languid, dreaming Orient, And where, 'mid billowy sands, in the broad eye Of an unprofitable, dewless heaven, The lonely phœnix roams, shall hoary seers And pensive shepherds, to believing maids And meekest mothers, when their babes are hush'd, Repeat the cherish'd tale at eventide, Of a new world where peace shall ever dwell. No armed hoof shall crush the daisy bold That flaunts it in the sun, nor ambush'd foe Invade the lurking violet in her bower, Where beauty fades not, love is ever true, And life immortal like a summer day. Oh! happy creatures that, uncursed with love, Look for a land they know not where, but deem It may be girdled by the burning waste, Or safely treasured in the secret ocean; Or, haply, in the moon, where they shall live Beneath the sole and everlasting sway Of him, the babe benign, mighty and wise, Whose might and wisdom are but innocence And childish simpleness. Thrice happy they Who ne'er have found and never can believe That innocence is mere defect of might— Simplicity the very craft of Nature, To hide the piteous void of ignorance, Till guile is grown of age. Too soon 'tis seen The great are ever best when least themselves. The weakest wind that wantons with your curls, Grown strong would be a scouring hurricane. Sylph. Alas! thy words are like this spot, unholy. Thou could'st not speak them in a better place. Prometheus. What place so holy where they are not true? Ye see no tumult in the host of stars, No taint of falsehood in the clear blue sky. Yet there was ancient Uranus enthroned And treason impious, foul, unnatural, O'erwhelm'd his stellar and primeval seat With horror and with shame. Sylph. And pleasant hills were those Where the vast brood of Titan used to dwell, Bathing their golden locks in morning light, And sunn'd with even's latest, sweetest smile— Her parting smile that bids the earth adieu. Where are they gone, that giant brotherhood, Lords of the mountains? Past like clouds away, And seen no more—save when their misty shades, Among the lonely peaks they loved so well, Far off beheld, astound the mountaineer. Prometheus. Ay, they are gone; and he that holds their place Is like them, strong and blind. What wonder, then, Though he fall mightily? Sylph. The tale is told Of Uranus and old Hyperion, And that great mother: huge and sluggish powers That just awoke from their eternal sleep To gaze upon the new and vacant world, Then sank to sleep again. And glad were we When Saturn and his howling train were sent To fright their slumbers in the nether void. But must the youthful thunder-wielder fall, For whom we sung the song of victory? Fall from his high, his unapproached throne, Which never god may touch, nor mortal eye Pierce through the veil of congregated clouds, That wave on wave, a dark and soundless sea, Beneath it ebb and flow? Thus islanded, It hangs enshrined in clear and crystal air, And owns no kindred with the lower orb. Oft have we seen that solitary height, As gay we glanced athwart the sunny beam, And wash'd our pinions in the unfall'n dew, And thought no peril and no change were there. Prometheus. 'Tis a fair spot, and holy. I have known, When Rhea's boy hath wonder'd what it was, That other silver star that staid behind, When Phosphor left the sky. Yet now he deems His godhead as the light immutable, That cares not whether it be morn or even. Sylph. There is a dark foreboding in thy speech; Thine eyes flash fearfully a moody joy That argues a new downfall. Whence arise These desperate hopes, that seem to make thee fond Of lowest misery? Prometheus. I know it all— All ye would ask. But ne'er shall hope be mine Till the dread secret works its fatal will In daylight visible, with wrath and scorn, And ceaseless memory of forgotten things. Then Jove shall learn what all his sulphurous bolts, Soul-piercing torments, earthquakes, fiery plagues, Disease, and hateful, black deformity, And all confounding shame, shall ne'er persuade My voice to utter. CONCLUSION. Ye patient fields, rejoice! The blessing that ye pray for silently Is come at last; for ye shall no more fade, Nor see your flow'rets droop like famishing babes Upon your comfortless breasts. Close, pent-up woods! Open your secrets to the prying sun; For den nor forest dark shall longer hide The noisome thing. Take heart, poor flutterer! Nor fear the glitter of the serpent's eye: No more it shines to harm thee. Sing aloud, Toss high the shrillness of thy gurgling throat, And wake the silence of Olympian bowers, That Jove may hear thee—he, the lovely boy, The son of Saturn, mightier than his sire, And gentler far. Thou hollow earth! resound, And, like the maddening drum of Cybele, Roll with delight thro' all thy sparry caves A many-echoed peal. And, oh! ye soft And wandering elements—ye sighing floods— And thou, great treasury of light and music— Embracing air with all your wealth of sounds, And bodiless hues, and shadows glorified, Of what on earth is terrible and fair The fairer effluence and the living form, With all your music, loud and lustily, With every dainty joy of sight and smell, Prepare a banquet meet to entertain The Lord of Thunder, that hath set you free From old oppression. Melancholy brook! That creep'st along so dull and drowsily, Wailing and waiting in the lazy noon, In merry madness roar, and whirl, and bound, Blithe as thy mountain sisters. Ne'er again Shall summer drought, or icy manacle, Obstruct thy tuneful liberty. Thou breeze, That mak'st an organ of the mighty sea, Obedient to thy wilful phantasies, Provoke him not to scorn; but soft and low, As pious maid awakes her aged sire, On tiptoe stealing, whisper in his ear The tidings of the young god's victory. Then shall he rouse him on his rocky bed, And join the universal hymn with strains Of solemn thankfulness and deep delight— The blended sweetness of a thousand waves. But where is he, the voice intelligent Of Nature's minstrelsy? Oh, where is man— That mortal god, that hath no mortal kin Or like on earth? Shall Nature's orator— The interpreter of all her mystic strains— Shall he be mute in Nature's jubilee? Wilt thou be last in bliss and benison That wast the first in lamentable wail, And sole in conscious pain? Haply he fears The bitter doom, that out of sweetness makes Its sad memorial. Mortal! fear no more,— The reign is past of ancient violence; And Jove hath sworn that time shall not deface, Nor death destroy, nor mutability Perplex the truth of love. SKETCHES OF ENGLISH POETS. IN RHYMES. CHAUCER. How wayward oft appears the poet's fate, Who still is born too early or too late. If a bold, fond, imaginative age, Instinct with amorous, or with martial rage, Enact more wonders than the mind conceives, And all that fancy can devise believes,— If such an age behold a bard, whose sight Looks on earth's objects by a heaven-born light, Skill'd to pourtray each lineament of nature, And shed purpureal grace on every feature, The fleeting language, to its trust untrue, Vext by the jarring claims of old and new, Defeats his beauty, makes his sense the fee Of a blind, guessing, blundering glossary. Thus Chaucer, quaintly clad in antique guise, With unfamiliar mien scares modern eyes. No doubt he well invented—nobly felt— But then, O Lord! how monstrously he spelt. His syllables perplex our critic men, Who try in vain to find exactly ten; And waste much learning to reduce his songs To modish measurement of shorts and longs. His language, too, unpolish'd and unfixt, Of Norman, Saxon, Latin, oddly mixt— Such words might please th' uneducated ears That hail'd the blaring trumpets of Poictiers. They shared the sable Edward's glee and glory, And, like his conquests, they were transitory. Then how shall such unpolish'd lingo cope With polish'd elegance and Mister Pope? Yet, ancient Bard! let not our judgment wrong Thy rich, spontaneous, many-colour'd song; True mirror of a bold, ambitious age, In passion furious, in reflection sage!— An age of gorgeous sights and famous deeds, And virtue more than peace admits or needs; When shiver'd lances were our ladies' sport, And love itself assumed a lofty port; When every beast, and bird, and flower, and tree, Convey'd a meaning and a mystery; And men in all degrees, sorts, ranks, and trades, Knights, Palmers, Scholars, Wives, devoted Maids, In garb, and speech, and manners, stood confest To outward view, by hues and signs exprest, And told their state and calling by their vest. SPENSER. Sweet was the youth of virgin Poesy, That virgin sweetness which she gave to thee, My Spenser, bard of happy innocence! For thou didst with a bridegroom's love intense Caress the fair inventions of thy brain, Those babes of paradise, without the pain Of mortal birth, to fairest heritage Born in the freshness of their perfect age. Thy Faery Knight had all the world in fee, For all the world was Faeryland to thee. Thine is no tale, once acted, then forgot; Thy creatures never were, and never will be not. Oh! look not for them in the dark abyss Where all things have been, and where nothing is— The spectral past;—nor in the troubled sea Where all strange fancies are about to be— The unabiding present. Seek them where For ever lives the Good, the True, the Fair, In the eternal silence of the heart. There Spenser found them; thence his magic art Their shades evoked in feature, form, and limb, Real as a human self, and bright as cherubim. And what though wistful love and emulous arms, And all the wizard might of mutter'd charms,— Though slimy snakes disgorge their loathly rage, And monstrous phantoms wait on Archimage: These are but dreams, that come, and go, and peep Through the thin curtain of a morning sleep, And leave no pressure on the soul, that wakes And hails the glad creation that it makes. SHAKESPEARE. Shakespeare, what art thou? Could'st thou rise again To praise thyself, thy praise were old and vain; Thy highest flight would sink beneath thy due; Thy own invention would find nothing new. In the whole orb of nature that thou art, Complete in essence, and distinct in part; No theme, no topic, and no simile, But busy men have stolen in praise of thee. Then let thy cumbrous crities keep their shelves; We find thy truest comment in ourselves. In thee our thoughts find utterance, and combine Their airy substance with those thoughts of thine. By thee our feelings all are judged, acquitted, Reproved, condemn'd, with seemly action fitted. What chance, or change, affection, or the faith Of hope and fear, the benison or scathe Of Fortune infinite can make of man,— What man has been since first the world began, Thou well hast shown. One task alone remains, One great adventure for succeeding brains; The golden branch upon the mystic tree, Unpluck'd, to show—man as he ought to be. DRAYTON. Hail to thee, Drayton! true, pains-taking wight, So various that 'tis hard to praise thee right; For driest fact and finest faery fable Employ'd thy genius indefatigable. What bard more zealous of our England's glory, More deeply versed in all her antique story, Recorded feat, tradition quaint and hoary? What muse like thine so patiently would plod From shire to shire in pilgrim sandal shod, Calling to life and voice, and conscious will, The shifting streamlet and the sluggish hill? Great genealogist of earth and water, The very Plutarch of insensate matter. DONNE. Brief was the reign of pure poetic truth; A race of thinkers next, with rhymes uncouth, And fancies fashion'd in laborious brains, Made verses heavy as o'erloaded wains. Love was their theme, but love that dwelt in stones, Or charm'd the stars in their concentric zones; Love that did first the nuptial bond conclude 'Twixt immaterial form and matter rude; Love that was riddled, sphered, transacted, spelt, Sublimed, projected, everything but felt. Or if in age, in orders, or the cholic, They damn'd all loving as a heathen frolic; They changed their topic, but in style the same, Adored their Maker as they would their dame. Thus Donne, not first, but greatest of the line, Of stubborn thoughts a garland thought to twine; To his fair maid brought cabalistic posies, And sung quaint ditties of metempsychosis; Twists iron pokers into true love-knots, Coining hard words, not found in polyglots. DANIEL. Not such was Daniel, gentle, bland, and good, The wisest monitor of womanhood; Plain morals utter'd in plain mother tongue, And flat historic facts he plainly sung. And yet by earnest faith bestow'd a grace On bald event and ancient common-place. The oldest truths to him were ever new; No wonder, for he always felt them true. The bootless battles of the red and white, Which few can read, he patiently could write. DRYDEN. Then Dryden came, a mind of giant mould, Like the north wind, impetuous, keen, and cold; Born to effect what Waller but essay'd, In rank and file his numbers he array'd, Compact as troops exact in battle's trade. Firm by constraint, and regularly strong, His vigorous lines resistless march along, By martial music order'd and inspired, Like glowing wheels by their own motion fired. So as a nation long inured to arms, And stirring strains, fierce pleasures, brisk alarms, Disdains a calm, and can no longer bear A soft, a pensive, or a solemn air; Thus Dryden taught the English to despise The simply sweet, long-lingering melodies That lovely Spenser and his thoughtful peers Had warbled erst to rapt attentive ears. E'en Milton's billowy ocean of high sound, Delighted little, though it might astound; The restless crowd impatient turn'd away, And sought a shorter, shriller, lighter lay. Yet Dryden nobly earn'd the poet's name, And won new honours from the gift of fame. His life was long, and when his head was grey, His fortune broken, and usurp'd his bay, His dauntless genius own'd no cold dismay; Nor in repining notes of vain regret He made his crack'd pipe pitifully fret. But when cashier'd and laid upon the shelf, To shame the court excell'd his former self, Who meant to clip, but imp'd his moulted wings, And cured him of his ancient itch of praising kings. He sat gigantic on the shore of time, And watch'd the ingress of encroaching slime, Nor dream'd how much of evil or of good Might work amid the far unfathom'd flood. DRYDEN'S SUCCESSORS. Sad were the times in Dryden's latter day, He saw all genius but his own decay; Poor Otway starved, and Lee in misery dead, The laurel torn from his own hoary head, Like a frail father, he was doom'd to trace His vices only in his spurious race; For many a rhymer claim'd him for a sire, With all his soot and less than half his fire. Their boast to reconcile—a vain pretence— The old antipathy of wit and sense. To write in rhyme as men might write in prose, And win the frigid praise of critic beaux. But though their general theme was worldly man, Small was their skill the living heart to scan; Their fancy little and their wisdom less, No inward truth their flippant lines express; No image to the inward eye convey, Reveal no secret impulse to the day. Action or passion there were seldom found, Or the sweet magic of heart-stirring sound. Smooth was their verse indeed; their turns were nice, Quick, neat, exact, as if they moved on ice; They skimm'd the surface of the chilling town, And sought from courts and clubs a brief renown. PARNELL. A gentle wit was pure, polite Parnell, By many praised, for many loved him well. His muse glides on “with gentle swimming walk,” And e'en while singing only seems to talk. In fact she is an English gentlewoman, Whom no one would believe a thing uncommon, Till by experience taught, we find how rare Such truly English gentlewomen are. SWIFT. First in the list behold the caustic Dean, Whose muse was like himself compact of spleen; Whose sport was ireful, and whose laugh severe, His very kindness cutting, cold, austere. YOUNG AND HIS CONTEMPORARIES. 'Tis sad to think, of all the names that strive For immortality, how few survive; How many leave preferment's open ways, Smit by the love of hard-earn'd, barren praise, Defying poverty, and worldly blame, And self-reproach, to win the puff of fame; Unhappy breathe, and unregarded rot, First starved to death, and soon as dead forgot. Eternal laurels shall the bust entwine Of Young at once a poet and divine. And Gray, while Windsor's antique towers shall stand, Or spring revisit Britain's favour'd strand; While those old bards whose praise he sung so well Shall keep their place in memory's haunted cell; While the green churchyard and the hallow'd tower Attract your steps at eve's soft, solemn hour; As long as men can read, or boys recite, As long as critics sneer, and bards endite, And lavish lords shall print their jingling stuff, 'Mid ample margin, leaving verge enough; So long shall Gray, and all he said and sung, Tang the shrill accents of the school-girl's tongue; So long his Ode, his Elegy, his Bard, By lisping prodigies be drawl'd and marr'd. For Littelton, he gain'd the name of poet; But, made a lord, might easily forego it. West tried to soar on Pindar's ample pinion, And bring his strains beneath our king's dominion. All praise to him for what he well intended; Of his success least said the soonest mended. Moore, Cawthorne, Cunningham, and Brown and Green, Not much remember'd nor forgotten clean, Of Britain's poets swell the lengthy list, Scarce mark'd if present, nor if absent miss'd. Boyce, sad example of the poet's lot, His faults remember'd and his verse forgot, From cold contempt a morsel doom'd to crave, And owe to public charity a grave. In want's worst miseries ran his woeful race, And all his fame was but proclaim'd disgrace. Peace to his dust, and may his ashes soar Where mortal frailty shall beset no more; Where want shall never tempt to deeds of shame, And Heaven's pure light shall cleanse the tainted name! Churchill, by want and rage impell'd to write, Whose muse was anger, and whose genius spite, With satire meant to stab, and not to heal, The morbid, bloated, feverish commonweal; Too proud to yield to humble virtue's rule, Smote half the world with reckless ridicule. Wit, honour, sense, to him did Heaven impart, But not that last, best gift, a pious heart. He blazed awhile in fortune, fame, and pride, But unrespected lived, untimely died. But gentler Goldsmith, whom no man could hate, Beloved by Heaven, pursued by wayward fate, Whose verse shall live in every British mind, Though sweet, yet strong; though nervous, yet refined;— A motley part he play'd in life's gay scene, The dupe of vanity and wayward spleen; Aping the world, a strange fantastic elf; Great, generous, noble, when he was himself. Grainger possess'd a true poetic vein, But why waste numbers on a Sugar-cane? Say, Doctor, why, since those who only need Thy blank instructions, sure will never read? Cooper essay'd a vein to England new, To be the poet of refined virtù. His muse, half French, half English, trips away, A nymph presentable, though rather gay, Brought up at Paris, and not half at ease Where British morals hold their strict decrees. But ill the gentleman supports his claim To Gresset's wit or old Anacreon's name. Smollett and Armstrong, both of Pæan's band, Compatriot offspring of a thoughtful land, A land severe, whose mettle yet unbroke. Toils in the team, and yet disdains the yoke. In mind Athenian, but in spirit still The land of Wallace wight, and Christie's Will. See Minstrelsy of the Scottish Border, vol. III., p. 105. Second Edition. Such then was Scotland, nor could learning, art, Or finest genius quite subdue that heart. So neither keenest sense nor soundest morals Could keep her brightest sons from needless quarrels. And oft't would seem her literary men Reluctant changed the claymore for the pen. Scots were they both by temper as by birth, And both were racy of their native earth; But pensive Armstrong, though he heir'd a name For bloody deeds of old bequeath'd to fame, On Liddal's banks renown'd and sands of Drife, Was yet almost too indolent for strife. And little of the Scot was in him seen, Save now and then a passing fit of spleen. And sure the man of whom our Thomson sung (Thomson a Scot in nothing but his tongue) In such a gentle strain of kind reproof, As could be dictated by nought but love, Could not be other than a kindly soul, Who oft forgot the doctor o'er a bowl; And when he spied the humming, sparkling cream Of bright champagne, or snuff'd of punch the steam, Even as a poet would forget his theme. Yet in his graver mood he lectured well On ills which haply oft himself befell. And with small practice, but with some small wealth, He turn'd to stately verse the Art of Health; And justly earn'd a lofty place among The masters of the blank didactic song. Correct his judgment, he knew where to stop, And smells by no means often of the shop. Yea, though a learn'd disciple of St. Luke, He never once alludes to purge or puke; Nor with hard words of most portentous omen Describes the thorax, pelvis, or abdomen. WILKIE, DODSLEY, &amp;c. Wilkie, the Scottish Homer, so 'tis said; I will not censure what I never read. Had Homer been a chief of merry Tweeddale, And had his trumpet been an old Scotch fiddle, His Pegasus a shuffling Scotland pad, He then had wrote the Epigoniad. Good Dodsley, honest, bustling, hearty soul, A footman, verse-man, prose-man, bibliopole; A menial first beneath a lady's roof, Then Mercury to guttling Dartineuf, His humble education soon complete, He learnt good things to write, good things to eat. Then boldly enter'd on the buskin'd stage, And show'd how toys may help to make us sage: Nay, dared to bite the great with satire's tooth, And made a Miller tell his King the truth. In tragic strain he told Cleone's woes, The touching sorrows and the madd'ning throes Of a fond mother and a faithful wife. He wrote “The Economy of Human Life.” For flights didactic then his lyre he strung, Made rhymes on Preaching, and blank verse on Dung; Anon with soaring weary, much at his ease, Wrote Epigrams, and Compliments, and Kisses. All styles he tried, the tragic, comic, lyric, The grave didactic and the keen satiric; Now preach'd and taught as sober as a dominie, Now went pindaric-mad about Melpomene; Now tried the pastoral pipe and oaten stop, Yet all the while neglected not his shop. Fair be his fame, among a knavish clan His noblest title was an honest man. A bookseller, he robb'd no bard of pelf, No bard he libell'd, though a bard himself. Far other fate was thine, unhappy Kit, Christopher Smart, born April 11, 1722; died May 21, 1773. Luckless adventurer in the trade of wit. A bitter cup was offer'd to thy lip, Drugg'd with the wants and woes of authorship. Untimely thrust upon this mortal stage, No childish pastime could thy thoughts engage. Books were thy playmates. In a happy dream Thy hours unmark'd would glide along the stream Of fancies numberless, and sweet, and fair; Link'd like the notes of some voluptuous air, For ever varying as the hues that deck With changeful loveliness the ring-dove's neck. Still rising, flitting, melting, blending, For ever passing, and yet never ending. Sweet life were this, if life might pass away Like the soft numbers of a warbled lay; Were man not doom'd to carefulness and toil, A magic lamp with unconsuming oil. Truth is a lesson of another school, And duty sways us with a stricter rule. The stream of life awhile that smoothest flows, 'Ere long is hurried down the stream of woes, Or, lost in swamps of penury and shame, Leaves the foul vapour of a tainted name. Like fate, or worse, poor Cuthbert, Cuthbert Shaw, born 1738 or 1739; died September 1, 1771. made thy life A woful monument to thy dead wife. With her of virtue and of hope bereft, Thou and thy passions in the world wert left. True, thou hast sweetly mourn'd thy youthful bride, But well it were if thou with her hadst died. For Langhorne, Reverend let him still continue, Although his mind had very little sinew. 'Twas his to ape our reverend ancient lays With mincing prettiness of modern phrase, As some fine ladies mimic in their dress The simple finery of a shepherdess; And shape their silks and muslins to the cut That decks the dwellers of the mud-built hut. SONNETS AND OTHER SHORT POEMS ON SCRIPTURAL AND RELIGIOUS SUBJECTS. THE BIBLE. How very good is God! that he hath taught To every Christian that can hear and see Both what he is and what he ought to be, And how and why the saints of old have fought. Whate'er of truth the antique sages sought, And could but guess of his benign decree, Is given to Faith affectionate and free, Not wrung by force of self-confounding thought. How many generations had gone by 'Twixt suffering Job and boding Malachi! 'Twixt Malachi and Paul—how mute a pause! Is the book finish'd? May not God once more Send forth a prophet to proclaim his laws In holy words not framed by human lore? THE LITURGY. Oft as I hear the Apostolic voice Speaking to God, I blame my heart so cold That with those words, so good, so pure, and old, Cannot repent nor hope, far less rejoice. Yet am I glad, that not the vagrant choice, Chance child of impulse, timid, or too bold, The volume of the heart may dare unfold With figured rhetoric, or unmeaning noise. Praying for all in those appointed phrases, Like a vast river, from a thousand fountains, Swoll'n with the waters of the lakes and mountains, The pastor bears along the prayers and praises Of many souls in channel well defined, Yet leaves no drop of prayer or praise behind. THE JUST SHALL LIVE BY FAITH. “The just shall live by faith,”—and why? That faith By which they live is all that makes them just, The sole antagonist to the inborn lust And malice that subjects them to the death Which Adam earn'd, Cain, Abel suffer'd, Seth Bequeath'd to all his progeny; who must Suffer the primal doom of dust to dust, And for uncertain respite hold their breath. Think not the faith by which the just shall live Is a dead creed, a map correct of heaven, Far less a feeling fond and fugitive, A thoughtless gift, withdrawn as soon as given. It is an affirmation and an act That bids eternal truth be present fact. BELIEVE AND PRAY. Believe and pray. Who can believe and pray Shall never fail nor falter, though the fate Of his abode, or geniture, or date, With charms beguile or threats obstruct his way. For free is faith and potent to obey, And love content in patient prayer to wait, Like the poor cripple at the Beautiful Gate, Shall be relieved on some miraculous day. Lord, I believe!—Lord, help mine unbelief! If I could pray, I know that thou would'st hear; Well were it though my faith were only grief, And I could pray but with a contrite tear. But none can pray whose wish is not thy will, And none believe who are not with thee still. SETH. Sad was the Mother of Mankind to see The sad fulfilment of the primitive curse; The gentle babe she was so fond to nurse, Her duteous Abel, that would clasp her knee, So meekly heark'ning to the history Of the sweet hours his parents pass'd, before They learn'd of good and ill the fatal lore, Or pluck'd the fruit of that forbidden tree.— What is he now? A helpless lump of earth! Nay, thou poor Mother, do not so distrust The Lord, that raised thy husband from the dust, For he shall give to thee another birth, A holy babe, whose seed shall save his brother, And give back Abel to their common Mother. ENOCH. He walk'd with God, and like the breath of prayer, His earthly substance melted all away; So much he loved the Lord, his mortal clay Abolish'd quite, or blent with pervious air, Soft as a rainbow, mix'd with things that were And are not. Surely God did love him well, And he loved God so much, he would not dwell Where God was not. The world was blank and bare; He was most wretched, for he could not love. But the good Lord took pity on his woe: For woe it is, with all the heart above, To walk a heartless corpse on earth below. He faded from the earth, and was unseen; A thought of God was all that he had been. ABRAHAM. When Abram was a boy the years were long, As ours might be, did we for every hour Extract the good and realise the power, And train the notes to everlasting song. And Abram was a comely youth, and strong, And nimbly 'mid the silky reeds he trod, When he resolved—“the Lord shall be my God,” And knew the only God can do no wrong. Had he not felt that God is God alone, As holy, as almighty, and all-seeing,— Foul were his sin, that would with blood atone, And court the favour of unselfish Being. But long experience taught him God was true, And could the life he took by grace renew. HAGAR. Lone in the wilderness, her child and she, Sits the dark beauty, and her fierce-eyed boy; A heavy burden, and no winsome toy To such as her, a hanging babe must be. A slave without a master—wild, not free, With anger in her heart! and in her face Shame for foul wrong and undeserved disgrace, Poor Hagar mourns her lost virginity! Poor woman, fear not—God is everywhere; Thy silent tears, thy thirsty infant's moan, Are known to Him, whose never-absent care Still wakes to make all hearts and souls his own; He sends an angel from beneath his throne To cheer the outcast in the desert bare. ISAAC AND REBEKAH. The child of promise, spared by God's command, He grew and ripen'd, till his noon of life, As days were then, deserved and claim'd a wife; But she must be no toy of faithless land; So the good steward o'er the thirsty sand His prescient camels follows to the well, Where the sweet daughter of old Bethuel Supplies his need with white and courteous hand. And oh! what meeter than a maid so fair To be the answer to that good man's prayer? And then how sweetly did the Spirit move her, Without a word of maidenly delay, Or coy petition for a farewell day, To quit her home, and seek an unseen lover! LEAH. Most patient of all women, unbeloved, Yet ever toiling for thy husband's grace, Methinks I see thee, with thy downcast face, Pondering on tasks that should not be reproved. For seven long years their tents were not removed, And Leah work'd for Jacob all the while, And yet she hardly got a sullen smile,— So good a wife, and mother duly proved. Yet sore it must have been to see her mate Rising at morn to work, and working late, And know he work'd so hard to get another; And yet she bore it all, in hope to be, What her sweet offspring was, by God's decree, The better Eve, the second Adam's mother. MOSES IN THE BULRUSHES. She left her babe, and went away to weep, And listen'd oft to hear if he did cry; But the great river sung his lullaby, And unseen angels fann'd his balmy sleep. And yet his innocence itself might keep; The sacred silence of his slumb'rous smile Makes peace in all the monster-breeding Nile; For God e'en now is moving in the sweep Of mighty waters. Little dreams the maid, The royal maid, that comes to woo the wave With her smooth limbs beneath the trembling shade Of silver-chaliced lotus, what a child Her freak of pity is ordain'd to save! How terrible the thing that looks so mild! Oct. 6, 1836. ON A PICTURE OF JEPHTHAH AND HIS DAUGHTER. BY STROZZI. IN THE POSSESSION OF J. BRANKER, ESQ. I. 'Tis true the painter's hand can but arrest The moment that in Nature never stays, But fleets impatient of the baffled gaze. Yet if that single moment be the best Of many years, commission'd to attest The excellence, whose beauty ne'er decays, Let not the mute art lack a rightful praise, That shows the lovely ever loveliest: And thou, sweet maid! for ever keep that look: Thou never hadst so sweet a look till now. Read in thy father's face, as in a book, Thy virgin doom, the irrevocable vow. Well were it if thy father ne'er had shook Away the doubt that hangs upon his brow. II. IN CONTINUATION. What if the angry God hath made thy arm Dread as the thunderbolt or solid fire, Or pest obedient to his vengeful ire, Think'st thou thy oath was like a wizard's charm, Or hadst thou need, with proffer'd blood, to farm Jehovah's might? It proves thy faith unsure, Thy creed idolatrous, thy heart impure; Thy god a greedy trafficker in harm, Not Israel's hope. But she, thy daughter, mild, Whose eager love and over-hasty greeting, Has made thee murderer of thy blameless child, Loves not the less for that unhappy greeting;— Guiltless she dies, to save thee from the guilt Which must be thine, though her pure blood be spilt. RUTH. Many and fierce the battles that the sons Of Jacob fought for their predestined land, And often for their wives and little ones With blood they stain'd the wilderness of sand; A tale of bloodshed is their history, And to all Christian hearts a mystery. But in the bleakest wild is sometimes seen A grove of palms beside an oozy spring; There way-worn pilgrims bless the spot of green, And the weak bird lets drop her weary wing: Such, in the wild and waste of Bible truth, Is the sweet story of the faithful Ruth. RIZPAH. Blood will have blood. Here is a grievous pest, And Gibeon craves the blood of guilty Saul. And what can David do? He gives not all— One he reserves, to death resigns the rest. Poor Rizpah, mother of a brood unbless'd, Must see Amoni and Mephibosheth For Israel's life to ignominious death, Because their sire so fatally transgress'd, Consign'd tho' guiltless. She, sad mother, staid On her stern seat of sackcloth day by day, And, like a statue, scared the fowls away, 'Till genial rain the thirst of earth allay'd. Patient in grief, she won the historic Spirit, To make immortal mention of her merit. SOLOMON. Then Solomon sat on the throne as king; So had his sire appointed:—great and least, Hebrew and Stranger, warrior chief and priest, With one glad shout make air, earth, rock to ring. Ah! sons of Abraham, is it such a thing That your old monarch is so nigh deceased? And ye must blow your horns, as if the feast Of the ripe harvest and the hopeful spring Fell on one day. 'Tis well the old man dies. The sweetest string in all the holy lyre Cracks when the old man heaves his latest sighs, And with his breath the highest tones expire. Ten thousand minstrels play for Solomon— What are they all, if David be not one? ELIJAH. A little cake he ask'd for, that was all; And that she gave—'twas all she had to give To the poor hungry Prophet fugitive; Not knowing quite, she yet believed the call, And she was blest. Within her cottage wall, By day the Prophet prays, at night he lies, Whose prayer and presence daily multiplies The meat and cruse that, let what will befal, Shall still suffice for each successive day. She gave a little, and she gave enough, And taught us how to use the passive stuff That earth affords,—to give and still to pray. Hope be the Prophet, and the cruse Content! Where Hope abides the cruse shall ne'er be spent. THE JEWISH CAPTIVES. By the smooth streams of haughty Babylon The Jewish Captives sat them down and wept,— Wept for their king, their country, and their home. Jerusalem's remembrance, duly kept, Shadow'd the aspect of a beauteous land, Darken'd the sun, and ruffled the soft waves; But chiefly sorrow'd the unhappy band At the rude taunts of unbelieving slaves. “Sing us a song!” cried they, “a song of mirth!” How could they plume the wing and soar on high, Forgetful of their sorrow's recent birth, The dread fulfilment of each prophecy? Ah no! Jerusalem, they remember'd thee, And could not touch the harp in thy adversity. EZRA, III., 11—13. Hark! what a shout! Alas! it sounds but thin, Though the sad remnant like one man unite, And the lorn widow brings her widow's mite. Few are the tribes, and feeble is their din, Subdued with memory of ancestral sin, Opprest with conscience of a guilty fear And faint distrust, and hope but half sincere, That asks the end before they well begin The holy renovation. Drear the tone Of joyous hymns in trembling accents piped; And faces stain'd with selfish tears unwiped, Ill emulate the upturn'd look that shone In God's own light, what time the Cherubim Made the first Temple's gilded glory dim. CHRISTMAS. Now the day of joy is come, Let's be joyful all and some; We were waked to life By the thrilling fife, And the dub-a-dub of the rumbling drum. Through the twists and the turns of the winding horn The news is loud sounded—The Mighty is born! The Mighty to conquer—the Mighty to save! Here 's a health to all friends on the land or the wave! But she that bare Him, where was she At this bright time of jollity? Virgin mother—Virgin bride, With her Baby by her side; There she lies on musty straw, In crazy stall, by many a flaw Of many a winter, drill'd and holed, Weak, and comfortless, and cold; With no sister, and no mother, Aunt, or female friend, to soothe her. Only he, ordain'd to wed, And never take her to his bed, Yet her husband and defender, Watches nigh to cheer and tend her. Mary—mother undefiled, She smiles and weeps on her mysterious Child. Not of her unheard, I guess, When her mother's pains were blending With the mother's blessedness, Hymns of angels, low descending, Through the abysmal depth of sky— Peace be to men on earth, glory to God on high. She lifted up her thankful eyes, Yet all her thanks were sobs and sighs; And ever with a pensive grace She gazes on her Baby's face; And ever and anon she sighs, And weeps awhile, and then she prays, And looks upon her Babe with downcast gaze, As if she knew the wee thing by her side Must be despised, and spit upon, and crucified! Watching shepherds have had warning Of the sweet and gracious morning; They leave their lambs upon the sod, And come to see the Lamb of God. The Baby smiles—He cannot speak, For He is as mute and weak As any other son of man;— He smiles, and that is all He can. But, lowly shepherds, unto you 'tis given To see what God did ne'er before disclose, A wonder to the sagest thrones in Heaven— Your Lord Himself, disguised in swaddling clothes. What angels could not guess before 'twas done— The secret lies asleep with that sweet little one. Lowly shepherds, haste away, Ye have done whate'er ye could; Ye can only praise and pray, Seek your flocks beside the wood;— Beside the wood, and on the glimmering plain: Lord grant ye have not seen your Lord in vain! And now the Babe sits upright on her knee. Calm is the mother, as a humble soul Is ever calm when it receives a dole Of grace, that makes it more devout and free. But there has been a star, That hath summon'd from afar, Even from the farthest East, from burning realms, Which oft the sandy tempest overwhelms; From tribes that haply have survived the wreck Of ancient knowledge, whom Melchisedech Led eastward ever towards the Sun's nativity, Up steep Himaus' height and sharp declivity, Three venerable men, Most reverend all, as aged men should be; But who they were abides beyond the ken Of Time-defeating History. Three men there were, with frankincense and myrrh, Knelt before Mary and entreated her, For her sweet Infant's sake—for all That he might be, and men might holy call, To take their gifts of frankincense and gold. The maiden smiled, the Baby smiled likewise; Yet there was something in his mien and eyes, That said—I take it as the gift of love: Ye seek to please an infant with a toy. So go your ways. Back to your spicy groves; But Christ is not, for aye, a baby boy: I do not love your incense or your gold, Like the sweet welcome from the shepherds' fold. But since that maiden mother, meek, Within a little, little week, Such strange adventures had to bear, So fearful strange,—she did not dare To ask of God, or her own heart What holy truth they might impart: And since the tears were still in Mary's eyes Till her blest Son received her in the skies,— Let not the hearts, whose sorrow cannot call This Christmas merry, slight the festival: Let us be merry that may merry be, But let us not forget that many mourn; The smiling Baby came to give us glee, But for the weepers was the Saviour born. SIMEON. In the huge temple, deck'd by Herod's pride, Who fain would bribe a God he ne'er believed, Kneels a meek woman, that hath once conceived, Tho' she was never like an earthly bride. And yet the stainless would be purified, And wash away the stain that yet was none, And for the birth of her immaculate Son With the stern rigour of the law complied: The duty paid received its due reward When Simeon bless'd the Baby on her arm; And though he plainly told her that a sword Must pierce her soul, she felt no weak alarm, For that for which a Prophet thank'd the Lord Once to have seen, could never end in harm. JESUS PRAYING. LUKE VI. 12. He sought the mountain and the loneliest height, For He would meet his Father all alone, And there, with many a tear and many a groan, He strove in prayer throughout the long, long night. Why need He pray, who held by filial right, O'er all the world alike of thought and sense, The fullness of his Sire's omnipotence? Why crave in prayer what was his own by might? Vain is the question,—Christ was man in deed, And being man, his duty was to pray. The Son of God confess'd the human need, And doubtless ask'd a blessing every day. Nor ceases yet for sinful man to plead, Nor will, till heaven and earth shall pass away. BUT JESUS SLEPT. “But Jesus slept.” The inland sea was wild, And the good son of Mary was asleep, For sleep He did, an infant meek and mild, When fain He would, and fain He would not weep; As peevish, fond, as any other child, Close to the Virgin breast He long'd to creep, And feel the warmth of mother undefiled. And now the Shepherd of the chosen sheep, Doth He not watch? Oh, vain and faithless guest! He slept a man,—but, lo! He wakes our God! What man is this, at whose almighty nod The winds are still, and every wave at rest? 'Tis He whose seeming sleep approves our faith, But ever wakes to save us from the death. SUNDAY. Thou blessed day! I will not call thee last, Nor Sabbath,—last nor first of all the seven, But a calm slip of intervening heaven, Between the uncertain future and the past; As in a stormy night, amid the blast, Comes ever and anon a truce on high, And a calm lake of pure and starry sky Peers through the mountainous depth of clouds amass'd. Sweet day of prayer! e'en they whose scrupulous dread Will call no other day, as others do, Might call thee Sunday without fear or blame; For thy bright morn deliver'd from the dead Our Sun of Life, and will for aye renew To faithful souls the import of thy name. The ancient Sabbath was an end,—a pause,— A stillness of the world; the work was done! But ours commemorates a work begun. Why, then, subject the new to antique laws? The ancient Sabbath closed the week, because The world was finish'd. Ours proclaims the sun, Its glorious saint, alert its course to run. Vanguard of days! escaped the baffled jaws Of slumberous dark and death,—so fitly first Is Sunday placed before the secular days; Unmeetly clad in weeds, with arms reversed, To trail in sullen thought by silent ways. Like the fresh dawn, or rose-bud newly burst, So let our Sabbath wear the face of praise! THE SOUL. Is not the body more than meat? The soul Is something greater than the food it needs. Prayers, sacraments, and charitable deeds, They realise the hours that onward roll Their endless way “to kindle or control.” Our acts and words are but the pregnant needs Of future being, when the flowers and weeds, Local and temporal, in the vast whole Shall live eternal. Nothing ever dies! The shortest smile that flits across a face, Which lovely grief hath made her dwelling-place, Lasts longer than the earth or visible skies! It is an act of God, whose acts are truth, And vernal still in everlasting youth. PRAYER. Be not afraid to pray—to pray is right. Pray, if thou canst, with hope; but ever pray, Though hope be weak, or sick with long delay; Pray in the darkness, if there be no light. Far is the time, remote from human sight, When war and discord on the earth shall cease; Yet every prayer for universal peace Avails the blessed time to expedite. Whate'er is good to wish, ask that of Heaven, Though it be what thou canst not hope to see: Pray to be perfect, though material leaven Forbid the Spirit so on earth to be; But if for any wish thou darest not pray, Then pray to God to cast that wish away. PRIVILEGES. Good is it to be born in Christian land, Within the hearing of sweet Sabbath bells, To con our letters in the book that tells How God vouchsafed His creatures to command. How once He led His chosen by the hand, Presenting to their young and opening sense Such pictures of His dread Omnipotence, We all could see, though none might understand. Oh! good it is to dwell with Christian folk, Where even the blind may see, the deaf may hear, The words that Paul hath wrote, that Jesus spoke, By book or preacher shown to eye or ear, Where Gospel truth is rife as song of birds— “Familiar in our ears as household words.” FAITH—HOW GUARDED. Yes, thou dost well, to arm thy tender mind With all that learning, and stern common sense Living hath spoke, or dying left behind; To blank the frowardness of pert pretence With long experience of a mighty mind, That, daring to explore the truth immense, Subsided in a faithful reverence Of the best Catholic hope of human kind. Yes, thou dost well to build a fence about Thine inward faith, and mount a stalwart guard Of answers, to oppose invading doubt. All aids are needful, for the strife is hard; But still be sure the truth within to cherish,— Truths long besieged too oft of hunger perish. STAY WHERE THOU ART. Stay where thou art, thou canst not better be, For thou art pure and noble as thou 'rt sweet, And thy firm faith still working, will complete A lovely picture of the Deity. For 'tis in thee, mild maid, and such as thee, Whose goodness would make any features fair, I find the hope that bids me not despair, But know there is a Saviour even for me. May God in mercy from thy knowledge hide All but the path in which thou art advancing. For evil things there are, on either side, Dark flames on one, like antic demons dancing, And on the left a desert waste and wide, Where is no chart, no compass, and no guide. PSALM XCI. v. 1. Where is that secret place of the Most High? And who is He? Where shall we look for Him That dwelleth there? Between the cherubim, That o'er the seat of grace, with constant eye, And outspread wing, brood everlastingly? Or shall we seek that deeper meaning dim, And as we may, walk, flutter, soar, and swim, From deep to deep of the void, fathomless sky? Oh! seek not there the secret of the Lord In what hath been, or what may never be; But seek the shadow of the mystic word— The shadow of a truth thou canst not see: There build thy nest, and, like a nestling bird, Find all thy safety in thy secresy. ISAIAH XLVI. v. 9. When I consider all the things that were, And count them upwards from the general flood, The tricks of fraud, and violent deeds of blood, Weigh down the heart with sullen, dull despair; I well believe that Satan, Prince of Air, Torments to ill the pleasurable feeling; But ever and anon a breeze of healing Proclaims that God is always everywhere. 'Twas hard to see Him in the times of old, And harder still to see our God to-day; For prayer is slack, and love, alas! is cold, And Faith a wanderer, weak and wide astray: Who hath the faith, the courage, to behold God in the judgments that have pass'd away? THE CHURCH. Oh! do not think I slight, or scorn, or hate The zeal wherewith ye view the strong and vast Dominion of the Church in ages past, And giant splendour of her huge estate; For in her outward semblance she was great,— A mighty mansion, fit to entertain All nations, whom the mountain or the plain, Or Nature, in the length of time, could generate. Ye wish, I know, we could as one unite, And have a Church as ample as the sky, Whence every Church might draw its whole of light, And not divide, but only multiply. Good is your purpose; but, ye English youth, [Mistake ye not the symbol for the truth?] RELIGIOUS DIFFERENCES. Yea, we do differ, differ still we must, For language is the type of thought, and thought The slave of sense; and sense is only fraught With cheques and tokens taken upon trust, Not for their worth but promise. Earth is all One mighty parable of Hell and Heaven. The portion we can read at best is small; 'Tis little that we know, and if befal That faith do wander, like the restless raven, That rather chose without an aim to roam O'er the blank world of waters, than to seek In the one sacred ark, a duteous home, May good be with it! Yet the bird so meek, The missive dove, that ne'er begrudged her pain, But duly to the ark return'd again, And brought at last the promise and the pledge Of peace, hath won a dearer privilege,— To be of birds the most beloved—of maids To be the emblem—the security Of mother's love and wedded purity! And see the mystic dove that sinks and fades In unreflected light on Jordan river, Upon the Mighty Sin Forgiver! Sweet dove, sweet image of the faith that rests All doubts, all questions past, In babe-like love at last, With that dear Babe divine, between the Virgin's breasts. Yes, we do differ when we most agree, For words are not the same to you and me. And it may be our several spiritual needs Are best supplied by seeming different creeds. And differing, we agree in one Inseparable communion, If the true life be in our hearts—the faith, Which not to want is death; To want is penance; to desire Is purgatorial fire; To hope, is paradise; and to believe Is all of Heaven that earth can e'er receive. WYTHEBURN CHAPEL AND HOSTEL. Here, traveller, pause and think, and duly think What happy, holy thoughts may heavenward rise, Whilst thou and thy good steed together drink Beneath this little portion of the skies. See! on one side, a humble house of prayer, Where Silence dwells, a maid immaculate, Save when the Sabbath and the priest are there, And some few hungry souls for manna wait. Humble it is and meek and very low, And speaks its purpose by a single bell; But God Himself, and He alone, can know If spiry temples please Him half so well. Then see the world, the world in its best guise, Inviting thee its bounties to partake; Dear is the Sign's old time-discolour'd dyes, To weary trudger by the long black lake. And pity 'tis that other studded door, That looks so rusty right across the way, Stands not always as was the use of yore, That whoso passes may step in and pray. ON THE CONSECRATION OF A SMALL CHAPEL. I. There was a little spot of level ground, For many an age unmark'd by casual eyes, Bleak hills afar and sinuous banks around, And terraced gardens, gradual mound on mound, With every season's sweet variety. And there uprose an house devote to God, As lowly as befits a house of prayer; Yet large enough to sanctify the sod, The heaving earth that may conceal a clod, Which human love may wish to treasure there. O Lord! methinks to give this spot to Thee Did hardly need an act of consecration: I deem the pile no wilful novelty, But a good purpose—old as Thy creation. II. THE SAME SUBJECT CONTINUED. And yet I deem we rightly may rejoice When the chief shepherd of the many flocks, That wait the high call of his pastoral voice On many lawns or yellow pastures choice, Or crop the turf beneath the sheltering rocks,— Comes to unite this lone and sever'd fold, That feed so gently on their native flowers, With the best sheep that bled in days of old. Oh! should we not be thankful to behold One shepherd chief in such a fold as ours? How may the Sabbath utterance of the dell, With all the churches, make a mighty one, And with the minster organ's gorgeous swell The simple psalm combine in unison. THE DESERTED CHURCH. After long travail on my pilgrimage, I sat me down beside an aged heap, For so it seem'd, with one square shatter'd keep, Pensively frowning on the wrecks of age. The river there, as at its latest stage, Sinks in the verdure of its Sunday sleep, And sings an under-song for them that weep O'er the sad blots in life's too open page. I look'd within, but all within was cold! The walls were mapp'd with isles of dusky damp, The long stalls look'd irreverently old, The rush-strewn aisle was like a wither'd swamp, And mark'd with loitering foot's unholy tramp; The chancel floor lay thick with sluggish mould. Hark! do you hear the dull unfrequent knell, Survivor sad of many a merry peal, Whose Sabbath music wont to make us feel Our spirits mounting with its joyous swell, That scaled the height, that sunk into the dell? Now lonely, lowly swinging to and fro, It warns a scatter'd flock e'en yet to go, And take a sip of the deserted well. And, dost thou hear?—then, hearing, long endure. The Gospel sounds not now so loud and bold As once it did. Some lie in sleep secure, And many faint because their love is cold; But never doubt that God may still be found, Long as one bell sends forth a Gospel sound! THE WORD OF GOD. In holy books we read how God hath spoken To holy men in many different ways; But hath the present work'd no sign or token? Is God quite silent in these latter days? And hath our heavenly Sire departed quite, And left His poor babes in this world alone, And only left for blind belief—not sight— Some quaint old riddles in a tongue unknown? Oh! think it not, sweet maid! God comes to us With every day, with every star that rises; In every moment dwells the Righteous, And starts upon the soul in sweet surprises. The word were but a blank, a hollow sound, If He that spake it were not speaking still,— If all the light and all the shade around Were aught but issues of Almighty will. Sweet girl, believe that every bird that sings, And every flower that stars the elastic sod, And every thought the happy summer brings To thy pure spirit, is a word of God. A GRACE. Sweetest Lord! that wert so blest On thy sweetest mother's breast, Give to every new-born baby Food that needs—as good as may be. Jesus! Lord, who long obey'd The sainted sire, the Mother Maid, Teach my young heart to submit,— Deign thyself to govern it. Babe, and boy, and youth, and man, All make up the mighty plan; And these the Saviour sanctified, For He was all—and then He died. Whate'er He gives us we may take, But still receive it for His sake. But might the prayer within my breast Make others blest, as I am blest; And might my joy in thanking Thee Make for all hungry souls a plea; Then would I praise and Thee adore, And ever thank Thee, more and more Rejoicing, if Thou would'st but bless Thy creatures for my thankfulness. “MULTUM DILEXIT.” She sat and wept beside His feet; the weight Of sin oppress'd her heart; for all the blame, And the poor malice of the worldly shame, To her was past, extinct, and out of date, Only the sin remain'd,—the leprous state; She would be melted by the heat of love, By fires far fiercer than are blown to prove And purge the silver ore adulterate. She sat and wept, and with her untress'd hair Still wiped the feet she was so blest to touch; And He wiped off the soiling of despair From her sweet soul, because she loved so much. I am a sinner, full of doubts and fears, Make me a humble thing of love and tears. 1848.</field>
