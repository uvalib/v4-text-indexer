      <field name="fulltext">??? ??? ?????? ?????? ????? ??????? ?? ???????? ?? ???? ?????? ?? ??? ?????????, ???? ?? ???? ????????? ??????? ???????. Lucian Dial. Timon. Think on't a while, good folks, and you will find, Your body made for labour, not your mind. No other use of paper you should make, Than carrying loads and reams upon your back: Carry vast burthens till your shoulders shrink: But damn'd be he that gives ye pen and ink. Charles, Earl of Dorset. ART THOU GUILTY? COMPLAIN NOT, THOU ART NOT WRONGED. ART THOU GUILTLESS? COMPLAIN NOT, THOU ART NOT TOUCHED. Joseph Hall, a Bishop, and a Writer of “Biting Satires.” THE GROVE. A SATIRE. To Dorset, Dryden;—Pope to St. John sung;— And Walpole sanctified the verse of Young. Hail, happy Bards! whose songs with justice claim An everlasting monument of Fame! How blest were ye, to pour your tuneful lays To Lords! Our author does not here allude to the names quoted, so much as to the many peers not less distinguished by their merit than their rank, to whom Dryden, Pope, and Young addressed most of their works. But our present peers are of a very different cast. What, for instance, are we to think of the Duke of Dorset, when we are told that two clergymen being candidates for a living in his Grace's presentation, he bestowed it on the best batsman! whose judgment taught them how to praise; Who, by applauding yours, their genius prov'd— Who lov'd the Muse, and were by her belov'd. Not so with us—those worthful times are past, And now in vain around my eyes I cast; No Genius greets me, and its aid affords; No welcome poets meet among our Lords. In Homer's strain could I my thoughts rehearse, Where is the Peer to patronise my verse? Where is the Lord, on earth, to comprehend it? And, where, ah! where's the bookseller to vend it. Sad, barren age! when such a bard as I Can no bright star to grace his work descry! None that might charm the thunder of his foes, And give the Poet's mind to soft repose, Round him the blaze of all its virtues shed, And harmless save his yet unlaurell'd head. The Leeds and Mulgraves of our hapless days, Those ballad-writing Lords, whose loyal lays Could scarce applause obtain in pantomime, Would little dignify my loftier rhyme. Such should I laud, for each exalted grace, The world would say I mock'd the glitt'ring race; And coax'd them on, like Russia's beast ill-fated, Most strok'd and fawn'd upon when to be baited. Would Sheffield's name secure me on the shelf, As safe as Gibbon's has secur'd himself? Can he adorn my work, augment my fame, Who owes his little to another's name? Vain thought! as soon Sir William's might engage Mankind to look with reverence on my page. (Yet Pult'ney much in numbers takes delight, And o'er the book of books The book of books, according to Sir William Pulteney, is his banker's book, with which he constantly follows the advice of Horace. Nocturna versate manu, versate diurna. The richness of Sir W's purse is only equalled by the poverty of his spirit. One day he sent in great haste for Mr. S???, M. P. his brewer; who being ushered into the Baronet's presence, was informed, very seriously, that two barrels of the beer he had sent in-six months before, had suffered a little by a thunder storm, and wished to know what he could afford to give for it. “Give? Nothing,” replied George, “if it is sour.” The Baronet, extremely shagreened, said, “Come, come, you must offer me something. You know you can always throw it among your other beer, and the sourness will not be perceived.” S. after much entreaty, agreed to give about four shillings and sixpence for the two barrels, which the Baronet accepted, and they were accordingly conveyed to the brew-house. This bargain struck, Sir W. proposed to sell him, very cheap, some cyder of his own making, “which,” said he, “you'll send to your public houses, and they'll soon put it off amongst their customers, I warrant you.” Here George declared that he had taken the sour beer to oblige Sir W. but he'd be d?d if he'd have any thing to do with his sour cyder. Hic finis fandi: and they parted in a humour not much sweeter than the subjects that had occasioned their meeting. turnsday and night.) Or Poets heed a Boothby's smile or frown, Who deigns to read no verses but his own. Alas! no titled head of worth I view— “'Tis true 'tis pity; pity 'tis, 'tis true.” None that has merit to deserve the place, Which empty shall remain, to their disgrace. “Empty,” you cry. “No Patron chose at last— “This Preface then means nothing?” Not so fast:— My Preface unsubstantial, I allow, But still it has its meaning, as I'll shew. The pot-boy spares no froth, to serve the till, Aware, not less than I, all helps to fill! This clear'd! off now I'll leave, nor think it sin, My “faces damnable,” and straight begin. Say, O my Muse, for thou alone can'st tell, Who on Parnassus ever lov'st to dwell; How o'er its heights, and through its vales and glades, The God of Wit, and the Aonian Maids, With Graces fair, unzon'd, disport away, Join'd by the smiling Hours the live-long day. Mid dulcet sounds to soft Æolian strains, The Deity in peace eternal reigns. Not so, times gone, when ???????? ???????. A title given to Apollo, by Homer, on account of his darting his rays to every quarter of the globe. the far-darting God, For clam'rous cries, scarce knew what 'twas to nod; When invocations and petitions rose, And all the Mount was all things but repose. But May day last, Or ages past, The hour precise, the Muse forgets I vow, And Bards are poor chronologists we know, Apollo, curious to discern the cause Why thus the world agreed to scorn his laws, And scribble on regardless of his frown, Glutting with plays and rhymes the senseless town.

See note to v. 71. Ecl. 5. in Delph. Ed. Virg. flow'd: This could confer oblivion to a name, And that, O great reward! immortal fame. Next in a sacred grove, to Wonder's gaze, The Spirits of the place, an altar raise; And there Pan, Wood Nymphs, Satyrs, Fawns, and all The Sylvan train, attend to Chryses' call: For olive, laurel, palm, with speed they bound, And soon with choicest boughs bestrew the ground. To please the God, the priest now skilful proves, And decks his altar with the wreaths he loves. All things prepar'd—the hour appointed come, A crowd the air impregn with deaf'ning hum. In vain a Sybil at yon op'ning stands, And loud vociferates, with outstretch'd hands, “ ? “Procul ô, procul este profani Conclamat Vates,” totoque absistite luco. Æn.

As each appears, she scans his merit free, And, O poor Edmond! how she mangled thee! Not Eardley falls on pork with half the goût, We have often dined with Lord Eardley, and observed that the first thing he does is to cast his eye over the several dishes on the table, and if there chance to be pork, in any shape, either leg, spare-rib, griskin, bacon, ham, or even a sausage, he instantly dispatches his plate for a part of it, to avoid being taken for a Jew. However, we can assure his Lordship that a man is not the less a Jew for eating pork, than the Duke of York is a husband because he happens to love his wife. The Jews, says Juvenal, took pity on their pigs, and let them live to a good old age. ? Vetus indulget senibus clementia porcis. Happy the pig that liv'd in ancient days!!

She call'd thee “ign'rant, impudent, and vain; “The moth of genius, and great Shakspeare's bane. “To think thy darkness could illume his sense, “His pow'rs be strengthen'd by thy impotence, “His wit made clear, by thy sad explanations, “A mildew on his brightest emanations. The esteem in which the works of the multitudinous commentators on Shakspeare are held will appear obvious from the great price given for the old editions of our bard, which we cannot attribute to any thing more than to their being free from the gloomy elucidations of such glossographers as Mr. Malone, and we are of opinion that a Shakspeare, escaped from all his commentators, must be considered as one amongst the innumerable desiderata in English literature. “Presumptuous thing! whose comments none would greet, “Though tack'd to The reason why Mr. Malone did not go to see Ireland's Irish Shakspeare was not, as it was industriously reported, because he was sure the papers were illegitimate, but because he was conscious that he was no judge, if he saw them, whether they were so or not, and therefore thought it better to leave it to the public to decide for him. Nor did a bulky volume he wrote, replete with commonplace arguments and misrepresentations, to prove that they were spurious, appear until the fallacy of them was unequivocally established. We do not wish, however, to discourage Mr. Malone, as a commentator, by any means, but we wish him to learn the weight his shoulders can bear, before he takes up the load in earnest. Doctor Johnson declared that he thought Mr. Steevens very able to write a commentary on Tom Thumb:—what if Mr. M. was to try his genius on Jack Hickathrift, or Jack the Giant-killer?

Lately, another of the clergy, Mr. Nares, an ir-reverend dog, very likely in consequence of the prelate's success, has run away with one of his daughters. The Duke, however, need not much lament the match, as an alliance with the Church does not promise to lower the pride of the family, which is what he seems most to value in this world. Duke, more odious pride reveals, “Than surly Holcroft Holcroft is one of those Plebeii Philosophi, the bottom of whose tub, like that of Diogenes, will not bear too close an examination. As the pride of the philosopher was said to be seen through his rags, so may we see the most evident aristocratical disposition in Mr. H's most democratical actions. “He prates of tyranny amongst the great, “Himself a tyrant in his petty state.” We hear that Mr. H. is exceedingly fond and careful of the Rosinante he rides in the park, to enjoy in idea the digito monstrari, et dicier: Hic est, for the benefit of his health: seeing him well fed, rubbed down, and kept in the best condition. If this be true, we, knowing his conduct towards his children, can only observe, with a trifling alteration, what Ælian reports the cynic philosopher of Sinope to have said of the Megarians. ???????? ???????? ?????? ????? ????? ?????? ? ????.

Mr. Fox's late behaviour has, however, exculpated him from the odium of deceit; for he proved, in the highest degree, the sincerity of his wishes for a reform, when he declared, in his speech on Mr. Grey's motion, that “he should certainly think himself justified in giving more of his time to his own private concerns than he had hitherto done, and less of it to fruitless (a many meaning word) exertions in that house.” This is the act of Wisdom! And we cannot help saying to the remainder of Opposition, “Go thou and do like-wise.” Fox and Sherry We confess that we have often been struck with the resemblance that exists between certain opposition members and a mountebank assisted by two Merry Andrews. Fox, like the mountebank, speaks to his auditors as seriously as he is able— then either Sheridan or Courtenay, his two Merry Andrews, comes forward, and endeavours by his whimsicality to aid the manœuvres of his master. But is this what we expect from men elected to meet and deliberate for the welfare of a kingdom? Surely not! and we lament to see Sheridan, who is capable of better things, make himself ?????? ?? ??? ???? ?????? teach, “To doubt the candour of a specious speech. “When men for order and amendment storm, “Who're most disorderly, and past reform; “ We all, in every station, oppose the thing that militates against our pleasure. The gentlemen who review in the British Critic, clearly evince, by their observations on Mr. Adam Clarke's dissertation on the use and abuse of tobacco, how much they feel themselves affected by his expositions of its baneful effects. Added to what Mr. C. says against it, J. Helvigius asserts that two Dutchmen died apoplectic immediately after smoaking, and the head of one being opened, they found his brain entirely wasted; notwithstanding which, these critical gentlemen, through fear, or hope, or love of the vice, oppose the opinion strenuously, and are bold enough to declare that “they know no instance of men whose brains have been obliterated or tarnished by smoaking.” This is affirming much, and we fear for the sake of opposition rather than from self-experience.When, right or wrong, all motions are withstood, “None can but deem them champions of our good. “And, since to many Stephen's yields a seat, “That bailiffs shirk and trotting When the friends of the youngest Thellusson proposed making him a member of parliament, he said, “he did not understand exactly what it was to be in parliament, or what they meant by constituents in the country; but if there was any necessity to go backwards and forwards for their orders, he'd be d?d if he could not trot down as fast as any member of parliament in the kingdom. The City Light Horse, a corps of which Master Charles is a redoubted member, being tam coquo quam marte, instituted, at the commencement of their peaceable campaign, a mess three times a week at the British Coffee-house, and three times at the London Tavern. It soon dwindled, however, for private reasons, to once a week at each, and at present the gallant corps, wishing, without doubt, to avoid shedding blood, dine but once a month at the British. A further anecdote of this hopeful family.—The other member-brother, about two months after he had bought his seat, coming into Drury-Lane theatre when the house had broke up, began talking vehemently of something very strange which had happened that night in the course of the debate. “A thing, Sir,” said he, to an old gentleman, “that never happened before.”—“In your remembrance, I presume you mean,” replied the other.butchers beat, “Who would not, soon as there, with truth I speak, “In Stephen's other house for virtue seek? “Fools for philosophers with numbers pass, “As for the lion once the braying ass: “So Godwin mark, in words of wond'rous feature, “But seen in truth, a weakly little creature. “Holcroft his type, by slavish passions furl'd, “A peevish insect wriggling through the world. “Their philosophic works—for those they bring— “From wild, absurd, chaotic notions spring. “Utopian schemes, that may pervert the mind, “But ne'er produce advantage to mankind. “Nor hence alone, desertless they advance, “For all this nothing's smuggled o'er from France.” For all the new-fangled doctrine and insane philosophy with which Messrs. Godwin and Holcroft have filled their volumes, they are indebted to an ingenious but hair-brained unprofitable Frenchman, whose way of thinking and mode of reasoning so much delighted them, that they kept him for a considerable time at their mutual expence; and after pleasing themselves for many months with chasing the gaudy butterflies the Frenchman let loose to divert them, they at length presented the public with a great deal of pomp and circumstance, the subjects of their entertainment. We may say of the works of these gentlemen what Johnson said of Priestley's Theology, “they tend to unsettle every thing, and yet settle nothing.” It must be a matter of special ridicule to see a man, like Godwin, undertake, as he does in his Essays, to point out the inelegancies, &amp;c. in the language of the first writers of the two last centuries, while he is continually betraying an unpardonable ignorance of the commonest rules of grammar. Witness his XIV. Essay, page 120. “He grows hourly more estranged to (from) the liberal sentiments of equality.” Sic passim.

There are many in this kingdom who vainly expect to eternize their memory by building monuments of various descriptions, while they permit men to die in want, the opitulation of whom, would have raised a pile, in the eyes of humanity that ages yet to come would hail with blessings. But, stranger yet than all, it is, that there lives a man, who by lofty structures would perpetuate a name, the remembrance of which can never exist unaccompanied by disgrace; and thus fixes he an eternal blush on the cheek of his whole posterity. If such men are not willing to gain a renown for good deeds, they had better seek oblivion than fame— “Glad to be hid, and proud to be forgot.” Johnson. Sir James Marriot, judge of the High Court of Admiralty, is one also who imagines that adorning the place where his remains are to be deposited will form a brighter trait in his memory than would the record of his having expended the same sum in relieving the distresses of the living. Sir James, (unlike Mausolus, who left it to his wife) has himself erected a Mausoleum at his country seat, for this purpose, and exhibits it to his visitors with remarks replete with all the whim, wit, and humor, that distinguish those of the Cicerone of Westminster Abbey. He has also written his epitaph, which is equally remarkable for its extreme modesty as for the wonderful truths it contains.

On which the Duke of York one day pleasantly observed, that “he imagined Lord Cawdor intended to preserve his sword, boots, and gauntlets, as they were, in the archives of his house, to commemorate the service he had seen and rendered his country.” It would, however, be better, perhaps, if his Lordship should devote them to his tutelar saint, Saint David, in imitation of the ancients, who, whenever they escaped any imminent danger, (like the present for instance) constantly consecrated some memorial of it in the temples of their Gods. Cawdor shall then be known as Cæsar brave, “And Mr. Harris is to authors and players, Mel in ore Verba lactis Fel in Corde Fraus in factis. If a player, in a provincial company, makes any stand, he or she is instantly decoyed to London, to alarm the other actors, who would otherwise be often demanding an increase of salary. Their novelty attracts for some time, but, when that terminates, they are left out of every play, or put in characters of the least importance, till at length, tired of waiting, and wishing rather to play for nothing than not play at all, they agree to relinquish their engagement, to which the manager, having accomplished his object, very readily consents. They then go into the country, and find that, where they were before esteemed, they are now slighted and despised. And this they totally owe to falling into the hands of such a manager as Harris, who, by repressing their abilities, made them miserable in town, and utterly ruined them in the country. Such is the character of this man, that his most favourite actor or author speaks of him with the greatest contempt. His conduct with respect to the latter is not a little ludicrous. Nothing is to appear on his boards unaltered by himself. But how does he alter? In an Irish way, to be sure, for he knows no more of the laws of letters than a Bog Trotter. He erases carefully what the author has written, and writes the very same words on the blank side of the paper, at which the dramatist is obliged to smile in silence, and gratify the manager's ardent wish to have it known to the copyist, and the whole theatre, that he has altered the piece, and given it the finishing touches. This worthy and ingenious gentleman has very nearly verified the reason that was given for his enlarging his theatre, namely, that he foresaw, on account of the nature of his amusements, a necessity there would be, ere long, for the greater part of his audiences to be attended by their nurses.

Of that description was Mr. Bifield's. Mr. M. who is now professedly drawing and engraving views round London, and writing the account of them, would have enjoyed the credit of having executed them in a very superior style, but for the death of a second person. At the commencement of his undertaking, he had a little hunch-back'd man, an apprentice, exceedingly ingenious in aqua tinta engraving, who, after he had furnished several of the first numbers, died, and with him expired the spirit of the engravings; but had he survived the publication of the views, we should have seen no alteration in Mr. M's title page—It would still have appeared like the advertisements of a fellow labourer, “The whole is written and composed, and will be spoken, sung, and accompanied by “Mr. Dibdin.” The Earl of Macartney's embassy to China furnishes us with another instance of the labours of Genius forming a wreath to deck the temples of Ignorance. There were, on this occasion, engaged, a painter at two hundred pounds per ann. a student in the royal academy at fifty pounds per ann. and an assistant, who were to take draughts of every place deemed worthy of observation, and necessary for elucidating Sir G. Staunton's account of the embassy. On their arrival, it was intended that they should pursue a different course through the country, which would be the means of rendering their acquisitions more various and valuable. The painter however finding, or rather knowing, his inability, and desiring to preserve the character he had assumed, never quitted our student during their stay: and for this, added to his situation, he now, without having made one of the designs, enjoys the honour of having executed the whole. And, if any future reward should be bestowed, he will receive it, while the real artist must content himself with Hos ego versiculos feci, tulit alter honores.

Can we treat of impudent effrontery, and consummate ignorance, and not pay homage to the great academean? Mr. C. conceiving that his fortune would be instantly made, could he once exhibit a picture in the Royal Academy, purchased, from Mr. Arnold, a whole-length miniature of (we believe) Dido, Queen of Carthage, (which now graces the centre of his window in the Strand) for twenty guineas, and sent it to the Exhibition, as the effort of his own pencil. The hangers, however, discovered the deception, and inserted the name of the “true man” in their catalogue. Mr. C. on the Exhibition opening, presented himself at the door as an exhibitor, and was refused admission. A shilling procured it him, as well as every explanation he wanted. Not long ? animum picturâ pascit inani, but soon presented himself before Mr. A. and insisted on having his money returned which was also refused, and—we shall say no more about him. Charles unuseful deem, “And Mr. West, our great historiographer, had some time since recommended to his patronage the son of a Mr. More, his wine-merchant. Mr. W. perceiving that the lad had some idea of architecture, procured him admission as a student in the academy. Here he made considerable progress in the mechanical part; such as taking the elevation of churches, &amp;c. Though he had never produced any original designs, his drawings of various edifices were so correct, that he had often experienced the honour of having his productions accepted. The President, seeing his success, noticed him in the most friendly manner. An inadvertent act of his, however, gave suddenly great offence to his patron. Mr. W. on hearing that he had undertaken a drawing of the inside of St. Stephen's church, Warlbrook, was highly delighted, expecting to see his altar-piece there brought into prominent view; but, unluckily for poor More, being unable to draw figures, he applied to Mr. Newton, of the old society, who bears an eternal hatred to the Royal Academy, to execute it for him. Mr. N. rejoicing in the opportunity that offered itself of indulging his pique against the President, advised More by all means to leave it out, and to substitute in its stead a large red curtain, “which,” said he, “will have a wonderful fine effect as it is seen between the columns.” Mr. M. unconscious of offending, approved of the advice, and quickly daubed in a large red curtain.— When the picture was to be presented to the Committee, Mr. West made a point of being present to give it his approbation; but on seeing the red curtain blazing through the columns, instead of his altar-piece, the enraged President could scarcely contain himself: he asserted that the work was out of all drawing, and absolutely kicked the picture with his foot. Mr. M. was greatly surprised at finding his picture returned, but the cause being intimated to him, he immediately got a friend to remove the curtain, and give the altar-piece to the eyes of its enamoured master. The succeeding year St. Stephen's Church was again sent to the Committee: Mr. W. then altered his tone, and that which was before vile in the extreme, now appeared to be “all that painting can express.” In short, the President was pleased— he smiled—and the picture was hung in the best light.

Does it not sound like a petition to his majesty for an augmentation of salary, on account of his composing an ode purposely for him?

The Colonel either meant, by bestowing this title on the coach, to insinuate that the girls were delicious cakes, and calculated to attract the infants of fashion, or that, by engaging the attention of the young men, by means of their equipage, they might at length make cakes of them. Sir Charles's bye-name of the Pill-box, conferred on the other carriage, will need no explanation, when we say that it belongs to Mrs. Johnson, and is filled with her nymphs.

The manner in which he pours forth his lamentations may give some idea of his character. “If the King will have me,” says he, “what can I do? I'm not a better bookseller than another—I have had a classical education, to be sure; but, Lord, it is too much trouble for me, at my time of life, to run about to sales to buy scarce books and old halfpenny ballads. God knows, I want to live at my ease. But The king says, ‘Nick, Nick, Old Nicol must go.’ Nobody'll do but Nicol, and what's to be said.” Some time since Dodsley the bookseller died, making Nicol his executor, an appointment the latter had been very assiduous to obtain, inviting Dodsley, who was an old dotard, to his house, and feasting and cajoling him to his purpose. ? me ad se, ad prandium, ad cœnam vocant. Bona mea inhiant. Periplect. in Mill. Glor. But after his death, all you could hear from Nicol was, ‘Ah poor Dodsley; Alas, poor fellow, he's gone! Sure the good creature owed me a grudge, or he would never have made me his executor. But so it is; if there is any trouble in any family, it is sure to fall on Nicol's shoulders. Lord help the man, to make me his executor of all men living! I, who, he knew, hated trouble and meddling with other people's affairs. Well, friends do take strange liberties with one another, that's certain.” Soon after Nicol had married Alderman Boydell's daughter, he made her a present of a fine gaudy dress, to be worn at the Mansion House on its gala days. About the same time the Alderman published a print of the Death of General Wolf, of which Nicol desired to have a proof impression, which he was refused. A fête was just then going to take place at the Mansion House, when old Nick locked up his wife's rich suit, and sent her to her father's to inform him of it, and to whisper in his ear the price of redemption, which his wife, after some time, returned with, in the shape of a proof of General Wolf. We shall now quit Nicol, and conclude with an anecdote of his Master. His Majesty's attempt to visit the Nore was the occasion of two circumstances that deserve to be recorded, and here shall they have a place, which will give them a better presumption of immortality than the graver on sheets of brass or Arundelian marbles. The first was a very handsome compliment paid by the King to Admiral Duncan, on the latter's appearing at a levee, soon after George the Third, like Canute the Great, had proved to his courtiers that he had no power over the “roaring sea,” and could not “rule the waves.”—“I am sorry,” said his Majesty, “that I was unable to pay you my respects at the Nore.”—“I thank your Majesty,” replied the Admiral, “for the courageous and persevering attempt you were so good as to make.” The King then added, “I have learned courage and perseverance from Admiral Duncan.” The other is, (believe it posterity!) that Lord Spenser, the First Lord of the Admiralty, was sea sick, weathering Lime-house-Reach!

This might be considered as an indirect hint to the author, that he would prefer his abilities as a carpenter, to his efforts as a dramatic artist. Mr. M. has submitted; and Mr. Cross, whose genius has been transplanted from the Circus to Covent Garden Theatre, will be placed on the shelf, to view, in silent dudgeon, the sublime efforts of Messrs. Morton, Farley, Creswell, and Reeve.

A gentleman, who was in the shop, and had not escaped Mrs. S's observation, seeing her situation, after her departure, bought the ham, and ordered it to be sent to her house.

Although he can paint portraits, yet he has a great antipathy to the employment. The Duke of Norfolk going to his house (in a dirty alley somewhere in the West) with a desire of engaging him to paint his portrait, met a man coming down the stairs with two pails of white-wash. The Duke, taking him for a bricklayer's labourer, asked him if Mr. Barry was within? “I'm Mr. Barry,” replied the other, bluntly. His Grace, recovering from his surprise, explained the object of his visit. “Not I,” said the artist: “go to that fellow in Cavendish Square, (meaning Romney) he'll paint your face for you.” And here the conversation terminated. Rembrandt was as choice in his studies as Mr. Barry. He would laugh at those artists who studied the antique, and taking his friends into a room full of grid-irons, sauce-pans, houshold stuff, and instruments of all kinds, he would say, “These are my antiques!” Alas! few of our modern artists have, or deserve to have, any of these articles to study. Barry's oddities excite their smiles, “And there the sad mistake of blund'ring Mr. M????, page to the Prince of Wales. His original profession was to adorn, externally, the heads of others, in attending to which, he neglected to furnish, internally, the one belonging to himself. Briefly, in the course of his education, those vulgar attainments, reading and writing, were omitted. When Lord Jersey's pamphlet was first published, Mrs. M. read it to her husband, who committed the contents to memory, and was in the habit of descanting on its merits in all companies, producing, at the same time, the book, and pointing to one particular passage, which his wife told him perfectly exculpated the Countess and the Prince. This being perceived by an acquaintance at the One-Tun in St. James's Market, he stole the pamphlet, and placed in lieu of it another entitled “Strictures on the Conduct of Sam Chifney, at Newmarket, by Sir Charles Bunbury.” The consequence was, poor M. displayed, unwittingly, the latter, until he received a check from his Royal Master, who assured him that, if he did not learn to read and write, he should certainly lose his situation. A man, calling himself John Williams, and who affects also to support Lady Jersey and the Prince, has written the most flagrant libel imaginable on his Royal Highness. Complaining of the laziness of the Royal Artists, in not bringing their annual obligations to the academy, he says, “These egregious sons of the pallet deal with their honours as some ungracious varlets do with their wives: they solicit them for months to grant the possession of their charms, and when that is acquired, publicly neglect them.” Fie on such supporters! Before this Anthony Pasquin's, alias John Williams's trial came on in the court of King's Bench, it was very properly observed, “that it would be necessary he should go into court (as the law terms it) with clean hands; which (it was further said) he could not do in any sense of the words, either figuratively or literally; not figuratively, because he was a libeller himself; and, doubtless, not literally, because he never washed his hands.” The latter assertion, however, was somewhat too daring, since we are told that he actually underwent the operation of washing both his hands and his face twice while waiting the commencement of his action, and of which he had cause to repent; for, by removing from his face the stucco, which had long protected it against the ill effects of the weather, he caught such a violent cold and hoarseness, as obliged him to keep his room on the day the trial so justly terminated in his disgrace. We are informed that the said Anthony in concert with his friend Charles Phillips, presented a written copy of a very common book to the Marquis of Lansdowne, as an original manuscript, and obtained from that discerning nobleman ten guineas for the inestimable treasure.

In her writings there is surely none; and, in any thing else, we think no woman out of Bedlam would not sooner seek a likeness in the Magdalen than in the poetess of Lesbos. Though we might look for it in the latter, we suppose she finds it in the former, as she has recently published sonnets under the title of Sappho and Phaon, which she terms legitimate, meaning to insinuate, perhaps, that they are written in the genuine spirit of Sappho: or, it may be that she imitates the sonetto invented by Petrarch:—but Heaven knows what she means, and none will ever discover it by reading the work. We could not help smiling, on taking up one of Mrs. R's favourite papers, at the time of the publication, and reading an advertisement, standing thus: “This Day is published, Hot-pressed, and embellished with a fine Head, By Bovi, SAPPHO AND PHAON, In a Series of Legitimate Sonnets; With Thoughts on Poetical Subject, and Anecdotes of the Grecian (Grecian mind) Sappho.

It should be remarked, however, en passant, that this forcible expression of Prynne in English, (so knowingly quoted by Mr. D'I.) was made by Mat. Paris, full two centuries before, in Latin. “Quos Rex excoriaverat, comes evisceraret.” A summary way this of acquiring information, it is true, but very liable, from common editions, or worthless abridgments, to expose a man to ridicule and disgrace. Turn, gentle reader, to the title of any sect, if you find Mr. D'I. treating of religion, or the principles of ancient philosophers, and you'll quickly perceive with what facility he found means to make up his chapters.

To stink like a Jew, is an adage which Furetiere has preserved in his dictionary (always at dictionaries!); but this smell, it seems, disappeared when a Jew was converted to Christianity.” A smell disappear!!

He lived many years with Mrs. Melmoth, whose talents as an actress were of such respectability as to procure a comfortable subsistence for herself and friend. But their extravagance rendered it necessary for the lady to quit a regular company, and they travelled together in various characters through England and Wales. Sometimes she told fortunes, and Melmoth took the money; at others they had public lectures; and at Swanzea they performed a tragedy, and actually got twenty pounds, without any other actor, stage-sweeper, scene-shifter, or candle-snuffer but themselves; Pratt being at all of these, except the first, an amazing adept.

Mr. Harris (Mrs. R. says) has often applied to her to write for the stage; and she has as often refused. The fear of being forgotten by her friends, when they are making their wills, is not very far from the cause. “But soon she felt, while in the pit safe cramm'd, “Revenge complete! the base despoiler We suppose our author here alludes to the Secret Tribunal, by Mr. B. which might be said to be damned the first night, as it was only borne two or three times afterwards, by an empty house. Mr. B. has since produced, what he calls his, but what is, in reality, Mrs. R's, Italian Monk; a light, airy, mirth-inspiring, summer drama, taken, word for word, and scene for scene, from Mrs. R's Italian, a novel of much fancy, and absurdity. This play he presented to Mr. Colman, who, though Mr. B. had, for several years, vomited the most gross and foul abuse against him, accepted it, with a magnanimity worthy of a man of genius; for he knew, at the moment, that his asperser had no longer the command of that print from which he formerly winged his pointless shafts. Mr. B. overcome by this generous treatment, has changed his tone, and we did hope to have seen the same in the friends of this gentleman, and that the undistinguishing scurrility in the Monthly Mirror, on Mr. Colman and his writings, would have been supplanted by a style of criticism, if not judicious, at least gentlemanly and moderate. But our hope was fruitless, and we must content ourselves with the firm conviction that, though the world is credulous, it will not believe the madman who shall tell them it is dark when the sun shines in its meridian splendour; and that, from repeated specimens of such criticism, they must have been taught to conclude with Johnson, that any one “whom nature has made weak, and idleness keeps ignorant, may yet support his vanity by the name of a critic: a character which needs neither the power of invention, nor the labour of learning, to maintain.” At the representation of this piece, a friend informed us that the Monk was meant, according to the novel, to be the most serious character in the play; and, that Paulo, which we thought the most serious, was intended to excite laughter. But we could not allow this, for, to use an old joke, Paulo is a character by no means to be laughed at. If the curtain drops on a play the first night with applause, the author is almost sure of his three nights. And this is easily effected by those conversant in theatrical imposition. Mr. B. has practised it with success. It is to send a number of people into the pit and galleries, who are to applaud with rapture, but not till they receive the signal from a certain quarter, wherein is posted “the angel of salvation,” who gives them the cue. “The rabble knows not where our dramas shine; “But where the cane goes pat—By G?d that's fine.” Armstrong.

It is a custom with Mrs. R. whenever she prints, to send a copy or two of her work to most of the newspapers, by which means she hopes to avoid their ridicule, and indeed to puff and be puffed as much as she pleases. Shortly after the appearance of her last production, she addressed a few lines to Mr. Boaden, which ran thus: “Mrs. Robinson would thank her friend Boaden for some dozen puffs for Sappho and Phaon.” St. James's Place.

Mr. S. being at one time unable to send his son, who was at Trinity College, Cambridge, any money, the boy, a chip of the old block, wanting to give a dinner, sold his books for the purpose, and writing afterwards, to his father, in reply to that letter which brought him the above sad intelligence, made this quotation from the Facetiæ of Hierocles. ???????? ????, ?????? ??? ??? ???? ?? ?????? ??????. Rejoice with me, father, for books are now my nourishment. Sherry get, “Yet The following anecdote we take from a book which once belonged to Mr. Herbert Croft. It stood thus, in his own hand writing, prefixed to Dr. Johnson's Lives of the Poets, sold for Mr. C. at Mr. King's Auction Rooms, where we transcribed it: “Just before the appearance of the latter half of the Lives, a gentleman said to him, ‘So, Doctor, a young man at the Bar writes Young's life for you, I find.’—‘Yes, Sir,’ said Johnson, ‘yes, Sir, 'tis true; and I thought he would have done it very well; but the rogue has deceived me sadly, Sir: he did it a deal better than I thought he was capable of doing it.’ Fame may be able to relate sayings of other great men, which contain more wit, or more malice; but but where shall we find one which contains more good nature.” What, now, will the reader say, when we inform him, that this young man at the Bar was no other than Mr. Herbert Croft? Why, he will surely say that Mr. C. could not have found a saying to relate which contains more impertinent vanity. Croft's not more by Vanity beset; “Nor ???????? ??? ??????? ??? ????? ????????????, says Homer, in Od. But let us hope that we are not all so bad as George Stephens, the commentator, who, when envious of either friend or foe, and the Spiritus Zelotypiæ rages, composes an eulogium on them in an evening paper, one day, expressly for the purpose of attacking it the next. Stephens more, nor Mr. Bannister, jun. conscious that he possesses very little sterling merit, is jealous of any rising talent, which might occasion the public to draw a comparison. To be subject to much envy increases the bile, (but whether hepatic or cystic we cannot say) and a suffusion of the bile produces the jaundice. Mr. Bannister continually appears, from his countenance, to be on the eve of an attack; and Mr. Munden, a season or two ago, was actually afflicted with the jaundice for a considerable time, occasioned by the success of a popular comedian at the Covent Garden theatre. Mr. B. perhaps, envious of the success of his fellow labourers, when a student in the Royal Academy, used to recount such indecent stories to the man who stood in puris naturalibus, for their advantage, that the poor fellow was constantly obliged to come from the pedestal, and Mr. B. was, in the end, prohibited studying there for his pains. As we are now talking of players, we cannot do better than relate a neat equivocation of a comedian, between whose histrionic merit, and that of the one just noticed, there is the same difference as between pure gold, and the dross it despumates. A gentleman calling on Mr. King, when he was confined with a violent fit of the rheumatism, asked him, among other things, if he could oblige him with a bone for the theatre. Mr. K. not being able, or not wishing to accommodate him, replied, “My dear friend, I would with pleasure, and should be happy to accompany you, but really my bones won't go. Bannister, than they, “With envy swells, when others gain the bay. “As stars were dark, but for the solar light, “So Mr. Colman, in one of his tales, has very pointedly, and evidently, drawn the character of this gentleman. “On modern dramatists they fell, “Pounce vi et armis—tooth and nail—pell mell; “They call'd them carpenters, and smugglers, “Filching their incidents from ancient hoards, “And knocking them together, like deal boards, “And jugglers; “Who all the Town's attention fix, “By making—plays? No, Sir,—by making tricks.” The treatment Mr. Reynolds has received from Mr. Morton bears some resemblance to that received by Homer, from Thestorides. The latter of these lived, for some time, on the most friendly terms. We then learn, from a life of Homer, said, but without grounds, to be written by Herodotus.—???? ?? ??? ?? ??????? ??? ?????? ????? ???? ??? ?????? ? ?????????? ????????, ???????? ?? ??? ??????? ?????????????, ??? ??????? ????? ??? ?????? ????????????.—that after he had copied many of Homer's works, (which he had obtained by living with him) he determined to quit Phocæa, wishing to pass them off for his own. ? ??? ?? ?????????? ?? ??? ??????? ???????? ?? ??? ????, ??? ??? ??????????? ?????????????? ??? ?? ???? ?????????????? ?? ?????? ?????, ??????? ?? ?????? ???? ??? ????????. And going to Chios, he promulgated them as his own, and acquired much praise and some profit. Such is nearly the history of these two gentlemen. They were in the habits of the greatest intimacy, when Mr. M. learned of Mr. R. how he managed to construct his plays, and what books he read to assist him: after which he stole all his characters, and sold them for his own. As Mr. Knight is Mr. Lewis's mimic, so is Mr. Morton the mimic of Mr. Reynolds. Mr. R. is now dead to Covent Garden, but his shade (not spirit) still lingers there in Mr. Morton. So will it soon be with the former. The friends of Mr. M. have been lavish in their praise of the purse scene in the Cure for the Heart Ache. It is, however, protracted till it becomes highly absurd; and that it possesses novelty we most confidently deny. We have many instances of similar feelings displayed on the stage, in a like circumstance, unattended by the ridiculous mode in which Mr. M's is brought about. The trick of discovering a hole, and attempting to mend it, which is seen in the same piece, we find in the Author's Triumph, or the Manager Manag'd, a farce, printed by J. Clarke, 14th April 1737, and acted at the theatre-royal, Lincoln's Inn Fields. We merely transcribe a speech. Tatter. (Peeping about) Ha! a hole? Ay, faith! there is a little one. (Pulls out a needle and thread, and offers to mend it, &amp;c.) When the two tailors, father and son, are standing together, the old man asks the waiter if there are any tailors in the place, and receives for answer, “there are two just by, which makes them look significantly at each other. What is this but our old friend Joe's two tailors, who, without understanding French, took a trip to Calais, where, one asking for something, the waiter replied, tout á l'heure, which they instantly mistook for the French pronunciation of two tailors, and looked at each other most likely as just described, since one exclaimed, “dam'me Jack but he knows us?” Had we leisure, many things of this kind, as well as whimsical phrases, taken from several authors; such as Frank O's “courage working into his knuckles,” for which see Colman's Mountaineers, might be adduced, to prove Mr. M's barrenness; so that he may safely say of an audience— If they approve, I perhaps may get the fame; If they condemn, I'm surely not to blame. The insignificance of the Children in the Wood, a farce, which has nothing but the pantomimic merit of the performers to recommend it, has perhaps precluded criticism, and left its author in the quiet possession of an opinion that the applause bestowed on the actors was a tribute justly paid to himself. The ballad, it is generally known, was taken from a piece, called Twoe lamentable Tragedies in one, by R. Yarrington, quarto, 1601. Of which we have no doubt that Mr. Morton has a very excellent copy. The language of it is extremely obsolete, but that could prove no impediment to Mr. M. who reads, we understand, any of our old authors without a glossary. This circumstance we consider as something not very much in favour of Mr. M. Next, the absurd manner in which the action is conducted, and the weakness of the innovations made in the story; as, for instance, the unaccountable meeting of Lord Alford and Lady Helen, with the children sleeping in the wood; then the fine pathetic scene, which terminates by Dignum's lugging away one babe in his arms, and Mrs. Powell the other; incidents which produce effects unequalled, it must be confessed, in any attempt at the ridiculous. And, lastly, the bare-faced imitation of a scene in Hoare's No Song no Supper. Storace, in the latter, sings of lamb, and it appears; of a cake, and it appears. In the former, Mrs. Bland sings of a noise at the window, and 'tis heard; of the door being broke open, and it is broke open. This is gross. It has been observed by some of that numerous body of soi-disant critics and remarkers, whom Dr. Johnson distinguishes as “the disturbers of human quiet,” that Mr. Colman, in the Heir at Law, has stooped to borrow from—Guess!— from Mr. Morton!! This accusation we firmly contradict, as false and groundless. And on the fact we are about to state, though not received from Mr. C. himself, yet from one in whom, having the most implicit faith, we wish to rest all our claims to truth. It is, that Mr. C. had conceived his characters, and written his plot, as well as a considerable part of the Heir at Law, long before Mr. M's Cure for the Heart Ache became public. This declaration being made, thus solemnly, we thereon establish Mr. C's inculpability. But it is now fair to imagine that Mr. M. had obtained some slight intelligence of Mr. C's characters of Cicely and Ezekiel, and seized on them for the Cure for the Heart Ache. This is the more probable, as the similarity is merely general, and not so palpable as Mr. M's taylor and son to Reynold's Gingham and his father, where the only difference is that in the one the old man can't sink the tradesman, and in the other the young one. Morton thou hadst liv'd in endless night, “And Mr. Holman, disliking to be only “a poor player, who struts his hour, &amp;c.” produced, it is said, an opera, called Abroad and at Home, thinking thereby to perpetuate his memory beyond the hour. Its vulgarity, however, induces us to think it is either not his production, or that he is not the same man abroad and at home. But, Supposing Mr. H. to be the author of this opera, we then look to Mr. Reynolds, to whom he certainly owes, not only the idea of attempting a dramatic piece, but also the knowledge he has of such compositions. And though he has not been so great a depredator as Mr. M. yet has he not been idle in “the pilfering way.” He, in Abroad and at Home, as well as Mr. M. in the Way to get Married, has not neglected to copy boldly Mr. R's prison scene in Speculation. In a word, when we look on Messrs. Holman and Morton as play-writers, we consider them as the graceless offspring of Mr. R. who, as it is said of the young of a certain bird, prey on that which brought them first to light. Mr. H. who merely travelled, once in his life, to Oxford, entered himself of Merton's College, kept half a term, spent a few guineas, and returned “to smell the lamp,” was, by the assiduous whispering of his friends, reputed to have been educated at the University of Oxford. We see a consequence. Mr. M. convinced that he, though entered of the Temple, to avoid being included in Charta XXII. Henry VI. had no right to style himself Esquire, first published by simple Thomas Morton, and has only lately repented of his wisdom. Mr. H. now, to his opera, calls himself plain George Holman, but he will hereafter, we have no doubt, in imitation of his friend, the squire, blaze forth on his title page, George Holman, of Merton College, Oxford. Doubting not but that Mr. H's delectable friends, Messrs. Boaden, alias Squire Check and Squire Morton, would also wish to be known as belonging to some college, we shall propose a mode by which they may bring it about. In the canon law, it is said, three persons make a college, tres collegium faciunt. Thus, therefore, may they form a college, and if they can persuade Harris to lend them the money, may erect one, which they may call after some one of those in the Roman Empire, as collegium fabrorum tignariorum, the college of carpenters, &amp;c. wherein each might be a professor, in his own way. Mr. M. a Professor of plagiarism; Mr. H. a Professor of affectation and conceit; and Mr. B. a Professor of vanity and insignificance. Nor do we see any obstacle that can impede their success, unless Jack Taylor, M. P. Andrews, and Captain Topham, should take it into their heads to oppose them. Holman too, than thou less shameless far, “Had Reynolds' wit not made ye what ye are. “ ? “Great palace of light, “Hither, as to their fountain, other stars, “Repairing, in their golden urns draw light.” Milton.To him, as to a fountain, still ye turn, “And each, by stealth, fills full his empty urn. “ Enough has been already said of Mr. Reynolds's distinguished and original merit as a writer: of his character as a man, in society, all who know him will bear ample testimony of its affability, frankness, and honesty; and nothing remains with us to state but the base and ungrateful usage Mr. R. has received from Mr. Harris, of Covent Garden. In this, however, he is not singular. Previous to the time Mr. R's first comedy appeared at that house, it was thinly attended beyond comparison. The town was soon attracted by Mr. R's ingenious efforts, the finances of the treasury considerably enriched, and Mr. R. a Magnus Apollo, was the object of the manager's adoration. He continued to give them his pieces: the consequence of which was, that Mr. H. rose to a degree of affluence, equal to his former want. But where is this man's gratitude to one who rendered him such essential services? It is only to be found in the shape of neglect and ill-treatment! He last year brought out Mr. R's comedy called Fortune's Fool, at a season in which few people visit the theatres; and when the town became more thronged, his play was, we believe designedly, injured; first by being seldom played, without any apparent reason for its suppression; and, next, by the appearance of Mr. Morton's—injured by the latter, because the people will always go, in preference, to see the last new piece. Mr. R. naturally disgusted at Mr. Harris's giving to a play (copied in general from his own) the advantage of the season, and the assistance a manager is capable of affording; added to very uncivil personal behaviour, with just indignation and resentment, left that theatre for Drury-Lane, where he was received with open arms, and has experienced, instead of the most low and disgusting, the most gentlemanly and inviting treatment. Mr. Harris's character is well delineated in the Author's Triumph, where a distressed author, presenting him with a play, he exclaims, Man. —“A play! Damme! I wou'dn't give a farthing for the best play in England. Here, Sir, here. [Gives the book.] If you could bark, friend, or dance the ladder-dance, I might talk with you.” The author, receiving this reply, has recourse to Mecænas, who, approving of his piece, summons the manager and players to appear before him. Here the manager says, “My Lord, authors are a pack of scoundrels.” Upon which Mecænas makes the following remarks, which we would recommend Mr. H. to commit to memory. Mec. —“How now, impertinent! Learn decency, do; and know that now you are before your betters. The insolence which you little chiefs contract, by commanding an army of renegades, makes you forget yourselves, and treat gentlemen as if they were players. But, let me tell you, you are not upon the par with an author. He is properly your master; furnishes you with tools, and sets you to work. What is a player, pray, without his task? you're but the factors of the poet's wit: 'Tis he, ye ingrates, gets you fame and finery, and makes a prince of a poor pimping pedlar! Isn't it so? Ha? Manager, (or Harris) —“Indeed, my Lord, there's a great deal of truth in't.Source of their works! when we thy loss deplore, “Holman shall fade, and Morton be no more.” So said the goddess, as they nearer drew— When o'er the Grove a sudden darkness grew. Up rose the priest, with awe submissive bent, Obedient to the sign of his intent: ( ?? ????????? ???????? ?? ??????????. Carion in Plut. Aristoph. Act I. Sc. 1.Who from his golden tripod, Fate's design Delivers forth in oracles divine) And yet, while lives a momentary pause, The shrine abandons, and in haste withdraws. Then, Vanity, throughout thy faithful clan, What strange alarms and wild distraction ran! But first, my Muse, relate what chance befel, The bards whose virtues Fame was proud to tell— Say how by wood-nymphs guided on their way, They safe through secret paths and windings stray, The bound'ry reach, and quit the sacred ground, With fairest laurels by the Dryads crown'd. Mean time the Satyrs studiously prepare Their whips and spears in order for the war— Pan gives the word—rejoic'd they rush along, And drive pell-mell the vain and fear-struck throng. All ways they run, through each avenue dart, And howl and hollow as they feel the smart. Hats, wigs, and spectacles they leave behind, Nor breathe, till all some friendly outlet find. The Grove reliev'd! the thunder loud appals, And on the loaded shrine the light'ning falls. Swift Fame her fav'rite works to rescue flies, And to Parnassus bears the honour'd prize. Soon wasting flames the rest to dust reduce— A writer of Lord Chesterfield's life, concludes with saying, “These were his excellencies—let those who surpass him speak of his defects.” Which passage, with a slight alteration, shall terminate our animadversions on the votaries of vanity. Peace be with them! These were their follies—let those who surpass them speak of their wisdom.True emblem of their former weight and use! Now sweetest sweet from flow'rs immortal springs, And birds shake perfumes from their od'rous wings. The God appeas'd, resumes his wonted grace Apollo, the Sun, Phoebus, and Hyperion, were certainly distinct characters, and our author, for confounding them occasionally, has no other excuse but that he has followed the practice of other great poets.And light refulgent purifies the place.
