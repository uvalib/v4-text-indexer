      <field name="fulltext">TO THE RIGHT HONOURABLE JAMES EARL OF ERROLL, LORD HIGH CONSTABLE OF SCOTLAND;</field>
      <field name="fulltext">THE JUDGMENT of PARIS. A POEM. ?????? ?? ?????? ?? ???????? ????. Pindar. Olymp. 13. Far in the depth of Ida's inmost grove, A scene for love and solitude design'd, Where flowery woodbines wild by Nature wove Form'd the lone bower, the Royal Swain reclin'd. All up the craggy cliffs, that tower'd to heaven, Green wav'd the murmuring pines on every side; Save where, fair opening to the beam of even, A dale slop'd gradual to the valley wide. Echoed the vale with many a chearful note; The lowing of the herds resounding long, The shrilling pipe, and mellow horn remote, And social clamours of the festive throng. For now, low hovering o'er the western main, Where amber clouds begirt his dazzling throne, The sun with ruddier verdure deckt the plain; And lakes, and streams, and spires triumphal shone. And many a band of ardent Youths were seen; Some into rapture fir'd by Glory's charms, Or hurl'd the thundering car along the green, Or march'd embattled on in glittering arms. Others more mild, in happy leisure gay, The darkening Forest's lonely gloom explore, Or by Scamander's flowery margin stray, Or the blue Hellespont's resounding shore. But chief the eye to Ilion's glories turn'd, That gleam'd along th'extended champaign far, And bulwarks, in terrific pomp adorn'd, Where Peace sate smiling at the frowns of War. Rich in the spoils of many a subject-clime, In pride luxurious blaz'd th'imperial dome; Tower'd mid th'encircling grove the fane sublime; And dread memorials mark'd the hero's tomb. Who from the black and bloody cavern led The savage stern, and sooth'd his boisterous breast; Who spoke, and Science rear'd her radiant head, And brighten'd o'er the long-benighted waste; Or, greatly daring in his Country's cause, Whose heaven-taught soul the aweful plan design'd, Whence Power stood trembling at the voice of Laws, Whence soar'd on Freedom's wing th'ethereal mind. But not the pomp that Royalty displays, Not all th'imperial pride of lofty Troy, Nor Virtue's triumph of immortal praise Could rouse the languor of the lingering Boy. Abandon'd all to soft Enone's charms, He to oblivion doom'd the listless day; Inglorious lull'd in Love's dissolving arms, While flutes lascivious breath'd th'enfeebling lay. To trim the ringlets of his scented hair; To aim, insidious, Love's bewitching glance; Or cull fresh garlands for the gaudy Fair, Or wanton loose in the voluptuous dance; These were his arts; these won Enone's love, Nor sought his fetter'd soul a nobler aim. Ah why should Beauty's smile those arts approve, Which taint with infamy the Lover's flame! Now laid at large beside a murmuring spring, Melting he listen'd to the vernal song, And Echo listening wav'd her airy wing, While the deep winding dales the lays prolong. When slowly floating down the azure skies A crimson cloud flash'd on his startled sight; Whose skirts gay-sparkling with unnumber'd dies Lanch'd the long billowy trails of flickering light. That instant, hush'd was all the vocal grove, Hush'd was the gale, and every ruder sound, And strains aereal, warbling far above, Rung in the ear a magic peal profound. Near and more near the swimming radiance roll'd; Along the mountains stream the lingering fires, Sublime the groves of Ida blaze with gold, And all the heaven resounds with louder lyres. The trumpet breathed a note; and all in air The glories vanish'd from the dazzled eye; And three ethereal forms, divinely fair, Down the steep glade were seen advancing nigh. The flowering glade fell level where they mov'd; O'erarching high the clustering roses hung, And gales from heaven on balmy pinion rov'd, And hill and dale with gratulation rung. The first with slow and stately step drew near, Fixt was her lofty eye, erect her mien; Sublime in grace, in majesty severe, She look'd and mov'd a Goddess and a Queen. Her robe along the gale profusely stream'd, Light lean'd the sceptre on her bending arm; And round her brow a starry circlet gleam'd, Heightening the pride of each commanding charm. Milder the next came on with artless grace, And on a javelin's quivering length reclin'd; T'exalt her mien she bade no splendor blaze, Nor pomp of vesture fluctuate on the wind. Serene though awful on her brow the light Of heavenly wisdom shone; nor rov'd her eyes, Save to the shadowy cliff's majestic height, Or the blue concave of th'involving skies. Keen were her eyes to search the inmost soul; Yet virtue triumph'd in their beams benign, And impious Pride oft felt their dread controul, When in fierce lightning flash'd the wrath divine This is agreeable to the theology of Homer, who often represents Pallas as the executioner of divine vengeance.. With awe and wonder gaz'd th'adoring Swain; His kindling cheek great Virtue's power confess'd; But soon 'twas o'er, for Virtue prompts in vain, When Pleasure's influence numbs the nerveless breast. And now advanc'd the Queen of melting joy, Smiling supreme in unresisted charms. Ah then, what transports fir'd the trembling Boy! How throb'd his sickening frame with fierce alarms! Her eyes in liquid light luxurious swim, And languish with unutterable love. Heaven's warm bloom glows along each bright'ning limb, Where fluttering bland the veil's thin mantlings rove. Quick, blushing as abash'd, she half withdrew; One hand a bough of flowering myrtle wav'd, One graceful spread, where, scarce conceal'd from view, Soft through the parting robe her bosom heav'd. “Offspring of Jove supreme! belov'd of Heav'n! “Attend.” Thus spoke the Empress of the Skies. “For know, to thee, high-fated Prince, 'tis given “Through the bright realms of fame sublime to rise. “Beyond man's boldest hope; if nor the wiles “Of Pallas triumph o'er th'ennobling thought; “Nor Pleasure lure with artificial smiles “To quaff the poison of her luscious draught. “When Juno's charms the prize of beauty claim, “Shall ought on earth, shall ought in heaven contend? “Whom Juno calls to high triumphant fame, “Shall he to meaner sway inglorious bend? “Yet lingering comfortless in lonesome wild, “Where echo sleeps mid cavern'd vales profound, “The pride of Troy, Dominion's darling child, “Pines while the slow hour stalks its sullen round. “Hear Thou, of Heav'n unconscious! From the blaze “Of glory, stream'd from Jove's eternal throne, “Thy soul, O Mortal, caught th'inspiring rays “That to a God exalt earth's raptur'd son. “Hence the bold wish, on boundless pinion born, “That fires, alarms, impels the maddening soul; “The hero's eye, hence, kindling into scorn, “Blasts the proud menace, and defies controul. “But, unimprov'd, Heav'n's noblest boons are vain. “No sun with plenty crowns th'uncultur'd vale; “Where green lakes languish on the silent plain, “Death rides the billows of the western gale. “Deep in yon mountain's womb, where the dark cave “Howls to the torrent's everlasting roar, “Does the rich gem its flashy radiance wave? “Or flames with steady ray th'imperial ore? “Toil deck'd with glittering domes yon champaign wide, “And wakes yon grove-embosom'd lawns to joy, “And rends the rough ore from the mountain's side, “Spangling with starry pomp the thrones of Troy. “Fly these soft scenes. Even now, with playful art, “Love wreathes thy flowery ways with fatal snare. “And nurse th'ethereal fire that warms thy heart, “That fire ethereal lives but by thy care. “Lo, hovering near on dark and dampy wing, “Sloth with stern patience waits the hour assign'd, “From her chill plume the deadly dews to fling, “That quench Heav'n's beam, and freeze the chearless mind. “Vain, then, th'enlivening sound of Fame's alarms, “For Hope's exulting impulse prompts no more; “Vain even the joys that lure to Pleasure's arms, “The throb of transport is for ever o'er. “Oh who shall then to Fancy's darkening eyes “Recal th'Elysian dreams of joy and light? “Dim through the gloom the formless visions rise, “Snatch'd instantaneous down the gulph of night. “Thou, who securely lull'd in youth's warm ray “Mark'st not the desolations wrought by Time, “Be rous'd, or perish. Ardent for its prey “Speeds the fell hour that ravages thy prime. “And, midst the horrors shrin'd of midnight storm, “The fiend Oblivion eyes thee from afar, “Black with intolerable frowns her form, “Beckoning th'embattled whirlwinds into war. “Fanes, bulwarks, mountains, worlds, their tempest whelms; “Yet Glory braves unmov'd th'impetuous sweep. “Fly then, ere, hurl'd from life's delightful realms, “Thou sink t'Oblivion's dark and boundless deep. “Fly then, where Glory points the path sublime. “See her crown dazzling with eternal light! “'Tis Juno prompts thy daring steps to climb, “And girds thy bounding heart with matchless might. “Warm in the raptures of divine desire, “Burst the soft chain that curbs th'aspiring mind; “And fly, where Victory, born on wings of fire, “Waves her red banner to the rattling wind. “Ascend the car. Indulge the pride of arms, “Where clarions roll their kindling strains on high, “Where the eye maddens to the dread alarms, “And the long shout tumultuous rends the sky. “Plunged in the uproar of the thundering field “I see thy lofty arm the tempest guide; “Fate scatters lightning from thy meteor-shield, “And Ruin spreads around the sanguine tide. “Go, urge the terrors of thy headlong car “On prostrate Pride, and Grandeur's spoils o'erthrown, “While all amaz'd even heroes shrink afar, “And hosts embattled vanish at thy frown. “When glory crowns thy godlike toils, and all “The triumph's lengthening pomp exalts thy soul, “When lowly at thy feet the mighty fall, “And tyrants tremble at thy stern controul; “When conquering millions hail thy sovereign might, “And tribes unknown dread acclamation join; “How wilt thou spurn the forms of low delight! “For all the ecstasies of Heav'n are thine: “For thine the joys, that fear no length of days, “Whose wide effulgence scorns all mortal bound. “Fame's trump in thunder shall announce thy praise, “Not bursting worlds her clarion's blast confound.” The Goddess ceas'd, not dubious of the prize: Elate she mark'd his wild and rolling eye, Mark'd his lip quiver, and his bosom rise, And his warm cheek suffus'd with crimson die. But Pallas now drew near. Sublime, serene In conscious dignity, she view'd the Swain; Then, love and pity softening all her mien, Thus breathed with accent mild the solemn strain. “Let those, whose arts to fatal paths betray, “The soul with passion's gloom tempestuous blind, “And snatch from Reason's ken th'auspicious ray “Truth darts from Heaven to guide th'exploring mind. “But Wisdom loves the calm and serious hour, “When Heaven's pure emanation beams confess'd; “Rage, ecstasy, alike disclaim her power, “She wooes each gentler impulse of the breast. “Sincere th'unalter'd bliss her charms impart, “Sedate th'enlivening ardors they inspire; “She bids no transient rapture thrill the heart, “She wakes no feverish gust of fierce desire. “Unwise, who, tossing on the watery way, “All to the storm th'unfetter'd sail devolve; “Man more unwise resigns the mental sway, “Born headlong on by passion's keen resolve. “While storms remote but murmur on thine ear, “Nor waves in ruinous uproar round thee roll, “Yet yet a moment check thy prone career, “And curb the keen resolve that prompts thy soul. “Explore thy heart, that rous'd by glory's name “Pants all enraptur'd with the mighty charm— “And, does Ambition quench each milder flame? “And is it conquest that alone can warm? “T'indulge fell Rapine's desolating lust, “To drench the balmy lawn in steaming gore, “To spurn the hero's cold and silent dust— “Are these thy joys? nor throbs thy heart for more? “Pleas'd canst thou listen to the patriot's groan, “And the wild wail of innocence forlorn? “And hear th'abandon'd maid's last frantic moan, “Her love for ever from her bosom torn? “Nor wilt thou shrink, when Virtue's fainting breath “Pours the dread curse of vengeance on thy head? “Nor when the pale ghost bursts the cave of death, “To glare distraction on thy midnight bed? “Was it for this, though born to regal power, “Kind Heav'n to thee did nobler gifts consign, “Bade Fancy's influence gild thy natal hour, “And bade Philanthropy's applause be thine? “Theirs be the dreadful glory to destroy, “And theirs the pride of pomp, and praise suborn'd, “Whose eye ne'er lighten'd at the smile of Joy, “Whose cheek the tear of Pity ne'er adorn'd; “Whose soul, each finer sense instinctive quell'd, “The lyre's mellifluous ravishment defies; “Nor marks where Beauty roves the flowery field, “On Grandeur's pinion sweeps th'unbounded skies. “Hail to sweet Fancy's unexpressive charm! “Hail to the pure delights of social love! “Hail, pleasures mild, that fire not while ye warm, “Nor rack th'exulting frame, but gently move! “But Fancy soothes no more, if stern Remorse “With iron grasp the tortur'd bosom wring. “Ah then, even Fancy speeds the venom's course, “Even Fancy points with rage the maddening sting. “Her wrath a thousand gnashing fiends attend, “And roll the snakes, and toss the brands of hell; “The beam of Beauty blasts; dark heavens impend “Tottering; and Music thrills with startling yell. “What then avails, that with exhaustless store “Obsequious Luxury loads thy glittering shrine; “What then avails, that prostrate slaves adore, “And Fame proclaims thee matchless and divine? “What, tho' bland flattery all her arts apply?— “Will these avail to calm th'infuriate brain? “Or will the roaring surge, when heav'd on high, “Headlong hang, hush'd to hear the piping swain? “In health how fair, how ghastly in decay “Man's lofty form! how heavenly fair the mind “Sublimed by virtue's sweet enlivening sway! “But ah! to guilt's outrageous rule resign'd, “How hideous and forlorn! when ruthless care “With cankering tooth corrodes the seeds of life, “And deaf with passion's storms when pines despair, “And howling furies rouse th'eternal strife. “O, by thy hopes of joy that restless glow, “Pledges of Heav'n! be taught by wisdom's lore; “With anxious haste each doubtful path forego, “And life's wild ways with cautious fear explore. “Straight be thy course; nor tempt the maze that leads “Where fell Remorse his shapeless strength conceals. “And oft Ambition's dizzy cliff he treads, “And slumbers oft in Pleasure's flow'ry vales. “Nor linger unresolv'd; Heav'n prompts the choice; “Save when presumption shuts the ear of Pride: “With grateful awe attend to Nature's voice, “The voice of Nature Heav'n ordain'd thy guide. “Warn'd by her voice, the arduous path pursue, “That leads to Virtue's fane a hardy band. “What, though no gaudy scenes decoy their view, “Nor clouds of fragrance roll along the land? “What, though rude mountains heave the flinty way? “Yet there the soul drinks light and life divine, “And pure aereal gales of gladness play, “Brace every nerve, and every sense refine. “Go, Prince, be virtuous, and be blest. The throne “Rears not its state to swell the couch of lust; “Nor dignify Corruption's daring son, “T'o'erwhelm his humbler brethren of the dust: “But yield an ampler scene to Bounty's eye, “An ampler range to Mercy's ear expand; “And, midst admiring nations, set on high “Virtue's fair model framed by Wisdom's hand. “Go then; the moan of woe demands thine aid; “Pride's licens'd outrage claims thy slumbering ire; “Pale Genius roams the bleak neglected shade, “And battening Avarice mocks his tuneless lyre. “Even Nature pines by vilest chains oppress'd; “Th'astonish'd kingdoms crouch to Fashion's nod. “O ye pure inmates of the gentle breast, “Truth, Freedom, Love, O where is your abode? “O yet once more shall Peace from Heaven return, “And young Simplicity with mortals dwell! “Nor Innocence th'august pavilion scorn, “Nor meek Contentment fly the humble cell! “Wilt thou, my Prince, the beauteous train implore “Midst earth's forsaken scenes once more to bide? “Then shall the Shepherd sing in every bower, “And Love with garlands wreath the domes of Pride. “The bright tear starting in th'impassion'd eyes “Of silent Gratitude; the smiling gaze “Of Gratulation, faltering while he tries “With voice of transport to proclaim thy praise; “Th'ethereal glow that stimulates thy frame, “When all th'according powers harmonious move, “And wake to energy each social aim, “Attuned spontaneous to the will of Jove; “Be these, O Man, the triumphs of thy soul; “And all the Conqueror's dazzling glories slight, “That, meteor-like, o'er trembling nations roll, “To sink at once in deep and dreadful night. “Like thine, yon orb's stupendous glories burn “With genial beam; nor, at th'approach of even, “In shades of horror leave the world to mourn, “But gild with lingering light th'empurpled Heaven.” Thus while She spoke, her eye sedately meek Look'd the pure fervor of maternal love. No rival zeal intemperate flush'd her check.— Can Beauty's boast the soul of Wisdom move? Worth's noble pride, can Envy's leer appal, Or staring Folly's vain applauses soothe? Can jealous fear Truth's dauntless heart enthral? Suspicion lurks not in the heart of Truth. And now the Shepherd rais'd his pensive head: Yet unresolv'd and fearful roved his eyes Scar'd at the glances of the aweful Maid; For young unpractis'd Guilt distrusts the guise Of shameless arrogance. His wav'ring breast, Though warm'd by Wisdom, own'd no constant fire; While lawless Fancy roam'd afar, unblest Save in th'oblivious lap of soft desire. When thus the Queen of soul-dissolving smiles. “Let gentler fates my darling Prince attend. “Joyless and cruel are the warrior's spoils, “Dreary the path stern Virtue's sons ascend. “Of human joy full short is the career, “And the dread verge still gains upon your sight; “While idly gazing, far beyond your sphere, “Ye scan the dream of unapproach'd delight: “Till every sprightly hour, and blooming scene, “Of life's gay morn unheeded glides away, “And clouds of tempest mount the blue serene, “And storm and ruin close the troublous day. “Thou still exult to hail the present joy, “Thine be the boon that comes unearn'd by toil; “No froward vain desire thy bliss annoy, “No flattering hope thy longing hours beguile. “Ah! why should man pursue the charms of Fame, “For ever luring, yet for ever coy? “Light as the gaudy rainbow's pillar'd gleam, “That melts elusive from the wondering boy! “What though her throne irradiate many a clime, “If hung loose tottering o'er th'unfathom'd tomb? “What though her mighty clarion rear'd sublime “Display th'imperial wreathe, and glittering plume? “Can glittering plume, or can th'imperial wreathe “Redeem from unrelenting fate the brave? “What note of triumph can her clarion breathe, “T'alarm th'eternal midnight of the grave? “That night draws on; nor will the vacant hour “Of expectation linger as it flies; “Nor fate one moment unenjoy'd restore: “Each moment's flight how precious to the wise! “O shun th'annoyance of the bustling throng, “That haunt with zealous turbulence the great. “There coward Office boasts th'unpunish'd wrong, “And sneaks secure in insolence of state: “O'er fancy'd injury Suspicion pines, “And in grim silence gnaws the festering wound; “Deceit the rage-embitter'd smile refines, “And Censure spreads the viperous hiss around. “Hope not, fond Prince, tho' wisdom guard thy throne, “Tho' truth and bounty prompt each generous aim, “Tho' thine the palm of peace, the Victor's crown, “The Muse's rapture, and the Patriot's flame; “Hope not, tho' all that captivates the wise, “All that endears the good exalt thy praise; “Hope not to taste repose; for Envy's eyes “At fairest worth still point their deadly rays. “Envy, stern tyrant of the flinty heart, “Can ought of virtue truth or beauty charm? “Can soft compassion thrill with pleasing smart, “Repentance melt, or gratitude disarm? “Ah no. Where Winter Scythia's waste enchains, “And monstrous shapes roar to the ruthless storm, “Not Phœbus' smile can chear the dreadful plains, “Or soil accurs'd with balmy life inform. “Then, Envy, then is thy triumphant hour, “When mourns Benevolence his baffled scheme; “When Insult mocks the clemency of Pow'r, “And loud Dissention's livid firebrands gleam; “When squint-ey'd Slander plies th'unhallow'd tongue, “From poison'd maw when Treason weaves his line, “And muse apostate (infamy to song!) “Grovels, low-muttering, at Sedition's shrine. “Let not my Prince forego the peaceful shade, “The whispering grove, the fountain and the plain. “Power, with th'oppressive weight of pomp array'd, “Pants for simplicity and ease in vain. “The yell of frantic Mirth may stun his ear, “But frantic Mirth soon leaves the heart forlorn; “And Pleasure flies that high tempestuous sphere, “Far different scenes her lucid paths adorn. “She loves to wander on th'untrodden lawn, “Or the green bosom of reclining hill, “Sooth'd by the careless warbler of the dawn, “Or the lone plaint of ever murmuring rill. “Or from the mountain-glade's aereal brow, “While to her song a thousand echos call, “Marks the wild woodland wave remote below, “Where shepherds pipe unseen, and waters fall. “Her influence oft the festive hamlet proves, “Where the high carol chears th'exulting ring; “And oft she roams the maze of wildering groves, “Listening th'unnumber'd melodies of Spring. “Or to the long and lonely shore retires; “What time, loose-glimmering to the lunar beam, “Faint heaves the slumberous wave, and starry fires “Gild the blue deep with many a lengthening gleam. “Then, to the balmy bower of rapture born, “While strings self-warbling breathe elysian rest, “Melts in delicious vision, till the morn “Spangle with twinkling dew the flowery waste. “The frolic moments, purple-pinion'd, dance “Around, and scatter roses as they play; “And the blithe Graces, hand in hand, advance, “Where, with her lov'd compeers, she deigns to stray; “Mild Solitude, in veil of russet die, “Her sylvan spear with moss-grown ivy bound; “And Indolence, with sweetly-languid eye, “And zoneless robe that trails along the ground; “But chiefly Love—O thou, whose gentle mind “Each soft indulgence nature fram'd to share, “Pomp, wealth, renown, dominion, all resign'd, “O haste to Pleasure's bower, for Love is there. “Love, the desire of Gods! the feast of Heaven! “Yet to Earth's favour'd offspring not denied! “Ah, let not thankless man the blessing given “Enslave to Fame, or sacrifice to Pride. “Nor I from Virtue's call decoy thine ear; “Friendly to Pleasure are her sacred laws. “Let Temperance' smile the cup of gladness chear, “That cup is death, if he with-hold applause. “Far from thy haunt be Envy's baneful sway, “And Hate, that works the harass'd soul to storm. “But woo Content to breathe her soothing lay, “And charm from Fancy's view each angry form. “No savage joy th'harmonious hours profane! “Whom Love refines can barbarous tumult please? “Shall rage of blood pollute the sylvan reign? “Shall Leisure wanton in the spoils of Peace? “Free let the feathery race indulge the song, “Inhale the liberal beam, and melt in love; “Free let the fleet hind bound her hills along, “And in pure streams the watery nations rove. “To joy in Nature's universal smile, “Well suits, O man, thy pleasurable sphere; “But why should Virtue doom thy years to toil? “Ah, why should Virtue's law be deem'd severe? “What meed, Beneficence, thy care repays? “What, Sympathy, thy still returning pang? “And why his generous arm should Justice raise, “To dare the vengeance of a tyrant's phang? “From thankless spite no bounty can secure; “Or froward wish of discontent fulfil, “That knows not to regret thy bounded power, “But blames with keen reproach thy partial will. “To check th'impetuous all-involving tide “Of human woes, how impotent thy strife! “High o'er thy mounds devouring surges ride, “Nor reck thy baffled toils, or lavish'd life. “The bower of bliss, the smile of love be thine, “Unlabour'd ease, and leisure's careless dream. “Such be their joys, who bend at Venus' shrine, “And own her charms beyond compare supreme.” Warm'd as She spoke, all panting with delight, Her kindling beauties breathed triumphant bloom; And Cupids flutter'd round in circlets bright, And Flora pour'd from all her stores perfume. “Thine be the prize,” exclaim'd th'enraptur'd Youth, “Queen of unrival'd charms, and matchless joy.”— O blind to fate, felicity, and truth!— But such are they, whom Pleasure's snares decoy. The sun was sunk; the vision was no more. Night downward rush'd tempestuous, at the frown Of Jove's awaken'd wrath; deep thunders roar, The forests howl afar, and mountains groan. And sanguine meteors glare athwart the plain; With horror's scream the Ilian towers resound, Raves the hoarse storm along the bellowing main, And the strong earthquake rends the shuddering ground. ELEGIES. ELEGY. [Exults the fluttering heart, O Mortal-born] Exults the fluttering heart, O Mortal-born, If Fame pronounce thee beautiful and wise, If pompous blazonry thy name adorn!— Approach, with trembling awe, where ?????? lies; And pause; and know thy boasted honours vain. Vain all the gifts that fortune can bestow. Late shone around Her all the gorgeous train, But shine not round the mouldering dust below. Gaz'd at from far by Envy's lifted eye What then avails to deck th'exalted scene, If there the blasting storms of anguish fly, If Frailty there displays her withering mien? But Virtue (sacred plant!) no soil disdains; The plant that Frailty's fiercest frown defies. Retir'd it blooms amid the lowly plains; Or decks the mountain's brow that mates the skies, And there conspicuous forms the Pilgrim's bower, When Sorrow darts direct the feverish ray; And forms his shelter from the tempest's power In stern Oppression's desolating day. This, Grandeur, be thy praise; 'tis more than fame. This praise was Hers; yet not to this confin'd, Hers was th'indulgent soul untaught to blame, Hers all the graces of the mildest mind. Slight is your wound, who mourn a Guardian lost, Though grief's sharp sting now prompt the pious sigh; He lives, the friend of man, the muse's boast, And Bounty's hand shall wipe your streaming eye. But ah! what balm shall heal His bleeding heart, Who for the Friend, and for the Lover mourns! Of all the joys that friendship can impart, When love's divinest flame united burns, Possess'd so late! but now possess'd no more!— Thus triumphs fate o'er all that charms below; Thus curbs the storm till joy's meridian hour, To wrap the smiling scene in darker woe. Sole object of a Mother's tender care, Could ought of song avail to ease thy pain; Or charm a Parent's, Sister's, Friend's despair; Fain would the Muse attempt some soothing strain. But what can soothe, when Hope denies her aid! Far in the silent depth of yonder gloom, Where the weak lamp wan wavers o'er the Dead, She hides in sable dust her sparkling plume. T'enrage their smart, Remembrance wakes severe, And bids the vanish'd years again to roll; Again they seem that soothing voice to hear, Again those looks shoot transport to the soul. The vision flies, and leaves the mind to mourn, Saddening each scene that pleas'd while She was by; For ah! those vanish'd years no more return; Mute the soft voice, and clos'd the gentle eye. Come, Resignation, with uplifted brow, And eye of rapture smiling though in tears; Come, for thou lov'st the silent house of woe, When no fond friend th'abandon'd mansion chears. Come, for 'tis thine to soothe the Mourner's smart, The throbs of hopeless anguish to controul, With healing balm to point Death's level'd dart, And melt in heavenly dreams the parting soul. We mark'd Thy triumphs in that hour of dread; When from Her eyes, that look'd a last adieu, Each weeping friend seem'd vanishing in shade, And darkening slow the swimming scene withdrew. 'Twas then, Her pale cheek caught Thy rapturous smile, Thy chearing whispers calm'd her labouring breast, And hymns of quiring angels charm'd the while; Till the weak frame dissolv'd in endless rest. MISCELLANY POEMS. THE WOLF and SHEPHERDS, A FABLE. Laws, as we read in antient sages, Have been like cobwebs in all ages. Cobwebs for little flies are spread, And laws for little folks are made. But if an insect of renown, Hornet or beetle, wasp or drone, Be caught in quest of sport or plunder, The flimzy fetter flies in sunder. Your simily perhaps may please one, With whom wit holds the place of reason; But can you prove that this in fact is Agreeable to life and practice? Then hear, what in his simple way Old Esop told me t'other day. In days of yore, but (which is very odd) Our Author mentions not the period, We mortal men, less given to speeches, Allow'd the beasts sometimes to teach us. But now we all are prattlers grown, And suffer no voice but our own. With us no beast has leave to speak, Although his honest heart should break. 'Tis true, your asses and your apes, And other brutes in human shapes, And that thing made of sound and show Which mortals have misnamed A Beau, (But in the language of the sky Is call'd a twolegg'd butterfly) Will make your very heartstrings ake With loud and everlasting clack, And beat your auditory drum, Till you grow deaf, or they grow dumb. But to our story we return. 'Twas early on a Summer morn, A Wolf forsook the mountain-den, And issued hungry on the plain. Full many a stream and lawn he pass'd, And reach'd a winding vale at last; Where from a hollow rock he spy'd The shepherds drest in flowery pride. Garlands were strow'd, and all was gay, To celebrate an holiday. The merry tabor's gamesome sound Provok'd the sprightly dance around. Hard by a rural board was rear'd, On which in fair array appear'd The peach, the apple, and the raisin, And all the fruitage of the season. But, more distinguish'd than the rest, Was seen a wether ready drest, That smoking, recent from the flame, Diffus'd a stomach-rousing steam. Our wolf could not endure the sight, Outrageous grew his appetite; His entrails groan'd with tenfold pain, He lick'd his lips, and lick'd again. At last, with lightning in his eyes, He bounces forth, and fiercely cries. “Shepherds, I am not given to scolding, “But now my spleen I cannot hold in. “By Jove, such scandalous oppression “Would put an elephant in passion. “You, who your flocks (as you pretend) “By wholesome laws from harm defend, “Which make it death for any beast, “How much soe'er by hunger press'd, “To seize a sheep by force or stealth, “For sheep have right to life and health; “Can you commit, uncheck'd by shame, “What in a beast so much you blame? “What is a law, if those who make it “Become the forwardest to break it? “The case is plain; you would reserve “All to yourselves, while others starve. “Such laws from base self-interest spring, “Not from the reason of the thing—” He was proceeding, when a swain Burst out, “And dares a Wolf arraign “His betters, and condemn their measures, “And contradict their wills and pleasures? “We have establish'd laws, 'tis true, “But laws are made for such as you. “Know, Sirrah, in its very nature “A law can't reach the legislature. “For laws, without a sanction join'd, “As all men know, can never bind: “But sanctions reach not us the makers; “For who dares punish us though breakers? “'Tis therefore plain, beyond denial, “That laws were ne'er design'd to tie all, “But those, whom sanctions reach, alone; “We stand accountable to none. “Besides, 'tis evident, that, seeing “Laws from the Great derive their being, “They as in duty bound should love “The Great, in whom they live and move, “And humbly yield to their desires; “'Tis just what gratitude requires. “What suckling dandled on the lap “Would tear away its mother's pap? “But hold—Why deign I to dispute “With such a scoundrel of a brute? “Logick is lost upon a knave; “Let action prove the law our slave.” An angry nod his will declar'd To his gruff yeomen of the guard. The full-fed mongrels, train'd to ravage, Fly, to devour the shaggy savage. The beast had now no time to lose In chopping logick with his foes. “This argument, quoth he, has force, “And swiftness is my sole resource.” He said, and left the swains their prey, And to the mountains scower'd away. 1757. On the report of a Monument to be erected in Westminster-Abbey, to the memory of a Late Author. Bufo, begone! with Thee may Faction's fire, That hatch'd thy salamander-fame, expire. Fame, dirty idol of the brainless croud, What half-made moon-calf can mistake for good! Since shared by knaves of high and low degree; Cromwell, and Catiline; Guido Faux, and Thee. By nature uninspir'd, untaught by art; With not one thought that breathes the feeling heart, With not one offering vow'd to Virtue's shrine, With not one pure unprostituted line; Alike debauch'd in body, soul, and lays;— For pension'd censure, and for pension'd praise, For ribaldry, for libels, lewdness, lies, For blasphemy of all the Good and Wise; Coarse virulence in coarser dogrel writ, Which bawling blackguards spel'd, and took for wit; For conscience, honour, slighted, spurn'd, o'erthrown;— Lo, Bufo shines the minion of renown! Is this the land, that boasts a Milton's fire, And magic Spenser's wildly-warbling lyre? The land, that owns th'omnipotence of song, When Shakespear whirls the throbbing heart along? The land, where Pope, with energy divine, In one strong blaze bade wit and fancy shine; Whose verse, by Truth in Virtue's triumph born, Gave knaves to infamy, and fools to scorn; Yet pure in manners, and in thought refin'd, Whose life and lays adorn'd and blest mankind? Is this the land, where Gray's unlabour'd art Soothes, melts, alarms, and ravishes the heart; While the lone wanderer's sweet complainings flow In simple majesty of manly woe; Or while, sublime, on eagle-pinion driven, He soars Pindaric heights, and sails the waste of heaven? Is this the land, o'er Shenstone's recent urn Where all the loves and gentler graces mourn? And where, to crown the hoary Dr. Young. Bard of night, The Muses and the Virtues all unite? Is this the land, where Akenside displays The bold yet temperate flame of antient days? Like the rapt Plato. Sage, in genius as in theme, Whose hallow'd strain renown'd Ilissus' stream: Or him, th'indignant Bard Alceus. See Akenside's Ode on Lyric Poetry., whose patriot ire, Sublime in vengeance, smote the dreadful lyre; For truth, for liberty, for virtue warm, Whose mighty song unnerv'd a tyrant's arm, Hush'd the rude roar of discord, rage, and lust, And spurn'd licentious demagogues to dust. Is this the queen of realms! the glorious isle, Britannia, blest in Heaven's indulgent smile! Guardian of truth, and patroness of art, Nurse of th'undaunted soul, and generous heart! Where, from a base unthankful world exil'd, Freedom exults to roam the careless wild; Where taste to science every charm supplies, And genius soars unbounded to the skies! And shall a Bufo's most polluted name Stain her bright tablet of untainted fame! Shall his disgraceful name with theirs be join'd, Who wish'd and wrought the welfare of their kind! His name accurst, who, leagued with ?????? and hell, Labour'd to rouse, with rude and murderous yell, Discord the fiend, to toss rebellion's brand, To whelm in rage and woe a guiltless land; To frustrate wisdom's virtue's noblest plan, And triumph in the miseries of man. Driveling and dull, when crawls the reptile muse, Swoln from the sty, and rankling from the stews, With envy, spleen and pestilence replete, And gorged with dust she lick'd from Treason's feet; Who once, like Satan, rais'd to heaven her sight, But turn'd abhorrent from the hated light;— O'er such a muse shall wreathes of glory bloom! No—shame and execration be her doom. Hard-fated Bufo! could not dulness save Thy soul from sin, from infamy thy grave! Blackmore and Quarles, those blockheads of renown, Lavish'd their ink, but never harm'd the town. Though this, thy brother in discordant song, Harass'd the ear, and cramp'd the labouring tongue; And that, like thee, taught staggering prose to stand, And limp on stilts of rhyme around the land. Harmless they dozed a scribbling life away, And yawning nations own'd th'innoxious lay. But from thy graceless rude and beastly brain What fury breathed th'incendiary strain? Did hate to vice exasperate thy style? No—Bufo match'd the vilest of the vile. Yet blazon'd was his verse with Virtue's name— Thus prudes look down to hide their want of shame: Thus hypocrites to truth, and fools to sense, And fops to taste, have sometimes made pretence: Thus thieves and gamesters swear by honour's laws: Thus pension-hunters bawl their Country's cause: Thus furious Teague for moderation rav'd, And own'd his soul to liberty enslav'd. Nor yet, though thousand Cits admire thy rage, Though less of fool than felon marks thy page; Nor yet, though here and there one lonely spark Of wit half brightens through th'involving dark, To show the gloom more hideous for the foil, But not repay the drudging reader's toil; (For who for one poor pearl of clouded ray Through Alpine dunghils delves his desperate way?) Did genius to thy verse such bane impart? No. 'Twas the demon of thy venom'd heart, (Thy heart with rancour's quintessence endued) And the blind zeal of a misjudging croud. Thus from rank soil a poison'd mushroom sprung, Nurseling obscene of mildew and of dung; By heaven design'd on its own native spot Harmless t'enlarge its bloated bulk, and rot. But gluttony th'abortive nuisance saw; It rous'd his ravenous undiscerning maw: Gulp'd down the tasteless throat, the mess abhor'd Shot fiery influence round the maddening board. O had thy verse been impotent as dull, Nor spoke the rancorous heart, but lumpish scull; Had mobs distinguish'd, they who howl'd thy fame, The icicle from the pure diamond's flame, From fancy's soul thy gross imbruted sense, From dauntless truth thy shameless insolence, From elegance confusion's monstrous mass, And from the lion's spoils the sculking ass, From rapture's strain the drawling dogrel line, From warbling seraphim the gruntling swine;— With gluttons, dunces, rakes, thy name had slept, Nor o'er her sullied fame Britannia wept; Nor had the muse, with honest zeal possess'd, T'avenge her country by thy name disgrac'd, Rais'd this bold strain for virtue, truth, mankind, And thy fell shade to infamy resign'd. When frailty leads astray the soul sincere, Let Mercy shed the soft and manly tear. When to the grave descends the sensual sot, Unnamed unnoticed let his carrion rot, When paltry rogues, by stealth, deceit or force, Hazard their necks, ambitious of your purse; For such the hangman wreathes his trusty gin, And let the gallows expiate their sin. But when a Ruffian, whose portentous crimes Like plagues and earthquakes terrify the times, Triumphs through life, from legal judgment free, For hell may hatch what law could ne'er foresee: Sacred from vengeance shall his memory rest?— Judas though dead, though damn'd, we still detest. VERSE Written by Mr. Blacklock; on a blank leaf of his Poems, sent to the Author. “? Si quis tamen hæc quoque, si quis Captus amore leget.”? Virgil. “O thou! whose bosom inspiration fires! “For whom the Muses string their favourite lyres! “Though with superior genius blest, yet deign “A kind reception to my humbler strain. “When florid youth impel'd, and fortune smil'd, “The Vocal Art my languid hours beguil'd. “Severer studies now my life engage, “Researches dull, that quench poetic rage: “From morn to evening destin'd to explore “The virbal critic, and the scholiast's lore, “Alas! what beam of heavenly ardor shines “In musty lexicons and school-divines! “Yet to the darling object of my heart “A short but pleasing retrospect I dart; “Revolve the labours of the tuneful choir, “And what I cannot imitate admire. “O could my thoughts with all thy spirit glow, “As thine melodious could my accents flow; “Then thou approving mightst my song attend, “Nor in a Blacklock blush to own a friend.” AN EPISTLE, TO THE Reverend Mr. THOMAS BLACKLOCK. Monstro quod ipse tibi possis dare; semita certe Tranquillæ per virtutem patet unica vitæ. Juvenal. Sat. X. Hail to the Poet! whose spontaneous lays No pride restrains, nor venal flattery sways. Who nor from Criticks, nor from Fashion's laws, Learns to adjust his tribute of applause; But bold to feel, and ardent to impart What nature whispers to the generous heart, Propitious to the Moral Song, commends, For Virtue's sake, the humblest of her friends. Peace to the grumblers of an envious age, Vapid in spleen, or brisk in frothy rage! Criticks, who, ere they understand, defame; And friends demure, who only do not blame; And puppet-prattlers, whose unconscious throat Transmits what the pert witling prompts by rote, Pleas'd to their spite or scorn I yield the lays That boast the sanction of a Blacklock's praise. Let others court the blind and babbling croud: Mine be the favour of the Wise and Good. O Thou, to censure, as to guile unknown! Indulgent to all merit but thy own! Whose soul, though darkness wrap thine earthly frame, Exults in Virtue's pure ethereal flame; Whose thoughts, congenial with the strains on high, The muse adorns, but cannot dignify; As northern lights, in glittering legions driven, Embellish, not exalt, the starry Heaven: Say Thou, for well thou know'st the art divine To guide the fancy, and the soul refine, What heights of excellence must he ascend, Who longs to claim a Blacklock for his Friend; Who longs to emulate thy tuneful art; But more thy meek simplicity of heart; But more thy virtue patient, undismay'd, At once though malice and mischance invade; And, nor by learn'd nor priestly pride confin'd, Thy zeal for truth, and love of human kind. Like Thee, with sweet ineffable controul, Teach me to rouse or soothe th'impassion'd soul, And breathe the luxury of social woes; Ah! ill-exchanged for all that mirth bestows. Ye slaves of mirth, renounce your boasted plan, For know, 'tis Sympathy exalts the man. But, midst the festive bower, or echoing hall, Can Riot listen to soft Pity's call? Rude he repels the soul-ennobling guest, And yields to selfish joy his harden'd breast. Teach me thine artless harmony of song, Sweet, as the vernal warblings born along Arcadia's myrtle groves; ere art began, With critic glance malevolent, to scan Bold nature's generous charms, display'd profuse In each warm cheek, and each enraptur'd muse. Then had not Fraud impos'd, in Fashion's name, For freedom lifeless form, and pride for shame; And, for th'o'erflowings of a heart sincere, The feature fix'd, untarnish'd with a tear; The cautious, slow, and unenliven'd eye, And breast inured to check the tender sigh, Then love, unblamed, indulged the guiltless smile; Deceit they fear'd not, for they knew not guile. The social sense unawed, that scorn'd to own The curb of law, save nature's law alone, To godlike aims, and godlike actions fir'd; And the full energy of thought inspir'd; And the full dignity of pleasure, given T'exalt desire, and yield a taste of heaven. Hail, redolent of heaven, delights sublime! Hail, blooming days, the days of nature's prime! How throbs the tired and harass'd heart, to prove Your scenes of pure tranquillity and love! But even to fancy fate that bliss denies; For lo, in endless night the vision dies! Ah, how unlike these scenes of rage and strife, Darkening to horror the bleak waste of life! Where, all inverted nature's kindly plan, Man domineers, the scourage and curse of man. Where, haply, bosom'd in tempestuous floods, Or dark untrodden maze of boundless woods, If yet some land inviolate remain, Nor dread th'oppressor's rod, nor tyrant's chain; Nor dread the more inglorious fetters, wrought By hireling sophistry t'enslave the thought: 'Tis there, 'tis only there, where boastful fame Ne'er stun'd the tingling ear with Europe's name. Too long, O Europe, have thy oceans roll'd, To glut thy lust of power, and lust of gold; Too long, by glory's empty lure decoy'd, Thy haughty sons have triumph'd and destroy'd: Or led by reasoning pride afar to roam, Where truth's false mimic haunts the sheltering gloom, Have plunged in chearless night the wilder'd mind, Th'abodes of peace for ever left behind. Unwise, unblest, your own, and nature's foes, O yet be still, and give the world repose. Say, is it fame, to dare the deed of death? Is glory nought but flattery's purchas'd breath? True praise, can trembling slaves, can fools bestow? Can that be joy, which works another's woe? Can that be knowledge, which in doubt decays? Can truth reside in disappointment's maze?— But quench thy kindling zeal, presumptuous strain; Thy zeal how impotent! thy plaint how vain! Hope not thy voice can tame the tempest's rage, Or check in prone career a headlong age. Far different themes must animate their song, Who pant to shine the favourites of a throng. Go, thou fond fool, thou slave to Nature's charms, Whose heart the cause of injur'd Truth alarms; Go, herd in Fashion's sleek and simpering train; And watch the workings of her pregnant brain, Prepar'd a sycophant's applause to pay, As each abortive monster crawls to day. Smit with the painted puppet-show of state, Go learn to gaze, and wonder at the great. Go learn with courtly reverence to admire A taste in toys, a genius in attire, Music of titles, dignity of show, The parrot-courtier, and the monkey-beau; And all the equipage of sticks, and strings, And clouts, and nicknames—merchandise of kings. Or, to amuse the loitering hour of peace, When slander, wit, and spleen from troubling cease, Warble th'unmeaning hymn in Folly's ear; Such hymns unthinking Folly loves to hear. Smooth flow thy lays, infusing as they roll A deep oblivious lethargy of soul: Let rill and gale glide liquidly along, While not one ruffling thought obstructs the song: So shall the gallant and the gay rehearse The gentle strain, and call it Charming Verse. But if an ampler field thine ardor claim, Even realms and empires to resound thy name; Strive not on Fancy's soaring wing to rise; The plodding rabble gaze not on the skies; Far humbler regions bound their groveling view, And humbler tracts their minion must pursue. There are, who, grabbling in the putrid lake, The glittering ore from filth and darkness rake; Like spoils from Politicks thou may'st derive: The theme is dirty, dark, and lucrative. Yet ah! even here the spoils are hard to win, For strong and subtle are thy foes within. The pangs of sentiment, the qualms of taste, And shame, dire inmate of the Scribbler's breast, The stings of conscience, and the throbs of pride, (Hard task!) must all be vanquish'd or defy'd. Then go, whate'er thy wit, whate'er thy style, Defame the good, and deify the vile; Fearless and frontless flounce into renown, For mobs and prudes by impudence are won. Though Providence, still merciful and just, Who dooms the snake to wallow in the dust, Oft curb with groveling impotence of mind The venal venom of the rancorous kind; Yet fear not; Faction's torch of sulphurous gleam Shall fire the heart that feels not Fancy's beam. Thus ?????? arose distinguish'd in the throng, Thus Bufo plied a profitable song. Proceed, Great Years, with steady glare to shine Where guilt and folly bend at Fashion's shrine; And ye, the vain and shameless of our days, Approach with songs, and worship in the blaze. For him, alas! who never learn'd the art To stifle conscience, and a throbbing heart; Who, though too proud to mingle in the fray Whence truth and virtue bear no palms away, Yet views with pity Folly's bustling scene, Th'ambitious sick with hope, the rich with spleen, The great exulting in a joyless prise, Yea pities even the fop he must despise;— For him, what then remains?—The humble shed, Th'ennobling converse of the awful Dead, Beauty's pure ray diffus'd from Nature's face, Fancy's sweet charm, and Truth's majestic grace. Truth, not of hard access, or threatening mien, As by the vain unfeeling wrangler seen; But bland and gentle as the early ray, That gilds the wilderness, and lights the way; The messenger of joy to man below, Friend of our frailty, solace of our woe. Thus by Heaven's bounty rich shall he repine, If others in the toys of Fortune shine? Needs he a title to exalt his race, Who from th'Eternal his descent can trace? Or fame's loud trump to stun him to repose, Whose soul resign'd no guilty tumult knows? To roam with toil, in restless uproar hurl'd, One little corner of a little world; Can this enlarge or dignify the soul, Whose wing unwearied darts from pole to pole? Can glowworms glitter on the car of morn, Or gold the progeny of heaven adorn? How long, enamour'd of fictitious joy, Shall false desire the lavish'd hour employ! How long with random steps shall mortals roam, Unknown their path, and more unknown their home? Ah! still delusive the vain pleasure flies, Or, grasp'd, insults our baffled hope, and dies. Meanwhile behind, with renovated force, Care and Disgust pursue our slackening course, And shall o'ertake; even in the noon of age, Long ere the sting of Anguish cease to rage, And long ere Death, sole friend of the distrest, Dismiss the pilgrim to eternal rest. Thus, wayward hope still wandering from within, Lur'd by the phantoms of th'external scene; We scorn, what heaven our only bliss design'd, The humble triumph of a tranquil mind; And that alone pursue which Fortune brings, Th'applause of multitudes, or smile of kings. But ah! can these, or those afford delight? Can man be happy in his Maker's spite? Vain thankless man, averse to Nature's sway, Feels every moment that he must obey. Close and more closely clasp the stubborn chains, And each new struggle rouses keener pains. Thus stung with appetite, with anguish torn, Urged by despair still more and more forlorn, Till each fantastic hope expire in woe, And the cold chearless heart forget to glow, We perish, muttering this unrighteous strain, “Joy was not made for man, and life is vain.” Sweet peace of heart, from false desire refin'd, That pour'st elysian sunshine on the mind, O come, bid each tumultuous wish be still, And bend to nature's law each froward will. Let Hope's wild wing ne'er stoop to Fortune's sphere; For terror, anguish, discontent are there; But soar with strong and steady flight sublime, Where disappointment never dared to climb. O come, serenely gay, and with thee bring The vital breath of heaven's eternal spring; Th'amusive dream of blameless fancy born, The calm oblivious night, and sprightly morn. Bring Resignation, undebased with fear; And Melancholy, serious, not severe; And Fortitude, by chance nor time controul'd, Meek with the gentle, with the haughty bold; Devotion deck'd in smiles of filial love; And thought, conversing with the worlds above. So shall my days nor vain nor joyless roll, Nor with regret survey th'approaching goal; Too happy, if I gain that noblest prise, The well-earn'd favour of the Good and Wise.</field>
