      <field name="fulltext">To the Right Honourable Sir Henry Lord Cary, Baron of Hunsdon, Viscount Rochford, Earle of Dover, &amp;c. To his worthie friend the Authour, Master Thomas Heywood. Heywood, when men weigh truly what thou art, How the whole frame of learning claimes a part In thy deepe apprehension; and then see, To knowledge added so much industry; Who will deny thee the best Palme and Bayes? And that to name thee, to himselfe is praise. As first, which I must ever first preferre, Thy skill in Poëtry, where thou so farre Hast gone, as none beyond thee, and hast writ, That after-ages must despaire of wit Or matter to write more. Nor art thou lesse, In whatsoere thy fancy will expresse. Thy pen commands all history, all actions, Counsels, Decrees, men, manners, States, and factions, Playes, Epicediums, Odes, and Lyricks, Translations, Epitaphs, and Panegyricks: They all doe speake thy worth. Nor dost thou teach Things meere prophane; but thy great Muse does reach Above the Orbes, unto the utmost skie, And makes transition unto Deitie. When thou with such high straines detainst our eares, As might become the Angels, or the Spheares. What Reader then in justice can decline From this assertion? Poets are divine, Rapt with a heavenly fire, which is made knowne By no example better than thine owne. Sh. Marmion. To the learned Authour Master Thomas Heywood. VVho can deny but Poets take their birth From some thing that's more excellent than earth: Since those harmonious strains that fill our eares, Proclaime their neere allyance with the Spheares, And shewes their Art all Arts as farre exceed As doth the fiery-Cane, the weakest Reed. That Matter which six lines of Prose rehearse, May fitly be contained in one Verse; Yea, and so pithily (if well compacted) That out of it whole Bookes may be extracted, A President whereof if thou wouldst find, I prethee gentle Reader bend thy mind To what this little Volume doth containe, And sure the fruit will recompence thy paine. The subject with the Authours names agree, Who all have left unto Posteritie Such Noble badges of their learned fame, That my weake Pen can no way shew the same; Therefore doe thou, ô Heywood, weare the Bayes As thy just merit many thousand wayes. For this thy Worke, with others heretofore Shall honor thee till time shall be no more. D. E. To my praise-worthy friend Master Thomas Heywood. Thy Worth unto the Knowing World is knowne, Let Criticks censure others by their owne, And tinct their foreheads with a purple shame, When they shall see thy Works, or heare thy Name, Whilst with thy owne, thou setst forth others fame; Whose lofty Anthems, in our English tone Thou sing'st, and mak'st them live, though dead &amp; gone, What barking or untutor'd Momus then Will dare to belch against thy learned Pen? Whose worthier Lines, unto their foule disgrace, Shall spit defiance in a brasen face; And when th'art dead, thy Poësie shall sing Such pleasant straines, whereof the World shall ring; And Envies selfe, in spight of all Assayes, Shall crowne thy Tombe-stone with eternall Bayes. S. N. [The Dialogue of Erasmus, called Naufragium] The Argument of Erasmus his Dialogue called Naiagaion, or Naufragium. Here you may reade an accurate Narration Of dangers incident to Navigation: With diuers foolish superstitions us'd By Mariners, (some not to be excus'd) Here is describ'd a Tempest to the height, With casting out of Goods, to ease their freight; And severall humors (to the life exprest) Of men in danger, and by sea distrest: Some, to the blessed Virgin call for aid: By others, Vowes to seuerall Saints are made. But this our Author will approue of none To be invok' t, but the Great God alone. The Interlocutors or Speakers, Antonius and Adolphos. The Dialogue. Anthon. Thou tel'st me wondrous things; Is that to saile, Where humane helpe so little can preuaile? Forbid it Heav'n, to come into my thought, That euer Wit so dearely should be bought. Adol. What hath as yet been spoke are trifles meere, If to what I shall speake thou lend an eare. Anth. So much from thee I haue already had, That I still tremble, and it makes me sad, As I had then been present. Adol. Dangers past Are vnto me of much more pleasing tast: That night there hapned what much tooke away All comfort from the Pilot. Anth. What, I pray? Adol. Dark was the night; when by the top-mast stands (Got thither by the help of feet and hands) One of the ship-men, and as from a It is commonly called the Bowland. Ioover He lookt from thence, if so he might discouer Some part of land: when on the instant, neare Vnto his side was seen a fiery Spheare; To Sea-men a sad Omen, if it shine Single: but twinnes, they better lucke divine: And in the times of old they call'd such too Castor and Pollux. Anth. What had they to do With Mariners? since those we understand Were Champions both, and vs'd to fight on land. Adol. The Poets so would haue it. He at th' sterne Casting his eye vp did the light discerne: Who calling said, My Mate (It is a word That Sailers interchangeably afford To one another) speake, dost thou not see The fire aboue that clings so close to thee? Who answer'd thus: I do, and I pray God That vnto vs it no misfortune boad. The flaming Globe straight by the tackles slid, And came close to the Pilot. Anth. I! But did Not he sinke downe with feare? Adol. The fright he'endur'd, They being to such prodigies inur'd. There hauing staid a while, by the ship sides It rowles it selfe, but there not long abides, But leaping from the hatches, vanisht so. Towards mid-day the tempest 'gan to grow More and more raging. Didst thou euer see The Alps? Anth. I haue. Adol. Those hills appeare to bee But warts to such sea billowes, (if compar'd:) Be judge then, how with us it that time far'd; How often were we lifted vp so high, Till to the very Moone we came so nigh, To touch it with our fingers. Then againe So low cast, that the Channell rent in twaine, To let vs downe to Hell. Anth. Mad men, no doubt, Who leaue the land, to seeke such dangers out. Adol. The Sailers striuing with the Storme some space, (But all in vaine) the Pilot with a face Like ashes, came to vs. Anth. And now I feare, By his wan colour, some strange mischiefe neare. Adol. I am no more your Pilot now (saith he) My friends, the Windes command both ship and me: Prepare for all extremes, there's now no hope Saue in our God, no trust in Saile or Rope. Anth. ('Twas an hard speech.) Adol. First therefore let vs ease Our ship (saith he) by casting in the seas Her weighty lading; for so now commands Necessitie: It with more safety stands, By losse of goods, death present to preuent, Than with them perish here incontinent. The truth persuades them; Instantly they hoise Into the Maine, rich Wares, and Vessels choise, And those in plenty. Anth. This a Wracke indeed May well be call'd. Adol. Silence till I proceed. Amongst the rest, a rich Italian there, Imployd in Embassy, who was to beare Some Presents into Scotland, and this Lord Had coffers, caskets, and stuft trunks abord, With plate, rings, Iewels, change of garments. Anth. Say, Was that man willing to cast all away? Adol. No: but being askt that question, made reply, He with his wealth would liue, or with it dy; And therefore storm'd. Anth. What said the Pilot then? Adol. Better it were, of these despairing men, That he alone should perish, than (to saue His proper wealth) all suffer in the waue: And therefore told him plainly, But if hee Vnto the generall safety would agree, (Need so compeld) that without further plea, Him and his wealth they'd tosse into the sea. Anth. A very Sailers speech. Adol. So, forc't at last, With his owne hands his goods away he cast, With many bitter curses; much inrag'd With gods and divels, that he had ingag'd Himselfe to such a barbarous element. Anth. A meere Italians pray'r. Adol. Obserue th'euent: (These our free-offrings notwithstanding) neither The windes nor waues were sated, but together Conspir'd: Our tackles were asunder blowne, And our torne sailes into the Ocean throwne. Anth. Distresse indeed. Adol. The Pilot comes againe. Anth. To preach as at the first? Adol. In a sad straine He thus salutes vs: Friends, as the case stands, I wish you would commend you to heav'ns hands, And so prepare for death. Some who had been At sea before, and in that Art well seen, Askt him, How long he thought he could maintaine His ship to liue? who briefely said againe, Not full three houres, (as being then at worst.) Anth. Why this was harder doctrine than the first. Adol. Which hauing said, the Sailers he straight bid To cut the cords asunder: which they did. And next, To saw the main-Mast by the root: Who instantly apply themselues vntoo't; Which, with the saile and saile-yard, they soone threw Into the sea. Anth. Why so? Adol. Because they knew, Bee'ng torne, a burthen they might rather call Their sailes, than helpe, (now of no vse at all) For all their hope was in the helme. Anth. Meane space, What did the passengers? Adol. A wretched face Of things you now might see: Some then in place Began to sing, Haile Mary full of Grace; And the blest Virgin Mother to implore: She, who plaine Mary had been call'd before, They now stile, The Seas Star, The Queen of heav'n, The Lady of the world: Titles not giv'n To her in sacred Scriptures. Anth. I indeed Neuer that she at sea was yet could reed. Adol. But Venus (I haue heard) once tooke no scorne To haue the charge of Sailers, (as sea-borne.) But thinking she had quite giv'n vp her care; All their Devotions now directed are In stead of her, a mother, and no maid, Her that was Maid and Mother, to persuade. Anth. Come now you jest. Adol. Some of them prostrat lie Vpon the hatches, and for succor crie Vnto the Storme, and (as had they been mad) pour'd out into the Maine what oile they had; Flattring the raging billowes of the seas, As if some angry pow'r they would appease. Anth. What did they say? Adol. O Sea most mercifull, O generous Sea, ô Sea most beautifull, O you the most rich Channels of the Deepe Saue vs, haue mercy, vs preserue and keepe. Anth. Ridiculous superstition. What the rest? Adol. Their stomacks some disgorg'd; one in his brest Was meditating Vowes. An English man (I well remember) said, O if I can But get to land safe, Pilgrimage I'l frame Vnto the blessed Maid of Walsinghame; And promis'd golden mountaines. Others vow'd To such a Crosse: but that some disallow'd. And nam'd another in a remoat place Thence many countries distant. In like case They with the Virgin Mary dealt, who raignes In sundry Regions: and since need constraines, They pray to her, but thinke they are not heard, Vnlesse they name some Temple to her rear'd. Anth. Vaine were such Orisons, since the Saints dwell In heav'n aboue. Adol. Some said, If they came well And safe to shore, Carthusians they would bee. One promis'd, If the sea he once could free, Bare-foot and bare head, naked saue his shirt, And that of male close to his body girt, Nay, begging all the way, vow'd, steps hee'd tell To where Saint Iames yet liues in Compostell. Anth. Did none thinke of Saint Christopher? Adol. I heard (Not without laughter) one to him indear'd: He in the chiefe Church of Or Paris Lutetia stands, (More like a mountaine than a man) his hands Lift vp: who with a voice strep'rous and loud (That all they in the ship might heare him) vow'd To set before that Saint a waxen Light Big as himselfe. To whom one that fore-right Before him sate, (well knowne to him) reply'd, (After he first had jogg'd him on the side) Take heed friend what you promise; should you sell Your whole estate, which is to me knowne well, You cannot make it good. He then in feare, (Lest him perchance S. Christopher might heare) Answer'd in a low voice, Peace foole, be still, Think'st thou my words are suting to my will; If once I finde safe landing may be had, I'l of a farthing candle make him glad. Anth. O stupid braine! Some Hollander? Adol. None such: He was of Zeeland sure. Anth. I wonder much, None that time of th'Apostle Paul did thinke; (For he was wrackt, and when the ship did sinke, Got to the shore) who knowing shipwracke best, Would soone haue helpt them in that kinde distrest. Adol. Of him there was no mention. Anth. Did they pray? Adol. Yes; and at once some sung, and some did say Haile Virgin: others, their Beleefe: some mutter'd Certaine peculiar pray'rs, as had they vtter'd Soft Magicke spells 'gainst danger. Anth. How distresse Makes men deuout? when they thinke nothing lesse Than of their God, if fortune seeme to smile, Or of his Saints. But what didst thou the while? Vowd'st thou to none of them? Adol. No. Anth. Why? Adol. Because Cov'nants with Saints made, are still with some clause After the forme of Contract: This I giue, If thou performe: If at this time I liue, Then such a thing I'l do; I'l at thy Shrine Offer a Taper, if I scape the Brine; Or if thou keepst me, vnto Rome I'l go On Pilgrimage. Anth. But to none prayd'st thou? Adol. No. Anth. Shew me the cause? Adol. I thought, Heav'n far extended: To any one Saint should I haue commended My safety, say Saint Peter, who bee'ng neare Vnto the doore, most likely was to heare; Before he could haue left the gate, to finde where God was, or deliver'd him my minde, I might haue perisht. Anth. What then didst thou do? Adol. Tooke the next course, and did direct vnto The Father my Deuotions, and began, Father which art in heav'n, &amp;c. I perceiv'd than, None of the Saints could sooner heare, nor any Abler to saue or helpe, though they be many. Anth. Did not thy conscience pricke thee the mean time, Remembring with how many an hainous crime Thou hadst offended him? Adol. Shall I speake true? Part of my confident boldnesse it withdrew; But straight it thus in my conception runne: No Father is so angry with his Sonne, But if he spy him in a brooke or lake, Ready to drowne, hee'l by the haire him take, And plucke him from the danger. 'Mongst the rest, A woman who a childe had at her brest Then sucking, in that feare seem'd troubled least. Anth. And what did she? Adol. Nor clamor loud, nor weepe; Nor promise what she neuer meant to keepe: Only embrac'd her infant, softly pray'd Vnto her selfe, none hearing what she sayd. Meane time the Barke inclining neere the shore, The Master fearing lest she would be tore And split to pieces; her with cables bound From helme to the fore-decke. Anth. Comfort vnsound. Adol. Vp then a sacrificing Priest arose, Ag'd sixty yeares, through doublet and through hose His torne shirt seene, (call'd Adam) who his shooes (That had no soles) cast off, and 'gins to vnloose His wretched habit; bidding all prepare Themselues to swim, who of their liues had care. And standing on the decke, begins to preach Alowd to vs, and out of Gerson teach Five truths; what profit from Confession growes, Wishing we would make ready to dispose Our selues to life or death. Then present there Was a Dominican Frier of looke austere, To whom some few confest themselues. Anth. But what didst thou mean space? Adol. I well perceiuing, that All things were full of tumult, soone confest My selfe to God, 'gainst whom I had transgrest; Blaming mine owne injustice, and commended My selfe to him, whom I had most offended. Anth. Hadst thou then perisht, whither hadst thou gon? Adol. That I committed vnto God alone, As most vnwilling mine owne judge to be: And yet a faire hope did still comfort me. Whilst these things past, the Pilot came againe, With his eies full of teares, and saith, In vaine We striue 'gainst heav'n: each man himselfe prepare; The shaken ship in which distrest we are Cannot the fourth part of an houre well last, At sundry leaks the water poures so fast. Soone after he brings newes he did descry A Chappell afar off: bids vs apply Our pray'rs, the small space that the ship still floated, Vnto that Saint to whom it was deuoted: When suddenly most part are groueling throwne, Deuoutly praying to the Saint vnknowne. Anth. Had they but nam'd him, he would sure haue heard. Adol. But that they knew not. Then the Pilot steard His torne ship that way, ready now to sinke, (Such quantitie of water forc't to drinke) And split she had in pieces in that weather, Had not the cables bound her fast together. Anth. 'Twas an hard case. Adol. It drawing now towards even, Vpon the sudden we so far were driven Towards the coast, that vs th' inhabitants spy'de, And seeing our extremes, call'd out and cry'de; And with their hats vpon their staues end, stand Pointing to vs the safest place to land: Then with their armes stretcht out, seeme to deplore Our wretched case, distrest so neare the shore. Anth. I long to know what happen'd. Adol. Our Barke now Had tooke in so much water, that I vow There hardly any diffrence could be knowne, Because the ship and sea appear'd all one. Anth. To th' holy Anchor it was time to flye. Adol. And yet small comfort, seeing death so nye. The Sailers hoise the boat, and let it downe Into the Sea: then there's a tumult growne, Who should presse soonest in. Some gan t' exclaime, Crying, Why throng you thus? Be rul'd for shame; The Boat 's but small, and were you not thus rude, Vncapable of such a multitude. They bid them search, and what came neerest, get To saue themselues. When now there was no let, But ev'ry one, that which came next him snatches: One lights vpon a piece of the torne hatches: An empty barrell he: another takes A planke: that man a pole: and none but makes Some shift or other: so themselues commit Vnto the sea. Anth. You haue not told me yet, What of the woman and the childe became, She only that was heard not to exclaime. Adol. She got to shore first. Anth. Tell me how that past? Adol. Her to a crooked planke we ty'de so fast, That hardly she could slide thence: in whose hand We put a boord (such as she might command) In stead of a small oare: then hauing prayd For her successe, as she was thereon layd, Expos'd her to the waues, and with a speare, Thrust her from off the ship, which now was neare Hid in the sea, her infant she bestow'd In her left arme, and with her right hand row'd. Anth. A stout Virago. Adal. When nought else remain'd, One snatcheth an old Image, blur'd and stain'd, Part of it eat with rats, which once presented The mother Virgin: and with that contented, Begins to swim. Anth. But came the boat to shore? Adol. They were the first that perisht, none before; For thirty had therein together got. Anth. By what ill chance was that? Adol. 'Twas their hard lot; For e're they from the ship themselues could free, The weake boat split, and sunke immediatly. Anth. A sad disaster: But what then? Adol. I cherisht Others, and had my selfe like to haue perisht. Anth. As how? Adol. I stayd till nothing did appeare Helpfull to swim. Anth. Corke had been vsefull there. Adol. I tell thee Friend, iust at that instant space I'de rather had a Corke tree to embrace, Than a rich golden Candlesticke. About Looking, to spy what best I could finde out, I soone bethought me of the poore remaine Of the split Mast, at which I tugg'd in vaine; And therefore call'd an helper. We combine Our double strength, and both to it incline, Trusting our selues to sea; and in that fright He by the left part holds: I take the right. Thus by the billowes tost, the Predicant, whom I nam'd before, iust at our backs did come, And threw himselfe vpon vs: like an hulke To us he seem'd, being of a mighty bulke. Wherewith much troubled, both aloud 'gan call, Who is that third who meanes to drowne vs all? He gently vs bespake, and bad vs bee Of comfort, there was roome enough for three. Anth. But wherefore did he leaue the ship so late? Adol. He purpos'd in the boat to try his fate With the Dominican Frier; the rest to grace Their Orders, willing to afford them place. But though they both were in the ship confest, Belike forgetting some word 'mongst the rest, They fell to it againe, and somewhat s'ed Laying ones hand vpon the others head: Meane time the boat sunke, by the waues controld: For so much, after, to me Adam told.) Anth. But what of the Dominican became? He, first invoking sundry Saints by name. (So Adam said) did strip himselfe to th' skin; And hauing left his cloathes behinde, leapt in. Anth. What Saints did he invoke? He named (thick, As fast as he could speake) S. Dominick, Saint Thomas, and Saint Vincent, and one Peter, (I know not which) but one she-Saint, with sweeter And fairer words hee'ntreated; and her name, Katherine Senensis, she, it seem'd, the same To whom he trusted most. Anth. I, but Christs aid Implor'd he not at all? Adol. So the Priest said. Anth. Me thinks he better might haue far'd that day, Had he not cast his holy hood away. For being naked like another man, How could the Saint know the Dominican? Touching thy selfe proceed. Adol. Whilst we were tost Neere to the barke, still fearing to be lost, Part of the sterne then floating, burst his thigh, Who held the left part of the mast, whilst I Made good the right: who soone his hold lets slip, And so was drown'd. Into whose place doth skip Adam the Priest, repeating a short prayer That his soule (then departing) well might fare; Exhorting me to be of courage bold, Stretch out my legs, and with my hands keepe hold: Mean time we drunke much brine out of the Ocean, 'Twas not a salt bath only, but salt potion. (So Neptune then would haue it) for which he (Adam I meane) would shew a remedie. Anth. And what was that? Adol. Still as he spy'de the waue To come vpon vs, he himselfe to saue, Oppos'd it with the hinde part of his head, Keeping his mouth fast shut. Anth. I neuer read Of a more stout old fellow. Adol. Floating long, And mouing somewhat onward, he bee'ng strong, And wondrous tall, saith to me, Be of cheare, For by my foot I finde the ground is neare. But I that time more timerous and afraid, (Hoping no such good fortune) to him said, Most certaine we are farther from the shore, Than to hope land. He now incourag'd more, Saith to me, With my foot I touch the sand. Perhaps, said I, some chest driv'n neere the land, Wrought thither by the sea. He affirmes No, And saith, the ground he toucheth with his to. We still were tost, and he againe feeles shore: Do what thou wilt (then said) for here no more I'le trust my selfe, but towards land make hast; So farewell, for I'le leaue thee to thy mast. Then watching when the waue began to breake, With speed pursues it, and no more would speake: But as the billow (shrinking backe) he sees, With either hand embracing both his knees, He waits for it, drencht ouer head and eares, (As Ducks or sea-Birds) and againe appeares When the waue's past, and runnes. Finding his fate So well succeed, I thought to imitate Him in his course: There stood vpon the sands Some people with long javelins in their hands, Men strong and vs'd to stormes; these reacht their staues To ev'ry faint hand that their succor craues. Who catching hold, some by that means they drew Safe to the shore. Anth. How many of that Crew? Adol. Seven only, of which, two brought to the fire, But feeling warmth, did instantly expire. Anth. How many were i'th ship? Adol. Iust fifty eight. Anth. O cruell sea, to ruine such a freight. 'Tmight with the tenths at most haue been suffis'd, Priests aske no more when they are best advis'd. But of so great a number did so few Escape the Wracke? Adol. I speake it who best knew: And there we found a remarkt approbation Of a most generous and indulgent Nation; Who with alacritie and much cheare gaue Harbor, meat, drinke, with all things we could craue. Anth. What country? Adol. Holland. Anth. None I take to bee More generous, fuller of humanitie, Though girt with barbarous countries. But I feare Thou'lt not to sea in haste. Adol. Troth not this yeare, No nor the next: I'le be no more such pray, Vnlesse (quite mad) Heav'n take my wits away. Anth. For such discourses I so little loue them, That I had rather heare them far, than proue them. [The Dialogue of Erasmus, called Procus and Puella] The Argument to Erasmus his Dialogue, entituled Procvs &amp; Pvella. Erasmvs in this Colloquie Expresseth what pure modestie There ought to be 'twixt Man and Maid, When there' s a firme foundation laid Of their affections. His intent Was, how to leaue a president, All wanton Toyes to intercept, That chast Vowes might be made and kept. As well the Prince as Peasant hence May take aduice of consequence. It shewes how true Loue should be plac' t, Forbidding Marriage made in hast: And that the Choice is not confin'd Vnto the Body, but the Minde. His Project further doth imply The honour of the Nuptiall Ty, Which is not lawfull to proceed Before the Parents first agreed. Of the sincere alternate life Which ought to be 'twixt Man and Wife. Next, how their Children should be bred, As both by good Example led, And Precept taught. What ioy, what care The Good and Bad to Parents are. Wedlocke with Single life compar' d, I, and preferr'd in some regard. That in the choice of any Bride 'Tis Reason ought to be the Guide, And not Affection. Here's commixt Sport, with Philosophie: betwixt, Various discourse. The matter's ground Worthy an Author so renown'd. The Speakers, Pamphilvs and Mary. The Dialogve. Pam. Haile to thee, ô thou Cruel, who canst vant Of nothing else saue iron and Adamant. Mar. Haile to thee too (at length) ô Pamphilus, How, and as oft as thou shalt please: but thus Wherfore You should salute me, know I not, It seemes to me my name you haue forgot. Maria I am call'd. Pam. Hadst thou thy right, Thou Martia hadst been nam'd. Mar. I cannot fight, For know I what Mars meanes: Pray wherefore then Ranke you me with that murtherer of men? Pam. Because I hold thee more obdurat far, And thirsting bloud, than is the god of War. He kills for sport, (but such as he doth hate) But thou thy Louers, (Cruell and ingrate.) Mar. Good words I pray; to make me better skil'd. Shew me the strage of those whom I haue kil'd? Or where's the bloud? Pam. One Corse liuelesse and cold Thou look'st vpon when thou dost me behold. Mar. What do I heare? Did any euer know A dead man (like thee) both to speake and go? Should no more terrible Ghosts to me appeare, Trust me I neuer should be strooke with feare. Pa. Thou jest'st with me, and mean time strik'st me dead, And by degrees I'm hourely massacred, Worse than if thou with steele shouldst pierce my brest; For now with lingring death I am opprest. Mar. How many childing women with wet eies Were present to lament your obsequies? Pam. And yet my palenesse argues (to my cost) I am more bloudlesse than a walking Ghost. Mar. And yet that palenesse hath a violets hew: You so looke pale, as we in Summer view The ripening Cherry, and your cheeke is dy'de Like th' Autumne Grape that's purpled on one side. Pam. In sooth you do not well to jeere and flam Me, knowing in what wretched case I am. Mar. If thou beleev'st me not, there's a glasse by, Reach it, and that will speake as much as I. No glasse I wish, no Mirror can allow, Saue that in which I do behold me now. Mar. What Mirror's that you speake of? Pam. Your cleare eies. Mar. You'ar the same Sophister, and still so wise As you were euer: but I pray make't plaine, How you are liuelesse? and by me how slaine? Or is't the use of Shadowes to take meat? Pam. They do (like me) but taste not what they eat. Mar. What is their food? Pam. Leekes, Mallowes, Pulse. Mar. Indeed? But sometimes you on Cocke and Partridge feed. Pam. But to my pallat are as much default As should I feed on sallads without salt. Mar. O miserable man! yet by this light To me Y'appeare fat, fresh, and in good plight: But can the Dead discourse? Pam. Yes, they may speake, But with a voice (like me) low, faint, and weake. Mar. And yet (but lately) when reuenge you vow'd Vpon your Riuall, you spake shrill and lowd. But tell me further, as the Shadowes talke, Are they (like you) apparel'd? Can they walke? Or do they sleepe? Pam. They do, such is their fate: Nay more than that, sometimes subagitate After their kinde. Mar. You trifle finely now: Pam. But will you in your judgement yeeld and bow, If it by Achillean proofes be try'de, That I am dead, and you the homicide? Mar. Far be that Omen from vs: But proceed With that your Sophisme. Pam. First then 'tis agreed, Death's nothing but the absence of the Soule From the fraile body: (none can this controule) And that you'l grant. Mar. Well. Pam. That which you agree, You'l not recall hereafter. Mar. 'T shall not bee. Pam. You'l not deny, That such as take a life From any other, kill? Mar. 'Tis without strife. Pam. You'l likewise yeeld to that approv'd long since By Authors, such as no man can convince, Namely, That from the body the soule moues, And is not where it liues, but where it loues. Mar. Therein th'advantage you of me haue got; Pray make't more plaine, I vnderstand it not. Pam. In that I'm most vnhappy, since I see You are not alike sensible with mee. Mar. Then make me so. Pam. You might with like pretence Bid me to teach the Adamant to haue sence. Mar. I am a Maid, not stone. Pam. And yet most sure, Than th' hardest Adamant y' are more obdure. Mar. Well, recollect your selfe. Pam. (Though to be'admir'd) All that with divine Raptures are inspir'd. 'Tis said, nor heare, nor smell, nor see, nor feele, Although you wound them with transpiercing steele. Mar. So I haue heard. Pam. Know you the cause? Mar. Not I: Explaine it you who reade Philosophy. Pam. Because the Soule's in heav'n, when't doth affect, And absent from the flesh in that respect. Mar. What then? Pam. What then? thou Cruel? why this makes it plain, Thou art the Murdresse: I the man new slain. Mar. Where's then thy soule? Pam. Why where it loues? Mar. But who Hath tooke it from thee? Wherefore sigh'sts thou so? Speake freely, and vncheckt? Pam. One cruell, yet She whom in death I neuer shall forget. Mar. Y' are witty: But (my rare Philosopher) Why likewise take you not a soule from her, Repaying like with like? Pam. Nor thinke it strange; Nothing could proue more happy than such change, And make me more essentially blest, Then myne in hers, if hers in myne would rest. Mar. Shall I haue leaue (as thou but late with me) That I may play the Sophister with thee? Pam. The Sophistresse. Mar. Can it with probabilitie be sed, That the same body is alive and dead? Pam. But not at the same time. Mar. The soule confine, The bodie's dead, nor canst thou call it thine. Pam. I grant. Mar. Nor quickens but when 'tis in place. Pam. Well, be it so. Mar. Speake then, how stands the case? That being where it liues, in former state, It keepes the body, whence it shifted late; Or where it elsewhere liues, if it giue breath, How can it (whilst it liues) be taxt of death? Pam. In Sophistrie I see well skil'd you are, Yet can I easily euade this snare. The Soule which doth the liuing body sway, Vnproperly (me thinks) title you may A soule, when those that do the men controule, Are truly some small reliques of the soule, And nothing else. As when you take a Rose, And smell to it, howeuer you dispose Of the floure after: being gon againe, The sent thereof will on your hand remaine. Mar. I see they onely shall lost labor win, Who seeke to catch an old Fox in a gin: But there is one thing more that I demand, And I from you would gladly vnderstand; Doth not he act, that's staind with murthers gilt? And suffer not all such whose blouds are spilt? Pam. Most true. Mar. How comes it then, when as the Wooer In this case may be said to be the doer, And she that's woo'd, the Patient (which is plaine, And stiffely to oppose it were but vaine) She that's belov'd, no such intent pursuing, Should not be that? he cause of his owne ruin. Pam. Quite contrarie: he (we see daily prov'd) Suffer, who loues: she acts that is belov'd. Mar. The Areopagitæ (Grammar-skil'd) In this cannot evince me. Pam. Y'are selfe-will'd: Yet shal th' Amphictriones by Logicke doo't. Mar. There's one doubt, prethee answer me untoo't; Whether is this your loue free, or constrain'd? Pam. Most willingly I loue, though thus disdain'd. Mar. Since not to loue, men likewise haue free-will, Who euer loues, doth aime himselfe to kill: And the inditement well against him laid, 'Twere great injustice to accuse the Maid. Pam. She is not said the Louer to haue slaine, Because belov'd, but not to loue againe. For all such persons may be said to stay, Who can preserue, and will not when they may. Mar. Say a yong man vnlawfully should dote Vpon a Vestall, from the world remote; Or cast his eye vpon anothers wife: Must these lie prostrat, to preserve his life? Pam. But where this yong man his affection vowes, The act both Law and Pietie allowes, And yet is slaine. But if that murther hee A sinne that doth appeare so sleight to thee. I can of Witchcraft challenge thee. Mar. O fie! Witchcraft? Forbid it you blest Pow'rs on hye: Wouldst thou make me a Circes? Pam. I divine, Thou art worse far, because a Beare or Swine I' de rather bee, than as thou seest me now, Sencelesse and without life. Mar. Pray tell me how, Or by what kinde of Witchcraft do I kill? Pam. By fascination. Mar. Is it then thy will I turne my noxious eies from thee? Pam. Not so, But rather let them still dwell here. Mar. Fie no, If in myne eies there be effascination, How comes it there is no such alteration In others I behold? Now I diuine, The witchcraft's not in mine eies, but in thine. Pam. Is't not enough, thy vow'd friend to transperse, But thou wilt still insult upon his herse? Mar. O pleasant dead man, that can talke so free: But I pray speake, When shall thy funerall bee? Pam. Sooner than thou do'st deeme, (I am afraid) Vnlesse thou suddenly afford'st me aid. Mar. Can I worke such a wonder? Pam. Thou mayst doo A greater act, and with small labour too, Restore the Dead to life. Mar. Had I the weed Call'd Panaces. Pam. Of Simples there's no need: Onely repay my loue, that's void of lust, (Than which, what thing more easie, or more iust) There's nothing else can thee of murther cleere. Mar. But at what bar shall I be call'd to appeare? Before the Areopagitæ? Pam. No, But at the bar of Venus. Mar. Those that know That goddesse, say shee's placable. Pam. So ye'haue heard; But there is none to be more dread and feard. Mar. Carrieth she lightning? Pam. Not. Mar. Or doth she beare A Trident? Pam. Neither. Mar. Doth she vse a speare? Pam. Not any: but shee's goddesse of the seas. Mar. I do not vse to saile. Pam. But more than these; She hath a Boy. Mar. His age can none affright. Pam. But hee's peruerse, reuengefull, and of might. Mar. What can he do to me? Pam. What can he? All The gods forbid, that you should prostrat fall Beneath his fury: loth would I presage Ill vnto her, to whom my selfe I'engage. Mar. I am not superstitious, speake thy minde. Pam. I shall: If thou hereafter prov'st vnkinde, Or shalt appeare so peevish or so fond To one whose loue with thine may correspond: Should such a sute to Venus be commenc'd By her the Boy would be so much insenc'd, To aime a shaft in Stiptick poison dipt, By which thy hard brest on the sudden ript, It shall besot thee on some sordid Swaine, Which shall thy loue repay with cold disdaine. Mar. An horrid punishment thou talkst of, I A thousand times had rather wish to die, Than perditly to'affect one base and vile, And he his heart towards me not reconcile. Pam. Yet of a Virgin subiect to like fate There hath been knowne a sad example late. Mar. What place? Pam. Aurelia. Mar. Since how many yeares? Pam. How many moneths you would say, Still appeares The lamentable ruine, and the fame Is loud and frequent. Mar. Speake, what was her name? Why dost thou pause? Pam. I know her even as well As I do thee. Mar. Then why dost thou not tell What her name is? Pam. 'Tis for the Omens sake. Which doth not please me: I wish she could take Some other name vpon her. You may gather What hers is, by your owne. Mar. Who was her father? Pam. A man of qualitie, and one that liues Amongst the Lawyers, vnto whom he giues No common luster. Mar. I am now ambitious To know what his name is. Pam. Hee's cal'd Mauritius: Mar. But his syrname? Pam. Aglaius. Mar. Liues her mother? Pam. No, but of late chang'd this life for another. Mar. But of what sicknesse dy'de she? Pam. Wouldst thou know? Of sorrow, that her childe was shipwrackt so. Her father too, of valour prov'd and try'de, Did little want but of conceit had dy'de. Mar. How was her mother styl'd, pray tell me true? Pam. I will: Sophronia: one that none but knew. But what meane all these questions? do you thinke I speake a thing that's forg'd? Mar. It cannot sinke Into my head: you rather may suspect Our sex for that, since fables we affect. But say, what hapned to her then? Pam. The Maid Was borne in honest place, as I then said, Of happy dower, and amiable feature: Why should I hold you long? She was a creature Fit for a Princes bed; and sought by one Then euery way her equall: there was none More meriting. Mar. How call'd? Pam. The Omen doth offend: yet thus Receiue his name, he was calld Pamphilus: Who though he prov'd all possible waies to win her, Yet save disdaine, when he found nothing in her, Griefe wasted him away: when she soone after Doated vpon a Groome compos'd for laughter; Whom you might rather call an Ape than Man. Mar. What is't you say? Pam. So poorely, that I can Scarce giue thereof expression. Mar. She so faire, To dote on one deformed? Pam. Thin his haire, Besides, disorderd and vnkembd, his crowne Picked, made steeple-wise, and ouergrowne With scurfe and dandruffe; bald he was beside, Extremely squint-eyd, and his nosthrils wide And bending vpward, with a mouth most spacious, His teeth both gagg'd and furr'd, his tongue vngratious, Stammering at every word; a scabbed chin, And easily seene, because his beard was thin; Crookt-backt, gow-bellied, bending at the knee His legs. Mar. Thersites thou describ'st to me. Pam. Nay more; They say he hath but one eare left. Mar. Perhaps the tother was in war bereft. Pam. Most sure 'twas lost in peace. Mar. Such an affront What's he durst giue him? Pam. Now I thinke vpon't, It was the hangman. Mar. Notwithstanding this, Perhaps what in his feature is amisse, His substance may make good. Pam. But hee's no better Than a meere Bankrupt, one that is a debter Of his owne soule, and he hath pawnd it oft. And yet she that's so tender, smooth, and soft, Doth with this Monster bosome, drinke, and eat; Nay, at his churlish hands is oft times beat. Mar. A wretched tale, if truly understood. Pam. And yet so Venus. Nemesis hath thought it good. Most true it is, nor could the goddesse long Defer due vengeance for the yong mans wrong. Mar. Than such a monster of a man to brooke, I rather wish here to be thunder-strooke. Pam. Then let not Nemesis be iustly mov'd, Provoke her not, love where thou art belo'vd. Mar. Would that suffice, with all my soule I'de doo't. Pam. Speake not the word, vnlesse thou stand vntoo't. I wish moreouer, That your love may be Lasting, and only proper vnto me. A wife, no mistresse, I haue now in chase. Mar. I do not doubt it: yet in such a case, When as our vowes continue with our fate, Behooues vs long time to deliberate. Pam. I haue long enough consider'd. Mar. Lest you erre, Take heed, for Love's but a bad Counseller, And as they say, hee's blinde. Pam. Blinde love I scorne; But that love sees, which is of judgement borne. Thou dost not therefore seeme to me so faire, Because I loue thee; but I therefore dare To love thee, since thou art as thou appear'st. Mar. And yet beware how you esteeme me dearest: When you pull on your shoo you best may tel In what part it doth chiefely pinch you. Pam. Well, Dice must be cast for that, I and the rather, Because by many Auguries I gather. Things better may succeed. Mar. An Augur too? Pam. I am. Mar. But what can your sooth-saying doo? Saw you the night-Crow flie? Pam. 'T had been in vaine; Shee onely flies to such as haue no braine. Mar. Or did you see two Turtles take their flight Either vpon the left hand or the right? Pam. Tush these are toyes: yet one thing I haue seene, And long time markt; The goodnesse that hath beene Deriv'd vnto you, nor doth it foretell Any bad Omen, to be borne so well; Nor forreigne vnto me were their conditions, Or with how many wholsome admonitions Thy education from the first hath bin, With faire examples free from sight of sin. “And better 'tis (the Dowrie to adorne) “To haue one well instructed, than well borne. There is another Augurie beside: My Ancestors (I speake it not in pride) Are not of meanest ranke, and in times past With thine made league, which to this day doth last. And that, not vulgar, from our cradles wee Haue knowne each other; but to disagree Were neuer knowne: there is a parity In our two yeares; in the nobility, Riches, and honour of our parents. More, (Which in this match I should haue plac'd before) Your sweet indowments and behauiour rare Did in all points with my condition square: But whether myne with yours haue suted well In correspondence, that I cannot tell. These are the Birds which I observ'd to flie, Predicting only by their Augurie. And these presage a marriage to ensue, Happy and blest, nay alwaies seeming new. Vnlesse from your most delicate warbling throat Should now proceed some harsh vnpleasing noat To crosse my hopes. Mar. Say, What song do you wish? Pam. I will begin, now answer you to this, 'Tis but two words, and they soone learnd; I am thine: Now echo vnto me, and sing, Thou myne. Mar. 'Tis a short song, and hath as short a theme, And yet it beares a long Epiphoneme. Pam. What matters it how long, so it be sweet. Mar. And yet I should be loth, as we now meet, That I to any motion should consent, Of which perhaps in time you may repent. Pam. O cease to boad vs ill. Mar. I may grow strange, When age or sicknesse shall my beauty change. Pam. Craz'd or in health, thou shalt to me be one, Equall in both, so deare vnto me none. I gaze not on this building, rare and neat; The guest within I loue. Mar. What guest I'entreat? Pa. Thy mind, whose splendor with thy yeres doth grow. Mar. He'had need of more than Lynceus eyes, that so Can through so many roofes at once espy. Pam. Thy minde by myne I see perspicuously. To adde to these, we in our children may, As we wax old, grow yonger euery day. Mar. I, but Virginitie meane time is lost. Pam. Tell me, if you your selfe had layd great cost Vpon an Orchard, you would thinke it sin, Should nothing else but bare floures grow therein: Had you not rather (all the floures bee'ng cropt) To see the trees full branches vnderpropt, Laden with ripe fruit? Mar. O, you argue fine. Pam. Or answer me: To see a drooping Vine Falne, and there putrifying where 'tis laid? Or see one by her owne kinde claspings staid; And round about some faire growne Elme to run, Whilst her full clusters ripen 'gainst the Sun? Which is the goodlier sight? Mar. Now answer me: Which of the two sights had you rather see: A milke white Rose still shining in its thorne: Or cropt, and in some durty bosome worne, To lose her faire leaves? Pam. As I vnderstand, That Rose is happier, gatherd by the hand, And withers, after it doth both delight The nose with the sweet smell, the eye with sight. Rather than that which giues no more content, Than to the Brier forfeit both leaues and sent. It grew for use, first to be gathered, then To wither after. So the wine that men At merry meetings jovially downe poure, Is happier far, than what (vndrunke) growes soure. Nor is the Virgin floure maturely growne, Blasted as soone as cropt. Some I haue knowne, Before their marriage languish and looke sickly, Who after congresse haue recover'd quickly, As if they had but then begun to spring. Mar. And yet Virginitie (you know's a thing) Gracious and plausible to all. Pam. 'Tis true, Than a yong Virgin, nothing to the view More gratefull: but what object can there bee Worse, than an old and wrinkled maid to see? Vnlesse thy mother had let fall her floure, Thy blossome had not flourisht at this houre. And if our future marriage (as I hope) Do not proue barren, we shall then haue scope, Though that Virginitie be lost and gone, To yeeld the world a many for that one. Mar. And yet pure chastitie 's a thing (they say) To God most gratefull. Pam. And I therefore pray, Hee'l send me a chast Virgin to my wife, With whom to leade a chast vnquestion'd life: And by that means shall grow the greater Tye, Of mindes, then bodies; so shall you and I Get to the publique weale, to Christ beget. Then how far distant is this wedlocke set From true Virginitie: it may so fall, That we in time may proue as conjugall As Ioseph liv'd with Mary. Meane time wee Shall practise 'twixt our selues a chastitie, To whose sublimitie none can come neare, Vpon the sudden. Mar. What is this I heare? Must chastitie be violated, and Then after learnd? Pam. What else? (Pray vnderstand) As when by drinking of a lesser draught, We, by degrees, abstemiousnesse are taught: In this affaire with vs so stands the state. Which of the two hold you more temperate; He at a full and furnisht table plac't, And of no tempting delicate will tast; Than he, remov'd from all that might accite, Or any way prouoke his appetite? Mar. I hold him of a temp'rance far more great, Who, when beset with dainties, will not eat. Pam. In case of Chastitie which stand you for? Him that hath made himselfe an Eunuch; or One that is able bodied, strong, and sound, And yet in whom there's no intemperance found? Mar. Vpon the last I dare bestow the Bayes; On the first, madnesse, and no other praise. Pam. All such as by the strictnesse of their Vow, No matrimoniall Contract will allow, What do they else but gueld themselues? Mar. You say't. Pam. It is not vertue, not to copulate. Mar. How is it not? Pam. Obserue me: If it were A vertue in it selfe, not to cohere; It must be then a vice to hauecongresse. But that to be most lawfull we may guesse, By mutuall consocietie. Againe, Marriage is honorable. Mar. Make it more plaine, Why you infer this? Pam. Since so oft it falls: As, to the louing wife the husband calls For due benevolence; it only beeing For issues sake. Mar. But say there's disagreeing, When it proceeds from wantonnesse and lust; Then, to deny him, is't not right and iust? Pam. Rather admonish and intreat him faire; That you may do: howeuer, bound you are To yeeld to him, beeing instant. In that straine Scarce heare I husbands of their wives complaine. Mar. But libertie is sweet. Pam. Yet further heare; Virginitie 's a weighty load to beare. But I thy King, and thou my Queen shalt bee; Wee'l rule and reigne in our owne family: Can that appeare to thee a servitude? Mar. But I haue oft heard marriage, by the rude And Vulgar, calld an Halter that fast ties. Pam. All those that sacred mariage so despise, Are of an halter worthy. This decide: Is not thy Minde vnto thy Body ty'de? Mar. It seemes to be so. Pam. Even iust as you see A Bird incage'd; whom aske to be set free, He will deny 't: and wherefore? Can you tell? Because her bondage doth content her well. Mar. Our means are but indifferent. Pam. Therefore more Safe. The best way then to encrease our store, Is your good houswifery at home, whilst I Abroad will vse my vtmost industry. Mar. But many children still bring many cares. Pam. And many pleasures too: I haue knowne heires, For all the troubles and vncessant feares, The cost and charge that in their tender yeares They haue put their parents to; being growne men, Haue payd them backe with double vse agen. Mar. A miserable thing it were, I vow, To haue had children, then to lose them. Pam. Now, Are you not childelesse? But at no good rate, Of doubtfull things thus ill you ominate. Which wish you rather to your lot might fall, Be borne to die, or not be borne at all? Mar. Why of the two, borne (as I am) to die. Pam. So much more wretched is that Orbitie And deprivation, which yet never had, Or euer shall haue issue; (to make glad) As they more happy are, borne to the earth, Than they, nor borne, nor euer to haue birth. Mar. But who are they that are not, nor shall be? Nay heare me yet a little further: He Who humane frailties shall refuse to beare, (To which even all men while they sojourne here, Are equally obnoxious; keepe the State, Or be they low degreed) must yeeld to Fate. But as for thee, let come what can betide; For thou shalt beare but halfe, I will divide The burthen with thee: nay, the greater share I'le cast on myne owne shoulders, (in my care) But so, that in each joyfull accident Doubled shall be thy pleasure in th'event. If ought disastrous; my societie may Take (of the griefe) the greatest part away: And for your selfe (did but the Fates so please) I wish on me no greater joy might sease, Nor would I further happinesse desire, Than in thy sweet embraces to expire. M. That which by Natures common course doth chance, You men disgest with easiest countenance. But I see with some parents how it fares, In whom their childrens manners breed more cares, Than can their deaths. Pam. But please you be content, It lies in vs that danger to prevent. Mar. As how? Pam. I'le make it plaine; because we see Neuer bad Fruit proceed from a good Tree, As touching the condition, Nor is 't read, That ravenous Kytes of gentle Doves are bred. Let vs first study goodnesse; then provide, That from the milke we may their youth so guide, By holy precepts and good admonitions, That we may rectifie their bad conditions: 'Tis of great consequence, what is infus'd Into a Vessell when it first is vs'd. Adde to the rest, in our domesticke state, Examples, such as they may imitate. Mar. 'Tis hard you speake. Pam. No wonder, because faire; And that's some reason why so hard you are. But the more difficult it seemes to be, 'Twill aske from vs the greater industry. Mar. Me of a pliant mettall you shall finde; See then you cast and shape me to your minde. Pam. Pronounce three words in th' interim. Mar. 'Twere small paine; But words once past, fly neuer backe againe. I'le giue you counsell, and consider of it, Which may no doubt redownd to both our profit. Solicite you our parents to this match, They once agreed, we would make quicke dispatch. Pam. You would haue me, the bush to beat about, When in three words you may resolue this doubt. Mar. Whether I can, is yet to me vnknowne, Because I am my parents, not myne owne: Neither did Contracts in times past proceed, Vnlesse by th'Elders they were first agreed. But howsoever, I presume, 'twixt us This match will proue the more auspitious, Lesse casuall too, to both, and much more sweet. If by our parents free consents we meet. To move them in't, your office 'tis, you know, Because in me it comely would not show: Virginitie loves to be forc't; maids still, What they giue freely, grant against their will. Pam. Before I moue them, shall I thus indent; May I presume I haue your free consent? Mar. Thou hast, my Pamphilus, then be of cheare. Pam. Y'are now to me religiously deare. Mar. But your owne voice I'de wish you stil suspend, And e're begin, consider first the end. Do not Affection vnto Counsell call, But summon Reason, which should governe all: For what Affection swayes is apt to vary, And is (indeed) no more than temporarie: But that which Reason dictates, be thou sure, Is permanent, and euer shall endure. Pam. How sweetly play you the Philosopher? And I shall no way from your counsels err. Mar. It shall not much repent you. But againe, There is one doubt that much distracts my braine. Pam. Now let all scruples vanish. Mar. Is't your will I marry to a dead man? Pam. I live still, Reviv'd by you. Mar. The scruple is remov'd; And now at length, farewell my best Belov'd. Pam. Be that your care. Mar. I wish you a glad night. Whence came that deepe suspire? Pam. From no affright. A glad night did you say? Now as I live, What you last wisht, would you had will to giue. Mar. It is not fit that too much haste be made, For yet you see your harvest's in the blade. Pam. Shall I beare nothing from you? Mar. This sweet-Ball, Take it to cheare your heart. Pam. A kisse withall. Mar. By no meanes, since to bring thee, I desire, A chastitie vnblemisht and intire. Pam. Can that detract from modestie? Mar. Desist: Or would you I by others should be kist? Pam. Reserue them then, as these you solely owe To me and to my use. Mar. I'le keepe them so: Yet I could tell you of another cause Wherefore I dare not kisse. Pam. Speake't without pause. Mar. You say, your whole soule, or the greater part Is fled into my body; and your heart Empty'd of vitall heate, (or little there Remaining still) it therefore is my feare, Lest by a kisse, the little which is left, I drawing, you be quite of life bereft. But take this hand, symbole of that affection Which mutually confirmes our free election. So once againe farewell: be for my sake Carefull (I intreat) in that you undertake. Mean time I'le pray, what yet remaines vndone, May in a faire and prosp'rous course be run. The Annotations upon Procus and Puella. In this Dialogue (to whose Author I am not able to give a meriting character) I presume there is nothing conteined which doth deviate either from modesty or good manners. It is onely a meere expression, of what is, or ought to be, betwixt a young man and a maide, in the initiating of their affection, the prosecution of their love, and the perfecting of their contract. Here is neither childish discourse, loose language, or any impertinency, which is not agreeable, with wholsome instance, and commendable example. For in all marriages there is to bee observ'd, Parity in birth. For as Dion saith: Disparity in Wedlock is a great enemie to love: then conformity in education, and lastly equality in state. The first begetteth acquaintance, the second confirmeth it, and for the last we read Euripides thus: women without dowry cannot claime the priviledge to speake their owne thoughts: And Menander saith: That man is most unhappy who marrieth being poore, and raiseth his fortunes by a rich maide or widdow. But howsoever marriage in it selfe is honorable: in so much that Homer informeth us, That the Ladyes of Greece, used to count their yeares from the time of their Nuptials, not the day of their Nativity, as forgetting all the time of their virginity, and intimating, they were never to bee said truely to live, till they came to that state, legally to lend life unto others, which was by lawfull wedlock. Imagine then this our Pamphilus prov'd an happy husband, and Maria a fortunate wife: He a provident Father, and shee the fruitfull mother of a numerous and thriving issue. They blest in their children, and their children alternatly in them: For so it (for the most part) hapneth in all such contracts. Where vertue over-ruleth vanity, and reason swayeth passion and affection. Of him I may say with Boethius, lib. 2. Metr. 8. Hic &amp; conjugij sacrum Castis nectit amoribus. With the sacred Nuptiall tye, His chast love did well comply. And to doe her the best right I can, I make bold to borrow thus much from the Poet Statius, lib. Silvar. 5. Si Babylonis opes, Lydæ si pondera gazæ Indorumqued ares, &amp;c. If thou the Babylonian wealth shouldst proffer, Or rifle (for her) the rich Lydians coffer; The potent wealth couldst thou before her lay, From India brought; or that from Affrica? Yet rather then transgresse her nuptiall vow, She would choose death not caring where, nor how. Et quo non possum corpore, mente feror. [The Dialogue of Ravisius Textor, called Earth and Age] The Argument of the Dialogue betwixt Earth and Age. In Earth and Age is to the life exprest, How bad all Men are, when they are at best: How fraile, how fading, and in their great'st glory Unsettled, wretched, vaine, and transitory. It shewes all Learning, Beauty, Youth, and Strength, All Pompe, all Wealth to nothing comes at length: No Statue, Structure, Trophee, so sublime, Which is not quite lost and defac' t by Time. O who can then our common Earth. Parent blame, Since all things she produceth that haue name, As they haue birth from her still-teeming wombe, So the same place is likewise made their tombe. No wonder then her griefe so far exceeds, Since she is forc't to bury all she breeds. The Dialogue. Earth. What's he so many tongues can me allow, As he had eies who watcht the Meaning Io transformed into a Cow, by Iupiter (who had before stuprated her) to conceale her from the jealousie of his wife Iuno: the whole story you may read in the Dialogue intituled Iupiter and Io: shee lived in the yeare of the world 2200. according to Hel. Pharian Cow? So many mouthes to me who's he can give, As Fame reports the The Sibils were in number ten. Persica, Libyca, Delphica, Erithræa, Samia, Hellespontiaca, Tiburtina, Albinœca, Cumæa, Cumana: of these you may read Varro, Gellius, Augustin, Suidas, and Lactantius. And of the long life of Cumana, Virgil in his Æneids. Sybels yeares did live? Had I as many words my thoughts to expresse, As (by th' Ascræan, so titled from Ascra a Towne in Boetia, neare unto the mount Helicon, where the famous Poet Hesiod was borne, from which place hee had the sirname Ascræus. Ascræan Poet) we may guesse, The antient gods liv'd dayes? Had I beside, As many brasen throats open and wide, As Xerxes shot darts, (after fight begun) Whose number from the earth shadow'd the Sun? So many rivulets of teares what's hee Can to myne eyes infuse, as was by thee Cyrus (if we may trust antiquity) Let into Ganges drops, thereby to breed Dry waste vnto that King Cyrus, because he had a Steed whom he much loved, drowned in the river Ganges: to be revenged therof, caused so many currents to bee cut, that hee dryed the Channell. Channell drown'd his steed? Who can my clamorous words supply with sorrow? So many deepe suspires where shall I borrow; As Valiant Roman Spirits (scorning to yeeld) fell in one fatall day at It hath reference to the great battaile fought by Hannibal against the Romanes neare unto the Village Cannas, where he slew 80. thousand in that one conflict: from thence the people of Italy are call'd Cannenses. Canna's field? O my great griefe, which in the height appeares, Not to be calm'd with words, nor washt with teares. When Concerning the History of Phaeton, and his sisters, I referre you to the reading of Ovid, where it is with great elegancy described. Metamorph. Phaeton fell from the Sunnes bright throne, How did his mournfull sisters him bemoane? Who from their rough rindes where they be inclos'd, Weepe pretious Amber still. Phœbus, oppos'd 'Gainst You may read the like of Niobe the daughter of Tantalus, and wife to Pelops: who had sixe Sonnes, and sixe Daughters, all which Latona the mother to Apollo and Diana, (in whom are figured the Sunne and the Moone) caused to be slaine, for the pride of Niobe, who presumed to compare with her: for griefe whereof shee lost her speech, and remained stupid and without motion, which gave the Poets occasion to feigne that she was changed into a marble statue. Calvis. reporteth that shee lived in the yeare of the world, 2240. Niobe, (her children hauing slaine) O how she still in marble doth complaine? What sorrow, musicall Orpheus, didst thou feele, When thy Euridice was the wife of Orpheus, who flying from Aristheus who would have ravished her, was stung with a Serpent, of which she dyed. Orpheus tooke his harpe, And went to Hell for her, and by his excellent Musick so far wrought with Pluto and Proserpine, that they suffered him to beare her thence, but upon condition, that he should not looke backe upon her till hee had past the infernall shades, and came to the upper light, which through his over love hee breaking, so lost her. The fable is thus moralliz'd, Euridice signifieth the soule of man, and Orpheus the body to which the soule is married. Aristæus is true happinesse which would gladly ravish the soule, but shee flying through grassy fields and medowes, is at length stung to death by a Serpent, that is, by the blandishments of immoderate pleasure: she then descends into Hell, which implyes dull and deepe melancholy, with the trouble of a perplext conscience, where shee is rescued by comfortable musick. But so, that unlesse shee submit herselfe to the rule of reason, shee shall quickly fall againe into the same agony: she lived in the yeare 1700. according to Natal Comes. Euridice, stung in the heele, And dying, borne vnto th' infernall shade, Thou with thy harp through hell free passage made? What more than madnesse did corrode thy brest, Andromache? when (Hector layd to rest) Thou saw'st thy Astianax was the Sonne of Hector and Andromache, who after the taking of Troy, was by the Grecians precipitated from an high tower and so slaine. sonne, the hope of Troy and thee, Dropt from a tower: what sorrow might this bee? Ev'n such was thine, Ægeus was the Sonne of Neptune, and King of Athens, in whose raigne King Minos of Creete to revenge the death of his Sonne Androgeus, made most cruell warre on the Athenians, forcing them yearely to send seven Noblemens Sonnes into Creete to bee devoured by the monster Minotaurus. Three yeares this continued, and in the fourth the lot (amongst others fell upon Thesius, the elect Sonne of the King, who being of a noble and heroick courage, put them in great hope that he was able to kill the monster: At his departure his father injoyn'd him, that if the ship hee went in returned prosperously he should set up a white flagge in token of victory, and pluck downe the black one which they then bore in signe of mourning. But after when Theseus by the counsell of Ardiane daughter to King Minos had overcome the monster, and with a clew of thread escaped the labyrinth, sayling homewards againe with joy towards his Country, he forgot his fathers commandement concerning the white flagge. The old King much longing to see the safe returne of his sonne, used every day to ascend an high promontory, which overlooked the Sea, to take view of all such ships as past that way, at length knowing his sons shippe, and seeing the same sable flagge in the top, with which they first launched from that shoare, supposed hee had beene dead, and therefore surcharged with griefe, cast himselfe headlong from the rocke into the Sea, which was after cald by his name Ægeum mare. He lived in the 48. yeere after Athens was first made a Kingdome; and in the yeare of the world 2680, about the time that Gedeon judged Israel. Aegæus, to behold Thy sonnes blacke sailes returning: which so cold Strook to thy heart, thou thinking Theseus slaine, Leapt from a rocke, and gav'st the sea thy name. The torment of a mighty passion thou Iocaste was the mother of Oedipus, who after her first husbands death marryed with him, being her owne naturall sonne, (but not knowing so much) by him shee had Eteocles and Polynices, who in a single combat slew one another, and they also dyed miserably. Iocasta felt, to see thy two sonnes vow Their mutuall ruines by revengefull Armes? Sad Dedalus was the sonne of Micion borne in Athens, the most excellent Artificer of these times. He made the Labyrinth into which Minos put him, and his sonne Icarus, at length having got feathers and wax, he made thereof artificiall wings for himselfe and his sonne, and so flew from Crete into Sardinia, and thence to Cuma, where he built a Temple to Apollo, but Icarus in the way soared so high, that the beames of the Sunne, melted the wax, and his wings failing him, by that disaster he fell into the Sea, from it hath still retained the name of Mare Icarium, the Icarian Sea, according to that of Ovid. Icarus Icarijs nomina fecit aquis. Dædalus, what pittifull alarmes Were in thy brest giv'n, to behold from hye, Thy sonne with his feint wings drop from the skie? There to be food for fishes, and to adde A name vnto that sea, it neuer had? Or should I speake how much Progne was the daughter to King Pandion, who because her husband Tereus King of Thrace, had ravished her sister Philomela, and after cut out her tongue, she having notice thereof, in a barbarous revenge, at a feast dedicated to Bacchus: slew her son Itis, and after drest his limbs, and served them up to her husbands table, &amp;c. She lived about the yeare of the world 2510. according to Helv. Progne lamented Her husbands spowse-breach? or how discontented Autonoë, was the daughter of Cadmus and Hermione, who much lamented the death of Acteon. Anthonoë was after Actæon torne? Or of Antigone, was daughter of Oedipus King of Thebes, who when her blind father was banished, tooke upon her to leade him, and afterwards being at the buriall of her two brothers Eteocles and Polynices with Argia, was slaine by the command of King Creon, whose murder Theseus soone after revenged. Antigone, sad and forlorne, Leading blinde Oedipus o're rocks along? Within the compasse of my passionate song Bring all the torments of the former age, Gyves, Manacles, and Fetters, all that Rage Or Fury can inflict; want, hunger, thirst, Whip, post, or prison, labor, or what's worst, The melancholy dungeon, gallows, racke, The forke or stake, what on the homicides backe Law can impose, the Traitor or the Theefe; All these are toyes, if rated at my griefe. By stings of Serpents, or their teeth, to die; Rough winter gusts, where Boreas blowes most hye: A thousand wounds were nothing to endure, Or mounted on a gybbet, there chain'd sure, And liue to gorge the Ravens, or to bleed Beneath the Lyons jawes; after to feed Her whelps, were nothing.

If whatsoever I produce or cherish, Procreate or beare, I see before me perish? Is it not wondrous, Forrests should at length Bide putrifaction, rot, and lose their strength? The shadowie tree Time of her beauty 'reaves, Despoiling her both of her fruit and leaves. Age. 'Tis wondrous I confesse, but so 't must bee. Earth. What is it then, that I behold and see The brazen statues of the gods decay, The monuments of Princes turne to clay; Mighty Collossæ vel Colossis, was a towne of Phrygia, neare unto Laodicea, which was demolisht by an earth-quake in the time of Nero. Colossi, Temples deckt with Vaines, Supported with rich Columnes (by the braines Of the best Architects) made wide and large, With spacious arches, sacred, in the charge Of many a golden Relique: these to fall, And in a few short seasons perish all. Age. So it hath pleas'd the gods. Earth. The gods are then Too cruell and austere to vs and men; Since whatsoeuer the Earths fertile wombe Brings forth to aire, and in the world to have roome; Whatever in her bosome she hath ta'ne To feed and foster: what doth now remaine, Or shall hereafter be? That all these must Needs be involv'd in rottennesse and dust. Age. 'Tis fit. Earth. O anguish never to abate, Or have cessation! Age. So the gods will ha't. Earth. Then, as I said before, th'are too severe, And mercilesly in this kinde austere. Is't not enough strong walls are beaten downe, And lofty turrets level'd with the ground; Cities are sackt, to ruine made a pray, The famous statues of the gods decay; That rust the iron doth consume and waste, And pleasant Orchards of corruption taste; But Man must perish too, and cannot shun Times fearefull havocke, but to ruine run? Age. The Fates so will. Earth. What pitty can there be Ascrib'd to any pow'rfull deity? But what art thou? What goddesse? or how styl'd? Age. Age I am call'd. Earth. Hence false Virago, vyld Infernall Fury; for 'tis thou alone Bringst all my Issue to confusion: Swift feather-footed Time and ravenous Age Devour all things in their remorselesse rage. Age.

Say Tyrannesse, thou Age, consuming all, Where be those high Pyramides so fam'd, By which the barbarous Memphis was built by King Ogdous, and tooke name of his daughter (so called) it is a great and spacious City in Egypt, famous for the Pyramides and stately sepulchers of King there set up: it is at this day called Alcayrum, or Grand-Cayre.

Where 's Pharos Isle? the Sepulchre renownd Of King Mausolus, was King of Caria, to whose memory his wife Artimesia reared a most sumptuous Tombe which was reckoned one of the seven wonders of the world, this Monument was reared in the yeare of the world 3590.

Strumpet tell me. Age. Gone. Earth. Where's the Tarpeian alludeth to Tarpeia, a Vestall virgin in Rome, who covenanting with the Sabines their enemies, to betray the Capitoll, for the bracelets they wore on their left armes, when they entred the City, and she stood ready to receive that which she had contracted for, in stead of their bracelets, they cast their Targets upon her, by which she was smothered and pressed to death: this happened in the yeare of the world 3205. The Tarpeian Mount was so called because she was there buried, and Iupiter was sirnamed Tarpeius, because there worshipped. Tarpeian Masse, a structure none More famous? where's the hundred gated Towne Calld Thebes? or strong immur'd Babylon? Where's populous Ninive? what's Romes sublime Vast Theatre by Cæsar built? by Time Confounded all; where's the Colosse of Rhods? Age. Their ruins all were foreseen by the gods. Earth. What's Troy? old Sparta? or Corinthus hye? What's Solomons Temple, Harlot? Age. All these lye In darke oblivion buried; and in vaine You fret, chide, wrangle, and perplex your braine, Deare Mother Earth; weepe riuers from thine eies, With clamors cleave thy jawes, make thy lungs rise, Consume thy marrow, breake thy backe, and teare Thy intrals out; the Fates are so severe, Thou canst not breake their order, their strict lawes Inviolate are, and will admit no clause: For them the mightiest Kings cannot oppose, The Souldiers shield hath no defence 'gainst those; The rich mans purse, the learning of the Wise, No nor the Poets Verse (let that suffice.) Earth. If then with such ferocitie they bee So deeply incenst; and that the gods agree In such inclemencie: advise me how I shall demeane me? Age. You of force must bow To their eternall doome, though you complaine, Grieve, sorrow, and lament, all is but vaine. Earth. I will not therefore. Age. Your best is to advise Man to leave th'earth, and looke vp to the skies: To put no confidence in Mundane Glory, Which (like himselfe) is meerly transitory. Not to grow proud of Beauty, Wisdome, Wealth, Nor of his Strength, since Age by silent stealth Will rifle him of all. To him relate, Of far fam'd men the most vnhappy state. Earth.

Againe, Afford the Vine Grapes, and the tough Oke Mast; Food to the Fish, and to the Birds repast: 'Tis I that to th' embroider'd medowes yeeld Hay, to the Gardens Floures, Grasse to the Field: And last, as to the best of all my brood, Birth unto Man; and after bearing food. Man. I do confesse it, Mother. Earth. I much lament, Deare Childe, and from hence growes my discontent, That hauing such a fertile wombe, so free, And ever-teeming; only that by mee So many shapes and bodies hourely grow, So firme in substance, and so faire in show, That nothing can her ravenous throat asswage, But all must die and be consum'd by Age: She ruines Forrests, the hard marble weares, Frets iron, wasts Palaces, strong bulwarks teares, Spoiles Camps, doth Citadels demolish quite; Even the gods sacred statues takes from sight. She not high consecrated Temples spares, But that which teares and torments to my cares Still addes, That Man she ruthlesly deuoures, And makes him perish at vncertaine houres: Therefore beware, my sweetest Childe, take heed, Lest tympanous pride within thy bosome breed, Of this beware, my sonne. Man. Mother I shall. Earth. Then first, lest warlike glory thee assaile, And make thee to forget thou art but Dust; Heare vnto what the god-like Heroes trust, Whom Age hath worne out of all memorie.

I whom alone Achilles quak't to see, Have yeelded vnto Fate, and vnto thee Andromache (a widow) left my sonne. Thus Age ends all things an the earth begun. Achilles. The Trojans terror, Great Achilles, I In sinewie strength excelling, and thereby Famous of old, the only hope and stay Of the Greeke Heroes, who alone made way Through all the Dardan host. 'Twas I alone Was dreaded in the field, and but me none. Alone of far-fam'd Hector was I fear'd, And Priam quak't when he my name but heard: Able my nerves, and matchlesse might my grace, In body mighty, terrible my face, Big shoulderd and broad brested, sterne my brow; Yet to By Minerva's Altar, is intended that which stood in the Temple of Pallas within the City of Troy, where Achilles at his marriage to Polyxena daughter to King Priam and Hecuba was slaine by Paris. Minerva's Altar as I bow, Paris behinde me steales, and with his dart Wounds me i'th heele, which rankles to my heart. And thus the Valiant perish, and thus Age All things consumes in her devouring rage. Alexander. What's life but frailtie, bubble, or a blast, A cloud, a smoke, no sooner seene than past? Yeares, like a ball, are voluble, and run; Houres, like false Vowes, no sooner spoke than done: Time quickly wasteth by vnwary dayes, Nothing can bribe the Sisters to delayes. The horrid sword of Death whoso would fly, Let him but looke into myne age, how I Am gon and spent; I that was calld and knowne By name of Alexander Macedon: Whose fame hath from the Suns vprise been heard Beyond the place Ioves Sonne his pillars reard. Through Hespery and all the Easterne lands Have I been fam'd, whom none (oppos'd) withstands. The populous city Thebes my arme o'rethrew, I many thousand Persian souldiers slew; Phœnicians, Ciclicks, Paphlagonians, all My sword subdu'd: thrice did Darius fall Beneath my potencie: great Babylon, Mighty in walls, I sieg'd, and seised on. And after, golden-wav'd Hidaspes past; Porus (foure cubits high) I queld at last, Whom, conquer'd, I set free. This done, I then From India saild, to Babylon agen. Returning, I fell sicke, soone after dyde; Thus Time and ravenous Age shall all things hide. Sampson.

Now lest faire Feature should in thee breed pride, Natures indowments, or ought else beside; See women next, in face and forme excelling, Swallow'd in dust; all Beauty Age expelling. Hellen. O you blind men, with feminine shape oretaken, Whose amorous hearts are with their culture shaken, Now do I finde too late, and grieve to thinke, All mortall beauty must in Lethe sinke. We kembe these haires, and trim them vp in gold. (Our curled tresses with rich gems inrol'd) Our fronts we burnish, and there cannot passe One blemish, but corrected by the glasse. By art we adorne our heads, and by art wee Dispose the face and haire; by art we see. And yet these haires, this head, these eies, this face, Vanish like moving waves which flote apace. Behold! I that was faire, am wormes meat made, My flesh corrupt, and buried in the shade. Behold (I say) that Grecian Hellen, shee Rap't, Menelaus, in her prime from thee: Me Helena was in her Nonage first rap't by Theseus before her mariage to Menelaus King of Sparta, and after by Paris ravisht, and carried to Troy. Theseus ravisht first, and left me so, That saving kisses I did nothing know. False Paris last (by Fate or Fury led) Hosting with me, made stealth into my bed: Foole that he was, he little then did know, This snare for me was Troys sad overthrow. This putrified Coarse by him so bought, was after by a thousand ships re-sought. O Greece, what preparation didst thou make, To fetch that flesh which now the wormes forsake? What broiles? what strage? what slaughter to destroy, Did this loath'd carkasse breed 'twixt Greece and Troy? Became it thee, friend Paris, to forsake Thy houshold gods, and such a journey take, To hazard seas, only to fetch away From Greece this rottennesse, this putrid Clay? And you the Atrides, were the two brothers, Agamemnon and Menelaus, so called from their father Atreus. Atrides, would you saile so far, And for this dust maintaine a ten yeares war? That this vile earth, this stench you might returne, To close these ashes in my fathers urne? Lais. If any fables haue bin sung in praise Of Prostitutes, what fame their shapes could raise; I the Corinthian Lais, choice and best, Haue been the crowne and grace to all the rest. My chin the Ivorie stain'd, Lillies my brow, To match myne eies the world then knew not how: My necke was long and straight, and my veins blew, Soft lips, in my cleare cheekes fresh roses grew; My nose was neither crooked, long, nor flat, My visage it became, it graced that: My wanton paps like two round hillocks grow, From which moist springs two milky rivers flow, My belly comely sweld, for it became Like a plumpe Peacocks, soft as the yong lambe: My stomacke like the temperat Turtles feeding; Modest my dyet, and no surfets breeding; My armes much whiter than the Lillies shwoing, Or floures, Alcinous was King of the Phœacians, and lived in Corcyra, who much delighted in Orchards and Gardens. Alcinous, in thy garden growing. Who that my leg did looke on, but did thinke He burnt in flames, or in the seas did sinke? Or who my backe parts did behold, but sed, O that I were a flea in Lais bed. Or who my foot, but wisht himselfe a stone, With vpward eies for me to tread vpon. And yet this face, these cheeks, these lips, these eies, This necke, these haires, these temples, legs and thighes, This stomacke, belly, backe, armes, hands, and feet Are wormes meat now, and with corruption meet. Learne yong man then, that which we trust in most Is dust and filth; in Age are all things lost. Thisbe.

Driades their laps would fill With various floures, and the Napæe bring Chaplets of Bayes to crowne me when I sing. To th' Palaces of Emperors accited, And to the banquets of great Kings invited: And yet I dy'de. What profit did it breed, That I first taught the wanton Goats to feed, To till, to sow and reape; or be fam'd far For the rude slaughters of a ten yeares war? Yet was I food for wormes. What's Poesie then? Instable Age ends what she will, and when. Xerxes. Lest opulencie should elate man high, And make him set his face against the skie, Trust to his youth, or what his riches brings, Behold me Xerxes, mightiest of all Kings, And most magnipotent, I that haue bin Possest of such an infinite Magozin Of gold and treasure, so immense a store, As neuer Persian King enjoyd before; That when my pride toward Grecia 'gan to aspire, Gave to so many souldiers food and hire; So many legions from the Orient brought, That in the first great battell which we fought, Such store of shafts and darts my campe did yeeld, As kept the Suns bright lustre from the field: So many ships of mine the Ocean swayd, As made astonisht Neptune fly, afraid, And hide him in his Deeps. What's plenty then? Or what doth Pompe or Greatnesse profit men? We vanish all like shadowes: and even thus Dy'de Crœsus a rich King of Lydia. Crœsus, Crassus surnamed Marcus, the richest man amongst the Romanes, who held no man worthy to be cald rich, who could not within his yearely revenue maintaine an Army: hee was extremely covetous, and managed warre against the Parthians, by whom, both hee and thirty thousand Romanes were slaine, and because the barbarous enemy conjectured that hee made an assault upon them for their gold: therefore they melted a great quantity, and powred it into his dead body, to sate him with that, with which in his life time; hee could never be satisfied. He lived in the yeare of Romes foundation 693. and before the Incarnation 57. Crassus, Midas, a rich King of Phrygia who asked of Bacchus whom he feasted, that whatsoever he touched might be turned into gold, &amp;c. He lived in the yeare of the world 2648. about the time that Debora judged Israel. Midas, Priam King of Troy potent in wealth, and strength, but after slaine, and his Citty utterly subverted by the Grecians.

Marius lives; Or if there any sterne Mezentius, was King of the Tyrenians, remembred by Virgil in his Æneids, to be a great contemner of the gods. Mezentius be, Contemner of the gods: these looke on me, I the base sinke of sin, the ship of shame, Quaffer of humane bloud, Nero, the same Whose murthers have been bruted over all, From the Suns uprise, to his Westerne fall: Whose gluttonies and lusts Nilus knew plaine, And Calpe, is one of the hills in Spaine, called Hercules Pillars. Calpes, to the farthest parts of Spaine. To rip my mothers wombe was my desire: Who knowes not too, I set great Rome on fire? Who knowes not, that my fury did betray The lives of Lucian and wise Seneca? Who knowes not, that Saint Paul and Peter tryde My sword, by which most of the Senat dy'de? But what was then my miserable fate? Prest by my feares, and by the peoples hate, Scornd by each sex, abhorr'd in myne owne land, Contemn'd of all, I fell by myne owne hand: Thus Nero dy'de, thus none can Age withstand. Sardanapal. Lest soft effeminacie, lust, and abuse Of Natures gifts, might pleade the least excuse; I am that Sensuallist Sardanapal, Who to my selfe thinking to ingrosse all Voluptuousnesse, deckt in their womanish sutes, I spent my time 'mongst common Prostitutes; False periwigs vpon my head I wore, And being man, the shape of woman bore. Yet this ranke body a small urne containes; To this we must, to this, Age all constraines. Earth. Son dost thou see how all things Age outweares? How the Strong perish, with the prime in yeares? How the Faire falls, and how the Learn'd decay? And how the Rich consume and fade away? How Tyrants dye? How death the Wanton tasts? And, to conclude, how swift Time all things wasts? Man. What (Mother) shall I do? If I liue chast, I am not therefore safe: or if I wast My houres in Venus sports, I am not free: If ever weepe, what shall become of me? If ever sport, what profit can it bring? And though I ever mourne, or ever sing, All's one, for die I must. Since Death ends all, Let my corrupted body die and fall To dust, to earth or wormes, pleasure's my store, Let me enioy that, I desire no more. Earth. Thus I conclude; Though mans life be vnstayd, And as we see, by Custome hourely fade, Even as the parched leaues by Autumne change And fall to nothing; yet (which is most strange) Of his owne fruit he is vnmindefull still, And followes what proves to himselfe most ill. [A Dialogue from Lucianus Samosatensis, called Misanthropos, or the Man-hater] The Argument of the Dialogue intituled Misanthropos, or the Man-Hater. This Dialogue of Riches doth entreat; Of their true use: how they with lucre great Are long acquir'd, and how soone lost. The cause Of this Discourse is grounded from th' applause Timon first had in Athens, where he sway'd, For his wealths sake, being honor' d and obay' d. Who after a most riotous expence, Having consum' d his state, and growne to sence Of Povertie; such as he rais' d he tries, But findes them now his person to despise. He seeing how base avarice did blinde The world that time, in hate of all Mankinde, So devious from Vertue, did propose A new name to himselfe, Misanthropos; Which gives this Tractat name. Th' Authors intent Being to shew, how proud and insolent Riches make men: and have it understood, How they pursue the Bad, but fly the Good. Reade and observe, this Dialogue affords Much excellent matter, coucht up in few words. The Dialogve. Timon. O Iupiter, loving and sociable, That art domesticall and hospitable, The lightning-blaster, Oath and Iury-shaker, Cloud-gathering god, and the great Thunder-maker: Or if thou any other syr-name hast, Such as by th' antient Poets in times past Hath to thy deitie been madly given, To patch their halting Verse, and make 't run even, (For thee a thousand nick-names are pursuing, To helpe their Lines, and keep their Rymes from ruin) Where's now thy all-fear'd lightning, breeding wonder? Where's thyne high streperous and loud voic'd thunder? Thy radiant and bright burning bolts (once dreaded) What, are thy late keen pointed darts unheaded? All these, since thou with-heldst thy terrible stroke, Appeare vaine trifles, and Poeticke smoke, And of thy great power nothing else proclaimes, Save meere verbositie, and noise of Names. For these thy Poetised tooles for war, Which being drawne, both reacht and wounded far; I know not by what means, but now at length, Blunt is their chastning edge, and lost their strength; So cold and frozen they about thee lie, That of thy wrath no sparke we can espie Kindled against the Nocent. These perjurers (Iesting at sufferance) make themselves assurers Of their owne safety: being no more afraid Of thy unquenchable lightning, than dismaid At common fire extinguisht: it shewes like To them, as if thou shouldst some Tition strike, And they looke on; dreading no more thine ire, Than his whose strugling breathes forth Ætna's fire: Presuming no more wound belongs vnto't, Than only to be smudg'd and grim'd with soot. From hence it comes, that Salmoneus, was said to be the sonne of Eolus, not he whom the Poets feigne to be the god of the winds, but one of that name, who raigned in the Citty of Elis in Greece. He willing to appeare unto his subjects to be a God, and no man, and so to assume unto himselfe divine adoration, made a bridge of brasse over a great part of the Citty, over which he used to hurry his Chariot, whose wheeles were shod with rough iron, thinking therby to imitate Ioves thunder, for which insolence, Iupiter being justly incenst against him, stroke him with a true thunder-bolt, and sent him quicke to hell. A type of pride, justly punished. Salmoneus dare With thee in thy loud thunders to compare: Nor strange; he a man that bold and daring is, And thou a god so sufferant and remisse: What could he lesse do than such revels keepe, Since thou hast drunke Mandragora, an herbe so called, because it beareth Apples sweet smelling, of an extraordinary greatnes, the Latines call it Malum terræ, id est, the Apple of the earth. It is that which we call the Mandrake. Mandragora, to sleepe And snort away thy time? even still forbearing Such as blaspheme and neuer cease forswearing. Besides, like one that such misdoers tenders, Not plaguing them, thou plumpst up great offendors. Some hold thee blinde, and cannot see what's done: Some, easie to be foold: like rumors runne, That thou art deafe on both sides: others hold, Thou art decrepit, and of late growne old. When thou wast in thy former youth and prime, Thou didst not sloathfully mis-spend thy time; Then thou hadst spleen, and vnto wrath wast prone, Vengeance and iust infliction grac'd thy throne, And wast indeed such an all-dreaded god, No malefactor could escape thy rod: Thou heldst with such no covenant, but thy darts Were still in action to amase their hearts; Thy invulnerable arme advancing hye, Whilst through the earth thy flashing lightnings flye, Drawne from thy quiver, where they late did sticke, Shot as from warring Archers, swift and thicke. Besides these, fearefull earthquakes, which were many, such as her reverend brest tare vp and cranny Mountaines of snow by drifts made, haile in such Aboundance, that of late we see none such: Impetuous showres of raine made torrents rise. And riuers o're their banks to tyrannise. It hath been said, In good Deucalion, was the sonne of Prometheus, and married Pyrrha the daughter of Epimetheus. Whilst he raigned in Thessaly came the universall Deluge, which drowned all the world, only he and his wife, got into a ship and saved themselves: their vessell first touching on the hill Pernassus, where the dry land first appeared, which was meerely a fiction of the Poets, who had heard or read of the generall Innundation, in him figuring Noah and his Arke. Others thinke that this floud happened onely in Greece and Italy, and that in the yeare of the world 2440. after Noahs floud 744. Deucalions age Such sudden inundations 'gan to rage, That all mankinde being drownd in one account, Scarse was one skyffe sav'd on Lycoris Mount, by which Lucian intends no other than the two topt Pernassus, before spoken of. Licoris Mount; In that, Humanities small seeds reserving: From whence a generation lesse deserving, And much more impious grew: they imitating What's bad, and worse and worse stil propagating. Nor is there cause thou shouldst with them be wroth, Receiving but the guerdon of thy sloath. Who now vnto thy Altars offerings bring? Or to thy dreadfull name loud Poems sing? Thou now hast neither sacrifice nor praise, Nor is thy ruinous Temple hung with Bayes; Vnlesse by chance some by Olympus passe, And call to minde that such a god once was, (And rather too for fashion sake, than feare) Perhaps some thrifty Offering may leaue there: Like Saturne they would deale with thee (I tell thee) And (as thou him) so from thy throne expell thee. I here omit, whilst thou hast elsewhere trifled, How often thy great Temple hath been rifled, Ransackt and spoild, whilst thou the loud tongu'd Crier (O'regrowne with sloath, as if thou didst desire Thine owne vndoing) not once wake nor call The dogs there kenel'd, make them barke and ball, Nor raise the drowsie neighbours, sleeping fast, To present rescue, till the theeues were past: But thou the generous Gyant tamer, who Dost boast in the great Gyants overthrow, Didst like a sot sit neither grac't nor fear'd, Whilst from thy chin they shav'd away thy beard: Yet thou even at that instant wert so strong, To hold a dart that was ten cubits long. O thou so famous, what wilt thou endure In th' end, if still thou wilt be thus secure? Or at what time wilt thou extirp the seeds (By thy just vengeance) of those grosse misdeeds? How many bold aspiring Phaetons, or Deucalions canst thou finde? Hie expiat for This inexhausted wickednesse still flowing From corrupt mankinde, and thou all this knowing. Impertinent things I will submit to Fate, And passe in silence: only now relate Myne owne particular wrongs. How many great And mighty of th' Athenians, to the seat Of knowne sublimitie hath Timon rais'd, Creating them from beggars? whilst they prais'd And magnify'd my bountie. Vnto all I spred my open hand and liberall; In which most men (before me) I exceeded, As generally supplying such as needed, My riches 'mongst my friends parted and given, Till I my selfe to penurie was driven. Then suddenly a stranger I was growne, And to my most familiar friends not known: Those (when I past them) that would croutch and bend, In adoration: those that did depend Vpon my grace, my presence cannot brooke, Nor on my wants so much as daigne a looke. If (as sometimes) I chance to crosse the street, And any one of these my Creatures meet. “As of some statue, by long time decaid, “They shun my shadow, of my fall afraid. And others likewise that from far espy me, Into some by-lane skrew themselves, so fly me, Make me an ominous spectacle of Fate, As if malevolent and vnfortunate: Who in my better daies was their Director, Styl'd by themselves, their Father and Protector. These mischiefes growing, to be made so vile, My owne deep counsels I 'gan reconcile, Snatcht vp this mattocke, chus'd a field out, where The Earths faire brest I am forc'd to wound and teare? And thus my time in labor weare away, Being hyr'd for some foure halfe pence by the day. Thus with my spade in solitude here I Reade to my selfe myne owne Philosophy. The profit reapt hence is, to be remoat, And live out of the sight of such as doat On smoky vanities, those that inherit Plenty of all things, and yet nothing merit; And that doth most torment me. Now at length, Saturn and Rheas off-spring shew thy strength;( (Iupiter Thy profound sleepe shake off, for thou indeed In sloath dost Epimenides, was a Poet of Creet, whom Saint Paul in his Epistle (as Beza is of opinion) cited.

At his returne he found his brother a very old man, by whom he understood, all that happened in his absence, and was after worshipped as a god.

You see how his humanitie hath chang'd him, And freenesse, from his dearest friends estrang'd him: His mercy vnto others, being so kinde, And then amongst so many not to finde One gratefull, hath distraction in him bred, Still to be living, but to them thought dead. Considering next how he is scorn'd, derided, And his revenue and estate divided, Not amongst Crowes and Wolves, but worser far, Ravenous and tearing vultures, who still are Gnawing vpon his liver; those whom he His friends and best familiars thought to be. For they who now in his aboundance swim, Were more delighted in his feasts than him: Nay, those who at his table did applaud him; When even unto the bare bones they had gnawne him, They suckt his very marrow, and then fled; So to the world gaue him both lost and dead: Being so far, from miserie to free him, They would not seeme to know him when they see him. These brought him to this base despised trade, And hurld him from the Scepter to the Spade; Turn'd him out of his purple, here to sweat And hardly earne his meat before he eat: For which hee's so possest with mortall spleen Against mankinde that so ingrate hath been; Since whom his bounty rais'd and brought to fame, Scarse now remember Timon had a name. Iupiter. Yet one (beleeve me) not to be rejected, But for his former pietie respected. Nor blame I him his anger to be such, By men ingratefull to endure so much. This zealous and good man not to redeeme, To favor his afflictions we might seeme: But we much pitty him, who to maintaine Our adoration, hath before us slaine So many Goats and Bulls, and those the best That his flocks yeelded; so that I protest, I did approve them for my service meet, Whose savor in my nosthrils still smells sweet. As for the boldnesse of that infinite Crew Of base perjurers, who forsware what's true; As likewise those in selfe-conceit so strong, They make no conscience of what's right or wrong; Such as insult by rapine and rude force, Oppressing without mercie or remorse, The Sacrilegious too, such as forbeare Their publique robberies, not through love but feare; So many th' are in number, (though I strive) At their misdeeds I no way can connive. I cast myne eye of late on Athens, where So many strange Duels and fencings were, Such Pro's and Contra's, quarrels in the schooles, Like mad men railing, some; others like fooles Gybing: in vprore all, shrill acclamations Of scolding Disputants; such vociferations, And those so loudly thundred in myne eare, The suppliants plaints I could by no means heare. Therefore with stopt eares I must silent sit, Or with their confus'd noise be tortur'd yet. There's a new toy imagin'd by these Nodies, Of things essentiall, and yet wanting bodies; Meere fantasies, which they with might and maine (Though nothing) to have being would maintaine: Which is the cause I have been so vnkinde, As this well meaning man not once to minde. It now remaines his goodnesse to requite: Hye therefore Mercury, Plutus accite, With all speed possible command him hither, And bring with you a magozin togither Of new coin'd gold, more than the man can tell. He with his treasure shall with Timon dwell. Nor shall they easily be remov'd from thence, Though by his bounty and too large expence, He would expell them from him. For those Chatterers, Parrots and Pyes, with other oily flatterers And Parasits that have ingratefull bin, I now will study to chastise their sin, So soone as I my vengefull darts have viewd, And my three-forked thunder stone renew'd: Some of the raies are broke, others rebated, Which with all speed I must have instaurated: The points are dull'd, since I insenced was Against the Sophist Anaxagoras, Who to his Schollers openly profest, The gods or were not, or were naught at least: But I through error mist, Pericles bestrid him, And with his body from my vengeance hid him. The bolt averted light upon the phane Where the two brothers deify'de remaine, (Castor and Pollux) burnt it to the ground. And not one stone was left about it sound. But what a punishment will this appeare Vnto those envious wretches, when they heare, Timon, in whose oppression they agreed, Shall them in wealth and potencie exceed; Mercury. O but much more availes it for a man To stretch his throat with all the power he can, To be obstreperous and heard from far; I do not meane the balling at the Bar, Loud railing for fat fees and gaine of gold; But those like Timon, clamorous and bold, Who in his Orisons hath been so shrill, To make great Iove attentive 'gainst his will; Who had he (smothering griefe) sate still and mute, Might have long labor'd in a thred-bare sute. Plutus. To him, ô Iupiter, I will not go. Iupiter. Tell me, ô excellent Plutus, wherefore so? Especially when thou by us art sent. Plutus. Because I have a fearefull president: Me he with many injuries afflicted, When I was wholly to his love adicted. He shooke me off, as one that did deride me, And into mamocks and small bits divide me, Even cut me into pieces: would not sell me, But being his domesticke friend expell me With forks and prongs, as one insenc'd with ire, Or casting from his hand hot coles of fire. And shall I once again enter his dores, To be consum'd on Sycophants and whores, Flatterers and such? Send me, ô Iove, I entreat, To some that vnderstand a gift so great, Him that to incorporat and hug me strives, Or such as prize me dearer than their lives. This stupid fellow hath a covenant made With Povertie, preferring a poore trade: A mattocke and a skin-coat from her tooke, Before my golden and all-tempting looke: Who now with foure small halfe-pence can make shift, And yet hath given ten talents at a gift. Iupiter. But Timon no such thing hereafter dares Against thy person: rather he prepares To honour thee, as one whom Toile and paine Hath reconcil'd, to welcome thee againe; His intrals with long fast and hunger clung, Hath with his minde now likewise chang'd his tongue. But thou art too complaintive, who accuses First Timon to me for his late abuses, Because he with his gates set open wide, Gave thee free-leaue, there or elsewhere t' abide; Not keeping thee in obscure prison fast, (As being jealous of thee) where thou hast Thy liberty. Againe, thou art inrag'd Against those Cormorants that haue incag'd And shut thee up; complaining, Beneath locks, Keyes, bolts, and seales th'art kept as in the stocks, From whence thou canst not move, from light excluded, Living in dungeons and darke holes contruded: Of such thou hast complaind to me, and wept, To be so long, so close in darknesse kept; Looking withall so meager, pale, and wan, Opprest with care as hadst thou been a man, Starv'd and shrunke vp, thy sinues drawne together, Thy fingers clutcht and lam'd; I know not whether Hoording vp gold this Apoplex compelling, Or numnesse, made by thy assiduat telling; Willing to stay with them by no persuasion, But apt to leave them on the least occasion. And what above thought makes thee ill bested, Is, in an iron or a brasen bed (As thou hast heard of Danae) to be laid, As there for ever to be kept a maid, By impious overseers schoold and taught, Who save in gaine and usurie know nought. Their grosse absurdities I haue heard thee note, Who on thy person aboue reason dote; And being in their power, dare not employ them, Or lying prostrat to their lust, enjoy them: They all the while strict vigilancie keeping, With gard vpon the place where thou art sleeping, Eying the bolts and bars, and winking never, As in great hope thou wilt supply them ever, And haue much profit from thee. Not that they Mean to make blest vse of thee though they may, But only keep thee in such strict tuition, Because none else of thee should have fruition. Iust like a dog that in the manger lies, Who though himselfe the provender despise, As to his pallat a distastefull meat, Yet will not suffer the poore horse to eat. I likewise have observ'd thee laugh at those, Who though they have thee at their free dispose, Most gripple are in sparing. In a word, Thou holdst it most ridiculous and absurd, That such (mean time) should starue themselves, not knowing To whom (their floure being wither'd) thou art growing: To what Executor, Servant, or Page, Steward or Pedagogue, who their spent age Haue not bestow'd on thee, but on thy coine, To seise by force, or else by stealth purloine; And then for his safe hoording and close hiding, The wretched Master (new deceast) deriding, Who did so charily in his life time locke it, And with a snuffe halfe burnt within the sockit, Or dry rush light, keepe wakefull his faint eies Vpon his (now) all-forfeit vsuries. Is it not therefore, Plutus, ill in thee, That hast of these so oft complain'd to me; Thy fickle thoughts so suddenly to vary, And blame in Timon the clean contrary? Plutus. Yet if my cause to censure be refer'd, Iove shall confesse that I haue no way err'd: Nor is there reason why I should dispense With Timons lightnesse, rather negligence, In stead of study, care, and that good-will, Respect, and love, that should attend me still. Nor of the adverse part do I approve, Those that embrace me with an over-love, Imprisoning and obtruding me so close, To make me every day more huge and grosse; Franking me up, to fat me, with intent I may appeare to them more corpulent; Yet they themselves, nor vse me in my neatnesse, Nor shew me vnto others in my greatnesse. All such I contumelious hold and mad, Who notwithstanding all good from me had, Put me in shackles, where I starving ly, Opprest with hunger, and with thirst still dry: Not understanding they must shortly leave me To such as stand wide gaping to receive me. Nor do I of those Prodigals allow, Apt to part with me, and not caring how: Such only I approve amongst the rest, Who hold a mediocritie the best; That neither vow to keep an absolute fast, Or hauing plenty, are inclin'd to wast. Consider this, ô Ioue, Say that a man Finde for his choice the fairest Maid he can, To make his Bride; and when the Nuptiall night Invites them both to rest, he sets her light, Neither observes her, nor is tender o're her, But sets his dores and gates broad wide before her, To gad and wander at her pleasure, trusts Her night and day to prostrate where she lusts: The man that gives such libertie to vice, What doth he (not preventing) but intice To lewdnesse? as inviting folke to prove her: Can such an one be said truly to love her? Againe, If any shall a Faire one wive, And bring her to his house; when he should strive To play the husband, and to procreate Children as hopefull as legitimate: Even then of all due Mariage-sweets should grutch her, Nor in her flourishing prime of beauty touch her; Vnwilling from a loathsome Gaole to free her, Where nor himselfe nor any else may see her. But thus secluded, barren, and depriv'd, Shall keepe her still a virgin, though long liv'd: And then, That all this was for love pretend, Preferring her thus old and neere her end, With an exhausted body, colour pale, Deep wrinkled cheeks, and sunk-in eies that faile; Would you not thinke that man quite from his sences, Who when by lawfull and most iust pretences He might have hopefull Issue, and possesse A goodly sweet yong woman, and no lesse Amorous, yet suffers her in care and anguish, Sadly like one of Cibels Priests, they were called Corybantes, of one Corybantus, the prime of her first attendants. They in all the celebrations of her feasts, used to dance madly, beating upon brazen Cimbals, making a confused noise, from whence such Instruments were called, Æra Corybantia: when they danced about the streets their custome was to begge mony of the people, from whence they tooke the denomination of Collectores Cibeles, or Circulatores, id est, Iuglers: these first inhabited the mount Ida in Phrygia &amp;c. Ceres Priests to languish? Thus us'd and I abus'd, am sometimes torne, Rifled and pluckt in pieces, and in scorne Baffled and kickt: by others kept alive, Imprison'd like some branded fugitive. Iupiter. Why fretst thou against those made to endure Strange punishments for sinnes blacke and impure? Or wherefore art thou at such slaves astonisht, Who in themselves seest their owne vices punisht: The one like Tantalus, was the sonne of Iupiter and Plota, the Nymph, grandfather to Agamemnon, and Menelaus, who entertaining certaine of the gods at a banquet, to make tryall of their divinity, killed, dressed, and served his son Pelops at the feast; which fact, the gods after they had discovered, so abhorr'd, that for the loathsome banquet he made them, they provided him another as distastfull, for being confined to hell, they set him in water up to the chin, and ripe Apples above his head touching his lips, yet gave him not power to stoope to the one to quench his thirst, nor reach to the other, to satisfie his hungry appetite. But for Pelops his sonne, so miserably massacred, Iupiter revived him, and for his shoulder which Ceres unadvisedly had eaten up, he made him one of Ivory; who after this went and sojourned with Oenomaus the father of Meleager, and Deianira, which as Helv. reports, was about the yeare of the world 2650. Tantalus, in sight of meat, And alwaies gaping, but forbid to eat: With such dry chaps they gape vpon their gold, Not with that sated which they still behold. The other, though they have it in their pawes, Ready to glut themselves; from their starv'd jawes The Harpies snatch it, as from Phineus, was a King of Arcadia, and the Harpiæ were the daughters of Pontus and Terra, dwelling in Ilands, partly by Sea, partly by land, so called, â rapiendo, or ravening: they are feigned to be fowles, with faces like virgins, and hands like tallons or clawes. Some call them Iupiters dogs: and these, whatsoever the forenamed King provided to eate, snatcht from his table, and greedily devoured: they were after destroyed by Hercules. Phineus, spoiling Those dainties for which he so long was toiling, Go thou from Vs to Timon without feare, To whom (no doubt) thou wilt be henceforth deare. Plutus. But thinke you thatat leng th he will forbeare To poure me into leaking vessels, where Though with great labor you maintaine it still, The liquor runs out faster than you fill; Sooner exhausting me, to draw me dry, Than I my selfe can with my selfe supply: He fearing when I shall with plenty crowne him, I haue but meerly laid a plot to drowne him. I shall be as in Danaus daughters: This Danaus was a King of the Argives, and dwelt in the City Argus. He called the Country, formerly called Achaia, Danaæ, and the generall Nation of the Grecians, Danai. He had fifty daughters, whom he caused to slay in one night the fifty sons of his brother Ægyptus, to whom they were wedded, for whch they were punished by the gods with a perpetual I torment, namely that with bottomlesse pales, they were to fill a tunne without a bottome. They lived in the yeare of the world, 2510. Danaus daughters tunnes, No sooner ought pour'd in, but out it runnes; So many holes being in the bottom drild, That it draines faster than it can be fild. Iupiter. But though the liquor through the vessel breaks, And that he hath no will to stop these leaks, But by perpetuall dropping and effusion, All must of force be wasted in conclusion: Yet 'mongst the lees and dregs no doubt hee'l finde His leathern pelt and spade still left behinde. Go you mean time and see the man possest Of treasure in aboundance, and the best. That done, ô Hermes, call at Ætna, where The Cyclopes, they were so called because they had but one eye, and that was orbicular and round, they were Vulcans ministers, and forg'd or fram'd his thunder-bolts, there are three amongst them themost eminent, according to the Poets, namely, Brontis, Sterope, and Pirachmon, they were mighty great men, and called Giants, &amp;c. Cyclops are at worke, and (dost thou heare?) Bid them repaire to me at my first sending, For tell them that my three tynd bolt wants mending, Both edge and point is dull'd and in my spleene I now must have it sharpen'd and made keene. Merc. Plutus let's walke. But stay (thou of such fame) Tell me how on the sudden cam'st thou lame? What, and blinde too? Plutus. These imperfections lye Not alwaies, Hermes, in my foot or eye; Only at some set times. For being sent By Iove, I am thus lame incontinent, I know not by what means compeld vntoo't, But instantly I halt on either foot, And ere the place before me reach I can, I am growne a lame decrepit weake old man. But if I be to part from such, I fly Swifter than birds make way beneath the sky; No bars can stop me, furlongs are no more To me, than narrow strides, I strip before The windes swift wings, and can deceiue the eye With my unparaleld velocitie: Nay even the publique Criers have agreed To crowne me Victor for my pace and speed. Merc. I now perceive thou Plutus idlely pratest, Since all things are not true that thou relatest: How many have I knowne but yesterday Ready to hang themselues, that could not pay One single halfpenny downe vpon the naile, To buy an halter with: yet now they saile In gold and purple; some in Chariots ride, That had not late a poore Asse to bestride, Wealth flowing on them in so swift a streame, That they themselves haue thought it but a dreame. Plutus. A thing quite contrarie it is, I vow, Of which, ô Mercurie, thou twitst me now: For know, I walke not on myne owne legs when I am sent by Iove to honest and good men. But if god Dis, is the god Pluto, who taketh that denomination â divitijs, of riches, because they are dig'd and torne from the bowels or lower parts of the earth. Dis shall once command, I run, For his behest is in an instant don. He of the great gift-Giuer beares the name, His Magozin 's in hell, whence gold first came: And therefore when I shift from man to man, With all the industry and care they can, They take me, wrapt and swath'd in Bonds and Bills, Where one conveyance a whole sheep-skin fills: So, sign'd and seald, me in some box they smother, And tosse me 'twixt one party and another. The owner dead, left in some obscure place, Where Dogs and Cats may pisse upon his face. Those that have hope to enjoy me are soon found I'th Courts, and those hot sented as the hound, Yawning like to the Swallowes infant brood, When the dam fluttering to their nest brings food. Now when the seale 's discover'd on the Will, And the string cut that bound the rowle vp, still They gape to see the parchment op't and read, To know th' Executor to the late Dead. Then instantly a new heire is proclaim'd. And either, there, some greasie kinsman nam'd, Some Sycophant or fawning Parasite, Or else perhaps a debosht Catamite. He with a new shav'd chin, being of this treasure Possest, then studies noveltie and pleasure, With all rarieties at the height rated, Which the dead hoorder in his life time hated. He must be then a gentleman at least, And with his wealth his Title (needs) encreast, With change of name: for he that was before Knowne by the name of These names, Pythias, Dromus, Tibias, Hyperbolus, and the like, are given according to the Authours fancy, or perhaps aiming at some particular men of like condition then living. Pyrrhias, Drono, or Tibias; although the man be still the same, Must either Megabyzus have to name, Megacles or Protarchus: his minde swelling With vaine ostent to gaine a stile excelling. Even those that did not yawne with deepe inspection (Though at the first in like state and election) Into these hidden Mines; now all dis-jointed, When they behold each other disappointed, Although they truly mourne, seen but to fret, To see the small fish Tuny scape the net; Who as he living did but little eat, So being dead could not afford much meat. Now he that groveling falls vpon this Masse, (Some fat fed Budget, or dull witted Asse, Who of no good parts or clean life hath bin) Enters upon it with an unwasht skin: None treads so softly by him, but he feares, And like a curre then starts up with prickt eares, His fellow footmen he despiseth now, To th' Temple and the Horse-mill doth allow An adoration equall. Who to dispence Is able now with his great insolence? Insufferable he growes, the Good despising, And o're his Like and equals tyrannising; Vaunting in mighty things, till Lust, incited With some faire whore, or otherwise delighted In keeping Dogs and Horses, or by hearing His trencher-Flies about his table jearing, And whispering to him, He is growne more faire Than the Greeke Nireus, a faire young man, whom Homer loved, and whose beauty he much extolled. Nereus, Homer made so rare: The mischiefe 's, he beleeves it; their verbositie Persuading him, That in true generositie Cecrops, was also called Biformis; he was the first King of Athens, and first invented amongst them marriage; he found out Images, builded Altars, and offered Sacrifices amongst the Greekes. He erected the Citty of Athens, and called it after his owne name Cecropia, he flourish d in the yeare of the world 2394. soone after the birth of Moses. Cecrops and Codrus come behinde him. One Tells him, Vlisses unto him alone Submits in wisdome, and persuades the Beast To be more rich than Crœsus was, at least By sixteen fold: exhausting by this meane, And in one breath of time consuming clean What was by piecemeale gather'd, and did rise From base extortions, thefts, and perjuries. Merc. These are no question true: but when thou go'st On thine owne feet (being blinde) say how thou know'st The way thou art to take? how canst thou finde Such men as are of good and honest minde? To whom (as now) my father oft times sends thee, And in his care and providence commends thee. Plutus. Thinkst thou I finde those I am sent unto? Merc. By Iove not I: if so, how didst thou do, When lately being to Aristides sent, Thou to Hipponicus and Callius went, And other base Athenians, scarce worth thought, Or a poore single halfpenny, to be bought? What is the course thou tak'st vpon the way? Plutus. Now high, now low, in each blinde path I stray, Till unawares upon some one I fall, And be he what he will, that man gets all: He that is next me, and can first catch hold, To fasten on me, having seis'd my gold, Secludes me to some obscure place, possessing What he long wisht, then openly confessing, In prayers and vowes, he is to Hermes bound, By whose assistance this great fortune's found. Merc. Is Iove deceiv'd, presuming that thou go'st To inrich such as he affecteth most, And thinks them worthy of his largesse? Plutus. Right, O Mercurie, and justly too, my sight Being defective, and at such times blinde; And sending me to seeke that, which to finde So difficult is, and scarcely hath a Being, Is that a taske with my dim sight agreeing? In which had quick eyd Argus in my sted been his inquisitor, he scarce had sped: The path so narrow and obscure, beside, It being so rare to see a good man guide A Cities weale; for those corrupt still sway, And those in numbers flocking in my way: I groping, can I possibly eschew To avoid the many, and select the few? The wicked alwaies yawning after gaines, (The others not) how can I scape their traines? Merc. I but how comes it, when th'art to forsake These wretches, thou such voluble speed dost make? And without rub or the least stumbling, when Thou canst not see the path before thee? Plutus. Then Both eies and feet assist, and then alone, When Time invites and calls me to be gone. Merc. Another thing resolue me: Tell me how It comes to passe (ô god of Wealth) that thou First being blinde, next, of a pale complexion, Last, crippled in thy feet, canst gaine th' affection Of so many great friends and lovers, such As thinke they cannot gaze on thee too much? Nor can imagin they are truly blest, Before of thee undoubtedly possest? Againe, If he that after thee enquires, Chance to be frustrat in his hot desires; For such I haue knowne many, and some noted, That so debashtly on thy person doted, That at their courting if thou seem'dst but coy, Have ready been their owne lives to destroy: Who when they saw they Plutus could not please, Themselves from hye rocks cast into the seas, And yet I know, and thou must needs confesse, (View but thy selfe as I do) thou wilt guesse, If not conclude, it is not love, but madnesse Makes them despaire in doating on thy badnesse. Plutus. But thinkst thou, Mercurie, I to them appeare In the same forme as thou beholdst me here, Or lame or blinde, with such defects about me? Merc. O by no means, for I should then misdoubt me That they were blind as thou art. Plutus. But not quite, O Mercury, like me depriv'd of sight: And yet there falls on them, as by some chance, A kinde of error or blinde ignorance, Which occupies them all, over their eies Casting a shadowie filme, which doth disguise My deform'd parts; so I appeare to them In golden habit, stucke with many a gem: In pictur'd vesture I seem, passing by, And thousand colours, to deceive the eye. These fooles imagining, what I present, To be my sole and native ornament: And therefore being enamor'd on my forme, If not enioy me, then they rage and storme. But should I be before them naked laid, And my mis-shapen ouglinesse displaid, No doubt they would condemne themselves, pursuing A seeming good, which leades them to their ruin: Th'are only apt themselves to reconcile To things in their owne nature base and vile. Merc. But when it comes vnto such passe that they Are filld with wealth, and supply'd every way; When they have hedg'd, nay walld their riches in, Some notwithstanding looke so bare and thin, Withall so gripple, you may sooner teare Head from the body, than impart what's there? Besides, it is not probable, but such As haue with greedy eies perus'd thee much, Must needly know, (howe're they proudly boast, Thy outside tin-foild, or but guilt at most? Plut. These my defaults (with others) to supply, I have many ready helps, ô Mercury. Merc. Name them I prethee. Plut. They no sooner fasten With greedinesse vpon me, but they hasten To ope their gates wide, then with me by stealth Enter (for alwaies they attend on wealth) Hawtinesse, Boasting, with the mindes destraction, Effœminacie, and to make vp the faction, Oppression and Deceit, with th' interest Of thousand more; with which the heart possest, Is suddenly subjected and brought under, To admire toyes which are not worth the wonder, And covet that which they ought most to fly. Now with this band of Pensioners garded, I When thus attended they my state behold, They never dreame of other god than Gold: For with such adoration they respect me, To endure all torments, rather than reject me. Merc. How smooth and slick thou art, no where abiding, But when men thinke thee safest, swiftly gliding Thorow their fingers, neither can I spy A handle or an haft to stay thee by, As we hold pots and glasses; they slip through The hand as snakes and serpents use to doo. When Poverty, to thee quite contrary, Where e're she takes her Inne is apt to tarry: It gummy cleaves like Bird-lime, uncompeld, Apt to be seis'd, and easie to be held; Having a thousand catching hooks, and so About her plac'd, that hardly she lets go. But whilst we trifle here, there's one maine thing We had forgot. Plut. What? Merc. That we did not bring Treasure along, it being Ioves intent, And the chiefe businesse about which we are sent. Plut. For that take thou no care: I do not enter Vpon the earth, (being calld, and leave my Center, But I have still a care upon my store, At my departure to shut fast my dore, Which only opens to me when I call. Merc. Let's thither then, and Plutus lest thou fall, Hold by my cloake, and follow till we come Vnto the place assign'd. Plut Hermes well done, To leade me thus; for if thou shouldst forsake Me as I am, I might perchance mistake My way, and wandring, through my want of sight, On Hyperbolus or on Cleon light. But stay, What noise is that? I heare some one Is with his pick-axe striking against stone. Merc. 'Tis Timon, who laboriously doth wound A piece of mountainous and stony ground. O wondrous! Poverty by him fast stands, And the rough fellow Labor, with galld hands. Here's Wisedome, Health, and with them Fortitude, And besides these, a populous multitude Of such like Groomes, Need them to worke compelling, And yet a troupe (me-thinks) thy Gard excelling. Plut. Therefore let's post hence with what speed we can. For, Hermes, how shall we invade a man Girt with so great an army? Merc. Be not afraid, 'Tis Ioves command, whose will must be obayd. Pov. O whether lead'st thou Plutus? Merc. To inlarge Timon from hence; for so Iove gave in charge. Poverty. Comes he againe to Timon, whom (bereav'd Of health by many surfets) I receiv'd, To Wisedome and to Industry commended, And in his cure so far my skill extended, I soone restor'd him (as he still doth finde) Sound in his body, and vpright in minde. Have I deserv'd such scorne, or do I merit A wrong, what is myne owne not to inherit? That you are come, with colorable pretence, Him (now my sole possession) to take hence? Whose ruin'd vertues with exactest care I have much toyld and labor'd to repaire. Being againe in that blinde gods protection, Hee'l bring them vassald to their late subjection, Fill him with arrogance, disdaine, and pride, And every ill that Goodnesse can mis-guide; And when all hope of faire amendment's past, Returne him backe as I receiv'd him last, Effœminate, sloathfull, franticke, or what not, A thing of nothing, a meere brainlesse Sot. Merc. Thou hear'st Ioves will. Poverty. And I to it agree. Knowledge and Labor doe you follow me, With all my traine: hee'l shortly to his cost Finde what a mother he (in me) hath lost; What a good helper, what a true instructer. In all good arts a tutresse and conducter: He, whilst with me he had commerce, was still Able and healthfull, having strength at will, Leading a manly life, turning his eies Vpon his brest, and of proud vanities And gawdy frailties had at all no care, But held them trifles, as indeed they are. Merc. They now are gone, let us approch more neare. Timon. What slaves be these that to myne eies appeare? Why are you come? what would you? what require? Of a poore laboring man that works for hire? You shall not part hence laughing, for know, I Have store of stones that round about me ly. Merc. Assault us not, ô Timon, for in vaine Thou shalt do so, we are not of the straine Of mortall race, but gods: I, Mercury: This, Plutus, sent from the great Deity, Who doth at length commiserat thy state, With purpose now to make thee fortunate: All shall be well, we come to ease thy paine, Leave off thy worke, henceforth be rich againe. Tim. Though to your selves the name of gods you borrow, Keepe off, or I shall give you cause of sorrow: Come not too neere me, I at random strike, For gods and men I now hate both alike: As for that blinde slave, him I'le first invade, I vow to rap him soundly with my spade. Plut. Let vs be gone, ô Mercurie, hee's mad, Lest some sad mischiefe from his hand be had. Merc. This barbarous spleen good Timon strive to hide, And thy ferocitie cast quite aside. With gratitude receive what Iove hath sent, I strike thee lucke, be rich incontinent: Prince of th' Athenians thou shalt henceforth bee, And to contemne them that disdained thee, Punish their base ingratitude, bee't their griefe To see thee rais'd, live happy, and their Chiefe. Plut. I have no need of you, pray give me leave To use my labor, and at night receive My competent wages, 'tis a gainfull trade, I have wealth enough in using this my spade: I should be happy if you would forbeare me, But then most blest if no man would come neere me. Merc. Thou speakst too inhumanely; Timon I This thy harsh language and absurd reply Will tell my father: Say that from mans brest Th'hast had more wrongs than thou canst well disgest, Yet 'tis not good the gods thou shouldst despise, Who as thou seest all for thy good devise. Tim. To thee, ô Mercury, Iove, and the rest Of the Cœlestiall gods, I here protest, I hold my selfe much bound, and thanke them for Their care of me, but Plutus I abhor, And him I'le not receive. Merc. Why? Tim. Because I guesse Him the sole author of my great distresse And mischiefes manifold, as first betraying me To oily smooth-tongu'd flatterers, and then laying me Open to those insidiated my state. Envy and hate he first did propagate, Corrupted me with vices, then disclos'd me To all reproch, and after that expos'd me To spleen and canker'd malice which exceeded, And last of all left me when most I needed. Excellent Povertie contrariwise Inur'd me unto paines and exercise Becomming Man; truly and freely wee Together liv'd in consocietie, Supplying me with all things, garments, meat, Which tasted best, being season'd by my sweat. All vulgar things she taught me to despise, And looke on frailties with unpartiall eies; Persuading me, that Hope hath stedfast root, Where mans owne industrie's assistant too't: Shewing what Riches should be our delight, Such namely as no soothing Parasite, No fawning Sycophant, no mad and rude, Nay stupid and seditious multitude; No Orator that gathers from lewd tongues Bad tales, and heraulds them to others wrongs: No Tyrant that lies craftily in wait: When none of these can undermine our state, Then we are truly rich. Labor hath made Me able-bodied, whilst I daily trade In this small field, from whence I cannot see A thousand ills that in the City bee. The tooles I worke with plenteously supplying With needfull things, vprising and down lying. And therefore Mercury returne I entreat, Beare with thee Plutus backe to Ioves high seat; With fond delirements let him others charme, Me for my part he never more shall harme. Merc. Not so, good man, let me advise the best, Study thyne owne peace, and let others rest. This peevish (rather childish) spleen forbeare, And from myne hand receive god Plutus here. In man 'tis prophanation to despise Such blessings as Iove sends the Iust and Wise. Plut. Wilt thou, ô Timon, heare me to the end, Whilst I against thee myne owne cause defend, And suffer me with patience? Timon. Speake, but briefly, Avoiding Proëms and preambles, chiefly Vs'd by damn'd Orators: see thou be'st short, I'le listen to thee, but thanke Hermes for't. Plut. More liberty by right I ought to claime, Whom thou of wrongs injuriously dost blame; Thy invective is with bitternesse extended, Yet innocent I in nothing have offended, Who thee of all delicious things prouided, At thy free will to be dispos'd and guided: I was the author and chiefe instrument Of thy authoritie and gouernment; I gave thee crownes, and furnisht thee with treasure, Made thee conspicuous, to abound in pleasure. In all rarieties I thee instated: By me thou wert observ'd, and celebrated. If since, ought ill have unto thee betided, ('Cause thou perhaps my goodnesse hast misguided) By seeming friends or servants, canst thou blame Plutus for this? I rather should exclaime On thee, for many contumelies past, Powring me out 'mongst sordid knaves so fast: Who only sweld thee with vain-glorious pride, Devising strange prestigious tricks beside, Only to draw me from thee. I'th last place Where thou hast utter'd to my foule disgrace, I left thee in thy want to starve and pine, Be witnesse Hermes if the fault were myne: Who after injuries not to be borne, Didst cast me from thee in contempt and scorne, Hence comes it, for thy cloake of purple die, Thy late beloved Mistresse Poverty Hath wrapt thee in this skin coat. I attest Thee, Mercury, how much I was opprest: And but that Iove commands, by no facilitie Could I be woon to attone this our hostilitie. Merc. But Plutus thou now find'st how he is chang'd, And from his former humor quite estrang'd. Therefore have free commerce, dig Timon still, And in the mean time Plutus vse thy skill, That as by Ioves behest thou art assign'd, In delving deep he may this treasure finde. Timon. Well Hermes, I obey, and am prepar'd To be againe made rich: For man 'tis hard To wrestle with the gods. Observe, I 'ntreat, Into what miseries and mischiefs great Thou hast headlong cast me, who (I vow) vntill This houre liv'd happy, as I might do still. What ill have I deserv'd, now to be vext, And once againe with infinite cares perplext, By fastning on this treasure? Merc. And yet take All, I intreat, in good part for my sake; Beare it, however weighty and indeed Almost intolerable, bee't but to breed Envy in those base Claw-backs: I mean time Having past Ætna, must Olympus clime. Plut. Hee's mounted, hauing left us, making way With his swift wings: but thou, ô Timon, stay Till I depart, and to thy power commit A masse of wealth, solely to manage it. But strike hard, harder yet; and now to thee I speake, ô Treasure, most observant bee Vnto this Timon, with what speed thou hast, Offer thy selfe by him to be embrac't; Dig Timon lustily, thy stroke fetch higher, And worke apace, 'tis time that I retyre. Too't, my good spade, use both thy edge and strength, And be not too soone dull'd, till I at length Have from the Earths deep intrals brought aloft Thy hidden lustre, and here coucht thee soft Vpon this grassy verdure. O Iove, father Of prodigies, or what we else may gather From thy Divine Pow'r: ô my dearest friends The Caribanthes, how your love extends? And thou light-bearing Mercury, behold, And freely tell me, Whence is all this gold? It is some dreame, I am deceiv'd, I feare, These are quicke glowing coles new waked here. No sure, 'tis excellent gold yellow and bright, Most ravishing, all-pleasing to the sight, Beautifull Coine: O let me hug thee then, Thou art the goddesse of Good-lucke to men: It flames like fire compact, in this huge cluster Both night and day it keeps it's glorious luster. Approch to me my Dearest, how to misse thee I know not now: Most Amorous let me kisse thee. Till now I did not credit what was told Long since, That Iove himselfe was chang'd to gold. What precise Virgin could retaine the power Not to hold vp to such a golden shower? Or being the chastest of all humane daughters, Not meet him dropping through the tiles and rafters. Take Midas, Crœsus, and the Magozine Heapt by the offrings made at Delphos shrine; Compar'd with this Masse they are nothing too't, And take the Persian Monarchy to boot. O Spade, ô Skin-coat, late to me most deere, To Pan the rurall god I leave you heere. I'le buy a field remote hence, and obscure, Where having built a strong tower to secure This mountainous heape, I'le study (being gone) How I may best live to my selfe alone. There will I build my tombe too, e're I dye, That none may know where Timons ashes lye. I have decreed, and 'tis establisht in me, That none from this sequester'd life shall win me, Nor hate 'gainst all mankinde. Henceforth a guest, A friend, or a companion, I protest, Are names forgot in me: Th'Altar of Pitty, So much esteem'd and honor'd in the City, I'le hold as a meere trifle. Commiseration On those that grieve or make loud acclamation, To give the Needy, or their wants supply, Shall be to me as blacke iniquitie. Subversion of good manners I'le allow, A sad and solitarie life I vow, Such as Wolves leade, bloud-thirsty to the end, For only Timon shall be Timons friend; All else my foes, with whom I am at strife, As those that still insidiate my life: To intercourse with any that hath bin Before my friend, I'le hold a capitall sin, Deserving expiation: and the day That I incounter Kinsman in my way, I'le thinke unprosp'rous: for no more I passe For Man, than statues made of stone or brasse; With such I'le hold no covenant. Solitude Be thou myne aime and end: as for those rude Of myne owne Tribe, Cousins and Nephewes, or Myne owne domesticke servants I abhor; My Country likewise: I to all their shames Shall count them as meere cold and barren names. Th' are mad mens Saints, but trifles to the Wise; Be thou alone rich, Timon, and despise All else: Thy selfe only thy selfe delight, And separated live from the loath'd sight Of Sycophants, (the remnant of thy daies) Who only swell thee vp with tympanous praise. Offer thy gifts unto the gods alone, Feast with thy selfe, be thine owne neighbor, none Neere thee: whate're is thine partie pate Vnto thy proper ends, and Rivals hate. It likewise is decreed, That Timon will Himselfe use gently and humanely still, Be his owne page and servant, when his breath Leaves him, his owne eies he will close in death. If love vain-glory, hee'l himselfe renowne; On his owne head his owne hand place a crowne: No stile of honor be to him so sweet, As to be call'd Misanthropos, 'tis meet, Because he hates Mankinde: the Character That in all ages I desire to weare, Is Difficultie and Asperitie, Fiercenesse, Rage, Wrath, and Inhumanitie: For should I see a poore wretch wrapt in fire, And he to quench him should my helpe desire, I would but laugh to see him fry and broile, Seeking to feed the flame with pitch and oile. Againe, f passing by a rivers brinke, And spying one falne in, ready to sinke, And holding out his hand imploring aid, Craving to be supported up and staid; What in this case thinke you would Timon do? Even dive his head downe to the bottome too. There are no other lawes confirm'd, than these, By Timon, son to Echecratides, Even Timon of Collyte, with his hand Subscribes to them, which hee'l not countermand. O now at what a deare rate would I buy, That present newes might into Athens fly, And all of them vpon the sudden know What store I have, how little to bestow. What noise was that? See, multitudes come posting, Clouded in dust, and breathlesse, this way coasting? I wonder how they smelt my gold? Were't best I clime up to yon hill, from whose high crest I with more ease with stones may palt them hence? Or shall I rather for this once dispence With my harsh lawes? to shew them all my store, With the bare sight thereof to vex them more? I hold that best; their comming here I'le stay: But soft, what's he that's formost on the way? Gnatonides the Flatterer, who but late When I was in my miserable estate, And beg'd of him some food for charitie, Cast me an halter: yet ingratefull hee A thousand times hath at my table eaten, I am glad yet he comes first, first to be beaten. Gnaton. Did I not ever thinke the gods above Could not neglect, but still this good man love? Haile Timon, thou most faire, most sweet, most kinde, Bounteous, and alwaies of a generous minde. Tim. Haile too Gnatonides, (the corruptest slave That ever gourmandis'd) what wouldst thou have, Thou more than many Vultures still devouring? Gnaton. It was his custome alwaies to be pouring Harsh jeasts vpon his friends; his quicke dicacitie Would evermore be taunting my voracitie, And it becomes him well. Where shall we dine, Or whether go to quaffe thy health in wine? I have a new song got into my pate, Out of quaint Dithyrams, were songs sung in honour of Bacchus. Dythirambs I learn'd it late. Timon. But at this time I rather could advise That thou wouldst study dolefull Elegies, Such as this spade can teach. Gnaton. O Hercules! Strikes Timon then? with thee, I witnesse these, Before the Areopagitæ Iudges or Senatours amongst the Athernians, so called of the place where they sate. Areopagitæ I Will have thee call'd in Court: ô I shall die, See, thou hast wounded me. Timon. Nay be not gone; Two labors thou mayst save me so in one: Thou shalt complaine of murther. Gnat. Timon No: But rather on my broken pate bestow Some of thy gold to apply too't, and be sure, It's both a speedy and miraculous Cure. Tim. Still stay'st thou? Gnat. I am gon. Wondring hee's growne Of late so rude, that was so civill knowne. Tim. Who's he comes next, all bare and bald before? Philiades: I know him of the store Of Sycophants most execrable, who wound Me in not long since for a piece of ground, Besides two talents for his daughters dower, And all that substance did the slave devour, Because he prais'd my singing: when the rest Were silent all, he only did protest And sware, that I did admiration breed, Nay, dying Swans in sweetnesse much exceed. I since being sicke, desiring him to have care Over my health, the Villein did not spare To spurne me from his gate. Philiades. Ingratefull age, Dost thou at length know Timon, he, the sage And wise good man: full well did he requite Gnatonides the soothing Parasite, And Temporiser, who is only friend To such as of their wealth can know no end. But he hath what he merits, a just fate Depending on th' Vnthankfull and Ingrate: But we that have been table-guests of old, Equals, and fellow Citisens, enrold; Who'twixt us interchang'd the name of brother, And were not chargeable one to another, We should renew acquaintance: Sir, God save you, And beware henceforth how you do behave you To sacrilegious Parasits that appeare Alwaies at banquets and abundant cheare: They are only Smell-feasts, waiting on the Cooks, But little differing from base Crowes and Rooks, Men are of late so'bnoxious vnto crimes, There is no trust to any of these times; Vnthankfull they are all, and bad: but I Knowing thy wants, and willing to supply Thy present uses, purpos'd to have brought A talent with me; fearing thou hadst owght To some harsh Creditor; or might have need For other ends: but by the way indeed, Hearing to what a surplusage of gaine, Thou hast arriv'd, I held it a thing vaine. Yet came I of thy bounty to make proofe, And counsell thee of things for thy behoofe: But needlesse were it, Timon being so wise, That (if he liv'd) he Nestor might advise. Tim. 'Twas kindely done, Philiades, come neere And see what welcome I have for thee heere. Phil. Thou wretched churle; what vndeserved punishment Hast thou repaid me for my late admonishment? I feare he hath broke my necke. Tim. Behold a third, Demeas the Orator; indeed a Bird Of the same feather: he hath bills, records, Fables, a man meerly compos'd of words. He calls himselfe my kinsman; who in one day (Of myne) to th'Cities Chamber had to pay Sixteen whole talents, he then in execution: Yet I redeem'd him, and made full solution Of all his debts; when he was fast in hold, I freed him thence: yet was the slave so bold, That comming after unto eminent place, Where he with Erictheides, whom some think to be Ericthonius, or Ericthæus, the fourth King of Athens; he first found oue the use of Coaches, because his feet were deformed. Hs lived in the yeare of the world 2463. about eleven yeare after Israels departure out of Egypt. Erichtheiades had grace, (Who had the charge of the whole Treasurie, And mony by account then due to mee) He being my feed Advocate as then, Protested that I was no Citisen; Therefore not capable my due to claime: Most loudly lying without feare or shame. Demeas. Save thee, ô Timon, thou, of all thy race The greatest ornament and the prime grace, Of the whole State the Columne and the stay, By whom protected and supported, they Live safe: thou art the stay of Greece, we know, The people frequently pronounce thee so, With either Court: but heare what I have writ In thy great praise, and then consider it. Timon, of Echecratides the son, Borne in Collytte, who hath never don But what became him well; who as he was Of unstain'd life, in wisedome did surpasse The Grecian Sages; who from himselfe did steale His pretious houres, to benefit the Weale. He was so good a Patriot, besides strong, And from th' Olympicke wrestling brought along Great honors by his swiftnesse, by his force, The foure wheeld Chariot and the single horse. Tim. I have not so much as spectator bin Of what thou sayst I am so eminent in. Demeas. All's one for that, we Orators are free, And what's not yet done may hereafter be: These are but things of course, and aptly fitted, I see no reason they should be omitted. But the last yeare, no longer since, how well Did he demeane himselfe, nay how excell, When he against the Achernenses fought, And their great army vnto ruin brought? The Spartans in two battels he subdu'd. Timon. How can these be? Do not my sence delude: I never being souldier, nor had minde, Or the least purpose to be so inclin'd. Demeas. 'Tis modestie in you, I must confesse, To be so sparing of your worthinesse. But as for us, we should be most ingrate, If we your great worth did not celebrate. Besides, in Lawes, which (truly understood) Have been inacted for the publique good; In privat consultations about war Or peace, he did transcend all others far, And brought unto the publique State such profit, That there is none can speake too loudly of it. For these just causes it is held convenient, And by the Lords and Commons thought expedient, (Being a man so generally respected) To have a golden statue erected To this great Commonwealths man Timon, grac'd So far, as to be next Minerva plac'd, In her owne Temple, shaking in his hand (As imitating Iove) a fulminous brand, Bright raies about his head, and at the least, Deckt with seven Crownes, to have his name increast. Next, to have all his glories open laide In the new Tragedies to Bacchus made. These solemne Sacreds must be kept this day, And who more fit than he to act them, pray? Demect to this decree doth first subscribe, Because he counts himselfe of Timons tribe, His neere Ally and kinsman, or indeed His scholler rather, for he doth exceed In learning the superlative degree, As being all what he can wish to bee. This is the generall suffrage, and thy due: But how had I forgot? that to thy view I did not bring my son and heire, the same Whom I have since calld Timon, by thy name. Tim. How can that be, ô Demeas, when thou hast No wife at all, pretending to live chast? Thou art a Batchelor. Dem. Tush, do not feare, My purpose is to marry the next yeare. If heaven permit, and thou shalt heare relation, That all my study shall be procreation. Then my first Borne (a boy it shall be sure) I'le Timon call, to make thy name endure. Tim. But if in this sad stroke I not miscarry, 'Twill be a doubt if euer thou shalt marry. Demeas. O me, what means this out-rage? art thou wise, That dost upon thy friends thus tyrannise? To beat him hence, that hath more quicke conceit And apprehension in this broken pate, Than thou in thy great Mazard: neither can This iustifie thee for an honest man, Or a good Citisen: This out-rage don, Shall question thee before the setting Sun; For I dare justifie, thou durst aspire To set the Cities Citadel on fire. Tim. That calumny will to thyne owne shame turne, Because the place hath not been seen to burne. Dem. But being rich, it may suspected bee, That thou hast robd the common Treasurie. Tim. The bolts and locks are whole, and 'twill appeare Most vile to such as shall thy scandals heare. Dem. It may be rob'd hereafter; i'th mean time Thou thus possest art guilty of that crime. Tim. Mean time take that, 'twill speed thee if't hit right. Dem. O me; that blow'twixt neck and shoulders light. Tim. Shreeke not so loud, ô Demeas, if thou dost, Here's a third for thee. Me-thinks it were most Ridiculous, that being unweapon'd, I Two mighty Spartan armies made to fly, And one poore snake not vanquish: so in vain The honors from Olympus I should gaine, To championise and wrestle. Soft, what's he? Grave Thrasicles the Sophist it should be: The same; I know him by his promisse beard, And beetle browes: Some things that are not heard He mutters to himselfe, and his squint eye Casts towards the Moone, as should his wits there lye: His unshorne haire beneath his shoulders flowing, About him scatter'd with continuall blowing: Like Boreas or some Tryton he appeares; Iust such as Zeuxes (since not many yeares) In tables us'd to figure them. Now hee, In habit rare and thin, makes toward mee, Pacing a modest, but affected gate, As if he had new crochets in his pate. He museth too: wonder you would to heare Him every morning, with a looke austere, Dispute of Vertue and her excellent qualitie, Reproving all delights, only frugalitie, (Which he affects) extolling. His first care Is first to wash, then instantly prepare Himselfe to meat, but at some others charge. As soone as set, the boy brings him a large And brim-filld bowle; no liquor him can scape, So it be strong and prest from the pure Grape, Like Lethe's water, downe the wine he poures His yawning throat; talks, At his early houres What his Positions were and Disputations; Troubling the hearers with his vain narrations. Now he begins to gourmandise, and sits Houering vppon the choice and fattest bits, (As if the table could not roome afford) He strikes his neighbors elbow from the bord, In earnest feeding; crums hang on his beard; With severall saucers all his chaps are smear'd. Being almost gorg'd, vpon the fruits he flies, And almost groveling o're the platters lies; Tumbling and searching with insatiat minde, As if in them he vertue hop'd to finde. With his long finger having scrap'd the dish, And slapt up all the sauce of flesh or fish, So cleane, that not a waiter, sparelier fed, Shall have ought left wherein to dip his bread: Still sits he as his greasie fists have shap'd him, Vext, that some glorious morsell hath escap'd him; Though he alone whole custards hath devour'd, And his wide throat with tarts and marchpanes scour'd: Yet hee's not satisfy'd, although at least He hath gormandiz'd a whole hog at a feast. Now the best fruits that grow from this voracitie, Is to be loud, and prate with great audacitie. His guts full stuft, and braines well toxt with wine, Himselfe he spruceth, studieth to be fine; Either prepares his squealing voice to sing, Or dancing, hops about as he would fling His gouty legs off from his rotten thighes. Wearied with these, againe he doth devise Of new discourse, and that must chiefly bee Of temperance and grave sobrietie. Now is he made a sport to all the Bord, Stammers and lisps, speaks not a ready word; Then drinks even unto vomit: Last of all, To take the nasty fellow thence they call. Then there's with both hands lifting; loth he leaves The place, and unto some she Minstrell cleaves, Ready to ravish her in all their view, To shew that Lust doth Drunkennesse pursue; Nay in his best sobrietie applying Himselfe to boldnesse, avarice, and lying; In which none can out-match him, hee's a Chiefe Both with the soothing flatterer and Thiefe: For perjurie there's no man that transcends him, Imposture ushers, Impudence attends him. He is an Object of meere obseruation, Or (truly lookt into) of admiration; A spectacle of scorne, that wonder brings, Being made complete from meere imperfect things: In all his imperfections, more or lesse, Seeming a kinde of modesty to expresse. Most strange! O Thrasicles, What make you here? Thrasicles. Not with the minde of others I appeare, O Timon, who come flocking to behold Thee and thy mighty Magozin of gold, Perhaps to steale and pilpher, to be guests Intrusive to thy table and thy feasts; Who daub thee with pyde flatteries, that indeed Art a man simple, and dost Counsell need; A brainlesse Prodigall, wholly given to wast, Easily parting with what coine thou hast. Besides, thou art not ignorant, I am sure, What spare and thrifty dyet I endure, One Chop or Fragment best with me agreeing, Even just so much as will maintaine a Beeing: An onion is a meat to taste my pallat, But a few water Cresses a choice sallat; A little salt cast on them, then 'tis rare, And I account it most delicious fare. My thirst th' Athenian fountaine sates and fills, Which by seven cocks it plenteously distills. This thred-bare cloake by me is prizd more hye Than the best robe dipt in the Tyrian dye: For Gold, thou knowst that I esteem't no more Than I do pebbles scatter'd on the shore. Yet for thy sake I hither made accesse, Fearing thy wealth, thy goodnesse might oppresse; Being corrupt and vile in it's owne beeing, And no way with thy temperature agreeing, The rout of irrecoverable ills, Which seeming most to comfort, soonest kills. Be rul'd by me, Go instantly and cast Into the Ocean all the wealth thou hast: What need of Gold, when all things we supply By contemplation of Philosophy? But cast it not into the depth I prethee, But neere the shore, when only I am with thee; Enough 'tis if the wave but overflow it, To cover it, and (save my selfe) none know it. If this dislike thee, that thou holdst it vaine, I have another project in my braine, A nd 't may prove the best course; From forth thy dore Precipitate and tumble all thy store; And to expresse a pure abstemious minde, Of all thy Masse leave not a piece behinde. There is a third way (like the second) speedy, Namely, by distributing to the needy; Who in all eares shall thy donation sound: To him fiue drachma's, give that man a pound, A talent to another. If by chance, Philosophers of austere countenance Hither to taste thy largesse shall repaire, Give such a double, nay a treble share, As to the men most worthy. This (alasse) I for myne owne part speake not, but to passe Thy bounty unto others that more need, And would be thankfull, of thy gift to feed. For my particular use I crave no more Than so much at this present from thy store As would but fill my Scrip, the bulke being small, Holds two Ægina bushels, and that's all: To be content with little, moderation And temperance becomes men of my fashion: We Sophists, that in wisedome all out-strip, Should aime at nothing further than our Scrip. Tim. All that thou speakst I (Thrasicles) allow; Yet e're I fill thy wallet, heare me now, I'le stuffe thy head with tumors, having made True measure of thy skull with this my spade. Thrasic. O Liberty! ô Lawes! neere a free City, Thus to be us'd by one devoid of pitty! Tim. Why, Thrasicles, thus angry dost thou show thee? Have I not paid thee the full debt I owe thee? Stay but a little, and t' expresse my love, Foure measures thou shalt have o're and above. What further businesse have we now in breeding? Multitudes hither flocke, in throngs exceeding; There's Blepsias, Laches, Cniphon, and in brief, A thousand more that hasten to their grief, As if they ran for blowes; see how they flocke: Therefore I'le clyme to th' highest part of this rocke, I hold that course is for the present best, And to my wearied spade to give some rest: Of scatterd'd stones I'le gather me an heape, And from that place I'le make them skip and leape, Pouring my haile on them. Bleps. Hurle not, we pray, O Timon, instantly wee'l trudge away. Tim. And yet thou shalt with difficultie doo't, Without some bloud-shed and deep wounds to boot. [A Dialogue of the Same Author, betwixt Iupiter and Ganimede] The Argument of the Dialogue intitled Ivpiter and Ganimede. Ioves Masculine love this Fable reprehends, And wanton dotage on the Trojan Boy. Shap'd like an Eagle, he from th'earth ascends, And beares through th' aire his new Delight and Ioy. In Ganimed's exprest a simple Swaine, Who would leave Heaven, to live on Earth againe. The Dialogve. Iupiter. Now kisse me, lovely Ganimed, for see, Wee are at length arriv'd where wee would bee: I have no crooked beak, no tallons keen, No wings or feathers are about me seen; I am not such as I but late appear'd. Ganimed. But were not you that Eagle who late fear'd, And snatcht me from my flocke? where is become That shape? you speake now, who but late were dumbe. Iupit. I am no man, faire Youth, as I appeare, Nor Eagle, to astonish thee with feare: But King of all the gods, who for some reason Have by my power transhap't me for a season. Ganim. What's that you say? you are not Pan, I know: Where's th? your pipe? or where your horns, should grow Vpon your temples? where your hairy thighes? Iupiter. Thinks Ganimed that godhood only lies In rurall Pan? Gan. Why not? I know him one: We Shepheards sacrifice to him alone. A spotted Goat into some cave we drive, And then he seiseth on the beast alive. Thou art but some Childe-stealer, that's thy best. Iupit. Hast thou not heard of any man contest By Ioves great Name? nor his rich Altar view'd In Gargarus, with plenteous showres bedew'd? There seen his fire and thunder? Ganim. Do you then Affirme your selfe the same, who on us men Of late pour'd haile-stones? he that dwells above us, And there makes noise; yet some will say doth love vs? To whom my Father did observance yeeld, And sacrific'd the best Ram in the field. Why then (if you of all the gods be chiefe) Have you, by stealing me, thus play'd the thiefe; When in my absence the poore sheep may stray, Or the wilde ravenous Wolves snatch them away? Iupit. Yet hast thou care of Lambs, of Folds, of sheep, That now art made immortall, and must keep Societie with Vs? Ganim. I no way can Conceive you. Will you play the honest man, And beare me backe to Ida? Iup. So in vaine I shap'd me like an Eagle, if againe I should returne thee backe. Ganim. My father, he By this hath made inquirie after me; And if the least of all the flocke be eaten, I in his rage am most sure to be beat. Iup. Where shall he finde thee? Ganim. That's the thing I feare, He never can clime up to meet me here, But if thou beest a good god, let me passe Into the mount of Ida where I was: And then I'le offer, in my thankfull piety, Another well fed Goat unto thy diety, (As price of my redemption) three yeares old, And now the chiefe and prime in all the fold. Iup. How simple is this innocent Lad? a meere Innocuous childe. But Ganimed now heare. Bury the thoughts of all such terren drosse, Thinke Ida and thy fathers flocks no losse: Thou now art heavenly, and much grace mayst do Vnto thy father and thy country too. No more of cheese and milke from henceforth thinke, Ambrosia thou shalt eat, and Nectar drinke, Which thy faire hands in flowing cups shalt fill To me and others, but attend us still; And (that which most should moove thee) make thy'abode Where thou art now, thou shalt be made a god, No more be mortall, and thy glorious star Shine with refulgence, and be seen from far. Here thou art ever happy. Ganim. But I pray, When I would sport me; who is here to play? For when in Ida I did call for any, Both of my age and growth it yeelded many. Iup. Play-fellowes for thee I will likewise finde, Cupid, with divers others to thy minde, And such as are both of thy yeares and sise, To sport with thee all what thou canst devise: Only be bold and pleasant, and then know Thou shalt have need of nothing that's below. Ganim. But here no service I can do indeed, Vnlesse in heaven you had some flocks to feed. Iup. Yes, thou to me shalt fill celestiall wine, And wait upon me when in state I dine: Then learne to serve in banquets. Ganim. That I can Already, without help of any man: For I use ever when we dine or sup, To poure out milke, and crowne the pastorall cup. Iup. Fie, how thou still remember'st milke and beasts, As if thou wert to serve at mortall Feasts: Know, this is heaven, be merry then and laugh; When thou art thirsty thou shalt Nectar quaffe. Ganim. Is it so sweet as milke? Iup. Pris'd far before, Which tasted once, milke thou wilt aske no more. Ganim. Where shall I sleep a nights? what, must I ly With my companion Cupid? Iup. So then I In vaine had rap'd thee: but I from thy sheep Of purpose stole thee, by my side to sleep. Ganim. Can you not lie alone? but will your rest Seeme sweeter, if I nuzzle on your brest? Iup. Yes, being a childe so faire: Ganim. How can you thinke Of beauty, whil'st you close your eies and winke? Iup. It is a sweet inticement, to increase Contented rest, when our desire's at peace. Ganim. I, but my father every morne would chide, And say, those nights he lodg'd me by his side I much disturb'd his rest; tumbling and tossing Athwart the bed, my little legs still crossing His: either kicking this way, that way sprawling, Or if hee but remov'd me, straitwaies yawling: Then grumbling in my dreams, (for so he sed) And oft times sent me to my mothers bed: And then would she complaine vpon me worse. Then if for that you stole me, the best course Is even to send me backe againe; for I Am ever so unruly where I lie, Wallowing and tumbling, and such coile I keep, That I shall but disturb you in your sleep. Iupit. In that the greater pleasure I shall take, Because I love still to be kept awake. I shall embrace and kisse thee then the ofter, And by that means my bed seem much the softer. Ganim. But whilst you wake I'le sleepe. Iup. Mercury, see This Lad straight taste of immortalitie; And making him of service capable, Let him be brought to wait on us at table. Ivpiter and Ivno. The Argument of the Dialogue. Ivno of Ganimed is iealous growne, And much vpbraids Iove with the Phrygian Swaine; Willing (before him) to prefer her owne: And therefore blames her husband, but in vaine. Although this Fable to the gods extends, Base sordid lust in man it reprehends. The Dialogue. Iuno. Since this yong Trojan Swain to heav'n thou hast brought, O Iupiter, thou set'st thy Wife at nought. Iupit. Of him too art thou jealous, a poore Swaine, Though beautifull, yet innocent and plaine? I was in hope thou only hadst a spleen To women, such as I before have been Familiar with. Iuno. Nor hast thou made expression Of thy great deitie in such transgression, Nor done such things as have thee well beseem'd; Who being a god above the rest esteem'd, Descendest downe to earth, making it full Of thy Adulteries: somtimes like a Bull; Then like a golden Showre, and keeping still Those Prostitutes below to sate thy will. But now againe, Thou, mightiest of the dieties, Lest that there should be end of thy impieties; Being now inflam'd with an unheard desire, Hast this yong Phrygian Lad snatcht from his Sire, Brought hither to out-brave me, and set ods Betwixt us, filling Nectar to the gods. Is there such want of Cup bearers? or weary Is Hebe yet, or Vulcan, to make merry Thy Guests invited? that no sooner thou Tak'st from his hand the bowle, but straight to bow And kisse his sweet lip, nay in all our sight: In that kisse seeming to take more delight, Than in the Nectar drunke: but which is worst, Oft callst for drinke when there's no cause of thirst; And as in sport (but sipping) thy arme stretchest, And the full Chalice to the Wanton reachest, And he but t sting, as shall please him best, Then to his health carowsest all the rest; And in the same place where his lip did touch, Thou tak'st thy draught, thy lewd desire is such, With heedfulnesse and care noting the brim, So, at once kissing both the cup and him. Not long since too, this King and potent Father Of men and all mortalitie, the rather To sport with him, his Scepter laid aside, And thunders, with which late he terrify'de The lower world. And speake, was not this wrong To a Brow so great? a Beard so full and long? All this I have seen, all these I have endur'd, And nothing's done that is to me obscur'd. Iupiter. Why's this to thee so grievous, ô my wife, That it should raise betwixt us the least strife? That a yong Lad, so faire and sweet as this, Should please me both with Nectar and a kisse? Shouldst thou but taste those lips (which I am loth) Thou wouldst not blame me to prefer them both Before all Nectar and Ambrosia too; Nay, if thou didst, even so thy selfe would doo. Iuno. These are the words of masculine love, much hated, Nor am I mad, to be degenerated By base effeminacies as to take delight In the loath'd kisses of a Catamite. Iup. Pray (you most generous) do not so deprave Those loves and pleasures I am pleas'd to have: This pretty sweet effeminat Lad to me Is dearer far—but I'le not anger thee. Iuno. I wish in my place you had that Lad wedded, With whom you ofter than with me have bedded Since his arrive: your loath'd wife shall bethinke her, How better to behave her toward your Skinker. Iup. Is't only fit, Vulcan thy son should fill Nectar, who being lame is apt to spill; And bluntly running from the furnace, smells Of smoke, dust, sweat, and what I know not else, With sparks scarce quencht, before the gods to stand, His sooty tongs new laid out of his hand, To take from him the goblet? which being done, To embrace, then kisse thy most deformed sonne; Whom scarcely thou his mother wouldst so grace, Fearing his smudg'd lips should begrime thy face. Is he that only sweet Youth must adorne The gods high banquets, being made their scorne? And therefore must this Phrygian be confin'd, Because hee's cleare in looks, as pure in mind? Whose face so smooth, whose tongue doth so excell, And in all points becomes the place so well. But that which most torments thee, since his kisse Many degrees more sweet than Nectar is: Iuno. Now Vulcan vnto thee (ô Iove) seems lame, His forge, his apron, tongs, and tooles, thy shame: What nastinesse? What loathsomnesse? but hee Now at this instant doth appeare to thee Infected with; whilst thou before thee hast That faire fac'd Trojan Lad? but in times past, None of this foule deformitie was seen, No sparks, no soot, no dust to move thy spleen: His furnace in those daies did not affright thee, But then his filling Nectar much delight thee. Iupit. Thou mak'st thy selfe sicke of thine old disease, O Iuno, and this Trojan doth more please, Because of him th'art jealous: if thou scorne From him to take the Cup; of thy selfe borne Thou hast to fill thee, Vulcan, one so smug, As if he gap'd still for his mothers dug. But thou, ô Ganimed, to me alone Reach the rich bowle. Two kisses for that one I'le give thee still, when I receive it first, And when returne it, having quencht my thirst, Why weep'st thou? feare not, they that mean thee harme, Mischiefe are sure to taste. Sweet boy thyne arme. Ivpiter and Cvpid. The Argument. Great Iupiter on wanton Love hath seis'd, Ripping up iniuries before time done; And hardly is the Thunderers rage appeas'd, But holds him fast that is about to runne. The childish Wag submissive language useth, And with what art he can himselfe excuseth. The Dialogve. Cupid. Wherein have I, ô Iupiter, transgrest; That by thy pow'r I should be thus opprest? Being a childe, and therefore simple? Iupiter. Thou A childe at these yeares, Cupid? who I vow, Art older than Iapetus, hop'st thou to win Favor, because no haire vpon thy chin Appeares? and thou art beardlesse? but beguild Must we be still in holding thee a childe? Being both old and crasie? Cup. I pray tell This subtill old man, whom you know so well, What wrong he'hath done, that you would bind him? Iup. See, Thou wretch, dost th nke it a small injurie, To make me such a mockerie and a jest To all men: that a god should to a beast Transhape himselfe: into a Satyre, than Into a Bull, an Eagle, and a Swan: Next to a golden Showre? all these th'hast made me. But that wherein thou chiefely hast betrayd me, My will by force or sleight I must obtaine, But never love, to be belov'd againe: Nor by thy power have I more gratious been To my wife Iuno the celestiall Queen; But forc'd to use prestigious strange disguise, In all my scapes to hide me from her eies. Besides, our mutuall pleasures are not full, They only kisse an Eagle or a Bull: But should I in my personall shape appeare, Even at my sight (poore things) they die with feare. Cupid. That only shewes thy power and divine might, Since mortall eies cannot endure thy sight. Iup. How comes it, Hyacinthus is so deare, And Branchus, to Apollo? Is his Spheare More bright than ours? yet they about him cling, In his owne shape. Cup. But Daphne that coy thing, Though he shew'd yong and beardlesse, his cheeks red, And each way lovely, his embraces fled. If Iove then would be amorous, and apply Himselfe to Love, his shield he must lay by, And fearefull thunders, smoothly kembe his haire, And part it both waies, to appeare more faire: Weare on his head a Chaplet for a Crowne, And flowing from his shoulders a loose gowne Dy'de in Sidonian purple: on his feet Sandals, whose ties with golden buckles meet: Vnto the Pipe and Timbrell learne to dance, And foot it to them finely: so by chance More glorious Beauties may to him incline, Than Menades attend the god of Wine. Iup. Away: I more esteeme my regall state, Than to appeare so poorely effeminate: Cup. Love not at all, and that's more easie far. Iup. Yes, love I must, whil'st here such Beauties ar, And gaine them with lesse trouble, mauger thee. So for this time be gon. Cup. I now am free. Vulcan and Apollo. The Argument. 'Twixt Vulcan and Apollo speech is held Of yong Cillenius, Maia's new-borne son; How he in cheats and theevings hath exceld: Relating strange things in his cradle done. Since whom, all infants borne beneath his star, In craft and guile exceed all others far. The Dialogve. Vulcan. Hast thou not seen (Apollo) the yong Brat So late brought forth by lovely Maia? that Looks in his swathes so beautifully faire, Snarling on all such as about him are; Whom no one that beholds him, but surmises That he is borne for some great enterprises? Apollo. Shall I (ô Vulcan) him an infant call? Or thinke him borne for any good at all? Who for his craft and subtiltie (I vow) Is than Iapetus older. Vulcan. Tell me how? What wrong can this yong Baby do, I pray, Who came into the world but yesterday? Apollo. Aske Neptune that, whose Trident he hath stolne: Demand of Mars, (with rage and anger swolne) Whether his braine least subtiltie afford? Out of whose scabberd he hath stolne his sword? Or let me speake what by my selfe I know: From me unwares my quiver and my bow He slily snatcht. Vulcan. How can it be, his hands Being ty'd up so close in swathing bands. Apollo. Yet be not thou too confident, I intreat thee, For come he neere thy shop, hee'l likewise heat thee. Vulcan. He was with me but now. Apollo. Dost thou misdoubt thee Of nothing lost? hast all thy tooles about thee? What, not one wanting? Vulc. None. Apollo. Free from his wrongs Art thou alone? Vulc. By Iove I misse my tongs, Th'are stolne out of my forge. Apoll. These thou shalt finde About him hid, do but his swathes unbinde. Vulc. Hath he such catching fingers? (past beleeving) Sure in his mothers wombe he studied theeving. Apollo. Didst thou not heare him, Vulcan, talke and prate With voluble tongue, and phrases accurate? Now in his infancie, so yong, so small, Offering to be a servant to us all. No sooner borne, but Cupid he did dare To try a fall with him, and threw him faire. Him Venus for his victorie embrac't, For which he steales her girdle from her wast. Iove smiling at the theft, and therewith pleas'd, Mean time the crafty wag his Scepter seis'd: To steale his Trisulke he had made a shift, But 'twas too heavy for his strength to lift. Vulc. Thou telst me of a Lad active and daring, A nimble jugling Iack. Apollo. Nay, hee's not sparing To professe Musicke too. Uulc. How is that knowne? Apoll. Th' invention too he seekes to make his owne: Having the shell of a dead Tortoise found, He makes an instrument thereof for sound; To which a crooked necke he first made fast, Boring therein round holes, and in them plac't Pinnes to winde up the cords by: to th' Shells backe A belly frames: seven strings, which he doth slacke, And sometimes stretch, he fixeth; which but touch, They yeeld a sweet sound that delighteth much. Whose notes I envy, be they flat or sharpe. Since he contends to exceed me in my Harpe. Even Maia's selfe I oft have heard complaine, She cannot in the heavens her son containe: His ever-waking braine, in action still, Can take no rest: by night (against her will) In silence he conveyes himselfe to hell, Whether to steale ought thence she cannot tell. Besides, he hath wings, a Caducæus too Of a miraculous power, and force to doo Things wonderfull, by which he can bestow Soules hence departed, in the fields below, Or thence convey them hither. Vulc. Most sure I will Adde something to encourage his rare skill. Apoll. Which he hath well requited; for to day (No longer since) he stole thy tongs away. Vulc. 'Twas well done to remember me of this, Because my tongs are tooles I cannot misse. Somewhere about him they are still, no doubt: But first the fire I'le in my forge put out. Mercvry and Apollo. The Argument. Of Iove and of Alcmena: The long night In which the great Alcides was begot, This Fable speakes. And if I guesse aright, In this the Author much profaned not, To tax the heathen Idols his pretence is, Since men are punisht for the gods offences. The Dialogve. Mercury. To thee, ô Phœbus, Iupiter doth say, Forbear to mount thy Chariot for this day; The next too, and the third, disclose no light, But for that time make it continuall night. Keepe in, command the Houres thy steeds to untrace, And thy bright Sun beams plucke from off thy face. For, without intermission being opprest With such long paines, 'tis fit thou shouldst have rest, Apollo. Thou tellst me a new thing, unheard till now; Have I transgrest my course, or been too slow, Ot over-swift? that Iove should prove a way To make the night thrice longer than the day. There's no such thing; he only hath intent At some one aime on which his minde is bent, And this time only (but not still to bee) To have this one night made as long as three. Apollo. Where is he now, or from whence art thou sent To tell me this? Merc. Boetia's continent; And from (If I shall make a true confession) Amphitrio's wife, with whom he hath congression. Apoll. With her his courage then and strength he tries: But for his lust will not one night suffice? Merc. O by no means, since in this copulation Must be begot one that shall awe each Nation; Of a most potent arme, and daring much, And therefore 'tis not possible that such A mighty worke as making up Ioves son, Should in one night be perfected and don. Apollo. Well, I but little have to say unto him, But with this great worke much good may it do him. These things, ô Mercury (we are alone) I'th antient daies of Saturne were not knowne; He did not turne from Rhea, nor mis-led Could he be to adulterat her chast bed: Nor did he leave the heavens, in Thebes to sleepe; The day was then day, and true course did keepe, The night within her certaine houres was bounded, No times, no seasons in his reigne confounded: He had with mortall creatures no congresse. But now for one poore womans sake (I guesse) All things are topside-turn'd, and must be made Prepostrous henceforth, and run retrograde. My Steeds with rest will grow more fierce and hot: The way more hard and difficult, because not In three daies past: Men miserably dwell Here on the earth in darknesse, as in hell. And these are the faire fruits of his foule lust, That sublunarie creatures suffer must; Warning at once the absence of the Sun, And waiting till this mighty worke be don. Merc. Phœbus no more: had Iove intelligence Of what thou speakst, his rage it would incense. I'le to the Moone and Sleep, and what in charge I had from him, deliver them at large: To her, to change the course she late did keepe: To him, to fetter them in bonds of sleepe, So fast, they may not dreame of that great wrong, To have been kept from sight of day so long. Mercvry and Maia. The Argument. Hermes his tedious labors doth complaine, As troubled more than all the gods besides, Not able his imployments to sustaine, As one that in no certaine place abides. Yet by his mother he at length is swayd, Who tells him Ioves hests must be still obayd. The Dialogve. Merc. Is there amongst the gods (ô Mother) any So wretched as my self, though there be many? Maia. Take heed, my son, what thou speakst rashly. Merc. Why? Can you name one that hath such cause as I? Who have so many businesses in hand, And those so great I scarce beneath them stand; Into so many services divided, I am tyr'd and spent, and for my paines derided. For in the morning, e're I can devise Of what my dreams were, I betimes must rise, Then my first office is to sweep the house Where all the gods must banquet and carouse. That done, I next prepare the Consistorie, Whereas the Deities in all their glory Appoint their meetings: all things I make fit, That they in ease as well as state may sit. Then at Ioves elbow I attend, where he Still sends me on his errands: I must be Here, there, and every where, and these too all Hurrying together; for hee'l sometimes call As soon as I am sent. When the whole day I have toild, not having time to wipe away The dust and sweat, new labor I begin, Supper comes on, and I must then serve in Ambrosia: e're the Phrygian had to doo With Ioves crownd Cup, I filld him Nectar too. But what of all 's most tedious, and accites Me to this spleen, I cannot rest a nights; For whil'st each other god upon his bed Takes due repose, even then I of the Dead And new deceast have charge, and through the shade To Pluto's Court I see them safe convay'd. These done, I cannot rest me where I list, But at their generall Sessions I assist, For nothing's done without me. 'Tmight suffice, That I all dayly businesse enterprise: At Wrestlings I am present, at the Bar, Where Causes and Law-Suits determin'd ar', Instruct such Orators as Fees desire; Sometimes supply the place of common Crier. Nor would these things appeare so great a trouble, But that th' affaires of hell make them seeme double. The sonnes of Læda much more happy bee, They interchangeably have leave to see The heaven and hell by turnes; while one doth show Himselfe above, the other stayes below. Than these how much more miserable am I, That in one person both their paines supply? Alcmena and Semele (of mortall seed Descended both) have free accesse to feed Amongst the Deities: yet I on these (Being son of Maia Atlantiades) Am forc'd to'attend, I came from Sidon late, As sent from Iove, to know in what estate Cadmus faire daughter was. Almost quite spent, Not having time to breathe, but I was sent To Argos and faire Danae, in that tower Where he was welcom'd in his golden shower. In thy returne come by Boetia backe, (Saith Iupiter) ô Hermes do not slacke To visit faire Antiope by th'way. My resolution is no more t'obay Vnto his busie hests: To gaine myne ease, I had much rather (did the Fates so please) My selfe for ever to the earth retyre, As a day-Laborer, and worke for hire. Maia. No more, my son, for thou too much hast said; Thy father must in all things be obay'd. Able and yong thou art, prepare agen, To Argos first, and to Boetia then: Hazard not stripes of him that swayes above: Such are most angry that are crost in love. Vulcan and Iupiter. The Argument. Vvlcan obeying to Ioves high designe, With his keen hatchet cleaves his head in twaine: Arm'd Pallas, who there full ten months had lain, At this incision leaps out of his braine; Then entring first the world. Whence we may gather, Knowledge and Arts had birth from Iove their Father. The Dialogve. Uulcan. What must I do, Iove? Prethee let me know: See, I am come, for thou commandedst so; And brought with me an Axe sharp above wonder, Whose very edge will cleave a rocke in sunder. Iupiter. 'Tis well done, Vulcan, 'tmust be thus apply'de, Thou with that hatchet must my head divide. Uulc. Wouldst thou persuade me unto madnesse? say What's to be done, or packe me hence away. My pleasure is, with a strong blow and full, With all thy force thou part in two my skull. If thou refuse to doo't, as fearing skath, Thy timerousnesse will but increase my wrath And deep displeasure: therefore strike I say, Instantly, boldly, and without delay: Quickly deliuer me, I am full of paine, A thousand throwes are laboring in my braine. Vulc. Well looke too't Iupiter, my axe is keen, Nor can this birth be without bloud-shed seen. 'Twill be a dangerous wound made in thy head; Beleeve't, Lucina brings not thus to bed. Iupit. Strike boldly then, ô Vulcan, feare not blood, For I know best what for my selfe is good. Vulc. Though 'gainst my will, I shall, who dares withstand When Iupiter himselfe shall give command. What's here? A woman arm'd leaps on the Plain: O Iove, thou hadst much mischiefe in thy brain. No marvell thou wert angry and much paind, When in thy Pia mater was containd A live Virago, arm'd, and having spread Castles and townes and towers about her head; She leaps and capers, topt with rage divine, And danceth (as she treads) the Matachine, Shakes her steele-pointed Lance, and strikes her Tardge, As if she had the god of War in charge. Nay, which is more, she is exceeding faire, And ripe for mariage, made in all parts rare, And amiable, onely she hath blew eies, But those her gracefull helme doth well disguise: And therefore Iupiter, because I have Thus playd the mid-wife for thee, what I crave, Grant me for my reward, namely that she May be my wife, this day espous'd to me. Iupit. Thou demandst that which cannot be allow'd, For this Minerva is a Virgin vow'd, Nay, a perpetuall Votary: but if I In this could do thee any courtesie, Thou mightst presume't. Vulc. It is my great desire, And to my best of wishes I'le aspire In waiting time to rape her. Iupit. O my sonne, Thou aimst at that which neuer can be done: She vowes to live a Virgin, let that guide thee, Pursue not things which never can betide thee. Neptvne and Mercvry. The Argument. Th'abortive Infant from the wombe tooke late Of dying Semele, Iove doth translate Into his owne thigh: but the time expir'd For mature birth, which (pregnant) he desir'd; This childe, by one conceiv'd, borne of another, Bacchus, enioyes the name of Bacchus bimater. double Mother. The Dialogve. Nep. May I not see my brother? Merc. Neptune, no. Nep. I do intreat thee, Nephew, let him know That I attend without. Merc. It cannot be, And therefore leave this importunitie; You must not at this present be admitted. Nep. Hee's then in bed with Iano? No, (Grosse witted.) Or Ganimed? Prethee resolve me quickly. Merc. Neither; but Iove at this time's weake and sickly. Nep. How comes it that thou likewise lookst not well? Merc. There is a cause in't, which I blush to tell. Nep. What e're it be, the secret do not hide From me thine Vncle, and so neere ally'de. Mer. Hee's newly brought to bed. Nep. Mercury fie, Not possible; it is a thing that I Cannot beleeve: it would have come to light Ere now, had Iove been an Hermaphrodite. Besides, I ne're perceiv'd his wombe to swell. Merc. 'Tis true, in that (ô Neptune) thou sayst well: His childing burthen did not lie within. Nep. Now to conceive thee better I begin; Some other Pallas from his skull is ta'ne; My Brother ever had a teeming braine. Merc. Not so; this burthen in his thigh was bred, Tooke from the wombe of Semele, late dead. Nep. Wondrous! This generous god, by thy relation, Will teach to us new waies of procreation. But what's that Semele? Merc. Of Cadmus race, A Theban Damsell, in whom Iove had place, And left her great. Nep. Most kindely it was done, To spare her throes, himselfe to beare her son. Merc. Ghest somwhat neere; not altogether, tho, Iumping with truth. But wonders wilt thou know, From thee yet forrein? Iuno (jealous still) By strange deceit seeks means the wench to kill; Persuades her (their united loves to sunder) To beg of Iove, to bed with her in thunder And blasting lightning (cause of all her griefe.) To her the credulous Wanton gives beleefe; She craves, Iove grants, descends in glorious fire, And in these flames the poore Girle doth expire. Who grieving the faire Theban so should die, Caus'd me to rip her wombe vp instantly, And bring the Infant, now seven moneths conceiv'd, Whom from my hand he gratefully receiv'd: Not knowing better how to make provision For this Abortive, he made deep incision In his owne thigh, and there it three moneths lay, Till (now mature) it for it selfe made way. This day he is deliver'd, and now growes Somewhat distemperd by his painfull throwes. Nep. But where's the Infant? Merc. Him I did transport To Nisa late, where the faire Nymphs resort, By them with great care to be educated, And by the name of Bacchus celebrated, Or Dionysius. Nep. Then of this thy brother, As Iove the father is, so hee's the mother. Merc: It so appeares: but Neptune I am gon, For other things I now have thought vpon; I must go fetch him Lotion for his wound, Yet green, and will in few dayes scarce be sound. There's nothing but to him we must apply, That's done to women that in childe-bed lie. Diogenes and Mausolus. The Argument. The dead Mausolus doth himselfe advance Before all others of the buried Throng: And therefore he erects his countenance, Because on earth he was so faire and strong. Diogenes derides his boastings vaine, And proves himselfe more happy of the twaine. The Dialogue. Diog. Attend, ô Carion, what is thine intent To be even still so proud and insolent? Prating of thy great worth, others to brave, As if thou for some great desert wouldst have Before us all precedence. Maus. I first claime Prioritie, rais'd from a kingdomes name, (O Synopesian) for I empir'd o're All Caria: next, I pierc'd the Lydian shore, There govern'd Nations barbarous and rude: Besides, I many other Isles subdu'd. The great'st part of Ionia I laid wast, And my great army to Miletum past. Nay more, I was of beautifull aspect, Tall and well shap'd, and (what I much affect) In power (before me) I exceeded all. But that which made me most majesticall, Of costly marble from the rocke dissected, I have a stately monument erected In Halicarnassus, fam'd for magnitude, With rare and never equal'd pulchritude, So faire, so large, that all that see it know, No King that ere deceast the like can show. Statues of men and horses 'bout it stand, Graven and carv'd by a most elaborat hand; In which expression Artists were at strife, Not one of them but imitating life; Of such admired height and spatious roome, It rather seemes a Temple, than a Toome. What wrong is't then, my glories not to smother, And to claime a precedence before other? Diogenes. Is't potencie? is't beauty? or rich stones In such huge number heap'd upon thy bones, That swells thee with such pride? Maus. By Iove the same. Diog. And yet Mausolus, thou that hast the name Of Beautifull, thy strength is not all one, Nor face that was; both now are past and gone: For an unpartiall Vmpire should we chuse To point the Fairer out; let him but use An unsway'd eye, not squinted with affections, Shall finde small difference in our two complexions: For both our heads are bald and alike bare, Having no lips, our teeth apparant are; Neither of us a nosthrill hath to show, But through these empty holes alike we blow. This being granted, if because thy shroud Beneath so great a Structure make thee proud, And that thy countrymen that Mole retaine, Boasting of it with ostentations vaine, To shew to strangers the rare excellence Of polisht stone; what profit reapst thou thence, Thou exquisite man? unlesse thy shallow wit Account thy greatest hurt a benefit; To have of huge stones, wondrously convay'd, A greater heape than others on thee layd. Maus. Am I no whit the better then for these? Is Mausolus one with Diogenes? Diog. Not so, good man, no paritie 's confest; The Carian King shall be with griefe opprest, Excruciated and perplext in minde, To thinke of his great pleasures left behinde, Honors and wealth: Diogenes the while At thy vexation stand aloofe and smile. Thou in thy lasting memorie shalt have The art and charge bestow'd upon thy grave, By thy faire sister and thy widdowed Queene, In Halicarnassus still to be seene. When as Diogenes yet doth not know Whether on earth he have a grave or no; Therefore can take no care for't. My fame lies Tomb'd in the bosomes of the Iust and Wise. Stories to future times deliver can, I lead a life that did become a man. Time shall thy Structure wast, but never myne, (Thou impure Carian) for 'tis made divine: My monument growes neerer to the skye, As built in place much more sublime and hye. Crates and Diogenes The Argument. Nature with too much darknesse overcast, Is maskt and blinded with the worlds affaires, Still doating upon things that cannot last, As on vaine frailties fixing all their cares. “Man that on mundane things himselfe assures, “Cheats all his hopes; 'tis Vertue sole endures. The Dialogve. Crat. Tell me Diogenes, hast thou not knowne Rich Moerichus, the man so overgrowne With wealth superfluous, that from Corinth came With ships so richly fraught? the very same, Cousin to Aristæus thought to be, By computation full as rich as he: Tkese two betwixt themselves use Homers phrase, Claw me, I'le claw thee; Let's live many dayes. Diog. What was the reason, Crates, first did move These monied men to enterchange such love? Crat. The cause they were intyr'd so, and calld brother, Was, aiming to be heire to one another, Being equally possest: and therefore they Publisht their Wills; If Moerichus his day Should before Aristæus chance to fall, He the succeeder then should enioy all. So Aristæus, If he dy'de before, Then Moerichus was heire to all his store. This by Indenture seald, they cog, speake faire, Flatter, in hope to be each others heire, With gifts and presents mutually contending, Yet still one gaping for the others ending. Insomuch that Diviners (whether skild I'th stars or no I know not) all have fild Their itching eares with Novels. Dreamers too (Like the Chaldæans) have enough to doo To mocke them with vain hopes, and at high rate Having betwixt them cast so even a fate, Phœbus himselfe was pusled: first agreeing, That Aristæus should have longest beeing; And then again, That Moerichus the Old Should count new daies when he had all his told: Not knowing whose ambition should prevaile, Their Fates being ballanc'd in so even a skale. Diog. But what's become of this their time out-wearing? Speake freely Crates, 'tis a tale worth hearing. Crat. Those that each others state sought to betray By bribes and flatteries, both dy'de in one day; And that huge Magozin did chance to arrive To those whom they scarce thought of, being alive, Thrasicles and Eunomius their Allyance: Yet the Diviners in their great pre-science Ne're spake of them. Now the two rich men, they, Fearelesse, still hoping with the Fates to play, Being from Sycion unto Cyrra bound, Were in the mid way neere Iapygium drownd. Diog. No matter, Crates, but when we were living, There was no emulation, no such striving To be each others heire; never did I Desire of heaven, Antisthenes should die, To be made his Executor; or summe His dayes, in hope his staffe to me might come. Nor do I thinke thou ever didst desire (O Crates) I the sooner might expire, To inherit my possessions, and to strip Me from my Tun, and pulse left in my scrip. Crat. I had no need of them, nor thou to claime His staffe for legacie, since thou didst aime At a much fairer heritage, to bee Better'd by him, as I have bin by thee; And that in treasures richer and more hye, Such as the Persian Empire cannot buy. Diog. And what be those? Crat. Wisedome, frugalitie, Truth and good life, in all these libertie. Diog. By Iove, I well remember I had store Of these from him, but thou (ô Crates) more. Crat. Yet others that have thought themselves more wise, All such inheritances much despise; Nor sycophant they us, such things to attaine By us, as we from him were proud to gaine, They only thirst and hunger after gold. Diog. No marvell, since they all of them have sold Themselves to Ignorance, not capable Of Knowledge and instructions profitable; Having their mindes with dissolute lusts infected, Like foule and loathsome dishes long neglected, Grow fur'd and sluttish with voluptuous sin, Corrupting the most choice Cates serv'd therein. Th' are full of rifts and cranies, every houre Greater than other: therefore should we poure Into these leaking Vessels, Iudgement sound, Or Truth, or Freedome, all drop to the ground, Through their craz'd bottomes, and lie spilt and wasted, Much with their putrid noisomnesse distasted: (So Danaus daughters here in hell are said, Laboring with Sives a flowing Spring to unlade) And yet even those that can no goodnesse keep, Will watch gold falling from them, and shun sleep, Hoording it with all care. Crat. And so 'tis best We do those vertues we in life possest. Locke they their stuft bags in chests ne're so strong, They shall but one poore halfe-penny bring along, And that no further than to Charons barge; The Ferriman will ease them of that charge. Charon, Menippvs, Mercvry. The Argument. Charon the Ferriman exclaimes vpon Menippus, for not paying him his fare, By him being wafted ouer Phlegeton; For which these two at great dissention are. Charon is forc'd to pardon it in the end; For he that nothing hath must nothing spend. The Dialogve. Char. Pay me my fare, thou wretch. Menip. Nay, scold outright, If thou to heare thy selfe speake tak'st delight. Char. My due for thy trajection downe here lay. Menip. I prethee how can he that hath not, pay? Char. Is't possible there any one can be That is not worth a single halfpenny? Menip. I know not to whom else thou pratest here, But for myne owne part I have none I sweare. Char. I'le bast thee with this ship-rope, if my hire Thou tendrest not. Menip. Then shall my staffe aspire To fly about thine eares. Char. So long a cut Must I take paines to waft thee, and thou put To no expence at all? Menip. Let Hermes stand Ingag'd for me, who gave me to thine hand. Merc. By Iove, in time I shall be ill bested, If I be put to pay fares for the dead. Char. He shall not so passe from me. Men. For his sake Continue still thy course, and quickly make Towards the shore; What to thy share can fall from him who (as thou seest) hath nought at all? Char. Didst thou not know what thou shouldst bring along? Menip. 'Tis true I did, but can excuse the wrong; I had it not, because I want to give, I'st therefore fit that I should ever live? Char. Wilt thou be he then, who alone canst boast To have ferried this great river without cost? Menip. Not so, ô Charon, wanting to defray, Thou hast my paines, I pumpt part of the way, Then tug'd at th' oare, being that only soule Who in thy barge did neither mourne nor houle. Char. Tush, these are nothing to my fare that's due, Lay downe my halfpenny, my fare, in view. Men. Not having it, best way to end this strife, Is, That thou Charon beare me backe to life. Char. For that Gramercy, so I might be sure, From Æacus a beating to endure. This base Ghost would persuade me to the whip. Men. Be not so peevish then. Char. What's in that scrip Thou keepst so close about thee? Men. A small cheat, A little pulse for Hecate to eat. Char. Tell me, ô Mercury, whence hast thou brought This Dog to us? a wretch that mindeth nought. What strange things talkt he by the way, I guiding The helme, whilest he was all the while deriding The passengers? what a loud coile he kept, He only singing whilest the other wepr? Merc. Knowst thou not him? he hath a spirit daring, Hee's bold, free spoken, and for nothing caring: This is Menippus, (Foole.) Char. Well, if againe I take him here,— Men. Thou threatnest me in vain: This passage, though not for 'twixt shore and shore, Yet once being past, cannot be traveld more. Menippvs, Æacvs, Pythagoras, Empedocles, and Socrates. The Argument. Ivdge Æacus doth to Menippus show The obscure Ghosts and Sulphur Vaults below. And after that he brings him to the Plaine Where both the Valiant and the Wise remaine: Who as the freenesse of his tongue him guides, (Wretched himselfe) their sorrowes he derides. The Dialogve. Menip. Now even by Pluto I entreat thee show (O Aeacus) to me the Vaults below. Aeac. Not all, Menippus, that were hard to do: But such especially as belongs vnto Thy late demand, namely the prime and choice; If these content, I'le listen to thy voice. Thou knowst that to be Cerberus, and him The ferriman, who from the rivers brim Trajected thee: this, Periphlegeton: That the Lake Styx, thine eyes now dwell upon. Men. I know both thee and these, Æacus the Great, Who in this portch hath a determin'd seat. To observe all entrance, I have likewise seen The Furies, with th' infernall King and Queen. The men of old I now desire to see, Precelling others in nobilitie. Æac. This Agamemnon is, Achilles hee, That Idomen, a third rankt in degree, And next them plac'd: The fourth discovered, Ulysses, Ajax then, next Diomed. The rest, the far fam'd Grecian Hero's are. Menip. O thou ingenious Homer, see how bare, How groveling and how dejected lie, How low the heads of thy great Rapsodie: Ignoble and obscure they now are all, Ashes and dust, trifles in value small; For (as thy selfe said) nothing hath production, But's mutable and subiect to corruption. Now Æacus what's he? Æac. Cyrus hee's cal'd. Now he that next him sits so much appal'd, Crœsus the Rich; Sardanapalus then, Who was the most effeminate of men: Beyond these Midas, and that Xerxes, Menip. How? Is it my fortune then to meet thee now (Thou wickedest of wretches) in this plight, Who once didst put whole Greece into affright? That o're the raging Hellespont mad'st bridges, And with thy fleet hadst purpose o're the ridges Of mighty mountaines to have saild ('tis knowne.) But what a poore Snake is that Crœsus growne? Pardon me, Æacus, for above all, I have a great minde with Sardanapal To go to present buffets. Æac. Do not so. He is so weake and womanish, the least blow Will breake his skull to pieces. Men. As I can I'le gripe him tho, halfe woman and halfe man. Æac. Wilt thou see those in wisedome did surpasse? Menip. By any means. Æac. Behold Pythagoras. Men. Haile, thou Euphorbus, or Apollo, or what Thou wouldst be calld by else, I give thee that. Pythag. Haile to thee likewise. Men. Speake and do not lie, Hast thou about thee still thy golden thigh? Pythag. I have it not. But tell me, I intreat, If thou hast ought within thy scrip to eat? Men. Pulse, nothing else: Thy words are meerly wast, For that I know thy pallat cannot taste. Pythag. Yet give me part; amongst us here below Doctrines are taught which then we did not know. As namely, That there nothing is to boot Between a Bean and a Satyrion root. Æac. Cast thyne eyes further now, for besides these, Here's Solon, son to Ercecestides, Thales and Pittachus, With th' other Sages, Whose memories shall live to after-Ages: And these alone seem pleasant 'mongst the rest, Iocond and free, as with no cares opprest. Menip. Cover'd with ashes from the toe to th' head What might he be, that looks so like to bread Bak'd on an hearth unswept, blister'd beside, As if he late had rosted been, or fry'de? Æac. Empedocles. Men. He that from Ætna came, Halfe broild of late, I know him for the same: Thou excellent of foot, what was the cause Thou threwst thee headlong into Ætna's jawes? Emped. Madnesse it was, Menippus. Menip. Not, by Iove; But a vain arrogance, pride, and selfe-love, With madnesse added, though thou didst not see't: These scorcht thee, with the sandals on thy feet. Thou Worthlesse, what have all thy feignings bred, Being now as others thrust amongst the Dead. But Socrates, ô Æacus, where's hee? The only man I now desire to see. Æac. With Nestor and Palamedes consorting, And those with whom he best loves to be sporting. Menip. Yet were he here, I would salute him faine. Æac. Behold then that bald Fellow. Menip. All are plaine And without haire: it is an equall note, As well amongst these, as in place remote. Æac. He without nose. Menip. Why, amongst great and small, I cannot spy one wise amongst them all. Socrat. Dost thou seeke me, Menippus? Menip. Thee alone. Socr. How stand all things in Athens? long agone It is since I came thence. Menip. Many yong men, Puny and junior Sophists, such as then Durst not have talkt in publique, now looke hye, and openly professe Philosophie. Nay, who their habits shall observe, the gate Must needs confesse that they still imitate The old Philosophers. Th'hast seen, I know, How Aristippus to these Vaults below, And Plato came: daubd with sweet unguents, th' one: The other in smooth flatteries, cast upon The Tyrant of Sicilia. Socrat. But of me What censure they? Menip. A blessed Ghost to be, And one, in those daies, whose predicting tongue Spake of all things that to this place belong. And therefore they admire thee, hold thee rare, With whom none of the Sages might compare; Above them skild, of such things speaking truest, Yet (sooth to say) I thinke more than thou knewest. Socr. I spake of these things as my skill enabled, Which they held dreams, and that I meerly fabled. Menip. What are these three about thee? Socr. In a word, Charmides, Phedrus, Clima's son the third. Menip. 'Tis well done (here too) to professe thy Sect, And use those thy faire followers with respect. Socr. What can I better do, my selfe to please? Come then, sit downe, and by us take thine ease. Menip. Not I, by Iove, but instantly returne, To heare Sardanapal and Crœsus mourne: Next to these two my mansion I will keepe, Of purpose to deride them when they weepe. Æac. I must be gon too, and have speciall care Lest some ghost steale hence whil'st we absent are. My place is where thou foundst me, next the dore; When next we meet, I'le shew thee ten times more. Menip. I thanke thee Æacus, even with my heart: We have seen enough at one time, now let's part. Nerevs, Thersites, Menippvs. The Argument. Betwixt Thersites and Aglaia's Son A sudden emulation is begun, Which of them both (being dead) is now most faire. The Morall shewes, In death alike we are. The Dialogve. Ner. To end this new borne strife, Thersites see, Here comes Menippus, he shal Vmpire be. Prethee thou Cynick thy free censure tel, Which of us two in beauty most excell. Menip. Resolve me first, Who are you that thus seeke To make me judge? Ner. I Nereus the faire Greeke. Thers. Deform'd Thersites I. Men. But tell me now, Which Nireus was a young man amongst the Greekes who came to the warres of Troy, whose beauty and feature Homer in his Iliades mightily commended: to whom I referre such as desire to be more fully satisfied of him. Nereus, which Thersites, a mishapen and deformed Captaine in the Grecian Host, as crooked in minde as body, who bitterly railing against Achilles, he being mightily inraged against him, slue him with a blow under the eare; his deformity was so great, that from thence arose a Proverbe which hath continued even to this day, Thersite fœdior, asperst upon any stigmatick, and crooked fellow; you shall reade him fully described and characterd by Homer in his first and second booke of Iliads. Thersites? for I vow I cannot guesse. Thers. In this thou art o'recome, Nereus: Menippus cannot give his doome, We are so like. What though blinde Homer boast, And stile thee fairest of the Grecian host? What though my thin and unkemb'd scattered haire Fell in long Elfe-locks from my scalpe, now bare? Do not my living ouglinesse revile, Death ranks us now together in one file. Therefore to have this difference quickly ended, Now iudge Menippus was a Poet, and master to Cicero the famous Oratour: but by this personated by Lucian, is intended a Cynick Philosopher, dogged both in his behaviour and writings, in imitation of whom, Varro the Orator writ a Satyr, and intitled it Satyra Menippea. It is reported of him, that such money as he had hoorded together by usury and the like sordid meanes, was so deare unto him, that being robbed thereof, he grew into despaire, and miserably hanged himselfe. His whole life ye may reade described at large by Diogenes Laertius. Menippus. Ner. Am not I descended From Charopes and Aglaia, fam'd so far 'Bove all that came vnto the Trojan war, For my rare beauty? Menip. But Nereus know, None bring their beauty to these Vaults below. Of the fine flesh thou bragst of, wormes have fed, Leaving thee nought save bones, like us now dead. Ner. Aske Homer, of what fame Nereus was then, And he will answer, The most faire of men; Ascribing Beauties praise fully to mee. Men. Thou tellst me dreames: I iudge by what I see. If amongst them that knew thee in those daies Thou wert so famous, seeke from them thy praise. Ner. Am I not then the fair'st? Menip. Nor he, nor thou, Nor any one that is amongst us now, Can claime precedence: for equalitie Reignes 'mongst the Dead. Thers. And that's enough for me. Ivpiter, Mercvry, Ivno, Pallas, Venvs, and Paris. The Argument of the Dialogue, entituled Deorum Iudicium. The Troian Paris, being yet a Swaine, Is made the Iudge of Ates golden Ball. Three goddesses contend, but two in vaine; Venus (faire Beauties Queene) prevailes 'bove all. With Youth, her fraile gifts are more potent charmes, Than Iuno's state, than Pallas Arts or Armes. The Dialogve. Iupit. Take (Mercury) this Apple, and make speed To Phrygia, there where Priams son doth feed His herds of Cattell; thou art sure to find him In Ida mount, the part that's now assign'd him Call'd Gargarus: and thus much to him say From Iupiter, That we command him stay All other his affaires; for being yong, And beautifull withall, of a quicke tongue, Whom most for amatorious things commend, Him we appoint this doubtfull cause to end, And he alone shall the prime Vmpier bee, To tell which goddesse is the fair'st of three: She that's crownd Victresse by the Trojan Boy, For meed this golden Apple shall enioy. This is the houre that calls you to be gon: I am no competent judge to take upon Me this arbitrement, since I approve, They all have equall portion in my love; And, were it possible, I would renowne Each severall Beauty with a Victors Crowne, As bee'ng to me like deare. Whoso shall give The Palme to one, he cannot chuse but live In envy of the other: therefore I Allow me no fit Iudge. Go then, apply Your selves in haste unto that Phrygian Swaine, Who is descended of a regall straine, And Cousin to my Ganimed; a Youth Simple, (as mountain-bred) who nought save truth Knowes, and there's none that hath beheld his face, But would esteeme him worthy this great grace. Venus. For my part, Iupiter, what would I care, If in this censure, Which should be most faire, Thou wouldst us instantly to Minos send, What can he finde in me to reprehend? However I am confident, yet these 'Tis likewise fitting the yong man should please. Iuno. Neither have we, ô Venus, cause to feare, Should Mars your Sweet-heart be made Vmpier here. But to this Youth selected we assent, And (be he what he will) we rest content. Iup. Is this your minde, my lovely Pallas? Tush, I now perceive you turne your eies and blush: Such bashfulnesse becomes chaste Virgins still; I take thy silence for consent, thy will I finde with theirs hath correspondence: Go, And from yong Paris thy precedence know; But take this charge from me, In those that speed not, Malice or spleen against the Iudge it breed not, Nor the yong man with any mischiefes threat, Since all of you alike cannot be great. Merc. Proceed we then: this path directly leades Vnto those Phrygian pastures and faire Meads; I'le shew the way, you follow me apace, Be all of courage, I both know the place, And Paris too, a beautifull yong man, And in these amorous contentions can As much as any; fit to undergo This charge, and will not iudge amisse, I know. Venus. All this is as it should be: I delight In one not partiall, that will censure right. But is he yet a Bachelor, canst tell, Or doth some Wife or Damsell with him dwell? Merc. I cannot say hee's altogether cleare And free from women. Ven. How's that? let me heare. Merc. There lives with him a smug Idæan Lasse, Sufficiently faire, and one may passe Amongst the rest, but rusticall, as bred In the same mountaine where his herd is fed: Oft in familiar conference I have seen them, But tooke no note of any love between them. Why aske you Venus? Ven. For no ill intent; It came into my thoughts by accident. Miner. Ill dost thou, Mercury, and us much wrong, To hold us in sad conference so long. Merc. Not so Minerva, lovely Venus spake Nothing 'gainst you; only she chanc'd to make A question, if this Paris had a Bride. Minerv. If nothing else, why didst thou closely hide Such talke from us? Merc. She spake the word by chance; To keep't from you was but my ignorance. Miner. Hath he none then? Merc It seemes not. Miner. Doth he incline To militarie Arts and discipline? Is he of warlike spirit, from a straine Ambitious after glory? or meere Swaine? Merc. In that you plunge me; but as I can guesse, Being yong and strong, what can he promise lesse, Than prove a hopefull souldier? Ven. Well, you see I 'plaine me not, nor is it griefe to mee, That you two spake in privat; these complaints Fit jealous heads, but none of Uenus Saints. Merc. Take nothing ill, faire Venus, I beseech, For truly to resolve you, her late speech To yours had reference: Then (as you are wise) Presume this, nought can bate you of your prise; The selfe same answer that to you I made, I gave to her. I'th mean time whil'st we trade In this discourse, the greatest part assign'd us Of this our way we haue past, and left behind us The stars already; Phrygia is not far, For in our view Ida and Gargarus ar'; And if I be not much deceiv'd, I spy Paris the Iudge that must your beauties try. Iuno. But I see no such man. Merc. Close by me stand, And cast your eye that way, toward the left hand, Not to the mountain top, but to the side, Where you may spy a caves mouth gaping wide, By which a faire herd's grasing. Iuno. No such sight myne eies are guilty of. Merc. Looke here forth-right, Merc. Iust as my finger points, and in your sight Will fall a goodly herd of Beeves and Cowes; Not where the rocke unto the steepest growes, But towards the middle part, somewhat descending, Behinde them comes a Swaine, it seemes, intending To keepe them close together, lest they stray, Downe from the rocks he makes his speediest way; Holding withall a sharpe goad in his hand. Iuno. Now Hermes I begin to understand: If that be he, I spy him. Merc. 'Tis confest: But being now so neere the earth, 'tis best (If so you thinke it fitting) we descend, And towards him a moderat pace extend; Lest sousing on the sudden from an hye, The frighted Swaine may take his heeles and fly. Iuno. Hermes speakes well: Let's all at once alight; You (Venus) in this way have best insight, As she therein best skild, who (as Fame tells) Vpon this mountaine oft in caves and cells, To satiate your lust, and pay Loves debt, In Vulcans absence with Anchises met. Venus. Iuno, your scoffes and taunts are ill apply'de, Nor do they move me. Merc. Come, I'le be your Guide, These well knowne paths I did of custome tread, When Iupiter first lov'd his Ganimed; They were then frequent with me, as being sent Still to and fro, to accomplish his intent: When hither like an Egle he descended, I present was, (for alwaies I attended, And in his rape assisted) at what time He snatcht him hence, unto yon place sublime. The Lad by chance close by his Fold was fitting, Voice to the pipe, the pipe to his voice fitting. Iove soaring high, downe on the sudden shifteth, Behinde him falls, and at an instant lifteth Him gently from the earth, his crooked bill Fastning vpon the wreath the Lad kept still About his browes, griping and holding fast Yet (without harme) th' affrighted Youth, who'agast, Turneth his head the clean contrary way, Not knowing what to thinke, much lesse to say: His oten pipe he then let fall through feare. But leaving this discourse, we now draw neere The Iudge we came to seek for. Herdsman God save thee. Paris. The like to thee yong man: I only crave thee To be resolv'd, What art thou? and to tell What are these faire ones that in shape excell? They are not such as daily we behold Vpon these hills their flocks to graze and fold, But fairer much. Merc. Know, these no women be, But of more high strain and sublimitie; That, Iuno; that Minerva; Venus shee, And I the son of Maia, Mercurie. Iove greets thee thus: Why do thy spirits faile? Why trembl'st, and so suddenly lookst pale? Feare not, there is no danger, his command Is, Thou 'twixt these the vnpartiall Vmpire stand, Of their choice features: Thus he bad me say, Since thou thy selfe art beautifull, and may (Though in this Ida there be Louers many) Yet in these complements compare with any. Therefore to thee this iudgement I commit, As vnto him that best can censure it: Behold this Golden Apple, and advise, 'Tis of the choicest beauty, the rare prise. Paris. Pray give me leave, what's there inscrib'd to view; Give to the Fairest this as Beauties due. How can I, my Lord Mercury, bee'ng humane, And least of Mortals, a meere rustick swaine, Be a sufficient judge? that Iove should prove me In matters weighty and so far above me? Such desceptations would be better try'de In cities wall'd, where men are solely apply'de To delicacies: what more can you expect From me, than censure those that I protect; To say, that she Goat is than this more faire, And that this Heifer may with that compare: To iudge of such I may perhaps have skill; But these are beautifull alike, and still The more my ravisht eies vpon them dwell, The more they seem in beauty to excell: Such admirable parts in all I spye, From none of them I can retract myne eye; Where first it fastens it insists, and thence I hardly can withdraw myne Optick sence: How am I then distracted severall waies, Where still the present Object I must praise? Where having dwelt with pleasure, if by chance, Vpon a second I shall hap to glance, Myne eye's took captive and surpris'd again, For thence I strive to ransom it in vain. What judgement can I give, when I protest, The beauty that is neerest will shew best: Then what a tumult it within me breeds, When as by birth-right each of them succeeds? In briefe, who to my true sence can restore me, Their pulchritudes being circumfus'd all o're me? As if my weake conceivements to confound, At once they circle and involve me round; Now I could wish I'had eies behinde, before, And that I were like Argos, (eies all o're) Iust, only I shall then my iudgement call, When I this Apple can dispose to all. Let me collect my selfe! This is the Wife And Sister to Great Iove, with whom to have strife Were dangerous. These two his daughters, and 'Gainst them how can my opposition stand, Without much prejudice? Merc. All I can say, 'Tis Ioves command, thou must perforce obey. Paris. One thing persuade them, Mercury, I intreat, That the two Vanquisht would nor rage nor threat; But to impute it, if they lose the prise, To the fraile weaknesse of a Mortals eies. Merc. They so haue promis'd: but the time drawes on, That now thy sentence must be call'd vpon. Par. Then to please one, I'le dare the spleen of two, For in this straight what lesse can Paris do? Yet one thing, Hermes, I with leave would know, Is it enough to judge by th' outward shew, Perusing them thus habited and clad? Or wert not fit a nearer course were had? To have them all stript naked, that myne eye May view them with more curiositie? Merc. A question that from sound discretion growes, And being Iudge, they are at thy dispose. Paris. At my dispose? Then I will haue all three Stript to their skinnes. Merc. He'hath spoke; so it must be. Vnbrace your selues, put off, and nothing hide; Whilst he surveighs each part, I'le turne aside. Iuno. Well apprehended, Paris, and see, I Disrobe me first: Now this way turne thine eye, Behold my white wrists, and my arms quite bare, And are not these incomparably rare? I am nor staring, nor yet narrow ey'de, These two the marks of Cowardise or Pride; Where e're thy curious eye shall now invade, I'am equally and vniformly made. Paris. Disrobe you likewise, Venus. Minerva. Not in haste, Till she hath ta'ne her girdle from her waste, And cast it by; that first thing let her grant thee, For, Paris, shee's a Witch, and will inchant thee, Being long studied in prestigious guiles, And apt to circumvent thee with her smiles. Nor was it meet she should have come thus gay, Trickt vp in colours and such rich array, Her cheeks with sundry paintings plaistred o're, Like to some Prostitute or obscœne Whore: When nothing but bare form and feature true Should be expos'd vnto the Iudges view. Paris. Of that inchanted Belt you well advise; Cast it away. Venus. Why doth not she likewise Her glorious plumed helmet cast aside, Or heave the brim that doth her forehead hide, Displaying her uncover'd face and brest, But with her truncheon strikes vpon her crest, As if she meant the Iudge to terrifie, That he th'upright cause might not verifie? Or else (her threatning Burgaret cast hence) Her blew faint eies might give the Iudge offence. Miner. There lies myne helmet. Venus. There my girdle by. Iuno. We now all bare to thine inspection ly. Paris. O Iove, thou Wonder-maker, make me bold, What glorious objects do I now behold! What pulchritude? What extasy'de delight? What a rare Virgin 's that? how faire, how bright? But she, how venerable? nay, divine? What royall power within her front doth shine? What majestie? yet intermixt with love, She alone worthy to be wife to Iove How lovely shines the tother in my face? With what a moving irresistable grace? Her tempting lips, so paralleld in meetnesse, Whisper to me all blandishment and sweetnesse. Of this vnbounded surplusage of pleasure, I am now sated in abundant measure: Therefore so please them to my will attone, I gladly would peruse them one by one; Being ambiguous in my selfe, and doubt, (Distracted thus) I shall not long hold out: How can my brain or eye be truly guided, Being at once so many waies divided. Venus. So let us do. Paris. You two your selves retyre; But Iuno stay. Iuno. It is my sole desire. And when thou hast with thy acutest eyes Perus'd this feature, void of all disguise, And with thy most inquisitive eyes made way Through all that thou canst possibly display, I'le give the rest place. Great is my donation, If I prevaile by thee: make proclamation, That I am Vict'resse, and take Iuno's word, I'le of all Asia make thee King and Lord. Paris. I am not sway'd with gifts; but be you gon, What's right and iust must now be thought vpon. Draw neere, Minerva. Miner. See, I am at hand: If in this strife of Beauty first I stand, And thou pronounce me fairest; from thy cattell, I'le bring thee vnto many a glorious battell, From whence thou, vanquisht never shalt retyre; I'le make thee a prime Generall, and aspire To deeds of fame and honor, in all which Thou shalt be conqueror, crown'd with triumphs rich. Paris. Of thundring wars I (Pallas) have no feare; Peace (as you see) is publisht every where, Phrygia and Lydia are now both at rest, Neither with forrein nor home-broiles opprest, My fathers Empire is in quiet: yet Thinke not that I your noble gifts forget; You may hope well, yet know me thus far stayd, I being Iudge must not with bribes be swayd: Take up your garments, put your Helmet on, I'have seen sufficient, you may now be gon. Now your time calls you, Uenus. Venus. I am here, And be not sparing, Paris, with eies cleere Contemplate me in all and every member, Passe nothing cursorily, but still remember What now thou seest; fix both thine eies and heart Not in one place, but all and every part, And where the object pleaseth let them dwell; Then truly iudge if I the rest excell. Whilst th'other sences are full feasted here, Lend me (ô Faire one) for a while thine eare; I'have seen thee oft, and have observ'd thee long To be a Youth more beautifull and strong Than any other here in Phrygia bred; So I have thought, so I have often sed. Yet as I for thy curious parts commend thee, For some things I of force must reprehend thee; Who 'mongst these crags and rocks consum'st thy prime, Spending thy beauty, which will fade by time, In solitudes, with beasts that peopled are, And not in cities, who can judge what's rare: What (prethee) in these mountaines canst thou gain? Thy Beeves and Cowes shall censure thee in vain, Thou'art lost amongst them: it should be thy pride, (Richly arrayd) to seeke thee out a Bride, No Shepherdesse or rustick Damsell, such As Ida in aboundance yeelds too much. I would haue thee finde out some Grecian Queen, Such as in Argos are, or Corinth seen, Or in Lacena. Now I call to minde, There's Spartan Hellen; ô that thou couldst finde And compasse her: to thee I make confession, Shee's yong and beautifull beyond expression, Nay in all parts both outward and interior, (Still view me) no way to this shape inferior; And what above these should inflame thy minde, She is not coy, but affable and kinde: Who had she seen, as I behold thee now (All fortunes quite relinquisht) would, I vow, As knowing no way to be better sped, Fly to thine armes, thy bosome, and thy bed. Perhaps of such an one you have heard tell. Paris. Never, ô Venus, but you please me well In her description: on: to whatsoe're You speake of her, I'le give attentive eare. Uenus. She was the childe of Læda, than her mother, (Till she outstript her) liv'd not such another. For Læda was Ioves Paramor, who then To have of her fruition, like a swan, Downe sowsing came from heaven, by whose congression Hellen, is Ioves owne daughter, by succession. Paris. Of what aspect is she? Venus. White without spot; And needs she must, being 'twixt two Swans begot: That she is soft and tender, agrees well; Conceiv'd and born too in a smooth white shell; Naked she wrestles oft for exercise, And from these games returnes with many a prise: Sutors from all parts have come thronging to her, And happy he could finde the grace to woo her. Nay, such as have bin forc'd to go without her, Not only threatned, but rais'd war about her. Even Theseus held her choice of all his blisses, Nor could he stay till she were ripe for kisses, But ravisht her yet yong: but when she came To a full feather, her unequal'd fame Grew with her feature: then the Optimates, Princes, and of the Argives the chiefe States Solicited her Nuptials: the prime man Was Menelaus the Pelopidan, He wood and woon; and yet if thou agree, Her and her Dower I will confer on thee. Paris. What's this you speake? wil you your pains imploy To give me, whom another doth enioy? Venus. Is that a thing which difficult appeares? Thou art as yong in knowledge as in yeares. I promise what I can performe with ease. Paris. Shew me the means how, and it well shall please. Venus. Then thus; Thou shalt a voyage vndertake To travell through all populous Greece, and make That thy designe. Now when thou shalt arrive At Lacedemon, Helena will strive To give thee welcome. What shall then succeed Leave to my care, for thine it shall not need. Paris. But this appeares incredible to me, Impossible and meerly absurd, that she Should leave a husband, kingdome, and a Crowne, Subjects and servants, and all these her owne, Forsaking land, to hazard the seas danger, To follow me, a rude guest and a stranger. Venus. Be thou of courage; for the same intent I have two lovely children shall be sent Thy Guides and Captaines, who with all facilitie Shall worke my ends: (Cupid and Amabilitie) Cupid shall altogether undermine her, And to thy selfe impulsively combine her. With thee shall Amabilitie persever, At all occasions be about thee ever; By whose infusion thou shalt be inspir'd To'appeare to her much lovely, most desir'd. I will be present there, the more to friend thee, And will entreat the Graces to attend thee, Who shall be thy companions; all together, What cannot we compell her to? and whether? Paris. And yet, faire Venus, I am still in doubt, By what safe means this may be brought about. I love that Hellen, though as yet unknowne, And (by what means I know not) I am growne Inamor'd of her; for beholding thee, (O Venus) now me-thinks I Hellen see. Me-thinks for Greece I now am vnder saile, In Sparta am safe landed, and prevaile; That I behold her in her beauties pride, And bring from thence a bright and glorious Bride. Why, e're begin, do I applaud the end? I grieve I act not what I apprehend. Venus. Be not too forward in thy love, I prethee, But (ô thou fair'st of Neat-heards) take me with thee; Doat not too soone, nor be thou over-speedy, Till I my selfe thy Bride-bed have made ready, Having first reconcil'd you: with condition That I of this great prise may have fruition. 'Twill grace your mariage, when as Victresse I Shall present be at that Solemnitie, And after all such busie pain and toile, Vnto my triumph adde thy glorious spoile. Do but thou make this golden Apple mine, Shee with her love and bride-bed are all thine. Paris. And yet perhaps when you have gain'd this prise, You may neglect, and me (a Swaine) despise. Venus. Shall I sweare to thee? Paris. No, it shall suffice, That you have past your promise. Venus. Heare me then, (O thou most faire and beautifull of men) I vow, all lets and cavils set aside, This hand shall give thee Hellen for thy Bride; That from all future dangers I'le defend thee, And in thy journey carefully attend thee, That she shall follow thee, and prostitute Both will and body to thine amorous smile: That I'le be there to see how all things stand, And have in all these an assistant hand. Paris. But will you bring along rankt in their places Cupid and Amabilitie, with the Graces? Venus. Doubt not I will, and to make quick dispatch, Desire and Hymen, to conclude the match. Paris. For these, and these alone, as fair'st of all, Uenus, to thee I give the golden Ball. Ivpiter and Io. The Argument. Io, of whom we next discusse, Daughter toth' River Inachus, (The fairest Nymph that liv'd that time, As being in her youth and prime) Was seen by Iove, lov'd, and comprest. Queen Iuno, Her, as of the rest, Growne Iealous o're, doth project lay, How in their sports them to betray. Whom to prevent (I know not how) But Iove transhapes her to a Cow. The Goddesse knowing how indeard She was to him, comes to the Heard, And begs this Heifer. He not dar'd (However the request seem'd hard) Her to deny. Shee's now her charge, And nought her freedome can inlarge. The passages that hence may grow, The sequell will hereafter show.Enter Iô, Daphne, with other Nymphs called Naiades, the Daughters of the Rivers neere adjacent. Io. Here, Daphne, by your father Peneus streams (which falling from the top of Pindus mount, Waters Hemonian Tempe) let us sit, All daughters to the Rivers flowing neere: There old Apidanus steales (murmuring) by; Next, Poplar-shadowed Enipeus glides: Not far, Amphrisus, Æas, and 'mongst these, (Not least) my father, good old Inachus Lifts up his reverend head, with fresh floures crown'd, Prescribing lawes and limits to his streams, To bound them in their channels, curb their torrent, Lest in their pride they should o'reswell their banks; Commanding them, through thousand strange indents To pay his plenteous tribute to the seas. Daphne. And how much are we bound vnto the gods, (Faire Io) to be Nymphs, not generated From marish Meares, nor yet from standing Lakes, From sedgy brooks, thick pooles, or shallow foords, Nor yet from violent and robustuous seas. Their waters keep a smooth and gentle course, Not mov'd to fury by the warring windes; Nor when loud fluxes fall to swell their bounds, And make deep inundations on the meads: Nor can the parching drought so dry their springs, But that their channels keep a temperature: Their modest shallowes serve us for coole baths In summer time to play and wanton in: Their depths, to bate our hookes with wormes and flies, Fastned to lines made of small twisted silke, And so betray the creatures of the floud. Their chrystall waves are Myrrhors, in the which We dresse our heads, and put these curles in forme, Sometimes so cunningly, as if that Art Had power to exceed Nature: and againe, With carelesse, but so curious a neglect, As if meere Chance did antecede them both. This makes us of the Satyrs so admir'd, And of the Faunes and Swaines so much belov'd. Io. Why, have you Sutors, Daphne? Daphne. Besides such, (For these my father, by whose will I am swayd) Accounts as mean) of Gallants I have change; Both City and the Court. Io. But I may claim Prioritie above all water Nymphs, Nor can the Naiades compare with me; No, Daphne, not your selfe. The rurall Swaines, They gather from these banks mellifluous floures, And make you chaplets to adorn your browes, And shadow your choice beauty from the Sun, Nay thinke them costly Presents: but I'am one To whom the gods themselves have offred gifts. Then before all the daughters of these flouds I claim a just precedence. Daph. By what dream, Or rather by what brain-sicke fantasie Hath Io been deluded? Io. My apprehensions Are no weake fantoms to beguile the sence, But reall, and in action; with their form They beare a being substance. Daph. Hath your Beauty Had amongst men such long and strange neglect, That Io would to colour such disgrace, Accuse the gods of weaknesse? Io. Let earths Beauties Censure of Earth, meere terren as yours be, And aime no further: the while this of myne Shall be new question'd by the Powers Divine. Daph. Now by what gods, for Heav'ns sake? Io. Not the meanest, Or such as we call under-deities, As melancholy Saturn, (by his son Exil'd and banisht from the supreme rule) As Phœbus, a meere Vassal to the earth, And forc'd each naturall day to measure heaven; As Neptune, Soveraign o're the Seas, to whom Our tributary rivers hourely pay: As Mercury, though son to Iove himselfe, No better than his Foot-boy or his Page, Compeld at every summons to his speed: But of the potent Thunderer. Daph. He of whom You have learn'd to thunder these impossible braves. Io, I am asham'd. Io. Yes, that your beauty's Composed of the grosser elements, Want that attraction to call Iove himselfe Downe from his heavenly Fabrick, to behold Vs in our eminence. Daph. Strange wonder sure, To looke vpon that face in which we Mortals, And value it at best, can nothing spy, Breed admiration in a Deity! A noise of thunder. Enter Iupiter in his glory, his Trisull in his hand burning; at sight of whom they stand afrighted. Io. Appeare, Iove, in thy glory, let them know Ei, sham'd confesse their fond surmises vain, And what it is, thy god-head to prophane. Daph. Fly, fly, lest we be thunder-strooke, away; Let's seeke our safety, danger's in our stay. Exit. Iup. Thou Daphne, who Ioves presence now dost shun, Swifter ere long shalt from Apollo run. But there lie that which makes us terrible, Affrighting gods and men. Io to thee In calmes I come, and Faire one make me proud, To seale the love which I so long have vow'd. Io. What steale? what vow? Iup. Both thou shalt finde imprest On thy smooth cheeke, soft lip, and Ivory brest. Io. Forbeare to handle; yet I never knew A man so bold and rude: Can gods dispence, To teach us Women unknowne impudence? Iup. Nay rather we solicit you to prove What yet you have not try'de, the sweets of love. Io. Things that I would not learn. Iup. A Truant still? If you want art, Io, I can teach you skill: Give me your hand, your lip: why these but are The Prologue to a pastime much more rare. Women by nature are ambitious, and Long to know what they do not understand. I'le practise you in that which you before Ne're knew. Io. In all this lip-sport? or what more Is in these kisses meant? I am so dull,— Iup. All these my Comment shall explain at full. In vain you strive. Io. Should I do ought save well, I were vndone, my fathers flouds would tell; These are his banks, they'l blab: What mean you? fie; They swell above their bounds, only to spie And see what we are doing. Pish, away, Such deeds of darknesse can you do by day? Besides, shall I consent to what you mean, Not all these silver drops can wash me clean. Iup. Where I doe stain I can again make pure: And that Day shall not hinder us, be sure: Arise you fogs and damps, your vapors gather, To shroud us both from Iuno and thy father. Io. You make me blush. A great damp ariseth. Iup. These blushes none shall see; Behold these mists, to curtain us and thee. Io. Well, when what most you sue for, you have won, My comfort is, I see not what is done. Iup. And Io now I'le teach thee sports untry'de, In darknesse best a Virgins blush to hide. Exeunt Enter Iuno. Iuno. Not in the heav'ns? where then? In vain it were To search the seas; the blew-vein'd Nereæ, And green hair'd Dorides with all their brats, Styl'd by the names of water goddesses, (Though Prostitutes to Neptune) 'mongst them all Yeeld not a face to please his curious eye. Where then? The earth? I that, if any place, Yeelds choice of tempting Beauties: Argos bred A golden Danaë, Thebes afforded an Alcmena and wanton Semele; Pelagia, a Calisto; Sparta nurst A swan-like Læda, (Strumpets) of all which I sought a sure, but found a vain revenge. Why may not then Thessalian Tempe yeeld Like fascination, since their impudence Is more and more encourag'd by my wrongs: Here then I make inquiry. The day's cleare; Whence come these foggy mysts that choke the aire, In so serene and bright an hemisphere? Aut ego faller, aut ego ledar. If from the earth, this sudden overcast Would smell of thicke and suffocating damps: If from the aire, or any sulph'rous fire, It would be found by their caliditie. If from the Rivers, or these moorish fennes, Humiditie would tell vs whence they were. No, these are forc'd, and by some god-like power, Created for a more peculiaruse: And now my jealousie most truly prompts me, 'Tis some illusion, made to blinde myne eies From a new injury; which if I finde, On this one Strumpet I will study more, Than all that have my vengeance scap'd before. Exit. Enter Iupiter, and Io transformed into a Cow. Iup. The clamorous Queen's descended from the Spheres, To finde the cause of this illusive Fog: But Io I have so transhap'd thee now, That she by no means can discover thee; And in that confidence I'le front her boldly. Iun. Iove heare? my jelousies are then not vain, Howe're I'le give him gentle entertaine, Concealing what's within. Iup. My lovely Iuno? Iun. My Brother and my Husband Iupiter? Iup. What make you here on earth? Iun. What other reason, But that I mist my soveraign Lord in heaven; And then I yoakt my Peacocks, to their bills Ty'd silken bridles, and in my light chariot Made of fine gold, and deckt with Estrich plumes, Descended as you see. But what affaire (Might Iuno be so bold to aske her Lord) Detaines you now in Tempe? Iup. Though it fits not Your Sex to aske a thing that ill beseemes, Or pry into the counsels of the gods; Yet thus much I'le resolve you? I came downe To censure here some causes amongst men, And set things crooked upright. Iun. Now I spy That which hath drawne him headlong from the sky, And I will make th' Adulterer himselfe Author of my iust vengeance. Iup. Thou once gon, Spoken aside. She were again transhap'd, and we both one. Sweet Iuno will you once more mount your Chariot, And keep your state above. My designes ended, I will not long be from you. Iun. My craft now Shall match his cunning; if there be in me A godhead, I have cast her destiny. Deare loving Lord, since 'twas my kindenesse drew me To see vnto your safety (though I know The Deities in every place secure) Give me some gift on earth, that I in heaven May applaud your royall bounty. Iup. Be it bred Beneath the Moon, 'tis my Saturnia's. Iun. I have not seen so sweet and lovely a Beast White without spot or stain; Is she of the herd Belonging to these Medowes? Iup. She is, no doubt. Why doth my Iuno aske? Iun. To make her myne. Iup. A gift too small for Iuno to entreat, Or Iove to grant; Demand some greater boon. Iun. This Cow or nothing. Iup. Shee's not for thy use; What would my Love do with her? Iun. Only this, (Being above the rest most beautifull) To sacrifice her to your Deity. (Iupiter starts.) Iup. Not for the triple world: What was it, Sweet, That you of me demanded? Iuno. Now to know (Aside) What put you in this feare? Nay I have beg'd, And must not be deny'd. And have I found you? Iup. In what a streight am I? her to betray, And give her up into her enemies hand, In man would prove a savage cruelty, Much more in us: and to deny a gift Appearing of so small a consequence, Would but augment her too much jelousie, And open that which is as yet conceal'd. Iuno. What hope have I to enioy greater things, That am deny'd a trifle? Iup. Say I will not, (Aside) And give no reason; it may then appeare, This Heifer to be no such as she seems. Well, she is yours; but how will you dispose her? Iun. So carefully, because she is your gift, My seruant Argus with a hundred eyes Shall guard her from all dangers. Iup. 'Tis enough, In that, to us you shall expresse your love. But prove he to her churlish or vnkinde, (Aside. There's one, at once his hundred eies shall blind. So, she is now your charge. Exit. Iun. And being myne, I'le teach base Earth to injure what's divine. Where is my seruant Argus? Enter Argus with a hundred eyes. Argus. Who's that calls? The sacred goddesse Iuno? What new service Will you command your vassal? Iun. Tak't in briefe; Beholdst thou This? This? This no matter what, Not worth a name; only a thing I loath; Out on thee: But I'le spare my railing words, To expresse my hate in action. Arg. What's the cause The poore beast trembles thus? Iun. A Beast indeed: Like such she shall be us'd; behold her, Argus; Are these lips fitting for a god to kisse? These hoofes apt palms to gripe? these teats fit pillowes? On which a Deity should brest himselfe? These, eyes to tempt? or this an hide to touch? These hornes? (ô me) in myne owne heraldry She mocks me without blushing. Argus. In all this How will you use my service? Iuno. As a Spy: An hundred eyes thou hast, of all which number I will allow thee two to sleep by turnes; The rest to watch this Strumpet; and of all, But two to winke, the rest to gaze at full: Behinde thee thou hast eyes, both sides, before; Which way soe're thou turnst shee's in thy view. “A thousand he had need, all piercing bright, “To watch a Lover from his choice delight. Arg. And is this all? Iuno. Something I had forgot: Thou art an Herdsman, Argus, and thou know'st To tame vnruly cattell; she is such: In some unworthy halter binde her neck, For such a Beauty the first Carkanet. Her browsing be the Brakes and bitter couche, For dainties feed her with the sourest herbs; Lead her through briers &amp; brambles, which may scratch Her itching skin even till her soft sides bleed, Raise vp the mud in cleare springs when she drinks, Keep her from shadow, in the parching Sun, Till she be stung with horse flies, and the brees: Let her not rest but where the ground's still bare; Feather her bed with thistles and sharp thornes; And for her footing chuse the barren paths Strow'd with loose pointed flints to gall her hoofes. Argus farewell, I leave her to thy trust, A sweet reuenge for her insatiate lust. Exit. Argus. Drawing this piece of Beasts flesh thus along, Me-thinks I looke like Lybian Hercules Leading the Dog of hell: nay I shall fit her According to my charge, and I will keep thee (Calfe with the white face) safe enough from bulling, The longest day that I haue eye to see. What do you hang an arse? Ptrow, come along, I'le leade you to bare feeding, and finde sallets To take downe your full flanks and these plump cheeks. Along, I'le watch thee well en ough from shrinking Necke out of collar. Nay, on; thou shalt finde, Though my face from thee, I have eyes behinde. Exit. Enter Inachus the father of Io, Peneus, Appidanus, Amphrisus, (all Riuers) Daphne, and the other Nymphs, &amp;c. Inachus. Speake not to me of comfort, Io's lost! Had she miscarried on the earth, her body Would have given instance of her timelesse fate: Or had she been by savage beasts devour'd, Her garments stain'd with bloud would tell her death. Had she in myne or these my neighbour floods Perisht, they would have borne her gently vp, And cast her on some banke for buriall. Peneus. Deare Inachus do not torment your selfe, Nothing so lost, but may be found at length: For hauing seen no token of her death, There's of her life some hope. Amphr. Behold, Amphrisus With this your antient neighbour Appidan, Peneus and others, as we moane your losse, So in our pitty come to comfort you. Appid. O, brackish not your waters with your teares, That yet run pure and fresh; but be of comfort. Inach. In vain you speake of what you cannot give, As I in vaine lament myne Io's losse. Enter Argus leading in Io. Arg. How now, curst Cow? What, start you at that name? I'le make your long hornes shorter. Inac. Io, where? If under earth, I'le send my springs in search As low as to the Centre. Io, where? If snatcht vp in the aire, like dew exhal'd, With eyes fixt vpward I will still thus gaze, Till from the bosome of some gentle cloud, Thou drop into myne armes. Faire Io, where? Arg. I thinke the beast hath breezes in her taile, She cannot keepe her still. Inach. But stay, what's hee That leads the fairest Heifer tether'd fast, That e're drunke of my streames; for Io's sake I loue all creatures that are beautifull. Arg. How now you Harlatry? Inach. Thou churlish heardsman, I know thee, Argus, jealous Iuno's Spy, Why canst thou be so fierce to one so faire? Arg. What's that to thee, or any of you all. Pen. Amongst all creatures Nature ever made, Some to have native beauty 'bove the rest, Commanding soft affection, this is such. Arg. With all myne eyes I spy no difference, But love all beasts as beasts. Inach. The more beast thou. Pen. But why should this, the fairest of all heards, Cast such a pitteous moving eye on you, As wooing your acquaintance? Inach. And 'tis true, Where ere I go, her sad eye followes me, So she too, did not Argus keepe her backe: See, see, how gently she endures my touch, And makes an offer (had shee power) to speake. Heare, take these floures, and now she kist myne hand, Whilest pitteous teares drop down her tender cheeks. What should I say? poore beast I pitty thee, And all the good I can do is to grieve, Th' hast such a churlish Keeper. Pen. Inachus, I feare There's something greater in't. Inach. What greater can be, Vnlesse there live some vnderstanding spirit In this irrationall and savage shape: What wouldst thou have, that in this bestiall figure Beg'st humane pitty? what intends she, thinke you, By pawing on the ground? Observe her, brethren, It seemes she hath writ somthing in the dust, And see, two letters are imprinted faire, As if it were my Io's Character, And here I reade Io. Pen. Io: and see, in every step she hath trod, That word imprest. Inach. This she? whom I so long in vain have sought, Through forrests, groves, and mountains, fields &amp; floods? This she, whom I in finding shall most lose? O miserable wretched Inachus, More miserable Io, thus transform'd: I terme thee lovely, till I knew thee such; But when thy former beauty I record, Thou ougly art, mishap'd, and terrible. Can the gods suffer this? Arg. Leave this your howling. Forbeare, or in this cord I leade her forth, Ile strangle her. Dare not to follow me, There's danger in me both waies; she shall perish, And you must bleed. Come, Minion we will clime Yon craggy mountain top, a prospect fit For Argus only, who (not moving) can Behold at once from whence the foure winds blow, And there with her I'le like a Beacon stand, To watch and to give warning. Will you drive? I say pursue me not, for if you do, Ile make her sure, and you repent it too. Why ptrow there. (Exeunt Argus and Io. Amph. With what a pitteous action, wailing tongue, She gave a loving, but a loath farewell. Apid. But that the high Powers are not limitable, Who would beleeve this wonder possible. Pen. We must not question what the gods can do, Yet in th' extremitie of all extremes, And worst of bads, despaire not, Inachus. Inach. How easie 'tis for those that tast not griefe, Bid others be of comfort. Amph. Reverend Sir,— Inach. There is no reverence due: not to the gods, If this be seen and suffer'd: O my Io. With acclamations I will fill the Meades: In stead of prayers, Ile execrate and curse, And to the burthen of myne untun'd shreeks The rocks and caves shall echo to thy name. Pen. But Inachus.— Inach. But when your Chanels swell, You can have dammes and sluces to discharge Superfluous waters, lest your torrents rage; And will you bar the conduits of myne eies To ease the flux of my surcharged heart? My care was, Io, to provide a man To be thine husband; but I now must finde One of the bellowing heard to cal me sonne: To have some pretty infant draw thy brest, But now must some py'de urchin sucke thy teats. But that I am immortall, and the dores And gate to death against me are debar'd, I'de weepe my selfe to nothing, and this Beeing Scatter amongst my flouds, that mixt with them, They might (in lesse than drops) amongst their waves, Convey me to the all-devouring seas, To mix my brine with his, and be so lost; And lost, forgotten: But I am still the same, And Io, I'le still call vpon thy name. Exeunt. Enter Iupiter and Mercury. Iupit. How am I mov'd with Inachus exclaimes? Why are the eares of gods kept open still, But first to heare, then pitty? hast thou not, Mercury, Seene Io's teares? Perceiv'd her scalding sighs, And even thus far heard her suspires and grones, Tortur'd beneath that Neatherd churlish groome, More savage than the beasts he feeds? Merc. I have. Iup. How oft hath she, thinking to heave her hands For divine pitty; when she spy'de her hoofes Cast them to th' earth, with them her head with shame, And bellowing when she would complain her griefe, Started at her owne sound? How oft, when grazing on her fathers banks, (These fruitfull banks on which she vs'd to sport) Offring to drinke, when in his Crystall streams, In which so often she with pride hath lookt, On her white brow, red cheeke, and golden curles: Now when she spies those lips a god hath kist, Stretcht to so vast a widenesse, penthous'd o're With inlarg'd nosthrils; looking on those eyes, (In which 'twas once my sole delight to looke) To see them broad and glaring; her cleare brow Late deckt with shining jewels, prest with hornes. How oft hath she (more frighted than asham'd) Thought, from her selfe, in vaine, to hide her selfe? Merc. This can you see? not study how to helpe? Iup. I do, and will, by thyne aid, Mercury; Hye therefore to the top of Pindus mount, (There Argus keepes his watch) in some disguise; Thy Caduceus and thy wings layd by, Finde with the slave some conference, till by cunning Thou charm'st his waking eies, and being fast, Cut off his head, and with one blow extinguish So many lights at once. Merc. Great Iove I will: But thus condition'd, you will interpose Your awfull power 'twixt me and Iuno's hate. Iupit. Presume th' art safe in vs. Merc. Then Argus dies; One fatal stroke shall shut an hundred eies. Exit. Enter Argus leading Io in an halter. Argus. How dost thou like thyne usage, madam Cow? Your lodging and your dyet? How dost thinke This hempen chaine becomes thee? Will you see Your sweet face in the riuer once againe? Or how doth your faire beastship feele your selfe? Wouldst thou not haue some Bulchin from the herd To physicke thee of this venereall itch? If not, I'le see what Nettles muddy streams, Couch-grasse and weeds, thornes, briers, &amp; flints can do. These failing, here's a goad to prick your sides. If all these medicines will not tame your lust, I'le muster new inventions. Nay, I know You looke for pitty, but it lives not here. In this high watch-tower stand I sentinel, To spy who comes and goes. I am made thy gardian, Ile gard thee both from danger and from rest; 'Twas in thy hearing, Iuno's late behest. Enter Mercury like a yong formal Shepheard. Merc. This shape may prove suspectlesse, and the fittest To cloud a godhead in; my plumed hat And fether'd sandals, by the which I am knowne, I have left at foot of this descending hill: My snaky Rod I have to this sheephooke turn'd. Accommodated thus, to Argus now, Aristors sonne: behooves him keepe good watch, Whom Mercury (Ioves son) intends to catch. But Many-eyes have spy'de me. Arg. How now shepheard, There's none who in that simpl shape or name Needs treason feare. Should any come prepar'd For mischiefe, I have lights about me shine Sufficient to prevent it: but thou seem'st None of such ranke. Come sit by me and talke. Merc. The servant to the great Saturnia Doth me no common grace. Arg. Thou know'st me then? Merc. What shepheard but not only knowes your name, But feares your strength? Arg. Nay sit (by me th'art safe) And tell some pretty tales to make me laugh: I have not long been merry. Merc. First resolve me; Is that faire heifer of some neighbour herd, You drag thus in an halter? Arg. Shee's my charge, A witty Brute, a most ingenious beast, A very apprehensiue Animal, That can do tricks: she hath been taught, I tell thee, To write and reade. Merc. Argus, not possible. Argus. 'Tis as I said before: but having her, Some pretty tale, I prethee. Merc. But what if Some goddesse should live in this shape disguis'd, To whom you are so churlish. I could tell you A story to that end. Arg. Such toyes I love. Merc. Thus the Pierides report: The Gyants Assembled and made war against the gods, Heapt Ossa upon Pelion, Caucasus Vpon Pernassus, Pindus above them; Hill upon mountain, mountain vpon hill, Till they had made a scale that reacht to heaven. The conflict then began: the monstrous Typhon Was Captain of the Gyants: Of the gods Great Iove, Archduke. The Generals met and fought. In briefe (to cut off circumstance) the earth Prevaild 'gainst heauen. The gods are forc't to fly: Iove, chac'd by Typhon into Egypt, chang'd Himselfe into a Ram: Apollo, frighted, Turnes to a Crow, Bacchus into a Goat, Iuno a Cow, Diana to a Cat; Venus into a Fish, and tooke the sea; Mars to a Pigmy, lest he should be knowne: And Mercury, syrnam'd the crafty god, Into a Fox. Arg. A Fox? But I would meet That craft which could beguile Argus bright eyes. Proceed, proceed, good shepheard. Merc. Why may not then Some goddesse be included in this shape? Arg. A goddesse, saist thou? thinke me equall then With one of these huge Gyants, if not greater, That have the power and potencie to leade A god-head in a string. But ha, what musick (Musicke. Was that strooke vp? 'Twas sweet and delicat, Nor have I heard the like. Merc. My fellow shepheards Behinde that rocke (from whence an echo growes) For the more grace have chus'd that place as fittest, Prest to bestow their cunning vpon you, Whom they have heard, much tyr'd with watching long. Arg. And shall we have some merry Madrigall To passe away the time with? Merc. What you please. Arg. I faine would know how first these Pipes came up, That make this dainty musicke? Merc. First from Pan The god of Shepheards. In the memory Of the Nymph Syrinx, Musicke strike and tell, How in th' Arcadian plaines it once befell. Mercuries Song. Sirinx, one of Dian's traine, Hunting with her on the plaine, Arm'd alike with shafts and bow; Each from other would you know? Which from which could not be told, Saue ones was horne, the others gold. Arg. Hey ho; very fine musicke I promise you. Merc. Now it begins to worke. Pan he sees himselfe makes fine, In his cap he pricks a Pine: Now growes carelesse of his heard, Sits by brookes to prune his beard, Meets her, and hath minde to wooe, Much he speakes, and more would doe. Arg. 'Tis pleasing, but it makes me melancholy, And drowsie too withall. Merc. 'Twill do anon. (Aside. Still he profers, she denies; He pursues (for Syrinx flies.) Past her knees her coats vp flew, He would faine see something new: By the leg and thigh he guest (It seemes) the vertue of the rest. Arg. Were it not for my charge I'de take a nap. Merc. This addes wings vnto his pace, The goale for which he is in chace. She addes feathers to her speed; Now it was no more than need. Almost caught, Alas she cries, Some chaste god my shape disguise. Arg. The rest may sleepe secure, so I can keepe But two eyes waking. Merc. Here's a charme for them. Lædon heares, and girts her round, Spies a reed that makes sweet sound: Such is Syrinx. Wondring Pan Puts it to his mouth anon: Yet Syrinx thou art myne he said, And so of her his first pipe made. My charm hath tooke effect; with these thyne eyes Take thy last sleepe, thou hast not one to see; My taske is done, and Io thou now free. (cuts off his head. Exit. Enter Iuno. Iuno. The dying groans of Argus call'd me down, To know what of his lustre is become. What, all extinct? and is no memorie Extant of their knowne brightnesse? hath one night (Whose nature should be to be proud of stars) Shut at one time an hundred? nay at once? Should euery piece of time deprive so many, How shortly would these lights innumerable Be vanisht into nothing? But deare Argus, That all may know thou hadst a louing mistresse, Grieuing thou shouldst thus perish for her sake; And that these eies (now blinde) in after-times May giue a light to perpetuitie, And memorize thy name, thy faith and fall, Thy hundred eyes (who wast for Iuno slain) I will transport into my Peacocks traine; Whilst such a bird hath breeding, and can bee, Her painted feathers shall remember thee. Enter Iupiter and Mercury. Iup. And whilest an heifer graseth on the plaine, Io, her hoofe shall still imprint thy name. My Iuno are we friends? Let her long divorce, My faire intreats, with Inachus exclaimes Invoke thy love and pitty, by my life. Iuno. You vse me like a sister, not a wife, My bed is still so empty. Iup. Now by Styx, An oath no god was ever knowne to breake, Signe her release, she shall hereafter be To Iove as a meere stranger. Iuno. Since by that you sweare, What's past is lost, it cuts off future feare, Saving my quarrell, Mercury, to you. Merc. Madam, I did your seruant no great wrong, Save teaching him to relish a new song. Iuno. Where jars are mediated, vain it were Call injuries in question. As with Iupiter, With you we are atton'd. Iup. Now Mercury, Since Iuno is appeas'd, fetch Io hither, In her owne native beauty, whom we will Restore vnto her father. Merc. Sir I shall. Enter Inachus with the other Riuers, &amp;c. Inach. O Iupiter! ô Iuno! Iup. Inachus, Surcease exclaimes, thy prayers have had accesse, Thy teares been pittied, and thy losse bemoan'd; Argus is slain, and faire Saturnia pleas'd, And Io to her pristine shape restor'd. Enter Mercury with Io. Inach. Thanks you immortall gods. Merc. No sooner was this mighty Queene appeas'd, But the rough haire dropt from her tender skin, Her hornes fell off, her eies appeard to shine In a lesse orbe, her mouth and lips contracted Both into compasse, and their native sweetnesse, Her shoulders are restor'd, fingers and hands; Her parted hoofe diuided into five, Now with two feet contented, for on them She straightway stood erect, and of a Cow, Save whitenesse, nought retaining, and even yet She feares to speake, lest she in stead of words Should bellow forth her minde. Io. Yet will I dare To give my father greeting. Inach. O my childe. Iuno. I am still jealous of that face: What's he That makes but a mean sport of wedlocks breach, But thinkes to violate an oath no sin, Though calling testates all the Stygian gods? Great King and Lord, Brother and Husband too, If I be worthy of those attributes Your self have daignd, and all the gods approve, Grant me a second boon. Iup. For thy remisnesse In Io's late affliction, speake, 'tis granted. Iuno. Then from these fields of Tempe banish her, As far as into Egypt. Inach. From her father? Iup. Be you pleas'd, And Iuno shall, I hope, be satisfied. Io, you shall to Egypt be confin'd, Be that your punishment for Iuno's hate: Which executed you shall taste our love. In Egypt held a goddesse thou shalt be, Ador'd and worshipt in thine heifers shape; Oblations shall be daily offer'd thee, And Incense burnt to thy divinitie, And this for ever. Iuno, in vain you sorrow, Ioves word is past, and cannot be revok'd. And now with this one Maxim we conclude; Where lust is punisht, though the bloud be tainted, It (after such long Penance) may be sainted. Exeunt. FINIS.Spærchius, a River whose banks were round beset with Poplar trees, and therefore called Popuifer, Enipœus, Apidanus, Amphisus, and Æas, &amp;c. only the names of Rivers, whose currents and chanels were famous in those parts of Greece: for your better satisfaction, I refer you to Ovid his Metamorph. lib 1. upon the same argument. Pindus, was a mountaine in Thessaly, sacred to Apollo and the Muses, &amp;c. Hemonian Tempe. Tempe was a pleasant valley flourishing with trees, herbes, and flowers, scituate in Thessaly at the foot of the hill Hemus. It was much celebrated by the Muses, as lying betwixt Ossa and Olympus. The River Peneus, Larisa, and the Ægean Sea, &amp;c. Naiades, were Nymphs or Fayries of the wells, and fountaines. Pierides, were the Muses, so called from Pierus, or else a mountaine in Greece of that name: this Pierus had nine daughters, who contended with the Muses in singing, and being vanquished by them, were transformed into chattering Pyes: in glory of which victory the Muses would be called by their names. Syrinx, an Arcadian Nymph, who flying from the embraces of Pan, the god of the Shepheards, at her intercession to the gods changed into a Reed, her prayer being to preserve her virginity. Styx, a certaine well in Arcadia, the water of which is so cold and venemous, that whosoever drinketh thereof, immediatly dyeth. It eateth and wasteth yron or brasse, neither can it be contained in any thing, but the hoof of a Mule; some say Alexander the Great was poisoned with the water of this river, by Antipater, at the persuasion of Aristotle, the great Philosopher, and Tutor to Alexander. The Poets feigne it to be a river in hell, and so sacred to the gods, that if any of them sweare by it, and breake his oath, he shall be deprived of his godhead, and drinke no Nectar for an hundred yeares after. Gargarus, so called of Gargarus, the son of Iupiter, it is commonly taken for the top or Apex of the high hill Ida, where the said god had an Altar consecrateunto him, it is situate betwixt the Propontis Abidos, and the Hellespont in Greece, in longitude 55. in latitude 42. It is also a towne under the hill so called. Alcmena, the wife of Amphytrio the Theban, in whose absence Iupiter came in the shape of her husband, comprest her and begot Hercules. Semele, the mother of Bacchus, begot on her by Iupiter, from whence he tooke the denomination of Semeleius. Maia, the daughter of Atlas, and Pleiones, and therefore Atlantiades, of whom Iupiter begot Mercury. By Cadmus faire daughter is intended Semele before spoken of. Moericus, Aristæus, Thrasicles, &amp;c. are names of men whome the Author aimed at (living in those times) according to his fancy. Iapygium, or Iapyges, these derived their names from Iapyx the sonne of Dedalus, and were said to be Cretenses by their originall, and wandring abroad to seeke Colaurus, sonne of Minois, came unto the same place, where after they inhabited, these in time grew to such a profuse riotise, intemperance and wantonnes, that forgetting their Country modesty and honesty, they painted their faces, and wore other folkes haire, and were never seene abroade but sumptuously, and richly appareld; their houses were as beautifull as the Temples of the gods. At length they came to such a height of pride and insolence, that they cast off all religion, entring and seasing on the ornaments, revenues and donaries of the Churches. And at length were all consumed by firy globes falling from heaven, &amp;c. Evphorbus, was a noble Trojane, the sonne of Panthus, who wounded Patroclus, and was after slaine by Achilles, being hurt in the thigh; he was said to have one made him of gold. Pythagoras said, that his soule was in him in that time of the Troian warre, that hee might better perswade his Scholars. Concerning the opinion which he held concerning the transmigration of mens soules, from one body to another. What other difficulties you shall finde in these short Dialogues, you shall find in some or other fully explicated. Cimmerians, were people dwelling in Italy, betweene the Baiæ and Cumæ, so invironed with hills, that the Sunne never appeared unto them, hence came the Proverb Tenebræ Cimmeriæ, the Cimmerian darknesse. Erix, Promontory: Erix was the sonne of Venus, slaine by Hercules, and buried in a mountaine of Cicilia, so called after him, in which place Venus had a Temple erected unto her, and from that she had the denomination of Eriana, &amp;c. Python, was a mighty huge Serpent, which Iuno sent unto Latona when she was with child by Iupiter, to devoure her, but she went to her sister Astrea, who protected her, and she was after delivered of two twins, Apollo and Diana. Endymion, was beloved by the Moone, who courted him upon Latmus hill; and therefore said to looke pale by reason of the great affection which she bore unto him. Tithon, or Tithonus, was the sonne of Laomedon, who desiring long life, was so wasted with old age, that the Poets faigned him to be turned into a Grashopper: he was also said to be beloved of Aurora, the morning; because he used to rise early, which was thought to be the reason why he preserved his life so long. Apollo and Daphne. The Argument. After many a louing greeting, Mars and Venus point a meeting; And that Vulcan might not haue Least note thereof, they chuse a Cave Obscure and darke, to which they trust, Intending there to sate their lust. But when themselues most safe they thinke, The rising Sun pries through a chinke, Sees all, and what hee sees discovers To Vulcan, touching these two Lovers. Th' inraged Smith taking foule scorne To be affronted with the horne, Provides for them a subtill ginne, In hope to take them both therein. His plot prevail'd, and now being fiery In iust reuenge, by strict inquiry, To finde where these by custome met, He by his art contrives a Net, More fine than is the Spiders thred, And yet of wire; which he so spred About the place, all things compact So well, he tooke them in the act: And then doth all the gods invite, Who came at once to view that sight. Some jeer'd, some pitty'd their disgrace, One wisht himselfe in Mars his place. Tet for all this, the churlish Sir So kept them that they could not stir. Mars chafes and threats, and strugling keeps: But Venus blushes first, then weeps. And when the gods could laugh no more, Then Vulcan freed them, not before. Now Venus knowing all this done Was first discover'd by the Sun; Against him open war proclaimes, And at him her revenge she aimes: Cupid she vseth as her instrument. And that's of our Scæne the sole argument.Enter the riuer Peneus the father of Daphne, Daphne, Amphrisus and Apidanus two Riuers that were Suiters unto her; two Nymphs Attendants on Daphne. Peneus. Why lovely Daphne, will you lose your Youth, And let your best houres passe you? Well you know, Beautie's a Floure, which not being cropt in time, Soone withers on the stalke, and then (alas) Will neither serve for vse nor ornament. You owe me sweet grand-children, pretty babes, Even for your birth you do: it is a debt That I would see discharg'd: I to my parents Paid it in thee; it is a Bond stands firme, 'till canceld in thy sweet posteritie. See, I have brought thee Suitors, choise ones too, Two noble Rivers, both residing neere, Amphrisus, and still-flowing Appidane, Yong, and of means, both active and of strength To wrestle against barrennesse, and give The hugge the foile. Being dead, I live in thee: Live thou too in thine issue; so successively Our Line and memory shall never perish, But last as long as Time. Amph. Your father (Daphne) Counsels with iudgement, and this argument I could by many reasons amplifie. As, That without succession (one age past) Mankinde should cease to be. O what a punishment Deserve they from the gods, that would destroy So glorious a creation, and to leave So wonderfull a fabricke as the world is, To no admirers? Appid. Save the Plants and Beasts; And what can they distinguish? Pen. Therefore, Daughter Make vse of time: a season being past, Can never be recall'd, no, not a moneth. A moneth? no day, no houre, no minute can: Therefore make use of opportunitie Which throwes it selfe vpon thee: but being streightned, Will after prove a stranger; the least instant By long repentance cannot be redeem'd. Daphne. To you I bow in duty, as to a father; And these affront in noble courtesie, Not wronging him, to shew my breeding base, Scoffing your profer'd love with womanish scorne. His counsels, your persuasions, I commend, Knowing both fitting, were they seasonable. That Maids should love men I am not ignorant, Or that the breeding world should still encrease; That Progenie should reach from age to age, And that the gods make't a necessitie, To have all their miraculous works admir'd: All this I know; but Amph. I'le proceed: But what Can you produce against this? Daph. Heare me out: But when I in my best considerat thoughts Ponder my youth, and what it is to loue; That vowes are tyes not easie to be loos'd, And that the smallest finger can pluck on What not the hand and arme can well put off: That Mariage is a Maze, which enter'd in, The line is snatcht thence which should guide us out. Ere hazard then that vnknowne labyrinth, Much blame me not to pause. Pen. What needst thou feare? Fond timerous Girle, did not thy mother this Long time before thee? Appid. Nay, hereafter too May not your daughter do so? Daph. I'le resolve you That, when I have a daughter of my yeares, And tutor'd by her mother. Amph. Excellent Nymph, These are evasions meere vnnecessarie; We know you to be ripe, and our selves grown, Betwixt us is equalitie in state, And paritie in yeares: nor is our course Irregular or indirect, we come Admitted by your father, as a way Plain, and not interdicted: nor is our suit So far with cradle it may childish seem; Nor so old, to appeare decrepit: we are two Rivals, yet friends; so you chuse one of either, Even he that is despis'd rests satisfied, Nor is our love divided. Daph. I commend you: There is of you lesse danger, and least feare That you should die of love; when both of you Come with like premeditation to disgest A rigorous answer. Appid. Pray what should we do? Our service we have offer'd equally: The world is wide, and if we speed not here, We must provide us elsewhere. Daph. Worthy friends. To be most plain, to me most pleasing is: Then take as plain an answer; I confesse me (Weake as I am) vnworthy of your love. And yet not so low pris'd, but have bin courted Both by as great and good. Nor can you blame me, If I in adding to your worths, shall spare From mine, in the least kinde to derogate. To you then, as my equals, I entreat; Or if you shall deny me, Daphne then Proclaimes it as her will. I must retyre me For some few moneths, in them to meditate What mariage is, and truly study man, (A booke in which I yet have truanted.) Now, if I in my more maturitie, And after some cessation of your suits, Can ground this Maxime, Man is worthy us, And we of him; wee'l breviat your long motions Within a few short termes. Amph. You speake but reason: And so long wee'l attend you. Appid. Most fit, that such as bargain for their lives, Should reade us o're and o're, before they set Their hands to that Indenture. We are pleas'd. Daph. And I that you are so. Nor can my father At this be discontented. Inach. Not I, Childe; I would not hurry on my ioyes too fast, Having such hope of them. And yet, sweet Daphne, The more thou hasts their harvest, the ripe crop Shall be to them more welcome. For this time 'Tis best to leave her to her privacie: More leisure that she hath to meditate, Lesse time you have in which to be resolv'd, 'Twill shorten expectation. Amph. May these houres That adde vnto your yeares, still as you grow, Increase toward us your love. Appid. Friend you pray well, And in that hope I take a loving leave, By kissing your faire hand. Exit. Daph. You understand a curtesie as well, Once being done, as she that knowes to do't. Farewell. Where be my maids? 1 Nymph. My Lady, at hand. Daph. Doth either of you know what this love is, That men so much affect it? 2 Nymph. Trust me, not I: I never lookt so far into man; and most sure I am, man never yet entred so farre into me, that I should know how to define it. But can you tell the reason why this little god is still portraid like a childe? Daph. I think, because that dotage which he breeds Only belongs to children. 1 Nymph. But why naked? Daph. Either t' affright the Modest; or to such As vow to him, to expresse their impudence. 2 Nymph. But why with bow and arrowes? Daph. That denotes Inconstancie, because the shafts of love Are ever shot at random. 1 Nymph. Wherefore hoodwinkt? Daph. Howe're his shafts are aim'd, it shewes his kinde, Because they strike the eies of Reason blinde. 2 Nymp. Then am I with Love quite out of love, because at these yeres I should be loath to have one to lead me. Daph. Yet do I love the beauty of the spring, To listen to the birds, with various layes To welcome in his comming. I affect The pride and warmth of Summer, to behold Aboundant Autumne poure his harvest forth In plenteous sheafes; to see the presses bleed A flowing vintage. But I most admire The glory of the Sun who comforts these: For without him, what were the earth? what heaven? If all were darknesse, who should then discerne The lustre of the one or of the other, The fresh fertilitie proudly adorn'd With choise and change of all discolour'd floures? More than a cas'd up Iewell, what were Beauty, Without the Sun to give a brightnesse to't? What's ornament, without the Sun to iudge it? What to be faire or foule, without the Sun, To censure and distinguish which is best? The Sun's the deity which I adore. Here then upon this verdure cast your selves, And rest a while; not long 'tis e're he will In all his glory mount the Eastern hill. They lay themselues downe, then enter Venus and Cupid. Venus. Here on the top of the mount Ericine Ambush thy selfe, (a place sacred to me) Where thou mayst boldly front the god of Light, Who hath by this already chac'd hence night. I'le leave thee now: strike, but strike home, my son, I'le in these shades absent me whil'st 'tis done. Cupid. He mocks my bow, but Phœbus soon shall finde Cupid hath power to strike the Sun-god blinde. Enter Apollo with his glittering beames. Apollo. The stars are frighted from the firmament, And at the sight of our illustrious beams Darknesse vnto the blacke Cymmerians fled. Now to our daily progresse through the Signes. But stay, what's he that with our honors, arm'd, (The Bow and quiver, proper sole to us) Braves us upon high Erix Promontorie? I know him now, 'tis Paphian Venus son, To whom some fooles have vow'd a deity. I'le know the reason why the bastard brat Dares thus assume my trophies. 'Morrow Cupid. Cupid. As much to Phœbus. Phœb. Weake brat resolue me, By whose inticement thou hast bin so bold To take to thee the emblems of my power? Is't not sufficient, thou with brain-sicke toyes Canst fill the heads of mad men and of fooles, Who'ascribe to thee a god-head, meerly usurpt? But thou must weare my due Impresa insculpt, And ('bout thy shoulders) those known ornaments, Apollinis insignia? (Apollo's Ensignes) Cupid. And why thine? Apoll. Because I am styl'd the god of Archerie; And where I aime I hit, my prey or enemy, Kill neere or far. The monstrous serpent Python (Whose bulke being slaine, an hundred acres spred) Had from this bow his wounds, and I my honors: And shall a childe boast eminence with me? Cup. Phœbus, thy bow hath monsters strooke to ground, But myne hath power the gods themselves to wound, Of which thou art not least. Mother he's sped, He shoots. I have pierc'd him home with my shafts golden head. Ven. Thou art myne own sweet boy, thy darts ne're fail; And now Apollo languish and looke pale, More wan than did thy sister Moon once prove, When for Endymion she was sicke of love, Whil'st I laugh and reioyce. Now make all sure, And strike faire Daphne whil'st she sleepes secure, But with contempt and hate. Cup. My arrow flies, And as it hits, sicke of disdain she lies. Now mother let's away. Ven. Phœbus, I divine, Thou'lt say his shafts can wound as deep as thine. Exit. Apoll. What alteration's this I feele? a heate Beyond myne owne fire, kindled at myne eye. Daphne starts up. Daph. All sleep is still in darknesse, yet our soules See when our eies are shut. My brest's in uprore; And yet a dream tels me, the morning gray Sayes the Sun's up, I shame to looke on day. Apoll. What Beautie's this on earth, transpiercing more, Than can the beams from my celestial Orbe? Daph. The Sun is up; Awake: What, shame you not That he should finde you sleeping? Apol. Sweet Nymph stay. Daph. The shades best please me, I in them will play; The Sun's too hot and sultry. Apol. I am hee That measures out the yeare; and shun you me? Fair'st of thy sex, behold the Suns bright eye, That all things sees, by whom you all things spy. Will you in everlasting darknesse dwell? Light is heavens emblem, and becomes it well: Where I appeare, I comfort and make glad; Be comforted in me, why are you sad? Would you in blindnesse live? these raies of myne Give that reflect by which your Beauties shine, For what are artificial lights? when I Appeare in fulnesse they soon faint and die. They only put on counterfeits: my rayes False colours finde, and give the true the praise. If yours be such, then prove them by my light, The world will censure they are pure and right. Daph. His piercing beams I never shall endure, They sicke me of a fatall Calenture. Apol. What are you better to be lovely born, If not beheld? What's state, if not observ'd? Or wherefore before Cottages do we Prefer the stately Palace, and the sumptuous roofe? What vertue were in jewels without me? Else should they be with pibbles equall pris'd. Wherefore did Nature make you with bright eies, Which profit not in night without my beams? Why should the Rose be red? the Lilly white? The Violet purple? and the Holly greene? All rhese my creatures. But when I decline, And night usurps upon the Vniverse, Their tincture's not discern'd: but white and red Which in your peerlesse cheeks exceed all floures, What lustre beare they? When my beams are gone, The faire and foule in darknesse seem all one. Daph. That darknesse doth best please me: let's away, My beauty will be sun burnt if I stay, Hee'l blast me like an Ethiope. Exit running. Apol. Dost thou fly me? Love bids me follow, and I must pursue: No vault, no cave or cavern so obscure, Through which I will not pierce, to finde thee out. Th' Antipodes for ever want my rayes: To gaze on her, I'le this Meridian keepe, And till attain the saint that I adore, Here ever shine, where night shall be no more. Exit. Enter Venus and Cupid. Venus. Laugh Cupid, laugh, for I am halfe reveng'd, And shall e're long be fully, when this Blab Shall in his course, or too much lag or speed Post somtimes, and again run retrograde. Where by his too long presence th' earth is scortcht, Or by his absence th'other world shall freeze: And all that lies beneath the Moon complaine: And that the gods at mans request shall call Disorder into question. What can then Both heaven and earth conclude when this is done, But this thou didst to avenge me of the Sun. Cup. Will not Mars thanke me for't? Uen. And kisse thee too. O still by his example punish those That shal our sweet adulterate sports disclose. Exeunt. Enter Daphne flying, and Apollo pursuing her. Apollo. Why flies my Daphne, knowing 'tis in vaine: Love makes me swifter than thy feare can thee. Daph. O me, I am so tortur'd with the Sun, I hate my very shadow. Apol. I pursue not As Eagles, Doves do; or the Lions, Harts; Or Wolves, the Lambe. Love is my cause of hast: Run not so fast, lest thou shouldst trip perhaps, And do thy selfe some dammage: the ground's rough, Shouldst thou but slide, and I the Author on't, How much would it offend me? To preuent which, Stay but thy hast, and I will slack my speed. Daph. I am almost breathlesse. Apoll. See, I am no Satyre, Shepheard, or such as live by grazing herds, Delphos is myne, Pharos, and Tenedos: Thou know'st not who thou fly'st, I am Apollo, The only god that speakes by Oracle: Iove is my father, and the Muses nine Are all my daughters: I am Patron held Of Numbers, Raptures, and sweet Poesie. My shafts are ever certain where they aime, (Yet one more certain, which hath pierc't me deep) Physicke is myne, I first devis'd that Art, And could it help me, I were then assur'd: But Love is by no Simples to be cur'd. Daph. O now I am quite spent; help, goddesse Iuno, (Queene of chaste marriage) bright Diana, help One of thy true vow'd Virgins: change my shape, That I this hot adulterous Sun may scape. Sudden Musicke, and she is turned into a Lawrel tree. Thanks, ô ye Powers divine: the Spheres assent To my chaste prayer: your heavenly dooms are iust. Here grow I fixt against all powers of lust. Apoll. Strange prodigie! Lesse hope is in her stay, Than in her speed: her bodie's round incompast With a rough rinde, in which her warm heart beats. Her haire is all grown vpward into boughes, Here milke white fingers and her armes advanc'd To great and lesser branches: her faire feet But late so swift, fast rooted in the earth: And I, whom Love late blinded, now may see My Daphne turn'd into a Laurel tree. Her life still struggles in the churlish barke, And from her lips I feele her breath still flow. One blessed kisse at parting, but in vain, The very tree shrinks from me in disdain. And yet in lasting memory of thee And of my love, thou shalt be ever myne: In all ovatious triumphs and rich shewes The Laurel shall ingirt the Conquerors browes. All eminence shall thinke it grac'd in thee. Poets, the Muses darlings, shall from thee Receive their honor, and the best esteem'd Be crowned Laureat, and no excellence But have it's noble estimate from hence. Emperors shall prise thy leaves above pure gold: For thou shalt ever wait on victorie; And as my youthfull and still unshorne haires (Vnchanging) of this golden hew are seen, So shall thy boughes and branches still be greene, And arme against Ioves lightning. And all these Shall be for our sake by the gods approv'd, In memory that Daphne we once lov'd. Exit. Enter Aurora attended by the Houres. 1 Houre. How comes it, faire Aurora, we the Houres Are thus disturb'd? 2 Houre. One halts, whilest th' other runs; Somtimes made longer by a many minutes, Somtimes not full three quarters? Aurora. Am not I As much distemper'd, being forc'd to rise So oft before my time? which makes my husband Old Tython jealous (for he bed-rid lies) I have light on some new Love. 1 Houre. All's out of order. Enter the foure Seasons, Spring, Summer, Autumne, Winter. Spring. How comes this strange confusion rise of late? My spring to grow so forward by the Sun? Summer complaines that I usurpe on her. Sum. As much as I on thee, Autumne on me, And saith, that in my ripening I include His harvest, and so rob him of his due. Aut. Have I not cause? when thou not only claimst The honor of my crop: But frozen Winter, Hee keeps a coile too, swearing, I intrude Into his bounded limits. Wint. This I am sure I am curtaild of my right; my snow is melted, And hath not time to cloath the mountain tops: September is like May, Ianuary as Iune: And all my bright and pretious Isicles Melting to nothing: What's the reason trow we? 2 Houre. 'Tis the Suns slacknesse, or his too much speed, That breeds all this distraction. 1 Houre. The Sun, say you? Breake he, or not directly keepe his day, Seasons and Houres all out of order stray. Enter Day. Som. Behold her whom you speak of, Day, whence come ye? Day. I parted now with Night, who had bin here, But that both must not in one place appeare. Auror. And what saith she? Day. Like you, railes on the Sun, And saith he doth her wrong: nor blame her, when Being full twelve houres, he scarce affords her ten. Autumne. Day, you are the Suns mistresse, hath he not Reveald the cause to you? Day. No, his known brightnesse Hath unto me been only darke in that. Nor am I of his counsell. Winter. Fine world grown, When every drunken Sexton hath the skill To make his giddy clocke go truer far Than can the best Sun dyall. Enter Apollo. Apollo. What are you That murmure thus against our Deitie? Are you not all our creatures? though we give you Full sailes on earth, do not we steere the helme? Disposing you both where and how we please; And dare you thus rebell? Omnes. The god of Light Is our great Lord and Soveraigne. Apoll. This submission Hath somewhat calm'd us: had you still stood out, Disorder, we had to Confusion turn'd, And so you all been ruin'd. But henceforth Morning shall keep her houre, Houres measure day, In a true scope the Day proportion Weekes, Weekes, Moneths; Moneths, seasons; to sum up the yeare. And wee our course in that, perfecting time: That nothing in this concordance appeare Either preposterous or vnseasonable. For which our grace, where-ever you shall finde This new sprung Laurel, you Aurora I charge, With your moist teares bathe her green tender boughes: From whence I will exhale them with my beams. Houres, do you wait vpon her gentle growth. Day comfort her: Ver cheere her with thy spring. Thou Summer give her warmth: and Autumne, thou Dare not to spoile her of her plenteous leaves: Nor Winter thou with thy robustuous gusts, To blast her lasting verdure. These observ'd, Still flourish under us. And that this unitie May last amongst you many fortunate yeres, End in a Hymne tun'd to the chiming Spheres. The Song. Howsoe're the Minutes go, Run the houres or swift or slow: Seem the Months or short or long, Passe the seasons right or wrong: All we sing that Phœbus follow, Semel in anno ridet Apollo. Early fall the Spring or not, Prove the Summer cold or hot: Autumne be it faire or foule, Let the Winter smile or skowle: Still we sing, that Phœbus follow, Semel in anno ridet Apollo. FINIS. [A Pastorall Drama called Amphrisa, or the Forsaken Shepheardesse.] The Argument of Amphrisa the forsaken Shepheardesse. The innocence, truth, and simplicitie Of countrey Damsels: What felicitie They arrive to in their low estate; What freedoms they participate, What ioy, what solace, what content To their innocuous life is lent. The humble shed and cottage held More safe than gorgeous houses, swell'd With pompe and wealth. It likewise proves More simple truth in their chaste loves, Than greater Ladies, tympany' de With much more honour, state, and pride. Here's of the Willow wreath dispute, How, and why worne. What best doth sute Forsaken Virgins, reade and finde Their characters who prove vnkinde. Enter two Shepheardesses, Pelopœa and Alope. Pel. Good morrow. Alop. So to you, faire Shepheardesse. Pel. What newes in our Arcadia? Alop. I know none: For well you wot it is no newes with us, That men should prove inconstant. Pel. Thinke you so? Alop. Thought's free. Pel. I pray can you define me Thought? Alop. Let me bethinke my selfe, I thinke I can: For I have thought of many things e're now. Pel. But can you guesse what I thinke? Alop. I (perhaps) May jumpe with your conceit, come neere't at least. Of colours there are none so opposite As white and blacke: and of the Elements Than fire and water none more contrary: Nor is there ought so antipathy'de in men, As what they thinke and speake. Pelop. Now let me helpe you: Mens thoughts like Courtiers clokes are often shifted, And change as oft as they are truly sifted. Alop. This then hath been the cause of womens sorrow; Men thinke to day ill, to do worse to morrow: Witnesse Amphrisa's servant. Pel. Pitty 'tis, So faire a body, and so sweet a soule Should be so foulely dealt with. Her false Lover Vnkindely hath forsooke her. Alop. That's the reason Shee's growne into so deepe a melancholy. I wonder any woman dare trust man, Since, like as the Chamelions change themselves Into all perfect colours saving white; So they can to all humors frame their speech, Save only to prove honest. Pel. You say well. But as no wormes breed where they feele no warmth, No Vultures watch where they can finde no prey; No Pirat roves but where he hopes for spoile: So none of these false servants wait, but where They finde a yeelding Mistresse. Alop. Indeed light minds are catcht with little things, And Phancie smels to Fennell. Pel. But Amphrisa Is held to be the wisest shepheardesse That lives in our Arcadia. Alop. But I have heard, Late wit and cheated wisedome to be counted Next neighbours unto folly. Shepheards now, The holier that they seeme in outward shew, The hollower are their hearts. By subtill sophistry (As I have heard) the best Philosophy May be perverted. And mens flatteries Are iust like Circes riches, which can turne Vain-glorious fooles to Asses, credulous Fooles To Woodcocks, pretty wanton Fooles to Apes, And proud Fooles into Peacocks. Pel. But amongst these, Amphrisa had no place. Enter Amphrisa seeming discontented. Alop. See, here she comes That for her selfe can answer. Pelop. But 'twere sinne In us, not to be answer'd, thus to suffer her To pale the cheerefull bloud in her faire cheeks, Through wilfull passion. Which I'le not endure. Alop. Then rowse her from these dumps. Pel. You'r sad, Amphrisa: Sweet may we know the cause? Amphrisa. You have prevented A strange conceit which somewhat troubled me; But by your interruption almost lost. Pel. Nay recollect your selfe, pray let us hear't. Amph. I was thinking, why Parrasius, drawing Youth, Made Love to tickle one side with a feather, To move a smile; and with the other hand To sting it with a Scorpion. Pel. You'r stung then. But I was thinking on Praxiteles, Who drew his mistresse thus: Looke on her one way, She laught upon him: Strait before, she wept: But change the side, and cast your eye adverse, And then she appear'd sleeping. And so you, Fit but your phansies unto such a face, You'l ne're complain of servant. Amph. Then it seems, My storie 's told aforehand. Alop. Yes, and rumor'd Through all Arcadia. Amph. And none pitty me? Pel. There's none so marble brested, but doth melt To heare of your disaster. Amph. Is there one, To whom the cause of my disease is knowne, That can prescribe me cure for't? Pelop. Without feeling Your pulse, I know the nature of your griefe: You have an heate, on which a coldnesse waits, A paine that is endur'd with pleasantnesse, And makes those sweets you eat have bitter taste: It puts eies in your thoughts, eares in your heart: 'Twas by desire first bred, by delight nurst, And hath of late been wean'd by jelousie. Amp. But how can these disgusts be remedy'd, Which Reason never yet could comprehend? Pel. By patience. Amp. That's a physicke all prescribe, But few or none doth follow. Pray what is't? Pel. It is the best receit that can be tooke Both against love and fortune (Crost in both.) Alop. To wish the best, to thinke vpon the worst, And all contingents brooke with patience. Is a most soveraigne medicine. Pelop. And moreover; What cannot be redrest with peevishnesse, Ought to bee borne with patience. Alop. Patience? She is so like to Fortitude her selfe, That by her sweet aspect she appeares to be Her sister or her daughter. Pel. The onely remedy for injuries, is By patience to forget them. And more noble It is to yeeld your selfe in triumph to't Then to be drawne by force. Amp. You have prevaild, For I am now your Patient; and intreat you, Like skild Phisitians, study for my health. Alop From their Doctors The sick expect more art then eloquence: And therefore what defect you find in words, Expect in our Prescriptions. Enter their Queene and two Nymphs. Queen I never was with pastime better pleas'd; So cleare a morning, and such temperate ayre; The Sun so bright, yet sparing of his heat, Made all the toyle we tooke (to chace the Stag) To seeme no labour, but an exercise. The wily beast to shun our swift pursute, Forsooke the Plaines, to take the mountaine tops. Yet maugre the opposure of the Rocks And clifts depending to molest our speed Our well-tride Nymphs, like wild Kids clim'd those hils, And thrild their arrowie Iavelins after him: Nor left the chace, till all those golden heads Were new stain'd in his blood. 1. Nymph. It prov'd, great Queene Your active Nymphs were better breath'd than he, For whom we could not overtake, we tyr'd: That done, we toucht our Beagles, and so made Both hills and vallies eccho to his death. 2. Nymph. He stood so long, and made us stray so far, Amongst the Swaines and lovely Shepheardesses, That use to graze their Flocks upon these downes; The Sun must needs passe the Meridian, E're we can reach the Lodge. Qu. The Arcadian Girles Are of no common beauty; as their habits Much grace the fields; so many of those features Mine eye by chance hath glanc't on in the Chace, In mine opinion would become the Court. They say, these virgins are acute in wit, And fluent in conceit, to speake or sing; As having oft drunke from the Muses spring. 1. Nym. See, Royall Queene, where three (not of the meanest Or least to be respected) are retyr'd. Qu. Be not too lowd, These bowes will shelter us; Let's listen how they fashion their discourse, And how far short the Folds and Cottages Come of the Court or City. Amp. Nay pray prescribe. 'Tis said of all Physitians What good comes by their Physick, the Sun sees: But in their art, if they have bad successe, That the earth covers. Howsoe're I suffer, You blamelesse are. Alop. All those that are unskilfull Will flatter griefe 'till it grow desperate. But though you know the use of Physick sweet, To taste it is unsavory. Amp. Howsoever I am prepar'd. Pel. Imagin first, You never had a servant. Alop. Not so: for who can know the sweet of ease, That never was in paine? Pel. Or say she had, Thinke that he ne're playd false. Alop. A meere relapse, Before the first be cur'd, to thinke him faithfull, Were but to enter her disease anew, To make her griefe more violent. Amp. But one speake: The medicine that's propos'd of contraries, Can ne're breed peace of mind. For I perceive, those that are sound themselves, Have still more will to help, than skill to cure. (Qu. All, solid sence.) For I perceive, those that are sound themselves, Have still more will to help, than skill to cure. Pel. Well, Mistresse Doctor I'le give way to you. Alop. Thinke then you had a servant, and he false; For whose sake never more trust perjur'd man. And though some say Iove winks at Lovers Oathes, 'Tis (after) with broad eyes to punish them. Words should not credit men, but men their words: For he that breaks his promise lies to heaven; And whom Heaven hates, who but would feare to love? Most cursed 'tis to flatter and forsweare; And dearth of oathes is blessed barrennesse. You'r sicke at heart: the only help for that Is, Let your heart abhorre his trecherie, And him, for it. You'r pain'd too in the head, She presents a wreath of willow For that here's balm made of a willow wreath. Let this charm'd circle but impale your brows, 'Tis present help for both. Amp. Make this apparant. Alop. Thus: All th' Arcadian Swains &amp; Nymphs that see Your browes ingirt with this forsaken wreath Will take note of his falshood, and your faith; Your innocence, and his inconstancie: And those that weare teares in their eies for you, Of love and pitty, to be thus abus'd, Will steep their tongues in wormwood and in gall, To brand him for his open perjury; Their pitty, with your patience join'd, (With this to boot) will prove an absolute cure. Amph. Some ease I finde already, crowne me then. She is crowned with Willow. Alop. May, wheresoe're your head you softly pillow, Be ne're more troubled, whil'st thus wreath'd in willow. Amph. Nor shall it, Alope, for from this houre, Hearts griefe nor heads paine shall of me have power. I now have chac'd hence sorrow. Queen. This conceit Hath tooke me highly; and great pitty 'tis, That such choice wits should finde no other eares Than those that Swains, and flocks, and fowls have. Wit So spent, is only treasur'd in the aire. The earth hath least part on't. Virgins, Good day. Nay, do not fall too low. Pel. You are our Queen Alop. And Lady of our fortunes. Qu. By that title I do command you then to spare your knees. Nay rise. Amp. 'Tis only by your Grace and goodnesse We breathe and live. Qu. It is enough to me, That you present us such acknowledgement. And as for you, faire Virgin, I could wish Your Willow were a Lawrel. Nay, so 'tis: Because all such may be styl'd Conquerors, That can subdue their passions. Alop. Our feare is, That if our rude discourse have toucht your eare, The coursenesse might offend you. Qu. Pleas'd us highly: Which that you may perceive in mee's vnfeignd, I charge you, as I am your Soveraignesse, All coynesse and evasion set apart, To be most free in language. Pel. Imposition That comes from you is vnto us a Law, Which ought to be kept sacred. Qu. I'le as freely Command then, as you willing are t'obey, For were I not a Queen, I'de wish to be As one of you, a witty Shepheardesse. Pray sing me somthing of your countrey life, To make me more in love with't. Amp. Tis our feare; A life that is so meane, so ill exprest As needs it must bee, (if impos'd on us) May make you rather loath it. Qu. I had thought Courts onely had beene fill'd with complement, Of which I see, the cottage is not cleare. Amp. Give not our simple truth, and feare to offend, A character we know not (gratious Queene) But howsoever, if you make us faulty, You have the power to pardon. Qu. And presume That's granted, e're the offence be. Amp. Then thus, Madam. She sings. The Song. We that have knowne no greater state Than this we live in, praise our fate: For Courtly silkes in cares are spent, When Countries russet breeds content. The power of Scepters we admire; But sheep-hookes for our use desire. Simple and low is our condition; For here with us is no ambition. We with the Sunne our flockes unfold, Whose rising makes their fleeces gold. These last two lines twice. “Our musick from the birds we borrow; “They bidding us, we them, good morrow. Qu. Nay, faire ones, what you have begun in song, Continue in discourse: Wee would heare more Of your pleas'd life. Amp. Your highnesse may command. Our habits are but course and plaine, Yet they defend from wind and raine. As warme too, in an equall eye As those be, stain'd in Scarlet dye. Those that have plenty weare (we see) But one at once; and so doe we. Amp. The Shepheard with his home-spun Lasse As many merry houres doth passe, As Courtiers with their costly Girles, Though richly deckt in gold and pearles: And though but plaine, to purpose woo, Nay oft-times with lesse danger too. Pel. Those that delight in dainties store, One stomack feed at once, no more. And when with homely fare we feast, With us it doth as well digest: And many times wee better speed; For our wild fruits no surfets breed, Amp. If we sometimes the Willow weare, By subtill Swaines that dare forsweare. We wonder whence it comes, and feare, Th' have beene at Court, and learn'd it there. If any Lady then shall please, Whose cheeke lookes pale through my disease, By any faithlesse servant, or false friend, (Being cur'd my selfe) this I can give or lend. She offers the willow. Qu. Beleeve't, a sweet conclusion: for oft-times Such things fall out. But we have further heard (Besides what now our eares are witnesse to) That as your words keepe time, your voices tune; So hath the curious motion of your feet Beene taught to know true measure. You can dance? Amp. Yes royall Princesse, as we sing and speake, After such rurall fashion. Qu. If no worse, It may become a Theatre of eyes, Yet wrest no blushes from you. Will you then, Since that we parallell in number thus, Helpe us to fill a measure? Pelop. So wee thought There might no jarring discords grow from us, To spoile your better musick. Qu. No such feare. Come then, such musicke as the place will yeeld, Wee'l instantly make vse of. Musicke sounds, and they dance the measure. Qu. Compleat in all: You have made us now Eie-witnes Of what, Relation sparingly hath spoke. To encourage which, and that so great a merit Passe not without some meed, receive these favors, And weare them for our sake. Iewels given. Time bids us part. Greater than these we have for you in store, And mean hereafter to employ you more. FINIS. An Emblematicall Dialogue, interpreted from the Excellent and most learned D. Iac. Catzius; which sheweth how Virgins in their chaste loves ought to beare themselves. 1. The Argument. Two modest Virgins, of unequall time, Th'one past, the other growing to her prime, (Anna and Phillis) interchange some chat Of Love, of Mariage, and I know not what. 2. The Argument. Anne hearing Phillis her rude Love relate, (Whose tender brest was free from all deceit) Feares lest her youth to lust she might ingage, And bids her to be counsel'd by her age. A Virgins office, and how Maids be caught, (Saith she) three times nine Winters have me taught: Take me thy Guide, and no way thou canst erre, Who before Venus sweets, chaste love prefer. Which in alternate language whil'st they plead, In view and presence of the Marriage bed, Phillis, whom youth and fresh love doth possesse, Her amorous thoughts begins thus to expresse. We, when in health, for sicke folks counsel finde, But sicke our selves, we quickly change our minde. Without Marriage there is no courage.Phi. Whilst neere my Fathers house I observ'd but late Two Turtles bill, and either court it's mate, I cald to minde the palme which I might spy Drooping, because the male plant was not nye, Whom with erected lookes when she beheld, She buds, she bloomes, with fruit her branches sweld, At which I said (O Venus) were I dead, But that I thinke it a sweet thing to wed! Which as I spake, (and more would have exprest) I felt soft love to steale into my brest. Trees have their Ardor, and the birds their flame, The Mountaine bores, and wild beasts have the same Nor doth the scaly fish want their desire, Why then should onely Virgins shun this fire? Concerning which the Poet Lucretius is thus read. Each generation that on earth abides, Whether of beasts, or men, (whom reason guides, Horses or Cattle, what's beneath the Sunne, Into this firy ardor madly runne.) Most things unprov'd cannot content us, Which being tryde they oft repent us. An. Into the Brides yoake wilt thou madly fly, Thinking there Roses, and sweet Apples lie? If such a thing as pleasure be? search round; In mans rude armes it never can be found. What is this snare to which young Virgins haste, But like the Osier weel in rivers plac't? The fish yet free, to enter wind about, Whilst they within are labouring to get out. Boyes in their first heate, want the wit to tarry, And Girles (not ripe) are mad untill they marry; When scarce the one hath warm'd the others side, But they wish beds and houses to divide. Diog Laert tells us that it was a saying of Socrates, that young batchelers desirous of marriage were like to fishes who play about the weele, and gladly would get in, when on the contrary they that are within strive how they should get out. The family of the unmarried is lame. Phi. Though you say, Wedlock doth such troubles breed, Love bids, and Hymen prompts me to proceed. The tedious silence of a forlorne bed To me is hatefull, therefore must I wed: Looke how the Ducks mourne when they misse the male, No one but droopes her wings, and flags her tayle, But he once come, the pond with clamour rings, And you then see another face of things. The good man absent: then the fire doth freeze, The house is sad, the wife her mirth doth leese. (They all are troubled,) when the maide doth aske To goe to rest, shee's put to some new taske. A beard's the houses prop, (besides is none) There can be no delight to sleepe alone. Impose the burthen of virginity on none (saith Ignatius the ancient Theologist) being a yoake which even the V rgin Vestals (of old) in Rome were not able to beare, to whom onely five yeares were injoyned to abstaine from marriage, and to keepe the holy fire from going out. Binde in thy flames. An Though thou hast such a will to change thy state, Yet gently heare me what I shall relate, The flame (too raging) that by heate is blowne, To fit the marriage bed was never knowne. Observe the Cooper when he joynes his tunne, That the con racted planks may evenly runne, (The fury of the violent heat to tame) In a round Iron cradle keepes his flame, By his example thine hot fires suppresse, Lest this or that way fondly it digresse. With amorous tales let not thine eares be tainted, Before thy mother be therewith acquainted; Shee'l tell thy Father; so take off thy care, They well provide to keepe thee from the snare. Cicero tells us that it is fit, men should be brought within the compasse of reason and learning. And Cipri, that the tutors or guardians, namely, the Father, Grand-father, or Brother, were woont of old to contract young Virgins, which ancient custome is upon great consideration observed in these dayes, And amongst other causes, especially in regard of the weaknesse, and bashfulnesse of the sex: and wee read in Euripides that when Orestes sollicited Hermione for marriage, Her answere was, My espousals remaine in my Fathers power, and not mine. By the finger, not the tongue. Phi. Shall I then clamour for an husband? no, My virgin shame forbids me to doe so, Three lusters, and three yeares ore past, I pray, Is't not enough? what more can virgins say? Looke how that watch doth the swift houres divide, And with its hand doth to the figures guide, It nothing speakes, yet points (early and late To what it meanes, such is our virgins state, Although the mind be silent, and sit mute, Her mature age (though tongueles) moves her suit. It shewes her to be enterd in her prime, And tells the parents that shee loseth time. Her round brests speak, fresh cheeks &amp; brows so fayer Thus the whole girle's dissolv'd to silent prayer. That Father is much to bee blamed, who when his Daughter is in her full maturity provideth her not an Husband. Well therefore said Ignatius, A ripe Virgin to prevent the wrinckles of age, may speake to her Father in private, to dispose of her in marriage. And wee read Claudian thus: The virgins ripe age breeds the fathers cares, Who, for her sake neglects his Lords affaires. The Colony is to bee removed elsewhere. Phi. When the earth helpes the Vine her sprigs to beare, Tis fit they should transplanted be elsewhere. The dresser calls and sayes these same will bud, And prosper bravely if the soyle be good. I have two swelling brests that twins can feed, A lap besides to dandle those I breed: And my virginity (say what you can) Proclaimes me now that I am ripe for man. I looke on Wives, and wish that I were such, But grieve my Father will not see so much: Yet long he shall not barre me from that blisse Which law allowes, or I am taught amisse. That daughter who hath past the age of five and twenty, if she marry without her fathers consent, by the law of some Nations cannot be deprived of her dowry, because the father ought to consider in time convenient to provide his daughter of an husband, and himselfe of a Son-in-law: but when our Phillis professeth her selfe not to bee much above fifteene, it is ridiculous in the maide longing for marriage, to wrest the law, and apply it unto her owne purpose. After the wound, in vaine is warning. An. What's shame to speake, is it not sinne to act, To blush at words, and not to blame the fact. No girle that's wise to lovers will incline, The choyse should be thy parents, and not thine. Courtship inchaunts, when lovers vow they faigne, And enterd once, there's no way back againe. Vaine is it for the wounded Whale to fly, Who carelesse earst before the stroke did lye. Loves arrowes to remove, or ease their smart, As vaine it is, if once they touch the heart. Then of thy parents counsell first be sure Before thy choise: once wounded there's no cure. If regard be to be had of dignity, comlines or honesty; then in the contracting of marriages, it is more decent and seemely, if the parents troth plight their daughters to their husbands, and tye them together with their owne tongues, than if they themselves immodestly in their owne language subject themselves to one anothers power. Cypr. They that in gathering Venus flowers are free, Say daily, these to morrow such will bee. Meane time soft fires into our bosomes creepe, And the worst trees still root themselves most deepe. Ovid. The more haste, the worse speed. An. In hast's no helpe: if follow love, 'twill fly, Lovers hate such as come to every cry. Of any sudden conquest they are sick, Nor what they covet, would have come too quick. When the Lord sends to bid the Cooke make haste, He straight gives charge the spit turne not too fast, Lesse speed is made, the meat's the sooner ready. Hee hinders and not hasts that is too speedy. Shee that in Cupids Kitchin would command Must have dull motion, and a tardy hand: Tis speed that spoyles all, spurres are in delay, No lover stoopes unto a yeelding prey. All delay is odious, yet it brings on wisdome. Sen. You that would marry, though you both make speed, Delay't awhile, small stay great gaine may breed. Delayes oftentimes bring to passe that hee who should have dyed, hath killed him who might have lived. Clem. Alexand. For what wee can, wee care not An. Wee see in birds for whom the pitfall's set, Such as would faine be tooke, escape the net. Others that would fly thence, the strings combine, Their captive legges intangling in their twine. She that first craves deserves a scornefull smile, As both in maid or woman hold most vile. Shee's onely certaine to be caught that flies, Shee teacheth to bee su'd to that denies. Coy Dames the brests of lovers most besot, The sweetest kisses are by struggling got. That game best pleaseth which is sur'st in chace, Not that being swolne, and lies dead in the place. What I most wish may for a time be spar'd, Nor pleaseth me the conquest that's prepar'd. Petron. To this purpose is that of Seneca the Philosopher, it shameth me to enter conflict with a man prepared to bee overcome. The sword-player holdeth it a great indignity to bee matched with his inferiour, as knowing it can bee no glory to him to subdue that man, who is vanquisht without danger. Presse occasion. Phi. What means this Ann? thinkst thou me mad, that I What my heart thinks should with my tongue deny? Past loves, in vaine she studieth to recall, Who to her friend hath shewed no grace at all, Whilst golden Venus with a cheerefull face Smiles on our acts, let's lose nor time nor place. The wary Ospray whilst the fishes play Above the wave, stoopes downe to cease her prey. That Bird for our example is we knowe, Who slips no time, parts conquerour from his foe. Catch at occasions, looke e're he passe by thee, Let him escape, and Venus too will flie thee. If in the very moment of occasion the opportunity whereof by thy delay or negligence thou hast o'reslipt, in vaine it is to complaine upon it being past. Liv. The honour of virginity perisheth in the lasting Phi While th'envious Rose, wrapt in new leaves we find, She hides her beauty in a thorny rinde. Forbeare your hands (boyes) for their pricks are found, Nor can you crop the bud without a wound. But stay the time, the flower it selfe will spred, But if not gathered then, the leaves will shed. Sweet are young maides to lovers in their prime, And pleasant love rejoyceth in that time. She that is long a maid, scarce such appeares, Virginity still wasteth with her yeares. Let Cupid have our vigor, and youths fire, Maides young deny, what old, they most desire. Standing streames gather mud, but running rivers are fresh and sweet. Such as resist love, must either have no braine, or no eyes. Protogenes. Ambition and love are impatient of delay: lingring growes loathsome where necessity craves haste. Quintilian. No prize if not provok't. An A deeper Sea I now perforce must saile, And lay my sheats ope to a freer gale. Such as the subtle traines of love would fly, Let them upon this embleme cast their eye. Thou seest that net which hangeth in the glade, A traine for Woodcocks by the Fowler made; He doth not touch the strings, but remote stands, Whilst her owne weight compels her into bands. If took or not, the traveller scarce knowes, Because the net inforc't about her flowes. Virgins beware by this, if tooke at all, Catch not thy selfe, but by thy suiter fall. Draw not upon thy selfe that subtle frame, So shalt thou make the Fowler his owne game. Many virgins at their contractings rather consent then speake, especially if their parents bee then in presence, lest they should appeare to desire a husband, which in maids is not seemely, and Baldus observes that it is ingrafted in the nature of women to bee silent, especially at the time when there is a treaty of their marriage; moreover it is a great signe of virginall modesty, to blush when marriage is but named: according with that of the Poet. Quale coloratum Tithoni conjuge Cœlum Subrubet, aut sponso visa puella novo. Like to the coloured Heaven, by'the morning dyde, Or blushing maide by her new husband spyde. It lights, but leads not. An. If to more proper rules a minde thou hast, Take these: and more, Ile not allow thee chast. On the vast Seas the Beacon doth display Its light: directing ships their safest way. The flame doth show the harbour to be neare, Yet doth not helpe the Mariner to steare: 'Tis they must guide the Sayles, and ply the Oare, Save light from it, they can expect no more. If thy face, speake thee not of Cynthias traine, And thou the Vestals modest dresse disdaine: Thou onely on the shore, to light them, stand, But let the Sayler labour how to land. It much behoveth a virgin to be very circumspect in cases of matrimony, that for the honour of her sex, she neither seeme to offer her selfe, or to doe any thing against modesty: lest it happen unto her, as (wee read) it did to Icasin a noble and learned virgin, who when she became so gracious in the eyes of Theophilus Emperour of Constantinople, that he seemed to offer her a golden apple as a pledge of nuptiall faith and contract: She was taxed for her too ready answer and acception thereof, and for griefe of mind confinde her selfe into a Monastery. Cypri. No play without some pray. Phi. If it be harmefull then for maides to woo, What we are bar'd may not our Fathers doe? Trust me, to tardy louers sport it lends, And love hath often growne from bare commends. The Latian King would needs Æneas draw, To take his daughter, whom (before he saw) The Trojan lov'd: but fathers that are wise With better art these contracts may disguise. More private slights there are: by agents, best Where many are, still one may helpe the rest. By Birds, the Fowler to his net, birds drew, Yet in the act, seem'd as he nothing knew. Parents of old made proffer of their Daughters to Husbands before they sought after them, neither did they imagine in that to have done any thing uncomly or undecent. Wee read in the first of Kings, chapter eighteenth, Saul offred his Daughter unto David. Homer reports that Alcinous did the like to Vlysses. Virgil. that Latinus did the same to Æneas: Terence, that Chremes did it to Pamphilus. Herodotus, that it was done by Megacles to Pisistratus, and Zonoras and others, that Darius did as much to Alexander, &amp;c. Try ere you trust. An. Wary's thine art, but not from danger sure, For dost thou thinke that craft can be secure? Wretch th'art deceiv'd. We live in corrupt times, Nor can craft long conceale her subtile crimes. Adde that the profferd bride few humors fits, As fearing there be baites laid in their bits. Whilst aged Priam to Achilles sues To take his child, he doth the match refuse. Let Fathers pause untill their minds they know, and whether they be well dispos'd or no. The Foxe his eare unto the Ice doth lay E're venter on; if heare them crack, hee'l stay. Whilst Darius to Alexander, Priamus to Achilles: Alcinous to Ulysses, without due circumspection made offer of their daughters, they were altogether frustrate in their hopes and expectations, therefore the wiser are of opinion: that nothing ought to be profferd, which hath not before beene proved. Too much light dimmes the sight. An. Concerning Habit, which in Love's not least, Receive these few rules fit to be imprest. Cost (within compasse) doth the young man taste, Neatnesse best pleaseth love, where there's no waste. When once thy virgins habit is laid by, And th'art a wife, thy gifts will then grow high. If thou (before) in princely jemmes shalt shine, He'l say; my gifts are sleight, shee needs not mine. Rich vesture I have seene Lovers to'affright, Youth starts at Iewels when they shine too bright, Much oyle chokes lampes. The Lysard when he lies Too open to the hot Sunne, faints and dies. A cleanlinesse is to bee used by women, neither despised, nor too exquisit, onely let it avoid clownish and sordid negligence. Cicero. She that hath too much care over her attire, sheweth she hath little regard of her vertue. Cato Cens. Husbandmen praise best those eares of corne which bow down, and make the stalk crooked, more then such as grow straight and upright, as being assured to find more grain in the one than in the other. Humblenes in heart &amp; habit, is both pleasing to God, and acceptable with man. Cheekes oft painted, are soone tainted. An. A grave man supping with my Father said, (What in my brest, I ever since have laid) Then Peach trees (when they flower) nothing more faire, And none more sordid when their bowes are bare. That wife growes often loathsome by neglect, Who (yet a Maid) her selfe too nicely deckt. How comes this too much liberty of dresse? When a whole day is spent in't (and no lesse) Too curious trimming maides hath oft mis-led, Nor did it ever suite the marriage bed. It oft falls out, such as most leasure find, To paint their cheekes, their husbands do not mind: But from all ages, this a maxime was, None loves her distaffe, who admires her glasse. Let not thy habit be too rich nor too base, make it neither for admiration, nor contempt; their ornament is cald womanly neatnesse, by which is meant modest handsomnesse, free from curiosity or cost: and Vives in the same place proceeds thus: in thy garments it is injoyned thee that they be not over nise or precious, but without spot or staine. For I cannot imagine how much the purity of the mind rejoyceth at the matronlike neatnesse of the body. Fire from Frost. An. But say the reine be given up to thine hands, And the sad suiter at thy mercy stands; Though burne within, perswade him thou dost freeze. For still to smile, will much advantage leese. The Sunne shines clearest breaking from a cloud, Sweet is the North-wind when it breaths not lowd. Heat flies, love bates, and suiters weary grow, When the fond Girle doth too much favour show. Water doth make the lime-chalk scortch with heat, And the Smiths flame by water grows more great. Learne to say nay, love heightens by deniall, And hath through wounds and difficult things best triall. Better the Bee on flowers doth feed, Having first tasted on a weed. The starres of greater lustre show, After the North-wind leaves to blow. When Lucifer hath chac't hence night, The blushing morning showes more bright. Boeth. It may be called a disease rather than mirth, ever to smile on them who alwaies laugh at thee, or to frame thy countenance unto every mans humour. Seneca. The light to keepe, snuffe not too deepe. Ph. Too strict thy rules are, golden Venus cries, To no such lawes she tender virgins ties. If like the Sabines we contract the brow, Give them bad words, use them we care not how; We shall our loves make weary of their lives, As farre more fit to be made Souldiers wives. Cupid inur'd to lie soft and secure In Venus shades, no hardnesse can endure. Say, brittle be his shafts, that their points turne, Flashie his fire, and cannot ever burne. To cleare the taper, if you snuffe too deepe, Out goes the lighr, i'th darke you may goe sleepe. When one churneth milke he bringeth forth butter: and hee that wringeth his nose causeth bloud to come out: so he that forceth wrath bringeth forth strife. Pro. 30. Thy secure pastime should be mixt with feare, Or else thy favours he'l not hold so deare. Passions too high, will speaking lie. An. If chide; 'tis nothing, there's no danger, know: (I speake strange things) love doth by brauling grow: He first retyres and must goe back some step, Who hath a mind to make the stronger leap. The further Cupid drawes his elbow back, He deeper strikes, and makes the greater wrack. Warre begets peace, jarre to atonement tends, Thus Mars and Venus quarreld, and were friends. Adde this: his wrath up to the height to wind, To search what gall thou in his breast canst find. Anger will lay his heart wide ope, and bare, In rage, (for men to hide their thoughts) 'tis rare. Those Doves, who late, each other sought to wound, Now joyne their bills with murmure and sweet sound. Ovid. Lovers stray, where there's no way. An. Court, kisse, drinke deepe, strow roses when you meet, And let your banquets be of junkets sweet. In little, little space, unhappy thou, With a sad soule beneath his feet shalt bow. The beane-stalke by a slender wand doth clime, Shooting his head up to the ayre in time. The top it aimes at, having reacht unto't, He bowes his wanton head downe to the root. Lovers rash heat unto the utmost aimes, And though thou grant it much, yet more it claimes. Give all; 'tis not enough, unlesse thou grant (Of what hee hath) He to his friend may vaunt. This also is to bee admonished them, that virgins smile not on all such as laugh upon them: which indeed is not seene in any but such as are rather immodest or madde, shee ought not also to suffer her selfe to bee tugged or over wantonly toucht, but rather to shunne the place, or forbeare the company. If shee cannot otherwise avoide it. Vives. They care nor feare, For what they sweare. An. Let neither promise, nor complaint perswade, Nor his laments thy tender brest invade. Seest thou that Reed, which when the North winde blowes, Bowes downe it's head, and like a suppliant showes; But the gust past, it growes straight as a line, And of the former storme remaines no signe. The Bee makes honey till his sting be gone, But that once lost, he soone becomes a Drone. The sutor sues, and seekes, and gives good words, Whilst she stands off, and no kind grace affoords: But with contempt and scoffing he'l retire, When he hath once obtain'd his wisht desire. Rash oathes by raging lovers uttered, bind Like words inscrib'd on water, or in wind. Hot love groweth soone cold; and faith plighted with feigned vowes as it is tyed without conscience, so for the most part it is broken without care. Touch it with salt, it turnes to nothing. An. That thy prime age, thou without staine mayst weare, See thou to no obscene talke lend thine eare, When wanton youth 'gainst modesty makes warre To make it captive, such their weapons are. Therefore, if any with a blushlesse face, And talke uncomely, presse into the place; Grace nothing, but a brow censorious take And answer him, as if some Matron spake. Observe the snaile, on which if salt you cast, To water first it turnes, to naught at last. Let but thy words into lowd thunder breake, And instantly, hee'l have no word to speake. Posthumia the vestall, because shee was free in laughter, and more liberall in discourse with men, then became her order, was cald in question about incest: but being acquitted of that crime by Spurius Minutius, then High Priest or Flamin, he admonished her that thenceforward shee should conforme her language to her life. Plutarch. As the North-wind driveth away the raine, so doth an angry countenance, the slandering tongue. Prov. 25. 23. There's much danger, to trust a stranger. Phi. To marry, in my thoughts much better were, It strengthens bashfull shame, preventing feare. An. But light and hasty will, doth fraud provoke, Who eates with too much speed may hap to choake. When Palamedes birds the rusticks take, They snares of paper, daub'd with birdlime, make. The meate the fowle loves, in the midst is plac't, Which whilst the hungry bird desires to taste, The slimy paper blinding both her eyes, She now a pray before the fowler lies. Most justly they the Cities scorne are made, Who will be caught, yet see the traine that's laid. The way to marriage is doubtfull and double, the one leadeth to misery, the other to happinesse: therefore before thou givest thy selfe into that way, it behoveth thee to be of that solicitous deliberation which is reported of Hercules travelling where two wayes met: for if once in marriage, it hath hapned unto thee ill, there is no art by which thou canst correct it; for thou art falne into the number of those, of whom the proverb speakes, Hee deserveth no pitty, that chuseth to doe twice amisse. It is more honest after thou hast once determined, to love, rather than begin to determin when thou hast loved Sometimes faire words, wound worse than swords. An. If any one unworthy seeke thy bed, From thy chaste house let him be banished: Admit him not, so much as to be jeer'd, Some scoft at first, have after prov'd indeer'd. If he have any wit at all, he'l show it, And prove in sundry straines to let thee know it, Imbracing first, strive a forc't kisse to win, Such kisses have to virgins fatall beene. So by degrees into thy brest love steales And wanders round, but his soft steps conceales; Whilst Fowlers play upon their pipes, and sing, Th'unwary fowle into their nets they bring. Wonder not that thou art deceived by him that speakes thee faire and flatters thee, but rather wonder how thou hast escaped from not being deceived by him. Demosthenes. Sic avidis fallax indulget piscibus Hamus, Callida sic stultas decipit esca feras. So the deceitfull hooke the fish betrayes, So beasts, by crafty baits, a thousand wayes. Spare for no cost, where nothing's lost Phi. To imbrace, or kisse, why should a maid deny? Since neither shame, nor fame we lose thereby. Who can beleeve a soft kisse can ecclipse Our honor, comming from a young mans lips. The Bee the violet kist, and the Sunnes flower, And laden with sweet juice, hies to her bower, Yet neither one nor other is since dride, But both still flourish in their wonted pride. What with compulsive strength the young man tooke, The maide wipes off, and keepes her former looke. If it be lawfull light from light to take, Why should we maides to kisse, such scruple make? Why swelst thou Satyrist, kisses are vaine, And thine owne spit will wash them off againe. Ex Gr. Ep. True honour is so pure, It will no touch indure. An. Kisses, soft gripes, and blandishing perswades, From amorous sutors; harme not those young maides. No Poet (howsoever his vaine please) Shall sway me; but there's poison in all these. Touch not the purple grape: for then 'tis ripe, And that pure colour cannot brooke the gripe. 'Tis fresh, now the Vines grace, and hath affinity Vnto the Genius of untoucht virginity; Shun them, they have sweet poison mixt among: The lip but toucht, doth weare the impresse long: For wash thy face a thousand times, the sinne Thou canst not wipe thence, for that lies within. Nothing is more tender than the fame and reputation of women, or more subject to injury: in so much that it may be properly said to hang by the small thread of a Spider. Vives. No Father can have too great a care of preserving his daughters chastity. Plaut. in Epidic. Once sham'd, ever blam'd. An Not sinne alone, but what may such appeare, If thou beest wise (maide) studdy to forbeare, Tis not enough, thine acts are free from blame, Since thou (meanetime) maist suffer in thy fame. If the Nuts-shels, thou shalt asunder draw, Doe what thou canst, there wil remaine the flaw. Thy fame once toucht, bee thy mind ne're so pure, Yet scandall shall thy chastity indure. Though thou the ruine studiest to repaire, Thou canst not make it good with all thy care. How-ever joyne the shells, the breach is seene, Though hide thy wounds, yet will they still be greene, Her modesty once blam'd, She is for ever sham'd. Remember still thy fame to cherish, That lost, thy selfe doth likewise perish. Ovid. It behoveth the chast one, not onely to abstaine from crime, but also to avoyd the sordid aspersion of blame. Dion. His slave shee lives, to whom she gives. An. Bee't then the virgins care and labour still, That of her carriage, no tongue can speake ill. Heare me with patience and Ile teach thee then, What dangerous rocks t' avoide, both where &amp; when. Part to thy Love with nothing that thou haste, Farre be free hands to virgins that are chaste. If give but trifles, hee'l for greater looke: Part hath beene offerd, when the whole was tooke. Besides, thy gifts to every one hee'l show, Speaking them thine, to all whom he doth know. Fat spilt in frying, makes the flame so great, That it both wasts it selfe, and spoiles the meat. Let the woman give nothing to the man: for whosoever she bee that presents a gift, prostrateth her selfe. Vives. And there may bee reason rendred, that whosoever gives may bee thought to insinuate himselfe into that mans favour to whom hee giveth; alluding to that of Martial. Thou sent'st me presents, oh but why? Because with thee I should comply. All things by Gold, are bought and sold. An. Give not said I? Now, doe not take, I say, Gripple we are, gifts will our sexe betray: They weaken us: she that hath long out-held (A gift receiv'd) to yeeld hath beene compeld. The baser coyne they to the Seas commend, But the choise Gold, to the white bosome send. Where steele can force no entrance, Gold is free, Let Danaes brazen Tower witnesse for mee. Then Steele give place, to Gold thy strength resigne, (Woe me) that choller, hath a power divine. By Iron some few; Their number, who by Gold Have beene made prostrate: never can be told. There is nothing so sacred which is not to bee violated and prophaned, nothing so defenced, which is not to be scaled, and entred by money. Cicero. Gods, Chastity, and Faith have faild, Gold onely, over them prevaild. Receive no gifts, (a hooke lies in the meate) None but have birdlime, and their poison's great. M. Verinus. Trust none in the giving vaine; Lovers give not but to gaine. An. Bee't then thy care, (if care thou hast to stand Vpright) from Lovers gifts to keepe thine hand. Seest thou Love painted naked in all drafts With quiver onely, and some few small shafts? He weares no pocket, but hates all their tribe, Who in Loves free converse expect a bribe. Can Diamond, Iemme, or golden chaine beguile Thy modesty so farre; to become vile? The gaping Oyster, intertaining stones, By'th Crab injected, is dispoild at once. Once guilty of a gift [if put to triall) Thou hast not power to make the least denyall. To receive a gift, is to sell thy liberty. Seneca. Often by too much play, Virgins themselves betray. An Now trifles I injoyne, and I confesse They 're such, yet worthy to be read, (no lesse) To tumble on the grasse, urge them to try Maistries: These fit for chaste ones I deny. A Bee's hid in the flower, a maide doth come, To crop it 'tweene her finger and her thum. No stayes, no rest, her tender flesh it stings, It smarts, it swels, she cryes, her hands she wrings, And saith, why Bee, thus seek'st thou me to kill, I came to sport, and purpos'd thee no ill. When maides with youngmen try, they doe not well, But oft catch stings, which make their flesh to swell. Sporting hath beene the occasion of many evils, as we may read. Horace. Sport hath begot both sudden strife and rage, Anger, contention, warre, commixt with strage. In pastime &amp; sport, womens brests are easily discovered: according with that of the Poet. We are carelesse then of what we doe or say, Our very mindes lie open in our play. Most hold such bad, as love to gad. An. In all things Ovids booke I cannot praise, For he allowes the virgins foot that strayes, He doth advise the Romane girles to meet In Theatres, and gad about the street, In my opinion, he amisse perswades, If I be judge; it is no worke for maides. In streets lust rageth, there thou canst not be Safe; then keepe home, that's the best place for thee. The sheepe that through the briers and thornes doth stray, Much of his wooll, oft loseth by the way: Neither can she her modesty keepe long, Who much frequents the Dionæan throng. The ornament of women is to flourish in honesty and elegancy of manners: and for the most part to keepe within at home: to prescribe limits to her lips, eyes, and cheekes, and not often to put her foot over her owne threshold. Greg. Nazian. There's danger, strictly to confine Either young wenches, or new wine. Phi. Must we be then in lasting darknesse tyde, As in close houses ever to abide? Is it enough that we a mistresse feare, And from her teasty fingers blowes oft beare? Our mind's now stronger grown, love bids us play, And of the City take a free surveigh. Locks cannot let, Venus sets wide the dore, When lovers entrance to clos'd maides implore: Love hates all durance, he was ever free, And Bacchus too delights in liberty, New wine: young maides: by too strict keeping still, Hazard the caske, and house: Both apt to spill. No woman can be restrain'd against her will. Lib. Amor. 3. That which is most kept from us, most we crave, The prey calls theeves, few love what they can have. Id. Such as have leave to sinne, commit least ill, The power to offend, oft takes away the will. Id. That lesse pleaseth us to which wee are most perswaded: that rather wee desire from which wee are most disswaded. There can bee given no strong security, For Maiden-heads in their nativity. Phi. Maides, if you looke to rost your Chestnuts well, Observe first with a knife to wound the shell: If with unbroken skin it touch the fire, 'Twill break in pieces, and with noise retire. Who to chaste love shall make her brest obdure, From Venus, oh what panges shall she procure? She burnes, nor can her youth take least content, That's cloistred, and at home in prison pent. The bridle once tooke off, she growes untame, And then, with greater fury burnes her flame. Some I have seene at lawfull love repine, And after, madly to base lust incline. Dangerous is the custody of a virginity, and most difficultly is she to be restraind, to whom the yoke of virginity is imposed. Egn. That which Tacitus spake of the plebe or multitude, may not unfitly be construed upon young virgins. vid. They are altogether impatient of meere servitude, or absolute liberty. To free thy selfe from danger cleane, Shun the extremes, and keepe the meane. An. I doe not prisons on young Maides conferre, Onely would curbe their feet lest they should erre. Phi. You charg'd me to no sutor lend an eare, What Husband shal I have then? let me heare. An. Marry one grave, of masculine vertue, who No loose veneriall sports is pleas'd to know, On whom Apollo smiles, Themis doth grace, He will direct thy path, secure thy place. If rude (thy selfe) one ruder thou shalt try, Neither the nuptiall office can supply. Ioyne two unlighted Tapers without flame, (How so thou wilt,) the darknesse is the same. What profiteth it thee to grate one tooth against another. Martial. Young Maides fancies are inclind, To'affect the shape, neglect the mind. Phi. Wouldst have a maide to take into her bed, A Sophist of sterne brow, like Cato bred, Whom, courts by day; by night, his bookes afflict, In curtaine businesse, will not he be strict? Whilst he his clients cause doth onely mind, Small right (alas) the bed is like to finde. The gowne the loadstones braine hath, hard things drawes, But in soft amours cannot plead a cause. Lawes not of Benshes of judgement. Benshes, but the bed I love The austeere brow I have no will to prove. Give me the man that's deepely read in kisses, And sure my love aimes at no further blisses. Let us remember that the sexe in its owne nature is weake, as not in body, so neither in minde being able to under-goe things serious and weighty, therefore we must allow them retirement, and relaxation from their cares, and give them some liberty of sporting, and telling tales amongst their friends and neighbours: provided, no curiosity be used, &amp;c. Vives. Merry Suiters, make mad Husbands. An. What madnesse is't of kissing thus to prate, When thou a sacred bed shouldst intimate? Leave lusts to Venus, Husbands are a treasure, And holy Hymen hates the name of pleasure. No groome or squire of Venus can be fit To take a houses charge and mannage it. These The Sun of the morning. Memnons statue follow (in their suite) Who when the Sun shines, clamor, else are mute. Whilst thy choise He was slaine at Troy. Paris in his first love rag'd, 'Twixt you a thousand kisses were ingadg'd. But that heat past, thou (to thy griefe) hast tryd, Th' art onely an unworthy souldiers bride. It is hard to maintaine credit where truth is suspected: but howsoever suspition may enter a false action, yet truth will never bring in her plea, to suspect where there is cause is sufferable: but where there is no cause, it is intolerable. Octavius Cæsar Domum suam non solum crimine, sed suspitione criminis, vacare voluit. i. Augustus Cæsar, would have his house not onely free from fault, but even from the very suspition of crime. Sorrow treads, where folly leads. An. On the bright fire whilst some fish too much gaze, Fixing their eyes upon the tapers blaze: They neither mind the fishers nor their boats, Nor their sharpe knives prepar'd to rip their throats. Whilst the young man, whom mad love doth surprise, Admires his mistresse front, and star-like eyes: Or whilst the girle whom childish folly blinds, His new sprung beard and feature onely minds. All faults lie hid, there is no further stay, 'Tis now enough if they can kisse and play. T'wixt these where itching makes such quick dispatch 'Tis often seene Megæra spoiles the match. As Circe injoy'd not those whom she transform'd into Swine, Lions, &amp;c. but affected Ulysses in his owne perfectnesse aboue all others: So those women who by amorous potions (too which I adde whorish blandishments) have got their husbands, for the most part leade with them an unquiet life, through madnesse. Plutarch. Where vertue tyes, love never dyes. An. The Rose doth yeeld a savour sweet and strong, After 'tis shed, or in the Sunne laine long. Fond is the love of feature, which doth fade, And putrid growes, when age doth once invade, Agues deface, and cares the beauty staine, And these in young men often breed disdaine. But wit's more stedfast; 'twill to age indure, A thousand waies that, favour can procure. Gray haires, nor wrinckles, can such ardor quench, Nor love (on vertue built) in Lethe drench. If match with one, whose mind his shape excels, That love, till death lasts onely, and none else. In us we nought immortall find, Saving the goods of brest and mind. Ovid. Couples ill matcht, like garments patcht. An If love thy selfe, doe not an old man wed, Lest thou lie frozen in a desolate bed. If any; thou a posthume birth shalt beare. He, if thy child call father, cannot heare. Or should he have choice whom to make his heire, Fame, to speake largely of thee will not spare. Meane time the faire flower of thy youth is spent, And thy best dayes thou sadly shalt lament. Why doth the Ivie 'bout the Elme so cling? 'Las; one must perish, if the other spring, Whilst it (ambitious) 'bout the top branch twines, The drooping Tree hangs downe the head and pines. Matrimonium ita demum tranquillè exigi potest, si mulier Cœca, maritus surdus fiat. &amp;c. Then marriage may be said to be past in all quietnesse, when the wife is blind, and the husband deafe. The nature of women is subject to jealousie, from whence grows clamour and noise, and the wives garrulity and prating offends the husband, which he should bee farre from, if he wanted his hearing, &amp;c. Children in law, breed may a flaw. An. Hence brats in law? maides, mothers the first day, What mak'st thou in a widdowed bed I pray? When Hymen joynes you single: these are bred Are the best pledges of thy maidenhead. To graft a branch with ripe fruits if thou strive, 'Tis a meere burden, and it cannot thrive. The withered apples fall (unfit to taste) For both the stock and graft indure like waste, Slyps without fruit, transpose unto thy tree, So shall thy fruit in Autumne better bee. Do't whilst the gumme in the greene rind doth swell, Plants without mutuall sap ne're prosper well. A small benefit may arise to a great profit, if it be seasonably confer'd, saith Curtius. Time is the best counsellor, and the chiefe president of counsels, saith Antisthenes, and Cicero calleth it the most perfect Herald of truth. To have thy will, be humble still. Phi. Now thy injunctions please: but, woon with gold, My father aymes me at a man that's old. What shall I doe? my love I will not slave To an old King, (though he my love should crave.) An. If he to one unworthy would thee tye, What ere he urge, let not thy voyce sound hye, Prayers arme the virgin, If intreat; 'tis done, Sterne fathers, by no other art are woon. Smooth foreheads more prevaile, than these averse Hard hearts, submission, and not feare can pierce. The Pine-tree Nut thou canst not break with blows, But a soft fire, the shels wide open throws. Mild power doth compasse that which rough violence never can. Claud. Where men by favour strive to git Gods favour, and incourage it, But the same gods when force is us'd, (As angry) thinke themselves abus'd. 1. An. We are in harbour, thou shalt be a bride, Heare something in that state thy selfe to guide. The grafter, all the native sprigs doth strip, That the whole sap may feed th' adopted slip. All wandring fancies she must quite expell, Who in a lawfull match would prosper well. No sooner shall thy nuptiall Tead take fire, But thou on him must fixe thy whole desire. Not thy old play-fellow must thine house frequent, Nor he with whom (before) thine houres thou spent. Let mother and thy sister now goe by, Lest former love the adopted sap should dry. Let men obey the lawes, and women their husbands. Socrates. Silence and patience maketh concord betwixt married couples. A good husband ought to be wise in words, wary in conversation, carefull in provision, diligent in ordering: a discreet master, a carefull father. A good wife must bee grave abroad, well govern'd at home, patient to suffer, constant to love, to her neighbours friendly, courteous to her servants, carefull of her children. Theophrastus. 2. An. Am I deceiv'd? or more else should be spoke, To such as newly enter Hymens yoake. The stock which late had branches of his owne, Must now by a strange leafe and fruit be knowne. The top cut off, it boasts not its owne seed, But beareth what another branch did breed. When married; thou thy selfe wilt then withdraw, For now thy husband is to thee a law. What he prescribes: to that thou must agree, (If wise) so partner of his counsels be. By his direction, all thine actions sway, To yeeld's to conquer, and (to rule) to obey. A chaste Matron by obeying her husbands will, getteth command over him, Bias. But give thy wife no power over thee, for if this day thou sufferest her to tread upon thy foot, she will be ready by to morrow to spurne at thy head, &amp;c. 3. An. Grafting hath more on which thy mind may rest, Graft then these precepts likewise in thy brest. Tree's grace the graft, by sap themselves do spend, And their owne ornament to others lend. If with thy golden dower thy house shine bright, And swell his coffers which before were light: Be not thou proud, nor thine owne wealth proclaime, Let all thine house rest in thine husbands name. Who would not thinke that clamorous woman mad, To cry This, That, from me, my husband had. These were, and are still mine. It is not knowne How wives can bost of ought that is their owne. That the law make men lords, there is no doubt, And 'tis a right, that goes the world throughout. Marriage teacheth, that a woman should hold her husband to be all things unto her, and that he alone shall succeed in all loving and deare nominations, which (as we read in Homer) the most vertuous Andromache confers upon her husband Hector. What father, mother, brother, else can be, Thou, thou, sweet husband art all these to me. The Epilogue. Proceeding further we were strooke with feare, Because of noise which Anna first did heare: Enough if not too much, come now let's breake, This having said, she blusht, and ceast to speake.

      <field name="fulltext">Sundry Fancies writ upon severall occasions. By the same Author. The Queene feasting the King at Somerset house, upon his Birth-day, hers falling in the same weeke, this was there spoken unto them. VVee cannot read in any flourishing state, Whether by King swaid or by optimate, A greater blessing hapning to one Nation, By two such births, beneath one constellation. For being in one moneth, one weeke; small let October. There was, these two blest birth-dayes had not met: Yet hath the powerfull hand of heaven so guided, (Though) by small distance of two dayes divided: These starres who then, their influence had alone Are now combin'd, fixt in one glorious Throne: From whose joynt rayes another's risen since, (Lusterd from both) a sweet and hopefull Prince. O may he from your vertues so much gaine, That little Charles may prove our Charlemaine. To them both at parting. The Romanes of their birth-dayes had such care, They kept them sacred, and not one might dare, In all their families to worke, but play, Observing that, as an high festivall day. The Emperours birth-dayes were cald Albæ, white, As the sole lustre, and their Kingdomes light. In you: how much doth heaven your Nations blesse, To enjoy two such: the greater, and the lesse. A speech spoken to their two excellent Majesties, at the first Play play'd by the Queenes Servants, in the new Theater at White Hall. When Greece, the chiefe priority might claime For Arts, and Armes, and held the eminent name Of Monarchie; They erected divers places, Some to the Muses, others to the Graces: Where Actors strove, and Poets did devise With tongue and pen, to please the eares and eyes Of Princely Auditors; The time was, when To heare, the rapture of one Poets pen, A Theater hath beene built, By the fates doome, When th' Empire was removed from thence to Rome. The potent Cæsars had their Circi, and Large Amphitheaters: in which might stand And sit, full fourescore thousand, all in view, And touch of voice: This great Augustus knew. Nay Rome, it's wealth, and potency injoyd, Till by the barbarous Gothes these were destroy'd. But may this structure last, and you be seene Here a spectator, with your Princely Queene, In your old age, as in your flourishing prime, To out-strip Augustus both in fame and time. To the King and Queene upon a New-yeares day at night: the Two-fac't Ianus with a great golden Key in his hand, the Presenter. Where is my Sonne December? yong'st and last Of twelve? what sleeping now? now snorting fast? In this joyes festivall? from yeares agone, Solemnis'd one thousand sixe hundred thirty one. Can neither musick, sport, nor myrth awake thee, But to eleven moneths sleep must thou betake thee? Why doth not Ianuary then appeare, Before old Ianus father of the yeare? My eldest boy? now I remember. Hee, Is busied in this annuall Iubilee. And still the one hand with the other shifts, In giving and receiving New-yeares gifts. But stay; two faces Ianus? one to view The past yeare; th' other, that which shall insue. Shal't be imputed to thine age or sloath To neglect these; the glory of them both? Meaning their 2. Majesties. No; fall thus low, to celebrate that throne In which the two great lights are met in one Without ecclipse; This key commands the screw, That lockes the past yeare up, and opes the new. This shuts up all disaster, dearth, disease, Opening to you all glad things that may please, To crowne your blessednesse, and as that gone. Hath crown'd you with an Heire (as yet alone) There's by auspitious Iove a second breeding, Our hope, and honour of the yeare succeeding. As in the last, may Heaven in this defend them, Whilst Ianus with his twelve sonnes shall attend them. The Epilogue spoken by the same Ianus. Health, strength, and many a glad new yeare, A constant solace, joyfull cheere, Waite ever on that awfull throne, Where rest two Princely hearts, made one. From which blest union, may supply Of issue to eternity Grace and become it: These presages Prove fortunate to after ages, Which long succession hence may see, Till time and houres shall cease to bee. A Prologue spoke before the King, when her Majesty was great with child. Health, joy, peace, plenty, and a flourishing state, A dexter omen; an auspitious fate, Attend you ever, like Hiperion shine In his meridian, never to decline. And may your royall Cynthia who hath run Sixe annuall courses with you, and begun, Now on the seventh, who to your Kingdomes Cheere And your great joy, at this time fills her sphere, In a most hopefull plenitude: so waine After blest issue, that your glorious raigne, May see your Sonnes Sonnes Princes of such name, That the whole world may eccho to their fame. From her chast wombe may such faire daughters spring, That each may prove the consort to a King. And both survive to see't: this we intreat May come from her who is so good, so great. The Epilogue. Those heavenly Guardians that with patents large, Have in tuition Kings and Kingdomes charge, Protect you both, that as we daily see Nations, that farre remote and forraigne be Send hither as to an Oracle to know, What's for their safety best: you may still grow In wisedome and in power, till your command May extend it selfe so farre by Sea and Land, That through the Christian world it may be said, All begge of Charles, but he needs no mans ayd. Another spoken at White Hall before their sacred Majesties. Exuberant joyes, delights transcending waite About the orbe of this illustrious state. All sad disasters flie beyond those Seas That ebbe and flow unto th' Antipodes. Or if they chance to linger by the way, May they with Mahomet, and Ali stay: But never in these Climes find place of rest Or shelter, where the sacred truth's profest, But in their stead, prosperity and peace, Aboundance, health, with numerous increase Of royall issue 'bout your throne be seene, To glad my soveraigne, and rejoyce his Queene: So shall your Nations in bright lustre shine, Figuring in these your Persons, powers divine. The Epilogue. Miriads of joyes your royall hearts surprise, Yea more than any rapture can devise, The heart of man conceive, or tongue expresse, That in your more than common happinesse, All your true subjects with unanimous voice, May both in you, and your blest seed rejoyce. A Prologue spoken to their sacred Majesties at Hampton Court. If Cæsar, greatest in great Pompeis fall, As being made the soveraigne over all The (then knowne) world; or if Augustus; Hee Who left his ample name Hereditarie To all succeeding Emperours; If to th' last Of the twelve Cæsars, Theaters were grac't, And when the Iulian family expir'd In many ages after were admir'd? And the more fame from forraigne parts to win, Adornd without, and beautified within. If by succession we can draw them downe Through nations, realmes and tongues, even to our own, Proving these flourishing Kingdomes prosperd well, And never faild before these structures fell: Or were supprest; for 'tis a bad presage, (All mirth exil'd) still followes wrack and strage. If then a factious peevish male-content, Envying a blest state; shall his malice vent In bald unlicenc't papers? so much daring As neither Soveraigne, nor the subject sparing: Assuming in a strange libellious straine, To thinke all wisedome treasur'd in his braine? Be all such frustrate in their vaine indeavour, Whilst you oh Royall Cæsar live for ever. The Epilogue. Ioves Influent Planet boading power and state For ever, on this high tribunall waite. Apolloe's fire, add verdure, to your dayes, And crown your long raigne with his Daphnes bayes. Hermes attend you with his peaceful starre, And Mars protect you in all menacing warre. May Venus and the Moones bright constellations, With their best fulgence smile on all your Nations: But on all male-contents let Saturne lower, Such as maligne your glory and your power. Spoken to their two Majesties at Hampton Court. Prologue. Amongst the Greecians there were annuall feasts, To which none were invited as chiefe gests, Save Princes and their wives: Amongst the men No argument could be desputed then But who best govern'd; and (as't did appeare) He was proclaim'd sole Soveraigne for that yeare, The Queenes and Ladies argued at that time For beauty and for vertue, who was prime. And she had the like honour. Two here be, For Beauty one, the other Majesty. Most worthy, did that custome still persever, Not for one yeare, but to be soveraignes ever. Epilogue. Still the more glorious that the creatures bee, They in their native goodnesse are more free To things below them: so the sunne wee find Vnpartially to shine on all mankind, Denying light to none, and you we may Great King, most justly call our light, our day, Whose glorious course may never be quite runne, Whilst earth hath soveraigne, or the Heavens a Sunne. Spoken to their two Majesties at White Hall. Prologue. Whom Heaven with all choice graces hath indowed, Whom even the Angels praise and men admire! On whom your Maker hath his bounty showed, Where nothing wants that mans heart can desire, Your peoples joy, your Peeres selected pleasure. Your Kingdomes admiration, Nations wonder, Of forraigne climes the praise, of ours the treasure. O never may that sacred union sunder. That whilst we daily of high heaven importune, You may be in your royall issue blest, You may still grow in greatnesse, fame and fortune, All which at seeming height, be still increast. Prove thou a prophet muse, say 'tis decreed, All Christendome shall flourish in your seed. The Epilogue. Could we all Panegyries put in one, That have beene on the ancient Heroes writ, They might all be conferd on you alone, And you great Princes justly merit it. O may you in your happy loves persever, Diurnally augment, but not decline, That this your people may admire you ever, Till heaven that gave you us make you divine. And that which we of aged Nestor read, May of you two be chronicled indeed. Spoken to their excellent Majesties upon the like occasion. Prologue. Excellent Princes may you ever bee, As great as good, each yeare a Iubilee. That as heavens bounty crownes you with th' increase Of honour, glory, and domestick peace. You, with like liberall hands instated here, May to each subject and deserving Peere: Like the bright Sunne your glorious favours throw, To comfort and make flourish what's below. Whilst we like the woods Quiristers still sing Loud Hymnes to you the Lord of this our spring. The Epilogue. You that are Emblemes of that light divine, Which equally on all estates doth shine, The Palace and the Cottage, flower and weed, Of whose bright luster all have use, and need, Even from the Scarlet, to the Russet: Gray As well as Purple: Had we power, as they That are in eminent place; there could not be Those, should expresse more gratitude than we. The rich may pay in gold, that which he owes, But we our debt, onely in words and showes. Spoken to the King and Queene, at the second time of the Authors Play cald Cupids Mistresse or Cupid and Psiche, presented before them. Cupid, the Prologue. Yes; sure 'twas here, where some few houres I past The very time that I descended last. Yes; here it was, I know it by a face, To which my Mistresse Psiche must give place. A presence; that from Venus takes all power, And makes each place she comes in, Cupids bower. Though in their severall spheres each Planet tride, (With all the Gods) to feast me and my bride, With Nector and Ambrosia, yet that waste Of god-like fare, could not my palate taste, But I must all celestiall sweets forbeare, To review earthly Iove and Iuno here. Whom having seene; Haile to you once againe. Long as the Spheres continue may you raigne In Majesty, in power, with issue blest Be all these, with your fortunate yeares increase, Till Cupid ever young, with time grow old, And you this Iron age changing to gold, Repur'd by your two vertues, These, Ethereall May change to brighter chayres in th'heavens Imperiall The speech spoken to their two Majesties, eight dayes before, being the Kings birth-day: presented at Somerset house, by the Queenes appointment, she then feasting the King. Cupid, the Prologue. Who so unread; doth not of Plato heare His Annus magnus, and his vertent yeare? In which the Starres and Planets, Moone and Sunne, Tyr'd with continuall labour, having runne So many ages long peregrination, Each returnes fresh and new to their first station. This is the yeare sure; rather this the day Able to turne November into May. This day's in heaven a Iubilee of joy, Where Angels sing in quires Vive la Roy. This is the royall birth-day of a King, Then Men with Angels, Iô Pœan sing. I'had almost lost my selfe: when my intent Was to tell why I come; and from whom sent; From one, to whom I'm but a shadow; shee The very soule of amabilitie. One that without my quiver and my bow, Commands the hearts, and eyes of high and low. Whose name inscrib'd here did you but behold, T'would change the sooty Inke to liquid gold. Of fulgent beauty, but so pure a mind, As if tinctur'd from heaven, and so divin'd. I Love from Love am sent, but she the right, Then grace great King the Triumphs of loves night. The Maske concluding with a stately measure, of the Gods and Planets, Cupid (they all standing about him bending) the Epilogue thus concludes. Now royall Princes let me turne to you, Daigne from loves mouth to take this nights adieu. Thinke all these Planets that on earth here move, (Shadowes of these celestiall ones above) Breath on you their best influences: Vulcan, Hee Shall henceforth take charge of your Armorie. Iuno the marriage Queene, shall blesse your bed, The Sunne shall take the bright beames from his head, To increase your glorious luster, and the Moone Attend on you, to make your midnight noone. Ceres with plenty shall inrich your store, And Mercury shall flie from shore to shore Vpon your errands: prove your happy ranger, Homebred to espy, and foresee forraigne danger. Venus with sweets, and I, with love will charme you, And after all these Iove with power shall arme you. I'have kept you waking long: good night, 'tis late. Many such birth-dayes may you celebrate. Spoken to his Majesty upon a New yeares day at night. The Prologue. Renowned King, we to your eares commend These our unpolisht labours, harsh and low, Hoping your grace will like the Sunne extend, Those glorious beames that make the Cedars grow, Shine on the basest shrubs, his vertue's seene As well in weeds as flowers, for both are greene. Then let your Majesty by whose aspect All these sweetgarden flowers, these Trees still flourish, The least part of your glorious shine reflect On us: your beames great Brittaines land doth nourish. Still moving in this bright and luminous sphere, To joy your Court with many a glad New-yeare. The Epilogue. 'Mongst other presents, high and sacred King, This solemne day presented at your seat Their tribute love, your humble vassals bring. But though our gifts be small, our wills are great, We come, though naked of desert or merit, Yet arm'd with wishes, and devoutest prayer, Trusting you many ages may inherit That high Tribunall, peace and love prepare, That this first day which enters a new yeare, On which the two fac't Ianus lookes with joy, May many seasons hence, with gladsome cheare, Be hallowed still, that heavens hand may destroy Your enemies: and so your friends maintaine. They many yeares hence may admire your raigne Another spoken at the Court to the like purpose. Prologue. As all small rivers to the ocean runne, As to the soveraigne of their silver streames, As all lesse lights doe borrow of the Sunne, From whom alone they take their golden beames. So to this glorious Sunne we pay our light, Without whose face we live in endlesse night. O you, on your owne earth soly divine, Who fill your faire Court with your beames of grace, With one small glimmering on our pastimes shine, The Sun barres none the beauty of his face. Poets that have like Larkes already sung, Vnto the morning of your prosperous raigne, Shall with an Angels quill and Cherubs tongue, Your grace and goodnesse through the world proclaime. But when you reach the noontyde point, then stay, And in the height of glory shine for aye. Epilogue. Most high and sacred Sir, we now are cast Low as the earth, strook mute with feare and terror, Lest through our want of judgement we have past Words rudely plac't: or duty mixt with error. The Shepheards Pipe made of an Oaten Reed, Cannot compare with great Apollos lyre: Nor should our Muse, that no delight can breed Vnto your high and Princely eares aspire. We bring a mite that would present a mine, Our loves we pay, to whom our lives we owe, Water we bring, who could affoord it wine, Our art you see, our hearts we cannot show. O if we could! we would inrich this place With joyes essentiall, blessings above measure. Heaven, Earth, Ayre, Sea, all powre upon your grace, Their speciall bounties, and their richest treasure. In our last wish all your desires attaine, Life, safety, health, with a long-lasting raigne. A Prologue spoken at the right Honourable the Earle of Dover house in Broadstreet, at a Play in a most bountifull Christmas hee kept there; the Speaker Hospitality a frollick old fellow: A Coller of Brawne in one hand, and a deepe Bowle of Muscadel in the other. Where is that rich mans Minion, cal'd Frugality? What hath he quite hence banisht Hospitality? In dayes of old, when yea and nay did passe For currant troth, I and old Christenmasse Were of acquaintance; but of late I find Frugality quick sighted, my selfe blind. He goes through Court, through Country, City, and Findes entertainment, for each frugall hand Still bids him welcome: yet a novice hee: But I, that am of more antiquity Than Pauls (alas) by time and age decayd, Nay almost since this Cities ground-sills layd, Walke up and downe and knock at each mans dore, And finde the same cold welcome as before. But harke, a Cock crowd, and I heard a Swan Ecchoing to him, that here did live a man, Noble, and of that high and ancient straine, To call back Hospitality againe. Then by the good Lords and kind Ladies leave, Since their wide Gates stand ready to receive So great a stranger, and (in me) these guests So oft invited to their annuall feasts. This blessing take, oh whether in this place, Or where so else this blest time you so grace, May your warme Chimneyes smoke, and hot fires glow, Whilst Thames breeds Swans, or Cocks 'gainst Christmas crow. It is to be observed that the Earle in Heraldry gives the Swan, and the Countesse the Cocke, &amp;c. The Epilogue presented by delight. We see bright day succeeds darke night, Disaster past, then comes delight, From seeming death reviv'd to tell, That here she henceforth meanes to dwell, When hospitality hath grace, Delight should ever there finde place. Receive her then your houshold guest, This night to attend you to your rest: And when your quiet sleepe is spent, Awake you to your more content, At home, abroad, handmaid, and guide: Whether you sit, lye, walke or ride, Sport, purpose serious meditation, And thought, still have to me relation, And so for ever, as this night, Be waited on by choise delight. Spoken to the right Honourable the Earle of Dover, at his house in Broadstreet upon a Candlemas night. The Prologue. The downy Swan though yoakt in Venus Teame, Yet of all birds that ever lov'd the streame, Is held to be the chiefest: Pallas Owle In Athens fam'd for many a learned scrowle, Compos'd in Inke and Oyle, th' embleme of watch, By which the most laborious students catch At Arts (howe're, benighted) was not more Famous, in Greece, then on Caister shore Your sacred Bird, which the nine Sisters strove To make the symbole of conjugall love, With which the Cock, the Bird of Mars combin'd, A double gardian knot, to be untwin'd Never: 'Tis now made fast, so intricate, Not Alexanders sword, not time, not fate Can e'ver untye, for what's in vertue laid, Envie can never blast, nor age invade. In this blest state both you, and yours, now stand As first dispos'd, so strengthened by that hand, Which as it makes, protects; you have begun To grace the City with your presence: run That happy course still: you and your lov'd wife Have to dead hospitality given new life. Still cherish it: old Christenmasse almost starv'd Through base neglect, by you hath beene preserv'd. O give him still like welcome, that whilst he Hath name on earth, you may his harbourer be. Epilogue. What man can wish his blisse to crowne, Or in abundance heaven powre downe. Health, plenty, solace, all delights That lengthen dayes, or shorten nights. Heavens favour, and the Courts best grace, Attend the great Lord of this place. Old Christenmasse hunger-starv'd and dry, Who earst did drinke deepe and far'd hye You welcome, and with Princely cheere, Feast Ianus father of the yeare. The sparing Chuff could be content To thrust the twelve dayes into Lent. You Englands custome, wake from sleepe, Which all the Christian world still keepe: For which may you thus stor'd with guests Long celebrate these annuall feasts, That you and your good Lady may Together, many a New-yeares day, Rejoyce in your blest Issue till The houres shall faile, and time stand still. A speech spoken before the right Honourable the Earle of Dover, at his House at Hunsden, as a preparation to a Maske, which consisted of nine Ladyes. Presented the last New-yeares night. The silver Swan soft gliding in the streame, Cald to the Cocke then pearching on a beame, And said to him; why, Chanticleere, when I Move on the waves so low, thou sit'st so high? The Cocke replide: O thou my best lov'd Sister Well knowne in Poe, Meander, and Caister, But best in Thamesis; Dost thou not know The reason, why we in December crow? More than before, or after? who againe Thus answer'd: we of nothing can complaine Being of all the birds that are, most white, Loyall and chaste, and taking our delight In rivers onely, bathing there our feete To make our rare-heard musick sound more sweet. Yet one thing to resolve, would make me proud, To tell why at this time thou sing'st so lowd? Who said: none of our ancestors but knew That ever since Saint Peters Cock first crew, We are injoyn'd to make lowd proclamation, Of our most blessed Saviours Incarnation. To which the Swan, (then in a Tone much higher) Said, in this Caroll I will fill the quire: Which being voyc't, did sound so sweet and shrill, That where the Swan and Cock were heard, did fill The ayre with such an eccho, thither came Vpon that summons, both the blind and lame, Hungry and thirsty, poore, of all estates, And none but fully sated at these gates. Long may your bounty last, and we rejoyce, To heare both City and the Country voyce Your Hospitality, to your loud fame, Whilst Time indures, or Christmas beares a name. And now great Lord and Lady both prepare, To know what Sports in agitation are. Truth presenting the Maskers. Plaine Truth who onely hath the power To steare the way to vertues bower, By these cleare Tapers shining bright, Doth celebrate this joviall night. But by the Bird of Mars that crowes, I now perceive the morning growes. Her love to Phœbus to expresse, And put his steeds in glorious dresse Who shewes you what chaste virgins dwell, Within the bosome of this Cell, Appeare then O thou treble Trine Of number, with the Muses nine. (Appolloes sacred daughters) still Frequent about Pernassus hill. Or if you number them by Threes, The first are the three Charitees, Handmaides to Venus, Graces stil'd, On whom their Father Iove still smil'd. The second Chorus doth containe Those beauties, by the Trojan swaine On Ida judg'd: The third we call The Vertues Theologicall, Faith, Hope, and Love, haply meet here, To crowne the parting of the yeare, With Roses fresh of Swan-like hew, Which from a royall Stemme first grew, And the brave Yorkists long since bore, These vertues bower, doe best decore, Flowers redolent, which Heralds say, Ianus doth weare, as well as May. Farre may they spread, be ever seene, With milke white leaves, and branches greene, Folded in amorous twines together, Which Winter ne're may blast or wither. A young witty Lad playing the part of Richard the third: at the Red Bull: the Author because hee was interessed in the Play to incourage him, wrot him this Prologue and Epilogue. The Boy the Speaker. If any wonder by what magick charme, Richard the third is shrunke up like his arme: And where in fulnesse you expected him, You see me onely crawling, like a limme Or piece of that knowne fabrick, and no more, (When he so often hath beene view'd before.) Let all such know: a Rundlet ne're so small Is call'd a vessell: being a Tunne; that's all. Hee's tearm'd a man, that showes a dwarfish thing, No more's the Guard, or Porter to the King. So Pictures in small compasse I have seene Drawne to the life, as neare, as those have beene Ten times their bignesse: Christenmas loaves are bread, So's your least Manchet: have you never read Large folio Sheets which Printers over-looke, And cast in small, to make a pocket booke? So Richard is transform'd: if this disguise Show me so small a letter for your eyes, You cannot in this letter read me plaine, Hee'l next appeare, in texted hand againe. The Epilogue. Great I confesse your patience hath now beene, To see a little Richard: who can win, Or praise, or credit? eye, or thinke to excell, By doing after what was done so well? It was not my ambition to compare, No envie, or detraction: such things are In men of more growne livers, greater spleene, But in such lads as I am, seldome seene. I doe, but like a child, who sees one swim, And (glad to learne) will venter after him Though he be soundly duckt for't, or to tell My mind more plainely, one that faine would spell, In hope to read more perfect: all the gaines I expect for these unprofitable paines, Is, that you would at parting from this place Doe but unto my littlenesse that grace To spie my worth, as I have seene dimme eyes To looke through spectacles, or perspectives, That in your gracious view I may appeare, Of small, more great; of coming far off, neare. A Prologue to the Play of Queene Elizabeth as it was last revived at the Cock-pit, in which the Author taxeth the most corrupted copy now imprinted, which was published without his consent. Prologue. Playes have a fate in their conception lent, Some so short liv'd, no sooner shew'd, than spent; But borne to day, to morrow buried, and Though taught to speake, neither to goe nor stand. This: (by what fate I know not) sure no merit, That it disclaimes, may for the age inherit. Writing 'bove one and twenty; but ill nurst, And yet receiv'd, as well perform'd at first, Grac't and frequented, for the cradle age, Did throng the Seates, the Boxes, and the Stage So much; that some by Stenography drew The plot: put it in print: (scarce one word trew:) And in that lamenesse it hath limp't so long, The Author now to vindicate that wrong Hath tooke the paines, upright upon its feete To teach it walke, so please you sit, and see't. Epilogue. The Princesse young Elizabeth y'have seene In her minority, and since a Queene. A Subject, and a Soveraigne: in th' one A pittied Lady: in the royall Throne A potent Queene. It now in you doth rest To know, in which she hath demeand her best. Vpon his Majesties last birth-night, be being then thirty five yeares of age, and the Queene great with child. A Star appearing of bright constellation, More luminous than those of the same station, The powers Cœlestiall much amaz'd thereat To know the cause thereof, in Councell sate, And summond Mercury the winged god To search and find what wonder it might bode, Who brought them word that Lachesis then drew A thread from Clothoes distaffe, which to'his view Was of such splendor, and withall so fine, (The substance gold) and of so close a twine, No edge could sunder, and that Star (so bright) Rose five and thirty yeares since, as this night. You are (if time we may compute) by story In the meridian of your age and glory. Your Cynthia too that shines by you so neare, And now with such rare splendor fills her sphere, Whose birth-dayes almost meete, as if that fate Would adde a double lustre to your state. Never may your two golden threds be spun. Whilst the Moone guides the night, or day the Sun. Epilogue. What Muse so mute, but both with voice and strings Will strive to celebrate the births of Kings. Kings birth-dayes, of such goodnesse and renowne. Ceres should fill with plenty, Bacchus Crowne. Mirth should exceed it's limite, Ioyes abound, And (after praise to heaven giv'n) Healths go round. No other language then let this night coyne, But Vive, vive la Roy, vive la Royne. Spoken to the Palsgrave at his first comming over, in the presence of his Majesty, &amp;c. The bright hayr'd Comets are of all the best, Boading most good, when ayming towards the West. (So Astrologians say) and when such shine, Grosse clowds they scatter, and the ayre refine. Now such an one appeares; a glorious thing, As if the Eagle from her spatious wing Had her prime feather dropt, which to regaine, She (almost) would give Almaigne, Rome, and Spaine. A feather to be stuck in Venus fanne. The like to it, not Iunoes Peacock can In all her moon'd traine boast: may your fame flie, Mounted upon those plumes that soare most hie: Of which, make two rare presidents, We intreat, One of Charles little, th' other Charles the Great. Epilogue. A numerous fruit, sprung from a golden Tree, Such (as old Atlas, was ne're seene by thee In thine Hesperian orchard) long t' indure And prosper in the world: now growes mature. And the faire blossoms ready even to spread Their leaves abroad, and top the Eagles Head (The Roote still safe) where-ever shall bee seene Scient, transplanted, may it still grow greene, So may none issuing from King Iames his Stemme, But be thought fit to weare a Diadem. Would you a president by which to steare So faire a course? you may behold it here. If you to Honours Apex would attaine, Let the bright Starres that guide you be Charles waine.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Funerall Elegies and Epitaphs. A Funerall Elegie upon the death of the thrice noble Gentleman Sir George Saint Poole of Lincolne-shire my Country-man. It is a maxime, neither birth nor state, Honour nor goodnesse can divert our fate. If these, or more, that did in him accrew (For these with his gifts valewd were but few) Could doe't; St. Poole had liv'd to Englands good, Since all these did nobilitate his blood. Antiquity; which though it cannot save From death, yet helpes to decorate the grave, Heralds his gentry, and doth highly advance His pedegree from the St. Pooles of France, Which, from the Norman Innovation till His expiration hath beene eminent still. That was his least, though some extoll it most. Of that which is not ours why should we boast? That's our best noblenesse which our vertues win, Not that, to which w' are borne, and claime by kin. He was possest of both, and in full measure, Did in his bosome many vertues treasure, Which on the earth hee did but put to lone, He now in heaven receives them ten for one. Vpheld he hath, and husbanded that fame Which from his ancient Predecessors came. Being much in him augmented: his revenue Grac't, and ennobled by that faire retenue. He kept about him still not like this age, Changing his traine, to a Foot-boy or a Page. Free hospitality exil'd the Reame, He tooke in charge, which like a plenteous streame On his full tables flow'd (now a strange thing) It rather seem'd a torrent than a spring, His hand was ever open, but before All others, to the vertuous and the poore; Not as most men are bounteous now; to those That either need not, or with cunning glose. They that were nearest bosom'd, knew, his heart, Beyond all favour still preferd desert. Religious zeale with which he was inspir'd 'Bove common measure, made him both admir'd, And lov'd: besides upon that honour'd place Where he had voice, alwayes the poore mans case He would first heare, and howsoe're the rest That sate with him were swaid, favour'd th'opprest. In all moralities, as courtesie, Bounty, love, generous affability, And other of like kind, each way so rare, He hath left few, that may with him compare. Of Arts, a Patron to the learned, still A knowne Mœcena's, and to all of skill A favourer, witnesse that annuall fee, Which (Oxford) in his death he bequeath'd thee. But wherefore should my duller Muse aspire, To expresse what I better should admire, Which rather may extenuate, then with praise Condigne, and worthy his high vertues raise. Then, with the Country who his death deplore, With these, whom he still patroniz'd, the poore, The wrong'd, who misse his justice, with the weale, Which will soone want him, with the men of zeale, And most religious; with the nobler spirits With whom he was companion, Lords and Knights, With his Allyes and friends; and with his traine (Of servants, who have most cause to complaine The losse of such a Master, in's best yeares Snatcht from the earth) my Muse concludes in teares. A Funerall Elegie upon a vertuous Maide, who dyed the very day on which shee should have beene married. O Hymen change thy saffron weeds, To habit black and sable: Change joyfull Acts, to Funerall deeds, Since nothing's firme or stable. My bridals are to burials turn'd, My day of mirth to sorrow: Show me the man who most hath mourn'd? From him my griefe Ile borrow. In stead of love and second life A dead corps I imbraced: Receiv'd a Coffin for a wife, With hearbs and flowers inchaced. Her beauty better had becom'd A Bride-bed than a grave: But envious fates her dayes have sum'd And crost what I did crave. All lovers that Have truely lov'd, Beare part in my laments: 'Mongst thousands scarcely one hath prov'd My tragick discontents. Heaven mourne her death in stormy clouds, Seas, weepe for her in brine. Thou earth which now her body shrouds, Lament though she be thine. That musick which with merry Tones Should to a bridall sound, Sigh out my griefe and passionate grones, Since she is toomb'd in ground. An Epitaph upon the death of Sir Philip Woodhouse Knight Baronet. From valiant Iohn this Philip Woodhouse springs Hee (of the Chamber to the greatest Kings Henry the fift) who'at famous Agincourt Woon that eternis'd Motto, Frappe fort, Snatcht from a noble Frenchman, when by force In the mid-field, he beat him from his horse, And brought him prisoner, for which warlike deed, (As Souldiers still deserve their valours meed) All Heraldry hath to his Crest allow'd A Hand and Club extended from a cloud. This Iohn had issue Edward: Edward then Thomas: and Thomas, Roger: He agen Thomas, and Thomas, Roger, who was father To this Sir Philip, Him, whose dust we gather, To mixe with his brave Ancestors, the last Of sixe successive Knights whose fates are cast; Thus was he borne, thus lineally descended, For whom this pious Sacred is commended. Ag'd sixty one, Knighted in Spaine, and hee Of Baronets in ranck the fortieth three, By order and precedence, here now sleepes, For whom this monumentall Marble weepes. Reader, who e're thou beest, conceive this done By the due office of a gratefull sonne. An Epitaph upon one Mr. Robert Honywood and his Mother, and of their numerous Issue. Increase and multiply God said: to thee No doubt he spake O Honywood: for we Know, thou as Sire and Grandsire, hast to Heaven Added, of soules one hundred twenty seven, And yet thy mother did thee farre surmount Three hundred sixty seven, her age could count. Sacrum Amoris. Perpetuitati memoriæ Katharinæ Skip: obijt Anno salutis millesimo Sexcentesimo Tricesimo. Ætatis suæ, Vicesimo nono. Can foure weake lines comprise her vertues? no, Not volumes can, here lyes beneath this stone, All that her sex since Eve could learne or know, (Alas) where shall they harbour now shee's gone? Of Mr. Thomas Skipp her husband since deceased, and buried in the same Tombe, whose Statue is plac't in a circle of Bookes, for the great love he bore to learning. What stronger circle can Art-magick find Wherein a Scholers spirit can be confind, Then this of Bookes? next how he spent his time, Scorning earths drosse to looke on things sublime. So long thy love to learning shall be read, Whilst fame shall last, or Statues for the dead. An Epitaph upon a worthy Gentlewoman whose name was Patience. Impatience, why from Patience shouldst thou grow? Or why such sorrow raise from sweet content? From pleasures spring, why should displeasure flow? Or our late joyes turne to such sad lament? But that we see, as time to death is hasting, Nothing on earth is permanent and lasting Saving Impatience, sorrow and displeasure, Laments and strange disasters that still fall, The losse of solace, comfort and of treasure, And of these nam'd this losse includeth all. A losse indeed this Grizels losse implyes, Since here with her all womens patience lyes. An Epitaph upon a vertuous young Gentlewoman, who after seven yeares marriage expired. Well borne, well bred, brought up with cost and care, Sweet Infant, hopefull child, and virgin chaste. Marriage which makes up women, made her rare, Matron and maide, with all choise vertues grac't, Loving and lov'd of all (her husband chiefe) Liv'd to our great joy, dyde to all our griefe. Vpon a Toomb-stone which covereth the body of a worthy Citizen, on which is ingraven a white hand pointing to a Starre. Pure Heart, white hand, one shadowed, th'other seene, Points to a Starre, to show what both have beene. The Heart devout: in life a constant giver, The Hand that gift, as ready to deliver, In such alternate goodnesse, both agreeing, As seldome to be matcht when they had being. The Heart bequeath'd, the Hand did still bestow, Both reape in Heaven, what they on earth did sow. A Funerall Elegie upon the death of Mistris Mary Littleboyes, Daughter to Master George Littleboyes of Ashburnham in Sussex, Esquire. She was a virgin tall, as towards Heaven growing, Who had she by Emergent Venus stood, (Her dewy locks about her shoulders flowing, And Cupid viewde them both at once) He woo'd (Not able to distinguish one from th' other) Have leapt into her lap, there toyde and plaid, And (though a maide) mistooke her for his mother. So faire she was; But thus all beauties fade. All the choice vertues, morall and divine, That ever grac't the sex, compris'd in one, Did in her faire brest mutually combine, And where shall they find harbour now shee's gone? Whom heaven did love, who merited mans praise, Modest, wise, pious, charitable, chaste, Whose vertues did in number passe her dayes, Now (woe the while) in darknesse sleepes her last. Well borne, well bred, brought up with cost and care, Of singular parts; the sole admir'd 'mongst many, In all her gracefull carriage, choise and rare. But what of these? we see death spares not any. Besides all other rich decorements she So sweetly sung, her voice did rapture breed, No spring-tide bird to her compar'd might be, Who Orpheus did, and Thamiras exceed. And what's of rare remarke; even all that day, (The saddest to her friends that ever came) When she (sweet soule) upon her death-bed lay, She to choise musicall notes her voice did frame. Her Funerall Dirge the dying Swan so sings, Then Angels waited to make up the Quire, And beare her soule on their celestiall wings, Vnto that place shee living did desire. Were all the pens of Poets joyn'd in one, Dipt in like Inke, and sworne, to write her true; Let them spend all their spirits on her alone, Yet can they not ascribe to her her due. Apollo write thy selfe, for this doth aske No humane skill, to give her merited praise. Thy Daphne dead, now take in hand this taske, Do't as it ought, and ever weare thy bayes. The Inscription upon her Tombe-stone lying in Clerkenwell Church. Hereunder lyes a Casket, that containd A life unspotted, and a soule unstaind, A virgin chaste, beyond example faire, For outward gifts remark't, for inward, rare, Of natures pieces, one the prime and choice, So nurturd, that for needle, booke and voice She was unpeer'd: matchles in mind and face, And all the vertues that her sex most grace. Who after twenty yeares scarce fully expird, Arriv'd at that safe port she most desird: In life, to friends and parents fresh joyes bringing: In death; to God sweet Halelujaes singing.

Himens blessing upon the same. Fælices ter &amp; Amplius quos Irrupta tenet Copula. I bring you Himens blessing, hearts intire, First warm'd, then kindled at his holy fire. The Grecian Ladies kept these nights to mirth Sacred, and from their marriage, not their birth Counted their age; This knot so doubly tyde May no disaster, or sad fate divide. May peace and love in all your lookes be read, A plentious table, and a fruitfull bed Be never wanting, jealousie and strife Be farre exil'd, that a contented life May sweeten all those houres that are t'ensue. Andas your Parents now rejoyce in you, May you in your blest Issue, and spread name, That when to them I kindle a new flame, As at this feast, where like occasions meet, Both Sires and Grandsires may be proud to see't. And this to many generations prove, As the best fruits of true conjugall love. To a vertuous Gentlewoman at the parting from her own Fathers house, to live with her husband at her Father-in-lawes. May it please you thinke I am the place which now You ready are to part from, which whilst you Were present, seem'd a paradise, and full Of all delights, but now growne sad, and dull. Me thinkes it stands, as by an Earthquake shaken, When it perceives it is by you forsaken, And though it selfe all mute and silent be, Thinke that it's Genius doth speake thus in me. Farewell sweet Lady; all the choise delights, The comforts of the day, the joy of nights, The friendly houres (the handmaides unto time.) The seasons: Winter, August, Summer, prime; By day, the cheerefull Sun; by night, the Moone, Sleepe or awake, at midnight, or at noone, Protect you: All things happen to you well, To please your eye, your eare, touch, taste, and smell. Where e're you walke, the ayre fresh breath bequeath you, The earth on which you tread, prove smooth beneath you. If stand, time stand still with you, or seeme slow; If move, may Angels wheresoe're you goe Attend you; or if sit; the chaire to ease you Prove soft, as Iunoes throne. If ride, to please you May your Caroch wheeles run as swift and faire, As Venus Chariot mounted in the ayre. If lye to rest, then gently may yee sleepe; Whom, He that made you sweet, as sweetly keepe. Your dreames be such; that waking, you may say Darknesse to me as pleasing was as day. So sleepe, so wake, so walke, so ride, so rest, With all contentments, treasur'd in your brest, Till this sad house, which now you leave, to mourne, May be made joyfull in your quick returne. A nuptiall song, devoted to the Celebration of a Marriage betwixt Master Iames, and Mistresse An. W. An Acrostick. I llustrious Himen, let this bridall feast A bound in plenty of all choice delights, M ake it a lasting Iubilee, not least E nnobled by thee; all their tedious nights S horten in pleasure; To their future dayes A dde length and light without eclipse or cloud, N o unkind breath betwixt them tempest raise, N o word be heard too silent, or too loud. A nd when the full time of her Issue growes, (W hich may they prove as numerous as blest) A wake Lucina to her painfull throwes, A nd summon Iuno to prepare her rest.

Pack clouds away, and welcome day, With night we banish sorrow: Sweet ayre blow soft, mount Larks aloft, To give my love good morrow. Wings from the wind to please her mind, Notes from the Larke Ile borrow: Bird prune thy wing, Nightingale sing, To give my love good morrow, To give my love good morrow, Notes from them both Ile borrow. Wake from thy nest Robin red brest, Sing birds in ev'ry furrow; And from each Bill let musick shrill Give my faire love good morrow. Blackbird and Thrush, in every bush, Stare, Linet, and Cock-sparrow: You pretty Elves, amongst your selves, Sing my faire love good morrow. To give my love good morrow, Sing Birds in every furrow.

Of Erasmus, pictured but from the girdle upwards. 2. Ingens ingentem, quem personat orbis, Erasmum, Hæc tibi dimidium picta tabella refert, &amp;c. This painted table to thy view, But halfe Erasmus lends. Of great Erasmus, whose loud fame Through the great world extends, But why not his whole portraiture? Cease Reader to complaine, He was so great that the vast earth His fame cannot containe. Of Lucrece. 3. Si fuit ille tibi Lucretia, gratus adulter, Immerito merita præmia morte petis, &amp;c. If to thy bed the adulterer welcome came, O Lucrece, then thy death deserves no fame. If force were offred, give true reason why, Being cleare thy selfe thou for his fault wouldst dye? Therefore in vaine thou seekst thy fame to cherish, Since mad thou fal'st, or for thy sinne dost perish. Vpon the Venetian History written by Petrus Bembus. 4. Claræ urbi Venetum, Debes natalia Bembe, vrbs eadem clara est munere Bembe tuo. O Bembus Venice in thy birth is fam'd, And in thy worth the Cities worth proclaim'd, Thou happy in that Citty, and agen, It happy to have thee a Citizen; Yet thou O Bembus by thy learned booke, Gav'st back more to it, than from it thou tooke. What thou receiv'st, was mortall, and must dy; What thou returnst, shall live eternally. Of Helionora the French Queene. 5. Nil Helena vidit Phœbus formosius una, Te regina nihil pulchrius orbis habet. Then Hellen Phœbus could no rarer view, Nor all the world a fairer yeeld than you. Both beautifull! yet you in this excell; She brocht dissention, discord you expell. Of Iohannes Secundus an excellent Poet of the Hage in Holland. 6. Excelsum seu condis opus magnique Maronis, luminibus offerre studes, &amp;c. If an high worke thou undertak'st; to rise In Virgils straine, and looke out with his eyes; Or if light Elegies art pleas'd to sing, Such as from Ovids veyne were knowne to spring; If to the ly'r of Pindarus thou fit Thy various notes, to make him blush at it; If thou make Belbulus his browes contort, To see how he in Epigrams can sport; These foure thou shalt excell: even thou alone Secundus, who art second unto none. Against Philenus who carpt at Erasmus. 7. Erasmus ille, quo fatentur plurimi, Nihil fuisse nec futurum doctius, &amp;c. Erasmus whom as many say, None shall or hath beene to this day More learned: yet to thee thou gull, Most stupid he appeares and dull, And what aspersions thou canst frame To calumnise his noble name, By thee or others are collected, In hope to make him disrespected. Barke still Philenus with the rest, Since 'tis apparant to the best, That learn'd Erasmus much more knew, Than is unknowne to all of you. To Lodovick Masurus of his verses made of the fall of Babylon. 8. Dum Masuri rudiore tonas Babylona ruentem, Cantata est quanta Troja nec ipsa tuba, &amp;c. Whilst Masurus thou with a lowder tongue Soundst Babels fall, then ever Troyes was song, Thou hast given cause Homer should thee envie, Or Maro (greater) that thou writ'st so hye, Yet Masurus one error may be found In thy brave worke for all its stentors sound, That in so great a verse thy fame pursuing Thou buildst for ever what thou striv'st to ruin.

Accipe Francisco cur componamus Homerum, Et Monachos, credo vatibus esse pares, &amp;c. Receive, why the Franciscan I compare To Homer: and thinke Monkes and Poets are Both like. Francis (we read of old) was blind, And so was Homer, as we written find; He of his eyes, the other in his mind. A begger Francis was, Homer was poore, And both sung Hymnes at every rich mans dore. The vast world both their rapsodies admires, From the one's Poets, from the others Friers. Poets at first in remote woods did dwell, The Monkes at first chus'd out the Cave and Cell. The Woods forsooke, the Monkes themselves betake Vnto the Townes, and Poets then forsake The Groves to live in Cities: Night and day The Poet sings, and so the Monke doth bray, And in their musick both alike delight. The Muse the wanton Poet doth accite, To have his Cinthia, and the shaven Frier Not one alone, but many doth desire. With water if the Poet chance to meet In stead of Wine, his verse comes off unsweet. And if unto the Monke you water bring When he would drinke, he will but sadly sing. The Poet when his Harpe's about him tyde, His pleasant notes most sweetly will divide: And so the Monke too will sound nothing dull, When as the Flagon at his girdle's full. Th' one in an Atheists fury doth exclaime, Th' other an Enthean rapture doth inflame, And still the Thyrsian favor he doth weare, As th' other crosses doth about him beare. The victor Poets Mirtles and Bayes renowne, And the Monkes honour is his shaven crowne. The excellent Poet George Buchanan, upon a Diamond cut like an Hart, and sent from Mary Queene of Scots, to the most excellent Lady Queene Elizabeth. Non me materies facit superbum, Quod ferro Insuperabilis quod igni, &amp;c. Not that my substance neither can be bow'd, Or flaw'd by fire or steele, doth make me proud, Nor clearnes wanting staine, not that I still Shine with perspicuous light, not th' Artists skill Who gave me forme, and cloath'd me thus in gold, That I might seeme more glorious to behold: But if in me appeare the least ostent, It is because I'am made to represent The heart of my sweet Mistresse, and so neare, That if the same Heart in her bosome were, With eyes to bee survey'd, more constant none, More cleare, more spotlesse could be look't upon, Both splenderous alike, and without staine, In all things equall, save there doth remaine A difference in our hardnesse: but to me A second favour's lent, a hope to see Of you Heroick Lady, the bright face: Then which there cannot bee a greater grace. Hope of which grace I almost was bereft, After I once had my deare mistresse left. O that my fate so much to me would daine, That I might in an adamantine chaine Linke your two hearts, in such a strong condition, As that no emulation, no suspition, Nor spleene, nor age, nor hate, could break asunder, So should I of all stones be held the wonder. So I more blest were than all stones by far, So I more bright were than all stones that are. So then all stones I were more deare indeed, As I in hardnesse doe all stones exceed. Of Chrisalus. Flava Ceres longi spes interceperat anni, Aruerat pigro vinea testa gelu. Graine the long yeares hope in the eare doth pine, The tedious frost doth pinch thy forward kine: Rot kills thy sheepe, theeves steale thy gotes; and now Thy labouring Oxen perish at the plow. Losse after losse when Chrisalus had found, And he himselfe unwilling to be found Alone: when his whole state was cras'd, bethought To hang himselfe so he might do't for nought. But soone that purpose in his mind was lost, When he considerd what a rope would cost, For he would die of free-cost: he thinks then To kill himselfe with a sharpe sword, but when He lookt about and saw none, nay saith he, To buy a sword were too much charge for me. Hee then saith to himselfe: doubtlesse that knave The Sexton expects something for my grave, And somewhat those that put me in my shroud, And somewhat must the bearers be allowd. The Priest, the candles, ringing of the bell: And prayers too, must cost somewhat I know well. Therefore to save all charges, this I say, Ile drowne my selfe, and that's the cheapest way. He did so, And thus speaking in his fall, See thus for nothing I discharge them all. In Romam. Non ego Romulea miror quòd pastor in urbe Sceptra gerat: pastor conditor urbis erat. I wonder not a Shepheard Rome should sway, A Shepheard Romes foundation first did lay, My wonder is since, Romulus the first That reard the same, was by a shee-wolfe nurst, That even to these dayes as we plainely see, So many raging Wolves in Rome should be. This onely doth my admiration breed, A Wolfe should keepe the fould, and the sheepe feed. An Epitaph upon Iacobus Sylvius. Silvius hic situs est gratis qui nil dedit unquam Mortuus, &amp; gratis quod legis ista dolet. Here Sylvius lies, who when he liv'd Gave nothing, and being dead, He yet laments, that what's writ here, For nothing should be read. Ex Angelo Politiano. Epigram In Pamphilum. Mittis vina mihi, mihi Pamphile vina supersunt, Vis mage, quod placeat mittere? mitte sitim. Thou sendst me wine O Pamphilus, I had enough at first. Wilt send me what shall better please? Then prethee send me thirst. Against Mabilius a bitter rayling Poet. Ore tibi pauci, sed nulli in carmine dentes quum sint, atque illi sunt putridi &amp; veteres, &amp;c. There be but few teeth in thy jawes, But in thy verse are none, And those thou hast be rotten, or Their use by age is gone. And though thou canst not bite at all, Yet barke thou dost meane space. Which showes thee (though in shape a man,) Yet of a dogged race. Ex Accij sinceri sannazarij Neopolitani viri patricij. Epigram. Of the admirable City Venice. Viderat Adriacis Venetam Neptunus in undis, Stare urbem &amp; toto ponere jura Mari, &amp;c. Neptune in th'Adriatick maine saw stand Venice whose power did all the Sea command, And saith, now Iove show thy Tarpeian Towers And walls of Mars, unto this scite, now ours. If thou before the mighty Ocean dare The petty River Tiber to compare, Behold both Cities there give up this doome, The Gods built Venice, Men erected Rome. Ex M. Anthonij Flamminij. Epigram. Of Cardinall Pooles Picture. Si velut egregia pictura maxime Pole, Est expressa tui corporis effigies, &amp;c. Great Poole, as in that excellent Table wee The picture of thy body plaine may see, So could one paint the beauty of thy mind, No rarer thing, we on the earth could find. Of a faire gilt Bowle sent unto him from Benedict Accoltus Cardinall. Hanc pateram Chio spumantem auroque nitentem Accoltus vati donat habere suo, &amp;c. This golden Cup swelling with Chios juyce, Given by Accoltus to his Poets use, Part of this wine Bacchus to thee I send, And part to thee Apollo, I commend. Now Muses take the Cup, and it brim-fill With Nectar, which may to my braine distill, That worthy thankes I may Accoltus give, In such high verse as may for ever live. Ex Mario Molsa. Of the City Rome being late wasted by the Germanes. Flagrati cineres si nunc Catilina videret, Imperij &amp; Latium consenuisse decus. Th' Empires burnt ashes didst thou now behold O Catiline, and her glory waxt so old, The Capitoll, and high Tarpeian spires, Couldst thou but view defac't by forraigne fires, Now coverd in long ruines, thou wouldst run, And loudly cry, This by the gods was done. For amongst mortall men, what's he once durst Doe this to Rome, which I had menac't first? O how much better had it beene that I Had beene the cause of all thy misery! Whil'st buried Rome from darknes thou dost strive To raise (O Blondus) and keepe still alive Dead Romulus and Remus: by thy wit, They a rude City did erect, but it Thy labour hath re-built, making it shine So to the world, tis almost held divine. And though the barbarous Foe it overthrew, Thy lasting verse, hath still repaird it new. A Tombe to thee, triumphant Rome did give, That it to thee, and thou to it maist live. Ex Antonio Titaldeo. An Epitaph upon Ioannes Mirandula. Ioannes jacet hic Mirandula, cætera norunt. Et Tagus &amp; Ganges, forsan &amp; Antipodes. Mirandula here tombed lies; Wouldst thou know more? aske these, Tagus and Ganges best knows, and Perhaps the Antipodes. Ex Benedicti Theocreni. Epigram. Upon a Comet which Lewes of Savoy saw a little before his death. In festum sibi cum sciret Ludovica Cometam, Seque peti: Illius crinibus horrificis, &amp;c. A bearded star when Lewes did espy, With horrible aspect his life to threat, Loe here, a Torch saith he that from on high Lights me to heaven, (his spirit was so great. Ex Ioanne secundo Hagiensi. Of one Charinus who had married a deformed wife. Nuper Charine conjugem, Vidi tuam, tam candidam, &amp;c. Charinus I beheld of late, Thy wife so sweet, so delicate, So faire, so chaste, so neat, so fine, That almost I could wish her mine. And if great Iove would give me three, In all respects but such as shee I two would unto Pluto grant, To take away that paravant. Ex Henrici Stephani Epigram. Of Phillis who was delivered within five moneths after her marriage. Ante legitimum statumque tempus, Cum puerpera facta Phillis est. Phillis late married as 'tis sed, Before her time was brought a bed; The noise of which, (to her disgrace) Was spoken of in every place. Which brought to her by one she knew, Who told her how such rumor grew, She smil'd, and thus excus'd the crime, The vulgar mis-compute the time: Nine moneths I know they will allow A teeming woman, and I now Exceed that limit; Five months hee Tis well knowne, hath beene wed to mee, So five moneths I to him have beene In wedlock joyn'd, then where's the sinne? Adde five moneths unto five, and then Who knowes not but they make up ten? Upon Pompe's death. Dux Pharia quamvis jacis Inhumatus arena, Non ideo fati est sævior ira tui, &amp;c. Though thou great Duke inhum'd dost lie Vpon the Pharian shore, Blame not the fates who thought thereby To honor thee the more. Vnworthy was the earth thy bones, Which thou subdude by force; Onely the Heavens, and they alone Were worthy of thy Coarse. Ex Ioanne Colta. Of the City Verona. Verona, qui te viderit, Et non amârit protinus Amore perditissimo, &amp;c. Verona whatsoere hee be, Who when he first shall looke on thee, It doth not his affection move To dote on thee with perdit love, I thinke he not himselfe respects; And that he wants true loves affects, His sences are not in good state, Nay all the graces he doth hate. Ex Petro Hembo. An Epitaph upon one Thebaldæus an excellent Musitian. Qui ripis te sæpe suis stupuere Canentem, Eridanus Tiberisque; parens ille, hic tuus Hospes, &amp;c. Eridanus and Tiberis flood, Who when upon their bankes thou stood, Admir'd thee singing (in one bred And by the other nurst and fed) Most credible it is that thou In the Elysian fields singst now, And mak'st such musicke with thy tongue, That all the Gods about thee throng. Ex Balt asser Castilione. An Epitaph upon a Virgin whose name was Gratia. Siste viator, dum properas hoc aspice marmor, Et lege, ni plores, tu quoque marmor eris, &amp;c. Stay Travailer, and looke upon This Marble ere thou part. Read here, and if thou dropst no teares, Thou likewise marble art. Sweet Grace is dead, for cruell death Takes both the faire and wise, (Alas the while) and here beneath This stone, intombed lyes, She both her sisters tooke along, So that we now may say All the three graces in her death Did perish in one day. Ex Antonio Casanova. Of Lucrece. Dicite, cum melius cadere ante Lucretia posset, Cur potius voluit post scelus illa mori. Why Lucrece better might her selfe have slaine Before the act, than after her black staine, Can any tell? no crime she did commit, For of all guilt, her hand did her acquit. Her ravisher she slew by that brave stroke, And from her Countries neck tooke off the yoke. From thine owne hand thy death most willing came, To save thy Country, and preserve thy fame. In praise of Archery. Brave Archery what rapture shall I raise, In giving thee thy merit, and due praise? Divine thou art, as from the Gods begot: Apollo with an arrow Python shot, And Cupid the faire Venus sonne we know Is alway figured with his shafts and Bow. The chaste Diana with her Nimphes in chase, Will with no other armes their shoulders grace. A mighty Bow the great Alcides drew, When he (to save his bride) the Centaur slew. It is the powerfull hand of Heaven that bends The all-coloured Rainbow that so farre extends, Before the Tormentary art was found, The jarring string did make the dreadfulst sound. And that invulner'd Greeke unskard, by steele Was shot, and slaine by Paris in the heele. The naked Indian doth on armor lack His bow being bent, and quiver at his back. And the wild Tartar doth no danger feare, His arrow nockt, and string drawne to his eare. The Parthian in this practise hath such skill, That when he flies he can shoot back and kill. For us; What forraigne Chronicles, but sing Our honours purchast by the Gray-goose wing? Brave Cordelion with a feathered band Beat the proud Soldan from the holy Land. O what an honour did the Black Prince gaine, When he with English Archers conquerd Spaine! So ancient, so divine, so nobly fam'd; (Yet for the bodies health there's nothing nam'd.) It is an exercise (by proofe) we see Whose practise doth with nature best agree. Obstructions from the liver it prevents, Stretching the Nerves and Arty'rs, gives extents To the spleenes oppilations, cleares the brest And spungy lungs: It is a foe profest To all consumptions: More, what need I name? The State approves it for a lawfull game. What woon our honour, is now made our sport, Witnes Poicteirs, Cressy, and Agincourt. Upon a Booke late published by one Bird a Coachman, calld Byrds businesse. Reader, who ere thou beest; approach man, And heare the Iornall of a Coachman, (In which he is not too prolix) Who with two Horses, foure, or six, If let him have a good Postillion, Shall drive with any for a Million. We read in Stories long agon, That there was one Automedon, Great Hectors Charioter, Another Who of the same trade was a brother Whom Archeptolemus men name, And hee, Achilles steeds did tame. These could their Horses turne, and wind, And check, and curb them to their mind, Wheeling with many a strange Meander, In the most famous field Scamander. I wonder Homer was so rash To praise those expert in the lash, But he was ignorant and blind, Who knew not Byrd should come behind. Who had he liv'd then; might King Rhemnon Have served, or great Agamemnon, And taught their Palphreyes how to draw, But they alas to him were raw. I must confesse they had the braines, In the day time to guide the raines, And in plaine ground to use the whip, And one another to outstrip. But this our Bird, although no Owle, His Horse is able to controule, And them to governe I dare say, (And guide) as well by night as day, As in his travels may appeare, Which largely are discoursed there. And though I know not how, or when, Yet all describ'd by his owne pen. In which to exceed so much he strives That whether he better writes or drives May well be questioned; Reader judge, Pay for thy Booke, and doe not grudge. And now if any question make In this worke he did undertake, Why he in number or in rime, Should so much faile? observe the time And place withall, where these were writ. And he no doubt will both remit. Neither doth it the Author, wrong, To make one verse short, the other long, As you may find oft in his booke, He suites them to the way he tooke. If any line against his will Goe lagging on: he drove up-hill. Againe: If any passe it's length, Downe hill he ran, and had not strength, Though take unto him all his force, Either to stop it, or his horse. I will appeale to all who use The trade, and they will that excuse. When he was driving in even way, The verse runs smooth (perceive you may) But being rough, then thinke he feeles Some deepe foule slough to clogge his wheeles. Here in his praise my sayle I strike, Let any Coachman doe the like. Against a base and infamous Balladder, who disperst a scandalous riming Libell, in which hee malitiously traduced the noble exercises weekely practised in the Artillery Garden. What mightst thou be I wonder? whose bald rime Thus railes against the vertues of our time, Of what birth? name? what nation? what degree? Since thou conceal'st these from the world and me, I will enquire: well-bred thou art not sure; No generous spirit could ever yet indure To heare a Souldier branded: Such love Armes, And grace the practise of our loud alarmes, Our quick and active postures they admire, Which teach us when to charge, and when retire. This proves thee borne out of some dunghill race, That nere durst looke a Souldier in the face. Then of what name? I'st so dark and obscure, Or else so blur'd, it dares not now indure The Sunne and Day? but Owle-like is it gone, And forfeited to night? or hast thou none? Or wast once good? let this afflict thee most, Thou art halfe hang'd, for thy good name is lost. Then of what Country? Didst thou never heare Of Talbot, Norris, Essex, Sidney, Vere? Or hast thou of our conquering Princes read, And durst affirme thou wert in England bred, Scotland or Ireland? Kingdomes, that still affoord Armes Nursery, and Souldiers of the sword? Sure th'art not French; unlesse thou wert begot In their disease, the pocks, and therefore not Sound in thy joynts, and that's the cause, thou here Rayl'st'gainst these Armes thou hast not limbs to beare. Then from what Country, nation? from what straine Canst thou derive thy being? not from Spaine, For all their prid's in Armes, a Souldiers name As the earths glory, at which most they ayme. To Italy for birth-right shouldst thou flye, Cæsar himselfe would give thee then the lye, With thousand valiant Romanes, and all sweare A Groome so base had never breeding there. So of all others; Nay thy impudent worke Would blush the very person of a Turke. Their Bashaes and their Ianisaries be Bold Leaders, and approv'd for Chivalree. Were not the Worthies Souldiers? (worthles slave,) A title that antiquity first gave, To eternize them; and others to aspire To the like height; That we might ours admire, As former ages them: For thy degree I cannot thinke how I may censure thee. Art thou a Citizen? and canst repine At practise of such needfull discipline? If so; thou art some bastard, and 'twere pitty But all like thee were spew'd out of the City. Thou art no Scholler; Arts and Armes conspire. Schollers praise Armes, we Souldiers Arts admire. Nay art thou Christian? that with rymes so vaine Durst taske the divine Pulpit? O prophane And irreligious wretch: good subject? No Such thou art not, whose obscene meeters flow To'th jangling Musick of each Fidlers string, 'Gainst that which Patrons Country, peace, and King. Since neither then good Subject, Christian; nor One that loves Arts; whom City doth abhor, And Country hath disclaim'd, one whom no clime But is asham'd to challenge, whose base ryme Hath forfeited his name, and obscure birth From every language, Nation, from all earth; I thus conclude. To which sound Drum and Fife He'hath lost his name, why should hee keepe his life? FINIS. I conclude this Worke, suiting with the present, concerning the worth of Physick, and Physitians, deriving my president from a worthy Gentleman called M. Perisaulus Faustinus. [There is a gift that's sacred, lent to man] There is a gift that's sacred, lent to man By God and Nature, by which Art he can Of all diseases know the perfect ground, And render the cras'd body, whole and sound. If this Art please thee then, whose hight to gaine Must be the labour of a polisht braine; Thou into Natures secrets must inquire, And (farre as humane wisedome can) aspire. From best approved Authours seeke direction, Till thou into all medcines hast inspection: And when thou shalt be frequent in all these, Thou shalt be held a new Hippocrates, Exceed Machaon, and Phillerides, With th' Epidaurian, godlike skill impart, And bright Apollo, Patron of that Art. Thou shalt be health to Nations, people save, And such as are expired, keep from grave. To animate the dead thou shalt have skill, 'Tis at thy pleasure whom to save or kill: Hence shall great sums of wealth to thee arise, With fame, and honour, such as never dyes. But as we see in diverse flowers and weeds, Where sweetnes is, thence bitternes proceeds, And from one stalke how many thousand ills From the same Lymbeck drop, that good distills, How many discommodities attend Vpon this Art, which all so much commend; On it, how many thousand labours waite, By turning over Bookes, earely and late, Assiduate study, with an infinite care, For all the sundry maladies that are, To provide wholesome medcines, how to please The sicke mans taste, and find th'unknowne disease, To know what hurts, what helps; his care being such Not to prescribe too little, nor too much. No night in which thou downe to rest shalt lye, But ere sleepe fastens on thy tender eye, Lowd at thy gate, some one or other knocks, As if he meant, to force both bolts and locks, Calls for the Doctor to get up in hast, The patient's ready to expire his last. His bowels ake, or he complaines his head, Tossing and tumbling on his restlesse bed, Still clamoring till he perforce must rise: Thus (be it night or day) in post he flies. He feeles his pulse, to know how slowe they beate, Then must he make conjecture from his sweate, And to find out where the disease doth dwell, Forc't sometimes at his chamber-pot to swell, Then Antidotes are suddenly prepard With Amulets, and Pills, made round and hard, Emplasters are to such a place applyde, Vnguents, and Salves to this or to that side. Suppositories, Clisters, fomentations, Pultesses, opening veines, boxing, frications, Electuaries, sweating, and what not? According to the Fever, cold or hot. He searcheth where the paine lyes most extreame, Whether it rise from Choler, or from flegme. The Megrim, Pleurisies, great or small Pox, The Measils, Wormes, the Scouring, or the Flocks. Consumption, Ptysick, Iaundies, black or yellow, Convulsion (or what scarce can find a fellow For suddaine killing) Squinsy in the throat, Obstructions, Dropsies: each disease of note Is knowne unto him how and whence it grows, The Ague, Cough, the Pyony, the Pose. Aches within, and accidents without, Strangurian, collick, Apoplex, the gowte, Ruptures, the fretting of the guts, the Stone, Who's troubled with the Spleene, who Liver-growne, Cramps, numnes in the joyntures, Inflamations; Swelling i'th secret parts, Impostumations, Warts, Blisters, Tumours, Pimples, Tetters, Wheales, Even Leprosie it selfe, his medcine heales. And yet when he hath used all his Art; If suddenly, the patient doe not start From his cras'd couch, and instantly head-strong, The vulgar murmur, and the Artist wrong, And say; who first begot this superstition, That the sick-man should seeke to the Physition? What madnes ist, their trifling Art to trust? If they could keepe themselves from being dust, And their owne bodies free from all disease, Not yeeld to death, when so the Parcæ please, As all else doe; I should approve their skills, And yeeld to taste their Potions and their Pills. Till then; I hold them made up of abuses, Meere cheating with their Cordials, and their Iuices. Thus, though they oft redeeme men from the grave; This, for their merit is the meed they have. To adde to these: the Doctor is still tyde Amongst sad folkes, and mourners to abide. Where nothing's heard but sighing for the sicke, And most contagious maladies raigne thicke, Nay, though the Plague, or pest it selfe be there, In him there must be found no cause of feare: Such are the hazards and the toyles we know, Best Artists still are forc't to undergoe.
