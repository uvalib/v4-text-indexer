      <field name="fulltext">Vol. I. Square brackets denote editorial insertions or emendations. The Turke and Gowin. Listen, lords great &amp; small, what aduentures did befall in England, where hath beene of knights that held the round table which were doughty &amp; profittable, of kempys cruell &amp; keene. All England both East &amp; west, lords &amp; ladyes of the best, they busked &amp; made them bowne, &amp; when the king sate in seate,— lords serued him att his meate,— into the hall a burne there cane: He was not hye, but he was broad, &amp; like a turke he was made both legg &amp; thye, &amp; said, “is there any will, as a brother, to giue a buffett &amp; take another, giff any soe hardy bee?” Then spake sir Kay, that crabbed knight, &amp; said “man, thou seemest not soe wight, if thou be not adread, for there beene knights within this hall with a buffett will garr thee fall, &amp; grope thee to the ground. “Giue thou be neuer soe stalworth of hand I shall bring thee to the ground, that dare I safely sweare.” then spake sir Gawaine, that worthy knight, saith, “cozen Kay, thou speakest not right, lewd is thy answere; “What &amp; that man want of his witt, then litle worshipp were to thee pitt if thou shold him forefore.” then spake the turke with word[e]s thraw, saith, “come the better of your tow though ye be breme as bore” [half a page missing.] “this buffett thou hast well quitt that it shall be, And yett I shall make thee 3??? as feard as euer was man on middlearth, this court againe ere thou see.” Then said Gawaine, “my truth I plight, I dare goe with thee full right, &amp; neuer from thee flye; I will neuer flee from noe aduenture, Iusting nor noe other turnament, whilest I may liue on lee.” The turke tooke leaue of King with crowne, Sir Gawaine made him ready bowne, his armor &amp; his steed. they rode northwards 2 dayes and more by then Sir Gawaine hungred sore, of meate &amp; drinke he had great need. The turke wist Gawaine had need of meate, &amp; spake to him with word[e]s great, hawtinge vppon hee; says “Gawaine, where is all thy plenty? yesterday thou wast serued with dainty, &amp; noe part thou wold giue me, “but with buffett thou did me sore; therefore thou shalt haue mickle care, &amp; aduentures shalt thou see. I wold I had king Arthur heere, &amp; many of thy fellowes in fere that behaues to try mastery.” He led Sir Gawaine to a hill soe plaine; the earth opened &amp; closed againe, then Gawaine was adread; the Merke was comen &amp; the light is gone; thundering, lightning, snow &amp; raine, therof enough they had. Then spake Sir Gawaine &amp; sighed sore, “such wether saw I neuer afore in noe stead where I haue beene stood” [half a page missing.] “ made them noe answere but only vnto mee.” To the Castle they then yode: Sir Gawaine light beside his steed, for horsse the turke had none; there they found chamber, bower, &amp; hall, richly rayled about with pale, seemly to look vppon; A Bord was spred within that place, all manner of meates &amp; drinkes there was for groomes that might it againe: Sir Gawaine wold haue fallen to that fare, the turke bad him leaue for care; then waxt he vnfaine; Gawaine said, “man, I maruell haue that thou may none of these v[i]ttells spare, &amp; here is soo great plentye; yett haue I more mervaile, by my fay, that I see neither man nor maid, woman nor child soe free; “I had leuer now att mine owne will of this fayre meate to eate my fill then all the gold in christenty.” the turke went forth, &amp; tarryed nought; Meate &amp; drinke he forth brought, was seemly for to see; He said, “eate, Gawaine, &amp; make thee yare, infaith or thou gett victalls more thou shalt both swinke &amp; sweat; eate, Gawaine, &amp; spare thee nought!” Sir Gawaine eate as him good thought, &amp; well he liked his meate; He dranke ale, &amp; after, wine, he saith, “I will be att thy bidding baine without bost or threat; but one thing I wold thee pray, giue me my buffett &amp; let me goe my way, I wold not longer be hereatt. [half a page missing.] There stood a bote and Sir Gawaine left behind his steed, he might noe other doe. The turke said to Sir Gawaine, “he shalbe here when thou comes againe,— I plight my troth to thee,— within an hower, as men tell me.” they were sailed over the sea; the turke said, “Gawaine, hee! “Heere are we withouten scath; but now beginneth the great othe. when he shall aduentures doe.” he lett him see a castle faire, such a one he neuer saw yare, noe wher in noe country. The turke said to Sir Gawaine “yonder dwells the King of Man, a heathen soldan is hee, “With him he hath a hideous rout of giants strong &amp; stout &amp; vglie to looke vppon; who-so-euer had sought farr &amp; neere as wide as the world were, such a companye he cold find none. “Many auentures thou shalt see there, such as thou neuer saw yare in all the world about: thou shalt see a tenisse ball that neuer knight in Arthurs hall is able to giue it a lout; &amp; other aduentures there are moe: wee shall be assayled ere we goe, therof haue thou noe doute; “But &amp; yee will take to me good heed, I shall helpe you in time of need; for ought I can see there shall be none soe strong in stower but I shall bring thee againe to hi [half a page missing.] “Sir Gawaine stiffe &amp; stowre, how fareth thy vnckle King Arthur, &amp; all his company, &amp; that Bishopp Sir Bodwine that will not let my goods alone, but spiteth them euery day? “He preached much of a crowne of thorne; he shall ban the time that he was borne &amp; euer I catch him may; I anger more att the spiritually in England nor att the temporaltie, they goe soe in theire array; And I purpose in full great ire to brenn their clergy in a fire &amp; punish them to my pay: sitt downe, Sir Gawaine, at the bord.” Sir Gawaine answered at that word, saith, “nay, that may not be, “I trow not a venturous knight shall sitt downe in a kings hall aduentures or you see.” the King said, “Gawaine, faire mot then fall! goe feitch me forth my tennisse ball; for play will I and see.” They brought it out with-out doubt; with it came a hideous rout of Gyants great &amp; plenty; all the giants were there then heire by the halfe then Sir Gawaine, I tell you withouten nay. There were 17 giants bold of blood, &amp; all thought Gawaine but litle good. when they thought with him to play, all the giants thoughten then to haue strucke out Sir Gawaines braine. help him god that best may! The ball of brasse was made for the giants hand, There was noe man in all england were able to carry it [half a page missing.] and sticked a giant in the hall that grysly can hee grone. The King sayd, “bray away this axeltree, for such a boy I neuer see; yett he shalbe assayd better ere he goe; “I told you, soe Mote I tho, with the 3 aduenture, &amp; then no more befor me at this tide.” Then there stood amongst them all a chimney in they Kings hall with barres mickle of pride; there was laid on in that stond coales &amp; wood that cost a pound, that vpon it did abide. A giant bad gawaine assay, &amp; said, “Gawaine, begin the play! thou knowest best how it shold be; &amp; afterwards when thou hast done, I trow you shalbe answered soone either with boy or me. A great giant, I vnderstand, lift vp the chimney with his hand &amp; sett it downe againe fairly.” Sir Gawaine was neuer soe adread sith he was man on midle earth, &amp; cryd on god in his thought. Gawaine vnto his boy can say “lift this chimney—if you may— that is soe worthily wrought.” Gawaines boy to it did leape, &amp; gatt itt by the bowles great, &amp; about his head he it flang; 3?? about his head he it swang that the coals &amp; the red brands [half a page missing.] saw of mickle might &amp; strong were in battell. “I haue slaine them thorrow my mastery, &amp; now, Gawaine, I will slay thee, &amp; then I haue slaine all the flower; there went neuer none againe no tale to tell, nor more shalt thou, thoe thou be fell, nor none that longeth to King Arthur.” The turke was clad inuissible gay, no man cold see him withouten nay, he was cladd in such a weede; he heard their talking lesse &amp; more, &amp; yet he thought they shold find him there when they shold do that deed. Then he led him into steddie werhas was a boyling leade, &amp; welling vppon hie: &amp; before it a giant did stand with an Iron forke in his hand that hideous was to see. The giant that looked soe keene that before Sir Gawaine had neuer seene noe where in noe country: the King saide to the giant thoe, “here is none but wee tow; let see how best may bee.” when the giant saw Gawaines boy there was, he leapt &amp; threw, &amp; cryed “alas that he came in that stead!” Sir Gawaines boy to him lept, &amp; with strenght vp him gett, &amp; cast him in the lead; with an Iron forke made of steele he held him downe wondorous weele till he was scalded to the dead. then Sir Gawaine vnto the King can say, “with-out thou wilt agree vnto our law, eatein is all thy bread.” The King spitt on Gawaine the knight: with that the turke hent him vpright &amp; into the fyer him flang, &amp; saide to Sir Gawaine at the last, “Noe force, Master, all the perill is past! thinke not we tarrie too longe,” [half a page missing.] he tooke forth a bason of gold as an Emperour washe shold, as fell for his degree: He tooke a sword of Mettle free, saies “if euer I did any thing for thee, doe for me in this stead; take here this sword of steele that in battell will bite weele, therwith strike of my head.” “that I forefend!” said Sir Gawaine, “for I wold not haue thee slaine for all the gold soe red.” “haue done, Sir Gawaine, I haue no dread, but in this bason let me bleed that standeth here in this steed, “And thou shalt see a new play, with helpe of Mary that mild mayd that saued vs from all dread.” he drew forth the brand of steele that in battell bite wold weele, &amp; there stroke of his head. And when the blood in the bason light, he stood vp a stalwortht Knight that day, I vndertake, &amp; song “Te deum laudam[u]s, worshipp be to our lord Iesus that saued vs from all wracke! “A! Sir Gawaine! blesed thou be! for all the service I haue don thee, thou hast well quitt it me.” then he tooke him by the hand, &amp; many a worthy man they fand that before they neue[r] see. He said, “Sir Gawaine, withouten threat sitt downe boldly at thy meate, &amp; I will eate with thee; Ladyes all, be of good cheere, eche ane shall wend to his owne deer in all hast that may be; “first we will to King Arthurs hall, &amp; soone after your husbands send we shall in country where they beene; There they wold abide [half a page missing.] “Thus we haue brought 17 ladys cleere that there were left in great danger, &amp; we haue brought them out.” then sent they for theire husbands swithe, &amp; euery one tooke his oune wife, &amp; lowlye can they lowte, And thanked the 2 knights &amp; the King, &amp; said thé wold be at theire bidding in all england about. Sir Gromer kneeld vpon his knee, saith “Sir King, and your wilbe, crowne Gawaine King of man.” Sir Gawaine kneeled downe by, &amp; said “lord, nay, not I; giue it him, for he it wan, “for I neuer purposed to be noe King, neuer in all my liuinge, whilest I am a liuing man.” he said, “Sir Gromer, take it thee, for Gawaine will neuer King bee for no craft that I can.” Thus endeth the tale that I of meane, of Arthur &amp; his knight[e]s keene that hardy were &amp; free. god give them good life far &amp; neere that such talking loues to heere! Amen for Charity! ffins. Sir Lambewell. [The 1st parte.] Doughty in king Arthures dayes when Brittaine was holden in noblenesse, and in his time a long while he soiourned in merry Carlile. with him he had many an heire as he had else many a whide where; Of his round table they were Knights all, &amp; thé had much Mirth in bower &amp; hall; in euery Land of the world wide thé came to the court on every side, both yonge knights &amp; Squires eke, all thé came to the courte to seeke. &amp; with him there longed a bold bachelor, &amp; soe he did many a yeere, a yonge Knight of much might, Sir Lambewell forsooth he hight, and euer he spent worthilye, &amp; he gaue gifts that were larglie; [soe largely] his good he spent, much more than euer he had rent, &amp; soe outragiouslie he it sett that he became far in debt. and when he saw that all was gone, then hee begunn to make great moane, “alacke!” he said, “noe goods I haue; I know not how to doe, soe god me saue, &amp; I can neither begg nor borrowe! thus I am brought far in sorrow, &amp; I am far in a strange land, &amp; haue noe goods, as I vnderstand. of all these Knights that are soe feirce of the round table, which are my peeres, eche one to haue me they were glad, &amp; now for me thé wilbe sad; both Sir Huon &amp; Sir Gaion, Some time of me that you were faine; ffarwell Sir Kay, that crabbed Knight! farwell Sir Perciuall the wight! of my companie that thou was faine, the good Knight Sir Agrauaine! farwell Sir Garrett &amp; Sir Griffine, of my company that thou was faine! ffarwell the Knight Sir Iron side! of my company thou had much pride, ffor my expence &amp; noble wray, &amp; the rich gifts that I gaue aye! Certes you shall me neue[r] see; ffarwell, I take my leaue of you as a single batchlour without blame, where before I bare a good name.” then he leaped vppon a fresh courser without page or any squier, &amp; tooke his way towards the west, betweene the water &amp; a faire fforrest. the sun was at the [even-tide], the Knight light downe, &amp; thought to abide, &amp; layd him downe, the knight free, vnder the shadow of a tree; and what for Weeping much &amp; warle, a-sleepe I-wis this Knight fell, &amp; what for sobbing &amp; greet. when he wakned, vp he him sett, and then he looked afore him tho: out of a fforrest came Maydens tow, towards Sir Lambewell they did grow; ffairer befor he neuer sawe. Mantles they had of Red veluett fringed with gold full well sett, &amp; kirtles of purple sandall, they were small laced, &amp; fitted well; they were tyred aboue over all, &amp; either of them had a ffresh color, they had faces as white as snowdowne, they had loue-some color &amp; eyen Browne; &amp; one of them had a gold Bason, &amp; the other a towell of silke fine. towards Lamewell drew these maids twaine: the Knight was curteous, and rose them againe; thé said, “god speede thee, thou Knight free, there as thou lyest full of pouirty!” “damsell,” saies Lamwell, “welcome to mee!” “Sir,” quoth the one, “well may thou bee! My Lady thats bright as blossome or flower, thee greets, Sir Lamwell, as her paramoure, &amp; prays you for to speake with her &amp; if it be your will, faire Sir.” Lamwell answered them both there, “&amp; I am faine with you to fare, for which way soeuer your gate lies, I deeme certaine be paradice, for fairer maids then you tow bee I neuer saw moue with mine eye.” thé thanked Lambwell, that Knight Curteous, for giuing them soo great a praise: “but shee as much fairer then wee are seene, &amp; ouer vs might be a queene, her bewtie passeth vs as far as betweene the flower &amp; the steale.” they washed their hands &amp; face alsoe, &amp; forth with those maids the Knight did goe. within that forrest thé did see a rich pauillion pight full hee, &amp; euery pomell of the pauillion was well worth a 100 pound: vpon the topp a gripe stood, of shining gold, fine &amp; good; in his mouth he bare a carbunckle bright, like the moone it shines euery night; King Alexander the conquerour, nor Salamon in his most honour, nor Charlemount the rich King, they neuer welded such a thing. for sooth there was in that pauillion the Kings daugter of Million; in that pauillion was a bed of price that was couered ore with goodlie vice, &amp; therein sate a lady bright, from the Middle shee was naked vpright, and all her cloathing by her lay; ffull seemlie shee sate, I say, all in a mantle of white Ermines was fringed about with gold fine. her mantle downe for heat shee did full right vnto her girdle steed; shee was as white as lilly in may, or snow that falls on winters day; the blossome, nor the bryar, nor noe Kind of f[lower,] it hath noe hue vnto her color; [and the red] Rose when it is new, to her rednesse hath noe hue, for it shone Like the gold wyer; yett noe man can tell of her attyre. when of her had had a sight, downe of his knees then fell the Knight, &amp; saluted her with mild steuen as though that shee had come from heauen, &amp; spake to her when he had space, “I put me, lady, into your grace.” “Sir Lambewell,” shee said, “my harts sweete, for thy loue my hart I leete, &amp; theres noe King nor emperour— but &amp; if I loued him paramour as much, Sir Lambewell, as I doe thee,— he wold be right glad of me.” he sett him downe the lady beside, “Lady,” he saies, “what-ere betide, both early &amp; late, loud &amp; still, command [me] ready at your will! but as helpe me god, my lady deere, I am a knight without hawere; I haue noe goods noe more, nor men, to maintaine this estate I find your in.” then said that Lady, “I doe you soe kind, I know thy estate first &amp; end. &amp; thou wilt trustilie to mee take, &amp; for my loue all other forsake, then I will maintaine thine honour with gold, with siluer, &amp; with rich treasure, &amp; with euery man thou shalt spend larglie, &amp; I will giue thee great plentie.” then of that profer he was full blithe, &amp; thanked this lady often sithe; he obaid him vnto her there, he list this lady that was soe faire, &amp; by that Lady downe him sett, &amp; bad her maides downe meat fet, &amp; to there hands watter cleer, for then shee wold vnto supper: there was meate &amp; drinke, great plentie, of euery thing that was daintye. when they had eaten &amp; druken both, then to her bed this lady wold goe. Sir Lambwell, like a hailow Knight, by her bedside stood vp full right, said, “you displease, that wold I nought, but Iesus leeue, you knew my thought.” then spake that Lady free, saies, “vndight thee, Lambewell, &amp; come to me.” then was Lambwell soone vndight, &amp; in bed with this Lady bright, &amp; did all that night lye there, &amp; did whatsoeuer their wills were;— for play thé slept but litle that Knight till it began to be daylight.— &amp; when the daylight was comen, tho shee said, “Rise, Lambewell, &amp; now goe! gold &amp; siluer take inoughe with thee, &amp; with euery man thoust spend larglie; &amp; more thou spendest, meryer thoust sitt, &amp; I will send thee innoughe of it; but one thing, Knight, I thee forefendant, that of mee thou neuer auant; for &amp; thou doe, I tell thee before, for euer thou hast my loue forlore. &amp; when thou wilst, thou gentle Knight, speake with me by day or night, into some secrett place look you goe, &amp; thinke vppon me soe &amp; soe, &amp; shortly I will with you bee, not a man saue you that shall me see.” a maid brought him his horsse anon; hee took his leaue, &amp; leapeth vppon; “ffarewell my hony, farwell my s[weete!]” “farewell, Sir Lambwell, till oft we meete!” of treasure then he had great plentie, &amp; thus he ryds thorrowout the cittye. while he came there he shold have beene, a merryer man they neere had seene; now Lambwell he makes rich feasts, Lambewell feeds minstrelsie their Iests, Lambwell rewards religious, Lambewell helpes euery poore howse; were it Knight, squier, or swaine, with his goods he helpeth them; of his largnesse euery man wotts, but noe man witts how he itt gotts. alwayes when he lyed priuy &amp; still, his lady was ready at his will; but well happy were the man that in these dayes had such a one! The 2?: parte. Soe vppon a day Sir Gawaine the gentle knight, &amp; Sir Haion, Sir Lambewell with them alsoe, &amp; other knights 20 &amp; moe, went for to play them on a greene vnderneth the tower where lay the queene. these knights on there game plaid thoe, but sithe to dancinge they wold goe; Sir Lambell he was before sett, for his large spending they loued him best; the queene in a bower beheld them all, &amp; saies “yonder is Large Lambwell! of all the knights that be there, there is none soe faire a bachlour, &amp; he hath neither lemman nor wiffe; I wold he loued me as his life! betide me well, betide me ill, I shall,” shee said, “goe witt his will.” shee took with her a companie of damsells that were right pretty, &amp; downe shee goes anon-wright for to goe dance with a knight; &amp; shee went to the first end between Gawaine &amp; Lambwell the hend, &amp; all the maids soe forth right, one &amp; one, betweene 2 knights. &amp; when this dancing did aslake, the queene Sir Lambwell to councell did take: “Lambwell,” shee saies, “thou gentle Knight, I haue loued thee, &amp; doe with all my might, and as much desire I thee as Arthur that Knight soe free; good hap is now to thee tane, that thou wilt loue me &amp; noe other woman.” he saies, “Madam, noe, certez I wilbe noe traitor neuer in all my daies, for I owe my king fealtie &amp; homage, &amp; I will neuer doe him that damage.” she said, “fie vpon thee, faint Coward! dastard harllott as thou art! that thou liuest, it is great pitye, thou louest noe woman, nor noe woman loues thee! he said, “Madadam, say yee your will, but I can loue both lowde &amp; still, &amp; I am loued with my lemman, that fairer hath noe gentleman, nor none soe faire, yett say I, neither mayd nor yett Lady. the simplest maiden with her, I weene, ouer you, Madame, may be queene.” then she was ashamed &amp; full wroth; shee clippeth her mayds, &amp; forth goeth; to Chamber shee wold all heavye, for teene &amp; anger shee wold die. then King Arthur came from hunting, glad &amp; merry for all thing; to the queenes Chamber gone is hee; &amp; then she fell downe vpon her knee, &amp; fast, lord, that shee did crye, “helpe me, Lord, or euer I dye! without might I shall die this yenders night. I spake to Sir Lambwell in my game, &amp; he desired my body of shame; as a false villane traitor he wold haue done my body dishonor, and when I wold not to him aply, he shamefully rebuked me, &amp; of [his] Lemman praisment he made, ‘that the lowest maiden that shee had might be a queene over mee;’ &amp; all, Lord, was in despight of thee.” the King therwith he waxed wroth, &amp; for anger he sware an oathe that Lambwell shold abide the law, peradventure both to hang &amp; draw, &amp; he commanded 4 knights to feitch the traitor to his sight. theese 4 knights seeken him anon, &amp; to his chamber he is gone; “alacke,” he sayd, “now my life is lorne hereof shee warned me be-forne, of all things that I did vse, of her I shold neuer make my rowze.” he clipped, hee called, he her besought, but all availed him of nought; he sorrowed &amp; he did cry, &amp; on his knees besought her mercy, “O my Lady, my gentle creature, how shall my wreched liffe endure? my worldlie blisse I haue forlorne, &amp; falslie to my lady forsworne!” for sorrow &amp; care he made that stond, he fell in soonde to the ground; soe long he lay that they Knights came, &amp; in his chamber tooke him then, &amp; like a theefe they led him then,— thus was his sorrow, weale &amp; woe,— thé brought [the] Knight before the Kinge, &amp; this he said at his comminge: “thou false &amp; vntrue traitor! thou besought my wife of dishonor! that shee was lothlier, thou her vpbraid, then was thy Lemmans lodlyest maid.” Sir Lambewell answerd with Mild moode, &amp; tooke himselfe sworne by the roode, “that it was noe otherwise but soe, &amp; that my selfe will make good thoe; &amp; therto ouer your court Looke.” 12 knights were d[r]iuen to a booke the sooth to say in that case altogether as it was. these 12 knights, as I weene, thé know the rule of the queene, although the King were bold &amp; stout, that shee was wicked out &amp; out, but shee had such a comfort to have Lemmans vnder her Lord; therfore thé accquitt the trewman; but sithe thé spake forth then, for why that he is lemman bring wherby he made his aduanting, and alsoe that he proue in place that her maids fairer was, &amp; alsoe more bright &amp; sheene, &amp; of more beutye then the queene, &amp; alsoe countenance &amp; hue, they wold quitt him as good &amp; trew; &amp; if he might not stand ther till, he shold abide the Kinges will. this verditt was giuen before the King, The day was sett [pared off by the binder] sureties he found to come againe, both Sir Gawaine &amp; Sir Hayon; “alacke,” he said, “now my life is lorne! herof shee warned [me] beforne, of all things that I did vse, of her that I shold neuer make rowze.” he cleped, hee called, he her besought, but all avayled him of nought; he bent his body &amp; his head eke, he curst his mouth that of her did speake, and thus he was with sorrow Num, he wold his ending day were come that he might from his life goe. eche man for him was full woe, for a large[r] spender then hee neuer came in that countrye, &amp; thereto he was feirce &amp; bold, none better in the Kings houshold. the day was come of his appearing, thé brought the Knight afore the King: his barons that his surties was, they brought him forth, alas! the King let it be rehersed there, both the plaintiffe &amp; the answere; the King bad him bring his lemman in sight: he answered that he ne might, “but this I say to you alone, a fairer than shee was neuer none, both of bewtye &amp; of shape; I am to simple to tuch her lappe or yett to come vnto her bower, eccept it were for her pleasure, not displeasing her sickerlie, yet wold I you saw her ere I dye.” “bring her forth,” the King sayes, “that thou dost now soe fast praise, to prooue the sooth that thou sayst of.” “forsooth, my Lord, that can I nought.” then sayd the King anon thoe, “fforsooth thy disworshipp is the more; what may wee all know therby but that thou lyest loud &amp; hye?” he bade the barons giue Iudgment. the Barons answered verament, “to it, Lord, wee will gone, wee will to it soone &amp; anon.” &amp; then bespake the Erle of cornwayle who was one of the councell, &amp; say[d], “wee know thee King our Lord, hees owne mouth beares record, the wich by his owne assent hath-the g[i]uen the Knight Iudgment; therefore, &amp; we shold by the law, Lambewell shold both hang &amp; draw; but villany it were to eche of vs one to let vs fordoe soe a noble man, or yett soe doughtie a bachlour amongst vs all had neuer peere, &amp; therfore say by our reede wee will the King such way leade that he shalbe commanded to goe, &amp; void the court for evermore.” &amp; while they stood thus speaking, they saw 2 Ladyes come ryding vpon 2 ambling palfrayes, much fairer then the summers dayes, &amp; they were clothed in rich atire, that euery man had great desire. Them espied Gawaine the gentle Knight, “Lamwell,” he said, “dread for noe wight; yonder comes thy life, yond maist thou see; the loue of thee, I wott, is shee.” Lambewell beholds them with much thought, &amp; said, “alacke, I know them nought! My lady is much fairer certainlie.” when they came Sir Lambwell by, not tarrying with him thé yode, but to the King both thé rode, &amp; said, “thou Lord of worshipp, Arthur, lett dresse thy halls &amp; thy bowers both by ground, roofe, &amp; wall, with clothes of gold rich ouer all; it must be done att device; heere comes our Lady of much price; shee comes to you, as I weene; before yee, my lord, shee shalbe seene.” thé commanded for her sake the fairest chamber to them to take. the Ladyes are gone to bower on hye; the King bade his barronrye haue done, &amp; giue their iudgment. the Barons were att verament, “wee haue beholden this maiden bright, &amp; yee haue letted vs by this light, but to it, Lord, we will gone, wee will haue done soone &amp; anon.” a new speech they began thoe, some said “well,” &amp; some said “not soe,” some to death wold him deeme for to please the King &amp; queene; &amp; other some wold make him cleere. whilest they stood pleading in feare, the whilest thé stood thus speaking, other tow Ladies came ryding vppon tow goodly mules of Spaine, they had sadles, &amp; bridles were champaind; they were clothed in rich attire, that euery man had great desire ffor to behold their gentryes; they came in oft soe rich a wise. them espyed Huon the hind; “Lambewell,” he said, “my brother &amp; freind, yond comes thy life, yond may thou see; the tone of these, I wott, is shee, ffor fairer then shee there may be none; if it be not shee, choose thee none.” Lambwell beholds them both I-wis, &amp; said, “of them 2 none it is; My Lady is much fairer certainly, but of her servants they may be.” these Ladies that thus came ryding rode to the Castle to the King, &amp; when thé came it Lamwell by, baysance thé made certainly; not tarrying with him thé made, but to the King both thé rode, and thé said, “you Lord of worshipp, Arthur, let dresse thy halls &amp; bowers by ground, by roofe, &amp; by wall; with clothes of gold hang it all, &amp; cleath thy carpetts vnder her ffeete, [] it must be done at device, for heere comes our lady of much price.” Much sorrow had dame Geneuer when shee saw the ladies color; then shee trowed of some guile that Lamwell shold be holpen within a while by his ladye that was coming. fast shee cryed vpon the King, &amp; said, “lord, if thou loue thine honour, avenge me on this traitor!” To hang Lambwell shee wold not spare, “your barons make you not to care; without you him sloe without more, I shall die my-self before.” he bad his barons giue iudgment, “or I will my-selfe, by mary gent.” “we will him doome, Sir, soone anon!” to tell they tale they once began: The 3?: parte. “My lord, thus for-sooth agreed are wee.” “peace,” said Sir Haion, “noe more say yee, ffor yonder I see her come rydinge on whome Sir Lambwell made his auanting, a damsell by her selfe alone, on earth was fairer neuer none,— vpon a fresh ambling palfray,— much fairer then the summers day; her eyes beene blossomed cleere &amp; faire, Iolly &amp; Iocund as the faulconer or the Iay that sitts on a bough; of all things she is faire enoughe; lord! shees a louely creature, &amp; rides thus att her pleasure.” a sparhawk shee had on her hand, a softly pace her palfray sand, 3 white greyhounds running her by, as well beseemed for such a lady; she had a crowne vppon her head of precious stones &amp; gold soe red. wife &amp; child, yonge &amp; old, all came this lady to beholde, &amp; all still vppon her gazinge as people that behold the sacring; &amp; all they stood still in their study, &amp; yet they thought them neuer weary, for there was neuer man nor woman that might be weary of this ladies sight. as soone as Sir Lambwell did her see, on all the people cryed hee “yond comes my life &amp; my likinge! shee comes that me out of baile shall bring! yond comes my lemman, I make you sure; treulie shee is the fairest creature that euer man see before; indeed, looke where shee rydes vppon her steed!” This Lady when shee came thus ryding, rode to the castle to the King; the Knight there his owne worshipp did, he rose vp, &amp; he gaue her the steed, &amp; louely he can her greete, &amp; shee againe with words sweete. the queene &amp; other Ladyes stout behold her comlye round about, and there thé sate as dummbe as the moone is light from the sunn. then shee said to the King, “hither am I come for such a thing: my trew lemman Sir Lambewell is Challenged, as I heere tell, how that he shold with villanie beseech the queene of adoutry. that is false to bleeue, Sir King; he bade not her, for shee bade him; if he had desired her, with-out let not a foot hither I wold haue sett; you may beleeue me, euery word; that this is right, I will make good; &amp; for the other praisment that he made, that mine owne Lowtest mayd was mor of beawtye then thy queene, let the proofe, Sir, soone be seene.” the King said, “verament, Barrons, heere shall be noe iudgment, but I my selfe the same will deeme both of the queene &amp; of the Mayden; if I doe not right, then you may say but Sir Lambwell quoth the knight “I will loue him with all my might both in place &amp; in stead much better then euer I did.” &amp; when shee heard him soe say, she leaped on her palfray &amp; obayd her to the King soe hind, &amp; tooke leaue away to wend. then of all that while to Sir Lambwell shee wold not speake nor looke neuer soe deale; but wott you well, sorry was hee, befor her he fell on his knee, &amp; said, “Madam! trespassed I haue, &amp; I am come of your mercy to craue! I k[n]ouledge me of that wicked deed that was forbidden me when you yode; I am well worthy therfor to hange, or leade my life in paines strange; what pennance, Lady, you will to me say or you depart from me away, Lady, I desire noe more of thee but once aside to looke on me! My lord the King, of soe high a prow, for all the service I haue done you, one good word for me to speake! &amp; all my fellowes, I you beseeke, with the King pray you alsoe of her good word; I aske no moe.” ffor that they saw he mad such mone, they King &amp; thé prayd, euery one; but for all that euer he cold doe, not a word shee wold speake him too, but obayd her to the King soe hind, &amp; tooke her leaue away to wend. then Lambewell saw that shee wold fare, his owne hart he tooke to him there; when shee turned her horse to haue gone, he leaped vpon soone anon, vpon her palfray; what-soeuer betide, behind her he wold not abide; &amp; he said, “Madam, with reason &amp; skill now goe which way soe-ere you will, for when you light downe, I shall stand, &amp; when you ryd, all at your hande, &amp; whether it be for waile or woe I will neuer depart you froe.” Lord: of Learne It was the worthy Lord of learen, he was a lord of a hie degree; he had noe more children but one sonne, he sett him to schoole to learne curtesie. learing did soe proceed with that child— I tell you all in veretie— he learned more vpon one day then other children did on 3: &amp; then bespake the Schoole Master, vnto the Lord of Learne said hee, “I thinke thou be some stranger borne, for the holy gost remaines with thee.” he said, “I am noe stranger borne, forsooth, Master, I tell it to thee, it is a gift of almighty god which he hath giuen vnto mee.” the schooleMaster turnd him round about, his angry mind he thought to asswage, for the child cold answer him soe quicklie, &amp; was of soe tender yeere of agee. the Child, he caused a steed to be brought, a golden bridle done him vpon; he tooke his leaue of his schoolfellows, &amp; home the Child that he is gone. &amp; when he came before his father, he ffell low downe vpon his knee, “my blessing, father, I wold aske, if christ wold grant you wold giue it me.” “Now god thee blesse, my sonne &amp; my heire, his servant in heauen that thou may bee! what tydings hast thou brought me, child? thou art comen home so soone to mee.” “good tydings, father, I haue you brought, Goo[d tydings] I hope it is [?] to mee, the booke is not in all S[c]ottlande but I can reade it before your eye.” a Ioyed man his father was, euen the worthy Lord of Learne, “thou shalt goe into ffrance, my Child, to learne the speeches of all strange lands.” but then bespake the Child his mother,— the Lady of learne &amp; then was shee,— saies, “who must be his well good guide when he goes into that strange country?” &amp; then bespake that bonnie Child vntill his father tenderlie, saies, “father, Ile haue the hend Steward, for he hath beene true to you &amp; mee.” the Lady to concell the steward did take, &amp; counted downe a 100??: there, saies, “steward, be true to my sonne &amp; my heire, &amp; I will giue thee mickle mere.” “If I be not true to my Master,” he said, “Christ himselfe be not trew to mee! if I be not true to my lord &amp; Master, an ill death that I may die!” the Lord of Learne did apparell his Child with Bruche, &amp; ringe, &amp; many a thinge; the apparrell he had his body vppon, thé say was worth a Squiers liuinge. the parting of the younge Lord of Learne with his ffather, his mother, his ffellows deere, wold haue made a manis hart for to change, if a Iew borne that he were. the wind did serue, &amp; thé did sayle over the sea into ffrance Land: he vsed the Child soe hardlie, he wold let him haue neuer a penny to spend, and meate he wold let the Child haue none, nor mony to buy none trulie; the boy was hungry &amp; thirsty both; alas! it was the more pitty. he laid him downe to drinke the water that was soe low beneathe the brimn; he was wont to haue drunke both ale &amp; wine, then was faine of the water soe thinne; &amp; as he was drinking of the water that ran soe low beneath the brime, soe ready was the false steward to drowne the bonny boy therin. “haue Mercy on me, worthy steward! my life,” he said, “lend it to mee! &amp; all that I am heire vpon” saies, “I will giue vnto thee.” Mercy to him the steward did take, &amp; pulld the child out of the brime; euen, alacke! the more pittye! he tooke his clothes euen from him; saies, “doe thou me of that veluett gowne, the crimson hose beneath thy knee, &amp; doe me of thy cordiuant shoone are buckled with the gold soe free; “doe thou me off thy sattin doublett, thy shirtband wrought with glistering gold, &amp; doe mee off thy golden Chaine about thy necke soe many a fold; “doe thou me off thy veluett hat with fether in thats is soe ffine, all vnto thy silken shirt thats wrought with many a golden swaine.” the child before him naked stood, with skin as white as lilly flower; for his worthy lords bewtie He might haue beene a ladyes paramoure. he put vpon him a lether cote, &amp; breeches of the same beneath the knee, &amp; sent that bony Child him froe, service for to craue, truly. he pulld then forth a naked sword that hange full low then by his side, “turne thy name, thou villaine,” he said, “or else this sword shall be thy guide.” “what must be my name, worthy steward? I pray thee, now tell it me.” “thy name shalbe pore disaware, to tend sheepe on a lonelye lee.” the bonny Child, he went him froe, &amp; looked to himselfe truly, saw his apparrell soe simple vppon; O Lord! he weeped tenderlye. vnto a shepards house that Childe did goe, &amp; said, “Sir, god you saue &amp; see! doe you not want a servant boy to tend your sheepe on a lonelie lee?” “where was thou borne?” the shepard said, “where, my boy, or in what country?” “Sir,” he said, “I was borne in fayre Scottland that is soe farr beyond the sea.” “I haue noe child,” the shepard sayd, “my boy, thoust tarry &amp; dwell with mee; my liuinge,” he sayd, “&amp; all my goods, Ile make thee heire [of] after mee.” &amp; then bespake the shepards wife, to the Lord of learne thus did she say, “goe thy way to our sheepe,” she said, “&amp; tend them well both night &amp; day.” it was a sore office, O Lord, for him that was a lord borne of a great degree! as he was tenting his sheepe alone, neither sport nor play cold hee. Let vs leaue talking of the Lord of Learne, &amp; let all such talking goe; let vs talke more of the falst steward that caused the Child all this woe. he sold this lord of Learnes his Clothes for 500??: to his pay, &amp; bought himselfe a suite of apparrell might well beseeme a Lord to weare. when he that Gorgeous apparrell bought that did soe finelie his body vppon, he laughed the bony Child to scorne that was the bonny Lord of learne; he laughed that bonny boy to scorne; Lord! pitty it was to heare! I haue herd them say, &amp; soe haue you too, that a man may buy gold to deere. when that he had all that gorgeous apparell that did soe finelie his body vpon, he went a woing to the dukes daughter of france, &amp; called himselfe the Lord of Learne. the duke of ffrance heard tell of this; to his place that worthy Lord was come truly; he entertaind him with a quart of Red renish wi[ne], saies, “Lord of Learne, thou art welcome to me!” then to supper that they were sett, Lords &amp; ladyes in their degree; the steward was sett next the duke of france; an vnseemlye sight it was to see. then bespake the duke of ffrance, vnto the Lord of leearne said hee there, sayes, “lord of Learne, if thoule marry my daught[er,] Ile Mend thy liuing 500?: a yeere.” Then bespake that Lady fayre, answered her ffather soe alone, that shee wold be his marryed wiffe if he wold make her Lady of Learne. then hand in hand the steward her he tooke, &amp; plight that Lady his troth alone, that she shold be his Marryed wiffe, &amp; he wold make her the Ladie of learne. thus that night it was gone, the other day was come truly, the Lady wold see the Robucke run vp hills &amp; dales &amp; forrest free. then shee was ware of the younge Lord of learne tending sheepe vnder a bryar, trulye; &amp; thus shee called vnto her maids, &amp; held her hands vp thus an hie, sayes, “feitch me yond shepards boy, Ile know why he doth mourne, trulye.” when he came before that Lady fayer, he fell downe vpon his knee, he had beene so well brought vpp he needed not to learne curtesie. “where wast thou borne, thou bonny boy, where or in what countrye?” “Madam, I was borne in faire Scottland that is soe farr beyond the sea.” “what is thy name, thou bonny boy? I pray thee tell it vnto mee.” “My name,” he sayes, “is poore Disaware, that tends sheepe on a lonely lee.” “one thing thou must tell mee, bonny boy, which I must needs aske of thee: “dost not thou know the young Lord of Learne? he is comen a woing into france to me.” “yes, that I doe, Madam,” he said; &amp; then he wept most tenderlie; “the Lord of learne is a worthy Lord, if he were at home in his oune country.” “what ayles thee to weepe, my bonny boy? tell me or ere I part thee froe.” “nothing but for a freind, Madam, thats dead from me many a yeere agoe.” a loud laughter the Ladie lought; O Lord! shee smiled wonderous hie; “I haue dwelled in france since I was borne; such a shepards boy I did neuer see. “wilt thou not leaue thy sheepe, my Child, &amp; come vnto service vnto mee? &amp; I will giue thee meate &amp; fee, &amp; my Chamberlaine thou shalt bee.” “then I will leaue my sheepe, Madam,” he sayd, “&amp; come into service vnto thee; if you will giue me meate &amp; fee, your Chamberlaine that I may bee.” when the Lady came before her father, shee fell Low downe vpon her knee, “grant me, father,” the Lady said, “this boy my Chamberlaine to be.” “but O Nay, Nay,” the duke did say, “soe my daughter it may not bee; the Lord that is come a woing to you will be offended with you &amp; mee.” then came downe the false steward which called himselfe the Lord of learne, trulie: when he looked that bonny boy vpon, an angry man I-wis was hee. “where thou was Borne, thou vagabond? where?” he sayd, “&amp; in what country?” says, “I was borne in fayre Scotland that is soe far beyond the sea.” “what is thy name, thou vagabond? haue done qu[i]cklie, &amp; tell it to me.” “my name,” he sayes, “is poore disaware; I tend sheep on the lonelie lee.” “thou art a theefe,” the steward said, “&amp; soe in the end I will prooue thee.” then be-spake the Ladie fayre, “peace, Lord of learne! I doe pray thee; ffor if noe loue you show this Child, noe favor can you haue of mee.” “will you beleeue me, Lady faire, when the truth I doe tell yee? att Aberdonie beyond the sea his father he robbed a 100: 3.” But then bespake the Duke of france vnto the boy soe tenderlie, saies, “boy, if thou loue harsses well, my stable groome I will make thee.” &amp; thus that that did passe vppon till the 12 monthes did draw to an ende; the boy applyed his office soe well, euery man became his freind. he went forth earlye one morning to water a gelding at the water soe free; the gelding vp, &amp; with his head he hitt the Child aboue his eye: “woe be to thee, thou gelding!” he sayd, “&amp; to the mare that foled thee! thou hast striken the Lord of learne a litle tinye aboue the knee. “first night after I was borne, a Lord I was; an earle after my father doth die; my father is the worthy Lord of learne; his child he hath noe more but mee; he sent me over the sea with the false steward, &amp; thus that he hath beguiled mee.” the Lady [wa]s in her garden greene, walking with her mayds, trulye, &amp; heard the boy this mourning make, &amp; went to weeping trulie: “sing on thy song, thou stable groome!

Scotish Ffeilde. [1st ffitt.] Grant, gracious god grant me this time that I may say or I cease thy seluen to please, &amp; Mary his Mother that Masked all this world, &amp; all the seemlie Saints that sitten in heaven. I will carpe of Kings that conquered full wide, that dwelled in this land that was alyes Noble; Henery the seauenth that soveraigne Lord, How he moued in at Milford with men but a few. there were lite Lords in this land that to that Lord longed, but of derby that deare Earle that doughty hath beene euer, &amp; the Lord chamberlaine that was his cheefe brother, Sauage, his sisters sonne a Sege that was able, &amp; Gylbert the gentle with a Iollye meanye, all Lancashire, these ladds thé ledden att their will, &amp; Cheshyre hath them chosen for their cheefe Captaine; Much worshipp haue thé woone in warre their was of their names in france &amp; in few lands soe fayre them behappen sith Brute heere abode &amp; first built vp houses. Sir James Blunt, that bold Knight he bowed to their hands; Soe did Sir Edward Poynings that proued was of deeds; Sir John Biron was neuer afrayd for no burne liuinge, a more manfull man was not of this Mold maked: thus with a royall retinewe raked thé forwarde, On this side Bosworth in a bancke thé bred forth their standards with a dragon full dearfe that adread was therafter, rayled full of red roses and riches enowe. there he bickered with a bore that doughtie was called, Richard that rich Lord in his bright armour, he held himselfe no Coward for he was a King Noble, he fought full freshlie his formen amonge till all his bright armour was all bloudye beronen. then was he dungen to death with many derfe strokes, cast him on a Capull &amp; carryed him to Liester, &amp; Naked into Newarke I will mine him noe more, but let drough[t]en deale with all as him deare liketh. then said Richmond this realme with all the royall cuntrye, &amp; raigine with royaltie &amp; riches enoughe full 24 yeeres In this fayre Land. he made french men afeard of his fell deedes; they paid him tribute trulie many told thousands, that thé might liue in their land &amp; him their Lord call. but death at him droue that die must he needs; thus went he forth of this world this worship[fful wight] to the celestiall blisse with Saints enowe. I will meddle with this matter noe more att this time, but he that is makeles of mercy haue mind of his soule! then succeeded his sonne a souerainge most noble, that proued was a prince most peerlesse of other, that was Henery the 8?? our most dread Lord. when his father, that feirce freake had finished his dayes, he made frenchmen afeard &amp; faire him besought that he wold take their tribute &amp; traine them noe further; but he nickeed them with Nay &amp; none of it wold, for he wold see vnder their seigniory some of theIre fayre townes. thus he greathes him godly with a grat host, full 15 thousand that feirce was in armes, for to fare into ffrance att their free will. then left hee in this land a Leede that was noble, of surrey that sure Earle the saddest of all other, as Lord &amp; Leiuetenant to Looke this land over, if any alyant in his absence durst aduenture him seluen to visitt or inuade our most valiant realme. then he dressed him to Dover our most dread King, with many Lords of this land our Lord giue them Ioy! of Bucckingham, Duke bold he was a [burn]e Noble, &amp; of Da[rby] the deere Earle he hath beene doughtie euer, &amp; Shrewsbury, that sure Earle the saddest of all other, as a warriour full wise he wends with the vaward; the Nob[l]e Earle of Northumberlande with others full Many, thé wende att their will &amp; wrought as them Liiked. thus thé glenten to Callice with great shipps of warre, &amp; many a sellcoth saylor where seene on their Masts. when thé to Callice comen all this seemly Meany, our Knight full [of] courage carpeth these words, calleth to his councell to witt their wills on what wise was best his warre to begine. some sett him to a Cittye that was sure walled, &amp; told him of Turwine a towne that was noble &amp; oft had beene assayd with Emperour &amp; other, yet wold it neuer be woone in warr for noe way on liue; there was noe wight in this world that win it nay might, it was soe deepe deluen with diches about. then our King full of Courage carped these words, sayes, “I will seege it about within this 7 dayes, or win it or I hence win with the leaue of our Lord, or leaue here my liffe Lord, I you sett.” thus he promised to the prince [That paradice weldeth.] there were carryages with carts &amp; many keene weapons. then they waward ffull valiantlie aduanced them seluen; with trumpetts &amp; tabretts forward thé wenten; beside the towne of turwin our tents downe we tilden, &amp; seeged it surlye on all sides about. many a gaping gunn was gurde to the walls, where there fell of the first shott manie a fell ffooder, that stones that were new sturrd for stoutley they shotten. now Leaue wee our King lying att this seege, &amp; carpe of the french King care him be-happen. when he heard how vnkindly his townes they were halched, he hyed him to paris for things that might happen; there called he his councell for to know their minds, or what wise was best to worke his warrs to begin he durst not venter with our King he was soe keene Holden, for all the gloring gold vnder the god of heauen. then his councell full Keenlye carped on this wise, says, “make forth a Messenge to the Mightye King of Scotts, &amp; profer him a present all of pure gold, &amp; bid him enter into England &amp; venter him seluen; he may win it in warre &amp; weld it as him liketh; there is noe leeds in tha[t] land saue Millers &amp; Masse preists, all were faren into france that fayre were in armes. then the King called a Earle that wold a lord Noble, Sir Delamont, that deere Duke that was doughtye euer; he bad buske him &amp; bowne him to goe on his Message; he wold as wise of his words as any way else. then that Knight full courteouslye kneeled to the ground, saies, “I am bound to goe as ye me bidd wold;” &amp; tooke his leaue of the King &amp; a letter he taketh, shoggs into a sure shipp &amp; shoggs ore the water into Scottland, I you to hett &amp; there the King findeth, &amp; profered him a present of pounds many a thousand, for to wend to that warr &amp; worke as him liketh, &amp; enter into England &amp; weld it for euer: there is noe Lord in that Land to looke him against, all were faren into france that feirce were in armes. the King was glad of that gold that he gan brought, &amp; promised him full peertly his part for to take, that his cozen the french King soone shold it know. then summons he his soeged in sundry places, that they byde shold at blackator in ther best weeds, By the [8??: day of August] to know theire Kings mind. there came at his commandement ketherinckes full many, from Orkney that Ile there came a great Host, from Galloway a gay Lord with a great Menie, all Scottland thither came to know their Kings mind: many Scotts &amp; Ketherickes bowed to his Hand; such an host of that Nation was neuer seene before; their names were numbred to 9 score thousand truly by their owne tounge as it was told after. then thé light att a lott the king and his lords, that the mighty Lord Maxwell shold moue them before with 10000 by tale that were tryed of the best, to see wether any seege durst sett him against: thus he rested in that realme the riggs altogether, till thé hard of that battell how it with him hapened. then he bowneth him boldlye ouer the broad waters, &amp; manlye him Marcheth to the Mill feelde; he robbeth like a rebell the right him against; but all Light on his leeds att the latter ends, for killed they were like Caytiues as you shall here after. when the commons of the country of this comen wisten, then fled they for feare soe crulye they fareden, &amp; made aw[ay with messengers] to tell my Lord dacres what Mischeefe the fomen made in the march ends; “but he kee[peth] him in Carleile &amp; keire wold no further, he wold not Meddle whithose Men for noe mans will.” then a knight of that countrie that was knowne full wide, one Sir william Baw-bener that hath beene bold euer, he moueth towards these Menie with men but a few, not fully 500 that the freake followed; then [mett] he with a Man that had 400?:; that was bold bastard hearne that bastard was neuer, a warriour full wise &amp; wittye of deedes. when they were summoned &amp; seene these seeges together, thé were numbred 900? that was the highest Number &amp; thé were 10000 by tale vpon the other partye; ffull vnmeete be them mached Marry them speede! thus they fared ouer the feild their formen to seeke; neuer rest wold these rangers but alwaies raked forward till they had seene that seege that they sought after. all these scaclech Scotts that alwayes scath diden. then niiged they nighe that abyde must thé needs euery ranke to his rest Rudlie [him dressed] not the mountenance of a Mile from theire most enemyes. soone after Drayned the day &amp; the dew falleth, the sun shott vp full soone &amp; shone ouer the feilds, birds bradd to the bowes &amp; boldly thé songen: itt was a solace to see for any seege liuinge. then euery bearne full boldlye bowneth him to his weapons, full radlye in array royally them dressed. our english men full merrilye attilde them to shoote, &amp; shotten the cruell Scots with their keene arrowes; many horsse in that heape hurled downe his Master; then they fettled them to flye as false beene thé euer. that serueth not forsoothe who soe truly telleth, our English men full eagerlie fast followed after, &amp; tooke prisoners prest &amp; home againe wenten. there were killed of the Scotts more then 12 score, &amp; as many more prisoners were put to ther ransome: thus were thé beaten att the first brayd all that brawling people, &amp; likwise in the latter end as yee may here after. [2? ffitt.] Then the mightie Lord Maxewell ouer the mountaines flees, &amp; kered to his King with careful tydings, telleth him the truth &amp; tarryeth noe longer, sayth, “I am beaten backe for all my bigg meny, and there beene killed of the Scotts I know not how many.” then the Scottish King full nie his witt wanteth, &amp; sayd, “on who was thou mached man, by the sooth?” he promised him pertlye thé passed not 1000. “yee beene cravens,” quoth the King “care mote yee happen! but Ile wend you to worke wayes I you sett alonge within that Land the length of 3 weekes, &amp; destroy all arright that standeth me before:” thus he promised to the prince that paradice weldeth. then hee summond his seeges &amp; sett them in order; the next way to Noram anon then he taketh; he enclosed that Castle cleane round about, &amp; they deffended fast the folke that were within. without succour come soone their sorrow is the more! the Earle of Surrey himselfe att Pomferett abideth; he heard what vnhappiness these scarlotts didden; He made letters boldly all the land over, into Lancashire beliue he caused a man ryde to the bishoppe of Ely that bode in those parts, curteouslye commanded him in the Kings name to summon the shire &amp; sett them in order; he was put in more power then any prelate else. then the Bishopp boldlye bowneth forth his standards with a Captaine full keene as it was knowne after; he made away to wend to warne his Deare Brother Edward, that Egar Knight that epe was of deeds. a stalke of the Stanleys stepe vpp him seluen, then full readilye he rayseth Knights ten thousand; to Scikpton in Crauen then thé comen beliue; there abydeth he the banner of his deare Brother, till a Captaine with it came that knowne was full wide, Sir John Stanley, that stout Knight that sterne was of deeds, with 4000 feirce men that followed him after, they were tenants to the booke that tended the bishoppe, &amp; of his houshold, I you hett hope you none other. euery bearne had on his brest brodered full fayre a foote of the fay[res]t fowle that euer flew on winge, with 3 crownes full cleare all of pure gold: it was a seemly sight to see them together, 14000 Eagle foote fettered in a-ray. thus they cooasten thorrow the countrye to the New-castle. proclamation in that place was plainly declared, that euery hattell shold him hie in hast that hee might, to boulton in Glendower all in goodlie haste. there mett thé a muster then, many a thousand, with Knights that were keene well knowne in their contry, &amp; many a louelye Lord vpon that londe hight. then they moued towards the Mountaine these Meany to seeche, these scattered Scotts that all they scath didden; they wold neuer rest but alway raked forward till they had seene the seeges that they had sought after; but they had gotten them a ground most vngracious of other, vpon the topp of a hie hill I hett you forsoothe, there was noe way in this world might wend them againe but he shold be killed [in the] close ere he climbed the Mountaine. when they Lords had on them looked as [long as them liked] euery Captaine was commanded their company to order. “tho wee are bashed with this bigg Meany I blame vs but litle, then wee tild downe ouer tents that told were a 1000; at the ffoot of a fine hill they setteled them all night, there they lyen &amp; lodged the length of 4 daies, till euery Captaine full Keenlie callen to their lords, bidd them settle them to fight or they wold fare homeward. there company was clemmed &amp; much cold did suffer; water was a worthy drinke win it who might.” then the Lord leiuetenant looked him about, &amp; boldly vnto battell busked he his meanye. the Lord Howard, the hende Knight haue shold the vanwarde with 14000 feirce men that followed him after. the left winge to that ward was Sir Eward Howarde, he chose to him Cheshire theire chance was the worse; because they knew not theire Captaine theire care was the more, for they were wont att all warr to wayte vppon the stanleys; much worshipp they woone when they that way serued, but now lanke is their losse our lord itt amend!

then he sent with his company a Knight that was noble, Sir John Stanley, the stout Knight that sterne was of deeds; there was neuer bearne borne that day bare him better. the Left wing to the rereward was my Lord Mounteagle, with many leeds of Lancashire that to himselfe longed, which foughten full freshly while the feild lasted. thus the rere ward in array raked euer after, as long as the light day lasted one the Lands. then the sun full soone shott vnder the clouds, &amp; it darkened full dimlie &amp; drew towards night. euery ring to his rest full radlye he dressed, beeten fires full fast &amp; fettlen them to sowpe besides Barwicke on a banke within a broad woode. then dauned the [daye] soe deere god ordayned; Clowdes cast vp full cleerlye like Castles full hie, then Phebus full faire flourished out his beames with Leames full light all the land ouer. all was damped with dew the daysies about, flowers flourished in the feild faire to behold; birrds bradden to the boughes &amp; boldlye thé songen; it was solace to heare for any seege liuing. then full boldlye on the broad hills we busked our standards, &amp; on a faugh vs be-side there we seene our enemyes were mouing ouer the mountaines to macth vs they thoughten, as boldly as any bearnes that borne was of mothers, Soe eagerly with Ire attilld them to meete. they trunmpetts full truly they tryden together, Many shames in that showe with theire shrill pipes; heauenly was theire Melody their Mirth to heare, how thé songen with a showte all the shawes ouer!

Egar was large of blood &amp; bone, but broad Lands had hee none, but euermore he wan the honour through worshipp of his bright armour; &amp; for loue that he was soe well taught, euer he Iusted &amp; hee fought; &amp; because he was soe well proued, the Erles daughter shee him Loued. they Ladye granted her good will, her father sented there soone till, he was glad that shee wold, that shee wold in hart fold for to take vntill her fere a baru[n] or else a bacheleere. these Knights Sir Egar &amp; Sir Grime, they were fellowes good &amp; fine; they were nothing sib of blood, but they were sworne Bretheren good; they keeped a chamber together att home; better loue Loved there never none. Vpon a time Egar he wold forth fare to win him worshippe, as he did ere, wherby that he might praysed bee aboue all knights of high degree. soe hee came home vpon a night, sore wounded, &amp; ill was he dight: his kniffe was forth, his sheath was gone, his scaberd by his thigh was done, a truncheon of a speare hee bore, &amp; other weapons he bare noe more. on his bed side he sett him downe, he siked sore, &amp; fell in swoone. Sir Grime of Garwicke shortlye rose, &amp; ran to Sir Egar, and said, “alas, for thee, Egar, my hart is woe that euer I were soe farr thee froe! for when wee parted att yonder yate thou was a mightye man, &amp; milde of state; &amp; well thou seemed, soe god me speede, to proue thy manhood on a steede; &amp; now thou art both pale and greene, &amp; in strong battell thou hast beene; thou hast beene in strong battell, it was neuer litle that made thee fayle.” “Now as it hath behappned mee, god, let it neuer behappen thee Nor noe other curteous Knight that euer goeth to the feild to fight, for to win worshipp as I haue done! I haue bought it deare &amp; lost it soone! for other Lords haue biddn att home, &amp; saued their bodyes forth of shame, &amp; kepeed their manhood faire &amp; cleane! well broked my loue before mine eyen, &amp; I am hurt &amp; wounded sore, &amp; manhood is lost for euer-more.” then said Grime to Sir Egar, “ye greeue you more then meete were; for that man was neuer soe well cladd, nor yett soe doughtye in armes dread, but in battell place he may be distayned. why shold his manhood be reproued, or his Ladye or his loue repine?” then said Egar, “lett be, Sir Grime! for fairer armour then I had, was neuer Cristian Knight in cladd; I had a body that seemed well to doe, &amp; weapons that well longed therto; well I trusted my Noble steed, soe that I did my good rich weed; &amp; well I trusted my Noble brand; the best of all I trusted my hart &amp; my hand! I heard tell of a venterous Knight that kept a fforbidden countrye bath day &amp; night, &amp; a fresh Iland by the sea where castles were with towers hye. ouer the riuer were ryding frythes 2, &amp; soone I chose to the one of tho; in short while had I rydden in that Land that was fforbidden, but I heard mouing in the greete as itt had beene of a steeds feete. My horsse gladedd with that cheere, cast vp his head &amp; was a steere, he groped together as he wold haue runen: I hearkned when more din had comen; I looked on the way nye before, &amp; see a Knight come on a sowre; red was his sheild, red was his speare, &amp; all of fresh gold shone his geere; &amp;, by the death that I must thole, my steed seemed to his but a fole; his speare that was both great &amp; long, faire on his brest he cold itt honge; &amp; I mine in my rest can folde. I gaue my horsse what head he wold, our steeds brought vs together soone: alas, that meeting I may mone! ffor through coate armour &amp; acton, through brest plate &amp; Habergion, through all my armour lesse &amp; more, Cleane through the body he me bore; &amp; I still in my sadle sate, my good spere on his brest I brake. the 2? time he came againe, he fayled of me, &amp; my steede he has slaine. then I gott vpp deliuerlye, not halfe soe soone as need had I; I thought to haue wrocken my steeds bane, but that great outrage my selfe hath tane; I drew a sword of Mettle bright, &amp; egerlye I sought vnto that Knight; I stroke at him with all my maine, I failed of him, &amp; his steed has slaine. when hee see that itt was soe, to counter on ffoote he was full throe; hee drew a sword, a worthy weapon; the first dint that on me did happen, throug all my armour, lesse and more, 7 inches into the sholder he me shore; &amp; I hitt him with whole pith aboue the girdle, that he groned with, &amp; with that stroke I cold him lett whiles another shortlye on him I sett, &amp; well I wott I had him gotten, but with that stroke my sword was broken. then I drew a kniffe,—I had noe other, the which I had of my owne borne brother,— &amp; he another out of sheath hath tane, &amp; neere hand together are we gone: first he wounded me in the face; my eyen were safe, that was my grace; then I hitt him vpon the head, that in his helme my blade I leade. god! lett neuer Knight soe woe be gon as I was when all my false weapons were done! yett with the haft that was left in my hand, fast vpon his face I dange that the blood sprang out from vnder the steele: he lost some teeth, that wott I weele. My Habergion that was of Millaine fine,— first my fathers and then was mine, &amp; itt had beene in many a thrust, &amp; neuer a naile of itt wold burst;— my acton was of Paris worke, saued me noe more than did my sarke, for his sword was of Noble steele, he strake hard—and it lasted weele— through all my armour more &amp; lesse, and neuer ceaced but in the fleshe. then, sore foughten, I waxed wearye, for blood as drye as any tree; I fought soe long, I ffell in swoone, till betweene his hands I fell downe. when I came to my-selfe, my steed was away; I looked on the Land where he lay; my steed lay slaine a litle me froe, &amp; his head backe striken in tow then I was ware of a runing strand, &amp; thither I crope on foot &amp; hand, &amp; from my eyen I washt the blood;— all was away shold have done me good;— then I looked on my right hand; my litle fingar was lackand. then I went further on the greene where more strong battells hadden beene; a slaine Knight &amp; spoyled lay, his litle fingar was away; &amp; by that Knight I might well see that one man had delt both with him &amp; me. then of a sadled horsse I gatt a sight, &amp; by him lay a slaine Knight; his steede was both good &amp; fine, but not halfe soe good as mine. all that day did I ryde till itt was in the euen tide; the Moone shone fayre, the starres cast light; then of a castle I gott a sight, of a Castle &amp; of a towne, &amp; by an arbour side I light downe; &amp; there I saw fast me by The fairest bower that euer saw I. a little while I tarryed there, and a lady came forth of a fresh Arbor; shee came forth of that garden greene, &amp; in that bower faine wold haue beene; shee was cladd in scarlett redd, &amp; all of fresh gold shone her heade, her rud was red as rose in raine, a fairer creature was neuer seene. me-thought her coming did me good, &amp; straight upon my feete I stoode. “Good Sir,” quoth shee, “what causes you here to lenge? for ye had meetter of great easmend; &amp; heere beside is a castle wight, &amp; there be leeches of great sleight, cuning men with for to deale, &amp; wonderous good happ haue for to heale; &amp; there is the gentlest Lady att will that euer man came in misery till; therfore I councell you thither to wend, for yee had neede of a great easmend.” “Lady,” said Egar, “as itt be-happened mee, I irke to come in any companye. I beseeche you, Lady faire and sweete, helpe that I were sounded with one sleepe, &amp; some Easment for me and my hackney.” “Sir,” sayd shee, “I will doe the best I may. Sir, sith I am first that with you mett, I wold your neede were the better bett.” then a faire maid, shee tooke my steede, &amp; into a stable shee did him leade, &amp; into a chamber both faire &amp; light I was led betweene 2 Ladyes bright. all my bloodye armour of me was done, the Lady searched my wounds full soone, shee gaue me drinke for to restore, for neere hand was I bled before; there was neuer alle nor wine came to mee in soe good a time; a siluer bason she cammanded soone, &amp; warme water therin to be done; the Ladye Loue-some vnde[r] line, with her white hands shee did wash mine, &amp; when shee saw my right hand bare, alas! my shame is much the more! the gloue was whole, the hand was nomen, therby shee might well see I was ouercomen; &amp; shee perceiued that I thought shame; therfore shee would not aske me my name, nor att that word shee sayd noe more, but all good easments I had there. then till a bed I was brought; I sleeped neuer halfe soe soft; the Ladye fayre of Hew &amp; hyde, shee sate downe by the bedside; shee a laid a souter vpon her knee, theron she plaid full louesomlye, &amp; yett for all her sweet playinge, oftimes shee had full still mourninge; &amp; her 2 maydens sweetlye sange, &amp; oft thé weeped, &amp; their hands wrange; but I heard neuer soe sweet playinge, &amp; euer amongst, soe sore siking. in the night shee came to me oft, &amp; asked me whether I wold ought; but alwayes I said her Nay till it drew neerr to the breake of day; then all my bloodye tents out shee drew, againe shee tented my wounds anew: wott yee well itt was noe threede, the tents that into my wounds yeede, they were neither of lake nor Line, but they were silke both good &amp; fine; twise the tenting of my wounds cost that Ladye 20 pounds, without spices and salues that did me ease, &amp; drinkes that did my body well please; &amp; then shee gaue me drinke in a horne; neuer since the time that I was borne such a draught I neuer gatt; with her hand shee held me after thatt. the drinke shee gaue mee was grasse greene; soone in my wounds itt was seene; the blood was away, the drinke was there, &amp; all was soft that erst was sore; &amp; methought I was able to run and stand, &amp; to haue taken a new battell in hand; the birds sange in the greene Arbor, I gate on foote and was on steere. the Ladye came to me where I lay, these were the words shee to me did say, “I rede you tarry a day or towe till you be in better plight to goe;” but I longed soe sore to be at home that I would needlye take leaue to gone. shee gaue me 2 shirts of raines in fere, put them next my body; I haue them here; &amp; my owne shee did abone, &amp; my bloudye armour on me hath done, saue my heauy habergion; shee was afrayd lest they wold haue mad my wounds to bleede; that Ladye with her milke white hand, to the rason of my saddell shee it bound with 2 bottels of rich wine, &amp; therof haue I liued euer sinne. I sayd, “a! deare good Madam, how may this be? the coningest leeche in this land be yee; for all my wounds lesse or more, of them I feele noe kind of sore as I had neuer beene wounded with sword nor speare, nor neuer weapon had done mee deere.” “wold god,” said shee, “that itt were soe! but I know well for a day or 2 froe that loue make you once agast, your oyntments may noe longer last. sith you will not abyde with mee, lett your Ladye in your countrye doe to your wounds as I wold haue done; then they will soft and heale full soone.” one thing did my hart great greeffe, I had nothing that Ladye to giue; but my golden beades forth I drew, that were of fine gold fresh and new. shee wold not receiue them at my hand, but on her bedside I lett them liggand; I tooke leaue of that Ladye bright, &amp; homewards rid both day &amp; Night. I fared full well all that while till I came home within 2 mile; then all my wounds wrought att once as kniues had beene beaten thorrow my bones; out of my sadle I fell that fraye; when I came to my selfe, my steed was away thus haue I beene in this ffarr countrye, such a venterous Knight mett with mee. Men called him Sir Gray Steele; I assayed him, &amp; he ffended weele. [The Second Part.] Then spake Grime to Sir Egar with soft words &amp; faire, “that man was neuer soe wise nor worthye, nor yet soe cuning proued in clergye, nor soe doughtye of hart nor hand, nor yett so bigg in stowre to stand, but in such companye he may put in but he is as like to loose as win; &amp; euer I bade you to keepe you weele out of the companye of Sir Gray Steele, for he is called by command the best Knight in any Land. sith the Matter is chanced soe, wee will take the wayes of choice 2: from your loue and laydye Lained this shalbee; shee shall know nothing of our priuitye.” but litle wist Egar nor Sir Grime where the lady was that same time; for the Lady that Egars loue was, her chamber was within a little space; of Sir Egar shee soe sore thought that shee lay wakened, and sleeped nought. a scarlett Mantle hath shee tane, to Grimes chamber is shee gone; shee heard them att a priuie dain; shee stayd with-out, &amp; came not in. when shee heard that Egars body was in distresse, shee loued his body mickle the worse. words this lady wold not say, but turned her backe &amp; went awaye, yet soe priuilye shee is not gone but Grime perceived that there was one; an vnfolded window opened hee, &amp; saw the way-gate of that Ladye. “what is that?” said Egar, “maketh that dinn?” Grime sayd, “my spanyell hound wold come in.” to his fellow Sir Egar he said noe more, but he repented that she came there. Gryme hath gotten that same night Leeches that beene of great sleight, coning men with for to deale, that had good happ wounds to heale. yett Long ere day word is gone that Egar the Knight is comen home, &amp; hath moe wounds with sword &amp; kniffe then had euer man that bare liffe: 17 wounds hee hath tane, 7 beene thorrow his body ran; the Leeches cold doe him noe remede, but all said “Egar wold be dead.” In the morning the Erle &amp; the countesse, to Grymes chamber can thé passe; the Erle said, “how doth Sir Egar the Knight?” then answered Grime both wise and wight: “he doth, my Lord, as you may see.” “alas!” said the Erle, “how may this bee?” Grime answered him hastilye, “my Lord, I shall tell you gentleye: &amp; vncoth Land he happened in, where townes where both few &amp; thinn; giffe he rode neuer soe fast, 7 dayes the wildernesse did last. he heard tell of a venterous Knight that kept a forbbidden countrye day &amp; night, &amp; a mile by the salt sea, castles fayre &amp; towers hye; On the other side a fayre strand, a faire fforrest on the other hand, on the one side run a fresh riuere, there might noe man nighe him nere; for he that ouer that riuer shold ryde, strange aventures shold abyde; hee shold either fight or flee, or a weed in that Land leaue shold hee; the wedd that he shold leaue in this land shold be the litle ffingar of his right hand; &amp; or he knew himselfe to slowe, his litle fingar he wold not forgoe. boldlye Egar gaue him battell tho; his helme and his hawberckes he tooke him fro, soe did he his sword &amp; his spere &amp; much more of his golden gayre; &amp; homewards as he rode apace thorrow the wylde forrest &amp; the wyldenesse, he thought to haue scaped withouten Lett. then 15 theeves with Egar Mett; they thought Egar for to have him sloe, his gold and his good to haue tooke him froe: thrise through them with a spere he ran, 7 he slew, and the master man, yett had hee scaped for all that dread; they shott att him, &amp; slew his steed; hee found a steed when they were gone, wheron Sir Egar is come home; for if Sir Egar dye this day, farwell flower of Knight-hoode for euer &amp; aye!” then the Erle proferred 40??: in Land for a Leeche that wold take Egar in hand. 9 dayes were comen &amp; gone or any Leeche wold Egar vndertane; it was 9 dayes and some deale more or his ladye wold come there; &amp; att the coming of that fayre Ladye, her words they were both strange &amp; drye: shee saies, “how doth that wounded Knight?” then answered Gryme both wise &amp; wight, “he doth, Madam, as yee may see.” “in faith,” said the Lady. “thats litle pittye: he might full well haue bidden att home; worshipp in that Land gatt he none; he gaue a ffingar to lett him gange, the next time he will offer vp the whole hand.” Gryme was euer wont to gange in councell with the ladye to stand, &amp; euer told Egar a fayre tale till the Knight Sir Egar was whole; for &amp; her want &amp; will had beene to him lenging, it wold have letted him of his mending. soe long the Leeches delt with Sir Egar till he might stoutlye goe &amp; stirr; till itt once beffell vppon a day Gryme thought the Ladye to assaye whether shee loued Sir Egar his brother as well as euer shee did before: Grime said, “Madame, by godds might, Egar will take a new battell with yonder Knight; he is to sore wounded yett for to gone; itt were worshipp to cause him to abyde at home, for he will doe more for you then mee.” then answered that fayre Lady, “all that while that Egar was the Knight that wan the degree in euery fight, for his sake verelye Manye a better I haue put by; therfor I will not bidd him ryde, nor att home I will not bid him abyde, Nor of his Marriage I haue Nothing adoe; I wott not, Gryme, what thou saist therto.” Gryme turned his backe of the Ladye faire, &amp; went againe to his brother Sir Egar, sett him downe on his bed side, &amp; talked these words in that tyde: “Egar,” he said, “thou &amp; I are brethren sworne, I loued neuer better brother borne; betwixt vs tow let vs make some cast, &amp; find to make our formen fast, for of our enemies wee stand in dread, &amp; wee Lye sleeping in our bedd.” Egar said, “what mistrust haue yee with mee? for this 7 monthes if I here bee, shall neuer a man take my matter in hand till I bee able to auenge my-selfe in Land.” A kinder Knight then Gryme was one, was neuer bredd of blood nor bone: “methinke you be displeased with mee, &amp; that is not your part for to bee, for sith the last time that ye came home, I haue knowen priuie messengers come &amp; gone betwixt your Ladye &amp; Erle Olyes, a Noble Knight that doughtye is, of better blood borne then euer were wee, &amp; halfe more liuings then such other 3.” then Egar vp his armes sprang, &amp; ffast together his hands dange, with still mourning &amp; siking sore saith, “alas! my loue &amp; my Ladye fayre, what haue I done to make you rothe that was euer leeue, &amp; now soe Lothe?” Gryme had of him great pittye, “brother,” he said, “be councelled by mee; if you will doe after my counsaile, peradventure it will greatly prevaile: another thing, my liffe I dare Lay that yee shall wed that Ladye within this monthes day.” “how now?” quoth Egar, “how may that bee?” “peace!” said Gryme, “&amp; I shall tell thee: I haue a brother that men call Palyas, a noble squier &amp; worthye is, he is welbeloued within this court of all the Lords round about; wee will him call to our councell, peradventur he will vs prevayle; &amp; I my selfe will make me sicke at home till a certen space be comen &amp; gone, &amp; that such a disease hath taken mee that I may noe man heare nor noe man see. Palyas my brother shall keepe you att home, &amp; I my selfe will to that battell gone, &amp; I shall feitch Gray-steeles right hand, or I shall leaue another fingar in that Land.” [The Third Part.] They called Pallyas to their councell, &amp; he assented soone withouten fayle, for he loued Sir Egar both Euen &amp; morne as well as he did Gryme his brother borne. “&amp; iff you will to this battell goe, yee had neede of good councell betwene Gryme, if thou wilt fight with Sir Gray-steele, thou had neede of weapons that stand wold weele; for weapons may be both fresh &amp; new, fikle, false, &amp; full vntrue; when a weapon faileth when a man hath need, all the worse then may hee speede; And all I say by Sir Egar, where was a better Knight knowen any where? when his weapon faild him att most need, all the worse then did he speede.” Palyas said, “there was somtimes in this countrye, Egar, your vnckle Sir Egranye, &amp; when that Egramye was liuand he had the guiding of a noble brand, the name of itt was called Erkyin; well were that man had it in keeping! first when that sword was rought, to King ffundus it was brought full far beyond the greekes sea, for a Iewell of high degree. when the King departed this world hence, he left it with the younge prince; &amp; some sayd that Egramye shold loue that ladye in priuitye; he desired the sword in borrowing; the King deceased at that time; &amp; when that Egrame was liuande, he had the guiding of that noble brand; that man was neuer of a woman borne, durst abyde the winde his face beforne. the Ladyes dwelling is heere nye; shee saith, ‘there is noe man that sword shall see till her owne sonne be att age &amp; land, &amp; able to welde his fathers brande.’” Grime sayd, “I will goe thither to-morrow at day to borrow that sword if that I may.” on the morrow when the sun shone bright, to Egrames Ladie went Grime the Knight; kindley he halcht that ladye faire: she saith, “how doth my Cozin Sir Egar?” “hee will forth, maddam, with all his might to take a new battell on yonder Knight; he prayeth you to lend him his vnckeles brand, &amp; there he hath sent you the deeds of his land, &amp; all mine I will leaue with you in pawne that your sword shall safelye come againe.” soe he desired that sword soe bright that shee was loth to with-say that Knight; then shee feitched him forth that Noble brand, &amp; receiued the deeds of both their lands; she said, “there was noe fault with Egeking, but for want of grace and gouerninge; for want of grace &amp; good gouerninge may loose a Kingdome &amp; a King, for there is neither Lin nor light that Egeking my sword meeteth with, but gladlye it will through itt gone, that biting sword, vnto the bone; but I wold not for both your Lands that Egeking came in a cowards hands.” &amp; yett was faine Sir Gryme the Knight: to Egar he went againe that night; Pallyas he said, “I read you be councelled by mee, &amp; take some gifts to that faire Ladye, to that Ladye faire &amp; bright that Lodged Sir Egar soe well the first night.” “the best tokens,” said Sir Egar, beene her sarkes of raines; I haue them here.” he tooke broches &amp; beads in that stonde, &amp; other Iewells worth 40??: &amp; to reward that fayre Ladye, &amp; thanke her of her curtesie. “wherby,” sayd Gryme, “shall I her know amongst other Ladyes that stands on a row?” “I shall tell you tokens,” sayd Sir Egar, Wherby you may know that Ladye faire: shee hath on her nose, betweene he[r] eyen, like to the Mountenance of a pin; &amp; that [hew] is red, &amp; the other is white, there is noe other Ladye her like, for shee is the gentlest of hart &amp; will that euer man came vntill.” Early on the other day theese 2 knights did them array: into a window Sir Egar yeede, bookes of Romans for to reede that all the court might him heare. the Knight was armed &amp; on steere; he came downe into the hall, &amp; tooke his leaue both of great &amp; small. the Erle tooke Egars hand in his fist, the countesse comlye cold him Kisse; his oune lady stood there by, shee wold bere the Knight noe companye: he sayd, “ffarwell my Lady faire!” shee sayd, “god keepe you better then he did ere!” &amp; all that euer stoode her by, did Marueill her answer was soe dry. he went to the chamber or he wold blin; Sir Gryme came forth as he went in, Stepped into the stirropp that stiffe were in warr, &amp; Palyas his brother wrought him a spere. then wold he noe longer abyde, but towards Gray-steele can he ryde. to the walls went winglaine, that Lady faire, for to see the waygate of her loue Sir Egar; &amp; Gryme the spurres spared not; soe weele to the steeds sides he let them feele, his horsse bouted forth with Noble cheere, he spowted forward as he had beene a deere till he was passed out of her sight. to Grymes chamber went that Ladye bright: yett long time or shee came there Palyas had warned Sir Egar, drawen double curtaines in that place that noe man of Sir Egar noe knowledg hath. Palyas was full of curtesie, &amp; sett a chaire for that faire Ladye: shee said, “at the walls, Palyas, I haue beene there to see the ryding forth of Sir Egar; he rydeth feircely out of the towne as he were a wild Lyon. alas! hee may make great boast &amp; shoure when there is noe man him before; but when there is man to man, &amp; steed to steede, to proue his manhood, then were it neede!” oftentimes Egar both cruell &amp; keene for her in strong battells oft hath beene, &amp; oftentimes had put himselfe in warr; &amp; lay &amp; heard her lowte him like a knaue: he wist not how he might him wrecke, but cast vp his armes, &amp; thought to speake. &amp; Palyas was perceiued of that, &amp; by the sholders he him gatt; he held him downe both sad &amp; sore, that he lay still &amp; sturrd noe more. Palyas was full of curtesie, &amp; thus answered that faire ladye; he said, “Maddame, by gods might, Egar is knowne for the Noblest Knight That euer was borne in the land of Beame, &amp; most worshipp hath woon to that Relme! that was well proued in heathenesse when the King of Beame did thither passe; soe did the Lords of this countrye, &amp; alsoe your father, that Erle soe free. there came a sowdan to a hill, that many christen men had done ill, the name of him was Gornordine, that many a christen man had put to pine; &amp; he becalled any cristen Knight, or any 5 that with him wold fight. 500 Knights were there that day, &amp; all to that battell they saydden nay. Egar thought on you att home, &amp; stale to that battell all alone; they fought together, as I heard tell, on a mountaine top till Gornordine fell. 60 Hethen were in a busment neere, &amp; all brake out vpon Sir Egar: or any reshcew came to him then, he had kild Gornordine &amp; other ten. then was he rescewed by a Noble Knight that euer was proued both hardye &amp; wight, the name of him was Kay of Kaynes, a Northeren Knight I trow he is; there were but Egar &amp; other ten, &amp; thé killed 60 or more of the heathen men; thus they reschewd the Noble Egar, &amp; brought him to the host, as you shall hear. the King of Beame in that stage offered Sir Egar his daughter in Marryage; yet that gentle Knight wold not doe soe, he loued you best [that] now be his foe. you be his foe, he knowes that nowe when he standeth in dread, I know.” the Lady was soe wrath with Palyas, shee tooke her leaue &amp; forth shee goth. Now lett vs leaue chyding att home, &amp; speake of Sir Gryme that is to the battell gone. [The Fourth Part.] All the wildernesse that there bee, Grime rode it in dayes 3; he mett a squier by the way; with fayre words Grime can to him say, “Sir,” he said, “who is Lord of this countrye?” the squier answered him gentlye, “It is a lord most worthyest in waine, Erle Gares is his name.” Grime sayd, “how highteth that lords heyre?” he sayd, “he hath none but a daughter fayre.” Gryme saith, “who hath that Ladye wedd?” the Knight sayd, “shee neuer came in mans bedd; but Sir Attelston, a hardye Knight, marryed that Lady fayre &amp; bright; for he gaue battell, that wott I weele, vpon a day to Sir Gray-Steele: a harder battell then there was done tho, was neuer betwixt Knights 2; but Gray-steele killed Sir Attelstone, a bolder Knight was neuer none. Erle Gares sonne &amp; his heyre,— in all the world was none more goodlyere,— he was soe sorry Attelstone was dead, he thought to quitt gray-steele his meede; boldlye he gaue him battell vpon a day, ther-for many a man sayd well-away! &amp; there thé both ended att this bane as many another Knight hath done; ffor I haue wist that tyrant with his hands 2 kill a 100 Knights and some deale moe; shamfulye hath driuen them to dead withouten succour or any remed.” for all the words he spake in that time, nothing it feared the Knight Sir Grime. Gryme sayd, “how ffarr haue wee to that citye whereas that Ladyes dwelling doth bee?” the Knight said “but miles 2; the one of them I will with you goe.” they talked together gentlye till he had brought Grime to that citye. att a burgesse house his ine he hath tane; to Seeke the Ladye Sir Grime is gone; then he went into a garden greene where he saw many Ladyes sheene; amongst them all he knew her there by the tokens of Sir Eger. Egar was hurt vnder the eare; an oyntment Gryme had drawen there; he held the gloue still on his hand where Egers fingars was lackand; &amp; when that knight came her nye, he kneeled downe vpon his knee, &amp; thanked her with humble cheere “sith the last time, madam, that I was heere.” “Sir,” said shee, “excused you must hold mee; thus avised, I did you neuer see.” then hee gaue her the shirts of raines in that stond and other Iewells worth 40??:, &amp; thus rewarded that fayre Ladye, &amp; thanked her of her curtesie. “Now Sir,” sayd shee, “soe haue I blisse: how fareth the Knight that sent me this?” “I doe, Madam, as yee see now, therof I thanke great god and you.” “why Sir,” said shee, “but is it yee that in such great perill here did bee? I am glad to see you so sound in sight.” hastilye shee rose &amp; kist that Knight. Gryme Looke vpon that Ladye faire: soe faire a creature saw I neuer ere; for shee was cladd in scarlett redd, &amp; all of fresh gold shone her head; her rud was red as rose in raine, a fairer creature was neuer seene. as many men in a matter full nice,— but all men in louing shall neuer be wise,— his mind on her was soe sett that all other matters he qu[i]te forgett; &amp; as thé stood thus talkeand, shee stale the gloue besids his hand. when shee saw his right hand bare, softly shee said to him there, “Sir,” said shee, “it was noe marueill though you hidd your hond! for such Leeches in this Land are none! there is noe Leeche in all this land can sett a fingar to a hand, to be as well &amp; as faire as neuer weapon had done it deere! but game and bourd Let goe together; scorning I can well conssider! it was neuer that Knights commandement noe scorne hither to mee to send! If thou be comen to scorne mee, ffull soone I can scorne thee.” before, shee was mild of state, Now is shee high and full of hate! &amp; of all the Iewells that he hath brought, shee curset them to the ground, &amp; wold them naught. Grime was neuer soe sore in all his day; he wist neuer a word what he shold say; &amp; as shee was to the chamber passand, Grime tooke that Ladye by the hand, saith, “I beseech you, lady free, a word or 2 to hearken mee, &amp;—soe helpe me god &amp; holy dame!— I shall tell you how all this matter was done: the knight that was heere, he was my brother, &amp; hee thought me more abler then any other for to take that matter in hand: he loueth a ladye within his land; if not in euery fight he win the gree, of his loue forsaken must he bee.” shee sayd, “yee seeme a gentle Knight, that answereth a ladye with soe much right.” the Iewells the mayden hath vpp tane, &amp; shee &amp; the Knight to chamber are gone. shee sent vnto that burgesse place a mayden that was faire of face; what cost soeuer his steede did take, twice double shee wold it make. a rich supper there was dight, &amp; shortlye sett before that Knight. Meate nor drinke none wold hee, he was soe enamored of that fayre Ladye. he longed sore to [bee] a bedd, &amp; to a chamber shee him Led, &amp; all his armour of was done, &amp; in his bed he was layd soone. the Ladye louesome of hew &amp; hyde sett her downe by his bedside, shee layd a sowter vpon her knee, &amp; theron shee playd full loue-somlye, &amp; her 2 mayds full sweetlye sang, &amp; euer they wept, &amp; range their hands. then Spake Gryme to that Ladye fayre: “of one thing, Madam, I have great Marueile, for I heard neuer soe sweet playinge, &amp; ofentetimes soe sore weepinge.” shee commanded her sowter to be taken her froe, &amp; sore shee wrange her hands 2: “Sir,” shee sayd, “I must neuer be weele till I be auenged on Sir Gray-steele, for he slew my brother, my fathers heyre, &amp; alsoe my owne Lord both fresh &amp; fayre; for Sir Attelstone shold me haue wedd, but I came neuer in his bedd; he gaue a battell, that wott I weele, vpon a day to Sir Gray-steele. a harder battell then was done thoe, was neuer betweene Knights 2; Gray-Steele killed Attelstone; therfor many a Knight made great moane. then my brother that was my fathers heyre— in all the world was none more goodlyer— he was soe sorry for my husband indeed, he thought to have quitt Gray-steele his Meede: boldlye he gaue him battell vpon a day; therfore many a man sayd wellaway! And there they both ended att that bone as many another Knight hath done; for I haue wist that tyrant with his hands 2 to haue a killed a 100 Knights &amp; moe, &amp; shamefully driuen them to dead with-outen succour or any remedeye. &amp; if thou be comen to fight with that Knight, Iesu defend thee in thy right! there is noe woman aliue that knoweth so weele as I doe of the Condicions of Sir Gray-steele, for euerye houre from Midnight till noone, eche hower he increaseth the strenght of a man; &amp; euery houer from Noone till Midnight, euery hower he bateth the strenght of a Knight. looke thou make thy first counter like a Knight, &amp; enter into his armour bright; looke boldlye vpon him thou breake thy spere as a manfull Knight in warr; then light downe rudlye for thy best boote; the tyrant is better on horsbacke then on foote; presse stiflye vpon him in that stoure as a Knight will thinke on his paramoure; but I will not bid yee thinke on me, but thinke on your ladye whersoeuer shee bee; &amp; let not that tyrant, if that he wold, lett you of that couenant that Ladye to holde.” then shee tooke leaue of that gentle Knight; to her chamber shee is gone with her maidens bright. Sir Gryme longed sore for the day; the Ostler soone can him arraye, he armed the Knight &amp; brought him his steede, &amp; he gaue him red gold for his meede. a rich brea[k]fast there was dight, &amp; shortlye sett before that Knight, but meate nor drinke none wold hee but a cuppe of wine &amp; soppes 3. he tooke leaue of that Ladye cleare, &amp; rydeth towards the fresh riuer. [The Fifth Part.] Early in that May morning, merrely when the burds can sing, the throstlecocke, the Nightingale, the laueracke &amp; the wild woodhall, the rookes risen in euery riuer, the birds made a blissfull bere; It was a heauenly Melodye pro a Knight that did a louer bee, on the one side to heare the small birds singing, on the other side the flowers springing. then drew forth of the dales the dun deere, the sun it shone both fresh &amp; cleere, Phebus gott vp with his golden beames, ouer all the land soe light it gleames; hee looked vpon the other side, see parkes &amp; palaces of Mickle pryde, with 7 townes by the salt sea with castles fayre &amp; towers hyee. ouer the riuer were ryding places 2, &amp; soone Grime chose to the one of tho; &amp; then he wold noe longer abyde, but into Gray-steeles Land can he ryde; &amp; yett was feared Sir Gryme the Knight lest he wold haue tarryed him till night; but, god wott, he had noe cause to doe soe; for Gray-steele had ouer-waches 2. they went &amp; told their Master anon right, “into your Land is comen a Knight, and 3?? he hath rydden about the plaine, And now is he bowne to turne home againe.” “Nay,” sayd Gray-steele, “by St. John! this one yeere he shall not goe home, but he shall either fight or flee, or a wed in this land leaue shall hee.” they brought him red sheeld &amp; red spere, &amp; all of fresh gold shone his geere; his brest plate was purpelye pight, his helmett itt shone with gold soe bright, his shankes full seemlye shone, was sett with gold &amp; precious stone, his armes with plate &amp; splents dight were sett with gold &amp; siluer bright; with his sheelde on his brest him beforne, theron was a dragon &amp; a vnicorne; on the other side a beare &amp; a wyld bore, in the Middest a ramping Lyon that wold byt[e] sore; about his necke withouten fayle a gorgett rought with rich Mayle, with his helme sett on his head soe hye; a mase of gold full royallye, on the top stoode a Carbunckle bright, it shone as Moone doth in the night; his sadle with selcamoure was sett, with barrs of gold richlye frett; his petrill was of silke of Inde, his steed was of a furley kinde, with raines of silke raught to his hand, with bells of gold theratt ringand. he stepped into his stirropp well armed in war, a Knight kneeled &amp; raught him a spere; &amp; then wold he noe longer abyde, but straight to Sir Grime cold he ryde. when Grime was ware of Gray-steele, through comfort his hart came to him weele; he sayd, “thou wounded my brother Sir Egar! that deed, traytor, thou shall buy full sore.” Gray-steele answered neuer a word, but came on Sir Grime as he was woode; they smoten their steeds with spurres bright, &amp; ran together with all their might; but Gray-steele came on Sir Grime like a lyon in his woodest time; soe did Grime vpon Sir Gray-steele, &amp; attilde him a dint that bote full weele; thorrow all his armour lesse &amp; more, cleane thorrow the body he him bore, that all his girthers burst in sunder; the Knight &amp; salle &amp; all came vnder. through the strenght of Gryime &amp; his steede he smote downe Gray-steele, &amp; ouer him yeede; &amp; well perceiued Gray-steele then that he was macht with a Noble man. then young grime start out of stray, &amp; from his stirrops he light that day; he thought on that Ladye yore, how shee had taught him to doe before; he shooke out his sword Egeking; the other mett him manffully without leasing; Grime sought him on one side &amp; raught him a wound full wyde; a 100?: Mailes he shore assunder, &amp; all the stuffe that was there vnder; throughout all his armour bright, 5 inch into the sholder, the sword light. but Gray-steele neuer with noe man mett that 2 such dints did on him sett; then thought Gray-steele, that warryour wight, to quitt Sir Grime that Noble Knight: He hytt him on the helme on hye that the fire as flynt out can flye; or euer he cold handle Egeking againe, 3 doughtye dints he sett on him certaine that almost Sir Gryme was slaine, the least of them might haue beene a mans bane. thus these Noble burnes in battele hacked &amp; hewed with Swords of Mettle. through rich many &amp; myny plee the red blood blemished both their blee. Sir Grime was learned in his child-hood full Noblye to handle a sworde; with an arkward stroke ffull slee he hitt Sir Gray-Steele on the knee; if he were neuer soe wight of hand, on the one foote he might but stand: “thou wounded my brorther Sir Egar; that deed thou shalt abuy full sore!” then answered Gray-steele, that warryour wight, “wherefore vpbraydest thou me with that Knight?” “for he neuer went by watter nor Lande, but he was as good as [t]he both of hart &amp; hand; &amp; hee had beene weaponed as well as I he had beene worth both thee &amp; mee.” he hitt Sir Gryme on the cainell bone; a quarter of his sheeled away his gone; the other he claue in tow that it ffell into the feyld soe far him froe; his Noble sword Egeking went from him without Leasing. but Grime was wight upon the land, he followed fast after &amp; gatt his brand; but on Gray-Steele had had his other foote to haue holpen him in neede and boote, I cold not thinke how Gryme the Knight shold haue comen againe to that Ladye bright. when he had gotten againe Ege-king, fell were the dints he sett on him; with an arkeward stroke full sore through Liuer &amp; longs Gray-steele he bore. Gray-Steele went walling woode when his sydes fomed of his harts blood; then perceiued the Knight Sir Grime that Gray-Steele was in poynt of time. Grime sayd, “yeeld thee, Sir Gray-steele, for thou can neuer doe soe weele.” the other said, “thou mayst lightlye lye; that man shall I neuer see; that man was neuer of woman borne shall make me yeelde, one man to one.” he was soe angry att Grimes words that both his hands he sett on his sword, &amp; with all his strenght that was in him Leade, he sett itt on Sir Grimes heade that such a stroke he neuer gate, nor noe Knight that was his mate. he thought his head roue assunder, his necke cracked that was vnder, his eares brushed out of blood. the Knight stackered with that stroke, &amp; stoode, for &amp; he &amp; had once fallen to the ground, the Lady had neuer seene him sound. thus they fought together fell &amp; sore the space of a mile and somthing more. Gray-steele bled withouten fayle, his visage waxed pan and wale; Grime att his gorgett he gate a gripe, &amp; fast he followed in after itt, &amp; backward to the ground he him bare; he let him neuer recouer more; his brest-plate from him he cast, &amp; thrise to the hart he him thrust: thus vngracious deeds without mending can neuer scape without an ill endinge. all this I say by Sir Gray-Steele, for fortune had led him long and weele; I haue wist that Knight with his hands tow slay 100 Knights and moe, shamefullye driuen them to dead without succour or any remed; &amp; he lyeth slaine with a poore Knight &amp; for his sworne brother came to fight. then Gryme looked by him soone; they steeds were fighting, as they had done; in sonder he parted the steeds 2; to Graysteeles sadle can he goe; he right the Girthes, &amp; sadled the steed, &amp; againe to the dead body he yeede, &amp; pulled forth his Noble Brand, &amp; smote of Sir Gray-steeles hande: “My brother left a fingar in this land with thee, therfore thy whole hand shall he see.” hee looked vp to the castle of stone, &amp; see Ladyes manye a one wringing, &amp; wayling, &amp; riuing there heare, striking, &amp; crying with voices full cleere. wight men, they wold not blin, horsse &amp; harnesse pro to win: it was euer Sir Gray-steeles desiring that for his death shold be made noe chalishing. Grime leapt on Sir Gray-steeles steed, his owne by the bridle he cold him leade, &amp; he rode towards the fresh riuer, there was noe man durst nye him nere; yett it was an howre within the night before he came againe to that Ladye bright. he rode strayght to the burgesse dore, the ostler mett him on the flore: “O Master!” he sayd, “now is come that Knight that went hence when the day was light; he hath brought with him Sir Gray-steeles steede, &amp; much more of his golden weede; he hath brought with him his chaine of gold— his sadle harnes is fayre to behold,— with other more of his golden geere; in all this land there is none such to were.” then to the dore fast cold they hye, bold men &amp; yeamanrye. the Burgesse asked the Knight whether he wold lodg with him all night. Grime sayd, “to lye in a strange Land— &amp; here is a strong Castle att hand— methinke itt were a great follye; I wott not who is my freind or my enemye.” hee tooke the hand, &amp; the gloue of gold soe gay; to the Ladyes chamber he tooke the way att supper where shee was sett, but neuer a Morsel might shee eate: “a!” shee sayd, “now I thinke on that Knight that went from me when the day was light! yesternight to the chamber I him Ledd; this night Gray-steele hath made his bed! alas! he is foule lost on him! that is much pittye for all his kine! for he is large of blood &amp; bone, &amp; goodlye nurture lacketh he none; &amp; he his fayre in armes to fold, He is worth to her his waight in gold; woe is me, for his loue in his countrye! shee may thinke longe or she him see!” with that she thought on her Lord Attelstone that they water out of her eyen ran. with that Grime knocked att the chamber dore, &amp; a maiden stoode ther on the flore; “O Madam!” shee said, “now is come that Knight that went hence when the day was light.” &amp; hastilye from the bord she rise, &amp; kissed him 20 sithe: “how haue you farren on your Iourney?” “full well, my loue,” Sir Grime did say, “for I haue taken such a surtye on yonder Knight that pore men in his country may haue right; Merchants may both buy and sell within the lands where they doe dwell.” he gaue her the hand &amp; the gloue gay, &amp; sayd, “lay vp this till itt be day.” shee tooke the gloue att him, but shee wist not that they hand was in; &amp; as they stoode still on the ground, the hand fell out ther in that stond, &amp; when shee looked on that hand that had slaine her brother and her husband, noe marueill though her hart did grisse, the red blood in her face did rise: it was red rowed for to see, with fingars more then other three; on euerye fingar a gay gold ring, a precious stone or a goodly thing; &amp; yet shee hath it vp tane &amp; put into the gloue againe, &amp; vnto a coffer did shee goe, &amp; vnlocked lockes one or 2. a rich supper there was dight &amp; sett before that worthye Knight, but meate nor drinke he might none; he was soe furbrished, body and bone, he longed sore to be a bedd. &amp; to a chamber shee him Ledd, &amp; all his armour of was done, &amp; the Lady searched his wounds soone. the Ladye was neuer soe soe sounde when shee saw hee had no death wound; for euer thought that fayre Ladye his wedded wife that shee shold bee. &amp; when shee had this done, to her owne chamber shee went soone; she tooke out the hand &amp; the gloue of gold; to her fathers hall shee sayd shee wold, att supper when he was sett, &amp; many Lords withouten lett. &amp; when shee came into the hall, finely shee halched on them all: “I can tell you tydings, father, will like you weelle; slaine is your enemye Sir Gray-steelee.” then they laughed all ffull hastilye, said, “Maddam, it seemeth to be a lye: that man was neuer borne of a woman cold neuer kill Gray-steele, one man to one.” she cast out the hand and the gloue of gold; all had Marueill did it behold, for it was red rowed for to see, with fingars more then other 3, &amp; on euerye fingar a fine gold ring, a precious stone or a goodlye thing. the Erle sayd, “daughter, wher dwelleth that Knight?” Then answered that Ladye both faire [&amp;] bright, &amp; sayth, “father, his name I cannott myn, but he was borne in the Land of Beame; he is large of blood &amp; bone, &amp; goodlye Nurture lacketh none; he is faire in armes to fold, he is worth his waight in gold; but he rydeth in the morning when it is day.” “that I sett gods forbott,” the Erle can say, “for I wold [not] for a iooo??: of florences red &amp; rounde, vnrewarded of me that he shold goe that soe manfully hath uenged mee on my foe.” Earlye on the other day Sir Gryme radylye can him array; &amp; as hee was his leaue takeand, the erle came att his hand; &amp; when the Erle came him nye, Sir Gryme sett him on his knee, &amp; thanked him with humble cheerre for the great refreshing he had there. the Erle tooke Gryme by the hand, &amp; said, “gentle Knight, doe thou vpp stand! &amp; as thou art a warriour wight, tarry with me this day &amp; this night.” “my Lord,” hee said, “I am at your will; all your comanndement to fulfill.” then a squier tooke the steeds tow, &amp; to a stable then can he goe; the Erle tooke Gryme by the hand, to the pallace thé yode Leadand; a rich dinner ther men might see, of Meate &amp; drinke was great plentye; the certaine sooth If I shold say, he was meate fellow for the Ladye gay. &amp; when the dinner was all done, the Erle tooke Grime into a chamber soone, &amp; spurred him gentlye, “Sir, beene you marryed in your countrye?” Grime answered him hastilye, “I had neuer wiffe nor yett Ladye: I tell you truly, by Saint John, I had neuer wiffe nor yett Lemman.” the Erle sayd, “I am glad indeed, for all the better here may you speede; for I haue a daughter that is my heyre of all my Lands, that is soe faire; &amp; if thou wilt wed that Ladye free, with all my hart I will giue her thee.” great thankes Gryme to him can make; saith, “I loue her to well to forsake!” and afore the Erle &amp; Bishopps 3 Gryime handfasted that faire Ladye. the day of Marryage itt was sett, that Gryme shold come againe without Let. the Erle feitched him in that stonde 2 robes was worth 400??: they were all beaten gold begon;— he gaue Egar the better when he came home.— he tooke Leaue of the Erle &amp; the Ladye, &amp; rydes home into his countrye. [The Sixth Part.] He came to a forrest a priuye way, &amp; leaueth his steed &amp; his palfray; &amp; when he had soe doone, he went to his chamber right soone, &amp; priuyle knocked on the dore, [&amp;] Palyas his brother stood on the flore. Palyas was neuer more glad &amp; blyth when he see his brother come home aliue. “how fareth Sir Egar?” Sir Grime can say. “the better that you haue sped on your Iourney.” “rise, Sir Egar, &amp; arme thee weele both in Iron &amp; in steele, &amp; goe into yonder forreste free, &amp; Pallyas my Brother shall goe with thee; &amp; there thou shalt find Sir Gray-steeles steed, &amp; much more of his golden weede; there thou shalt find his chaine of gold, his sadle harnesse full fayre to behold, with other more of his golden geere; in all this land is none such to weare. to-morrow when the sunn shineth bright, Looke thou gett into thy Ladyes sight, &amp; looke thou as strange to her bee as shee in times past hath been to thee; for &amp; thou doe not as shee hath done before, thou shalst loose my loue for euermore.” then forth went Egar &amp; Pallyas where the steeds &amp; steuen was. a scarlett Mantle Grime hath tane; to the Erles chamber hee his gone with still Mourning &amp; sighing sore, “alas! slaine is my brother Sir Egar! for 7 dayes are comen and gone sith he promised me to bee att home; he rode forth wounded verry sore; alas! my sorrow is much the more! thy great pride of thy daughter free made him in this great perill to bee; alas that euer shee was borne! the best Knight that euer was in this world is forlorne!” Gryme vpon his way can goe; the Erle &amp; the Countesse were full woe; then they bowned them both more &amp; lesse to the parish church to hear a Masse. when the Masse was all done, to the pallace thé went full soone. one looked betwene him &amp; the sunn, sais, “methinkes I see tow armed Knights come.” another sayd, “Nay indeed, it is an armed Knight ryding, and leads a steede.” &amp; when they Knight came them neere, all wist it was Sir Egar; but Gryme was the first man that euer welcomed Sir Egar home. the Erle tooke Egars hand in his, the countesse cold him comlye Kisse; his own Lady winglaine wold haue done soe; he turned his backe &amp; rode her froe, &amp; said, “parting is a priuye payne, but old freinds cannott be called againe! for the great kindnesse I haue found att thee, fforgotten shalt thou neuer bee.” he turned his steede in that tyde, &amp; said to Garnwicke he wold ryde. the Lady sooned when he did goe; the Erle &amp; the Countesse were full woe; the Erle profered Gryme 40??: of Land, of florences that were fayre &amp; round, for to gett the good will of Egar his daughter to: I hope that was ethe to doe. Grime went forth on his way, &amp; faire words to Egar [can he say:] “abyde &amp; speake a word with mee, Brother,” he said, “for Charitye.” Egar sayd, “here I am at your will; whatere you command, Ile fulfill.” a squier tooke his steeds tow, &amp; to a stable can he goe. Gryme tooke Egar by the hand, to their owne chamber they went Leadand, &amp; all his armour of hath done, &amp; laid it downe where he put it on. Gryme feitched forth tow robes in that stond, the worse was worth 400??: thé were all of beaten gold begon: he put the better Egar on; then was Egar the seemlyest man that was in all Christendonne. Gryme tooke him by the hand, to the palace thé yode Leadand: a rich dinner there Men might see, Meate &amp; drinke there was plentye;— certaine sooth if I shold say, he was meate fellow with the Ladye gay;— &amp; when the dinner was all done, Grime tooke the Erle to councell soone: “as my Lord Egar is the Knight that winneth the worshipp in euery fight, &amp; if hee shall haue your daughter free, att your owne will I haue gotten him to bee; I read anon that it were done.” the Erle &amp; the Countesse accorded soone; the Erle sent forth his messenger to great Lords both far &amp; neere, that they shold come by the 15 day to the marryage of his daughter gay. &amp; there Sir Egar, that Noble Knight, Marryed winglayne, that Ladye Bright. the feast it Lasted fortye dayes, with Lords &amp; Ladyes in royall arrayes; &amp; at the 40 dayes end, euerye man to his owne home wend, eche man home into his countrye; soe did Egar, Grime, &amp; Pallyas, all 3, they neuer stinted nor blan, to Earle Gares Land till thé came. the Erle wist he wold be there, he mett them with a royal fere, with a 100 Knights in royall array mett Egar &amp; Grime in the way, with much myrth of Minstrelsye, &amp; welcomed them into that countrye; &amp; there Sir Gryme, that Noble Knight, marryed Loosepine, that Ladye bright. why was shee called Loospaine? a better Leeche was none certaine. a royall wedding was made there, as good as was the other before; &amp; when 5 dayes done did hee, Egar desired all the Erles meanye to ryde with him into Gray-steeles Land, to resigne all into his brothers hand. they chose Pallyas to be their Captain wight; the Erle dubd him, and made a Knight, &amp; by councell of Lords with him did bee, hee gaue him a 100??: of fee. then wold they noe longer abyde, but into Gray-steeles Land can they ryde; they brake his parkes &amp; killed his deere, rasen his hauens &amp; shipps soe Cleere; They tooken townes &amp; castles of stone. Gray-steele had neuer a child but one that was a daughter fayre &amp; free; vntill that castle shee did flee; Egar tooke that Lady, as I vnderstand, &amp; brought her into Earle Gares land. when that Ladye the Earle did see, shee kneeled downe vpon her knee, &amp; said, “if my father were a tyrant &amp; your enemye, neuer take my Land froe me.” the Erle sayd, “for thy curtesye all the better the matter may bee: for to weld thy Land &amp; thee choose thee any Knight that thou he[r]e see.” amongst all that there was shee chose vnto Pallyas. glad &amp; blythe was Baron &amp; Knight, soe were Egar &amp; Gryme that were soe wight; &amp; there Sir Pallyas, that Noble Knight, marryed Emyas that was soe bright. a royall wedding was made thore, as good as was the other before. I neuer wist man that proued soe weele as did Sir Grine vpon Sir Gray-steele, for he gate to his brother Sir Egar an Erles Land &amp; a ladye faire; he gate himselfe an Erles lande, the fairest Lady that was Liuande; he gate his brother Pallyas a barrons daughter &amp; a Barronage. Winglaine bare to Sir Egar 10 children that were fayre; 10 of them were sonnes wight, &amp; 5, daughters fayre in sight. &amp; Loosepine bare to Sir Grime 10 children in short time; 7 of them sonnes was, &amp; 3 were daughters faire of face.

Sir: Triamore Low Iesus christ, o heauen King! grant you all his deare blessing, &amp; his heauen for to win! if you will a stond lay to your eare, of adventures you shall heare that wilbe to your liking, of a King &amp; of a queene that had great Ioy them betweene; Sir Arradas was his name; he had a queene named Margarett, shee was as true as steele, &amp; sweet, &amp; full false brought in fame by the Kings steward that Marrocke hight, a traitor &amp; a false knight: herafter yee will say all the same. hee looued well that Ladye gent; &amp; for shee wold not with him consent, he did that good Queene much shame. this King loued well his Queene because shee was comlye to be seene, &amp; as true as the turtle on tree. either to other made great Moane, for children together had they none begotten on their bodye; therfore the King, I vnderstand, made a vow to goe to the holy land, there for to fight &amp; for to slay; &amp; praid god that he wold send him tho grace to gett a child be-tweene them tow, that the right heire might bee. for his vow he did there make, &amp; of the pope the Crosse he did take, for to seek the land were god him bought. the night of his departing, on the Ladye Mild, as god it wold, hee gott a child; but they both wist itt naught. &amp; on the morrow when it was day the King hyed on his Iourney; for to tarry, he it not thought. then the Queene began to mourne because her Lord wold noe longer soiourne; shee sighed full sore, &amp; sobbed oft. the King &amp; his men armed them right, both Lords, Barrons, &amp; many a knight, with him for to goe. then betweene her &amp; the King was much sorrow &amp; mourninge when thé shold depart in too. he kissed &amp; tooke his leaue of the Queene, &amp; other Ladies bright &amp; sheene, &amp; of Marrocke his steward alsoe; the King commanded him on paine of his life for to keepe well his queene &amp; wiffe both in weale &amp; woe. now is the King forth gone to the place where god was on the crosse done, &amp; warreth there a while. then bethought this false steward— as yee shall here after[ward,]— his lord &amp; King to beguile; he wooed the Queene day &amp; night for to lye with her, &amp; he might; he dread no creature thoe. fful fayre hee did that Lady speake, that he might in bed with that Ladye sleepe; thus full oft he prayed her thoe. but shee was stedfast in her thought, &amp; heard them speake, &amp; said nought till hee all his case had told. then shee said, “Marrocke, hast thou not thought all that thou speakeest is ffor nought? I trow not that thou wold; “for well my Lord did trust thee, when hee to you deliuered mee to haue me vnder the hold; &amp; [thou] woldest full faine to doe thy Lord shame! traitor, thou art to bold!” then said Marrocke vnto that Ladye, “my Lord is gone now verelye against gods foes to ffight; &amp;, without the more wonder bee, hee shall come noe more att thee, as I am a true knight. “&amp; Madam, wee will worke soe priuilye, that wethere he doe liue or dye, for of this shall witt noe wight.” then waxed the Queene wonderous [wroth,] &amp; swore many a great othe as shee was a true woman, shee said, “traitor! if euer thou be soe hardiye to show me of such villanye, on a gallow tree I will thee hange! if I may know after this that thou tice me, I-wis thou shalt haue the law of the land.” Sir Marroccke said, “Ladye, mercye I said itt for noe villainé, by Iesu, heauen Kinge! but only for to proue your will, whether that you were good or ill, &amp; for noe other thinge; “but now, Madam, I may well see you are as true as turtle on the tree vnto my Lord the King; &amp; itt is to me both glad &amp; leefe; therfore take it not into greefe for noe manner of thinge.” &amp; soe the traitor excused him thoe, the Lady wend itt had beene soe as the steward had said. he went forth, &amp; held him still, &amp; thought he cold not haue his will; therfore hee was euill apayd. soe with treason &amp; trecherye he thought to doe her villanye; thus to himselfe he said. night &amp; day hee laboured then for to betray that good woman; soe att the last he her betraid. now of this good Queene leaue wee, &amp; by the grace of the holy trinitye full great with child did shee gone. now of King Arradas speake wee, that soe farr in heathinnesse is hee to fight against gods fone; there with his army &amp; all his might slew many a sarrazen in fight. great words of them there rose in the heathen Land, &amp; alsoe in Pagainé; &amp; in euerye other Land that they come bye, there sprang of him great losse. when [he] had done his pilgrimage, &amp; labored all that great voyage with all his good will &amp; lybertye,— att fflome Iorden &amp; att Bethlem, &amp; att Caluarye beside Ierusalem, in all the places was hee;— then he longed to come home to see his Ladye that liued at one; he thought euer on her greatlye. soe long thé sealed on the fome till att the last they came home; he arriued ouer the Last strond. the shippes did strike their sayles eche one, the men were glad the King came home vnto his owne Land. there was both mirth &amp; game, the Queene of his cominge was glad &amp; faine, Eche of them told other tydand. the King at last his Queene beheld, &amp; saw heer goe great with childe: [&amp;] hee wondred att that thinge. many a time he did her kisse, &amp; made great ioy without misse; his hart made great reioceinge. soone after the King hard tydinges newe by Marroccke: that false knight vntrue with reason his lord gan fraine, “my lord,” he sayd, “for gods byne! for of that childe that neuer was thine, why art thow soe fayne? “you wend that itt your owne bee; but,” he said, “Sir, ffor certaintye your Queene hath you betraine; another Knight, soe god me speed, begott this child sith you yeed, &amp; hath thy Queene forlaine.” “Alas!” said the King, “how may this bee? for I betooke her vnto thee, her to keepe in waile &amp; woe; &amp; vnder thy keeping how fortuned this that thou suffered her doe amisse? alas, Marroccke! why did thou soe?” “Sir,” said the steward, “blame not me; for much mone shee made for thee, as though shee had loued noe more; “I trowed on her noe villanye till I saw one lye her by, as the Mele had wrought. to him I came with Egar mood, &amp; slew the traitor as he stood; full sore itt [me] forethought. “then shee trowed shee shold be shent, &amp; promised me both Land &amp; rent; soe fayre shee me besought to doe with her all my will if that I wold [keepe] me still, &amp; tell you naught.” “of this,” said the King, “I haue great wonder; for sorrow my hart will breake assunder! why hath shee done amisse? alas! to whome shall I me mone, sith I haue lost my comlye Queene that I was wont to kisse?” the King said, “Marroccke, what is thy read? it is best to turne to dead my ladye that hath done me this; now because that shee is false to mee, I will neuer more her see, nor deale with her, I-wisse.” the steward said, “Lord, doe not soe; thou shalt neither burne ne sloe, but doe as I you shall you tell.” Marroccke sayd, “this councell I: banish her out of your Land priuilye, far into exile. “deliuer her an ambling steede, &amp; an old Knight to her lead; thus by my councell see yee doe; &amp; giue them some spending money that may them out of the land bring; I wold noe better then soe. “&amp; an other mans child shalbe you heyre, itt were neither good nor fayre but if itt were of your kin.” then said the King, “soe mote I thee, right as thou sayest, soe shall it bee, &amp; erst will I neuer blin.” Loe, now is exiled that good Queene; but shee wist not what it did meane, nor what made him to begin. to speake to her he nay wold; that made the Queenes hart full cold, &amp; that was great pittye &amp; sin. he did her cloth in purple weede, &amp; set her on an old steed that was both crooked &amp; almost blinde; he tooke her an old Knight, kine to the Queene, Sir Rodger hight, that was both curteous &amp; kind. 3 dayes he gaue them leaue to passe, &amp; after that day sett was, if men might them find, the Queene shold burned be starke dead in a ffyer with flames redd: this came of the stewards mind. 40??: florences for their expence the King did giue them in his presence, &amp; comannded them to goe. the Ladye mourned as shee shold dye; for all this shee wist not whye hee fared with her soe. that good Knight comforted the Queene, &amp; said, “att gods will all must beene; therfore, Madam, mourne you noe more.” Sir Rodger for her hath much care, [For ofte she mourned as she dyd fare,] &amp; cryed &amp; sighed full sore; Lords, Knights, &amp; ladyes gent mourned for her when shee went, &amp; be-wayled her that season. the Queene began to make sorrow &amp; care when shee from the King shold fare with wrong, against all reason. forth they went, in number 3, Sir Rodger, the Queene, &amp; his greyhound trulye; ah! o worth wicked treason! then thought the steward trulye to doe the Queene a villanye, &amp; to worke with her his will. he ordained him a companye of his owne men priuilye that wold assent him till; all vnder a Wood side they did lye wheras the Queene shold passe by, &amp; held them wonderous still; &amp; there he thought verelye his good Queene for to lye by, his lusts for to fulfill. &amp; when hee came into the wood, Sir Rodger &amp; the Queene soe good, &amp; there to passe with-out doubt; with that they were ware of the steward, how hee was coming to them ward with a ffull great rout. “heere is treason!” then said the Queene. “alas!” said Roger, “what may this meane? with foes wee be sett round about.” the Knight sayd, “heere will wee dwell; Our liffe wee shall full deere sell, be they neuer soe stout. “Madam,” he sayd, “be not affrayd, for I thinke heere with this sword that I shall make them lowte.” then cryed the steward to Sir Rodger on hye, &amp; said, “Lord, traitor! thou shalt dye! for that I goe about.” Sir Rodger said, “not for thee! my death shalt thou deare abye; for with thee will I fight.” he went to him shortlye, &amp; old Sir Rodger bare him manfullye like a full hardye Knight; he hewed on them boldlye; there was none of that companye soe hardye nor sow wight. Sir Rodger hitt one on the head that to the girdle the sword yeed, then was hee of them quitte; he smote a stroke with a sword good that all about them ran the blood, soe sore he did them smite; trulye-hee, his greyhound that was soo good, did helpe his master, &amp; by him stood, &amp; bitterlye can hee byte. then that Lady, that fayre foode, she feared Marrocke in her mood; shee light on foote, &amp; left her steede, &amp; ran fast, &amp; wold not leaue, &amp; hid her vnder a greene greaue, for shee was in great dread. Sir Rodger then the Queene can behold, &amp; of his liffe he did nothing hold; his good grayhound did help him indeed, &amp;, as itt is in the romans told, 14 he slew of yeomen bold; soe he quitted him in that steade. if hee had beene armed, I-wisse all the Masterye had been his; alas hee lacked weed. as good Sir Rodger gaue a stroake, behind him came Sir Marroccke,— that euill might he speed,— he smote Sir Rodger with a speare, &amp; to the ground he did him beare, &amp; fast that Knight did bleed. Sir Marroccke gaue him such a wound that he dyed there on ground, &amp; that was a sinfull deede. now is Rodger slaine certainlye. he rode forth &amp; let him Lye, &amp; sought after the Queene. fast hee rode, &amp; sought euerye way, yet wist he not where the Queene Laye. then said the traitor teene; ouer all the wood hee her sought; but as god wold, he found her nought. then waxed he wrath, I weene, &amp; held his Iourney euill besett, that with the Queene had not mett to haue had his pleasure, the traitor keene. &amp; when he cold not the lady finde, homeward they began to wend, hard by where Sir Rodger Lay. the steward him thrust throughout, for of his death he had noe doubt, &amp; this the storye doth say. &amp; when the traitor had done soe, he let him lye &amp; went him froe, &amp; tooke noe thought that day; yett all his companye was nye gone, 14 he left there dead for one; there passed but 4 away. then the Queene was ffull woe, And shee saw that they were goe, shee made sorrow &amp; crye. then shee rose &amp; went againe to Sir Rodger, &amp; found him slaine; his grey-hound by his feet did lye. “alas,” shee said, “that I was borne! my trew knight that I haue lorne, they haue him there slaine!” full pitteouslye shee mad her moane, &amp; said, “now must I goe alone!” the grey-hound shee wold haue had full faine; the hound still by his Master did lye, he licked his wounds, &amp; did whine &amp; crye. this to see the Queene had paine, &amp; said, “Sir Roger, this hast thou for me! alas that [it] shold euer bee!” her hayre shee tare in twayne; &amp; then shee went &amp; tooke her steed, &amp; wold noe longer there abyde lest men shold find her there. shee said, “Sir Roger, now thou art dead, who will the right way now me lead? for now thow mayst speake noe more.” right on the ground there as he lay dead, shee kist him or shee from him yead. god wott her hart was sore! what for sorrow &amp; dread, fast away shee can her speede, shee wist not wither nor where. the good grayhound for waile &amp; woe from the Knight hee wold not goe, but Lay &amp; licked his wound; he waite to haue healed them againe, &amp; therto he did his paine: loe, such loue is in a hound! this knight lay till he did stinke; the greayhound he began to thinke, &amp; scraped a pitt anon; therin he drew the dead corse, &amp; couered itt with earth &amp; Mosse, &amp; from him he wold not gone. the grayhound lay still there; this Queene gan forth to fare for dread of her fone; shee had great sorrow in her hart, the thornes pricked her wonderous smart, shee wist not wither to goe. this lady forth fast can hye into the land of Hugarye; thither came shee with great woe. at last shee came to a wood side, but then cold shee noe further ryde, her paynes tooke her soe. shee lighted downe in that tyde, for there shee did her trauncell abyde; god wold that it shold be soe. then shee with much paine tyed her horsse by the rayne, &amp; rested her there till her paynes were goe. shee was deliuered of a manchild sweete; &amp; when it began to crye &amp; weepe, it ioyed her hart greatlye. soone after, when shee might stirr, shee tooke her child to her full neere, And wrapt itt full softlye. What for wearye &amp; for woe, they fell a-sleepe both towe; her steed stood her behind. then came a knight rydand there, &amp; found this ladye soe louelye of cheere as hee hunted after the hind. the Knight hight Bernard Mowswinge, that found the Queene sleepinge, vnder the greenwoode lyande. softlye he went neere &amp; neere; he went on foot, &amp; beheld her cheere, as a Knight curteous &amp; kind. he awaked that ladye of beawtye; shee looked on him pitteouslee, &amp; was affrayd full sore. he said, “what doe you here, Madame? of whence be you, or whats your name? haue you your men forlorne?” “Sir,” shee sayd, “if you will witt, my name is called Margerett; in Arragon I was borne; heere I sufferd much greefe; helpe me, Sir, out of this Mischeefe! att some towne that I were.” the Knight beheld the Ladye good; hee thought shee was of gentle blood that was soe hard bestead; he tooke her vp curteouslye, &amp; the child that lay her bye; them both with him he led, &amp; made her haue a woman att will, tendinge of her, as itt was skill, all for to bring her a-bedd. whatsoeuer shee wold haue, shee needed itt not long to craue, her speech was right soone sped. thé christened the child with great honour, &amp; named him Sir Tryamore. then they were of him glad; great gifts to him was giuen of Lords &amp; ladyes by-deene, in bookes as I read. there dwelled that Ladye longe with much Ioy them amonge; of her thé were neuer wearye. the child was taught great nurterye; a Master had him vnder his care, &amp; taught him curtesie. this child waxed wonderous well, of great stature both of fleshe &amp; fell; euerye man loued him trulye, of his companye all folke were glad; indeed, noe other cause they had, the child was gentle &amp; bold. Now of the Queene let wee bee, &amp; of the grayhound speake wee that I erst of told. long 7 yeeres, soe god me saue, he did keepe his Masters graue, till that hee waxed old; this Gray-hound Sir Roger kept long, &amp; brought him vp sith he was younge, in story as it is told; therfore he kept soe there for the space of 7 yeere, &amp; goe from him he ne wold. euer vpon his Masters graue he lay, there might noe man haue him away for heat neither for cold, without it were once a day he ran about to gett his prey of beasts that were bold, conyes, when he can them gett; thus wold he labor for his meate, yett great hungar he had in how. &amp; 7 yeeres he dwelled there, till itt beffell on that yeere, euen on christmasse day, the gray-hound (as the story sayes) came to the Kings palace without any delay. when they Lords were sett at meate, soone the grayhound into the hall runn amonge the knights gay; all about he can behold, but he see not what hee wold; then went he his way full right when he had sought &amp; cold not find; ffull gentlye he did his kind, speed better when he might. the grayhound ran forth his way till he came where his Master Lay, as fast as euer he mought. the king marueiled at that deed, from whence he went, &amp; whither he yeed, or who him thither brought. the King thought he had seene him ere, but he wist not well where, therfor he said right nought. soone he bethought him then that he did him erst ken, &amp; still stayd in that thought. the other day, in the same wise, when the King shold from his meate rise, the Grayhound came in thoe; all about there he sought, but the steward found he nought; then againe he began to goe. the[n] sayd the King in that stond, “methinkes it is Sir Rogers hound that went forth with the Queene; I trow they be come againe to this land. Lords, all this I vnderstand, it may right well soe bee; “if that they be into this Land come, we shall haue word therof soone &amp; within short space; for neuer since thé went I-wisse I saw not the gray hound ere this; it is a marueilous case! “when he cometh againe, follow him, fo[r] euermore he will run to his Masters dwelling place; run &amp; goe, looke ye not spare, till that yee come there to Sir Rodger &amp; my Queene.” then the 3?. day, amonge them all the grayhound came into the hall, to meate ere thé were sett. Marrocke the steward was within, the grayhound thought he wold not blin till he with him had mett; he tooke the steward by the throte, &amp; assunder he it bote; but then he wold not byde, for to his graue he rann. there follolwed him many a man. some on horsse, some beside; &amp; when he came where his Master was, he Layd him downe beside the grasse And barked at the men againe. there might noe man him from the place gett, &amp; yett with staues thé did him beate, that he was almost slaine. &amp; when the men saw noe better boote, then the men yeed home on horsse &amp; foote, with great wonder, I weene. the King said, “by gods paine, I trow Sir Marrocke hath Sir Rodger slaine, &amp; with treason famed my Queene. “goe yee &amp; seeke there againe; for the hounds Master there is slaine, some treason there hath beene.” thither they went, soe god me saue, &amp; found Sir Roger in his graue, for that was soone seene: &amp; there they looked him there vpon, for he was hole both flesh &amp; bone, &amp; to the court his body they brought. for when the King did him see, the teares ran downe from his eye, full sore itt him forethought. the grayhound he wold not from his course fare: then was the King cast in care, &amp; said, “Marroccke hath done me teene; slaine he hath a curteous Knight, &amp; fained my Queene with great vnright, as a traitor keene.” the King let draw anon-right the stewards bodye, that false Knight, with horsse through the towne; then he hanged him on a tree, that all men might his body see, that he had done treason. Sir Rogers Body the next day the King buryed in good array, with many a bold baron. the Grayhound was neuer away by night nor yet by day, but on the ground he did dye. the King did send his messengere in euerye place far &amp; neere after the Queene to spye; but for ought he cold enquire, he cold of that Ladye nothing heare; therfore the King was sorrye. the King sayd, “I trow noe reed, for well I wott that shee is dead; for sorrowe now shall I dye! alas, that euer shee from mee went! this false steward hath me shent throughe his false treacherye.” this King liued in great sorrow both euening &amp; morrow till that hee were brought to ground. he liued thus many a yeere with mourning &amp; with euill cheere, his sorrowes lasted long: &amp; euer it did him great paine when hee did thinke how Sir Roger was slaine, &amp; how helped him his hound; &amp; of his Queene that was soe Mylde, how shee went from him great with child; for woe then did hee sound. long time thus liued the King in great sorrow &amp; Mourning, &amp; oftentime did weepe; he tooke great thought more &amp; more, It made his hart verrye sore, his sighs were sett soe deepe. now of the King wee will bline, &amp; of the Queene let vs begin, &amp; Sir Tryamore; for when he was 14 yeere old, there was noe man soe bold durst doe him dishonor; in euerye time both stout &amp; stronge, &amp; in stature large &amp; longe, comlye of hye color; all that euer he dwelled amonge, he neuer did none of them wronge, the more that was his honor. in that time sikerlye dyed the King of Hungarye that was of great age I-wiss; he had no heire his land to hold but a daughter was 14 yeers old; faire [Hellen] shee named is. shee was as white as lilye flower, &amp; comely, of gay color, the fairest of any towne or tower; shee was well shapen of foote &amp; hand, peere shee had none in noe land, shee was soe fresh &amp; soe amorous. for when her father was dead, great warr began to spread in that land about; then the Ladyes councell gan her reade, ‘gett her a lord her land to lead, to rule the realme without doubt; some mightye prince that well might rule her land with reason &amp; right, that all men to him might Lout.’ &amp; when her councell had sayd soe, for great need shee had therto, shee graunted them without Lye: the Lady said, “I will not feare but he [be] prince or princes peere, &amp; cheefe of all chiualrye.” therto shee did consent, &amp; gaue her Lords commandement a great Iusting for to crye; &amp; at the Iustine, shold soe bee, what man that shold win the degree, shold win that Ladye trulye. the day of Iusting then was sett, halfe a yeere without lett, without any more delay, because thé might haue good space, Lords, knights, dukes, in euerye place, for to be there that day. Lords, the best in euerye Land, hard tell of that rydand, &amp; made them readye full gay; of euerye land there was the best, of the States that were honest attyred many a Lady gay. great was that chiualrye that came that time to Hungarye, there for to Iust with might. at last Triamore hard tyding that there shold be a Iusting; thither wold he wend. if he wist that he might gaine with all his might, he wold be faine that gay Ladye for to win; hee had noe horsse nay noe other geere, Nor noe weapon with him to beare; that brake his hart in twaine. he thought both euen &amp; morrow where he might some armour borrowe, therof wold hee be faine. to Sir Barnard then he can wend, that he wold armour lend to iust against the knights amaine. then said Sir Barnard, “what hast thou thought? pardew! of iusting thou canst nought! for yee bee not able wepon to weld.” “Sir,” said Triamore, “what wott yee of what strenght that I bee till I haue assayd in feeld?” then Sir Barnard that was full hend, said, “Triamor, if thow wilt wend, thou shalt lacke noe weed; I will lend thee all my geere, horsse &amp; harneis, sheild &amp; spere, thou art nothing to dread; “alsoe thither with thee will I ryde, &amp; euer nye be by thy side to helpe thee if thou haue need; all things that thow wilt haue, gold &amp; siluer, if thow wilt craue, thy Iourney for to speed.” then was Triamore glad &amp; light, &amp; thanked Barnard with all his might of his great proferinge. that day the Iusting shold bee, Triamore sett him on his knee &amp; asked his mother blessinge. at home shee wold haue kept him faine; but all her labor was in vaine, there might be noe letting. shee saw it wold noe better bee, her blessing shee gaue him verelye w[i]th full sore weepinge. &amp; when it was on the Morrow day, Triamore was in good array, armed &amp; well dight; when he was sett on his steed, he was a man both lenght &amp; bread, &amp; goodlye in mans sight. then Triamore to the feeld can ryde, &amp; Sir Barnard by his side; they were Iocund &amp; light; there was none in all the feild that was more seemlye vnder sheild; he rode full like a knight. then was the faire Lady sett full hye vppon a turrett, for to behold that play; there was many a seemlye Knight, princes, Lords, &amp; dukes of Might, themselues for to assay, with helme on theire heads bright that all the feelds shone with light, they were soe stout &amp; gay: then Sir triamore &amp; Sir Barnard thé pressed them into the feeld forward, there durst noe man say nay. there was much price &amp; pride when euerye man to other can ryde, &amp; lords of great renowne; it beffell triamore that tyde for to be on his fathers side, the King of Arragon. the first that rode forth certainlye was a great Lord of Lumbardye, a wonderfull bold Barron. Triamor rode him againe: for all that lord had Might &amp; maine, the child bare him downe. then cryed Sir Barnard with honor. “A triamor, a triamore!” for men shold him ken. Mayd Hellen that was soe mild, more shee beheld triamore the child then all the other men. then the Kings sonne of Nauarrne wold not his body warne; he pricked forth on the plaine. then young Triamore that was stout, turned himselfe round about, &amp; fast rode him againe; soe neither of them were to ground cast, they sate soe wonderous fast, like men of much might. then came forth a Bachelour, a prince proud without peere; Sir Iames, forsooth, he hight; he was the Emperours sonne of Almaigne; he rode Sir triamore againe, with hard strenght to fight. Sir Iames had such a stroake indeed that he was tumbled from his steed; then failed all his might. there men might see swords brast, helmes ne sheilds might not last; &amp; thus it dured till night; but when the sun drew neere west, and all the Lords went to rerst, [Not so the maide Elyne.] the Knights attired them in good arraye, on steeds great, with trappers gaye, before the sun can shine; then to the feeld thé pricked prest, &amp; euerye man thought himselfe best [As the mayden faire they paste.] then they feirclye ran together, great speres in peeces did shimmer, their timber might not last. &amp; at that time there did run the King Arradas of Arragon: his sonne Triiamore mett him in that tyde, &amp; gaue his father such a rebound that harse &amp; man fell to the ground, soe stoutlye gan he ryde. then the next Knight that hee mett was Sir Iames; &amp; such a stroake him sett vpon the sheild ther on the plaine that the blood brast out at his nose &amp; eares, his steed vnto the ground him beares; then was Sir Barnard faine. that Maid of great honor sett her loue on younge triamore that fought alwayes as a feirce Lyon. speres that day many were spent, &amp; with swords there was many a stripe lent, till the[re] failed light of the sunn. on the Morrow all they were faine for to come into the feild againe with great spere &amp; sheild. then the Duke of Siuille, Sir Phylar, that was a doughtye knight in euerye warr, he rode first into the feild; &amp; Triamore tooke his spere, against the Duke he can it beare, &amp; smote him in the sheild; a-sunder in 2 peeces it went; &amp; then many a louelye Lady gent, full well they him beheld. then came forth a Knight that hight Terrey, hee was a great Lord of Surrey, he thought Noble Triamore to assayle; &amp; Triamore rode to him blithe in all the strenght that he might driue, he thought he wold not fayle; he smote him soe in that stond that horsse &amp; man fell to the ground, soe sore his stroke he sett. then durst noe man att triamore [ride,] for fortune held all on his side all those dayes 3. Sir Iames, sonne vnto the Emperour, had enuye to Sir Triamore, and laid wait for him priuilye. att the last Triamore came ryding bye. Sir Iames said, “Triamore! thou shalt dye, for thou hast done me shame.” he rode to Triamore with a spere, &amp; thorrow the thigh he can him beare; he had almost him slaine. but Tryamore hitt him in the head that he fell downe starke dead. then was all his men woe; then wold they haue slaine Tryamore without he had had great succour; they purposed to doe soe. with that came King Arradas then, &amp; reschued Tryamore with all his men, that stood in great doubt. then Sir Barnard was full woe that Tryamore was hurt soe; then to his owne house he him brought. but when the Mother saw her sonns wound, shee fell downe for sorrow to the ground, &amp; after a Leeche shee sent. of this, all the Lords that were Iustinge, to the pallace made highinge, &amp; to that Ladye went. truly, as the story sayes, thé pricked forth to the pallace the Ladyes will to heare, Bachelours &amp; knights prest, that shee might choose of them the best which to her faynest were. the Ladye beheld all that fayre Meanye, but Tryamore shee cold not see: tho chaunged all her cheere, then shee sayd “Lord, where is hee that euerye day wan the degree? I chuse him to my peere.” al about thé Tryamore sought; he was ryddn home; thé found him nought; then was that Ladye woe. the Knights were afore her brought, &amp; of respite shee them besought, a yeare &amp; noe more: shee said, “Lords, soe god me saue! he that wan me, he shall me haue; ye wot well that my cry was soe.” thé all consented her vntill, for shee said Nothing ill, thé said it shold be soe. for when they had all sayd, then answered that fayre Mayd, “I will haue none but Tryamore.” then all the Lords that were present tooke their Leaue, &amp; home went; there wan thé litle honor. Sir Iames men were nothing faine because their Master, he was slaine, That was soe stout in stowre; in chaire his body thé Layd, &amp; led him home, as I haue sayd, vnto his father the Emperour; &amp; when that hee his sonne gan see, a sorrye man then was hee, &amp; asked ‘who had done that dishonor?’ thé sayd “wee [ne] wott who it is I-wisse, but Sir Tryamore he named is, soe thé called him in the crye; “the King of Arragon alsoe, he helped thy sonne to sloe, with all his companye.” they said, “thé be good warryoirs; they byte vs with sharpe showers with great villanye.” “Alas!” said the Emperour, “till I be reuenged on that traytour, now shall I neuer cease! thé shall haue many a sharpe shower, both the King &amp; Tryamore, they shall neuer haue peace!” the Emperour sayd thé shold repent; &amp; after great companye he sent of princes bold in presse, Dukes, Earles, &amp; lords of price. with a great armye, the Duke sayes, thé yeed to Arragon without lesse. King Arradas was a-dread for the Emperour such power had, that battell hee wold him bid; he saw his land nye ouer-gon, &amp; to a castle hee fledd anon, &amp; victualls it for dread. the Emperour was bold &amp; stout, &amp; beseeged the castle about; his banner he began to spread, &amp; arrayd his host full well &amp; wiselye, with wepons strong &amp; mightye he thought to make them dread. the Emperour was bold &amp; stout, &amp; beseeged the castle about, &amp; his banner he gan to spread; he gaue assault to the hold. King Arradas was stout &amp; bold, ordayned him full well. with gunes &amp; great stones round were throwne downe to the ground, &amp; on the men were cast; they brake many backes &amp; bones, that they fought euerye[day] ones while 7 weekes did last. the Emperour was hurt ill therfore, his men were hurt sore, all his Ioy was past. King Arradas thought full longe that hee was beseeged soe stronge, with soe much might &amp; maine: 2 Lords forth a Message he sent, &amp; straight to the Emperour thé went. soe when they cold him see, of peace they can him pray, to take truce till a certaine day. thé kneeled downe on their knee, &amp; said, “our King sendeth word to thee that he neuer your sonne did slay, soe he wold quitt him faine; he was not then present, nor did noe wise consent that your sonne was slaine. That [he] will proue, if you will soe, your selfe and he betweene you tow, if you will it sayne; “or else take your selfe a Knight, &amp; he will gett another to fight on a certaine day: if that your Knight hap soe ours for to discomfort or sloe, as by fortune itt may, our King then will doe your will, be att your bidding lowde &amp; still without more delay; “&amp; alsoe if it you betyde that your knight on your syde be slaine by Mischance, My Lord shall make your warr to cease, [and we shall after be at pease,] without any distance.” the Emperour said without fayle “sett a day of Battell by assent of the King of france;” for he had a great Campiowne, in euerye realme he wan renowne; soe the Emperour ceased his distance. when peace was made, &amp; truce came, then King Arradas were a Ioyfull man, &amp; trusted vnto Tryamore. Soe after him he went without fayle, for to doe the great battelle to his helpe &amp; succour. his Messengers were come &amp; gone, tydings of him hard thé none. the King Arradas thought him long, “&amp; he be dead, I may say alas! who shall then fight with Marradais that is soe stout &amp; stronge?” when Tryamore was whole &amp; sound, &amp; well healed of his wound, he busked him for to fare; he sayd, “mother,” with mild cheere, “&amp; I wist what my father were, the lesse were my care.” “sonne,” shee said, “thou shalt witt; when thou hast Marryed that Ladye sweet, thy father thou shalt ken.” “mother,” he said, “if you will [soe,] haue good day, for now I goe to doe my Masteryes if I can.” then rode he ouer dale &amp; downe vntill he came to Arragon, ouer many a weary way. aduentures many him befell, &amp; all he scaped full well, in all his great Iourney. he saw many a wild beast both in heath &amp; in forrest; he had good grey-hounds 3; then to a hart he let them run till 14 fosters spyed him soone, soe threatened him greatlye; they yeede to him with weapons on euerye side; it was noe boote to bid them byde; Tryamore was loth to flye, &amp; said vnto them, “Lords, I you pray, lett me in peace wend my way to seeke my grayhounds 3.” then said Tryamore as in this time, “gold &amp; siluer, take all mine if that I haue tresspassed ought.” Thé said, “wee will meete with thy anon, there shall noe gold borrow thee soone, but in prison thou shalt be brought, Such is the law of the ground; Whosoeuer therin may be found, other way goe thé nought.” then Sir Tryamore was full woe that to prison he shold goe; hee thought the flesh to deare bought. there was no more to say, the fosters att him gan lay with strokes sterne and stout. there Tryamore with them fought; some to the ground be brought; he made them lowe to looke; some of them fast gan pray, the other fled fast away with wounds wyde that they sought. Tryamore sought &amp; found his gray-hounds; he hear[k]ned to their yerning sounds, &amp; thought not for to leaue them soe. at last he came to a water side; there he saw the beast abyde that had slaine 2 of his grayhounds; the 3?. full sore troubled the hind, &amp; he hurt him with his trinde; then was Tryamore woe. if the battaile had lasted a while, the hart wold the hound beguile, &amp; take his life for euermore. Tryamore smote att the deere, and to the hart went the spere; then his horne he blew full sore. the King Lay there beside at Mannour that same tide; he hard a horne blowe; they had great wonder in hall, both Knights, Squiers, &amp; all, for noe man cold it know. with that ran in a foster into the hall with euill cheere, &amp; was full sorry, I trow. the King of tydings gan him fraine; he answered, “Sir King, your Keepers be slaine, and lye dead on a rowe. there came a knight that was mightye, he let 3 grayhounds that were wightye, &amp; laid my fellowes full lowe:” he sayd, it was full true that the same that the horne blew that all this sorrow hath wrought. King Arradas said then, “I haue great need of such of a man; god hath him hither brought.” the King commanded Knights 3, he said, “goe feitch yond gentleman to me that is now at his play; looke noe ill words with him yee breake, but pray him with me for to speake; I trow he will not say nay.” Euerye knight his steed hent, &amp; lightlye to the wood thé went to seeke Tryamore that child. thé found him by a water side where he brake the beast that tyde, that hart that was soe wylde. thé said, “Sir! god be at your game!” he answered them euen the same; then was he frayd of guile. “Sir Knight!” they said, “is itt your will to come &amp; speake our King vntill with word[e]s meeke &amp; mylde?” Tryamore asked shortlye, “what hight your King, tell yee mee, that is lord of this land?” “this Land hight Arragon, &amp; our King, Arradas, with crowne; his place his heire att hand.” Tryamore went vnto the K[ing,] &amp; he was glad of his cominge, he knew him att first sight; the King tooke him by the hand, &amp; said, “welcome into this land!” &amp; asked him what he hight. “Sir, my name is Tryamore; once you helpt me in a stowre as a noble man of might; &amp; now I am here in thy Land; soe was I neuer erst, as I vnderstand, by god full of might.” when the King wist it was hee, his hart reioced greatlye; 3 times he did downe fall, &amp; [said] “Tryamore, welcome to me! great sorrowe &amp; care I haue had for thee;” and he told him all; “with the Emperour I tooke a day [to] defend me if that I may; to Iesu I will call; for I neuer his sonne slew; god he knoweth I speake but true, &amp; helpe me I trust he shall!” then said Tryamore thoe, [“I am fulle woe] that you for me haue beene greeued soe, if I might it amend; &amp; att the day of battell I trust to proue my might as well, if god will grace me send.” then was King Arradas very glad, and of Marradas was not adread: when he to the batteile shold wend, he ioyed that he shold well speed, for Tryamore was warry at neede against his enemye to defend. there Tryamore dwelled with the King many a weeke without lettinge; he lacked right nought. &amp; when the day of battayle was came, the Emperour with his men hasted full soone, &amp; manye wonder thought; he brought thither both King &amp; Knight; &amp; Marradas, that was of might, to batteille he him brought. there was many a seemelye man, moe then I tell you can; of them all he ne wrought. both partyes that ilke day into the feeld tooke the way, they were already dight. the King there kissed Tryamore, &amp; sayd, “I make thee mine [heyre] this hower, &amp; dubb thee a knight.” “Sir,” said Tryamore, “take no dread; I trust Iesus will me speede, for you be in the right; therfore through gods grace I will fight for you in this place with the helpe of our Lords might!” both partyes were full swore to hold the promise that was made before; to Iesus can hee call. Sir Tryamore &amp; Sir Marradas both well armed was amonge the Lords all; eche of them were sett on steede; all men of Tryamore had dreede, that was soe hind in all. Marradas was stiffe &amp; sure, their might noe man his stroake endure, But that he made them fall. then rode they together full right; with sharpe speres &amp; swords bright they smote together sore; thé spent speres &amp; brake sheelds, thé busled fowle in middest the feelds, either fomed as doth a bore. all thé wondred that beheld how thé fought in the feeld; there was but a liffe. Marradas fared fyer wood because Tryamore soe long stood; sore gan hee smite. Sir Tryamore fayled of Marradas, that sword lighted vpon his horsse, the sword to ground gan light. Marradas said, “it is great shame on a steed to wreake his game! thou sholdest rather smite mee!” Tryamore swore, “by gods might I had leuer it had on thee light! then I wold not be sorye; “but here I giue thee steede mine because I haue slaine thine; by my will it shalbe soe.” Marradas sayd, “I will [him] nought till I haue him with stroakes bought,” [and won him from my foe.] &amp; Tryamore lighted from his horsse, &amp; to Marradas straight he goes, for both on foote they did light. Sir Tryamore spared him nought, [But evyr in his hert he thoght] “this day was I made a Knight!” &amp; thought that hee himselfe wold be slaine soone, “or else of him I will win my shoone throughe gods might.” thé laid eche at other with good will with sharpe swords made of steele; that saw many a knight. great wonder it was to behold the stroakes that was betwixt them soe bold; all men might it see. thé were weary, &amp; had soe greatlye bled; Marradas was sore adread, he fainted then greatlye; &amp; that Tryamore lightlye beheld, &amp; fought feerclye in the feeld; he stroke Marradas soe sore that the sword through the body ran. then was the Emperour a sorry man; he made thenn peace for euer-more; he kissed the King, &amp; was his freind, &amp; tooke his leauee homewards to wend; noe longer there dwell wold hee. then King Arradas &amp; Tryamore went to the palace with great honor, into that rych citye. there was ioy without care, &amp; all they had great welfare, there might no better bee; they hunted &amp; rode many a where, full great pleasure they had there. among the knights of price the King profered him full fayre, &amp; sayd, “Tryamore, Ile make thee mine heyre, for thou art strong &amp; wise.” Sir Tryamore said, “Sir, trulye into other countryes goe will I; I desire of you but a steed, &amp; to other lands will I goe some great aduentures for to doe, thus will I my liffe lead.” the King was verry sorry tho; when that hee wold from him goe, he gaue him a sure weede, &amp; plenty of siluer &amp; gold, &amp; a steed as hee wold, that nothing wold feare. hee tooke his leaue of the King, And mourned at his departing, then hasted he him there; the King sayd, “Tryamor! that is mine, when thou list it shall be thine, all my kingdome lesse &amp; more.” Now is Tryamore forth goe; Lords &amp; ladyes were full woe, euerye man loued him there. Tryamore rode in hast trulye into the Land of Hungarye, aduentures for to seeke. betweene 2 mountaines, the sooth to say, he rode forth on his way; with a palmer he did meete; he asked almes for gods sake, &amp; Tryamore him not forgate, he gaue him with words sweete. the palmer said, “turne yee againe, or else I feare you wilbe slaine; you may not passe but you be beat.” Tryamore asked “why soe?” “Sir,” he said, “there be brethren towe that on the mountaine dwells.” “faith,” said Tryamore, “if there be no more, I trust in god that way to goe, if this be true that thou tells.” he bade the palmer good day, &amp; rode forth on his way ouer heath &amp; feelds; the palmer prayed to him full fast, Tryamore was not agast, he blew his horne full shrill. he had not rydden but a while, not the Mountenance of a mile, 2 knights he saw on a hill: the one of them to him gan ryde, they other still gan abyde a litle there beside. &amp; when thé did Tryamore spye, thé said, “turne thee traytor, or thou shalt dye, therfore stand &amp; abyde!” either againe other gan ryd fast, theire strokes mad their speres to brast, &amp; made them wounds full wyde. the other knight that honed soe, wondred that Tryamore dared soe: he rode to them that tyde &amp; departed them in twaine, &amp; to speake fayre he began to fraine with words that sounded well: to Tryamore he sayd anon, “a doughtyer Knight I neuer saw none! thy name that thou vs tell.” Tryamore said, “first will I wett why that you doe keepe this street, &amp; where that you doe dwell.” thé said, “wee had a brother hight Marradas, with the Emperour forsooth he was, a stronge man well I-know. in Arragon, before the Emperour, a knight called Sir Tryamore in battel there him slew; “&amp; alsoe wee say another, Burlong our elder brother, as a man of much might; he hath beseeged soothlye the Kings daughter of Hungarye; to wed her he hath height; “&amp; soe well hee hath sped that hee shall that Lady wedd but shee may find a Knight that Burlonge ouercome may; to that they haue tooke a day, wage battel &amp; fight; “for that same Tryamore loued that Ladye paramoure, as it is before told; if he will to Hungarye, needs must he come vs by; to meete with him wee wold.” Tryamore said, “I say not nay, but my name I will tell this day, in faith I will not Laine: thinke your Iourney well besett, for with Tryamore you haue mett that your brother hath slaine.” “welcome!” thé said, “Tryamore! his death shalt thou repent sore; thy sorrow shall begin. yeeld thee to vs anon, for thou shalt not from vs gone by noe manner of gin.” thé smote feircly att him tho, &amp; Tryamore against them 2 without more delay. Sir Tryamore proued him full prest, he brake their spere on their brest, hee had such assay; his sheeld was broken in peeces 3, his horsse was smitten on his knee, soe hard att him thé thrust. Sir Tryamore was then right wood, &amp; slew the one there as he stood with his sword full prest. that other rode his way, his hart was in great affray, yet he turned againe that tide,— when Tryamore had slaine his brother, a sorry man then was the other,— &amp; straight againe to him did rydde; then they 2 sore foughte that the other to the ground was brought then were thé both slaine. tho the Ladye on Tryamore thought, for of him shee knew right nought, shee wist not what to say. the day was come that was sett, the Lords assembled without lett, all in good array. Burlonge was redye dight, he bade the Lady send the Knight. shee answered “I ne may:” for in that castle shee had hight to keepe her with all her might, as the story doth say. thé said, “if Tryamore be aliue, hither will hee come blithe; god send vs good grace to speed!” with that came in Sir Tryamore in the thickest of that stower, into the feild without dread. he asked ‘what all that did meane.’ the people shewed that a battel there shold beene for the loue of that Ladye. he saw Burlong on his steede, &amp; straight to him he yeede; that Ladye challengeth hee. Burlong asked him if he wold fight. Tryamore said, “with all [my] might to slay thee, or thou me.” anon thé made them readye, &amp; none there knew him sikerlye, thé wondred what he shold bee. high on a tower stood that good Ladye; shee knew not what Knight verelye that with Burlong did fight. fast shee asked of her men ‘if that Knight they cold ken that to battell was dight; ‘a griffon he beareth all of blew.’ a herald of armes soone him knew, &amp; said anon-right, “Madame! god hath sent you succor; for yonder is Tryamore That with Burlong will fight.” to Iesus gan the Ladye pray for to speed him on his Iourney that hee about yeed. then those Knights ran together, the speres in peeces gan shiuer, thé fought full sore indeed; there was noe man in the feild tho who shold haue the better of them tow, soe mightilye they did them beare. the Battel lasted wonderous long; though Burlong was neuer soe stronge, there found he his peere. Tryamore a stroke to him mint, his sword fell downe at that dint out of his hand him froe. then was Burlong verry glad, &amp; the Ladye was verry sad, &amp; many more full woe. Tryamore asked his sword againe, but Burlong gan him fraine to know first his name; &amp; said, “tell me first what thou hight, &amp; why thou challengeth the Ladye bright, then shalt thou haue thy sword againe.” Tryamore sayd, “soe mote I thee, My name I will tell trulye, therof I will not doubt; men call me Sir Tryamore, I wan this Ladye in a stowre among Barrons stout.” then said Burlong, “thou it was that slew my brother Marradas! a faire hap thee befell!” Sir Tryamore sayd to him tho, “soe haue I done thy Brethren 2 that on the Mountaines did dwell.” Burlong said, “woe may thou bee, for thou hast slaine my brethren 3! sorrow hast thou sought! thy sword getts thou neuer againe till I be avenged, &amp; thou slaine; now I am well bethought!” Sir Tryamore sayd, “noe force tho, thou shalt repent it ere thou goe; doe forth! I dread thee nought!” Burlong to smite was readye bowne, his feete slipt, &amp; hee fell downe, &amp; Tryamore right well nought, his sword lightlye he vp hent, &amp; to Burlonge fast he went; for nothing wold he flee; &amp; as he wold haue risen againe, he smote his leggs euen in twaine hard fast by the knee. Tryamore bade him “stand vpright, &amp; all men may see now in fight wee beene meete of a size.” Sir Tryamore suffered him to take another weapon, as a knight of much prize. Burlong on his stumpes stood as a man that was nye wood, &amp; fought wonderous hard. &amp; Sir Tryamore strake stroakes sure, for he cold well endure; of him hee was not affrayd, &amp; vnder his ventale his head he smote of without fayle; with that in peeces his sword brast. Now is Burlong slaine, &amp; Triamore with maine into the Castle went, to the Ladye that was full bright; &amp; att the gates shee mett the Knight, &amp; in her armes shee him hent. Shee said, “welcome sir Tryamore! for you haue bought my loue full deere, my hart is on you lent!” then said all the Barrons bold, “of him wee will our lands hold;” &amp; therto they did assent. there is noe more to say, but they haue taken a certaine day that they both shalbe wed. Sir Tryamore for his mother sent, a Messenger for her went, &amp; into the castle he[r] led. Tryamore to his mother gan saine, “my father I wold know faine, sith I haue soe well sped.” shee said, “King Arraydas of Arragon, is thy father, &amp; thou his owne sonne; I was his wedded Queene; “a leasing was borne me in hand, &amp; falsely fleamed me out of his land by a traitor Keene, Sir Marrockee thé hight: he did me woe, &amp; Sir Rodger my knight he did sloe, that my guide shold haue beene.” &amp; when that Tryamore all heard, &amp; how his mother shee had sayd, letters he made &amp; wrought; he prayd King Arradas to come him till, if that it were his will, thus he him besought: ‘if hee will come into Hungarye for his Manhood &amp; his Masterye, &amp; that he wold fayle in nought.’ then was King Arradas verry glad; the Messengers great guifts had for they tydings that they brought. the day was come that was sett, the Lords came thither without let, &amp; ladyes of great pryde; then wold they noe longer lett; shortlye after they are fett, with 2 dukes on euerye side; they lady to the church thé led; a Bishopp them together did wed, in full great hast thé hyed. soone after that weddinge Sir Tryamore was crowned King, they wold noe longer abyde. the Queene, his mother Margarett, before the King shee was sett in a goodlye cheare. King Arradas beheld his Queene, him thought that hee had her seene, shee was a ladye fayre; the King said, “it is your will your name me for to tell, I pray you with words fayre.” “my Lord,” sayd [she,] “I was your Queene; your steward did me ill teene; that euill might him befalle!” the King spake noe more words till the clothes were drawen from the bords, &amp; men rose in the hall. &amp; by the hand he tooke the Queene gent; soe in the chamber forth he went, &amp; there shee told him all. then was there great Ioy &amp; blisse! when they together gan kisse, then all they companye made Ioy enough. the younge Queene [was] full glad that shee a Kings sonne to her Lord had, shee was glad, I trowe; in Ioy together lead their liffe all their dayes without striffe, &amp; liued many a fayre yeere. Then king Arradas &amp; his Queene had ioy enough them betweene, &amp; merrilye liued together. &amp; thus wee leaue of Tryamore that liued long in great honor with the fayre Hellene. I pray god giue their soules good rest, &amp; all that haue heard this litle Iest, highe heauen for to win! god grant vs all to haue that grace, him for to see in the celestyall place! I pray you all to say Amen! ffins.</field>

Sir Degree [The First Part.] Lordings, &amp; you will hold you still, a gentle tale I will you tell, all of knights of this countrye the which haue trauelled beyond the sea, as did a knight called Sir Degree, one of the best was ffound him before. that time in England dwelled a King, a stout man in manners and all thinge, both in Armour and on the sheeld he was much doubted in battell &amp; in ffeild. there was noe man in verament that Iusted with him in turnament that out of his stirropps might stirr his ffoote, he was soe strong without doubt. the King had no more Children but one, a daughter white as whales bone; that mayd hee loued as his liffe; her mother was dead, the Queene his wiffe; in trauell of Chyld shee dyed, alas! &amp; when this mayd of age was, Kings sonnes her wooed then, Emperoures, Dukes, &amp; other men, for to haue had her in Marryage for loue of her great heritage. but then they King he made answer, “that neuer man hee shold wedd her with-out hee might with stout Iustinge the King out of his sadle bringe, to make him loose his stirropps too. many one assayd, &amp; cold not doe; but euery yeere, as right itt wold, a great ffeast the King did hold vpon his Queenes mourning day, the which was buryed in an abbey. soe vpon a day the King wold ryde vnto an abbey there besyde, to a dirges &amp; masses both, the pore to ffeed, &amp; the naked to cloth. his owne daughter shee with him rode, &amp; in the fforrest shee still abode, &amp; sayd, ‘downe shee must light, better her clothes to amend right.’ a-downe they be light all three her damsells, &amp; soe did shee. a ffull long stond they there abode till all they men away rode. They gatt vp, &amp; after they wold, but they cold not they right way hold; the wood was roughe &amp; thicke I-wis, &amp; they tooke their way all amisse. they rode south, they rode west, vnto the thicke of that fforrest, &amp; vnto a bane thé came att Last. then varryed they wonderous ffast, ffor thé wist amisse they had gone, &amp; downe thé light euery one. the wheather was hott affore none; thé wist not what was best ffor to haue done, but layd them downe vpon the greene. some of them ffell on sleepe, as I weene, &amp; thus they fell on sleepe euerye one sauing the Kings daughter alone, &amp; shee went fforth to gather fflowers &amp; to heare the song of the small ffowles. soe long shee did fforth passe till that shee wist not where itt was. then can shee cry wonderous sore, shee weeped &amp; wrange her hands thore, &amp; sayes, “alacke that I was borne! her in this fforrest I am fforlorne, &amp; wilde beasts will me rende or any man may mee ffind!” they way to her damsells shee wold haue came, but shee wist not how to come. then shee was ware of a Ioyfull sight: a-fore her there stood a ffayre Knight that was wellfauored of ffoote &amp; hand; there [was] not such a one in all the Land; &amp; by the rich clothing that hee had on, hee seemed to be a gentleman. soe stout a man then was hee, he sayes, “Madam, god yee see! be yee dread arright of nought; I haue noe armour with me brought, but I haue loued you this many a yeere, &amp; now that I haue ffound you here you shall bee my Lemman ere I goe, whether itt turnes to wayle or woe.” but then no more adoe cold shee, but wept and cryed, and cold not fflee. anon he began her to behold, &amp; he did with her whatsoeuer hee wold, &amp; there hee bereft her of her maydenhead. &amp; right before her the Knight stoode: &amp; hee sayes, “Madam gentle &amp; ffree, now with child, Madam, I doe thinke you bee, &amp; well I wott hee will be a knaue; therfore my good sword he shall haue, my sword heere vpon my hand, therewith the Last I did kill a Gyant, &amp; I brake the poynt of itt in his head, &amp; here in the fforrest I haue him Layd. take itt vp now, dame, ffor itt is heere; thou speakes not with mee this many a yeere; yett peraduenture they time may come that I may speake with my owne sonne, &amp; by this sword I may him ken.” hee kist his loue, &amp; went then; the knight passed as hee come. all weeping the Ladye the sword vp nume, &amp; shee went fforth sore weeping, &amp; there shee ffound her mayds sleeping. shee hid the sword as well as shee might, &amp; called them vp anon-right, &amp; tooke their horsses euerye one, &amp; began to ryde fforth anon. then they were ware att the Last, many a Knight came pricking ffast; ffrom they King they were sent to witt which way his daughter went. they brought them into the right way, &amp; rodden ffayre vnto the Abbey. there was done service and all thinge, with many a Masse, with rich offeringe; &amp; when these masses were all done, &amp; come to passe the hye noone, the King to his pallace did ryde, And much people by his syde, &amp; after, euery man was glad &amp; blythe. this Ladye swooned many a sithe, &amp; euer her belly waxed more &amp; more; shee weeped &amp; wrang her hands ffull sore. soe vpon a day shee can sore weepe, &amp; a mayd of hers tooke good heede &amp; said, “Madam, ffor S?.

[The Second Part.] Then sayes Degree, “I will not blinne till I haue ffound my ffather or some of my kinne.” “to seeke thy kinne thou mayst not endure without horsse or good armour.” then sayd Degree, “by St. Iohn, horsse nor harnesse Ile haue none, but a good bitter in my hand, mine enemyes therewith to withstand, A full good sapline of an oke; &amp; home therewith Ist sett a str[o]ke,— haue hee neuer soe good armour him on, or be hee neuer soe tall a man,— I shall him ffell to the ground with this same batt in that stond.” the Child kissed the hermitt thoe, &amp; alsoe tooke his leaue to goe. fforth went Degree, the sooth to say, throughout a fforrest halfe a day; he heard noe man, nor saw none, till itt passed the hye noone; then heard hee great stroakes ffall that made great noyse withall. ffull soone he thought that thing to see, to witt what the stroakes might bee. there was an Erle stout &amp; gay was come thither that same day to hunt ffor a deere or a doe, but his hounds were gone him ffroe. &amp; there was a Dragon ffeirce and grim, ffull of ffyer &amp; alsoe of venim, with a wyde throate, &amp; tushes great, vpon the Erle can he beate; &amp; as a Lyon were his ffeete; his tayle was long &amp; ffull vnmeete; betweene his head &amp; his tayle 22 ffoote without ffayle. his belly was like a whole tunn, itt shone ffull bright againe the ssunn. His eyen as bright as any glasse, his scales as hard as anye brasse; &amp; therto hee was necked like a horsse, &amp; bare his head vpp with great fforce; hee was to looke on, as I you tell, as thoe hee had beene a ffeende of hell; many man hee had shent, &amp; many a horsse hee had rent; &amp; to this Erle hard battell he began, but hee defended him like a man, &amp; boldlye stroke on him with his sword; but of his stroakes he was not affeard, ffor his skin was as hard as anye stone, where-ffore hee cold him noe harme done. &amp; when the Erle degree see, he sayd “helpe, ffor Charytye!” then answered Sir Degore, “gladlye!” he sayes, and god before. when the dragon of Degree had a sight, hee left the Erle, &amp; came to him right. then the Child that was soe younge tooke his staffe that was soe stronge, &amp; smote the dragon on the crowne that in the wood hee ffell downe. the dragon recouered anon-right, &amp; hitt the Child with such might with his tayle in that tyde, that hee ffell downe vpon his side. then degree recouered anon-right, &amp; defended him with much might; with his staffe that was soe longe he broke of him ffoote and bone that itt was wonder ffor to see. hee was soe taughe hee might not dye, yett hee hitt him on the crowne soe hye that hee made his braines out fLye. then the Erle was glad &amp; blythe, &amp; thanked Degree often sithe, &amp; he prayed him hee wold with him ryde vnto the pallace there beside; &amp; there he made him a Knight, &amp; made him good cheere that night; rents, tresure, &amp; halfe of his Land hee wold haue seized into his hand, &amp; alsoe his daughter to be his wiffe, &amp; all his lands after his liffe. &amp; then Sir Degree thanked him hartilye, and prayed him, “of his curtesye to lett his women affore him come, wiues, mayds, more and some, &amp; alsoe your daughter eke; &amp; if my gloues be ffor them meete, or will vpon of any of their hands, then wold I be ffaine to take my Lands; &amp; if my gloues will not doe soe, I will take my leaue and goe.” all the women were out brought that thereabout might be sought, &amp; all assayd the gloues then, but they were ffitt for no woman. Sir Degree tooke his gloues thoe, &amp; alsoe tooke his leaue to goe. the Erle hee was a Lord of gentle blood, hee gaue Sir Degree a steede ffull good, &amp; therto gaue him good armour which was ffaire and sure, &amp; alsoe a page his man to bee, &amp; a hackney to ryde on trulye. then fforth went Sir Degree, the sooth to say, many a mile vpon a summers day. soe vpon a day much people he mett; he houed still, &amp; ffayre them grett; he asked the squier what tydinge, &amp; wence came all those people rydinge. the squier answered verament, he sayd, “they came ffrom the parlament. &amp; when they parlaiment was most planere, the King lett cry both farr &amp; nere ‘If any man durst be soe bold As with the King Iust wold, he shold haue his daughter in marryage, &amp; all his lands &amp; his herytage.’ itt is a land good and ffayre, &amp; the king thereto hath no heyre. certaine no man dare grant thereto; many a man assayd, &amp; might not doe, for there is no man that rides to him but hee beates them with stroakes grim; of some hee breakes the necke anon; of some he brakes backe and bone; some through the bodye hee glyds; &amp; some to the death hee smites. vnto him may a man doe nothinge, such a grace euer hath our Kinge.” Sir Degree stood in a study then, &amp; thought hee was a mighty man, “&amp; I am in my younge blood; &amp; I haue horsse &amp; armour goode, &amp; as I trow I haue a good steede; I will assay if I can speede; &amp; if I can beare that King downe, I shalbe a man of great renowne; &amp; if hee mee ffell can, there knowes no body who I am.” thus in the Citye his inne he takes; he rested him, &amp; merry makes. soe on a day the King hee mett, he kneeled downe, &amp; faire him grett, &amp; sayd, “my Lord, thou King of much might! my Lord hath sent mee to thee right to warne you how itt must bee: my Lord will come &amp; ffight with yee; to Iust with thee my Lord hath nomm.” the King sayd, “hee shalbe welcome, be hee Knight or Barrowne, Erle, duke, or Churle in towne: theres no man Ile fforsake; who all may winn, all let him take.” soe on the Morrow the day was sett, the King aduised much the bett, but there was not any liuing man that Sir Degree trusted vpon; but to the church that day went hee to heare a Masse to the trinitye; &amp; to the ffather hee offered a ffloren, &amp; to the sonne another ffine; the 3?. to the holy ghost hee offered; the preist in his masse ffor him hee prayed. &amp; when the Masses were done, vnto his inne hee went ffull soone, where hee did arme him well indeed in rich armor good att need. his good steed he began to stryde; he tooke his speare, &amp; fforth gan ryde. his man tooke another spere, and after his Master did itt beare: thus in the ffeild Sir Degree abode then, &amp; the King came with many men. [The Third Part.] Many came thither readylye ffor to see their iusting trulye; &amp; all that euer in the ffeild were, they sayd &amp; did sweare that ‘ere that time thé neuer see soe ffayre a man with their eye as was that younge Knight Sir Degree;’ but no man wist ffrom wence came hee. They rode together att the last vpon their good steeds ffull ffast: to dashe him downe he had meant, &amp; in his sheild sett such a dint that his good speare all to-brast; but Sir Degree was strong, &amp; sate fast. then sayd the King, “alas, alas! this is a wonderffull case. there was neuer man that I might hitt that might euer my stroake sitt! this is a man ffor the nones! he is a man of great bones!” they rode together then with great randome, &amp; he had thaught to haue smitten the child downe, &amp; he hitt Sir Degree soone anon Right vpon the brest bone, that his horsse was reared on hye, &amp; Sir Degree he was ffallen nye, &amp; yett Sir Degree his course out yode, &amp; waxed angrye in his moode; he sayd, “alacke! I haue mist yett, and hee hath mee twyse hitt; by god I will aduise better, I will not long be his debtor!” then they rode together with much might, &amp; in their shields their speres pight; &amp; in their sheelds their speres all to-broke vnto their hands with that stroke. &amp; then the King began to speake, “giue me a speare that will not breake, &amp; he anon shall be smitten downe If hee were as strong as Sampson. &amp; if hee bee the devill of hell, I shall him downe ffell; &amp; if his necke will not in too, his backe shall, ere I doe goe.” the King tooke a spere stiffe &amp; strong, &amp; Sir Degree another strong &amp; longe, &amp; stoutlye to the King hee smitt. [The] King ffayled; Sir Degree him hitt, he made the Kings horsse turne vp his ffeete, &amp; soe Sir Degree him beate. then there was much noyse &amp; crye; the King was sore ashamed welnye, &amp; well I wott his daughter was sorrye, ffor then shee wist that shee must marrye vntill a man of a strange countrye the which before shee neuer see, &amp; to lead her liue with such a one that shee neuer wist ffrom whence hee came. the King sayd then to Sir Degore, “come hither, my ffayre sonne, me before, ffor if thou were as a gentle a man as thou art seeming to looke vpon, &amp; if thou coldest witt &amp; reason doe as thou art doughtye man too, I wold thinke my Lands well besett if itt were 5 times bett; ffor words spoken I must needs hold. afore my Barrons that beene soe bold, I take thee my daughter by the hand, &amp; I cease thee into my Land to be my heyre after mee, in Ioy and blisse ffor to bee.” great ordinance then there was wrought, &amp; to the church dore they were brought, &amp; there were wedd in verament vnto the holy Sacrament. &amp; looke what ffolly hapened there! that he shold marry his owne mother, the which had borne him of her syde! &amp; hee knew nothing that tyde; shee knew nothing of his kinne, nor yett shee knew nothing of him, but both together ordayned to bed, yet peraduenture they might be sibb. this did Sir Degree the bold, hee weded her to haue &amp; hold. itt passed on the hye time of noone, &amp; the day was almost done; to bed were brought hee and shee with great myrth and solempnytye. Sir Degree stood &amp; behold then, &amp; thought on the hermitt, the holy man, that hee shold neuer [wed] ffor-thy neither wydow nor Ladye with-out shee might the gloues doe lightlye on her hands towe. “alacke!” then sayes Sir Degree, “the time that euer I borne shold bee!” &amp; sayd anon with heauy cheere, “rather then all my Kingdome heere that is now ceazed into my hands, That [I were fayre out of this lande.”] the King these words hard thoe, &amp; sayes, “my sonne, why sayst thou soe? is there ought against thy will either done or sayd, that doe thee ill, or any man that hath misdoone? tell mee, &amp; itt shall be amended soone.” “no, Lord,” sayes degree then, “but for this marryage done has beene. I will not with no woman meddle, neither wiffe, widdow, nor damsell, without shee may these gloues doe Lightly vpon her hands tow.” &amp; when they Lady can that heere, anon shee changed all her cheere, for shee knew that the gloues longed to her, &amp; sayes, “giue me the gloues, fayre Sir.” shee tooke the gloues in that steede, &amp; lightly vpon her hands them did. then shee fell downe &amp; began to cry; says, “Lord god, I aske thee mercy! I am the mother that did you beare, &amp; you are mine owne sonne deere!” Sir Degree tooke her vp thoe ffull lightly in his armes towe. then either of other were ffull blythe, &amp; kissed together many a sithe. the King of them had much marueile, &amp; at the noyse without fayle, &amp; was abashed of their weepinge. “daughter! what meanes this thing?” “father,” shee sayd, “will you itt heere? you wend that I a mayden were. no, truly, ffather, I am none! for itt is 20 winters a-gone. this is my sonne, god doth know, &amp; by these gloues see itt, Lowe!” shee told him altogether there how hee was begotten of her. &amp; then bespake Sir Degree, “O sweet mother!” sayd hee, “where is my fathers wooninge, or when heard you of him any tydinge?” “sonne,” shee sayd, “by heauen Kinge I can tell you of him noe tydinge. but when thy father from me went, a poyntles sword he me Lent, &amp; hee charged me to keepe itt then till that time thow wert a man.” shee feicth the sword anon tho, &amp; Sir degree itt out drew: Long &amp; broad itt was, pardye; there was not such a one in that country. “now truly,” sayes Degree then, “hee that weelded itt was a man! but if god of heauen hee may keepe, night nor day I will not sleepe till that time I may my father see, in Christendome if that hee bee.” [The Fourth Part.] He made [him merry that ilk night,] &amp; on the morrow when itt was day light hee went to the Chirch to heare a masse, &amp; made him ready for to passe. the King sayd, “my next kinne, I will giue thee Knights with thee to winne.” “Gramercy, Lord,” sayes Degree then, “but with me shall goe no other man But my knaue that may take heede of my armour &amp; of my steede.” hee leapt on his horsse, the sooth to say, &amp; forthe he rode on his Iourney. many a mile &amp; many a way hee rode forth on his palfrey, &amp; euermor hee rode west vntil hee came to [a] forrest. there wild beasts came him by, &amp; Fowles song therto merrely. they rode soe Long that itt grew to night; they sun went downe, &amp; fayled light. soone after thé found a castell cleere,— a Lady truly dwelled there,— a fayre Castle of lime &amp; stone, but other towne there was none.
