      <field name="fulltext">As the plough'd Furrows of the fruitful Field, Among the Corn, do Weeds and Thistles yield: So thorny Cares, as well as soothing Joys, In spite of Love, in Wedlock will arise. Here both lie open to the Reader's view: If marry'd, he may find the Author true.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">[The First Volume] Grant me, O Heav'n! Good Humour still to please My Wife, so long as she consults my Ease; But, give me courage, if she provs a shrew, To scorn what none could ever yet subdue. TO THE Worthy Gentlemen of the County and Corporation of Leicester. DIALOGUE I. Between a surly Husband, and condescending Wife. Husband. Here, Wife, lets' see my Slippers, Cap and Gown; Help off my Coat. Z?s, Madam, how you frown, As if, thro' Pride, you thought your self too good T'attend your Husband as a Woman shou'd? Wife. My Dear, what makes you think so, when you find None can be more obliging, none more kind? Am I not always ready to obey? Or do I contradict whate'er you say? But nimbly run at your Commands, as if I was your Servant, rather than your Wife; Yet all my diligent Endeavours seem Too negligent to merit your Esteem. Husband. 'Tis true, that you obey what I command, But still 'tis done with an unwilling Hand; A sullen Pride does on your Brows appear, And shews you humble not thro' Love, but Fear, As if your seeming Readiness to please, Was for your own bye-Int'rest, and your Ease, And not th'Effect of Duty which you owe, Or that Affection which a Wife should show; Therefore you only do what you repent, Because you act without the Mind's Consent; For ev'ry Look, when you obey, betrays Your Person and your Will move diff'rent ways. Wife. My Dear, my humble Temper you mistake, And from your own this rash Construction make. Those who with Jaundice Eyes behold the Dame That's fair, conceit her tinctur'd with the same. Tis true, when peevish, you command me to What's fitter for a servile Drudge to do, 'Than for a lawful Wife, yet I obey Your harsh Commands without the least Delay; Tho' your Injunctions often seem severe, From whence, you being conscious that you err, Fansy I scornfully perform that Act, Which is in you ill Nature to exact, Well knowing 'tis unmanly to impose Upon a Wife, who so much Temper shows, And that she justly may refuse a Task Which is in you tyrannical to ask; Therefore you think I've but a slender Mind T'oblige, because you know your self unkind, And that, alas! you do too oft require Things barb'rous for a Husband to desire. Husband. Wives, Madam Pert, are in a servile State, Should silently obey, and never prate. 'Tis Insolence to frown, or knit your Brows, And bold Rebellion to upbraid your Spouse. Man from his Maker sov'reign Power derives, And ought to reign in Triumph o'er his Wives; Many he was allow'd, when they were such That would obey, but one is now too much. Women are spoil'd since Men so fond are grown, The Subject now usurps the nuptial Throne, And doating Man, by Nature born to rule, Is made, by Love, his Woman's servile Tool, Must give the haughty Minx the upper hand, And for his Ease obey his Wife's Command, Flatter the Gipsy to improve her Pride, And stoop to her o'er whom he should preside: But I'll be no such Foe to human Race, I'll keep my Pow'r, and make you know your Place: I scorn, by such Examples, to betray Others to bend to those that should obey. Husbands and Kings should be alike severe; 'Tis Vertue in 'em both to be austere; For we, alas! by long Experience find Both are ill us'd if lenitive and kind; Despis'd, oppos'd, involv'd in endless Strife, One by his Subjects, t'other by his Wife; Therefore expect I'll ever bear the Sway, And prove a Tyrant, if you disobey. Wife. I own, my Dear, you have a native Right To rule, and 'tis my Duty to submit, That ev'ry Wife should true Allegiance own To 'er lawful Spouse, as Subjects to the Throne; But still a Husband's Pow'r may be misus'd, And vertuous Wives, by their Commands, abus'd; Be basely injur'd, slighted, and opprest, Thro' the false Motives of a jealous Breast, Tho' their whole Lives have been a Scene of Care, And prudent Circumspection not to err; Therefore 'tis hard, in such a wretched Case, Vertue, thus highly wrong'd, should want Redress. Kingdoms, we see, when Princes do exert Their sov'reign Power to their own Subjects Hurt, Will use their utmost Diligence to free Themselves from a tyrannick Slavery, And think it Justice to restrain that Pow'r, Which ceases to protect, and would devour; Therefore, since you this Parallel have made, That Husband's like to Kings should be obey'd, Why have not Wives, when they're abus'd, as well As injur'd Subjects, Title to rebel? Husband. The Husband's wedded to his servile Wife By Heav'n, as Kings are to their Thrones for Life. When thus united, all Men are forbid To break those Bonds that God himself has ty'd, The Wife accepts her Husband as her Lord, Is bound to hon'r 'im, and obey his Word; And sins, whenever she his Will withstands, Or makes herself the Judge of his Commands: None but the prating, proud, rebellious Shrow, Presumes to dictate what her Spouse should do, Or will, thro' Pride, contentiously dispute Her Husband's Pow'r, which should be absolute. A prudent Wife a willing Temper shows, Comes when she's call'd, and when commanded goes, Does with Submission his Desires fulfil, And asks no Reasons, but obeys his Will, Knowing her Duty is to humbly bend, And ne'er to murmur, cavil, or contend; For Wives and Subjects, when they durst oppose Their lawful Sov'reign, or their lawful Spouse, Both to deter the rest from like Offence, Ought to be punish'd for their Insolence. Wife. I'm willing to obey; but yet, my Dear, Methinks you ought not to be so severe: Woman's the weaker Vessel, and by Chance May give some small Offence thro' Ignorance. Such little Slips and Failings should not move A Husband's Anger, or impair his Love. Things may be taken ill, not ill design'd, Or the Tongue err abstracted from the Mind; And Faults, methinks, without the Will's Consent, Cannot in Justice merit Punishment. Husband. Th'obedient Wife is careful how to please, Her only Study is her Husband's Ease; For should she do by Chance what seems unkind, How should we know but she the Slight design'd? Men judge of things as they appear to be, In friendly Actions we your Kindness see; But when a Wife shall disrespectful prove, Her Pouts and Slights betray her Want of Love: If when you talk, your Tongue should make a Trip, And from your Mouth offensive Words should slip, The close Repentance that pursues behind, Shews that the Lips have vary'd from the Mind; For then no sooner is the Sentence spoke, But you beg Pardon that it mayn't provoke, And by a quick Atonement, let us see, Tho' your Tongue err'd, that still your Mind was free; But if you still continue to offend, And when you know you should submit, contend: To plead such Errors are against the Will, Is but a farther Provocation still, That gives us Cause to think you run astray, And hate the Man you care not to obey. If therefore you would merit my Esteem, And make me love and prize you as a Gem, Think not your Lilly Hand too white to do The meanest Thing that I command you to, But wave your Frowns, abandon female Pride, Lay all your stately Vanity aside, Forget your Beauty, Fortune, and your Birth, Boast not your Parents Quality or Worth, But let my Presence keep your Heart in Awe, And my Commands be valid as a Law; Then a respectful Husband shall I prove, When by your Duty you confirm your Love; But if you slight or disregard my Word, And scorn to stoop to your Domestick Lord, I'll strictly guard my Pocket, knit my Brows, And shew a foolish Wife an angry Spouse. Wife. Man has some Reason, if the Wife be cross, To be neglective, slighting, and morose; But when a Woman's kind, to be austere, Argues a Husband's Temper too severe, Gives her just Cause to murmur and complain, That she's ill govern'd with too strait a Rein. Tho' Man's Authority be great when us'd As Tyrants do their Pow'r, 'tis then abus'd; And tho' weak Woman, in so hard a Case Is forc'd to suffer Wrongs without Redress, Yet 'tis inglorious Cruelty and Pride To injure and oppress the weaker Side, Or make your feeble Help-mate fare the worse, Because unable to withstand your Force. However, pray believe, my only Dear, My Vertues are not owing to my Fear; For no ill Usage shall incline my Heart To act a treach'rous, or a stubborn Part; Sense of my Duty is alone the Law That guards my Breast, and keeps my Soul in Awe. My nuptial Vows shall bind me to be true, And steer my faithful Love to none but you; No Frowns or Slights shall ever change my Mind; Tho' you are sordid, I'll be just and kind, And win you by indearing Means, to be As loving and as affable to me; For when the Man, fatigu'd with worldly Toil, Proves Vinegar, the Woman should be Oil. Moral Reflexions on the foregoing Dialogue. [Tho' the Man's surly, proud, perverse] Tho' the Man's surly, proud, perverse, Ill-temper'd as the Devil, The Wife still makes her Fate but worse, That is not kind and civil. She ought to study how to please, And wink at ev'ry Failing; For nothing's gain'd, but farther Tease, By Scolding and by Railing. A Woman's Tongue will ne'er asswage Her Husband's peevish Nature, For tho' he's causeless in a Rage, 'Twill make the Storm the greater. Tis true, it's hard a Wife should bear Those Taunts she does not merit; But who that's wise would snarle or jar, To raise an evil Spirit? For she that foolishly controuls A Man of stubborn Humour, Blows up but those destructive Coals, That may, perhaps, consume her. Therefore the Wife that is perplex'd With Spouse of ill Condition, Ought always, when the Tyrant's vex'd, To shew the most Submission. Dialogue II. Between an extravagant Husband, and a prudent Wife. Wife. Why, my dear Damon, will you waste your Wealth, Beggar your Children, and impair your Health, By daily treating ev'ry idle Guest With riotous Excesses of the best? Why will you cringe to such a worthless Crew Of flatt'ring Fools, where no Respect is due, And with expensive Wines your Cellars fill, That gorging Sots may from your Table reel, Who with stretch'd Bellies quit your nauseous Room To spew your Bounty up 'twixt that and Home? Husband. Tease me not thus, my Dear, perhaps I think There is no other Pleasure, but to drink: Why then, to please a Wife, should I resign These two Delights, good Company and Wine? What, tho' I've Children, must their Father be A Slave to add to their Prosperity, And be a Niggard to my self and Friend, That you and they may have the more to spend? No, Madam, tho' I love both them and you, I shall regard my self a little too, And not abandon that supream Delight, That crowns the Day, and gives me Rest at Night; Nor frown upon my Friends, to please a Wife That would abridge me of the Joys of Life. Wife. But you mistake, my Dear, and fansy those To be your Friends, that are your greatest Foes. Can flatt'ring Spungers, who your Tables fill, At your Expence to gormandize and swill, Who for your Banquets haunt you ev'ry hour, And praise those Dainties which themselves devour; Commend your Wines, which from your Cellars flow, And complement the Vanity you show; Applaud your Bounty to a high Degree, Call your Profuseness Generosity; New subtle Ways amidst their Cups invent, To make you still the more extravagant? But what Returns have your Companions shew'd? What Services perform'd? What Gratitude Have you receiv'd from your expensive Treats Of rich Galicia Wines, and costly Meats? Can any one of those you call your Friends, Who only flatter for their own Bye-Ends, Beneath their slender Circumstance, repay The Obligations of one drunken Day? Are they not careless Sots, and Spend thrifts all, Whose Merits are but low, and Fortunes small, Unworthy of those Favours you bestow, And all th'expensive Friendships which you show? Fie, fie, my Dear, it grieves my Breast to see, Such worthless Fellows should your Ruin be; Nor is it more than what becomes a Wife, To beg a Husband to reform his Life; For nothing less than Mis'ry can attend Such vain Extreams, in the unhappy End. Husband. I cannot but allow, my charming Soul, A Woman may advise, but not controul. I own, that in some Measure I'm to blame, And thou shal't find I'll labour to reclaim; But still there must a happy Union be Betwixt the Bottle, and my Friend, and me. I love a chearful Glass; all other Joys Which many boast of, are to me but Toys; 'Twixt Wine and Friendship I am only blest, Give me but these, the World may take the rest. Wife. Think not, my Dear, that I presume so far As in the least t'ingage you to debar Your self of those Delights you value most, Altho' attended with the greatest Cost: All I entreat, is, that you'd grow more shy Of that bad Company you treat so high, And not be ruin'd by a thankless Crew Of worthless Sycophants, you know not who; Such who are needy, scandalous, and base, Who only fawn and flatter to your Face.; But in your Absence make you but their Sport, And blame your Bounty, tho' it's their Support, Nay, ridicule your Forwardness to do Those very Things that they induce you to; Therefore, my Dear, such Company forbear, And you'll be much more happy than you are: Give o'er your Treats, invite 'em not to dine, Or, if you do, be sparing of your Wine, And I'll engage you'll find your Belly-Friends Will soon forsake you, when they lose their Ends. 'Tis not your Person or your Parts they prize, But that which makes you but appear less wise; 'Tis your Profuseness they alone admire, With hold but that, your Friends will soon retire; Therefore, my Dear, for once, let me advise, If you'd be rid of those you should despise, Keep but the Bottle back, and drunken Friendship dies. Husband. I must confess, my Dear, that I have been Too kind and generous, but now begin To see my Folly, ere it's grown too late, And shall have more Regard to my Estate, Than to be beggar'd; for I own I find My Debts increasing, and my Wealth declin'd. I know 'tis Time I should with hold my Hand, Or I must soon raise Money on my Land; Therefore I thank thee for thy kind Advice, I'll be less generous, and become more wise. Wife. Look on your spritely Son; behold the Boy, Whose lovely Features fill us both with Joy. Is it not hard that such a Babe should come To want that Wealth which thankless Sots consume, And, thro' your vain Exravagance, be glad To be some Lady's Page, or Vintner's Lad? Look on your Daughter, view her charming Face, Where Beauty shines with Innocence and Grace: Is it not Pity that so sweet a Child Should be by Sots and Sycophants beguil'd, And when her Breasts to nuptial Ripeness swell, Should want a Fortune that might match her well? Would it not rend your troubl'd Soul, to see So fair an Offspring doom'd to Drudgery; Or when she's fit for a kind Husband's Arms, Be forc'd, thro' Want, to prostitute her Charms? Consider, Dearest, this must be their Fate, 'Less you're more frugal ere it proves too late; Therefore, my Dear, 'tis not my self I heed, But for your Children that I intercede; Give not your darling Infants cause to curse Your Flatt'rers, nay, their Father, which is worse, When they in Tears dejectedly behold Your Lands and Houses to some Miser sold: Look with Compassion on their tender Years, And put a Stop to all these growing Fears, Then will your self and Family be blest, And Joys, as yet unknown, enrich your Breast: The Gods themselves, who on your Revels frown, Will with a pleasing Aspect then look down, And with their Smiles your Reformation crown. Husband. These Thoughts, my Dearest, make my Heart relent; You've struck so Home I cannot but repent; Nor can I blame you for the Truths you speak, But am concern'd to think my self so weak. I own I love thee, and thy charming Brood, And grieve to think I should neglect their Good; Thy kind Advice has such an Impress made, As if thy Words were Laws to be obey'd; So just thy Counsels, and thy Charge so true, That by their Pow'r I'm chang'd to something new; Am conscious of those Faults which you reprove With so much Prudence, Decency, and Love: Nor shall thy bless'd Endeavours lose their Aim, For thou shalt find that I'll at once reclaim, And from this happy Hour, reform my House From flatt'ring Sots, who at my Charge carouse; And for my dearest Childrens Sake, and thine, No longer be a Slave to vicious Wine; But live reserv'd, and drink a mod'rate Glass With Friends that scorn to be obscene, or base; No vain Delights, with so much Cost, pursue, But still be thoughtful of my Babes and you, And be no more a Bubble to a thirsty Crew. Moral Reflexions on the foregoing Dialogue. [Some Husbands, who, thro' want of Wit] Some Husbands, who, thro' want of Wit, Spur on their own Declension, Think it a Scandal to submit To Female Reprehension: But he that leads a shameful Life, And still pursues his Error, If haypy in a prudent Wife, With Patience ought to hear her: For tho' 'tis Woman's Sphere to mind Their Children and their Houses, Yet spend thrift Sots should think it kind, When counsell'd by their Spouses; Not that if Man should run astray, A Woman must be railing; For scolding is an odious Way, That seldom is prevailing. Ill Words provoke, and not reclaim; 'Tis good Advice in Season, That wins the Spend-thrift to his Dame, And brings him to his Reason. Men have their Failings, tho' they're wise, It is, alas! too common; No Husband therefore should despise Good Counsel from a Woman. Dialogue III. Between a dying Wife, and a profligate Husband. Wife. Now, dear Philander, we shall quickly part, My Eyes grow dim, and Death has seiz'd my Heart: I hope ere long to be for ever bless'd, Where happy Souls by Angels are caress'd, And dwell in Peace above the spangl'd Skies, Where no Disputes or nuptial Jars arise; But where the vertuous Wife shall be secur'd From all those Hardships she on Earth endur'd. My dear Philander, now too late you know 'Tis to your Wrongs that I my Sickness owe; Those fatal Slights, which you so oft have show'd, Have crush'd me down beneath their pond'rous Load. Had you been kind, I might have long surviv'd Th'approaching Hour, and twice my Age have liv'd; But you, alas! have shook the fatal Glass, And now the fleeting Sands pour down apace. Husband. Forgive me, Dear, I own I've been unkind, But let not what is pass'd disturb thy Mind: Chear up thy Spirits, comfort up thy Heart, Thou'rt yet but young, it is too soon to part. I'm sure you will not die this Bout; for Wives, Like Cats, the Wise report, have many Lives; Therefore a Woman's Sickness who would heed? They threaten long before they go indeed. Wife. I know my Pangs cannot affect your Breast, But 'tis a dreadful Season for a Jest: Have Patience, in a little Time you'll see Death will dissolve the Tye, and set you free; My last unhappy Day is fled and gone, No more shall I behold the rising Sun, Or from this cold uncomfortable Bed Of Sorrow, move or raise my dying Head. Feel my slow Pulse, thou stony hearted Man; Behold my Icy Cheeks so pale and wan: Can you believe I have the impious Art To thus dissemble Death in ev'ry Part? O! cruel Wretch, that can forbear to shed One Tear of Sorrow from a shaking Head, Nor warm my frozen Cheeks amidst my Pains With one poor Kiss, whilst fading Life remains. Tho' you have long been faithless and unkind, Yet sure my Mis'ries might affect your Mind, And melt you, now the Pangs of Death appear, To drop at parting one relenting Tear. Husband. Were you as sick as you pretend to be, And I the ghastly Signs of Death could see; If Tears would make the palled Tyrant fly, I then perhaps might play the Fool, and cry; But Women have such Ways, that few can tell When they're in Jest or Earnest, sick or well, Because they're subject to dissemble Pain, And oft, for little Cause, or none, complain. Wife. O! faithless Man, O! unbelieving Wretch, Do you not hear my weak and falt'ring Speech? Can my numb'd Arms, my cold and clammy Sweats, And trembling Agonies, be Counterfeits? Can my dead Feet, more cold than Ice or Stone, Be owing to Dissimulation? Do my Lips shiver, and my Eye-balls start, By th'Pow'r of vile Hypocrisy and Art? O! gaze with Pity on your injur'd Wife; Repent those Ills that have abridg'd her Life; Forsake those gaudy Serpents which you prize, Those Basilisks who poys'n ye with their Eyes; Those treach'rous Snakes, those Wantons of the Town. Who've been my Ruin, and will prove your own; Exclude their Charms from your unwary Breast, Or you'll be curs'd on Earth, when I am blest. O! my dear Babe, what will of her become When I am fled to my eternal Home? How ill must that poor harmless Infant fare, When left expos'd to such a Father's Care, Whose wicked Life, by Heaven's just Decree, Must be aveng'd upon his Progeny, 'Less divine Mercy timely steps between, And kindly cuts off the Intail of Sin? O! Heav'n, look down with Pity, and dispense Thy Blessings on her tender Innocence; Be thou, Omnipotence, her Vertues guard, And keep her honest, tho' her Fate be hard; Direct her Footsteps with thy Heav'nly Grace, That no ill Action may her Charms debase; And turn her Father's Heart, that he may be Kinder to her, than he has prov'd to me. Husband. Thou still keep'st steady to thy old Extreams; Scolding and Praying were thy usual Themes: A Wife's Devotion is not worth a Pin, Except the Husband be reprov'd therein; Each Fault of his be sure must fetch a Groan, Although perhaps she quite forgets her own. Go on, my Dear, 'tis Pleasure to my Ears To hear you mix Reflexions with your Pray'rs: It looks as if you had not long to live, Because you do not heartily forgive. Wife. I'm not disturb'd at your Unkindness past, But grieve to see you slight me thus at last, When a few Hours will all my Pains remove, And put a Period to my nuptial Love. Have I not always been a faithful Wife, Regardful of the Comforts of your Life; Careful and kind, obliging ev'ry Way, Forward to please, and willing to obey? And do I not deserve one Sigh or Groan At the last dying Gasp, for what I've done? O! wretched Woman, and ungrateful Man, Whose Wrongs have rent my Heart at half my Span; But I forgive thee with a Christian Mind, And beg, when gone, you'll to my Child be kind. O! now I'm sliding to my last Repose, An Icy Circle does my Heart inclose. Alas! where am I? Clouds of gloomy Night Darken my Eye-balls, and eclipse the Light. O! kneel, and pray for my expiring Soul; Methinks I do o'er tossing Billows rowl; The raging Seas around my Body flow, And watry Mountains dash me to and fro. Where's my Philander? O! assist me, Dear! O! save me, G?d.—I sink—I know not where. Husband. Alas! she's gone indeed. O! wretched Man, Well might such Vertue of her Wrongs complain: None, her hard Suff'rings, but herself could tell; Ill have I us'd her, who deserv'd so well: Curse on the wanton Fair, that made me prove So base and treach'rous to such faithful Love. What an ungrateful Monster is a lewd And vicious Husband to a Wife so good! How proudly does the Traytor tyrannize O'er Vertue, which he knows not how to prize, Pleas'd that his Lordly Station gives him Pow'r To plague and punish what he ought t'adore! O! that my Tongue could utter what I feel; 'Till now, I never knew I lov'd so well: But oh! she's gone, and all her Charms are fled, Which once adorn'd and bless'd my Marriage-Bed: Unworthy of those Favours I misus'd, I've now for ever lost what I abus'd. How oft have I, (when she has strove to please) Like an imperious Wretch, disturb'd her Ease; Study'd a thousand Ways to tease her Life, With base unmanly Jealousies and Strife; O! hateful Husband to so just a Wife. What Pennance could I bear, to now retrieve Such spotless Vertue from the silent Grave? Kingdoms and Crowns I could with Joy resign, Nay, the whole World to save her, were it mine: But 'tis, alas! O! foolish Man, too late To now redeem her from insulting Fate. Farewel, thou best of Women, since thy Charms Are early fled from my unworthy Arms, Thy dying Words shall melt my stony Breast, And pierce my weeping Soul whilst thou art blest; Never from my repenting Thoughts depart, But stand, like Brass, imprinted in my Heart. Come, my dear Babe, thou shalt my Mistress be; Tho' to thy Mother false, I'll succour thee, And, on thy charming Innocence, bestow The high Regard I to her Goodness owe. Thou, my dear Girl, shal't be my only Wife, Joy of my Soul, and Comfort of my Life, And with those Charms, thy Infant Years may boast, Supply the matchless Blessings I have lost. No more shall wanton Beauty, with her Eyes, Poyson my Breast, and make my Heart her Prize; Or tempt me with her Charms, so oft defil'd, To be a careless Father to my Child. No, my dear Angel, tho' I've been, 'tis true, Unkind to thy dear Mother, and to you, Yet now my Heart relents, and thou shal't see The Love I owe to her, I'll pay to thee. Moral Reflexions on the foregoing Dialogue. [Ill Husbands oft good Wives despise] Ill Husbands oft good Wives despise, And tease their humble Spirits, When worthy Men would gladly prize Their Vertues and Merits. The Profligate has no true Sense Of Woman's vertuous Graces, But values wanton Impudence Above a Wife's Embraces: Esteems no Blessing of his own, Is so with Lust infected, That, for base Wantons of the Town, He leaves his Spouse neglected. Yet Women, to the World's Surprize, Are so bewitch'd in matching, That they reject the Chaste and Wise, For Fools not worth their catching: As if they strove to chuse the worst, In Hopes to make 'em better; For the best Women oft are curst With Men of most ill Nature. Yet he that's happy in a Wife Of Beauty, Love, and Honour, Deserves a miserable Life, That shall neglect or wrong her. Dialogue IV. Between a pert Lady, and an old fumbling Libertine. Wife. 'Tis to your Credit much, my Dear, to praise The manly Actions of your younger Days; You think you please me highly, to declare Your youthful Frolicks with the wanton Fair: Sure you expect I should commend the Feats You've done long since between adult'rous Sheets, And, that I ought to love you, for the Strokes You've given, by the Bye, to other Folks. For Shame, you fumbling Brute, now Age prevails Above your Strength, forbear your Bawdy Tales, And tell not me of Sluts you have enjoy'd, What Children you have got, what Fools decoy'd. Have you no Actions of your Life to boast, But the past Revels of your former Lust? No innocent Adventures you have had, Not one good Deed to ballance all the bad? Husband. Prithee, my Honey, where can be the Harm, If we with youthful Pranks our Fancies warm? It's always held a Pleasure, when we're old, To have our past unbearded Follies told. I'll swear, my Ears delight to hear my Tongue Revive the Frolicks that I had, when young. In my Opinion, to repeat the Fact, Is always far more pleasant than the Act. Like an old batter'd Soldier, I am glad To talk of the past Skirmishes I've had, And tell the Hardships, shew my Wounds and Scars. And boast of Rapes committed in the Wars. Who'd value Honours, which such Hazards cost, Should the Remembrance of our Deeds be lost? What signifies all Hist'ry, but to show What Fools our Fathers were long long ago? Why therefore may not I delight my Ears With my own Faults, as well as talk of theirs? Wife. Fie, you old fumbling Fool, d'ye take a Pride To publish those Intrigues your Age should hide? Are the past Pleasures of your vicious Life Fit Entertainments for a youthful Wife? Must I be teas'd with your lascivious Tales Of am'rous Favours now your Vigour fails; Hear all your luscious Freaks, when in your Prime, And how you came thus grey before your Time? Sure you design to spur me, if you can, To slight your Age, and try some other Man, That your declining Years might honour'd be With some adult'rous Bastard-Progeny; Else would you find some more obliging Way, 'Less your vain Talk should tempt my Youth astray; Teach me to wean my Heart from Vertue's Rules, And to despise grey Heirs and Spectacles. Husband. If a Wife's Vertue cannot stand the Test Of a loose Tale, or Husband's merry Jest, But lustful Thoughts must presently inflame Her Breast, and make her wish to act the same, She nothing wants but an obscene Attack From one she likes, to fling her on her Back. The Dame that's truly vertuous, will be free, And, when amidst her Gossips, merry be; Ne'er turn her Back upon a smutty Flirt, Or, with her squeamish Fie Fies, spoil their Sport; Ne'er struggle hard against a harmless Kiss, Or redden, when a Word is dropp'd amiss. Starch'd Modesty looks foolish in a Maid, But ten times worse in Woman that is wed; Makes her appear but like a cunning Jilt, Whose Blushes shew her conscious of her Guilt. By a wise Proverb, we have long been taught, The Sow that's silent, drinks up all the Draught; And that the Harlot, tho' in private free, Can at a Christ'ning, mute and modest be. Wife. But still this will not in the least excuse A Man in talking loosely to his Spouse, And digging up the Rubbish of those Sins, Whose ill Effects so oft excite your Grins. Methinks, now old, you should be glad to hide Your youthful Crimes, and make them not your Pride, But let unstir'd the nauseous Muck hill rot, 'Till first repented of, and next forgot. Man's the domestick Lord, and ought to be The Great Example of his Family; At Home should nothing say or do, but what Is fit for a good Wife to imitate, And by his decent Talk, and pious Life, Ought to encourage Vertue in his Wife. That her chast Prudence may despise what's vain, And mind her Duty both to God and Man: But I, alas! instead of this must hear What Bastards you begot in such a Year; How many Wives and Virgins you defil'd, How well you manag'd when they prov'd with Child; Who made you smart for your deluding Tongue, Who was most beautiful, and who most young; As if your pass'd Performance would attone For your Home fumbling now your Dancing's done; And that I now should value you the more For all your boasted Favours heretofore, So lavishly bestow'd e'er I was born, On Jilts and Trulls a vertuous Man would scorn. Shame on your Age, so proud to let me see How far your Lust survives Capacity, As if you thought the Lewdness of your Youth, Now past your Strength, became your rev'rend Mouth, And that I ought to honour your Decay, Because you're still lascivious, tho' you're grey, And too infirm, instead of good or wise, To act that Lewdness which your Age denies. Husband. How now, you youthful, giddy, prating Fool, Am I turn'd Child, and come again to School? It's a fine Age, when Girls begin to preach, And younger Wives their older Husbands teach. You're wond'rous modest of a sudden grown, That not a Word of Smut will now go down, As if you fancy'd you were still a Maid, And ought to blush at merry Tales 'till wed, 'Less you should show, by an attentive Ear, How well you love what now you cannot hear. Wife. I was a Maid, when to your Bed I came, And may, for ought I know, be still the same; You had need boast of all your mighty Feats Perform'd long since between unlawful Sheets, When you so long in vain have try'd to get A lawful Heir t'enjoy your large Estate, But have not shew'd sufficient Manhood yet! You're wise to brag of your romantick Joys, You're lovely Girls, and your parochial Boys, Begot so briskly, could the Truth be known, Not here, but on some Empress of the Moon. Go, you old fumbling Letcher, blush for Shame To be so lewd, when gouty, old, and lame; Tell not your Wise of your debauch'd Extreams, My Vertue scorns to hear such bawdy Dreams, Invented to delight some beastly Crew, And told so oft 'till you believe 'em true. Timely consider, Penitence and Pray'rs Will better far become your grisly Hairs; Learn to extinguish all your vain Desires, Those useless Ashes of your lustful Fires, Which now are burnt so low, that they're become No more than a mere Caput Mortuum. Husband. I find the Fool is finely brought to Bed, That in his Age a youthful Wife has wed: His Talk is nauseous, his Embraces cold, And his kind Deeds thought fumbling, 'cause he's old; When weak Efforts, from a Gallant less strong, Would be much more esteem'd, because he's young. Well, Wife, since my own House must be my School, Where Woman, Pedant lke, must bear the Rule, I shall play Truant 'till the Hour of Nine, And con my fine new Lesson o'er my Wine, Whilst in my Absence some devouter Rake May act, perhaps, what I must fear to speak. Wife. Go, jealous Impotence, it's Time to walk, And since your Mouth, grown foul with bawdy Talk; For the brisk Bottle is a fitter Match, Than a young Wife for such a fumbling Wretch, Who, now he's old, is proud to be bely'd, And brags of Favours which he ne'er enjoy'd. So Bullies, that they may'nt be Cowards thought, Boast of those Duels which they never sought, As Fools report strange Conquests o'er the Fair, Purely to seem more wicked than they are. Moral Reflexions on the foregoing Dialogue. [He that has led a vicious Life] He that has led a vicious Life, And scatter'd his Affections, Is but a Fool to tell his Wife Of all his youthful Actions: For Lust once rais'd in female Veins, Takes Fire as quick as Tinder, And idle Talk breaks Vertue's Reins, Which good Discourse would hinder. Who then, that knows his own Decay, Would be so lewd a Letcher, To teach his youthful Bride the Way To crack her nuptial Pitcher. Women, when plagu'd with fumbling Age, Need nothing to excite 'em, But are too ready to engage, When younger Arms invite 'em. Who then, that has a Dram of Brains, Would prove so vain a Noddy, T'inflame his Wife's more youthful Veins, With Stories that are Bawdy? Yet Lust in Age so oft prevails, That Men turn Goats and Satyrs, And, by their luscious idle Tales, Debauch their Wives and Daughters. Dialogue V. Between a wealthy Niggard, and his generous Termagant. Wife. What do you mean, my Dear, d'ye think I'll wear A Grogram Stuff, as coarse as Camels Hair, Such that I'm sure my very Maid would scorn, Fit only by some Ale-wife to be worn? Not I, indeed, pray take your home-spun Drug, And give your Present to some Country Jug: Let me have Money from your Hoard, that I May go and chuse what best will please my Eye. D'ye think, old Niggard, you shall buy my Cloaths, Or bring me to the wear of such as those? No, you shall sooner find, that I'll, by Stealth, Force thro' your Locks to your imprison'd Wealth, Make your Trunks fly, unseal your mouldy Bags, Ere I'll be us'd to homely Stuffs or Rags. Husband. Prithee, be patient, Love, you can't but know Taxes are very high, and Rents but low; The Times are hard, Wives should not be so proud, Money grows scarce; come, come, the Stuff is good Don't be so stubborn, prodigal, and high, You may be glad of worse before you die: I've known good Women, nay, of Quality, With larger Fortunes than you brought to me, Think it no Scandal to appear in View With a worse Gown, than what I've bought for you; Pray therefore don't despise it at this rate, The Stuff's a pretty Stuff, I tell you that, And such that no good Housewife should disdain; For Garments seem most modest, that are plain. Wife. Have my kind Parents bred me up so well, And paid down such a Fortune on the Nail; For me to go now dress'd like Rural Joan, With an old Grannum's nasty Grogram on? Truly I'll not disguise my Youth, to please A stingy Muckworm with such Stuffs as these, Fit only for Swain, or Shepherd's Trull, Who spins her Garments of her own black Wooll Let me have Silks; for I'll respected be According to my Birth and Quality; Nor shall my tender Skin, to Hollands us'd, Be, by coarse stubborn Dowlace Shifts, abus'd; No Face of mine shall, by my Friends, be view'd In Quaker's Pinner, and a Querpo Hood. Or shall my Shoulders wear, to my Disgrace, A Scarf with neither Furbelow or Lace? I'll not be kept at such a slavish Rate, But dress according to your large Estate; And if you'll not maintain me as you ought, According to the Fortune that I brought, I'm not so old or ugly, but can find Another, who, perhaps, will prove more kind. Husband. Why sure, you haughty Jezabel, you'd scorn To shame your lawful Husband with a Horn, And damn your Soul, as well as wrong your Spouse, For a high Head, and a few tawdry Cloaths. I find but what I fear'd, this 'tis to wed A proud Virago so profusely bred, Humour'd at Home, and taught at Dancing School To scorn, for foreign Silks, your native Wooll; To turn your Toes, to bridle up your Head, And move, like formal Clock-work, as you tread; To tune your Voice, to thrum on your Gittar, And wash and paint, to make your Looks more fair. You should have wed some Prodigal at Court, A spend-thrift Coxcomb of the higher Sort; Some little Monkey-Heir, decreed by Fate Not to improve, but lavish an Estate. Wife. Use me not thus, you Money-loving Fool, I am too good for such a narrow Soul, Who values nothing but your hoarded Bags, And cares not if your Wife went dress'd in Rags: Had I your stingy Avarice but known Before the Priest had curs'd me as your own, Death, with a Halter, should as soon, I vow Have noos'd me, as so poor a Wretch as thou, Who slights Ease, Honour, Honesty, and Health, And doats on nothing, but your ill got Wealth: But since my tender Parents, for the Sake Of Riches, led me into this mistake, Believing no penurious Chirl could prove Reserv'd to her, who so deserves your Love; And since, repugnant to their Hopes and mine, You less respect me, than your Idol Coin, And o'er your Mammon keep so strict a Hand, That I must beg what Woman should command, Where e'er I come, I'll trumpet your Disgrace, And make you 'ppear as odious as you're base; Spit, like a Cat, my Venom and my Spite All Day, and tantalize your Lust at Night; Borrow of all that will be free to lend, That you may pay what I profusely spend; Take up rich Gowns and Petticoats on Tick, Break thro' all Vertue, and at nothing stick; Turn an eternal Scold, grow vile and lewd, And curse your House with an adult'rous Brood; Respect you less than now I do your Man, Cheat and torment you ev'ry way I can; Nay, cuff your Miser's Noddle, claw and tear, That your thin Jaws my spiteful Marks shall wear. Thus ev'ry way that Woman can contrive, Revenge the barb'rous Usage that you give, 'Less you a more obliging Husband prove, And, by your gen'rous Kindness, show your Love. Husband. What, Huzzy, will you turn a Thief, a Whore, And make your self a Beast, a Common shore? Afflict your Parents, and torment your Spouse, Seek your own Misery, to shame my Brows? Ruin your self, to be reveng'd on me, And scandalize your own good Family? Be the World's May-game, ev'ry Rascal's Sport, Defile your Body, do your Soul such hurt, And all because your odious Female Pride, Is not with Silks and Sattins gratify'd? Rare modest Resolutions, by my Life, A well-bred Lady, a most vertuous Wife! Wife. Too honest, had my Vertue first been lost, To be by such a Niggard's Arms ingrost, Who places on your Gold your whole Esteem, And thinks all other Pleasures but a Dream. You can no Charms in female Beauty find, 'Less 'twas on Gold, like Cæsar's Image, coin'd; Nor can you fancy Love affords Delight, Except well paid for what you do at Night. Go, mercenary Wretch, and hug thy Pelf, Live like an Anch'rite starving by thy self; Rowl in thy Wealth, live hated and forlorn, And burrow in thy Bags, like Rats in Corn; Tho' they, poor Vermin, do enjoy their Store, Whilst you in Plenty starve, and wish for more, They feast and revel whilst their Hoards do last, But still you pine, and have no Pow'r to taste, And labour, tho' in vain, to bring your Wife To share the Curse of such a Beggar's Life. But know, penurious Muckworm, that I scorn My fleshy Sides, by Fasting, should be worn To a poor starv'd Anatomy, like thine, Debarr'd, by Av'rice, both of Food and Wine, That when thou'rt dead, some Spend-thrift may confound Those Heaps of Gold in Chains and Fetters bound: But, Miser, thou shalt find, ere I'll comply With thy coarse Fare, I'll make your Mammon fly, Force you to spread your Table, like a Lord, With the best Dainties that the Shops afford; Allow me Silks and Laces, that agree With your known Riches, and my Quality; Else shall you feel the sharp Effects that wait Upon an angry Woman's Scorn and Hate; For I'll exert my Envy, and my Pride, And prove the very Devil of a Bride. Husband. Did Husband ever hear so vile a Wretch? Sure thou'rt some Spirit, Succubus, or Witch; I took thee for a Saint, but find, alas! Thy Heart is Iron, and thy Face is Brass; Your Words fierce Thunder-bolts, that when you gape, Confound my Ears at every dreadful Clap; Your Temper too unruly, and your Pride Too dev'lish to be humour'd or deny'd; For should I strive to pleasure your Desires, By granting what so proud a Shrew requires, I must too lavishly supply your Wants, And beggar'd be by your Extravagance; If I refuse what you command or pray, I then must be undone some other Way: Thus, if I'm careful to Caribdis shun, I must upon the Rocks of Scilla run. Direct me, Heaven, how to steer my Course, 'Twixt female Pride, and Anger, which is worse. Wife. I'll tell you, Muckworm, if you'd happy be, Transfer that Love you have for Gold, to me; Value no Cost that can oblige your Wife, And that's the Way to lead an easy Life: But if your odious Stinginess be such, To think I wear too good, or spend too much, Then bitter Words your Miser's Ears shall warm, And welcome Fools about my Beauty swarm; Bully and Cuckold ye in spite of Fate, And make you curse your Av'rice, when too late; Tease, rob, and cheat you, bastardize your Race, And all the World condemn you for an Ass, Whilst I with Pleasure shall increase your Plagues, And make your Life a Hell amidst your Bags; Whose base imprison'd Dross shall ne'er procure The Respit of one kind or happy Hour, 'Till thou shalt find, that Wealth is but a Dream, And that a Wife, provok'd to an Extream, Can, when she pleases, in an angry Mood, Do thee more Harm, than Gold can do thee good. Husband. Prithee, my Dear, be patient, I'll be glad To make thee easy, for I fear thou'rt mad; Pride has bewitch'd thee, fill'd thy Breast with Evil, And chang'd thee from a Woman to a Devil. Thou art some Offspring of the Serpent's Seed, Or Fury of the Amazonian Breed; A mere Bellona, fit to bear a Shield, And shew your head-strong Valour in the Field; Destin'd to stand the Brunt of clashing Swords, Or to fright Mankind with your daring Words. Here, fiery Beldam, prithee take my Keys, Do what you will, and lavish what you please; Dress like a Dutchess, gratify your Pride; Who dare deny so Termagant a Bride? But rather purchase Ease, than to be stung With the sharp Venom of so curs'd a Tongue. Wife. Take back your rusty Keys, you tim'rous Wretch, Open your Heart, and your close Purse-strings stretch; Give me but Money for the Things I need, And what is useful, I shall ne'er exceed; For tho' I scorn coarse Stuffs, or worthless Rags, I aim not to be Mistress of your Bags, My Pride shall ne'er above my Station tow'r, Or covet to usurp a Husband's Pow'r; I'd only have you generous and free, According to your known Ability; Then will that Wealth, which is but now your Care, Make us, when rightly us'd, a happy Pair; For Riches padlock'd in a Miser's Hoard, Who pines for what he may, yet won't afford, Are but like Mines of Treasure under ground, Bury'd i'th' Dark, that lie as yet unfound. What are you better for your tarnish'd Sums, Chain'd up in Trunks, and barricado'd Rooms, Where sporting Rats the useless Pile despise, And, in Contempt, dance round it as it lies; Nay, knaw the Bags, that you may learn from thence To purchase Plenty at your Coins expence; And as the Vermin on the Canvass pray, By their Example, you are taught the way To use your Wealth, and not, amidst your Store, To punish Nature, like a Wretch that's poor; Therefore be gen'rous, and you still shall find I'll be indulgent, dutiful, and kind; Profuse in nothing, saving as you please, Allow but what is needful for our Ease, With such Attendance, useful to maintain A decent Port, above the World's Disdain; For hoarded Riches will not keep us free From human Censure, Scorn, and Calumny; For publick Bounty is the best Defence Against the World's ill-natur'd Insolence. Spare but these Things from your abundant Store, I shall be easy, and shall ask no more; But if your Heart be wedded to your Gold, And, to our Scandal, you your Dross with hold, Prefer a wretched and penurious Life, Above your Ease, your Honour, or your Wife, I'll tease you, horn you, publish your dispraise, And plague your sordid Heart ten thousand ways. Husband. Silence that dreadful Instrument, thy Tongue, And I'll be glad to own I'm in the Wrong; Give thee my All, with any Thing comply, Cease but that hideous Thunder, which may vie With those loud Claps that eccho thro' the Sky. Let my poor Ears but be for ever freed From that shrill piercing Clangor which they dread, And I'll submit to all Things you can ask, Perform, with Gladness, my Herculean Task; Be lavish of the Gold I lov'd to save, And give more largely than your self can crave; Indulge your Pride in each expensive Whim, Turn gen'rous Coxcomb to the last Extream; Keep Crouds of lazy Slaves to fill your Hall, And wait your Female Pleasure, when you call; Provide you two nice Slatterns, to obey, And dress you like a Puppit ev'ry Day, Who know their Duty, when your lustful Charms Lie ruffl'd in some brawny Blockhead's Arms: You shall have all the Grandeur you desire, As much as Quality themselves require; Your Coach, your Spark, your Pimp, nay, Chaplain too, To add a pious Grace to th'Ills you do; Let me but live unbaited by your Tongue, With dreadful Sound, and pointed Venom hung; Plagues that no patient Husband would endure, Could all he's Worth the cursed Torment cure; Therefore take all, maintain what Port you please; Rather than suffer such eternal Teaze, Thou shalt command my Wealth, let me enjoy my Ease. Wife. You are mistaken, Sir; had I the Use Of all your Gold, I'd scorn to be profuse: My Fortune largely has increas'd your Store, And to your wealthy Coffers added more; Therefore, since Heav'n has been so kind, to grant Such Riches, why should we delight in Want? And, by a base penurious Life, destroy That Ease and Comfort we may both enjoy? Nay, draw upon our selves Contempt and Hate, When we may claim Respect, and live in State; Merit the World's Esteem, yet spend no more Than half the Int'rest of our wealthy Store; Maintain that Bounty which the World commends, And keep a well spread Table for our Friends; Be generous to all, relieve the Poor With what is needful daily at your Door, That their united Pray'rs to Heav'n may be As efficacious as our Charity; Deny your self no costly Food or Wine, And Care of Bus'ness to your Slaves resign; Dress to your Quality, wear what is good, And never save by swerving from the Mode; Want no Attendance needful, keep your Coach, Pursue your Pleasures, but without Debauch, And not starve on at this penurious Rate, To be a Miser curs'd with an Estate? Husband. O! bless me, what a Race would Woman run! I shall be beggar'd, baited, or undone; Should I presume to live at this high Rate, I ought to have, at least, a Lord's Estate. O! you proud noisy Termagant, must I Be plagu'd, or with my Ruin thus comply? O! Heav'ns, how I'm involv'd 'twixt Curse and Curse, And know not which is like to prove the worse? However, since my Riches cannot soon Be wasted, I'll the present Torment shun, And, rather than be teas'd, submit to be undone. Moral Reflexions on the foregoing Dialogue. [The Husband often blames his Wife] The Husband often blames his Wife For her imperious Clamour, When 'tis his own provoking Life That does at first inflame her. The Spend-thrift lavishes Abroad What by his Wife is wanted, And makes her petulent and loud, When vex'd and discontented. The rich, but parsimonious Spouse, Half starves his nuptial Crony, 'Till she, at length, adorns his Brows For Cloaths and Pocket-Money. Makes her revengeful and morose, Loose, negligent, and wrathful, When, if he'd less esteem'd his Dross, She would have prov'd more faithful, Women, when juvenile and fair, Will have their costly Dresses, And Husbands, who have Wealth to spare, Must humour their Excesses: Or, if she's homely, then her Tongue Will worry and perplex him; But if she's handsome, brisk, and young, Her Tail will also vex him. Dialogue VI. Between a pert Lady and her Spouse, concerning Superiority in Wedlock. Wife. Sometimes you tell me I am pert and proud, And that I talk perversly, and too loud; Contend when 'tis my Duty to submit, And ridicule your Follies with my Wit. Husband. 'Tis true, Rosinda, you at publick Feasts Use my Infirmities as common Jests; Expose those Failings should be kept unknown, And make my Faults the Subjects of your own. Wife. Wives with their Husbands, surely may be free; A blushing Bride may take that Liberty, And pass a harmless Jest, before she knows What 'tis to bear a Darling to her Spouse. 'Tis true, a Virgin should in Silence sit; For 'tis a Crime in Maids to show their Wit: But Marriage, tho' a Woman's ne'er so young, Always gives License to a female Tongue. We covet Wedlock with the same Intent As you contend to serve in Parliament; Not thro' the Hopes of being made more rich, But to enjoy the Privilege of Speech. Like Patriots, Wives should dare to speak their Mind; What Fool would wed, to have her Tongue confin'd? Husband. A Woman's Wit, her Self Conceit exalts, And serves her chiefly to defend her Faults; Gives her, on all Accounts, a fair Pretence To Contradiction, Argument, and Sense; Curs'd Talents in that head strong Thing, a Wife, The baneful Seeds of Matrimonial Strife. For how should Man his sov'reign Pow'r maintain, If those who should obey, dispute his Reign? Wife. Wives, by Experience, know their Husbands would Be Monarchs, nay, be Tyrants, if they could: But Women that are wise, their Frowns withstand, And scorn to truckle to each proud Command. Some Fools indeed, by patient Mother's taught, Are to a slavish Sense of Duty brought: Such Novices, when marry'd, may adore Imperious Man, and tremble at his Pow'r; As if the Lordly Churl had Right to claim A Subject's Homage of his tender Dame; When all the Rule that he pretends to have Over weak Woman, whom he deems his Slave, Is but usurp'd by Conquest, and by Fraud, O'er our kind Sex, by cruel Usage aw'd; Who still at Night, defeat your Force of Arms, And make you buckle to our pow'rful Charms. Therefore, at most, you govern but by Day, At Night we make our mighty Lords obey: The Monarch then by Woman is betray'd To wave his Scepter, and is gladly made An humble Slave to Beauty's Throne, the Bed. Husband. Husbands, like Princes, tho' they bear Command, Scorn to chastise with too severe a Hand: Yet, if a King does too indulgent prove, And makes his Subjects happy in his Love, Th'ingrateful People will be apt, like you, To deem his Royal Clemencies their due; And that his Acts of Bounty are no more Than fawning Signs of his defective Pow'r. So that his Favours lessen their Esteem, And make his proud rebellious Subjects dream, That he derives his Diadem from them. So, fair Rosinda, when you Ladies find, Your Husbands gen'rous, lenitive, and kind, You then despise the Domination given To Man, superior by the Laws of Heaven; Turn Rebels, our Supremacy deride And think us servile to your Lust and Pride. Thus Over-kindness makes you run astray, The more we love, the more you disobey. So head-strong Subjects, who no Duty know, If once indulg'd, the greater Rebels grow. Wife. But Man has no Dominion o'er his Bride, More than what's founded on his churlish Pride. The Wife's his Partner, and has Right to share His greatest Fortunes, well as meanest Fare. Equal in Pow'r the Woman ought to be; Both are by Marriage plac'd in one Degree: Both the same Flesh, when made each other's Mate; And both united in the self same State. Man has no Title to the upper Hand; Either may ask, but neither should command; Nor can a Wife, by Disobedience, prove A Rebel, tho' she falsifies her Love: For since our Husbands have no Right to sway, It is no Crime in Wives to disobey. Husband. What Hopes has he of a contented Life, That hears such precious Doctrine from a Wife? 'Tis hard, since Woman does her Wit abuse, She should be curs'd with more than she can use. Sure the vile Serpent's Poyson still takes place, And from old Eve, descends to all her Race; For the same Subtilty that first prevail'd, Is to this Day upon her Sex intail'd. But, Madam, you mistake; Man has a Right To rule, and 'tis your Duty to submit. Adam was made superior to his Bride; Lord o'er his Eve, and all the World beside. Woman's Desire shall to her Husband be, And he shall bear Dominion over thee, Was the first great Decree that Heaven made, After the happy Pair had disobey'd; Therefore you're doom'd into a subject State, By the Almighty Oracle of Fate; Which ev'ry Woman in the sacred Vow Of Wedlock, must acknowledge and allow, E'er the fair Bride can lawfully be wed, T'enjoy the Pleasures of the nuptial Bed. Did not your self, in solemn Manner, say, And promise to love, honour, and obey? Therefore no mortal Pow'r can set you free From that Obedience due to Heav'n and me. Thus God's Decrees, and human Laws accord, To make you subject, and my self your Lord. Wife. If Man has such a lawful Right to rule, Suppose the Wife be wise, her Spouse a Fool; Who then must manage and support the Weight Of those Affairs that tease a marry'd State? Or who the matrimonial Crown sustain, The prudent Woman, or imprudent Man? Husband. If the fair Dame proves wiser of the two, Bless'd with more Gifts than are a Woman's due; And that her Husband stoops beneath the Fate Of being careless and effeminate; She then may take the Freedom to advise Within her Sphere, but not to tyrannize: For if she turns her Counsel to Command, Sh' unjustly then usurps the upper Hand; Gives Cause sufficient for intestine Jars, And raises, by her Pride, Domestick Wars: For tho' a Woman may abound in Wit, Man should not be so foolish to submit; But in a marry'd State should still defend That Pow'r, for which our Wives so oft contend. What if a Wife has Sense enough to steer Without a Guide, she must not domineer, But let her Spouse the Reputation share, That's due to ev'ry well-contriv'd Affair: As Statesmen, who advise at Council Board, Still give the Honour to their sov'reign Lord; Who, if imprudent, yet they ne'er exclaim, But hide his Faults, and magnify his Fame. So may a Woman, if her Mate's less wise, Direct, behind the Curtain, and advise; But still the Honour, tho' the Man's a Fool, Should be ascrib'd to him, wh'as Right to rule. Wife. If Woman does the Weight of Bus'ness bear, 'Tis hard the Husband should the Honour wear! Or if the Wife superior Wit can boast, It seems unjust she should not rule the Roast! But still, perhaps, be hector'd like a Slave By a dull Coxcomb, or imperious Knave. Husband. Slav'ry's a modern, canting Term, in Vogue With stubborn Wives, and each rebellious R?ue, Who, hating to submit, would bear the sway O'er those just Pow'rs they should by Law obey. Th'Apprentice bound for seven Years to serve, That the dull Fool may neither hang or starve; The Woman ty'd in Marriage-Bonds for Life, To be a faithful and obedient Wife; The Subject fetter'd to his Prince's Cause By sacred Oaths, Religion, and the Laws; All hate the Yoke, desiring to be free, And stile their lawful Duty, Slavery; Forgetting still the Safety and the Good Th'enjoy in such an easy Servitude. Therefore, what most call Slav'ry, 's but a State Which Libertines and Rebels only hate, Thro' wild Desires arising from no more Than stubborn Ign'rance, or Lust of Pow'r, That their stiff Necks, to gratify their Pride, May o'er their wiser Governors preside; And so reverse both God and Nature's Rules, That the mad World, in spite of Laws and Schools, May bow their Heads to Women, and to Fools. Moral Reflexions on the foregoing Dialogue. [The Shrew, who has not Sense to know] The Shrew, who has not Sense to know Obedience is her Duty, Makes but a cursed Wife, altho' Sh' abounds in Wealth and Beauty. For her fair Features, and her Bags, That made her Spouse assume her, Will be o'er-ballanc'd with the Plagues: Of her contentious Humour. Therefore, whoever is unblest With a rebellious Woman, Should have Job's Patience, or, at least, The Courage of a Roman. For he her Taunts must bear, when wed; Like poor submissive Creature, Or else subdue the head-strong Jade: I know not which is better. One way, a Fool will make him seem, The other's Porter's Labour; Chuse either Plague, 'twill render him But odious to his Neighbour. If happy in a Wife you'd be Inspect her, ere you woe her; For none can tame a Shrew, but he That is not wedded to her. Dialogue VII. Between an Officer at his Departure, and his affectionate Wife. Wife. How can you leave me full of Fears and Cares, To struggle with the Toils of distant Wars, Where Fate, without distinction, meet the Brave, And lays him level with the worthless Slave? Let not your active Courage thus disdain Your peaceful Mansion, for the dusty Plain, Where thousands are by Destiny decreed, In spite of human Fortitude, to bleed. Why, Dearest, will you quit your downy Bed, In a cold Tent to rest your drowsy Head, Where killing Damps your Canvas Hut surround, And do most Mischief when you sleep most sound? Let me entreat you to resign your Post, Let younger Brothers fill the Warlike Host; You have Estate enough to live at Ease, A vertuous Wife that studies how to please; Fine Children to adorn your rural Seat, Nay, all that can a happy Life compleat. How then can you forsake such Joys as these, And change, for foreign Wars, domestick Peace? Husband. I own, my Julia, it concerns me near, That I must part with what I love so dear; But by Command superior I am bound To change, for distant Fields, my native Ground. Princes, like Gods, o'er human Race bear Sway, And we they rule, are destin'd to obey; To guard their Honour, we no Fate must fear, Tho' Dangers ne'er so dreadful do appear; But when their Safety does our Aid require, Plow raging Seas, or face destructive Fire, On frozen Earth refresh our weary Bones, And wade thro' wreaking Blood, to guard their Thrones. These are the Paths that do to Honour lead, Which Subjects, for the Sport of Kings, must tread; When they command, our Duty bids us fight, And hazard all, to do our Sov'reign Right: No Wife or Children must retard our Speed; We must be free to venture, tho' we bleed; And he that's forward to defy his Fate, If his heroick Deeds prove fortunate, Fame shall with Honour crown his conqu'ring Sword, And verdant Lawrels be his just Reward. Who then can dread the Terror or Surprize Of Death, that hopes for such a glorious Prize? Wife. Prithee, my Dear, consider what is Fame, A Poet's Fiction, a romantick Name; A publick Rumour, that does oft arise From slender Truths, improv'd by Falsities; An Art by which poor Flatt'rers win the Great, A noisy Vapour, useful in the State; A Glass, by which our famous Gazetteer Makes little Actions very large appear; A Last, that humours the fantastick Pride Of mighty Men, in stretching Deeds more wide; A lying Huzzy, that deceives the Croud, By trumpeting fictitious News aloud, Of wond'rous Feats by Heroes never done; Of vanquish'd Foes in Battels never won; Of slaughter'd Numbers, who are yet unslain; Of Ships destroy'd, still swimming on the Main. In short, this Fame, which you so much admire, Is but a noisy Cheat, a common Ly'r, Courted by Fools, but slighted by the Wise, Who scorn her Flatt'ries, and her Tales despise; For whosoe'er pursues the winged Dame, And makes vain Popularity his Aim, Shews that his Praises have their Mushroom growth, Not from his Vertues, but the publick Mouth, Whose bleating Gullet, and extensive Tongue, Are seldom stretch'd, but basely in the Wrong. Why therefore, with such hazard, will you court A Jilt, who, Fortune like, should be your Sport? Besides, what's Honour, but an empty Sound; A Toy with which a thousand Fools are crown'd; A Blast of Royal Breath, so oft bestow'd On worthless Minions, and a spurious Brood, Begot by stealth in an adult'rous Bed; Born without Brains, and to no Vertue bred; A misty Veil, by which the subtle State Obscure the Want of Goodness in the Great; A saving Way to recompence the Proud, Whose slender Merits must be sung aloud, That ev'ry trifling Service may surprize The Nation's list'ning Ears, and cheated Eyes, When all the Feats these mighty Men have done, If rightly scann'd, are scarce worth speaking on? If modern Honour be your Aim, my Dear, These are the Heroes who the Gugaw wear. Why then should you whose Valour has been try'd, Seek that which is so oft by Fools enjoy'd? What are the Lawrel-Wreaths of which you talk? Where do they grow? Who sees 'em when you walk? Mere airy Nothings, when with Hazard won, Imaginary Glories in the Moon: Like the old Man with Thorny Bush, which we In lucid Nights, by strength of Fancy, see. Prithee, my Dear, regard your native Home, Let giddy Rakes dance after Fife and Drum, And be deluded by its Warlike Sound, To change a fertile Soil, for barren Ground: Let the poor starving Croud, by Nature hard, Manure the Field, turn Butchers for Reward; Whilst fav'rite Heroes, honour'd with Command, Gazing from distant Hills, in Safety stand, To see their mangl'd Slaves in Numbers fall, Whilst those in Pow'r, who hazard least, win all. Stay thou at Home, my only Dear, I beg, Fame will not cure a crippl'd Arm or Leg, Nor those you fight for, if by Chance you're laid Amongst the bleeding Rout in Honour's Bed, Comfort your mourning Widow, when you're dead. Therefore, my Dear, since you in Wealth abound, Let younger Brothers toil on foreign Ground; No more your nuptial Happiness forsake, Let a kind Wife your Resolutions break; Court not, thro' Danger, popular Esteem, But live at Ease; for Honour's but a Dream. Husband. Your long Harangue with Patience have I heard; But tho' I love you, cannot quit my Sword, 'Less, to oblige a Wife, I should incur The Name of Coward, in the Time of War. Soldiers, by Honour, and by Arms, are bound, When Danger most appears, to stand their Ground; Or how should Monarchs, when alarm'd Abroad By Foes, upon their Thrones in Safety nod? Were Men to humour Wives, no Land could be, From slavish Bondage and Invasion, free. Our haughty Neighbours soon would cross the Main, And reap with Pleasure, what we sow with Pain; Plunder our Houses, and by force subdue, To their vile Lusts, our Wives and Daughters too; Lead us in Fetters to our wish'd for Graves, And breed our Sons to be their humble Slaves. These, and a thousand Mis'ries should we feel, Did we not arm, to conquer and to kill; And by a bold Defence in Time of Need, Baffle their Hopes, and their Designs impede. Who then, that boasts the Spirit of a Man, Would fear to shorten Life's uncertain Span In such a Case, when common Safety cries Aloud thro' ev'ry Town for fresh Supplies? Have I not eat in Peace my Country's Bread, And been for little Service largely paid? Was I not proud in publick to appear In Cloth of Honour, when no Foe was near? And would ye tempt me to forsake my Arms, Now the shrill Warlike Trumpet sounds Alarms; And, to my Scandal, thro' your weak Advice, To the whole World proclaim my Cowardice; Resign my Post, deny my Prince my Aid, For the soft Pleasures of a nuptial Bed? No, Julia, tho' I love you as my Life, I cannot lose my Honour for a Wife: Tho' Antony was kind, as well as brave, I scorn, like him, to be a Woman's Slave. Wife. Curse on that foppish Name, that empty Sound, In whose dark Maze Mens Intellects are drown'd; That Courtly Bauble, thin as airy Thought, Most boasted on by those who have it not; That Maggot that infects the giddy Brains Of Cowards, Fools, rich Knaves, and Curtizans. Upon my Honour, says the upstart Beau, That cloaths his Back by kissing G?d knows who, Tho', perhaps, born in some poor rural Cell, And dropt, but t'other day, from Coach's Tail. Touch not my Honour, cries the buxom Fair, Call'd down from Garret, to the Theatre, From thence advanc'd, for her enticing Charms, To some old gouty Courtier's lustful Arms. I'm bound in Honour, cries the Man of State, Who cheats whole Kingdoms to be rich and great; Flatters his Prince, whom he for Gold betrays, And owes his Thousands, which he never pays. My Honour calls, crys Bully-huff in Red, Obscurely born, perhaps to nothing bred, But lik'd by some Court-Jilt, for Beauty prais'd, Is, by her Int'rest, to Commission rais'd. The Gamester too pretends his Honour nice, Who lives by slipping Cards, and loaded Dice, Yet upon Honour he can swear h'as lost, And sink his Money, when h'as won the most. These are the Gentlemen of modern Date, That do so lavishly of Honour prate, Who lead most vicious Lives, whore, drink, and game, Void of all Sense of Vertue, and of Shame; Therefore, my Dear, b' entreated by a Wife To prize your Ease, your Children, nay, your Life, And not make all unhappy, to become Honour's starv'd Slave Abroad, but stay at Home, Where Peace and Plenty will be better far, Than a maim'd Limb, or honourable Scar, Those painful Fruits that Heroes reap in War. Husband. Forbear, my Love, your Satyr is too keen, Honour's the standing Rule of worthy Men; The Touch-stone of their Actions, and their Words, The Pow'r by which they draw or sheath their Swords. Honour, if rightly fram'd, like Conscience, shou'd Comprize Love, Duty, Justice, all that's good, And ought to be the Pole, or Northern Star, By which we steer our Course in Peace or War. 'Tis the true Ballance of our Live's Content, From which no Man should vary or dissent: In Honour's Scale, with steady Mind, we weigh That Loyalty which binds us to obey. 'Tis Vertue seated in a gen'rous Breast, Guarded by Valour, and with Wisdom blest, Which thus united, gives a splendid Light, That clears our Doubts, and guides the Soul aright. What tho' unworthy Cowards, Knaves, and Fools, Strangers to Vertue, and to Honour's Rules, Reduce the Word to a fantastick Cant, Because ill Men, or that they Prudence want, Must the Brave therefore disesteem the Gem, Because such Dung-hill Cocks despise the same? No, Julia, Honour shall be still my Rule, I scorn the Names of Coward, Knave, or Fool: I love my Children, and adore my Wife, Value my Riches, and regard my Life; But since I do my King's Commission hold, Have wore his Liv'ry, and receiv'd his Gold, Now he commands me, I shall hazard all To serve my Prince, tho' I a Victim fall. What tho' I've Wealth enough, and have no need To run thro' the Fatigues of War, for Bread, Yet Men of Figure, when our neighb'ring Foes Threaten the Kingdom with approaching Woes, Should, by their great Example, bravely shew What fearful Slaves at such a Time should do; For the base Rabble to their Cow'rdice yield, And hate the Drudg'ry of the Sword and Shield, Unless they're boldly led, to face their Fate, By Men of Worth, more generous and great; Therefore how base and mean should I appear, To bear Command in Peace, and flinch in War; To strut two Summers length in Martial Red, And now change Colour, when my Prince has need? For Shame, dear Julia, ask me not to stay, But shew your tender Love some other Way; All your fond Arguments are urg'd in vain, I must forsake you for a long Campaign, And dare the sturdy Foe, tho' I my self am slain. Wife. O! cruel Man, will you forsake your Wife, And these dear Babes, to sacrifice your Life? Have we not all been dutiful and good, And will you leave us now to wade in Blood? Since all my feeble Arguments must fail, Let a Wife's Tears, and Childrens Cries, prevail. Why do you shake us off? How can you part With all these Blessings that surround your Heart? Cling round thy Father's Neck, my lovely Boy, Kiss him and hug him close, my only Joy; Hang by his Arm, my dearest Girl, and pray That he'll be kind, and with your Mother stay. Look on your pretty Babes, my only Dear; Behold your Picture there, your Darling here; Let tender Innocence your Pity move, And melt your Breast into paternal Love. Why will you fill us full of Cares and Fears, And leave your mournful Family in Tears, To hazard that dear Life, which, if it's lost, Will all our Comfort in one Moment cost. One single Person is of small Regard; Your weak Assistance surely may be spar'd From those united Legions, sent to try, By Dint of Arms, the dreadful Lottery; Therefore, my Dear, once more I humbly crave, That you this fatal Expedition wave, And not expose your Life on bloody Plains, For those who scarce will thank you for your Pains. Husband. Should I my loyal Resolutions break For Woman, when my Honour lies at Stake, I should a Coward, or a Fool, appear, By shewing too much Love, or too much Fear. I am too just, my Dear, to quit my Arms, Tho' I admire my Children, and your Charms; But common Safety must prevail above The Bonds of nuptial or paternal Love; For in a just Regard of that, we shew Our Duty to our Wives and Children too; For the brave Soul that will undauted fight, To do his Prince and native Country Right, At the same Juncture succours and defends, By noble Means, his Relatives and Friends; Therefore, my Dear, no more entreat my stay, For I'm resolv'd, and must with speed away. Wife. Since neither Tears nor Pray'rs will move your Breast To ease my Grief, by granting my Request, With aching Heart, and flowing Eyes each day, I'll in your Absence for your Safety pray; Implore the Gods to arm you against Fate, That Vict'ry on your Sword may always wait: But O! that Honour, which the Brave maintain, Should rob a Woman of so dear a Man! Husband. Be patient, Love, content thy self a while, Swift Time will quickly end our Summer's Toil, Then in full Gladness we again shall meet, And our past Absence make our Joys more sweet. Till then, my Dear, I bid you all adieu, And with this parting Kiss, my Love renew. Keep Home, with decent Conduct rule your House, And pray be thoughtful of your distant Spouse; Encourage no loose forward Visiters, The treach'rous World is full of Wiles and Snares; But remain chearful, easy in your Mind, Of your self careful, to your Children kind. Farewell, my Darlings, free of all Offence, May Heav'n protect your charming Innocence Till I return, enrich'd with foreign Spoils, That you may be the happier for my Toils. Adieu, once more, ye Comforts of my Life, My lovely Babes, and you my dearest Wife; Dry up your Sorrows, sigh no more in vain, For Time will make us happy once again. Wife. And are you gone? O! Heaven, my Fears abate, May Guardian Angels round his Person wait. O! grant, that he may conquer in the Field, And foreign Victims to his Mercy yield, That he may win upon the dusty Plain The lasting Glory which he hopes to gain, And return Home, to ease my doubtful Cares, Free from those Marks of Honour, Maims and Scars. 'Tis hard that Men of Worth should be the Sport Of Fortune, to oblige a flatt'ring Court, And quit the Blessings of their native Land, To try their Valour with each common Hand; Or, by Command, be hurry'd from their Wives, To lose their own, in guarding others Lives. O! curs'd Ambition of the Proud and Great, That Pow'r must be sustain'd by others Fate; That Cow'rds must be protected by the Brave, And one Man's Pride be made another's Grave. But so, alas! it is. Knaves find the Way To make the Wise, as well as Fools obey; And gallant Man, who boasts a gen'rous Soul, Must do the fatal Drudg'ry of the whole. 'Tis hard the valiant Mind should plough the Seas, And the gay Coxcomb sit at Home in Ease; Or that the Vertuous should be doom'd to fight, Whilst the rich Blockhead revels in Delight: But who can alter the Decrees of Fate, The Brave must be the Slaves that guard the Great. Come, my dear Babies, you and I must mourn Your Father's Absence, till his safe Return; Then shall we all be happy to our Mind, You in a tender Parent fondly kind, I in the joyful Smiles and soft Embrace Of a dear Spouse, the best of human Race. Moral Reflexions on the foregoing Dialogue. [A soldier should not be too soft] A soldier should not be too soft, But valiant as a Roman, And never mind the weeping Craft Or Cowardice of Woman. Should Wives and Mistresses prevail With Tears and Tittle Tattle, Few Men, to serve the Publick Weal, Would fight the Nation's Battle. No Woman cares to want or lose The Sweets of nuptial Duty, But strives to chain her loving Spouse To her bewitching Beauty. Therefore a Soldier should not prove Too lenitive and tender, But prefer Honour still above The fair, but fickle Gender. The Hero should be bold and wise, His Valour steer by Reason, And ne'er regard a Woman's Cries Or Sighings out of Season. Man to his Wife should bear Respect, And loving be, to ease her; But 'tis Imprudence to neglect The common Good, to please her. Dialogue VIII. Between a kind and wealthy Wife, and her facetious Husband of inferior Fortune. Wife. 'Tis true, the World condemns me for my Choice, But I am blest, and in your Love rejoice: Were the Knot void, which I so gladly ty'd, I'd still endeavour to become your Bride; In spite of Friends, my own Desires pursue, And give my Fortune and my self to you. Husband. By th'Obligations you've upon me laid, I hope, my Dear, we both are happy made; For tho' you're rich and beauteous, you shall find I'll ballance all, in being just and kind; Be always careful to preserve your Ease, Esteem your Love, and study how to please; By soft indearing Means indulge your Life, Preserve each happy Moment free from Strife, And prove as good a Husband, as your self a Wife. Wife. Had I not, in your gentle Looks and Mein, The peaceful Sweetness of your Temper seen, And in your Carriage, and your Words, descry'd Your Want of Wealth by Vertue was supply'd, Tho' I had lov'd, I should have fear'd to join A Heart, whose Truth I'd doubted of, with mine: But I, my Dear, am so secure in you, That I enjoy more Love than I can shew; And in the manly Graces of your Mind, A more than equal Satisfaction find; Am richer far, in the respect you show, Than you in all the Wealth I can bestow; Nor does my Fortune equal your Deserts, Or Charms reward your Vertues and your Parts. Husband. Had you, my Dear, no fertile Lands to boast, Or Wealth t'adorn your Beauty with such Cost, Your Charms alone, as they by Nature shine, Without your Bags, had surely made you mine. Those sweet Angellick Looks, so soft and fair, Your easy Temper, and engaging Air, Had needed no Addition, to prevail, I should have long'd so much, and lov'd so well; And thought your Graces, tho' of mean degree, Had been a Fortune large enough for me. Wife. I am oblig'd, O! gen'rous Man, to hear, That you my Person to my Wealth prefer; Am pleas'd that I a double Blessing prove, Not only in my Riches, but my Love; For where there's either wanting, 'twill abate The mutual Pleasures of a nuptial State. Husband. Riches are Blessings which we ought to prize, But still in Beauty's Charms more Comfort lies, Whose Heav'nly Brightness does by far out-shine The Golden Lustre of the Indian Mine: The gen'rous Breast does needless Wealth despise, But honours Love, and doats on Beauty's Eyes; Thinks it beneath all Vertue, to prefer The Miser's Idol to the charming Fair. Money can only Nature's Wants supply, But Beauty yields a much sublimer Joy; Gives us on Earth a Taste of Heav'nly Bliss, Wounds with each Look, and cures with ev'ry Kiss. Riches, 'tis true, from Want will keep us free, But Love gives Comfort in Adversity; Makes the kind Pair more happy, tho' they're poor, Than the cross Couple are amidst their Store; For when Love's wanting in a marry'd State, Curs'd are both Spouses, tho' their Wealth be great. Wife. I know, my Dear, what you assert is right, For in your Love I centre my Delight; Without that Blessing, I should only be A pensive Wretch in rich Adversity; Nay, for my Life, be destin'd to endure Those Pains the wealthy Indies could not cure; For gen'rous Love in vertuous Woman's Breast, Without a just Return, admits no Rest; Nor can her Fortune, tho' it's ne'er so large, Her wishing Mind of am'rous Grief discharge. What Woman then would bear that inward Smart Which still improves, when kindl'd in her Heart, And not, with Gladness, hazard all her Store With him she loves, tho' ne'er so mean and poor? Were I of all my Riches dispossest, In you alone I should be truly blest; For in one kind Embrace have I enjoy'd More Comfort, than in all the World beside. Husband. If in my Arms you can so happy be, How great must I think my Felicity, Who am beyond my Merits blest by you, Not only with such Wealth, but Beauty too; Crown'd with the Graces of a gen'rous Mind, Enrich'd by Heaven, and by Nature kind? O! that I could but boast that equal Worth Which ev'ry beauteous Charm of yours sets forth! Or that, instead of being humbly bred, I'd brought high Honours to your nuptial Bed; Improv'd your Fortune by a large Estate, And made you much more happy and more great! I then might have deserv'd the Love you show, Which is but now your Bounty to bestow. Wife. Were you of all the Spanish Mines possest, And with the Sound of swelling Titles blest, 'Tis true, I might enjoy a larger Fame, But could not be more happy than I am. I want, my Dear, no Riches to compleat The needful Comforts of a nuptial State; And what's beyond, I never shall pursue, But place alone my Happiness in you. I envy not her Station, who has soar'd To be the Lady of some gouty Lord, Vainly puff'd up, fantastically ty'd To all the Rules of Honour and of Pride, Loaded with glitt'ring Jewels, to surprize, In publick Cavalcades, the Vulgar's Eyes; When all her vain external Pomp, that shines Amidst the Riches of the Eastern Mines, So much admir'd, cannot, perhaps, procure Her discontented Breast one happy Hour. I always scorn'd to sacrifice my Charms For Honour's Sake, to rich and noble Arms, Who, in a Week, had slighted my Embrace, To make new Courtship to some newer Face. I hate the fickle Coxcomb giv'n to range, And tho' a Woman, am too fix'd to change; Or, for a Monarch's Flatt'ries, to remove My steady Heart from th'Object of my Love. I'm not ambitious, by my Charms, to gain More Pomp than I can honestly maintain: I'm to no vain external Pride inclin'd; My Joys are center'd in a peaceful Mind: I'm not for inward Grief, and outward State, Or being wretched, to appear more great. Let me be happy in my self, altho' In others Eyes I seem not to be so; For those who, by their Grandeur, strive to please The giddy World, must seldom live at Ease. I love the Man that does his Honour bear, Not in his Patent, but his Character; Whose Actions, not his Titles, speak his Fame, And are alone a Glory to his Name. You are that happy Man, in whom I find All that is grateful, generous, and kind: I've Wealth enough, in you I've all the rest, And nothing need to be entirely blest. Be but as good as I am sure you'll prove, And that eternal Pow'r that rules above, Will make us happy in each other's Love. Husband. Beneath what prosp'rous Planet was I born, To meet such Love, who but deserv'd your Scorn! What Altars have I rais'd? What Actions done, To merit from the Gods so kind a Boon? Sure such a gen'rous Mind, and lovely Face, Till now, ne'er shone among the female Race; Or Man of such low Fortune and Degree, Tho' ne'er so just, been ever blest like me. What sweet Angellick Goodness do I hear, Flow from your Tongue, to my astonish'd Ear? In what melodious Words do you express How much you Love, what Vertues you possess, That by your kind Endearments ev'ry Hour, My growing Happiness proves more and more? O! could the Joys of Life, when thus compleat, Be but as lasting as they're truly great, What Man so blest, could with a Wife be cloy'd, Or envy what's beyond his Reach enjoy'd, Who like the Croud of Fools that have no Taste Of Female Blessings, but beneath the Waste, Would wish himself from such a Bondage free, That ev'ry Moment yields Felicity? What vicious Mortal could be glad to part, For new Delights, with such a faithful Heart, And not give all his Worldly Store, to save Such charming Goodness from the silent Grave? Believe me, Dear, I have a just Regard For all the Favours you have thus conferr'd. On him, who had at first but small Pretence To so much Goodness, Beauty, Wealth, and Sense. However, since by Heaven I'm decreed To be the nuptial Partner of your Bed, And, thro' your Bounty, am allow'd to share All Blessings that in your Possession are, The Love I bear to ev'ry charming Grace, That so adorns your Mind, as well as Face, And those Returns of Gratitude I owe For all the matchless Kindnesses you show, Oblige me, if 'tis possible, to vie Goodness with those that dwell beyond the Sky; Nor can a Man reward such faithful Love, Without some kind Assistance from above; Therefore, my Dear, since Vertue so divine, Join'd with your Beauty, do united shine, And all the Graces seated in your Breast, Have thus conspir'd to make a Husband blest, So, by my kind Deportment, shall you see, I'll prove as good as human Soul can be, That you shall ne'er repent the Choice you've made, But bless the Hour you took me to your Bed. Wife. Thank you, my Dearest, that you vow to prove A Pattern of true Gratitude and Love; By Vertue's Rules we'll steer our happy Lives, And shame ill Husbands and contending Wives, Who, wanting Love and Prudence, spend their Days In jarring Discords, which their Follies raise, Blaming a nuptial State, when by their own Provoking Means, they are, alas! undone; A common Curse, by angry Heaven laid On Smithfield Bargains, by their Parents made, When only Fortunes or Estates are join'd, And Children match'd against each other's Mind. I therefore scorn'd that Av'rice should controul My Love, or thwart the Dictates of my Soul; But was resolv'd to hazard all my Worth, Without Regard to Fortune, or to Birth, And chuse the Object of my fond Desire, Whose Person I could love, and Parts admire: And you, my Dearest; are the only he On whom I build my whole Felicity; Nor do I doubt, but I shall always find Your Temper gen'rous, and your Actions kind, That wealthy rigid Parents, who refuse Their Sons and Daughters Liberty to chuse, May see, by us, that where there's mutual Love, Unequal Matches may successful prove. Moral Reflexions on the foregoing Dialogue. [Tho' Money is the best sure Card] Tho' Money is the best sure Card, As wise Experience teaches, Yet those that wed, should have regard To Love, as well as Riches. If the Dame has sufficient Store To bless herself and Lover; What's Matter, if the Man be poor, Since they admire each other? Therefore she's happy in her Choice, Without her Friends Direction, Who has but Wealth to crown her Joys, And buoy up her Affection. What mortal would not think it hard, To see a lovely Creature Comply to wed some crooked Lord Of Monkey Phiz and Stature? But who can blame the wealthy Lass, Altho' of lofty Station, That weds a Man not worth a Cross, To please her Inclination? Wealth cannot those Delights compleat, Which Lovers seek in private; That only finds us Cloaths and Meat, But Joy's the Thing we drive. Dialogue IX. Between an old drolling Gentleman with a Carbuncle-Nose, and his merry Tallow-fac'd Lady. Husband. How do'st, my Dear? thy Brother Dick and I Have taken a delicious Glass hard by: We drank your Health, my Love, amongst the rest; Faith he's a merry Fellow at a Jest. Wife. Alas! you need not tell me where you've been; That, by your fiery Gills, is eas'ly seen: The blazing Comet that adorns your Face, Too plainly shews you've hugg'd the juicy Glass; For drink whate'er you please, the Liquor flows Into your old repository Nose, Which when so full it can no more retain, Will, at one Squeeze, supply the Glass again: Therefore 'tis needless you so oft should go To th'Tavern, since you cannot chuse but know, That what you drink one Day, may be of Use The next, but press your Rubies for their Juice; Nay, twice concocted, it may quench your Thirst The second Time much better than the first. Prithee, my Dear, come hither, you shall see I'll make your Grapes yield Claret presently. Husband. How now, you Flirt! would you with Icy Hands Prophane that Nose which in such Splendor stands; That rev'rend Ornament which shines so bright, And warms its Neighbours in a Frosty Night? Stand off, thou pale Diana, come not near; When the Sun shines, the Moon shou'd disappear. Thy frozen Face extinguishes my Light, And with its ghastly Looks, offends my Sight: My glowing Nose, like burnish'd Gold, displays A thousand dazzling and delightful Rays; Flames like an Altar set on Fire, to move The angry Gods to shew their wonted Love; Whilst thy pale Snout dishonours human Race, And proves a Scandal to a Christian Face. Wife. I'll swear you'd need applaud your fiery Beak, That scorches, as it stands, each neighb'ring Cheek As if your burning Mountain meant to prey, Like Ætna, upon all Things in its Way. Indeed, my Precious, if you thus carouse, I'll have a Water-Engine in the House; For if your chimick Nose has got the Skill To extract Fire from Liquors that you swill, Who knows, i'th' Night but your Grenado Head May sneeze forth Lightning, and inflame my Bed? Therefore, my Dear, I think its Time to shew Our Care against such Dangers; what say you? Husband. My harmless Face will no such Aid require; For thou'rt all Ice, as sure as I am Fire. Lie thou but close to me, you need not doubt To stop the Mischief ere the Flames break out; The Water-Engine which you long have worn, Will do the Feat, and quench me when I burn. So Salamanders, 'less Report's a Ly'r, With their cold Touch, subdue the fiercest Fire. Thy frigid Nature does like Death appear, And frozen Looks, shew Winter all the Year; Whilst I, like sultry Summer, glow with Heat, And with my flaming Nose, make others sweat. Wife. You'd need to boast of such a scarlet Snout, So rough, so fiery, and so large about, Whose blushing Glories ought to be your Shame, Because t'Excess it owes its costly Fame. What are your Rubies, but an odious Sign That you're a Drunkard, and a Slave to Wine; A Sot that hugs the Tavern Flask so close, That Grapes in Bunches ripen round your Nose? From whence do all those crimson Welks arise, But from Intemp'rance and Debaucheries? What makes your red Pimgennets shine so bright, But gorging Bumpers in the Mid of Night, Swilling, like Swine, at Revels that you keep, Whilst wiser Mortals do enjoy their Sleep? It's a great Honour, and a mighty Grace, For Man to bear his Vices in his Face; That as the Indian Snake his Age declares By th'sundry Rattles in his Tail he wears; So all that view your mangy Nose, may read, In Scores of Rubies, what a Life you lead, And, by their fresh and fiery Aspect, tell What vicious Wine it is you love so well. In my pale Countenance, the World may see My female Temperance and Modesty, And that I keep no private Closet Drams, To drink unseen behind devouter Shams; Or that I gossip with a tatling Crew Of female Tiplers, till as drunk as you; And when my Brains with Punch or Brandy flame, Pretend the Vapours, to conceal my Shame. My languid Looks sufficiently declare, That I'm abstemious, as becomes the Fair, Giv'n to no Vice that does my Face disguise, Or shew its ill Effects in Nose or Eyes; Whilst your Carbuncle Phiz in Triumph glows, And bears your drunken Trophies round your Nose, As if you'd conquer'd Thousands o'er the Glass, Like Sampson, with the Jaw-bone of an Ass: Therefore, since flaming Snout your Conquests show, And your victorious Gills so famous grow, Prithee, dear Turky-Cock, let's hear you crow. Husband. You Death-like Flirt, how dare you thus disgrace So rich a Nose, on such a glorious Face? You Cake of Snow, cemented by the Frost, Were you once thaw'd, the Woman would be lost; Begot in Eighty Four on Icy Thames, When freezing Boreas had congeal'd its Streams. Dare such a Winter's Brat prophane a Phiz That warms the Air, and makes the Waters hiss; A Face where Rocks of wealthy Rubies grow, And Fountains of salubrious Claret flow? I say, be silent, let my Nose alone, The Theme's too great for you to preach upon; So rich a copious Text is only fit For jolly Priests and Poets fam'd for Wit: I'd have thee therefore let the Subject drop, So learn'd a Thesis is of wond'rous Scope, And let's, like loving Friends, to Bed retire, That we may kiss and hiss like Ice and Fire. Moral Reflexions on the foregoing Dialogue. [Wit, rightly us'd, will oft divert] Wit, rightly us'd, will oft divert The frowning Wife from Passion, And pacify the Husband's Heart, When swell'd with Indignation. Drolling Reproofs are better far Than angry Reprehension, Which oft foments an ugly War, And aggravates Contention. Witty Retorts 'twixt Bosom Friends, To shew each other's Failings, Much better answer both their Ends, Than stormy Huffs and Railings. Passion 'twixt Lovers, quickly takes, And runs like lighted Powder The more it's pent, when once it breaks, It bounces but the louder. The prudent Pair small Failings hide, And their Resentments smother; For if one Side begins to chide, It soon provokes the other: But if such Errors do appear, That merit Condemnation, Witty Reproofs, that please the Ear, Best work a Reformation. Dialogue X. Between a generous Husband, and his parsimonious Wife. Husband. What stingy Avarice invades thy Mind? Why must I be to one coarse Dish confin'd? Prithee forbear thy parsimonious Ways, Let me with Comfort spend my latter Days: My Stomach's weak, I'm not content to eat Lean powder'd Beef, but must have finer Meat: I cannot fare like those unletter'd Brutes, Born to hard Labour and unbutter'd Roots. Let me enjoy what my Estate affords; I'll not be starv'd to pile up useless Hoards For my proud Daughters, and my thankless Son, To lavish when my fleeting Sands are run. Let me have well-spread Tables when I dine; Grutch me no dainty Food, or costly Wine, Since I have Wealth enough to bear the Charge Of living more at Ease, and more at large. Wife. Prithee, my Dear, consider Times are hard, Trade much reduc'd, and greater Evils fear'd; Taxes run high, and daily must encrease, Whilst War excludes the kind Effects of Peace. This is no happy Juncture to become Abroad a Spendthrift, or profuse at Home; No Season to be liberal or great, When War devours one third of your Estate, Whilst the Remainder at the Mercy lies Of giving Pow'rs too generously wise; Therefore who would not save whate'er he cou'd, 'Less in an Age so hazardous he shou'd Be beggar'd by that Cheat, the Publick Good? Husband. Thy Av'rice fills thy Soul with sad Despair, And makes thee dream of Dangers God knows where. Let not such foolish Fears afflict thy Breast; We're happy, if we know when we are blest. Let our wise Senate give whate'er they please, We still shall find enough to live at Ease. What tho' the crafty Courtiers wealthy grow, By Ways and Means which they themselves best know; E'en let them share the Nation's Golden Fleece, Foxes are us'd to prey upon the Geese; Yet tho' the Laws compel us to resign One third of what we hold in Land or Coin, Let's be content, not think our selves opprest, But with an easy Mind enjoy the rest; For the rich Fool that starves before he needs, Chuses unforc'd that very Curse he dreads: As fearful Mariners too often run Into those Dangers they desire to shun, And wanting Conduct, are, alas! destroy'd Upon those Shelves which wiser Heads avoid; Therefore, my Dear, let us not be so dull, To want Life's Comforts whilst our Bags are full, But spend in Plenty what we starve to save, And merit by our Bounty what we have. Wife. Since Nature covets but a small Supply, The mod'rate Liver does the most enjoy; For more than human Life or Health require, Is vain Excess, which only Fools admire: Gluttons and Drunkards, who confound their Store In half their Days, to live when aged poor. Man's Happiness on Earth consists, we see, In healthful Temp'rance and Frugality. Those who possess these Vertues, always find The Sweetness of a calm contented Mind; Improve their Fortunes, and preserve their Ease, Which Spendthrifts lavish in their Luxuries, Who swell to Monsters e'er they see their Prime, By drinking hard, or eating to a Crime; Wasting their Wealth, by painful Parents rais'd, Glory'ng the most, when they are most debas'd; As if, to conquer others by full Quarts, Advanc'd their Fame, and shew'd their great Deserts. Would you be one of these fantastick Apes, To drown your Substance in the Blood of Grapes; Or waste your solid Treasure, to delight The vicious Longings of your Appetite? Would you turn Sot, God's Blessings thus misuse, And at your Cost your self and Friends abuse? If such a Life you'd lead, pray where's the Sense Of growing wicked at your own Expence? Or would you feast a Croud of Fools each Day, That they may laugh, while you the Charge defray; And your Estate impair, that you may pass, With Sots and Flatt'rers, for a gen'rous Ass, Who, at your Table, will your Treats commend, But when you need 'em, cease to be your Friend? If these you want, make Haste to be undone, And order twenty Dishes for your one. Husband. Your Brains, my Dear, are full of frantick Dreams; Is there no Medium 'twixt the two Extreams? Must I all needful Comforts be deny'd, Or to profuse Extravagance be ty'd? Cannot I give my self a grateful Meal, But I must feast the World with Ortland Teal? Or grace my Table ev'ry Day I dine, With a digestive Glass of noble Wine, But I must turn a thoughtless Sot, a Beast, And ruin my Estate to treat my Guest? Sure there are Ways of living free from Want, Between the Miser and Extravagant! Sure Men of Wealth may find a happy State, And neither seem too little, or too great. I ne'er took Pleasure in a vain Excess, Nor do I love a Miser's Stinginess: But since by Heav'n I'm blest with an Estate, I'll not be us'd at this penurious Rate: Give me the best of Meats to please my Taste; Let me have Plenty, I desire no Waste: A well-spread Table I delight to see, According to my Wealth and Quality, That Friend or Neighbour, when they come to dine, May find no Want of wholsome Food or Wine. Wife. But you have sev'ral Daughters still to wed, Ripe for the Pleasures of the nuptial Bed: Consider, Dear, their Fortunes must be large; To match 'em well, will prove no little Charge; They'll sink your Bags, and weaken your Estate. Why therefore will you think of living great, Till you've dispos'd your Daughters to your Mind, And shewn how far you're willing to be kind? For Parents are in Duty bound to place Their Children in a State of Happiness, That we, to whom they owe their Birth, may be Blest, when we're old, in their Prosperity. Is it not better we should sparing live, That to our Offspring we the more may give, Than to be lavish of your wealthy Store, And, to feast others, leave our Children poor? Husband. Duty, I own, commands us to extend Our Love to those who on our Care depend, And that a Father is by Nature ty'd, For his dear Childrens Welfare, to provide; But still no Parent is oblig'd to make His Life unhappy, for his Offsprings Sake; And tho he's rich, live sparingly and poor, That when he's gone, they may enjoy the more: A due Provision ought to be his Care; But he's a Fool that starves, to bless his Heir. Must wealthy Fathers like Curmudgeons live, That to their Children they the more may give? Must I repine beneath a Miser's Fate, To make my Sons and Daughters rich and great? No, no, my Dear, from this Time you shall see Such female Doctrine shall not take with me; I'll not with Legs and Shins of Beef be fed, That they may feast on Dainties when I'm dead; Nor in coarse Kersies wrap my wither'd Hide, That my fair Daughters may in Coaches ride. Pray let my Table, ev'ry Day I eat, Be furnish'd with the best of Butchers Meat, With Fish and Fowl, when I have Friends to dine, And a full Cistern of salubrious Wine; Let my fine Linnen on the Board be spread, And not for Daughters kept till I am dead; I'll have no Hussif's dirty Flaxen brought, But ev'ry Day clean Damask, as I ought, That Friends or Strangers, when they're here, may see I live to my Estate and Quality. Your self may be as saving as you please, But I'll consult my Credit and my Ease; No more conform to a penurious Life, To please a whining parsimonious Wife, Who, were you ne'er so wealthy, still would be A stingy Muckworm to your self and me; Drudge on, pile up, live mean, without a Friend, And curse each useful Penny that you spend. So slaving Misers, when too rich they're grown, Hide what they earn, and still for more toil on; Conceal their Worth, by wearing homely Rags, And pine their empty Guts, to fill their Bags. Wife. You talk, my Dear, as if you meant to waste, In your old Age, what you have long possest. Consider, Love, if you resolve to run This fatal Race, we shall be all undone: You're frantick sure. Can you, alas! afford To treat so high, and revel like a Lord? You got your Wealth by your industrious Wits, Improv'd the same in Trade by lucky Hits; But pray consider those good Days are past; And would you spend it idly now at last? Shame on the Follies of your aged Head, From whence was this devouring Maggot bred? What strange bewitching Fate hangs o'er your Gold, And makes you now turn Spendthrift when you're old? What ill-got Sums lie mingl'd with your Hoard, Curs'd by some Orphan till again restor'd? Prithee, my Dear, return the Canker Home, Let no base Pounds the honest Part consume; For sure some sinful Bags, by Fraud obtain'd, Giv'n as a Bribe, or by Oppression gain'd, Corrupt your Cash, and poyson your Estate; Or, in your latter Years, your addl'd Pate Would ne'er contrive to lavish your Estate. Husband. Since bounteous Fortune has so kindly blest My careful Toils for forty Years at least, That, to my Joy, I now abound, when old, With fruitful Acres, and with Sums of Gold, Honour'd long since with Knighthood for my Wealth, Now free from Bus'ness, happy in my Health; I tell thee, Wife, or Lady, if you please, No want of Plenty shall obstruct my Ease; But in my Age I'll generously live, Yet spend with Prudence, and with Caution give; Revive my crusty Nerves with Wine that's good, And add new Springs to my declining Blood; Make much of Friends, be hospitably free, And, whilst I live, bestow my Charity. This in Contempt of Avarice I'll do, T'oblige my self, my Dear, in spite of you; And if you frown at Dinner on my Friends, Or your keen Tongue beyond its Bounds extends, Then to some distant Tavern will I roam, And drown in Sack the Plagues I have at Home; Turn a mere vicious Spendthrift, tho' Im old, And prove as great a Rake, as you a Scold: But if I find that you will easy be, Respectful to my Friends, and kind to me, Then shall you see, that I will spend to spare, And tho' I'm gen'rous, it shall be with Care, That when I've made my Exit, you shall find, Tho' I liv'd well, I've left enough behind. Therefore, my Dear, let me, without Debate, Enjoy the happy Fruits of my Estate; For who would labour, in his Youth, for Gold, To pine beneath a Miser's Fate, when old? Wife. A Wife's good Counsels are in vain, I know; For Men, when old, like Trees, more stubborn grow; As one's too knotty and too stiff to bend, So t'other proves too resolute to mend; But since a Woman must be thought too weak And foolish to controul, advise, or speak, And Man's too proud to bend, take Care you do not break. Moral Reflexions on the foregoing Dialogue. [He that has Wealth to bless his Life] He that has Wealth to bless his Life With Comforts that are are needful, Ought not to humour such a Wife, That's over close and heedful. Women grow covetous, when old, And we must watch their Waters, Or they'll deprive us of our Gold, To hoard it for their Daughters. They care not how their Husbands live, How seldom 'tis they feast well, If they can but large Fortunes give, To have their Daughters kiss'd well. But he's a Fool that fills his Bags By his successful Labours, And then lives poor, wrapt up in Rags, Despis'd among his Neighbours: And all, to leave his Wealth behind To Children disobedient; Or to a Wife, who has Mind To try a new Expedient. Therefore the Niggard is to blame, Of future Woes deserving, Who leaves his Offspring, or his Dame, The richer for his starving. Dialogue XI. Between a Termagant Court-Lady, and her Spouse, about settling in the Country. Wife. Since you, my Dear, a Country Life admire; You, if you please, may to your Seat retire; In Fogs and Dews survey your fertile Grounds, And strain your Hunters, to pursue your Hounds. But be assur'd, that I abhor to dwell A pensive Pris'ner in a rural Cell; Where, by the break of Day, your bleating Sheep And lowing Oxen, must disturb my Sleep: Where croaking Ravens stretch their boding Throats, To fright sick Gammers with their hideous Notes; And with their Jargons of unwelcome Noise, Call early Milk-maids, and their Clowns, to rise. Go thither you, but I resolve to stay In Town, where all Things look so spruce and gay, And fresh Delights spring up with ev'ry new-born Day. Husband. Tho' I am kind, and study your Delight, Love you all Day, and hug you close at Night, I find you will be stubborn, Chloe, still, Whose chiefest Pleasure is to thwart my Will. Why, Madam, do you thus torment my Life, And strive to prove the Devil of a Wife? What have I done to make you so perverse? Bad you were always, but you now grow worse. As if the Serpent, that debauch'd Mankind, Had sooth'd thy Lust, and left his Sting behind. Wife. You take me sure, to be a monst'rous Brute! What, do you think me Satan's Prostitute? Thank you, my Husband, you're extreamly civil; I fear, my Love, you're jealous of the Devil. Husband. My Dear, consid'ring what a Shrew you're grown, I've almost cause to think you two are one; And that both Satan and your self, agree To gratify your Pride in plaguing me. What ever Measures for my Ease I take, You contradict, and labour still to break; And prove, in spite of all that Man can do, The worst tormenting Devil of the two. Wife. What Crimes have I committed, to incur Such Usage, and so vile a Character? Were e'er your Secrets by my Tongue betray'd? Or have I once defil'd your Marriage Bed? Have I at Basset, Omber, or Picquet, Lavish'd your Gold, and lessen'd your Estate? Do I go mobb'd to Play-house, or to Park, To steal some luscious Moments with my Spark? Or plague you Monthly with a Mercer's Bill, From Covent-Garden, or from Ludgate-Hill? Do I drink Ratafea, like Lady Punk, And cry, the Vapours, when I'm maudlin drunk? Or waste your Treasure in Physicians Fees, To humour each new fanciful Disease? Were I indeed like some that you admire, False, wanton, proud, profuse in my Attire, You then might use me thus; but I defy Your servile Spies to prove I've trod awry. Husband. You say you're honest; I believe so too; But Faith, my Dear, you're a confounded Shrew. What signifies your Virtue, when your Tongue Is with a thousand Plagues and Torments hung? So full of taunting Clamour and Abuse, None sure would bear it, but so tame a Goose, That's numb'd with Patience by continual Use. Wife. Bless me, Sir Humphry, you had need complain Of Womens Tongue, for being loose and vain, When those provoking Freedoms that you take, Would urge a Stone, if possible, to speak. How can you think, that I should patient be, And hear you thus affront my Quality? Have you not call'd me Shrew? O piercing Sting! And can a Lady be so vile a Thing? Foh! you provoking Man, the very Name Ferments my Blood, and puts me in a Flame. Had I the Daughter of an Hostess been, Nurs'd up with Ale in some White-Chappel Inn; Or had I been some home-spun Country Blowze, Bred up to serve the Hogs, and fodder Cows, Such Words might then have suited my Degree; But Shrew, I'd have you think's no Name for me! Such Terms are only fit for coarser Mold; Ladies may talk, but Ladies cannot scold. Husband. If bitter Words provokingly exprest, With all the Malice of an angry Breast; If Passion, Fury, and a clam'rous Tongue, With noisy, spiteful Contradictions hung; If a curs'd Temper, haughty and perverse, Subtl' as a Serpent, as a Tyger fierce; Unruly as the Jade that scorns the Bit, Not back'd in Time, too fiery to submit; Who, if he's spurr'd, will run away too fast, Or stand stock-still, when he should make most Haste; If Disregard of Heav'n, and Nature's Laws, And loud Complaints without a real Cause; If stubborn Pride, repugnancy of Will, And treach'rous Tears, like those of Crocadile; If thwarting Prattle, everlasting Tease, And Resolutions ne'er to be at Ease; Publick Contention, and untimely Jars, Noisy Cat Favours, and nocturnal Wars; If these good Qualities make Women Saints, Instead of restless Shrews and Termagants, Then, Madam, I'll agree with you, and own, Drabs may be Scolds, but Ladies can be none. Wife. I know you're mad, that I refuse to go Where dusky Woods abound, and Rivers flow; Where Birds in Groves their doleful Ditties sing, And Fairies dance by Moon-shine in a Ring; Where melancholy Owls, who shun the Light, Hoot to their moon-ey'd Mates their Love by Night; Where rural Swains their noisy Revels make, And o'er their Joans, their Leathern Breeches shake; Where Sun-burnt Slaves, on Holy-days repair, With their tann'd Trulls, to ev'ry Wake and Fair; Dance round their May-poles, till their clumsy Feet Poyson their Nostrils with their stinking Sweat; Till sick of their dull Sports, the Gluttons fly To th'Ale-house Orchard, hungry, hot, and dry; There with March-Beer, coarse Apple-pye, and Cheese, Cram their wide Gullets, and their Palates please; Till drunk and mad, then to conclude their Feast, With sturdy Blows decide who danc'd the best. Are these Delights for Chloe's Youth design'd? Thanks to your Love; I'll swear you're wondrous kind. You know, my Dear, such Pastimes must agree Most nicely with my Birth and Quality! Can you believe, that I, who long have known The various Pleasures of this charming Town, The Grandeur of a Court, where all Things shine, As if the Place was Heav'n, and Man divine, Can quit such Blessings, for a rural Life, Adapted to a Plough-man and his Wife, Or poor dispairing Souls, who chuse to dwell In Solitude, to wait their Passing-Bell? No, no; I thank my Stars, I'm in my Wits: Troubl'd with no such melancholy Fits. I'm not grown lunatick with cloudy Dreams Of flow'ry Meads, dark Groves, and purling Streams, I'm not in Love; I want no Rosy Bow'r To meditate on Shadows by the Hour. Nor am I bred to Pickles or Preserves, Or to make Balsams for your feeble Nerves. I cannot teach your Maids to bake or brew, Or distil Cordials for your Grooms and you. I am no Doctress, that pretends to cure The Coughs and Ptisicks of your neighb'ring Poor; Or have I Skill or Charity to spread A Plaister for a bruis'd or broken Head; Or can I boast so much Humility, To salve the Cut-Thumbs of your Family; And, upon all Occasions, undertake The nauseous Drudg'ry of a rural Quack. Therefore if you expect that I should prove So great a Slave, to manifest my Love, You're much deceiv'd; I'd sooner chuse the Life Of a Town Miss, than such a Country-Wife. Husband. Nobly resolv'd, most condescending Spouse. Who'd think the Lady should out-do the Blowze? And that a Wife of your illustrious Birth, Possess'd of so much Vertue, Wit, and Worth, Should rather chuse to prostitute your Charms, Than quit the Town, where Vice profusely swarms? Break thro' the Fences of your Marriage-Trust, And become servile to another's Lust, Before you'd wave your Humour to fulfil The just Engagements of your Husband's Will? If Lady Wives have Right to disobey Their wedded Lords, who ought to bear the Sway: If Ladies have a Privilege to rule, To rave, contend, teaze, bicker, and controul, As if their Fortune, Beauty, and their Blood, Made them, if bad, appear divinely good; Would I had first preserv'd some rural Maid, From Cowl and Hog-tub, to my nuptial Bed, Or chosen some poor, harmless, tatter'd Wench, From Herb-stall, or from off some Alley-bench, Ere I had curs'd my Sheets with such a She, That boasts so much of Birth and Quality, Yet can out-scold a Trull, a Wapping Quane, But do't, forsooth, with a more graceful Mein; Teaze and torment at an imperious Rate, But still take Care to domineer in State. Since these your Ladyship's Perfections are, Which I am doom'd by Wedlock thus to bear; As Gilders cover Brass and Dross with Gold, And Gard'ners over Dung sift finest Mold; So you may boast a Lady's outward Skin, But, by my Soul, you're Drab and Dev'l within. Moral Reflexions on the foregoing Dialogue. [The buxom Lady, bred in Town] The buxom Lady, bred in Town, Where Crowds of Beaus admire her, And chase her Beauty up and down, To shew how they desire her, Is so bewitch'd to London Streets, Where Villains shine in Splendor; And ev'ry wealthy Fool she meets Maintains his Miss in Grandeur, That she disdains a Country-Life, And all its vertuous Pleasures, Because in Town, each Lady Wife May take her own loose Measures The Husbands revel, whore, and drink; Wives keep their Beaus and Nisies: Thus all grow wicked, so they wink At one another's Vices. That he who does to London come, To wed a Town bred Woman, Had better range the Woods at Home, With Joler, and with Bowman. For Sodom's Daughters can't conform To Pleasures that are rural: But like to live where Blockheads swarm, And loving Sisters whore all. Dialogue XII. Between a depending Courtier, who would have sacrific'd the Chastity of his Wife to a certain Great Man, in hopes of Preferment, and his vertuous Lady, who was avers'd to a Compliance. Wife. My Dear, what makes my Lord his Visits pay So oft? For he was here again to Day, Teazing my Ears with such respectful Praise, I know not what he means by what he says: Sometimes he treats me with a Love Intrigue, Then gazing on my Face, he flirts his Wig; Walks too and fro the Room, then down he sits, Pauses and sighs, as if beside his Wits: Sometimes he smiles, and compliments me high, And oft does into frantick Raptures fly; Then, rising from his Seat, he springs in Haste, Forces a Kiss, and hugs me round the Waste, Then down he sets me, rubs against my Knees, Presses my Breast, and gives my Hand a Squeeze, Tells me how much my Beauty he admires, Talks of Love Passions, and of am'rous Fires. Wishing his own young Lady could but bless His Bed with half the Charms that I possess. With such like Flatt'ries does he stuff my Ears, As if he meant t'affront me with his Jeers; Nor can I rude or disrespectful be, Because I'm so beneath his Quality; Next, 'cause I know that you so much depend Upon his Honour, as your only Friend; Therefore what Measures I shall use, pray tell, For I am apt to fear he means not well. Husband. I know he loves you; I have heard him swear, Of all your Sex, you're most divinely fair; And that he thinks me happy in a Wife. Whose Charms are fit to bless a Monarch's Life: Whene'er he asks me kindly how you do, His tender Manner does his Passion shew; And when he walks, and talks to me aside, He ne'er forgets his Wishes to my Bride; Makes you the Object of his fond Desires, And seems to whisper what his Love requires; For I have often heard him sigh, and cry, He'd give the World to be as blest as I; Then vowing much Respect for you and me, Would swear I should ere long his Friendship see. In short, he does for you such Love express, That what he means, you cannot chuse but guess. Wife. With how much Patience you conceive his Flame, And to my glowing Ears convey the same, As if you thought it, like a shameful Cow'rd, An Honour to be rivall'd by a Lord? How could you hear his odious Love exprest, And keep your Sword from his adult'rous Breast; Or tamely lissen to a treach'rous Friend, Who does the Beauty of your Wife commend In such an odious Manner, as to shew His Lust for her, and his Contempt of you? You talk as calmly of his loose Desires, As if you'd have me grant what he requires; And that, for Reasons to your self best known, You'd Pimp for her the Laws have made your own. Prithee, my Dear, the Mystery disclose, And let me know what he or you propose? If to your Lordly Friend you prove so kind, You ought to first acquaint me with your Mind; For when a Woman's Honour lies at Stake, 'Tis fit you should to her the Secret break. Husband. You know, my Dear, that he's a pow'rful Man, Great in Estate, and high in the Divan; Behind the Curtain turns the grand Machine, Puts others out, and who he pleases in: Who therefore would not make one Step awry, To win the Smiles of such a Friend thereby, Who, by those Favours he would gladly spare, Can make us much more happy than we are? Besides, my Dear, you may resign your Charms With so much Conduct to his longing Arms, That no discerning Eye can trace your Love, Or watch the happy Minute you improve; And whilst our Vices are conceal'd from Fame, We 'njoy the Pleasure, but escape the Shame. Who then would such a lucky Hour deny, And lose the Prospect of such wealthy Joy; When, by a trifling Sin, to th'World unknown, With Care repeated, unsuspected done, We may, perhaps, advance our meaner State, And rise from narrow Fortunes, to be great? Wife. Well said, my patient Spouse, I'm glad to find You'll grant your Wife such License to be kind: Since you consent, I should adorn your Brows, And for your Int'rest, break my nuptial Vows. I hope you'll give me Leave to please my Mind With those I like, when I am so inclin'd: If I for Profit may unfold my Arms, Sure, for my Pleasure, I may use my Charms; For she that's wicked to support her Pride, When Love appears, must yield to be enjoy'd. But sure, my Dear, you only talk to try How far vain Hopes would bring me to comply; And whether I'd be forward to defile My nuptial Honour, for a Courtier's Smile. Such awkward Counsels surely must arise, From some conceal'd Distrusts or Jealousies: I fancy that you only importune Your Wife to what you think's already done; Therefore I beg you to be free and plain, That I may truly know what 'tis you mean. Husband. By all that's sacred, I have no Design, But what's for both your Benefit and mine: I know my Lord's devoted to your Charms, And sighs and pines to hug you in his Arms. Would you but once with his Desires comply, His Heart would be enslav'd 'twixt you and I; Your Beauty might command whate'er you pleas'd, Was but his Love, by your Indearments, eas'd: Would you surrender what he wants to take, I should fare well for my Dorinda's sake; To high Preferments I should quickly rise, And Jems would sparkle round your beauteous Eyes; Yet with due Care you might your Honour keep, And in his Arms with Reputation sleep; For I my self can cover the Disgrace, And give your secret Joys an honest Face; Guard you from prying Servants, till he's cloy'd, That what you do may common Fame avoid. Many by such Compliance rise at Court; 'Tis a sure way to win the nobler sort: Beauty's Man's only Advocate among The greater Rank, that rule the humble Throng. The other Day, a Captain in the Host, By the same Means, obtain'd a higher Post: Why therefore will you keep me at a stand, When your kind Charms may Wealth and Pow'r command? Wife. You're serious then, I find you're well agreed My Lord should share the Pleasures of your Bed; That your fair Wife should prostitute her Charms, And with Adult'ry stain her vertuous Arms; Fawn on your Friend, and alienate from you A Heart that has been always kind and true; Adorn your Forehead with an odious Crest, And make you ev'ry Beau and Blockhead's Jest; Despise you, flout you, bastardize your Race, Whilst he that horns you, whispers your Disgrace, Till thro' the Brothel Court, and next the Town, My Whoredom, and your Complaisance are known. Nobly resolv'd, and courteously advis'd! Am I oblig'd, or do you think surpriz'd, To hear such Counsel from a Husband's Mouth, Whose Happiness should center in my Truth? Bless me! was ever such a gen'rous Spouse, Who, to indear his Friend, not onl' allows, But courts his Wife to hornify his Brows! Husband. Fear not the Pleasures you may thus bestow, Since none besides our selves the Secret know. My Lord's a Man of Honour, and disdains To boast the happy Favours he obtains; Nor dare I broach the Liberties you take, 'Less my own Tongue my self should odious make: So that you must be safe in his Embrace, Unless your Folly blads your own Disgrace. Who therefore would not value the Esteem Of him who loves to such a fond Extream, Since you have my Consent to freely grant The utmost Joys his eager Soul can want? And when your Husband's Welfare does depend Upon your Kindness to his only Friend, And you have my Command to yield a Part Of your Delights, to ease another's Heart; It then becomes your Duty to resign, And, if a Sin, it is not yours, but mine. Woman in all Things should her Lord obey; And if, by my Advice, you go astray, It is not you that err, but I that lead the Way. Wife. The Wife's a Subject to her Spouse, 'tis true, And I allow that I am so to you; But if a Husband shall presume so far, As to command his lawful Wife to err, And she's convinc'd, that what her Spouse enjoins, Is justly rank'd among the worst of Sins; If she complies with your obscene Command, Guilty with you she equally must stand; For human Pow'rs all lawful Bounds exceed, When they require what Heaven's Laws forbid. Besides, had you the least Remains of Love, How could you basely condescend to move Your vertuous Wife to break her nuptial Trust, And become servile to another's Lust? Husband. Prithee, dear Fool, be not so nicely coy, When both our Int'rest tempts you to the Joy. The Thoughts of Wealth should stem your Female Fears; All Things should bow, when sov'reign Gold appears: The very Priests who painfully instil Those pious Rules, that triumph o'er your Will, When Int'rest beckons will the Text prophane, And change their Doctrine many ways for Gain; Princes themselves, whose Royal Faces shine Thro' their whole Kingdom on their glitt'ring Coin, Shew, by imprinting of their Image there, What Reverence to mighty Gold they bear; And, to repleat their Treasures, will comply With wond'rous Things, unknown to you and I; Such that would make us startle, could we peep Within those Royal Curtains where they sleep. In short all Vertue, tho' it's ne'er so nice, Stoops to the pleasing Joys of wealthy Vice, Only the Great put on a better Face, And gild their Lewdness with a nobler Grace. Why then should stubborn Vertue disagree With such a prosp'rous Opportunity, And lose the Blessings you might now improve By secret Dalliance, and dissembl'd Love? Wife. Shame on your base and treacherous Advice; I scorn your Dictates, and your Lord despise: Nor shall so tame a Wretch, that would seduce Your Wife, for Int'rest, to another's Use, And court me thus to prostitute my Charms To such a faithless Friend's adult'rous Arms, E'er bed me more; for I abhor the Thought Of loving such a Brute, or proving naught, To gratify the base ignoble End Of such an odious Spouse, or hateful Friend. Blush at your Crime, and curse your wretched Life, For aiming to betray so just a Wife, Whose Blood untainted chills in ev'ry Vein, That Nature should produce so vile a Man. Who could, with Patience, hear his Friend impart Such Wishes, and not stab him to the Heart? The gen'rous Bull his lustful Rival gores, Assaults him boldly with his utmost force, Defends his Herd, that they may constant prove, And scorns his Fellow-Beast should share their Love. The noble Horse will, for his Female, fight His grazing Neighbour that invades his Right; Disdains his Mistress should to others yield, Whilst his strong Hoofs can guard her in the Field. The meanest Brute that moves upon the Ground, The Cat, the Rat, the very Hare, or Hound, All struggle hard, and shew their zealous Care, That none shall in their Mate's Concessions share, The Dung-hill Cock will make his Rival feel The pointed Fury of his armed Heel, And, tho' a Coward, yet he'll dare his Fate, T'ingross the Favours of his feather'd Mate. But thou, vile Wretch, more brutish far than they, Would'st thy own Wife to others Arms betray, Induce her to be odiously unjust, And make thy self a Pander to her Lust. Shame on thy treach'rous and ignoble Mind, And the foul Heart of thy lascivious Friend. Go tell the vicious Rake, the garter'd Fool, My Vertue scorns to be a Lord's Close-stool. Bid him go search the Brothels, and the Stage, Where mercenary Sluts for Gold engage; Or, in the Ev'ning, range the airy Parks, Where jilting Ladies meet their brawny Sparks: There let him breathe forth his obscene Desires To those that like to quench such lustful Fires; Adult'rous Dames of Quality, who burn For such as he to serve their odious Turn. Tell him, from me, that I despise and hate His Pomp, his Pow'r, his Person, and Estate, And sooner would consent to spend my Life In a mean Hut, some honest Shepherd's Wife, Than sacrifice my Vertue and my Charms To his, or to a King's adult'rous Arms; For the chaste Woman, in the meanest State, Enjoys more Comfort than the vicious Great. As for your Part, I'll fly from your Embrace; I hate a Wretch so infamously base: I'll to my rural Friends with speed retire, Tell them the kind Concessions you require, That they may know how far your gen'rous Mind Is to my Welfare and your own inclin'd. No more, false Man, shall you enjoy a Smile From her, in vain you've labour'd to beguile; For what just Wife, that has been kind and chaste, Would hug a treach'rous Serpent in her Breast, Whose Love's so little, and his Pride so great, That he'd defile her Charms to live in State? Farewell, I'll date thy Hatred from this Time, And leave you to repent your shameful Crime. Husband. May Hell and Fury follow where she goes, Since her nice Vertue such Resentment shows; And if I find, that she in spite declares The Secret I've imparted to her Ears, (For Wives can seldom from their Sex conceal What their own Pride excites them to reveal) Then, in Revenge, I'll say, I only try'd Her Virtue, and aver, that she comply'd, And that I turn'd her off, because I found My jealous Conflicts had sufficient Ground; Vow that I lov'd, whilst she was kind and good, And, tho' I think her chaste, I'll swear she's lewd. What I assert's most likely to prevail, Whilst few will credit her prepost'rous Tale; For who can think a Husband such a Brute, To court his Wife to grant so strange a Suit, As to become another's Prostitute? Moral Reflexions on the foregoing Dialogue. [Tho' good Men scarce believe there's such] Tho' good Men scarce believe there's such A wicked Brute in Nature, That would endeavour to debauch His lawful Wife or Daughter, Yet sure it is, that many rise To profitable Places, 'Cause their Wives yield, by their Advice, To greater Mens Embraces. He who a handsome Wife can boast, That's free of her Indearments, If he'll be horn'd, to gain a Post, Need never fear Preferments. The Great, who gratify each Gust, Are prompt by their Excesses, To humour their insatiate Lust With new inviting Faces. The Coward oft has Captain's Pay, And makes the State his Bubble, Because his Wife has found a Way To please some gouty Noble. In short, could Men of Vertue see The Evils done in private, They'd blush at modern Quality, And wonder what they drive at. Dialogue XIII. Between a squeamish cotting Mechanick, and his sluttish Wife, in the Kitchen. Husband. Is the Fish ready? You're a tedious while; Take Care the Butter does not turn to Oil: Lay on more Coals, and hang the Pot down low'r, Or 'twill not boil with such a Fire this Hour. Is that, my Dear, the Sause-pan you design To stew the Shrimps, and melt the Butter in? Nouns! within side as nasty it appears, As if't had ne'er been scow'r'd this fifty Years. Rare Hussifs! how confounded black it looks! God sends us Meat, the Devil sends us Cooks. Wife. Why how now, Cot! Must I be taught by you? Sure I without you know what I've to do. Prithee go mind your Shop, attend your Trade, And leave the Kitchen to your Wife and Maid. O'erlook your 'Prentices, you Cot, and see They do their Work, leave Cookery to me. Is't fit a Man, you contradicting Sot, Should mind the Kettle, or the Porridge-pot, And run his Nose in ev'ry dirty Hole, To see what Platter's clean, what Dish is foul? Be gone, you prating Ninny, whilst you're well, Or, faith, I'll pin the Dish-clout to your Tail. Husband. I'll not be poyson'd by a sluttish Quane. Hussy, I say, go scow'r the Sauce-pan clean. What, tho' your Mistress is a careless Beast, I love to have my Victuals cleanly drest! Cot me no Cots, I'll not be bound to eat Such dirty Sauce to good and wholesome Meat. I will direct and govern, since I find You're both to so much Nastiness inclin'd. I'd have you know, I neither fear or matter Your threaten'd Dish-Clouts, or your scalding Water. Wife. Stand by, you prating Fool, you damn'd Provoker, Or, by my Soul; I'll burn you with the Poker. Must I be thus abus'd, as if your Maid, And call'd a Slut before a saucy Jade? Gad, speak another, and, by my Troth, I'll spoil the Fish, and scald you with the Broth. The Kitchen fire, alas! don't burn to please ye; The Sauce pan is, forsooth, too foul and greasy. Minx, touch it not; I say it's clean enough, Your scow'ring rubs the Tin within side off: I'll have no melted Butter taste of Brass, To please the Humour of a squeamish Ass. If Cot-Comptroller does not like its Looks, Let him spend Six pence at his nasty Cooks, Where rotten Mutton, Beef that's Turnip fed, Lean meazly Pork on London Muck-hills bred, Will please the Fool much better than the best Of Meat by his own Wife or Servant drest. Why don't you thither go before you dine, Where you may see, perhaps, a noble Loin Of a Bull-Calf, lie sweating at the Fire, Beneath fat Pork, nurs'd up in T?d and Mire, And under that a Chump of Suffolk-Beef, Thrice roasted for some hungry Clown's relief, Till black as Soot, that from the Chimney falls, And hard as Severn-Salmon dry'd in Wales, All basted with a Flux of mingl'd Fat, Which greasily distils from this and that? Such nice tid cleanly Bits would please my Dear; Prithee go thither, do not plague us here. Husband. Hussy, what I direct, you ought to do, I'm Lord and Master of this House and you. Do you not know that wise and noble Prince, King 'Hasuerus, made a Law long since, That ev'ry Husband should the Ruler be Of his own Wife, as well as Family? How dare you then controul my lawful Sway, When Scripture tells you Woman should obey? Therefore, I say, I'll have my Fish well drest, After such manner as shall please me best, Or, Hussy, by this Ladle, if I han't, I'll make you shew good Reason why I shan't. I'll have more Coals upon the Fire, I tell ye, And have the Sauce-pan clean'd, aye marry will I, Or I'll acquaint your Teacher, Mr. Blunder, That all the Art of Man can't keep you under. Wife. Here, Hussy, fetch some Coals, 'tis long of you That we have ev'ry Day all this to do. Pray clean the Sauce-pan, you forgetful Trull, I must confess it looks a little dull. You shall not say I love this jarring Life, You shall have no Complaints against your Wife. But prithee, Husband, leave us, and be easy, Ne'er doubt but I will cook your Fish to please ye. When Men o'erlook us, we proceed in fear, And ne'er can do so well when they are near; Therefore I hope, my Dear, you will not mind A Woman's Passion, Words you know are Wind. I would not for the World have Mr. Blunder Know that we jar, the good old Man would wonder That you and I, who've been so long his Hearers, Should now want Grace, and fall into such Errors. Husband. Since you repent your Failings, I'll be gone, But prithee let the Fish be nicely done. I buy the best, and whether roast or boil'd, You know I hate to have my victuals spoil'd. Wife. My Dear, I'll take such Care, that you shall find It shall be rightly order'd to your Mind. I'm glad he's gone. Pox take him for a Cot, What Wife would humour such a snarling Sot? Here, Kather'n, take my Keys, slip gently by The Fox, and fetch a Dram for thee and I: Lay down the Sauce-pan; poh! it's clean enough For such an old, ill natur'd, stingy Cuff. Prithee ne'er value what thy Master says, You should not mind his cross-grain'd, foolish ways; But when I bid you, Hussy, you must run; Now his Back's turn'd, the Kitchen is our own. Bless me! how eas'ly can a Woman blind And cheat a Husband, if he proves unkind: He thinks, poor Cuckold, that he bears the Rule, When Heaven knows I do but gull the Fool. Moral Reflexions on the foregoing Dialogue. [A prudent Man should never pry] A prudent Man should never pry Beneath a Husband's Station; For if he does, he'll often spy What causes his Vexation. Wives in the Kitchen ought to bear Superior Domination; If we direct or meddle there, 'Tis constru'd Usurpation. Besides, whoever thwarts his Wife In culinary Matters, Is sure to lead a wretched Life, And fish in troubl'd Waters. For tho' a Wife, thro' Folly, errs, And wants to be conducted, Yet by a Man, in such Affairs, She hates to be instructed. That makes so many marry'd Pair Create their own Uneasiness, Because they love to interfere In one another's Business. A prudent Man will not invade A Woman's proper Station, But leave his Kitchen, and his Maid, To female Domination. Dialogue XIV. Between a pious Clergy-man, and his vertuous Lady. Wife. Sure, if your sinful Congregation thought The Doctrine true, which you so long have taught, They would forsake those Evils they pursue, And be admonish'd to reform by you! But still you preach, and pray for them in vain; For still their wicked Habits they retain. What means this strange Defect in human Race, So deaf to Reason, and averse to Grace, That tho' you teach their Duty ev'ry Day, Yet all those Heav'nly Laws they disobey, And shun, without Remorse, the righteous Way? Husband. Men are by Nature viciously inclin'd, And inward Lusts corrupt the feeble Mind: Sinful Desires with Life it self take Place, But Vertue and Religion come by Grace; Gifts which good Heaven does to none reveal, But those who seek 'em with their utmost Zeal. The faithful Christian labours to be good, And checks the vicious Fevers in his Blood, By Weeping, Fasting, Temperance, and Pray'rs, And mixes holy Thoughts with worldly Cares; Is always mindful of the God that gives That daily Bread by which he moves and lives; Contemplates calmly on the Things above, And with an humble Soul seeks Heaven's Love; Esteems the Riches of a peaceful Mind, And is a righteous Friend to all Mankind. But most Men are, by worldly hopes, misled To follow those Delights they ought to dread; Nurs'd up in Pride and Folly from a Child, And by their Parents bad Examples spoil'd; Taught by ill Practices, they shun the Good, And prove revengeful, treacherous, and lewd, Perfidious, spiteful, covetous, and base, Unlearn'd in Faith, intractable to Grace, Till against both they are by Satan arm'd, And wicked Nature is too far confirm'd; Then, deaf to all Instructions, they proceed In their ill Lives, and no Correction heed; Thoughtless of Death, and hopeless of Reward, They throng the Church, without the least Regard To the blest Office of the sacred Day, But sleep or gaze, and neither hear nor pray. So curious Sinners will sometimes repair To diff'rent Worships they abhor to hear, Where, wanting Zeal to practise what they see, They neither lift an Eye, or bend a Knee, But think the Teacher of the Tribe a Fool, And turn his honest Words to ridicule. How therefore can you think that such a Race Of Vipers, who the sacred Pile disgrace, Should, by my Pains, their wicked Lives reform, Whilst Satan hugs them close, and keeps them warm? No, no, my Dear, the most prevailing Guide Will scarce conduct them to the righteous side; Unpolish'd Nature still will bear the sway, And make such Brutes their sinful Lusts obey; For those who want good Counsel when they're young, And due Correction both of Rod and Tongue, Grow stubborn when they're past their boyish fears, And will not be reclaim'd at riper Years. These, like Irrationals, unthinking dwell, Hope for no Heaven, as they fear no Hell; But head-long run, like foolish Sheep when lost, And heedless to their own Destruction post. Wife. Could they believe a God, and dread his Hate, Or truly think there was a future State, From Satan's Bondage sure 'twould set 'em free, And wake them from their dull Stupidity; For he that sees beyond the Vale of Death, And hopes hereafter for eternal Breath, Who in his Conscience knows he must surmount The silent Grave, to give a just Account Of Ills he us'd no Caution to avoid, And each past Moment that he misemploy'd, That his sad Soul on that tremendous Day, Must its last Doom, whate'er it is, obey, To be for ever blest above the Skies, Or curs'd to everlasting Miseries, There amongst Imps and Devils to remain, Where all Redemption must be hop'd in vain. Sure Thoughts like these would make a Sinner sad, Comfort the Just, and terrify the Bad; Give the most harden'd Conscience such a shock, That the lost Sheep would seek the holy Flock; Expel the Poyson in his lustful Veins; And closely hug those Vertues he disdains, Thro' Hopes of Heav'nly Joys, or Fear of Hellish Pains. Husband. The Wise reclaim as soon as well reprov'd, But stupid Folly's hard to be remov'd; Right thinking will reform the sinful Mind, But sordid Ignorance is deaf and blind. The Obstinate reject all good Advice, What injures them the most, they're apt to prize, And, what they ought to value, they despise. The Fool is always backward to believe, And hates to credit what he can't conceive; Will pin no Faith upon his painful Guide, But, what he does not understand, deride. Futurity to some does only seem A Poet's Fiction, or a Prophet's Dream; And Heav'n and Hell, by Scripture made so plain, Thought the wild Fancies of some teeming Brain. Therefore lewd Atheists, and contending Fools, Who war with all good Principles and Rules, And would be thought too cunning to rely Upon their holy Guide's Integrity, Will their own wilful Errors still pursue, In spite of all the Church can say or do. Th'unletter'd Dunce no Myst'ry can conceive; The learned Fool no Scripture will believe: The doubtful Sceptist will by Reason try Those Truths beyond the Reach of Reason's Eye: Th'inebrious Sinner's always drown'd in drink, And gives himself no leave to hear or think: Th'am'rous Heathen comes to Church to view His female Goddess dizen'd in her Pew; Worships his Madam in her flaming Pride, And neither minds his Duty or his Guide; Implores no other Blessings but her Charms, And thinks there is no Heav'n, but in her Arms. The neighb'ring Clowns, from mending of a Gap, Steal into Church to only take a Nap; And mind no more the Doctrine of the Day, Than when they're swearing on a Mow of Hay. The Lasses come to Church to chiefly shew Whose Pinner sits the best, whose Gown is new; And think of nothing all the Time they're there, But those that kiss'd 'em last at Wake or Fair. And when his Worship's in the Godly Vein To come to Church, which is but now and then, He falls asleep ere we have read the Lessons, And dreams, perhaps, of the next Quarter Sessions; Creeps close, unseen, i'th' Corner of his Pew, Ne'er minds the Priest, but nods the Sermon thro'. What can we do, or how in order keep A drowsy Flock of such unthinking Sheep? How should a Guide their Souls to Heaven steer? Or how instruct, if they refuse to hear? Wife. Since they the Doctrine of their Guide reject, Their Faults are owing to their own Neglect: You're just and painful in your past'ral Care, And cannot in their sinful Suff'rings share; At the last Judgment you'll be guiltless found; Tho the Flock's scabby, yet the Shepherd's sound. Therefore, my Dear, do you incur no Blame, And I'll still take Example by the same, That when the Trumpet shall our Ashes raise, We both in Heav'n may sing eternal Praise. Moral Reflexions on the foregoing Dialogue. [Our holy Guides may preach and pray] Our holy Guides may preach and pray In Pulpits 'till they're weary, If we resolve to disobey, And from their Precepts vary. The pious Priest may eas'ly win The Soul inclin'd to Goodness, But seldom draws the Man of Sin From his habitual Lewdness; 'Till, in his Age, the Wretch begins To feel his past Debauches; And then, perhaps, he'll curse the Sins That brought him to his Crutches. So that it is not what he hears From his laborious Teacher, But Gout or Stone, at feeble Years, That mends the crazy Letcher. The Seeds of Grace must in our Youth Be sown by Education, And then we grow in Faith and Truth, And feel their Operation. But if, when young, to lustful Rage We prostitute our Reason, We seldom then reform, 'till Age, Expels the sinful Poyson. Dialogue XV. Between a tender and religious Husband, and his barren melancholy Lady. Husband. Why so reserv'd and indispos'd, my Dear? What makes my Love so a la mort appear? As if some hidden Grief, or anxious Thought, A sudden change had in thy Temper wrought. How kind and pleasant did you use to prove, All over Freedom, Gayety, and Love, Chearful in Humour, spritely in your Mein, All Charms without, and peaceable within? But now, alas! each pensive Look declares You're sunk beneath a Load of teazing Cares; And that your tender Breast, which us'd to be From worldly Sorrows and Afflictions free, Has lost, on some Account, its sweet Repose, And feels those Pains you care not to disclose. Prithee, my Dear, the hidden Cause impart, That clouds your Charms, and so torments your Heart. A Wife should not ingross, but ease her Care, And let her Husband bear an equal Share; For both are bound, when either are opprest, To be a Comfort to each other's Breast. Wife. Prithee, my Dear, be easy, mind not me; Women sometimes will out of Humour be: Our Discontents in foolish Trifles lie; We're vex'd or pleas'd, and know no Reason why: Small Causes in our weak imprudent Sex, Will oft produce extravagant Effects: We're troubl'd with the Vapours, and from thence Our melancholy Whims sometimes commence: Our female Cares, like Castles in the Air, Are built so thin, they'll no Enquiry bear: Small Grief in us, a high Concern appears; What Men despise, will cause a Woman's Tears. Therefore I hope you are too wise to mind The unexpected Changes that you find In wav'ring Woman, fickle as the Wind. Husband. Why should you use Evasions, when you know I can't but share the Discontent you show? I grieve to see so fair and good a Wife, With needless Cares, perplex her nuptial Life; Draw Age upon her Charms before her Time, And make her anxious Thoughts her only Crime. Have I, by any slight, disturb'd your Mind? Am I morose when up, in Bed unkind? Have I one vicious Habit you abhor? Or do you think I ought to love you more? Have you not Cloaths, and all Things that agree With your Birth, Fortune, and your Quality? Or are you jealous that Abroad I shew More Kindness to some other Fair, than you? If any Slights of mine distastful prove, Let me but know, and I'll the Cause remove. Believe my Love is too sincere and great T'annoy your Ease, or to incur your Hate. Therefore, my Dear, if you delight to shew The same Regard that I profess for you, Tell me the Causes of your Discontent, That, by removing yours, I may my own prevent. Wife. In you I'm blest, and cannot but approve Your prudent Conduct, and your faithful Love: Had I a Myriad of delightful Charms, Or could I boast a Heaven in my Arms, All I could do to bless your gen'rous Mind, Would be too little for a Man so kind. Therefore, my Dear, in you I happy am, Beyond the Merits of so coarse a Dame; And should be base to murmur, or accuse So just a Man, who so much Kindness shews, That were I wealthy as the Mines of Spain, And unconfin'd, I'd chuse you o'er again; Yet there is something does my Ease destroy, And makes me wretched in the midst of Joy; Does all my Comforts into Sadness turn, And in the height of Pleasure, bids me mourn. Husband. What secret Causes can a Woman find, If blest in Marriage, to afflict her Mind? So long as she approves the Choice she's made, What frightful Notions can disturb her Head, Or plague her Breast, especially when free From Sickness, and secure from Poverty? 'Tis strange to me. But prithee, Dear, explain This Riddle hatch'd in thy uneasy Brain, That I may use such Measures as are best To drive these airy Phantoms from your Breast. Wife. Tho' at my Sorrows you are thus amaz'd, My Dear, I would not have you think I'm craz'd; Since Nature has abridg'd my female Pow'r, 'Tis for your sake that I my self abhor: For Man in Wedlock join'd, delights to see His Image in a lively Progeny, That as they flourish, and himself grows old, He may, in them, his Infant-State behold: Nor can a Husband truly love a Wife, That adds not these sweet Blessings to his Life; For Wedlock's but a License to enjoy, 'Tis Children that confirms the sacred Tie: And where those Blessings are with-held, I fear A Wife must lose th'Affections of her Dear. This is the only Cause that makes me mourn, And look upon my self with Shame and Scorn. Husband. Teaze not thy self with such unhappy Thoughts, The Want of Issue's neither of our Fau'ts; They are the Gift of Heaven, and bestow'd, Not when we please, but when the Lord thinks good. Should I your kind Abilities distrust, I should be sinful, cruel, and unjust: If Nature is to blame between us two, I might as well condemn my self as you. Should I on this Account less loving be, You've equal Cause to look with Scorn on me; For since the Means do both our Aid require, Who knows which wants the procreative Fire? But still the Fault does not on Nature fall, For there's a Power above that governs all; Who, by his secret Will, directs our Fate, And knows what's best for Man in ev'ry State. Therefore let no such Thoughts disturb your Ease; For 'tis a Sin to pine at Heav'n's Decrees. Wife. If Children that confirm our nuptial Love, Are allow'd Blessings given from above, Sure we have greatly sinn'd, that we're deny'd Those Comforts by the meanest Slaves enjoy'd. What have we done, that we alone should want What Heav'n to many does so freely grant? If the Celestial Pow'rs have less Regard For us, than others, still our Fate's more hard. The Arguments you urge, improve my Care, And only leave me in a worse Despair. Husband. But Children do not always Blessings prove Sometimes they're sent as Judgments from above. Harlots, we see, that prostitute their Charms, And yield their Favours to unlawful Arms, Against their Wills have Issue to proclaim Their Parents Lewdness, to their publick Shame, That Looks dissembl'd may no longer hide Those sinful Pleasures they've so long enjoy'd; But wanting Vertue, they at last may feel Th'Effects of what th'endeavour to conceal; For tho' the Vicious act their Joys by Night, Th'Event oft brings their secret Sins to Light. How oft are careful Mother's disobey'd, And by a wicked Offspring wretched made? How frequently do Sons unhappy prove, And Daughters yield to base unlawful Love; Grow proud and stubborn in their tender Years, And fill their Parents full of Cares and Fears; Despise the Womb that brought 'em forth with Pain, From Duty swerve, and all Advice disdain; As they advance in Years, grow worse and worse, So far from Blessings, that they prove a Curse; Pursue, without controul, their sinful ways, Till their own Vices end their wretched Days? Had we a Son, what Mortal can foresee, In spite of Care, how wicked he might be; Crooked in Body, or deform'd in Mind, Shallow in Intellects, dum, deaf, or blind; Perfidious, cruel, thirsty after Blood, Prone to all Mischief, and avers'd to Good; Perhaps, like Judas, destin'd to subdue His Father, and to wed his Mother too? Why therefore do you pine for what may prove A thorny Bryar to our nuptial Love, And breed that Variance we may ne'er survive, But feel the sad Effects of whilst we live? Besides, without Experience, none can guess The painful Sorrows, and the sad Distress With which each lab'ring Nerve and Vein is fill'd, Before the pregnant Womb its Fruits can yield. Many we see, who want sufficient Pow'r To struggle, perish in the fatal Hour, Too weak, alas! by Nature to sustain The grand Fatigue, they sink beneath the Pain. Why therefore do you wish to undergo Such Pangs, which do such Numbers overthrow, When the first Offspring you so much desire, May prove your last, and force you to expire? Therefore your want of Issue ne'er bemoan. But learn to be content that you have none, And bless good Heaven that you live so clear From Tortures other Wives are forc'd to bear. As for my Part, I love you ne'er the less, That we have hugg'd so long without Success; For I submit to Heav'n in all Affairs, And ne'er will wretched be for want of Heirs, Since they're oft destin'd, by their Stars, to prove Cares, and not Comforts, to their Parents Love. Why grieve you then, that Heaven denies to grant. What, f'r ought we know, 's our Happiness to want. Pine not, my dear Lucinda, since we both Are blest, 'less you provoke the Gods to Wrath; And, when they're angry, by your Prayers obtain A Child, whose stubborn Birth may prove your Bane, Or, if you live, torment you, and distract your Brain. Wife. Since you can love me, tho' I am not blest With your dear Image at my tender Breast, My future Grief I'll labour to prevent, And strive, my Dear, to be, like you, content; For 'twas my Fear your Kindness should decline, Thro' Want of Sons, that caus'd me to repine; But since you're easy, tho' my Fate be hard, Your pious Counsels, and your kind Regard For my afflicted Mind, my Cares remove, And make me happy in your gen'rous Love. Moral Reflexions on the foregoing Dialogue. [If a young Wife should want an Heir] If a young Wife should want an Heir, And pine at the Dishonour, Her Husband ought to have a Care How he reflects upon her, For if she, finds, that he believes, It's only her Misfortune, It's ten to one but she deceives Her Spouse behind the Curtain. For nothing grieves a Woman more, When jolly, gay, and youthful, Than to be thought without the Pow'r, When wed, of being fruitful. Therefore 'tis Prudence in a Man To ease her Peturbations, And cure her Sorrows, if he can, By pious Exhortations. For if a Husband once upbraids His Wife of being barren, Perhaps she'll suffer other Blades To sport within her Warren: And if she finds the Bus'ness done By sinful Copulation, Her Spouse must be content to own A mottl'd Generation. Dialogue XVI. Between a fond Gentleman, and his coaxing Lady. Husband. That Look, my Dear, was very kind, I vow: What charming Smiles are seated on your Brow? How fond and gay you of a sudden prove, All over Beauty, Pleasantry, and Love? Did you but know how this engaging Air Becomes a Woman so divinely fair, Sure you would never, in your Dumps, disguise, With sullen Pouts, the Lustre of those Eyes; But let your Spouse be always happy in The native Sweetness of your lovely Mein. Wife. Women at all Times can't alike be free, The best will now and then ill-humour'd be. I hope I'm courteous and obliging now; I'd always please you, if I knew but how. Did I not hug you in my Arms last Night, And summon all my Charms to your Delight? Did I not vow I'd be for ever true, Call you my Dear, as a good Wife should do? Be you respectful, you shall ever find That I'll be humble, diligent, and kind: But if you're slighting, peevish, and perverse, In short, 'twill make me prove as bad, or worse. Husband. I know, Belinda, that your Frowns are oft The politick Effects of Female Craft. You can seem angry, tho' your Mind's sedate, And hide your Love with a dissembl'd Hate; Be peevish, slighting, petulent, and soure, On purpose to exert your Beauty's Pow'r; That when your Frowns are vanish'd from your Brows, Your Smiles may prove more welcome to your Spouse. So misty Vapours from the Earth arise, And for a Time hide Phœbus from our Eyes; But when dispers'd the God the brighter seems, And we with greater Joy behold his Beams. Wife. Frowns are Advantages to female Smiles; A Woman's Poutings, are her Beauty's Foils. A Teaze in Season, but ferments the Blood, Revives the Spirits, does a Husband good. Lovers should jar, sick Fancy to restore, And hug the closer when the Quarrel's o'er. Were't not for clashing, Love would soon decay; And Time with less Delight would slide away. For Marriage-Feuds, that in the Day arise, Are recompens'd at Night with double Joys; Such that are hid from that insipid Life, Where dull Indiff'rence reigns 'twixt Man and Wife: For Love, like Musick, cannot perfect be, 'Less Discord's rightly mix'd with Harmony. Husband. 'Tis true, some Jars in Wedlock, that arise, Whet but our Appetites to nuptial Joys; Yet there are some Disputes, that disunite Our Hearts, and disappoint us of delight; Such that do oft turn mutual Love to Hate, And in revengeful Malice terminate: For Love, that with the greatest ardour burns, If ill rewarded, to Aversion turns. As the best Wines, if not preserv'd with Care, Will soon become the sharpest Vinegar. Wife. But what must be the Cause of such Disputes, That can change Lovers to such angry Brutes, And make them so revengeful and absurd, As strive to ruin what they once ador'd? Were all the vexing Discords to arise, That Wedlock could produce, or Fate devise, No Malice my Affections should suppress, Or make me love my Dear one jot the less. Husband. I'm glad, Belinda, you are so resolv'd; But you in Cares have ne'er been yet involv'd; You've no Occasion to disturb your Rest; No Provocations to inflame your Breast; No jealous Conflicts to distract your Soul; No stubborn Spouse your Humour to controul; No beauteous Rival kept beneath your Nose; No sordid Threats, no brutish Kicks or Blows; No angry, cross-grain'd Fool, no Midnight Rake; No Beastly Sot, to spew upon your Back; No Claps brought Home, no Bastards kept at Nurse; No saucy Duns, or that which still is worse, The Curse of Curses, an insolvent Purse. Would not these Plagues your female Patience move, And try your boasted Vertue, and your Love? But you have all Things that can please your Mind, A lib'ral Fortune, and a Husband kind; And therefore know not what it is to fear The Usage other Wives are forc'd to bear. Wife. Hardships, like these, I own might prove too great For feeble Woman to sustain their Weight. Had any Mistress in your Heart a share, I must confess I no Revenge should spare. The patient'st Wife alive, could never, sure, A Rival in her nuptial Bed endure: Such humble Acquiescence would proclaim A Woman's Folly, to her publick Shame, And shew the Wretch ridiculously tame: Or should you strike me in an angry Mood, You may be sure I'd poys'n you, if I cou'd: But Men, like you, of Breeding and of Birth, Can ne'er so far degen'rate from your Worth. Blows only pass 'twixt Porters and their Trulls, Where brutish Rage, instead of Reason, rules, Those of our Rank, altho' the Cause be great, Should scorn to jar at such a scoundrel Rate. All but these grand Abuses, as I live, I could forget, nay, heartily forgive; But Blows and Rivals are Affronts so evil, They'd make an Angel of a Wife turn Devil. Husband. My dear Belinda, I am past my Hour; I should have been at Charing-Cross by Four: Your pleasant Talk has spurr'd on Time too fast; Farewel, my Dear; excuse me, I'm in Haste. Wife. But stay, my Dear, I have a small Request; I'm sure you need not be in so much Haste. I promis'd, Child, at six a-Clock, to go To Madam Sharp's, to meet my Lady Loo; My Lady Quickdeal, and Sir John's new Bride; My Lady Patch, and sev'ral more beside. We've set this very Night apart for Play; I shall have mighty Luck, I dare to say, Because we've been so loving all this Day. But, by this Kiss, my Dear, you must supply me With twenty Guineas; prithee don't deny me. A Purse of Gold, at such a Time, you know Looks well, and makes a creditable Show. Husband. I must confess, I was amus'd to find Belinda so extreamly fond and kind; But now the Cause is clear: Yet there's my Keys; Prove always so and take what Gold you please. I know, my Dear, a Wife would think it hard, Dissembl'd Goodness should have no Reward. Therefore the Man that would preserve his Life, Free from the teazing Humours of his Wife, Must ne'er be backward, in a marry'd State, To purchase Ease at an expensive Rate: For a proud Wife kept poorly, or controul'd, Will surely prove a Harlot, or a Scold. Moral Reflexions on the foregoing Dialogue. [As Wives have sundry Ways to teaze] As Wives have sundry Ways to teaze, And put us at Defiance, So they have many Arts to please, And win us to Compliance. The cunning Shrew, her Point to gain, Will wave her native Temper, And coax her Spouse, tho' in the Main, She's still Eadem Semper. Some Ladies doat on Cards and Dice; Some Wives the Bottle drive at: In short, each Woman has her Vice, In publick or in private. In spite of all that Man can do, They'll gratify their Natures; And if you thwart what they pursue, They'll prove vexatious Creatures. You therefore, who have vicious Wives, Whose Tempers are to lord it, Please 'em, to ease your wretched Lives, If able to afford it. For all that can, alas! be said, You have but these two Measures; That's, turn 'em off, if very bad, Or hum'r 'em in their Pleasures. Dialogue XVII. Between a prudent Gentleman, and his obliging Lady, about her keeping Company with a certain Gentlewoman of a slender Reputation. Husband. You're welcome Home my Dear; you're come at last. I thought you long; 'tis ten a Clock, or past. What made you, Child, continue out so late? You said, at farthest, you'd return by eight. A modest Wife should have Respect to Time; To break your Word, is a provoking Crime. Where have you been, my Dear, that you could be So thoughtless of your self, as well as me? Wife. Pray, Dear, excuse me: 'Tis a Fault, I own I did not think you'd be at Home so soon. You know my Bus'ness chiefly was to pay A formal Visit to my Lady Gay; But coming early thence, before 'twas dark, I stept to Madam Daphne's near the Park, Where she and I sat chatting, till I vow The Ev'ning slipt away I know not how; Tho' when it prov'd so very late, I'll swear It vex'd me, that so long I'd tarry'd there, 'Less you should think I'd been the Lord knows where. Husband. Why will you keep her Company? You know I've begg'd that you no more would thither go. Her Air's too wanton, and her Tongue to free; I fear she breaks the Rules of Modesty. Her Looks betray the Looseness of her Mind, And her Mein shews she is to Ill inclin'd. Besides, her Reputation is not clear; I care not to repeat the Things I hear. She's censur'd as a Woman of Intrigue, And that she's with a Captain now in League: Nay, worse; for some don't scruple to report She once was pregnant by a Lord at Court; And that his Father, to reward her Shame, Allows her now a Stipend for the same, I've hinted this before, and must you still Make her your Crony, 'gainst your Husband's Will? Indeed, my Dear, I'm much concern'd to find You should be so imprudent and unkind. Wife. Fame oft reports what none can make appear, And Envy talks what Justice hates to hear. The World's ill-natur'd, and delights to spread What should not be too eas'ly credited. Censure's an Evil very few avoid, And Innocence thereby is much annoy'd. The Good must suffer, whilst the Bad go free; The last are safe in their Majority; Whilst Vertue oft is scandaliz'd aloud, To make her level with the guilty Crowd. The modest Dame, who little says, is thought The silent Sow, that drinks up all the Draught. The merry Gossiip is too bold and free, Her wanton Carriage shews her Levity. The pious Maid, tho' righteous as a Saint, Does only for a Spark the Church frequent. The devout Wife must horn her Husband's Brows, And only goes to Pray'rs to cheat her Spouse. In short, no Woman, be she ne'er so just, Can live exempt from wicked Man's Distrust; For she that scorns to yield to his Delight, The envious Letcher injures out of spite; Lessens and damns those Charms beyond his reach, As Sportsmen curse the Hare they cannot catch. I hope, my Dear, you have not been deny'd, And therefore wrong what you in vain have try'd; For I could ne'er in Daphne's Looks or Mein Discover what you've heard, or what you've seen. Therefore, my Dearest, tho', for ought I know, She may be bad, I scarce can think her so. Why therefore should you judge so hardly by her, Since common Fame is but a common Lyar. Husband. But if she's thought to be a wanton Dame, And spiteful Tongues have fix'd the evil Shame, What tho' the Fact is not believ'd by you, If once the World affirms it, then it's true; Or tho' its false, the Calumny sticks fast, And will the nicest Reputation blast? The heav'nly Truths we must allow divine, Those above Falshood will for ever shine; But worldly Truths are what the World receive, And Falshood only what we misbelieve; Therefore if common Fame reports her lewd, It is in vain for you to say she's good. If you pretend t'extenuate her Disgrace, Your self will only be believ'd as base: She, for your Friendship, will no better fare, But you, in her defence, will surely share The worst Reproaches that her Name does bear. Why then, my Dear, will you so foolish prove, T'incur those Scandals which you can't remove. Consider, female Reputation's nice, The only Gem a Woman ought to prize. It's hard to raise, but easy to exhaust, And ne'er can be regain'd, when once it's lost. No matter, whether blemish'd, right or wrong, By her own Actions, or a spiteful Tongue, If busy Fame has spread the ill Report, She'll still be number'd with the looser Sort. Therefore, my Dear, I beg you to forbear Her Conversation, 'less in Time you share Her publick Fame, and odious Character. Wife. I own I am not willing to be thought A wanton Wretch, when guiltless of a Fau't; Tho' I believe she's injur'd and abus'd, And knows no Ills of which she stands accus'd; Yet, since you tell me such Reports are spread, And by so many talk'd and credited, Without my Knowledge, there may be some Fire, From whence such Smother may at first aspire. Therefore, my Dear, your kind Advice I'll take, And from this Hour her Company forsake. I meant no Harm, nor shall you find I'll do The least Offence that shall displeasure you; For I have Sense to know my sacred Trust, And shall obey in all Things that are just; For stubborn Wives, who foolishly pursue Those headstrong Humours which too oft they shew, Make themselves wretched, and their Husband's too. Husband. Your kind Compliance with my small Request, Assures me in a Wife I'm highly blest; And, to my Satisfaction, serves to prove At once your Duty, Innocence, and Love. I must confess I was disturb'd to see My Dear so fond of such loose Company; But this Obedience has oblig'd me more Than your Misconduct disoblig'd before; And since I've so prevail'd, that you intend No future Visits to so ill a Friend, With your Desires I'll evermore comply, And nothing that a Wife can ask, deny; For she that will obey, deserves to find The Man she loves, just, generous, and kind. Moral Reflexions on the foregoing Dialogue. The vertuous prudent Woman, ought To shun the Conversation Of those who wantonly have got An evil Reputation. What if they have a Scandal gain'd, Tho' no Man has enjoy'd 'em, Yet, if their Vertue once be stain'd, 'Tis Prudence to avoid 'em? Should but the Fox keep Company With Creatures that are sweeter, They soon would stink as bad as he, Altho' of different Nature. So wanton Women will infect The Chaste, by idle Carriage, And, if wed, teach 'em to neglect The Duties of their Marriage. Till they at last have drawn 'em in, By luscious Prittle-Prattle, To venture at that odious Sin, Which always proves so fatal. Therefore a Wife should ne'er oppose Her Spouse with Why or Wherefore, But quit the Company of those Her Husband does not care for. Dialogue XVIII. Between a teazing Husband, and his vexatious tipling Wife. Husband. How do'st thou do, my Dear? You look as pale, As if you fancy'd that you was not well. I fear the Dram-Cup has neglected stood, And want of Anniseed has chill'd your Blood. Prithee, my Dear, revive your female Heart: If your Stock's out, here's Money, fetch a Quart. I know thy Veins, according to thy Use, Must be well warm'd with some infernal Juice, Or else some Belly-Pain, or Windy Stitch, Will make thee look as hagged as a Witch. Wife. You'd need to flout me, now you see me ill; I wish you did but half my Mis'ry feel, What swearing we should have for Mutton Broth, Or some fine Nick-nack, choak you, for your Mouth? But if I'm troubl'd with an aching Head, Or my Side pains me till I'm almost dead, I may pine on, Pox take you, till I faint, Ere you, you Wretch, will pity my Complaint, Or say so much as, How do'st do, my Dear? Can'st drink a Glass of Wine, or Pot of Beer? Shall I go fetch the Doctor to thee, Love? What shall I get, that may thy Grief remove? How do you find your Stomach? Can you eat? Shall I go buy thee some nice hollow Bit? Thus a good Husband to a Wife would speak, When indispos'd, ill-humour'd, sick, or weak; And not, like you, torment her throbbing Brain With Scoffs and Jeers, to aggravate her Pain; And all, forsooth, because, when I am ill, I'm apt to take a Dram, perhaps a Gill. Had not that Cordial sav'd my Life, you know I had, alas! been dead long long ago: Who therefore would not, to her very End, Esteem the Comfort of so kind a Friend? Husband. I must confess, I never knew it fail; If ne'er so ill, two Pen'worth makes thee well; Yet, without Banter, I may justly say Thou'rt sick, my Dear, at least nine times a day; Therefore thy Cordial gives but short Relief, And want of it, I fear, 's thy only Grief. Here, Maid, go fetch the Bottle to your Dame; Prithee, my Dear, administer a Dram. I dare engage one Dose will have the Pow'r To cure your Malady for half an Hour; And still, my Love, as often as you think Your Pain's returning, you as oft should drink. Adsheart! the Bottle's out.—I guess'd the Cause That does your Mind so greatly indispose. I think 'twas fetch'd but Yesterday at Noon; Nouns! who'd have thought it should be gone so soon? Wife. Pray don't you think I drink a Quart a Day; I spilt a little, some I gave away: I had a Visiter or two, that came Last Night, and them I welcom'd with a Dram; Or else, I'd have you know, it had not half Been gone in such a Time, for all you laugh; Tho' I can take a Spoonful now and then; I would not have you think we drink like Men. I don't frequent the Ale-house like a Sot, And there sit guzzling down Pot after Pot, Till fuller than you're able to contain, Then in some Corner out 'tis sp?d again, You'd need upbraid your Wife, because you know She takes a Dram of Anniseed, or so; When 'tis, God help me, only to revive My Spirits, and to keep my self alive! Were I a drunken Beast, like Gammar Bluff, Who never knows when she has drank enough; Or did I up and down with Gossips go To ev'ry neighbouring Ale-house in the Row, There score up Dribblets in my Husband's Name, And leave 'em long unpaid, to both our Shame; Then I should own you would have Cause to make Your self uneasy at the Course I take. But I, alas! who take a Dram by stealth, Not for the Sake o'th' Liquor, but my Health, Must be worse us'd, more ridicul'd than those Who never have the Bottle from their Nose! But 'tis, alas! the Fortune of our Sex, Those are most fondl'd, who the most can vex. Husband. You are a sober Piece, I needs must say, To drink a Quart of Spirits in a Day, And then pretend you gave 'em half away. Stop your own Mouth, and pray forget to rail At those good Wives that are content with Ale: You, like a female Sot, in private tipple Your Drams behind the Backs of other People, And in your Closet prove a greater Beast, Than the worst Gossip at a publick Feast. Your Mouth, by drinking at this odious Rate, Out stinks a Brandy-Shop at Billinsgate. Your nauseous Breath, which does my Nose surprize, Smells like a Fog that does from Dung-hill rise. The very Gown and Petticoats you wear, The odious Fumes of Aqua Vitæ bear, As if, when drunk, they'd been perfum'd and stain'd With your damn'd Spirits at the second Hand. For Shame, you Poll-Cat, quit your Stygian Juice, And be no more so shamefully profuse With your confounded Anniseeds, that stink Much worse than Bog-house, Common-shore, or Sink, Before you take the Freedom to upbraid Others, whose Vices are not half so bad; But 'tis, alas! each wretched Woman's Curse, To rail at common Faults, yet practise worse. Wife. Use me not thus, you contradicting Fool; I'll drink the more, the more you ridicule. 'Twas your Unkindness that at first disturb'd My Mind, for I've been always snubb'd and curb'd. Your ill Conditions made me seek Relief, To raise my Spirits, when depress'd with Grief: And can you now, that caus'd me first to drink, Upbraid me? Is it gen'rous, do you think? For Shame, you sordid Wretch, forbear your Teaze, Reflect not thus, to interrupt my Ease. Women, when indispos'd, may, now and then, Require a Dram, I hope, as well as Men: Why therefore should it be a Crime in Wives To drown their Cares, and comfort up their Lives As well as you, who ev'ry Day can spend Whate'er you please with this and t'other Friend; Feast your ill-favour'd Guts with Wine abroad, And sotting sit till you have got your Load; Then, like a Beast, come stagg'ring to your Wife, And with your drunken Whims perplex her Life? Should I do so, you'd then have Cause enough To plague my Ears with such severe Reproof: But I, forsooth, must be afraid to take A Dram, altho' so faint I scarce can speak; For if I do, I must be deem'd a Sot, Flouted, abus'd, and call'd I know not what; When all Men may remember, if they please, Women are subject to Infirmities. Physicians tell ye we are cold by Nature, Yet, I believe, you'd have me drink cold Water. But, faith, I'll see you hang'd, ere I'll comply To chill my Guts, I know no Reason why; Since you think much of now and then a Dram, I'll not be such a Fool as now I am: No more by either Jeers or Threats be aw'd, But feast at Home, as well as you Abroad. Husband. Well said, old Girl, right Woman ev'ry Inch, Too stiff to bend, will rather spend than pinch; And rather justify a Fault or Crime, Than own you're in the Wrong at any Time; Tho' in damn'd Anniseeds you drown your Life, You'd fain be thought a never-failing Wife. Were I to catch you ev'ry Day as drunk As a hoarse Billingsgate, or Brandy Punk, Your Looks with vile Hypocrisy you'd paint, And swear you was as sober as a Saint. Well, since it must be so, thou shal't not find, That for the future I'll oppose thy Mind. If thou'rt resolv'd to have thy stubborn Will, And die a female Martyr to the Gill, Here, Nan, go fetch a Quart, e'en take thy Fill; For self-will'd Woman, like a sluggish Ass, Will have her Way, and hates to change her Pace. So fare thee well, I must be gone, my Dear; Drink freely, Child, I would not have thee spare; For still the more you sip, the more you'll save, By posting on more early to the Grave. Wife. I know you want to see that joyful Day, But I may send you first to clear the Way. Come, Nancy, now your Master's gone, be free, Ne'er mind that he and I thus disagree. Come, come, here take a Dram, you silly Jade; L?d, how you drink, as if a bashful Maid. Husbands will do whate'er they please, we see; In spite of all their prating, so will we. Why should our Spouses rule the World in State, And awe their fearful Wives to this or that, Since Man, at best, is but a Woman's Brat, Moral Reflexions on the foregoing Dialogue. If Woman once has fix'd her Mind On any Vice or Failing, If you'd reclaim her, who can find What Way is most prevailing? Hard Words provoke, and make her worse, Blows raise her Indignation; He's wise, that can prescribe what Course Will work her Reformation. If drinking Brandy be her Crime, E'en let her have enough on't; For neither Words, or Length of Time, Will ever bring her off on't. Her Quarterns into Quarts improve; Encourage, and not blame her; Kill her with what she most does love; Death only can reclaim her. Ne'er mind the Fault'ring of her Lips, When she by Chance is fuddl'd; Nor heed her Stumbles, or her Trips, Whene'er her Brains are addl'd. At her destructive Habit wink, And shew no Signs of Anger; Should you, perhaps, the less she'll drink, And plague you but the longer. Dialogue XIX. Between an honest-blunt Gentleman, and his fantastical Lady, who, between forty and fifty, had made her a colour'd Furbelo'd-Scarf. Husband. Wounds, Wife, what a strange Figure do you make? Sure thou hast got a Rainbow on thy Back! What Herald's Mantle do my Eyes behold? You quite forget, my Dear, you're growing old. Sure mortal Man, till this Time, never fix'd His Eyes on Youth and Age so odly mix'd. I'll swear thy Dress would human Sight confound; Thou shin'st like any Dyer's Tenter-Ground, Where scarlet, purple, red, blue, yellow, green, Are at one transient view confus'dly seen. You're very fine, I vow, and much more gay Than fifty speckl'd Butterflies in May. Had it not been for thy old Face and Mein, I'd thought thee some young taudry Fairy Queen; Or else a pert, unthinking, little Fool In her Ball-Dress, broke loose from Dancing-School. Prithee, my Dear, what airy, wanton Thought Has made thee guilty of this foolish Fault? Wife. What makes thee wonder at me so, my Dear, 'Tis the same Mode that other Women wear? Look round you when at Church, and you may see A thousand Wives more taudry dress'd than me; But my Apparel ne'er can please your Eye; You're always finding Fault with what I buy. Therefore I am but foolish, I confess, To vex at your disliking of my Dress: I verily believe you'd have me go In high-crown'd Hat and Coif, like Gammar Crow. I'm sure Miss Titup, when she hither came, Had a new Scarf just furbelo'd the same; Therefore you might have seen, as she was drest, What Fashion 'tis that most is in request. Husband. Why, you old Fool, would you Example take By a young, childish, giddy, wanton Crack, Scarce in her Teens, whose Waste is but a Span, That ne'er knew how to quench the Rage of Man? Such callow Girls may be allow'd to wear Fangles, in hopes to tempt some foolish Heir; In Peacock's Feathers they may cloath their Tails, For Dress, as much as Beauty oft prevails: But for a Wife in Party-colour'd Hairs, Older than Paul's by almost thirty Years; A wither'd Matron past the Joys of Love, Who may, within a Year, a Grannum prove; To wrap old Stubble in so lewd a Dress, Makes thee look wanton, tho' thou'rt past Embrace; And lets the World, by thy Apparel, see, That thy Desire survives Capacity; For a stale Wife that has out liv'd her Charms, Is but mere Lumber in a Husband's Arms. What then, by such vain Dresses, can you mean, Except to shew you'd fain be young again? Or that you hop'd to tempt some Fool to own You still have Charms, when all Men see you've none? Wife. All this, my Dear, is but your usual Way To me, I know you care not what you say: But why reflect upon my Age? 'Tis true, I'm past my Prime, but not so old as you; And still have Youth enough, whene'er you try, To hold you tack, tho' not to please your Eye; Therefore, my Dear, I study to improve My Charms, by Dresses, to revive your Love; For as in Beauty I decline, I find Your Words less am'rous, and your Deeds less kind. Why then do you condemn me for my Pride, And angry seem that I my Wrinkles hide, Since these Temptations, round my Neck, you see, Are worn to make you young, as well as me? Husband. Well said, my Dear, your Wheedle makes me laugh, But I'm too old a Bird to stoop to Chaff. Few Wives dress airy to delight their Spouse, Rather to tempt some Fool to horn his Brows. No Taylor's Charms a Husband can excite, Stript of your Plumes he views you ev'ry Night. He hugs you as Dame Nature let you pass, Without the Arts you study by your Glass; Therefore no Silks can cheat his skilful Eyes; He knows fine Feathers are but mere Disguise; And tho' his Owl a Peacock's Tail should wear, He would not think his Bird a Jot more fair. No, no, rich Laces out of Flanders brought, Admir'd so highly, and so dearly bought; Your Silks and Sattins to oblige your Pride, So finely wrought, of Rainbow-Colours dy'd; Your Jewels, Rings, your Patches, and your Paints; And Juts and Congees a-la-mode of France; Your soothing Carriage, your engaging Airs; Your killing Glances, and your am'rous Snares, Are seldom us'd in order to renew Old fading Love betwixt your Spouse and you; But that Abroad you may the better pass For a gay Dame with some admiring Ass; Who, thus deceiv'd, may wish you in his Arms, And doat, Fool like, upon your borrow'd Charms. Wife. You're of a strange odd Humour, I protest; I hope, my Dear, you only talk in Jest. Why should you treat me with such light Regard? I blush to hear you Censure me so hard. You say I'm old, how then can you believe I'm fond to tempt, or willing to deceive? Or if I was, who'd think it worth their Time To vow Respect to Woman past her Prime. I only, for your Credit, love to shew My outward Pride, as other Ladies do: I value no kind flattering Address, Seek no Man's Praise, his Admiration less. I thank my Stars, since I have steer'd my Youth Within the Bounds of Vertue, and of Truth, I shall not at these riper Years be free To stain my Honour with the greatest He: Therefore I hope you harbour no such Thought, I dress but as your Wife or Lady ought; But if you think that I too gay appear, Or that you grutch the costly Robes I wear, I'll lay them by, since they your Sight offend, And be content with such you'll recommend. Husband. Wives, who for twenty Years have Mothers been, Should scorn in such gay Frip'ries to be seen. The Woman shews most Prudence, that appears In grave Apparel, suited to her Years; For she that hides her Age with artful Pains, But forfeits that Respect she thinks she gains. So an old Abby's venerable Walls, Adorn'd with new Imbellishments, like Paul's, Would lose its ancient Reverence and State, When patch'd with Ornaments of modern Date. Yet, since your Pride has tempted you to buy Such painted Wings, more fit for Butterfly, Pray wear them till their gaudy Lustre fades, Admir'd by foolish Beaus, and taudry Jades; But pray, when these by Age are rent and torn, And to a scandalous Condition worn, Let me no more such wanton Garments see, But recollect your Age, and dress like me; Wear good, but grave Apparel, pray herea'ter, And dress not to provoke my Neighbours Laughter, But let them know the Mother from the Daughter. Wife. 'Tis a hard Fate on Woman to be old, But worse to be upbraided and controul'd. Age steals too soon into a female Face; But why must she proclaim it in her Dress? However, since I find it is your Will, I'll change my Garb, and your Desires fulfil; For tho' such Dictates, that abridge a Wife Of Dress, are Hardships to a Woman's Life, Yet nothing is so bad as nuptial Strife. Moral Reflexions on the foregoing Dialogue. [Tho' Wives by Men ought not to be] Tho' Wives by Men ought not to be In their Attire directed, Yet Fortune, Age, and Quality, Should always be respected. Therefore if Women, in their Cloaths, Will soar above their Station, The Husband then may interpose With his Disapprobation: Or if a Wife, at fifty Years, Will be so proud and silly To dress herself in wanton Geers, Like Punk of Piccadilly. The Spouse that disapproves it, ought To speak his Mind, no Doubt on't, And if she does not mend her Fault, To ridicule her out on't. The Cook puts on her Furbelo, When eas'd from Pot and Ladle; An Ass as well, or grunting Sow Might wear a Hunting-Saddle. Loose Wives, young Maids, and wanton Cracks, Will have their Silks and Lockets, T'adorn their tempting Necks and Backs, Tho' nothing in their Pockets. Dialogue XX. Between a City-Termagant, and her Mechanick Spouse. Wife. What ails the angry Sot? Poor jealous Fool; Yes, I'll obey, when you have Pow'r to rule. Marry come up, indeed; what's that to you, Where I have been intriguing, or with who? What, can't a Wife her Recreation take, But you must all this noisy Bustle make? Must I be fearful on a Summer's Day, To take a Walk, or see a harmless Play, Because, forsooth, I've such a jealous Spouse, That thinks each Man I speak to, horns his Brows? Husband. Hussy, I say, you are a wanton Slut, To steal from Home, when I my self am out. 'Tis to my Shame, you Minx, that you're so free To gad Abroad with any Man but me. What, tho' he be your Cousin, 'tis a Crime. I've heard strange Things of Cousins in my Time: Not but I scorn to have a jealous Pate; Yet I say Cousins should not be so great: Therefore pray keep within your own House-door, And Cousin me no Cousins any more. Wife. I know, you Goat, you're a mistrustful Creature. The Æthiopian cannot help his Nature. But tho' your Head be plagu'd with this Disease, I still shall take what Liberties I please. Since you your Company Abroad refuse; Who better than a Kinsman can I chuse, To guard me from the Rudeness of a Crew Of nasty lustful Fellows, such as you? Husband. Why, how now, Hussy, you notorious Punk! Who is't you talk to? I believe you're drunk. What do you make of me, you prating Blowze? A'n't I your Lord and Master, and your Spouse? And ought not I, you saucy Minx, to know Your Bus'ness out, and whither 'tis you go? Wife. High Time indeed, you should be so obey'd; D'ye take me for your Slave, or Servant Maid? Had you two thousand Pounds upon the Nail, To be my Turnkey, and your House my Jayl? Had I such Breeding on my Youth bestow'd, To be mew'd up, and fetter'd from Abroad? Must I, behind your Compter, spend my Life, That Passengers may view your handsome Wife? There, like a Fool, sit playing with my Thumbs, To learn the Price of Sugars, and of Plumbs. Not I indeed; I'll not be so subdu'd, But take my Pleasure, as a Woman shou'd: Dress, visit, gossip, gad where e'er I please; And if you thwart me, study how to teaze. I never, wrong'd you, I can justly say, But if you plague me thus, perhaps I may. Husband. 'Tis well you han't already stept aside; If not, I'm sure you're damnably bely'd: Not that I think so; but my Neighbours do, Because you are so great with you know who. But, for the future, you shall find, adsnigs, I'll break the Neck of all your Jade's Intrigues. Wife. Do if you can; but if I've e'er done ill, In spite of all your Craft, I'll do do so still. Were I a faithless, or a wicked Creature, Threats, Words, or Blows, should never make me better, Husband. Not that I think you mean me any Hurt: But should I chance to catch you at the Sport, You then should find, I'd make the Dev'l to do; I'd not be doubly pointed at for you. Wife. When Woman's such a Fool to let her Spouse Catch her in grafting Antlers on his Brows, She then deserves to have the foul Disgrace Publish'd in ev'ry common Market-place; And by her horn mad Husband, to be made A sad Example for a silly Jade. But pray, suppose she's such a cunning Quane, To do the Trick, and not be caught, what then? Husband. F'r ought I know, Hussy, you may be the Dame, That has the Craft to sin without the Shame. I'll have no Cousin Courtly, as you call him, Come hither, Baggage; if he does, I'll maul him: Not that I'm jealous, Hussy, but I scorn My Neighbours here, where I was bred and born, Should but so much as think I wear the Horn. Wife. Hussy not me; I'll no such Language bear, My Fortune, Sirrah, made you what you are: And must I now love, honour, and obey A Fool that started up but t'other Day? Not I, except it be the backward Way. Husband. Hussy, you are the most provoking Jade, That surely ever curs'd a Marriage-Bed. With ev'ry Pound, you've brought a thousand Plagues, Would I had wedded some poor Wench in Rags Rather than one so confidently bold; A Jilt, a Slut, damn'd lazy, and a Scold. Wife. Too good for such a cross-grain'd, jealous Owl, Pray who are you, you Sugar-candy Fool, Bound 'Prentice by the Parish, f'r ought I know, Tho' with my Fortune, now you make a Show, And bluster with your Hogsheads round your Shop? But, Sirrah, 'twas my Fortune set you up. Husband. 'Tis false, you Slut; 'tis to my Neighbours known, Ere plagu'd with you, I'd Money of my own, Got by my Parents justly, God be prais'd, And not by Quarts unseal'd, as yours was rais'd. Short Measure, Hussy, fill'd your Father's Purse; That makes your Fortune come with such a Curse. I ne'er expect to thrive with what you brought, Your canker'd Thousands were so basely got. Your Breeding too, of which you boast and talk, Arose from Vintner's Bar, and double Chalk. Wife. You L?e, you sorry Knave; that's English plain; 'Tis known my Father was an honest Man. He fed the Poor, paid ev'ry one his Due; That's more than any Man will say of you. He ne'er with jealous Heats my Mother teaz'd, But let her go and come when e'er she pleas'd; Would trust her up all Night, and let her be Jocund with Customers, with Drawers free; And scorn'd to use a Wife, as you do me. Husband. You know, you Shrew, you never in your Life Far'd half so well, as since you've been my Wife. Do I not ev'ry Day with Dainties feed ye? And buy you Sattins, fitter for a Lady? Don't I at Church above your Betters place ye? And keep an idle Jade to comb and lace ye? Do you not Weekly Coach it up and down; And ramble with your Cousin thro' the Town? Ride oft to Dullidge; Stay a Week together; And wander round the Country, God knows whither? Yet tho' your Kinsman be a jolly Fellow, Am I i'th' least (as Women call it) Yellow? Do I not bear with all your Frowns and Pouts; And slave, to treat your Gossips and your Sluts? Harlots, f'r ought I know, who are always talking Of Park and Play-house, Junketting and Walking? As if a Wife had nothing else to do, But gad Abroad to see I know not who! Yet, tho' I suffer this, to make you easy, Nothing that I can do, forsooth, will please ye. Will the best Meat in Leaden-Hall content ye? Do I in Quiet eat one Meal in twenty? Do you not rail before my Neighbours Faces? And scold and wrangle in our Night Embraces? As if you lov'd to shew your fiery Passion, As noisy Cats do theirs in Copulation. Wife. For Shame, you foul-mouth'd, bawdy Beast, forbear? Is't fit your Wife such smutty Stuff should hear? D'ye think the Secrets of our Nuptial Bed, Should, when we're up, our common Chat be made? Such Talk as yours, were not a Woman bent To Modesty, would make her impudent. Husband. It was a fault, indeed; I blush for Shame; Excuse me, Honey, I was much to blame. 'Twas Passion made me foolish, by my Life; I know I should not talk so to a Wife. Prithee forgive me; Bawdy I abhor; What I have said, I vow I'm sorry for. Come, let's be Friends; what signifies our wrangling? Prithee, my Dear, let's lay aside our jangling. Wife. Be quiet, Foolish: How indecent this is? Flatter not me with your dissembling Kisses. Prithee, be modest: Is the Devil in ye? I hate to humour such a jealous Ninny. You're always scolding, like an ill-bred Clown; Or else as fond as if 'twas Honey-Moon. Husband. We Men, my Dear, who love to whet our Spleen, Only fall out, in order to fall in. As Judges oft dissemble stern Behaviour, And threaten hardest, when they mean most Favour. Moral Reflexions on the foregoing Dialogue. [The Fool that weds a Shrew, because] The Fool that weds a Shrew, because Her Tongue is tipt with Silver, Deserves the Punishment he has, What ever be his Ill-fare. He's brib'd by a tormenting Wife, To truckle to her Failings; And to inure his wretched Life, To all her noisy Railings. Superior Fortunes always claim A Right of Domination; And he that weds the wealthy Dame, Should wink at each Transgression. How oft do Golden Ladies buy, Poor worthless Fools for Covers, That they the better may enjoy Variety of Lovers? He, therefore, who does only aim At Money with a Woman, Ought, for her Gold, to hide her Shame, Altho' she's ne'er so common. For when the beauteous Dame shall yoke A Fool beneath her Fortune, He ought to think himself a Cloak, A Cypher, and a Curtain. Dialogue XXI. Between a thriving Chandler and his Wife, about the Education of their Daughter. Wife. My Dear, you'll breed this Girl a very Fool, Why don't you put her to the Dancing-School? See how she holds her Head and treads her Toes, Like a meer Bumpkin when she stands or goes, Is so shame-fac'd, tho' enter'd in her Teens, That she looks downwards, like a Sow in Beans: Prithee, my Dear, consider, and bestow Good Breeding on her for a Year or two. See how her Breasts begin to heave and swell, She'll soon be Ripe, for Reasons I can tell; Therefore, my Dear, 'tis time she should be taught, How she should sit or move as Maidens ought, That when she's fit for Wedlock, she may hear A Love-Address, without a trembling Fear, Not steal away, and when her Lover comes, Behind the Door stand biting of her Thumbs. Husband. My Dear, to tell the truth, I love to see Young Maidens full of bashful Modesty; If that's her only Fault 'efaith, my Pence Shall never fly to teach her Confidence: 'Tis hard to find a Girl but learns that faster Than it is fit she should, without a Master. Methinks, my Dear, that you might find a way T'improve her in that Talent ev'ry Day, And not tempt me to fling away my Money, To teach her that of which your self, my Honey, Have been a Mistress e'er since I have known ye. Wife. Poh! this is nothing, I've a Back to bear Your Jests, and Belly too, you know, my Dear; What's that to th'purpose? I've a longing Mind To do what I've this Twelemonth's Day design'd, Which is, that Nanny shall to Dancing go, Therefore, my Dear, you must not say me no; You see my Neighbour Grub, that sorry Fool, Can keep his Daughter at the Boarding School; Nay, Smug the Smith, gives all his Children breeding, And sends them out to writing and to Reading, I'm sure we live as well, and save as much, Why should you then so small a Matter grutch? Prithee consent, you'll ne'er the sooner break, 'Tis hard we cannot scrape for one poor Chick, An only Daughter and a hopeful Girl, Who, if she'd Breeding, might deserve an Earl. Husband. Prithee don't teaze my Ears, you silly Tony; Dance me no Dances, I've no dancing Money: What tho' I have a Bag or two in store? You'd have it less, I want to make it more, And not, forsooth, to have my Neighbour's laughter, By making a fine Madam of my Daughter: I got my Money by my Work, not Play, And therefore shall not fiddle it away; I shall not prove that gen'rous Fool that spends, On others Heels, the Labour of his Hands: 'Tis true, when in the Country once I liv'd, Before I knew the plague of being Wiv'd, Then round a May-pole I my self could Jirk it, But never paid for Caper or for Firk it; Therefore if you've a mind your pretty Daughter Should learn such Dancing as becomes the Creature, E'en send her thither, to her 'Haviours learn Of some blind Fidler, where the School's a Barn, There ev'ry Holiday the Girl may see Such Dancing as will sute her Quality. Wife. Marry-come-up, I vow and swear I hate To hear you talk; how like a Fool you prate: If you provoke much longer, I protest, I shall in Earnest be, when you're in Jest. What do you make of the poor Girl? I hope You think the Child your own, no Beggar's Drop. You'd make her, I suppose, a Country Drudge, With Farmer's Milk-Pale, Ankle-deep to trudge; Or wade o'er Hills of Muck and shitten Bogs, To milk his Carrion Cows and serve his Hogs: But, Faith, if that's your ugly drift, look to't, She's mine as well as yours, you stingy Brute; Therefore I'd have you know, you fleering Knave, You shall not make my only Child a Slave. Husband. Nor will I give it in your foolish Pow'r, To breed her up to be a Jilt, a Whore, A dancing Harlot, a deluding Strum, To tempt young Rakehells with her jutting Bum, A Tol dol Hussy, a harmonious Devil, A skipping, tripping Minx, train'd up in Evil. Prithee, good Madam, let her first be able To read a Chapter truly in the Bible, That she mayn't mispronounce God's People, Pople, Nor read Cunst—able for Constantinople. Make her expert and ready at her Pray'rs, That God may keep her from the Devil's Snares; Teach her what's useful, how to shun deluding, To Roast, to Toast, to Boil, and mix a Pudding, To Knit, to Spin, to Sew, to Make or Mend, To Scrub, to Rub, to Earn, and not to Spend; First teach her these, and then the pretty Fool Shall jig her Crupper at the Dancing School. Wife. And what will all these Qualities avail her, If she's ill bred, fit only for a Sailor; Dancing's a Grace to ev'ry Limb and Feature, And makes a Home-spun Lass a pretty Creature; Causes young Men to love 'em and admire 'em, And does with passionate Affection fire 'em. Lists them above the greater Peoples Scorn, And makes them look like Gentlewomen born. But, cross-grain'd Fool, Did ever Mortal hear A Lover, in his Courtship, ask his Dear To read a Chapter, say her Pray'rs, or Creed? That would, 'efaith, be pretty Sport indeed; No, you're a Dancer, Madam, by your treading, I vow I love you dearly for your Breeding; Oblige me, Angel, with a charming Song, Pray bless me with the Musick of your Tongue: Lovers for these will beg, as for an Alms, But who, when Courting, asks for Pray'rs or Psalms? Yet my poor Girl, forsooth, must be deny'd These charming Gifts in either Maid or Bride, Because the stingy Fool, her Father, thinks They become none but a fantastick Minx. Husband. I tell thee, Wife, once more, I'll have her bred To Book'ry, Cook'ry, Thimble, Needle, Thread, And all such Hussifry as well becomes A Wife, for one that deals in Mops and Brooms; For as I've got my Money by the same, My Child shall be no Madam, but a Dame; A careful Hussif, that when we are Dead, Ma'inherit both my Money and my Trade, That when she's Wed she may not think it Scandal To serve Tom T?dman with a Farthing Candle. Tell me of Dancing, Nouns! I'd sooner send her To be train'd up by some old Witch of Endor. Wife. Go, you old Brute, you puritannick Knave, Who in a Breath can Pray, Lye, Swear, and Rave. Don't cry, my Child, thou shalt to Dancing go, For all thy stingy Father says thee no. Ne'er put thy Finger in thy pretty Eye, I'll find a way to make the Brute comply; I'll plague his Heart out, give his Ears their fill, And never leave him till I've had my Will. Moral Reflexions on the foregoing Dialogue. [Mother's thro' too much Pride or Love] Mother's thro' too much Pride or Love, Ne'er fail of Inclination, To breed their Children far above The level of their Station. The Ale-Wife to the Dancing-School Must send her Fav'rite Daughter, To spend what she should give the Fool, To match her well hereafter. So that when Miss, by am'rous Sighs, Declares she's ripe and ready, In Minuet and Boree lies The Fortune of my Lady. Thus Bred, the wanton airy Lass A Working Slave despises, And rather chusing to be base, She falls before she rises. When if the Damsel had been bred To th'Ladle and her Needle, She would not then have been misled To Ogle, Kiss, and Wheedle. Therefore those Parents Act awry, And in the main deceive 'em, Who breed their Children proudly high, Yet nothing have to leave 'em. Dialogue XXII. A Pastoral Dialogue between Coridon a Shepherd, and his Wife Phillis, concerning the innocent Pleasures of a Rural Life. Husband. How fares my Love beneath this happy Shade, Where Fears nor Cares our peaceful Hours invade, But where the chirping Birds and spreading Trees Yields us at once both Harmony and Ease. Wife. Who can be otherwise than Blest, to find Nature so generous, and you so kind? The beauteous Meadows please my wand'ring Eyes, And wean my Breast from worldly Vanities; The Musick of the Birds delight my Ears, And teach me to despise all worldly Cares; The Glories of the Heavens, which unite With teeming Earth, are Wonders to my sight; And ev'ry Hour instruct my peaceful Soul, To praise the Almighty Hand that fram'd the whole. Husband. I'm pleas'd to hear those Wonders you espy Enrich your Mind, as well as please your Eye; And that you view those distant Blessings given To mortal Man, with such Regard to Heaven: For how ingrateful is the thankless Guest, Who can such vast celestial Dainties taste, And not adore the hand that gave the happy Feast? Wife. What human Creature that does Reason boast, Can prove so stupid till his Reason's lost? What Mortal can behold yon flow'ry Meads, Where purple Violets hang their fragrant Heads, And golden Cowslips tow'r amidst the Grass, Above the Primrose, in an humbler Class? Or who look up tow'rds yonder glorious Light, Whose blazing Lustre dazles human sight? Or view the azure Canopy above, Beneath whose Roof so many Wonders move, And not be mindful of the Pow'r beyond, Who in eternal Glory sits enthron'd? None sure can view these Blessings and forget Th'Almighty Pow'r that did the same create: No humble Beggar does an Alms receive, But thanks the Hand that does his Wants relieve. Husband. The greatest Comforts we on Earth can find, Dwell in the Contemplations of the Mind; Thought is alone the happy Soul's delight, They're only blest that meditate aright: Your inward Riches in your Words are seen, For all without us you enjoy within, And with a grateful and contented Breast, Praise bounteous Heav'n, by whom we both are blest. Whilst others, who more worldly Wealth enjoy, For want of pious Thoughts their Peace destroy. The thankless Wretch, amidst his useless Store, Without the Riches of Content, is poor; That heav'nly Blessing which is ne'er allow'd To those who mix with the ingrateful Crowd, Who wanting Grace to cultivate the Mind, Still run in search of what they ne'er can find. The Proud and Great in quest of Honour soar, And barter downy Peace for noisy Pow'r; The Rich unthankful for the Gifts they hold, Disturb their Quiet to encrease their Gold; The Trader thoughtless of the God that gives, Breaks thro' all Morals, and by cheating thrives; The Drunkard drowns his Happiness in Wine, And to distract his Brains mispends his Coin; The wanton sooth their amorous Desires, And interrupt their Ease with lustful Fires; The Gamester blusters o'er his Cards and Dice, And, to once praising, curses Fortune twice; The Soldier leaves his Children and his Wife, For the loose Pleasures of a wretched Life. In short, the giddy World are grown so weak, They fly that very Happiness they seek; And in the vain pursuit each robs his Mind Of that Content which all desire to find. Wife. How happy then, dear Coridon, are we, Securely plac'd in such a blest Degree? Beneath that Sphere where the Infection spreads, And frantickly confounds their giddy Heads. What tho' we no delicious Dainties eat, Our Stomachs are proportion'd to our Meat; That on course Beef we make a hearty Meal, And for no Ven'son pine, or Ortland Teal; For where the Appetite is sound and good, It needs no other Fare than wholsome Food. What tho' we've no rich Garments to adorn Our healthful Bodies, by the Wealthy worn. Our Flocks have cloath'd us thus in Rural Grey, As warm and clean, tho' not so fine, as they; Whose costly Robes are but a publick Blind, That hides maim'd Limbs, and a distemper'd Mind; An Artifice that cheats the common Eye, Behind whose Front a thousand Vices lye; Whilst we, within our home-spun Dress, enjoy Delights that ever please and never cloy; And tho' secur'd from Cold at little Cost, More Vertue, Peace, and Honesty can boast, Than in rich Pairs who in their Coaches ride, And centre all their Happiness in Pride; For sweet Content with Grandeur disagrees, And dwells in Rural Huts and Cottages, Expands her downy Wings o'er Woods and Fields, And only to the Just her Friendship yields. Husband. No Blessings add more Comfort to my Life, Than Gifts so heav'nly in so Fair a Wife, Whose Knowledge makes your Beauty shine so bright, That one informs, whilst t'other gives delight. I'm blest to think that you, who have been bred To a full Table and a downy Bed, To Freedom, Ease, and Pleasure, far above This mean and humble Sphere wherein you move, Can be so well content beneath that Fate, Which dooms you to this low dejected State, Where no voluptuous Banquets crown the Day, But our calm Hours in silence pass away; No gaudy Pomp or Grandeur to surprize Your Female Breast, or to delight your Eyes; No Riches to be hop'd for, that can raise Your Vertues on the Wings of humane Praise; No fawning am'rous Fools or flatt'ring Knaves; No Homage to be paid by humble Slaves; In this low Sphere we nothing can command But homely Food, with an industrious Hand; No artful Sauces to our Fare improve, Excepting sweet Content and mutual Love: Nor can we these Felicities enjoy, If Hopes or Fears our happy Lives annoy, Or thirst of Riches does our Peace destroy. Wife. I would not soar to any loftier pitch; I covet nothing that's beyond my reach; I'm blest in this Retirement and in you: In these I've all the Pleasures I pursue: The nauseous Pomp of the ignoble Great, Those gilded Vultures I despise and hate, Who prey on those they should protect in Peace, And do a thousand Wrongs they should redress; Embroil whole Kingdoms in destructive Wars, And fill our native Land with Feuds and Jars; Dethrone their Kings to gratify their Pride; Full Churches down, so near to Heav'n ally'd; Trample the sacred Text beneath their Feet; Explode Religion for a human Cheat, And all to make themselves profusely Great. My Father once a large Estate possest, But being Just, was therefore much opprest; Beggar'd by Rebels who usurp'd the Throne, To save his Conscience was himself undone: In dying Words he bid me be content, To share with Patience the severe Event Of all those Troubles he so long had born, In hopes that Justice might in time return. You're Fair, said he, my Child, and Vertuous too, When I am gone, be careful what you do; Tho' I have worn my Foes oppressive Yoke, Till the strong Fibres of my Heart are broke, And must a Martyr to their Fury fall, Injur'd, defam'd, and now depriv'd of all, That I can only leave you to the Care Of him that made you so divinely fair; Therefore on him you must alone rely, And bounteous Heav'n will your Wants supply: Let no Great Man your Innocence delude, But tho' you're ne'er so Poor be Chaste and Good; Rather submit to be the lawful Bride Of some kind Shepherd on the Plains employ'd, To watch his bleating Flocks, that none should stray, And to the neighb'ring Wolves become a Prey: In his mean Cottage you Content may find, The only Riches of a Vertuous Mind: But if your Pride unhappily should soar, At distant Greatness that's beyond your Pow'r, In vain you'll reach too far, till from the place On which you stand, you'll tumble with Disgrace. In God, and these my Counsels, put your Trust, If ne'er so low, they're happy who are Just. This said, my aged Father clos'd his Eyes, And left me weeping in a sad surprize; His dying Words first brought me to the Plains, To dwell amongst the neighb'ring Nymphs and Swains, Where, by Experience, since embrac'd by you, I've prov'd his last and dying Sayings true; And tho' reduc'd to this derided State, I think my self more happy than the Great; For when the Thoughts are free and Mind at rest, The Body's easy and the Soul is blest: Therefore whoever wisely guards the Tow'r Of Conscience, needs no further Wealth or Pow'r. Husband. Blest be the Hour it was my Lot to meet Beauty so charming, with a Tongue so sweet! A Wife whose matchless Vertues soar above The reach of Praise, or the Rewards of Love. O! that my kind Endeavours would compleat Thy Joys, and make thy Happiness more great, Each Hour should be a Scene of new delights, More sweet than those we taste in Winter-Nights. But since the Blessings of so rich a Prize, So far above your Husband's Merits rise, I'll, by your great Example, learn to be As kind to you, as you are good to me. Wife. I've all that can enrich my peaceful Mind, I need no further Comforts than I find; Great as a Queen upon this verdant Throne I sit, belov'd by you, controul'd by none; You are my sov'reign Consort, and your Hook Our Scepter, that commands the trembling Flock; The Plain our Kingdom, where our Subjects graze, The Foxes and the Wolves our Enemies, Our Word, our Penal Laws, and the poor Cur Our watchful speedy Executioner; Who, at our Feet, lies ready to obey, And smartly punish those that run astray, Rends their white Garments they by Nature wear, Hating their Wool because he's cloath'd with Hair; So the black Robe, who do the Laws attend, With lab'ring Jaws fleece others that offend. Why therefore should not we contented be, Wh' enjoy a mild and peaceful Sov'reignty, And think our selves as Happy and as Great, As they who with more trouble Rule a State, Since Monarchs have less Ease and more Disputes, Who govern Men, than those who govern Brutes. Moral Reflexions on the foregoing Dialogue. [A rural Life upon the Plains] A rural Life upon the Plains, To those of Contemplation, Where Temp'rance dwells and Vertue reigns, Must be a happy Station. The charming Woods and flow'ry Meads, Each gliding Brook and River, Must fill our humble Hearts and Heads With rev'rence tow'rds the Giver. No Party Lies or Statesman's Shams In Solitude can reach us, Where grazing Flocks and gentle Lambs Sweet Innocence must teach us. No Observators or Reviews, Infest the Plains or Meadows; Or false seditious printed News, That gull the Town with Shadows. The Swains their happy Nymphs embrace, And know no jealous Passion; They're ignorant of what is base, And dwell beneath Temptation. Who then would not forsake the Town, So full of Feuds and Clamours, For sweet Content, that's only known To Gaffers and to Gammers. Dialogue XXIII. Between a rattle-headed News-monger, and his prudent Wife. Husband. Brave News, my Dear, it joys my Heart, I vow, To see how blue the Jacobites look now, Eugene has beat the French, and taken Lisle, There's News, my Love, would make a Woman smile No High Church Wasp can say there's nothing in't, The Post-Man has confirm'd it; 'tis in print. Bless me! I've won I know not what, my Dear, Two Quarts of Claret, and three Pots of Beer, 'Efaith, and Six-pence too in ready Money: There's Luck, my Girl, there's happy News, my Honey? Wife. You'd better mind your Shop, than teaze your Brains With News of Sieges, Battles, and Campaigns, Inflame your Passions and distract your Wits, In scanning what each partial Blockhead writes; Ill News they dare not tell you, and if good, They make it ten times better than they shou'd. Why then from Bus'ness will you daily run, To hear what such State-Parrots tell the Town, Which when you know, and think yourself more wise, You're only stuff'd with Guesses, Shams, and Lies; For tho', perhaps, some Truths they may impart, Yet then 'tis dash'd and brew'd with so much Art, That few Men are so skilful to refine What's Sterling, from their base, tho' current Coin: Besides, what bus'ness is't of yours to glean The foreign Actions of the Great Eugene? Or to be so importunate to know What's done A broad by the brave Marlborough? Should you neglect your Shop, and waste your Wealth, In drinking this Great Man or t'others Health, You'd find, if broke, that neither would maintain Your Family, or set you up again. Why therefore will you hourly run in quest Of News, till beggar'd and become a Jest? When let things happen either ill or well, The Consequence at last the Truth must tell. Till then, my Dear, you should with Patience wait, Because let Good or Bad come soon or late, You must with others, share the common Fate. Husband. Prithee, my Dear, mind selling of my Wares, Women but little know of State-Affairs; Wives, in these Times, should keep our Shops, whilst we Compare the Prints, and see how things agree. What! wouldst thou have me be an empty Fool, And know no more of News than Jobbernole? Why, prithee, ev'ry Cobler quits his Awl, And twice a Day for Coffee leaves his Stall, Purely to read, or if he can't, to hear What Wonders we have done this present Year. Porters, at ev'ry Corner of the Street, Read nothing now but Post-Man and Gazette. The Tritons of the Thames at ev'ry Stairs, Who us'd to bawl and scold about their Fares, Forget their Animosities of late, And only squabble now about the State. St. Magnes Carmen, who would curse when vext At the Church-door, about whose Turn was next, Have long forsaken their old heath'nish use, And only wrangle now about the News. If such Paltroons as these presume to pry Into State-Secrets, why, my Dear, may'nt I? If those, when round an Ale-house Kitchen-fire, Of Fleets and Armies may at large enquire; Talk loosely when a well-laid Project fails, And watch the Changes of the Wind, for Mails, Sure 'tis no Crime in such as I, to Con The News, that I may know how things go on. Why then should I, a foolish Wife to please, Be kept more ign'rant than such Brutes as these? Wife. He's the most Ign'rant who neglects his Good, To run with other Fools the Common Road; Your Business is your Family's support, The less you do the more 'tis to your hurt; Trade is your Substance, which you ought to mind, But News a shadow to amuse Mankind; And if you slight the former, thro' Mistake, Like some vain Parrots for their Chatter's sake, The Fable Puppy was as Wife a Creature, And I should think you one of Æsop's Litter. Besides, if News be canvass'd by such Vermin, As Porters, Link-boys, Watermen, and Carmen, What Man of Sense would waste six hours a day To be as learn'd in Politicks as they, Or who but Fools would value any sort Of Pastime, once become the Rabble's sport? If their Examples you so well esteem, Why don't you swill Full-pots, and swear like them, Prophane, Blaspheme, Lye, Squabble, Roar, and Fight, And in Bear-Garden Combats take delight, As well as to so eagerly pursue That Fox, call'd News, as such loose Scoundrels do. If they your printed Oracles defile, Frown at one Passage, at another smile, 'Tis time for Tradesmen to despise the News, And other Whims for their Diversion chuse. Husband. Away, you prating Woman, you are blind To those Delights that we o'er Coffee find; Here lies the Post-Man, and the learn'd Review, There the Post-Boy and Observator too, Here the Gazette, Currant, and Flying-Post; There Pipes and Candle, by the Fire my Host; Yonder the fam'd Rehearsal by himself; Mugs, Dishes, Glasses, rang'd on ev'ry Shelf, Before the Fire a Nest of boiling Pots, All crown'd with Covers, like to high-crown'd Hats, Some larger, like the Parents of the rest, But all alike in sooty Mourning drest, Large Bills in Lacquer'd Frames, the Walls adorn, To cure the Pox, Gout, Dropsy, Stone, or Corn; Washes to make your Beauty shine more bright, And Powders that will bring black Teeth to white; Amongst the rest, Rich Cordials to recover A dying Patient or a fainting Lover, At th'upper end a Bar of Wainscoat, where, To change your Money, sits a Lady fair; Over her tow'ring Head in rank and file Stands Physick, some to Cure and some to Kill, In order to supply, at little cost, That want of Pow'r her fading Charms have lost. In Change-time then the Guess croud in and out, Some drink, some read, some smoak, some stare about, Whilst others nettl'd with some News they hear, Squirt too and fro, look round, and disappear; One gravely cons o'er some authentick Print, Pores till he's vex'd, then swears there's nothing in't. Another, to a Grave attentive Croud, Reads the Post-Man with all his Art aloud, Pleas'd that each list'ning Merchant in the Room, Should hear how well he can pronounce Vendosme; A Third steps in and vents some strange Report, Confirms the same by some great Man at Court, Laughs in his sleeve to see us all amus'd, And then steals out and leaves the Guest confus'd; Others contend about the News they hear, One says 'tis doubtful, t'other says 'tis clear, At length a Wager is propos'd, and then, When once commenc'd, 'tis back'd by Eight or Ten. These are our Sports, and pray, what Man, to please A Wife, would forfeit such Delights as these; 'Tis not the News that we alone pursue, We've fifty Pastimes, yet untold to you, The Papers are but Baits that draw us in We meet before our Commedies begin; For every Guest that enters plays his Part, Or else our Farce don't signify a F?t; And as for the Review and Observator, They're the meer Zanies of our New Theatre, They make the Mischief and begin the Fray, Whilst I sit by and laugh, to see fair play, Thrust in a word or so, to whet their Spleen, And make their Malice and their Wits more keen, I only read the News that I may know, Which way to thwart a Jacobite, or so, Or plague a High-Church Neighbour, when I find, That Fortune shoots point-blank against his Mind. Wife. Those shallow Reasons lessen not your Crime, Such foolish Trifles are not worth your time, You'd better mind your own Affairs, than please Your self in height'ning Animosities; What profit can attend such fruitless Ends, But want, at least, of Business and of Friends; The most you by such Measures can propose Is loss of Trade, and the encrease of Foes: What Man but you could keep his mind at Ease, And waste his time in such Delights as these? Prithee, for shame, reform your frantick Life, And take, for once, good Counsel from a Wife, Forsake your noisy Coffee-house and your News, Where wrangling Pens the jarring World amuse. Let Scriblers write and Party Zealots read, Stay you at home and wisely mind your Trade; For News is but a Policy of State, To make the little Fools admire the great. Moral Reflexions on the foregoing Dialogue. [Whilst busy Cits neglect their Shop] Whilst busy Cits neglect their Shop, To turn State Politicians, No human Arts on Earth can stop The growth of our Divisions. Each Fool manures his barren head, By contradicting Papers, When all the Nonsence that they read, But turns to windy Vapours. Yet tutor'd by the Flying-Post, The Gazettes, and the Post-Men, Each fancies he can rule a Host, Or steer a Fleet with most Men. When thus grown wise in their Conceit, And skilful in State-matters, They charge the Fault, when things don't hit, Unjustly on their Betters. Thus every shallow Dolt-head vents Some groundless Exclamation, And raises Feuds and Discontents, To th'Mischief of the Nation. Therefore the prudent Wife should use All Female soft Persuasion, To draw her Spouse from reading News, To mind his Occupation. Dialogue XXIV. Between the happy Pair, concerning the Comforts of mutual Fidelity, and the innocent Pleasures of a retir'd Life. Husband. How bless'd, dear Chloe, is this sweet Recess? How happy does our Love make ev'ry Place? The charming Beauty which your Looks display, Makes all Things pleasant, innocent, and gay. Thus seated, we, without Offence, may boast That blissful State our sinful Parents lost. Wife. Your kind Deportment, my indulgent Dear, Your Love, Fidelity, and tender Care Fill me with Joy, your Mansion house with Peace, And make the World to me seem Paradise; Where no Disorders reach my quiet Breast, Or anxious Sorrows interrupt my Rest; But all Things to my Happiness conspire, And leave me nothing farther to desire For since your Love is so divinely true, The Gods have giv'n me all, in giving you. Husband. What savage Fury must possess my Mind, To make me otherwise than just and kind, Since all the Vertues that adorn the Fair, Meet in your pious Breast, and centre there; Whilst your external Charms, and lovely Mein, Proclaim those Heav'nly Gifts that lodge within; And ev'ry Hour your loving Looks convey New Blessings to my Soul some secret way? Wife. O! that I had but Beauty to reward Your faithful Love, and generous Regard; Then might I merit that Esteem, which now Does only from your native Goodness flow: But I must own, I have too great a share Of those weak Failings that affect the Fair; And have not Charms sufficient to repay Those kind Endearments I receive each Day. However, Dearest, I'll obedient prove, And still abound in Duty and in Love; That what I want in outward Gifts, may be Made up in Vertue and Humility. Husband. Such kind Angelick Words, my Dear, must move A grateful Breast to an Excess of Love. Had you no Charms, but Eloquence alone, Express'd in such a soft and gentle Tone, 'Twould be enough to win a Heart like mine, And make me glad to be entirely thine. But, Chloe, you, besides, are young and fair, And good as the immortal Angels are; Humble, obedient, generous, and kind, Adorn'd with all the Riches of the Mind, That any Wife can boast, or Husband wish to find. Wife. O! that I could for ever but enjoy So bless'd a Life, which Death will once destroy! Why should my Love be punish'd with the Fear Of ever parting with a Spouse so dear? O! why should the severe Decrees of Fate Put a dark Period to our happy State? And leave the sad Surviver, to bemoan A Life so wretched, when the other's gone, That can admit no Comfort or Relief, To ease our Groans, or moderate our Grief? Husband. 'Tis hard, my Chloe; but the Gods are kind, And for the Just, have future Joys design'd; That Lovers, when they part, may ease their Pain, By pleasing Hopes of meeting once again. Death's but a peaceful Slumber in the Grave; When we awake, we endless Life shall have; And on eternal Wings, from thence arise Beyond the Limits of yon dusky Skies; There dwell in Friendship, with the Gods above, And be for ever bless'd in Peace and Love. Wife. 'Tis a great Comfort to my Soul, that we Can be assur'd we shall for ever be; For what could more disturb our happy State, Than the distracting Fears, that Joys so great, Should in eternal Silence terminate? Husband. These Thoughts, my charming Chloe, seem too grave For a young Bride in all her Bloom to have. Futurity's a Mystery too great For Female Wit to fathom or debate. Such Things we to our wiser Guides should leave, Lest our weak Reason should our selves deceive. Let us believe those Wonders we are taught; Strive to be just in Action, and in Thought; Be careful to support our Innocence; Give neither to the Gods or Man Offence. Pursue these Measures, hoping to be blest And to kind Providence resign the rest, Who wisely orders all Things for the best. Wife. Your friendly Dictates, are of greatest Force; What you command me, I obey in course; I'm taught alone, by what you say and do; And hope I need no other Guide but you; Your kind Examples are a tempting Road To Vertue, Piety, and all that's good. Therefore, my Dear, I cannot fear to stray, Whilst you conduct me thro' so safe a way. Husband. Since, my dear Chloe, you depend on me, I shall the more exact and upright be: For who would from the Paths of Vertue fly, To lead such charming Innocence awry? What Man would, by the brightest Looks, be led, From the just Pleasures of his Nuptial Bed, Who has so true a Friend, so kind a Wife, To crown the Comforts of a vertuous Life? What Sot would such sweet Company decline, To scorch his Nerves with an Excess of Wine; And stagger into such delightful Arms, Thoughtless of Love, and sensless of your Charms? There belching lie, of Vigour dispossest, Slighting those Joys he has no Pow'r to taste. Thus the sick Appetite disdains the Food As nauseous, which the Healthful find is good. Usage, like this, might Female Thoughts confound, And make the strictest Vertue quit her Ground. But you, I hope, dear Chloe, are assur'd, That you from all such Dangers are secur'd: For I have too much Sense of your Desert, Too just a Conscience, and too kind a Heart, To suffer you, the Comfort of my Breast, A Wife so charming, so divinely blest, To feel the Torments of unmanly Strife, Or lead an injur'd, or neglected Life: For I have Sense and Gratitude to know The Nuptial Blessings we expect below, Must from true Love and mutual Vertue flow. Wife. You make your Goodness ev'ry Moment known; I fear not yours, but rather doubt my own, Lest Female Weakness spoils my good Intent, And renders that amiss, which well is meant; So that my Love, which glows to an Extream, May short of yours, thro' Indiscretion, seem. For the rough Diamond cannot shine so bright, As the Gem polish'd to a skilful height; Yet both may equal Estimation bear, Tho' one with greater Lustre does appear. Husband. But, Love, that Jewel which adorns the Heart, Shines the most bright without the Help of Art; All other Wealth in Value it exceeds; And if it's true, it no Improvement needs; Its own intrinsick Worth it will display, And thro' the Eyes, like Lightning, make its way. Therefore, dear Chloe, I your Love can view, In each kind Thing you either say or do: Your Looks alone, sufficiently impart The gen'rous Ardour that inflames your Heart; So that 'tis I must summon all my Pow'rs, To make my Friendship adequate to yours; For in your Heav'nly Nature, I discern Those Duties, others must be forc'd to learn! Wife. You make me happy in your kind Conceit That in my Breast such Love and Vertue meet. O! that I could but be as free from Fau'ts, And raise my Merits equal to your Thoughts, Then should I hope so rich a Heart might prove, Deserving your inestimable Love: But I, alas, can boast no Charms to please, No Arts to palliate my Infirmities; I have no study'd Smiles t'improve my Air: No skilful Means to make my Looks more fair; But must at best discover, that I am A rural, home-spun, tho' an honest Dame, Who nothing but her Vertue has to boast, And can but prove a loving Wife at most. Husband. Your native Sweetness I alone admire, And your Esteem is all that I desire, Besides the Offspring of our Nuptial Bed, To bless the future World, when we are dead: For amongst all that Heaven has in Store, No kind Donation could I wish for more, Than that the Fruits of so divine a Tree, Might spread and flourish to Eternity, That distant Ages still to come, might read Thy noble Vertues in our gen'rous Seed. Wife. I hope, my Dear, since 'tis your earnest Choice, That Heav'n, in Time, will crown our Nuptial Joys: Few Moons, as yet, have pass'd that happy Day, On which I vow'd to honour and obey: My tender Years may still with Patience wait; I'm unexperienc'd in a marry'd State: And therefore know not but the Gods above, May have already crown'd our mutual Love. Husband. I wish it so may prove; with what Delight Could I behold so promising a Sight? A Wife so beauteous, pregnant in her Bloom; A Female Angel with a fruitful Womb. May Nature's Pow'rs the darling Bud encrease, And the kind Gods the happy Fœtus bless, That I may live to tremble at thy Cries, Pity those Pains that do thy Nerves surprize, And pray good Heav'n to turn thy Sorrows into Joys. Wife. The Pangs of Child-birth, doubtless must be great, Tedious the Moments, and severe the Fate; But yet, methinks I could with Patience bear The sharpest Suff'rings, to oblige my Dear. What is't I could not do? What Hazards run, To raise your Image in a sprightly Son? That your own Likeness, full of Infant Charms, Might bless your Eyes, and my indulging Arms. Husband. How happy, dearest Chloe, should we be, To see a fair Angelick Progeny, Sporting around us, free of all Offence, Like Cherubs in a State of Innocence? Some wearing on their Brows your beauteous Smiles, That their sweet Looks may bless their Father's Toils; Others appearing of a courser mould, Like me, more active, masculine, and bold; That you each Hour in Miniture may view My Image, and your fading Love renew. Wife. No Time, my dear Philander, can impair The high Esteem I for your Vertues bear; Th'Impression is too strong, my Love too great, For Age or Envy to obliterate. I ne'er shall want such Blessings to revive Those vertuous Flames, that will for ever live; Yet should I think my self divinely blest, To hug your Image at my tender Breast, That those Indearments, I should fondly shew To my sweet Babe, altho' by Nature due, Might manifest the Love I bear to you. Husband. I doubt not, Chloe, but the Gods will bless Our Nuptial Comforts with desir'd Success. Let us, with Patience, wait the happy Time; For to prescribe to Heav'n, would be a Crime. The Sun's just set, and tho' the Evening's warm, I fear the falling Damps should do us Harm: Unwholsome Vapours may infect the Air; Let's quit the Bow'r, and to the House repair; Sup with Content, to Bed when we have done; Where all the Joys of Life are summ'd in one. Wife. I'm free to all that is your Will to do, Your prudent Measures gladly I pursue; For I am only happy in obeying you. Moral Reflexions on the foregoing Dialogue. [Where mutual Love 'twixt Man and Wife] Where mutual Love 'twixt Man and Wife Adorns a marry'd Station, It sweetens all the Cares of Life, And leaves no room for Passion. Angelick Peace, that Heav'nly Dow'r, That estimable Treasure, Crowns ev'ry happy Day and Hour With inexpressive Pleasure. Indearing Smiles, and loving Words, Give Comfort to each other; And ev'ry kind Embrace, affords New Causes of another. Each Minute blooms with fresh Delight, That ripens to a Blessing; And Love unweary'd Crowns the Night With Joys beyond expressing. Fill'd with Content reciprocal, They ease each other's Labours: Thus do they live belov'd of all, And honour'd by their Neighbours. Whilst jarring Fools in Discord dwell, That 'tis a Shame to hear 'em; And prove as noisy as Bow-Bell, To all that live but near 'em. Dialogue XXV. Between a generous Mechanick and his old stingy Wife, about her locking up the Cupboard to keep the Victuals from his Apprentices. Husband. Hey day! what's here to do? the Cupboard door Lock'd up! what, Madam, must we eat no more? Why, how now, Mistress Wife, who is it puts This Bar betwixt my Victuals and my Guts? Boys, split the Door: why sure, my saving Honey, You don't take Beef and Bread and Cheese for Money? Wife. Don't be so hasty, Love, I mean no hurt, Here take the Key, 'tis but their asking for't: Did you but see the Waste those Gluttons make, You'd then commend me for the Care I take. That slouching Rogue that laughs at what you say, Had he his Will, would eat ten times a Day. That thin-jaw'd Hound too, had he but his Mind, For all his Looks, would not be far behind: Victuals, I'll swear, is ill bestow'd upon That sneaking Whelp, that raw-bon'd Skeleton; Were he to eat as much as half a dozen, The ill-got Lout would still look starv'd and frozen. Husband. Therefore it shan't be said I keep him poor And thin, because I lock my Cupboard-Door: I'll have no Smith's Embargo on my Food, Eat Boys, as often as yourselves see good; Let them have change of Mutton, Beef, and Pork, Do you take care they Feed, I'll make 'em Work. My Servants shall to no Relations creep, And there complain of what a House I keep; Tell 'em their stingy Mistress bears the Rule, And cry because they ha'n't a Belly-full. Let me have no such doings I command, I scorn to give a Wife the upper-hand: I'm Master here, mind you your Maids concerns, No Boy of mine shall want the Food he earns. Wife. Lord! Love, you cannot think what they devour, I vow and swear they're Cramming ev'ry Hour? Saw you how oft they to the Cupboard come, You'd think they'd eat you out of House and Home. One gobbles down two Pound of Bread and Cheese, When almost burst to th'Vault he runs for ease; From thence returns unburthen'd in a trice, And stuffs his empty Guts with t'other Slice: No sooner is this wide mouth'd Glutton gone, But t'other lean jaw'd Cormorant sneaks down, And he, forsooth, no Cheshire-Cheese can eat, His dainty Chops must break his Fast with Meat, Then out he pulls his Knife, and off he cuts A Pound of Beef for his insatiate Guts, Which his stretch'd Gullet swallows down so fast, As if he meant each Bit should prove his last; For in three Minutes fairly he'll devour More than would last an hungry Dog an Hour, Straining with Morsels so profusely great, You'd think him choak'd with ev'ry Bit he eat: Thus, all day long, like Buckets in a Well, They take their Turns to empty and to fill; And is it fit, d'ye think, such Wolves as these, Should search and range the Cupboard when they please. Husband. Yes, yes, much good may do 'em with their Meat, I never care how fast my Servants eat, Speedy at Victuals, quick at Work's an old Proverbial Saying, we have oft been told; I've found it true, and therefore do not grutch Their eating nimbly, tho' 'tis ne'er so much: I'll warr'nt you'd have them loiter at their Meals, Piddle like Mice and crawl about like Snails, Feed like sick Patients dieted by Quacks, And look like hide-bound Tits that carry Packs, Work too like those that raise the Wooden Walls Of the Queen's Ships, or lazy Rogues in Paul's: No, no, my Master's Methods I'll pursue, That's Feed 'em well, and make 'em Work so too; For he that stints his Servants in their Food, Makes the Bad worse, and irritates the Good, That what he thinks he saves they cast away, And makes his Stock their pinch-gut Money pay. Wife. Do as you please, my Dear, but I am sure, Such wastful Ways will always keep us poor; Apprentices I've seen in other Trades, Have their Meat carv'd by th'Mistress or her Maids, Nor did they dare to grumble or complain, That this was cut too Fat, or that too Lean, But eat whate'er the Mistress thought was fit, And fear'd to frown, or ask for t'other Bit; But your bold Boys, regarding not your Wife, When call'd to dine, each draws his crooked Knife, Upon the Groundcel whets his Sheffield Blade, And both, forsooth, sit down before my Maid, Fall to like Plow-men at a Country Feast, And with unhallow'd Fingers pick the best; One crying out, Go, Hannah, draw some Beer; The other, Huzzy, bring the Mustard here. Indeed, my Dear, it is a shame to see Apprentices so very bold and free, Or that at Meals such Boys should first sit down, And crow above a Wench that's Woman grown. Husband. My Boys are good Mens Sons, well born and bred, They've paid me Pounds for teaching them my Trade, Besides, they earn me ev'ry Day they Dine, Not only their own Bread, but yours and mine; Yet, I suppose, you want to have 'em made Meer Slaves and Footboys to your nasty Jade, To run to th'Chandlers for the Mops and Brooms, And fetch her Water when she scrubs her Rooms, Be her Cole-heavers to preserve her Hands, And stoop to all her prodigal Commands; If that's your drift, my parsimonious Dame, I shall take care to disappoint your Aim; No saucy Baggage, fondl'd by a Fool, Shall awe my Servants, or my Boys controul; I'd have you know I keep such Sluts as she, To wait on them at Meals as well as me; I give her yearly Wages, and you ought To know their Work enables me to do't; My golden Boys earn Money ev'ry Day, By them I live and thrive, eat, drink and pay; Therefore yourself and survile Puss shall find, No Lads of mine your Female Pride shall mind; That Master, sure, must be a Hen peck'd Fool, Who lets the Women o'er his Men bear Rule; 'Tis hard that good Mens Children, bound to Trades, Should be made Lacqueys to our Wives and Maids; But in those Tradesmens Houses 'twill be so, Where Men are silent and the Women crow. Moral Reflexions on the foregoing Dialogue. [The prudent Master, who allows] The prudent Master, who allows His Servants what is fitting, Shews by his Conduct, that he knows, Hard Work requires good Eating. The Master seldom thrives in Trade, Who keeps a sneaking Table, Apprentices are thereby made Less willing and less able. Whilst those who feed 'em with good Fare, By Servants are befriended. Have all their Work dispatch'd with Care, And in due Season ended. But where a Wife shall rule the Roast, Whose Temper's too penurious, What she believes she saves, is lost, And only proves injurious. No Servants, in Revenge, will waste The Food that they're in love of, But into Holes will slily cast The Meat they don't approve of. Besides, he gains an honest Name, Who makes his Servants easy, If you are kind they'll be the same, And strive the more to please ye. Dialogue XXVI. Between a nice affected Gentleman, and his careless, slatternly Lady. Husband. Why are your Night-cloaths on, your Stays unlac'd? I love to see you powder'd, wash'd, and dress'd. A tallow Face in dirty Pinners looks Like a poor Punk just risen from a Flux: You crown the Proverb, That the nicest Maid Becomes the greatest Slattern when she's wed; And that each Woman in a Nuptial State, Proves careless Slut, or Jilt, by Choice or Fate. Wife. Thank you, my Spouse, some People say, a Beau, When marry'd, does the greater Coxcomb grow. Prithee, my Dear, don't be so nice, lest you Should chance to prove the modern Proverb true. I've heard most Men are subject to admire The Woman that they like in loose Attire; From whence 'tis said our Sex is always best Approv'd by Lovers, when we're most undrest: But I perceive, alas, you squeamish Beaus, Think female Beauty dwells in formal Cloaths; And when our Charms upon your hands grow stale, Neglect the Kernel to adore the Shell. So the weak Appetite must have his Meat Set off with artful Sauce to make him eat, Whilst the sound Stomach feasts on Flesh or Fish, And ne'er regards the Garnish of the Dish. Husband. Women and Food I love to see well drest, For what offends my Eye ne'er sutes my Taste. Who but a Sloven can admire a Face, Unwash'd, unpatch'd, mob'd up in dirty Lace, Whose ruffl'd Trallups disoblige the Sight, And shew by Day, how wanton you're at Night; Those Coifs between the Nuptial Sheets you wear, Should never in the Noon of Light appear; They make you look like Sempstress of the Town, In rumpl'd Disabil, just bolted down Some Temple-Stairs, from earning Half-a-Crown. Believe me, therefore, I abhor to see A Wife loose Rig'd, so like a Punk as thee; With sully'd Night cloaths dangling round thy Head Dy'd yellow with your joyful Sweats in Bed. Prithee withdraw, dear Dowdy, from my View, Or what should raise my Love will make me S?w. Wife. Tho' now you seem so nice, were you to 'spy A newer Face, tho' more a Slut than I, Wrap'd up in Muslin-Rags, not half so white, Tug'd ev'ry Day and rumpl'd ev'ry Night, Tho' wash'd but once a Week, you'd never mind Her Dress, but be to all her Failings blind; Would she but dart from her prevailing Brows, One smiling glance to wound my Beauish Spouse, Or say so loud t'her Maid, that you might hear, Laud he's a pretty Gentleman, I'll swear; I can but think how you'd admire the Dame, And with her dirty Pinners fan your Flame, Swear her foul Linnen was the only Grace, Or Foil, to set off such a beauteous Face; And that it gave such freedom to her Air, That made her look less formal and more fair: These are the Flatt'ries you can use to those Whose Bodies are unclean as well as Cloaths; But 'tis a wond'rous Crime to see a Wife In dirty Nightrail or a sully'd Coif. Why, squeamish Husband, do you not despise The tarnish'd Plate that in your Coffer lies; Or scorn the Ground you tread on, cause 'tis wont, Sometimes, like me, to harbour Dust upon't: I'm none of those that spend six Hours a Day, To appear, by study'd Arts, more young and gay; I to no Pencil do my Eye-brows owe, Nor do my Cheeks with Spanish Crimson glow; I use no Washes to improve my Skin, Nor Acids drink to keep my Body lean, That my nice Shapes, to merit humane Praise, May still sit easy in my Maiden Stays: I use no skilful Means in my Attire, To make young Fools, in vain, my Charms admire. I love my tender Children, and delight To toy with them all Day, with you at Night, And must a sully'd Nightrail now offend, Or a coarse Pinner make you less my Friend; Change you your Temper and 'twill change the Scene, Be you less nice, and I shall seem more clean: Husband's should wink, when now and then they find Their Wives confus'd in Dress, as well as Mind: What tho' unclean by chance, Experience tells, The best of Oysters may have dirty Shells. Husband. But you, as if you meant to thwart my Will, Are always in a Slatterns Disabil; And shew, by constant practice, you delight More in foul Linnen than you do in white. E're I with Pains had won you to my Arms, Your Dress was then unsully'd as your Charms, The finest Laces did your Temples crown, White as the driven Snow or Thistly Down; Your Gloves, your Fan, and ev'ry thing you wore As clean as if unmade an Hour before; But since I've brought you to a Nuptial Life, And you're become a Mother and a Wife, Uncleanly Negligence your Charms disgrace, And foul Indecence muffles up your Face; For want of Stays your Sides prepost'rous grow, And hang in wallups o'er your Hips below, Both join, nor can your Apron strings between, Bury'd in Folds of flabby Fat, be seen; Your Breast, like Udders, to your Navel drop, For want of Stomacher to prop them up; And your Pot Belly, swell'd with Drink and Ease, Seems full of Dropsical Infirmities; Your Petticoats, half-ty'd, hang loosely on, Like a burst Hoop about an upright Tun: And your stain'd Flag of Hussifry before, Looks worse than that by greasy Scullion wore; Your Nightrail too, which round your Neck you tye, To hide your Shapes, is of a Saffron dye, That any Eye would guess 't'as lain, at least, This fifty Years, unwash'd, in Grannum's Chest; Your Wirey-Hair, like Ell-flocks, starts beneath Your Coif, and hangs in here and there a Wreath, Whilst your plump Cheeks, by Nature fram'd to please, Look grim'd with Dirt, like Vulcan's smutty Phiz: These are the Graces that adorn your Charms, To please your Spouse and tempt him to your Arms. Who then can marry'd live, and not admire So nice a Hussif in such clean Attire. Wife. Right Beau, to loath what you have long enjoy'd, I'm not so sluttish, but your Fancy's cloy'd, And now 'tis Pleasure to your wand'ring Thoughts, To School your Wife and magnify her Fau'ts. Could you but with impartial Judgment see Your own nice, foppish Pride and Vanity; In what a formal Gesture you delight, What Pains you take to make your Wig sit right, With what premeditated Grace you bend Your formal Shoulders to your Bosom-Friend, How you advance, what Dancing Steps you take, When to a Lady your Approach you make, How you exchange your Ruffles thrice a Day, How oft you powder, to appear more Gay, What Time you waste before the flatt'ring Glass, To turn and tiff and make your self an Ass, What Hours in Dressing you confound in vain, To shew your self less wise than other Men, You then no more would wonder why I seem A Slut to him, so nice to an Extream; For I must either play the Fool and rise To all your squeamish cleanly Vanities, Or be a Slattern deem'd, 'cause I admire My Ease beyond extravagant Attire; Would you your Foppish Vanities abate, And from your nice Extreams turn moderate, I'd meet you then half way, and strive to dress With newer Air and greater Cleanliness: But if a Fly-speck on my Paper-Fan, Or a soil'd Glove, must merit your Disdain, An accidental Spot upon my Gown, Or a chance Lock displac'd shall make you Frown; So long in vain must I attempt to please, Whilst you're offended with such things as these Consider, I've been seven Years a Wife, My Children are the Pleasures of Life, 'Tis time for me to quit my tempting Airs, And bend my Genius to my Home Affairs, To mind my Female Servants, and to see Their Work perform'd with Care and Hussifry These Nuptial Duties must sometimes employ A Wife from Dressing to delight your Eye: Nor can I think it otherwise than vain, In you, a Father and a marry'd Man, To still maintain that youthful foppish Pride, Which Men at riper Years should lay aside: I equally abhor to find you please Your self with such fantastick Fooleries, And vex as much to see you dizen'd up, With all the Frip'ries of a foolish Fop, As you can do when I appear unlac'd, Or in soil'd Linnen, like a Slattern dress'd; Therefore expect I'll still more sluttish grow, Till you forbear to be so much a Beau; Both are Extreams, and I'll confront you thus, Whilst you're a Fop, I'll be a nasty Puss. Moral Reflexions on the foregoing Dialogue. [When Husbands do their Wives reprove] When Husbands do their Wives reprove, For Failings that displease 'em, Themselves should willingly remove Their own worse Faults that teaze 'em. Men in some Cases should be mute, For Women will not bear so Provoking an Affront as Slut, Altho' they know they are so. 'Tis true, a Woman's to be blam'd, That's Careless and Uncleanly, But he's as much to be condemn'd, That's Foppish and Unmanly. When am'rous Beau has wedded Miss, From Sampler and from Pattern, Sir Courtly should not prove too Nice, Nor she too great a Slattern. Tho' Wives, when Children crown their Joys, Will in their Dress be careless, And more regard their Girls and Boys, Than their Commode and Hair-lace. Good Dames may therefore claim excuse, Who Children have to dandle, They cannot always dress so spruce, As when they'd none to Fondle. Dialogue XXVII. Between a High-Church Gentleman and his Low-Church Lady, about the difference of of their Opinions. Husband. Come, come, my Dear, forsake your Canting Tribe, Marriage has made you now my crooked Rib, My Flesh can brook no Lame Dissenting Bone, Join with the rest, or you my Side disown; A dislocated stubborn Rib I hate. Prithee, to Church, and that will set thee streight. Wife. D'ye think I'll go to Mass, not I, indeed, I'll be no Convert to a Popish Creed: No, Satan, I defy thy wicked Power, No Babylonian Whore shall draw me to her; I hate her Smock, her Porridge, and her Pipes, Her Butcher's-Sleeves, her Crosses, and her Types, Her Pagan Altars, and her Dagon Priests, Her Easter Off'rings, and her Christmas Feasts, Her Shepherd's Crooks, her Miters, and her Saints, Her Pancake Tuesdays, and her starving Lents; I'd sooner chuse to bear your utmost hate, Than damn my precious Soul at such a rate; Therefore, pray Husband, let's have no Dispute, For Fire and Faggot should not bring me to't. Husband. Thy stiff-neck'd Guide has taught thee wondrous well, Something I find thou'st learn'd, and that's to Rail; Are these the Bell'wings of thy Hornbook Dunce, Who, like ripe bottled Ale, must Froth and Bounce, To please the gaping Fools who sit in Throngs, To catch the Bleatings of his painful Lungs. How easily, alas, are Fools betray'd To villify the Good and chuse the Bad? How soon will shallow Reason quit its place, For the bald empty sound of Saving Grace, Breath'd thro' the Gullet of an Ass that Brays, And hideously confounds whate'er he says; Empty as Eccho, full of only Voice, Dull as the Brazen-Head that spoke but thrice. And you believe the Nonsence you have heard, Squeez'd out between Hawk-Nose and Peaked-Beard, By a grave doating Wizard, who forsook His Weaver's Shuttle for a Changling-Flock, That by Pretences to a heav'nly Gift, The Saint inspir'd might make a better shift, Glean once a Quarter from each Blockhead's Store, And live himself at Ease, who starv'd before. Shame on the stupid Ign'rance of your Youth, To be misled by Nonsence from the Truth; As if a canting Owl, in Garret bred, To wind off Silk or manage Skains of Thread, Unskill'd in Books, taught only to dispute The diff'rent Prizes of his Warp and Shoot, Should more of Scripture and Religion know, Than those who to that learned Fountain go, Where sacred Truths in Chrystal Channels flow. Wife. You'd need find Fault, indeed, and say that I Am taught to only rail and villify, When you reflect that I the Church asperse, I'm sure the Kettle calls the Pot Black arse. How can you thus abuse so good a Saint, So heavenly a Guide as Mr. Quaint, So Grave, so Pious, and as Just a Man, As ever preach'd 'twixt Bersheba and Dan? What tho', perhaps, when young, he was not bred At what you Churchmen call the Fountain-head? Can Holy Men to Knowledge never rise, But they must pass your Popish Versities? How came the Prophets, pray, to leave behind Those Holy Truths which we in Scripture find? I've heard they ne'er were whip'd at Grammar-School, Nor taught long Lessons, or to speak by Rule, Yet they (Good-Men) all Christians must allow, Were wiser far than all your Bishops now; Besides th'Apostles too were meanly bred, Some to catch Fish, and that's no learned Trade, Yet they commanded were to go and teach All Nations, and without a Book could Preach, Much better than your Priests, who strain their Throats To pray by Mass Books and to preach by Notes. Why then mayn't Holy-Men from Looms be call'd, As well as Peter from the Nets he haul'd, And be inspir'd, like him, to shew aright, The Path that leads to everlasting Light. Husband. Well said, my Dear, you've let me see at once, How Fools are taught to vindicate a Dunce, Who has no other way to be admir'd, But to pretend a Call and seem Inspir'd. So Pagan Kings, to hide their mean Descent, Back'd by their Priests, strange Stories would invent, That they were born of Heav'n to rule a State, Tho' brawny Clown begot the spurious Brat. Just so your Guides, proud Hypocrites at Heart, Who from their Garrets into Pulpits start, Pretend Commission by a Call unknown, To be, by Grace, adopted Heaven's Son; And that those Myst'ries from the Fools conceal'd, Are only to the yawning Knaves reveal'd. What tho' the Apostles from their Nets were made Fishers of Men, as 'tis in Scripture said; Their Holy Lives, the Doctrine that they taught, Their pious Works, the Miracles they wrought, All plainly prove they were by Heav'n inspir'd, With Gifts that could not be by Art acquir'd; They nothing taught but what's divinely Good, And ev'ry distant Language understood; But your illit'rate Dunce, your groaning Block, Who whoops and hollows to his brainless Flock, With all his Gifts that labour in his Crown, No Language understands, nay, not his own, But cons his Lesson till by heart 'tis got, And, Parrot-like, talks Scripture but by rote; Therefore he tells you 'tis a Crime to look, In time of Preaching, on the Sacred Book, Because he knows he should be run a-ground, In reading what he ventures to expound: His Hems, his Hesitations, and his Cough, Would drown the Sense, and make the Bigots laugh, To hear him mispronounce Old Eliazer, And read, perhaps, Bullbeggar for Belshazer. I cannot longer let you tread amiss, In following such an empty Guide as this. You must consider, since you marry'd are, Your Soul is now become your Husband's Care, And 'tis my Nuptial Duty to explode Your Female Errors and regard your Good; Therefore, I say, you must to Church repair, And learn the Holy Worship practis'd there: For when Experience makes you once more wise, You'll hug those Holy Things you now despise, And thank me then that I've redeem'd your Soul, From the vile Clutches of an ign'rant Owl. Wife. O! bless me, sure you will not serve me so, Must I to Mass and Purgatory go? I'll to no Popish painted Altar bow, Or kneel, then rise and stand I know not how: I'll not be tutor'd, catechiz'd, or taught, To Jabber like a Magpye, G?d knows what: The very Noise, I'm sure, would make me faint, No, no, I'll trust my Soul with Mr. Quaint, That godly Man, who loves and fears the Lord, That faithful Teacher of the Holy Word, Who, when he Preaches, or Expounds, or Prays, Tells, in plain English, what the Scripture says. I'll pin no Faith upon a High-Church Gown, Altho' my Body's yours, my Soul's my own; And, by the help of Grace, it ne'er shall be Seduc'd to such profane Idolatry: I'll still be steadfast, 'tis in vain to teaze, But you may hazard yours what way you please. Husband. If so resolv'd, it ought to be my Care To guard my Cash, and keep your Pockets bare, That no dissembling Pick-Purse shall command My Money, by my Wife's deceitful Hand: I'll have no Presents bought, no Guineas sent By Gossip Drill, to Rev'rend Master Cant: Nor shall he dare to thrust his Holy Snout Within my Doors, when told that I am out; For should a Servant in my House presume To give him entrance here, when I'm from Home, As soon as I'm inform'd I'll turn them off, And drive the Rebel hence with Kick and Cuff: Nor shall your self from Punishment go free, But, from that Hour, be under Lock and Key: And if I chance to catch the Pick thank here, Whisp'ring his Tales into your list'ning Ear, After I've thus his Company forbidden, I'll Geld him, as they do the Priests in Sweden. Wife. O! cruel Tyrant, would you seek his Blood, And make an Eunuch of a Man of God; I'll send him notice, that he ne'er may come Within your wicked Doors when you're at Home. Geld such a Holy Saint! O sinful Brute! Here's Persecution with a witness to't! The Lord protect him whereso'er he goes, And guard him from the Malice of his Foes. Bless me! that such a dreadful and profane Design should start into the Heart of Man. What has he done, good Soul, that he should lose What, I dare swear, he ne'er knew how to use, Not in a sinful manner I am sure, His Soul's too Righteous, and his Thoughts too Pure. By these your Threat'nings you too plainly show, What Malice High-Church bears against the Low, I'll swear I would not use a Jesuit so. However, Words nor Blows shall overcome me, I shall not fear what Man can do unto me, But will be steadfast in the Righteous way, In spite of all that you can do or say. Husband. Since you're so much concern'd that I should steal The Bandstrings of your Guides pretend Zeal, Which by the Female Tribe have oft been ty'd, And, for ought I know, by your self been try'd, I'll make a Vow ne'er to embrace you more, Till you your Saint and all his Tribe abjure, Unbedded and neglected shall you lie, Till with the true Church-Worship you comply, No more shall you the Nuptial Joy possess, But like a Widow spend your youthful Days; For she can ne'er Love truly, or obey, Whose wand'ring Soul seeks Heav'n a diff'rent way. Wife. O barb'rous Man to break his Marriage Troth, But pray, my Love, don't make so rash an Oath; Nay, prithee hush, for God's sake do not swear, Don't Vow and I'll do any thing, my Dear. Husband. Be then obedient to my Will, and leave Those Canting-Knaves, who labour to deceive, Who fright you from the Truth with odious Lies, And, thro' your Folly, make themselves seem wise; Encourage you to circumvent and cheat Your own, to make their Families more great; Wedlock our Souls as well as Bodies join, You therefore ought to venture yours with mine; If not, pray bid your Nuptial Sheets adieu, I'll have no Flesh but with the Spirit too. Wife. L?d! you're the strangest Man I ever knew, You are too rash, consider what you do: Methinks, my Dear, I am unwilling now We're marry'd, you should make so rash a Vow; I cannot lose your Love, or frame a Heart To dwell beneath one Roof, yet lie apart: Therefore, my Dear, don't aggravate my Sorrow, Bed me to Night, I'll go to Church to Morrow. Moral Reflexions on the foregoing Dialogue. [When Man and Wife pull diff'rent Ways] When Man and Wife pull diff'rent Ways, Thro' Consciencious scruple, Few peaceful Hours, or happy Days, Will bless that jarring Couple. The Churchman wedded to a Spouse, Who with the Saints engages, Must keep a Knave without his House At very large Board-Wages. For zealous Women who deride The Church, to follow Nonsense, Will cheat their Husbands to provide For him that guides their Conscience. So that 'tis Prudence in a Man, Whose Wife's of such a Humour, To bring her over if he can, Or keep his Money from her. For she that's full of Zeal and Pride, To much Devotion given, Thinks all too little for the Guide Who leads her Soul to Heaven. Therefore, my Friend, if you delight To marry and be easy, Pray leave the Holy Hypocrite, To match the Canting Nisey. Dialogue XXVIII. Between a young Libertine, and an old canting rich Widow, whom he had marry'd for her Money. Husband. Prithee, old Granny, hold thy jarring Tongue; Tho' you are old and toothless, I am young. Fill not my Ears with Noise, or Breast with Cares, But mind thy Brandy-Bottle, and thy Pray'rs. What, tho' I've warm'd thee in my Nuptial Sheets, And thaw'd thy frozen Limbs with joyful Heats, Must I not therefore to the Tavern stir, But thus be teaz'd with so much Chum and Chir? Forbear your Preaching, with your Cant have done; Sure, Mother Wife, you take me for your Son. Wife. I only do what ev'ry Woman shou'd, Advise a wicked Husband for his Good. Do you not ev'ry Day swear, game, and drink? What will become of your poor Soul, d'ye think? Do you not keep a Strumpet young and fair, In better Dress than I presume to wear? Treat the lewd Slut; and Coach the Trull about? Whilst I, alas! am glad to walk on Foot? Am I not forc'd to go to Church alone, Neglected by my Spouse, as if I'd none? Whilst you, perhaps, the Holy Sabbath waste In the vile Arms of some lascivious Beast. O fie! my Dear, what can you think will prove The sad Event of such unlawful Love? Body and Soul must for your Pleasure pay; And when you've squander'd your Estate away, The gaudy Snakes you have so oft embrac'd, Who help you to expend your Wealth so fast, Will triumph o'er your sad Decay at last. Husband. Such Doctrine from a Priest, is well enough; But from a Wife, 'tis very nauseous Stuff. What Man would mind the most authentick Truth, Spoke by a Magpy, or a Parrot's Mouth? Kind am'rous Lectures, from a Wife that's young, Delight the Ear, and well become the Tongue; But such long Sermons, and Reproofs as these, From an old Hag, are a confounded teaze; Such rev'rend Speeches, from a grizly Jade, Fitter for Witchcraft, than a Nuptial Bed, Can ne'er be pleasant to an airy Spouse, Too young for barren Joys, and wrinkl'd Brows. Wife. Fool that I was! O! curse the fatal Hour, In which I gave my Bags into your Pow'r; What fawning Protestations could you make, And Vows, to keep what now each Hour you break? Did you not swear, that I should always find Your Words respectful, and your Actions kind? But now, alas! your Flatt'ries have obtain'd My useful Wealth, my Person is disdain'd; My Age despis'd, my Nuptial Hopes buffoon'd; My Love but laugh'd at, and my Fortune ruin'd; And, because destitute of youthful Charms, Hateful my Bed, and nauseous are my Arms. Husband. Faith, Madam, if you'd know the real Truth, I can't join Lips with such a toothless Mouth; Which, like Pandora's Box, affords such Fumes, That smell of Death, and stink of rotten Gums. I cannot kiss, when you have done your Pray'rs, And your Cheeks clammy with repenting Tears: Or can I hug, when I have heard your Groans, A wither'd skinful of such mouldy Bones: Your Pains and Aches fright me from your Arms, I can't be tempted, where there are no Charms. Therefore, since you would be so vain, to buy So young a Spouse, when you were past the Joy, My Sins are chargeable on your sweet Tooth, Which, in your Age, had such a Lust to Youth: For who can, in his Prime and Vigour, wed A wither'd Relict, toothless and decay'd, And not, for Beauty's sake, defile his Marriage-Bed? Wife. O wicked Man! why would you then approve A Woman for your Wife, you could not love? If Age, that's destitute of Female Charms, Be so obnoxious to your younger Arms, My Failings could not, from your Eyes, be hid. The Faults you find, you in my Looks might read, Before your Flatt'ries brought me to agree To give you Title to my Wealth, and me. Why then would you so ill a Match pursue, To make me wretched, and your self so too? If you foresaw my fading Years would prove So great an Antidote to Nuptial Love, Why should you put on Nature such a Force, As to join Age for better and for worse? Therefore, since you, who knew me to be old, With all my Faults, would wed me for my Gold 'Tis barb'rous now to slight me, and despise My Age, for my foreseen Infirmities. Since I to make you happy, have resign'd My Wealth, you ought in Conscience to be kind; And not to waste that Riches which I brought On common Sluts, most scandalously naught: For since I gave you what you spend on them, The Donor ought to share in your Esteem; Because consider, Wretch, that 'tis my Gold Helps you to younger Flesh, tho' I am old. Husband. 'Tis true, your Age and Money are the Cause That I so oft transgress the Marriage-Laws: For who can bury'd lie in wither'd Arms, That wants no Wealth to purchase youthful Charms? If you, with rev'rend Furrows on your Brows, Would hazard all, to wed a strenuous Spouse, How can you think, that I should be content, I, who am youthful, and to Pleasures bent, To waste my Days, and fool away my Nights, With a dry Skeleton, past Love's Delights? If frozen Age, i'th' Winter of Decay, On a young Mate would fling her Wealth away, Pray how can such a Wife, with Justice, blame A youthful Husband, when he does the same? For if Love's Appetite will prove so strong In aged Veins, who have enjoy'd it long, Well may the Brisk and Youthful run astray, Since old decrepid Letchers shew the Way! Wife. Men always frame a plausible Excuse For lawless Freedoms they are prone to use. The Wicked their Evasions never want; The Villain labours to be thought a Saint; And if detected, slily casts the Blame On others, that himself may shun the Shame. Those who the worst of Villanies pursue, Still plead Necessity for what they do; And ev'ry common Prostitute, pretends She sins for want of Money, or of Friends; When 'tis alone their Lust, for Want of Grace, That spurs them forward to be lewd and base. So you would make my barren Age, the Cause Why you offend, and break good Heaven's Laws; When your own sinful Appetites mislead Your wav'ring Heart to wrong your Marriage Bed. Husband. Prithee, old Woman, hold thy teazing Tongue; Thou'rt ancient, and forget that I am young. Would you remember, when with Beauty arm'd, How ev'ry Lover's kiss your Fancy warm'd; How brisk and gay, how frolicksome you were, When youthful, pleasant, forward, kind, and fair; What subtle Arts you've us'd to win a Spark; And how you've wish'd to meet him in the Dark; How close you kiss'd; what Pleasures you have stole; And what strange Things he did to charm your Soul; How you first nibbl'd at the tempting Hook, In spite of all the Care your Mother took; How you thought this the sweetest Man alive; Yet would, next day, some new Intrigue contrive; What Vows, with Reservations, you have made; How many you have lov'd; what Fools betray'd: How oft you wrong'd your Husband in your Youth; What Lies you told, yet vow'd them to be Truth; What Stratagems you form'd; what strange Fatigues You run thro', to accomplish your Intrigues; What plausible Excuses you would coin, To cheat the Fool, and manage your Design. Would you but recollect such Things as these, And think on all your past Enormities, You would not then so great a Wonder make At all those youthful Liberties I take; But say, my Dear, I own it is no more, Than I my self, when young, have done before. Wife. O wicked Man! to harbour such a Thought! What , do you think I, in my Youth, was naught? O fie! my Dear, such Censure only shews, The wicked Muse of others, as they use. Husband. Prithee, I know you're made of Female Mold, Am'rous when young, and penitent when old; Therefore I'll leave you to your Pray'rs and Tears, Fit Recreations for your rev'rend Years. But I from Tavern must to Tavern strole, Where sparkling Wine revives my drooping Soul; And Boon-Companions o'er the Bottle meet, To chear the Heart, and exercise their Wit. Therefore, old Grannum, let us thus agree; I'll drink for you, and you shall pray for me. Moral Reflexions on the foregoing Dialogue. [What Youth of either Sex, whilst warm] What Youth of either Sex, whilst warm With Love and active Vigour, Tho' brib'd, is able to conform To Age, and all its Rigour? Wealth cannot ballance the Delights Of Bacchus, and of Venus; When Beauty Charms, or Wine invites, Our Vertue shrinks within us. Old Mothers, with their bug-bear Tales, May make their Daughters tremble; Yet Nature, when they're ripe, prevails, And then the Sluts dissemble. All their external modest Shews Of Piety and Vertue, Are but the cunning Ways they use (My am'rous Friend) to court you. Nor can the Letcher, old and dry, That weds a youthful Beauty, By Money, Padlock, Bolt, or Spy, Oblige her to her Duty. What crazy Hag can then expect A young Man such a Bubble, That he should Beauty's Charms neglect, To gratify old Stubble? Dialogue XXIX. Between an old, prodigal, new-sworn Constable and his young noisy Wife, concerning his Power and Authority. Husband. Wife hold your Tongue, your noisy Nonsense cease, Take Notice, Huzzy, I command the Peace; By Vertue of this Staff, whereon you see The painted Arms of pow'rful Majesty, Altho' a Man, I represent the Queen; 'Tis true, you prating Minx, for all you grin; Therefore, when, with an awful Voice, I say, Do this, you ought to Court'sey and obey. Wife. Marry-come-up, you represent the Queen! You doating Ass, pray tell me but wherein, Take care you are not whipp'd from Gate to Gate, For talking Treason at so vile a Rate, It happens well there is no other by, To hear you prate so like a Fool, but I, You're a fine Fellow, with that Roman Nose, Between a wrinkl'd Pair of Lanthorn Jaws, Anatomiz'd by Age, to Skin and Bone, To represent a Queen upon the Throne; Besides, you silly Oaf, what Man alive Can be a Woman's Representative, Tho', I confess, your Kindness is so rare, I scarce remember which o'th' two you are; Yet, I am sure, 'tis Impudence in you To talk of Queens as you presume to do. Husband. Huzzy, I say, what I assert is right, And more than that, I'm Monarch of the Night, Can Stop, Command, Examine, Loll in ease, And, like a King, Imprison whom I please; Exert my Sov'reign Pow'r as Cause appears, And Nod, attended by my Halberteers. There's Honour for a Wife, to Bed in State With such a high and mighty Magistrate; For tho' I govern by the Staff I bear, Yet you are Madam Constable, my Dear. Wife. I must confess, to warm your wither'd Hide Is a great Honour to your younger Bride, Much Joy and Credit to a Wife redounds, From such a Skinful of disabl'd Bones; The gouty Leader of a scabby Crew Of louzy tatter'd Scrubs, you know not who, Arm'd with long Staves, because the bearded Rout Are too infirm and lame to walk without; Old, frowzy, croaking Sots, who live and feed On Brandy, foggy Ale, and stinking Weed, And smell as Rank, within your Parish-Hut, As an old hunted Fox, or stable Goat; A Train as fit as you could well desire, To guard their Monarch by his Watch-house Fire, Who Nods and Slumbers in your Elbow-Chair, Till waken'd with the Call of, Who comes there? Then in, before your Staff, perhaps, is brought Some stroling Slut, or inoffensive Sot, Who wanting Coin to give your Watch a Fee, To Cage or Counter must committed be, That the next Day you may have some pretence To fleece 'em, tho' they're guiltless of Offence: Your midnight Majesty, that does these things, Much Honour home to me, your Consort, brings; I must have much Felicity, besure, In sleeping at the Back of so much Pow'r, So full of Belch, Pride, Vanity, and Wind, That ev'ry Night you break the Peace behind, Disturb my Rest from Twelve a Clock to Four, As if your A?se had learn'd to croak the Hour: I therefore wish it was your Worship's Fate, To Nod much oft'ner in your Chair of State, For I must own I always sleep the best, When you're abroad disturbing others rest. Husband. You prating Huzzy, I should serve you right, To put you in the Stocks, but that 'tis Night. How dare you give me one provoking Word? I'd have you know, I can commit a Lord; Therefore you'd best to regulate your Tongue, That wicked Member that's so loosely hung, Or when I'm angry I shall make you see, What 'tis to aggravate Authority. I ought to keep the Peace where e'er I come, Not only thro' the Parish, but at home, And how, alas, should I preserve the same, If aw'd by th'Clamour of my noisy Dame? No, you pert Huzzy, you shall see, e're long, I'll find a way to stop your noisy Tongue, Or by this Staff, which in my hand I hold, I'll have you Coram Nobis for a Scold, And then how like a shame fac'd whining Fool, You'll look, when leading to the Ducking Stool. Wife. You have me Coram Nob, you ugly Dog; You lead me to be duck'd, you lousy Rogue; You have me punish'd for a Scold, you Brute; When is't I Quarrel, Wrangle or Dispute? Sirrah, 'tis your ill Tongue begins the Strife, The Neighbours know that I'm a patient Wife, An honest Woman, you provoking Owl, Too good for you, for all you're Constable, Jack in a Parish-Office, proud to be The Scum of troublesome Authority, Pleas'd with a painted Staff, advanc'd to fright Vagrants by Day, and drunken Sots by Night; But don't you think my inoffensive Tongue Shall truckle to your Short one, or your Long, I have no Cause to fear a painted Stick, I nothing say but what a Wife should speak, And what an honest Husband ought to hear For all he's climb'd into his Elbow Chair; Therefore I'll talk what's proper to a Fool, In spite of painted Staff or Ducking-Stool; I'll not be call'd a Scold, I know I'm none, But since your self this diff'rence has begun, I'll make you eat your Words before I've done. Husband. You silly angry Wasp, I meant no hurt, I only Jested for a little Sport, Tho' some would think that now you Scold and Rave, I know its nothing but a way you have; Suppose you were a noisy Scold indeed, As bad as Gammar Douse, or Mother Reed, And I had pow'r to duck you, by my Life, I'd scorn to so misuse so good a Wife; Why should not Woman, when she's vex'd, be free To vent her Mind sometimes as well as we? For Men have Failings, very great ones too, Nor can I boast that I have less than you. However, you should now consider, Love, That I'm a Magistrate, a Man above The common Rank, and you should therefore be Obedient now to my Authority; Do as I bid you, mind whate'er I say, 'Twill be your own, my Dear, another day. Wife. What a Rout's here about a nasty Office, Daily conferr'd on ev'ry whiffling Novice; Besides you're but Jack-hold-my-staff at best, Hir'd by a wiser Man, that loves his Rest, Who scorns to leave a Wife that's young and fair, To nod at Midnight in a wooden Chair, And quit the pleasures of his Nuptial Bed, To be a louzy Rabble's brainless Head. The surly Leader of a croaking Train Of Rogues, beneath the Dignity of Men, Scoundrels, to Infamy and Baseness bent, Who make more Mischief than you all prevent; Therefore you'd need be proud of such a Post, And of your upright painted Bauble boast; A Staff by which the Poor are oft opprest, And fits a busie Coxcomb's Hand the best, But I'll not stoop or yield one Jot the more, For your tall Gugaw, I defy your Pow'r, And dare advance, for th'Honour of the Coif, The handle of my Broom against your Staff; And if you further vex me, fairly try Whose Weapon is of most Authority. Husband. Prithee, my Dear, don't let us Jest so long Till we fall out, for that would quite be wrong; My Duty is to quell all rising Jars, And not to aggravate Domestick Wars; Therefore, I beg you, let our Discords cease, I'm bound, I tell you, to preserve the Peace: For many Nuptial Quarrels have arose, From Jest to Earnest, and from Words to Blows; I vow I'm sorry if I spoke amiss, I did not think it would have grown to this. Come, come, let's have a Kiss, that always ends The Feuds 'twixt Man and Wife, and makes them Friends. Well, that was kind, I hate to see thee frown; Now all is over, prithee, lends my Gown, 'Tis late, I to the Watch-house must repair, It's past Eleven a Clock, good Night my Dear. Moral Reflexions on the foregoing Dialogue. [The Man that's troubl'd with a Wife] The Man that's troubl'd with a Wife That's given much to Jangling, Must oft submit, to ease his Life, Or else he always Wrangling. For Wives, tho' Doctors do affirm They're Cold of Constitution, Yet when they're vex'd they're very warm In Tongue and Resolution. Patience is better far than Force, For when the stubborn Grey-Mare Is bent to prove the better Horse, No Oaken Plant can tame her. It is of no Effect to boast His Power or his Riches, All Arguments and Means are lost On Wives that wear the Breeches. What tho' the angry Fool should fight, Controul her and Fatigue her, All he can do's but washing white The Ethiopian Negro. Therefore approve what e'er she says, Commend, but never blame her, He's wise that gives a Scold her ways, For nothing will reclaim her. Dialogue XXX. Between the forgiving Husband, and the penitent Adulteress. Husband. My dear Lavinia, once the only Joy Of my kind Soul, and Charmer of my Eye, Ease of my Cares, and Pleasure of my Bed, In whom alone I once was happy made; The Object of my Love, the only She, Whose Welfare was my chief Felicity: But now, alas! thy Beauties are declin'd, Which, undefil'd, with so much Lustre shin'd; And all those sweet Angelick Graces lost, Which none but faithful Innocence can boast. O! how could such a Heav'nly Face and Mein, By Human Flatt'ries, be seduc'd to sin! And with Man's lustful Rhetorick be charm'd, To fall a Victim, when so well fore-arm'd, And in one Moment, destitute of Grace, Stain with Dishonour so divine a Face! But, O! by sad Experience now I find Fair Looks are no true Index of the Mind; And that soft Beauty we so much adore, Tho' with such tempting Graces varnish'd o'er, Does oft, like luscious Fruits, prove rotten at the Core. Wife. Forgive me, Dear, and ease a Wretch's Pain, Thou best of Husbands, and the best of Men. O! let my Tears and Penitence attone For the sad Ills I have so rashly done; Pity the Sorrows of a sinful Breast, Loaded with Grief, too great to be exprest. 'Tis true, I have been faithless and unkind, Deaf to good Counsel, to my Duty blind, Perverse, unruly, to my Ruin prone, Forgetful of your Honour, and my own: But, could unfeign'd Repentance re-obtain Your Nuptial Love, and wash away my Stain, From this sad Hour I would my Life renew, Abhor the Guilt, in Pray'rs devoutly true Implore the Mercy of good Heav'n and you. Husband. O! that frail Woman should such Charms possess, Unarm'd with Vertue, and uncrown'd with Grace, And that such Beauty should be left to stray, For want of Prudence, to consult the Way; But harder still, that injur'd Man should bear Part of the Shame, who'as in the Guilt no share. How then, Lavinia, can your Spouse forgive, Who for your Pleasures, does such Pains receive? Your Crime's too black, and bears too deep a Dye, Too bad for injur'd Man to pass it by. It's true, the Goodness which the Gods extend, May meet your Pray'rs, their Mercy knows no End; Nor can our Failings interrupt their Ease, They're not disturb'd with our Enormities. Therefore, when Mortals do their Sins repent, Heav'n may forgive what Humane Nature can't. Wife. Should I capitulate at such a Time, 'Twould swell my Guilt, and aggravate my Crime. Offenders, when they're cast, and Mercy need, May be allow'd to pray, but not to plead. Detected Guilt will no Disputes admit, 'Tis Favour to be suffer'd to entreat. Therefore, since all Excuse must be forborn, I only beg you'll give me leave to mourn; And that my humble Sighs and Tears may move Your Pity, tho' I've forfeited your Love. Husband. 'Tis true, the Guilty have no other way To obtain Mercy, but to weep and pray. Sorrow's the best Return that can be paid, Where Restitution is not to be made: Yet Show'rs of Tears, alas! are but a small Attonement for a Crime so capital, Whose sad Effects the injur'd Breast must feel, As long as Mem'ry can survive the I'll. Such monst'rous Crimes whole Families torment, Beyond Forgiveness of the Penitent. Who then can pardon an Offence so great, Which Time cannot repair, or Man forget? An ignominious Blot, that stains so home, 'Twill blacken Generations still to come; Make your own Children, when they chance to hear Their Mother's Failings grate upon their Ear; Dissolve their Duty, doubt their lawful Birth, And curse the vicious Womb that brought 'em forth. What Husband then can smother an Offence Attended with such dreadful Consequence? Wife. O! base and wretched Woman, that I am, Most justly doom'd to Misery and Shame; Nor can I call you cruel or unkind, Since I've deserv'd worse Usage than I find. O! that I could but reach some lonely Place, Where I might ever hide my blushing Face; Or to some unfrequented Desart run, Untrod by Man, ungilded by the Sun; There be compell'd for ever to reside With Brutes less savage than a faithless Bride. For what base Wife, tho' she has stain'd her Charms, Can bear Exclusion from her Husband's Arms, And live unpity'd, slighted, and contemn'd, By her best Lover, and her surest Friend? O! lend your Sword, that I may ease my Breast, And send my poor distracted Soul to rest, That at one Thrust I may my Grief remove, And pierce that Heart which has betray'd your Love. Tho' my own Ills my Happiness have crost, Yet thrown from you, I am entirely lost. O! who can live a poor discarded Wife? Death is less Terror, than so base a Life. Husband. What Pow'r has faithless Beauty in her Tears? How Guilt withdraws, when Penitence appears? You know, Lavinia, once I lov'd you well, Nor has your Crimes yet chang'd my Heart to Steel; I cannot hear you so much Grief express, But still must pity your Unhappiness: I own, Lavinia; I'm a little mov'd To ease that Heart I once so dearly lov'd. Could I forget, methinks I could forgive; But Crimes like yours, will still unbury'd live; In the most patient Bosom knawing lie, And, like the Worm of Conscience, never die. Wife. My dearest Husband, O! thou God-like Man, Could you one Thought of Pardon entertain, My Love, Obedience, and my pious Life, Should shew I was become so good a Wife; That, by my future Penitence, I'd blast The odious Mem'ry of my Follies past; Perform my Duty with such humbie Care, That not one Action of my Life should err; So that we both should bless the happy Time Your Goodness pardon'd, O! my hated Crime; My chaste Deportment, should in Time persuade Your peaceful Breast, that I have never stray'd. Thus the deep Sense of my Misfortunes past, Shall make me always Kind, and always Chaste. But if your Heart be harden'd, and your Ears Are deaf to my repenting Cries and Tears; If so severe, O! miserable me! I'm lost, and must for ever wretched be. Husband. Such heav'nly Promises, and such a Flood Of falling Tears, are not to be withstood: Such penitential Drops of liquid Gems, More rich than Pearl on Princes Diadems, Must bribe a Soul so lenitive as mine, And make my Heart more sorrowful than thine. My dear Lavinia, you have charm'd my Breast, Forc'd me to yield to ev'ry soft Request, The Vows that flow from your melodious Tongue, Compel me to forgive the greatest Wrong. Who can such kind and mournful Accents hear From so much Beauty, and be still severe? What dire Revenge upon the worst Offence, Is able to withstand such Penitence? Tho' thy past Liberties deserve my Scorn, I cannot, without Pity, hear thee mourn. I must forgive thee.—From the Ground arise, Comfort thy Breast, and dry thy flowing Eyes; And let the future Conduct of thy Life Shew thee a thankful and obedient Wife: For Crimes repeated after Pardon given, Deserve from Man no Mercy, or from Heav'n. Wife. O! best of Husbands, be for ever blest. May my past Folly ne'er disturb your Breast; But from this Time remain a cancel'd Blot, Unthought of as the Child that's unbegot. O! how shall I reward your gen'rous Mind, To Patience, Love, and Mercy thus inclin'd? By what kind Measures shall I strive to shew The Gratitude to so much Goodness due? O! help me Heaven, to improve my Charms, That I each Night may doubly bless his Arms, And yield him such Enjoyments, when embrac'd, That Human Nature ne'er before could taste. May I that kind and lovely Creature be, That with his Wishes may the best agree; Always obliging, diligent, and meek; And may my Words be Musick when I speak, That I may charm his Soul with new Delights, And make his Days as happy as his Nights. My dearest Husband, you shall find me prove A faithful Blessing to your future Love; An humble Wife, whose Vertues shall attone. For all the Wrongs my foolish Youth has done, No Pow'r on Earth shall tempt one Thought awry; The Wiles of Men and Devils I'll defy, And on your Love for evermore rely. Husband. Like your sweet Looks, your Promises are fair: But still such Charms as yours must have a Care; Depend not on your Strength, 'tis Grace alone Must guard you, if attack'd, from being won. Woman, by Nature, subject is to change, Too eas'ly tempted, and inclin'd to range; Therefore, by humble Pray'rs, make Heav'n your friend, Without, no Vertue can itself defend. The Gods alone must guard you from the Fate That does so oft on female Beauty wait: Implore their Aid, your Follies past lament, And I'll forgive and love, tho' I repent: For how can Man, that seeks Revenge below, Of Heav'n ask Mercy, if he none will show? Wife. O pious Man! how greatly am I bless'd, To hear such Love and Lenity express'd, When the base Wrongs, which now I truly mourn, Deserve no less than Infamy and Scorn? Had your Resentments your Compassion sowr'd, And your Revenge your Vertues over-power'd, How wretched had I been, involv'd in all The Mis'ries that could curse a Woman's Fall? But since, O gen'rous Suff'rer, thou hast sav'd A sinful Wife, polluted and deprav'd, With all Abhorrence I my Crimes abjure, And date my happy Life from this good Hour; Will, for the future, Vertue's Paths pursue, And prove for ever just to Heaven and you. Husband. Tho' your unhappy Crimes my Love have crost, 'Tis pity so much Beauty should be lost. I must be kind to thy repenting Charms, And hug my dear Lavinia in my Arms. All that I now can ask, is, that you'll prove Futurely faithful, to reward my Love; Therefore be good and just, that I may see Forgiveness mends beyond Severity. Wife. The gen'rous Pity you have thus bestow'd, Inspires my humble Soul with all that's good. After such Mercy, I can ne'er offend So kind a Husband, and so true a Friend; But shall my Thoughts and Actions strictly bind, To Vertue's happy Rules, that you shall find Your Pardon, to the Comfort of our Lives, Has made a worthless Wretch, the best of Wives. Moral Reflexions on the foregoing Dialogue. [How happy is that God-like Man] How happy is that God-like Man, Who can forgive Offences, And wink at such an odious Stain, That startles human Senses? The nuptial Treach'ry of the Fair, Tho' nothing grows more common; Yet it is hard for Man to bear Such Usage from a Woman. Adultery! the very Name Is hateful to the Guilty; The wanton Dame is stabb'd with Shame, Whene'er she's thought so filthy. When once detected in a Wife, It proves the Bane of Wedlock; And she that loves it, ought for Life To wear a publick Padlock: But if she turns from Bad to Good, And mends her ill Behaviour, 'Tis hard repenting Beauty shou'd Be cast away for ever. Therefore, when Wives their Weakness shew, Pass not too harsh a Sentence, But pardon Wrongs upon their due Submission and Repentance. Dialogue XXXI. Between a rich Sea Captain and his young beautiful buxom Lady after six Months Marriage. Wife. You say you Love me, and admire my Charms, And place your greatest Blessings in my Arms; Why will you triumph then o'er Love and Ease, T'embrace the Dangers of the doubtful Seas, And leave me in my tender years, to mourn Your Absence, and despair of your Return, Forsake what you avow you most esteem, To pile up Riches to a vain extreme. Husband. My Love, dear Child, I cannot but assert, I own your Charms ride Adm'ral o'er my Heart, 'Tis for your sake that I expose my Life, If I survive you'll be the happier Wife; Wealth is the only sure Support that bears From human Life the weight of Marriage Cares, Which else might crush our Fondness now we're wed, And spoil the Pleasures of our nuptial Bed; For Love and Friendship, tho' confirm'd for years, Always withdraw when Poverty appears. Wife. Were we in danger that approaching Want Should cool our Love, your Argument I'd grant; But you have Wealth enough to live at ease, And may on Shore be happy if you please: Nor was the Fortune which my Father paid Too small to keep me, had I liv'd a Maid; I had no Cause to change my Virgin State T'indulge my Pride, and to appear more Great, I'd all the Comforts of a Maiden Life, Before I knew what 'twas to be a Wife: I marry'd not for Riches, but to prove, By sweet experience, the Delights of Love: And now the pleasing Secret I have known, 'Tis hard I should be left to Sigh alone. Husband. Consider, Love, the Wars have been my Friend, All I possess have on the Seas been gain'd; And since my Country, who have giv'n me Bread, Approve my Service, and require my Aid, It must be deem'd Ingratitude to slight The Nations Welfare for a Wife's delight: Such tame uxorious Folly would appear The Effects of dastard Jealousy and Fear; As if the Charms that grac'd your blooming Youth, Caus'd me, when absent, to distrust your Truth; Or that I had postpon'd, to my disgrace, The Publick Safety to a Wife's Embrace. No, no, when Fame does in the Front appear, Love should be always posted in the Rear. I own I place much Happiness in you, Yet cannot bid the jarring Seas adieu, My Ship's the older Mistress of the two. Wife. Had I, alas, foreseen my youthful Charms, Could not have fix'd you to my tender Arms, But that you would have taken still more Pride In your sham Kingdom, than a faithful Bride, And in a wand'ring Castle spent your Life, Instead of Anch'ring with a steadfast Wife, He should have only joy'd in my Embrace, Who'd lov'd me better, and his Honour less; For I'm too young and airy to approve Of fruitless Absence, or Platonick Love. Husband. Absence renews the Matrimonial Bond, And makes the happy Nuptial Pair more fond; It tries how far they're truly just and kind, And proves the Strength and Vertues of the Mind, Doubles their am'rous Ardour when they meet, Comforts their days, and makes their Lives more sweet. So the sharp Winter, tho' it seems severe, It makes the soothing Spring more gay appear: Thus after Cold less sharper Air seems warm, And a fresh Gale a Calm behind a Storm. Wife. But I, my Dear, am Amorous and Young, My Appetite's too keen to fast so long, I cannot starve my Love, six Months at least, On the bare Promise of a doubtful Feast; For should my Vertue conquer my Desires And bear the want of what my Youth requires, You may return disabl'd from the Wars Crippl'd with wounds, and maim'd with Honour's scars, Then what amends can your poor Wife expect For her long Patience, under cold neglect. Husband. Your Modesty that Question might have spar'd, For Vertue always is its own Reward. A Wife is bound in Duty to be Just, She's infamous that breaks her Nuptial Trust, 'Tis her own Safety to be Chaste and Good, She's always wretched from the time she's lewd: Nor will the absence of her Spouse excuse Th'adult'rous Freedoms that a Wife shall use; There's no Condition in the Nuptial tye, To favour Woman if she treads awry, Tho' she for absent years lives unembrac'd, The solemn Vow should still preserve her chaste. Wife. But he that steps into a marry'd Life, Should forsake all to cleave unto his Wife; And not like you prefer a hostile Chase Of Honour to her kind and soft Embrace. If you, when no Necessity requires, Leave me alone to please your vain Desires, 'Tis you that first the Marriage Vow transgress, And, by your Absence, tempt me to be base: I am not safe, of Nuptial Joys debar'd, A Husband's Presence is a Woman's Guard; I'm Young, and in your Absence cannot tell, How far (alas) Temptation may prevail. A youthful Bride forsaken in her Bloom, Will be attack'd, and may be overcome; Meer pity will excite the young and kind, To storm her Vertue and inflame her Mind; And what fair she, unguarded in her Prime, Can stand the warm Assaults of Love and Time? Stay you at Home, and that's the only way To make a Wife, Love, Honour, and Obey; Then free from Fears and Dangers, shall I be, Happy in you, and you secure in me; But if to rove the Seas you're rashly bent, I know not what may prove the cross Event; Long absence may a youthful Bride provoke, And strong Resolves be in a Moment broke. Husband. Methinks, my Dear, you are too plain and free, Your Tongue exceeds the bounds of Modesty. If now you're wed your Vertue proves so weak, You cannot bear my Absence, lest you break Your solemn Vow of Wedlock, to fulfil The craving warmth of your Salacious Will; You give me Reasons to believe from thence, I ne'er embrac'd your Virgin Innocence, But that you first impos'd upon my Bed, Th'experienc'd Charms of a polluted Maid; For if when single you could bear Restraint, 'Tis strange your Vertue should be now so faint: If you could then resist a Man's Embrace, Why in my Absence must you needs transgress, Since now you know, what you before must be Inclin'd to taste, thro' meer Curiosity. Wife. Had I ne'er known the Bliss I find so great, But still continu'd in my Virgin State, I should have been content without the Joy, For those that never drink are ne'er adry, Nor did I ever Sin to basely know The pleasures that from Man's embraces flow; You are the only he, by mighty Jove, That ever gave me the delights of Love; My Virgin Blush in your embrace was lost, No Arms but yours that Happiness can boast, Nor do I say, if from my Breast you fly, That some new Rival shall your place supply; Nor durst I on my Female strength depend, The stoutest Vertue may by chance offend; Especially should your Affections stray, Or your long Absence clear the pleasing way, For she that's ne'er so Coy may be betray'd By strong Attacks, if opportunely made; For Woman, tho' well fortify'd within, Yet Love has Bombs to fire her Magazine; And tho' in her Defence she's ne'er so warm, She may be won by Treachery or Storm. Husband. Must I, Slave-like, be fetter'd by your Charms, And bury all my Glory in your Arms? Must I renounce an active noble Life, To dwell, like a tame Cuckold, with a Wife? Abandon Honour, and forsake the Seas, Surfeit with Plenty, and be chain'd to Ease, Grow sick of Beauty, weary of Delight, Drink down the Day, and snoar away the Night? Be a dull Wretch, to drowsy Sloth inur'd, And live confin'd, 'twixt Marriage Walls immur'd? Thrive, like a Crab-louse, on the Brink of Love, Till grown too Fat and Corpulent to move? Attend the Christ'nings of a squalling Brood, Whose Veins, perhaps, are fill'd with spurious Blood? Drink to the Parson, tattle to the Wives, With costly Bowls renew their drooping Lives, And smile to hear 'em wonder how the Infant thrives. Walk with my Lady in my Hand abroad, To visit this sly Jilt, that private Bawd? And thus, to please a subtle Wife, become An Instrument of my own Cuckoldom. Not I, by all the Sea-Gods in the Deep, I'm born to Rove, and not at Home to sleep: If you're too Free and Buxom to contain Your self, whilst I in triumph plow the Main, E'en take your fill, be Wanton as you please, My Ship shall be my Bride, our Bed the Seas; There will we toss and tumble thro' the Waves, Whilst I bear Rule and Triumph o'er my Slaves. Wife. My Dear, since I to my Affliction find, No Female Arts can change your steady Mind, But that I'm doom'd to so severe a Fate, As to live Single in a Nuptial State, Believe me, 'twas my Love, and nothing more, Made me implore your Residence on Shore, And take the freedom to alarm your Breast, With what my Youth and Innocence detest; In hopes thereby to make you quit the Seas, And, free from Danger, live at Home in Ease; That you may truly know how much I love, And what a kind, obedient Wife I'd prove: But since no Female Threats will awe your Soul, Or soft Entreaties your Resolves controul, Pray be assur'd, no Distance shall abate My Love, or tempt me to those Ills I hate: I have to Vertue all my Life been bred, Both Fear and Scorn to stain my Nuptial-Bed. Sin I abhor, and dread the impious Shame That waits on Female Lust, that odious flame: Nor should the Indies win me, or a Throne, To prostitute those Charms you've made your own; Therefore, believe me, whilst on Seas you dwell, Fix'd as the Northern-Star by which you Sail, And that no human Pow'r shall e'er remove My Thoughts from you, my only Orb of Love: Pious I'll live, and Constant will I be, With heav'nly Thoughts I'll charm the raging Sea, Pray for your safe Return, and hope you'll think of me. Husband. These Resolutions from so kind a Wife, Revive my Soul, and crown my happy Life. Be Chaste at Home, and I'll Abroad be Brave, And thou the Honour of my Deeds shalt have. Moral Reflexions on the foregoing Dialogue. [Whoever takes into his Arms] Whoever takes into his Arms A young and buxom Bride, All over Beauty, Love, and Charms, And leaves her when enjoy'd, Ought to expect, when once she knows What 'tis to be embrac'd, That to some Rival she'll dispose Of what's beneath her Waste. Good Wives may vertuous be, I'll grant, Whilst in their Husband's Pow'r, But in their Absence few will want The Joys they marry'd for. No Maid her Freedom would resign, For an obeying Life, Did not her panting Breast incline To th'Pleasures of a Wife. 'Tis hard the lovely Dame should wed A Rover of the Seas, Who, when he's cloy'd, forsakes her Bed, And robs her of her Ease. If she the Nuptial Blessing loves And pines for his Embrace, The truer to his Bed she proves The harder is her Case. Dialogue XXXII. Between an old Country Couple, in the Winter of their Age, concerning the Disobedience of their Children, &amp;c. Husband. Here take away the Beef and Cale, And fill the Goblet full of Ale; Bring me my Pipe, sit down, my Dear, And draw thy Wicker-Chair more near; Lay on another Block or two, I'm cold, and so, I fear, are you. Wife. I am not over warm, be sure; Jug, prithee shut the Parlour-Door; We're in the Winter of our Age, And sliding off this worldly Stage; Our frozen Nerves, alas, require Good Liquor, and a thawing Fire, That may our icy Clay revive, And make us know that we're alive, Else, we but sleep our Time away, Like Insects in a Winter's Day. Husband. Thou'rt in the right, I must allow, We're but Memento Mori's now, Mere walking Skeletons, to shew What Youth, in time, must come unto: Despis'd by all the young and gay, Who fleer and scoff at our Decay; Slighted by Children of our own, Who think 'tis time that we were gone, That they might waste, in worldly Pleasure, What thee and I have scrap'd together. Wife. Therefore, since we're become the Scorn Of those who of my Womb were born, And that they wish us in the Grave, For the small Riches which we have, 'Tis time that we take care, my Dear, To be each others Comforter; And that we wisely keep our Store, Now past our Labour, in our Pow'r, And not relinquish what's our own, To gratify a craving Son, Or Daughter, to depend, now old, On more uncertain Friends than Gold. No, no, hold fast your Wealth, I say, 'Tis a sure safeguard in decay: If once you part with that, you'll find Repentance follows close behind: You see what Slights our Children show, How surly and morose they grow On all Occasions how they flout us, Now they can scarce subsist without us: Therefore should we at once resign To them our friendly Bags of Coin, And on their Gratitude depend For Raiment, Food, and all we spend, What Usage then can we expect But moody Frowns and cold Neglect, Provoking Snarls and little Ease, Amidst our weak Infirmities: Then let's be wise in what we give, And save, that we our selves may live Without depending on the Aid Of those that long have wish'd us dead. Husband. I'll take thy honest Counsel, Wife, I know our Children grutch us Life, And long to see us safely laid In Nature's last, but easy Bed, Where all that are, or are to be, Must come in time, as well as we, And mighty Kings, who now sit high, With Beggars undistinguish'd lie. Alas! what Comforts can we find, Now old, besides a peaceful Mind, And Wealth sufficient, that may be Our Guard against Necessity; The latter does the first preserve, No Man can be Content and Starve; No Sage Philosopher secure A quiet Breast, if Old and Poor. I, therefore, like what you advise, 'Tis Wealth alone makes Age seem Wise, And not our Wrinkles, but our Pence, That gain Respect and Reverence. Wife. The greater Reason still we have To keep what we have toil'd to save, That now we're Ancient we may be Secure from helpless Poverty. Unhappy those that do depend, When Old, upon a Child or Friend. 'Tis hard, my Dear, we should be taught, Now Aged, how to Eat, and what; Rudely directed where to sit, And caution'd how we Smoak or Spit; Be fearful to disclose our Wants, And teaz'd with the imperious Taunts Of some proud Minx our Son shall wed, Who'll think we are too nicely fed, And ne'er be easy till we're dead. Husband. Therefore the way to live at ease, And spend our aged Days in Peace, Is still to keep what we possess And not, by giving, make it less: 'Tis better that our Children wait Till we are dead, for our Estate, Than that we should resign the same, And then turn Pensioners to them. Whilst in our Hands we keep the Staff, And they depend on us, we're safe, Our own paternal Love we know Is great, and will continue so; But filial Duty in a Son Is not to be rely'd upon; Age may be fond of Youth, we see, But Youth with Age, can ne'er agree: When e'er they buckle and obey, Or humour us in what we say, They only seemingly comply, In hopes, at last, to gain thereby, And coax and flatter us, for fear We should bestow our Wealth elsewhere: Therefore 'tis fit our Brood depends On us, who are their faithful Friends; Not we on them, who only want To gain what we have Pow'r to grant, Which if we part with whilst we're living, They'll make us soon repent our giving. Wife. Children, we know, affect their Pleasure, And sooth their Parents for their Treasure: But who can blame 'em, since we find, That all are to the same inclin'd; Money, we see, commands the Great, The Wisest nibble at the Bait; Yet, tho' 'tis lov'd by Young and Old, For Pleasure still they barter Gold, And, by their Lives, let others see The World is all but Vanity: Therefore since Money bears the sway, And all Delights its Pow'r obey, Let us, whilst we have Life, take care To save enough, that we may bear Our Charges to our Journey's end, Without the help of Child or Friend; For wretched must those Parents be, Who feel the smart of Poverty, And for Subsistance must rely Upon their Childrens Charity. Moral Reflexions on the foregoing Dialogue. [No Parent is oblig'd to starve] No Parent is oblig'd to starve, To please a craving Son or Daughter, First let's be careful to preserve Our selves when Old, our Children alter. For he that parts with all his Gold, Or Lands, without a Reservation, To bless his Issue, may, when Old, Repent his liberal Donation. 'Tis true, the wealthy Father ought To make a suitable Provision For his own Brood, and grant 'em what. May place them in a blest Condition. But he that gives his Children all, And on their Curtesy relies, Will fare but ill, and surely shall Repent his Folly e're he dies. FINIS.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The Second Volume. DIALOGUE I. Between a Great Man Sentenc'd to the Scaffold, and his Vertuous Lady at their last parting. Lord. Good Heav'n support thee in this flood of Grief, And give thy Breast some adequate Relief, Comfort thy Soul, in thinking we e're long Shall meet above, where none can do us wrong: Consider all Mankind must stoop to Fate, We're bound to pass the Adamantine Gate. No Prince one Moment is secure of Breath, All are born Subjects to that Tyrant Death. 'Tis but a Journey in a lowring Day, Made tiresome by the badness of the Way, I'm only riding Post to that long home, Where all, in spite of Pow'r and Wealth, must come Why therefore should you thus in Silence mourn? You soon may follow, tho' I can't return. What! tho' I'm hurry'd to the Grave, depend You'll once o'ertake me at my Journey's end. Correct your Female Passions that disguise Your Prudence, and inflame those beauteous Eyes: Exert your Patience and your Silence break, 'Twill ease your swelling Sorrows if you speak. Besides, such briny Show'rs encrease the Storm, And do my Soul of all its Pow'r disarm; Weaken those Resolutions that defy The stroke of Death, when he's advanc'd so nigh; Make me unable to despise a Life That's blest with such a kind and vertuous Wife. Lady. O! help me, Heaven, in this sad distress, What can I say, or how my Grief express? Who can such cruel Enemies forgive? What Wife sustain so great a Loss and live? Pardon my Sorrows, give me leave to mourn, Betwixt Revenge and Love I'm rack'd and torn. O! tender Husband, O! insatiate Foes, To sacrifice your Life and my repose. What shall I do, that may prolong your Breath? How shall I snatch you from the Jaws of Death? O! that good Heav'n would hear my humble Pray'rs, And lengthen this sad Day to joyful Years, Or by some speedy Miracle declare, Its just abhorrence of the Wrongs we bear. With-hold the Blow, postpone the fatal Hour, And stop the Cruelty of Human Pow'r. Lord. It is in vain to hope to be releas'd, For Miracles, my Dear, you know are ceas'd: Nor can an angry Monarch Mercy show, Whose dire Revenge sits low'ring on his Brow. I only now must reconcile my Breast, To that sharp stroke which gives eternal Rest; That I may shew, when Death approaches near, The ghastly Bugbear is not worth my Fear. But, O! my Dear, the only Sting I feel, That gives me Pain too pow'rful to conceal, Is my sad parting with the best of Wives, To me more precious than a Thousand Lives. How shall my tender Soul with Patience bear, To leave thee wretched, full of wild despair, Expos'd to all those Passions that perplex, At such a dismal time, thy weaker Sex? But hold, What is't I do? for I should arm Thy tender Breast against the great alarm, Instruct thee how to bear the dreadful weight Of Sorrows that attend thy Husband's Fate. Chear up, my Dear, be not so much dismaid, Summon your Christian Vertues to your Aid, Consider that no Sparrow to the Ground Can fall, by Man, but Heav'n permits the Wound. We all are bound with Patience to submit To ev'ry Change that God himself thinks fit. Why therefore should we Murmur? when we know, The Pow'r above us governs all below; By God's Permission all these things are done, For Reasons only to his Wisdom known, And if we humbly do our Cross sustain, Our Losses here will prove our future Gain; When if we Frown at Heaven's just Decrees, Perhaps we hazard our eternal Ease. So Kings and Judges take the self-same Course, And punish those that Cavil, but the worse. Lady. Alas! my Dear, but Heaven is too good, To be severe, or to delight in Blood. O! dreadful Sound, the very sanguine Name Does all my Passions with Revenge inflame. O! that I had but Pow'r to hold the Hand Appointed to obey this dire Command, Or that I could by Torments but extort, A Pardon from the base revengeful Court. Could Female Force or Fury but delay The tragick Scene, and stop the fatal Day; I could forget my Sex, a Tyrant prove, Postpone my Christian Duty to my Love, Make your proud Enemy revoke your Doom, Or strike his Breast with Female Vengeance home. Forgive my Passion, I'm too weak to bear The wretched Loss of him I love so dear. Have I so long a happy Life possest, Been dearly tender'd and too highly blest; Nurs'd from my Youth beneath your Nuptial Care, Cherish'd and lov'd as if divinely Fair? Have I indulg'd you with a beauteous Race, Whose Infant Charms their pregnant Gifts express, And in whose graceful Features may be view'd, The early Signs of all that's Great and Good? Have I these sweet Delights enjoy'd for Years, And must one Moment drown us all in Tears? Must my dear Children Fatherless be left, And my poor self be of my Spouse bereft? Must one revengeful Stroke afflict us all, And leave us wretched to lament your Fall? Must I to all my Comforts bid farewel, And grieve for ever in a Mourning Veil? O! let them take, with thine, my anxious Life, Curs'd be the Hand that sep'rates Man and Wife. With thee, like Aria, could I gladly feel The sharp Effects of the destructive Steel, That the proud Tyrant might appease his Wrath, And glut his Vengeance with the Lives of both. Lord. My Dear be easy, Kings must be obey'd, The tott'ring Crown's impatient for my Head. Bleeding's the only speedy Cure that's known To our State Quacks for a distemper'd Throne. A Hectick Fever long has reign'd at Court, 'Tis now high time that some be blooded for't. One to asswage their Heat must feel the Blow, Or the whole Juncto will delirious grow; And then perhaps the Frenzy might incline The Wolves to aim at greater Heads than mine. Why should a Subject Peer repine at Fate, Since Kings themselves have met with Falls as great The best of Princes has been forc'd, e're now, To grace the Scaffold with his awful Brow, And to receive the last deciding Stroke, Stoop down his Head to the tremendous Block. Why then should feeble Nature be inclin'd To save that Life which is for Death design'd, When one kind Moment will appease my Breast, And put each active lab'ring Pulse at rest? In Death, alas, what is there to be fear'd, That Man should with its near approach be scar'd? 'Tis but a parting Sigh, in which we spend That worthless Breath on which our Lives depend; A Farewel that the Soul in Triumph takes, When for more Freedom she her Prison breaks, That with swift Wings she may surmount the Sky, And to her last eternal Dwelling fly, Whete she may sit enthron'd among the blest, And Joys immense regale the welcome Guest. What have I done to interrupt my Flight, From Death's dark Mansions to eternal Light? Sin is a Curse intail'd upon Mankind, But still the humble Soul will Mercy find. Why therefore should I doubt, or why distrust Almighty Goodness, which is always Just? Lady. O burthen not your Breast with wild Despair, Your Christian Life has kept your Conscience clear, The Great Tribunal, be assur'd, will show More Mercy than your cruel Peers below, Who scan the Justice of each doubtful Cause, More by their partial Int'rest than the Laws. You have no Reason to afflict your Mind With future Dangers, when your Soul's resign'd; A heav'nly Quire the dreadful Moment wait, And weep, like me, at your approaching Fate. Methinks I see 'em round the Scaffold fly, To bear you on their Wings to endless Joye O! that I was but worthy to attend Your happy Soul to its blest Journey's end, For tho' 'tis doom'd to pass a rugged way, The gloomy Path will lead you to eternal Day. But I, my dearest Lord, poor wretched I, Must Live, a Torment worse than 'tis to Die; In Solitude remain, perhaps, for Years, And drown my anxious Hours in Floods of Tears: For what on Earth can Woman's Grief remove, Depriv'd o'th' only Object of her Love, Left to reflect upon a painful Life, Void of all Comfort when no more a Wife? Where's all the Pomp that does on Riches wait? Alas! how dang'rous is it to be Great? Who would on Wealth for Happiness depend, Since all must in one fatal Moment end? What avails Honour, Equipage, or Dress? Where's flatt'ring Friendship in this sad Distress? They're all but Shadows when the Mind's dismaid, That vanish when we most require their Aid. How blest are those who, in an humble Sphere, Enjoy but little, yet have less to fear, Who in a rural Cottage sit content, And dread no fatal Frowns of Government, But Sow with Labour, Reap the kind encrease, And free from Envy eat their Bread in Peace. O! that we'd both been destin'd to the Plains, Where o'er his Flocks the Rural Shepherd reigns, Does Bag and Bottle to his Comfort bring, And Feasts with twice the Pleasure of a King; Then had we still been safe, and blest, below The dire Revenge that does insult us now, Liv'd unmolested in a State secure, Free from the stormy Rage of angry Pow'r, Which like a Thunder-Cloud its Lightning throws, And thro' the strongest Bulwark strikes its Foes. But we, alas, are now past all Relief, You're doom'd to Silence, I to endless Grief; For all the World affords can ne'er abate Those swelling Sorrows that attend your Fate: On loathsome Earth I still must wretched be, Whilst you enjoy a blest Eternity. Lord. I fear not Death, or the dividing Steel, My Care for you is all the weight I feel; Whilst the kind Couple Nuptial Love retain, One cannot Grieve but t'other shares the Pain. I therefore beg your Tears may be forborn, It melts my Soul to see such Goodness mourn, Subdues that Christian Courage which should arm A Breast that's sinking in so black a Storm. He who to please a King in publick dies, Should the grim Ghost and all his Stings despise. Consider, Dear, 'tis Cowardice to pine, Or flinch at what superior Foes enjoin: Too much Concern is the effect of Fear, The Brave should slight the Wrongs they're forc'd to bear: He that scorns humane Pity, and is free To suffer, disappoints his Enemy. Therefore, 'tis better boldly to embrace Our Fate, than to ask Mercy with Disgrace. Then cease your Tears, and let the Pow'rful see, We've Patience equal to their Cruelty, And with a Christian Temper can sustain The worst Results of so severe a Reign. The Brave, the Just, the Gen'rous and the Great Should with a Breast undaunted meet their Fate, Sedately suffer what they can't oppose, And shew their Vertues greater than their Woes. Lady. Grief against Reason, will, alas, rebel; In spite of Precepts Nature will prevail: I must lament my Loss to an Extream, And suit my Sorrows to my high esteem, Your cruel Fate my Conflicts must improve, In due proportion to my tender Love. A Flood of undissembl'd Tears best shews, How much we value what we fear to lose. Who then can cease to weep away her Hours, Depriv'd at once of all that she adores; Left in a wretched Kingdom to become The Scorn of those who have conspir'd your Doom: O! let my Passions rend my trembling Heart, And Female Grief its utmost Pow'rs exert, Till my Valves burst, and every Vein supplies With sanguinary Tears my flowing Eyes; Thus all Relief from my sad Breast exclude, And melt at once into a briny Flood. Lord. I can no longer hear you thus deplore Your own Misfortunes and my fatal Hour. The sullen Moment now approaches near, That hurries me, alas, I know not where: Unweary'd Time flies from me now apace, Who brandishes his Scythe and shakes his Glass. For my sad Journey I must now prepare, And manage my last Stake of Life with Care. Farewel thou best of Wives; and must I say, For Ever, that's a long eternal Day. It cannot be, I'm sure, 'tis all Deceit, Comfort thy self, that we again shall meet Above the Clouds, where endless Joys abound, And nothing but eternal Love goes round. My Dear, be happy in this parting Kiss, Our next Salute will be in Paradise: Indulge your dearest Babes, forgive your Foes, Strengthen your Vertues and your Mind compose: Let Pray'r and Praise your pious Soul imploy, And Heav'n will change your Mourning into Joy. Once more, thou Glory of thy Sex farewel. What Tongue the Torments of my Breast can tell! In Death I only now can easy be. God be the Guardian of thy Babes and thee. Lady. O! ease me, Heaven, in this sad distress, What Pow'r but thine can make my Sorrows less? Alas, for Ever, O! that dreadful Sound Does ev'ry Vein with Bolts of Thunder wound, Where is my Lord, my Husband, and my Friend? On whom for Comfort must I now depend? How can you go? Return to my Relief, Leave me not drowning in a Sea of Grief. Alas! he's fled for ever from my sight, And my Hopes vanish into Horror's Night. Come, King of Terrors, with your ghastly Train, Strike home, and ease a wretched Woman's Pain; Release my strugling Breath without delay, By Life imprison'd in this worthless Clay, That to the solemn Stage my Soul may fly, And, with my Dear, surmount the distant Sky: I cannot part for ever; O! I faint, I die. Moral Reflexions on the foregoing Dialogue. [None are exempt from Death or Care] None are exempt from Death or Care, On all Degrees they hourly wait; The greatest must submit to bear The Strokes of Fortune and of Fate. 'Tis Folly therefore to rely Too much on Honour, Wealth, or Pow'r, Since none can be, tho' ne'er so high, Secure of Life, or Ease, an Hour. The Brave, the Pious, Just, and Wise, Altho' they stand upon their guard, To shun the Terrors of Surprise, They're always for the worst prepar'd. He that from Sov'reign Pow'r dissents, And strikes obliquely at the State, If overthrown by cross Events, Should like a Hero meet his Fate. For Cowardise, at such a time, Makes brave Attempts, that fail, look base, When Courage varnishes the Crime, And gives the Guilt a noble Face. Embark not in a Factious Cause, Or join with those inclin'd to change, For no Man knows, how far the Laws May stretch, to ease a King's Revenge. DIALOGUE II. Between a Pious Couple, concerning the Peaceful Comforts of a Religious Life, as on a fine Day they were taking their Recreation in the pleasant Meadows. Husband. How bounteous Heav'n does human Race delight, With all these various Scenes that bless our sight! How prosperous and gay, how calm and clear Does the bright Arch, and all beneath appear! Behold the distant Skies how blue they seem! Adorn'd with here and there a golden Stream, Which rising East, by slow degrees ascend, And to the North and South their Wings extend. What broken Clouds delight the roving Eye, And change their Shapes as on the Winds they fly, As if design'd as Beauty-spots to grace The bright Complexion of the heav'nly Face. From thence the Fair do their Example take, And heighten Female Charms with specks of black. Tho' Beauty of itself's divinely sweet, Yet the best Jewels do of Foils admit. Look round, my Dear, and view each teeming Field, Banquet your Senses with the Fruits they yield. Behold the Hills with Corn and Cockle crown'd, And how the Vales with loaded Crops abound! How richly Nature cloaths the verdant Meads, And round their Banks her sweet Embroid'ry spreads! From whence the Great their Robes and Mantles grace, And round their Skirts their Furrs and Ermins place, For ev'ry Art improv'd by human Care, From Nature's kind Examples copy'd are. Behold how yonder Flocks their Order keep, And graze unmix'd, whilst those that tend 'em sleep! Wrap'd up in silence undisturb'd they lye, And more Content than mighty Kings enjoy; Govern their Flocks as they themselves shall please, And spend their Days in Mirth, their Nights in Ease; Possess a peaceful Kingdom of their own, And only need their Dogs to guard their Throne, Who ne'er Rebel, but with a chearful speed Perform what e'er their Lords and Masters bid. O! wretched Man, to Disobedience prone, Who acts with Reason, worse than those with none, No more the Pow'r thou shou'dst obey, dispute, But learn thy Duty of each servile Brute. See how the Brooks in soft Meanders glide, And kiss the Osiers that adorn each side! Hear how the Waters murmur as they move! Observe their Speed, consider how they're drove! Why on a level they so swift should pass, And ne'er return, tho' we impede their Chase! Why keep one steddy Course, ne'er change or rest, But in their Channels rowl from East to West! Wife. All are the wond'rous Works of that great Hand, Who form'd the whole, and does the whole Command. The most minute Production we descry, Confirms the Soul there is a Deity: By whose creative Pow'r and bounteous Love, All Beings live, and in such Order move. Who can the Sun's diffusive splendor see, And not conceive a greater Light than he? What Eye amidst such Miracles can rove, Or view yon glorious Canopy above, And not ascribe what Heav'n has thus reveal'd, To that great God from humane Sight conceal'd? With pleasure we behold the mighty Space, Where the swift Sun performs his daily Race, And the bright Moon with all her glitt'ring Train, Governs the Tides in her encrease and wain! With pleasure we behold the teeming Earth, Which gives each tender Plant a thriving Birth, And kindly suckles with her milky Juice, Those various Offsprings which for human use Her fruitful Womb does ev'ry Day produce. But still the greatest Comforts that we know Above the rest, by Man enjoy'd below, Consists in praising that eternal Pow'r Who feeds us with fresh Wonders ev'ry Hour. And to convince us he's the only Good, Gives us Life, Raiment, and delightful Food, By Providence preserves our moving Clay, From Dangers that surround us ev'ry Day; Secures his thankful Creatures from the Snares That Satan, in revenge to Man, prepares; By Grace and Faith instructs us to fulfil His sacred Laws, and to perform his Will; That when the Grave demands our lifeless Dust, Our Souls, when polish'd from their sinful Rust, May share the eternal Blessings of the Just. Husband. I'm pleas'd to hear the Works that Heav'n has wrought, Inspire my Dear with such a pious Thought; For none but those that meditate can see The Beauty of this vast variety. None with true Joy can on these Wonders gaze, Unless to God they give their Thanks and Praise. The skilful Painter that's so kind to shew His artful Landskips, when the same we view, 'Tis Rudeness not to praise the gen'rous Hand Whose pow'rful Pencil could such Strokes command. How stupid then, how thankless and how base Must those dull Wretches, among human Race, Appear, that can behold, without a Sence Of Gratitude, the Works of Providence, And with a careless Freedom please the Sight, Cherish the Soul, and feast the Appetite; Yet, like unthinking Brutes, neglect to give, So much as Thanks to him by whom they live, For all those bounteous Blessings they receive! Who that considers well how Man was form'd, And his cold Clay by Breath eternal warm'd, How kindly cherish'd and preserv'd when made, How highly blest, how bountifully fed, Plac'd above other Creatures, in a State Divinely Happy, and supremely Great, Fill'd and enrich'd with an immortal Soul, And qualify'd with Reason how to rule; Seated amidst a thousand blooming Joys, Which nothing but our sinful Pride destroys, Enabl'd here to feast our Minds with Peace, In all the various Stations we possess; Promis'd hereafter, if ourselves take care, Eternal Life on Terms that easy are! How wretched then must that vile Atheist be Who can no God in all this Goodness see, But to the Pow'r of Chance ascribes the whole, And laughs to hear of an immortal Soul; Thanks none but Nature for his Form and Breath, Suffers dim Reason to exclude all Faith, And foolishly conceits there's nothing after Death. Wife. Such Profligates must sure be void of Thought, Bred amidst Brutes, unthankful and untaught, Strangers to Truth, of Reason quite bereft, And wanting Grace, to stubborn Folly left; Nurs'd up in Darkness, in their Youth misled, And early in their Ign'rance riveted, Tutor'd by Parents wicked as themselves, Or suckl'd by infernal Imps or Elves; As soon as wean'd, neglected and let loose To all the Ills that Hell and Earth produce; Or sure no Moral that can steer his way, Beneath the Sun, by Reason's glimm'ring Ray, But in the Works of Providence must see The Strokes of an eternal Majesty! Who but a God omnipotently Great, Could such a vast and fruitful World create! Raise in such Order the obedient Frame, And give his Creatures Life t'enjoy the same! Within a flaming Roof involve the whole, Where blazing Wonders rove from Pole to Pole! Bless each depending Animal with Sight, T'admire these glorious Lamps that gave us Light! Who but a God such Blessings could bestow Upon a thankless Race that crawl below! Whose daring Pride that does no Vengeance dread, Provokes the heav'nly Hand by which they're fed. O! wretched Atheist, base ingrateful Clay, To doubt of that blest Pow'r thou should'st obey, Who in an Instant can thy Soul require, And justly doom thee to eternal Fire. But sure it is impossible to find Such dire Ingratitude in humane kind! No such tremendous Monster can there be, 'Less Mad, that dares deny a Deity; His starting Soul must tremble to disown The King of Kings that rules the heav'nly Throne. What Wretch on Earth can so rebellious prove, That shares th'Effects of Providential Love, Without whose warm and kind preserving Pow'r No Mortal could survive one hasty Hour! He that enjoys the Benefit of Sight, With as much reason may deny the Light, And fancy when he views a Town or Tree, His Eyes produce those Objects that they see: This a wild Brain as eas'ly may conceive, As to behold the World, and then believe Such wond'rous Works could into Order dance, Directed by no Pow'r but giddy Chance. Such Notions are alone the vain Conceits Of crazy Students, or inebrious Wits, Who, fond of Freedom, govern'd by no Rules, Prophane the Scriptures, and despise the Schools; And by their own dull Sentiments misled, Forsake the Path where wiser Christians tread, Pursue their Lusts, no Appetite will baulk, But live as much like Heathens as they talk. Thus to all Duty more avers'd than Brutes; Each for a vicious Liberty disputes, And to his wicked Life his vile Opinion suits. So Thieves and Ruffians labour to perswade Themselves that Rapine's but an honest Trade, Or that when once the Gallows stops their Breath, There is no Hell or Judgment after Death. Husband. Tho' Good Men think there needs no more to prove A God, than that his Creatures live and move, And that the wondrous Works, we view each Hour, Proclaim a just and wise Eternal Pow'r, Yet 'tis no wonder in this Age we find Such wild Opinions rooted in Mankind, Since such illit'rate Swarms pretend to teach Those Myst'ries far beyond their shallow reach, And Wolves in Shepherds Cloathing are allow'd To banter and misguide the thoughtless Crowd. If bold Enthusiasts ignorantly bred, Some to the Shuttle, some to the Brooms and Thread, Shall be permitted to disguise the Fool, And in the room of Priests to Teach and Rule. If crafty Knaves shall into Pulpits climb, And tell the giddy World that Truth's a Crime; Be suffer'd falsly to aloud expound The Holy Text upon unhallow'd Ground; And ev'ry prating Dunce, that scarce can read The Scriptures, or repeat the Christian Creed, Usurp the Sanction of a Holy Guide, To gratify his Int'rest and his Pride. If such a Nest of Vipers shall presume To Hiss where only True Divines should come, And be allow'd to vitiate and debauch The World with groundless Tenets that they broach, False, wicked, selfish, scandalously base, And dang'rous to the Peace of human Race, Fit only to dissolve and overthrow The Duty we to God and Cæsar owe. Such wretched Doctrines that are chiefly meant T'oppress the Church and weaken Government, That Knaves may gratify their zealous Pride, And sacred Villains o'er their Betters ride. Thus draw the Crowd by their dissembl'd Whines, To serve their haughty Leaders base Designs, In joining to reform the Church and State, By crushing all true Merit, which they hate. That Shop-Divines to Pulpits may arise, And dreaming Fools proclaim their Prophesies, Whilst crafty Rebels the advantage take, And whining Slaves of all the Kingdom make. Since such Designs as these are carry'd on, Beneath the umbrage of Religion, And such a vile and sanguinary Work Does under Masks of Grace and Conscience lurk; Since scatter'd Tribes shall diff'rent Faiths possess, And all pretend to be the Sons of Grace, Their jarring Guides claim equal Right to teach What thwarting Doctrines they are pleas'd to preach. And tho' they sev'ral ways with Envy draw, Yet all alike be Christians in the Law. If opposite Opinions ought to stand On the same Footing, in the self-same Land: If diff'rent Faiths can equally be true, None can be justly blam'd that chuse a new. If all the wild enthusiastick Dreams, Rebellious Notions and fantastick Whims, Are just, if drop'd from a Fanatick Tongue, Opinion, tho' its wicked, can't be wrong. From hence, dissettl'd Minds themselves deceive, Because the World such diff'rent Ways believe. And since Religion does with License squint Such various ways, they think there's little in't. These are the thriving Mischiefs that support Atheism, and factious Schisms of ev'ry sort, Weaken Religion, we too plainly see, And strip her of her ancient Purity; Make all her Vertues, and her sacred Rules, The Scoff of daring Wits and vicious Fools, Who seeing mighty Men, that ought to be The grave Examples of Integrity, Frequent all Worships with a mod'rate Zeal, And countenance those Schisms they ought to heal, Infer, that if it be no sinful Fault In those who do 'twixt two Opinions halt, A Man may as well keep his Conscience free From all Religion, as pretend to be A mod'rate Advocate for two or three. From hence Atheistick Principles arise, And lukewarm Sons their Mother-Church despise; Think Truth an Art, Religion but a Jest, 'Cause both they find such diff'rent ways profest. Thus, from at once embracing more than one, At last they shake off all, and stick to none. So fickle Lovers in their youthful Pride, Who court at once two Women for their Bride, With neither join, but both at last deride. Wife. 'Tis strange that such a dang'rous Latitude Should thus be giv'n against the Common Good, And that Religion that preserves the Peace Of Christian Kingdoms, and of Consciences, Should thus be rent, and made the Ridicule Of ev'ry wanton Ape and chatt'ring Fool, Who think they're blest when unconfin'd and free, Tho' Ruin crowns their boasted Liberty. Give me, O Heav'n! the Grace to be Content Within those Bounds the Wicked call Restraint: May I be chain'd to those Religious Rules, Taught by Learn'd Guides, bred up in Pious Schools: May no dissembling Pharisee disturb My Peace, or ride my Conscience with a Curb, And for his own bye Int'rest teach my Tongue To rail at Truth, and to maintain what's wrong; But may the Church my Sanctuary be, Whose Doctrine shews her spotless Purity, Who by the Hand of Heav'n, her only Guard, Through many Ages has been still preserv'd; Rescu'd at all times from her restless Foes, Inspir'd by Hell to envy her Repose. May I with all her Discipline agree, Join in her Worship with Sincerity, Despise that Moderation now in vogue, And with true Zeal her Christian Precepts hug May I be able to defend my Faith Against the Insults of Fanatick Wrath, And with unshaken Loyalty caress Her Tenets as my only Happiness, Esteem them as the best and only way That leads us safely to eternal Day, Where Truth and Justice, Peace and Mercy reign, In one Great God, who will his Church maintain, In spite of those who with their impious Mouths Revile her Doctrines and prophane her Truths. Husband. I'm fill'd with Joy to hear a Female Tongue So well imploy'd, and so discreetly hung; 'Tis greatly to my Comfort that I find, Within a Woman's Breast, so rich a Mind, Endu'd with all those Vertues that compleat The peaceful Sweetness of a Nuptial State; For happy are those Families that see In Wives such true exemplar Piety, That Servants in a Mistress may discern Those heav'nly Duties which themselves should learn; And Children by a Mother's Life be taught, To early know a Vertue from a Fau't. O! that your Sex, like you, from Pride were free, Like you devout, without Hypocrisy; Fix'd in their Duty, steady in their Love, Slighting of Joys below, for those above; Pious and Peaceful, not Perverse and Proud; Chaste, Silent, Dutiful, and never Loud, To Goodness prone, to Charity inclin'd, Fond of their Children, to their Husbands kind, Sincere at Church, without a roving Eye, And on the Precepts of their Guides rely; Give way to no Temptation that they meeet, But guard their Vertue 'gainst the World's Deceit: Then wou'd a marry'd State be free from Strife, And ev'ry Husband praise a Nuptial Life, Had he, like me, a Chaste and pious Wife. Moral Reflexions on the foregoing Dialogue. [Honour, some think, that empty Sound] Honour, some think, that empty Sound, From Vice may keep Great Persons free, But Vertue can't maintain its Ground Without Exemplar Piety. He that on humane Strength relies, Depends but on a broken Staff; No Guard without Religious Ties Can keep the Mind entirely safe. By Grace we only can subdue Those craving Lusts that swell our Veins; And that's but granted to those few That seek it by Religious Means. True Piety revives the Soul, And fortifies the Mind within, Does our loose Appetites controul, And makes us Enemies to Sin. It Peace preserves, does Strife prevent, In all the various States of Life, And is the greatest Ornament That can adorn a Maid or Wife. Therefore may those who are so base To make a Cloak on't, be accurst, For amongst all the wicked Race A Pious Villain is the worst. DIALOGUE III. Between an unfortunate Nobleman and his beautiful Lady, who had surrender'd her Charms to the Caresses of her Sovereign. Lord. Bane of my Life, once Object of my Joys, Who'd Pow'r to bless, but now has curs'd my Choice; Charming in Feature, of an awful Mein, Without an Angel, but a Dev'l within; Beauteous but Lustful, Gen'rous not Good, Modest in publick, but in private lewd. What vile Asmodeus has inflam'd thy Breast? Why so deprav'd, and with such Graces blest? How could a Lady, so devoutly bred, Be tempted to defile her Marriage-bed? Why to your Husband would you prove unjust, And shame yourself to please a Monarch's Lust? Why would you make such Charms your Prince's Sport, To be a false, tho' glitt'ring, Lamp at Court? When if you'd sav'd your Honour, you had been, Altho' a Subject, greater than a Queen; For had such Beauty been with Vertue join'd, Both had the Lustre of a Crown out-shin'd; But now, alass, dark lustful Clouds arise, Obscure your Brightness, and eclipse your Eyes. Your odious Guilt your Female Charms debase, Your sinful Deeds your Quality disgrace, And cast a nauseous Mist all o'er your lovely Face. Why, therefore, would you play such wanton Freaks, And with adult'rous Blushes stain your Cheeks? Why thus become a Paramour of State, To only be more titularly Great. Lady. What Woman can resist a King's Amours? Or who refuse what Majesty implores? What Female Subject durst to disapprove? Or give Resistance to a Monarch's Love? What they command, our wisest Teachers say, We're strictly bound in Duty to obey; And if the secret Favours they exact, Are base, unjust, and sinful in the Act, The Sin's not ours, because we don't deny, But theirs, whose Powr can force us to comply. How then can I his Royal Will withstand Who stoop'd to beg what Princes might command? Besides, when Love, that Tyrant, has possest A spiteful Monarch, and inflam'd his Breast, What beauteous Object of his am'rous Grief Would venture to deny a King Relief, And hazard that Revenge her Slights may find, Rather than strain her Vertue to be kind? Woman, tho' ne'er so chaste, in such a case, May sooth his Passion, and thro' Fear transgress, Because in Love 'tis safer to engage, Than run the Hazard of a Prince's Rage: When sov'rign Pow'r attacks, we cannot fly, The want of Courage makes the Fair comply. Lord. These are dark Arguments the am'rous feign, T'excuse the lustful Habits they retain. The faithless Wife by Nature is a Jilt, And never wants a Plea to sooth her Guilt. Woman debauch'd, tho' she approves the Sin, Reflects the Blame on those that drew her in; And tho' she seeks the Pleasure that she loves, Would fain be thought more modest than she proves. Had Graee and Duty influenc'd your Mind, And your soft Youth to Vertue been inclin'd, When once you found just Reasons to distrust, Your Charms had fann'd the Fire of Royal Lust, And that your Prince was eagerly design'd To tempt you by his Flatt'ries to be kind, You shou'd have then from Court your Smiles withdrawn When his false Love was in its early dawn; For 'tis a Maxim that does seldom miss, Remove the Cause, and the Effect will cease. Instead of that, forgetful of the Shame, You fann'd his Lust, and glory'd in his Flame, With equal Passion met his warm Embrace, And turn'd upon him in his am'rous Chase, Stop'd his Pursuit, receiv'd him in your Arms, And bid the Monarch welcome to your Charms. Lady. When Woman finds she must at last comply, 'Tis better early to be free than shy: A Gen'rous Freedom to a Gen'rous Mind, Shews Love instead of Int'rest makes us kind, Doubles a Prince's Passion by Surprise, And makes his Bounty equal to his Joys; When she that's conquer'd by a seeming Force, And when she rises counterfeits Remorse, Thinks by false Tears t'extenuate her Guilt, Loses her Aim, and for the Drops she'as spilt, Is always constru'd but the greater Jilt. Suppose, to shew my Vertue, I had fled From Court, and had despis'd a Monarch's Bed, Shewn my Resentment of his lawless Flame, If a King's Love deserves so bad a Name; Such Provocations might have work'd a Change, And turn'd his Passion into dire Revenge; Th'Effect of such a pow'rful Lovers Wrath, Might still have prov'd more fatal to us both; For she who wins a Monarch by her Charms, And flies his Presence to escape his Arms, Be she a beauteous Virgin or a Wife, Conspires against his Ease, if not his Life; And should a Husband's Counsel be the Cause That the King's Fav'rite from his Court withdraws, The slighted Monarch, full of Love and Rage, May bring them both upon the fatal Stage; For Kings, whose Love does into Fury change, Ne'er want a Plot to satiate their Revenge: Therefore 'twas Prudence rather to submit, Than run the Risque of an obscure Retreat; And better far for you to be content, Than clamour at those Wrongs you can't prevent. Who would not such a small Affront disdain, Sooner than grin, and shew his Teeth in vain, Forget the Pleasures of his Nuptial Bed, And lose a Wife much rather than his Head. Reflect not on my Failings, but desist, And of two Evils wisely chuse the least. Lord. 'Tis hard you should your Nuptial Contract break, And I that am thus injur'd fear to speak: Your Threat'nings shew how you approve your Vice, And that you made your sinful Shame your Choice. I know too well that I am not secure, Princes in Love no Rivals can endure; Th'approaching Danger does, alas, appear, I see my End, or my Confinement near. Ills always are by greater Ills pursu'd, Adult'ry is too oft confirm'd with Blood: The lustful King, that basely does invade The Nuptial Pleasures of a Subjects Bed, By some Pretence the Cuckold should destroy, For fear Revenge should reach him in his Joy. Or force his injur'd Rival, by Command, On pain of Death, to quit his Native Land. Since you have thus your Marriage-Vows transgrest, I know my Fate will be but hard at best. O faithless Woman, thus at once to blast My Joys, and all my future hopes o'ercast: By thee to lasting Mis'ries I'm betray'd, By thee my Life one settl'd Storm is made, By thy Desertion am I dispossest Of all the Comforts that enrich'd my Breast. Curs'd be the Tyrant that invades my Right, May anxious Thoughts torment him Day and Night, May none but Fools and Rebels guard his Throne, By Whores be beggar'd, and by Knaves undone: May he be punish'd by a Bastard-Race, And not one lawful Son his Palace grace: May he starve Merit, and ungrateful prove To all his Friends that have deserv'd his Love: May he be only Generous and Free, To mercenary Jilts, more lewd than thee; Give all to those who study his Disgrace, Till grown as poor as they are false and base: And when he'as thus exhausted all his Store,, May Parliaments refuse to give him more: May all his Whores be false to his Embrace, And fill his Court with a rebellious Race, May they be kindest to his greatest Foes, And all his Secrets in their Arms disclose: May treach'rous Knaves into his Treasure dive, Himself grow needy, whilst his Harlots thrive: May only Pimps and Flatt'rers have his Ear, Till he becomes a Prince without a Peer, Be made the common Subject of Lampoon, Till ridicul'd by all the Fops in Town: May Fears and Jealousies perplex his Days, And ev'ry Jilt he keeps become a Lais: May groundless Plots turmoil his harass'd Reign, And hard-mouth'd Villains publick Credit gain, Amuse his Kingdom with prepost'rous Lies, And make his People think him weak, tho' wise: May he commence more Debts than he can pay, Till Duns and Murmurs plague him ev'ry Day: May he to kiss the City Wives descend, And of their Husbands borrow Sums to spend, Thus chouse the wealthy Cuckolds of the Change, Till the horn'd Crew turn Rebels thro' Revenge. In this Condition let him Live and Reign, Till his Strength fails him and his Lusts remain, Then may he give up the Supream Command, And die a Beggar in a wealthy Land. As for your Part, may your adult'rous Charms Prove false and treach'rous to his lustful Arms, Till by himself detected in your Guilt, And manifestly prov'd an arrant Jilt, In Indignation from his Bed be thrown, And made the common Jest of all the Town. May that sweet Beauty, which you now can boast, Be render'd nauseous by your shameful Lust: May your wild Fancy range the publick Fairs, And fix on Dancers of the Ropes and Play'rs, Betray your Charms into the Arms of Slaves, Till scoff'd by Scoundrels, and misus'd by Knaves. Thus may you live at large, profusely lewd, And never entertain one Thought of Good; Despis'd by th'Issue of your Monarch's Loins, Who owe their Birth to your adult'rous Sins. When wither'd grown, with batter'd Beaus engage, Be doom'd the only Lais of the Age, And forc'd to herd with Strumpets of the Stage. Lady. Thank ye, my Lord, 'tis nobly wish'd, I'll swear, But Heav'ns too good to hear so vile a Pray'r: I thank my Stars I now am plac'd above The Fury of your poor revengeful Love. I have a Monarch now to stand my Friend, And you had best take care how you offend. Farewel, I owe no Duty now to you, What you deem shameful I shall still pursue, And will obey my Prince, superior of the two. Moral Reflexions on the foregoing Dialogue. [How can a vicious Husband blame] How can a vicious Husband blame The Failings of a wanton Wife, If his Example taught the Dame To wander from a vertuous Life. He, that expects his Bride should prove To his Embraces truly Just, Should ne'er debase his Nuptial Love, By giving looses to his Lust. Man o'er his Wife the Rule may claim, But if she finds he does her Wrong, She fails not to revenge the same, By the ill use of Tail or Tongue. Women are of Resentment quick, Prone much to Jealousie and Spight, And love to shew us Trick for Trick, If we their kind Embraces slight. How can we blame the Charming Fair, And at their wanton Follies scoff, Since we ourselves cannot forbear The Vices we accuse them of. Would we, their Tyrant Lords, but tame The restless Fury of our Lust, The Ladies must of course reclaim, And prove more Continent and Just. DIALOGUE IV. Between a Dethron'd Prince and his Disconsolate Princess. Prince. Who that is wise would covet to be Great, A Sphere twixt Envy and the frowns of Fate. Where Storms arise and sudden Thunders rowl, And with tremendous Claps surprise the Soul? What real Blessings could we call our own, When perch'd aloft upon a tott'ring Throne, Built on the Pleasure of a fickle Crowd, Too fawning, or too insolent and Proud; Resty if spurr'd; when check'd, too fast would run; Slow to their Good, in haste to be undone. Why should we then thus grieve beneath our Loss? With Joy the Christian ought to bear his Cross; The true Heroick Breast should ne'er repine, Since Vertue through a Cloud does brigthest shine The Brave undaunted should embrace their Fate, And in the worst of Troubles still be Great. Princess. But Woman is, alas, too weak to bear So vast a Load of inexpressive Care, To fall from Empire, to forsake a Crown, And fly the awful Grandeur of a Throne, That our proud Rivals undisturb'd might wear Those Glories we have only Right to share. No Female Breast is able to sustain So deep a Stab, but she must feel the Pain: No Balsam heal, tho' skilfully apply'd, A Wound so mortal to a Woman's Pride! Who can with Patience bear the Loss of Pow'r? If once a King, 'tis wretched to be low'r. Tameness when injur'd makes a Prince a Slave, Without Revenge no Suff'rer can be Brave. Nor is he fit to make a Crown his own, Who will not hazard, e're he's quite undone, A despicable Life to save a Throne. Prince. But if a Prince be flatter'd and betray'd, And, without Cause, unjustly odious made, Left naked when the Storm begins to low'r, By Friends forsaken, and disarm'd of Pow'r, Invaded by a Rival, at a time When all the Land thought Loyalty a Crime, Girt round with Foes, deserted in the Field, Threaten'd by Crowds that ev'ry where rebell'd, How should a King, in these Distresses left, Robb'd of his Wealth, and of his Arms bereft, Maintain his Ground, and with Success oppose Domestick Rebels join'd with Foreign Foes? What Lyon can defend his awful Beard From Scoffs and Insults, with his Talons par'd? At such a time 'tis better far to shun Impending Fate, than into Danger run. 'Tis brave and wise to make a safe Retreat, When if we fight, we know we must be beat. Princess. But you had Arms sufficient to have try'd, To whom good Heav'n had been the most ally'd; For tho' some Legions to your Rival fled, Yet Thousands, hearty to your Int'rest, staid, And with their Blood would have manur'd the Plain, To've sav'd your Person and prolong'd your Reign. Why therefore did you then forsake the Field, And to the Rebels such Advantage yield, Fly from an Army that were free to fight, And forward to assert your Lawful Right, Give your Foes Reason to suspect your Fear, And make your Friends dispirited appear: Such Tameness did your Loyal Troops incense, And shew'd that you despair'd of Providence, Or what tame Prince, to've curb'd a Rival's Pride, Would not on Heav'n for Vict'ry have rely'd. Whose sinking Cause had Justice on its side. Prince. Our kind Regard to an ingrateful Land, Soften'd our Breast, and did our Sword command, Unwilling to inflame the growing Jars, By vain Resistance, into bloody Wars, Wherein our Foes would still have gain'd the Day, And all our Loyal Friends been made their Prey: Most of our Subjects did our Cause decline, The major Part were in the grand Design; Those we had trusted from our Int'rest fled, Others stood neuter and the Danger weigh'd, Careless of Duty would have join'd the Side That prov'd the strongest, had the Cause been try'd. Nor could we hope to stop our Rival's Course, And prove Victorious by a weaker Force: Therefore had we engag'd, and fail'd in Fight, By Conquest then he would have claim'd a Right, And our poor Friends, too feeble to defend Our Crown, had all been slaughter'd in the end; And our whole Kingdom made a Land of Slaves To Foreign Soldiers and domestick K?s. For such-like Reasons we, alas, withdrew, What for our Safety better could we do, When Foes were grown so num'rous, and our Friends so few? Besides, no longer is a Prince secure From pop'lar Tumults, than possest of Pow'r; And who, when threaten'd, rashly would engage To stand the Insults of the publick Rage, Rather than timely make a safe Retreat, To shun th'Effects of such a dang'rous Heat? When scorch'd 'tis Madness to withstand the Fire, No Mortal when he's burnt would creep the nigh'r, But as the Flames encrease beyond their reach, retire. Princess. But when the Danger did at first appear, You'd still been safe, had you been more severe; Your Justice was, alas, too long delay'd, And too much Lenity yourself betray'd. When you'd first notice of your Rival's Aim, And saw your Kingdom in a Factious Flame, You should have then been active, and have blown Up all around, to've sav'd your Royal Throne, Remov'd those Snakes you'd reason to distrust, Who'd long before been treach'rous and unjust, Punish'd the Leaders of the Factious Rout, And been secure of all you'd cause to doubt: For when a Gangrene shall endanger Life, A skilful Surgeon never spares his Knife, But wisely knows, that to be safe and sure, Is to prevent what's difficult to cure. In all Contagions that are apt to spread, The Limbs should suffer to preserve the Head; And where the Fever's hard to be supprest, The sharpest Means prove commonly the best. Experience teaches, in a Case like ours, Desp'rate Diseases should have desp'rate Cures. Prince. But what Physician can, with all his Art, Cure a whole Kingdom, when it's sick at Heart, Poyson'd b'unskilful Quacks, whose constant Course Is still to make a bad Distemper worse, 'Till their vile Nostrums, wrongfully apply'd, Raise the Disease, or make the Wound more wide. Thus, thro' Design of Gain, or want of Skill, With hurtful Med'cines they inflame the Ill, Till too Rebellious grown for humane Art to heal. This was our Kingdom's Case, before we lost That sov'reign Pow'r we could so lately boast: Ambitious Spirits thro' Revenge or Pride, With poys'nous Draughts the thirsty Crowd supply'd, Inflam'd their Heads with what the Fools receiv'd, That Lying Knaves might be the more believ'd. And when with false Reports they'd ply'd their Ears, Fill'd them with groundless Jealousies and Fears, To make us odious and the People mad, They render'd all our Good Intentions bad, Chang'd our best Favours into ill Design, Committed Faults themselves and made 'em mine, Rais'd jealous Factions, then provok'd the same, That they on us might falsly charge the Blame, Fomented Feuds and did Seditions sow, And caus'd each little Breach wider to grow; Hid every Danger from our watchful Eyes, And ply'd us with destructive Flatteries, 'Till the loud Clamours of the Crowd reveal'd Those secret Ills that had been long conceal'd; The unforeseen Alarm our Soul surpris'd, Well we design'd, but still were ill advis'd; The unsuspected Snakes we long had warm'd With Royal Favour kept us still unarm'd, And made the Danger by Deceit appear Too small to raise so great a Monarch's Fear; In these we trusted to secure our Throne, And heal those Breaches which so wide were grown; But they, Quack-like, our Confidence abus'd, And poys'nous Corrosives for Balsams us'd; Inflam'd the Wounds till Fevers did ensue, And all the injur'd Land delirious grew, Thus were our People and ourselves deceiv'd By those in whom we trusted and believ'd, 'Till the Grand Project, they had deeply laid, Was ripe, and fit for Execution made; Then, to our great Surprise, the Scene they drew, And did at once the frightful Danger shew; Gave us the dismal Prospect when too late To save our Throne and disappoint our Fate, Whilst those beneath our Royal Bounty bred, Forsook us first, and to our Rival fled; By their Example shew'd the rest the Way, How to be safe, and yet to disobey. But why should we think hard to be betray'd? The King of Kings a faithless Judas had. The Wicked always at the Righteous spurn, And never want a Villain for their turn. Thus from our Presence all the Court withdrew, Except a kind, but insufficient few, Too weak, alas, unable to postpone Our speedy Ruine, and to guard our Throne: The vile Corruption thro' our Army fled, Those that went off dishearten'd those that staid. Therefore had we the Cause in Battle try'd, The Vict'ry must have crown'd the Rebels side, And then our Rival would, by force of Arms, Have claim'd our Crown on less ignoble Terms, Which, without Conquest, he was glad to take, On such Conditions as the Crowd would make; For he that on a Factious Tribe depends, Must basely stoop to gain his baser Ends. They only mean to use him as their Tool, He wears the Crown, but they usurp the Rule. A lawful Prince would rather lose his own, Than change his Regal to a servile Throne. We envy not his Pomp, poor wretched Thing, That reigns below the Dignity of King. E'en let him hug the Prize, till by degrees, He finds he's curs'd, whilst we enjoy our Ease. A Crown, at best, is but a careful Weight, That frets and gauls the Temples of the Great; But when unjustly gain'd Experience, shows, It still more pond'rous and vexatious grows; And tho' receiv'd in Pomp, and hug'd with Joy, It grinds the Head that wears the glitt'ring Toy. Princess. As angry Sportsmen, when they've lost their Game, The Stag or Hare for sorry Meat condemn, Change their Opinion as they find the Chase Unlucky, or attended with Success, So you, my Liege, in Solitude, despise The Royal Gem, because you've lost the Prize; Power, the Glory of a Prince, disdain, And think it now an anxious Life to Reign. But whilst in Safety you enjoy'd your Throne, And held the Regal Scepter as your own, Flatter'd by all, and reverenc'd like a God, Whilst lesser Pow'rs obey'd each awful Nod. What Motives could have made you then resign What now with so much Tameness you decline? As if your Priests had your Great Soul betray'd, And of a King a pensive Anch'rite made. Or that your Brave, Heroick, Princely Mind, That shew'd 'twas once for Sov'reign Pow'r design'd, Had taken flight and left the worthless Clay behind. What strange ignoble Patience has possest, Or pious Whispers charm'd your Royal Breast, That you can fit at ease, and calmly bear Wrongs so provoking, with so little Care; As if you found more Pleasure and Content In pensive Joys, than Regale Government. Rowse up your Soul from its Lethargick Sleep, Revenge the Loss of what we could not keep; For 'tis, alas, beneath a valiant Breast, To suffer tamely when by Fraud opprest. The meanest Slave, divested of his Right, Will shew his Teeth, tho' he wants Pow'r to bite. What injur'd Monarch, therefore, would outlive Revenge, a suff'ring King's Prerogative. Prince. But kind Experience has convinc'd our Breast, The only State we dreaded proves the best; We have had leisure to reform our Mind From those Mistakes which long have kept us blind: The dazling Pomp and Grandeur of a Throne, And noisy Hurry that attends thereon, Are but vain Shadows which the Great devise To cheat themselves and pleasure others Eyes, Meer gaudy outside Colours that delight The Fool, and reach no farther than the Sight; Dull empty Gewgaws that delude the Soul From Joys that prove more permanent and full. What were we better for the Crouds Huzzas, For rev'rend Bows and mercenary Praise? For the base Flatt'ries of deceitful Knaves, And the false Homage of ingrateful Slaves? For Guards who only did for Bread obey, And would have soon rebell'd for better Pay? By Loss of Empire we have learn'd to know, There's nothing more in these than outward show, External Glory, which the Wise deride, That Pleasure's not our Vertue, but our Pride, The poor Reward of Kings, so seldom blest With real Comforts or unbroken Rest. But now, since Heav'n has eas'd us of our Cares, And freed us from the Toil of State Affairs, We've leisure to enjoy our sweet Content, Safe from the Stings and Plagues of Government: Let's therefore now be careful to improve Our Wisdom, Vertue, Piety and Love; Learn to be Good, in that we shall be Great, Without the Weight of Crowns or Toils of State; Forgive our Foes, and that's a mightier thing, Than to possess a Throne, and live a King; Forget our Sceptres, and despise the Frauds Of those that worship Princes as their Gods. Defy the treach'rous Smiles or haughty Frowns Of venerable Caps, or rev'rend Gowns; Implore good Heav'n to grant 'em all a Sence Of our hard Suff'rings and their own Offence. Thus let us live, as Life itself decays, And give to him that governs Kings our Praise, Who, without Empire, still can bless our Days. Princess. 'Tis good Advice, but difficult to take, Who can forgive, and on a Throne look back? Or think of Foes so treacherous as ours, Without Revenge proportion'd to our Pow'rs? However, since I find your Godlike Mind Only to Peace and Piety inclin'd, My Breast from Female Passions will I free, Your Vertues shall my great Example be. What Wife, that knows her Duty, would controul The blest Resolves of so Divine a Soul? But learn of such bright Excellence to live Unmov'd by Fate, to suffer and forgive, Disarm her Breast of its revengeful Sting, And follow him, too Just to be a King. Moral Reflexions on the foregoing Dialogue. [He's only brave that can sustain] He's only brave that can sustain Ill Fortune with a Gen'rous Mind; Cowards are bold upon the Main, Whilst wafted with a prosp'rous Wind. But he's the Pilot that can steer His rowling Bark thro' raging Seas, And work her safely, void of Fear, Thro' Tempests, to the Port of Peace. Those who alone their Brav'ry owe To outward Grandeur and Success, If by Misfortunes once brought low, Prove: always despicably base. Those, who are truly Brave, retain Their Courage under adverse Fate, When happy, never proudly vain, Or fawning in a wretched State. But do in all Conditions steer Undaunted, with a comely Grace; In Power never too severe, Or much dejected in Distress. He's blest that fears no fatal Hour, Nor pines at any cross Event, Who knows 'tis neither Wealth or Pow'r, But Wisdom that ingrafts Content. DIALOGUE V. Between a melancholy fanciful Gentleman and his merry bantering Wife. Husband. I'm very ill, my Dear, I find I'm, Bladder-like, blown up with Wind; See how I'm swell'd from Head to Foot, As big as a Canary Butt: Prithee, my Dear, observe my Nose, How wonderfully large it grows; What a huge Monster of a Head Is my poor crazy Noddle made, And feels as if, from Flesh and Bone, 'Twas newly chang'd to Wood or Stone. Pray, my Dear, send for some Physician, I find I'm in a strange Condition. Wife. 'Tis true, you're greatly swell'd of late, But yet, I hope, 'twill soon abate, Unless some Spider has undone ye, By pissing in your Sleep, upon ye, Or else crept slily down your Throat, When you were fast and did not know't; Such Accidents sometimes, in spight Of Care, may happen in the Night: But should it prove so, I am sure My Cordial will effect the Cure, Here take a lusty Dram, my Dear, 'Tis a rare Antidote, I'll swear; One Glass will carry off the Wind, And raise a stinking Storm behind, Reduce you, from a monstrous Stature, To a brisk, lively, mod'rate Creature; Bring down your Nose, so big about, To be a pretty midling Snout; And make your Head no bigger show, Then 'twas an Heur or two ago. Husband. Then hand it quickly to my Mouth, That it may stop my speedy Growth; For at this rate I am afraid, My Doors must all be wider made, And to my great Expence and Charge, My Beds and Chairs be made more large; For I'm already grown a Beast, A meer squab Elephant at least, A huge fat Monster of a Man, With Head like any Sarazen. Wife. Drink this, my Dear, 'twill mend the Matter, And fetch down your gygantick Stature; This single Dose, I dare maintain, Will bring you into Shape again; When I've been swell'd with Wind, for want Of Vent, as big as John of Gaunt, That I was larger I may swear, Than well-fed Ox or Flanders-Mare, I'd take but one refreshing Coag, Of this Balsamick Chimagog, And in a quarter of an Hour 'Twould expel Wind with so much Pow'r, That ev'ry Puff at Mouth or Tail, Would blow round any Windmil-sail, And each Eruption roar as loud As Clap of Thunder from a Cloud: Thus would it carry off the Wind, Not only upwards, but behind, Till I became again by Tipling This Cordial, such a slender Stripling, That many fancy'd, by my Stature, I only fed on Bread and Water, To be a Pissle-wasted Creature. Husband. I've drank it off, and hope that I May find like Benefit thereby; It warms my Stomach, and revives My Heart; O! thou'rt the best of Wives. Methinks a Hurricane I feel Blow thro' my Veins from Head to Heel, And Whirlwinds in my Bowels pent, Are striving both ways for a Vent. Stand off, beware the Blast, my Dear, I find a mighty Storm is near, That will in Belch or Fizzle fly, Upwards or downwards by and by. O! how it rowls within like Thunder, As if 'twould rend my Guts asunder. Row, dow, 'tis gone, hold fast, my Dear, What a loud dreadful Blast was there! I greatly fear'd it might have blown The House, or Stack of Chimneys down. Some Evil Spirit sure possest me, And by his hellish Pow'r opprest me; It must be so, for do but mind The Brimstone Scent 't has left behind. O! how much easier I am grown, Now this tormenting Fury's flown; I am much better, that I am, Wife, prithee give me t'other Dram, Thou best of all the Female Race, Fill't up, I'll venture t'other Glass, Who knows but this Infernal Fiend, That fled in such a boist'rous Wind, Has left some evil Dregs behind. Wife. I know one Dose has work'd the Cure, 'Tis good, however, to be sure: I find your Swelling's much abated, You've now no mighty Nose or Great-head, But from a Monster art become Almost as little as Tom Thumb; Your Mill-Post Legs, to me be Thanks, Are now reduc'd to Spindle-shanks; And your huge Belly, that was blown To twice the bigness of a Tun, In this short time appears to be Not above Firkin-size to me: I'm certain you yourself must find Your bulky Greatness much declin'd, And that you're growing downwards now, Like Tail of Heifer or of Cow. However, to compleat the Cure, I'll venture you with one Dram more, And that I'm certain, will relieve you, And carr' off all the Dregs that grieve you. Husband. Thank you, good Wife, I must allow, I'd been a Monster but for you, Fit only to've been shown at Fairs, Among Wolves, Elephants and Bears; Or to have stood against the Wall, Twixt Gog and Magog in Guild-hall. But thank you, Dear, this t'other Glass Has made my Swelling fall apace: But should I waste all Night as fast, As I have done this half Hour past, I fear by th'Morning 'twould reduce My manly Stature to a Mouse, And that's as bad as 'tis to be A huge gygantick Prodigy. Methinks 'tis better to be fear'd, With a large Head and mighty Beard, Be gaz'd at and admir'd by all, For being monstrous big and tall, Than be despis'd for being small. Wife. I find it difficult to please ye, You're neither full or fasting easy; But like my Grannum's useless Kettle, Either too big or else too little; However, I, that had a Knack To bring so huge a Monster back, From b'ing the Wonder of our Eyes, To be a Man of a dapper size, Will find out some effectual Dose, To stop your dwindling to a Mouse, 'Twould be a Scandal to myself To have you run from Shelf to Shelf, Or live i'th' corner of my Cupboard, I'd rather you should be a Lubbard, A huge unwieldy Fellow, fit For nothing but to lie or sit. I should abhor to have a Spouse Run squeaking up and down the House, A Pigmy, lesser than a Rat, That would not dare to face a Cat, But, if Puss Evans should appear, Skulk into Holes I know not where. No, no, I have a new Invention, To stop so scurvy a Declension, I'll twenty pretty ways devise, To keep you up to humane Size, Before I'll let you backwards grow, To such a Pigmy Bedfellow; I like a comely midling Spouse, Between a Monster and a Mouse, And you shall find that such a one Ill make of you, before I've done. Husband. Thank you, good Wife, but see how fast Each withering Limb begins to waste, My very Hands are fall'n away, How will you stop this swift Decay; My Arms are dwindl'd into Straws, My Fingers into Sparrows Claws; Into Sheep-shanks my Legs are grown, Alas, I scarce can stand alone; My Belly's gone I know not whither, My Body's but a Kex or Feather. O! help me now, my Dear, I pray do, For I'm quite wasted to a Shadow, A perfect Ghost, enough to fright All that should meet me in the Night: I am meer Air: keep close, I pray, The Door, or I shall fly away; I'm turning to an empty Nothing, That has no Substance but my Cloathing; Therefore, my Dear, I pray be speedy In your Assistance, now I need ye, Or I'm afraid I soon shall be Changed to a strange Non-entity, And wanting your kind Application, By wasting, suffer Annih''lation. Wife. Consid'ring how profusely great Your monstrous Body was of late, How broad your Platter-Face was grown, And what a Nose you had thereon, I cannot but confess and say, I think you're strangely fall'n away; So an Ox-Bladder ty'd and blown, Till to the full Extent 'tis grown, Looks plump till we discharge the Wind, And then the skinny Bag we find To nothing shrinks that's left behind. However, don't despair of Cure, My Physick's speedy, safe and sure; By downright Kitchen Application, I'll stop your further Declination; I've something o'er the Fire below, Will plump you up and make you grow As fat, as lively, brisk and gay As you have been this many-a-day: Be patient, it shall soon be here, I'll step and fetch it up, my Dear, 'Twill prove at once both Food and Physick, And will cure any Man that is sick. Husband. Thank you a thousand times, my Dear, Thou best of all the gentle Fair. When I am in this sad Condition, Thou always art my best Physician. Alas! How wretched would my Life Prove, without such a tender Wife? Tho' 'tis behind her Back I say't, No Man has sure so kind a Mate, A Friend, a Doct'ress and a Creature That's full of nothing but Good-nature. But, bless me! how I'm drip'd away, Like Ice upon a Sun-shine Day. Methinks I cannot see or feel An Ounce of Flesh from Head to Heel. How lean, how meagre, and how thin Are my sharp Nose, my Jaws, my Chin, As if I was become my own Memento, e're my Life was flown! What Legs, what Thighs, what Arms are here, Nothing but Skin and Bone appear! I'm only fit to be lock'd up In a Glass Case in Surgeon's Shop, There to be mus'd upon and seen, By ev'ry Patient that comes in. Come, prithee, Death, and end my Days— What a long while this Woman stays! But the sick Spouse should be possest O'th' Patience of a Job at least; For the Wife thinks the feeble Drone But a sad Burthen till he's gone. O! here she comes at last, I find. My Jewel, thou'rt extreamly kind: But I am almost spent, I fear I'm past Recov'ry now, my Dear. Wife. Here's that, my Love, will strengthen Nature, And make you quite another Creature: Fall to and eat this fat young Capon, Well boil'd, with butter'd Sprouts and Bacon, 'Tis th'only thing a learn'd Physician Prescribes to those in your Condition: 'Twill plump your Veins and make you grow In Flesh, whether you will or no, Exalt your Spirits and relieve you, In spite of all the Ills that grieve you. How white it looks, how fine it cuts, See how the lushious Gravy spouts; Here take this lovely Wing and Liver, There's Greens, and here's a charming Sliver: Of Hampshire Bacon, fat and lean, So finely streak'd, so red within, That 'tis sufficient to invite The nicest sickly Appetite, To eat a Pound of 't at a Meal, Altho' the Patient's ne'er so ill. Well done, my Dear, I'm glad to see A sick Man feed so heartily; It is a Sign of speedy Health, As Av'rice seems to promise Wealth: And still the more you eat and faster, The sooner your Disease you'll master. Husband. Indeed, my Dear, 'tis very good, This serves for Physick and for Food, Does not alone the Palate please. But fights and conquers the Disease, And gives you present Demonstration, 'Tis double in its Operation. I find already I'm much better, Each Mouthful makes me grow the fatter. Ah! Wife, thou art my only Blessing, A Comfort far beyond expressing; Thy Kitchen-Physick much exceeds The Juice of nasty Drugs and Weeds, For ev'ry Bit that now I swallow, Makes me more fleshy and less hollow. See how my Legs and Arms begin To plump, that were before so lean! And how my Face, that was no more Than a Deaths-Head but just before, Is now with Substance cover'd o'er. Wifes. Here's a fine Leg, pray do but view it, Take t'other Slice of Hampshire to it; One Spoonful more of Greens, my Dear, Eat freely, Love, and never fear, I'd have you pick it while it's warm, I ne'er advise you to your harm, I know you like a Bit by th' by, That's hot and hot, as well as I. Husband. I vow, my Dear, what you have put on My Plate's enough to serve a Glutton. I fear that I shall thrive with eating At this rate, faster than 'tis fitting, And grow, by dint of Food, once more, As big a Monster as before. Wife. Ne'er fear it, Love, but fill thy Belly, And when you've eat enough I'll tell ye, I've a small Dose to give you a'ter, That I'll engage, shall stint your Stature: I'll stop the Swelling of your Waste, And ev'ry Part that grows too fast. Your thriving Nose shall prove no more Too monstrous for your Parlor-door, I've Dazy-Roots, first bruis'd and boil'd, And Cordials from the same distill'd, Which, if administer'd in Season, Will stop your growing out of reason, That no fine Beau, that cups and sweats, And thrice a Week at Gaming frets, Shall to the charming Ladies shew A finer Shape, my Dear, than you. Husband. And have you such a wond'rous Art, Thou only Comfort of my Heart, Then I'll eat t'other Wing, I'll swear, And Leg too, if you please, my Dear; For by my pidling and my picking This lovely Fowl, this tender Chicken, I find in Belly, Limbs, and Face, I gather Flesh and Strength apace. Wife. Eat Legs and Wings, and pick the Body, I'm certain 'twill not incommode ye, Boil'd Fowls a Dish I never care for, Altho' I know not why or wherefore: Besides, I'm well, and you are sick, Therefore do you the Carcass pick, I like the Sprouts and Bacon best, I'll sup on that, take you the rest. But now, my Dear, 'tis time, I think, Amidst your eating, you should drink, Here take a Glass of Red, 'tis good To wash down and digest your Food: Or else your Stomach being weak, Your Meat, perhaps, may make you sick, For want of Liquor that is proper To drive down such a hearty Supper. Husband. Thank you, my Dear, for all your Care: Your Health,—'tis very good I'll swear; It warms my Stomach, and I find By this same Belch, it brings up Wind, And has already made me fit To venture on another Bit. Well, Wife, thou'rt qualify'd to be Doct'ress t' a Prince, as well as me. Thy Physick may be eas'ly taken, What Pills can equal Fowl and Bacon? Or what Physician's Cordial save me, When sick, like what you just now gave me? I vow, my Dear, I must desire The other Glass, but fill it high'r; For, I protest, you cannot think, How much I mend, each Cup I drink. Wife. I would not have you be too busy, For fear its Fumes should make you dizzy: You that within this Hour were drawn To a poor thin-jaw'd Skeleton, Whose Bones were worn so very bare, Your Ribs, like Rack-staves did appear, And your Head only fit to grace A Church-yard-gate, or such-like Place; Or to stand grinning on a Glass, That tells us how our Minutes pass, I say, altho' you look much better, And are become a Span new Creature; Yet, in regard you've lately been So sick, so ghastly and so lean, Be careful after so much eating, You drink no more than what is fitting, Lest your Consumption, by your tipling, Should once more waste you to a Stripling. Husband. I thank you for your Care and Caution, I know 'tis for my Health's Promotion; Yet one kind Bumper would impart New Life and Comfort up my Heart, Make me as brisk, I dare to say, As Roger on his Wedding-Day. But I shall faint, my Dear, I vow, Unless you give it me just now. You see, alas, I droop apace, Only for want of t'other Glass. O! Dear, I sicker grow and sicker, Good Food, I find, requires good Liquor. Nay, fill it higher, for my Heart Is sick enough to drink a Quart. Wife. Here, take a Bumper, for I doubt You will relapse indeed without. I hope your Conscience will allow You've had a dose sufficient now. I'll swear, considering how ill You've been, you've a rare swallow still. Believe me, Honey, since you sicken'd, Your Brain, I find, is not much weaken'd, You've a rare Constitution really, You drink your Liquor off as freely As if you were not marr'd but mended By all the Sickness you pretended. So breeding Women, who complain Of qualmish Sickness, and of Pain, When once the Groaning Bout is o'er, Are better than they were before. Husband. Ah! Wife, I'm now a new-born Creature; This Glass has made me ten times better. I'm warm and well, upon my Word, As brisk and lively as a Bird: Had I but Pinions, I could fly; I'm now, methinks, all Life and Joy; I'm grown as strong as any Sampson, And plump and juicy as a Damson; This Night, I'm certain, I shall prove, When we're abed, all over Love: I'll swear Im strenuous, lusty, strong, Brisk, boyish, amorous and young, And were we now between the Sheets, I could, methinks do wond'rous Feats. I ne'er was better in my Life, This 'tis to have so kind a Wife; I owe it all to thee, my Joy, But I'll reward thee by and by. Wife. It is enough for me to hear You're grown so very brisk, my Dear; I'm glad I've lengthen'd out your Span, And made you such a vig'rous Man: I hope there's no ill Relicts in you, But that your Health may long continue. However, since your Heart's so light, And you are in so good a plight, Take t'other Glass of Cordial Red, To crown your Supper, so to Bed; For tho' my Physick's safe and sure, Tis Rest that must confirm the Cure; For all Distempers of the Brain, For want of Rest, return again, Husband. Dear Wife, this Cordial Red of yours Is worth a thousand other Cures; It is so sprightly and so charming, So comfortable and so warming, That I could drink, at least, a Quart, I'm sure, and do my self no hurt: Other Physicians Drams are loathsome, But thine, my Jewel, are so toothsome, And trickle down one's Throat so purely, That I could drink thy Doses hourly. The Doctor's Cordial he compounds Of stinking Herbs and Barrel-Grounds, Made sweet by Syrups and Molossos, Boil'd up by Galen's Virtuoso's; But the kind Cordial thou hast given, Drinks like the very Dew of Heaven. It runs through ev'ry Vein, I feel, And tickles me from Head to Heel Gives warmth and pleasure to my Brain, And makes me something more than Man. Ah! Wife, when we're in Bed you'll find, This Red will make me wond'rous kind. I'm grown a perfect Boy again, I've Youth, I find, in ev'ry Vein, And shall, my Dear, this Night repay All your past Kindness of the Day. Wife. You promise largely, but I fear 'Tis only in your Head, my Dear, I wish I could your Veins inspire, With as much Youth as you desire, And that you were as lusty grown, And Am'rous as at Twenty-one, I question not but it would be The better both for you and me; I'm glad you're such an alter'd Man, I hope to find you so, anon, And that these wicked Hags that ride you So oft, will now no more bestride you, But, prithee Dear, now you're so strong, So brisk, so airy, and so young, Let's go to Bed, whilst you're so hearty, And thus reduc'd to under thirty, For fear some Fantome should arise, And disappoint our promis'd Joys; For many things are apt to slip Between the Goblet and the Lip. Come, give's your Hand, now nothing ails you, Let's go before your Courage fails you. Don't talk so much, but do what's fitting, The Proof o'th' Pudding's in the eating. Husband. To Bed, come on, for I'm as free And forward as yourself can be: There's not one Part of me, I'll swear, But gladly wishes I was there; To be between the Sheets, I vow, Is all I want, I'm ready now, And in as kind and good a plight For Love, as on my Wedding-night. But, prithee, Honey, quench my Thirst, With t'other chearful Bumper first, 'Twould make my Nerves so strenuous grow, That I should kiss like any Beau, Twine round thee, like an Eel, all Night, And get a Boy before 'tis Light. Wife. My Dear, your talking gives me Proof, That you've already had enough; Your promis'd Bravery, alas! Proceeds from nothing but the Glass. The flowing Cup, you took but now, Has made you talk I know not how; And should you drink once more as full, You'd roar like any Parson's Bull, And prove so gamesome, that you'd be Too vig'rous and too brisk for me. However, if you'll walk up Stairs, Undress, and when you've said your Pray'rs, Just as you step to bed, I'll give you Another Bumper to revive you, And then, no doubt of't, but you'll prove, A perfect Hercules in Love, And do such mighty am'rous Feats, Ne'er done before between the Sheets Husband. A Match, my Dear, let's go this Minute, And hug and kiss till this day Sennight, For I can feel I am already A fit Gallant for any Lady; And t'other Glass, upon my Word, Will make me smuggl'ye like a Lord. Remember your Agreement, pray, A Bumper after Pray'rs, you say, Come, lend's your Hand, and lead me up, Ah! Child, 'twill be a glorious Cup, 'Twill make me sleep so purely a'ter, That I shall need no Poppy-Water. Wife. Come on, my Dear, I find already, The Wine has made you walk unsteady; The Weakness of your Hams discover You are a trusty strenuous Lover, I doubt your tott'ring and your stumbling, Presages only downright Fumbling. I'll keep my Word to you, my Dear, But you'll be worse than yours, I fear. [Aside.] Liquor will flatter Age, I find, And make 'em dream of being kind: But when they come to try their Pow'r, They only fumble by the Hour; And tho' they fancy that they please us, Their cool Attempts are but ro teaze us: However, she that's doom'd to wed An old dry Chip, to warm his Bed, Or has the rigid Fate to chuse A Fool or Mad-man for her Spouse, When join'd, 'tis better to obey, And humour Folly or Decay, Than rudely thwart them and despise Their unforeseen Infirmities. Moral Reflexions on the foregoing Dialogue. [If Beauty, for the sake of Wealth] If Beauty, for the sake of Wealth, Shall with a crazy Dotard join, When feeble Age impairs his Health, Her Vertues should the brighter shine. Since for her Int'rest she comply'd To wed, she should not prove a Teaze, But comfort, like a dutious Bride, Her Spouse, and study how to please. When knotty Age does peevish grow, The youthful Wife should condescend, An old tough Crabtree cannot bow, But a young Sprig may eas'ly bend. Besides, 'tis cruel to engage With Silver Hairs, for sake of Gold, And then despise him for his Age, Or slight his Love, because he's old. Grave Heads, and weak distemper'd Brains, Are better humour'd than withstood, And the young Wife, that takes the Pains To please 'em must be truly Good. But she that does her Spouse despise, 'Cause old; and slighting proves, or naught, Whene'er the aged Cuckold dies, He ought to leave her not a Groat. DIALOGUE VI. Between a Salacious Monarch, and his Barren Consort. Consort. Why, my good Liege, will you debase your Throne, And with ignoble Stains defile your Crown? Why tarnish all the Glories of your Reign, And let your Headstrong Lust your Laws prophane? Why in such Pomp and Equipage support Such Crowds of Harlots to disgrace your Court, And, in their Grandeur, let your Kingdom see, How much you value them, how little me? Monarch. Who'd be a Monarch that must reign in fear His Fav'rites should in publick Pomp appear? Let the Saints grin, and Faction roar aloud, Kings are above the Scandal of the Croud, What if we're am'rous, and to Love inclin'd, Monarchs should suit their Pleasures to their Mind; With Honours load those Beauties they adore, And sanctify their Vices by their Pow'r: Grandeur gives every thing a charming Face, We ought to favour those that we embrace; For Wealth and Title do the Kind protect From publick Scandal, and command Respect. When those are wanting, then the gen'rous Dame, When e'er she's known to sin, must blush for shame, Whilst her Grace passes in her stately Coach, From one stale Pleasure to a new Debauch, And brazens Envy, fearless of Reproach. Consort. But you too many Prostitutes approve, And are too lib'ral of your Royal Love, Lavish your Treasure to indulge your Sins, And starve your Friends t'enrich your Concubines, Such that are drawn from Playhouses and Stews, Of Mold too base for such a Prince's use, Meer Wantons, who can boast but slender Charms, And those defil'd, long since, by others Arms: Nor are they constant now to your Embrace, At least suspected to be false and base: Why therefore should you thus at large impart Your Royal Favours, where there's no Desert? Monarch. We value not so much the Face or Mein, But love those Merits that are most unseen, Which ne'er are boasted by the Female Race, But when they're search'd for in the proper place; Nor ever shewn but when the Fair exert Their Love, and then each condescending part Takes Pains to prove they're Women of Desert. Such, Madam, are the Ladies we admire, Who find new joyful Arts to quench Desire, And have a thousand Charms to Queens unknown, Worthy of his Embrace that rules a Throne: What tho' the Mold be coarse, the Surface mean, Poor Earth sometimes contains rich Mines within, Treasures unknown, that may reward the Toil Of only him that digs the charming Soil; Besides, tho' Woman cannot boast her Birth, Or vainly glory in her Parents worth, Yet Kings, by Honour, can refine her Blood, And make her Noble, tho' she's ne'er so sewd: 'Tis all a Jest, the diff'rence is so small 'Twixt City Dames and Ladies at White-hall, That thro' our whole Experience, we protest, We ne'er could tell whose Honour is the best. Consort You're now, my Liege, too jocular and free, Such droll'ry derogates from Majesty, My Birth and Station will not let me hear Such Talk, I humbly beg you to forbear; I only crave the freedom to report What Whispers I have heard around your Court, That your whole Kingdom is inflam'd to see Their Prince indulg'd in Vice and Luxury; Disturb'd to find your Treasure vainly spent, Design'd to serve the Ends of Government, T'enrich your craving Harlots, and advance The Pride of a young Wanton sent from France, Whilst your poor Friends of your Neglects complain; And hover daily round your Throne in vain. Monarch. These are the bell'wings of the factious Croud, Who love to roar against their King aloud, And, had they Pow'r, would gladly pull us down, Because they've spy'd a Cross upon our Crown. Or should we wave that frightful Popish Toy, And to take off the Christian Badge comply, They'd do the same for any other Reason why. None but the Saints should have the regale place, Because Dominion is founded in Grace. They only think that Kings usurp their Right, And therefore grin and murmur out of spight. Our Ears are deaf when Calvin's Tribe complains, Their Dog-star Zeal oft over-heats their Brains. Or do we fear their Leaders, who support Their Cause, and Buz their Malice thro' our Court. We watch their Motions, and have depth of Line, To fathom every bold and base Design: We know how far they have their Projects drove, And ev'ry secret Spring by which they move. Nor shall our Leisure-Pleasures or Amours, Made by our Foes their Coffee-House Discourse, Postpone our Care of Bus'ness, or prevent Our due regard to Regal Government: But they shall timely find they plot in vain, And that we still will Love as well as Reign, Consult our Joys, our Pleasures, and our Ease, Yet still be King and Honour whom we please. Consort. But Kings, my Liege, should good Examples give, And strictly up to Vertues Maxims live, Subdue their loose Desires, their Lusts command, Plant Piety, and, with a sacred Hand, Scatter the Seeds of Goodness thro' the Land; For 'tis from Thrones and Courts that Vices flow, Those that sit high corrupt the Croud below: The Frape will practice what the Great begin, And thus whole Nations are involv'd in Sin; Therefore it is, my Liege, that now I claim The modest Freedom of a Royal Dame, And beg you, as becomes your regal place, To throw those Wantons from your kind Embrace, Who drein your Treasure, scandalize your Throne, And make you the Lampoon of all the Town, Betray your Princely Conduct, and expose Your humane Frailties to your crafty Foes, Who with ill-natur'd Tongues your Vices tell, And ev'ry Mole-hill to a Mountain swell, Rail at th'indecent Liberties you take, And on your Failings base Reflections make, Excite your weaker Subjects to prophane The Name of King, and to reproach your Reign, Forgetting all the peaceful Joys they find Beneath a Prince so merciful and kind. Pray, Royal Sir, give Ear to my Discourse, And weigh the Scandal of your loose Amours; Consider what Reproach your Wantons bring Upon the Pow'r and Wisdom of a King, How their vain Pomp and ostentatious Pride, Anger your Subjects and the Land divide; How your own Freedoms teach the nobler Sort, To make a perfect Brothel of your Court; From whence their Vices like a Mist expand, And spread their Poyson thro' the sinful Land; Whilst those who wisely can delight their Souls With Vertues Precepts and Religious Rules, Upon the growing Evil cry out Shame, And on their King's Example charge the Blame. Monarch. Monarchs are Gods on Earth, ally'd to Heaven, And ought not to have Rules by Subjects given, Are born to govern, have a Right to chuse Those Pleasures they are most inclin'd to use; Such that are sinful in the servile Croud, And only to their sov'reign Lords allow'd, Who cannot Err, but when they circumvent The genuine Ends of lawful Government: 'Tis Insolence in Subjects to controul The Freedoms of a Prince that Rules the whole, In them 'tis petty Treason to reflect; Upon those secret Joys their Kings affect. Nor have they Cause to murmur or complain, If happy in their Monarch's peaceful Reign, Whilst with due Conduct he maintains his Trust, In him they're blest, and ought to think him Just. His private Failings, that alone relate To his own Pleasures, not the Publick State, Are Mysteries too daring and too dark, For Subjects, Slaves, or Servants to remark, They should lie hid from such inferior Eyes, Nor should they be expos'd to Factious Spies, But left to Heaven's Justice, who alone Has Right to censure those that Rule a Throne. Consort. But you, my Liege, so publickly expose Your carnal Pleasures to your factious Foes, That, without prying, they may see too plain Those obvious Errors that disgrace your Reign; The Prostitutes you favour are enough, Their costly Grandeur are sufficient Proof, That you indulge those Lusts you should subdue, And teach your am'rous Court to do so too; Therefore since you to Love are so inclin'd, And in your Harlots Arms such Pleasures find, That rather than discard them and reclaim, You'll chuse to suffer in your Royal Fame, Methinks, it would become your Princely Care, To keep your Joys more private than they are, And not in publick Splendor thus support A Crew of Wantons to degrade your Court. Princes, like Cloister'd Priests, should hide their Sins, And, in the Dark, embrace their Concubines: Not let their Friends or Fav'rites know what Nights They set apart for their obscene Delights, And by those Badges which their Harlots wear, Let the World see whose Prostitutes they are. When Kings debauch, they should the Curtain draw, And ne'er be seen to sin against the Law, Lest their indecent Freedoms should entice His flatt'ring Court to imitate his Vice, Who always practise what their Prince pursues, Or rail at Freedoms that they scorn to use. Monarch. But 'tis beneath a Gen'rous Prince to prove A Hypocrite to skreen his wanton Love; Tis a King's Glory that he dares be free, And none reprove him for his Liberty, And that he fears not to reward the Charms Of Beauty, that delight his Royal Arms, Or honour those engag'd in his Amours, That all may rev'rence whom the King adores. Princes, in publick manner, ought to shew Their kind Returns to secret Service due, For Royal Gratitude and Bounty shines Most bright i'th' Pomp of Friends and Concubines. Had you, fair Madam, to our Comfort been A Royal Mother, as a Pious Queen, Then should we justly have incurr'd your Blame, And the whole Land might our Amours condemn; But who, in vain, will till infertile Ground, Or thrum upon a Lute that yields no sound; Should Laws on Kings such hard Injunctions lay, Beggars and Slaves would happier be than they. All Men, by Nature, are inclin'd to see Their Image in a spritely Progeny: Why then should he that Governs be deny'd A fruitful Mistress, if his Royal Bride, Thro' some Defect, obstructs the noble End To which the Joys of Nuptial Love should tend. What Rural Slave would be content to sow Those hungry Acres where no Corn will grow? Why then should Royal Greatness be confin'd To barren Joys, ingrateful to the Mind, That's never truly pleas'd, but when it sees The End propos'd with ev'ry Act agrees? What Subject then can blame a Prince that flies A fruitless Bride for more effectual Joys, When if himself would make the Case his own, He'd do the same, and justify the Throne? Moral Reflexions on the foregoing Dialogue. [We ought in Modesty to spare] We ought in Modesty to spare Those bold Reflexions which we make On Kings, unless we could forbear Those Freedoms which our Rulers take. The greater Sinner oft condemns His Betters, and their Fame abuses; As the sly Prostitute exclaims Against the very Vice she uses. The Sot will publick Sentence pass On him that loves the Trick of Youth, When the worse Beast that hugs the Glass, Should clap his hand upon his Mouth. The sober Knave, that thrives by Fraud, Will rail at all expensive Vice, Yet for the sake of Gold, his God, He'll use a thousand Cheats and Lies. Therefore we ought to have a Care How we condemn, and how asperse, When our own Conscience knows we are As bad as those we blame, or worse. Besides, Revilings only shew Our want of Manners, and of Sense; We only are induc'd thereto, By Malice, Pride, or Ignorance. DIALOGUE VII. Between the surly Drunkard and the inflexible Termagant. Wife. So, you old Sot, is this an Hour To be heard Rapping at your Door? Must all the Neighbours break their Rest, To humour you, you drunken Beast? Is't not a Shame, at Twelve a Clock, To raise me starving in my Smock? Well may I Cough, you ugly Cur, Like an old Grannum of Fourscore, When I'm thus forc'd to come down barefoot, From my warm Bed, to the cold Stair-foot. Husband. You maund'ring Devil, hold your Tongue, Next time I'll tarry all Night long, If you can't ope the Door without All this confounded noisy Rout: What's that to you, how long I stay, My Time's my own, by Night or Day, And as I please, I'll always use it, When I've a fancy for't, abuse it; Therefore go up to Bed, I bid you, Lest something worse than Words betide you, For you shall get more good by holding Your Rattle, than by all your Scolding. Wife. I've cause to speak, you drunken Dog, Such Usage would provoke a Log; Nay, urge the very Walls to talk, Or the dumb Stones on which we walk, I think, you Rogue, I've giv'n you Proof Of a Wife's Patience long enough. I'm sure I'm never out of Reason, What I now say, I speak in Season. Ill Words, my Neighbours know, I scorn, But tread upon a Worm, 'twill turn. Is this a time of Night to come Damning, in Drink, and Swearing home, And to abuse an honest Woman, As if she was a Slut that's common? What Flesh can bear such Provocation, Without some shew of Heat and Passion? Husband. Thou teazing Hag, did I begin, Did you not raving let me in? Hussy, I find no Lye will choak ye, What did I say to first provoke ye? But 'tis your way to disagree, And then to lay the Blame on me, The Scold thinks always 'tis her Right, To first begin the verbal Fight, Then charges, when her Tongue grows weary, The Fault upon her Adversary. Wife. 'Tis false, you Hedgehog, did you not, First Swear, and call me God knows what? Accuse me of a thousand Failings, Provoke my Passion with your Railings, Tell me of this and t'other Blade, As if I'd been an arrant Jade, Foh! you old drunken fumbling Sot, That only hugs the Pipe and Pot. I'd have you know, tho' you're so jealous, I scorn your little nasty Fellows. I'd find, were I inclin'd that way, Other guess Sparks than you or they; Such that would scorn I should appear In that I now am forc'd to wear, But would be glad to let me go In my Lac'd-Shoes and Furbelo. I've had good Proffers in my Time, (The more Fool I to scorn the Crime,) From handsome Men, that lov'd me too, Who would have kinder prov'd than you: And rather than endure this Sorrow, You Sot, I'll horn your Brows to Morrow. Husband. The Devil's in the Woman sure, What Slave can such a Tongue endure? Nounds! Jealous of thy Beauty's Splendor, More ugly than the Witch of Endor; A scolding Harridan, that's near Her despicable Forti'th Year, Whose Hatchet Face has not a Feature But's mark'd with Envy and ill-nature; An arrant Slut, a wrangling Beast, Whose Tongue cannot a Moment rest, A hopeful Hag, I must agree, T'inspire a Man with Jealousie. Did I say any thing to shew My doubt of such a frightful Shrew, Or scatter any words distrustful, About your being Lewd or Lustful, Reflect upon your Sparks or Fellows, Or madly talk of being Jealous? Faith, my dear Dowdy, thou'rt mistaken, Thy Skin's too much like rusty Bacon, Too rancid and too old to be Fancy'd by any Fool but me. Wife. You Lye, you feeble Drone, you do, I'm handsom, young, kind-natur'd too, Too good for such a Rogue as you. I might have had, I'll make't appear, A Man of Twenty Pounds a Year, And like a Lady liv'd, before I marry'd you, you dirty Cur; And could have since, had I been willing, Earn'd many a Crown, and many a Shilling; Nay, Guineas, I might say, that's more, And yet not tell a Lye, I'm sure; But, Rogue, I scorn to play the Whore; Yet if you plague me thus, you Brute, It is enough to make me do't; For a good Woman may, by Passion, Be drove beyond her Inclination; Revenge may make a Vertuous Wife Do what she ne'er did in her Life, And cause her, when ill us'd, to doat on Some other Man she never thought on; Therefore, you fumbling Sot, take care, When drunk, you vex me not too far, For if you put me in a Rage, You Sot, I'll horn you in your Age. Husband. Nouns, go to Bed, you noisy Fool, Your Scut, by this time, may be cool; You've a great Heat upon you, sure, To talk thus in your Smock, an Hour: Just now you quarrell'd 'cause 'twas late, But you can still find time to prate. Get you to Bed, you teazing Witch, And warm you, now you've cool'd your Britch, Stand not here talking, till you frieze, O'th' Beauty of your ugly Phiz, At such a Midnight-Hour as this. I think 'tis time, you scolding Beast, Your Tongue and you were both at rest. Wife. I scold! What is it I have said? Tell me I scold, I'll break your Head. What a provoking Sot is this, To say I've spoke one Word amiss! Sirrah, have you not swore and ly'd, And falsly told me of my Pride, Accus'd my Innocence with Crimes, And call'd me Whore a thousand times; And must I stand, as if 'twas truth, Mute, with my Fingers in my Mouth? No, grinning Ape, you hooping Owl, I'll not be such a silent Fool: That's what you want, I know, to make me, But first I'll see you hang'd, Gad take me. Husband. You bawling, noisy Witch, who calls you Whore? why, what the Devil ails you? Thou'rt very honest, that I know, Thy Ugliness has kept thee so; Thy Vertue has been much beholding To thy Face, Temper, and thy Scolding: From the Horn-plague I am secure, But curs'd with all the rest I'm sure; Such so tormenting and perplexing, So irritating and so vexing, That would make any Mortal fly From such a barren Beast, but I. Wife. 'Tis your own Fault, you Villain, no Man, But you would thus abuse a Woman. I'll bear with such Affronts no longer, I'll try, you Rascal, who's the stronger. Take that, you Rogue,—O! Murder, Murder, I'll make you keep your Tongue in order. Husband. Be quiet, Hussy, are you mad, Let go my Hair, you cursed Jade. What! do you scratch me too, you Witch, Take that, you bold rebellious B? Wife. O Murder! Dog, I'll make you feel me. Help, Neighbours, or the Rogue will kill me. O help!—I'll fight whilst I have Life. Ah! cow'rdly Whelp, to strike a Wife. Husband. Confound your Claws, must I sit still, You Beast, and let you have your Will? Must I submit to such a Shrew, To have my Eyes torn out by you, And to be lug'd from out my Chair, With all your Fury, by the Hair? Did you not first, with Tooth and Tallon, Draw Blood, e'er I began to fall on? Wife. O! wicked Wretch, to falsly say, Alas! that I began the Fray, Did you not kick me, like a Dog, And call me barren Beast, you Rogue? A Word that no ill-natur'd Looby Wou'd give a Wife, but you, you Booby. Did you not strike me, like a Villain, Upon the Breast, enough to kill one? O! how it does both throb and smart, It pains me to the very Heart: F'r ought I know I am ruin'd by't, I shall not sleep one Wink to Night. O! how my belly pains me too, I've a Kick somewhere I shall rue; Your Knee or Foot has hurt me, Sirrah, Where you'll repent it by to Morrow. Husband. Thou lying Devil of a Wife, I never kick'd thee in my Life; But if I stay much longer here, Thou wilt provoke me to't, I fear; Thy Tongue will but engage me further, And then, perhaps, there may be Murther: So good Night, Beldam, I'll to Bed, With my scratch'd Face and broken Head; Those honourable Nuptial Scars, And leave thee, now we've done our Wars, To cool thy Passion and thy A?se Wife by herself. I'm glad the Dog's crept up to Kennel, I'll make him humble as a Spaniel; I'll not be Friends till he shall court me, I know the Rogue believes he'as hurt me, When as I live I do not know In all the Scuffle I'd a Blow: Nor now it's over, do I feel One Scratch or Bruise from Head to Heel; However, I must cry to Morrow, And tell my Neighbours all my Sorrow, Complain how sadly he abus'd me, And how he kick'd me and misus'd me; Tell 'em what Pains I took to please him, But could not for my Soul appease him; Charge all the Blame on him, and spill My Tears, like any Crocodile: I vow and swear it joys my Heart To think how I shall play my part, How the old Buck will be outwitted, And his poor Wife bemoan'd and pity'd. Women are Fools that let their Spouses Usurp Dominion in their Houses: The cunning Dame may find a way, To eas'ly make her Man obey. If she in any Case would gain Her Point, she only need complain, For tho' the Husband be bely'd, The World will be o'th' Woman's side. Moral Reflexions on the foregoing Dialogue. [When a join'd Couple live at strife] When a join'd Couple live at strife, And ev'ly exercise the Tongue, 'Tis hard to judge 'twixt Man and Wife, Which of the two are in the wrong. A prudent Husband should not speak To raise a Shrew's provoking Noise, Because her Clamour shews him weak, In making such an evil Choice. The Man should own the Fault is his, To save the Credit of his Bride; And when she talks, or does amiss, Should all her Slips and Failings hide. For tho' the Husband should complain, And set forth his unhappy Life, The World would still condemn the Man, And labour to excuse the Wife. He therefore that has had the Curse To wed a Shrew that wont obey, By railing makes his Cause but worse, To please her is the only way. Woman, when stirr'd, is like a Bell, Her Clapper is as loosely hung, And he that's wedded to her Tail, Must bear the Torment of her Tongue. DIALOGUE VIII. Between King Avery, the Pirate, and his Indian Prineess at Madagascar. King. How fares my charming Dear? why al-la-mort? Your Grief diffuses Sadness thro' my Court. Am I not Grateful, Generous, and Kind? What secret Cause of Sorrow do you find? Have you not Crowds of list'ning Slaves to wait Your Call, and Guards t'attend you at your Gate? Is not your Table, as becomes your Birth, Spread with the richest Products of the Earth? Are not your publick Robes, or private Dress, Fit to adorn that Beauty you possess? Have not your Princely Arms a sprightly Boy, To dearly hug, and crown your Nuptial Joy? Are you not Partner in a Royal Throne, Made, by my Toils and Fortitude, our own? Are you not fix'd in Power, safe in Love, Obey'd and homag'd wheresoe'er you move? What causeless Doubts can then your Soul ensnare. And cloud your Princely Thoughts with groundless Care. Princess. All you have nam'd I own that I possess, But still might be more happy had I less. What tho', by your Consent, I share a Throne, I'm still a Prisoner in a Land unknown? Fetter'd amidst the Pomps and Joys of Life, And but a Slave, although a lawful Wife; A Captive, forc'd by Danger to comply With what my Female Fears durst not deny; Debar'd of Friends, and from my Native Soil Chain'd for my Life, within a barb'rous Isle. How then can I subsist without remorse, Since all my Joys are the effects of Force? Or how, without gross Flattery, applaud A doubtful State that's founded upon Fraud. King. These are all Bugbears in the Brain, begot By Female Weakness and distemper'd Thought. What you call Fraud is but the Right of Pow'r, By which the Brave to Crowns and Scepters tow'r. Conquest has always been a sov'reign Law, It is the Sword that does the Subject awe, Whether 'tis that of Justice or of War, Both, when attended with Success, concur. Good Fortune 'tis alone that turns the Scale, And makes the heavier o'er the light prevail. Why think you then the Throne that I command Does tott'ring on a feeble Basis stand, Since I have Crowds of Slaves, and Mines of Gold, To still support us in the Pow'r we hold? Nor need we fear to be by Foes o'erthrown, Whilst those true Friends make Sov'reign Rule our own. The Right of Kings depends upon the Sword, The Conqu'rer always is the rightful Lord, And whenso'er a Monarch's Title's try'd, The longest Weapon does the Cause decide. The Brave at mouldy old Succession laugh, Conquest gives Right, and Power makes us safe; Therefore, fair Princess, grieve no more in vain, I've Arms to keep what I had Strength to gain. Suppose the Persian Lord had been possest Of your dear Charms, with which I now am blest, He, who with joyful Heart, and wishing Eyes, Stood ready to receive the glorious Prize, Might have been happier in your soft Embrace, Than in the want of so divine a Face; But you, of equal Glory now possest, May, if you please, be full as highly blest. In the kind Arms of the chance Spouse you have, Who is as Rich, as Pow'rful, and as Brave, As much to Love and Gallantry inclin'd, As that Great Prince for whom you were design'd. Nay, you have Cause to entertain a Thought, That Disappointment prov'd your better Lot; For had your Match succeeded, you had been Only a Subject-Princess, not a Queen: But now, with me, you share a Sov'reign Sway, And the whole Land our awful Nods obey. Nor are you distanc'd from your native Friends, Your old Retinue still your Will attends, They wait your Pleasure ev'ry Hour at Court, And wheresoe'er your Presence moves, resort; Study to win your Smiles, and to remove The faint Relapses of your former Love, Perswade you to conceive your present State To be your best Good-Fortune, not your Fate; Since all these Blessings you enjoy in Peace, Why do you grieve amidst such Happiness, As if my Love, though shewn to an Extream, Was much too low to merit your Esteem. Princess. I'm bound to love and honour you, I own, For all the gentle Favours you have shown, And that you waited my Consent to wed, When in your Pow'r to force me to your Bed; It was a great and gen'rous Act to save A Princess Honour, when your Captive Slave, A Deed of humane Mercy, that will crown The greatest Glories that your Sword has won, A kind Forbearance, that in time will make Your Fame more bright, your Pyracies less black, And for those rash Severities atone, That in your bold Adventures must be shown; For lawless Acts of Violence cannot be Successful, but by Blood and Cruelty: But still, tho' you were mild, and wav'd that Pow'r. Which chains the Captive to the Conqueror, And kindly took me as your lawful Wife, To save my Honour, dearer than my Life, Yet amidst all my Comforts must I mourn, To think I'm thus become my Country's Scorn, And that for ever I must live constrain'd, A banish'd Stranger to my native Land; Woman's to Fondness prone, and cannot take A final Farewel, but she must look back. The Eagle, tho' he wanders in his Flight, And labours to out-soar the God of Light, Yet when he's tir'd, he turns his drooping Head T'wards the tall Rocks, where he at first was bred, With eager haste does homewards gladly fly, Perches aloft, and claps his Wings for Joy. The wand'ring Tides, that flood the neighb'ring Grounds, Return again into their native Bounds; The very Stars still circle in the Sphere Where the bright Lamps first constituted were: The Needle points to its beloved North, The very Brute affects his Place of Birth; All Creatures are by Nature prompt to love The Land, that does their native Country prove, But I, unhappy Wretch, must ne'er return, To see the distant Shore, where I was born, But fetter'd to a Throne, indulge Despair, And weep away my Youth, I know not where. So the poor Lamb, beneath the Lyon's Paw, Tho' stroak'd and fondl'd, wishes to withdraw Into the safer Meadows; for the Pow'r That can protect when pleas'd, when angry can devour. King. But I, amidst my Fury, was too tame To injure or oppress so fair a Dame; Such Youth and Beauty always charm the Brave, And make the boldest Victor but your Slave: If from your Fears your Discontents arise, My Love shall turn your Sadness into Joys; My tender Usage shall alone convince, I cannot hurt your charming Innocence: But if you grieve, and sigh in vain to see The much worse Land of your Nativity, Like the poor dastard Wretch, you pine at Fate, And from your Princely Nature derogate. Consider, Madam, your illustrious Birth, Your Royal Blood, your Greatness and your Worth That from the Loins of Aurenzebe you came, And ought to center all your Thoughts in Fame, Make Glory your Pursuit, and mighty Deeds your Aim It is beneath the Noble and the Great, To tamely suffer Sorrows gauling weight; Or, Caitiff like, to be abroad o'ercome, When Happy, with the fond desire of Home; The Brave such servile Passions should despise, And love that Ground where they can highest rise; Not, like poor Slaves, chuse rather to obey At Home, than climb Abroad to Sov'reign Sway. What tho' the cow'rdly Ox delights to graze Upon his native Meadow all his Days, And to the Yoak submits his armed Crest, Rather than Goar the Swain that owns the Beast. What tho' the Horse does foolishly submit To bear the Saddle, and to champ the Bit, And when his Journey or his Labour's o'er, Gladly returns to his old Stable-Door: But these are Brutes, who are, by Stripes severe, Train'd up, when young, to Cowardice and Fear, Who love the Rack and Manger where they're bred, Or native Fields, because they there are fed; For Beasts on Earth enjoy no other good, Than the dull relish of their husky Food. But nobler Man is of a Race divine, By Nature does to glorious Deeds incline, And still the nearer to the Gods shall be The more he shifts off his Brutality. Who then would to their native Soil be ty'd, Where they must bend and cringe to others Pride, Like a Mill-Horse, within one Circle move, And on their Country fix a slavish Love, When far from home they may as great be made, As the proud Tyrant they before obey'd. Therefore forbear, dear Madam, grieve no more, Withdraw your Fondness from your native Shore; The Great should curb their Passions, and postpone All Friendship, Love, and Duty for a Throne; Forsake their Parents, Relatives, and Friends, T'extend their Pow'r, and gain their glorious Ends. What Woman who has Birth and Beauty too, With many Charms and Vertues blest, like you, Would not with Joy abandon all that's dear, To shine aloft in a majestick Sphere, And rather chuse to be, if truly Brave, A Foreign Queen, than a Domestick Slave. Princess. I've heard, my Liege, the Arguments you raise, But your own Weakness your Advice betrays, And only shews, that you desire to make Me easy by those Rules you cannot take. How oft have I, as lying by your Side, Found by your Sighs your Soul dissatisfy'd? Have I not heard you feelingly express Your Native Country's Worth and Happiness, Set forth the Plenty of its fertile Soil, Extol the various Pleasures of the Isle, Commend its Climate, magnify its Queen, And sighing say, how blest you might have been, Applaud the Beauty of the Charming Fair, How kind they prove, what costly Robes they wear, Declare the Justice of the Western Race, What Ills they punish, and what Wrongs redress, Approve the Laws that do the base restrain, And tell what Vices thrive, what Vertues reign. Thus praise the fruitful Land that gave you Birth, As if, at least, it was a Heav'n on Earth; Then hug me close, and sighing cry, my Dear, I wish we were the meanest Subjects there, Provided I once more might safely boast, That happy Freedom I've for ever lost. Therefore since you, more masculine and bold, So Great in Power, and so Rich in Gold, Can break your Rest, upon your Pillow mourn, Cause rigid Laws debar your safe return, Seem willing to resign your high Command, To dig your Grave within your Native Land, How can you blame weak Woman for her Tears, When Force confirms her Fetters and her Fears, Keeps her Exil'd by a severe Restraint, Equal to you perpetual Banishment. What signifies the Sov'reign Sway we boast, Since Pow'r is in the want of Freedom lost? What can be greater Slav'ry to the Brave, Than still to wish for what we ne'er can have? Tis a severe Compulsion to refrain The only Bliss we covet to obtain. The humble Slave or Subject may rejoice, That freely makes his Servitude his Choice, Whilst we, who're fetter'd to a Throne we hate, Are still but wretched, tho' we're ne'er so Great. None e'er could find a relish in their Meat, If bound against their Appetites to eat; The greatest Blessings upon Earth enjoy'd, When forc'd upon the Will are quite destroy'd; Nor are we blest in what our Toils acquire, Other than by the strength of our Desire; 'Tis our free Choice that heightens the acquest, Our Approbation only makes us blest; Therefore, alas, how wretched must we be, Who Reign o'er Slaves, thro' meer Necessity, Would both, with Joy, resign the Pow'r we hold, To buy our Native Freedom with our Gold, Fly from the Throne wherein we're both accurst, And gladly would be Subjects, if we durst. King. I own you've hit the Point wherein we fail, In spite of Wisdom Nature will prevail, I have unjustly blam'd your wav'ring Mind, For the same Weakness in my self I find. I cannot think upon the British Isles, Happy in Nature's Gifts and Heaven's Smiles, But I must still remember I was born In Albion, thither gladly would return, And where I first took Breath, erect my Marble Urn So wand'ring Travellers, who range the Seas, To satisfy their vain Curiosities, And in strange Climates beat the dusty Road, To see how Art and Nature thrive abroad; Tho' they applaud old Egypt's fruitful Fields, And praise the lushious Grain that Persia yields, Extol the Charms of the Venetian Fair, Commend this Country for a healthful Air, That for its dainty Fruits and noble Wines, Another for its Drugs and wealthy Mines; Yet no Temptation that adorns the way, Can make them long, without Reluctance, stay. Thus, tho' Abroad a thousand Joys we find, Our Native Home's the Center of the Mind, We still look back on what we first possest, Like unwean'd Children on their Mother's Breast. Princess. But since our Minds to diff'rent Worlds incline How in one happy Medium shall we join, You to the Western are by Nature bent, And I, alas, to th'Eastern Continent? How then together, should you pardon'd be, Can both enjoy our wish'd Felicity? In Climes remote I still must spend my Days, Unless we part, and chuse our diff'rent ways. King. What tho' I wish to see my Native Shore, 'Tis without Hopes that Blessing I implore, My Safety does that happy Sight forbid, The Laws of Nations my Return impede; Therefore since thus imprison'd by the Seas To our own Prudence we must owe our Ease, By Patience keep our Minds from Sorrows free, And make a Vertue of Necessity, Look only forward, study to improve Our mutual Happiness by mutual Love, O'erpow'r weak Nature, learn to be Content, And manage well our present Government, That Fondness wave which does our Peace annoy, And only think of what we here enjoy; For those who much possess, and still will crave What's needless, are but curs'd with what they have, Then let's correct our Minds, and think no more Of either Persian or of British Shore, But make ourselves as happy and secure, As distant Tyrants that despise our Pow'r, Be proud to think we may with Conduct be The Builders of a lasting Monarchy, And that a Royal Issue of our own, May long succeed in our Establish'd Throne. Then chear up, Madam, 'tis a Crime to grieve, For what the angry Gods refuse to give; Against our Fate 'tis Folly to complain, Why should we, since we here may Live and Reign, In spite of all the World, bear Sov'reign Sway, Like Kings and Sultans make our Slaves obey, And grow, in time, as powerful as they. Moral Reflexions on the foregoing Dialogue. No Blessings are so much desir'd As awful Pow'r and mighty Wealth, Yet they're but Curses when acquir'd By Usurpation, Fraud, or Stealth. Had Man's Ambition Eyes to see The Train of Mischiefs that attend On all successful Villany, They'd weep when they had gain'd their End. Blush at the sanguine Ills they've done, Reflect with Terror on their Guilt, Curse the base Greatness they have won, And tremble at the Blood they've spilt. Well may the Tyrant who, by Arms, Usurps another's Lawful Crown, Depend, for Ease, upon the Charms Of Flatt'rers that surround his Throne. For should not Knaves approve his Right, And give false Glory to his Force, The haughty Bugbear would, in spight Of Grandeur, sink beneath Remorse. Well may ill-govern'd Slaves contend, When by their Ruling Lords opprest, Since Power is oft unjustly gain'd, And therefore is so seldom Blest. DIALOGUE IX. Between an old amorous Knight, and a young Strumpet he was drawn in to marry, just come out of Yorkshire, to take a view of the Town. Husband. Well, now, my Dear, I think we've spent A Week in Love and Merriment; In a few Days we'll e'en set forward Our tedious Journey to the Norward, To view your Lands, and take Possession Of your Estate and Habitation; And if I find the Place is airy And healthful, we'll resolve to tarry. New furbish up the ancient Hall, And settle there for good and all: You say there's Hunting, Fishing, Fowling, And a rare spacious Green for Bowling, Hare, Partridge, every sort of Game About your Grounds, that I can name: By your Account, it needs must be A Seat of wond'rous Pleasantry. One thing indeed I can't approve, But that I eas'ly can remove, Which is the Rook'ry that's about it, I own I'd rather be without it, I hate their hoarse ill-boding Voice, And cannot bear their croaking Noise, But wake when they begin to chatter, And yawn and stretch the whole Day a'ter. Lady. If nothing but the Rooks displease ye, They're soon destroy'd, to make you easy. I wish, my Dear, that you way find The House and Gardens suit your Mind; And that its lonely Situation May justly claim your Approbation: But, truly, I am apt to fear, When you see how it is, and where, You'll think your Quality too great For such a Mansion and Estate, Because it has been farm'd by two Or three of meaner Rank than you: I therefore fear you'll not consent, T'inhabit such a Tenement, That has, for Years, to the Dishonour Of me, that am the rightful Owner, Been occupy'd for little Rent, By Persons of a low Descent. Husband. Dear Madam, my intire Affection For you, will conquer that Objection; I shan't despise your Mansion-house, 'Cause farm'd by Roger and Joan Douse: It is enough for me to love it, That you were born there and approve it; We must not with Contempt, look down On Earth, 'cause trodden by the Clown; Frown on the fruitful Vale or Plain, Because frequented by the Swain; Or scorn the rich and dirty Field, That's by the sweaty Peasant till'd; No, no, if I but like the Seat, And find it for our Dwelling fit, I shall not scruple or complain on't, Because a Clown has been the Tenant; To me, that shall not make it odious, In case I find it but commodious. Perhaps it may be old and tatter'd, With stormy Winds and Weather batter'd, The Stable-Yards been us'd to hold Dung-heaps, which Farmers call their Gold, Yet all such Filth may be remov'd, And the House furbish'd and improv'd, And if too small, be made more large, Though I must own 'twill be a Charge; But shall not value what I spend, To such a satisfact'ry End, If all will but oblige my Dear, And make her easy when she's there; For who that's blest with such a Creature, So kind, so young, so fair of Feature, Would not do any thing to shew His Love to such a Bride as you. Lady. You're very kind, I must allow, Would you be always as you're now, But Time will change your Inclination, And make, I fear, much Alteration; For Beauty, once a Lover's own, Becomes insipid when she's known, And all her soft obliging Charms Grow stale and rancid in his Arms: I fear your Love, that seems so great, Is not for me, but my Estate; Fat Acres and full Bags engage The most, in this ungen'rous Age; And she that has them in her Pow'r, May have new Courtiers ev'ry Hour: So he that's Rich, and can defend Himself, shall never want a Friend; But if Misfortunes bring him low, His Friends will be no longer so. Had I without a Fortune been, And my Descent obscure and mean, Yet made the very self-same Figure, In Dress, in Beauty, Youth, and Vigour, I fancy then you'd scarce have thought me Worthy o'th' Bed to which you've brought me; For had your Bride had no Command Of mouldy Bags and dirty Land, For all her Charms you'd not have lik'd her, 'Twas the gilt Frame set off the Picture. So when the Croud behold the State And pompous Grandeur of the Great, 'Tis not their Persons that they mind, But the long Train that come behind; Thus think our Quality's Transcendence, Is not in them, but their Attendance. Husband. But for your Charms, my Dear, I love you, Your Beauty made me first approve you; Twas not your Riches, but your Face, Your Acres, but each charming Grace, That did alone my Soul bewitch, And rais'd my Flame to such a pitch; I'm no such Muckworm in my Nature, To prefer Wealth to such a Creature; I vow I did not doat upon ye, For your black Furlongs, or your Money; The Gifts that dwell in ev'ry Part Enchanted my admiring Heart: No Blessing but yourself I wanted, And those dear Favours you have granted: Had you been Fortuneless, my Flame, I'm certain, must have been the same; I'd still paid Homage to your Beauty; Nor could I have been blest without ye: Such lovely Charms as you possess, Are of themselves a Happiness: Such Eyes no other Fortune need, Those Looks the brightest Gold exceed, But since your Stars, their Love to shew, Have giv'n you Health and Beauty too, And I am made, by your kind Choice, The Partner of such double Joys, Riches with Beauty, I agree, Still heightens the Felicity; Tho' had you not a Groat, I own I had been blest in you alone; For Love, like Madness, many grant, Ne'er feels the Smart of Cold or Want, But will, if Just, the noble Flame, Like Gold refin'd, be still the same. Lady. Then you are sure you shou'd have lov'd, In case I had no Heiress prov'd, And that alone my Person won ye, And not my Acres or my Money; I must confess, could I be certain You lov'd my Charms above my Fortune, Such real uncorrupt Affection Would give me wond'rous Satisfaction; For I am apt to think, most Men That marry, have an Eye on Gain, And that, among your Sex, 'tis common T'admire the Bags above the Woman. 'Tis therefore difficult for me, To think your Generosity So great, to've taken to your Arms A Country Damsel for her Charms, Had you not been assur'd before, She'd a large Fortune in her Pow'r; For Beauty, without Bags we find, You men of Wisdom seldom mind, When Gold will make the dowdy Lass, Without the least Objection, pass. Husband. I vow and swear, my only Dear, Those Charms that in your Looks appear; Your pleasant Air, your modest Mein, Your Prudence in each Action seen, Your Conversation, that's so witty, Your ev'ry thing so sweet and pretty, Are Blessings that engage my Heart, Your Fortune is the meanest part; I scarce have spent one Thought about it, I have enough, my Dear, without it, And should have lov'd you, tho' you'd been Unhappy, Fortuneless, and Mean, And for your Beauty, would have made ye My Bride, my only Dear, my Lady. Lady. I'm highly happy, that I find Your Heart so generously kind, And that your Love would be as great, If I'd no Portion or Estate. Husband. All one, my Jewel, I profess Nothing could make me love you less. My faithful Passion is not founded Upon your Wealth, but nobly grounded, And will be lasting, you shall see, In spite of all Adversity. No sullen Clouds, that can arise, Shall darken or eclipse our Joys: My Love its nuptial Course shall run, And prove as constant as the Sun; Be lasting, just, and always free From cold Neglect and Jealousy. Lady. You promise very fair, my Dear, Yet I, alas! am apt to fear, If my Estate should chance to prove A Shadow, 'twould subvert your Love, And make my Dearest look awry Upon me with an evil Eye; For disappointed Lovers change Affection oft into Revenge. So he that weds, and thinks he marries, A mighty Fortune, and miscarries, He does his Bride, tho' fair, despise, Because no wealthy Bags arise. Husband. But this no Parallel can be To th'present Case 'twixt you and me. I know your Fortune's out of Doubt; Your Lands admit of no Dispute: I have no Reason to distrust Your Title, for I'm sure 'tis just; Have all the Deeds that bear Relation To your Estate, in my Possession; But were your Charms without that Worth Your Writings plainly do set forth, Yet still, my dearest Duck, my Lamb, I'd be as loving as I am; Your Beauty would alone prevail With me, in case your Lands should fail: But I'm well satisfy'd no harm Can lurk in such a heav'nly Form; Your Angel's Face convinces me You are what you pretend to be; But should your Wealth a Fiction prove, Your Charms would still preserve my Love. Lady. I'm glad to hear it; for I vow All that I'm worth's about me now: Give me, my Dear, one kind Embrace, And you my whole Estate possess. With folded Arms you may, God knows, My Lands and Tenements inclose: I have no Bags of hoarded Gold; No Sums of tarnish'd Coin untold; No fruitful Grounds to please your Sight, But what you plough'd the nuptial Night; No Mansion-house, or Farm beside, But you've already occupy'd; No costly Garden for your Pleasure, But what your self may sow at leisure: I have no Wealth but what you see; You have my whole Estate in me. Husband. I'll swear you are a merry Lady, You banter well, whoever bred ye; I find you only want to try My Temper and Sincerity, And whether that my Love's as true, As I've aver'd it is to you. You may jest on, but still shall find Your Frolick cannot change my Mind: I have too great a Passion for ye, Than to give Ear to such a Story: You may use twenty Whims like these, And try me farther, if you please, But all your Wit won't damp my Flame; You'll ever find my Love the same. Lady. I'm glad with all my Heart, to hear Your Kindness is so great, my Dear, That whatsoe'er I chance to prove, 'Twill no Ways disoblige your Love: But really I'd not have you flatter Your self with what's to come herea'ter; For here's my All, and, to be plain, Your farther Hopes are but in vain. The whole of my poor narrow Fortune, Will lie within the nuptial Curtain; You've had it all, I do protest, Between the Sheets, and you know best The Worth of what you have possest. Believe me, Sir; for, by my Life, You've nothing with me, but a Wife; I'm therefore glad to hear my Charms Alone have won you to my Arms, And that your Love will still be steady, Tho' disappointed by your Lady. Beauty alone deserves the Favour, And true Esteem of those that have her: She's a sweet Blessing of her self, Tho' she can boast no Bags of Pelf; That's a small Fault, a Man of Honour Will scorn to look the worse upon her. Husband. How can your Tongue such Stories tell? I'll swear you humour't mighty well. You do't as prettily, my Dear, As if bred up in Theatre, Enough to make my Hopes give Way, And my self credit what you say; But that, alas! I know you better, And am assur'd you're no such Creature. You may jest on, but you forget I've got the Deeds of your Estate; I've all your Writings, I am safe, Your Banter only makes me laugh. Besides, I've had, from sev'ral Hands, A good Account of all your Lands; Know every Tittle of your Fortune, What's doubtful, and what's truly certain; To think what pretty Tales you make, What Wit you shew, what Pains you take To try your Husband and your Lover, In hopes to cunningly discover Which is most welcome to his Arms, Your Fortune, or your youthful Charms; But I assure you, still the latter Is the dear Blessing I sought a'ter; Tho' a good Dowry, I confess, Adds something to the Happiness, Because the richer still we be, The more secure from Poverty. Lady. Dream as you please of Golden Joys, And think you've made a wealthy Choice; But, as I live, at last you'll find Your Hopes all vanish into Wind; For all those Writings you have seen, Were only forg'd to draw you in; And, in Reality, relate To nothing but a feign'd Estate; Fat Acres floating in the Air, And mighty Sums, the Lord knows where; A Mansion lin'd with costly Goods, Built only in the misty Clouds; Rich Farms and Tenements that lie In remote Corners of the Sky, So far behind the Light, I doubt, Flamstead himself can't find 'em out: And this, by all the Charms of Youth And Beauty, I aver for Truth; I therefore beg you'll not deceive Your self, but what I say, believe, And not depend on idle Fancies, For all my Writings are Romances, Contriv'd by cunning Heads to gain me A Husband, able to maintain me; And since 'twas your unhappy Lot To be the Gudgeon to be caught, I humbly beg you to be easy; For if my Person will not please ye, I have no Lands to mend the Matter, Nor Bags to make your Bargain better. This is the Case most truly stated, And ev'ry Tittle I've related, Is Truth, I swear, upon my Knees, So now deal with me as you please. Husband. I am amaz'd! And can there be So beautiful a Snake as thee? O! Jilt, am I at last out-witted, Betray'd, impos'd upon, and cheated; Tempted to take a wicked, frail, Alluring Serpent by the Tail; And hug the Vermin that has bit The loving Hand that cherish'd it? How could your list'ning treach'rous Ear. My Love, with seeming Pleasure, hear; And your base Tongue conceal the while The Drift of all your crafty Guile? Had you had Gratitude or Honour, You'd told me your Condition sooner, And made me sensible before Our Marriage, of your windy Dow'r, And not have put this Trick upon me. Why, Hussy, you have quite undone me: My Estate's mortgag'd, I aver it, And with your Fortune hop'd to clear it; But now, instead of that, I'm worse By wedding such a Female Curse, That has more Coney-skin than Purse: Nor are your self, you wicked Creature, By your Deceit, a Jot the Better. Lady. Yes, I'm a Lady, by your Favour; That's something I have gain'd however; But had I been what you suppos'd, I find I had been finely noos'd To an old surfeited Debauch, A beggar'd Knight without a Coach; A Fumbler with a dipt Estate! I vow and swear a hopeful Mate For a rich Heiress full of Charms, To chuse into her youthful Arms. No: had I been that happy She, Your Worship took me first to be, You should have been no Match for me. But where's your mighty Love, my Dear? Your am'rous Passion cools, I fear; Your everlasting Kindness now Seems wither'd like a Winter's Bough. One sudden unexpected Puff Has blown your Flame into a Snuff, Extinguish'd that robust Desire, And caus'd that never-cooling Fire, That whiz'd of late like mounting Rocket, To burn like Candle in the Socket. Husband. Fly from me, Jezabel, to ease me, And now you've chous'd me, do not tease me. What mortal Man can love a Jade, A Jilt, by whom he's thus betray'd; A German Princess, and, no Doubt, A Slut, an arrand Whore to boot, Whose lustful mercenary Tail is The cast-off Curse of Pimps and Baylies? And I, forsooth, must prove the Fool, Mark'd out to honour such a Trull; And tho' you've been debas'd already By hundreds, must be call'd my Lady! You Strumpet, get you from my Sight, I hate you, as an Owl the Light. You teasing, prating Spawn of Evil; You cunning, pretty Toad; you Devil; You cheating Minx, I'll never own ye; I'll have no Wife that has no Money. You're some Bawd's Daughter, or as bad; Huzzy, you've made me raving mad; More frantick than a dancing Bear; My Reason's flown I know not where. Get thee, I say, from out my Reach, Or I shall scratch thee for a Witch: I'm by your Sorcery enchanted, Hag-ridden, plagu'd, tormented, haunted; And shall, unless you fly the Place, Spit Pins and Needles in thy Face. Lady. Well said, my Dear, I'm now assur'd You've a great Value for your Word, And that my Beauty was the Bait That tempted more than my Estate. O! what a Passion you have for me! How much you love me, and adore me! Tho' disappointed of the Rents Of my fat Lands and Tenements, And find my Fortune is so small, That your own Hand may cover't all, Yet, how your am'rous Flame continues To chear your Heart and warm your Sinews! What due Respect! how much good Nature You shew to your dear charming Creature! Your pretty Phubs, your Duck, your Jewel, Whose pow'rful Charms, had she been cruel, Had kill'd you with their Darts out-right, And martyr'd her enamour'd Knight. poor Gentleman! had I not lov'd, How fatal must my Scorn have prov'd? But what coy Dame could take upon her To slight so brave a Man of Honour, And with a cross disdainful Frown, Doom him to stab, to hang, or drown, When his pure Love was so refin'd, His Tongue so true, his Heart so kind, That he despis'd ignoble Dross, And valu'd nothing but the Lass, For her sweet Temper, and her Beauty, And something else above the Shoe-tie? Husband. O! Impudence, to thus upbraid me, When your vile Cunning has betray'd me. What wanton Sorc'ress have I wedded? What Beggar hugg'd? What Strumpet bedded? Some Shoplift, full of Tricks and Wiles, Perhaps bred up in sweet St. Giles; Or some expert Town-trading Quane, Begot and nurs'd in Water-Lane, Who has, for Years, along the Side Of Holbourn-Ditch, and Fleet-street ply'd; I'll swear a very hopeful Bride! A modest pretty Lady, truly, Kick'd from the Arms of some Town-bully, Just piping-hot, perhaps from Stews, As fine a Match as Man would chuse! What a sweet Bargain have I got, And may be pox'd, as like as not? O! thou confounded common Witch, If 'twan't for Shame, I'd call you B?. Must I by your lewd Tail, be brought To Flannel-Shirt, and Spitting-Pot? Be gone, I say, or I shall thumb Your Trollilols, and foot your Bum: Bid my Man turn you out of Door; And, Slut, if e're you own me more, I'll cry aloud, a Whore, a Whore. Lady. Indeed, Sir Samuel, if you do, I'll cry out Cuckold, Cuckold too. However, since your Spleen's so high, I'll quit your Room till by and by, And give your Passion time to cool, That Reason may again bear Rule. But still remember I'm your Wife, And must and will be so for Life; For Law can do no less than right her, Wh'as done no more than bit the Biter. Moral Reflexions on the foregoing Dialogue. [He that his own Defects would hide] He that his own Defects would hide From a rich Mistress, to deceive her, If he's out-witted by his Bride, He ought in Reason to forgive her. If an old fumbling Fool will wed A handsome Lass, that's brisk and young, And she defiles her nuptial Bed, The Cuckold ought to hold his Tongue. For had the Dotard prudent been, And well consider'd his Decay, He might have easily foreseen His Horns before the Wedding-Day. So he who knows his own Estate Deep mortgag'd, and himself undone, And thinks a Woman's Fortune great, Who, in her Conscience, knows she'as none: And he, to win the cunning Dame, Pretends to be the Lord knows what, And she sets up to be the same, When marry'd, 'tis but Tit for Tat. The Man's commended now-a-days, That wins a Dame, and does out-wit her; I think she merits equal Praise, That has the Wit to bite the Biter. DIALOGUE X. Between a non-jurant Clergy man, and his contentious Lady, about taking the Oaths to the late Government. Wife. Why will you prove so obstinate, my Dear, And rather chuse to starve, than yield to swear? Why give up all the Comforts of your Life, Expose to Want, your Children, and your Wife; Hug your own Ruin thro' a holy Pride, Which Int'rest calls you now to lay aside; And common Safety, that prevailing Plea, Justifies those who wisely do agree? Consider, therefore, and in time comply, You may, perhaps, on some Mistakes rely; And then, how fatal 'twould hereafter be, That Error should beget our Misery? Secure the Living first you've long possest, And then discuss the Point within your Breast; Postpone your Conscience, till you've once comply'd, Then if you 'gainst your self the Cause decide, You'll find your Error on the safest Side. Husband. Thou talk'st, alas! like Job's unhappy Wife, Who bid him curse the God that gave him Life; Or like unhappy Eve, whose ill Advice Lost Adam and herself their Paradice. O! faithless Woman, ignorant and blind, To prefer Plenty to a quiet Mind, And vain Externals, that abound below, To heav'nly Comforts that from Conscience flow. Where does the Peace of human Life abound, But in the pious Breast, that feels no Wound? Who then, that knows his Duty, would controul Th'unerring Dictates of his peaceful Soul, For Int'rest Sake, that false mistaken Good, That blinds the Great, and tempts the brainless Crowd? No, Female Satan, I abhor thy Pride; My Rule of Faith's my Conscience, that my Guide: Nor shall I waver from so just a Cause, That's firmly built on Heav'n's eternal Laws. Shall I that Doctrine I have taught, explode, To prove my self a Hypocrite of Mode; Preach one Thing, and, by vile Example, shew I long have taught what I confess untrue? No, graceless Help-mate, I alone shall trust In that kind Providence that's always just; And not, to save my Living, shame my Life, To please the Pride of a contentious Wife. Well may that Priest be deem'd a Knave or Fool, Who o'er his Conscience lets a Woman rule! Wife. Thousands, as just and learn'd as you, we find, On second Thoughts, have wisely chang'd their Mind, And when they found the doubtful Season past, Tho' they refus'd at first, comply'd at last. You see your Diocesan led the Way; And why should you from his Example stray? He's your Superiour; and since he complies, Who is so grave, so just, so learn'd and wise, The World will but condemn your loyal Zeal, And think you dang'rous to the Common-weal. Besides, you see the greatest Men conform And all, to guard the Nation's Saviour, arm. The wiser Priests for little David pray, Extol his Vertues, and his Pow'r obey; Confirm his Title to the regal Throne, And bless good Heav'n for placing him thereon. The Judges and the Law his Right maintain, Allow his Edicts, and assert his Reign. The joyful Crowd, with one united Voice, In loud Huzza's proclaim their happy Choice. And are not these sufficient to convince Your squeamish Conscience, he's your lawful Prince And that you ought to swear as others do, To th'Pow'r that now protects both them and you; And not oppose, thro' a pedantick Pride, What by the major Part is justify'd; As if you thought 'twas Justice to complain Against that regal Pow'r the Laws maintain, And Wisdom to be singular and vain? Husband. Majority is but a slender Plea; Common Consent is not enough for me. The greater part, we may observe, in spite Of Heav'ns good Laws, in Wickedness unite, And thousands daily do from Vertue stray, To one good Man, that keeps the milky Way. Must therefore he, who from the Crowd dissents, To please the World, forsake his Innocence; Trespass on Conscience, 'cause the brainless Rout Despise its Dictates, and proceed without? The major Part their baneful Lusts pursue, Must he that's just, comply, and do so too? The greater Number are by Int'rest sway'd, And by the Hopes of worldly Wealth misled. To cheat, revile, invent a thousand Lies, To shame the Pious, and detract the Wise. If by such Means they can their Ends obtain, And make their Sins but centre in their Gain, Must therefore he, who fears to tread awry, Turn vile, and with the common Vogue comply? The Great, we see, are by Ambition spurr'd; The Knight turns Traytor, to become a Lord: The Lawyer in an odious Cause will drudge, To please the Court, in hopes to be a Judge. The Priest, to serve the Times, will play his Part, Change his old Doctrine, and the Text pervert; Will cant, recant, and re-recant again, For rev'rend Lawn, or to be made a Dean: And would you also have me play the Ape, Like Proteus, in some new, but knavish Shape: Turn faithless Shepherd, basely to betray My sacred Trust, and lead my Flock astray? No, a brown Crust shall sooner be my Food, And the cold Spring replete my Veins with Blood, Than I'll recant what I have preach'd long since, Or for a Living, sell my lawful Prince. Wife. But he you call so, has resign'd the Throne, And now the Peoples David sits thereon. Your Saul, thro' Fear has left you in the Lurch, And fled for Safety to his Idol Church, Where cunning Bald-pates compliment his Zeal, And with Lip-salves his wounded Conscience heal; Perswade your Monarch 'tis a glorious Thing To live a Biggot, rather than a King; They'll hug him close, they've made him now their ow He's fitter for a Cloister, than a Throne, It is in vain to hope for his Return, His Reliques soon must bless some Roman Urn. You may, with Safety, now he's gone, comply, And none but Fools will think you've stept awry. What Man, that loves himself, would be undone For him, who to his Rival leaves his Throne; Deserts his Subjects, when they need his Aid, And from the publick Body steals the Head? What Man of Sense would such a Prince adore, And blame the Hero that has won the Pow'r? Husband. You quite mistake the Nature of the Case, Your bold Reflexions are both false and base. The People first their lawful Prince forsook, Aided his Foes, and their Allegiance broke: His seeming Friends those evil Projects laid, For which the King was blam'd, and next betray'd. They form'd each wicked Scheme, and manag'd all That vex'd his Subjects, and procur'd his Fall: They blow'd the Coals, and Ills that were their own, They still reflected on the guiltless Throne: They fill'd the Land with Jealousy and Fear, Yet lull'd their Prince to think no Danger near: They fed the People with a thousand Lies, And did each Hour prepost'rous Shams devise; Drove in malicious Wedges ev'ry Day, Between the Throne, and those that should obey; Fill'd the rebellious Mobs unthinking Brains With Tales of Cravats torn, and Warming-pans; And when the Land was ripe for their Design, They call'd their Shadow of a Hero in, Who promis'd fair, declar'd he came to heal The Breaches 'twixt the King and Common-weal; Told us the P? should be a Perkin made, But ne'er perform'd one Word of what he said: And would you have me now disown my King, For such a strange Dutch Thingum of a Thing? No, I'll first wear my Gown, that is so black, Till it grows grey upon my aged Back. Wife. Grant this be true: But when his Rival came, Why did your injur'd Monarch prove so tame? What made him fly, when he had Room to fight And without Battel, abdicate his Right? That Prince is never fit to rule a Throne, That wants the Courage to defend his Crown. Husband. Did not his Army, who were justly paid, Well cloath'd, and on his Bounty long had fed, Desert him when he needed them the most, And basely join with the Batavian Host? Were not some faithless Troops, that staid behind, To the like odious Treachery inclin'd? Did not his nearest Relatives forsake His Camp, and on his Presence turn their Back? Would not such Usage make the bravest Prince Despond, in such a dang'rous Exigence, Whose Father had experienc'd long before The cruel Rage of a rebellious Pow'r? Must he have leap'd into the Hands of those Who were, from Traytors, turn'd to open Foes, And could for no true Safety hope, 'tis plain, But in the fatal Period of his Reign? Or must he've call'd an Army from the Skies, To've stood the Fury of his Enemies? What other Measures had the Suff'rer left, When of his Army, and his Friends bereft, But to withdraw his Person, and defeat Their pointed Malice by a safe Retreat? Yet, when such Treach'ry made him quit the Plain, To's Royal Palace he return'd again, There tarry'd till insulted, disobey'd, And basely threaten'd, if he longer stay'd; Left destitute of Servants and of Friends, Who vanish'd to pursue ignoble Ends, Whilst their kind Royal Master look'd around For those that would not in Distress be found; Arm'd only with the Patience of a Job, Expos'd to all the Fury of a Mob. Was it not then high time to make his Way, When his approaching Foes forbid his Stay, And with their saucy Scoffs and Threats allarm'd, A naked Prince deserted and disarm'd, Who, if he'd stay'd, could no Relief propose, But his own Dagger, or, at least, his Foes? How then can you, like the mistaken Crowd, Assert he did those Things he disavow'd, And that he left his People and his Throne, Because he wisely from their Fury run, When threat'ning Force and Malice chas'd him hence, To seek Protection from a foreign Prince? So those that set the Tile, or fix the Gin, May blame the Stag that will not fall therein, Or the rash Sportsman curse the feeble Hare, And call her Caution Cowardice and Fear, 'Cause, when allarm'd by the approaching Hounds, She quits her Form, and flies to distant Grounds. Rebellion never wants a fair Pretence, The Throne is always loaded with Offence; And if the Rebels once effect their Aim, By sacred Cheats they shuffle off the Shame, And on their injur'd Prince heap all the Blame. How then can I, by holy Orders bound To Vertue, Truth and Justice, stand my Ground; And, without Scandal to my Function, turn A Foe to whom I have Allegiance sworn; And, to become a faithless Priest of Mode, Deny my King, as Peter did his God? Not I, I'll sooner be a starving Priest, To him that feeds the Poor, a welcome Guest, Than share the Dainties of a Traytor's Feast. Wife. Let the Case be as 'twill, 'tis yet severe, That Conscience should with Int'rest interfere. If such a Tyrant must compel the Mind, And to our Ruin, human Actions bind, Whoever hugs the Darling in his Breast, Is sure to live much injur'd and opprest. If such a Pilot be allow'd to steer In what affects our Happiness so near, Conscience, f'r ought I know in a Case like this, May bring us to a thousand Miseries; And that can be no heav'nly Pilot, sure, That steers us to be scandalous and poor, The Son had ne'er his Father's Throne possest, Had Conscience govern'd his heroick Breast; Nor could the happy Change have e'er been made, Had his kind Friends that foolish Guide obey'd. The Great and Wise, we see, ne'er condescend. To such vain Shadows, that oppose their End, But cast behind their Backs such idle Toys, T'improve their Riches, and pursue their Joys. The P?s, who are wiser far than you, Disdain such Cob-webs, and at once break thro': They scorn to quit the Grandeur they possess, For Trifles, but hold fast their Happiness. Why then should you pursue a diff'rent Way, And seem to be more righteous far than they? Conscience is nothing but a Chain design'd To bind the slavish Part of human Kind; A holy Cord the Church has spun, to tie The Low, that they may truckle to the High: Therefore the Priest deserves Contempt, that wears The Fetters he for humble Fools prepares. The worthless Spider is, alas! too wise T'entangle 'mself i'th' Web he does devise With so much Art, to catch the little Flies. Besides, the Hurdles are not to confine The Shepherd, but to hold his Flock therein. The Foll'wer must not from his Leader stray; But still the Guide has Leave to chuse his Way. Shame on your holy Weakness, to withstand His right of Pow'r, confirm'd by all the Land; Back'd by the Laws, obey'd by Men of Sense, As their sure Refuge, and their best Defence; Deny'd by none but Mad-men, who agree To still be Vassals, when they may be free. Prithee, my Dear, put off this Fool's Disguise, And shew yourself less loyal, and more wise: Let not the Tyrant you yourself have made, Against your worldly Int'rest be obey'd, Lest those of greater Sense should scoffing say, You've rais'd a Devil which you cannot lay. Husband. Bad is your Cause, and weakly you defend, Begin in Folly, in Prophaneness end. Have I so long, to little purpose, taught, No Grace infus'd, no Truth, no Conscience wrought? Conscience, the Sum of all we know, that's good, All we believe, if bred as Christians shou'd: The good Man's Pilot in a Storm or Calm, That in all Weathers safely steers the Helm: The inward Judge of Right or Wrong, that scorns A golden Bribe to serve ignoble Turns: The best Physician in the worst Disease, That gives us good Advice, but takes no Fees: In all Afflictions generous and kind, Guard of our Peace, and Regent of the Mind: And would you have me slight so good a Guide, So true a Friend, to humour female Pride, Despise its Dictates, when I know they're just, And struggle with the Pow'r, I ought to trust; Rebel against that Grace, which God has giv'n, And fight at once with Conscience, and with Heav'n. No, 'tis not all the Taunts a Wife can use, Shall force Consent to what I now refuse: No Dread of Danger, or the Fear of Want, Make me turn Hypocrite, or Sycophant; Bow to an Idol I shall always hate, That a good Wife may live profusely great. No, Lady, you shall first reduce your Pomp, Reform your Dress, and low'r your cockling Rump; Abate your Dainties, spin, instead of play, And turn your Sattin into Grogram grey, E're I'll, for sordid Gain, my Conscience smother, And swallow Oaths repugnant to each other. Moral Reflexions on the foregoing Dialogue. [We ought on Conscience to rely] We ought on Conscience to rely, Provided it be form'd aright; But if it's false, we tread awry, By foll'wing a deceitful Light. Good Conscience is a Rule, that's built Upon our Knowledge, and our Faith, It judges and condemns our Guilt, And shews us the Celestial Path. But that which to our Int'rest bends As vile Partiality requires, Is Self-Opinion that depends On our vain Hopes, and loose Desires. The righteous Conscience will dispute Our Lusts, and make us condescend: Thus to the Good our Lives we suit, The Bad we to our Actions bend. The one will o'er our Passions rule, And govern like a lawful Prince; The other, like the Peoples Tool, Will how and hum'r us in our Sins. In a sound Conscience we are safe, That will oblige us to obey; But trust not to a Whale-bone Staff, That as we lean, bends any Way. DIALOGUE XI. Between a handsome Money-getting Shrew, and a Husband that depends upon his Wife's Pocket. Wife. My Dear, I've stay'd a little late; But you, I know, don't value that. If I can but supply your Wants, And humour your Extravagance, I find you care not where I wander, Let you have Money but to squander: But pray suppose, when thus I go Abroad, that I should meet some Beau That's rich, and swears he loves me dearly, And would allow me so much yearly, That we should flow and rowl in Money, If he might fix the Horns upon ye; Could you contentedly comply With such a Lover, by the by; Look kindly when he comes to see me, Shake Hands, go out, and leave him wi' me; Return at Night without a Frown, And ne'er reflect at what we'd done, But freely, from your Heart, forgive all The Favours granted to your Rival; Call me your Phubs, your pretty Fool, Your Cockadil, your charming Soul, And be as fond, altho' for certain, You know I'm kiss'd behind the Curtain, As an old Alderman, new-wedded To a plump Lady with a red Head, Who'as fifty times before been bedded? Could you but do those Things, my Honey, I ought not then to grutch you Money; Else why should I, that am a Woman, Maintain a Spouse, a Thing uncommon; And, like a Novice, condescend To work and slave that you may spend? The very Cock with fiery Gills, That struts about with armed Heels; That crows and flutters in such State, Should he exact his feather'd Mate To scrape the reaking Dung-hill for him, They'd cackle o'er him, and abhor him, And into neighb'ring Yards would rove, To seek out some more gen'rous Love. The Husband therefore that depends Upon his Wife for what he spends, By way of Gratitude, should grant her What Spark she pleases, to gallant her; For one good Turn, I've heard my Mother Say often, well deserves another. Husband. I own you gen'rously supply me, And seldom, when I ask, deny me: But should I promise to connive at Those Liberties you seem to drive at, And give you Leave to sport with twenty, If I my self cannot content ye, I know you are too wise a Woman To turn your Close into a Common, And let your Neighbours till and sow That Ground which I alone should mow; Nor would you (had you an Intent To take a Loose) ask my Consent, Because you cannot but believe it Must go against the Grain to give it; For tho' a Wife be apt to crack The Sev'nth Commandment on her Back, And by her gadding out a-Nights, Her wanton Carriage, and her Slights, Or by some Letters found about her. Her Husband has good Cause to doubt her; Yet, should she ask her jealous Spouse To give her Leave to horn his Brows, He'd scorn to be consenting to it, Tho' without Leave he knows she'll do it. A Man may patiently endure A Pain that will admit no Cure, Yet cannot frame a Mind to be Consenting to the Misery, The Wretch that is condemn'd to swing, Submits unto the Hempen String, Yet does not willingly comply, Because he'd rather live than die. So, tho' a Man believes his Wife Has dub'd him Cuckold for his Life; (For he that's once a Buck, we know, Has th'Honour always to be so) Tho' he sits easy underneath The Branches of his horny Wreath, And shews no Anger for his bearing Those Arms he cannot help the wearing, Yet that's no Argument he's pleas'd With Plagues of which he can't be eas'd; No more than that himself does chuse, Those Things he would, but can't refuse. Therefore if I am doom'd to carry That Crest, which many do that marry, Remember, when you take the Freedom To plant my Horns before I need 'em, That 'tis not done with my Consent, Tho' I seem easy and content With what I would, but can't prevent: For should you, by your Lust, be hurry'd To Ills that should disgrace my Forehead; Yet, if you will be such a Jilt, I'll be no Partner in the Guilt. Wife. But I suppose, if I got Wealth, By kissing some rich Cuff by Stealth, Tho' angry, I should prove untrue t'ye, You'd very gladly share the Booty, And never ask which way 'twas gain'd, Had you but what your self could spend, So the base Coward, that's unwilling T'assist his Friends in Ven'son-stealing, Yet, when a Gang of merry Fellows, That neither Prison fear, nor Gallows, Have stoll'n a Buck to make a Feast, He'll gladly share the horned Beast, And eat as freely as the rest. I think his sharing of the Prey, Makes him as guilty full as they; For all the World, we find, believes Receivers are as bad as Thieves. Therefore if I should tread awry, And you're content to live thereby, Altho' you seem to disapprove Of my unjust, but gainful Love, Yet, if you freely share with me The Fruits of my Adultery, From thence, I think, 'tis very plain, That you're consenting, in the Main, To all the Wrongs that I have done ye, Because you snack the Purchase-Money. Husband. Not right; for pray suppose that you Was lov'd by some rich God knows who, And you should ease his Pain for Profit, When I, alas! think nothing of it, But still believe you unpolluted, And my self hornless, when cornuted, Till I should see new Rings and Lockets, And Gold by Hand-fulls in your Pockets, 'Tis likely then I should distrust You had comply'd to be unjust, To ease some wealthy Letcher's Lust. And when I thus surmise you naught, Tho' never tax you with your Fau't, I should with Patience share the Gains And Earnings of your sinful Pains. Such Condescension does not prove I'm pleas'd with your adult'rous Love, Or that I am consenting to it, 'Cause you supply me when you do it. It is no Sin, as I conceive, To take what others freely give; The Folly in the Action lies, Not in the Money; there you're wise. If you, to please some am'rous Noddy, Shall hazard both your Soul and Body, Ne'er fancy 'tis a wicked Thing T'accept a Watch, or Diamond-Ring; Or that a Bag, or green knit Purse Of Guineas, makes the Crime the worse: And pray believe, that when you find Your gen'rous Spark so over-kind, To line your Pocket, like a Friend, With more than female Pride can spend, You ought, by Way of Reparation, To yield your Spouse Participation Of all the Fruits of your Transgression, That Golden Presents, heap'd upon him, May 'tone for the Abuse you've done him, And by their Value, let him see You're sorry for the Injury, Altho' the Dev'l has hook'd you in So far, you cannot leave the Sin. But then, because he does not call you Jilt, Strumpet, Whore, kick, thump, and maul you, In Passion, to your Neighbours shew Your Faults, as hot-brain'd Cuckolds do; Yet, if the Fool be thus content To bear his Horns without Complaint, You must not take, thro' Indiscretion, His Patience for his Approbation; For that's but like a Rascal's thieving From one that's easy and forgiving, Then swearing what was stoll'n, was lent, And that the Loser gave Consent. Wife. That Simily's quite out of Place, And comes not up unto the Case. Suppose us Partners in a Pond That chanc'd to lie amidst my Ground, And all the Use, alas! you make on't, Is but to keep it for the Sake on't, Or now and then, perhaps, to water Old Ball, not worth the looking a'ter; And when I walk Abroad, I find My Neighbours have a longing Mind To bring their Stone-horse, or their Bull, To drink at our refreshing Pool; And one he makes a tempting Offer, A second Spark a larger Proffer; A third affirms he loves me dearly, Swears that he'll give me so much yearly; And I, more prudent than to lose A Bargain you'd, perhaps, refuse, Suffer my Neighbour, by the by, My wat'ring Place to occupy, As often as his Nag's a-dry, Tho' what's agreed between us two, Or more, remains unknown to you, Yet, if I let you share the Rent, I think you ought to be content; And should I tell you by what Means I rais'd those Demi-Gods, the Pence, You're bound to thank me for improving A Spot your self is past the loving, And ought to wonder how I raise So much by such a wat'ry Place, Which would, alas! no Profit bring, Without my prudent managing; And you, perhaps, must starve, thro' Want, Did I not turn it to Account, And raise a Penny by that Pond, Of which my Neighbours are so fond. What, tho' I never ask'd you Leave. If honestly to you I give Most of the Money I receive, Altho' I never plainly told Which Way, perhaps, I got the Gold, Yet surely you might eas'ly guess, Since I no Lands or Hoards possess; And if you do but barely fancy, 'Tis got by female Necromancy, And gladly share what's earn'd thereby, It does your free Consent imply, Or else you'd query, when I brought it, Before you took it, how I got it; And if you disapprov'd the Means, Rebuke me for my gainful Sins, And, in a Passion, shew you scorn A tipt, or any other Horn; Despise those Sums that have been made Betrayers of your nuptial Bed: And that's your Way, if I should do't, T'avoid the Slander of a Brute That's horn'd, and yet consenting to't. But on the contrary, if I, As many do, should tread a-wry, And when my Pocket, by my Placket, Is filled, and you make bold to snack it, I think, in sharing the Reward, You plainly with my Vice accord, Contract more Guilt of my ill Courses, Than I, that carry both the Purses; For if you wink, that should chastise, Because my Sins give you Supplies In both the shameful Error lies. Husband. At this Rate he that wears the Horn, Must have no Blessing in Return; For when you gain by your Amours, You'd have both Gold and Pleasure yours, And only keep your patient Spouse, To mark your Sins upon his Brows; As Bakers, trusting into Allies, Do Loaves upon their wooden Tallies. But after all, I hope, my Lady, You're not so buxom, or so greedy, As first to horn a Husband's Pate, And then to use him at this Rate! I hope what has between us past, At worst, is but a Jest at last; And tho', it's true, for Spending-Money, Sometimes I do depend upon ye, Yet after all your merry speaking, Can't think 'tis got by Basket-making; For should I know one Penny of it To be such wicked shameful Profit, 'Twould gaul my Soul, you need not doubt it, And make me fret and fume about it, Altho' I could not live without it. Yet, if a Wife, by her Gallants, Supplies her Husband in his Wants, Why should he rattle, rave, and curse, The Money's not a Jot the worse; Altho' I cannot but allow Tis odly earn'd, I know not how; That is, a Man may truly say, 'Tis got a very ugly Way. However, since there is no living Without expending and receiving, And all Men must, by Work or Play, Find Money both to spend and pay, I think that if a Wife, by Stealth, Co-op'rates with a Man of Wealth, And he's so gen'rous to supply her With all Things that she can desire, And often kindly sends her Home Well loaded with a useful Sum; I think her Spouse, without Offence, May share the wicked ill-got Pence, To recompence the Wrong that's done him, And not contract her Guilt upon him, Because he has a Right, by Marriage, To all she gets by her Miscarriage. Besides, a Woman that defiles Her Bed with John a-Nokes or Stiles, We must allow, in spite of Jesting, Deserves the Pennance of a Basting: Yet, if she gets but Gold to bear off That Punishment she stands in fear of, She may attone for her Transgression To'er Spouse, by Way of Commutation, Who'as Pow'r to take a Sum in Lieu Of any other Pennance due, And, for the Sake of present Pay, Can hide he Failings, and delay The Broomstaff 'till another Day. So she who, for her Sins habitual, Is su'd in Bawdy Court Spiritual, And brought in dread of standing in A white Sheet, which, perhaps, has been Assisting to that very Bus'ness, That brought her under such Uneas'ness; Yet, if the Sinner can but find A Purse or Bag that's richly lin'd, She may reverse the shameful Doom, And bid the Commons kiss her Bum. Why therefore mayn't a Woman's Spouse, Whose Fortune hangs upon his Brows, Forgive a Wife that loves the Sport, As well as any Bishop's Court, In Case she gives him Money for't? But if she's kind, and he knows of it, And shews his Patience for no Profit, Such a Tom Dingle ought to wear More Horns than any Stag can bear, And on Record deserves to be A Cuckold from Resentment free, Odious to all Posterity. Wife. I find then, if I made a Breach Of Duty with a Spark that's rich, And could but line your Pockets well, Your malmsy Nose would never swell, But countenance your Wife, and let her Be kind to those that love her better, Yet swear your Dame's a vertuous Woman, Altho' you know she's almost common, Because you would not care another Contented Buck should call you Brother, But hate the jealous World should think, That you at your Wife's Follies wink, Tho' you indulge her in her Vice, To gratify your Avarice, Rather encourage, than rebuke her, And cover all her Shame for Lucre, Thus let her sin, with all your Spirit, But shun the odious Name you merit. So Pimps and Flatterers, that skreen The vitious Freaks of mighty Men, Conceal the Infamy they live by, And rail against the Ills they thrive by. But since I find you'd be so humble, As to wear Horns, and never grumble, Provided that they were but gilt By him that makes your Wife a Jilt, I'll try to win a rich Gallant; But if I strive in vain, and can't, I'll bribe some Bully of the Town With Cloths, and now and then a Crown, To share the Pleasures of your Bed, And load with Horns your Cuckold's Head, Rather than such a gen'rous Spouse, Should want a Crest t'adorn his Brows; For since you're willing to resign Your nuptial Bed-fellow for Coin, I'll yield my Favours at my Leisure, Not for your Profit, but my Pleasure. Is this your nuptial Love, you Brute, To have your Wife turn Prostitute; A Slut, a mercenary Jade, To make her Sins a gainful Trade, And to expose her youthful Charms, For Gold, to some rich Letcher's Arms, That you may swill, and have the spending Of what I get by condescending? So Bullies, from their Harlots, glean What they purloin from other Men, And flourish by the sinful Lives Of cunning Jilts they call their Wives. Is that your Aim, my hopeful Honey? Must I turn lewd to earn you Money; Humour some rich old gouty Cit, That loves a tender youthful Bit; Or please some Lord, that leans on Crutches, To ease th'Effects of his Debauches, Who may, perhaps, reward you for't, And give you some good Place at Court, That you, like many more, may come To Honour by your Cuckoldom, And owe the Comforts of your Life To th'Pleasures of a handsome Wife? Money, thou Root of Ill, thou base, But earthly God of human Race, For thee the Miser damns his Soul, To only hide thee in a Hole; For thee the Trader swears and lies, And labours to be rich, not wise; For thee the Saint disclaims his Faith, And quits his old, for some new Path; For thee the Mighty stain their Fame, And do worse Ills than I can name; For thee the Young and Fair engage With rotten Teeth and wrinkl'd Age; For thee the Spouse adorns his Head, And lets a Rival share his Bed, To the rich Fop submits his Wife, For Gold, the Curse of human Life, And for the Sake of what he gleans, Shares in the Scandal of her Sins. But, Cuckold, I will make thee know The real Plagues of being so; I'll horn thee, tease thee with my Tongue, Yet swear I never did thee wrong; Cry, scold, abuse thee, domineer, Then coax thee up, and call thee Dear; Go fine my self, from Head to Foot, But keep you in a thread-bare Coat; For the poor Wretch, who, for a Sum, Could wink at his own Cuckoldom, And would for Money lend his wife, Deserves to lead a wretched Life. Moral Reflexions on the foregoing Dialogue. [Of all the Dregs of human Race] Of all the Dregs of human Race, To sinful Shame and Int'rest bent, None surely can the Wretch surpass, That's made a Cuckold by Consent. If Gold such Patience can inspire, And so debase the Soul of Man, Well may the needy Lass, for Hire, The gen'rous Lover entertain. A Husband's Happiness depends Upon the Vertue of his Wife; And he that basely condescends To be a Cuckold, 's curs'd for Life. Yet some such Miscreants there are, Who, to supply such craving Wants, Permit their beauteous Wives to spare Their Favours unto rich Gallants, Connive at their adult'rous Leagues, Smile on a spurious mottl'd Race; Depend upon their Wives Intrigues, And live and flourish in Disgrace. But those who, for the Sake of Gain, Can be such wicked Knaves or Fools, Altho' they wear the Shape of Men, They're Brutes and Monsters in their Souls. DIALOGUE XII. Between a Town-bred Gentleman, and his Country-Bride, concerning London, which he had abandon'd for the Pleasures of a rural Life. Lady. Since London is a Place of such Renown, And Crowds of well-bred Beauties grace the Town, Which, by Report abounds with all Delights, That can improve our Days, or bless our Nights, How came you thus to chuse a Country Wife, And quit such Pleasures, for a rural Life? Husband. The Town's a famous Lab'rinth, I agree; But still too noisy and too lewd for me. The Ladies all seem Angels, 'tis allow'd, As if just dropt from some impending Cloud; But when they're Wives, the Custom of the Place Soon makes 'em Shrews, or tempts 'em to be base, If chaste, they're proud, and triumph o'er our Love; If kind and fair, they too licentious prove: Who therefore with a dang'rous Snake would lie, Because her Skin seems beauteous to the Eye? Or to his nuptial Bed a Nettle bring That knows before hand how the Weed will sting? Lady. But where such Numbers of the Fair delight, With their prevailing Charms, the wand'ring Sight, It argues much ill Nature to accuse The whole, or that you wanted Sense to chuse. All could not sure deserve your Disesteem, By plunging into Vice's muddy Stream: Those in the Paths of Vertue strictly bred, Fear to transgress, and scorn to be misled; But chaste and pious, whether Maid or Wife, Are careful to preserve a modest Life. Had you convers'd with these, you would have found Your severe Censure had but little Ground: But you have giv'n me Reason to suspect You chose the Bad, and did the Good reject; And from the vain Delights you us'd to taste Among the Worst, judge hardly of the Best. So those, who thro' the Fence of Vertue break, Suspect that all the same ill Courses take; For groundless Censures and Distrusts arise Too often from our own Infirmities. Husband. I am not so severe, to think that all Within the Reach of my Reflexions fall; But this Opinion I have long possest, That most are wanton, and but few are chaste; For Vice abounds in Cities more than Grace, And bad Example ev'ry Day takes Place: Nor do I mean the Fair alone should bear The Scandal, since the Men deserve a Share: Both are deceitful, and alike delude Each other to be careless of their Good. The Ladies dress to charm the wanton Eye, And from their Brows let Swarms of Cupids fly; With wishful Looks, and study'd Smiles invite Each am'rous Libertine to Love's Delight. The lustful Hypocrite to Church repairs, In hopes to save her Credit by her Pray'rs; Makes Assignations walking in or out, And hides her Shame by seeming so devout. So sacred Villains, when they mean to act Some tragick Part, by pious Numbers backt, Crave Heaven's Aid, ere they attempt the Fact. The airy Madam, more polite and gay, Rattles each Night in Splendor to the Play; With Gems or Bristol-Stones bedecks her Hair, In hopes their Lustre may command a Pair: Tossing her Head, and smiling does she sit, Wishing to charm some Stallion in the Pit; Gives here a Bow, and there a gentle Drop, Whilst her unthinking Cuckold minds his Shop; Picks up some Spark, just takes a Flirt, and then, Prepar'd with twenty Lies, sneaks Home by ten. For crafty Knaves, or the intreaguing Jilt, Ne'er want a Cov'ring to conceal their Guilt. The honour'd Lady, who frequents the Court, Taught by Example there to love the Sport, Steals from her Servants, quits her gilded Coach, And mobb'd in Hack, pursues each new Debauch, Drives to some House where Chocolate is sold, There meets a younger Brother, if she's old, Who gives her what she wants, and takes her Gold. So wealthy Fools, misled by fond Desire, Give solid Worth for Trifles they admire. The Daughter bred beneath her Parents Care, Proud to behold their Progeny so fair, Learns of her Mother early to be naught, And practises betimes what Mamma taught; Finds means, as soon as ripe, to quench her Flame, And grows too crafty for the careful Dame; Ne'er wants a Salvo, or a sham Pretence, To cloak her Guilt with seeming Innocence; But when reprov'd, suspected, or accus'd, Deceives her by the Blinds the Old one us'd. So forward Gamesters oft, at cunning Play, Out-wit the Knaves that taught 'em first the Way. The fine kept Madam sooths her gen'rous Cull, Dreins his 'Scrutore, as well as Veins, when full; Takes Pains to bubble her admiring Friend, That what he gets, she may on others spend; Ne'er wants a broad-back'd Bully, to suffice Her craving Lust, which daily needs supplies; For as she's kept to quench her Lover's Flame, The same Ambition fires the wanton Dame; She bribes some brawny Spark to be her Slave, That like her Keeper, she a Drudge may have: Both are inclin'd to equal Lust and Folly, The Cully keeps the Whore, the Whore the Bully. So mighty Kings, who triumph o'er their Slaves, Drein the poor Fools, to gratify the Knaves. The common Punk, quite destitute of Grace, Exposes in the Streets her brazen Face; Shews by her wanton Air, her odious Trade, Juts with her Bum, and tosses up her Head; Draws in young Cullies by her youthful Charms, And with her Looks, invites them to her Arms; Elbows each Man she meets, that they may find, By her kind Jostles, how she stands inclin'd: Thus sins at Random, till the painful Pox Brings her at last to a repenting Flux; Which soon deprives her of her charming Face, And leaves her full as ugly as she's base. So Trees, that once their verdant Beauty spread With Light'ning struck, look wither'd and decay'd. The vertuous Ladies, those enchanting few, Secure their Beauty by the Pride they shew; Their scornful Looks they scatter as they move, And seemingly defy the Pow'r of Love; Too great a Value on their Beauty place, And think their Charms too bright for Man's Embrace. This Lover they refuse, and that despise, And without Fortunes, would to Coaches rise; This Spark's too clownish, that too much a Fop; T'other's beneath 'em, 'cause he keeps a Shop. Thus their Pride soars above their low Degree, And aims at nothing less than Quality; Till gazing in the Glass, at length they find Their Years advanc'd, their youthful Charms declin'd, And then, repenting they have prov'd so shy, Good-natur'd grow, and with the next comply; For she that is too coy, when young and gay, Forsakes her Vertue as her Charms decay. Women, tho' ne'er so chaste and modest, dread The odious Name of old and wither'd Maid; And tho' they long have slighted Man's Embrace, Yet when they find their Beauty fades a pace, They'll marry mean, or sin in spite of Grace. So craving Dealers, who, thro' Avarice, Withstand their Market, always low'r their Price: Those that reject good Offers surely find Repenting Folly follows close behind. These are the London Ladies, who display Their Smiles, and dress so airy and so gay; Some to enslave us to their awful Charms, Others to tempt us to their sinful Arms; All looking upwards, aiming with their Darts To wound the Rich, and conquer wealthy Hearts; For, gay Apparel and a beauteous Face Gives Punk a Title to a Lord's Embrace, Whilst Ale-wives Daughters, bred at Hackney-Schools, Are Tap-lash Fortunes for the trading Fools; For Money, not Desert, prefers the Maids; From Chandler's Shop, to some rich Merchant's Bed, Whilst Beauty wanting Bags, must range the Town, And exercise her Charms for half a Crown: Who then would marry, where the fairest Dames Will quench, for such a Sum, our am'rous Flames? Who need a Wife, that ev'ry Moment meets Such Swarms of courteous Ladies in the Streets? Lady. Since Town-bred Beauties are so wond'rous kind, And to the Sports of Love so much inclin'd, Those who enjoy their Favours, must, of Course, Be full as wicked as the Fair, or worse, Because they first by Flatt'ries draw them in, And after hire 'em to repeat the Sin; Therefore the Tempters must be more to blame, Than those they bring to Misery and Shame. Since you in Town were bred, 'tis well, my Dear, If you had Grace to keep your Conscience clear; For where the Ladies are so kind and free And if but ask'd, so forward to agree, 'Tis hard for Man to fly their wanton Charms, And to escape their fond bewitching Arms; For Youth and Beauty promise such Delights, That few are backward, when the Fair invites. However, I despise a jealous Breast, Or do I want to have your Faults confest: But since the London Dames and Ladies prove So free, so forward, and so apt to love, Pray let your Tongue, with equal Freedom, tell How far your Sex's Vertues ours excel; For if the Women are so loosely given, The Men, I fear, will make the Ballance even. Husband. Since you that live retir'd, delight to hear A Hist'ry of the Town and People there, Without Abuse or Flatt'ry, I'll be free To satisfy your vain Curiosity. The crafty Cit puts on a pious Face, And cloaks his Knav'ries with pretended Grace, Thinks nothing sinful that improves his Store, And knows no wicked State, but to be poor, Expensive Evils he abhors the most, And measures all Transgressions by their Cost; But ev'ry gainful Sin he reconciles, And finds no Harm in profitable Ills; Each golden Vice he silently adores, But those which waste our Substance, he abjures. Wealth is his Aim, which he obtains by Fraud; Religion is his Cloak, and Gold his God; Cunning his Study, Penury his Care, In Hopes, before he dies, to be Lord-May'r. Thus slaves and scrapes, that he, when old, may see One splendid Year of Pride and Gluttony. The Man of Title, pow'rful in the State, Unjust as wealthy, haughty as he's great, Who from the publick Stock in private gleans, And grows too rich by hidden Ways and Means; His Vices, tho' they're many, lie unseen, Honour and Wealth his Frauds and Pleasures skreen, Whores he may keep, be treacherous and lewd, Yet, if he's Great, he must, alas! be good; For neither Priest or Poet dare reprove Revenge, Ingratitude, adult'rous Love, Lest the harsh Satyr should at Court take place, And disoblige his Lordship, or his Grace. So when a King makes some sweet Sin his Choice, 'Tis dang'rous then to lash that single Vice, Lest the Invective at the Throne should squint, And the grave Robe should say, There's Treason in't. The youthful Gentlemen turn Fops and Beaus, And seem less proud of Merit, than of Cloaths; Slight female Vertue for ensnaring Looks, And study fine new Faces, more than Books; In Taverns and at Plays their Time exhaust, And love to sin at an excessive Cost; Are fond to enter into am'rous Leagues, But break 'em ev'ry Day for new Intreagues; Fall fresh in Love with ev'ry Jilt they see, True to no Mistress, but Variety. Marriage they ridicule, and all its Joys; That, and Religion, they alike despise, And think it Wit to banter and deride What's prais'd by all the sober World beside. Thus they rake on, and range the sinful Town, Till by their Vices they infirm are grown; Then, willing to comply, each seeks a Wife, When past the Pleasures of a nuptial Life; So that when once their buxom Ladies find Their beauish Husbands feeble and unkind, And that they're doom'd to languish by the Sides Of those that need old Nurses more than Brides, They find out ways to make themselves amends, And what the Spouse neglects, supply by Friends. Thus he who, for the Sake of Change, delays His Marriage, till his youthful Strength decays, And then betrays the kind expecting Maid, Or buxom Widow, to his nuptial Bed, In Justice ought to find his injur'd Bride Worse than he fear'd she'd prove before he try'd; For he who does, by flatt'ring Arts, allure The jolly Dame to love, should first be sure He wants no Balsam to perform the Cure. Some lustful Miscreants there are, that fly The Charms of Beauty, and their Pow'r defy; Sight all the Favours of the soothing Fair, And from the Laws of Nature vilely err; Doat on themselves, and quench each others Flame, By odious Means, that scarce can bear a Name; Practise such Sins, which, should the World embrace. Must put a speedy End to human Race. Thus hating Women, they pursue that Vice Which in old Sodom had its wicked Rise; Who, by the same, provok'd the God that's just To pour down fiery Vengeance on their Lust; Yet Sins we see, which long have bury'd lain Beneath the heaviest Judgments, rise again, From shameless Libertines receive new Growth, Who dare good Heaven to shew its farther Wrath. Old Letchers, enter'd into Life's last Stage, Who bend beneath the Weight of feeble Age, When near the Grave, they still their Lusts retain, And on their Crutches will be lewd and vain; Tho' crippl'd with their Vices, yet they find New Ways to humour the salacious Mind; Talk bawdy, tipple, into Brothels steal, And covet Joys they are too numb to feel; Yet lavish of their Coin, will bribe each Dame That sins for Money, to expose her Shame, And with a Pedant's Scepter, to exert Her female Fury on the sinful Part, 'Till the harsh Discipline, by slow Degrees, Awakens all the drowsy Faculties; Then, by vile Arts, which shameless Punks devise, Twixt Pain and Pleasure they their Lusts suffice: Thus strive, when old, to gratify their Itch, But aim in vain at Joys beyond their Reach; For tho' Desire does in its Strength remain, And fancy tittilates each struggling Vein, Yet frozen Nature does the Bliss restrain. So the sick Appetite oft longs for Meat, Which, when the Dainty's bought, it cannot eat. Thus Old and Young their diff'rent Vices have, From Men of Title, to the scoundrel Slave; By many much Religion is profest, Tho' in their Practice little's but exprest; For 'tis in Town the Mode to be precise, That Looks and Words their Morals may disguise: But he that trusts the sober canting Cit, Ne'er fails to find the Saint a Hypocrite; For Zealots there use outward Signs of Grace, Only to give their Frauds a better Face. So on the Road we often find the Inn, With splendid Sign, has nothing good within; And tho' they bring us forth but homely Chear, Yet ev'ry Thing they sell,'s both bad and dear. Knaves upon Fools, and Jilts on Bubbles prey, Husbands from Wives, and Wives from Husbands stray; Party 'gainst Party shew their equal spite, And snarling Scribblers against Scribblers write; Guide against Guide with solemn Fury preach, And by false Doctrines, widen ev'ry Breach; Lawyers 'twixt Friends breed Quarrels and Disputes, And spin each Diff'rence into costly Suits; Dull printed News deludes the Town each Day, And Fools believe what partial Blockheads say; The Rabble at the Tower-Guns rejoyce, And back their Thunder with as loud a Voice; Thus madly shew their clam'rous Joys at large, Before they ask the Cause of their Discharge; The Senate give, the City gladly Pay, Yet want to Morrow what they raise to Day; The Coach-men squabble, and the Car-men fight; The Hawkers bawl all Day, the Watch at Night; Young starving Harlots ply in ev'ry Street, Whilst Drunkards reel and jostle those they meet; Gamesters on trading Little-wits impose, And to poor Rakes reduce the City Beaus; Draw in, by Wheedles, each unwary Blade, And break more Fools, than the Decay of Trade; The Bully preys on each adult'rous Dame, Who ventures at the Sin, but dreads the Shame, Swears mighty Love, till he her Heart has won, Then dreins her Pocket, till she's quite undone. So Sots, invited to a Tub of Stout, First tap the Cask, then tarry till its out. The Great in Coaches rattle to and fro; Here a grave Statesman lolls, and there a Beau: Some to rich City-Scriv'ners, some to Court; Ladies some smiling, others a-la-mort: Some upon new Intrigues, in wond'rous Haste; Some thinking on their sweet Enjoyments past: Some to the new Cathedral of St. Paul, But more to th'Play-house, and to Salters-Hall; Whilst others range in State the Town about, To shew their Pride to those that walk on Foot, Who gaze with Envy on the scornful Great, And reverence, thro' Fear, those Pow'rs they hate, So factious Tribes, their Loyalty to show, Address most humbly, flatter, and bow low, To sooth the very Prince they mean to overthrow. These are the only Pleasures of the Town, Where all the Seeds of Wickedness are sown; Where Atheists flourish, and the headstrong Rabble Yield ev'ry Day some new amazing Squabble; Where dire Confusion fills their noisy Streets, And makes their best Delights but bitter Sweets. What Mortal then, who wisely can despise Fraud, Folly, Noise, Impertinence and Vice, Would waste this Life in such a wretched Place, Where ev'ry Knave puts on a Saint-like Face; Or chuse a Town-bred Wife, if blest without, Where the most Jiltish seem the most devout? For the gay Libertine, that takes Delight In purchasing new Faces ev'ry Night; Or for the rattling Rake, wrapt up in Vice, Divided 'twixt the Bottle and the Dice; London's the only Paradice to please Such vain unthinking Profligates as these; But he that wisely loves a sober Life, And covets to be free from Care and Strife, Let him, like me, embrace a Country Wife. What Man of Prudence, who is bent to ride A pleasing Journey, careful to avoid A stumbling Pad, unruly and unsound, Would chuse in Smithfield, where such Jades abound? Lady. If for this Case alone you disagree With the fam'd Place of your Nativity, I'm the more happy that you chose to shun The modish Vices of a sinful Town, And that you'd Pow'r to fly the tempting Charms Of Beauty, for a Country Housewife's Arms. You make me proud, to think a rural Maid, Born so remote, so very meanly bred, Should be preferr'd to Ladies so refin'd, Where Nature's Gifts with ev'ry Art are join'd, That can adorn the Body or the Mind. However, since you've made me thus your Bride, My want of Charms shall be by Love supply'd: The Duties of a Wife I'll ne'er transgress, But make your Ease my only Happiness; For Woman honour'd with a vertuous Spouse, Enjoys in Wedlock all that Heav'n allows: And she so blest, that proves perverse or base, Thro' want of nuptial Gratitude or Grace, Deserves to be despis'd by human Race. Moral Reflexions on the foregoing Dialogue. [Lest wretched made beyond Redress] Lest wretched made beyond Redress, We should, before we take a Wife, Consider well in what we place Our chiefest Happiness of Life. If we're to rural Joys inclin'd, From noisy Interruption free, The Town-bred Lady's airy Mind Will not with such Delights agree. Thus those who diff'rent Lives approve, Like coupl'd Hounds, will pull two Ways, And must, in Spite of nuptial Love, Contentions and Disquiets raise. The zealous Church-man should not take The querpo Saint at Meeting bred; For cross Opinions seldom make A soft and easy Marriage-Bed. The peaceful Man should have a Care Of the fine Dame that's pert and loud; For Patience with a Shrew that's fair, Makes her more insolent and proud. The only Way to shun those Shelves, Where Numbers do their Ruin find, Is, to abuse Women like our selves, In Fortune, Figure, and in Mind. DIALOGUE XIII. Between a Great Commander and his Lady upon his Arrival from the Wars. Lady. Welcome, my Lord; thrice welcome from afar, And from the Toils and Dangers of the War. I'm highly blest to see my honour'd Spouse With his fresh Lawrels blooming on his Brows. Much Joy at Home your great Success has rais'd, And loudly have your glorious Deeds been prais'd: But now your Presence makes us all more glad, And to the Court does farther Blessings add; Not only comforts an expecting Wife, But gives to all the Kingdom's Friends new Life. Commander. I joy to see my Dear, am glad to find You're well in Person, and so pleas'd in Mind: I hope that our Affairs domestick, stand In the same Plight, as when I left the Land; That nothing in my Absence has impair'd My Honour, or reduc'd my Friends Regard: For, those who at the Ridge of Glory aim, Never want Envy to eclipse their Fame. Lady. But yours, my Lord, will all Assaults endure; Your Greatness stands well-founded upon Pow'r, Beyond the Reach of those who look awry, And snarl to see your Merits rais'd so high: None e'er aspir'd to such a Pitch as you, But others would their Height with Envy view. The spiteful crooked Dwarf abhors to see A comely Stature, twice as tall as he; Nor can he pass him, but some Fault must find With his proud Aspect, or his Shapes behind, Who stalks along as stately as a King, And scarce can tell he met so mean a Thing. So lesser Mortals, eager to aspite, Would low'r your Height, to raise themselves the high'r; Slight the great Actions you perform each Year, And make the Fame you win, less bright appear; But you, my Lord, defy their Aim, and scorn Those barking Foes, to meaner Stations born; With true heroick Conduct safely steer, And neither factious Frowns or Flatt'ries fear. Commandeo. None by their Prince's Favour e'er could rise, But had false Friends, and grinning Enemies; Ambitious Spirits must have leave to frown, Upon the pow'rful Fav'rites of a Crown. The Proud grow angry, when their Rivals tow'r, As Ravens croak to see the Eagle soar: The Faction always that ill Nature had, To drown good Actions, and select the bad, In Hopes to lessen those they would remove, That their vile Projects might effectual prove; Which they'd accomplish soon, could they command The Sword of War, and Treasure of the Land; But Royal Wisdom their Intent fore-knows, And does, in safer Hands, those Trusts repose. 'Tis no new Practice, but of ancient Date, To shoot at Throne thro' Ministers of State, And disapprove the Actions they have done, Lessen the Valour shewn, the Battles won, If they dislike the Hand that does the Deed, And fear its Pow'r will their Designs impede; For none could e'er fanatick Favour win In publick Posts, but Tools themselves put in; Men that would strain their Conscience, or the Laws, To lend a Shoulder to their factious Cause; Such, tho' they're crafty Knaves, or haughty Fools, Are by their Tribe, cry'd up as Miracles; Their Conduct heighten'd, and extoll'd as wise, And their worst Failings skreen'd from publick Eyes. Parties, like Lovers, full of warm Desire, Will see no Faults in Fav'rites they admire. The am'rous Blade, that does the Dame delude, Will swear she's chaste, in Point of Gratitude. So factious Crowds, with utmost Zeal, commend The Vertues of the Tool that stands their Friend. But pray inform me how the envious Race Relish this Summer's Conduct and Success? What Arts they've us'd, and what invidious Game They've play'd, in order to eclipse my Fame? For evil Tongues must some Employment find T'express the Envy seated in the Mind. Lady. Your Glories are too permanent and bright, For Foes to tarnish with their utmost Spite. The annual Fortune that has always crown'd Your warlike Toils, does their Intrigues confound, Postpones their Malice to their Discontent, Who almost burst with what they fear to vent, The Faction know it is in vain to aim Their harmless Darts at your aspiring Fame; No pointed Envy your Repute can wound, But must, if thrown, upon themselves rebound, Unless blind Fortune your Attempts should thwart, And lessen, with her Frowns, your great Desert. Therefore with much Impatience do they wait, Till cross Events do your Success abate; Then would their stifled Thunder roar aloud, T'allarm the Ears of the mis-judging Crowd, And their pent Malice burst like Lightning from a Cloud. Commander. My Stars, I hope, do better Luck portend, And disappoint their base inglorious End: I trust alone in that victorious Hand, Whose single Pow'r no Army can withstand, But with one fatal Stroke can overthrow His Foes, and lay the proudest Kingdom low. I'm blest beyond their Reach, and am the Choice, Not of the Croud's, but God's and A?a's Voice. 'Tis for their Honour I at Conquest aim, To Heav'n the Thanks, and to my Queen the Fame; Nor do I doubt but I shall still prevail, And to my Country's Welfare turn the Scale. Let my Foes snarl, and Faction clamour on, I'll still be faithful to the Church and Throne; Humour no Party out of Love or Fear; But with safe Caution and just Conduct steer, That should I want Success, the World should see Chance should incur the Blame, instead of me; For tho' the Prospect's promising and fair, Yet cross Events, in spite of human Care, May disappoint the strongest Side in War. An Army may be brave, their Leader wise, But still in greater Hands the Vict'ry lies. Foes only boldly can with Foes contend, But he that rules the whole, decrees the End. Christians should therefore for the worst prepare, And bear with Patience the Events of War; For if we murmur when we lose the Day, We grin at Heav'n, in whom the Vict'ry lay, And shew 'tis our Presumption, when we fight, To claim Success, as if our native Right. This sinful Error makes the thankless Croud Violent, if cross'd; if fortunate, too proud, And spurs 'em on, when baffl'd by their Foes, Without just Cause, to seek Revenge on those Whom God and Cæsar for their Agents chose; Angry with Heav'n, they cavil and complain, And pour their Vengeance on the Heads of Men; Forgetting that wise Pow'r that does no Wrong, Declares not always for the Swift or Strong. How far must such Impatience disagree With the blest Rules of Christianity, That teach us, with an humble Breast, to bear The Turns of Fortune, both in Peace and War? Yet those, that would be thought the most refin'd, Are most to Fury and Revenge inclin'd, If Heav'n concurs not with their craving Mind. Blest with Success, they are profusely glad, And betwixt Wine and Joy, grow drunk and mad; Pray, as they guzzle, with excessive Zeal, And spare no Thanks, when ev'ry Thing goes well: But cross'd in Hopes, they murmur, tho' in vain, As if God only should be serv'd for Gain. So fiery Gamesters do to Fortune pray, And thank her when Success has crown'd their Play. But curse her when they lose, and cast the Dice away. Lady. You need not fear, their Malice they disguise At your Approach, with outward Flatteries: You wisely guard 'gainst those ensnaring Ills, That lurk beneath lame Praise, and treach'rous Smiles; You stand secure above that envious Race, Who always fawn on those they would displace, That those in Pow'r they mean to undermine, May less suspect the Mischiefs they design. But in your Absence, I am forc'd to bear With Wrongs and Insults I can scarce declare, Without that Warmth, wherein, I fear, you'll see The Weakness of my Sex and Quality. Commander. It is ignoble Envy, to perplex, With their provoking Tongues, the weaker Sex; But Malice loves to shew its Teeth to those Least able to defy the Grins of Foes; When with Reproaches they the Wife defame, 'Tis at the Husband's Honour that they aim. So when they level their rebellious Hate At Kings, they shoot thro' Ministers of State. But let me know what Stratagems they've us'd; What Scandals rais'd, what Falsities diffus'd. To recompence those Dangers I have run, Those Towns I've taken, and those Vict'ries won; Thar, by their vile Endeavours, I may see Their wonted Gratitude to mine and me; For 'tis the Nature of the snarling Race, To load just Merit with the most Disgrace: Envy looks upwards, and directs her Eyes Always to those that do the highest rise. Lady. They're not content to heap a thousand Wrongs Upon me, in your Absence, with their Tongues; Degrade my Honour with their false Reports, And spit their Venom o'er their Tavern-Quarts; But by no Laws, or fear of Justice aw'd, Disperse in Print their Calumnies abroad; Their Pride and Malice openly display, And tease me with fresh Scandal ev'ry Day; With odious Lies possess the list'ning Croud, And basely teach 'em to exclaim aloud; When all that they alledge, themselves devise, And only from the Dregs of Malice rise; Nor do they mean their envious Darts alone Should fall on me, but 'tis at you they're thrown For when you've reap'd fresh Lawrels in the Field, And News proclaims the thousands you have kill'd' Then with Invectives do they fill the Town, And pelt me most with scandalous Lampoon, In hopes the Lies they spread, to my Disgrace, May damp the Glories your Atchievements raise. Thus, when the Kingdom's truest Friends are glad At your Success, the factious Tribe grow mad, And ballance your good Actions with my bad. So subtle canting Knaves, who would defame A pow'rful Foe they know not how to blame, They blacken those in whom he most confides, And wound the Man they fear, thro' his Companion's Sides. Commander. I know too well the Measures that they take To make the Fav'rites they dislike, look black; In Coffee-house Whispers, how they vent their Spleen, And buz about those false Reports they glean From their quaint Leaders, who invent the same, To injure those they envy in their Fame. It is a Rule with Faction, to abate The Deeds of those they either fear or hate; To spurn at him the sov'reign Pow'r exalts, And into Mountains swell his Mole-hill Faults. True Merit always dazles Envy's Eyes; She blinder grows, as Fav'rites higher rise: Nor can her Malice view what's justly bright, But faneies, thro' the Weakness of her Sight, That she beholds strange Spots in ev'ry Orb of Light. So the Moon's distant Height deceives our Eyes, And makes us think she's blemish'd as she flies. The Great should be serene, their Minds compose Beneath the vain Assaults of barking Foes; Despise the Breath of Envy, when they know It only does with harmless Fury blow. Such windy Storms the factious Tribe will vent, And when they're least oppos'd, they're soonest spent. The Clouds they raise, no hurtful Thunder bear, Or pointed Flames, but vanish into Air. Like Smoke their black'ning Malice flies away, And is too thin to cause one gloomy Day, So nauseous Fogs, that do from Fens arise, May darken, for a Time, the azure Skies; But still the Sun preserves his native Light, And conquers all that seems to make him bright. Your Greatness, Madam, therefore should despise The mean Efforts of worthless Enemies, Who, when their spiteful Tongues are best in Tune, Can only bark, like Puppies, at the Moon. The Wise no Credit to their Malice give, And who would value what the Fools believe? Let 'em rail on, it is their ancient Use; No Prince could e'er escape their false Abuse. You cannot be the worse for their Dispraise, Since good Men know, they labour to debase The greatest Vertue with the most Disgrace. So Fiends and Witches are not to molest The Bad, but bend their Envy tow'rds the Best. Lady. But since Mankind in Malice so abound, That no Man's Honour can escape a Wound, But those in Pow'r, who stand securely high, Must even bear the Scourge of Calumny; Why should the daring Press be thus allow'd To midwife Scandal to the brainless Croud, Who to the worst misconstrue ev'ry Hint, And will believe whate'er they read in Print, Especially if levell'd at the Great, Or impudently meant t'abuse the State? What strange Invectives through the Town are spread, And on the Tables of Sedition laid? What odious Scandal daily bawl'd about, To cozen and inflame the giddy Rout; And yet no Measures taken to redress The growing Grievance of the vitious Press, By whose dark Labours thousands are misled, And basely fit for any Mischief made; Obscene Collections crowded into Sheets, Are mouth'd by noisy Harlots thro' the Streets, And bought by Youth, that they may feel betimes The Force of wanton Prose, and bawdy Rhimes? In Print Religion's banter'd thro' the Town, The Sectaries cry'd up, the Church cry'd down; Government slander'd by rebellious Pens, And Bedlam-Schemes advanc'd by frantick Brains; The common Herd made greater than their Prince, By Arguments reviv'd, condemn'd long since; Whole Reams of weekly Filth are cry'd aloud, Not to amuse, but to delude the Croud, That thro' Mistake they may misconstrue those, Who are their Friends, to be their only Foes, That cunning Knaves, in whom the Fools confide, May make 'em Slaves to their fanatick Pride. So the sly Thief, that means to do the Wrong, Cries watch your Pockets, when amidst the Throng, That with more Safety he his Game may play, And unsuspected stand or slide away. Since with these Evils, and a thousand more, Th'unbridl'd Press torments us o'er and o'er, Confounds the People, and the publick Peace, As well as Ease of private Families, 'Tis strange the Laws should want sufficient Force To stop ill Freedoms, that each Day grow worse; Or that the learned Heads, that prop the State, Should wink at Mischiefs that appear so great! Commander. The open Press diverts the giddy Town; Makes one Side laugh, to see the other frown; Does diff'rent Parties diff'rent Lessons teach, And, with fresh Wedges, still supplies the Breach: Each struggling Sect must be allow'd their Scribes, To animate and please their sev'ral Tribes, That o'er their Coffee they may smile to see Their Opposites made black with Infamy. This weekly Libel highly is extoll'd By Fools, because 'tis impudently bold, In tugging some grave Prelate by the Beard, Who, for his Learning, has been long rever'd; Fam'd for his Precepts, honour'd by the Crown, Because a Glory to the Church and Gown; Yet made, perhaps, the Sport of the R?w, To please some envious Knipper dolling Crew: But wise Men, as old Witches do their Pray'rs, Should never mind what such a Scribe avers, But always backward read his Characters. Another railing Pamphlet is ador'd, 'Cause written to defame some noble Lord, Who is, perhaps, too pious, just and great, To flatter Faction, or deceive the State; But with an upright Conscience steers his Course, And scorns to make what's bad, for Int'rest, worse; Yet 'cause he's honest, Knaves must count him high, And then to please the Tribe that lower fly, He must within the Reach of Nob's Oak-Towel lie. But Men of Sense all know his scoundrel Pen Was ever brib'd, t'abuse the best of Men; Therefore whate'er he writes, small Credit gains, 'Mongst Readers blest with either Grace or Brains. A third, by some raw Scribler, is design'd To gain Applause by scourging all Mankind; Respects no Party, but is purely meant T'amuse the World, and wrong the Innocent, By groundless Scandal, which he takes on Trust, Or his own Fictions, equally unjust. Such study'd Shams must make the City Sport, By side Reflexions cast upon the Court: To Day at this Great Man the Author squints, To Morrow he at that fine Lady hints, For Scandal most delights the spiteful Tribe, And makes 'em Fautors of each daring Scribe. So he that courts a cross ill-natur'd Dame, T'expose her Charms, to sooth his am'rous Flame, Against all other Women ought to rail, And only speak extravagantly well Of her, with whom he labours to prevail. Besides, such fiery Squibs inflame the Fools, And for sly Projects, make 'em hot-brain'd Tools: By such loose Scribblers, crafty Leaders find, At all Times, how their Parties stand inclin'd, And when the wav'ring Zealots change their fickle Mind. The Saints can now their ancient Freedom use; Say what they please, and whom they please abuse; Extol their Friends, their Opposites revile, And spread their dang'rous Poysons thro' the Isle; Advance their Int'rest, and by Shams delude, For their bye Ends, the brainless Multitude, That the blind Crowd may strenuously agree To propagate a slavish Liberty. Thus thoughtless Fools are oft, with little Pains, Decoy'd, by promis'd Freedoms, into Chains. 'Tis for these Reasons the unbridl'd Press Is made a publick Grievance, past Redress, 'Till the Scene changes into better Times, And Men, thro' Smart, grow conscious of their Crimes. Then may we hope, when we enjoy a Peace, That home-bred Strife may in some Measure cease, And all those Mischiefs which perplex the Land, Be timely, for the Nation's Ease, restrain'd; 'Till then, like others, we must be content, And bear, with Patience, what we can't prevent. The Great have always Enemies, that seek T'eclipse their Fame, and make their Int'rest weak. Envy abhors to see another soar Above her Pitch, in Honour, Wealth, or Pow'r; Where'er she dwells, the Fiend must grate her Teeth, And to the Hurt of others, spend her Breath: But 'tis beneath the Great to heed her Spite; She often grins, without a Tush to bite. 'Tis Wisdom therefore to despise each Foe, Who only can in Words their Malice show; For if they find that their Reproach can tease Your Breast, they then grow Masters of your Ease. Like me, make all their Barkings but your Sport, The less you mind their Wrongs, the less they hurt. Lady. 'Tis good Advice; but who can hear her Name Bawl'd thro' the Streets by Scoundrels, to her Shame? And as her Coach conveys her thro' the Town, See Porters conning o'er the vile Lampoon, And Coblers in their Stalls their Work forsake, To read those Lies the factious Scribblers make? Who can with Patience bear such vile Reproach, And hear the Mob cry, pointing, That's her Coach? What Lady so provok'd, can easy sit, And free from Passion, to such Wrongs submit? What's Honour, when with Toils and Hazards gain'd, If basely suffer'd to be thus profan'd? Or who that's raised above the Croud, can boast Their Station, if their Fame shall thus be lost? Who can be truly great, in War or Peace, That wants the Pow'r to punish Wrongs, like these? 'Tis Fear of Justice makes the Croud adore? Without Revenge, the Wealthy are but poor. What's Grandeur, but a vain and empty Show, If injur'd by the Frape that crawl below; And falsely loaded, when the Vermin please, With base Affronts, and spiteful Calumnies? Such Greatness is with servile Patience yok'd, That tamely fears to punish, when provok'd. Those that climb high, should always be severe, Or envious Mortals, in an humble Sphere, Will scorn those aweful Pow'rs they ought to fear. Commander. But 'tis beneath the Noble to resent The groundless Stories that the Croud invent. Who would their Bosom with Revenge inflame, That knows the Scandal cannot wound their Fame? Such poor inferior Malice could not move The Great, but be despis'd by those above. The gen'rous Mastiff does, with Patience, bear The Yelps of little Curs h'has Pow'r to tear; So should the Brave, unmov'd to Anger, scorn The Spite of Fools, unworthy of Return; For 'tis ignoble in the Great, to seek Revenge upon the Worthless, and the Weak. Besides, consider that the Wise advance Their Riches by the Publick's Ignorance. 'Tis at their Cost that we enlarge our Fame; Their Oversights give us the wealthy Game. Suff'rers, to ease their Minds, will Silence break, And Losers always must have leave to speak. Moral Reflexions on the foregoing Dialogue. [Should those who climb the upper Sphere] Should those who climb the upper Sphere, And turn the mighty Wheel of State, To Envy's lying Tongue give Ear, 'Twould be a Torment to be Great. The Croud, they know not why, approve This Man's good Fortune, t'other's Fate; But of the two, their fickle Love Proves oft more dang'rous, than their Hate. He therefore shews himself most wise, That courts no popular Esteem; But when he does to Greatness rise, Thinks publick Praise a noisy Dream: Nor is he truly brave, that fears What Malice to his Charge can lay; But unprovok'd, with Safety steers, In spite of all his Foes can say. No factious Party ever loves The prosp'rous Fav'rites of a Crown; But whomsoe'er the Court approves, The other are for pulling down. T'as always been a Rule with those, Who from their lawful Duty swerve, To rail at Men of Worth, as Foes, And cry up Knaves that least deserve. DIALOGUE XIV. Between a spend-thrift Gentleman, who had run out his Estate, and his prudent Lady, about disposing of her Jointure, to supply his farther Extravagance. Gentleman. The Smart of my past Follies now I feel; 'Tis Time that I my present Streights reveal, Or Ruin to us both must soon ensue, If at this Juncture not delay'd by you; Therefore I hope you'll answer my Request, And of two Evils, wisely chuse the least. Lady. If what you ask to both our Welfare tends, We're jointly bound to be each other's Friends: In such a Case, I nothing can deny; My Duty then commands me to comply: But if you only want me to postpone Your Ruin, by compleating of my own, And, by false Glosses, aim at my Consent To things ill offer'd, and unjustly meant, If my weak Judgment should be so surpriz'd, I hope you'll grant me Time to be advis'd; For Women thro' Mistake, may fear to find Hurtful Events from what is well design'd. But pray, my Dear, what is it you request? Let not your Case be eloquently drest; In all Affairs, Plain-dealing is the best. Gentleman. Long have I been imprudent, I confess, Deaf to Advice, and blind to Happiness, Till my vain Course, which I repent too late, Has drein'd my Bags, and lavish'd my Estate; Impair'd my Credit, swell'd my Debts too large, For all my present Substance to discharge: My Houses and my Lands incumber'd are With Sums as weighty as their Worth will bear. In short, my All is now in others Pow'r, And with a Jayl I'm threaten'd ev'ry Hour; Nor can I hope, 'less you, my Dear, are kind, For better Usage, than to starve confin'd. Lady. How oft have I in vain, with flowing Eyes, Implor'd you to receive my kind Advice; By all th'Indearments of a tender Wife, Engag'd you to reclaim your vitious Life; Foretold the Bitters that attend the Sweets Of drunken Revels, and luxurious Treats; The Plagues and Curses that so oft arise From wanton Jilts, and their expensive Joys; The Sums they waste, and Ruin that attends Your hugging worthless Flatterers for Friends; Your Racing, Hunting, costly Games and Sports, Your base Intrigues, and amorous Efforts, With an unjust and scandalous Intent To injure and debauch the Innocent? Have I not weeping, prostrate on my Knees, Told you the fatal Consequence of these; Beg'd you to stop you your ruinous Career, Before Destruction was advanc'd so near? Yet my kind Counsels no Amendment wrought, Or could my Lectures raise one sober Thought; But still the same ill Courses would you run, As if you madly strove to be undone. Therefore, since thus you've lavish'd your Estate, And would not see your Errors, till too late; What can you ask of an unhappy Wife, That shares the Mis'ries of a needy Life, Unless 'tis something that, of Course, must tend To make us both more wretched in the End? Gentleman. 'Tis in your Pow'r to yield me a Supply, And on your Goodness I alone rely; 'Less you can pity my unhappy State, A Prison, for my Life, must be my Fate. My past Imprudence has been great, I own; I no Excuse can plead for what I've done: Yet sure so good a Wife cannot refuse Forgiveness to a poor repenting Spouse; Or let him lose his Liberty, for want Of a kind Boon, that's in her Pow'r to grant; For Love and Duty bind the marry'd Pair To share the Burthens of each other's Care, Both are by mutual Obligations ty'd, And should not for themselves apart provide; But ought, without the least Reserve, to bear Each other's Crosses, and alike should fare; And not, like Buckets in a Well, for one To rise, whilst t'other sinks the lower down, What Woman, in the School of Vertue bred, Who does the World's Reproach and Scandal dread Can see her Husband drowning, and refuse her Aid? Lady. I'm now condemn'd, I find, before I'm try'd; You have not ask'd as yet, or I deny'd. What you intend, when you reveai, I fear, Will dang'rous to your self or me appear: 'Tis not without some Reason you digest So long a Preface to a short Request. The cunning Pleaders of the doubtful Laws, Harangue the most in a deceitful Cause; And subtile Statesmen, who preside at Court, Always speak fairest, when they mean most Hurt. Why thus the Op'ning of your Mind suspend, Unless your Meaning had some noxious End? However, let me know how far you would Impose on a weak Woman, if you could; And if I find what you require, does lie Within the Bounds of Duty, I'll comply: But should your Importunities extend Beyond what human Reason can defend, Tho' bound in Wedlock, Woman still is free To guard against approaching Misery; For tho' Man lords it o'er his female Mate, Self-Preservation, in a nuptial State, Justly becomes a prudent Woman's Care, When she beholds her Husband's Ruin near, Who always was too wise for good Advice, But, wedded to his Harlot's Cups and Dice, Would make his own Destruction his unhappy Choice. Had I superfluous Bags to ease your Want, The wealthy Hoard I would be glad to grant; But if you aim, as I have Cause to fear, At what concerns my Happiness more near, Believe no Duty can enjoin a Wife T'embrace, that can prevent, a wretched Life. Gentleman. To make me safe, there is no Way, but one, And that depends on your Consent alone. You have already div'd into my Breast; I find I need not tell you my Request: You know how far 'tis in your Pow'r to save Your Spouse from what's more fatal than the Grave; For he that does his Liberty survive, Worse than if dead, is bury'd whilst alive, And even wants that Comfort to foresee When the kind Fates will end his Misery. This will be my hard Case, lest you relent, And by your Aid th'impending Doom prevent; For I've no Friend but you, that can impede The threat'ning Storm that gathers o'er my Head. I therefore hope, my Dear, you'll not postpone My present Safety, to consult your own Apart from mine; but chearfully agree To hazard all, that I once more may be From the harsh Threats of Duns, and Bayliff's Insults free. Lady. Well may you be asham'd of your Request; Tho' not declar'd, your Meaning may be guest. However, lest I should mistake your Aim, And censure wrong, when you deserve no Blame, Pray, tho' you blush to tell me, let me hear Whether you build your Hopes on what I fear; For 'tis ill Manners, courting Lovers say, Before the Question's ask'd, to answer Nay. Gentleman. I have already told you my Distress, And all the Hardships of my present Case; How deeply I'm involv'd, what 'tis I dread; How wretched by my youthful Follies made: Yet, to relieve my Wants, would you but sell Your Jointure, my Affairs might yet do well: With Part of that I might my Debts compound, And in some Post lay out a thousand Pound; Good Husband turn, and by Industry raise The Sums I've spent a thousand foolish Ways. Who knows how lucky the last Stake may prove, Would you but give this Instance of your Love? Fortune has always some good Chance in Store For those, whose gen'rous Deeds have made 'em poor. Lady. And have you broach'd, at last, your kind Intent? I guest before what all your Stam'ring meant. If you've one Grain of Justice in your Breast, Well may you blush at such a base Request; Which, if I granted, we the worse should fare, And both be made more wretched than we are. You've lop'd already ev'ry Branch and Shoot, And now that's spent, you're aiming at the Root. Was not my Fortune answerably great To your ill-got, unfortunate Estate? Was I not young and fair, of equal Birth, Agreable in Person and in Worth? And now my Dowry's wasted and mispent, And your own Lands involv'd for Money lent, Would you make me, to your eternal Shame, An equal Suff'rer, who deserves no Blame? Have I, by vain Extravagance or Pride, Impair'd your Wealth; your Credit misapply'd? Have I been fond of ev'ry Mode that's new, Or sunk your Bags to make a gawdy Shew? Have I been craving, in the Course you've run, To make a sep'rate Purse, as some have done? Have I not oft in Tears your Fate foretold, Unless you timely would your Speed with-hold; Begg'd you, in Words becoming of a Wife, To put a Stop to your luxurious Life? And after all, would you have me to share A Load of Mis'ries, I've no Right to bear; Give the last Stake into your Pow'r, to spend, On which, I fear, we now must both depend? No, I shall ne'er comply with your Request; You've spent your own, and I'll secure the rest. Have you no Issue? O! ingrateful Jew! And would you make your Children Beggars too? No, live, and let Repentance be your Doom, No Pity shall my Prudence overcome, No Child of mine, whilst I the Staff command, Shall be made wretched by a Mother's Hand. I'll not consent to your unjust Desires; Your Want of Care, the more in me requires. 'Tis true, the Husband ought to bear the Rule, But Duty binds no Wife to be a Fool. Gentleman. Should my Proposals to your Ruin tend, Against such Wrongs you should your self defend, Or should I aim to do my Children hurt, You justly might condemn the base Effort: But my Request is with a good Intent, And only for our mutual Safety meant. I'd pay my Debts, then buy some gainful Post, And labour to retrieve what I have lost; Convert your Kindness to a prosp'rous Use, And never more be foolish or profuse; Abjure each costly Vice, reclaim my Life, Cherish my Children, and indulge my Wife; Adhere to Bus'ness, nothing else pursue, But the sole Int'rest of my Babes and you: And question not, but we in Time shall see Our selves once more in full Prosperity; For tho' we've long been foolish, if the Mind Reforms, and to our Welfare stands inclin'd, And our Industry shews our good Intent, Heav'n crowns our Labours with a kind Event. But if these Motives are too weak to move Your Pity, or prevail upon your Love, By your Perverseness my Designs are crost, And whilst you dwell in Safety, I am lost. Lady. These are but Fictions, meltingly exprest, To move Compassion in a female Breast, That a weak Woman may consent to do Her self and Children Wrong, to pleasure you. What Post has your industrious Genius chose? To be a Rakish Captain, I suppose, That when I'm beggar'd, you abroad may roam, And leave your Babes and I to starve at Home; Turn mighty Hero in some foreign Field, Fight to grow rich; and conquer 'till you're kill'd; And all the Spoils and Trophies that you win, If you survive the Danger, shall be mine. Should I with these wild Projects but agree, I can but think how wealthy we should be! You at a Distance cloth'd in tatter'd Red; And me and mine distress'd for Want of Bread. Are these the Golden Dreams that fill your Brains? Must a red Coat produce these mighty Gains? Is it from thence your wond'rous Hopes arise, Of building Castles in the airy Skies? Is this the Care you'll take of me and mine, If I my only poor Remains resign? Since that's your Aim, successless shall you crave; I'll never part with what I've Pow'r to save; For he that's so imprudent, as to waste A clear Estate he might have still possest, When once reduc'd to Impotence and Want, Is seldom blest with Wisdom to invent New Methods to regain what foolishly he spent. Gentleman. Nay, if a Wife thus pitiless can prove, Bound to be kind by Duty and by Love, Where can I hope for Pity in Distress, Among the barb'rous Herd of human Race? What Help expect from the neglectful Hands Of fawning Flatterers, or frozen Friends? What Ease or Comfort from the snarling Duns Of craving Creditors, who seek my Bones? At last, what Friendship from a boist'rous Crew Of Bayliffs, Jaylors and the Lord knows who, Where dusky Vaults, with Doors and Windows barr'd, Must keep me close, and Villains be my Guard? Thus must I starve, confin'd to smoaky Air, Cold Water, and brown Crusts, perhaps, my Fare; With rusty Beard, and ragged Cloths disguis'd, By Foes insulted, and by Friends despis'd; Forsaken by my Children and my Wife; O! who can bear with such a dreadful Life? Such frightful Mis'ries now advanc'd so nigh, Will surely give me Courage to defy Man's Pow'r, and rather chuse to stab and die. Lady. But hold, my Dear, your Passion soars too high; These ought to be your Fears, should I comply: Then might we idly lavish our Remains, And Starving be the fatal Consequence; But whilst we keep this Residue entire, We're safe, at worst, from all those Wants you fear; For should a Prison be at last your Fate, You shan't alone peep thro' the dismal Grate. Whate'er your Suff'rings or Misfortunes prove, I'll still maintain my Duty and my Love, And with you share, like an obedient Wife, The worst Afflictions that attend your Life; Cherish, indulge, love, honour and obey, So far as in a just and righteous Way; But ne'er consent, whilst I behold the Light, To wrong my Children of their native Right; For what fond prudent Mother would agree To ruin such young Plants, to prop a falling Tree. Gentleman. On second Thoughts, I cannot blame your Care; Your Answer's just, and my Request unfair. I no Misfortune dread, I'm now at Ease, And thank you for your kind Assurances. Let the worst happen, I'll enjoy Content; Your faithful Love gives Freedom in Restraint, He's always arm'd against a wretched Life, That's happy in a just and prudent Wife. Moral Reflexions on the foregoing Dialogue. [Ill Husbands often blame their Wives] Ill Husbands often blame their Wives For good Advice and needful Care, When, were it not for them, their Lives Would be more wretched than they are. What Woman can with Patience see Her Husband lavish his Estate, And then at his Request agree To make her Miseries more great? The Man that's to his Ruin bent, Is not alone a Fool, but Knave, If once he asks his Wife's Consent To sell what she has Pow'r to save. What Punishment does such a Wretch, Amidst his vitious Life, deserve, Who, to indulge a lustful Itch, Would bring his Family to starve? Most careless Husbands, when undone, Upon their Wives will cast the Blame, When their own Vices make it known, That to themselves they owe their Shame. Therefore the Wife that brings a Dow'r, And has a Settlement in Lieu, Is wise, that keeps it from the Pow'r Of him that does his Lusts pursue. DIALOGUE XV. Between a Dissenting Alderman, and his High-Church Lady. Alderman. Why to St. Paul's, my Dear? What make you chuse A Church that Jacobites and Papists use, Where English Mass is lyrick'd o'er by Boys, And Popish Bagpipes make a hideous Noise? How can a sober Christian be devout Amidst such Fa-la-la, and Toot-a-Toot? A Jargon that profanes the Sabbath-Day, And makes you fitter far to dance, than pray? Lady. 'Tis strange, my Love, that your mis-judging Ear Can the hoarse Croakings at your Meeting hear, Where ev'ry Saint affects a diff'rent Tone, And the sad Tribe, instead of singing, groan; Led by a Clerk, as stupid as a Post, Who drawls the Psalm, and chants like any Ghost; As if to sing God's Praise, was to rejoyce, Not with a chearful, but a frightful Voice. How can your Soul such anxious Discord bear, Or take Delight in a tremendous Jar; Yet snarl at Musick so divinely sweet, Where heav'nly Sounds in heav'nly Order meet; Such that are only fit to praise the Lord, And join our list'ning Souls with one Accord? The Hebrew Psalmist, after God's own Heart, Did on his Harp his holy Praise exert; Establish'd Musick in the House of Pray'r, And daily had his heav'nly Consorts there, That his blest Mind might be the higher rais'd, And Heav'n with greater Fervency be prais'd. His Son, the wisest of the Kingly Race, With Musick did his holy Temple grace; All Sorts their chearful Harmony exprest, That the Lord's People might the more be blest, And that the sacred Dwelling might be found Less rich in Gold and Saphir, than in Sound. Since these divine Examples Scripture brings Down from the wisest and the best of Kings, And in sweet Harmony each heav'nly Mind Does such Refreshments in Devotion find, What stupid Mortal can, without Abuse To Heav'n, object against it's pious use, Unless debarr'd, by a defective Ear, Of Blessings which more perfect Christians hear? To such, the Charms of Musick are no more, Than artful Painting to a grov'ling Boar; Poetick Raptures to an Ideot spoke, Or the bright Diamond to the Fable-Cock. Your Dullness therefore the Objection makes, Or else you're lectur'd into dark Mistakes; For Musick must, with heav'nly Pleasures, fill The Soul, left deaf by Nature, or by Will. It is a short-liv'd Taste of future Joys, To which the Saints in full Perfection rise; For all we hope hereafter to possess, Are everlasting Harmony and Peace, Express'd in Hallelujahs which shall never cease. Alderman. What signifies this High-Church long Harangue? Musick, I find, has giv'n your Tongue a Twang. Tho' David and his Son, in ancient Time, Had their Church-Pipes, they now may be a Crime What, tho' they did on Flutes and Cornets play, We're Christians now, and more refin'd than they. D'ye make no Diff'rence, in your High-Church Flights 'Twixt Protestants, and Jewish Israelites? Would you profane the People of the Lord, And make 'em with their mouldy Rites accord? So Aaron, Pack-horse like, wore Bells, they say; Why don't your High-Priest do the like, I pray? No, you've improv'd your Bells t' a heavier Weight; The Drudg'ry now would be, alas! too great Therefore they are aloft in Steeples hung, To please the Rooks and Jackdaws, when they're rung, And madly jangl'd o'er the Western Porch, To chime your slothful Worshippers to Church; Pull'd round at Weddings, to disturb the Town, And pick the Bridegroom's Pocket of a Crown; Rung out at Fun'rals, that the Heir, with Joy, May pay his Father's Farewel, or his Foy; Clatter'd thro' all the Kingdom, to amuse The Land, at ev'ry trifling Piece of News. These, like your Organs, are Church-Musick too; But pray what Good do all their Thunder do? A Bell may at a Tavern-Bar be hung, Because less noisy than a Woman's Tongue, And may be rung, to give the Draw'r a Call, To prevent Madam's more ingrateful Squall. So may your Heathen Bag pipes be of Use In Smithfield Booth, or Wapping Musick-house, That drunken Sea-men, and their wanton Trulls, May shake their Heels, to please the gazing Fools. But in a Church, the Babylonian Noise Is only fit to please the Girls and Boys: The Voices of the People all are drown'd, And their Praise stifl'd by the Jargon Sound, That when they sing, they might as well be dumb For Nothing's heard but Tweedle-diddle-hum. Besides, what Saint can hear the Church profan'd With noisy Pipes, that do in Brothels stand, And not, with blushing Shame and Anger, see The roaring Piece of vain Idolatry Stand up exalted, gilt and painted o'er, Like that vile Jezabel, the scarlet Whore? Ah! Wife, they much offend this godly Town, And when the Saints bear Rule, they must come down; For to God's House it is a great Abuse, To have those wicked Instruments in Use, Whose vile unhallow'd Whistles roar aloud In Fairs and Brothels, to delight the Croud. Lady. I find, my Dear, you're wonderful precise, But still must think you are more nice than wise. Why at your Ev'ning-Lectures do ye use Candles, since Strumpets do the same in Stews? The Bible too you may as well condemn, Because we find the Wicked read the same: Why not our Garments from our Bodies tear, Since Whores and Rogues do the like Clothing wear? Or why with a safe Conscience say your Pray'rs In English, since the Rake in English swears? Shame on your Folly, to condemn what's good, Because it's us'd profanely by the Lewd. You may as well cry, Pull the Churches down, 'Cause, Play-house like, they're built with Brick and Stone; And rais'd, perhaps, by the same Hands that rear A Popish Chappel, or a Theatre. If these are all th'Objections you can raise Against Church-Musick, which exalts our Praise, A rev'rend Teacher of your own, long since, Has said enough t'explode your Ignorance. Thus, in his Works, the good old Man, we find, To his dissenting Flock declares his Mind. ‘‘As Spectacles cause weak and aged Sight ‘To read the holy Text with more Delight, ‘So Musick in the Praise of God, 'tis plain, ‘Comforts and elevates the Soul of Man. Alderman. Singing is Musick; but he does not say That noisy Organs should in Churches play; Pipes in ill Houses practis'd, to entice Unwary Youth into expensive Vice. I say, and still by what I say I'll stand, That 'tis a Scandal to a Christian Land: A sad Offence, that what so long has been In Brothels us'd, should be in Churches seen. I say, they're filthy Pipes, that hum and squeak In Moorfields Bawdy-houses all the Week; And therefore should not be allow'd to play In the Lord's House upon the Sabbath-Day: They're odious Baubles, and their Practice shew They serve both God and wicked Mammon too. I cannot bear 'em, talk of 'em no more, I'd rather hear the Tower Lyons roar; I tell thee they're the Bag-pipes of the Whore. Lady. Let not your Warmth, my Dear, your Passion sway; Pray hear me, I have something more to say, Since you allow the Church should never chuse, For sacred Uses, what the World misuse, And that the Organ's shameful, 'cause employ'd, Where lawless Freedoms are too oft enjoy'd; Why do your holy Teahers preach in Halls, So oft debauch'd with drunken Festivals; Where Gluttons meet in Crouds, with a Design To gorge on Dainties, and inebrious Wine, Till surfeited with both; then reel away, And stagg'ring, shew how they've abus'd the Day; Yet, without Scruple, you, the Sons of Grace, Can chuse, for Worship, the unhallow'd Place, And the next Sabbath bait the scarlet Whore, Where Sots their Bumpers swill'd the Day before, And stuff'd their Guts like Swine, instead of Men, Till their swoll'n Paunches could no more contain; Yet to those Swill-tubs you can have Recourse, There preach and pray without the least Remorse; And, notwithstanding it so oft has been Profan'd, and made by vain Excess unclean, Yet to your Hall you can be reconcil'd, Tho' ne'er so much with drunken Sins defil'd; But dare not tread your Foot on holy Ground, For fear the Organ, by its heav'nly Sound, Should your proud Zeal and squeamish Conscience wound; And all that gives your Conscience Discontent, Ill Houses have debauch'd the Instrument, Thus squeamish Saints, who from the Church withdraw, O'er Mountains leap, and stumble at a Straw. What tho' in Brothels they should Organs build, Yet those in Churches rais'd, are ne'er defil'd. They never breath their Harmony, or play, But to exalt the Service of the Day, And by their heav'nly Sweetness, to incline The Soul to only think of Things divine; To chase away ill Thoughts that interfere, And make our Church-Devotion less sincere. So holy David tun'd his heav'nly Lyre, That the evil Spirit might from Saul retire: But you, my Dear, are worse possess'd than he, And even fly the Pow'r of Harmony; With frighted Ears the Charms of Musick shun, Will by no heav'nly Influence be won, But with the Fiend that haunts you, to your Meeting run. So wand'ring restless Spirits fly the Light, And in dark Shades and Caverns seek the Night. Alderman. O! wicked Jezabel! what is't you mean? D'ye think your Husband mad, you Popish Quean? Am I possest with an infernal Sprite, You Witch of Endor, nay, you Jacobite? Must I be lectur'd thus, you Harradan, Because I am not of your High-Church Clan? Avaunt, thou Satan, I abhor thy Pipes, The very Name torments me with the Gripes. Organs! their filthy Tootings fright my Soul. Do People come to Church to caterwaul? Must noisy Hum-drum pass for holy Praise? Why don't you dance too, when your Musick plays? Can empty Sound with holy Psalms agree, Like Tweedle-diddle, Hey Boys, up go we? I'm a true Low-Church Protestant, and hate To hear your Pipes, in whose Defence you prate: Their odious Sound shall never take with me; Their very Breath smells strong of Popery; And when their Anti-christian Toots I hear, I fancy that the scarlet Whore is near. I'll by no Dagon Witchcraft be o'ercome; Pipe me no Pipes, I hate their wicked Hum. Lady. I find, my Dear, you are a perfect Saint, Skill'd more in Calumny, than Argument, That can a thousand bug-bear Names devise, To blacken what you love to stigmatize, That the rank Venom you imbib'd, when young, May on the Church be darted with your Tongue, Tho' the vile Dirt on sacred Walls you throw, And inbred Malice your Invectives show, Are all too weak and windy, to prevail With any but the spiteful Sons of Baal, Whose fiery Zeal does from their Malice rise, And only is ill Nature in Disguise; Whose best Religion is but formal Shew, And Faith inclining to be ever new; For their great Rule is only to disgust, And quarrel with the Pow'r that's uppermost. So Dung-hill Poultry always look awry, And cackle at those Birds that higher fly; Take all, whose stronger Pinions make their Flights Above their Level, to be Hawks or Kites. Nor is a nearer Path to Heav'n, your Aim; Your Purity, alas! is all but Sham. 'Tis Int'rest makes you from the Church dissent, And for more Gain, you would your Choice repent; Tell Beads, sing Mass, or hear the Organ play, If Idol Gold was but to pave the Way; For he that will for Int'rest, put a Force On human Reason, and will chuse the worse, Would soon embrace the better, to enrich his Purse The Saints, who are to worship Mammon giv'n, Always think Wealth the safest Path to Heav'n. Alderman. O! vile presumptuous Pestilence, to preach On holy Things beyond a Woman's Reach. Thou Female Perkinite, I'll find a Day To make thee know thou'rt in a dang'rous Way. Now I'm in haste, and cannot stay so long As to convince thee, what thou say'st is wrong. Tis the 'Change-Hour, and Bus'ness must have Place, There's Time for Gain, as well as saving Grace. Lady. Go, Miser, cant no more of Grace to me; The only Hell thou fear'st, is Poverty. Thou seek'st no future Heav'n, beyond thy Gold; For that, thy Conscience has been bought and sold: And tho' you leave the Church for City-Halls, Yet, like a true Low Saint, when Int'rest calls, You can forsake the Meeting, for St. Paul's. Moral Reflexions on the foregoing Dialogue. [Those to the Love of Money bred] Those to the Love of Money bred, Altho' they mighty Zeal profess For Church or Meeting, will be led By Int'rest, which our Saints call Grace. Tho' with the Church they disagree, They soon can let their Scruples fall; A Prospect of Prosperity Must be allow'd a heav'nly Call. The Hopes of Wealth directs the Way, Inclines 'em to be cool or warm: Thus Int'rest does their Conscience sway, And lets 'em loose, or keeps 'em firm. Their Cavils, which they Scruples call, Are only Blinds, by which they hide Their Av'rice, and the Dev'l and all, That lurk beneath their stiff-neck'd Pride. The Popish Smock's a great Offence, The Catcalls fright 'em with their Mew; But yielding these, won't please the Saints, Without the Church Revenue too. The Fools dissent they know not why, The Crafty for their private Ends; But either, could they gain thereby, Would gladly with the Church be Friends. DIALOGUE XVI. Between a melancholy unfortunate old Merchant, and his parsimonious saving Lady. Merchant. Bad News, my Dear, the Greyhound Gally's lost, She stranded homewards on the Spanish Coast. What malign Planet threatens my Affairs, And thus torments me in my silver Hairs? My younger Labours with Success were crown'd, But in my Age the Fruits of all are drown'd. What have I acted that could thus displease That Pow'r that governs the tempestuous Seas? Two Vessels in the Compass of two Years, Bound outwards, taken by the Privateers; Three richly laden, by the Winds and Waves Were sunk, and lie entomb'd in liquid Graves. Beneath these Shocks, what Measures shall I take? If Credit fail me, I at once must break. Bills for three thousand Dollars must I pay; My Door will now be haunted ev'ry Day. Notes of my Hand besides grow due apace, Which, if delay'd, will publish my Disgrace. What shall I do, or how maintain my Ground? My present Wants require two thousand Pound: Nor can I hope to raise it, but by Friends, Who always fail him most, that most depends. Lady. Be patient, Love, disorder not your Mind; Fortune next Year, perhaps, may prove more kind. You have not yet consider'd how to steer Your Course, to shun those Rocks and Shelves you fear. You've Goods enough within your present Pow'r, To fetch that Sum you mention, ev'ry Hour. Your Disappointments have been great, I own, But you're to blame to think your self undone. 'Tis true, you have some Cause for your Complaints, But cannot be beneath such pressing Wants; I know your Prudence has been much too great To venture on the Seas your whole Estate. Therefore, my Dear, before you thus despair, Know rightly in what Circumstance you are: Think not of Friends; they may, perhaps, be shy, But your own Wants with your Effects supply. Your Vaults and Ware-houses with Goods are pil'd; Why then do you despond, since they are fill'd? Give but your Broker upon 'Change the Pow'r To sell, and you can need no Friend, I'm sure. Merchant. That Cure will prove much worse than the Disease, There's no Demand of my Commodities. The Town's already full, the Price but low; To vend 'em now my present Wants would show. What's stock'd in Shops this Winter will consume, Then will my Wares to a good Market come. But should I sell 'em now, the World would see My Loss has drove me to Necessity: Then would my Credit sink, and all Men fear, Who see such dang'rous Symptoms once appear, That the destructive Plague of Bankrupcy was near. The common Rule of Trade does thus advise, Sell nothing low, that you're assur'd will rise. Lady. But, since your present Pressures are so great, You cannot for a better Market wait. Your Case, you say, is desp'rate, and your Need, As Matters stand, must be supply'd with speed. Your present Safety you must first regard; No future Gain should be to that preferr'd. Such ill-tim'd Av'rice, when your Ruin's near, May hurry on those Dangers which you fear: But I'm in hopes you'll find some other Way To clear the Aspect of a frowning Day, Disperse those angry Clouds you seem to dread, And keep the Storm from falling on your Head. Therefore consult how far your Pow'r extends, But entertain no Thought of doubtful Friends. Against the worst I'd have you well provide; But Friends, in whom mistaken Fools confide, Most commonly withdraw, when in Distress they're try'd. Merchant. I have no present Way to raise Supplies, But by those Goods, which I foresee must rise, Unless to Friends I do my Streights declare, Or for large Premiums borrow Sums elsewhere. These are the only Measures I can use, And all so bad, I know not which to chuse. If, at the Price that's current, I dispose Of my best Wares, I Half in Half must lose; If, to my ablest Friends, I should apply, They may prove cool, and my Request deny: Nor will the craving Banker be content, Without too large a Premium for the Lent; And, if distrustful, ask my Ware house Key, Of twice the Worth, for his Security. I know no other Methods I can take, Yet still the worst is better than to break; But happy is the Man, who, when distrest, 'Twixt sundry Ways, knows how to chuse the best. Lady. I own I am not willing you should close With any of these Measures you propose. I fancy I a better Way can find, Than all the Methods you have yet design'd. Since you have been so kind a Spouse to me, Tender and loving to a high Degree, Walk up, I have a faithful Friend in Store, That will supply the Sum you need, or more. Take this, my Dear, I hope 'twill ease your Fears; That I have sav'd within these twenty Years; Yet nothing has been wanting, that could be A Credit to your self or Family: Your Tables have with wholesome Food been spread, Your Children all genteely cloth'd and bred; Your Friends at all Times welcome to the best; My self in decent good Apparel drest; Your Servants all suffic'd to their Content, That none could find just Reason of Complaint. I therefore hope you'll now despond no more, Or tease your Breast with Dreams of growing poor; But chear your Heart, and please your self to see The good Effects of my Frugality. Merchant. What's here? I'm quite astonish'd, I protest; My Dear, I am at once amaz'd and blest. What Providence thy saving Hand must guide To glean this Gold, so timely now apply'd? With Joy my Bus'ness now I can pursue; What Wonders Care and Diligence may do? This is a Blessing I could ne'er foresee, Owing to none but bounteous Heav'n and thee. What Thanks can I return, or how repay So kind a Present on a needful Day, When none but melancholy Scenes appear'd, And I, involv'd in Care, my Ruin fear'd? But pray, my Dear, add this to my Content, Inform me of your prudent Management, And how you came to raise, and thus possess So great a Sum, to serve me in Distress. Lady. You allow'd largely to maintain your House, More than enough, unless I'd been profuse. I never thought my self too proud or good To buy at the best hand our daily Food; Look'd o'er my Servants with a watchful Eye, Ne'er trusted to their Care or Honesty; But see their Bus'ness done without Abuse, And that they wasted nothing fit for Use. By this Observance, I had Pounds to spare At the Year's End, to recompence my Care: But had I thought my Quality too great To've stir'd from out my Velvet Chair of State, And trusted to my Maids, as others do, They'd sunk by Fraud, what I have sav'd for you; Lac'd Shoes and Furbeloes long since had spent The Fruits of my industrious Management. Besides, the yearly Money you allow'd, To make my self and your fair Daughters proud, I housewif'd well, and never would agree They should exceed the Rules of Decency. I ne'er affected any costly Sort Of Dress, because it was a Mode of Court, Or richly cloth'd my Girls, as if they'd been Lord's Daughters, and Companions for the Queen; But made 'em glad to modestly appear In decent Serges, manufactur'd here, And wore my self such Robes as best became The Birth and Station of a City-Dame. I ne'er was fond or forward, in my Life, To dress more flaunting than my Neighbour's Wife, Or vex'd to see her Sunday-Gown more fine, Or her gay Petticoat more rich than mine. I barter'd not my Gold for taudry Lace, Or with much Cost adorn'd my honest Face: I lov'd to keep my Riches in my Purse, Tho the Apparel that I wore was coarse, And not to hang it round me, to be seen In Beads and Bracelets, like an Indian Queen. I ne'er sipp'd Coffee, Chocolate, or Tea, Geneva, Brandy, Punch, or Ratefea; No Closet-Cordials had to drink apart, But with good English Ale could chear my Heart, Ne'er valu'd costly Junkets, Shews, or Plays, But lov'd at Home to spend my peaceful Days; With Care perform'd the Duties of my Life, Like a good Mother, Mistress, and a Wife. By these fair Means I have this Sum obtain'd, And hope in this Distress 'twill prove your Friends But if your present Wants should call for more, I have some Gold and Jewels yet in Store, Heav'n will not see so just a Man grow poor. Merchant. Thanks to my Dearest for this kind Supply, In spite of Loss, I'm overcome with Joy, Here's full enough to ease my present Cares, To save my Stock, and manage my Affairs. I now can pay my foreign Bills, and raise My sinking Credit to what Pitch I please; Be bold on 'Change, despise the Frowns of Fate, And fear no Hell-hound from the Counter-Gate. O! happy Woman! O! Indulging Wife! Whose nursing Care has giv'n my Age new Life. What can I say, or what hereafter do, That may requite this gen'rous Act in you? Money so blest, design'd for my Repose, I'm sure must prosper wheresoe'er it goes: Future Success, for certain, cannot miss To crown a Blessing unforeseen like this. My Losses now, I hope, I shall survive, And do not doubt but I apace shall thrive. Thy timely kind Assistance I foresee Will be attended with Prosperity. Ere long, my Dearest, thou shalt find thy Gold Shall be with Thanks return'd thee double-fold. My only Care, thro' the Remains of Life, Shall be to recompence so kind a Wife; To whose good Hand, now aged and distrest, I owe the Peace and Comforts of my Breast; Sure never Man before was in a Wife so blest. Lady. I'm highly glad, my Dear, I could command So large a Sum, to serve so true a Friend. 'Tis but my Duty to exert my Pow'r, To help you when a Storm begins to low'r; For she that sees her Husband on the Brink Of Danger stand, and suffers him to sink, Without endeav'ring gladly to preserve His Person or Repute, deserves to starve. She merits not that venerable Name Of Wife, but ought, to her eternal Shame, To be the Sport of Boys, and Mock of common Fame. Moral Reflexions on the foregoing Dialogue. [He that endeavours, tho' in vain] He that endeavours, tho' in vain, His Riches fairly to increase, Is still a just and honest Man, Tho' disappointed of Success. The Merchant, tho' he does provide Against the worst, must Hazards run; And tho' the Odds are on his Side, By vent'ring, he is oft undone. If by such Means Misfortunes fall, And Chance should thwart his good Intent, A Wife should freely part with all, Her Husband's Ruin to prevent. In such a Case, no marry'd Dame Should for herself apart provide, Because she cannot justly blame His wilful Folly, Vice, or Pride. Misfortunes, by our selves unsought, Are oft inflicted from above, No Wife, that knows her Duty, ought To let 'em cool her nuptial Love. A Woman should her utmost do, To yield an honest Spouse Supplies; Who does not, is a jilting Shrew, That's neither dutiful or wise. DIALOGUE XVII. Between the grave Philosopher, and his young scolding Wife. Philosopher. I find, my Dear, thy Tongue so restless proves, That like a running Stream it always moves; Takes wond'rous Pains, for very slender Thanks, And murmurs like a Brook between its Banks; All Day it gallops like a Gravesend Pad, And if I chance to spur, it runs like mad: Nor can the drowsy God of Silence keep The teasing Wasp from buzzing in its Sleep; For as loquacious Storms are thy Delight, The Thunder-Claps by Day that vent thy Spite, Eccho again in Dreams aloud at Night. Wife. She that wants Tongue, and is too calm to rave, Is born, if wed, to be a Husband's Slave: All Men are Tyrants to the weaker Sex, That have not Sense to study how to vex. The Tongue's a Woman's Weapon of Defence; To scold with Skill's a female Excellence: It guards her from the Insults of her Spouse, Prevents Neglect, and does his Spirits rouse. The Husband's always kindest to the Shrew, Glad to oblige, and careful to be true; Whilst the poor silent Fool that spares to speak, Shall scarce receive one Favour once a Week, But be despis'd, and lead a hateful Life, More like a worthless Vassal, than a Wife: Do this, I say, I charge you that forbear; Fine nuptial Musick in a Woman's Ear! When the kind Husband, if his Bride be wise, Fears to offend, and scorns to tyrannize; Never commands, but crys, my Dear, I pray, And asks in a petitionary Way; Courts the good Humour he is glad to find, And studies how to make and keep her kind. Wives, like proud Senators, that love to spake, Are more esteem'd, the greater Noise they make: One's honour'd by his Prince, because he's fear'd, The other by her Spouse the more endear'd; Whilst those subservient Wretches, silent Wives, Fare like nonspeaking Representatives, Because their patient, servile Tameness, shows, They're only fit to pass for Yea's and No's. Philosopher. But to talk always, like thy self, my Dear, What Man unmov'd, can such a Torment bear? No restless Tongue to factious Clamours bent, Can more Contention breed, or Malice vent, Than that rebellious Clack thou keep'st in Play, Which rowls, like Thunder, round my House all Day. Thy Breath, like raging Winds, maintains a Storm, And thy own Bell'wings keep thy Passion warm; Tho' in my Closet lock'd, I hear thee loud, As the fierce Language of a breaking Cloud; Nor in my studious Hours can I be free From your shrill Clamours at your Maid or me: 'Tis hard all Day, and when at Night in Bed, I only should with Æsop's Dish be fed. Consider, Love, that a vexatious Tongue Is a tough Bit to tug at, tho' 'tis young; I therefore beg, my Dear, that you'll prepare, Instead of so much Tongue, some better Fare, Or the harsh Tone of thy provoking Voice, Will make me blame my Love, and curse my Choice; For was I free, I'd sooner wed a Drum, Than thus be plagu'd with thy incessant Hum: You, without Cause, exert your noisy Heat, But that would never grumble, 'till 'twas beat. Wife. What signifies your Sense, above a Fool's, Or all your boasted Philosophick Rules, If you want Patience, in a marry'd State, To bear the Pratlings of your nuptial Mate? Woman must talk, and exercise her Tongue; You know her Reason's weak, her Passion's strong; Why then would you, so very learn'd and wise, Marry, to run the Hazard of her Noise? The Fiddle when untun'd, will grate the Ear, But, if you'll play on't, you the Sound must bear. He that abhors a Noise, and is so weak To pull the Bell-Rope in a foolish Freak, With Patience ought to hear the Clapper speak. He that, to please his Appetite, will take A Bees-Nest, for the luscio us Honey's Sake, If he be stung, no Discontent should show, Because he did before the Danger know. I thought a true Philosopher too wise For Care to o'er his Patience tyrannize; Too fix'd and resolute, his Soul too great To be disturb'd at Chance, or mov'd by Fate: A Man, so guarded against Grief and Pain, Which shock the Fibres of each common Brain, That no vexatious Sting had Pow'r to tease His steddy Mind, or interrupt his Ease; But, like a God, he could unmov'd sustain The heaviest Burthens, and their Weight disdain; Smile at those Plagues which harass human Race, And bear the worst Misfortunes with a Grace. But Wedlock makes Philosophers, I find, Forsake the Virtues of a steddy Mind, And represents 'em in that State of Care, But just as wife as other Husbands are. A Wife, forsooth, can't talk, but she must scold; If silent, she's too dull; if free, too bold; If airy, wanton; if reserv'd, precise; If she looks pleas'd, she's vitious with her Eyes. Thus all Men, in a marry'd State, concur, So says the Fool, so the Philosopher. All without Reason will their Censures pass, From the wise Teacher, to the worthless Ass: He that has ne'er an Eye, is not so blind, But in his Wife he can some Failing find; And still the more a Woman strives to please, Always the greater Faults a Husband sees. What Woman therefore, if it proves her Lot To wed a studious Sage, or learned Sot, Who among Calves-skin Doublets spends his Life, And doats upon his Books, instead of Wife, Would check the Freedom of her Tongue, to sooth A cloister'd Temper, surly and uncouth, That only with a marry'd State comply'd, To have a Nurse, much rather than a Bride, That you might preach up Duty to the Fool, Teach her t'obey, whilst you usurp the Rule; Make her believe she's taken from your Side, To only gratify your Lust and Pride; And that she's bound, by Marriage, to submit To ev'ry Edict that her Lord thinks fit? But 'tis not all your Gravity shall bring My Temper to obey my nuptial King; Nor all the artful Reas'nings you can shew, Philosophize a Creature call'd a Shrew; For since you find more Pleasure in your Books, Than in my tender Arms; or youthful Looks, Whene'er you reading sit, my Tongue shall walk, And when most silent you, I'll loudest talk; For starch'd Philosophy's in Wedlock worse, And to a youthful Bride a greater Curse, Than Woman's Tongue can be to you Philosophers. Philosopher. Too late Experience tells me, to my Grief, The marry'd Fool is curs'd beyond Relief: His Ease and Wisdom he at once forsakes, Who to his Arms a restless Woman takes. I find, alas! in Wedlock there can be No Room to exercise Philosophy. It is a State by Providence design'd To low'r our Pride, and level all Mankind; The Anti-Room of Death, where Women rule, And place the wise Man equal with the Fool: Both are but Slaves to their enchanting Arms, To Drudg'ry led in Triumph by their Charms; Which, like fine Paintings, that amuse the Sight, And touch the fond Spectator with Delight, At a due Distance always best appear, But lose their Witchcraft, when you come too near. Wife. So bookish Sots, like you, philosophize, 'Till, in your own Conceits, you're wond'rous wise. Fancy, like Marble-Statues, you can bear The Strokes of Fortune, and the Stabs of Care; And still unmov'd, a peaceful Breast secure Amidst those Torments weaker Minds endure; But, when you're touch'd with Plagues that others feel, I find your grave Philosophy must reel, And all your Wisdom out of Season shown, Prove but a broken Reed to lean upon. So the rank Coward has sometimes believ'd He's truly valiant, 'till he's undeceiv'd; But when he sees the threat'ning Danger near, His Blusters then are turn'd to pannick Fear. Philosopher. But true Philosophy preserves our Ease, In spite of all the World's Uncertainties; Right Contemplation arms the peaceful Breast With divine Patience, when the most opprest; Teaches us how to suffer, and despise The Wrongs of those that proudly tyrannize; To bear the worst Confinement or Restraint Without Resentment, or the least Complaint; To endure Poverty, Contempt, or Pain, With comely Grace, and resolute Disdain, That no Misfortune, tho' it's ne'er so great, May reach the Mind, to thwart its happy State; For he is only truly wise and brave, That smiling can behold the gaping Grave, In whose insatiate Cavity he knows Next Moment he shall take his sweet Repose. Wife. And can a Man, so hardy and so wise, That he can smile at Pain, and Want despise, Be tortur'd by a foolish Woman's Tongue, Because 'tis to her own Advantage hung? Shame on your weak Pretences, to defy Those Cares of Life no human Race can fly, And yet at once give up your boasted Ease, Unable to withstand a Woman's Tease. 'Tis strange the Prattle of a Wife should be Too pow'rful for your whole Philosophy, And at once conquer all those musty Rules, Deriv'd from Heathen Books, and Christian Schools! Do all your Vertues vanish, when I speak? Are you unarm'd, when I my Silence break? Have you no Patience, when your Wife is near? Does Wisdom fly the Field, when I appear? Can a weak Woman's verbal Thunder storm A Mind no other Evils can allarm, That uncontroul'd enjoys a happy State, And scorns to flinch beneath the Frowns of Fate? No, no, your Resolutions are too strong To yield to the Assaults of Woman's Tongue; Your Patience is impregnable, and fears No Foe, that only can alarm your Ears; Or else, like Fools, buoy'd up by mere Surmise, You've, in a grave Philosopher's Disguise, Slept o'er your Books, and only dreamt you're wise. Philosopher. Wisdom, the Mistress of the Soul, we find Is the dear Darling of the studious Mind, Deriv'd of Heav'n, by Contemplation rais'd In human Thought, by all belov'd and prais'd. By Pains and Study we must win the Prize, Grace and right Thinking only makes us wise; By one our Reason does the stronger grow, By 'tother Gift we practise what we know. But who, that in the Marriage-snare is caught, Can raise his Soul upon the Wings of Thought? Who claim a Place among the wiser Rank, That once has out of that Church-Bucket drank? What Mortal, toss'd in that tempestuous Sea, Enjoys the Sweets of Peace and Harmony? Or who in Wisdom's Search delight his Soul, That daily hears such nuptial Thunder rowl? No, no, the matrimonial Noose, my Dear, Was ne'er design'd for a Philosopher; For tho' the Wise, by Strength of Mind, withstand The common Strokes of Fortune's heavy Hand, Yet Reason's mighty Force, tho' ne'er so strong, Join'd with habitual Vertue practis'd long, Cannot forbear to tremble at a clam'rous Tongue. So the bold true-bred Mastiff walks in State, And peaceably secures his Master's Gate; Bears the rude Snarls of little Curs with Scorn, But hates the Clangor of the Gelder's Horn; At ev'ry hideous Note he howls and yelps, And shews as much Impatience as the lesser Whelps. No marry'd Slave, that's chain'd within the Noise Of a loud Tongue, and a tremendous Voice, Can then be wise but must, like other Fools, Start when he's teas'd, and flinch from Reason's Rules; For sure no other Discord can out-do The spiteful Tongue of a vexatious Shrew, Within whose Sound no Thought can be employ'd, No Patience exercis'd, no Peace enjoy'd; For where ill-natur'd Passion vents its Spleen, The Light'ning that the Touch-hole Ear takes in, Fires all, and blows up Vertue's Magazine. No more, my Dear, must I pretend to be, By Wisdom, happy in my self or thee; I'm marry'd now, and destin'd to a State That makes Men Fools by hearing Women prate. Philosophy, I find, stands wisely off, And scorns to dwell beneath a nuptial Roof; Walks gravely with her solemn Sister Peace In Cloisters, Shades, and Universities; Hugs the soft Angel in her vertuous Breast; Courts no Companion, but the Queen of Rest; Shews, by her Aspect, that her Mind is glad, And smiles to see the giddy World so mad. No more shall I her happy Fav'rite be; Now marry'd, with Contempt she looks on me; Discards her Lover, that has broke her Rules, And ranks me now among the wedded Fools. O! that I thus should incommode my Life, And change so sweet a Mistress, for a Wife! Give up the Pleasures of her dear Embrace, For a loud Tongue, the worst of female Race, In whose perpetual Motion Nothing's found, But barren Nonsense, and provoking Sound. This 'tis for Man, in his declining Years, To quit a studious Life, for Marriage-Cares, So Fools and Children, by Example led, Will into miry Slows and Ditches wade, Thus quit firm Ground, where they were dry and safe, That Standers by may at their Folly laugh. Wife. I must confess you're fitter to be ty'd To your old Books, than to a youthful Bride; Hard Study, for so grave and wise a Head, Is more delightful, than a Marriage-Bed. Wisdom, perhaps, your frozen Veins may heat, And make you younger in your own Conceit; Drive back old Time for twenty Years, or more, And make you think you're thirty at threescore; Perswade you to believe you could sustain, Without the least Offence, the greatest Pain, And, with unshaken Resolution, feel The Force of scorching Flames, or pointed Steel; Make Gout or Stone sit easy on your Mind, And in the worst of Fits, no Torture find. All these, without Experience, may agree With the dull Systems of Philosophy; But when you come to practise what you preach, The hardy Cynick's but a cow'rdly Wretch, No more, by Learning, from Impatience freed, Than the dull rural Clown that ne're could read. So Atheists to their Lusts and Passions given, Who, in their Health, deny the Pow'r of Heaven, When seiz'd with Sickness, Mercy they implore, And dread those Flames they ridicul'd before. Therefore the nuptial Sheets have made you wise, And shew'd your fancy'd Strength, but mere Surmise; For now involv'd in Marriage-Cares, you see The Weakness of your dull Philosophy, And that your harsh, impracticable Rules Are but the study'd Errors of the Schools, That make not Men more wise, but greater Fools. Mad Men, we find, will, in their frantick Fits, Delight themselves in very odd Conceits; Fancy they're seated on a silver Throne, And that they're wealthy Emp'rors of the Moon; But as dim Reason the Ascendance gains, Their bright Dominions vanish from their Brains: Then, tho' they find their lucid Empire fled, And know 'twas only seated in the Head, Yet they oft fall into a worse Extream Of Madness, 'cause they've lost the happy Dream. But when some teasing Station lets you see You're not what you believ'd your selves to be, You then, when undeceiv'd, grow mad indeed, To find those Whims, in studious Fancy bred, Give Ground when they should stand you most in Stead. Philosopher. I own I'm craz'd with your eternal Tease, Turn'd mad Man, Fool, or any Thing you please; Unlearn'd, unpolish'd, thoughtless, apish, wild, Fit only to be tutor'd like a Child; A walking-Mate to pleasure Woman's Pride, A Dog, an Ass, or any thing beside; A Rogue, a Rascal, by my Stars misled To the dark Drudg'ry of a nuptial Bed; Doom'd to get squaling Brats, that they may be As bad a Torment to my Ears, as thee; A doating Ideot, fetter'd and undone; A Staff for my dear Wife to lean upon; A Cloak for female Vice, a foolish Sot, Perhaps, to father what I ne'er begot. Prithee, dear Help-mate, give me mad Man's Law, A Chain, dark Room, a Porridge-Bowl, and Straw; These, to a peaceful Mind, more easy prove, Than all the bitter Joys of noisy Love, Whose short-liv'd Pleasures but for Moments last, And always are repented soon as past. Who then, enamour'd with a studious Life, Would change a peaceful State, for noisy Strife, And sacrifice his Freedom to a jarring Wife? Wife. Since Men of Learning, Gravity, and Years, Despise the Joys of Marriage, for its Cares, And vent their Spleen against the female Race, Because they're past the Sweets of their Embrace, Well may the blooming Bride, brisk, young, and kind, Possess'd of Beauty, and to Love inclin'd; Of am'rous Warmth, and youthful Pleasures full, Wedded to peevish Age, morose and dull, Despise the wrinkl'd Brow, and feeble Veins Of him, whose Worth consists alone in Brains. What signifies her soft enticing Charms, Doom'd to be only hugg'd by Icy Arms, Whose cold Embraces ineffectual prove, And rather chill, than warm a Bride with Love? Thus the old Fumbler labours, but in vain, Does therefore what he cannot please, disdain; Grows angry that his Years have made him chaste, And rails at Joys he wants the Pow'r to taste; Yet draws fresh Succour from her Charms each Day, And basely lives upon his Wife's Decay. So the old Eldern does its Life preserve, By neighb'ring Plants she sucks from, till they starve; And the young Oak, which might an Age survive, Begirt with Ivy, never long can thrive. Therefore, since I, whilst blooming, bear the Tease Of all your fumbling grave Infirmities; Bed with such frozen Limbs, whose wither'd Hide, Stuff'd full of Bones, benumb and gaul my Side, Sure the Example of a Wife so young, Might teach you how to bear a Woman's Tongue; For no fair Shrew, to a grave Fumbler ty'd, Can torture Age with all her noisy Pride, More than an old Philosopher a youthful Bride. Philosopher. Grey Hairs to female Youth may prove a Curse; But Woman's Tongue to Man is ten times worse. The older he, the quieter he proves; The older she, the more her Clapper moves; And the more Rest at Night the Husband takes, By Day the more provoking Noise she makes. So perverse Rebels always love to tease That King the most, that's most inclin'd to Ease. Who then can rule, without incessant Strife, A factious Kingdom, or a scolding Wife? Both labour to usurp the Pow'r supream, One hoping to enslave the Diadem, The other to subdue her marry'd Fool, That the proud Scold the nuptial Throne may rule. But curs'd is that poor Nation, ill it thrives, By Faction govern'd; and those Husbands Lives But wretched, who are triumph'd o'er by Wives. Moral Reflexions on the foregoing Dialogue. [He that has led a cloister'd Life] He that has led a cloister'd Life, And has been long to Study bent, If, in his Age, he takes a Wife That's pert and young, will soon repent. For Youth can never well agree With an old Husband, grave and grey; Nor Age a fit Companion be, For a young Wife, that's brisk and gay. Content is not preserv'd alone By Wisdom, in a marry'd State; There's something else that must be done, Or she that has a Tongue, will prate. 'Tis dang'rous for a studious Mind, Secluded long from Worldly Care, To, in his graver Years, be join'd In Marriage to the Young and Fair: For tho' his Wife should chance to prove Obedient, silent, kind and chaste, Yet all the Joys he finds in Love, Can't countervail his Pleasures past, For Ease and Freedom to the Breast, That's to a studious Life inclin'd, Affords the Soul that peaceful Rest, Which few in Wedlock ever find. DIALOGUE XVIII. Between Aminadab, a Quaker, and his Wife Rachel, concerning primitive Purity, and the sinful Abominations of the present Age. Aminadab. Ah! Rachel, had we liv'd in holy Times, When Man was just, and conscious of his Crimes, Before the wicked Seeds of Strife were sown, And when the Saints in Peace enjoy'd their own: Sate in full Plenty each beneath his Vine, And drank the Fruits thereof, now called Wine; Before the Sons of Baal were Idols made, And Man was into Satan's Yoke betray'd; Ere the proud fleshly Arm us'd Swords or Guns, To set up Pagan Altars, called Thrones. That sinful Tyrants, whom the Righteous scorn, Above their Neighbours might exalt their Horn; Like Dagon, that foul Idol, be ador'd, And Worship claim, due only to the L?d; Lay heavy Burthens on the holy Saints, And fill the World with Quarrels and Complaints. I say, had we been in the Flesh before These wicked Offsprings of the scarlet Whore Had overspread the Earth, we then had been More glad in Spirit, and more free from Sin; For since that Idol Mammon is become Of late the heath'nish God of Christendom, And we the Saints, with shameful Eyes, behold God's Grace profan'd upon ungodly Gold, To please and flatter those unrighteous Things, Call'd, by the Wicked, Emperors and Kings; From such Abominations, we may fear The Time of Desolation draweth near, When Clouds of sad Perdition shall arise, Cover the Earth, and darken all the Skies. Rachel. In those good Times, when Sarah gave the Name Of Lord to her beloved Abraham, The holy Sisters knew no Sinful Pride, But did their Shame with decent Rayment hide; Cover'd their Nakedness all oe'r, for fear, In their soft Skins, Temptation might appear: No lofty Turrets wore upon their Heads, Or yet defil'd their naked Necks with Beads; Expos'd no heaving Breasts to publick View, But kept all close, as Woman ought to do. Such Sights should even from a Spouse be hid, And only should be felt in Time of Need, When both the Flesh and Spirit whisp'ring cry, Remember to increase and multiply. But in these sinful Days, alas! we see The shameful Daughters of iniquity, Expose the Snares of Satan, to invite The Man of Sin to take his full Delight; Shew what white Necks, and panting Breasts they've got, That swell like Dumplins boiling o'er the Pot; Like painted Jezabels, go proudly drest, In all the sumptuous Trappings of the Beast, Spot their enticing Faces o'er with black, As thick as Currants in a Wood-Street Cake; Powder their wanton Locks, and with their Eyes, A thousand strange bewitching Looks devise, To tempt unwary Man to woe, and do The Deeds of Darkness, which, when past, they rue; And full of Horror, and of Shame, remove From off the tumbl'd Bed of sinful Love. So the first Man, as the dead Letter says, Entic'd by Woman in his early Days, Tasted the Fruit of Knowledge with his Bride, And did, some say, I know not what beside; But when they eat in Sorrow, did they find, The luscious Fruit that pleas'd their longing Mind, Had left a nauseous bitter Tang behind. Since Woman still retains a wicked Spice Of the old Serpent's treacherous Advice, And, in her wanton Geer, must shew her Pride, With her gold Bauble dangling at her Side, Torment her Ears, that Pendants there may shine, And hang like Rings upon the Snouts of Swine. Since such ungodly Pride has taken Place In Sion's Daughters, in the Room of Grace, And they despise the Spirit, and the Light, To follow Satan in the Paths of Night, Well may the Kingdoms of the Wicked feel The Wrath and Violence of the pointed Steel, And bear the Strokes of the afflicting Sword, As Oxen yoak'd are driven by the Goard; For lo! the holy Place with Pride is fill'd, And Sion's Sons to Satan's Whispers yield: Her wanton Daughters too profane her Streets, Where vile Temptation with Temptation meets. The Man of Sin, in his unbridl'd Lust, Crys, Hark thee me, my Dear, I vow I must; The Jezabel looks round, then makes a Halt, Crys, Give me half a Crown, and then thou shal't. Thus in the Face of Day, away they move, To satisfy their base unlawful Love; Walk to some House of Drunkenness, and there With their dark Deeds defile some Tavern-Chair. O! who can such Abominations see, And not rebuke the vile Iniquity? How oft do I, as in the Streets I tread, Hear with sad Ears such wicked Bargains made! Blush for their Shame, and tremble as I walk, At their loose Carriage, and their wanton Talk! Which do, alas! my righteous Spirit vex, To see the sinful Weakness of my Sex; O'ercomes the Light that should my Safeguard be, And makes me think, Aminidab, of thee? So he or she that has a naughty Eye, Teach those they squint upon, to look awry. Aminidab. Abomination cocks its sinful Tail, And Whoredom does in Sion's Gates prevail: The Beast with many Heads, I fear, transplants His Horns upon the Foreheads of the Saints: Satan, of old, remains among us still, And darkens, with his Wings, the holy Hill. Beware, O! Rachel, fly the Man of Sin, Defy his Pow'r, and mind the Light within; Look not upon his Face by Night or Day, But turn thy righteous Eyes another Way. He's eas'ly known, by his enticing Dress, From us, that are the sober Sons of Grace: His Head he thatches with adult'rous Hair, And down his Back a frizzl'd Main does wear, That the proud Imp's as monstrous to behold, As a huge Hedge-hog in his Bristles roll'd. His rumpl'd Cap he hugs beneath his Arm, As if design'd to keep a Bird's-Nest warm; As School-Boys, when they rob the Wren, take Care To keep their callow Nestlings from the Air, A Sword of Steel hangs girted to his Side, Which bangs against his Calves at ev'ry Stride; And thus he struts and congees, to ensnare Those weaker Vessels, which he calls the Fair, That from the Light, they may in Darkness rove, And tumble on the Bed of shameful Love. I say, beware; for he's a Fiend of Hell, That tempts the Saint to be a Jezabel; Leads her to falsify her righteous Steps, And go the very Way the Serpent creeps. O! Rachel, Rachel, listen to my Word; Remember, that I am thy earthly Lord; Keep close thy Knees, shut out the Man of Sin, And guard thy Wicket by the Light within. Let no Temptation work upon thy Thought, Or make thee what the Reprobate call naught. For 'twould my righteous Spirit much displease, To bear the Sprouts of thy Iniquities; Provoke my Wrath, to feel my aching Head With vile Abominations overspread, Call'd, by the Wicked, Horns; those shameful Marks Of Man's neglect, and Woman's sinful Works; Such that of old were brandish'd on the Brows Of the huge Beast, that from the Pit arose; A burning Scandal to the peaceful Saints, Whose Foreheads need no Weapons of Defence. I, therefore, Rachel, say again, take Heed, And raise not to thy Spouse the Serpent's Seed; Satan's a subtile Tempter, and, 'tis thought, Seduc'd the first weak Woman to be naught; Has many Ways to draw thee from the Light, Into the sinful Paths of deadly Night, Where wicked Harlots, with a gentle Shove, Fall backwards in a Trance of woeful Love, There struggling lie, and twinkle with their Eyes, 'Till he that push'd 'em down, will let 'em rise. O! Rachel, these Abominations fly, The righteous Wife should such Attacks defy; For when entic'd, if she but once gives Way, She's lost, and cannot, if she would, say nay; If once the Spirit's check'd, the Flesh is frail, And Darkness o'er the Light will soon prevail. When lustful Nature in the Heart takes Place, The best of Saints may sin, in spite of Grace, And, quite forgetful of their holy State, Trace the dark Footsteps of the Reprobate. Rachel. Thou hast no Cause, Aminidab, to be Thus troubl'd with the Thorns of Jealousy. I fear the forked Evil has possest The inward Tabernacle of thy Breast, And makes thee think, without a Reason why, That I've forsook the Light, and trod awry: But I, alas! can solemnly affirm I never did thee Wrong, or meant thee Harm; But ever since our Hands were join'd, have been True as a Lanthorn to the Light within, Which, as at Night its handed thro' the Streets, Displays its Lustre to each Eye it meets; So do I hope, when I'm abroad with thee, Our Friends my shining Innocence may see, And, thro' my outward Modesty, descry I've too much Light within, to tread awry. Let no ill Thoughts thy righteous Spirit tease, For groundless Jealousy's a bad Disease; And if it once be harbour'd in thy Breast, Will raise thee Horns, altho' thy Wife be chaste. Aminidab. O! Rachel, mention not those odious Sprouts; The very Name begets tormenting Doubts So harsh a Sound, from out a Woman's Mouth. Reflects upon a Spouse that's past his Youth; My righteous Spirit fills with restless Fears, And worse than Pop'ry, terrifies my Ears; Provokes my Hand to scratch my itching Brow, And makes me look dismay'd, I know not how. So he that walks into a Country Hall, And sees a Buck's-head nail'd against the Wall, May grow possest of some unlucky Whim, And fancy that the Antlers point at him: Just as the Sight, so likewise may the Name Of Horns, a Husband's Jealousy inflame. As frightful Tales do our Attention draw, And make us dream of Things we never saw, So Horns, when talk'd on, may confound our Wits, And make us Cuckolds in our own Conceits. Let the High-Church-men wear such forked Plants; They ought not to be nam'd among the Saints. Such persecuting Weapons should be wore Only by those who love the scarlet Whore, That by their sprouting Heads, they may be known To be the Bucks and Bulls of Babylon; Those wicked Monsters, who were wont to gore And tease the poor Elect, in Times of Yore, And made us cry aloud, thro' all the Land, The Times of Persecution are at Hand: But William stretched forth his mighty Arm, And timely sav'd us from the threat'ning Harm; Made Pop'ry fly, like Chaff before the Wind, And rooted up the Tares it left behind. O! what a holy righteous Man was he, To save the Land from vile Idolatry! O! that he had but kill'd that Dragon Sin, And conquer'd Whoredom, when his Hand was in, Adult'ry then he'ad banish'd from our Shore, And we had heard of Cuckoldom no more Rachel. Prithee, Aminidab, make no Complaints, 'Less some were wicked, there would be no Saints; And should not High-Church Brows with Antlers sprout, 'Twould be no Comfort then to be without. The Wicked should be known by Marks uncouth Let them be horn'd, I'll keep thy Forehead smooth: The Reprobate's the Foil, the Saint the Gem; 'Tis by their Sins that we the brighter seem. Were they to grow as good as us, I say, We doubtless should become as bad as they; Distinction then would be entirely lost, And we no more our Godliness could boast. Moral Reflexions on the foregoing Dialogue. [Aminidab, with sober Face] Aminidab, with sober Face, On Rachel's Vertue may rely; But Rachel knows, in spite of Grace, That a She-Saint may tread awry. The Godly may misplace their Love, Altho' they do to Meetings go; And she that is a Saint above, May be a Reprobate below. True Vertue goes not always drest In querpo Hood, and Coif precise; The airy Dame may be as chaste, As she that walks with down-look'd Eyes. Women of all Religions wed, That they the nuptial Game may play; All Mouths, says Proverb, must be fed, And we now what will eat no Hay. Therefore the Sinner, and the Saint, Are often in the self-same Boat; And Rachel, that can sigh and cant, May be as well as Madam, naught. But Jealousy's a foolish Fear, 'Tis groundless, if a Wife be chaste; And if she'as taken in her Ear A Stone, it can't be help'd, when past. DIALOGUE XIX. Between a Low-Church Husband, and his High-Church Wife, concerning the Times. Wife. Prithee, my Dear, what mean these Feuds, These Wranglings, and Disquietudes? Go where one will, such Heats arise, Such spiteful Animosities, As if some Lunacy was grown The new Distemper of the Town. The very People that I meet, Look wild, and murmur in the Street; Disguise their Aspects with Grimaces, And shew strange Passions in their Faces: Some bite their Lips, some rowl their Eyes, And stare, as in a deep Surprize; Whilst others gently pass along, And to themselves imploy their Tongue; By smiling, shew their Brains diseas'd, Like thoughtful mad Men, when they're pleas'd. Pray tell me what's the sudden Cause, That Men thus mutter, stare, and pause, And shew as many various Fits Of Frenzy, as they pass the Streets, As if the World, to Mischief bent, Were all turn'd mad Men by Consent? Husband. It is no Wonder, that the Town Should be so hot and fev'rish grown, Since such Malignants are allow'd To poyson and inflame the Croud, And, by their Preaching and their Pray'rs, Halloo the Kingdom by the Ears; But I'll engage their Mouths will soon Be stopt, or forc'd to change their Tune, There's Rods in Soak, you'll quickly see, To whisk 'em whask 'em o'er my Knee. Wife. I'm glad with all my Heart, to hear it; I'd have no canting by the Spirit. I would have all the Knaves in Town, That prate in Corners up and down, And impudently call their teaching Seditious Nonsense, Gospel preaching, And, by th'Abuse of Toleration, For their own Ends debauch the Nation, And lead the giddy Fools astray, That pious Knaves may win the Day. I say, I would have all that cover Their Rogu'ries with Religion over, And, by their holy Frauds and Cheats, Put all the Land beside their Wits, Whipp'd, banish'd, any Thing to please ye, In case 'twould make the Kingdom easy; For 'tis a Shame the Land should be One wild unhallow'd Nursery Of loose Opinions, ne'er content With any Form of Government, But favour'd, will, in Time, disperse Confusion thro' the Universe. Husband. What is't you're talking of, my Dear? The Church has made you mad, I fear. You're poyson'd with the Popish Notion Of Fire and Faggot, Persecution, And would have none for Christians pass, But those that come to High-Church Mass. Had you but Pow'r, you'd be, I find, To all Dissenters wond'rous kind; But 'tis not they, I'd have you know, That do the Coals of Discord blow. We're patient, peaceable, and quiet, Not giv'n to Railing, or to Riot, But preach without reviling any, And pay our taxes to a Penny; Ne'er groan or mutter, tho' they're great, But shew Obedience to the State. 'Tis your High-Church, that sows Dissention; It is not us that seek Contention, But your Paul's Preachers that alarm The Land, and make the People warm; And, not those Teachers, who, in Holes, As you object, instruct poor Souls, And condescend to lowly preach The Gospel to the meanest Wretch. No, no, such Guides will never wrong us, By raising Storms and Feuds among us: They're Men of Conscience, and of Peace, That heal our Animosities, And pour into our Wounds such Balsam, That is divinely good and wholsome. Your high-flown Priests, you must allow, Are those that make the Mischief now; Men full of Envy, Pride, and Passion, Without one Grain of Moderation, Who fain would have the Church to fear Those Dangers that were never near, And, like themselves, be much offended At Hardships, which were ne'er intended. Such are the Firebrands, that inflame The Land, and vex the Royal Dame; The roaring Lyons of the Age, Whose clam'rous Tongues worse Ills presage, And seek Occasion to oppress, And persecute the Lambs of Grace. Wife. Excuse me, Husband; for, I vow, I understood you not, till now. I thought, at first, you meant those Dunces, Who, without Learning, make their Bounces Of their exceeding Grace and Knowledge, Obtain'd in Shop, instead of College; Grown wise without the Help of Books, And holy only in their Looks: Some Weavers, others Taylors bred, And some to Mustard, Soap and Thread, Who practis'd Preaching in their Looms, Or first held forth to Mops and Brooms; And so, in Time, advanc'd their dull Pates, From Shops and Stalls, to Ally-Pulpits, Where, betwixt Impudence and Folly, They reproach all that's good and holy; Blaspheme the Church with scoffing Lies, Her Worship and her Pray'rs despise, And, with a grave dull Face of Brass, Make Nonsense for Religion pass, And, with pretended Grace, supply The Want of Wit and Honesty. At first I was in Hopes you'd meant Such crafty Knaves, to Mischief bent, And that you were exposing these Dark Enemies to human Peace, Who labour to promote Seditions, And widen all our Home-Divisions: But I am quite deceiv'd, I find, For these are Preachers to your Mind, And the foul Game they long have play'd, Must now at the Church-door be laid, And her best Sons unjustly forc'd To suffer Hardships from the worst; But these grave Dunces, who delude The giddy, poor, unthinking Croud, And strew their Poysons up and down In Nooks and Corners of the Town, Are perfect Saints, who cant in Fashion, And Nonsense preach by Inspiration. These may revile, rave, rail, blaspheme The holy Text, or Pow'r supream; But in an Age so blest as this, Can neither say or do amiss. So an imprudent, partial Mother, Will whip one Child, but spare another, That's much more faulty than his Brother. Husband. I find, my Dear, you can't refrain Your old, high-flying, angry Strain; Our holy Guides you must bespatter, Tho' you know nothing of the Matter. But 'tis no Wonder, that you're taught To set such Gospel-Saints at naught, And to reproach those holy Men, Who do the Scripture-Truths explain, Since you're become so fond a Lover Of high-Church Paul's, and Mary's Over, Where all your Priests, that are excelling In the great Gift of noisy Railing, Chuse to exert their pregnant Parts, And shew the Rancour of their Hearts. But where's your High-Church Champion now, That roar'd so loud some Time ago, And pour'd the Viols of his Wrath On Brethren that had broke their Troth? What has his over-heated Brains Now got to recompence his Pains? Had he not better check'd his Passion, Like a mild Son of Moderation, And temporiz'd his zealous Heat, Like the good Man in Coleman-street? These are not Times for the black Brood Of high-flown Cocks to crow so loud; Men must not strain their Elocution, 'Gainst Principles of Revolution; That's spurning at our Constitution. Things are not canvas'd now, we see, As in the Days of Popery; For, by our Pains and Pray'rs we've brought 'em To stand upright on a new Bottom, And there we'll keep 'em, till we gain The Point we're lab'ring to obtain. When the old Game we once begin, We never hang an Arse therein; For he that hopes to win the Course, Must ne'er at half Way stop his Horse, But briskly whip and spur the Steed, That nothing may retard his speed. Wife. I own your Party has begun An ugly Race, but 'tis not won. 'Tis true, the Odds are on your Side; You're first it cannot be deny'd; Yet ere the violent Course be run, Your crafty Rider may be thrown. The Jade may stumble, flinch, or falter; Small Accidents the Bets will alter; And then it may be two to one Of our Side, ere the Race be done. Rump has been thrown, you must allow, When safer seated than 'tis now, Because it ne'er could long maintain The Saddle, or command the Rein. By headstrong Pushes, and by Art, The Rump sometimes has got the Start, But always ended in a Fart, New Models has it often made, And many strange Foundations laid; But still, whatever was erected Thereon, could ne'er be long protected. So Boys, in Architect unskill'd, With Cards will Paper-Fabricks build; But with the next chance Puff that's blown, The lofty Babel tumbles down. Husband. But those strong Bull-warks we have made Against the Mischiefs that we dread, Are founded now upon the Pow'r Of Law, to make 'em more secure. No Pop'ry now can scale the Walls, Or high flown Sermons, at St. P?'s, Beat down those Barriers we have rais'd 'Gainst Persecution, God be prais'd. These are the Days of Moderation; No Dog-Star Zeal is now in Fashion. Men must not prop their sinking Faith, By Dint of Bell'wing, in their Wrath. The Pulpit is no Sanctuary For Gown men, when their Tongues miscarry. They're taught to understand of late, The Diff'rence 'twixt the Church and State, And that Religion must not mix, In pious Times, with Politicks; Or Teachers undertake to tell What's right or wrong, or ill or well, But, without cavilling, submit To what their Rulers think most fit, And only preach up, thro' the Nation, Down right Repentance and Salvation. Wife. You cant extreamly well, I find, Now all goes smoothly to your Mind; But when the Tide is turn'd, I hope, You'll preach the same good Doctrine up; For Proverb says, the self-same Sause Serves both the Gander and the Goose; So the like Measure that you give, Ere long, perhaps, you may receive. Then, if you murmur at the Matter, Take Care your Stripes are not the greater; For be assur'd, when that Time comes, You'll find the C? has Whipping-Toms, Who will not, in their Turns, forget The sharp Examples you have set, But will repay, to make Scores even, The same kind Usage you have given. So when two Drunkards, o'er the Pot, Fool out about they know not what, He that gets uppermost, first mauls The Foe that underneath him falls, Who saves his Breath, 'till t'other's spent, Then rising pays the Blows he lent, And bangs him to his Heart's Content. 'Tis also dangerous in War, T'insult an Enemy too far; For cruel Usage makes a Foe, When beaten, so revengeful grow, That rally'ng, fearless to be kill'd, He wins the Day, and keeps the Field. It is not therefore good to be Too prodigal of Victory, Lest all the Triumphs that you boast, Are at one fatal Onset lost. Husband. Superior Pow'r may stop our Way, And sometimes keep us at a Bay; But I presume, we lose not oft By Folly, what we gain by Craft. I fancy we shall be too bold And cunning now, to quit our Hold. The Game is on our Side secure; We've dealt it right, and play'd it sure. Our Honours your small Trumps command; We've all the Court-Cards in our Hand. You've nothing in your Pow'r, to gain Your Ends, above a single Ten. How therefore can your Side suppose, That you can win, or we can lose. Wife. You can't but own, amidst your Pride, We've Truth and Justice on our Side; And they, altho' sometimes o'ercast, Ne'er fail to shine aloft at last. The Sun, when darken'd by a Storm, Seems, when its o'er, more bright and warm. The Hopes, that chear our drooping Hearts, Depend not upon human Arts, But on the Pow'r, and promis'd Love Of him that dwells and rules above. We fear not all your crafty Tricks, Your Knav'ries, and your Politicks; Kind Providence still countermines, And baffles all your dark Designs; Makes your corrupt Beginnings tend To dire Confusion in the End, That the vile Courses which you run Ne'er prosper, they're so ill begun, By Heaven never are befriended, But always to your Shame are ended. Husband. Buoy up your selves with vain Conceits, Like mad Folks, who have lost their Wits; Fancy new Paul's in Time will rise, 'Till its gilt Cross shall touch the Skies; That the High-Church will pow'rful grow, And once more persecute the Low; That Jacobites will climb again, And curb the Whigs, the Lord knows when. So the poor Bedlamite may dream, That his Straw Cap's a Diadem, And that he's Emp'ror of the Moon, Or some strange, giddy World unknown; Yet, tho' his Brains are thus possest, He's but a Lunatick at best, And all his Whimsies but a Jest. So you, that fancy you shall see The Low-Church with its Name agree, Or that the High shall come in Play, And o'er the Whigs usurp the Sway, By th'Strength of wild Imagination, Thus give your Fancy Titillation. But we your Hopes shall disappoint, Put all your Measures out of Joint, And still maintain, in spite of Fate, The Ground we've wisely gain'd of late. We've drawn you, by our Cunning, now Into so deep a Bog or Slow, Where struggling makes you lower sink; The more you stir, the more you stink, You're over Boots as well as Shoes, And none can help you out, but us; But, when we take you by the Sleeve, To pull you out, as you believe, We only craftily take Care To stick you in the faster there. Tis common Safety, if we see A rival Foe in Jeopardy, To offer Aid, and Friendship feign, That we may unsuspected gain Convenient Time to be his Bane. Wife. Your wicked Works your Craft display; Experience shews it ev'ry Day. You need not boastingly declare What subtile Snakes your Party are You've giv'n us many a fatal Proof, That has convinc'd us full enough. But after all your Slights and Tricks, And old nefarious Politicks, By Honesty we've oft out-done ye, And Justice will at last out-run ye. You only hope to gain your Ends By human Means, Strength, Wealth, and Friends, And all the Scruples that you hold, Arise from the Desire of Gold. From thence your pious Zeal ascends, And thither your Religion tends: Av'rice alone's the Whip and Spur, That jirks you on to make this Stir; And Conscience always the Pretence, That sanctifies each black Offence. So no religious Harlot cares To sin, before she'as said her Pray'rs; Nor Ruffians e'er, without a Mask, Perform a base or bloody Task. But we use no such Arts, to paint A Dev'l incarnate, like a Saint. Nor do we look so sanctify'd, As you, amidst your holy Pride, Because we have no Deceit to hide; No Frauds to put a pious Face on; No ill Designs to cast a Gloss on. We ne'er 'twixt two Opinions halt, Then make a Vertue of the Fault, And to delude a vitious Nation, Call dull Indiff'rence, Moderation. We no such quaint Disguises use; But what we are, our Practice shews. We look not, like a treach'rous Brother, One Way, yet haul and pull another. We go not to the Church to hurt her, Perhaps commune there once a Quarter, Yet vote for those that would subvert her. Nor are we such, that vow we love her, Attend her Worship, and approve her, Yet, wanting Courage to befriend her, Condemn those Guides that do defend her. We are no Hypocrites, in short, That make Religion but their Sport, And use her as a Stalking-Horse, To gain their Ends, and fill their Purse. We're stedfast in our Faith, you find, And waver not with ev'ry Wind; Use no prevaricating Arts, But wear Religion in our Hearts, And not let all our Grace be seen Without, and harbour none within. So merry Ladies, wh are Lovers Of wanton Books, bespeak the Covers Most grave, according to the Mode Of solemn Books, divinely good, That the outside may cheat the Eye, And Bawdy unsuspected lie, Pil'd up with Sabbath-Preparations, And godly Books on all Occasions. Husband. Rail on at us, that are precise, And call our Sanctity Disguise. A sober Look's a better Grace, I'm certain, than a brazen Face. You'd have us rattle, swear, and roar, Like a Sea-Calf, just come on Shore; And gaze at ev'ry Woman's Charms, Like Campaign Beau, bred up to Arms, That all Men, in our Looks, might see A loose, regardless Vanity: Then truly I, perhaps, might pass For a gay Fool, or blust'ring Ass, And have the Honour to be thought Some swagg'ring High Church God knows what. But in this Age of Reformation, When down-cast Looks, thro' all the Nation, Are now become the only Fashion, Who'd from his present Int'rest fly; By holding up his Head too high? Or vex his Neighbours, by his proud Dissenting from the common Mode? No, no, I'll to the Times conform, On H?dly's Side be stiff and warm; Make Lords and Judges of the Rabble, And for elective Freedom squabble; Derive all Power from the People; Revile the Church, that wears a Steeple; Like an old vex'd Fanatick, rail Against Sa?l, Tooth and Nail, And want of true Reproach, supply With false malicious Calumny; For naked Truth won't please our Nation Without a little Illustration; Nor will the down-right Fact suffice, Unless adorn'd with Shams and Lies, From hence we're ever in the Right, And conquer always when we fight; For we the Saints can, by a Knack, Turn Black to White, or White to Black. Wife. I find, my Dear, you're very free T'acquaint me with your Policy. You have acknowledg'd very plain, Your Godliness is down-right Gain, And that you humour and collogue That Worship which is most in Vogue, And will be always true and hearty To the most rich and pow'rful Party; Shift any Way to save your Bacon, And ne'er be to your Hurt mistaken. So Soldiers face about, to save Themselves in Battel from the Grave; And Vessels tack this Way, or t'other, To pleasure him that guides the Rudder, Why therefore should not Men at Land Comply with what they can't withstand; And, like their Betters, change their Course, As best shall suit the gaping Purse? Who would his God for nothing serve, Or stand by any Faith, to starve? I'll warr'nt you think it Time to fly That Church that totters, 'cause it's high, And plead, that 'tis no Sin to dread What you see tumbling on your Head. You've all these Arguments, t'excuse The Shiftings you for Int'rest use; And could, no doubt on't, for your Gain, Turn Papist or Mahometan; And for Gold, follow Pope or Mufti, Provided you could do't with Safety. Husband. Women, 'thas always been agreed on, Should be warm Bigots in Religion: They've nothing else to do, but pray, And hear good Sermons twice a Day. They must be kept to strict Devotion, And daily arm'd with fresh Precaution; Or else they'll start from all Decorum, As Eve their Mother did before 'em. But Men by Nature are more wise; On them the Weight of Bus'ness lies: We do not want so much Instruction, From Men made holy by Induction. Our Reason, we allow, may guide us Sometimes, as well as those that ride us. 'Tis we our Families take Care for, And must regard our Int'rest therefore, And not, by bick'ring with our Masters, Ruin our selves, to save our Pastors; Who, if we'er poor, will not relieve us; Their empty Blessing's all they'll give us. What Son would, like a Fool, stand propping His Mother High-Church, when 'twas dropping, And run the Hazard of his Life, To please a poor Priest-ridden Wife? No, no, when 'tis so feeble grown, 'Tis safer far to pull it down, Than to extend a willing Hand, Against the Temper of the Land. Besides, 't has been observ'd of old, And oft for Truth by Gossips told, That Rats, who long have kept their Station In an old rotten Habitation, Will always quit the crazy Walls Some Time before the Fabrick falls. Therefore, if Rats should have the Sense, Ere a House drops, to fly from thence, What Man would have so little Reason, In a high, blust'ring, stormy Season, To stand by any tott'ring Steeple That's crack'd, and shunn'd by other People? Wife. At this unhappy Time of Day, When all have leave to go astray, It is no Wonder such a Son Should from his Christian Mother run, Who nurs'd him in her sweet Embrace, And gave him first the Means of Grace, Since Disobedience, in our Nation, Has been these twenty Years in Fashion, And Atheism, Madness, Pride, and Folly Have seiz'd, and overcome us wholly. The wealthy Son now shuts his Door Against his Parents, if they're poor; And some lewd Daughters ride in Coaches, Whilst their old Mothers beg on Crutches. Since Disobedience grows so common In wicked Man, and weaker Woman, Well may such Numbers, who, at first Were Christians made, and kindly nurst, Now slight their ancient holy Mother, T'obey the Precepts of another, Who being favour'd by the State, Is high in Pow'r, in Riches great. So Men of Av'rice often chuse A strange, deform'd, ungainly Spouse, Meagre and ugly as a Witch, Only because the Monster's rich. You may, my Dear, play fast and loose, And run from Church to Meeting-house; But to my Mother Church I'll pay My Duty humbly Day by Day; Remain her true and faithful Daughter, In Hopes of joyful Peace herea'ter. Husband. I'd have you, by all Means, continue The Faith that is establish'd in you; And, by your Talk and Practice, show That you're as high, as I am low: Then let the Times turn how they will, One must be of the right Side still, And they may save the other free, In Time of Need, from Jeopardy. Let us like two Well-Buckets prove, One downwards, t'other upwards move; Wind diff'rent Ways, yet shew no Heat, But kiss, like them, when e'er we meet. Moral Reflexions on the foregoing Dialogue. [Where Love of Gold corrupts the Heart] Where Love of Gold corrupts the Heart, No sound Religion can have Place; For Av'rice does alone pervert The Mind, and leaves no Room for Grace. Conscience is always the Pretence Why Men strange Worship do frequent, When 'tis the sordid Love of Pence, That makes them from the Church dissent. Where Mammon, and his wicked Train, In greatest Splendor do appear, They surely draw the greedy Man To pay his feign'd Devotion there. The Zeal, our ancient Fathers had, From true Religion did arise, But modern Zeal quite makes us mad, And turns old Friends to Enemies; Whets but the Malice and the Pride Of jarring Parties, who contend, That one Side may the other ride, And that their only pious End. But oh! how wicked do we grow! How blind to all true heav'nly Light, When Zealots their Religion show In only Avarice and Spite! DIALOGUE XX. Between a very talkative Madam, and her merry drunken Husband, who always us'd to sing when his Wife scolded. Wife. I wonder that you'll stay so late; This sitting up, you know, I hate. Why will you put me in a Fright, By tarry'ng from me half the Night, And make me think you've met with some Affront or Mischief, coming Home? You're sensible I ne'er can close My Eyes, or take the least Repose, If I should go to Bed without you, My Heart's so full of Fears about you. Therefore no Man, that ever knew The Love that to a Wife was due, Would serve a Woman so, but you. Husband sings. Let us fill, and let us drink, Wine will drive all Care away; If your Bus'ness bids you think, Postpone it to another Day. Why should a Man become a Slave To Wealth, to Bus'ness, or a Wife? The merry Glass is all we have To sooth the vexing Plagues of Life. Wife. Yes, yes, I know the merry Glass Is all you covet to embrace; The Sots, with whom you lead your Life, Are dearer to you than your Wife. The Room behind the Tavern-bar, Is better than your House by far; And now and then a flatt'ring Kiss That's stoll'n from Madam, or her Niece, Is more esteem'd from one less fair, Than all your lawful Pleasures are, And with a greater Gust enjoy'd Than the stale Favours of your Bride. So those, who near the Forest live, For coarser Meat will Ven'son give, Because the last has cloy'd their Taste, And makes them think the worst the best. Husband sings. A Woman's a talkative Creature, Her Tongue is perpetually moving, When vex'd, she's all over ill Nature; When pleas'd, she's too fond and too loving. A flattering Fool may decoy her, She's easily tempted to Evil; Tho' an Angel before we enjoy her, She often proves after a Devil. Wife. Who was't you ever found so easy, So forward, fond, and free to please ye? Did ever I shew such Miscarriage, Till bound to condescend by Marriage? Was I inclin'd to step aside, Ere I became your lawful Bride? Could your fine Tongue prevail with me To shew the least Immodesty, Till first oblig'd by nuptial Vows To humour a desirous Spouse; To love, to honour, and obey, And please you in an honest Way? Abroad, perhaps, you've met with those, That, if but flatter'd, would expose Their Charms, and when you think you've won Their Hearts, prove Devils when they've done. I would have all Men, who have Wives, And lead debauch'd and drunken Lives, Meet with such Ladies of the Town, That they may learn to prize their own, And know the Diff'rence 'twixt a common Prostitute, and a vertuous Woman. Who in this wicked Age is slighted, Whilst Sluts are treated and delighted. Husband sings. She that has sinn'd, would fain be thought Divinely good and chaste; All Womens failings, 'till they're caught, Lie hid beneath the Waste. The Harlot rails against her Trade, To those that do not know her, Altho' sh'as been in private made A thousand times a Whore. You say you're just; you may be so, Your Word is all I've for it; But whether you are chaste or no, My Comfort is my Claret. I value not the nuptial Tease Of Tail or Tittle-tattle; No Woman shall disturb my Ease, My Mistress is the Bottle. Wife. 'Tis evident enough, you Sot, You're wedded to the Tavern Pot; Or else you'd never spend your Life With that, much more than with your Wife; Make it your principal Delight To hug the Poyson Day and Night; Whilst I must unregarded stay At home, and sigh my Time away; Be no more valu'd than a Slave, Or the worst Houshold-Stuff you have. Can all your Kindness, heretofore So oft repeated o'er and o'er; Your courtly Vows and Protestations; Your Sighs, and your Asseverations, And all the Charms of my Embrace Be drown'd already in the Glass? Had I foreseen your Love would grow So cool, you should have pin'd 'till now, Ere I'd have foolishly comply'd To've been a Tavern-Hunter's Bride: But Wedlock's a deceitful State, Wherein Repentance comes too late; Nor can mistaken Woman see Her Fault, 'till past a Remedy. But still remember sh'has a Tongue To tell, and to revenge her Wrong; And if that Sting cannot perplex ye Enough, sh'as other Ways to vex ye. Husband sings. The best a Scold can do, Shall never much delight me; The Threats of such a Shrew Shall never vex or fright me. Her fickle wav'ring Smiles Shall ne'er have Pow'r to please me; The worst of all her Ills Shall ne'er provoke or tease me. Her Tongue, tho' as loud As the Shouts of a Croud; Her Tail, tho' as free As a Woman's can be, I no more would regard her, Abroad or at Home, Than a treacherous Jilt, or a noisy Drum; But when sober and sad, to my Bottle would fly, And her female Revenge both despise and defy. Wife. You're mighty stout, the Vine be prais'd, Now Claret has your Courage rais'd. So Cowards, when with Wine inspir'd, Will brave those Dangers that they fear'd; But when again they're sober grown, Will tremble at the Risks they've run. Your Singing shews the Tavern-Pot Has made you a most valiant Sot, That soars, now drunk, above the Dread Of publick Scorn, or forked Head, And all the shameful Ills that wait Upon a Wife's revengeful Hate. But should I from my Duty swerve, And plague you as you well deserve; In Tears set forth my sad Complaint To some young amorous Gallant; Tell how I'm slighted, disbelov'd, And what a naughty Man you've prov'd; Meet him, and junket up and down, 'Till made the common Talk o'th' Town, And you, to share the vile Disgrace, Be call'd poor Cuckold to your Face; And, as you walk the publick Street, Be pointed at by those you meet; Not with one Finger, but a Pair, To signify what Crest you bear, And, when you tax me with my Crimes, Confess I've don't a hundred times; Rave, rattle, bluster, like a Bully, And call you Cuckold, Fumbler, Cully; Frown, and deny you, when you want Those Favours I to others grant; Yet make you labour, drudge, and sweat, To keep those Brats that others get. Such Usage, I am apt to fear, Would make you change your Tune, my Dear; Cause you to knit your careless Brow, And soon turn all your Songs, which now You think so merry, and so witty, Into a dull and doleful Ditty; For, tho' a Wife's Revenge may seem A Trifle in a drunken Dream, Yet, if let loose, it may subdue A Husband more robust than you: An angry Wasp, that does but dart Her Sting, will make you feel the Smart: So small an Insect as a Flea, Has Pow'r to vex the stoutest He; Yet these inflict so small a Pain, That cannot reach the Heart or Brain; But an inrag'd, revengeful Wife, Strikes home, and punishes for Life; And still the more that you oppose, More strong and desperate she grows; And when provok'd, will prove too hard For Man, in spite of all his Guard. Husband sings. Altho' you prove worse and worse, Your Policy still shall fail; For I have Command of my Purse; As much as you have of your Tail. You may scold 'till you tire your Tongue, I never shall mind your Noise, You may whore, and be pox'd, now young, And when rotten, repent of your Joys. If you please, you may humour your Lust, But shall neither have Cloths or Coin, Unless at some other Fool's Cost; For you ne'er shall be lewd at mine. Tho' I cannot subject a Shrew, I can govern my own Estate; And whether you're false or true, I'll be easy in spite of Fate: For I'll spin out my Days With my Friend, and my Glass, And as oft as I please Have a jolly young Lass; Never mind an ill Wife, let her run to the Devil, But live as if freed from so teasing an Evil. Wife. Sing on, my Dear, my Ears can bear it; O rare Effects of costly Claret! Immortal Red secures your Mind Against all worldly Cares, I find, And makes you wisely soar above The Thoughts of Marriage, and of Love; But a Night's Rest will tame your Crown, And fetch your wand'ring Fancy down; Reduce you to a mortal State, Tho' now so God-like, and so great. One Morning's Dish of healing Tea, Will cure this drunken Lunacy; Dethrone th'imaginary King, And make you quite another thing. So those in Fevers often think They're God knows what, like Men in Drink; But Opiates, taken in due Season, Give Rest, and that restores their Reason; And then they find those wild Extreams, That puff'd 'em up, were only Dreams. Husband sings. Tho' Drinking makes us mad, Yet Scolding makes us worse; That's good, which makes us glad, What plagues us, is a Curse. Would Women silent prove, 'Twould hinder Man's Excess; The more at Home we love, Abroad we drink the less. But if Wives will be Shrews, And their Husbands amuse With impertinent Wrangle and Prattle, Then away do we fly To some Tavern that's nigh, And bemoan our selves over the Bottle. Wife. If Man to Drinking is inclin'd, A small Excuse will serve, I find. But since your Ears cannot agree With Woman's weak Loquacity, Excuse what's past, and I'll remember To bridle my unruly Member; For who, that's airy, brisk, and young, Would not restrain a nimble Tongue, Rather than lose the fruitful Joys Of a much sweeter Exercise? Moral Reflexions on the foregoing Dialogue. [Of all the Plagues that wait on Love] Of all the Plagues that wait on Love, And do our nuptial Joys impede, The Tongue does most tormenting prove, And does the greatest Mischief breed. It often unawares betrays The vitious Murmurs of the Mind, And does, by wanton Freedoms, raise Those Doubts that make a Spouse unkind. An idle Tale, a scoffing Jest, The ill-tim'd Mention of a Name, Or a kind Word or two misplac'd, Will sometimes Jealousy inflame. It highly then concerns a Bride To guard her Tongue in all she says, Since a short Sentence misapply'd, May make her wretched all her Days. Therefore since ev'ry wanton Word Endangers matrimonial Ease, The Scold must surely be abhorr'd, Whose Tongue's an everlasting Tease. Men, tho' they're headstrong and perverse, No Wife should clamour or rebel: For an ill Tongue makes bad but worse, When milder Methods might prevail. DIALOGUE XXI. Between an over-fond Husband, very desirous of Children, and his cunning Wife, who pretends often to miscarry yet is never with Child. Husband. How fares my only Dear, my Duck; What makes my lovely Jewel look So squeamish, and so pale to Day, Who us'd to be so brisk and gay? Wife. Such Qualms, my Dear, alas! are common To her that is a breeding Woman. I'm gone, you know, three Months at least; Don't I grow bigger in the Waste? Lay but your Hand upon my Side, And you may feel I'm spread more wide. Husband. I think you are improv'd, I vow; I hope 'twill come to something now. Prithee, my Dear, take special Care How you step down from Stair to Stair, Lest you should tread your Foot awry; And get a Fall or Wrench thereby. Hand nothing to or from the Shelf, For fear you should o'er-reach your self, And get a Mischief, that may spoil The Child, and all our Hopes beguile. Wife. I'll be as cautious as I can, Yet all one's Care may be in vain; For when most safe in our own Fancies, We often stumble on Mischances. It is not good to be o'er careful, Nor should you be so very fearful; For what we dread the most, some say, We meet the oft'nest in our Way, And into those Disasters run, Which we endeavour most to shun. So tim'rous Folks are apt to die Of those Diseases that they fly; And many live in Fear and Pain Of Accidents that prove their Bane. Husband. But pray consider, you've miscarry'd Already twice or thrice, since marry'd. One Cause, as you your self declare, Was lifting up an Elbow-Chair; Another Time you long'd to taste A Pasty carry'ng to a Feast, And fell extreamly ill upon it, Because so foolish not to own it; A third time frighted by a Rat; You squeak'd, and took your Bed at that. Therefore, as you have brought your Life So oft in Danger, since a Wife, And are again with Child, I vow, You should be very careful now. Always remember, I desire, That the burnt Infant dreads the Fire, And let's not lose a nuptial Heir, For want of either Cost or Care. Wife. We breeding Wives, I must confess, Are oft too careless and remiss; Forgetful of our selves, to save The Charge of what we ought to have, Because our Spouses should not think Too much of what we eat or drink; Tho' she that is in my Condition, Should never feed on coarse Provision, But should have Pheasant, Teal, and Chicken, And such like dainty Bits to pick on; Drink in the Morning, and at Dinner, Rich Wine, to cherish what's within her; And have at all times in her Closet, Ingredients for a good Sack-Posset. But I am no such costly Woman, Tho' 'tis with other Wives too common: When not with Child, and when I am, I eat and drink the very same; Hate you should think me nice or craving Of Dainties, when I may be saving; Tho' I can see in other Houses, How breeding Women use their Spouses. Husband. Thou know'st, my Dear, I've more good Nature, And think'st, I hope, I love thee better, Than to be angry or uneasy At any Cost, that may but please thee. I never yet was so unkind to Deny thee what thou hadst a Mind to; But always very freely granted Whatever you'd but say you wanted. Could'st thou eat Gold, to do thee Good, I'd feast thee with the wealthy Food. What Husband, blest with such a Wife, The Joy and Comfort of his Life, Could, in thy Circumstance, deny her The costly'st thing she could desire? Not I; but prithee drink and eat The finest Wines, and best of Meat, That the young Embrion may become A little Sampson in thy Womb; And when from thence he's midwiv'd, prove The Wonder of our nuptial Love. Wife. Your Kindness needs no farther Proof; I know, my Dear, you're fond enough. But after all, I dread this Night; Don't I look pale? I am not right. I'm full of grinding Pains, I vow, And feel my self I know not how. Lord bless me, how I stretch and yawn! I shall be worse, I fear, anon. O dear, what ails my Back, I wonder! It achs as if 'twould rend asunder. I must be forc'd, at last, I doubt, To send for Mother Bawdicut. In my Condition I may grow Worse, of a sudden, f'or ought I know. Husband. Be not so fanciful, my Dear; I hope there's no such Danger near, As to require a Midwife's Aid, Therefore chear up, be not dismaid; For strong Conceit may, by the Force Of Faucy, make your Illness worse. You've done your self some Harm, I fear, By lifting up a Stool or Chair; Or had a longing Mind, I doubt, For something you have gone without. Prithee, my Jewel, tell me truly How 'tis; to hide it, would be Folly; Don't be so bashful, but confess The Cause of your Uneasiness. Wife. I vow, my Dear, I would impart What you require, with all my Heart, But cannot guess, upon my Word, The Reason I am so untow'rd, Except one thing should be the Cause; But that's not it, I do suppose. So insignificant a Matter, Could never thus disorder Nature. But, bless me! what a Fool am I? Why should a Wife so far comply, As to perplex her Spouse, and tease His Breast with her Infirmities? Consider, Love, our Sex are weak, And in some Cases cannot speak; My Modesty will not allow My Tongue to tell my Folly now; Or else, my Dear, I would, I vow. Husband. But in a dangerous Case, like this, You should not be so very nice, Where it concerns their Health and Ease, All Wives should have their Liberties, And not, to their own Hurt, conceal The Causes that have made 'em ill. Without such Freedom, no Physician Can rightly judge of your Condition. So that if Woman may declare Her Mind to those who Doctors are, No Doubt but it becomes each Dame T'acquaint her Husband with the same; Therefore deny me not, but prithee Let me know truly how 'tis with thee. Wife. I'm sure, you'll think me very silly; Or else, my Dear, I'd tell you freely: But when you know the light Occasion Of this my strange Indisposition, You'll blame me for my Indiscretion. Husband. You know I ne'er reflect or tease ye, But always strive to make you easy. Therefore I beg you to be free, And lay aside your Modesty For once, and tell me what's the Matter; I swear I'll never blame you a'ter. Wife. I vow, my Dear, I can't forbear To blush; but if I must declare My female Weakness, and my Folly, I'll own my Error full and wholly. Yesterday Morn I chanc'd to meet A Lady's Foot-man in the Street, Carry'ng a little Basket by Of Peas so charming to the Eye, So large, so lovely, and so green, That finer sure were never seen. Just as he met me, as I'm living, I smelt an Odour so reviving, That I'd have giv'n him, as he past, The World, if mine, to've had a Taste. I turn'd and look'd, and wishing stood, Till a strange Ague chill'd my Blood; Nay, such a Mist slid o'er my Eyes, And sudden Faintness did surprize My Heart, that I was almost ready To fall, for want of walking steady; That for a Time I scarce could find My Way, I was so weak and blind. At length got Home, with much ado, But still conceal'd my Ail from you, In Hopes I should have overcome My foolish Fancy, when at Home; But really find, what-e'er's the Matter, I grow much worse, instead of better. Husband. Why did'st not watch him where he went? And to his Lady I'd have sent Three times the Value of the Peas, To've set thy longing Mind at Euse. There can be no such Woman sure, From her that's rich, to her that's poor, Who knows what 'tis to be a Mother, But would have so far serv'd another. However, will no Peas suffice, But those that so bewitch'd your Eyes? I care not if they cost a Guinea, Would they preserve the Child within ye. Wife. Alas! my Dear, it's now too late, I find my Pains grow very great. I wish it does not prove my End, For God's sake for the Midwife send. These Grindings quicker come, and stronger, I cannot thus hold out much longer. Husband. Lord bless me, Child, you make me start! I'm sorry for thee at my Heart. I'll step my self, for thy dear Sake, And then there can be no Mistake. Run, Bess, I charge you, for your Life, And call my Neighbour Dunch's Wife; And I my self will fetch old Mother Bawdicut hither, or some other. Wife. Prithee, my Dear, don't let her tarry, I'm almost sure I shall miscarry. To her self. If our fond Husbands grieve and fret For want of what they cannot get, By sham Pretences we must please 'em, Or else do what is worse, to ease 'em. Moral Reflexions on the foregoing Dialogue. [He that's uneasy with his Bride] He that's uneasy with his Bride, Because he has no Children by her, Prepares his Wife to be enjoy'd By him that has a Mind to try her. What greater Error can there be, Than for a Husband to be railing At what, for ought he knows, may be His own, and not his Spouse's Failing? The youthful Wife will not believe The Fault to her alone is owing, But fancies she might still conceive, In Case the Soil had better sowing. So that, if once she finds her Spouse Reflects her Barrenness upon her, She'll think it just to horn his Brows, In Hopes thereby to save her Honour. Or oft pretend to be with Child, Dissemble Breeding, 'till miscarry'd, Because she would not be revil'd As one unworthy to be marry'd. Therefore it is the wisest Way, For those who have no Brats about 'em, To mutually agree and say, They think they're highly blest without 'em. DIALOGUE XXII. Familiar Chat between a loving Couple, Concerning their own Happiness. Husband. O let us bless the Day, my Dear, That plac'd us in this happy Sphere, Wherein we mutually possess Such unmolested Happiness. What Man would chuse a single Life, That knew the Comforts of a Wife; Or could conceive the sweet Delights, That crown our nuptial Days and Nights? If Paradise long since profan'd, And lost by Eve, can be regain'd, A marry'd Station sure must be That State of true Felicity. Wife. Since Wedlock is so much cry'd down By Beaus and Blockheads of the Town, And so discountenanc'd of late, As if 'twas going out of Date, Now you have try'd, I'm glad to find It proves so pleasing to your Mind, And that you're willing to afford A marry'd Life so good a Word. Your kind Opinion does redound Much to my Honour, I must own; For he that's wed, and when h'as try'd, Approves the State, commends his Bride, As he that does condemn the same, Reflects severely on his Dame. Therefore, I'm proud to hear you say, You bless that kind auspicious Day, That join'd our Hands, and made your Life So truly happy in a Wife. Husband. To be so highly blest, and not To own the same, must be a Fau't. The least Returns of Gratitude, To a kind Wife so chaste and good, Is for a Husband to confess Wherein consists his Happiness, Lest she should think her Care to please, Contributes little to her Ease, And that he had no real Taste O'th' matchless Blessings he possest; And therefore was, for want of Sense, Unworthy of such Excellence. Wife. I find then, if I strive, my Dear, To make you happy, I shall hear Of all my Qualities, that prove A Blessing to your nuptial Love. I therefore hope you'll be as free, To tell me of the Faults you see, That I from thence may learn to mend Those Slips and Failings that offend; For since you have a Sense to prize That Goodness Men too oft despise, And take a Pleasure, and a Pride, To own the Merits of your Bride, It doubly binds me to improve Those Vertues that preserve your Love, And to be careful that I steer My Actions to oblige my Dear. Since Man can, for its Lustre, prize The Gem that dazzles human Eyes, And, notwithstanding 'tis his own, Yet boast the Value of the Stone, Why should not Husbands be allow'd To praise their Wives, and be as proud Of those engaging Charms they find In their kind Carriage, Face, and Mind? Husband. A Diamond, tho' it's ne'er so bright, Gives only Pleasure to the Sight; But a good Wife that's blest with Beauty, And studies to excel in Duty, Not only comforts with her Charms, And feasts her Husband's Eyes, but Arms; Is Heavens Store-house, where there lies A thousand unexpected Joys; A Fountain of Delight and Pleasure, That far exceed all other Treasure; A Jewel, whose intrinsick Worth, No Tongue is able to set forth; In whose bright Excellence her Owner May see the Goodness of the Donor, And ought to prize her, for the sake Of him that did the Image make. How then can I, that am possest, Of Beauty so divinely blest, Conceal the Happiness I find In her that is so fair and kind! No, Dearest, since my nuptial Bed By Heav'n and you's so happy made, To Heaven first my Thanks are due, And next my Gratitude to you; Both which I'll carefully repay, And ever bless my Wedding-Day. Moral Reflexions on the foregoing Dialogue. [Would Man and Wife no notice take] Would Man and Wife no notice take Of Failings which they ought to smother, And when they talk, take Care to speak With due Respect to one another; By Use they'd mutually acquire Such a kind Habit of indearing, That long would fan the nuptial Fire Of Love, which cools by frequent jarring. A vertuous and obliging Bride Deserves her Husband's Commendation, And tender Usage, on his Side, Merits the like Retaliation. But where such kind Returns as these, For want of Prudence are neglected, Neither will take much Care to please, Or either Spouse be much respected. FINIS.</field>
