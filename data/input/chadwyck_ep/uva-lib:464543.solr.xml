      <field name="fulltext">De vita et conversacione Sancti Roberti iuxta KnaresburgumSquare brackets denote editorial insertions or emendations. Prologus. Thou luffly Lord of ylkay lede, Crist, þat we knaw by our crede, And God that ys our gouernoure, That luffys all lele men paramoure, And maker ys of all mankynd, Thatt man has maste her in thi mynd, Þatt sytt sall sothely by theselff In sege to deme the tribes twelff Of Yraell—als clerkys kan proffe Þat forsakes all for thi loffe— And called ys God of Abraham. Our Lorde, þat lykkend ys to a lambe, I beseke the, whare I sytte, Visett þat thou wald my wytte Wyth wysdom of thi worthi well This lyffyng trewly forto tell Of Saintt Robertt, þat heremytte Was approued here perfytte, Besyde Knaresburgh in a skerre In a creues closed hym ferre, And full deuoutely he lay In contemplacion nyght and day In seruice of our Sauioure, Als solitary dose day and houre; And howe he lyffed in þat caue, Efter the konnyng þat I haue, Þat treuly whilk I to me toke, Enformed als I was by a boke That was sentt me by a frere Fray Sayntt Robertys to me her; Efter that boke sall I say, Bott I purpose forto pray To Cryst þat he wald sped my penne; Þareto say ylk man ‘Amen’. De ortu &amp; parentela Sancti Roberti. Vhenn frendes fared well at a fest And glewmen gladdes þaim wyth gest, Of harpyng som has lyst to here And som of carpyng of tales sere Of Arthure, Ector, and Achilles— Princes þat wer proude in prese— Of kyngys and kempes, of conquerours, Of lordys, of ladys, of paramours, Þat ar bott vaine and vanite. Of slyke sall noght my carpyng be, Bott of a better he me haste, Fadir and Son and Haly Gaste. Somtyme in Yorke hys lyffe to lede Off a ryghtwys man I red; Toccus Flos I vndirstand Men called hym when he was lyuande, And his wyff Dame Suniuyte; Sho bare a barne þat was perfyte. Robertt I rede thei named hym ryght, For bath he was stalworth and wyght, Wyth thre faes to feght ay freshe, The warlde, þe fend, and wyth hys flesshe; Þir thre he felled wythowten fayll And broght them down in playn batayll. Than when this chyld myldest of mode Couth spek and gang, he was full goode, Of maners meke and of gud thewes, Chaste and etchewand ay schrewes, Deuoutt, deboner, and discrett: A mylder man myght nay man mett. Nouther he was wanton ne wyld, Ne wyth nay foly wald he be fyld, Bott dressed hym wyth deuocioune, Hauntand hympne and orysoune, Vsand abstinence ay fere, Fretand hys fleshe wyth fastyngys sere: That tyme nane toke hym wyth trispas; Off the Haly Gast fulfylled he was; In chyldhed chosen to chastite, Cheftane and chefe of charite, And of all vertues may diuerse Halff þan I may here reherce. In scoles, when he was sett to lere, He consaued mare in a ?here Þan hys felawes dyd in fyffe— Sway thoght Sayntt Roberte forto thryffe!— Wydow and wyff and maden myld, Þar company etchewed þis chyld, And yemed hys yeres well in hys youth By clargy als the chyld well couth; Omonge a thowsand an was he Þat was chosen to this degree; Ay wyth resone he rewled hym ryght. Cryst comforth hym ay als hys knyght! Quomodo Robertus factus est subdiaconus. Than Robertt, blissed in his brest, Purpost hym to be a prest, And to a byshope mayde hym boune And was subdiakenn wyth phannoune; And whi nay may orders he toke Fynd I noght brefed in my boke, Ne ?ytt the cause whi waytt I noght. He waytt þat waytt all þatt ys wroght! Quomodo Robertus ivit ad Novum Monasterium ad fratrem ibidem con[u]ersantem. Than Robert, ay þat ryghtwys was, Purpost hym wyth page to passe Vnto this North Countre a-day, To Newmostres, the abbay gray, Whare he hade a brother frere Off letters lewed als som ys here. When he was broght vnto his brother, Swetly salussed ayther other. Faythfully þan spake the frere And sayd, ‘Robertt, welcom here. The rewle of this religioune To proffe ytt wyth perfeccioune, Wyth othir obseruaunce perfyte, Dresse the, Robertt, wyth delyte, By the counsayll of collacioune, To com to contemplacioune.’ The presidentt þan of that place Sway he gouerned hym by grace, Hauntand hoge heghe halynesse, Feruently fretand hys fleshe, In praers bath and in pennaunce Abydand, and in perseueraunce; And off meruayles þat befell May wyth mouth þan I kane tell. ‘Se,’ he sayd, ‘all in this house, Howe byrddys and bestys to Robert bouse; Howe meke, how myld þat Robert ys!’ All meruailed off hys modynesse. Foure monethes and tway wekys mare Robertt reued wyth monkys þare. Quo(modo Robertus) reversus (est Ebo)racum. And than þis man, myldest of mode, To Yorke agayn full myldly yode, To hys frenshipe and hys frendys, Bott lytell while wyth thaym he lendys. Wyth the Haly Gast this man inspired Nathyng bott God in erth desyred. Wythowten counsayll of his kynne, Quomodo Knaresburgum venit. Vnwettand all bath mare and mynne Bott God, þatt wyssed hym by and thrugh, He kayred and com to Knaresburgh; All thynge forsakand þat he sawe, Nathyng hym lyked bott Goddys lawe. Thar ane hermett Robertt fand Deuoutly in a roch dwelland, Þat a knyght had beyn befor, That tow(r)e and towne and hys tresour, All had forsaken, chyld and wyffe, And þare als hermett led hys lyffe. When this hermett Robertt sawe, ‘Welcom,’ he sayd, ‘my fair felawe!’ And soyne he sayd wyth gud ententt, ‘Blyssed be God, þat me has sentt Swylk a felaw wyth me to woune, Þat dubbed ys wyth deuocioune.’ Thare bath they wouned in wyldernes And haunted full hegh halynesse. Quomodo herimita in temptacione decidit. Bot þe fend, þat ys oure fell enmy, To þir tway had great invy; Bott Robertt myght he noght arest For nay fandyng maste ne lest; To hys felagh forthi he ferd And sway mased mayd hym and merred That Robertt, wyth nay resone ryght, Fray hys mynd amend hym myght. Langir lyked hym noght that lyffe, Bott als a wreche wentt to hys wyffe, Als a hounde þat kastes out of hys kytte And ay turnes and takys eft hys vomytte; And forthermare kan I noght tell By this fayland what befell. Þan Robertt ranne hys saule to saue And in a roche closed him in caue; Off mannes solace nane he hadde Bott grace of God þat mayd hym glad; Wyth ympnes þis hermett þat was tryed Gastly God he gloryfyed. Quomodo ad capellam Sancte Hilde devenit. Tyll on a tyme Robertt gan hy Vnto a wydow þat wouned þareby. ‘Dam’, he sayd, ‘to gyff me this day Off thi almose I the pray.’ Than sayd þat wyff, mody and myld, ‘Þe chapell I graunte þe of Sayntt Hylde, Wyth all the land þat lyes þartyll Þat the lykys—this ys my wyll— To the and thi poremene all ay; Agayn my gyft sall nay man say.’ Þar Robertt wouned þan all a ?here Wyth hys poralles in prayer. Quomodo latrones eum spoliaverunt. Tyll ytt befell apon a nyght Fyff theffys com wyth mayn and myght; Robertt to robbe þay ranne a-day. Hys bour thei brak and bare away Hys bred, hys chese, hys sustinaunce, And hys pormen purueaunce. Þus the fend þes faytors fyff Fanded to fell hym fray hys lyff, Bott ay stalworthly he stode Agayn that foull vnfrely fode, Hauand in hys mynd always How God in hys gospell says, ‘Yff foles pursue ?ow, fals and fell, In a cytee whare ?e dwell, Fles into another thanne.’ Þarfor Robertt rayse and ranne Quomodo ivit Spoford. And sped hym vnto Spofford towne To serue God wyth deuocioune; Þare he haunted halynesse And affliccions of hys flesshe, Vsand abstenence swa great All men had meruayll of hys mette. They caryed fra countres to hym þanne To honore hym als ay haly mane; Þai rosed hym doand reuerence And peirles praysed hym i presenec. Bott when that Robertt vndyrstode Vaynglory þat ay es noght gode, He purpost priuely forto passe Away whar þat hys wounyng was, Quomodo venit Hedlay. And caryed and come to ane abbay Off monkes þat men calles Hedlay; And thei resaued Sayntt Robertt fair Yff he had beyn a myghty mare, And benyngly broght hym in Omang þase monkes mare &amp; mynne. All approued hym als perfytte And cled hym in a coule of whytt. Nathyng vndyrneth he hade; Bott a coule—and þat was bade— Mair to couerynge of hys skynne Than for cald away to wynne. Hys lyffe to lele men gaffe great lyght Als doys a sterne apon a nyght. Off perfeccioune oft he preched And full playnly he enpeched Monkes vnmeke in þare presence Þat sett them vnto insolence. On hym thei raise all in a routte And bade this blyssed mane gay oute; Att hym þay wex bath wrath &amp; irke Bath in closter and in kyrke, And sway dered hym wyth þair dynne Off messy þatt he myght noght mynne. Quomodo revenit ad capellam beate Hilde virginis. Than Robertt rewed and sair repentt And to Saynt Hylde chapell he wentt, Wele leuer to dwell wyth theffys mekyll Þan wyth felaghes fals and fekyll, Better to beld wyth bestys wyld Þan wyth merred men and vnmyld. When he was commen to hys chapell In depe deuocions forto dwell, Poremen that war penyles He fand tham fode of fysshe and flesshe. Iwys this wydow was full fayne When sho wyste he com agayne; Men off crafte swyth gartt scho call To bygge Sayntt Robertt a honest hall, And mansiounes for hys men gart make And a lath for Robertt saike, Hys corne, hys catell in to brynge. Bott he etchewed ouer all thynge Wordes to speke of vanite Wyth freinde or fay; ay wald he fle. Ay to hys mette when he suld flytte, In sylence sadly wald he sytte; Hys visage waned swa wald he wepe, Opon a pamentt ly and slepe A lytyll space that dremyng droghe— Off slepe had he noght halff enoghe! He hired and had þaime to hys handes, Als scriptur says, four seruandes, Tway to the ploghe and ane to gay Aboute the countre forto ta Almos togedir in that land For the poremen þat he fand; The fourth seruaund, soth to say, Hymselff to serue he held hym ay. Þe bred of this Goddes louer lele Þe fourth partte was of barly mele, Þe fyfht of as, wyth mesor maste Wele proporciond in a past; Hys potage was of cale and leke, Off other herbes þat he gartt seke, Sothen wyth saltte and serued tytte: In hys dysshe was na delytte. Fisshe or flesshe whedir he toke Fynd I nathing in my boke, Bott watir drang or ayll thynne, And ?ytt mesor was þareinne. A! myghty men, haue mynd of this, Þat fedes youe bath of flesshe and fysshe And all dayntes þat are dere And delytes youe in þaim here: When thou ys sett &amp; semly serued And thi bred wyth knyffe ys kerued, Partte a porcioune vnto the pore: Sway dyd Sayntt Robert att hys dore. Haue mynd of mesor, man and wyffe, How Sayntt Robertt rewled hys lyffe; To begge an brynge pore men of baile, Þis was hys purpose principale. Quomodo mater eius nuper defuncta eidem apparuit. A tyme als Saint Robertt lay In a medow, tyme of May, In flouers slepand in a sted, Appered hys moder þatt was ded, Paile and wan of hyde and hew, Roberd praers to pursue. ‘Son,’ sho sayd, ‘tentt to my taile. To blysse þou may bryng me fra baile Thrugh help of thi halynesse. Haue mynd I sufferd the of my flesshe.’ Roberd remed and rewed sair And frayned his moder of hyr far. ‘Son,’ scho sayd, ‘yt ys noght to layn: I am pressed and put to payn For mettes and mesores maid vnlele, For okir and vthir fautes fele; For þir and vthir nyght and day I beseke the for me pray.’ Þan Roberd raise and redy was Vnto hys praers forto passe; He syghed, he sobbed, he lytyll sleped, Hys handys he wrang, and wyghtly weped; To God he praed wyth Peter &amp; Paule Forto saue hys moder saule. Þan in the endynge of þat ?ere Appered hys moder to hym here And blyssed hyr barne þat maid hir blyth, Sayand, ‘My sone, now sall I swyth Wend to welth þat neuer sall wane. Farwele! I blysse the, blode and bane.’ Quomodo Willelmus de Stutivilla precepit prosterni habitacula. Apon a tyme, als telles a texte, Bifell this farly althir nexte. Þare wouned a worthly lord a whyle— Men called hyme William Scutivyle— Lord of that land, bath est &amp; weste, Off fryth, of feild, and of forest. Als this William wentt a-day Byside Sainte Roberde place to play, He spirred and spared noght in that place Whay bygged, wha belded in that space. All thei answerd hym full tytt, ‘Ane hermet, þat ys full perfytt; Roberd, þat ys nay rebelloure, A seruand of our Sauioure.’ Þan Wylliam fast began to flytte And sayd, ‘This ys ane ypocrytte, Fautour, felaghe, and a fere; Off all the theffys þat wounes here A receptour Robertt ys, And of my wyld all þat here ys. By the eghe of God, bott yff ?e bowe And dyng doune hys byggynges nowe, I sall gar bryn yowe als a belle: He[r] sall he nay langar dwell!’ Bott ?ytt hys seruandys dyd nay skathe, Ne bowede noght to hys byddynges brathe, Bott lett hys byggynges blythly stand; Þai wyst þat he was wele lyuand. Quomodo prostrata sunt edificia eius. Bott sone aftyr þis befell Þat this Wylliam I of tell Wyth hys hondes hyed hym to hontt Besyd the place whare Roberd wontt, And sawe hys byggynges haile abyde. He chawfed hym and byganne to chyde; He banned and bost þaim forto bete, And sware by Goddes eghen in hys threte Bott yff þai dang hys byggynges doune Þat he sulde gar crake þair croune. Þan þai durst na langar byde, Bott vnto Roberd housynge hyed And dang them doune, bath lesse &amp; mare; Nathyng left þai standand þair. Þan Robertt sawe and sayd þaim tyll, ‘Whedir your lordyng wyll or nyll, Besyd his tour and hys castell Wythouten end here sall I dwell.’ Þis dyd the deuill—þis ys nay dowte— Stirred þis steren man &amp; þis stoute Agayns þis blyssed man in bataill, Wyth fandynge forto gare hym faile; Bott ay stalworthly he stode Augayns the fend; noght chaunged hys mode. He sayd, ‘My Lord, my helpe, ys haile; Quomodo venit ad capellam Sancti Egidii. Off man I dred nay bytter baile.’ When Robert saw all dongen doune, Wyth his boke he mayd hym boune And fared all that forest thrughe And come agayn to Knaresburghe, To a chapell of Sayntt Gyle, Byfor whare he hade wouned a whyll, Þat bygged was in tha buskes wythin, A lytell holett; he hyed hym in And þare wyth depe deuocioune He crepe in contemplacioune, And als ane aungell lede hys lyffe, Sway heghe, sway haly, þat man and wyffe, Heghe and lawe, vnto hym hyed In faith forto be edified. Quomodo quis audivit vocem demonis clamantis. A tyme was herd her of a hend A voyce þus cryand of a fend, ‘Allas! allas! I am the vyce Þat kest outt Adam of paradyse, And ?ytt I may noght wyth forfett Ouercome þis catyeff Robynett; ?it am I prest hym to pursue. Hys noy sall now be euer newe!’ Quomodo dictus Willelmus vidit vaporem fumi ascende[n]tem. Eftirward a lytell while The forsayd William Scutivyle Outt of the North Countre, I weyne, Come to Knaresburghe castell cleyne. Bott als þis ryall was rydand Wyth hond and hauke opon hys hand, Out off Roberd hull full he Rayse a reike þat men myght se. Þan sayd Sir William merueland, ‘What bemeynes ?ond reke rysand?’ ‘Sir,’ ane sayd, ‘out of a cote Whare Robertt dwelles, a mane deuoute.’ ‘What!’ sayd Wylliam, ‘ys þis he Fray my forest þat I gartt fle?’ ‘Yha,’ þai sayd, ‘þis ys the same; Off your wyld beres he na blaym.’ Þan Wylliam wex wytles and wode And swar by Goddes eghen þar he stod That he suld noght to bed be boune To hys cotage ware casten doune; Bott ?ytt þis Wylliam was of wyne Sway dronken þar, als I deuyne, Þat he myght noght hald hys athe, Botte he sware he suld hym skathe And doune gar dyng hys domicelle Opon the morn, euerylkay dele. Þus þis keyn knyght hym vncled And busked and bouned hym to hys bed. Quomodo tres ? erunt Willelm[o] in grabato Bott off a ferly þat eftir fell, Yff ?e wyll lythe, I wyll youe tell. Als William lay, moysand in mynd, Appered thre men blakker þan ynd. Tway droghe a trayle wyth pykes sere— Was neuer sharper thorne ne brere; Thyrd fared befor, a foule freke, Wyth tway maces, þus to speke: ‘Ryse vp, Wylliam, stythely stand, And taik þis mace here in thi hand And defend the wyth thi myght, For fersly sall I wyth the fyght For Robertt saike, þat nay man noyes, Whame þou derfely doune distroes.’ Þan Wylliam, rysand of hys bede, Bath hys armes full wyd he spred, And ‘Mercy’ cryed full carefully And sayd, ‘My mysded mend wyll I.’ Þan þir thre warlowes vanist all away; Wylliam sleped to ytt was day. On the morne he raise out of hys bed And full hastely hym sped Hic precatur Willelmus veniam a Roberto. To Robertt holett, whare þat he Befor hys fett fell on hys kne And sayd, ‘Roberd, forgyff me all My greuouse gyltes; amend I sall.’ Roberd forgaff, and William kyssed And blythely wyth hys hand hym blyssed. Þan William sayd, ‘Fray the roches he Hic dedit Roberto possessionem &amp; elimosinam. To Grymbalde Kyrkstane gyff I the; Land and lythe, all þat þare lyse, To tyll ytt on thi best wyse. Tway hors, tway oxen I the gyffe, Helpe and hald here whyls I lyffe; Tway key I graunte the of my grace To all thi poremen of thi place; Also sustinaunce I sall the send, Fray Yole Day ylka ?ere to thend Off dayes thretten folowand, Tym þat I lyff in this land, Almos bathe of flesshe and fysshe For thretten men; sall they nott mysse.’ Þus messy, mast þat ys of myght, Bath chastes conqueroure and knyght. He kemmes the crowell wyth hys cambe, Off a lyon makys a lambe. He mayd hym meke þat Roberd merred And mayd hym wardan in this werld; Hys sainttys in sorowe noght forsakes Bott, them to comforthe, trewly takes Wyrshype and wysdom wyth concord And loueyng ay to be slyk a lord. Walterus frater eius &amp; maior civitatis Eboracensis edificavit igitur domicilia cum capella. This bifell þat I sall say; Eftirward opon a day Walter, þat was hys brothir dere And Mare of Yorke full many ?here, Com to Knaresburgh, als I rede, Robertt to vysett in hys dede. When he was broght vnto hys brother Full fare salussed ayther other. ‘Brother,’ he sayd, ‘me rewes sare Þat thou beldes in thes buskes bare, And specially in this spelunke In wyldernes als dyd a monke. Yff thou wyll leue and wend wyth me, Whare þat þi liste ys best to be, In couent, closter or company I sall gar sett the sekerly.’ Roberd sayd, ‘Nay! soth I the tell, Hec requies &amp; cetera. Wythouten end here wyll I dwell; Here haue I chosen ay forto won. Farwell! in my benyson!’ When Walter wyst away he wentt; He thanked God for hys trewe ententt. Þan Walter wentt and sentt hym to serse Werkmen wyse of craftes diuerse, Hym to byge a chapell gode In the honore of the Haly Rode. Þare Robertt ryst hym, als I rede, Irke ne ydell neuer of dede. Quomodo Yvonem sibi sociavit. Roberd vmbythoght hym þane Wyth hym to won to haue som man To beilde hym wyth hys besines Þat he myght haunte hys halynes. Furth he wentt and ane he fand, Yue that men called in that land. ‘Yue,’ he sayd, ‘comme, folowe me; Off Gode a seruand sall þou be.’ Thus answerd Yue and to hym sayd, ‘Off this tydynges am I payd. I wyll forsake all þatt I se, Fadyr and freynd, and folowe the, Gold and good, ryches and rentt, Towne and toure and tenementt, Playng and prosperyte, In pouerte forto won wyth the.’ Yue to Roberd ay was lele, Hys almos helpe hym forto dele. To all þat pore was in þat place Full trewly toke Robertt trace. De temptacionibus Yvonis. Sathan, þat sotell ys and quayntte, Thoght to take Yue wyth a taynte. He stirred hym stryffe on ylkay syde Þat Yue thoght bytter to abyde, Bott Roberd wyth hys resons swett Redy was ay hys bales to bett; Bott ?ytte the fend forged hym a whyle This blissed mane forto begyle, Sway that this man, opon a day Wyttles waned and wentt away— Bott God wald noght þat he ware shente! Ubi fregit tibiam. In wodde vnwarly als he wentte, Wyth a boghe hys bayn he brake, And þare lay Yue styll in a slake, And weped iwysse and was full way; The fende was fayn þat was hys fay. Bott Robertt be reuelacioun Was talde þis tribulacioun. Robertt rayse, busked hym belyue, And ranne to he come vnto Yue; And when he saw hym sytt and say, ‘Allas! allas!’ and ‘Waloway!’ Roberd badde hym be in rest— To mane bowes all thinges for hys beste. He toke hys fotte and badde hym stand Hic Robertus sanavit tibiam. And blyssed ytt blythly wyth hys hand, And ytt was hayll, na hurtt ytt had, And than was Yue in gast full glad. Agayne þan wentt thay bath in fere And lyued togedir full many ?here. In frost and snawe to Yorke he yode Quomodo nudis pedibus ivit Eboracum. Barefotte, þat men myght trace his blode, Almos to purchace to hys pore; Euer off catyffes hade he cure. On theffes þan vengiaunce doune gun lyght Þat robbed Sayntt Roberd on a nyght, Brekand the chapell of Sayntt Hylde. Sway sall robbers be begyled; That gode men greues, þai sall hym gryme; Yff ytt be taryed, ytt commes a tyme! Quomodo vaccam domavit. Off a myracle wyll I melle Þat I trow be trew and lele. Off Sayntt Robertt, anes as I rede, Off a cow he had nede To hys pormen in hys place; Þareffor to the Erll Roberd gayse And for a cowe he com and craued. He graunte hym ane þat wytles raued. He bad hym to hys forest fare And ‘Slyke a cowe take the þare. I halde hir wyld; maik þou hyr tame. To thi pore men lede hyr hame.’ Roberd rayked and þider yode And fand this cowe, wyttles and wod; Styll sho stode, nathynge stirrand. Roberd arest hyr in a band And hame wyth hyr full fast he hyed— Meruayle them thoght þat stod besyde. Byrde and best all bowed hym tyll, Euer to wyrke aftir hys wyll. Bott ?ytt a mare ferly befell By this cow þat I sall telle. A mane þare stode and sawe þis syght: To the Erlle he hyed and spake on heght; ‘Syr,’ he sayd, ‘sone sall ?e se Quomodo fautori eam donavit. ?ond kowe þat he sall gyff hyr me; Wyth somme sotell trape or trayne I sall gett ?ond kowe agayne.’ The Erle sayd, ‘So motte I the, Nay counsaylle þarto gyffe I the.’ This faytour forged hym on a wyle Sayntt Robertt how he myght begylle. He wapped hym in a wreched wede, Schappen and sewed in many a screde, Bygane to haltt, to grayn, to grett, Sway Sayntt Robertt forto mett. He cryed als a cayteyff chached in care, Reuffully to rupe and to rare. He cryed and craued Sayntt Robertt kowe: ‘Roberd,’ he sayd, ‘grauntt me hyr nowe, For his sake that sakles was salde; Þoue sees I am bath croked and alde.’ Roberd sayd, ‘Þou schapes þi skorne: God gaffe, Gode haue! Taike hir by the horne And lede hyr wyth the now away.’ Bott whatt byfell I thynk to say. A fott this faytoure myght noght fle, In lyme and lyth so halted he; This wreke when he saw opon hym fall, Opon Sayntt Robertt fast gun he call: ‘Roberd,’ he sayd, ‘thou rewe on me! This greuouse gylte forgyff þou me.’ Roberd said, ‘Here may þou se He that begyles, begylde sall be.’ He blyssed hys bane and mayd yt haile; Þane hame he wentt and tald þis taile. Quomodo cervos includebat orrio. Off another wyll I neuen— Wyth helpe of hyme þatt ys in heuen— Off this forsayd þat I fynde; Es noght to hyd ne halde behynd. Hertes full heghe of hede and horn Vsed to comme to Robertt corn. In feild thei fulled ytt wyth þare fette And stroede ytt bath by sty and strette. Whene Robertt wyst, he was noght payd, Bott yode vnto þair lorde and sayd, ‘Sir, thy catell euen and morne Bathe distroes my hay and my corne. Sir, gare kepe þaim, I the praye; My gode es all in corn and hay To my lyfelade þat I haue, And to my cayteyffes in my caue.’ Than to Saintt Robertt he sayd, ‘Off thi harme I am noght payed; Iff my catell do the skathe, I gyffe the gode leue in thi lathe To pynde my dere þare all bedeyn To the tyme þat all þi harmes be seyne.’ Vnto this sawe Roberd assentt And hame full wysely ys he wentt; Bott he rayse vp oppon the morne And fand þese hertys all in hys corne. He wentt and wagged att them a wand And draffe þise dere hame wyth hys hand, And by law pynde þaime in hys lathe And bade the lord gar se hys skathe. Bott when þat knyght knewe wele þis case Full mekyll meruayll in hertt he hayse; ‘Robertt,’ he sayd, ‘þis ys enoghe! Gar putt þir hertes in thi ploghe And latt them drawe whyls þai may dre: I grauntt þaim frely nowe to the.’ ‘Gramarcy, sir,’ gun Robertt say, And hyed hym hame by the redy way. Quomodo cervos aratro copulavit. Into hys ploghe he gartt þaim passe. Als meke and mylde als lamme þai was To dryff, to drawe, to louse, to bynde, Als any ox þat man myght fynde. All men had meruaille of this syght, Sayd Roberd was a man of myght. Thay loued our Lord omnipotentte Sway great a grace þat hym had sente. Quomodo demon apparuit ei. The fend to man þat ys enmy To Robertt had greatt inuy; Als wreth he wex als a wype: He thoghte to teyne hym wyth a type. Apon a tyme, als I am lered, Þe fend to Sayntt Robertt appered. In a lyknes blake and lathe— Ytt to discryffe I am noght grathe! Aboutte hys house þis harlott hyede, Hys deuociouns he defyed; All the vessell þat he fand He tyfeld and touched þaim wyth hys hand, His pott, hys panne, his sause, his soule, Wyth hys fyngers fatt and foule. When Robertt sawe, þat reken was, ‘A! wrech,’ he sayd, ‘I byde the pas Outte off this place now wyth thi playntte. Þou sall noght take me wyth a tayntt.’ Item alia vice demon apparuit ei. Another tyme, als I here tell, This noyand nedder fals and fell Appered in lyknes of a carle, Blake als pyke, bygan to parle. He toke a strenkell þare ytt stode Wyth haly watter gayn and gode, And wyth a wanyng of þat wate He gartt Sir Gerrard ga hys gate. Item alias apparuit ei demon. Another tyme opon a nyghte, Roberd prayand for hys plyghte, In lyknes of a yonge chylde Off seuen ?eres, meke and mylde, Appered and kneled opon hys kne And mowed befor Saynt Roberd ee; He mayd great noyse and great vnreste To lett hym of hys praers preste. Bott Roberd sesed noght for þis syght, Bott euer prayand lay þat nyght. Than þat warlow wex full way: Togedir he gedird all the stray Wythin the place, and þane he paste Apon a fyer ytt forto caste. Than Robertt crossed ytt all aboutte And sone þat flamme was slokkend oute. Item apparuit Roberto. Another tyme þis Gerrard gryme In lyknes transfigured hyme Off a chyld off sexten ?here Sway to Robertt to appere, And, on hym gapand, gyrned and gnaste; Robertt þaroff was noght abaste And wyth hys staffe, als he was wontt, Bett hym and began to shontt. ‘Allas! allas!’ begane to say, ‘I weynd. I weynd, full waloway! Yff I be slegh, I am ouersett Off this rusty Robynett.’ Thus Sathanas on ylkay syde Vmbeseged hym tyme and tyde In temptacions ilkane sere Þat may be wroght or wretyn here, Sway to brynge hyme vnto baille, Bott of hys hertt he was sway haille That na fandyng myght hym fell— And that forthoght the fend of hell! Quomodo Johannes rex ministravit Robertum. Forthirmare now wyll I flytte To enforme youe of a fytte, Kynge Johanne how Syr Bryane broght; Hys celle to se he him besoght. Robert he fand kneland prayand, Hys orysons contynuand, That for nay noyse þat þai couth maike Nay mare he mowed þan dose ane ake. Þan Bryan sayd, wythouten lytte, ‘Roberd, my brothir, rise vpe tyte. Here standes our comly kyng wyth croune To visett the wyth deuocioune.’ Þane Roberd rase full hastely And spak to Bryan besily And sayd, wythouten taryinge, ‘Kenne me, Bryan, to my kynge.’ Sir Bryan sayd to hym by signe, ‘Þis ys Kyng Johann maste condigne.’ Þan Robertt toke ane ere of corne And sayd, standand the kyng byforne, De spica grani. ‘Yff thou be kynge, sir, kan þou oght Off corn maike slyke ane ere of noght?’ Than þai sayd to that suffraynge, ‘Þis man ys noght haille of brayne; By this ensample þat we se He schewes hymselffe a fole to be.’ ‘Sir,’ he sayd, ‘so motte I the, Þis man ys mare wyse þane we, For he serues bath day and houre Na suffrayne botte hys Sauioure In whame ys all wysdom &amp; wytte; This man full wysely folowes ytt.’ Than sayd the kyng, semly in saylle, Vnto þis man spirituaylle, ‘Aske me, Robertt, what þou wyll, And godely sall I grauntte þaretyll.’ Tha[n] sayd Robertt to the kynge, ‘I haue nay nede of erthly thynge. Enoghe I haue, syr, graunte mercy.’ Than wentt the kyng to hys company. Quomodo Yvo obiurgavit Robertum. When the kyng was wentt, to hym come Yue And sayd, ‘Robertt, þoue wyll nott thryue. Off the kyng why wald þou craue na gode, Ne aske nay almos or he yode, To þi poralles in this place?’ Roberd sayd, ‘In Gode ys grace, That godely gyffes vs kow and corne.’ ‘Yha,’ quod Yue, ‘bott noght by the horne! Fole, gay furth, pursue þi frende.’ Roberd sayd, ‘Yha,’ and furth gan weynd Quomodo rex dedit terram &amp; cetera. And to the kyng began to say, ‘Certes, syr, I forgat to pray For som almos, flesshe or fysshe.’ The kynge answerd and sayd, ‘Iwysse, I gyff and grauntt, est and west, Als mekyll land in my forest Als thou may tyll the wyth a ploghe.’ ‘Syr,’ sayd Roberd, ‘þat ys enoghe Me to manteyn and my men.’ Agayn Sayntt Robertt rayked hym then. Sirres, forsoth my hertt in sonder Me thynke bath wepes and wirkes for wondir That he, þat was sway waike a thynge, Durst spek sway saffly wyth hys kynge. Tyrauntes trembled þat did hym teyne; Slyke selcouth was bath schewed and seyne. Bestes and birdes vnto hym bowed; Fendys hym fledde þat come in clowde; Durste nayne hym dere he was so digne; God for hym schewed full many signe. Þan Robertt tilled and mayd hym toghe Aboutte housebandry of hys ploghe. Quomodo rector de Knaresburgo decimas exigebat. Off Knaresburghe kyrke the persone þan Rodely vnto Roberd ranne, Hys teynde to craue of corne and hay, Bott defyed hym wyth ‘Nay’. The persone sayd, ‘Þou sall ytt gyffe, Wyll þoue, nyll þoue, and I lyffe, And I my happe haue and my hele; The lawe sall ytt discusse and dele.’ Robertt sayd, ‘Sothly þou raues Þat vntrewly teyndes craues To pore men þat appropird ys. Neuer ?ytt yt newed to now a cresse! My teyndes thou craues vnconnandly; I graunte the Crystys cursynge forthi!’ T[h]e persone tonge, þat toyled þis sayntt And displesed hym wyth hys playntt, Was wyth vengiaunce and wyth wreke Spoyled þat he myght neuer speke, Ne had nay space, bott att hys laste In payne and pouertt hethen he paste. Thus he þat couettys thyng vnlele, When he deghes hais noght to dele Off hys aghen wythin hys wane. Yll gytten gode, men says ytt sall be gane. Quomodo habuit spiritum prophecie. ?itt of a meruayle list me mele, That I trowe be trewe and lele, Off Roberd that was resonable And to pore men profytable, How Bryan, by the kyngys commaundment, Into this North þat tym was sentt; Bott on nay wyse wald he weynd Bott by Sayntt Robertt hys faythfull freynd. Full ryally to hym he rayd And kneland on hys kne he sayd, ‘I beseke the for me pray And blysse me or I weynd away.’ Roberd badde Sir Bryane stand And blythely blyssed hym wyth hys hand, Spekan to hym in prophecy, ‘Weynd þoue worschipfully; Gouerne þou sall well þi degre In ioy and in prosperite, Bott agayn commes þou nay mare. Cryst he kepe the nowe fray care!’ Þir wordes when Bryan vnderstod Away he wentt wyth drery mod, And to Northe Cuntre he rayd, And þair he dyed als Robertt sayd; His saule passed vnto paradyse For in this warld Bryan was wyse. Here may ?e se, bath yonge and alde, A prophett þat he may be called. Quomodo prophetavit de Fontinensibus. Bott ?ytt forthermare I fynd— Þat ys noght gode to hald behynd— Eftsones how he prophetised: Þase wordes to wrytt I am avised. Befor Robertt that ryghtwyse was Outt off this wreched dayle suld passe, ‘When I am sweltt,’ he sayd to somme, ‘Monkes of Fountaunce sammenn sall comme My body forto bere away Beried to be in thare abbay. Ytt ys my wyll wyth myght and mayn Stalworthly þat ?e stand agayn. I wyll be doluen wharso I deghe; Beried my body þare sall ytt be; Wythouten end here wyll I rest; Here my wounyng chese I fyrste, Here wyll I leynd, her wyll I ly In this place perpetuely.’ Roberd keped a ryghtwyse reule All tym þat he couth crepe or creule, In crage, in creues, or in caue, Sway sadde he was hys saule to saue. Fray sted to sted he stepped and stode Þar nay myscheffe merred hys mode; Comforth ne care, baile ne blysse, Myght noght chaunge hys chere a rysshe; Durese, dishese, dere ne dred, Well ne wyrschipe, als I red, Myght stire hym halffe a stryde; All bytternes he couth abyde; Forthi our Lord to lerred and lewed Many ferly for hym schewed, Hys godnes bath to gloryfy And vther men to edyfy, And als to men hys mekyll myght Forto mostre day and nyght, Myracles sway many wythouten maike Our Sauiour schewed has for hys saike, Bath efter ded and in hys lyffe— The halff þat I kane noght discryffe. Thus in romaunce haue I herd That Roberd rouled hys lyffe in werlde. To hym be louynge lastand ay Þat hym gaffe power forto pray, And forto saue oure saules syne In blysse bringand fra bitter pyne. Than Roberd, aye þat ryghtwys wasse, Persayued þat hym bode hethen passe By dede, þat nouther duke ne kynge Ne suffrayn sparys he; nay thinge Sinfull ne saint, ryche ne pore, May sayff ne maike nane, sound ne sore. Quomodo ornavit lampidem suam ante mortem. He sett hym sadly forto say Psalmes and ympnes, and forto pray To Gode and to hys Moder dere, And to all hys sainttys sere, And to hys aungels and all Doune to comme began to call, Att hys wey[n]dynge hym to wyshe And to bryng hys saule to blesse. Þan in seknes sadde and sare He fell þat he myght moue nay mare, Bott cryed on Gode contynuely, ‘Lord, on me þou haue mercy!’ When Yue saw Roberd draw to dede Full wille he wex þan off hys rede; De Yvonis doloribus et gemitu. He syghed, he sobbed and gaffe hym yll, Bott ay badde Robertt Yue be styll; In hertt was heuy all þat herde Þat Robertt weynd suld off þis werlde. Kneland þai come and þaim commend, Þar saules to saue wythouten end. Than monkes of Fountaunce come full tyte And wyth þaim broght an habytt whytt, And sayd, ‘Robertt, this sall þou haue Wyth the when thou gase to thi graffe.’ Roberd sayd, ‘Sirres, when I deghe My aghen clethyng suffyce to me.’ (Bott ?ytt they dyd when he was ded Befor that myght noght stand in sted; Þat ys to say, in coule hym cled, And sway thay bare Robertt to bed.) When Robertt saw þat he suld dee ‘In manus tuas, Domine,’ He sayd and sweltt and gaffe hys gaste To the Fader and þe Son and the Haly Gaste. Than aungels broght hys saull to blysse, Honored it to be als ane off hys. Yue closed hys eghe wyth mekyll care; All wepid for way, bath lesse and mare. A herce they sett sone apon trees And dyd deuoutly dirigees. When thys was talde, Fountaunce full faste Wyth great power þider paste To reue þaim Robertt body blyste, Bott Knaresburgh of tham wyste, Off men off armes araed routte Forto hald þase monkes oute. Wythouten harme so hyed they hame; Bare nane for hys body blayme. Than caryed and com outt of the cuntree Mane and wyff of all degree, Pore and rych, all maide þaim boune Wyth men off religyoune, To bere hys body oponn a bere Wyth melody þat men myght here, And beryed hym in a grayff full god In the chapell þat was of the Haly Rode, Befor the heghe awter in a toumbe; Hys myracles may nay man soumbe In the chapell—þat er red full ryffe— That Walter wroght hym in hys lyffe. All þat was seke and to hym soght, Be þat thai yode, þaim ayled noght. Crased &amp; croked, bath deiff and domme, War cured þat to hys toumbe wald comme. Þe halt was heled, the lame was lyght, Blynde and bysen hadde þair syght, Men of menbirs þat war mayned Was saued full sound when þai wer saynd; Obcessed off fend he gart þaim flytte, Wytles and wod won in þair wytt; Lunatykes and frenesyse Thrugh hys myght ware mayd full wyse; Baran bare hir childe belyffe And some ware rased fra ded to lyffe. And, to conclude þaim all in fere, All þat hurtt hadde any here, Or any seknes, all ware saued Thayr hele because þai of hym craued. Þai may be glad and blyth þat has Slyke a patrone off þair place Þat ys off power forto pray For thare plyght bath nyght &amp; day. God for hys saike hys seruaundes saues, Nathyng denyes hym þat he craues. All praers þus for þar place To God to gouern þaim by grace, And whaso greues god men þerin Or payres þair place, þai do great syn And er acursed by bulles sere Þat Papys of Rome has graunt þaim here. Forthi I rede you all forbere Sanctuaries to do þaim dere. Yue ledde hys lyff lang in that sted Aftur the tyme Roberd was ded In bedes, praers, and orisounes And in othir deuociounes. Þan dyed þis daynty man a-day And went to ioye þat last sall ay, To the whike he bryng yow all and me, Amen, Amen per charite. DE INITIO CREACIONIS ORDINIS SANCTE TRINITATIS Almyghty Lord in mageste Þat was and ys and ay sall be, Grauntte me nowe and euermore Þe grace þat I besoght before. Eftyr the tyme Roberd was dede Yue wouned styll in þatt stede, Apperand in perfeccioune To serue God in subieccioune. The place wyth the appurtinaunce Tha[n] gyffen was to hys gouernaunce; He gaff ytt—?ytt all men may se— To Couerham wyth a charter fre, Þair to fynd perpetuely Tway chanons syngand sykyrly; And sway thay dyd ?heres diuerse, Bott clerly kanne I noght reherce How ytt wentt outt off þair hand, Bott trewly als I vndyrstand That ytt some tyme stode desolatte For dede or elles for some debaytte, And sway entird ay to be The Ordir of the Haly Trinite. In ane hede persons thre ar knytt; By þis ensaumpill sall þou wytt Playnly þat possessiounes Off this ryall relygiounes Deuised and deltt sall be in thre: Tway partes to the Ministre and his men?he; Þe third þat raysed ys of þar rentt To the Haly Land sall ytt be sentt To releue and to relese Crysten men þat ar in dishese, Ys doune in full depe doungeouns Pyned in pyttes and i prisouns Omong the Jewes, and Sara?yns In þair fetters fast þaim byndys And in þair ploghes puttys þaim to draw And sithen þair sede settes þaim to sawe. The third porcion of this ordir fre, Þat þai send by?ond the se, Ys raunsoun and redempcioun Off ylkay a crysten region, Crysten cayteffys forto by Outt of prysouns þair þai ly. Mynistre þus expounde ?he may, Þat ys bott seruaund forto say; All yff he serue, ?ytt hys degre Als a prelate awe to be. Þis worde ys wreten of our Lord, Þat to þis curate may accorde. Non veni ministrari sed ministrare. Oure Sauiour sais, yff ytt be soghte, ‘Her to be serued come I noght, Bott forto serue I come myselff.’ Þis same he schewed vnto twelff. The clethinge of þise men perfyte By this incheson ytt ys whit: For the angels bryght þat lyghted lawe In clething whytt als any snaw Bysyde the graue of our Sauiour, And also by thys same coloure May men vndirstand and se The clennes of mannes chastite; The crosse, þat on þair clethinge cleues, Ys mynd of the rode þat man releues— The rede by resoun of hys blode, Þe blewe for the water þat wyth ytt yode: Thus I vndirstand þaim here. Tot capita tot sentencie. Ilke hede has a sentence sere How the Order of the Haly Trinite First begane—here sall ?e se; Als I haue herd I vndirtoke, Bott I haue seyn ytt in nay boke. Off twa heremites haue I herd That wyse ware when þai woned in werld; Off the Haly Gast þai wair inspired, Bott anely Gode noght þai desyred. A preciouse purpos ayther toke And wysely wrayt ytt in a boke; To the Pape þay putt þat blyssed byll And he resaued ytt wyth gode wyll. When he hade þair gud intentt Wyth thar byll away he wentt, Prayand God to schewe hym sone By þat byll what suld be doyne, And called hys counsayll in this case To beseke God off hys grace. Bott aftur what befell Forre þair prayers sall I tell. The Pape als he sang messe a-day Specially for þis case to pray, Appered ane aungell bryght of ble And kest a clething att hys kne, And badde hym take þat clething tyte Þairin to cleth hym men perfyte. The Pape doune falland wyth hys handes Loued our Lord þat hys seruaundes Sway saues and comforthes ay And grauntes all þaim þat þai for pray. He toke this clethinge cleyn and whyte And þarein cledde þase heremytes tyte, Badde þaime increse and multyply Here to lyffe a halely. Þan þai stepped ouer streme and strand And releued in the Haly Land; Cayteffes þat wer chached in care, Pressed in prisouns, naked and bare, Plonged in ploghe, in cartt drawand, Outt thei boght þaim wyth besand. Þan þus began þe ordre fre That ys off the Haly Trinite. Detbundon þis order ys to do On this wise þase cayteffes to, Thaim to raunsoune and to by Wyth the third partt off thar tresory. Nay mair att þis tym kan I say, Bott wyth all my hertt I pray To God þat he þaim saue &amp; send To myrth þat neuer mare sall haue end. Explicit.
