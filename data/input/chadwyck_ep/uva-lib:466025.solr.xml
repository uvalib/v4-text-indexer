      <field name="fulltext">First Series. Second Thousand. PREFATORY NOTE. When I suggested to the poet a few prefatory words to the second thousand of this First Series, he suggested playfully that I should write one myself as publisher, so here it is: A purpose of a Preface is, of course, to give the clue To things the author wished to teach when penning lines to you. Such teaching is scarce needed here, the lessons are so clear; Inspiring every thoughtful man to hold as things most dear Such actions as shall help the right and overcome the wrong, Bring comfort to the sorrowful and make the weak man strong. C. L. COURTIER. AUGUST, 1914. Methought before mine inner sight there came A vision of the present. Line on line Of brown-clad listening men, with eyes aflame, Stood waiting, brows intent, to hear the sign Of combat. As I looked, and looked, alas! Full many a good man dropped, and, writhing, fell, For lo! I saw,—I saw, as in a glass, Foe slain by unseen foe—a glimpse of Hell. Once more I gazed. I heard young children cry In yonder villages, where rolling smoke Showed where large shells had burst, while far and nigh Women clasped tight their babes, who ne'er awoke. Then, there, the corn stood, all unreaped, till crushed, Futile for human food, while ravening strife Made earth Gehenna. Gaunt-eyed Famine hushed Myriads of silent mothers, worn with life. Methought before mine inner sight arose A vision of the future. Gone for aye Were “war-lords,' and the peoples bowed to those Who worshipped calm-eyed Peace, and only they. BRITAIN'S APPEAL TO HER MEN. Yours, not for self, to wield the sword— Yours, not for self, to speak the word, Duty—which leads, perchance, to death, Ay, self-less death, your mortal breath Is doubly glorified, thereby; 'Tis ever thus that heroes die. Awakened from inglorious ease, Your call has come at length, Floats now your flag in every breeze, Put on, put on, your strength! Remember, English lads, Louvain; Dream, stalwart Scotsmen, once again Of old oppression; ye from Wales Think how a little State prevails When just. Let sons of Ireland feel For Belgium 'neath the foeman's heel. Let each, awakening from his ease, Hear his “clear call” at length, Behold his flag in every breeze, And so put forth his strength. What! though amid the noontide glare, What! though amid the balmy air Of August nights your comrades died Retreating. Let it be your pride Aye to outshine them—till at last War's lurid stormclouds all are past. Awakened from inglorious ease Here sounds your call at length! There! floats your flag o'er lands and seas! Be glad! put forth your strength! September 12th, 1914. SOLDIER'S SONG. March on, my lads! March on, my lads! Not dreaming of the morrow; While all is well, let well suffice, Why should we dream of sorrow? Still on, still on, with backs unbowed, Faces alert and bright, Remembering, aye, that all we do Helps Britain and the right. An hour ago poor Ned was hit, I fear he lies in pain, 'Tis sad, no doubt, yet sooner now He'll see his Bess again. Still on, still on, with backs unbowed, And give another blow; Aim straight! strike hard! nor think of self, Faces toward the foe. Still on, still on, with backs unbowed, So, when the night is here, Mayhap we'll sleep, though autumn mist Makes trenches cold and drear— Mayhap we'll sleep, yet wake to fight, To fight, and, once more fight, Remembering, aye, that all we do Helps Britain and the right. September 28th, 1914. A SONG FOR BELGIUM. October 9th, 1914. Not a throb of our hearts but in anguish responds To the sight of the dire desolation! Oh! cruel the thraldom and bitter the bonds Of our wretched and down-trodden nation! And in scarce-spoken words we are heard to declare, War hath made us well-nigh broken-hearted, Ah! often, alas! we are fain to despair Since joy from our land hath departed. Yet, arouse ye, undaunted, remembering that still Retribution is certainly waiting, Still strive with the foemen who work us such ill 'Mid their bland hypocritical prating. Keep our nation awake! though down-trodden she lies! Not a moment be longer down-hearted! And rejoicing will come if fair Belgium arise, And her freedom return which departed. AUTUMN, 1914 Death's work had lyddite and shrapnel done On friend, on foe, ere set of sun, And yet Hell's havoc ceased not with night, But still went on till dawn of light. But then, with the rose-hued hint of day, The rouse of battle passed away. Then, then, was shown what night had hid, Alas! that eyes should see what they did. Behold a prospect, half ridge, half plain, Cumbered, good God, with maimed and slain. Here lies a soldier, scarce more than boy; Tending rare flowers his home employ. His jaw is shattered, his face all blood, Near is his dead horse, smeared with mud. There lies one dead; to his evil face Even Death itself hath brought no grace. And here is one, who, once, was a man, By Nature built on her kindly plan, One leg is mangled; two hands are gone,— And yet,—and yet,—life lingers on! Unseen by the searchers, and longing for death, Painfully heaves he breath after breath. But why prolong the gruesome tale Of what now cumbers hill and dale? Because, even here, there comes oft-times Heaven's light, amid War's sin and crimes. Yonder a Frenchman and German lie, Mortally wounded, and, soon, to die. The German, his water-bottle burst, Feels all the pangs of a feverish thirst; And, by a look of mute appeal, Makes even the heart of his foeman feel, And says, as he shares the Frenchman's store, “Where we are going is no more war.” And, as he passed to the Other Land, He bent and kissed his foeman's hand. O! who shall say that none keep tryst Here, on this grisly field, with Christ? THE CHIEF RABBI OF LYONS. (Autumn, 1914). Among the sunny vineyards of fair France Creeps the slow agony of War's mischance; And, day by day, more villagers awake To find their homesteads, wrapt in battle, quake; To find their low, ridged terraces of vines, On which, it seems to them, the kind sun shines In countless autumns past, so lovingly, Are trampled by the surge of cavalry. On yonder wooded heights men see for days The charge and counter-charge 'mid sulphurous haze. Yet, hourly, hourly, men of mercy stir With gentle touch to tend the wounded there, Or soothe the dying in their direst need— Men of kind hearts, though differing as to creed. A rabbi here, bravest of these brave souls, Who know no fear although War's thunder rolls, Happily, hitherto, untouched by scathe, Still cheers and comforts those of his own faith. Once, as he moves on his heroic round, To him, faint yet distinct, there comes a sound Of piteous entreaty, and he sees, A little way removed among the trees, A soldier dying. He deceived, perchance, By grievous pain, or by a fleeting glance, The rabbi, in his dark-hued garb, mistakes For some good curé, and, with voice which quakes With death on-coming, asks before his eyes The crucifix be held. Without surprise The rabbi does his bidding. O wise man! To rank Humanity above the ban Of dogma. Shall not this be thy reward Thy soul made happy by thy high soul's Lord? Second Series Second Thonsand. “THE COMRADE IN WHITE.” It is said, especially in the French lines, that after many encounters a man in white has been seen succouring the wounded. The French call him “The Comrade in White.” Adown the long, long avenues of fight Dark Jean and Pierre beheld Him come. He looked, Said they, as though indeed, He were, in truth, Incarnate deathless Courage; yet withal Calm with eternal calmness. Much they told About Him. Yet, I smiled, and wondered if Their toil and weariness made them distraught. One night the order came; our company Was bidden to advance. At first it seemed That all was well, the thunder of our guns Had opened, so appeared to us, a way To win the point desired. Then suddenly We saw that all was lost. A soldier fell To right and left of me. I was alone; A moment more, and, I dropt, wounded, then No more I knew; nor was aware until The night was here. When I came to myself The stars were shining, and clear was the night. I lay in a small hollow. Soon, too soon The firing re-commenced. Lo! then a step Majestic, slow, (how calm and unafraid) Approached. At first, so little did I dream Of Who He was, that, when I saw the white, Pure texture of His raiment, 'twas, methought, Some woman, full of strange forgetfulness, Or, haply, some poor peasant, whose white smock Casts shadows thus. He raised His arms aloft Unfearing whirling bullets, as though He Were now in act to bless, and spake sweet words, Old and familiar. Then He raised me up, And bore me hence, to where soft waters flowed— Me, tall, large-limbed, and, there, He washed my wounds, And bound them. Great, great was my agony Of body; yet, when He but touched me, lo! Mine inmost soul was bathed in very bliss. I slept; and, when I woke, around I looked, The Friend was with me still. He stood apart As if in prayer. Anon, with hand outstretched, Toward me He gazed. Mine eyes beheld a wound Upon that hand. “Wounded you, likewise, are,” I murmured low. Perchance He heard, perchance The look upon my face told Him my meaning. “Old is my wound,” He said, “and, yet, it hath Troubled Me much of late.” Swiftly He rose, “Lie there, beside the water, for to-day,” He told me, “and, to-morrow, I will come, Of you I have much need.” And, so I lie Lonely and weak, my pain increasing, yet Anchored in joy because He comes to-morrow. June 18, 1915. Centenary of Waterloo. IN THE FRENCH TRENCHES. It is said that a French private soldier, colloquially “un poilu” of volatile disposition, bought a small Bible one day, soon after the war began, on one of the Quais at Paris; and that, when in subsequent danger and fear, he opened it in the trenches, almost inadvertently he found the words: “Be strong, fear not,” and was impelled thereby to do his duty. The Legion of Honour is usually designated merely as “The Legion.” Strange is my Paris, here and now, My Paris once so gay, No heart have I to sit and drink An absinthe here to-day. Achille is gone, and tall Jean, too, And where we used to sit, At Père Odette's, why, there I see Scarce one, when lights are lit. At noontide where we used to play Vive l'Amour in the shade Talk they of wounds, talk they of death, Or how the shells are made. I'm glad that I'm “un poilu” now, I'm glad that I must go, For naught can check “the vapours” like Swift marching to and fro. Cold is the night, cold is my heart, And yet no coward I; Yet cold it is to sit and think, And cold 'tis here to lie. Cold is my heart for tall Jean's sake 'Twas here, just here, he died; Cold is my heart for Achille's sake, Here, bleeding, by my side. Cheerless it is, and gloomy, too, As breaks the heavy day. I'll read the Book I bought erewhile To wile the hour away. Ah! here it is: never before Have I read such a Book, At such a time little it recks In what I read, or look. I turn the page: “Be strong, fear not,” The very word for me, For lo! the cannonade begins, The shot fall heavily. [He awakes in a hospital, wounded.] “Be strong, fear not!” Where am I now? This place, large-roomed, high-walled, Brings back no memories; yet they say 'Twas mine, when Duty called To hurl the Boches rearward; and they say That, while I lie at rest, “Mon Général” will come and pin “The Legion” on my breast. France's Day, 1915. THE DESERTER. “There is a soul of goodness in things evil.” Shakespeare. “He showed no grace till the hour he died.”— Dante Rossetti. “I can smoke a cigar to the glory of God.”— Charles Haddon Spurgeon. A British private soldier served at the Front for some time. He was given to drink, however, and other bad influences, and, at last deserted. In about two months he was caught. Then he was tried, and sentenced to be shot. On the night before the execution a minister of religion came to offer him spiritual consolation. On leaving he asked whether he could do anything for him. The man desired tobacco, and, on receiving four cigarettes, all the enquirer had, he bestowed two on the sentinel guarding him. Haggard, and stern of mien, he sits As, seen by inner sight, there flits Through some strange and obscuring haze, Vague visions of his dull, past days. His life, one long, dull tragedy Before him lay; 'twas well that he Felt not as others would have felt. Of gentler nurture, few had dealt With him in kindness. Now, alas! Short were the hours 'twere his to pass On earth. Scarce thought he of his crime Save with one slow regret; the time Moved grimly; a well-meaning man Repentance talked—a stupid plan To him, unwilling, then had asked Did he crave aught. It had not tasked The fancy of the prisoner, To crave one boon, and, now, lay there Within his hand, four cigarettes. “Poor bloke,” cried he, his vain regrets All gone, “the bloke who guards me here Wants two, as well as me, no fear,” And holding out a friendly hand, He makes the other understand. THE WISE HORSE. (A True Story of 1914.) Ere the trench warfare is begun, And men change post ere rise of sun, A troop of our best cavalry Are called to charge the enemy. Onward! with faces all a-glow With martial ardour, now they go, No man in bearing seems to err, No gallant steed deserves the spur, One moment sees their proud advance, With whirling sword or glittering lance. The next beholds a bursting shell Fall in their midst—a bolt of Hell. A soldier, wounded nigh to death, Drops slowly, panting now for breath, Seeing him fall, his faithful horse With bent neck, looks, then checks his course, Once more he looks, looks yet again, Sure is it, now, he knows the pain, Then, by kind instinct gentle made, He bends, and seeks to render aid. The man's torn raiment holding fast, He lifts him up; and gallops past All danger: then, and not till then, Amid a picket of our men, From his kind mouth he loosed his load And softly neighed for help, nor strode Away although that help had come. Later, amid the gathering hum Of friendly tones, and friendly hands, He looks; he knows; he understands; And takes his sugar quietly, While men say, for his bravery, Now he deserves the famed V.C. THE FAITHFUL DOG. (A French Soldier's True Tale.) Slowly I come from poignant dreams of pain, Wounded how sorely. Weak yet all too weak To know my weakness, once, and yet again, Something stirs near me, though it does not speak. Grievous are my dire hurts. A piece of shell Is lodged within my arm; a sabre thrust Has wounded now my head; and, lo! as well A rifle ball is in my cheek. I must Lie prone among the dead, yet life is sweet, Yea, sweet, despite mine agony. Methought Anon some living thing has touched me,—meet To render aid—Oh! helplessness unsought Which leaves me thus to suffer 'mid the dead Bearing mine anguish, anguish constant, sore Would, would, that I could rouse me, if instead Of death, there comes the kindly touch once more. Once more comes the soft touch. With opened eyes I see it is our faithful dog who comes To aid his wounded friends. With sad surprise He sees me in this dreadful case. The drums Were beating “the attack” when last we met, And triumph seemed in sight. How different now! Yet he may save me. I will not regret My pain in calling him should Fate allow This much of good. He sees. He understands. He goes to call my comrades. Not too late Perchance they yet may reach me,—gentle hands May raise me, or with drink my thirst abate. I hear, I hear at last the measured tread Of hurrying footsteps! Soon will they be here. Thank God I shall not perish 'mid the dead, Living, may yet His holy name revere. WHY WE DO NOT WIN THE WAR. The three pictures sought to be depicted in this poem are the expression of the strong feeling raised in me by what I have recently heard and seen. The first is a general picture of a condition of affairs known to all of us—the picture of men willingly sacrificing life, or suffering mutilation, for pure and selfless love of country. The second was inspired by a very recent occurrence at a London Hospital, where the visiting of the wounded has lost its early popularity as a Sunday duty. The third picture describes the disgust with which I, having occasion of late to visit a fashionable hotel in the South of England, witnessed the extravagant living of well-dressed, well-to-do people, amidst the poverty around, and at a time when poor people are being urged to economise. “Thy Mercy on Thy People, Lord.” Rudyard Kipling. “There He could do no mighty works because of their unbelief.” — The New Testament. “The British Army is an army of lions led by asses.” A French proverb, adapted from a saying of Napoleon I. I. The Trenches. Is it, oh, is it, that our countrymen Born of the people, loyally and well, Have given their bodies in their country's cause, Have suffered wounds, disablement, and hurts Worse far than death itself? It is! It is! II. The Hospital. Is it, oh, is it, that one autumn Sunday, Lately, in London's central heart there stood A Home of Healing with wide-opened doors? Two days before it had received a load Of maimed and helpless ones: part of the fruit, The ghastly fruit—of one week's work in Flanders. Yet, on that autumn Sunday, came there not One single visitor to soothe or cheer, Despite the parrot cry of “Brotherhood” Uttered in churches—can it be sincere? Churches, alas! where Caste still reigns, although Christ died upon the Cross to thrust out Caste. Can this be true? Yea, it is even so. III. The Hotel. Is it, oh, is it, that one autumn Sunday, In one fair hostel, all embowered in trees, Foul gluttony there was of men and women, For there, they lived to eat, not ate to live? Alas! Alas! Yea, it is even so. Oct. 29, 1915. Third Series. PRAISE TO THE BRAVE. “Dulce et decorum est patria mori.” Sweet and fitting is it to die for the fatherland. Old Roman Proverb. . . . “naught can make us rue If England to herself remain but true.” Shakespeare. A quotation which, I think, peculiarly appropriate to the national circumstances of his country at this, his third centenary. Police Constable Alexander Dundas, T Division of the Metropolitan Force, stationed at Teddington, was a very early member of the National Union of Police and Prison Officers (he was No. 23 on the roll), and had contributed often to the Union Journal, using the pen name of “White Ensign.” He had been in the Navy, originally, and, on the outbreak of war, he rejoined that service. One day, when on watch, he detected the periscope of an enemy submarine, and judging the position critical, without waiting for orders, he fired at, and hit it. For firing without orders he was arrested, but when the actual facts came to the knowledge of his captain, he was released, the whole ship's company was assembled, and he was thanked, publicly, before them. Later, he received the Distinguished Service Medal. On the 29th of February, 1916, the Auxiliary Cruiser “Alcantara,” on which Dundas was serving as Leading Seaman, was engaged, on patrol duty, off the East Coast of Scotland, searching for contraband. She encountered the German Cruiser, “Greif,” disguised as a Norwegian merchantman. The “Alcantara” approached the “Greif,” and while Dundas, as coxswain, was waiting, with his boat's crew, at her side, to take his officer on board the “Greif,” suddenly the latter lowered her false bulwarks, and fired a broadside at the “Alcantara.” One of the shots killed Dundas and the boat's crew. The “Alcantara” replied, and fought bravely; but, alas! was, at last, sunk. Eventually H.M.S. “Andes” came up, and sank the “Greif.” Men of the Union! see to it, That aye, 'mid joy or ruth, Worthy are ye of such a one In constancy and truth. Constant since boyhood's day he strives to serve Wherever Duty calls him, and to nerve His soul to truth. At first a sailor's life Is his, with many a pleasant change how rife! But soon, he finds his duty just as sweet In changeless circuits of a London “beat.” When war's fierce stormcloud bursts, how suddenly! To him there comes once more the call to sea. Then, ever brave, he leaves his much-loved home To fight for Britain on the northern foam. One day on him there dawns a sense of harm, He knows not why,—a subtle, vague alarm, Though, like young Nelson, “never saw” he “Fear,” His inmost soul is thrilled by danger near. His is the watch. Eager he scans the deep With eyes all vigilant, and sees, up-creep A periscope. It is! it is the foe! 'Tis instant now to strike ere yet below The dread torpedo speeds. He fires his gun, And saves his ship. What then? What he has done He lacks an order for, so speedily Behold him made a prisoner, but when he At length, hath justice, gone is dire disgrace, His mates are called, and, now, before his face, He hears himself high praised, and, for the rest, The D.S.M. he wears upon his breast. But, ah! the gallant hearts foredoomed to die! One day a seeming merchantman drew nigh His ship, the “Alcantara,” which was sent To search for contraband. Swiftly she went Towards the stranger. See! she lowers a boat To take the searchers. Scarce is that a-float (Dundas is in her) than all suddenly False bulwarks dropt are by the enemy, A broadside, winged with death, booms o'er the wave, Striking the boat, and slaying all the brave Therein. Dundas's torch of life is out! But puissant Death can never put to rout Courage like his. It lives from age to age, A glorious, mighty, deathless heritage. Britain shall live long as her sons can say “Our mother still exults in ‘heroes of to-day.’” Men of the Union! see to it, That aye, 'mid joy or ruth, Worthy are ye of such a one In constancy and truth. Easter Monday, April 24, 1916. OUR BROTHERS AT THE FRONT The Brotherhood Federation was much cheered by hearing of Brotherhood gatherings in the trenches, and the following hymn was written by me in response to a special request for a hymn which could be sung both at the meetings at home, and at those in the trenches, and be one more proof to our brothers at the front that they are all, ever and always, in our loving memory. Of set purpose I used the familiar common metre so that the words would lend themselves to many tunes long much loved, and at the Brotherhood connected with the Marylebone Presbyterian Church, London, “Belmont” has been employed, Sunday by Sunday, for several months with marked acceptance. Our hearts are with you all the week, But must when Sunday comes While musing, in our homes at peace, On you, where roll the drums. And when, on Sunday afternoon, We see your vacant place, We were not brothers did not gloom Fall on our hearts a space. Yet you and we, on shore or sea, By faith can surely meet, And re-unite our sundered souls, Before the mercy-seat. There shall we greet you, soul by soul, There shall we watch and pray, There shall we keep our courage up, Till dawns the happy day Soon, soon, it cannot be too soon, When, home from sea or shore, With joy that war at last is o'er With you we meet once more. AT SANTA CRUZ DE TENERIFE. Whatever view may be taken about War, and, personally I agree with Tolstoi both as to its horror and its inherent futility, nothing but contempt ought to be felt for the smug hyprocrisy which would condemn selfless courage, even if, sometimes, mistaken. Very early in life I stayed at this most interesting spot, during what I thought, then, to be the permanent ascendency of “The Manchester School” as it was called, or “the peace-at-any-price party,” and wrote the stanzas which follow:— When war is gone, our people say The heroes of the war were wrong— That they who formed our Britain's sway, And made her Empire firm and strong, Were callous cut-throats nothing less, Who joyed in war for slaughter's sake; Who yearned to banish happiness; Who loved with blood their thirst to slake. But I, with swelling heart, to-day Land on this shore, which years ago Saw from its crag-encircled bay Our Nelson's only overthrow, And ask, do those who grub and prose, And by their lights our heroes try, Perform their life-tasks more than those Whose task is but “to do or die”? A VETERAN OF 1870. (In the Basse Plante, Pau, France.) A regiment's band stands up to play Within a sheltered wood, To make its friends and strangers gay, And please them, if it could. It plays full many a soldier's air, Now tender, low, and sweet, Now surely meant to banish care, With martial fire replete— Telling of conquest and renown, With scarce a note of pain, Of trophies ta'en, of arms laid down, Of heroes home again. Smart citizens on every side, Are pacing up and down, And “ladies fair,” with graceful pride, Show each to each their gown. Yet see I a poor cripple lean Against an agèd tree, I see his thread-bare blouse is clean, Despite his poverty. Once had he borne a soldier's part, Had learnt how to endure, God grant him still the steadfast heart; For him there is no cure. Would he but speak? What does he think Of the fierce joys of war? Would he now—gaily near their brink, Or shun them evermore? THE CHARGE. (A real incident.) “I believe in the next world, and, do all I can not to send my patients into it, drunk.” The actual remark of an experienced physician. “About six o'clock every man was given a glass of rum to drink the King's health and success to our attack.” From an article, printed in a weekly newspaper, written by one who was present. Whatever view may be held as to the taking of alcohol in normal circumstances, few, one would suppose, would justify, on moral grounds, its being served out, neat, just before deadly combat, to men, mostly young, and many of whom are, unfortunately, totally unacquainted with its effects. 1st Soldier. And is it thus we slay? I will not drink. [Pours out the contents.] An Officer. Righteous, say they, the war is. So it is! Then why degrade the splendid trade of war By usage like to this? Surely the race Who fought, and bled, and won, at Waterloo, And many a hard-fought field before and since, Are not the cravens basely thus to need “Dutch courage.” A colour-sergeant of the swash-buckler variety, (gulping down his liquor.) “See! what come of all the cant Of ‘temperance’ to win the war, when now Rum, and such rum! is given to make us fight. “GOOD-BYE, OLD MAN.” (An actual occurrence.) A battery of Field Artillery is ordered into action with a call of extreme urgency. As it advances at the gallop the favourite horse of one of the gunners is wounded mortally, and falls, helpless, on the ground. Instinctively, almost involuntarily, and quick as lightning, the soldier who loves it leaps from his limber and rushes to its help. Disentangling the harness, and unloosing the collar, he relieves somewhat its sufferings. Then he encircles the poor head, with its piteous eyes, in his affectionate arms; and, kissing the forehead, exclaims, “Good-bye, old man.” At the same instant, a ruined cottage, ten yards to the left, is struck by a shell, whose bursting fragments illumine the sky and air, and a sergeant, observing his absence, though already far ahead, beckons him, imperatively, to rejoin. Good-bye, Old Man, I seem to see The meadow where, how quietly, You grazed, at first, a happy foal Harmless in happiness. The whole Green country-side had scarce another Creature more joyous—gladsome brother To streams, and winds, and soaring-birds. Then, later, would that halting words Of mine could paint my Nellie's ride With laughing eyes, and legs a-stride, Her first ride on your friendly back. E'en now I see yon woodland track, Soft with the fallen russet leaves. Alack! alack! my poor heart grieves To quit you, tortured. By what right Are you made victim in a fight It is not yours to comprehend? Yea; men are hard; some day, good friend, May we judge differently; and think; May we judge differently; and shrink, From torture given without appeal. For me, I know not; yet can feel. Good-bye, Old Man, may Death come soon For you, I crave that only boon,— And, yet, another would I seek; May no dog scent, afar, your sleek And well-kept flesh before you die, Lest he, with hungry eyes, draw nigh, And, with his hot and famished breath, Pollute you in the pangs of death. Fourth Series [Marylebone Presbyterian Church, Home Sunday School, Christmas Carol Service, Sunday, December 23rd, 1917, at 3.15 p.m.] CHRISTMAS IN THE TRENCHES AND AT HOME. The famous hymn “There came upon the midnight clear,” sung at a Parade Service in the Trenches brings visions of Home. “There came upon the midnight clear The glorious song of old”— The words brought to a soldier's eyes, His lad, amid the cold: Ay, gloom and cold had passed away When now, how suddenly, He saw his little girl at prayer Beside her mother's knee. The famous hymn, sung at a Children's Service, brings visions of the Trenches. “There came upon the midnight clear The glorious song of old”— The words brought to that lad's kind eyes His father, 'mid the cold— The words brought to that daughter's heart A true, if child-like prayer That God, the Father of us all, Would keep him safe while there. O Christ, who looks upon Thy earth! Which once Thou foundest “good,” Cleanse Thou our eyes that we may see, Restrain each savage mood— Cleanse Thou our eyes that we may see— Restrain from foolish fear,— So, all Thy children, young and old, May know that Thou art near. December, 1917. HOW WE REWARD OUR HEROES. (A true story of personal experience). A crippled soldier speaks. [Written at the request of my friend, Mr. Charles Vernon, for March 4th, 1918, and recited by him]. Keen is the wind, although the sun is bright, But where's the sun for me! It seems the day On which I won my Lucy. As we walked Home from the village church life was a-glow With love, and health, and peace. Then comes this war, And I am forced to go, leaving behind My wife and babes—to face the world alone. Soon am I wounded—feel the stinging pain And swoon. When consciousness comes back to me Maimed am I all my days. Soon am I told No longer am I needed—that a pittance Is graciously bestowed, but at the pleasure Of those above me. Stand I here, ay, here, Craving mutely for alms. I who have given More than my life to keep my Britain free! Yon carriage splashes me! My betters say Not by their words, but by their deeds, 'tis right That I endure in silence! Yet my lord Who drives, had not been here this afternoon In splendour and in comfort, were it not For me and such as me;—yon gay, young lady Who walks erstwhile, caressing her pet dog, Looks on me coldly! Then, like to the man, Of whom the Bible, in its candour, speaks, Passes upon the other side! Well! Well! I'd rather face the hail of hostile bullets! Death would I rather face, than life! if life Brings me such cruelty, such bitter scorn! TRAFALGAR. Written in 1913 at the request of my friend, Mr. William Miles, and given by him at his recitals. It is a fortunate circumstance, even for the imperishable and world-wide renown of Nelson, that it is enshrined in two such masterpieces of English prose as the Lives by Robert Southey, and by Admiral Mahan, of the American Navy. If the advisability of allusion in this ballad to certain incidents in Nelson's career be questioned, it may, at least, be said, that such allusions are an inseparable part of both the biographies aforenamed, right up to the very end. The metaphor of the “feet of clay” in one of the stanzas is taken from a Biblical passage (the book of Daniel, chapter ii. verse 33). The phrases “Nelson,—the faithful sailor's friend,” and “Nelson, the just, and kind,” are no mere generalities. The touching anecdote respecting the “faithful sailor” can be read in the second volume of Admiral Mahan's work, page 360; and why Nelson was “just” and “kind,” i.e. humane, is set forth at pages 374 and 381 of the same narrative. Owing to Nelson's battle-scheme, the British ships had to come close to their enemies before they were allowed to reply to their cannonade. In reference to the line “Bold Hardy come again” it may be said that the epithet “Bold” is used advisedly, as no other epithet adequately describes Flag-Captain Hardy from the time of Nelson receiving his death-wound to that Admiral's death. For it must be recollected that he would not relinquish the command to Vice-Admiral Collingwood, and his conduct placed Hardy in much difficulty. Hardy visited twice his striken commander and life-long friend lying in the cockpit of his flagship, and it was on the latter occasion that the pathetic occurrence mentioned took place. In my opinion it is a striking testimony to the unity of America and Great Britain in essentials, that Nelson's most satisfying biographer should be a distinguished American officer. For, great as are the merits of Southey, he has not the fulness of detail, or of accuracy, possessed by Admiral Mahan. The latter has not only the immeasurable advantage of writing in the temper of a later age, when evidence could be more readily and more convincingly sifted, but has, also, much wider knowledge. In very early life I knew intimately the son of a man who had served under Nelson during his last seven years, and, consequently, had been in the Victory at Trafalgar. I was never weary of the old man's stories, and for this, and other reasons, have always taken a deep interest in the events, memorable or otherwise, of the first Napoleonic period. Why do we dream of Nelson still? Why dream of Trafalgar? Swift moves the world; and oftentimes Dim seem these days afar. No longer have we “wooden walls,” Seldom we plough the seas, With roods of sail,—nor are we now The slaves of every breeze. Is it because our British tars Are staunch,—yea, staunch as then; Such are they. But that is not why We dream, and dream again. Is it because for us they died? For us that there they bled? Is it because for Britain's might High poop and deck ran red? Is it because our Nelson's fame Never shall pass away? And yet, methinks, we see him now With “feet” of common “clay.” “Enough! enough!” here one exclaims, “Why Nelson's fame assail?” “Enough!” would we reply, “his Judge Shall see the right prevail.” What'er his faults, where'er his face And war-worn form were seen, 'Twas as if Bravery's very self Had donned man's garb and mien. Britons will dream of Trafalgar Oft as they call to mind Nelson,—the faithful sailor's friend— Nelson, the just and kind. Perchance, some day (may it be soon!), Grim War at last may cease, And trumpets sound, but to proclaim The halcyon years of peace. Yet while, in human life, abides Some unredeeméd wrong,— While matchless courage still we love, Or theme of stirring song— Still shall we see him hurl his fleet Nigher, and yet more nigh Towards the foe's relentless fire, Silent—without reply. Yea,—almost feel—oh, fearful pause! These forty moments flee. The Victory fires not:—and her men Perish—all silently! Still shall we hear his deathless words Of praise, which tell us how, Never before, in all his fights, His men face Death as now. Yea—almost—shall our deafened ears Hear that appalling roar,— His ships first broadside—almost see Him fall, to rise no more. Still see (as though before our eyes), Amid his cruel pain, His care for others:—almost see Bold Hardy come again And touch his chieftain's ghastly brow, And kiss his pallid cheek, With touch, as soft as woman's touch, Too tender to be weak. Still shall we see, with inner sight, Across the sunset wave, The battle won; and then at length, The burial of the brave.</field>
