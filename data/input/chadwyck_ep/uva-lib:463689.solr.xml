      <field name="fulltext">The Pleasure of the firste dayes Pastyme. [If thundring threates of mightie Ioue aboue] If thundring threates of mightie Ioue aboue, If monstrous shapes from God among vs sente, If bitter plagues, whereof we dayly proue, Had power to make mankynde his lyfe repent, Man shoulde not neede to feare the fleying whip, VVhiche dothe for sinne his guiltie conscience nip. The rodde wherewith the Lorde doth scourge vs still, The promised plagues of vengeance in his ire, Is to enforce man to obey his wyll, And shunne the debt of his deserued hire. The louing Lorde dothe warne vs day by day, Yet we rebell, and lust to runne astray. Eche fishe that swimmes, eche foule that buildes a nest, Eche blooming plante, eche hearbe, and fruitfull tree, Eche creping worme, and euery liuing beaste, Brings forth encrease, eche one in their degree. They prayse the Lorde according to their kinde, They prayse the Lorde according to their kinde, They liue and dye, as nature hathe assinde. All things on earthe, created by the Lorde, VVere to sustaine the needefull life of man: And man at laste was formed by his worde, And of the earthe, by God possession wanne, Redeemed eke from sinne by Christe his sonne, VVhose Godhead was before the worlde begonne: Be thankfull man, repent, and turne againe, Let not thy sauiours bloude be shed in vaine. The complaint of the ciuill warres of Fraunce. 1 VVhat kinde of newe suspect Doth grudge my broylyng breaste? VVhat griping griefe, or straunge conceite, Bereaues my minde of reste? VVhat horrour new at hande Doth dull my senses so? VVhat slicing blade doth cutte my gale By force of mortall foe? VVhose cruell bloudy pawes, So fiercely me assayles, As still me thinkes, I feele hym teare My hearte with goarye nayles. 2 The flames of Ætna mounte, VVhose smoothers pierce the aire, Consumes not so, as I doe waste, VVith enuy, rage and care, To viewe in euery coaste, The gamisons so thicke, Of brainsicke souldiours, whom the spoiles Of natiue soile doth pticke, And headlong doth enforce, To baine the fieldes in bloode Of countrey soules, without remorse Of Fraunce their mother good. 3 VVith sorrowe I consume, Like snowe againste the Sunne, Mine eies with teares like flowing streames Continually doe runne: My face with ashes foule, My golden tresse is shorne, My hearte in sorrowe closed fast, My pleasant dayes are worne, My pinching pining pangs My penne shall nowe disclose, The worlde shal knowe my driery playntes The cause of these my vvoes. 4 My sadde and pensiue song. Runne with dispersed lockes: Proclayme my griefe in dolefull tunes, Among the woodes and rockes Goe cladde in mourners weede, Trusse vp thy garmentes rounde, Hye to the Mountes of Apennine. Doe there my verses sounde. VVhere Arno floudes, and Po, VVith Eccho may reporte My sighes, my sobbes, and harde mishap, To suche as there resorte. 5 Tell them the Frenchmen they, VVho by their valiant might, So oftentymes in fierce conflictes Their armies put to flighte, Nowe doubte and feare themselues, Nowe doe they seeke no more Reuenge of wrong receyude, they seeks To salue their present sore. Tell Italy alas, That Milan neede not feare, But liue in peace with Naples nowe, That Fraunce is in dispaire. 6 Tell Germany la bas, VVhere Mos the running flood, Doth leade his course by mount &amp; rocke, Through many a dale and wood VVhose people taught to crouche, By force of our assaultes, Constraynde to flee their walled Townes, And hide themselues in vaultes: VVishe them and those that holde The fruitfull bankes of Rhine, Like brethren now to length our liues, VVith some reliefe in tyme. 7 You Europe Princes all, VVhiche sometime sought for peace, Thereby to staye the Frenchmens force Their kingdome to encreace, VVhome you with all your power, Coulde not in forrayne soyle Resiste, afflicted nowe you seeke Like carion crowes to spoile: Not one is absent nowe, The carkasse to deuoure, VVhose fleshe then in your greedy mawes Had made your sauce but sowre. 8 Thus is the Lion stoute, VVhome euery beaste did feare, Assailed nowe, and marched on Of euery trembling hare. Oh Fraunce, whose mightie power, And famous highe renoume, Surmounted for hir valiantnesse Eche country king and towne, VVhat dire mishap more harde, VVhat more vnhappy ende, Coulde fortune frame, than force perforce Thy fame to ruine sende. 9 Must needes thy fatall blade, Not hauing whome to kill, Againste thy selfe his bloudy rage In fury worke his will? As noble Romaines did, The conquerours of all, VVho after thousand battels wonne Did worke their fatall fall, VVhen rancor taking roote, Their mightie hande did arme Against themselues, to rue the liues They shoulde haue kept from harme. 10 As he that hath the goute, Doth dayly wishe for death, Or he that into dropsie falles, VVoulde stop his vitall breath: Or as the man that liues In painefull pangs, doth crie And call for death, to end his griefe, And yet hee can not die, But takes some poysned drugge At laste to ende his life: So Fraunce by murthering man and child VVoulde ende our cankred strife. 11 The roaring Lion fierce, Or furious Leoperds rage, VVith no suche frensie trackes they pray Their hunger to asswage: Nor Tigre dothe pursue More greedely, the thiefe That steales hir yong, or faster packes To giue hir whelpes reliefe, Than doth our scattered troupes, In armes with fury fraughte, Againste themselues suche slaughter make As bringeth all to naught. 12 The fieldes are bathed in the bloud, Euen of their children deare, And churchyards now of common groundes Doe euery where appeare: And cankred spighte hath wrought By heapes of bodies dead, That frothye ryuers whyte as mylke Are dyed scarlet redde. Thus eche man vrged on By madde reuenging moodes, Lyke franticke fooles do quite forget The losse of wife and goodes. 13 The father dothe not spare, To bathe his bloudy knife, VVithin the bowels of the babe That by himselfe had lyfe: The childe nowe growne a man, Cuttes off his syers head, And dothe reioice with mery moode To see his father deade: The brother feares his ende, Leaste brother do aduaunce, Thus all estates to ruine runne, Throughout the realme of Fraunce. 14 The mischiefe wrought by men, The battering Cannons shotte, Destroyeth castels, fortes, and townes, That valiant Princes gotte. The auncient myghtie walles, VVhere stately Cities stoode, Lies flatte and beaten to the earth, Imbrude in Burgers bloode. The wealth we wallowed in Before our wofull wracke, Conuerted is by country foes, To pillage, spoyle, and sacke. 15 The reuerend aged sires Obeye these lawlesse mates, VVho lyke vnbridled Helhoundes, beare Of men the onely shapes: They dayly seeke to haue The vvealth man can not giue, So they do get, they do not force Howe hardly others lyue. The olde distressed dames Doe rende their grisly heare, To see the maydes by bloudy beastes, Defloured euery where. 16 Oh tiranny vniuste, Oh crueltie vnkinde, My heare with horrour stands on end, In vttering of my minde: You people neyghbours nere, Yet farre from any blowe, Bewaile the state of our decay, Lament our ouerthrowe. And though our ship do sincke In viewe of you on shore, Let not the storme that works our wracke, Make you reioice the more. 17 Quake at our hard mishap, Least you befall the like, For where the blind doth leade the blinde, Bothe fall into the dyke. Your kindled neighbours house, May cause you feare youre owne: VVho dreades no harme that maye ensue, Is soonest ouerthrowne. VVherfore consider freendes, That yet liue in delyghtes, How Dogs and Rauens your fathers flesh, Deuoured in your syghtes. 18 Alas, shal euermore Our woes engraued lye, VVith sighes, in brasse and marble stone, The bookes of memorie: VVherein discyphred bee The discordes and the death Of many a noble valiant wight, Too soone bereft of breath Their wydowes mournefull plaintes, Theyr orphanes dolefull teares, VVith cryes of poore exiled soules, Apparantly appeares. 19 There may you viewe with feare, Howe daungerous a thing Ill councell is in tender yeares, To ouerthrow a king. The seas be calme and smoothe VVe dayly see by kynde, No billowe mountes, but by the force Of boysterous stormye wynde. So royall Princes loue, To lyue where vertue is, If Sycophantes or Parasites Enformde them not amisse. 20 Our realme had happie bene, Thou Prince to vertue borne, If that by thy too lyght beleefe, Thy subiects now forlorne, Had neuer felte thy powre VVith sworde and Cannon shot, VVhereby our lande destroyed lies, And famous Fraunce forgot, Yea thy renoume and fame Is buried with the reste, Of Castels, Townes, and battered fortes, VVhiche once a king possest. A welcome of Peace into Fraunce. 1 Oh puissant Ioue on high, VVhat pleasaunt Musicke rare, Dothe fill my senses with delightes Proceeding from the ayre? I feele my daselde eies, By leamings lose their light, VVhich farre excell the Sunny beames Or glary morning brighte: The sounde of straunge Consorts, Contents my listening eare, More gallant heauenly harmony On earth may no man heare. 2 I see out of the cloudes, A Virgin doth decline, In Sattyn clad, as white as swan VVith maiestie diuine: Vpon hir heade she beares, A garlande like the grasse, Of Laurell tree, in hewe this Nimph: Dame beauty doth surpasse: Hir countenaunce presents The glorie of the Lorde, In hand she holdes an Olyue braunche, The ensigne of Accorde. 3 But as I doe suppose, This Princesse I do know, VVho nowe forsakes the Heauens aboue, To visite vs belowe: Tis Peace, tis euen the same, VVhome our incessant cries, By earnest sute hath called downe Euen from the starry Skies: VVhere she (O noble dame) Constrained was to flye, And keepe hir close, to shunne the force Of VVrath and Tiranny. 4 From whence she did beholde The bloudy furious flame, VVherin all Fraunce consumed is, To our eternall shame: Howe Discorde hatched first The fire of all our feares, Then viewyng our vnhappie state, She shed moste bitter teares: And dyd bewayle our want Of Peace, exilde by spight, Lamenting with a heauie heart, Our sorrowes daye and night. 5 In this our deepe distresse, VVe praide with one consent, Entreating Faithe to be our friende To God omnipotent. He did present our sute, To Christe the virgins sonne, The mediatour of mankinde, By whome our sute was wonne: VVherein we did beseeche, Almightie God to cease His plagues deserued for our sinne, And graunt to vs his peace. 6 Our prayer being hearde By him that seeth all, Presented by his onely sonne, Didde graunt his grace, and calde Necessitie in haste, And did dispatche wyth speede, From Heauen to Earth the Angell rude, To aide vs at our neede: VVhose force and power is suche, Once being out of bande, As nothing liuing in the world Can shunne hys mightie hande. 7 Thou Angell (saide the Lord) Giue eare, this is my minde, Do thou my will vpon the earth, As duty doth thee binde: Goe downe into the worlde, I giue thee perfecte power, To apprehende that bloudy VVarre, VVho doth my flocke deuoure: Abate his cruell pride, And see thou cheyne hym well, Imprison hym in Limbo lake, Among the fiendes of hell. 8 This chardge pronounced, Ioue Did glaunce his eie aside, And did espie the virgin peace, VVho waited but hir tyde: My daughter deare (quoth hee) That haste thy dwelling place Among my Saintes and blessed traine, VVith speede goe shewe thy face, Vnto the toiled troupes, That for thy absence mourne, Plante amitie, and pittie them, That VVarre hath quite forlorne. 9 The Angell and the Maide, No sooner knewe the will Of Ioue, but downe they driue amaine, His pleasure to fulfill, Like as the Arrowe shotte Out of a mightie bowe, From heauen to earth, these messengers Themselues more swiftly throwe: Auoide you souldiers nowe, Oure comforte is in place, Nowe Murther, Theft, and Treason hide Your shamelesse cruell face. 10 Oure happy dayes approche, Oure ioy shall nowe abounde, And peace shall giue vs precious oyle To heale oure mortall wounde: She bringeth Charitie, VVith Concorde, Faith, and Loue, Companions sente for oure reliefe From mightie Ioue aboue: VVith garlandes crowned all Of moste immortall fame, Giue laude therfore with one accorde To hys eternall name. 11 Delay no tyme (oh Fraunce) Be gladde and now reioice, Praise him on high, that hath giuen eare, To thy lamenting voice: Let vs (O people) kneele Before the Lorde of might, And humbly thanke him, sith we finde Suche fauour in his sight, As pleaseth him to sende These Nimphes of heauenly race, To ease our griefe, release our woe, And all our foes deface. 12 Peace hated of the ill, Of God the darling deare, VVe celebrate thy name (O Peace) In Fraunce with mery cheare: Thy Altar will we builde, And sacrifice will make To thee, of Furie and Disdayne, VVhiche thou doste from vs take. By Heraulds shall thy praise Be blasde in riche aray, And Trumpets shall thy fame resounde, VVhich neuer shall decay. 13 Our weale do the ryse by thee, For thou by thy puissance, Compellest Fraunce to knowe hir king, And hym to knowe his Fraunce: By thee, the Henries three, To pleasure chaunge their rage, And doth allie their loue anew Vnto their parentage. All bloudy combates cease, All malice doth assuage. Triumphes approche to beautifie A noble mariage. 14 All garnisons departe Our Cities by thy stroke, VVho didde oppresse our Citizen, By force of seruile yoke. Our fieldes are cleere by thee, From all the wicked traine, That haue destroyde our country wealth, And all oure tillmen slaine: VVho to excuse the crime, VVherein they dayly sinne, Alleage the deede that they haue done, Theyr leaders did beginne. 15 By thee the aged man, Shall see his faithfull wyfe, To whome with teares she will vnfolde Hir wearye passed lyfe, And tell what care of mynde His absence did pvoure, VVhat feare and sorrow day and night For hym she did endure. In recompence of paine, The hoarie headed sire, Renues with looke their auncient ioyes, Reuiued by desire. 16 By thee the Virgins walke The Gardens of delyght, Conducted by their louyng makes, In place of open syght: They trace the pleasant groues, And gather floures sweete, They do appoynte the secrete place Of loue where they muste meete, And sure guages giuen, To keepe the tyme is sette, VVhere wished wedlocke trappeth them VVithin hir ioyfull nette. 17 By thee dame Iustice shall Hir ballance beame redresse, To yelde the wicked their deserte, And aide the comfortlesse. By thee the holy Churche, Shall praye bothe day and nighte, And preache the God of heauen to bee The king of powre and might. The merchaunt shall by thee Applye his Traffike so, As Tauernes shall not him compell His profyte to foreslowe, 18 By thee the pesant poore, VVith trauayle shall begin To sowe, to plante, and till the lande, That long hath barreyn bin, His Corselet of proofe Shall stande hym nowe in steede Vppon a poll to fraye the birdes, That doe destroye his seede: His Morion of defence He vsed for his hatte, Shal serue his wife to put in corne To make his pulleyn fatte. 19 Thou Peace the springing well Of euery happy thing, I can not speake, ne yet conceale The goodnesse thou dost bring: Thou doest reioyce our hearts VVith presence of thy syght, More than the risyng of the Sunne Doth ioye eche earthly wight. VVhose golden glittring beames Dothe chase and put to flighte Dame Sadnesse, Feare, and Drowsinesse, The daughters of the nyght. 20 Thy merrie moode, oh Peace, Doth cause eche thing to growe, VVhose fruite once yelded, thou agayne The same doste ouerthrowe: Thou doste appease the rage And storme on seas and lande, To mitigate the furious force Of heauen, is in thy hande: All seasons, tymes and tydes In thee accord by kynde, The hydeous tempeste in the ende, By Peace a calme dothe fynde. 21 Thou makest euery bird In tyme to buylde their nest, Thou dost ordeyne in craggye rockes A denne for euery beast. The streames of euerye brooke By thee their force appease, By thee the Gallies rowe with ores, Amid the rolling Seas: In fine, eche gifte of grace Proceeding from aboue, Like hony dewe is powrd on vs By concorde, peace, and loue. 22 Oh blessed lucky houre, O happy wished daye, VVherein dissention and despight, By peace are chasde awaye: Goe harbour with the Turke, VVho pufte with pride doth swell, Or packe you to your auncient denne VVith Pluto god of hell. If you on earth will bide To Persia hye with speede, Or Cacebas, whose enuious mindes Your cankerd counsell neede. 23 The realme of Fraunc hathe sworne That peace shall be their stay, To whome their hand and harts be giuen For euer to obey: And haue decreed all, That who so breakes his vowe In lewe of his disloyaltie, Shall hang vpon a bough. And he that seemes to lodge Ambition in his minde, The same rewarde, that Amon had, For his deserte shall finde. 24 If any wretche there be, That dare presume to stande Against our crowne and soueraigne peace, VVith force of armed hande. VVe feruently beseeche The thundring God of myght, That all the plagues of heauen and earth Vppon the wretche maye lyght, That furye freate his gall, His payne may neuer cease, Ne fynde no friende in his distresse, That may his woe release.</field>

[VVhat moueth men abashed thus to stay] VVhat moueth men abashed thus to stay, As tumbled from the cloude, in such a mase?

Bereaue them of their outwarde masking vayle Yet inwardly disguised they remayne: Their thoughtes lye hidde, their tounges of truth do fayle, Till sugred wordes the harmlesse hart hath slayne: If in their chaunge they fast on men their hookes, their smiling then conuertes to louring lookes. the ende of the first dayes Sport.</field>

For as the tickell wheele doth glide, and force with beautie wans away: so youth without returne doth slide, and wormes vpon our fleshe shall pray. [VVhy doo the Lillies fade away] VVhy doo the Lillies fade away, and pleasant sentes resigne my graue: Let rather violets freshe and gay, my tender heare enuiron braue. Bring heere to me my loue so faire, to quallifie my pining care, So as before the day when I must leade the daunce among the dead, All sorrowes from my sight may flye, and ioye possesse my troubled head. [Let vs conioyne in nuptiall bedde] Let vs conioyne in nuptiall bedde, Citheria cladde in Roses fyne, VVith Bacchus smiling white and redde, and fraught our heades with drowsie wine: O pleasaunt deawe of flowers Queene, O deawe the fauour of the spring, Deawe deare delight of heauenly eyen, deawe crowning loue in euery thing.

      <field name="fulltext">The third Dayes delight. The louer standing in doubt of good wil writeth this. VVhen Boreas stormy blastes be ouerblown, ech bloming braunch doth sprout their tender buds VVhen whithered leaues fr? okes are ouerthrowen, the liuely greene doth clad the ragged woods, And old Saturnus with his hoary face, at Phebus sight resignes his frosen place. Then doth the sappe ascende from euery roote, and spreadeth through the twigs of euery tree, Dame Nature shewes hir force from head to foote and yeeldes hir treasures most indifferently. The fruitful Vine to spring she doth prouoke, which doth, in ayde, imbrace the sturdy oke. The siluer streames resounde, the pleasant plantes of euery bird that pypes a doleful laie, The floures sweete with gallant coules paintes, the meadowes greene and euery wilsome way, The Nightingale, the Robin, and the thrush, recordes their notes from euery bush to bush. The turtle true, laments hir louer lost, ech foule and beast, doth chose a louing make, And as they like, they liue with slender cost, and whilest they breed al change they quite forsake: Their stedfast staye, and wandring mindes may moue, what loyal heartes we ought to beare in loue. My Lady faire, sith in the pleasant spring, dame Natures nimphes do florish blome and beare: Sith byrde and beast, and euery liuing thing, embraceth loue by kinde, exempt of feare, VVhy should you lodge colde winter in your breaste, to quench the flame that breedeth men vnrest? Display before Sir Phebus melting beames the curtaine of your cruel frosen hart, Droppe down some deawe to comfort mine extremes, let not my death bewraie mine inward smart: So may Cupido qualyfye your rage and you in time my burning heate asswage. Thus must I liue in hope of my desire, graunt grace or else pronounce my fatal dome, Your nay shal heape but coales vppon my fire, say yea, then is my wished houre come, Twixt yea and nay if you indifferent stande, my weary life and death is in your hand. VVil you or not, your seruaunt I remaine, relieue me, else release me of my paine. The seconde Song. VVhat hard mishap doth hamper youth, when cursed Cupid list to frowne. And yet he will not credite truth, til hard mishap doth throw him downe, He hath the power in his distresse. to see what may his smart redresse. Must hoarie heares needes make vs wise dicouering naked treasons hooke? VVhose glittering hue by sleight deuise doth make them blind that theron loke, And til into the trappe they slide, belieue that reason is their guide. If liuing wightes might plainely see, the suttelties of womens wittes, That couered in their bosomes lye hid and disclosde by wily fittes, Then would they shunne the glaring eye, whose burning beames doth cause th? dye. VVhere suters serue with long delay, in dayly hope of some good happe, Tormenting griefes at length doe pay their hiers, with an afterclappe, For such rewardes they dayly finde, that beate a stedfast loyal minde. Behold the guerdon due to loue bestowed on a fickle femme, As good of rotten wood to proue the forging of some pretious gemme. Repentaunce last doth pinch the hart, that loue consumes with bitter smart. Youth bends the net to catch the pray, which some inioy that takes no paine, He toyles, yet seeth euery day his labour wasted al in vaine. He beates the bush, by sugred wordes but other steale away the burdes. Thus to the fine of Louers gaine, is lothsome trauaile for their paine. The thirde Song. Who first dame Venus brabling brat, the blinded god of Loue. VVhere euery God and goddesse sat, did plant his throne aboue. The same vnto all mortall wights with spite did purchase woe, And gaue the place of all delights, vnto our mortall foe. VVho traytour-like with friendly shewe, entraps the warelesse wight, Discharging from his poysned bowe his venomous dart so right, As where it hits, the hart doth wast in flames of quenchlesse fire: First kindled by the gleamings cast from eyes we most desire. Sith then we beare of cruell loue the arrowe and the wounde, VVhich aye renewing he doth proue our senses to confounde: No oyntment, pultesse, salue, ne braunche, can cure the festred sore, Our pinching pangs doo neuer staunche, but grypeth more and more. No pleasaunt flowred medowe gay, nor winding riuers shore, Nor wildsome wood or deserts, may the pining heart restore: From Venus bondage nothing can a greeued mynde set free, To ayde the poore distressed man, no meane but death we see. If we will sayle vpon the seas, Cupido keepes the poupe, And if we hap to ride for ease, he sitteth on the croupe. VVhere so the wofull Louer is, euen there also is he, In bedde the wrangler will not misse his pillowbeare to be. Eche sicknesse or contagious greefe his contrarie doth cure, The Antidote doth yeelde releefe to poysoned creatures sure. Thus eche thing hath a salue to heale their torments and their smartes, VVhen louers must to death appeale, to ease their woful heartes. The Queene of Candies raging lust, at pleasure long possest, And shamefull vse with sire vniust, of Myrrha hir infest: The sister burning in the loue of brother most vnkinde, By the deceitefull brat aboue, release of care dyd finde. But suche as loue in loyall sort, and hope reliefe to finde, VVith them the elfe doth make his sport, he smiles to see them pinde: He seekes to reade them of delight, and breedes them all annoy, It is of all the most despight to trust the lying boy. Make loue who listen angell then, who life may like his wayes, For neyther I, my toung, or pen, will euer yeelde him prayse: And who so doth, shall liue at ease, deuoyde of care and strife, Vnlesse that libertie displease to leade a quiet life. This Loue whom Poets call a God, is but a fury sell, Sent from aboue, a scourging rod, out of the pitte of hell, To martyre and to put to payne all poore afflicted wights, But wise are they that can refrayne this Helhoundes hellishe slights. [VVhat cruell and immortall strife] VVhat cruell and immortall strife deserues the faithlesse wight, Sith that the faythfull louers life doth tast eche worldly spight? An hundred times a day I craue, my heart with sorrowes fraught, VVere ground to dust, or in my graue by wormes consumde to naught. But as the Salamander ioyes amid the burning fire, So doth my heart byde all annoys, in flames of my desires. The winde and rayne which from my soule by teares and sighes do flye, At once doth light and dead the cole, which makes me liue and dye. I would not shewe my miserie, which I can not conceale, Lest I should force hir cruelly to scorne the woe I feele. At least if any recompence dyd flowe in liew of payne, I would support with patience my woe in hope of gayne. But suffer while that life doth last, and let all torments tosse, VVho so his weerie dayes hath past, may winde vp with the losse. Oh if the goddes had euer will to wreake a Louers wrong, Graunt that she may be sterued still, and kept in bondage strong, By loue of some that in despight will scorne hir loyall hart, That she may taste the small delight I haue possest in smart. And sith she will not when she may for loue yeelde loue agayne, That when she will she may haue nay, and louelesse aye remayne. And in the Dryades Table, this Cenotaph ensuing. Conceiued sith Dame Venus was Vpon the fome of surging Seas, No Swimmer may this water passe, Hir wrathfull spite doth so displease: Leander knewe too soone alas, VVhen feruent Loue did force him seaze The deadely shoare where Hero laye, For salte Seas drownde hym by the waye. [Here loyall Loue with beauty knit] Here loyall Loue with beauty knit Doth make their dayly residence, And as to Louers seemeth fit, hath here moste perfecte aliaunce: But cruell death alas did meete this Ladye for hir recompence. VVhen with hir eye she did beholde hir louer dead on grauell colde. [Thou passenger, one harte, one minde] Thou passenger, one harte, one minde, two bodies did embrace: VVhose bones one stone is here assinde to couer this place. [The apple of the goddesse fair] The apple of the goddesse fair, The riche, diuine, rewarde, the liuely broud did kindle clear VVhich burnt Troy not afearde. But vnderneath this polisht stone, this fruite by fatall chaunce, Placde two the perfectst fri?ds in one Of Italy and France. The end of the third dayes sport.</field>

      <field name="fulltext">The pleasure of the fift dayes pastime. In the White hande. If she descende of Noble race, A Goddesse porte hir minde doth craue: If that hir Line be poore and base, No lesse aduauncement would she haue. The yll adorned beautie rare, VVith follies fedde that seeke to see, For gorgeous gaye I doo not care, The modest meane contenteth me. I dye to viewe Dame Chastitie, Acquaynted with simplicitie: The looke that leapes at libertie, Doth hurt my sight exceedingly. Ripe yeres in league with amitie, Yeeldes euer most fertilitie: But youthfulnesse vndoubtedly, Doth lodge delightfull iolitie: I loue the lustie and the lame, The olde ne yong I not despise: Of fayre and foule I doe the same, The foolishe please me like the wise. The lauishe toung and silent wight, The smiling cheare and pleasaunt voyce, Doth yeelde my minde alyke delight, And make my heart alyke reioyce. But to be breefe, my flitting loue Doth flye and followe euery chase, Yet nothing can my fancie moue, To stoppe or stay in any place. In the Blacke hand. The great Estates doo most abounde In ydlenesse and lawlesse life: Among the meanest sort is founde As yll or worse, in mayde and wife. The brauest force the wise to mourn, In viewe of their lasciuious trade, The simple shamelesly do scorne Good warnings by the sages made: The Virgins gallant glauncing eie, Bewrayes hir secreate wanton minde, And Loue in age doth verifie, A barraine stocke by course of kinde: The fruite is sower being greene, And yeeldes a sharpe vnpleasaunt taste, Thus ripe and rotten both are seene, To cloy the stomacke firste and laste: I hate the fatte, I hate the leane, I hate the faire, and eke the foule, The redde, the blacke, the pale and greene I hate, as birdes do hate the Owle: The liuely louing lookes I hate, I hate the simple foolish face, The forced laughter, and the mate, That frames hir song with whoorishe grace, Their fond delights and lewde offence, I haue so fiercely in disdaine, As doubt do the daunte my conscience, To thinke where women doe remaine.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The fifth Historie. [Dame Beautie pearelesse wight] 1 Dame Beautie pearelesse wight, the mother of my greefe, Sith thou in suche dispight disdaynest my releefe: 2 I doo repent me sore I so pursude thy grace, I will doe so no more, Ile hunt an other chase. 3 I will go arme me sure agaynst that glaring eye, VVhose smiling gleames procure the meanes to make me dye. 4 Yea I will stoppe mine eare agaynst the sayned speache, VVhose suttle sound I feare, will be my mortall leache. 5 Ile shunne the curled locks, which in a Net of golde, Hath meshed me with mocks, that make my hart full colde. 6 The snowishe Lilly brest, full fraught with louely lore, Shall lose of me a guest, I will byde scorne no more. 7 But will renounce the sight that drownes me in desire, And boyles me day and night in flames of quenchlesse fire. 8 And henceforth search the way, to liue in libertie: VVill works to voyde delay, but loue will not agree. [The fierie skies doe not at all times flame] The fierie skies doe not at all times flame The thunder threats not still the earth belowe, Nor Ycie frost doth alwayes bruse the same, Not euery houre colde blustering blasts do blowe: Dissentious seas, holde not continuall strife, Ne dunker night, doth alwaies shade oure life. But my debates for euermore and aye, My passions eke approue your force and might, Batter to earthe this iellous wall I saye, That lockes from me my treasure and delight, I thinke my ioyes and harte consumde with mone, For aye shall lodge within this rocke of stone. Like vnto me I viewe no louer pine, VVith happy ioy they all do ende their paine: Yet loue I more than they thy face diuine, VVithin whose hearte no pittie doth remaine, My maistresse is more mercilesse and nice, Than thunder, nighte, the sea, the winde, or yce. [No forte or castell builte by force to feare the foe] No forte or castell builte by force to feare the foe, No welth that surging seas do yeld by sayling, won with wo, No garden of delight compilde by cunning hande, No precious iewels to be found by serch in Leuant sande. No sumptuous dainty feastes of rich and puisant kings, No pastymes with companyons, that companie oft brings, No merie table talke, no Histories of fame, No perfumes of Arabia, that Fœlix men do name. No ioy in meddow walkes, no shade of wildesome wooddes, No melody of chaunting birdes, that chirpe with mery moodes, No whispering water course, of siluer shallowe becke, No fragrante fruites, that Sommer dothe with Autumns riping decke, Nor all the worldly wealth, that radiant sunne doth see Are of such price, as any heare of my deare Dame to mee. [I did requyre of late this onely boune of Loue] I did requyre of late this onely boune of Loue, For recompence of al my paine, my slender sute to moue, And that he woulde vouchsafe, for comforte of my woe, I might but licke the sugred lips, fr? wh?ce my grief did floe, My sute was graunted soone, to take it passing by, Oh luckelesse daye, wherein, I did enioye suche amitie, For then mine eies deprivde, of power to see their weale, Enuide my mouth possessing then his sweet contented heale: Loue, thou haste nothing done, to cheare my pensiue minde, Thy former gifts within me breeds, an other war I finde, VVhiche forceth me alas, to enuy mine estate, That I shoulde be enforste by thee to curse my crooked fate. Sith then one dainty bit, cannot two gluttons fill, I pray thee Loue, haue some remorse, vnlesse thou wilt mee And either take againe, my first possessed parte, Or giue me more, that better may, cont?t my faithful hart kill: [The daily lampe, that I ames amid the Christall spheare] The whole troupe of yong men and maidens togither. The daily lampe, that I ames amid the Christall spheare, And round about the rolling globe, his glaring beames doth beare, Surrenders vp his roomth, and dothe resigne the skie, To thousande thousandes fierie lights, that dimmes eche drowsie eie, And irkesome ougly night, doth spreade his darkesome wings, And of Argentine Luna she, the haruest horses brings. I see the scorching sunne in Seas to plunge from farre, And after him pursueth neare, the blasing sheppardes starre: Proceede then lustie youthes, let ioy beare all the swaye, And honoure Hymen at this feaste, and blesse this wedding daye. The Yong men. O famous splendant starre by Cupid stayde aboue, The pressed slaue at all assayes, and messenger of Loue, Haste, haste thy wonted pace, and poure downe pleasaunte sleepe, To qu?ch the furious frying flames, that makes our bridegrom wepe. Thou glorious starre, of whome dame Venus made hir choice, For witnesse of hir plesaunte sports wherin hir thralles reioyce: Make haste with penned course, I praye thee do not staye, But honoure Hymen at thys feaste, and blesse this wedding daye. The Maidens. O starre more fierce than Mars, more cruell and vnkinde, VVhy stealest thou thys ioyfull daye for Virgins aide assignde? And rayste our sister deare, who once among vs dwelt, To yeelde hir thrall to husbandes lawes whereof she neuer felt? And cause this tender Impe forget hir louing Dame, And graunte to beare the seruile yoke which strangely will hir tame, VVhose flower nowe consentes, to wither and decaye, VVhy shoulde we honoure Hymen then, and blesse this wedding day? The Yong men. Euen as wee see the Vine that springeth vp on hye, VVithout a prop to staye his twigs, doth wither waste and dye, And then his barraine boughes, whereon no fruite doth growe, Deserues not of the husbandman the pruning knife to knowe. But if the stubborne Elmes, supporte his tender taunts, Soone shewes his purple in his greene whereof the Tilman vaunts. So she that dothe consume hir age in Virgins life, Hir freshe will fade, but if she yeelde to be a wedded wife, And choose a louing feere, with fruite she shall encrease, VVhich will hir auntient parentes glad, with ioyes that shal not cease, To daunce the preatie babes in satten mantels gaye, Oh honoure Himen at thys feaste, and blesse this wedding daye. The Maidens. Euen as the fragrante rose, the hostesse of the Flye, Yong maydes delight, and yong mens ioye the pleasure of the eie, So long as it adornes the bushe whereon it blomes, It doth receiue the deawe of Heauen, and fresher still becomes: Put being plucked downe, the hewe doth fade anone, And nought remaineth but the stalke, from whence the rose is gone: So she, that homage dothe vnto the lawes of Loue, Liues vnder yoke of toyle and care, as keeping house dothe proue. Farewell then daintie cheare, all pleasaunte sports adew, Then flee from youthfull company, for feare of priuie viewe, In chimney corner close, she bideth at the baye, VVhy shoulde we honoure Hymen then, or blesse this wedding daye? The yong men. Proceede oh parched spouse in flames of beauties beames, Reuenge thee nowe of cruell Loue, and of his sterne extreames: Triumphe oh happy man, and nowe possesse thy ioy At ease, and quench the coale wherewith Loue did thy hearte annoy. I viewe in open campe, a thousande Cupids flye, In signe of conqueste yeelding bowe, and brondes to scale the skie. All torments hides their heade, that plagde thy pining harte, Contented minde with might, doth make all grisly griefes departe: And where insidious doubtes a thousande pangs did growe, Possession may be pleaded nowe, the same to ouerthrowe. Sith then the fielde is worne and thou at quiet reste, Auay with armoure, speare, and shielde, reioyce among the beste, For victories behoofe, our banners we display, And honoure Hymen at this feaste, and blesse this wedding daye. The Maidens. O Hymen, happy childe of nature, moulde of all, Hymen the brother vnto Loue, to whome all Louers call For comforte in distresse, that by thy puissaunte might They maye enioy their wished will, and haue their hartes delight, Sith that thy pleasure is to trace out of our traine Our sister, and in husbandes armes, so sweetely to retaine, And of hir Virgins state, sith he muste cracke the bande, In recompence of this hir losse, let this hir guerdon stande, Exile from them contempt, and iealousie of brayne, Let sacred loue chaine fast their hearts, and in their minds remayne. And make hir of a mayde, a wife and mother glad, To gouerne well hir familie in wisedomes holy trade: And that eche one of vs in order as they goe, By guage thereof, the surest meane to loue and liue may know, And knowing pleasure is the ende of payne alway, VVe honour Himen at this feast, and blesse this wedding day. A brawle of Poictow. The Louer. So long as I suche fauoure founde, to flowe from my faire Ladies face, As by hir to be vouched bounde, to serue as slaue, hir noble grace, My happy state and settled minde possessed more contented stay, Than any liuing prince may finde, though all the world should him obay. The Lady. So long as of a seruant true, the faithfull guage of loyall Loue Posseste my hart, and I did viewe his seruice soughte his faith to proue, I could not change this weale of mine, nor once reward hym with dispight, To be partaker with a Queene in worldly wealth and al delight. The Louer. But after she had learnde to knowe, by vertue of hir looking glasse, The beautie whiche did worke my woe, and giues me cause to crie alas, I had no power my hope to aide by any meane, when I did viewe Another, whom my maistresse saide, should ioy the loue that was my due. The Lady. But after this vnconstant wretche of other damoysells had a sighte, And sought by many a suttle fetche, to make them owners of my right: Aduaunting he coulde cull his choice, sufficiently to domage me, And with the fairest Dames reioyce, and please his wicked fantasie. The Louer. Beholde what slender confidence remaineth in this slipper kinde, This is the goodly recompence, for seruing long a man shall finde, The loyaller his vsage is, more patiently he suffers paine, The greater torment shall be his, and lesse in fine shal be his gaine. The Lady. Beholde whereto the promise tende of these dissembling liers all, That sweare and stare while life shall ende, to serue their dames at euery call: It is no more, but at their wills to seeke our bodies to abuse, VVhereof they vaunt and scoffe their fills, and finally do vs refuse. The Louer. Therfore right happy shall he bee, and alwayes compted ware and wise, That can their seruile bondage flee, and shunne the snares of loues deuise: Vnhappy was the dismall daye, when firste my lucklesse desteny, Allotted my poore hearte, to praye vpon such cankerde miserie. The Lady. Therefore suche creatures shall be bleste, as can eschue this flaming fire, And quite forbeare to be a gueste vnto this torment of desire. Treade not the trace that I haue gone, you honeste dames that dwell in ioy, Nowe subiecte vnto care and mone vnder the lawe of all annoye. The Louer. But sith that force enforceth me, of force perforce to giue consent To loue and like my libertie, to liue therein I am content: For better (saith the prouerbe) late than neuer, Shunne the baite of bale, VVhiche moues oure wishes to debate, and dayly setteth peace at sale. The Lady. But sith in time I muste prouide, perforce to arme my wofull harte, The cruell pearcing blowes to bide, that Cupid striketh with his darte: The hurte is hard to heale, some saye, that long is kepte from Surgeons cure, VVhiche warneth me to seeke the waye to ease the care that I endure. The Louer. Yet if my cruell carelesse foe with pitifull repentante eie VVould yeelde to me, and to no moe, the happy state of amitie, Then woulde I dye to please hir minde, and aye embrace hir as my wife, My body restlesse shoulde she finde to do hir good, my terme of life. The Lady. Yet if my faithlesse flitting friend, woulde finde a daye to come againe, And do his homage in the ende vnto our loue and aye remaine: I woulde with all my harte repent, that fortune falsed my beheste And if he coulde be so content, my harte shoulde be his place of reste. The Louer. Come then the comforte of my mind come then my solace and my ioye Betweene thy lilly armes come binde our loue thus wronged with annoy: Haste darling deare to salue the sore that long hath soughte to waste my harte, The griefe whereof wil gripe me more, except we kisse ere we departe. The Lady. Come then my life and my desire, my wished spouse and wedded guage, The scorching flames and brainsicke fire, are quenched quite of iealous rage I neuer will recite to thee, the thing that may displease thy mynde, So that thou wilt remaine to mee a carefull husband, and a kinde. The Louer. Faire Dame, let vs performe the summe of al our passed auntient loue, And let vs spende oure life to come, In combate of this warre we proue: Alas when pale and earthly colde doth close vs in our fatall graue, Oure louing flames you maye be bolde, shall lose the heate that louers craue. The Lady. My friend, our gallant youthfulnesse, and foolishe loue will waste awaye, VVhen feeble age our limmes shall presse, and bring our bodies to decaye: But sooner shall the flaming fire Burne in the depth of raging Seas, Then euer we will wante desire, eche others louing minde to please.
