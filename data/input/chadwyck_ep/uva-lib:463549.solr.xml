This Ile auow, (for it is I that said it) If Vertue haue no coine, she has no Credit. TO THE WORTHILIE esteemed the true Character of a Generous disposition, Sir Thomas Gainsford Knight, his Vertues endeered Admiror, wisheth fulnesse of content in the Dedication of these his Anagrams extracted from his Name, and concording with his Nature. Thomas Gainsforde. Anagram So fame doth raign. So Fame doth raigne with Anagram's so fit As if that Nature had inuented it: For he that knowes thy Vertues and thy Name, Will say all raigne in thee, all ring thy Fame. Thomas Gainsford. Anagram Shade t'Honours game. A pale for shelter of her game is made, And thou to Honours game art made a shade, Thy Huntsup's Vertue, and thy Beagle grace, Which (well in winde) hath still the game in chace. To his much honoured and endeered Mecœnas (the expressiu'st Character of a generous Spirit) iudicious approuer of best-meriting Poesie, Guerdoner of Arts, cherisher of Wittes, and serious Protectour of all free-borne Studies, M?. Thomas Posthvmvs Diggs, the Author humbly dedicates himselfe, his Time-suting Epigrams with the vse of his diuinely importing Anagram Anagramma. Thomas Posthumus Digges. Though time passe, God summs. In Anagramma Distichon. How well thy Anagram with truth it runs, Though time pas nere so fast, yet God still sums. Orthus. Hopes issu most dem' gag't. Another Anagram. Two verses including the Anagram. Pvblique and priuate men in young and ag't, on whom most hope is, th? we deem most gagt. Annexed. At you (faire mirrour) aime I; you'r my scope, Much are you gag't vnto your Contries hope. To his BOOKE. Booke whither goes thou, I had rather haue thee To stay still with me, for my Booke may saue me: Saue me, its true, and that's the cause I craue Thou'de to the world, that thou the world might saue; But that's a taske (my booke) too hard for thee, Bid hang the world so that thou wilt saue me: Yet pray thee be aduis'd whom thou dost checke, For speaking truth may chance to break thy necke. Which to preuent, let this be vnderstood, Great men though ill they must be stiled good, Their blacke is white, their vice is vertue made: But 'mongst the base call still a spade a spade; If thou canst thus dispense (my booke) with crimes, Thou shalt be hugg'd and honour'd in these times. The Epistle Dedicatorie. To all Vsurers, Broakers, and Promoters, Sergeants, Catch-poles, and Regraters, Vshers, Panders, Suburbes Traders, Cockneies that haue manie fathers. Ladies, Monkies, Parachitoes, Marmosites, and Catomitoes, Falls, hightires and rebatoes, false-haires, periwigges, monchatoes: graue Gregorians, and Sheepainters. Send I greeting at aduentures, and to all such as be euill, my strappado for the Diuell. TO THE TRVE DISCOUERER of secrets Mounsieur Bacchus, sole Soueraigne of the Iuy-bush, Master-gunner of the pottle-pot ordinance, prime founder of Red lattices, cheerer of the hunger-staru'd Muses, and their thred bare followers, singuler Artist in pewter language, and an obseruant linguist for anon anon Sir. His dere-Canary-Bird, wisheth, red-eyes, dropsie legges, and all other accoutrements befitting. Bottle-nos'd Bacchus with thy bladder face, To thee my Muse comes reeling for a place: And craues thy Patronage; nor do I feare, But my poore fragments shall be made of there, For good reuersions by thy scrambling crew, That belch, and reade, and at each enteruiew Of a sharpe temper'd line, commend the valne, Digest it, and then rift it vp againe; But know thou cup shot god, what is exprest, Within these Pages doe deserue the best Of thy light-headed Shamroes, nor's my tutch For such as loue to take a cup too-much. No, no my lines (though I did seeme to stand, And begge a poore protection at thy hand,) Shall liue in spite of Time, for Time shall see The curtaine of her vices drawne by me; And though portraide by a lesse art-full fist, Yet he that limm'd them is a Satyrist, For th' lines he writes (if ought he write at all) Are drawne by inke that's mixed most with gall. Yea, he was borne, euen from his infancie, To tell the world her shame, and bitterly To taxe those crimes which harbour now and then Within the bosomes of the greatest men. “Yea, nought I doe but I againe will doe it, “Nor ought will write, but I will answer to it: Yet would I not, great Bacchus, haue thee thinke My Muse can into that obliuion sinke, As to become forgetfull so of thee, (For so she might vnthankfull seeme to be) As neuer to record thy worthy Name Since I confesse from thee that spirit came, Which first inspir'd my Muse (by thee exprest) For when she spoke the least, she wrot the best. Yea, thou it was, (and so Ile euer hold,) That quickned me and made me speake more bold; By that rare quintessence drawne from the vine, Or from those fluent Hogges-head pipes of thine. And I doe thanke thee: yet thus much Ile say, For any kindnesse showne me anie waie, By thee, or thy attendants, I may sweare Not any one did euer yet appeare: Nay, I could say (and truly too) far more I neuer ran ten shillings on thy skore, Which may seem strange, that I which am so grown Into acquaintance, and to thee well knowne: “Should in thy booke haue such a diffidence, As not be chalkt for want of ready pence; Nay, there's an other reason I could shew, Which might infer that thou dost duty owe To men of our profession, and its this; (If my conceipt make me not thinke amisse.) Tell me, Where hadst thou Iuie-bush, say where? Which as thine ancient liv'rie thou dost weare; That garland-sure me-thinks that I should know it, From th' Temples sure of some pot-hardy Poet; Who, cause he had not wherewithall to pay, VVas forc't to leaue his Garland, or to stay Till some of's Patrons pittied his estate: But he, poore man, cleere out of hope of that Hauing discust it often in his minde, Did think't more fit to leaue his wreath behinde, Then into such apparant danger fall, And so did vnto one of th' Drawers call To tell thee, if thou would'st be so content, He would engage his Iuie-ornament; Which thou being glad of, for thy priuate vse Wore it thy selfe, and cheat'd the Poet thus. Now doest thou thinke, that we can brooke to haue One of our sort thus iniur'd by a slaue, Without all satisfaction: Bacchus no, Vse't to thy groomes, we'le not be baffelt so. Make restitution of thy bush againe, And lie thy wreath about the Poets braine. Or satisfie his damage in some sort, “Or be thou sure that thou shalt answer for't. But thou wilt lightly weigh such threats as these, And say thou canst bring vs vpon our knees By th' power of thy commaund: true thou canst so, Yet (bleere ey'de Bacchus) I would haue thee know That we do so esteeme thy power and all Thy followers, we'le vent thee 'gainst the wall: Yea euen the kennell shall a witnesse be, Of the small respect which we do beare to thee. Resigne then what thou owest, or forbeare, To taxe our credits when our skore's not cleere. For well may'st thou forbeare both them and me, Since thou dost owe vs more, then we owe thee. Thou know'st it Bacchus (if so thou wilt knowe it) That garland which thou weares, it was a Poet That first empaund it, and thou like a Iewe VVilt not restore to him what is his due. But thou wilt answer (as I know thou may) Yea, I imagine what tis thou canst say: “Bacchus cares not for outward signes a rush, “Good wine needs not the hanging of a bush. Dost not thou vizzard-fac't ingratefull Elfe? Yes, for want of a bush thou'd hang thy selfe. And caper like a zumglian (ô my malice Bursts out against thee) titted vnder the gallowes. For tell me how should men distinguish thee? Thou'lt say by thy fire-sparkling phisnomie, Those wink-apipes of thine, those ferret eies, Those bag-pipe cheeks, those speciall qualities Thou art endew'd with: true by th' first th' art known, But for thy qualities thou hast not one To glory in: for speeches ornament Anon, anon sir:—peutor complement Is all thou canst, and this, thou knowest is such, As th' Iay or Parrat they can doe as much; But I am loath to taxe each crime of thine, For I do know thou lou'st the Muses nine, And they loue thee, yet it is fit their vs'd With more respect, then to be once abus'd By any apron-prentice that thou hast: Yea, fit it is not they should be out-fac't By such vnletterd Animals as these, But reuerence the Muses on their knees, For what be these attend thee, such as lost Their tongue to gaine two or three words at most, As for example neate and briske, and then Anon, anon sir, welcome gentlemen. And is it fit that swads of such desert Should stay the very quintessence of art For a non-payment? or make Sergeants stand In a crosse-lane to laie vnhallowed hand On Albions Mercuries? no, its not fit That Hypocrenes pure riuelings of wit, Should haue their streame with honour doubled) By such base tenter-hooks once troubled. Let this be then amended (and with haste) Lest some of these professors should be plac't, Before thy prohibition come to stay Thy will-for in, they'le hardlie get awaie. But if I heare thee Bacchus after this That thou arrests but any one I wish Thou should'st exempt I will reuenged be Ere many daies, of some of thine or thee. And thanks vnto my Genius (as I craue it) Without inuention further now I haue it. And thus it is: Ile to the Peuterer To make thy quart pots greater then they were; And so condition with him, as't may be Thou wilt confesse one day I begar'd thee: Or if I cannot by my meanes intreate Thy pottle-pots for to be made more great Then th' order is, or th' Citties stampe allowes, I hope I shall preuaile with some of those Who are appointed by their charge to know, Whether thy pots be sealed yea or no, That such as are not seal'd they would reueale them, And not take bribes in priuate to conceale them: Or if this will not serue, I will deuise How to bring th' potts vnto a larger size; Which if they do neglect but to performe, According to that Nature and that forme They are prescrib'd, then on default they shall Make presently a forfeiture of all, (Which goods confiscate for their great abuse, May afterward redound vnto the vse Of all such noble skinkers (by confession) As were deceiv'd by men of this profession; But this's not all Ile doe: Bacchus shall knowe His naprie-drawers shall not end it so. Surueighers shall be-gett (and well may be) (For worser trades haue sought monopolye; And rais'd their state by't) which shall strictly take Examination, whether you do make Your pottles to be bruis'd, bough'd, crusht, &amp; bent Vpon set purpose and for this intent, That you thereby (which is a common crime) Might fill your crazie pots with lesser wine, For lesser will they hold, through your deceit, Being drawne in and made by you more straite: Yet haue I left the Coopers all this while, Which I do know haue some art to beguile. And therefore, if all will not serue; Ile seeke And bribe them too, to make your vessels leeke. Yea, beside this (know Bacchus) I'ue a meane, Which put in practice will vndoe thee cleane, And thus I lay my proiect: Ile expresse What motiues there be of licentiousnesse, Within thy brothel closures, and with-all Complaine of thy partitions, how the fall Of many a simple Virgine (though shee's loath, To do't poore-wench) coms from a painted cloath, A curtaine, or some hanging of like sort, Which done god-wot, they'ue cause to curse thee for't. And that this might better preuented be, I will prefer petition instantly, That thou nor none of thine should suffer thence, (for to auoide this inconuenience) Any of different sexes being but payres, To goe in priuate manner vp the staires: And this I know (if that my aime be right, VVill goe well nie to ouerthrow thee quite. If none of these will doe, yet sure I am There is a creature call'd the Puritan, Who'le ferret thee, and by a strict surueigh Fine thee for bouzing on the Sabboath day, VVhich if they finde, the Righteous they will curse Though their example it be ten times worse. But I would haue thee to represse all this, VVhich thou shalt do by doing what I wish, And that with reason, which (as I haue sayd it) Is but to giue to our profession credit: They'le pay the man, and if the world goe hard, VVith them at this time, yet they'le afterward, Regratulate thy loue (paying th' old skore) VVhich paide they will make bolde to run on more. For tell me Bacchus, though the world appeare To learned men as if no learning were: And that the golden age (not as it was) Smiles on the silken foole, or golden Asse; Yet time will come (yea now it doth begin To shew it selfe (as former times haue been) VVhen wise Minerua shall no honour lacke, For all the foole, whose honour's on his backe. But I shall stagger Bacchus if I stay Longer with thee, therefore Ile packe awaie Vnto thy sister Ceres:—I haue sayd —Onely looke to thy plate, for all is paide. To the Queene of Haruest, daughter and heire to Saturne, and Ops, Goddesse of the Cornesheafe, Ladie Soueraignenesse of the three Vales, Efam, Beuar and White-horse, Inuentres of the Sith, Sickle, and weeding-Hooke: much honoured by the Reede, Corne-Pipe, and Whistle; and with all obseruance attended by Hobnaile and his company. Her Deities admirer wisheth many a seasonable Haruest. Haile fruitfull Ladie, cheerer of our time, Rare in thy bewtie, in thy state diuine, Ripener of Haruest, thou it is whose birth Yields full encrease vnto the fertile earth: Thou art that cheering mother that renues The Plow-mans hope, and giues their toile those dewes, Which makes them happie, may my Poems please Thy honourd selfe, that glads vs with encrease: Yet in my mirth I cannot but repine At that vnhappy ackward losse of thine, That thou which euer hast been debonaire, Faire in thy selfe, making our fields as faire, With thy ender'd respect, should be exilde, Of due content, by loosing of thy childe, Thy heart, thy hope, thy loue, and thy delight, Thy deare Proserpina, whose vowe is plight Vnto, alasse I cannot speake it well, That black-blacht-blabber-lipt foule Prince of hell. Yet be contented, manie one there bee, Yea I know som which may lament with thee For their straide daughters, who I much doe feare Are lodged now, or will be lodged there. Lasse it is nothing for maides now adaies For which of them (though modest) hath not straies, In youth, in age, which straying I doe call, Dotage in maides, and that is worst of all. How manie haue wee in this error swerud, Who in themselues haue iustly wel deserud. That punishment thy daughter first regainde, 'Las I haue known them though they seem containd In modest bounds, yet thus much I will say, Thy daughter was vnchast &amp; so were they. And (pray thee Ceres) credit me in this, Though my proceeding was not to my wish, Yet this to thy due comfort I must tell, Thy daughter doth not liue in Hell Without acquaintance, yea I know there are, Though they in sumptuous raiment and in fare Seeme to excell the worthies of our Land, Yet being iustly poized vnder hand, They are as neere to Pluto and his heire, As if those persons that lesse gorgeous were, May I speake more, for I am in a vaine, To cull strange things out of a stragling braine, That there's no wench truly ingenious, Wittie by nature, or ambitious In her conceipt, but that the time will come, That she will wander full as farre from home, As ere thy deare Proserpina distraide, Transform'd from beauty of a louely maide, To be a drudge ('lasse I am forc't to tell) Vnto the base-borne Skinkird bred in Hell. Doe I not know thee Ceres? yes, I know Far more of thee, then I intend to shew In publique eie: 'Lasse I doe know thy worth, To be the fruitfull Mother of the earth, Albions faire-Fostermother, yea that Queen, That makes a hopefull Haruest to be seene. Within our flourie Fields: if I might say, What I in due respect am bound alwaie For to expresse I might example thee, To be the glorie of our progenie; Honour of ages, and successe of time, Errecting to thy selfe that noble shrine, Which nere shall be defaced by time or age, The best of labour in our Pilgrimage. Then Ceres let thy daughter work, for one Thou art in due respect admir'd alone To be the soueraignesse of Albions Ile, Who when retired braines doe sleep the while, Shalt shew thy selfe worthy a sacred power, Though thy vaine daughter play in hell the whore, Yea fit it is, and suting to her birth, She should play baud in hell plaid whore on earth. To the Amarous Queene of Delights, Sole Empresse of loue-sicke Bedlams, profes'd patronesse to all young Letchers, Foundresse of Midnights Reuels, Sentinell to many a crackt Maidenhead, and sole Benefactor to all lasciuious Nouices; Best habilimented by her Coach drawne with foure Turtles, bearing for her armes a Pricke in the midst of a Center, with this Motto; Pungimur in Medio. And on the other side a woman-captiue (instanced in Penthisilæa) with this word, Vincitur a victo, victor. Her much Endered and affectionate Paliurus wisheth manie long delightful night, Mars his presence, Vulcans absence, much good sport without discouerie, and many yeeres yet to continue her husbands Liuery. Bacchus and Ceres if they be away, Small good doe I looke for, may Venus say. Carpit cuim vires paulatim vrit? videndo. Res vulgaris amor, semel insanimius omnes. Femina. Virg. Cherry-lipt Uenus with thy dimpled Chin, Who by our Letchers, honourd still hast bin: For a braue trading damsell, though't may seeme, By my neglect of thee, that I haue cleane Descarded thee and thine, yet thou shalt know it; Venus hath some aliance with a Poet, And that a neere one too: for pray thee say, Who can expresse thy bewty anie way, So well as they? and though they onely write, hauing nere hap to come to more delight; Yet art thou much endeared to their Art, Though they can say nought for the practick part: Yet mongst our Albion Sibils that are more, In number far, then merit, wit, or power. Some I doe know, euen of the pregnant'st men, That loue to trade with Venus now and then. And this the cause why they obserue that vse, (As I haue heard) for to enflame their Muse: And some I could produce, had their desire; For they, their Muse, and all were on a fire. More could I write to touch thee neerer'th quick, But as thou loues those stroakes are short &amp; thick. So I desire the very same to be In writing out that is concerning thee. An Heroycke Embleme vpon the Warriour called Honora. Tara, Tantara, Honours signall come, VVhose best of Musicke is the warlike Drumme, Come braue Tyndarian spirit, heare thy glorie, Shrouded too long in pitchie darke, whose storie, Shall shine and shew it selfe more faire, more bright, Then chast Larona on the sablest night. Now art thou much admird by euery eie, Though lately vassald to captiuitie. Now art thou showne to be a Monument, Of former glorie, and an ornament, Fit for the eare of Kings, now art thou one, Highly esteemed, that was of late as none. Now canst thou shew thy merit and desert, To be deriued from a royall heart. Not chafd with perfumes, like a Carpet Knight, That cannot fight but in his Ladies sight. Not sick ofth fashions, (like this amorous frie Of Nouice, who nere knew Enemie) Saue their disdainefull Mistres: not enthrald To loue, for loue thou knowst not how its cald. VVhat stile it has, or what be louers charmes, Saue that pure loue which thou dost beare to Armes. Not seruile to each apish complement, Saue Honours seruice, and VVarres mannagement. Not slaue to Fortune, nor engagd to fate, But heire to resolution, an estate More eminent and glorious to thy selfe, Then all the misers-Mammons mouldred-pelfe, Not vaine like proud of Titles, but hast Art, To make thy waie to Honour by Desert. Not gage to prostitution, for the name Of Souldiour hate such an ignoble staine. Not lure to lucre, but dost make thy blood, An instrument vnto thy countries good: Not in appearance, or in outward show, To seem to know what thou didst neuer know, Not humorous, occasioning offence, But with pure valour mixing patience; That two reduc't to one, one drawen from two, Might make thee apt to speake, &amp; prompt to doe. Long hast thou slept, and some did thinke it ill To wake thee, but to let thee sleepe on still. But how can resolution lie inter'd Alas how far haue vulgar iudgements er'd? To thinke the senselesse? No, thou didst but winke, For to obserue what other men would thinke Of thy retired silence, now thou hast Rub'd ore thy gummie eies, &amp; runnes as fast To thy intendements forct from coast to coast, As willing to redeeme what thou hast lost. Hallow amaine, downe by the flowrie vale Of honour and renowne display thy saile, Trample on Bastard greatnesse, bruite their shame, That are esteemed onely great in name, Without demerit, tell them worth should be Drawn from our selues, not from our familie. Bid them wipe of that painting from their cheeke, Its too effeminate and bid them feeke, Actions that seeme them better, its not amber, Sleeking, or chafing in a Ladies chamber, Phantastick humors, amorous conceipts, Fashion inuentors sinne seducing baits, What such a Mounseyr wore, or what Tyres be Of eminent request in Italie. No, no, our perfum'd Gallants now must looke, Like to the sonnes of Valour, smer'd with smoke, Steeled with spirit, arm'd with best of youth, Directly planted 'fore a Cannons mouth. Shake not (my dapper Courtier) though thou heare Nought but the voice of thunder euery where: Or if the noise of armes breed in thee feare, (No lesse then death) go on and stop thine eare? Bouge not a foot (or if thou feare to kill) Winke, and then say, thou murders gainst thy will. How likest thou this? This is no camp for loue, Nor must thy wreath be heere a Ladies gloue. Anticke and apish fashions will not serue, In this enobled field, such as deserue, By a peculiar merit shall receiue The Guerdon of their Valour, and in Graue Shall finde a liuing monument, which men Admiring much, shall euer honour them. And is not this a nobler monument, Then spend our time in fruitlesse complements. Spend a whole age in making of a legge, Or seeking how some office we may begge. Trading for vndeserued Honour, got By seruile meanes, and by the simplest sot, That knowes not Honours essence, O may I Rather then be so Honor'd wish to dye In the obscurest manner, that when Time Shall shroud my ashes in a homely shrine, Some earthy vrne, yet may my memorie Liue without reach of enuie after me. Sacred Bellona, valours choicest Saint, For now by thee flie we vnto our tent. Infuse true resolution in the minde Of thy professors, that their spirits may finde What difference there is in honours sight, Twixt a good Souldier and a carpet-Knight. His perfume's powder, and his harmonie Reports of Cannons, for his brauerie, Barded with steele and Iron, for the voice, Of amorous Ganimedes, the horrid noise Of clattering armour, for a Downie bed The chill cold ground, for pillow to their head, Tinckt with muske Roses, Target and their shield, For gorgeous Roomes, the purprise of the field, For nimble capring, Marching, for the tune Of mouing consorts, striking vp a drumme, For dainties, hunger; thus is honour fed, VVith labour got, and care continued. Can this content my Courtier? yes, it may, VVhen his laciuious night and fruitles day, His manie idle howers employed worse, (Though better deem'd) then such whose vagrant course Incurs a penal censure; shall be past, And he with whip of conscience throughly lash't, Shall bid adue to Ladie vanitie To Courts applause, to humors phantasie, To honours vndeseru'd, to parasites, To fashions-brocage, and to all delights. VVhich reape no fruit, no guerdon, nor reward, Saue care on earth, repentance afterward: VVhere Iustice oft is forc't from her intent. Goodnesse being onely cause of punishment. Where violence (so strong be great men growne) Makes right supprest', and iustice ouerthrowne. VVhere sinnes in cloth of Tissue faire descri'de, Make that wise Sages Axiome verifi'de. “A great mans foe oft by experience proues, “Of all that be, no thunder like to Ioues. Heere Magistrates are clad in violet, Because pure Iustice they doe violate. Here vice is mounted, vertue liues despis'd, The worst esteem'd, the better meanely priz'd. Corruption rides on foote-cloth, (some auerre) And vpright dealing shee does lackie her. Honour's afraide of Sergeants, merits sad, And liues as one without obseruance had. VVisdom's out of request, for temperance, Shee's neuer knowne but in a Moris daunce. And purple Iustice seldom's seene to passe, To any Court, but riding one an Asse. VVhat then but valour should support the State, And make a Realme by vice growne desolate. See her owne shame, and in her shame conceiue, The blest memorial of an happie graue, “On then with honour, let the vsurer Made stiffe with plenty, feele the shock of war, And tremble, fearing least' should be his lot, To loose by warre what his oppression got. Let the prophane contemner of Gods power Be mou'd by terrour, let the Paramour, Glaz'd with a shamelesse fore head leaue her sinne. The youthfull Prodigall, those nets hee's in. Let the prodigious state-engrosser feele, What harme h'as done vnto the Common-weale. Let th' aspiring birth of Dathan see, The end of them, and their conspiracie. Let all lasciuious Minions hence reclaime, Their odious liues, and put on robes of shame. Let publique Haxsters (now the most of all) That in their heat, would quarrell for the wall, Stand to their Tacklings, let both youth and age, Show distinct worths in distant Equipage. Lead on Honora, that in time report, May make a Campe Knight gracious in the Court. So noblest minds in best of Actions showne, May challenge Honour when it is their owne. Upon the Generall Sciolists or Poettasters of Britannie. A Satyre. Come Arethuse come, for nere had we, At any time a greater need of thee. No Lawrell now, but Nettle's best to grace Our Laureat Poet see his vncouth face, Vnapt for poesie: his strange disguise, Onely addrest (in Verse) to Temporize: Now Parasites proue Poets, and expresse Their oyly workes: for what is more or lesse Dilated on, is consecrate to men, That are the greatest: O what need is then, To thee (deere Arthuse) that didst frame, A Poet to the nature of his name? No time-obseruing smooth fac'd sycophant, No strange conceited Asse whose Element Is to insinuate vnder the shade Of a great Mounseyrs elbow, thour't prou'd Iade To thy profession, not a saffron band, But like a roaring boye, can make thee stand And yeeld obseruance to him: silly foole, That Artlesse idiots should bring to schoole, The best of Muses, thou that once wast borne, Not as our great Acteons, to the horne Of their dishonour, (being of ioy bereft) Leauing to others what themselues haue left. (Worse by degrees then was that Phœbus Car, Which Phaeton by rash attempts did marre: And cleere dissolues) lasse see thy Trophies torne, Thy statues razed: and that Mount forlorne Which first possest the Muses: now no wreath Can be hung vp to memorize the death Of any great man, why for vertues due, Bids euery Poet (in his verse) speake true Of such as are deceased: its true, who then Speaking no more then truth, can praise such men, As rather were then liu'd? being, but not In reall essence, las what fame is got By such as write of these (whose onely good) Is to auerre they were of Noble bloud. But so much disproportion'd to their name, As what they seem'd, they seldome were the same. The same; O noe, their garish ornament, Their wanton guise, their Loue-sicke complement, Their strange distractions, their deformed state, Transform'd from English to Italienate, Expresse small comfort to a Poets penne, Which onely should delight in shewing them Vnto the worlds eye, whose fame succeedes, And makes them Noble by Heroicke deedes, Drawen from the line of Honour: but how farre Seeme Poets in these latter times to erre? Who write not for respect, or due esteeme, Had to their owne profession, but to gaine The fauour of a great one, this it is, Giues priuiledge to men that doe amisse: Such be our ranke of Poets now adayes, As they adorne th' Immerited with praise Aboue desert. Hence is it that we bring The Art of Poetry to Ballading. Hence is it, that the Courtier may intend A strange pretended proiect for no end, Saue to augment's expence, a suites begun, Which makes a silly Farmer quite vndone, Without all hope of composition: l'asse That such transgressions should so freely passe, Without controulement. Many we haue heere, That can compose their Verse, but in a sphere So different to the time, as they descry Their want of braines to each iudicious eye. Yea some I know are Poets in this time Who write of swains, might write as well of swine, For th' profit of their labours is so small, As t'were farre better not to write at all, Then to consume such pretious time in vaine, About a fruitlesse, and desertlesse straine: Better indeed: when in their Makers sight, They must accomptants be of what they write, Whose eyes be purer, and extension beare, Aboue th' Dimension of a common sphere. Yet ranke I not (as some men doe suppose) These worthlesse swaines amongst the laies of those Time-honour'd Shepheards (for they still shall be) As well they merit) honoured of mee, Who beare a part, like honest faithfull swaines, On witty Wither neuer-withring plaines, For these (though seeming Shepheards) haue deseru'd, To haue their names in lasting Marble caru'd: Yea this I know I may be bold to say, Thames ner'e had swans that song more sweet than they. It's true I may auow't, that nere was song, Chanted in any age by swains so young, With more delight then was perform'd by them, Pretily shadow'd in a borrowed name. And long may Englands Thespian springs be known “By louely Wither and by bonny Browne, Whilest solid Seldon, and their Cuddy too, Sing what our (Swaines of old) could neuer doe. Yea I do hope, sith they so well can write, Of Shep-heards sport, and of the fields delight. That when they come to take a view of th' Court, (As some haue done) and haue bin mew'd vp for't, They'l tell her freely, (as full well they may) That in their Iudgements, after due suruay, Of th' Court &amp; th' Cottage, they may well maintain, Vices in the Court, but vertues in the Swaine; And happy be those Authors which doe giue Vertue and vice their titles, they shall liue In spite of Enuie, when such men as teach That such be onely vertuous as be rich, Shall lye inter'd, where fame shall neuer finde them, For such doe seldome leaue a name behind them. Lasse they must dye and perish, so must we, Nor can we gaine ought of eternity: Saue that we liue, Oh then how blest are they That spend their life in weighing of their daies. But of professants, which compose their song To a strange descant! this Ile say they wrong Flowrie Parnassus, where such vsed to be, As in themselues made one set company. These sung not what they knew not, but in Verse, What time had taught them they vse to rehearse, And to reduce it to one perfect forme, Striuing by proper figures to adorne Ech worke, ech composition: but lasse now How farre's that alteration? where we know Lest that we write, adding to our estate (Begg'd meerely) by a great mans Dedicate. Heere is no substance, but a simple peece Of gaudy Rhetoricke: Which if it please, Yeelds th' Author dear-contentment: thus we straine The Muses Text for a peculiar gaine Vnto our selues: hence is it vice abides, (And lording-like in silken foot-cloath rides.) Hence is it Land-lords make their tenants slaues: Hence is it waste-goods ope their fathers graues: Hence is it Mammonists adore their golde: Hence is't the impious to perdition solde: Hence Sacriledge a priuiledge obtaines: Hence th' sneking Lawyer by his Clyent gaines: Hence th' Politician, what so ere befall, Will to his trade and shew a Machiuell. Hence imposts rise extortions violence, Graced by men that haue most eminence. Hence Sergeants walk vnfr?ted (though they know it) No friend is worse then Sergeant to a Poet. Hence painted faces (like ill wine in caske) Shrow'd their deform'd complexions vnder maske. Hence curious Courtiers, gorgeously arrayd, Weare more vpon their backe then ere was paide: Hence th' baudie Pandor, seruile to his whore, And hence the Baude that keeps the traders dore; Hence base informers take their borrowed light, Liuing like Owles that vse to flie by night: Hence wanton Prodigals that spend their state, And 'gin repentance when it is too late. Hence young and old, hence each in their degree, Challenge to them a due Monopolie. O how Mineruas temple's now disgrac't, By th' skum of Poetry! she that was plac't Once like th' Ephesian Queene in a pure shrine Of honour and delight, now's forc't to pine. And languish in her bewty, being deprest, By such men most, whom she suspecteth lest. Vnpiniond Muses (such as nere could flie) Further then vnplum'd birds now presse as high As Eagles; which by the Colour you may know, As eminent and cleere as Elaccus Crow: These steale selected flowres from others wit, And yet protest their nature brookes not it, They are (for both) so inuented by their art, Making their pen the displayer of their heart. They brooke no Brocage, yet has workes in presse, VVhich they are guiltlesse of? but this were lesse, VVorthy reproofe, if in their gleaned lines, Like our age Criticks they would curbe these times For petulancie: but so vaine be they, As they runne still in that high beaten way Of errour, by directing men amisse, Penning whole volumes of licentiousnesse, Descanting on my Ladies Rosie lip, Her Cinthian eie, her bending front, her trip, Her bodies motion, notion of her time, All which they weaue vp in a baudy Rime. For since there's no obseruance, Accent neither (Sith sence and accent seldome goe together.) O what aspersions doe these lay on her, VVho beares the onely natiue character. Of her deere issues merit, shee I meane, VVithout whose nourishment we had not been, She without whose embrace, the solid earth, Had quite interr'd the honour of our birth: She without whom we haue no biding place, No mansion, no repose: she by whose grace We are inhabitants, planted in rest, Sucking pure milke out of her tender brest. She whose our Guardian gouerning our state Shoring our weaknesse, arming vs 'gainst fate, Guiding our path-lesse passage, brething life Into our dulnesse: midiating strife, Because (a peacefull mother) chering vs With solace, when deprest, tricking our Muse, VVith seemly subiects (that whil'st shepheards sing) Of rurall pastimes, midst their sonneting, The grauer ranke might compositions make, Not for themselues but for their countries sake: Alasse poore countrie; where is all that store Of diuine wits that thou hast bred before? VVhere is that Quint-essence of poesie, That in (fore-times) was wont to breath on thee: Like a coole Zephirus? Hybles pure mount, Renowm'd in former ages and that Fount, Of sacred Castalie lie desolate. For they with theirs haue lost their former state Of Greatnesse: no proportion nor no flower Decks, with a dasie Border, that sweet Bower Where Cinthia vs'd to reuell: but as th' port Of house-keeping is now transport'd to Court, “Leauing their Country-houses, which men looke “And gase at long ere they can see them smoke: So fruitfull Hesperie, which vs'd to be The Ren-de uou for sacred poesie Leuing to be her selfe, shuts vp her dore? Hence is the bankrout poet becom'd poore: Hence is't hee's forc't to write not for the ease Of his owne minde (but as his Patrons please.) Hence ist that errors must be V'ertues deem'd, Because, poore Poet, its by Fate ordain'd, That if he will not humour, he must sterue: “For Great-men loue not heare what they deserue. How iealous be our times of their deserts, When they suppresse the eminence of arts? Making them speechlesse whereas we do see, If persons were dispos'd as they should be; Their sincere conscience (like a brazen wall) Might beare them vp what euer should befall. Then might our Satyre mixe his inke with gal, But with his mixture do no hurt at all. Then might our scepticke giue his iudgement free, yet do small harme to mens integritie. Then might the Lawyer pleade without offence; Not seare his Conscience with a faire pretence Of doing good, when his corrupted will Vnder pretence of good, acts what is ill. Then might the diuels Factors liue like men, That haue a god, nor for the hundred ten; Receiuing with aduantage need'd they pay, A greater summe at that same latter daie, VVhen due accompts are had: ô vsurie That art the Cities scourge, how much haue we Occasion to proscribe thee from our land, Since by thy meanes haue we felt heauens hand More heauy and reuenging then before, VVhose wrath has vialls euer laid in store To punish impious men: its thou (fowle sin) Which hast hal'd downe the infection we haue seene Rage in this famous Ile: its thou whose hight Hath turn'd our day of comfort to a night Of great affliction: for who more can be Afflicted in himselfe, then inwardly Feeling the worme of Conscience gnawing him Torment consorting with that birth of sinne VVherein he's nurtured: alas poore Ile! That thou shouldst foster such as do defile Thy once renowmed borders with the hate Of a supernall power, making thy state Pray to oppression, vassalling thy fame (VVhich once was glorious) to thy odious name Of miserie: Great Albion now is growne Poore in her selfe, because what is her owne She cannot vse but in depraued wise, Makes her selfe subiect to all forraine eyes As vices spectacle: ô that the blisse VVhich we enioy by minds Synderysis Th' refined part of man, should soyled be By th' worst of ils the staine of vsury? And who'le inueigh against it, few or none, For miser Nature hardly leaues vs one, That can securely speake against this ill So generall is the poison of our will: For (deere Pernassus now is so opprest) It dare not speake for feare that interest, Should be demaunded by the Vsurer To whom it stands engag'd: this is the fate That Poets haue, to leaue more wit then state To their posteritie: ô impious time! When worst of Fortune followes wits diuine; VVhen noble actions motiue in their spirit, Can leaue nought to their Issue to inherit: Saue their poore fathers papers, monuments Scarce worth respect: how weakes the Element VVhich Poets are compos'd of, when one frowne Sent from a great mans visage can keepe downe Their best inuention? silly poesie, That (though free borne, art forc't to slauery, And vndeseru'd subiection: pittie it is, That best of merit should shut vp her wish; And dew expectance in no other booke, Saue in a skrew'd face or a writhed looke; Vnfit to entertaine an Art diuine VVhich is exprest in that poore Muse of thine. Come, come, great regent of that sacred quire, Come in thy selfe and so our soules inspire VVith Arts Elixir and with spirit toe, That we may do with boldnes what we do: Erect our aged fortunes make them shine (Not like the foole in's foot-cloath) but like Time, Adorn'd with true experiments which may Conuert our odious night to glorious day. Let not Ambition mounted in her state Passe vncontrol'd: care not for getting hate: “For honest minds are best approued still, “By gaining hate in curbing what is ill. Trunco? Simillimus Heros.

Let not moth-eaten Auarice appeare In this deere Ile, without her Character: Lash me the Symonist, who though precise In shew, can geld his Parsons Benifice.

Let not sin-tempting wanton Meremaids rest VVithout due censure, who with naked brest, Attractiue eye, and garish Complement Ensnare our fond vnwary Innocent: These are those Babell publique prostitutes, Lures to damnation, Romane Catamites, Inuentresses of pleasures, pensiue still To doe whats good, but frolike to doe ill. O London how thy Vanity abounds, Glorying in that which thy renowne confounds. Traduced fashions from the Dutch to French, From French to Spanish, and not longer since, Then yesterday, blush at thy sinne for shame, That Albion (by thy meanes) should lose her name, And habit too: see, see, how farre thou'rt gone, Beyond thy selfe, that therer's no fashion knowne, In forraine Courts, deform'd howsoere it be, But by transportance it doth come to thee. Lasse how immodest art thou to expresse, Thy selfe so much by others fashions lesse? How strangely Metamorphis'd to partake, For Angells forme, the most deformed shape, That Countries can bring out: ô pittie tis That Albions much admir'd Metropolis, Should make those which admir'd her now to hate Her vaine condition (introduc'd by state Too plentifull: Here you Hesperian wits May you haue subiect more then well befits A modest pen: for nere was any time More prone to ill: no Region, countrey, clime, Prouince, Isle, Regiment so truly blest With all earths bounties, yet hath lesse exprest, Of gratitude: here Satirists resort, And make an ample coment on the Court, VVhere thou shalt write, som's wanton, others vaine, Ambitious some, others doe couet gaine By seruile meanes: some beggars, yet who dare VVrite in these daies that any such there are. Then (my sharp tooth'd Satire) frame thy ditty In the same forme, vnrip the Crimes of'th Citty VVith a sterne brow: tell the purple Magistrate, How he has rais'd himselfe to great estate By others ruine: such as Mercers are, Tell them darke shops haue got away ill ware, Such as be Gold-smiths, and are dangerous, Call them the Siluer-smith of Ephesus. Long liue Diana, but no longer then By their Diana they doe reape a gaine. Such as be Brokers, tell them their profession, Is not to be a knaue o'th first edition. But as those garments which are brought to them, Vse to be worne before by other men: Euen so they broke their vices and receiue Som crimes wrapt vp i'th garm?ts which they haue, Tell them of Wapping, bid them thankfull be, That there is Iustice had for Piracie: For if that were not (it may well be said) Many their shops would be vnfurnished, But in the Country now my Muse shall be, For brooke shee'le not a Brokers Company. Here shalt thou see th' picture of Auarice, Thin-cheek'd, raw-bon'd, faint-breath, and hollow-eyes. Nose-dropping, rhewme-destilling, driueling mouth Hand-shaking, haire down-falling, th' misers cough, Legs goutie, knees vnweldy, hand on cruch, Eies in his bosome, gasing on his pouch, His labour torment, rest he cannot take, VVhen all are sleeping, he is forc't to wake: His Eies are euer ope, for riches keepe His eies vnclosed: The miser cannot sleepe. He's his owne anguish, such an impious elfe, Thats ill to all, but worst vnto himselfe. He has not bookes whereon to meditate, Onely a debt booke and an Alminake. The one's for forfeitures, where he will pore, And daie by day trauers them ore and ore: Th' other's his Enterlude that yeelds him mirth, Seeing predictions of the next yeeres dearth. Hope of a deerer Sommer then last was Vnseasoned haruest: O these hopes surpasse All others, Heere the Miser sets his eie, And when he does these strange prenotions spie, He kisses th' booke, sweares the profession's rare, And wishes all hee reades such subiects were. This Cormorant engrosseth all his graine, Makes his barnes greater by a secret traine Brings ore his neighbours sonne to set his hand, Vnto a sale, and so ioynes land to land. This wicked vlcer that corrupts the state, Nere thinkes of death, till that it be too late. His gold's his God, yet vse it cannot he, But in expression of his miserie: Which puts the poore Miser to a double paine, By telling it and putting't vp againe. But now (my nimble Satyre) for to thee Tends this impolisht peece of poesie: How wilt thou taxe, or where wilt thou begin With thy tart phrase, to stinge and nettle him? Thou must be bitter (for in greatest grieues) And festered wounds we vse no lenitiues To mollefie, but corrasiues to gall: And of all griefes this is the great'st of all. By it we are degenerate and liue, As such as can receiue, bnt cannot giue To Nature competence: Come my deare Mate Ile tell thee how to cure their desperate state; Which in few words least that thy memory faile, Ile speake my minde vnto thee in a tale. It chaunc't vpon a time (and well might be For such like chances fall on miserie,) A pinch-gut Miser fell extreamely sicke, So, as at last his Conscience gan to pricke, And tell him of's oppression, wheresoere He turn'd his eyes, he saw damnation there. Sleepe could he not, his sicknesse was too great, Nor hope for ought, his conscience did so threate And terrifie his soule: thus lay this wretch Poore in his spirit, though to the world rich; Faine would he oft desire himselfe confest. But cause he was falne out with Parish priest About a Tith-pigge, he deferr'd the time, And would in no case suffer this Diuine To minister due comfort to his state All woe begone: so great was th' Misers hate: For though he were afflicted, yet would he Vp-braide the Parson full irreuerently, Calling him hedge priest, belly-god (nay more) That like a Thiefe, he came not in at dore, But in at windowe to his Benefice; And that he knew the practice and deuice Of him and's Patron: who that th' law might by Dispensed with in case of Symonie, Sold him a horse (that whatsoere should fall,) The price might pay for th' Benefice and all; This would he say, concluding merrily, Sir Priest you come more for my pigge then me, Silent the Parson was, for well he knew, The Miser spoke no more then what was true Onely he wisht such neighbours as he had Present to pray for him, for he was mad, And that by all appearance it was like That his disease had made him lunaticke: Thus euery day his sicknesse did encrease, Bereft of comfort, conscience sweetest peace, Without all hope of health or here or there, (For th' worm of conscience follows euery where.) There's no euasion left: where ere we goe She will attend vs in our weale and woe. You heard confest he would, but as tis true, A miser loues not him that craues his due: So to such men this censure stands for iust, They loue their Conscience rest lesse then their rust. What should he doe? the Parson now is gone, And he vnto himselfe is left alone T'expostulate with death: his sinnes did grieue him But now the most when all his friends do leaue him; Torment belowe, iudgement he sees aboue, Witnesse within him, that will duly proue What he has done on earth (thus all in one Make vp a consort in his dying mone: Yet as a ship ore-burdend with her freight Sinking before, sayls brauely, being made light; Or as the Ocean beats from shelfe to shelfe, (Sea-sicke god-wot) till she hath purg'd herselfe. So this sur-charged soule rowl's here and there, And yet to comfort is no whit the neere, Till that same lastage of corruption be Exempted quite: then sleepes she quietly. Confesse he must, but to no Priest, that's vaine: But vnto one cleere of another straine; Shall I tell Satire? yes, thou needs must know it, And this he was; a thrid-bare neighbouring Poet: Who after dew confession made to him Of euery act, and each peculiar sinne, Extortion, Violence and Iniurie, Pressing of Orphanes, biting vsurie, Forfeitures taken, forged bills, at last He makes confession how a Poet past His pikes: who once was of a faire estate, But after had no prospect but a grate: O, quoth the Poet, that was ill in you; O (quoth the Miser) I doe know its true: But with remorce I now lament his fall, Which 'mongst the rest afflicts me most of all. Wherefore good Sir, poure out your prayers for me, That in distast of my impiety Languishing sore, I may be cheerd in state, Dying in hope, that now lies desperate. The faire conditio'nd Poet, though he had heard How ill his owne profession got reward, By this hard-harted Miser; yet did he Scorne his reuenge should in affliction be: Streight he retires himselfe a pretty space, Chusing for's Orisons a priuate place, VVhich being done, to cheere the drooping man, VVith hands heau'd vp, his praiers he thus began. Powerfull Iehouah, King of Heauen and Earth, That giu'st to all things liuing life and birth. Thou that protects each thing which thou hast made, And so preseru's it, as it cannot fade. Before the time prefin'd: thou that wilt haue Mercy on such as thou dost meane to saue. Looke on this wretch (that lies all woe begon) If so thou thinke hees worthy looking on: Great is thy mercy, so it needs must be, If thou wilt saue such Miscreants as he. But what thou meanes to doe, he faine would know, Whether he must ascend, or fall below: That he prouision may according make, And fit himselfe for th' Uoyage he must take. For if to heauen, he needs the lesse prepare, Because he knowes all needfull things be there. But much he fear'd, and so feare other some, Mongst which my selfe, that there be nere shall come, But if to hell (the likelier place o'th two) He does desire, that thou wouldst this allow. He may haue so much respite as prepare, The Bonds of all such Prodigalls be there: That what he could not cancell here so well On earth, may there be cancelled in hell. The cause is this (as it to me appeares) Lest that those spend-thrifts fall about his eares, When they shall see him, which that he may stay, He'le cancell th' Bonds, though't be long after day Or this's the cause as he was impious here, He meanes to proue an honest Deuill there. “That Time to Times-successors may bring forth, “Hell made him better than he was on Earth. Much more he praide, but I doe rather chuse, (Satyre) to make of all his praiers an vse, That when the vse shall well expressed be, Thou maist apply the Benefit to thee. Sir [quoth the Poet] I my praiers haue made, Haue you, (replyed he,) as one dismayed, Yes sir, and by them so my zeale enforc't, As I preuaild, though it was long time first, For know an apparision came to me VVith a shrill voice, which bad me say to thee: If thou wile first a restitution make, And render vp what thou by Fraud didst take, From any man, but chiefly what thou tooke From th' Poet: next, deliuer vp thy booke Of all Accounts, great'st cause of thy despaire, To thy Confessour, and make him thy heyre. Thou shalt haue health for this, it bad me tell, But if thou wilt not thou art markt for hell, For Hell, no marry It take keyes and state, I will not buy wealth at so deere a rate. If thou my pretty Satyre couldst reclayme, A miser thus, I'de thanke thee for the same. But all too long I haue enforc't thee stay, Vice calleth thee, and Time drawes me away. An Epigramme called the Ciuill Deuill. It chanc't one euening as I went abroad, To cheere my cares, and take away my loade, Of disagreeing passions, which were bred By the distemper of a troubled head, Midst of my walke, spying an Allye doore, (Which I protest I neuer spied before) I entred in, and being entred in, I found the entry was to th' house of sinne. Yet much I wondred, how sin there could be. Where th' sinnes protectresse show'd most modesty. A ciuill matron, lisping with forsooth, As one that had not heart to sweare an oath, In Graue attire, French hood, all Frencheside, For she had some-thing more of French beside, Her outward rayment in a loose-gowne made. Right after fashion, with a countnance staid, And which is stranger (shamefast) her I aboord (Like a young nouice letcher) making each word A protestation; she that knew'th deuice, T'ensnare a greene wit, seem'd wondrous nise, Reprouing of my errour: Sir, I am (For thus she tooke me vp) wife to a man Of due respect, one that has office borne, Twice in the Citty, therefore pray forbeare, You doe mistake yourselfe, there's none such heere As you make sute for. I as one dismaid, That durst not iustifie what I had said, Began to slinke away; she seeing this, Fearing least she should such a Gudgeon misse. Recants what she had said, swearing though she VVere such a mans wife of the Marshalsie, One that had neuer yet incurd ill name, Or knew ought more then modesty or shame, Though she nere was defam'd in all her life, Or loued more then as becom'd a wife, Though her affection neuer yet was showne (Saue to her husband) vnto any one, Though she was graue in yeers, and therefore might Tread rightly now, that had so long trod right, She would pawne name, fame, modestie, and all Affection, husband, yea what ere befall Her grauer yeeres should once dispence with time, “She would, forsooth, remaine entirely mine, This alteration made me strangely doubt, And though my feet were in, my mind was out. Yet so was I enthralld by tempting sinne, Though Vertue forc't me out, Vice kept me in. Thus did my tempting Genius, sweare, protest, That of all creatures she did loue me best, And with dissembling teares disguise her ill, Fond is that man, and fonder is his will, That's thus deprau'd: how seruile are men growne, When these same Vertues we esteeme our owne Are thus Eclips'd by Hyene faced whores, That protestation make they will be ours, When they proue nothing lesse, las I do know And by experience, whatsoere they show. Their painted-Vizards couer naked sinne, Which seeming faire, are euer foule within. A whiten wall, a rotten odious tombe, That prostitutes her selfe to all that come. To all that come, hence then's affection crost, For loue is pure, but lust for them bid most. But to my Saint-like Deuill: she thus precise At first held credit deere, but now her eyes Like wandring stars prest to induce some sin Makes me (the silly fish) catcht by her gin. Reason did tell me, and suggest her name, Whispring me in the eare, it was a shame To gage my reputation to a whore: But las who knows it not, sense hath more power Then reason in these acts: I gaue consent To her inducements, thought her Innocent, And a right modest matron: yet how farre, Did sense from reason in her Verdict erre? For how could she be modest that so soone, Was gain'd ere crau'd, so quickly wood and wonne? Lasse that my simple straine should be so weake, As to continue for a wantons sake, So firme in my affection? she was graue, Its true, she was so: but how many haue That forme of grauity, the more their sinne, Being so graue without, so gay within, But she protested; true, she swore an oath, As any other tempting wanton doth, VVhen shee's in hope of gaine, vnhappy I, To leane so much to harlots forgery. Well my braue Curtizan, since I am won, To doe that act by which I am vndone. Since I am shared, and like a Bird thats caught, Fledged in bird-lime, am of wit distraught, And senses too: I will runne headlong to it, And doe it with force, since I perforce must doe it. Downe goes the silken Carpet all the while, Showing those sheets, which louers doe beguile, Those sheets of lust perfum'd deliciously, VVith rosie odours, where variety Of obiects made recourse: see wantons see, How many motiues now enuiron me? Heere my lasciuions Matron wooes with teares, There a repose for lusts retrait appeares. Heere a protesting whore (see whoredomes shelfe) Rather then loose me, she will damme her selfe. There Adons picture, clipping Uenus round, Here Ioue Europa lying on the ground. Heere Mars disarm'd in Beauties chariot drawen, VVhere faire Eryca couer'd ore with lawne, Bids him her best of welcome, and is ledde, For want of roomes vnto her Husbands bedde. Heere Danâe stood (admiring diuine power) VVhich did descend like to a goulden shoure, Into her Virgin-lap, there straight I spide The tempting Omphale, and on one side, Her wanton sister, on the other, faire Alcinous daughter, courted for her haire By great Apollo: but below her foote, Sat Hercles spinning, she enioynd him too't. Here I beheld the nimble Satyres dance The Druids sung, the water-Sea-nimphs praunce, Ore the delicious Mede: there was the Queene Of Amorous meetings pictur'd as sh' ad beene Taking a greene-gowne (many such there are) Of Mars that Martiall Enginer of warre. Heere Vulcane lay, poore Cuckold as he was, And saw them mating on the greeny grasse, Yet durst say nought, how many such there be, That see enough, but dare not say they see? Sweet heart (quoth she) and smild, seeing me eye This picture more then any one was nie, Leaue me the shadow, to the substance goe, VVhat thou now seest, let louers action know, Ile be thy Uenus, pretty Ducke I will, And though lesse faire, yet I haue farre more skill, In Loues affaires: for if I Adon had, As Uenus had: I could haue taught the lad. To haue beene farre more forward then he was, And not haue dallied with so apt a lasse. Come, come (my youngling) though I nere could be Immodest yet, Ile show my selfe to thee, A lasse of mettall: Come, in faith thou shalt, Thour't Mars, I Venus, he that limping halt, My Vulcan-husband, pox on't he is gone, And I my selfe as desolate alone, VVill entertaine thee: I in manlike shape, Being a man, a man should imitate. Protested I would doe, yet had no power, For who can deale so ably with a whore, Or with so free-bred actions, since I know, None can affection with election show, Sincerely or entirely, but whose strife, S'transform'd from wanton action to a wife Of modest action: this is she can doe, And euery night has new conceits to wooe, Though she be won, las what is wooing then, Since wooing, winning, be small change in men? VVho knowes not whores affection purchas'd soon, And that they are not sooner woo'd then wonne? Or as the world goes, for its more common, VVomen woe men more oft then men woe women. Hence nature seemes to haue transform'd vs quite, Conuerting day vnto a drerie night, Vertue to vice, a good-names eminence, Expos'd to shame, and publique impudence. Once women knew a blushing shame-fastnesse, But now a blush is least that they expresse; Vnlesse for shame of hauing done some ill They feare is known, which they would shadow stil, Shine brightest heauen (if thou wilt deigne to shine. And with thy beames dispell this hideous crime, Which now (protection has): curbe them, that call Such sinnes as veniall, Venereall. Let not an Ile of an Angelicke name Expose her glory to the house of shame: Let not those many Tropheies of her worth Loose their renowne or honour in our birth. Let not faire Albion, stil'd from cliffes so white, Change Vertues day-star to a vicious night. Let not those many conquests she hath got Seeme now deprest, as if remembred not. Let not our peace (like Halcion daies) be tane From vs and ours and giuen to other men: Let not this sacred Vine which planted is In Albion, shaken be by wantonnesse. Let not our plenty and aboundant store Occasion be that we should sinne the more: Let not our Realme vnite, diuide that loue Which we should beare vnto the King aboue: Let not our want of wars inuasion bring vs A lust-full war encountring within vs. Let not those manie blessings we receiue, Make vs interre our honour in our graue, Let not our seasons yeerly fruitfulnesse Produce in vs a loathed barrannesse. Let not those many strange conspiracies Which heauen preuented, close our thanklesse eyes, Let not our being make vs not to be, For God is God and will auenged be. He seemes some time to sleepe and suffer all, But calls at last for vse and principall. Many, I know, there be of crimes that's ill, Drawne from the source of our depraued will. But of all crimes that euer were or be, None in this Ile claimes more impunity. A purple sin (for who will not allow it) Since purple-fathers oft-times go vnto it? The Citties Elders (which though they reproue) They doe but chastice what themselues do loue. Statists haue lov'd it too: but marke (my friend) For all their state they had a loathsome end, Like stinking Herod, loth'd Hertogenes, Crook't Damocles, lowsie Pherecides; All these experience had of this fowle euill, And could describe too-well a ciuell Diuell. The Authors Morall to his Ciuell Diuell. Come Nouice, come, see here the fall of youth, Begun in pleasure, but wouen vp in rueth: See what occurrents meete the heires of shame, Where end is pouerty, and cloz'd ill-name? See what the fruits be of licentious sin That end in woe as they in heate begin? See painted Sodom-apples faire to th' eye, But being tutcht they perish instantly. See, see a wanton Mere-mayd, that does sing, To bring youths crazie backe to ruining. See Vertue in pretence, but vice in deed, See Harlots action in a Matrons weede: See damned Factors who their trafficke make, Not for their soule but for the diuels sake. See my coach't Lady hurried long the street, Casting her lusts-eyes on who s'ere she meet, See, see her cerus cheeke, made to delight Her apple-squire, or wanton Marmosite. See, see her braided haire, her paps laide out, Which witnesse how she'le do when she's put to 't, O see she likes vpon th' condition well, So she may coached be she'le goe to hell, And willingly: see, see adulterate golde, In valew worst, yet is the deerest solde. See Albions curse, Youths gulph, Heires misery, Our Countries shame, soules staine, earths vanity. O Sunne reflect thy gould on my pale Moone, And let this Dathans braunch be rooted soone, Out of this flourie isle: O let not this (So hideous a crime) eclipse the blisse VVhich Britaine now possesseth, may my penne, Be steeped now in wormewood, that such men As haue beene 'erst delighted, now may be, Wain'd from that land-oppressing miserie. And you (damn'd prostitutes) that pawn your name, Making a triuiall may-game of your shame; Bed-broaking lechers, Broakers of ill ware, For many such base factors now there are) Heare me spit out my malice: May you liue, Till you haue nought to take, nor none to giue, For your ore-iaded pleasure: may you stand Banisht for euer in this Fruitfull land, Which fares the worse (and that by Heauens high power) For giuing harbour to an odious whoore. May you detested liue, intestate die, And as I doubt not make your Tragedy By death more wofull: may your vlcerous skin, As it beares here the marks of your fowle sin: Like to the Iewes as they did earst appeare, Who in their fore-parts circumcised were) Be circumcis'd: that after times may shew, There was small difference twixt the whore and Iewe. And you poore haire brain'd youths that doe begin To nestle in these lothsome sinkes of sin; You that spend substance, heritance and all, Becomming subiect to a doubtfull fall: You that are sent to practise studious arts, But leauing them, betake to worser parts Your vnfledg'd fancies: heare me, and you'le say, It seemes he wisht vs well another day. Flie the strange woman, let her wanton looke, Be vnto you as some experientst booke; Prescribing cures for strange diseases bo As if you did not note, or did not see Her sin-alluring motiues: if she smile Conster it thus: this wanton would beguile With her affected seeming, if she play With her light capring foote, or bid you stay (So brazen fac't is sin) away from thence, Taxe, but affect not, her loth'd impudence. If she shew modestie (as well she may) For whoores haue change of faces euery daie Vieing new fashions: you may conster thus, It is a painted but no natiue blush. If she protest (beleeue not what she sayth)) For there's no whore but can dispense with faith: If she inuite you to some dainty feast Be not entreated, least like Circes beast, You be transform'd from that same forme diuine Vnto the bestiall nature of a swine, If she allure thee to some wanton sport In that she moues you to it, care not for't Let S?. foote be (such follies lust affoord) “For fairest play is euer aboue boord. Redart not eyes with her: if she looke red Say its her guilt, if pale distempored With some lasciuious passion: if conceipt Be pregnant in her, sweare its but deceipt To draw thee on: if sullen, it may be thought Her weight of sin has that distraction wrought. If she discourse, its but some whorish tale That she perchance has purchas't by retaile; If silent, 't may be thought she's plotting ill, And that's the cause her oily tongue is still: If seeming modest, vertuous or precise, Its her dissembling, making her lusts eyes Like Basilisks (who naturally haue Desire to kill, where they do seeme to saue.) If hope of meanes: fie, let no Generous minde, Stoope to so base a lure, as be inclin'de, To buy a stipend at so deare a rate, “As gage a soule, to get a little state. If discontent: this is no remedie Vnto thy griefe, but ads to miserie: For who (through discontent) goes to a Whoore, Must needs be more deiected then before. If an enforced marriage (as who can) Taste still the sweete of comforts, being man: This is no way to ease thy troubled head, To make thy selfe adulterize thy Bed. If to spend time: how ill is that spent time, Which adds vnto that great accompt of thine Thousands of accusations? where thy looke Shall beare record (if wanton) in that booke, Where all our actions duely written be From youth to man, to Age from infancy: If for acquaintance (as oftimes we heare) The greatest men are most acquainted there; Thou seeks amisse, for what's acquaintance worth, By birth borne great, to bastardise their birth.

HIS CATCH. The occasion of this Epigram proceeded from the restraint of the Author, who in the iustnes of his cause (like Zenophons Sparrow) fled for refuge: to the worthily esteemed, the Right Worshipfull Rich. Hvtton, Sergeant at Lawe: to whose protection the retired Author commends his Epigramme entitled. Singing my catch, if you be not my friend, For all my catch, I shall be catcht ith' end. Not in a durance suite remaine I here, Yet in a suite like durance hemm'd with feare Retir'd I am: confinement makes me thrall Vnto my selfe, which grieues me most of all: If I but see the shadow of a man, Or th' tinkling of a Braziers copper pan, I feare a Sergeant, shadow saies its he, And th' Brazier saies, such like his buttons be. Where shall I flie to? 'lasse I know not where: For Milford-lane is growne too monstrous deere. No, there I must not goe; for know you how That place is stil'd? The Gallants Rande-uou. Well, some-where I must flie: O now I see't: Philosophers say; heate is expel'd by heate. Moisture by moisture; Colds extremity By cold, deriu'd from passions natiuely Concurring in vs: if this then be trew, VVho should I flie to (Sir?) but vnto you That are a Sergeant, and has power to place Your God-sonne free from any Sergiants Mace? To you ile flie pursu'de by impudence, (A Courtiers garbe) crauing safe residence Vnder your wings: and know (kinde Sir) from me, To doe for Orphanes its a charity. Little I am possest of well you know, And of that little, little doe I owe To any man: yet for all this am I, Made a fit obiect for a Sergeants eie. I could not beg if that my cause were bad, But to disburse for that I neuer had. Nor anie for me, 'lasse it seemes to me, The cause might pleade it selfe without a fee. Pray Sir (at least) if'th Courtier needes will craue it. Let him pursue such, where 'has hope to haue it: For me theres none: but this his wit God wot To sue his bond, wheres nothing to be got. Yet for the reputation which I beare To my vnblemisht credit, I must feare Not our iust cause, nor any such pretence, But brazen-face, and guilded conscience. “For dangers felt are worse then others feard, “Which makes me now conceald which once appear'd. 'Lasse Sir, my studies cannot brooke restraint, “Since times obseruance giues me argument.

But Iustice whose pure eie lookes euer right, And can admit of none that cloudes her sight, Will shield my cause: its trues I know she will, Yet in meane time I am be-leagred still, With these iniurious burres, these tenterhookes, That euen afright me with their gastly looks. These engines of despaire, agents of euill, Factors for Mammon, Viceroyes for the diuell These that lay hold like bird lime: these be they, That must be soundly brib'd, or we must pay; I haue no hope then but your vertuous selfe To saue my crasie vessell from this shelfe, Or ship-wrack rather, and so sure am I Of your best helpe, that I see safety Appearing midst of daunger: for my trust So well repos'd in one that is so iust, Cannot be frustrate, but must needes receiue What you may graunt, and I may iustly haue. And well I know that actions of this kinde, Keepe best concordance with your generous minde, Whose natiue vertues haue been still exprest, In giuing breath to causes that are best.

Ibid.—Where say,— How Night by Night in seuerall roomes I lye, And that my lines haue farre more Aer then I. An Epigramme called the Honest Lawyer. Sprightly my muse, speake like the son of thunder And with a full mouth, ring out Albions wonder: No Sussex Dragon, no Virginian, But of a Lawer that's an Honest man. Whose definition if you wish to know, Is a blacke Swan, faire Moore, or milke-white Crow. He takes no fees, till he conceiue the cause, Nor with an Oyly bribe annoints his iawes. He wants the vse of feeling, feares Heauens curse, Strings not his conscience with his Clients purse. Hee'l not be tongue-tide, but for Iustice sake, He seekes to earne the mony he does take. He hates æquiuocation and delay, Nor will he make his Threed-bare Client stay For his dispatch: he will not haue his fee, Till he discusse the causes equity. His Iudgement will not vaile to wind nor wether, Nor is his conscience made of retching lether. His eye's on Iustice, nor will euer he Banke-rupt his soule, t'enrich posterity. His tongue's no time-obseruer, made to please, His fist is shut from taking double fees. He will not forge a lye, nor wrest the sence, Of law or right, for any faire pretence. He will not backe his Clyent, or maintaine An vniust suit, to reape a priuate gaine. He speakes and stands too't, nor is sorry for't, Though he by speaking truth, incense the Court. He hates corruption, nor has euer sould, His peace of Conscience, for a peece of gold He loues no perfumes, nor is one of those, Whose peak't mouchatoes skirmish with their nose, His beard's not starcht, he has no subtile sconce, Nor Ianus-like lookes he ten waies at once. His Eare is neuer shut to poore mens mones, His Coach-wheele is not made of Clients bones, His Conscience nere did ought that needs relenting Or For my pretty tooth-picker, the Criticke Lawyer, who stands on the puntylio of his honour, I am by Martialls meanes prouided of armour.

His soule was neuer soild by corrupt dealing, Nor stands he on a veluet gowne at sealing. His face was nere at Braziers, nor his skin Sy-sambris-like was hung vp to be seene. His tongue speakes truth, makes peace where ere he can. This Lawer must be needs an honest man. It's true, he must: but where now shall we finde This man: I feare theres none left of his kind. Yes one I know, and more there be no doubt But that my dull pate cannot find them out, Who's truely honest: Whom you may discerne, You Clients you, that visit this throng Terme, By no example in our Albion more, Then by my Patron in my Catch before.

If a rich country-Boore come to present him, With Pigge or Goose, he shall no sooner come, But the gate's open, and the Knight's at home, Where the Dog-fawning Knight will question him, Why he from's house has so long absent beene? Yet tother day, a Poet whom he lou'd, At least protested so; knocking at's gate, Was full two houres enforced there to waite, And still he staid to find his loue approu'd, Till th' Brazen head spake, through a casement mou'd, (The Knight I meane) but seeing who it was, I'me not at home (quoth he) good Poet passe. An Epigram in Curium Lampetram: A Cashierd Courtier. Cvrius Lampetra, (as he doth confesse) For he was t'ane i'th nicke, o'th businesse, Ha's done, soone done, God wot, a worthy deede, Setting the Courts wreath on the Cities head: But for his wreath, before one Terms demurre, He was degraded of his Courtly spurre. (True badge of Honour) and from that time swore, Nere to approach the Cities confines more. What should he doe? the Citie was his gaine, For poore Lampetra nere had courtly straine; But apish imitation, whose small force Made him admired, like an Hobby-horse. And yet they say, he had a wit at will: Running like the rundell of a blind horse-mill. Could sweare an oath, could fome at mouth could set His words in fustian, and could runne in debt, Could skrew his face, could moralize a fable, Yet nere read Æsop, sit at Duke Humfreys Table, Could walke a turne in Paules, could talke of Spaine, Yet nere was there, and then come home againe. Why this is courtly, and this he could doe, Yea but Lampetra knew not how to woe. Not wooe? why he could kisse, and as they sing I'th ballad too, he could doe tother thing. “A Pox thats true: But shall I tell thee why She told all out? he did so scuruily: “As at the very instant when theyre taine, Shee said (poore foole) put vp thy pipe againe, For such a Fidler is farre worse then none, That plaies on still, yet has no stroake but one. But prethee say, what shall Lampetra doe? (As other Courtiers) make a foolish show Of what they haue not: no, it is decreed, Being boorish bred, he must with boores goe feede On huskes and hawes; and that he may retaine Some courtly garbe, his ruins to maintaine Ith Country must this rusticke swaine be plast, To purchase pardons, when the iudgement's past: Or he may finde a Giant at S?

An Epigram vpon the Anagram, Dedicated to the Mirrour of true Excellency, his much admired (though vnacquainted) friend, Don Moriano dell Castello To whom the Author wishes many cheerfull daies, delightfull nights with his late espoused Mistresse, whose imparalelld Vertues hee hath presumed to illustrate in These his impolisht (yet affectionate) Poems. Morios Augustus thou great man of sense, That art enstil'd with best of Excellence. To thee I write: yet doe I not know how, T'expresse thy worth, or with apparant show, Of thy demerits blaze thee as thou should, Yet know (braue northerne spirit) that I would, Doe full as much as any, if my Art Were but of equall valew with my heart. For thou art he amongst all other men, That giues a subiect to the freest pen, And canst define true honour by degree, Drawne from the best, yet instanced in thee. Mount thee (resolued Heroe) that thy Fame, May be a wreath to Morianos Name. Shine bright, like Eos with his beamy face, Whose pretious Mantle, fring'd with some gold lace, Made all the passengers admire his worth, Descending from Heauens Court, to lighten earth. I know thou canst doe this, for I haue seene Euen in a place, where many more haue beene, And haue obseru'd thee, galloping thy round, Making low Congees, till thou kisse the ground VVith lip of thy humility, and then Putting thy foote in stirrop once againe, Mounted thy barbed steed, then with thy hand, Straking thy horses crest to make him stand. VVho proud on's burden, frolick'd in his stay, And with a neighing stomacke trac'd the way. Faire fall thee formall Gallant that hast force, To tame the courage of a head-strong horse, Displaying resolution in thy eye Courtship in cloths, in speech propriety. In gesture admiration, in thy looke An Orbe of fashions, or a Table-booke. Of new-inuented features, in thy forme, Such exquisite perfections as adorne Natures best Mirror, O but that I doubt, By speaking of thy worth, I shall be out. I could epitomize each speciall thing, Thy birth, thy worth, thy wooing, sonnetting. Yet for thy loue sake (whatsoere befall) I will speake somthing, though I speake not all. Mongst which my Muse records that amorous sonnet VVhich who will not admire, that looks vpon it, VVrit to that faire Alicia now behight, The chast-vow'd wife vnto an honor'd Knight: Where with loues passions, thou so well did show it, That none could thinke thee lesser then a Poet, Apt in thy words, in thy dimensions rare, Thy Figures proper, and thy motions faire. Art could not show, or euer yet bring forth, So farre fetcht straines inuented so farre North. Now of her Beauty wouldst thou Comment make, And vow to take strange labours for her sake: Then to induce her loue (by meanes most fit) Thou wouldst commend the promptnes of her wit, Protesting by the aery powers aboue, (As who ere lou'd, would not protest they loue?) Noe speech ere Pallas spake merits more praise, Then what thy Mistresse Dere Alicia saies. Then wouldst thou descant of her rubie lippe, (Though thou had neuer lucke to tast of it.) Then of her pure complexion which did praise It selfe, not as complexions now adaies. Then of her louely quallities which might be Styled the Eccoes of heauens harmonie. Then of her vertues so diuine, so rare, As they surpast the rest aboue compare. All this thou didst to shew her eminence, More grac't by thee being stil'd his excellence, And faire thy loue had ended as begun, If that a Web had not thy loues web spun. Great Northerne Atlas, what can I say more, Then of thy merits hath been said tofore. At least obseru'd? for many men doe see, And know it well I write but truth of thee. O that times records should be so portraide, In leaues of brasse, that what was done or said, In auncient ages, should so well display, Their full euents, as done but t'other day. Whilest thy renowme great mirrour of the North, Showne in our time, wants one to set it foorth, “VVhereas its no lesse glory to a Crowne, To haue Authors then haue Actors of renowne, Yet shall not vertue so obscured bee, Nor those accomplisht parts appeare in thee. Lie rak't in Ashes: No great Morios heire, Thou shalt not liue as though there nothing were, VVorthy posterity? its I will write, Though far vnfitting for so great a light My best of thee, that art the best of man, “He does not ill that does the best he can. Accept it needes thou must, how er't be done, Being thy Fathers God-sonne, thou his sonne. But of all vertues that attend on thee, There's none that equals thy humilitie. Yet so as thou art generous with all, A stile that does adorne thee most of all. Vnto thy humble spirit annex't there is, Another soueraigne vertue, Patience; Or the enduring of an iniurie: Which of all others is obseru'd in thee. Thou wilt not snuffe if one correct thee: no, Nor hardly aske him why he wrong'd thee so. Thou wilt not answere to thine owne disgrace, Nor taxe the man that turdefies thy face. Thou wilt not grieue for euery light offence, Feare is thy guide, thy shield is Patience. Thou like a christian walkes (God wot) in feare, And being boxt will turne the other eare. Thou art Gods man, and whatsoe're men say, He is the best man at the later day. Thou art no blustring boy that walkes the streete, And bindes a quarrell with who s'ere he meete. Thou art no Haxtar that by nature's giuen, To rage on Earth, but nere to raigne in Heauen. In briefe, thou art the man that God will chuse, VVearing a blade for fashion more then vse. Nor doe I flatter thee for ne're was I Seruile to anie man: but if my eie Impartiall in her knowledge seeme to show, VVhat by obseruance other men doe know, And haue admir'd, pardon I neede not craue, Since I expresse but what thy merits haue Deseru'd: enough. Thy vertues are with best, And little need they to be more exprest, Then as they are? Goe on (my honourd friend) And as thou hast begun, so fairely end. Be Fame thy Herauld to blaze forth thy worth, Making thee Morios, none such vpon earth. Be as thou art, and more thou canst not be, Since best of being is included in thee. Be thou as hee, to whom all may resort, Muses I meane, and coming thank thee for't. Be thou as Cæsar in the Capitall, So thou of Morios Castell Centinell. Be as thou art reported, great in wit, And so discreet, as thou mai'st mannage it. Be as thou art, founder of iollitie, Grauen in the gold-cup of our Langanbie. Be as thou would'st be, and I wish no more, So time shall second what I write before. But 'lasse poore Muse hast thou no more to speake Of such a subiect, (pray thee deare awake) And memorise his name in euery page, From this time forth vnto a following age. No? what is my wit drawne drie? or I am tane VVith some amazement at a great mans name? VVhy thou hast writ of men as great before, And hast exprest their actions ore and ore. Turn'th ore their best of glory, and i'th end, So won their hearts, as thou becamst their friend. And art thou now growne silent? cannot he That merits best, receiue like praise of thee? No, no: he cannot; so obscur'de he liues, That though I write but truth, yet who belieues A true relation, when we seeme to show A man to men whom they doe hardly know? O then (redoubted sir) let me now end This home bred Sonnet (as a louing friend That would perswade) if you perswad' would be To shew your selfe something more openlie Vnto the world. O see how men repine, That you so long conceal'd, should gull the time, Hauing such parts, as much adorne your birth, Yet has no willing mind to set them forth. VVhat is a Iewell worth if euer hid? Or whats a cased Instrument in stead? The lustre of the former is not seene, Nor can we know by'th latter what't does meane. For Gemmes and instruments are knowne by tutch, And such as show them men, we know them such. VVith like goodwill doe I present thee these, As Mopsus (that poor shepard) sent a cheese Vnto his Phillis: and it came to me Once in my minde, to send the like to thee: But for I fear'd (and I haue cause to feare) That you had better cheese then any here: In steed of bride-cakes, cheesecakes I was tide In loue, to send this present to your Bride. All haile to Himen and this marriage day: Strow rushes, and quickly come away. Bring in your flowers, and giue of each of them To such as lov'd, and are forsaken men For well I know so louing is the Bride, So curteous and so liberall beside Of her discreete affection, I dare say None must depart vnsatisfied away. Strew rushes maides, and euer as you strew, Thinke one day maides, like will be done for you: Strew you, Ile sing, or if you like not choise; Sing you, Ile strew: you haue the better voice. Crowned be thou Queene of loue, By those glorious powers aboue: Loue and Bewtie ioyn'd together May they col and kisse each other, And in midst of their delight, Shew thee pleasure in the night. For where acts of loue resort, Longest nights seeme too too short; May thou sleeping dreame of that, Which then waking dest partake, That both sleepe and watching may Make the darkest night seeme day: As a fort besieged rest, Yeelding most, when seeming lest: Or in pleasures may thy smile Burnish like the Camomile, Which in verdure is encrest Most, when it is most deprest. Vertues as they doe attend thee, So may soueraigne thoughts defend thee. Acting in thy loue with him, Wedlocks actions are no sinne: Who in Hymens bands is ioyned, And in sacred loue combined, To remaine euer thine. He thy Picture thou his shrine, Thou the mettall he the mint, Thou the waxe he the print, He the Lant-horne, thou the lampe, Thou the bulloine, he the stampe. Thou the figure he the feature; He thy former, thou his creature. He the image, legge and limme, Thou the mould to cast him in. He the plummet thou the center. Thou to shelter he to enter; Thou the Parke or shady vale, “He the dogge that freth's the pale. Hammer he to strike alone, An uile thou to beate vpon: More I could, but more I will not, Since to speake more much it skils not; Onely I will here extend Th' period of my speech as friend: And expresse what I protest Comes from th' center of my brest, That my protestations may Beare record another day. Iö Hymen crowne the night Of these Nuptials with delight. No more, no more: much honour aie betide, The lofty Bride-groome, and the louely Bride: That their succeeding dayes and yeeres may say, Each day appeares like to a mariage day. But now retire, darke shades haue lodg'd the sun, Put vp thy pipes for now thy layes are done. Finis Epithalami. To the hopefull young Gentleman, and his experienced friend, M?. Cheater. Anagramm. TEACHER. Teacher you are, for you haue taught me more, Then I was taught in all my life before. A GRATVLATORY Epigram. To thee (young youth) these youngling lines I write Stor'd with my best of wishes: may delight Crowne that long-wisht for Nuptial bed of thine, (Which should haue been) if Fate had granted mine With many happy nights: Blest be my fate, Since what one friend has is communicate Vnto an other, that my loue should end, And ending, giue beginning to my friend. But why say I its ended? sith by thee, A three-loues song beares descant merily. And thus it is: I lou'd her, where thou art, Shee thee, thou mee; three louers in one heart: Shee thine, thou mine (if mine thou stil'd may be) Makes her in being thine, espows'd to me. An Embleme which the Author composed in honour of his Mistris, to whom he rests euer deuoted. Allusiuely shadowing her name in the title of the Embleme, which hee enstiles: His Frankes Anatomie. Franke thy name doth promise much, If thy nature were but such: But alasse what difference growe 'Twixt those two, I onely know? I alas that to thy bewtie Am deuoted in all dewtie; I that once inuented layes, Singing them in Shepheards praise, I that once from loue was free Till I fell in loue with thee: I that neuer yet began Trade, to hold my mistris fan; I that neuer yet could knowe, Whether loue was high or lowe: I that neuer loued was, Nor could court a looking-glasse: I that neuer knew loues lawe, Nor lov'd longer then I sawe; I that knew not what's now common, To throw sheep-eyes at a woman: I that neuer yet could proue, Or make shew of heartie loue: I that neuer broke my sleepe, Nor did know what charms did keepe Louers eyes: now can tell What would please a louer well. Shall I tell thee? yes I will, And being tolde: or saue, or kill. It would please him, if he might Euer liue in's Mistris fight: It would please him t'haue the hap, But to sleep in's Mistris lap: Or to haue his Mistris faire, VVith her hand to stroke his haire. Or to play at foot-S?. with him, Or at barly-breake to breathe him: Or to walke a turne or two, Or to kisse, or coll, or woe; Or in some retired Groue, But to parly with his Loue. Or when none that's iealous spies, To looke babbies in his eyes: Or when action ginnes to fayle, To supply it with a tale. Venus vnto Vulcane wedde, Yet came Mars to Vulcanes bedde: He and she being both in one, Whilest poore Vulcan lies alone; Or if this will not affoord Ioy enough: obserue each bird How she singles out her make And to him does onely take. See their billing each with other, (Loue and dallying younc't together) Mutuall loue inheres in either, Being birds both of one feather; Or if this yeeld no content. To resort vnto the plant, Which being grafted skilfully, Brings forth fruit aboundantly: Deeper that the plant's we see, Sooner will it fruitfull be, Which (my franke) in modesty, Thus I will apply to thee. Deeper that thy loue is set, More impression may it get: Riper fruits then such as growe, And are planted scarce so lowe: If you aske me what I seeme, By impression for to meane, I will tell thee: such as these, Impressions onely women please. “Coine for stampe sake we allowe: So for stampe sake do we you, Weake's that Euidence you know That has neither seale to showe, Stampe, impression: such (I ken) Are you maydes, not stampt by men Weake, God wot, for why you take Your perfection from your make: Then if thou desire to be Perfect, haue recours to me: Or some other that may giue, What old Adam gaue to Eue, 'Lasse its nothing: pray thee take it, Many wish it that forsake it, But when shamefull dance is done, They could wish they had begun Many yeeres before they learnt it. (O how gladly would they earne it?) But too long, I seeme to stay, Ere thy beauty I display: Spare me sweetest for my Muse, Seldome makes so faire a chuse. Chuse it Lou what ere it be, Reade thy owne Anatomie. Purest of Ophyr-gold, let me prepare First for the choice description of thy hayre, Which like the finest thrids of purple seeme Clere to out-strip those of the Paplian Queene; Whose tender tresses were so neatly wrought, As Cholcos fleece seem'd to be thither brought, And sure it was, what ere fond Poets say, And this was th' fleece which Iason tooke away. Delicious Amber is the breath which flowes From those perfumed conduits of thy nose, Thy smile, a snare, which tempts the way-ward boy Adon the faire, and bids him leaue to ioy In Forrest pleasures, there's a fruitlesse marke, Hauing more store of game within thy parke. Thy lippes (two gates) where loue makes entrie in, And yet so modest as nere taxt of sinne: Thy cheek, that rosie circlet of pure loue, Resembling neerest that Castalian groue; Where such variety of flowers appeare That nought seems good, which is not beter'd there. Thy blush (pure blush) Embleme of Chastitie Blushing, yet guiltlesse of ought done by thee Portends a maidens honest-spotlesse heart, Hauing thy blush by nature not by Art. Thy chin (that dimpled mount) which hath last place Yet giues no lesser bewty to thy face: Then th' greatest ornament: for it doth show, Like to a pleasant Vale seated belowe Some sleepy Mount: thy christall eyes the fount, Thy chin the Vale, thy louely face the Mount. O is not then this feature, boue compare, Where breath is perfume, and pure gold is hayre Where smiles are snares, lippes gates of Iuorie, Cheekes roses, blushes types of chastitie: Where chin a vale, the browe the mount, the face That Soueraigne of the heart, that keeps loues place: VVhere shall I looke then, or how shall I moue These eyes of mine and teach them not to loue? For if my eyes should but thy haire beholde, I must be forc't to loue for it is golde: If thy delicious breath I chaunce to sip, Being the rosie verdure of thy lip; I deeme my selfe in that sweet perfume blest Much more, in that, worse breaths be in request: If thou do smile, I loue, and wish the while, That I might only liue to see thee smile. If thou do speake (pure Orator) I'me dumb, For why? thy admiration curbs my tongue. If thou but blush (as maydes are wont to doe) My passions are perplex'd, I wot not how, 'Twixt feare and loue: feare makes me wondrous pale, Fearing thy blush came from some wanton tale. Too too immodest spoken by my selfe, Which to assoyle Ile reprehend my selfe; If I but tutch, to tutch's a veniall sin, The pretty circle of thy dimpled chin; I vowe and in my vowe giues Bewtie thanks, That chin was Uenus, though it now be Franks. Yet haue I not spoke all that I doe see; Or at least iudge in thy Anatomie: For true Anatomists being men of Art, Know the exact description of each part, Member and arterie: so should my sight Be in my Franke if I describe her right, Which that I might reduce to some full end, Though there's no end in loue, I will descend To the distinct relation of the rest, And in my Franks discouery thinke me blest. Thy waste, (without waste) like a curious frame, Aptly proportion'd still reserues the same: Or like some well composed Instrument Exact in forme, in accent excellent; So is thy waste, and happy may he be, That's borne to make it strike true harmony. Thy belly (if coniectures true may be) For we must guesse at that we cannot see, Is like an orient Cordon pearled faire, With diuerse feats of Nature here and there. Where glides a christall streameling to abate, The heate of Nature oft insatiate. Pardon me Deere: Nature ordained first That Fount of yours, to quench the place of thirst. Thy thigh (imagination now must doe) For I must speake, though well I know not how, Like the laborious and the loaden Bee, That hastens to her hiue melodiously. Nor is her freight more luscious (Deere) then thine, For thine is full of pleasure, hers of Thyme: Thy knee like to an orbe that turnes about, Giuing free passage to thy nimble foote, Apt for each motion, actiue in loues sphere, Moouing her ioints to trip it euery where. Thy legge (like Delias) neither bigge nor small, But so well fram'd and featured in all, That Nature might seeme enuious to impart, So great a good, and hide so good a part. Thy foote the curioust module of the rest, For Art and Nature there be both exprest: Art in the motion, Nature in the frame, Where action works and motion moues the same. Nor can I credite what our Poets say, Affirming Venus chanc't vpon a day To pricke her foote, so as from th' blood she shed, The damaske-rose grew euer after red; For if from blood such strange effects should be, Stanger (ere this) had been deriu'd from thee: But Poets though they write, Painters portray, It's in our choice to credit what they say. Yet credit me (for I would haue thee know it) I neuer yet durst challenge name of Poet: Onely thine owne I am and still will be, For whom I writ this poore Anatomie. Upon his Mistris Nuptiall, ENSTILED: His Frankes Farewell. Why whither Franke? to th' church? for what to pray? O no: to say, what thou canst nere vnsay: Alasse poore Girle: I see thy quondam friend, Hath cause to say his hopes are at an end: How vainely then be our affections plaste, On women-kinde, that are so seeming chaste, And priuately so forward-well-be gone, (If ere I marry) I'le finde such an one, As (in her modesty) will thinke't disgrace Others to loue when I am out of place. But I do thank thee Franke, th' hast taught me more, Then I could learne in twice seauen yeere before; For I did thinke your simple sexe did hate By double dealing to equiuocate: Where by experience now I finde it common, That fast and loose is vsuall with women. Yet in these rites this line my loue shall tell, Fare well or ill, I wish my Franke farewell. An Epigramme called the Wooer. Come yee braue wooers of Penelope, Doe not repine that you should crossed be: For pregnant wits, and ripest braines can show, As much or more then euer you did know. And that my storie better may appeare, Attend to my discourse, and you shall heare. It chanc't vpon a time (and then was'th time) When the thigh-fraughted Bee gathered her thyme, Stored her platted Cell, her fragrant bower, Crop't from each branch, each blossom &amp; each flower When'th pretty Lam-kin scarce a fortnight old, Skipped and froliked 'fore the neighbouring fold, When'the cheerfull Robin, Larke and Lenaret, Tun'de vp their voices, and together met, When'th fearefull Hare to cheere her quaint delight, Did make her selfe her owne Hermaphrodite, When th' louely Turtle did her eies awake, And with swift flight follow'd her faithfull make, When euery Beast prepar'd her wonted den, For her owne young, and shade to couer them, When Flora with her mantle tucked vp, Gathred the dewie flow'rs, and them did put In her embrodred skirts which were rancke set, With Prime-rose, Cow-slip, and the violet, The dill, the dasie, sweet breath'd Eglantine, The Crowfoote, pausie, and the Columbine, The pinke, the plantaine, milfoile, euery one, With Mari-gold that opens with the Sunne; Euen then it was, (ill may I say it was) VVhen young Admetus woed a countrey lasse, A countrie lasse whom he did woe indeede, To be his Bride, but yet he could not speede. VVhich forc't him grieue: heare but his cause of woe, And you'le not wonder why he should doe so? Vertuous the maide was, and so grac't by fate, As she was wise, and did degenerate From her weake witted father: modesty Lodg'd on her cheeke, and showd virginity In a faire Rosie colour, which was spread By equall mixture both of white and red. So as no white it seem'd, but Idas snow, No red, but such where Roses vse to grow And though of Hero many one doe write, Styling her soueraigne Goddesse of delight, So faire as she was taken for no other, Of all that saw her, then Adonis mother. So pure her skin, so motiue to the eie, As it did seeme compos'd of Iuorie. So high and broad her front, so smoth, so euen, As it did seeme the Frontispice of Heauen. So purely mixt her cheekes, as it might seeme, She was by nature made for natures Queene. So pretty dinted was her dimpled chin, As't seem'd a gate to let affection in. So sweete her breath, (as I haue hard them tell) That like to Cassia she did euer smell. So louely were those mounts of pure delight, That Gods themselues wer cheered with their sight: So as great Ioue (for so our Poets say) Fain'd himselfe sicke for her vpon a day. Wise Æsculapius he was sent forthwith, VVho felt Ioues pulse, yet found no signe of death, Or any great distemper: (yet to please Ioue For he perceiu'd his malady was loue) Said; Sir, I'aue found your grief: what i'st (quoth he?) A meere consumption, yet be rul'd by me, And follow my directions (though with paine) And then no doubt you shall be well againe. Fiue mornes must you to' Abidoes towne repaire, And suck pure milke from th' fair'st virgin there. Ioue hearing what he wisht, obey'd bis hest; And war soone well by sucking Heroes brest. Yet what was Hero, though the fair'st that was In all her time vnto Admetus lasse? Though Heroes beuty did allure all men, The time is chang'd, now's now, and then was then. Each milk-maide in fore time was thought a Queen, So rare was perfect bewty to be seene. But now, where is no Venus to be had? Such store I wot there be, thet euery lad Can haue his tricksie lasse, which wantonlie, Scarce crept from shell, he dandles on his knee. But to my storie of such royall parts VVas she composed, that the very hearts Of her attendants, as it did apeare, VVere spous'd to this pure virgin euery vvhere, VVith what resolued silence would her wit, Oppose her tongue, and seeme to bridle it? VVith what discretion would she speake her minde, And nere transgesse those limits she assign'd. But with that decencie of grace and speech, As She might seeme the elder sort to teach. “VVhat a blest sexe were woman if this song VVere onely learnt them, for to hold their tongue, And speake no more (O t'were a lesson good) Then that were fit, and what they vnderstood? But when will that be taught them! O (I feare) Neuer; for womens tongues be euery where. So as at first, if they had no tongue, It may be thought they would not haue been dumb. Such is th' ternall motion that its sayd, When women speechlesse lie they're neerly dead. This virgin which Admetus sought to haue, Beside her vertues, then which who could craue, A better portion, had an ample dowre, VVhich did enrich those gifts that were before Expressed and dilated, and to tell The very trueth, she lou'd Admetus well. And could haue brook't all others t'haue denide, So that she might haue been Admetus bride. But he a shamefast lad, though oft he sought Her loue, yet durst not vtter what he thought. Nor to her parents could impart his minde, How he affected was, and how inclinde. Yet still was he respected, and in grace, Nor any sought to put him out of place. Nor to withdraw th' affection of the maid, From that foundation where it once was laid For three months space, hung it in this suspence, Neither conceald nor showne: till's Excellence, For so was th' Title of a noble Squire, Whose liuing bordered in th' adioyning shire, By an intendment (as he thought vpon't) Put poore Admetus nose quite out of ioynt, And thus it was: for I meane to repeat By what deceit, what cunning slight and cheat, He bobd this simple Swaineling; on a day, When young Admetus had addrest his way To Troinouant, where he occasion had, “His Excellence in th' absence of the ladde, Acquaints another with Bellinaes loue, (For so her name was:) he more prompt to moue Affection, then Admetus ere could be, VVins me Bellina's fort couragiously, By new assaults, incursions, and displaid His youngling Colours: when the breach was made. O how methinks I see th' young Souldier sweat, Till he hath done, and perfected his fear. How he assailes, assaults, ascends, inclines, Inuades, inuirons, ruines, vndermines, VVhil'st she like to a Fort opprest doth lye, Depriu'd all meanes of helpe, yet will not crye. He like a stout victorious Hanniball, Bidding her yeeld, or he will raze the wall. She though made subiect to his conquering hand, Like Carthage Queene still at defiance stands. He (with the Spirit of a Mirmidon,) Makes her the Carpet which he lies vpon. She (Deianira-like) will chuse death first, Ere she craue mercy, bids him doe his worst. He enters th' breach, and doth his signall rere, And leaues some token that he has beene there: She glories in her conquest, and throwne downe, Saies, I am low, yet am not ouercome. He doth renew his battery, and stands too't, And she Vyrago-like, yeelds not a foote. He takes more firmer grounding, yet is she Still as she was, lower she cannot be. He plants his Engines deeper, labours more, Yet she protests, its worse then twas before. He enters parlye, and speakes ore the wall, But she (as sencelesse) answers not at all. He sounds retreat, and to his campe doth creepe, Which makes her wake out of her pleasant sleepe. Then in a sweete entwining doe they clippe, And cull and kisse, and from the rosie lippe Of Hymens chast embraces doe they tast, The sweets aboue, when lower ioyes be past. Heere is the spell of sweet-charmd Morphus Dissolu'd to nothing, by charmes amorous. For though men (after Labour) rest doe seeke, Loues eyes be open still, and cannot sleepe. Iudge what Admetus thought when he did heare, Of this report, soone whispered in his eare, How he did looke? how strange perplext he was, Thus to bee cheated of his louely lasse? Pipe could he not, his cheeks were growne so thinne, His pipe-bagge torne, no wind it could keepe in, His cloue-ear'd curre lay hanging downe his head, And for foure dayes, would tast no kind of bread. His Flockes did pine (all went contrary way) Heere lay Admetus, there his Sheep-crooke lay, All wea-begane, thus liu'd the Shepheard long, Till on a day inspired with a song, (For so it seem'd) to others more then me, Which thus he sung to maids inconstancy. Foolish I, why should I grieue, To sustaine what others feele? VVhat suppose, fraile women leaue, Those they lou'd, should I conceale Comforts rest, From my brest. For a fickle, brittle woman, Noe, Noe, Noe, Let her goe, Such as these be true to no man. Long retired hast thou beene, Sighing on these barren rocks, Nor by sheepe nor shepheard seeene, Now returne vnto thy flockes, Shame away, Doe not stay, With these mouing-louing woman, The remoue From their loue: Such as these doe oft vndoe men. Tender-tinder of Affection, If I harbour thee againe, I will doe it by direction, Of some graue experienc't swaine. Nere will I, Loue by th' eye, But where iudgement first hath tride, If I liue, Ere to loue, It is she, shall be my bride. When this retired Swaine had end'd his song, He seem'd as one that had forgot his wrong, His Teres were dried vp, his willow wreath, Throwne quite away, and he began to breath, More cheerefull and more blith then ere he was, Forgetting th' Name and Nature of his lasse, So as no Swaine on all the plaine could be, For any May-game readier then he: Now would he tune his pipe vnto his Eare, And play so sweet, as ioyed the flocks to heare, Yea I haue heard, (Nor thinke I Fame did lye) So skilfull was this lad in Minstrelsie, That when he plaid (one stroke) which oft he would, No Lasse that heard him could her water hold. And now because I doe remember't well, Ile tell a tale which I haue heard him tell, On winter-nights full oft vnto my Sire, While I sat rosting of a Crab by th' fire. A Man there was wh' had liu'd a merry life, Till in the end, he tooke him to a wife, One that no image was (for she could speake) And now and then her husbands costrell break. So fierce she was and furious, as in some She was an arraut Deuill of her tongue. This droue the poore man to a discontent, And oft and many times did he repent That ere he chang'd his former quiet state, But las repentance, then did come too late. No cure he finds to heale this maladie, But makes a vertue of necessity. The common cure for care to euery man, A potte of nappy Ale: where he began To fortifie his braine 'gainst all should come, 'Mongst which the clamor of his wiues loud tongue. This habit graffed in him grew so strong, “That when hee was from Ale, an houre seem' along, So well he lik'd th' profession: on a Time, Hauing staid long at pot, (for rule nor line Limits no drunkard) euen from Morne to Night, He hasted home apace, by the moone-light: Where as he went, what phantasies were bred, I doe not know, in his distempered head. But a strange Ghost appear'd (and forc'd him stay) With which perplext, he thus began to say. Good Spirit, if thou be, I need no charme, For well I know, thou wilt not doe me harme, And if the Deuill; sure, me thou shouldst not hurt, I wed'd thy sister, and am plagued for't. The spirit well-approuing what he said, Dissolu'd to ayre, and quickly vanished. For Guido saith, some spirits walke on earth, That cheered are, and much delight with mirth, Such doe admire conceits and pregnant brayues; Others there are, which Melancholy chaines, And keepes in low Subiection, these are they Affect the balefull night, frequent that way That is obscure, silent and intricate, Darke charnell-houses, where they keep their chat, Of Tortures, Tragicke ends and Funeralls, Which they solemnize for their Festiualls. Thus would Admetus passe the winter-night, Wherein he gaue such neighbours great delight, As came to heare him: and such store he had, Of quaint conceits, as there was not a ladde, That of discourse had more variety, Or could expresse his mind more gracefully. But lacke for sorrow, how hee's fallen away, That was so trim a youth but tother day, A meere Anatomy, but skin and bone, One that it pitties me to looke vpon. What should the cause be, sure I cannot say, But his pale face, some sicknesse doth bewray? “For as our thoughts are legible in our eye, “So doth our face our bodies griefe descry. Yet I perchance, by th' Sonnet which hee made, May find the cause for which he is dismaide How ere it fall, it shall be sung by me, Now when I want Admetus company. Admetus Sonnet. Neighbour Swaines and Swainelins heare me, “Its Admetus bids you heare, Leaue your Pastures, and come neere mee, “Come away you need not feare, By my soule, as I affect you, I haue nought that can infect you. O then come, Heare a tongue, That in discord keepes a part, With a Woe-surcharged heart. Nere was Swaine on plaine more loued, Or could doe more feats then I, Yet one griefe hath now remoued, All my whilome iollity. All my Laies be quite forgotten, Sheepe-hooke broken, pipe-bagge rotten, O then come, Heare a tongue. That with flattering speech doth call, To take long farewell of all. I am not as once I was, When Eliza first did suite me, Nor when that same red-hair'd lasse, Faire Bellina did inuite me, To a Garden there to play, Cull, kisse, clip, and toy all day, O then come, Heare a tongue, That inwooing termes was flowing, But through Wo has spoil'd his woing. All I can or will desire ye When my breath of life is spent, That in loue you would interre me, (For it will my soule content,) Neare vnto my Fathers hearse, And bestow some comely verse On my Tombe, Then my tongue Shall throb out this last adeu, Nere were truer swaines then you. A verse Admetus? I will be the swaine, Though most vnfit, to vndertake that paine, Which in faire letters shall engrauen be, Ouer thy hearse t'expresse thy memory, And thus it is: Heere is a Shepheard layd, Who lou'd, was lou'd, yet liu'd and died a Maid. Yet gainst his will: pray then good spirits tell, Whether he must or no lead Apes in Hell. How Fancie is a Phrensie. An Epigram. And thou In Euenum Flumen lubrico pregrediens cursu, ?????? ???????????. Euenus whose renowm's disperst, About those fertile coasts which border thee, Whose well-tun'd Current runs so pretily, That Fame her selfe, nor shall it be reuerst, Ha's thus enacted: that thy liquid brest Should make my consort vp, for there appeares Euen in thine eyes, continuing streames of teares. Still may thy Sliding-foord, and spacious course, Wash those adioyning vales encircle thee, Which by thy meanes yeeld crops so fruitfully, That thy pure sand may be of Ganges force, Golds pure Elixir: for thou hast remorse, And pitties my hard hap to loue a swaine, That hates my loue, and makes my sute in vaine, Oft by thy Sliding Channell haue I stood, Bathing my selfe in teares, teares were the drinke, That quench't my thirst, &amp; wh? thou seem'd to sink, Into some hollow cauerne, streight my blood, “(That little bloud I had) made thy course good. And sinke into the Cesternes of mine eyes, Filling thy streams with teares, thy banks with cries, Streight fell I downe vpon thy floury shore, As if the shore had beene my mistris brest, Where I a while conceau'd that sweetned rest, As it expell'd the care I felt before, Seeming to make my comforts so much more, Because so long delay'd; but lasse the while, My thoughts chekt me, I chekt my thoghts of guile. For well I found, this was a goulden dreame, Yet but a Dreame, that seem'd to represent, Vnto mine eyes, that sacred Continent, Which shadowes my content: but this has beene, Euer most true, Dreames are not as they seeme. And if they were, I'me sure they mist in this, Taking thy Banke for where my mistres is. Oft did I cull, and clip, and kisse, and doe, God wot, full madly, for reposing there, I call'd the grasse, the tresses of her haire: And bound it vp, yet well I knew not how, Making a bracelet on't, which I would show To euery Sheepheard, so distract'd was I, And euery rurall Syluane that past by. All this thou saw, and thou did pitty me, “For thy distreaming teares explan'd no lesse, Surcharged brests must needs their greefes expresse, Which once exprest; suppressed seeme to be: “Teares unto griefe, yeeld soueraignst remedy. For Teares doe silence greefe, but where appeares Extent of griefe, there griefs doe silence teares. And such were mine: sometimes I could not weep, But like one sence-lesse, laughed at my distresse, Mixing a straine of Mirth with heauinesse, Or as one casten in a deadly sleepe, That neither sence nor faculty can keepe, Euen such was I: but streight I chang'd my song, Making my ioyes short, but my sorrowes long. Her fancie was the phrensie that surprisd My idle brain with these distracted passions, Ten thousand shapes I had, ten thousand fashions, Despising, louing, loue where I despisd'e, Prising her most, where I was lowest pris'de. Thus my affections to distractions turn'd, Made me mourne more then louer euer morn'd, And Reason too: for some I had, my Friends, (At least they seem'd so) which contemnd my griefe Nor sought to yeeld my silly heart releefe, With one poore comfort, but as diuers ends, Occasion strange effects; so Loue depends (If I may call inconstant Friendship Loue,) On Fortune heere below, not truth aboue. Let mee vnrippe my sorrowes, that my brest May void such Scarabees, that vse to sit Vpon each vlcer: whose contagious witte, Is worse then Hellebore, for they infest The purest Mansion, louing euer lest Where they show most Affection, for their straine, Is not for loue but profit, and their gaine. Record them (sweet Euenus) for they hate, Thy sacred streams: wash not their soyled sin With thy pure liquor: for the Æthiops skin, Will be blacke still: the doome of enuious fate, (Like Mammons heires) sits skouling ore their state: Their Summer-Swallows flourish, they make one, But if thy state he blasted, they are gone. And thou (Blest Hymen) that confirmes the loue, Of Mortall soules, with thy diuinest rites, Knows whom I mean by, for they quench thy lights By their abuse: but there's a power aboue, Will dash their gainefull tradings, and remoue, Their Bartring from the earth, to th' depth of hell, That teach in Marriage how to buy and sell. Yet deere Euenus, I haue more to speake, For I would haue thee carry me commends, To such as be my true approoued friends, (For some I haue will neither bow nor breake) Mid'st my afflictions: but by all meanes seeke To re-infuse life in mee pray the tell When by their house thou goest, that I am well. And if they aske thee how I brook this place Where I'me retired to: say, as louers vse, Pent from their loues, they cannot will, nor chuse, But liue an Hermits life, and in disgrace Of beauty and her name, hath made his face Like times annatomie (poore Sceleton) An obiect fit for Ruth to looke vpon. Tell them the bookes I reade, be such as treate, Of Amadis de Gaul, and Pelmerin, Furious Orlando, and Gerilion, Where I obserue each fashion and each feate, Of amorous humors, which in my conceipt, Seeme to to rare, That they that were so strong, Should be so mad, and I be tame so long, But presently I recollect my sense, And findes a reason: questionles I'me mad But who cares for't, or markes it? if I had Land (like an elder brother) Eminence Of some Court-Comet, would haue presidence, Ouer my braine-pan: and would beg my wit, Though neither he nor I could mannage it. So though I loose my wits I cannot loose My lands, they rest secure; where? can you tell? VVhere? yes, where not? wil't please thee buy, I'le sel: VVhat? wit? I haue none; counsell? neither: house? The arch of Heauen's my couer; pray excuse My Error, I am pore: I'haue naught to sell But teares and those I cannot part with well. But (pray thee) spare thy speech to such as be, And euer were professed foes to loue, And Bayne to marriage, for by them I proue The depth of discontent: they loue not me, Nor doe I care for't: once I hope to see, Enuie without a sting, which still extends Her hatefull power vnto depraued ends. Yet if thou chance to slide by Enuies place, (Which by this true discription thou shalt know) Her structures ruin'd are, and there doth grow, A groue of fatall Elmes, wherein amaze, Or labyrinth is fram'd: heere Enuies race, Had their beginning, For there's yet to see, The very throne where Enuy vs'd to bee. Tell that (proud minion) that ambitious dame, Whose meagre look and broad dishe aueld lock, Whose dangling nose, shap't like an apricock, Makes her desert-lesse proud, that I doe blame Her vniust dealing, though I scorne to name, Th' uniustnesse of it: yet this vowe i'le make, I'le nere trust long-nos'd Female for her sake. Et tu quæ minio nardoque fulges, extendens occulos altiûs prouectos, desiste ceptis.— Nusutam dicam, et sane dicerem, Stiuxta nasum polleat ingenium. Could she (hard hearted she) for priuate gaine, (Such lucring Mammonists the heauens displease,) Sell both the loue and liking of her Niece, And where loue shewd her most, there to restraine, Affection within bounds? sweet streames complaine, To Iuno on't, I know shee'l pitty me And grant my suite—That she may barrain be. VVe haue too manie of that odious brood, VVe neede no more: it is a fruitlesse fruit, That shames the Parents:—Iuno heare my suit, For it will doe both heauen and earth much good, And be a caueat vnto woman-hood; “Rather in Marriage not to deale at all, Then to set Marriage sacred rites at sale. Farewell (Euenus) I haue writ my minde, VVhich I would haue thy streamelings to conuey To Enuies house, by that frequented way, Which as a Port or Hauen is assign'd To euery passenger: Sweet breathing winde Breath on thy sailes, that when thou doest complain, Remembring me, thy teare-swolne eies may raine, And fructefie the earth: That time may showe, This did Euenus for her Poet doe. Certaine Select Epigrams, made good by obseruance, experience, and instance: with an introduction to Time, including sundry conceipted passages, no lesse pleasant then present. It's a mad world my Masters. O Age what art thou made of? sure thou art, Compos'd of other mettall then thou wert, Once was thy glory by thy vertues showen, But now alas thy vertues are vnknowen. For who should show worth but great men? yet each day Shews by experience, None more ill then they, VVhere Honour on a foote-cloth's wont to passe, Like Appians Land Lord on his trapped Asse. 'Lasse I haue seen what I haue grieu'd to see, Honour with vertue nere keepe companie. But if they doe (as some obseruance make) It's not for Conscience, but for fashion sake. O then how vaine is time, to showre down good, On such as are but great, only by blood; Not true demerits which makes me contemne, The idle passions of phantasticke men, VVhich think't sufficient to be great in state, VVithout least vertue fit to imitate: This makes me hence conclude: vice puts on honour: “For vertue, there is none will looke vpon her. I in my time haue seene an vpstart Lord, Raised to sudden honour like a Gourd, Whom in as small time I may chance to see, As Ionah's gourd, so withered he may be, And what's the cause? because its not demerit Or true descent, by which he doth inherit, Such new stolne honors: for then might his name Freely such estimation seeme to claime: But an insinuating humour drawen, “From that same sorce of vice, that lothsome spawne Of all distempered passions, which can be Mark't with no better name then flatterie, And is this way to purchase honour trewly? Can such a man be sayd to merit dewly? VVhen how s'ere we admire him for his seate. “It was not worth, but basenesse made him great. O Time, how strangely art thou varied, From what thou once appear'd; how art thou led By euery fashion-monger that doth stand More on the egge-fying of his band His peak't munchattoes, his Venetian hose.

The Church-Knight. A Church-man was there on a time I reade, Of great estate his father being dead, Which got, his Syrpe-cloth he discarded quite, Resoluing fully now to be a Knight: Vp to the Court he goes with speede he can, Where he encountred a North-britaine man, With whom discoursing in his Euening walke, He spoke of Knights 'mongst other idle talke, How th' title it was worthie, and that he, Could well endure entitled so to be; For I do reade (quoth he) of such as these Within the Ecclesiasticke histories: What fame and honour they obtain'd by warre, Which sir (belieue me made me come thus farre, That I (if meanes or mony could obtaine it) Might in respect to my profession gaine it.

How should we then beleeue them what they say. “Since what they taxe vs in, themselues bewray: Its too too true: so that oft-times the Temple, (Though th' house of God, giues lay-men worst example. Crucem &amp; coniugem vno petimus fato, Hanging and marrying goe by destinie. It is an axiome in Philosophie, “Hanging and marrying goe by destinie; Both reference haue vnto the doome of fate, Both doe our birth and nature calculate: Nor can we say these two be different far, Sith both haue influence from one ominous star, Which bodes our happinesse or our mischance According to the starres predominance; This made Arminus Carthage-Ruler say “That with a wife he could not well away: For being askt why he with others share not, Good fortune in good wiues (quoth he) I dare not, For if I chance to light on one that's wise, “She will be wilfull, selfe-lov'd, or precise, “If wealthy, wanton, vowing to her friend, “I shall be Cocold ere a fortnight end: “If poore then peeuish, of condition shrewde: “If bewtifull she will be monstrous proude; “And if deformed, lothsome is she then, “And th' least of these would kill a thousand men. But now suppose, I could no longer tarrie, But that I might doe either worse or marrie, And that I sought a wife to fit my turne, (For better tis to marrie then to burne) Though many (they may thank their own good carriage) Are all afire the first day of their marriage: Why then as my position was at first. This marriage-day is either best or worst I ere was maister of: for if my wife Be loyall as she ought, then is my life Made double blest in her, where I may say, “Each day lookes cheerefull like a mariage-day, But if selfe-will'd vntamed, head-strong, froward, Immodest indiscreete, peeuish, vntoward: Why then through th' fury of her in-bred malice, In climing to her bed, I clime to th' gallowes. Where euery word that doth proceed from her Strangles me like an Executioner; Her humour is my neck-verse, which to sort I cannot, if I should be hanged for't, Her tongue's my torture, and her frisking taile, Flies vp and downe like to a wind mills saile, Her hands like Fullers wheels, one vp, one downe, Which still lie malling on my costrell crowne: VVhich ere I would endure to take her banging, I would goe round to worke and take a hanging: Since therefore Fate hath doomed this to thee, Hanging or wiuing patient thou must be. An Epigramme called the Cambrian Alchymist. The Planet-stroken Albumazar, Shaues the Muses like a razor; Fayry-like we therefore shun them, Cause there is no haire vpon them, Muses loose their ornament, Cambria has their excrement. Excrement? it's true indeede, Haire growes from th' excesse of seede, Which by instance small doth varie From th' peere-lesse Seminarie; Which to make her worth allow'd, Shrowdes her proiect in a clowde. In a Clowde? its rather showne, like the man that's in the Moone, Where our Iles Ardelio, Descants of Tom Trinkillo; Form'd like one that's all in mist, Like a second Alchymist. Strange the Proiect was I wish Of this Metamorphosis; Nought was (if I vnderstood) Good, but that it was deem'd good By the great: ô worthy feate, To be worthlesse deemed great. Vpon diuine Roscius. Two famous Roscio's chanc't I to espie, Acting a Metamorphosis, while I Sleepe vnder th' couert of a shady wood, VVhere great Archyas for the vmpire stood, VVho did their seuerall actions thus define, “Art-full the one, the other most diuiuine. Vpon Roscius Hackney, in a Dialogue betwixt Expedition, &amp; Endimion. Exped. Why-ho, Endimion; how th' Dormouse sleeps, Awake for shame, open thy wink-a-peeps! Endim. What stur you make, I come with speed I can (and too much speed) for I haue tyr'd my man; Exped. Who, Dulman? Endim. Yes. Exped. I thought the Iade would shame vs, And play vs one horse-tricke for Ignoramus. Vpon Tarbon the Countrey Gentleman. Tarbon they say is mellancholly growne, Because his wife takes phisicke in the towne: VVhy, that's no cause; who would not hazard faire To leaue both land and name vnto his heire? Yea, but he doubts, (so iealous is the man) That th' physicke workes not but Physitian. VVhich if he finde, he sweares he meanes to call. The child not Tarbon but young Vrinall. O monstrous, by this thou'st truly showe, Thy wife a punke, thou needs not call her so: VVhich with thy fowre eyes Talbon if thou finde, Ile neuer trust face, conscience, nor kinde. An Epigram called the Court-Attourney. Who's yon, young Stephano? why sure you iest, You Gallants ride with 4. coach-horse at least; Besides there is euen in his very eye, A kinde of Court-like formall maiestie: Its true; yet it is he: for you must know, Young Stephano is turn'd a Courtier now VVhich makes him complete, and whers'ere he goe, He has his ducke, or its not worth a strawe: But I do doubt, nor be my doubts in vaine, The Courtier must Atturney turne againe. And then he must be stript of euery ragge, And fall againe vnto his buckram-bagge: If this befall, I shall be sorry for't, Sith Iohn astyles gets but small grace at Court. An Epigramme called the Winde-fall. Sir Sensuall (a wanton Priest) there was Who made appointment with a Countrie lasse, That 'gainst the time from market she 'st returne, He would keepe tutch and doe her a good turne. The place where these two louely mates should meet Was a vast forrest vnfrequent'd with feete of any passenger, saue such as were Keepers of th' wood, 'mongst which a Forrester, Vpon occasion chaunc't to come that way, And heard eue-dropper-like what they did say, Their place of meeting, with the maides consent Which he resolv'd as quickly to preuent. And being vnder shade securely sconst, Which place he had elected for the nonst, He staies to see th' returne of this same Lasse, (which as she wish't) did quickly come to passe: For Maids that know not what tis to consent To a lost Maiden-head, nor what is meant by giuing of a greene gowne, sooner will Assent to ill, because they know no ill, Then such as haue of actiue pleasures store, For well were they experienst in't before. Yea such will neuer deale vnlesse they smell, Some hope of gaine, or like the trader well. At last the maide hauing her market made, (Perhaps far sooner then her Parents bade) With clothes tuckt vp returnes with speedy pace, Downe by the Forrest to'th appointed place. Where'th Priest Sir sensuall lay all this while, That he the Maid might of her gem beguile. If you had seene what meeting there was then, Betwixt these two, you would haue vou'd no men Of any ranke or order were so good. As Church-professors vnto woman-hood. So humble was the prelate, as to please. The shamefast maid, he oft fell on his knees. VVhile mumbling pater nosters on her lips, Down fell his breeches from his naked hips. And all this while poore soule she stood stock still, Not thinking (on my conscience) good or ill. At last the iolly Priest (when all was showne, That he could show) wil'd th' maid to lay her down, Vpon a shadie banke, which with all sorts, Of flowres was checkerd fit for Venus sports. She (though she were resolu'd no ill could be By lying downe, yet in her modesty) VVould not vnto his motion so assent, Yet let him blow her downe she was content. The short-breath'd Priest (for he was wondrous fat) And stuff'd withall, makes me no bones of that, But Æolus-like puf's vp his cheeks well growne, And he no sooner blows then she was downe. The Forrester who all this time had stood, Vnder a shadie couert of the wood, Steps in, when'th Priest his shriuing should begin, Saying all wind-falls they are due to him. Manie such Priests auncient records doe show, And present times may show as many now. Another Epigram called, A Cuckold with a witnesse. A vvilie wench there was (as I haue read) VVho vs'd to capricorne her husbands head, VVhich he suspecting, lay in priuate wait, To catch the knaue, and keep his wife more strait. But all in vaine: they day by day did mate it, Yet could his foure eies neuer take them at it. This subtile wench perceiuing how they should At last preuented be, doe all they could: For now Italian-like her husband grew, Horne-mad I wish, and kept her in a Mew. Inuent'd a trick, which to accomplish better, Vnto her friend she closely sent a letter, And thus it was; Friend you shall know by me, My husband keepes me far more narrowlie, Then he was wont, so as to tell you true, You cannot come to me: nor I to you. Yet spite of his eies and as many more, VVele vse those pleasures which we vsd before: Onely be wise, and second what I wish: VVhich to expresse (my friend) know this it is. My husband as he hates the horne to weare, Of all the Badges forth, so feares he'th Beare, More then all other Beasts which doe frequent The heathy Forrests spacious continent. If thou wilt right me then, and pepper him, Couer thy seruant in a false Beares skin. And come to morrow, as thou vs'd before, Tying thy seruant to my chamber dore. After this quaint direction he attirde His man in beare-skin as she had desir'de Entring the chamber he receiued is VVith many a smile, back-fall, and sweetned kisse: For they'r secure, of all that was before, Hauing a Beare that kept the Buffe from dore. The wittall foole no sooner inckling had, Then vp the staiers he ran as he were mad. But seeing none but th' Beare to entertaine him, Of Hornes he neuer after did complaine him. In Romanum Mnestorem. It chanc't two Romane Conuerts on a day, For pater noster at the Cards to play; She mop'd, he pop'd; his popping could not get her, “For she thought popping elsewher had been fitter. Thus he went home no wiser then he came, Sith popping was the Puppies chiefest game. In Poetam Hippodramum. OR Post-riding Poet. It tooke a Poet once I'th head to poast, For what I know not, but I'me sure it cost His purse far more (as I haue heard soms say) Then ere his Muse was able to repay. In Numularium antiphylon. Cash-coind? its true; but he intends to be The stamper of that Coine is due to me. Pray thee (my friend) forbeare to set it on, (My stampe I meane) till I haue throughly done: And I protest to thee, when I haue ended, I'le yeeld to thee, if she say thou canst mend it. In Romanum Sacerdotem. A Romane Priest came to absolue a Virgin by the way, As he in his Procession went: where hee resolu'd to stay A night. For what? not to absolue the tender Virgins sinne, But as a Ghostly Fathers wont, to let more errors in: The doore was shut, the candle out, for I would haue you mark, A carnall Father best absolues a Virgin in the darke: Which absolution so increasd, in zeale and purity, As within sixe and forty weekes it grew a Tympany, A girle forsooth, baptized Ioan, nor is it any shame, For th' wench in time may proue Pope Ioan the second of that name. In Phylætum. Phylætus writing loue-lines on a day, A Ratte came in and stole his lines away. Phyletus slept on still, and minded not While th' hungry Ratte eat vp the lines he wrote; If I were to be Iudge, as much may be, The Rat should be in loue, Phyletus free, That seeing th' saucy Rat to loue enthrall'd, Loue-bayne heereafter might be Rats-baine call'd. An Epigram called the Courtier. Now heauen preserue mine eyesight what is here? A man made vp in Wainscot? now I sweare, I tooke him for some Colosse; sure I erre, This is not he: yes: this's the Courtier, Braue Pun-tevallo, for those armes he beares, (An Asse head rampant) and that chaine he weares, By blest Saint Martin, doe descry it's he, Well, ile obserue his carriage narrowly. VVhat makes him go so stiffe, has he the gout? No, but a fire in's hams that went not out These seuen yeares to my knowledge: then it has Begun (it seems bout time) when th' glasse-work was; Its true, it did so, I haue heard some say, He has a pleasant wit, he has one way A pretty thriuing wit, can make a legge, And harken out what office he may begge. Can looke as big and burly on such men, (Poore Gnats) that come for to petition him, As Giants in a Pagent, can protest, For meere formality, laugh at a iest, (Without conceiuing out) has witte enough, To put good close on, beare his face in's ruffe. Like a braue sprightly Spaniard, will not let, With some new minted oaths to pay his debt, And can dispense with them, nor does he more, In this, then what his Elders did before. VVith truth (in complement) he seldome meetes, For naked truth with Eue lies without sheetes, And he endures not that, nor can incline, To such a motion, but in progresse time. He cannot blush (no more can women now) Till that their pretie painter tell them how. He ha's a kind of vaine in sonnetting, Purchast by brocage or by pilfering, VVith which he wooes his mistresse, he will set, His face to any fashion, and will bett, VVagers on Ladies honours: hauing forgotten VVhat he should speake, hee's fingering his button, Or some such trifling action, till he store himselfe with wit, which he had lost before: Nor did that Morall erre, who wisely would, Compare a Courtiers witte to th' Marigold. It opens with the Sunne, but beeing set The Mari-gold shuts vp, so doth his witte. The Marigold's most cheer'd by mid-day sunne, So's he, whence i'st, he lies in bed till noone. Occasion is his Cupid, lust his lure, Pleasure his Pander, dalliance his whoore, He h'as but one receipt of making loue, And being put out, he cannot speake, nor moue, But like a liue-lesse image, seemes to be, Till by good hap his speech recouered be. He smells of Complement, in presence faire, And vses oft to weare bracelets of haire, Swearing they came from such, but tis not so, For t'was some tyre-woman he tooke them fro. The Ornaments which he admires are these, To faune, to obserue times, to court, to please, To make strange faces, sleeke his prefum'd skin, Starch his Mouchatoes, and forget his sinne. To dance, to dice, to congie, to salute, To stamp, to stalke, to finger well a lute. To tremble at a Cannon when it shootes, To like, dislike, and fill his head with doubts. To be in passion, wind his carelesse armes, To plie his Mistresse with delightfull charmes. To be for all, yet ignorant in all, To be disguisd, and strange fantasticall: Briefly to be, what all his kind haue beene, Seeme what they be not, be what least they seeme. Such is my Puntauallo, and in time No question but hee'l prooue true Pantomime, To imitate all formes, shapes, habits, tyres Suting the Court, and sorting his desires, And then what th' Satyre said, shall well appeare: The Deuill is the perfects Courtier. Hauing my complete Courtier thus defin'd, I haue no more that I can call to minde, “Saue what is common, and is knowne to all, “That Courtiers as the tide doe rise and fall, So I will end with what I haue writ before, “Till the' next tide come, and then I wil write more. Vpon his much honoured friend Master William Ascam, and his selected Temple. Epigram. In Templo, Venerem Spectet Qui amat Venerem. Aske him what Temple most delighteth him, And hee'l replye, that Temple thou art in. Nec Venus est quæ nomen habet veneris, sed Amicæ Casta deæ Arcadiæ, Delia nomen habet. &amp;c. Aske him what Praiers should in that Temple be, And he'le replie, what prayers best liketh thee: Aske him what Temple yeelds him most content, And he'le reply thy Temple, ther's his Saynt. Aske him what Temple's purer then aboue. He'le say thy Temple: there's the Queene of Loue; Then let me aske your iudgement is't not fit, That Temple honour him, that honours it? Posies vpon bracelets. As loue giues life to euery part, So this giues life vnto my hart: This chastly lies, and liues with me, O that I might doe so with thee? Another. [How might I triumph in my blisse] How might I triumph in my blisse; If loue were where my Bracelet is. For then should loue do no such harm To wring my heart, but wreath my arme. An Eglogue betweene Billie and Iockie called the Mushrome. Iockie. Whou Billie whou, what faire has thou bin at? Thouse be so trim, I mickle torken at: For wele I wate, last time I met with thee, Thou hardly had a lapp to swedle thee. Pray thee (good Bille,) tell me swith and soone, Iockie may doe what Billy late has done. Billie. What Iockie (lither lurden) lesse for wea, Thou'st be so tattert, but theres many sea, That ill can wappe it: but be vis'd by mee, And thou or lang sall glish in brauery. Swatt on thy tayle man, heeres a blythy place, And ile ensure thee how I gat this grace.

Mickle may Bille thriue, as hees begun, My lugges are lithing, Bille now iogge on Billy. Then heare me Iocky. Bout mid-belten twas Or Ise bethought awrang, when I mut passe, Ore th' Breamy bourne, and (wele I traw) I had, Smaw gere (at tat tide) but a lether-bagge, A Motley iacket, an a slop of blew, It was my Fadders, I mun tell thee true. A lang youd I, (and langer then thoule say) And wele, I knew not whether, ne what way, Fute-sare I was, for Bille shoon had neane, But an aud pare with him, and they were gane. Nor hose legs (wele I wate) but skoggers aud, That hardly hap't poore Billes legs fractu'd. Hate was my weasia, empty was my maw, And nane I met with, I could ken or knaw, So vncath was the gete (as but for shame) I had com'd backe toth place fra whein I came, For siler had I skant, nor lesse nor mare, Then three Bawbees, Ile tell thee all my stare. But lith me Iocky (after many a mile) At last I hapt to light vpon an Ile, Bu Come and full a gere, and full a store, For Bille neuer met with like before, Sae Greathy was the place where I was driuen That I me sicker thought I was in Heauen. But wele Ise sure they that this Iland kept, Were by our Whilome Fathers Angels clept. And wele they might be so, for wele I wate, They were fine men, and men of mickle state. Had lusty husses (that were tricke and trim,) Cud wele don on their geere, with euery pin. Heere stood I musing lang full heauily, Till Iockie wha dost thinke speard vp to me. Iockie. Wha Bille mot that be? Bille. Ane wha thou kens. Caud ane, we raught on meanely, but now sene, He has the pricke and preze Ile say to thee. Iockie. Was it not Lobbie? Bille. Iocky it was he. But now the mickle Lurden is so great, Theyr blest by God, that may with Lobbie speake. By Gods bread Iockie, he so gaish was, I thought no boot to speake, but let him passe, And had done so, but Lobby was so kinde, To come to me and leaue his men behind. Great chat we had, and many that were nye, Musd he would chat with sike an ene as I. But blith was Lobbie, and so meeke he was, That he vnhorst sate by me on the grasse, Lang did we tauke of this thing and of that, A Iugge, a Peggy, and a nut-brown Kate, A Crowd the Piper, and the Fiddler Twang, And many sike things, as wee layen alang. Ablangst the leaue, this Councell gaue he mee, That made me wele to leue, so may it thee. Billie (quoth Lobby) if thoule prosper heere, Thou mun be bald, and learne to bandon feare, Thou mun not blush, nor colour change for ought, Though th' plea thou hast in hand be nere so nought. Thou mun not take petition (lithen me) Nor entertaine him, till thou take thy fee, And (wele I warne thee) better way thou thriue, If thy hand open be to aw that giue. Get mee some prollers, they are best of all, To make thee weet, when some good office falls, Or a barre-hoisted Lawyer that can see, With his foure eyne where aud concealments be, But of aw things I mun fore-warne thee hence, To haue small dealing with a Conscience. That will vndoe thee (Billy) looke to ane, Poore men haue Conscience, but rich men haue nane. 'Mongst other things listen to what I say, For I in briefe will speake now what I may. In Teucria here (this Citie where there be) Many a man will haue an eye of thee, Gaine me Acquaintance: it's the spring of life, And know thou maist a Tradesman by his Wife. Be sicker on her Billye, she it is Can ope her hushands Casket with a kisse. Diue me into a Mercers Booke, and say, Thoul't pay on sike a time, but doe not pay. Chauke me on Vintners, and for aw thy skore, Let great words pay for aw, still run on more. Be stately Billy (and I doe thee rede) Thou mun now throw away thy countrey weed. For skoggers, hozen of the Naples twine, For thy blew slop, sike a made breeke as mine: For thy aud motley iacket, thou mun weare, A cloath a siluer, sike as I haue heere. Then mun thou looke big (what way ere thou passe) As if that Billy were not th' man he was. Then learne me Billy some aud Pedegree, Noe matter though't belong not vnto thee, And say thy Grand-sire was a Duke at least, And first inuentor of Saint Gallowayes feast. Maintaine me leeing in a Liuery, For that's the first meanes that mun honour thee: Let her be Page-like, at thy elbow still, For when thou canst not doe it, leeing will, Let Suters dance Attendance, lithen me, And quicke dispatch, be it thine enemye. Take fees for expedition, for of aw, Sutes hastly ended wreake our ouerthrow. Get me an Heralt (wele I wat) oth best, That may for Bille find some pretty Crest, A Rat, a Pismire, or a Butterflie, A Cornish Chucke, a Parrat, or a Pie, A nimble Squirrell or a picke-a tree, A Wesell, Vrchin, or a Bumble Bee. Or if of plants, my Bille will haue ane, He may full swithly mange these chuse him ane. The Brier, the haw-thorne: or the Priuet bush, The Osire, Cypresse, or where th' merry Thrash, Sings cut her Fa, la, la, but nane there be, “That like the Mushrome Bille sitteth thee, Her grouth is sudden, Bille so is thine, Then take the Mushrome, its a Crest of mine. Mare need I not say, keepe but wele my reede, And siker Ise, thou cannot chuse but speede. With that he twin'd frame, and left me there, Where I with mickle Carke, and mickle Care, Bustling now vp now downe, at last me yode, To ply my lesson wele I vnderstood, And in a pretty while I learnd to bee, That cunning Clerke that he awarded me. Deftly could I tricke vp me sell, and trim, Me featly fine, in euery legge and limme, Wele cud I marke my name in Marchants books, Fo wele I wate, wha ere he be, that lookes, I'se there in black and white, and wele I may, For he is said to aw that menes to pay. Not a petion would I listen ore, Till Billie had sam chinke in's fist before. Not a rich mickle lossell could there be, That had a plea but had his path by me. And sine I sau as Lobbie teld beliue, That he that had a conscience could not thriue. I draue the Haggard frame, sine whilke time, Iockie thou sees how Billie gins to shine. Iockie, And lang may Billie shine, but sayne to me Fare aw our Coustrils haufe as wele as thee, Billie. Iockie they doe, nor neede thou t'arken out, For we will feede, wha euer famish for't: O its a place so full of louisance, Play but thy round the Ilanders will daunce. Ladies &amp; Lordings, Swainelines with their Swaines, Will trimly trip it ore the leuie plaines. And wele I wat that Iockie ance could play, For I haue heard him,— Iockie. And so Billie may. Billie. Then tune thy chanter vp and gae with me, Come blithly on,— Iockie. Iockie does follow thee. A Panegirick Embleame, Intituled, Saint George for England. The Argument of the Embleame. From whence the English anciently deriued this Saints canonization, his orders, inauguration—of Sigismund, Emperour of Almaine: and his present to Henry the fift. The institution of this order where, the solemnizing where: the seuerall games, exercises, Races, and Martiall trials auspiciously begunne with that Saint.—And the like of Honour and aduauncement. —A comparison had betweene Perseus sonne to Iupiter and Danae; who preserued Andromoda from the sea monster, and Saint George, who slew the Dragon. The discription of Perseus, and of Saint George: concluding with a victorious Pæan to Saint George. The Embleame Haile to thy shrine thou Saint of Albion, Who had thy auncient consecration From thy religious mannagements, as farre Disperst, as Turke or Christian planted are, Thou art the Saint which we in war doe vse, Hoping by thee to be auspicious. Yet void of superstition we impart, Sole laud to him, whose noble Saint thou art. Nor loose we th' name of th' Almaine Sigismund, By whom thy precious Reliques first were found. And heere presented as a royall gift To Englands Mirrour, Henry the fift. Since when thy order is solemnized, At Windsor, where a part of thee is sed To be inter'd: thrice happy monument, To couer part of one so eminent. So Saintly vertuous as no honour can, “Giue thee thy due, as onley due to man. O may thy institution honour'd be, By true deserts, and due solemnity. Nor whom thy order doth inaugurate, May they by vice stand subiect vnto hate. But so euen weighd in all their actions here, “As Georges Knights may after Saints appeare: Which they shall be, by showing feruent zeale Vnto the Church, loue to the common-weale. In all dur games and pastimes seuerall, Euer on George as on our Saint we call: For by that name the auncients vnderstood, Their Fortune could not chuse but to be good, As Turnaments, Iusts, Barriers, and the rest, In which his name was euermore exprest. In Races too these present times affoord Instances store, Saint George he giues the word. So as it was (as common stories tell) To say Saint George, as say God speede you well. In Martiall trials when our armies met, His name would spirit in our men beget, “Heightning their courage, perills passing through. “Standing desolu'd before a Cannons mouth. “Out-bearing danger, and with violent breath “Stand at defiance gainst the threats of death. Marching through horrour they would boldly passe, (As for pale feare, they knew not what it was) Which may be instanc'd in that holy war, Where those that lost their liues canoniz'd are In leaues of perpetuity: I meane, In the regayning of Ierusalem, Where those renouned Champions enterprist, For the due honour of their Sauiour Christ. Either to win that Cittie (maugre th' vaunts Of all those hellish god lesse miscreants,) Or if they could not th' Cittie so surprize, Resolv'd they were their liues to sacrifice; Euen then I say when those that Marshall'd them, Could not with-hold from flight their recreant men; “Saint George appear'd in a submissiue show, “Wishing them not to wrong their Countrie so: And though a ghost (and therefore lesse belieu'd; Yet was his mouing presence so receiv'd As none to fight it out resolued more, Then such as readiest were to flie before. Vp went their scaling-ladders to displant Th' abhorred of-spring of the miscreant, And euer as some danger they espide, God and S? George for England still they cride. And how successiue that renowned warre Was to those Christians, which enrolled are In an eternall register, may well appeare “By Godfrey Bulloyne who was stiled there “King of Ierusalem, yet as its showne, “By auntient stories, would receiue no crowne, “Thinking 't vnfit that it should be rehearst, “Thar where his masters head with thornes was pierst, He that his seruant was should be so bold, As haue his head girt with a crowne of gold. What fame in forraine coasts this Hero got, The lake Sylene the pond or lake where the Dragon was. Silene shewes, if we should not; Where in the reskew of a louely Mayde, A fearefull Dragon he discomfited, So as we haue portraide to euery viewe, On signes of Innes-how George the Dragon slew; Which story to expresse were too too long, Being a subiect for each fidlers song: “Yet cause there is (I cannot will nor chuse) Comparison 'twixt him and Perseus, VVho sonne to Ioue and showre stain'd Danae, In reskew of the faire Andromade, Encountred that sea-monster; Ile explane Each attribute of their peculiar fame: “And then conferring them one with the other, “Collect whose best their actions laide together. And first for Perseus; great I must confesse, He was in name, his birth inferres no lesse Being Ioues sonne, yet can he no way shun The name of Bastard, though he were his sonne: Deflowr'd his mother was—and in a showre Of gold, to shew how gold has soueraigne power, T'vnlocke the fort of fancy, and how soone “Women are wonne, when golden bayts are showne. Long Ioue had woo'd and yet he could not win What he desir'd, till gold receiv'd him in, Which seemes by easie consequence to proue, “Gifts be the giues that bindes the hands of loue. Thus sprung the noble Perseus, who in time “To propagate the honour of that line From whence he came, and that it might be sed, That he from Ioue was rightly fathered Tooke on him strange aduentures; as to right “Iniur'd Ladies by a single fight, “Encounter Giants, rescew men distrest, In each where of his glory was exprest: “For valiant &amp; more worthy they doe shew them, “That wrongs redresse, then such as vse to doe them, But th' first and best attempt he did on Earth, “Was, to wipe off th' blemish of his birth, And th' staine of his corrupted mothers honour, Which blushes blaz'd who euer look't vpon her. “On then along imagin'd it may be VVent he to th' reskew of Andromade; Who now was markt for death, and brought to th' shore Where many maids had bin deuour'd before, By a sea-monster: here the Virgin stood, To free her Countrey with her guiltlesse blood, Whom Perseus (as he coasted by that way) No sooner vew'd then he began to say. Faire Virgin (then he wept) impart to vs What rude vnhallowed hand hath vs'd thee thus And by the honour of my heauenly Sire What ere he be he shall receiue his hire, Giant or Monster in the earth or Sea, Reueng'd he shall-sweete Virgin tell it me. Kind Sir (quoth she) and then she staide her breath As one addrest to meditate of death, Treate not with me of life, nor aske who 'tis Giant or Monster that's the cause of this, Onely know this (thou gentle Knight) that I “Am doom'd to death, and I'me resolu'd to die. To die (faire Maide quoth he)? if't be thy fate, Ile sympathize with thee in equall state And die with thee: onely giue griefe a tongue, To tell me who's the Author of thy wrong: Know then (sayd he) I am that haplesse she, The wretched, pittied poore Andromade, Who here am left of friends, bereft of all To be a prey vnto a rauenous whale: Many haue suffered ere it came to me, Now is my lot and welcome it shall be, To expiate with my vnstained blood The Monsters wrath and doe my countrey good; As she spake this vp from the Ocean Came that deuouring vaste Leuiathan, Sweeping along the shore, which being spide; Good sir retire the noble Damsell cride, Yonder he comes for loue of honour flie, It's I am doom'd, then let me onely die. But Perseus (one better tempered, Then to behold a Virgine slaughtered, Without assayd reuenge) did streight begin With man-like valour to encounter him, Doubtfull the skirmish was on either side, (While th' Maide a sad spectator did abide) Wooing with teares which from her cheeks did flow That Ioue would giue this Monster th' ouerthrow: At last her prayers and teares preuail'd so well, As vnder Perseus feete the Monster fell; Whence came it (as the story doth proceede) The Uirgin and her Countrey both were freede: VVhich to requite (in guerdon of her life) She gaue her selfe to Perseus as wife, “Whom he receiu'd—ô he did ill in this, “Sith by the Auncient it recorded is, Before that Perseus to her reskew came, She was espoused to another man “By name Vaxedor, (ô it was a sinne To marrie her that was not dew to him:) And better had 't been to sustaine her fate, “Then by such breach of faith to violate Her former Spousals—which vniust offence “Gods may winke at but neuer will dispence: Yea to a barraine Rocke though she were tyde, Yet better 'twas then to be made a Bride “To an vsurped Bed, for that did laie, “That staine on her, time cannot wipe away. Thus haue you heard what noble Perseus was VVith greatest dangers that his worth did passe, The imminence whereof merits due praise, “And such a Poet as deserues the Baies: Laurell and Myrtle—though his Nuptiall knot “Lost him more fame then ere his valour got: “For so deprau'd's the Nature of our will, “What's good we laine, what's ill we harpe on still. Now to thy English Saint, my Muse repaire, And lim him so, that when thou shalt compare These two: He Perseus may out-strip as farre, As sunne the Moone, or th' Moone a twinkling star. George now enstil'd the Saint of Albion, By linage was a Capadocian; Whose The Etimologie of George from Gera and Gion, War-like, or valiant. valour was exprest in all his time, That vertue might in euery action shine, VVhich to induce beliefe by mouing sence, I will produce his best description thence, Both for th' resemblance which hath euer bin, Twixt the renowned Perseus and him: As also to make good, that not one staine “Eclipst that glory which his acts did gaine All which by instance seconded shall be “Perseus was great yet George more great then he. Tutching that Dragon on Sylenes shore, I haue in part related it before: Yet but as shadowes doe resemblance make, Vnto the substance and materiall shape, Digressiuely I onely seem'd to glance, At th' act it selfe, not at the circumstance: Know then this noble Champion hearing one, Along his trauaile making piteous mone, In meere remorce drew neerer to the noice, “Till he perceiu'd it was a Ladies voice, VVho in a Virgin-milky white araide. Show'd by her habit that she was a Maide; Carelesse her haire hung dowre, and in her looke, Her woes were writ as in a Table booke: Warm-trickling teres came streaming from her eies Sighs from her heart, and from her accent cries. Tyed was she fast vnto a pitched stake, Bounding on Sylen's Dragon-haunted lake, All which exprest without a Character The wofull state which did enuiron her: Saint George observ'd her teares, and from his eyes Her teares by his finde their renew'd supplies, Both vie as for a wager, which to winne, “The more she wept, the more she forced him: At last with modest hauiour in reliefe, Of her distresse, he thus allaide her griefe. “Sorrowfull Lady if griefes lesned are, VVhen those that pittie griefes receiue their share, Impart your sorrowes to me, and in lew, “If right I cannot, I will pittie you. Alasse (sweet youth quoth she) pittie's too late, VVhen my disease is growen so desperate, Yet doe I thanke thee for thy loue to me, That neuer yet deseru'd so much of thee: “Pray thee begone, such friendship Ile not trie, To see thy death one is enowe to die, And I am shee,—crosse not the will of Fate, “Better's to loose one then a double state: Be gone I say do not the time fore-slowe, “Perish I must of force, so needs not thou. Imminent horror would admit no more; For now the Dragon from Sylenes shore Came spitting lothsome venome all about, VVhich blasted trees and dried vp their roote. S? George the Dragon had no sooner vew'd, Then fresh supplies of spirit was renew'd In his vnmatched brest: him he assailes, And though ore-matcht his spirit neuer failes Till he subdew'd him: and as some auerre, He tyed him fast and made him follow her Vnto her fathers pallace, where we reade In publike triumph he cut off his head. Here may we see that act of Perseus Equall'd by George and made more glorious In that he aym'd no further nor was se'd “To put his feete into anothers bed, “His conquest it was temporate and iust, Not stayn'd with blemish of defaming lust For no attempt vs'd he to vndertake, But for true honour and for Uertues sake. A Victorious Pæan to our Albions S?, alluding to all noble spirits, natiue assumers of his Honor &amp; Order. Iö Pean then must wee Giue S?

Now in the name of fate what Saint is she, That keepes a shop of publicke Brothelrie? Harbours the sharking Lawyer for his pence, And Martir-like consumes his euidence? Nusles my damned Atheist, makes him curse Nature and fortune, that his thin-lin'd purse Should be depriv'd of crowns: do you ask what S?? This Saint was sent from th' fiery Regiment. A Sodome-apple, a lasciuious staine To vertues habite, or a whore in graine, A sucke-blood, Hyene, feigning Crocodile VVorse then the monster bred on th' banks of Nyle, A purple Strumpet, Gangrene to the stare, Earths-curse, hels-blisse, soules-soile, &amp; Angels hate. Smoothed Damnation, smothered infamie, Horror to Age, and youths calamity, Pritty-fac'd diuell of a ginger pace, Grace-lesse in all saue that her name is Grace, Soules-running vlcer that infects the heart, VVith painting, purfling and a face of Art. Star blasting honour, vertues foe, exprest By hating where she seemes to fancy best. Vow-breaking periure, that her selfe adornes, VVith thousand fashions, and as many formes. Creature of her owne making, hollow trunke, A Christian Paganis'd with name of Punke. A Cell, a hell, where she'le no others haue, The common Palliard-Pandor, Baud, or slaue, A cage of vncleane birds, which is possest, Of none saue such as will defile their nest. VVhere fries of Hell hounds neuer come abroade, But in that earthly Tophet make aboade. VVhere bankrupt Factors to maintaine a state, Forlorne (heauen knows) and wholy desperate, Turne valiant Boults, Pimps, Haxtars, roaring boyes, Till flesht in bloud, counting but murders toyes, Are forc't in th' end a dolefull Psalme to sing, Going to Heauen by Derick in a string. It's you damn'd prostitutes that soyle this land, VVith all pollutions, haling downe the hand Of vengeance and subuersion on the State, Making her flowrie borders desolate. It's you that ruine ancient families, Occasion bloodshed, pillage, periuries. Its you that make the wicked prodigall, Strips him of fortune, heritance, and all, Its you that makes new Troy with factions bleede, As much or more then euer old Troy did. Its you (sin-branded wantons) brings decay, To publique states. Its you that hate the day, But honour night: where euery female sinner Resembles th' Moone, that has a man within her. Lasciuious Burrowes, where there nothing are, But toused, sullied, and ore iaded ware. No musick but despaire, no other note, Saue some French-language from a prophane throat: Noe other Accent then the voyce of hell, Where Stygian Circe mumbles ore her spell Shakes her pox-eaten ioynts, and sends for spies, To gaine her traders two sin tempting eies. Where she in praise and honour of her trade Saies, that the Stewes were in th' beginning made, For the aduancement of a publick good, And well it may, if rightly vnderstood: For if in pleasures there such bitters be, As still repentance lackies vanitie? If lust that's cal'd by th' sensuall Epicure, The best of mouing pleasures, and the lure, That for the instance makes our organs rise, Thinking that plase we'r in is Paradice. If she (I say) bring forth no fruit at all, Saue news from'th Spittle, or the Hospitall. Drie rewmes, cararchs, diseases of despaire, Puritane-sniueling, falling of the haire. Akes in the ioynts, and ring-worme in the face, Cramps in the nerues, fire in the priuy place. Racking the sinews, burning of the gall, Searing the vaines, and bowels most of all: Drying the head, which natur's wont to feede, Sucking the blood, whence all distempers breede. If best of pleasures haue no other end, Mong'st earths delights, th? haue we cause t'extend, Our pure affections to an higher ayme, Then to corrupt the honour of our name. For present appetite: I thanke thee whoor, Thou hast instructed me to haue a power Ouer my sence by reason rectified, And hast well neere my senses mortefied: I know thy habit (and I once haue sworne, But now recant it) that no earthy forme Was of like composition, but conceiuing, That th' period of thy pleasure was in hauing, And that thy lust was but desire of gaine, I curb'd my selfe that I should be so vaine. To spend my state, my stock, my name, my nature, On such a brittle fickle, faithlesse creature. Fond was my iudgement when my reason straid, To soile the honourd title of a maide, With brothell greeting, or a painted trunke, A rotten Tombe, a Basiliske, a Punke. For tell me whore? what bewty's in thee showne, Or mouing part that thou canst say's thine owne? The blush that's on thy cheeke I know is made By'th Painters hand, and not by nature laid: And that same rosie-red, and lillie white, Which seemes t'include a volume of delight. Is no more thine, then as it may be said; Faire is the waineskote when it's varnished. Yea I haue heard some of thy consorts say, Thy night-face is not that thou wearst by day. But of a different forme, which vnderstood, Rightly implies too faces in one hood. Now my (prodigious faery) that canst take, Vpon occasion a contrary shape. Thou that canst varie habits and delight, To weare by day what thou putst of at night. Thou that with tempting motiues of despaire, Braiding the net-like tresses of thy haire, Smoothing thy brazed front, oyling thy skin, Taking a truce with Satan, and with sinne. How canst thou thinke that I will loose the light, Of my deare soule, to please mine appetite? How canst thou thinke that for a moments sweete, Wherein the height of pleasures, sorrows meete. I will engage that essence of delight For time eternall, measure infinite? How canst thou thinke I am so void of sense, Or blinde, as not to know thy impudence? True, I was blind, when thy sin-Syren voice, Made me despise my selfe, and make a choice Of soules seducing Error: I was blinde, When I did hope contented ioyes to finde In so profane a couer: Blinde was I, When I expected ought but vanitie. In such an odious harbour: blinde I was To looke for vertue in so vile a case. But now the glorious essence of my soule Tels me, For all thy vertue thou art foule. Spotted with Ermins, and that vanitie, Of which thar't proud, is like a leprosie. VVich runnes to euery vaine, whose very breath, Poisons the tutcher with infectious death. For whats complexion if I should speake true, (That which thou wears I meane) but what the Iew Of lothsome compositions's vsd to make, As th' fat of Serpents, and the slough of snakes, VVith cursed spittle or fleagme commixed is, And canst thou thinke this face deserues a kisse? No, odious Lecher that beslubbered face, That entertaines no signe nor slampe of grace, That sin-reflecting eye, whose piercings are, VVounds to the soule, and to the mind a care, That artificiall blush, that painted cheeke, VVhich neuer seekes, what woman-hood shold seek, That whorish looke drain'd from a wanton mind, Shall make me hate, where I was once inclin'd, Shall make me hate? O that I did not hate, Before this time: but sorrow's nere too late, If feruent, and may I excluded be, If my resolues proceed not inwardly. Farewell, but well I doubt thou canst not fare, So long as thou dost lodge in this dispaire: Preuent me then the cause, and thou shalt see, The effect thereof will soone preuented be: Till then adew: for till that time I sweare it, Thy Connie-burrow is not for my Ferret. Vpon a Poets Palfrey, lying in Lauander, for the discharge of his Prouender. An Epigram. If I had liu'd but in King Richards dayes, Who in his heat of passion, midst the force Of his Assailants troubled many waies Crying A horse, a Kingdome for a horse. O then my horse which now at Liuery stayes, “Had beene set free, where now hee's forc't to stand “And like to fall into the Ostlers hand. If I had liu'd in Agamemnons time, Who was the leader of the Mirmidons, Mounting aloft as wantons in their prime, Of frolike youth, planting the Græcians In their due order, then this horse of mine, “Had not bin thus confin'd, for there he might, “Haue showne himselfe, and done his master right. If I had liu'd when Pallas horse was made, Aptly contriu'd for th' ruine of poore Troye O then there had beene doings for my Iade, For he had beene sole author of annoy, Vnto the Troians: well as I haue said, “He might be Pallas horse in legge and limme, “Being so neere proportion'd vnto him. If I had liu'd in Pasiphaes raigne, That lusty Lasse, in pleasure euer full, And perfect dalliance: O I blest had beene, “She sure would loue a horse, that lou'd a Bull, And better might it with her honour seeme. “A Bul's too fierce, a horse more modest aye, “Th' one routs and rores, the others answer's ney. If I had liu'd in Alexanders age, Crowning my youth 'mongst his triumphant heires, O then that prince, who in his heat of rage, Bad th' Macedons get stallions for their Mares, More liuely and more likely would not gage, “His loue for nought, to such as mongst the rest, “Would bring a Stallion that could doe with best. If I had liu'd amongst th' Amazonites, Those Warlike champions, monuments of Fame, Trophies of Honour friends to choice delights, Who much desired to propagate, their name, “And therefore wisht that they so many nights. “Might haue free vse with men, in due remorce, “For want of men would take them to my horse. If I had liu'd in Phaeton his daies, When with vngiddy course he rul'd the Sun, O then my Palfrey had beene of great prise, For hee's not head-strong, nor would haue out-run, His fellow-Horses, but with gentler pace, As soft and easie as the nimble wind. He would with hakney pace lagg'd on behind. If I had liu'd when th' warre of Agincourt, Burnish't with shields as bright as Diamond, To which our noblest Heroes made resort, O then my Stallion would haue kept his ground, And beene at razing of the stateliest fort, In all that Prouince: and though small he may, Yet am I sure he would not runne away. If I had liu'd but in Don Quixotes time, His Rozinant had beene of little worth, For mine was bred within a coulder clime, And can endure the motion of the earth, With greater patience: nor will he repine At any prouender, so mild is he, How many men want his humility? If I had liu'd when that proud fayry Queene, Boasted to run with swift wingd Zephirus, Tripping so nimbly ore the leuie greene, Of Oetas flourie forrest, where each bush, Taxt her presumption: then my Horse had beene, A Horse of price, O then he had beene tride, And to no manger in subiection tide. If I had liu'd when Fame-spred Tamberlaine Displaid his purple signalls in the East, Hallow ye pamphred Iades, had beene in vaine, For mine's not pamphred, nor was ere at feast, But once, which once's nere like to be againe, How methinks would hee haue scour'd the wheeles, Hauing braue Tamberlaine whipping at's heeles. If I had liu'd but in our Banks his time, I doe not doubt, so wittie is my Iade, So full of Imitation, but in fine, He would haue prou'd a mirrour in his trade, And told Duke Humphreis Knights the houre to dine Yea by a secret instinct would bad power, To know an honest woman from a whoore. Well theres no remedy, since I am poore, And cannot feede my horse as I desire, I must be forc't to set a Bill oth dore, And with my Bill pay for my horses hire, VVhich once discharg'd, Ile neuer run o'th skore; But for my Bill, (inuention play thy part,) And for my horse-sake, tell men what thou art. Heere stands a beast that eats and ha's no teeth, Wiske out and winches, and yet has no tayle, Looks like Deaths-head, and yet he is not death, Neighs like an Asse, and crawleth like a snayle, All bones aboue, no belly vnderneath, “Legg'd like a Cammell, with a Sea-horse foote, “So bigg's his head he cannot be got out. Now generous spirits that inhabit heere, And loue to see the wonders of this Isle, Compar'd with other nations, draw but neere And you shall see what was exprest ere-while, Your pay's but pence, and that's not halfe so deere, “If you remember, as was that same toy, “Of Banks his horse, or Fenners Englands ioy. What would you see, that may not heere be seene, A Monster? VVhy, its heere: or would you see, That which has erst beene showne to other men, “A horses tayle stand where his head should be. Lasse you must know I am for none of them, That loue such nouelties: my two yeeres sayle, Has brought a winching thing that has no tayle. Obserue the wonder, it's not obuious, Nor each day common: see now while its heere, For its a monster so prodigious, That if I can, Ile hau't some other where, And show my trauell to the generous. “For know my monster doth this stable hate, “Hauing a head so great, a roome so straite. Why crowd ye here no faster? 'lasse I see, Because I cannot garnish out my post VVith faire inscriptions grauen curiouslie. “Like to your Mountebanke or English Foist. The trifling vulgar will not come to me. Nor visit my strange oue beast: let them passe. My Monster's not set vp for euery Asse. It' for these braue renowned Caualieres, “That craue to see, and talke of what they see; Nay talke of more then either eies or eares VVere witnesse of. These welcome are to me, And to my Monster, for to them't appeares, “And to no others, that they might beget, “More gaine by th' sight, then ere I gain'd by it. VVhat none? no Mandeuill? is London growne To surfet of new accideats? why hoe,— Saint Bartlemews, where all the Pagents showne, And all those acts from Adam vnto Noe Vs'd to be represent? canst send me none, Of any sort? or thou'ld not any spare, But keepe them for the Pagents of thy Faire. How many vsd to swarme from Booth to booth. “Like to Sclauoniaus, when with famine pinde, Going like Heards, as other cattell doth, Itching for news, yet neuer more inclinde To heare the worst: where now is all that froth, Of crab-fac't Raskals? O I know their straine, “The Faire being done, they sleepe till faire againe. If mother Red-cap, chance to haue an Oxe Rosted all whole, O how you'le flye to it, Like Widgeons, or like wild geese in full flocks, That for his pennie each may haue his bitte: Or if that limping Pedant at the stocks, Set out a Pageant, whoo'l not thither runne, As twere to whip the cat at Abington. Ill-nurtur'd Bowbies, know what I haue heere Is such a Monster, as to know what tis, Would breed amazement in the strangest eare, But vulgar eyes are ayming still amisse, To whom whats onely rare, is onely deere. For you my wonder sleepes, nor shall't awake, Till riper wits come for my monsters sake. Farewell vnciuill Stinkards, skum oth City, The Suburbs pandors, boults to garden Alleys, May you through grates sing out your doleful ditty, For now my Dragon Monster spits his malice, That as you pitty none, so none may pitty, Your forlorne state: O may't be as I pray, So saddest night may cloud your cleerest day. And for the Ostler, since I reape no gaine, Out of my Monster, take him for thy paine. Yet for remembrance write vpon this shelfe, Here stood a Horse that eat away himselfe. Hymens Satyre. Don Bassiano married now oflate: Has got his witlesse pate a faire estate, Ist possible, Fortune should be so blind, As of a world of men not one to find, Worthy her training in her thriuing school But an admired Wittall or a Foole?

VVhence we obserue (experience teacheth it) The younger brother hath the elder wit, Yea by example instanc'd euery where, The Cockney-Cittie's rich, the Suburbs bare, O then I see the Goulden age begins, When fooles are mates for wisest Citizens. A Marriage song called by the Author In and Out: and now dedicated to the lately conuerted honest-man, W. G. and his long loue-crossed Eliza. The Marriage song, called In and Out. Hah, haue I catcht you prethee sweet-hart show, If so thou canst, who is in Turne-ball now? Dost smile my pretious one? nay I must know, There is no remedy, then tell me how; What my ingenuous cheat, lost laugh to see, All former rarres turne to an harmony, So generally applauded? trew thou may, The Night is past, and now appeares the day, Full of true Iouisance; long was thy suit, Ere twas effected, being in and out, Vowing and breaking, making many an oath, Which now I hope's confirmed by you both. O how I clip thee for it? since thy name, Is there renued, which first defam'd the same, For (heare me Bride-groom) thou by this shalt saue Thy selfe a Title: I will raze out knaue, Dishonest louer: vow infringing swaine, And say thou ceast to loue, that thou againe. Might loue more feruent, being taught to wooe, And wooing doe what Silke-wormes vse to doe; VVho doe surcesse from labour now and then, That after rest the better they might spin. Spin then (my pretty Cobweb) let me see, How well thy Bride likes thy actiuitie. That when she sees thy cunning, she may say; “VVhy now I'me pleas'd for all my long delay; “Play that stroake still, theres none that here can let thee, “For non there is can better please thy Bettie. “O there (my deere) I hope thou'le nere giue ore, “VVhy might not this been done as well before? “Nay faint not man, was Bettie so soone won, “That her short pleasure should be so soone done. “Nay then come vp, are marriage ioyes so short, “That Maydenheads are lost with such small sport? “This if she say (as this she well may say) Like a good Gamster hold her still out play. First night at least wise, and it will be hard, But she will loue the better afterward. VVhence is the Prouerb (as it hath been said) Maydens loue them that haue their maydenhead: Come then my lad of mettall make resort, Vnto the throne of loue thy Betties fort. There plant thy Cannon siedge her round about. Be sure (my Boy) she cannot long hold out. Erect thy standerd, let her tender brest, Be thy pauillion: where thou takes thy rest. Let her sweet-rosie Breth such ioyes bestow, That in that vale of Paradise below, Thou may collect thy ioyes to be farre more, Then any mortall euer had before. Yet heare me friend, if thou secure wilt be, Obserue these rules which I prescribe to thee. Be not horne iealous, it will make thee madde, VVomen will haue it if it may be had. Nor can a iealous eye preuent their sport, For if they lou't farre will they venter for't. Suppose her straying beauty should be led, To the embraces of anothers bedde, VVilt thou Acteon-like thy houre-glasse spend, In moning that thou neuer canst amend? No, my kind friend, if thoul't be rul'd by me, I'de haue thee winke at that which thou dost see, shading thy wiues defects with patient mind, Seeing, yet seeming to the world blind. For tell me friend, what harme is there in it? If then being cloyd, another haue a bitte? VVhich thou may spare, and she as freely giue, Beleeue me friend, thou hast no cause to greeue. For though another in thy saddle ride, VVhen he is gone, there's place for thee beside, Which thou may vse at pleasure, and it'h end, Reserue a pretty morsell for thy friend. Let not thy reason then be counter-bufft, Nor thinke thy pillow with horne-shauings stuft, If't be thy destiny to be a monster, Thou must be one, if not, how ere men conster. Thou may remaine secure, exempt from shame, Though megre Enuie aggrauate the same. For this has been my firme position still, The husbands hornes be in the womans will. Upon the Marriage. This Marriage went the nearest way about. Playing now vp, now downe, now in, now out, But being done I wish loue may begin, Now to be neuer out, but euer in. An Epigramme, Like to like.

The brittle Ashe and shade-obscuring Yewe, The aged Oke claspt with the Missletoe, Hawthornes grow, one a row, And their sweetest smels bestow. Royall Palme, Laurell wreath, With young Osiers vnderneath, Loue-resembling Box tree there, Flowrishing through all the yeere. Seyons young, tender plants, Where the quire of woodbirds chants. Flora now takes her throne and for she knowes, Of Standish care, she decks his aged browes: With crowne of renowne, Monument in time to come. That what he hath done of late, After times may imitate, So when al our Groues grow greene, Albion may a Forrest seeme, Where if she the Forrest were, Standish would be Forrester. Then should no gorse grounds furrie whin, or Brire, Depriue the painefull plough man of his hire. Euery field, then should yield, Great reliefe to share &amp; shield. To the Plow share for his paine, To the shield for discipline, Sith the first he sows and reapes, And the last defends and keepes. Standish giues, to both a part, To the Gauntlet, and the Cart. Trees (Standish saies) in summer vpward growe, In winter downe-ward to the roote belowe: This I know not, but I know That with him it is not so. For in winter of his time, Now when sap gins to decline, Store of science blossome out From the top vnto the root: Root of age, toppe of youth. Winter bearing, summers growth. To the truely worthy, the Alderman of Kendall and his brethren. Sir in regard of due respect to you, (If I could write ought that might yeeld a due, To th' Corporation of which I may call, (And dewly to) your selfe the principall: I should desire, if power were to desire, To take an Eagles wing and soare farre higher. Then hitherto my weake Muse could attaine, But 'lasse I see my labour is in vaine; For th' more I labour to expresse your worth, The lesse I able am to set it forth: Yet let not my endeuours so be taken, As if with power my will had me forsaken; For know (though my ability be poore) My good-will vie's with any Emperour. Yea I must write and though I cannot speake, What I desire yet I will euer seeke, T'expresse that loue which hath been borne by me, (And shall be still) to your Society. Then cause I know your place and haue an ayme, To shewe your merits in a shadow'd name: I must be bold (affection makes me bold, To tell you of some errors vncontrol'd, VVhich to your best discretion Ile referre, Hauing full power to punish such as erre. First therefore I intend to speake of is; Because, through it, there's many do amisse, Is Idlenesse, which I haue partly knowne, To be a vice inherent to your towne: Where errant pedlers, mercinarie slaues, Tinkers, and Tookers and such idle knaues Are too too conuersant: let your commaund Suppresse this sinne and refuse of the land, They much disparage both your towne and you: Send them to th' whipping-stocke, for that's their dew. You know the Lord (whose will should be obeid) Hath in his sacred word expresly sayd, That those which wil not labour they should sterue, (For rightly so their merits do deserue. Yea if we should in morall stories see, What punishments inflicted vse to be On such as could not giue accompt what they Did make profession of from day to day; Yea such as could not (vpon their demaund Expresse how they did liue vpon their hand; I make no question (but by Pagans care,) You that both Magistrates and Christians are, VVould see your Towne (by th' punishments exprest) By selfe-same censures to be soone redrest. And this same error do I not espie, Onely in them, but in the younger frie, VVho in their youth do lauish out their time. Without correction or due discipline: Respectlesse of themselues (as't may be sayd) They seeme forgetfull wherto they were made: O looke to this let them not run at large, For ouer these you haue a speciall charge; And if they fail beleeu't from me it's true, Their blood will be requir'd of some of you. We reade in Rome how they did still retaine, Some exercise that they their youth might traine, In warlike discipline or liberall arts, Or education in some forraine parts; So as in time as after it was showne, These actions gain'd their Citty great renowne. But whence can I imagine that this sin, Wherein too many haue been nusled in, Had her originall but from that staine Of reputation, and the worlds baine, (Which I in briefe am forced to expresse,) To wit, that swinish vse of drunkennesse? A vice in great request (for all receiue it) And being once train'd in't there's few can leaue it; How happie should I in my wishes be, If I this vice out of request could see, VVithin that natiue place where I was borne, It lies in you, deere Townes-men to reforme, VVhich to performe, if that I might presume, Or so much vnder fauour to assume. As to expresse what my obseruance taught me, Or bring to you what my experience brought me. I would make bold some outward grounds to lay, Which might in some sort lye an open way, For rectifying such abuse as grow, By this foule vice, and I will tell you how. There is no meane that sooner moues to good, If that the same be rightly vnderstood, Then is example, for it's that doth moue, Such firme impression as we onely loue, What greater wittes approue, and what they say, Stands for an axiome mongst the younger aye, Which by the Prouerbe euery man discernes, Since as the old Cocke crowes, the young Cock learns; So weake is youth, as there is nought in them, Which they deriue not from the Eldermen, Quickly peruerted (so depraud's our will) If they see ought in the Elder sort that's ill, And hardly (when they'r customed in sinne,) Can they be wain'd from that they'r nusled in, But if they once perceiue the Elder sort, Hates vice in youth, and will reprooue her for't If they see Vertue honourd by the Graue And reuerend Magistrate, care they will haue, To rectifie their errors, and reduce, Their streying courses to a ciuill vse. If this by due obseruance doe appeare, Methinks you that are Elders, you should feare, To act ought ill, lest your example should, Approue in others, what should be contrould. And ill may th' Father chastise in his sonne, That vice, which he himselfe is guilty on. Your patternes are most obuious to the eye, Of each vnseason'd youngling passeth by, VVhich if he see defectiue but in part He presently applies it to his heart: For Education which we may auerre With that diuinely-learn'd Philosopher To be a second Nature) now and then Doth alter quite the qualities of men, And make them so transform'd from what they were, (As if there did some other men appeare: Yea so far from their Nature they're estraung'd, As if they had been in the cradle chang'd: And of this second nature I am sure, Example is the onely gouernour. Which Plutarch termes th' Idea of our life, Tymon an emelation or a strife We haue to imitate, that what we see, May in our selues as well accomplisht bee. O then you Presidents (whose yeeres do giue To most of you a faire prerogatiue) Reforme your selues (if you see ought) and then You better may reform't in other men. As you are first by order and by time, So first inioine your selues a Discipline; VVhich being observ'd by you and dewly kept, You may wake such as haue securely slept In their excesse of vanities: 'mongst which Let me (with all respect to you) beseech That you would seek exactly to redresse, (That brutish vice of beastly drunkennesse. And first to propagate a publique good, Banish't I pray you from your brother-hood, For diuerse haue obserued it and will; (For man obserues not good so oft as ill. What's done by th' Elders of a Corporation, Giues vnto other men a toleration: If any such there be (as well may be) For that vice raignes in each Society: First caution them, bid them for shame refraine To lay on Grauity so fowle a staine; Tell them much happens twixt the cup and lip, And those same teres of their good fellowship, If they in time reforme not what's amisse, Shall drowne their reeling soules in hels abisse: Where they may yaule and yarme til that they burst, Before they get one drop to quench their thirst, Since th' punishment shall be proportion'd there, To that delight which we do liue in here. O then, for Gods loue, bid them now prepare, To be more strict then hitherto they were, Or bid them haue recourse vnto their glasse, And there surueigh how swiftly time doth passe, How many aged Emblemes time doth showe, In those same wrinkles of their furrow'd browe; How many motiues of declining age, What arguments of a short pilgrimage, How many messengers of instant death, As dropsie, gout, and shortnes of the breath, Catarrs descending howerly from the head, Distaste of meates, wherein they surfeted: And thousand such proceeding from ill diet, Nights-sitting vp, rere bankets, mid-dayes ryet, But if these doting Gray-beards I haue nam'd, VVill not by your intreaties be reclaim'd, Then I would wish (because these vices lurke) That you would fall another way to worke, And by dew castigation force them take Another course for youths example sake: For those that will not now, at last repent After some twice or thrice admonishment, Deserue a punishment, nay which is worse, The Churches Anathema or that curse, Which shall lie heauy on them in that day, When what they owe they must be forc't to pay: But some of you such Reuerend-men appeare, As you deserue that title which you beare, Townes Guardians, protectors of our peace, And sole renewers of our hopes encrease, So discreete and so temporate withall, As if Rome did her men Patritians cal, I without assentation might be bolde To name you so, nor could I be control'd. VVherefore I need nor feare but you that are Of such sincerity will haue a care, To roote out these (which as they seeme to me) Be maine Corrupters of your libertie, I wish it and I hope to see it too, That when I shall come to re-visit you I may much glory and so much the more, To see them good that were deprau'd before: Nor doe I onely shadow such should giue, Example vnto others how to liue; But ev'n such vice-supporters as begin, Brauado-like to gallant it in sin: These are incorrigible saying their state Transcends the power of any Magistrate: For why they're Gentlemen, whence they alleadge They may be drunkards by a priuiledge: But I would haue you tell them this from me, There is no such thing in gentilitie, Those that will worthily deserue that name, Must by their vertues character the same: For vice and generous birth (if vnderstood) Differ as much in them, as ill from good. Besides, if they do snuffe when they're reproou'd, Or seeme as if, forsooth their blood were moov'd: Tell them that weake and slender is that towne, VVhen snuffes haue power to menace iustice down: Shew me true Resolution, they may know That God hath placed Magistrates below, Who haue power to controle and chastice sin, (And blest's that town where such commaund hath bin:) For tell me, if when great men do offend Iustice were speech-lesse, to what especiall end Should lawes enacted be? Since they do take Nothing but Flies, like th' webs which spiders make Where small ones they both ta'ne and punish'd be, While great ones breake away more easily: But rightly is it which that Cynicke sayde, Who seeing iustice on a time ore-swaid, And ouer bearded by a great-mans will, Why thus it is, quoth he, with Iustice still: Since th' golden Age did leue her, for at first She was true-bred and scorn'd to be enforst To ought but right, yea such was Time as then, “Things lawfull were most royall amongst men: But now she that should be a sharpe edg'd axe, To cut downe all sin's made a nose of waxe; Wherein it's Iustice (if I not mistake it) What ere it be, iust as the Great-men make it. But Saturne is not banisht from your towne, For well I know there's perfect iustice showne, There Themis may be sayd to haue her seate, VVhere poore-ones may be heard as well as great, There's no corruption but euen weight to all, Equally temper'd, firme, impartiall, Sincere, Iudicious, and so well approu'd, As they that iustice loue or ere haue lov'd, Are bound to hold that Corporation deere, Since in her colours she's presented there. Nor do I only speake of such as be, Iustices nam'd within your libertie, But of those men where with your Bench is grac't And by Commission ore the County plac't. There may we see one take in hand the cause, Ferreting out the secrecy of th' lawes Anatomizing euery circumstance, Where if he ought omit, its a meere chance, So serious is he, and withall so speedy As sure his Pater noster's not more ready: Yea I haue wondred how he could containe So many law-querkes in so small a braine, For as we see full of in summer time, When Sun begins more South ward to incline, A showre of haile-stones ratling in the aire: Euen so (for better can I not compare) His lawe exhaling meteors) would he Send out his Showre of law-termes vsually: So as I thought and manie in those places, That it did thunder lawe, and raine downe cases. Yea I haue knowne some strucke in such a blunder As they imagin'd that his words were thunder; Which to auoide (poore snakes) so scar'd were they, As they would leaue the Bench and sneake away. There may we see another so well knowne To penall statutes, as there is not one, (So well experienst in them he does make him) Which can by any kinde of meanes escape him. Besides for execution which we call, The soueraigne end and period of all; Yea which may truly be esteem'd the head, From whence the life of Iustice doth proceed He merits dew respect: witnesse (I say) Those whipping-stocks erected in th' high way With stockes and pilleries, which he hath set To haue the vagrant Begger soundly bet, Nor doth he want for any one of these, A statute in warme store if that he please; Which on occasion he can well produce, Both for himselfe and for his Countries vse, Another may we see, though spare of speech, And temporate in discourse, yet he may teach By his effectuall words the rasher sort, Who speake so much as they are taxed for't. Yea so discreetly sober as I wish, Many were of that temper as he is. For then I know their motions would be good, Nor would they speake before they vnderstood. Another solid, and though blunt in words, Yet marke him and his countrey scarse affords One more udicious, pithy in discourse, Sound in his reasons, or of more remorce, To such as are distressed, for he'l take, The pore mans cause, though he be nere so weake. And much haue I admir'd him in Surueigh Of his deserts showne more from day to day, That he should so disualue worldly praise, When euery man seekes his esteeme to raise. And worthyly, for neuer nature brought Foorth to the world a man so meanely wrought, Of such rare workemanship as you shall finde, In th' exquisite perfection of his minde. Yea, if too partiall though't I should not be, (In that he hath been still a friend to me) I could expresse such arguments of loue, As were of force th' obduratst hearts to moue, To admiration of those vertues rest, Within the generous table of his brest, But I haue euer hated so has hee, “To paint mens worths in words of flatterie. Yea I'doe know it derogates from worth, To haue her selfe in colours shadow'd forth, Sith vertue rather craues for to be knowen Vnto her selfe, then vnto others showen. Onely thus much ile say; ordain'd he was, Euen in his Cradle others to surpasse. Since for his education it may seeme, Being in mountaines bred, that it was meane. But now of such an equall forme combin'de As he is strong in body and in minde. Sincerely honest, and so well approu'd, As where he is not known, hee's heard &amp; lou'd, So as on Mountaines born, his thoughts aspire, To Sions mount, &amp; Ioues triumphant quire. Another there's, who howsoere he seeme, In th' eie of some distemper'd iudgements mene. In vnderstanding, I doe know his wit, Out-strips the most of those that censure it. Besides theres in him parts of more desert For Nature is supplide in him by Art. And wheras som to's wit impute the wrong, I rather doe impute it to his tongue. Since well I know by due experience, (At such times as he deign'd me conference) For reading profound reason ripe conceipts, Discourse of stories, arguing of estates, Such generall iudgement he in all did show, As I was wrapt with admiration, how M? could esteem so menely (hairebraind-elues) Of such an one was wiser then themselues. Its true indeed, hee's not intemperate. (As this age fashions) nor opinionate, But humble in his iudgement, which may be, Some cause that he is censur'd as we see. Alas of griefe, none should be deemed wise, But such as can like timists temporizè. Expose their reputation to the shame Of an offensiue or iniurious name. Whereas if we true wisdome vnderstood, We'd think non could be wise but such wer good. And though we question thus, asking what m?? Vnlesse he be a polititian, Yet pollicie will be of small auaile, When that arch polititian Machauell, Shall flame and frie in his tormented soule, Because to th' world wise, to heauen a foole. Yea I doe wish (if ere I haue a sonne) He may be so wise, as haue wit to shun A selfe conceipt of being soly wise, In his owne bleared and dim-sighted eies, For then I know there will in him apeare, A Christian zealous and religious feare, Which like an Angell will attend him still, Mouing to good, and waine him from whats ill. And far more comfort should I haue of him, Then if through vaine conceipt he should begin To pride him in his follies, for by them, We see how many roote out house and name, Yea of all vertues which subsisting be, None makes more perfect then humilitie. Since by it man deemes of himselfe and's worth, As of the vilest worme the earth brings forth. Which disesteeming I may boldly name, More noble then to glorie in our shame. For it doth leade vs in a glorious path, With safest conduct from the day of wrath. When standig 'fore that high Tribunall there We're found far better then wee did appeare. And such is hee-yet haue I heard it vowde, “Hee has not witt enough for to bee proude. VVheras wee know, and by experience see, That fooles bee still the proudest men that be. Nor is he onely humble, for I heare, Of other proper vertues which appeare In his well tempred disposition, when I hear of no complaints mongst poorer men, Who are his tenaunts for he has report, Of shewing mercy, and is blessed for't. And is not this a poynt of wisedome, say? For to prouide thus for another day That for terrestriall things, hee may obtayne A farre more glorious and transcendent gayne. Sure (I doe thinke) there is no foole to him, That does enrich his progeny by sinne, Makes shipwrack of a conscience, bars himselfe, Of after hopes to rake a little pelfe. Ruines his soule, and ads vnto the store, Of his accounts, by racking of the pore. VVhereas ofth' other side hees truely wise, (Though not to man, yet in thalmighties eies. Who pitty and compassion doth professe, To th' forlorne widdow and the fatherlesse, Does right to all men, nor will make his tongue, An aduocate for him who's in the wrong; Accepts of no aduantage, which may seeme To staine his conscience, or to mak't vncleane: Hates an oppressors name, and all his time, Was neuer wont to take too great a fine. Beares himselfe blamelesse before God and man. Hee's truely wise, or much deceau'd I am. Indeed he is, and such an one is plast, In that same Mirror which I spake of last. VVho without assentation may be said, To haue a patterne vnto others laid, In actions of this kind, yea I may sweare, Rather for these respects I hold him deare, Then for his state, which may be well exprest, To equall, if not to surmount the best. But Iu'e too farre digrest, in breefe it's he, VVho hates the leuen of the Pharisee, And (which is rare) 'mongst richer men to find, He counts no wealth like th' riches of the mind. How happy you (Graue Elders) to haue these, Assistants in your peace, meanes for your ease, So as their serious care ioyn'd to their powers, May seeme in some degree to lessen yours, For powers vnited, make the army stronger, “And minds combin'd preserue that vnion longer. O may there be, one mind and one consent, (Cohering in one proper continent) One firme opinion, generall decree, Amongst you all concurring mutually: And may your Throne, which such good men affords, Nere fall at oddes by multiplying words, Since the spirit of contention stirres our blood, And makes vs oft neglect a publique good. Thus with my best of wishes, I will end, Resting your euer true deuoted friend. R. B. To all true-bred Northerne Sparks, of the generous society of the Cottoneers, who hold their High roade by the Pinder of Wakefield, the Shoo-maker of Brandford, and the white Coate of Kendall: Light gaines, Heauie Purses, good Tradings, with cleere Conscience. To you my friends that trade in blacke and white, In blacke and white doe I intend to write. Where Ile insert such things are to be showne, Which may in time adde glory and renowne, To your commodious tradings, which shall be Gracefull to you, and such content to me, As I should wish, at least my lines shall tell, To after-times, that I did wish you well, And in my obseruations seeme to show, That due respect I to my country owe. First therefore ere I further goe, Ile proue, Wherein no lesse, Ile manifest my loue, Then in the greatest: that of all haue beene, Shall be, or are, you seeme the worthiest men, And this's my reason; which may grounded be, On the firme arches of Philosophy; We say, and so we by experience find, In man there is a bodie and a mind, The body is the couer and in it The minds internall soueraignnesse doth fit, As a great Princesse, much admired at, Sphered and reared in her chaire of state, While th' body like a hand-maid prest t'obey, Stands to performe, what ere her mistresse say. Yea some compare this bodies outward grace, Unto a dainty fine contriued case, Yet for all th' cost which is about her spent, She sounds but harsh, without her instrument, Which is the soule: others resembled haue, The bodies feature to a sumptuous graue, Which garnisht is without full tricke and trim, Yet has nought else, but sculls and bones within. Others compare the beauty of the mind, To pith in trees, the body to the rind. But of all others haue bene, be, or were, In my opinion none doth come so neere, In true Ressmblanes (nor indeed there can) Then twixt the mind and lining of a man, For its the inward substance which to mee, Seemes for to line the body inwardly, With ornaments of vertue, and from hence, As he excells, we draw his excellence. Then, my deere countrimen, to giue your due, From whence comes mans perfection, but from you That doe maintaine with credit your estate, And sells the best of man at easie rate, To wit, the minds resemblance, which is gotten, By those same linings which you sell of Cotten. For see those thin breech Irish lackies runne, How small i'th wast, how sparing in the bombe, VVhat Iacke a Lents they are: yet view them when They haue beene lin'd by you, theyr proper men, Yea I may say, man is so strange an Elfe, VVithout your helpe, hee lookes not like himselfe. Indeed if we were in some parts of those, Sun-parched countries, where they vse no clothes, But through the piercing violence of heat, VVhich in some places is intemporate, Th' inhabitants go naked, and appeare In grisly sort, as if they frenticke were, Then you that make vs man-like, should not need, Nor your profession stand in any steed, For why? the clymate which we then should haue, No Bombast, Cotten, or the like would craue: Since scorching beames would smoulder so about them, As th' dwellers might be hot enuffe without them. But heer's an Island that so temprate is, As if it had plantation to your wish. Neither so hote, but that we may abide, Both to be clad and bombasted beside. Neither so cold, but we may well allow it, To weare such yarne, a blind man may looke through it. Its true indeed, well may it be confest, If all our parts were like some womens brest. Bared and painted with pure Azure veines, Though of themselues they haue as many staines, And riueld wrinkles, with some parts as badde, Then th' crooked Greeke Thersytes euer had, It might be thought your gaines would be so small, As Ime perswad'd they would be none at all: But thanks be giuen to heauens supernall powers, Which sways this Masse of earth, that trade of yours, Hath her dependance fixt in other places, Then to be tide to womens brests or faces. Let Painters and Complexion sellers looke, To their crackt ware, you haue another booke To view into, then they haue to looke in, For yours's an honest trade, but their's is sin. Next I expresse your worth in, shall be these, First, your supportance of poore families, Which are so weake in state, as I much doubt me, They would be forc't to begge or starue without ye. The second is, (wherein you'ue well deserued, The care you haue to see your Country serued, Not as such men who liue by forraine Nations, Impouerishing this Land by transportations, For their depraued Natures be well showne, By louing strangers better then their owne; Or as it seemes, to sucke their Mothers bloud, Their Natiue Countrie for a priuate good. The third and last, which heere exprest shall be, Shall reference haue to your Antiquity, All which I will dilate of, and though I Cannot describe ech thing so mouingly, As I could wish, yet take it in good part, Proceeding from the centre of a heart, That did this taske and labour vndertake, For your profession and your countries sake, Whose ayre I breath'd, O I were worthy death, Not to loue them, who suck't with me one breath. How many Families supported be, Within the compasse of one Barronry, By your profession I may boldly show, (For what I speake, I by obseruance know.) Yea by eye-witnesse, where so many are, Prouided for by your peculiar care, As many would the beggars be (I wot) If your religious care releeu'd them not. For there young brats, as we may well suppose, Who hardly haue the wit to don their clothes, Are set to worke, and well can finish it, Being such labours as doe them befit: Winding of spooles, or such like easie paine, By which the least may pretty well maintaine Themselues, in that same simple manner clad, As well agrees with place where they were bred. Each plies his worke, one cards, another spins, One to the studdles goes, the next begins To rauell for new wefte, thus none delay, But make their webbe-vp, 'gainst each Market-day, For to preserue their credit: but pray see, Which of all these for all their industry, Their early rising, or late sitting vp, Could get one bit to eat, or drop suppe. If hauing wrought their webbes, their forc't to stand, And not haue you to take them off their hand. But now by th' way, that I my loue may shew, Vnto the poorer sort as well as you, Let me exhort you, in respect I am, Vnto you all both friend and Countriman, And one that wisheth, if hee could expresse, What's wishes be vnto your Trade successe, As to himselfe, these pooremen (vnder fauour) Who earne their meanes so truly by their labour, Should not (obserue me) bee enforc't to wait, “For what you owe, and what's their due, so late, Time vnto them is pretious, yea one houre, If idlye spent, is charges to the poore: Whose labour's their Reuenue: doe but goe, To Salomon, and he will tell you so, Who willeth none, expresly to fore-slow, To pay to any man what they doe owe, But, if they haue it, not to let them stand, Crauing their due, but pay it out a hand. Say not vnto thy friend (saith Salomon) I haue not for thee now, but come anon: For why shouldst thou that hast wherewith to pay, Put of till morrow, what thou maist to day Beleeue me friends I could not choose but speake, And caution you of this, for euen the weake And impotent, whose soules are full as deere, As be the Monarchs, whisper in mine eare, And bid mee tell you yet to haue a care, Not to expresse their names what men they are, For then they doubt that you to spite them more, Would make them stay, farre longer then before. That you would see their iniuries redrest, Of which they thinke, you were not yet possest. But in transferring of the charge to such, As be your Factors, which haue had small tutch Of others griefes: your selues haue had the blame Though't seems your Factors wel deserud the same Nor would I haue you thinke Ime feed for this, For they do plead in Forma pauperis That bee my Clyents, yea Ime tied too, In countries loue to doe that which I doe: For euen their teares, mones, and distressed state, Haue made me for them so compassionate, That my soule yern'd within me, but to heare, Their mones despisd, that were esteem'd so deere, To their Creator, see their Image then; And make recourse to him that gaue it them, Whose mansion is aboue the highest sphere, And bottles vp the smallest trickling teare, Shed by the poorest soule, (which in a word) Shall in that glorious synod beare record: Where for the least non-payment which we owe, Shall passe this doome—Away ye cursed, goe. But I do know by my Experience, The most of you haue such a Conscience, As in that day, what euer shall befall, Your sincere soules will as a brazen wall, Shield you from such a censure; for to me, Some doe I know bore such integrity. As I dare well auow't, tis rare to find, In such a crazie time, so pure a mind. But now I must descend (as seemes to me) From the releefe of many Familie, By you supported, to your speciall care, To see your country serued with good Ware; Which of all others (if well vnderstood) Seemes to haue ayme most at a publique good. VVell it appeares, euen by your proper worth, That you were borne for her that brought you forth, Not for your selues, which instanced may be, In that you ayme at no Monopoly, No priuate staples, but desire to sell, (VVhich of all other seem's approu'd as well,) Your Ware in publique places, which may stand No more for your auaile, then good of th' land. Nor are you carelesse what it is you bring, Vnto your Country, for your customing, Dependance has vpon that due esteeme, They haue of you, that are the same you seem, Plaine home-bred chapmen (yet of such due note) Their word is good, how plaine so ere's their coat. Yea doe I wish, I may haue such as they, Ingag'd to me, for they'l do what they say, When silken coats, and some of them I know, Will say farre more then ere they meane to doe. Therefore it much concernes you to produce, That which you know is for a common vse. Not for the eye so much as for the proofe, For this doth tend most to your owne behoofe: VVhere Reputation doth such custome gaine, As being got is seldome lost againe. Yet sure methinks my Friends, you put to th' venture, VVhen your commodities are stretcht on th' tenter, So that as I haue heard, when come to weting They shrinke a yard at least, more then is fitting. Yet doe I heare you make excuse of this. That for your selues you know not what it is: And for your Factors what they take, they pay, If Shere-men stretch them so, the more knaues they. It's true they are so, yet for all you vse These words, beleeu't, they'l serue for no excuse, For if you will be Common-weales men, know, VVhether your Shere-men vse this feate or no, Before you buy, (which found) reprooue them then, Or else auoid such tenter-hooking men. There is a Gallant in this towne I know, (Who damnd himselfe, but most of them doe soe) If that he had not, to make cloake and suit, Some thirty yards of rug or thereabout, Yet hardly came to fifteene afterward, It had beene measur'd by the Taylors yard. Now was not this too monstrous and to badde, That it should leese full halfe of that it had? I know not what to thinke (but to be breefe) Either the Taylor was an arrant theefe, And made no bones of Theft, which is a crime, Most Taylors will dispence with at this time: Or sure, if my weake wit can iudge of it, The rugge was tentred more then did befit: But you will say, the Gallant sure did lie, Faith if you be of that minde so am I, For its searce possible so much to put, In Cloake and sute, vnlesse heed cloath his gut? (And thats of th' largest size) and so't may be, For I'ue heard one skild in Anatomie, (Auerr thus much that euery gut in man For at that time his lecture then began,) VVas by due obseruation knowne to be Seauen times his length: so that it seemes to me If this be true, which Naturalists doe teach, The Taylor plaid the man to make it reach, So far, for sure the yards could not be small, That were to make cloake, sute, cloath guts, and all. But I doe finde you guiltlesse, for I know, As to your Countrey, you your liues doe owe, If priuare harmes might propagate her good, (For Countries loue extends vnto our blood) So there's no Commerce which you entertaine, Aymes not in some part at a publique gaine; And that's the cause, Gods blessings doe renew Making all things to cotton well with you. “Now to the third Branch, is my muse addrest, To make your Trades Antiquity exprest, If I had skill but rightly to define, Th' originall foundation and the time, The cause of your encrease, and in what space, The people you Commerst with, and the place Of your first planting, then it might appeare, Vpon what termes your priuiledges were: But so onfus'd be times antiquities, As it is hard directly to show these, In what especiall sort they were begun, (Yet I may doe what other men haue done) And by coniectures make your Trade displayd Speaking in Verse, what some in prose haue saide Some are opiniond that your trade began From old Carmentis, who in colours span Such exquisit rare works, as th' webs she wrought Were farre and nere by forrain nations sought. And as it may in ancient writ appeare. The Phrigian works were said to com from her. But now the better to vnfolde the same, Know that there were two women of that name, The one (for Stories manifest no lesse) Euanders mother was, a Prophetesse, Who wrot and spake in verse with such a grace, As she renoumd the Countrey where she was. The other was a Spinster, which did come, Along with Aquila (when he from Rome Marching amaine, lancht forth for Britanie) Which Coast Carmentis did no sooner see, Then she admir'd, for well she saw by vse. Th' inhabitants would proue industrious. So as in those daies rude, they grew in time, Specially Nooth-ward) by her discipline, To become ciuill, and where prompt to doe, Any set Taske this Matron put them to. Touching the place where she plantation had, Diuers Historians haue so differed, As hardly iumpe they by a hundred mile, And therefore difficult to reconcile Their different opinions: for they striue, Amongst themselues, &amp; aske wher shes'd ariue? Since it appeares when Aquila came ashore, Saue 3 or 4 choice dames, there were no more. Of woman kinde with him: for he was loath, To ship such old hags, were not for his tooth, And therefore such as bewty did adorne, Wer shipt with him: for they would serue his turne To reconcile these doubts, which seems a w?der, Know that his fleet deuided was a sunder. And driu? to sundry creeks, som East, som west, Som North, som South; for so they wer distrest. By aduerse winds (as forced from together) They were disperst, they knew not where, nor whither. In which auspicious tempest, happy stray, For happy was that tempest may you say, This modest matron with an heauy heart, Reft of her friends ariued ith North part, With som young maids which Aquila did minde To bring along to keepe his men in winde. The Port when she ariud (as't seemes to me, For I doe ground on probability, Drawne from the clime &amp; Ports description) Was the rich hauen of ancient VVorkington, Whose stately prospect merits honours fame, In nought more noble then a Curwens name. And long may it reserue that name whose worth, Hath many knights from that descent brought forth, For if to blaze true fame (I ere haue skill), In Bouskill ioynd with Curwen show't I will. Carmentis thus ariud did trauaile on To find finde some place fit for plantation: For then that Coast as we in stories reade, Lay wholy wast, and was vnpeopled. Where in her progresse by the way she came, She gaue to sundry places disserent name. “Mongst which her owne name, whence it is they say, Cartmell or Carment-hill holds to this day Her Appelation: and now neere an end Of her set iourney, as she did descend Downe from the neighbouring Mountaines, she might spie, A woody vale, seat'd deliciously. Through which a pleasant Riuer seemd to glide, VVhich did this vale in equall parts deuide, This hauing spide, (on Stauelaies Cliffes they say) She laid her staffe, whence comes the name Staffe-lay. Corruptly Staulay, where she staid a space, But seeing it a most notorious place, And that the trades men were so giuen to th' Pot, That they would drinke far more then ere they got. She turnd from thence, yet left some Maids behinde. That might acquaint them in this wool worke kinde. VVhile she did plant as ancient Records be, Neerer to Kendall in th' Barronrie. Thus haue I drawne your linage as it was, For other Accidents I let them passe, Onely such things as most obseruant were, (As the erection of your Sturbidge faire. I thought to shadow briefely, which began, On this occasion by a Kendall man, Who comming vp or downe I know not well, Brought his commodities that way to sell: Where being benighted, tooke no other shield, To lodge him and his ware then th' open field: A Mastiffe had he, or a mungrill Cur, Which he still cride and cald on, Stur-bitch stur, Least miching knaues now fore the spring of day, Should come perchance, and filch his ware away. From hence they say tooke Sturbidge first her name, VVhich if she did, she neede not think't a shame, For noble Princes, as may instanc'd be, From Braches had their names as well as she: Such Romulus and Remus were, whose name Tane from a she-Wolfes dug, raisd Romes first fame, Yea Cyrus which 's as ill, (if not far worse,) Had but a Bitch (cal'd Spacon) for his nurse. For in descents, it is our least of care, To aske what men once were, but what they are. Sith great estates, yea Lordships raisd we see, (And so shall still) from th' ranke of beggarie. Yea Peasants (such hath been their happy fate) VVithout desert haue come to great estate, For true it is was said so long agon, A paltry Sire may haue a Princely Sonne. “But hast my Muse in colours to display, Some auncient customes in their high roade-way, By which thy louing Countrey men doe passe, Conferring that now is, with what once was, At least such places labour to make knowne, As former times haue honour'd with renowne. So by thy true relation 't may appeare They are no others now, then as they were, Euer esteem'd by auntient times records, Which shall be shadow'd briefly in few words. The first whereof that I intend to show, Is merry Wakefield and her Pindar too; Which Fame hath blaz'd with all that did belong, Vnto that Towne in many gladsome song: The Pindars valour and how firme he stood, In th' Townes defence 'gainst th' Rebel Robin-hood, How stoutly he behav'd himselfe, and would, In spite of Robin bring his horse to th' fold, His many May games which were to be seene, Yeerely presented vpon Wakefield greene, Where louely Iugge and lustie Tib would go, To see Tom-liuely turne vpon the toe; Hob, Lob, and Crowde the fidler would be there, And many more I will not speake of here: Good god how glad hath been this hart of mine To see that Towne, which hath in former time, So florish'd and so gloried in her name, Famous by th' Pindar who first rais'd the same? Yea I haue paced ore that greene and ore, And th' more I saw't, I tooke delight the more, “For where we take contentment in a place, “A whole daies walke, seemes as a cinquepace: Yet as there is no solace vpon earth, Which is attended euermore with mirth: But when we are transported most with gladnesse, Then suddenly our ioyes reduc'd to sadnesse, So far'd with me to see the Pindar gone, And of those iolly laddes that were, not one Left to suruiue: I griev'd more then Ile say, (But now for Brad-ford I must hast away). Brad-ford if I should rightly set it forth, Stile it I might Banberry of the North, And well this title with the Towne agrees, Famous for twanging, Ale, Zeale, Cakes and Cheese: But why should I set zeale behinde their ale? Because zeale is for some, but ale for all; Zealous indeed some are (for I do heare, Of many zealous sempring sister there) Who loue their brother, from their heart iffaith. For it is charity, as scripture saith, But I am charm'd, God pardon what's a misse, For what will th' wicked say that heare of this, How by some euill brethren 't hath been sed, Th' Brother was found in's zealous sisters bed? Vnto thy taske my Muse, and now make knowne, The iolly shoo-maker of Brad-ford towne, His gentle-craft so rais'd in former time By princely Iourney-men his discipline, “VVhere he was wont with passengers to quaffe, “But suffer none to carry vp their staffe Vpon their shoulders, whilst they past through town For if they did he soon would beat them downe. (So valiant was the Souter) and from hence, Twixt Robin-hood and him grew th' difference; VVhich cause it is by most stage-poets writ, For breuity, I thought good to omit, “Descending thither where most bound I am, “To Kendall-white-coates, where your trade began. Kendall (to which I all successe do wish) May termed be that parts Metropolis, For seate as pleasant, as the most that are, Instanc't in th' ruin'd Castle of Lord Par. (For seate imparaled); where we may see, “Great men to fall as subiect are as we: Yea there (as in a mirror) may be showen, The Subiects fall rests in the Soueraigne's frowne. Many especiall blessings hath the Lord, Pour'd on this Towne, for what doth't not afford (If necessary for mans proper vse) Sufficient, if not superfluous? Yea I dare say (for well it doth appeare) That other places are more bound to her, Then she to any, there's no Towne at all, (Being for compasse so exceeding small, For commerce halfe so great, nor is there any That doth, consort in trafficke, with so many. But to her priuate blessings, for pure aire, Sweet holesome water, she may make compare With any clime, for aire nor piercing is, Nor in her temprate brething, too remisse: For water, Kent, whence Kendall takes her name, VVhose spring (from Kent-mere) as they say, is tane: Swift is't in pace, light-poiz'd, to looke in cleere, And quicke in boiling (which esteemed were) Such qualities, as rightly vnderstood Without'en these, no water could be good. For Wood (how well she was in fore-time growne) May soone appeare by th' store that is cut downe, Which may occasion griefe, when we shall see What want shall be to our posteritie: Yet who seekes to preuent this surely none, Th' old prouerbe's in request, each man for one, While each for one, one plots anothers fall, “And few or none respect the good of all. But of all blessings that were reckoned yet, In my opinion there is none so great, As that especiall one which they receiue, By th' graue and reuerend Pastor which they haue; Whose life and doctrine are so ioint together, (As both sincere, there's no defect in either,) For in him both Urim and Thummim be, O that we had more Pastors such as he: For then in Sion should Gods flocke encrease, “Hauing such Shepheards would not flea but fleece; Thus what wants Kendal that she can desire, Tyre's her Pastor, and her selfe is Tyre, He to mistrust her people, she to bring, Wealth to her Towne by forraine trafficking? Now must I haue the White-coates vnder-hand Who were in fore-time a defence to th' land: Yea such they were, as when they did appeare, They made their foes perfume their hose for feare, Experienst Archers, and so practis'd it, As they would seldome shoot but they would hit. So that though th' darters of rude Scythia, The golden-Archers of rich Persia, The Siluer-shields of Greece haue borne the name, Blaz'd by the partiall trumpe of lying fame. Yet in behalfe of Kendall (I durst sweare it) For true renovvne these Countries came not nere it.

For Townes-abuses (worshipfull Recorder) I leaue them to your discreet selfe to order: My Iourney's at an end; hic baculum fixi, My Tale concluded, nought now rests but Dixi Nor would I haue you speak that, (though you may) “Which I haue heard a countrie Maior did say, Vnto a Scholler, who concluded had His latine speech with Dixi I haue sayd: To whom th' vnletter'd Maior to aproue the same Replying thus, tooke Dixi for his name. “If that thy name be Dixi sure I am, Dixi's learned vnderstanding man. To the Lands-lord wheresoeuer. Lands-lord to thee, addrest to speake I am, And full as much to thee as any man: For many Errors and fowle crimes I knowe That thou art more then others subiect toe, Which ile in part, vnrip, and so make cleere, As in that day, when all men shall appeare Before their heauenly Lands-lord, where is had A dew accompt: This now which I haue sayd May be a witnesse, and beare record still, That thou didst know before thy Maisters will, Which not perform'd thou know'st what thou hast read “With manie stripes thou shalt be chastised, But first, ere I proceed, so great's the cries Of widdowes, and so many tere-swolne eyes Of Orphanes succourlesse that reach to heauen, As I'me well-nigh into amazement driuen, And cannot perfect what I do entend, Vntill I see their sorrowes at an end, At least allayd (for I am forc't to keepe, A consort with these silly soules that weep:) So moouing is their passion (as in briefe) So strong's compassion, I do feele their griefe.

Cease, cease (poore iuiur'd soule) your teres to shed, Weeping for that cannot be remeded, 'Lasse you are farre deceiu'd; if you suppose Teres can moue Lands-lords: they are none of those, Their dispositions are more harder far, Then any other of Gods creatures are: For tell me (starueling) hath thy trickling eye, Pale-colourd uisage heauen ascending crie, Earth bending knees hart throbbing languishment, Eccoing sighs, souls-fretting discontent, Famine at home, surcharg'd with sorrowes loade, Debt with a Sergeant dogging thee abroad, Haue any these whereof thou hast had part, Been of that force to mollifie his heart?

Fie take vpon thee some more manlinesse, Rouse thy deiected spirits which now lie, As if surprised by a lethargie; Wipe, wipe those eyes with briny streamelings drownd, And plant thy selfe vpon a firmer ground, Then thus to wast thy griefe enthralled heart, Which done: pray tell me but, what better art?

How thinks 't of this? will not these things enforce In thy relentlesse Lands-lord a remorse, Sooner and deeper (of that minde am I) Then puling with thy finger in thine eye. Well I will make attempt (which if it fall Out to my wishes as I hope it shall) The onely fee which I expect of thee, Is that thou wouldst poure out thy prayers for me, Meane time pray for thy selfe (while I expresse Thy grieues, and heauens grant to my hopes successe.) Now (rent-inhauncer) where away so fast? Pray stay a little sit for all your haste: Perchance you may more profit by your stay, Then if you should leaue me and goe your way: For I coniecture whither you are going, Nay, (doe not blush) to some poore snakes vndoing, To root out some poore Family or other; Speake freely man do not your conscience smother; Ist not (you Suck-blood) to oppresse the poore, And put him and his children out a dore; Ist not to take aduantage on some thing Or other for his vtter ruining: Ist not because thou art not halfe content That he should sit vpon so easie rent. And therefore takes occasion vpon naught, Forgiuing somthing he neither said, nor thought. If such effects make thee abroad to come, Thou might with safer conscience stay at home. For whence be these exactions thus to stretch, And racke thy Tenants? thou wilt say, t'enrich Thy priuate Coffers, which in time may, be A faire estate to thy posteritie. Or if not to encrease thy wealth, or store, For to maintaine thy ryot or thy whore. O thou forlorne and miserable man, Come these conclusions from a Christians? Be these the ends whereto thou wert created, To loue those things which make thy soule most hated? Ime sorry for thee, (yet vnhappy Elfe) Why should I grieue that grieues not for thy selfe? How canst thou thinke thy children shall possesse, Long that estate is got by wickednesse? Or how imaginst that it can succeede VVell with thy short liu'd heires, or with their seede, VVhen all that welth (was gathered to their hand.) Came from the cries and curses of the land? No no, thou greedy spunge that sucks vp store, Yet more thou suckes, thou needest still the more. Euill got goods (howbeit neare soe fayre) Seldome enioyed are by th' third heire For wauering is that slate is raisd by wrong, Built its on Sand, and cannot hold out long. Yea I haue seene (euen in that little time Which I haue liu'd) Som of you in their prime. And so erected to the height of state, As you might seeme to be admired at. For braue attendance, sumptuous attire, For fare &amp; pleasure what you could desire. In building gorgeous so as you might be Styled the heires of Earths felicitie. Yet 'lasse (againe) how quickly haue I seene, These men shrunke downe, as if they had not been: Their pompe decreas'd, their great attendance gon, And for their many dishes one, or none? True; for how can it any other's chuse, Since God hath promisd not to blesse that house, Which aimes at welth, and honour, for to rise By Orphanes teares, and woefull widows cries. Then for the first thou sees how it is vaine, To thinke that thy posterity can raigne Or long abide in that estates possession, Is got by fraud, collusion, or oppression. Now I will see whereto thy labours tend, To squize the poore that thou may better spend On wanton consorts (Souls eternall curse) The first was ill, but this is ten times worse. Its well obseru'd, that when wee doe begin, One sinne's attended by an other sinne. They come in paires, which seemes approud to be. In none oppressor better then in thee. Its not enough to prey vpon the Poore, But thou must spend his state vpon thy whoore. So that me thinkes I almost might auer, Its rather he then thou maintaineth her. Must his night cares and early rising to, His dayly labours, when and where to sow His painefull tillage, and his slender fare, His griefe when's crops the lesse successiue are, His many howers of want, few of content, His special care to pay his Lands-lords rent, Must he that earnes his liuing best we know, (Being as God command'd) in's sweat ofs Brow, Must he the sleepes with many a troubled head, To finde his wife and hungry children bread, Must he (I say) for all his lifes disquiet, Maintaine thy whoredome and excessiue riot, Must he support thee in thy vaine delights, Thy midnight reuels, and thy pagent sights, Thy new inuented fashions, and thy port, Must he at th' Cart, maintaine thy pride at Court, If this he doe? this doome to thee is giuen, Court it on earth, thou's neuer Court in Heauen. No Ahab no, there is no place for such, Whom poore mens grieues and sorrowes will not tutch. Such as will haue compassion, shall be there, Receiud in mercy that had mercy heere. But such as thou, who in the Pride of heart, Had little feeling of an others smart, Shall heare that Ue, Away thou cursed goe, “Repent in time, or thou shalt finde it so: For tell me? why should whorish complement Force thee to soules eternall languishment. Why should a minutes pleasure take from thee. All after hope of thy felicitie, VVhy should a painted cheeke be so sought after, Beleeu't in common sense it merits laughter That her complexion should by thee be sought, That knows its not her owne, but that't was bought, Yea one would thinke more reason theres to seeke, “Complexion in the shop, then on the cheeke. And better wil't with generous humors stand, To buy't at first then at the second hand: Both's to be bought: no difference in the sale; The one in grosse, the other in Retaile. O then take heede, mix not two sinnes in one, Sinnes linkt together make the soule to groane. Their burdens heauy yea tis such as they, Draws in in Cart-ropes (as the Prophets say) But if thou wilt needes to perdition run, And follow on that chase thou hast begun, If thou wilt make thy body (in few words) A filthy Caske, or Cage of vncleane birds, If that same soule, which should a Temple be, And dedicated to Gods Maiesty, Must now be made (it grieues me to expres) A stew for Harlots and licentiousnesse. Yet let not thy oppression be the meanes For to maintaine such prostituted queanes, That doe expose themselues to publique shame, “One sin's enough: shun thou oppressions name. I know indeede what was of Ahab tould Is growne a story now exceeding old. His mouldred bones and ashes who can finde, Yea his example's quite worne out of minde, Since for most part, mens corps's no sooner rotten, Then they and all their actions be forgotten. The stories old indeed, its true they say, Yet is the vse experienst euerie day, “Ech day we see a silly Naboth slaine, “And euery day a wicked Ahab raigne. Who if he see one plat of ground that is Delightfull in his eye, or bordering his; Whether't be vineyard, garden, or that land, (The front I mean) where Naboths house doth stand, He cannot be content till he has got, By fraud or violence, that same neighbouring plot. For like an eye-sore, it did euer grieue him, Nor till ge gain'd it, would he euer leaue him. Yet for all this, our moderne Ahabs they, No sooner heare what sacred Scriptures say, Of that example, then they straight begin, To giue a curse to Ahab and his sinne. Who made no bones (poore Naboth to denye him) To haue one little Vineyard lying by him. Cruell he was, say they, and well deseru'd His punishment; for he was rightly seru'd. To be depriu'd of all, life, realme, and crowne, That would not suffer Naboth haue his owne. Yea the reward did fit his Tyrant-hart, Despoyl'd of all, that spoyld the poore of part. So their owne iudgements (most vnhappy Elues) That thus pronounce the sentence on themselues. Their owne mouthes do condemn them, for by this Each proue their guilt by th' guilt they show of his. VVherefore as Nathan did to Dauid say, Taking Vriahs life and wife away, VVhere he proposd this question thereupon. Of him had many Sheepe, another one: Wherein indeed the Prophet shadowed, That fact which Dauid to Vriah did, Which when that good King heard, as th' Scripture saith He answered straight, he hath deserued death, Thou art the man (quoth he) so sure I am, I may be bold to say thou art the man. Thou Ahab, thou that by extortion gaines, Some Skreads of Land to better thy demains. Thou that triumphes in wrongs, and brings the crye And curse of widdowes to thy Family. Thou that with dainties dost that carrian feede, That maw of thine, while such doe begge their bread, As thou opprest, (to their extremest wrong,) Thou art the man, Ile sing no other song. Dost thou not yet relent? no streams of grace, Thrilling or trickling from thy blubber't face: No signe of reformation? Las I see, Custome in sinne cannot relinquisht be Vpon the instant, wherefore I must set My resolution not to leaue thee yet, And howsoere thou take it, I will goe, Yet further with thee Ile not leaue thee so, Two speciall motiues I might here produce, To moue thee to a conscience, and to vse. A christian-like respect to such as be, Ordain'd by God for to liue vnder thee: The first is: to haue eye vnto that forme Or image, which doth euery man adorne, Euen his creators image, which might moue Vs to loue him for his creators loue. The second is: a due especiall care, Or a consideration what wee are, Men; and in that we should be humbler still, “Since best of vs, are Tennants but at will: On which two branches briefly Ile dilate, Or rather cursiuely so shadow at, As seeing his Forme, thy little cause of pride, This good surueigh may make thee mortified. The comely feature which is giuen to man, Implies the place from whence this creature came, Euen from that fragrant garden of delight, That Spicy Eden, where in our makers sight, He did enioy farre more then tongue can tell, Till from that height he to corruption fell: Yet still retain'd his forme which first was giuen him In Paradise, whence now the Lord had driuen him? So precious was this forme (as he who made it, For as we reade in Scripture, where he said it, Let vs make man after our Image: he Saw in this forme (I say) such maiestie As he who (in his mercy fast did make it) Becomming man of God, vouchsaf'd to take it. So that what th' first man Adam did before Christ, th' second Adam as man, did restore. Thou sees this Image then how it was giuen And represented by the God of heauen, Who in his great compassions, thought 't no scorne, That the Creator take the creatures forme. And how canst thou (irreuerent wretch) disdaine That forme which thy Creator did retaine? How canst despise that image, or presume To wrong that shape thy Sauiour did assume? How canst thou presse that soule with discontent, Which thy Redeemer daign'd to represent? How canst abuse that type for hope of pelfe, Which Christ thy louer shadowed in himselfe? How canst thou see that image rack't to be, VVhich in thy Christ was ract and rent for thee? How canst endure to haue that soule bereft, Of all releefe, and to haue nothing left, Driuen from his house, forc't from his Tenant-right, VVhen he that is the way, truth, life and light, Taking his forme to satisfie for sinne, Had not so much as house to hide him in. Birds had their nests, and euery beast his denne, Yet had not he what was permitt'd to them. O let me now perswade, be not extreame, (Its easie saies the Prouerb) to wade the streame, Where th' foord's at lowest, recollect to minde. His noble image, and in it thou'l finde, Such singular impressions of reguard, As I doe thinke thou'l honourt' afterward. VVhen thou obseru's, ther's nothing that's in him, VVas not before in Christ excepting sinne. O then refine the ayme of thy intents, In raising rents, thinke on thy Sauiours rents. In taking of aduantage, thinke on this, If God aduantage take for each amisse, In what a case wert thou, how woe-begon, That of a thousand cannot answer one? If thou to grieue Gods little ones begin, Thinke therewithall, that thou art grieuing him. VVho in his mercy hares the widdowes crie, And in his pitty wipes the Orphanes eye, VVhich thou hast cause to thinke on, so much rather Sith God's the widdows Iudge, the orphans Father: And though earths Iustice, be of th' second sight, Yet hee's so iust, hee'l doe the poorest right. But if mans Image, which were strange, should faile, VVith thy remorselesse conscience to preuaile, From that transparent Mirror, Ile descend. Though it may seeme in it to comprehend All humane glory, yea I may say more, The forme of God which he assum'd before, Vnto that due obseruance, or that care, VVhereby we come to acknowledge what we are. Man's of a substance meane, hauing his birth, As his first natiue Mother, from frayle Earth, Brittle's his composition, and so weake, Be his resolues, as hee can vndertake Nought with so firme a purpose as may stand, Or will not change with th' turning of a hand. His health's a stranger to him, for when most, It seemeth with him, it is soonest lost; For his abiding, hee's as in a Tent, VVherein hees militant, not permanent. The world's his campe, his profest enemies, VVherewith he is to grapple, they be these. The turbulent affections of his mind, Which euery houre is seuerally inclin'd. The goale which he doth ayme at, or th' reward, After the fight, hee lookes for after-ward: Thus thou may see, in this same earthly cell, Though dwell we seeme, indeed, we doe not dwell, But soiourne: Its no mansion but an Inne, Syons our home, this pilgrimage is sinne. As for our states, we are but leacers all, And shall be put off, when hee's pleasd to call, Yea I may rather say (and not amisse) VVe are the Lessees, he the Lessour is. And howsoere our Lands-Lords make accompt, They'r but inferiour Lords, hee's Paramount. Then if thou wilt but duely looke vpon't, Thy tenure stands vpon a tickle point, Yea I doe find thy state not worth a straw, If I haue any iudgement in the law: And why shouldst thou bring poore men into suit, Sith thou thy selfe hast no state absolute, But for thy terme of life: so as methinks, VVhen that French gibberish to my braine-pan sinks VVhere Iohn a Stiles and 's neighbour Iohn an Okes, VVith many other Law-baptized folkes, Are brought in seaz'd of land, as they doe finde, In Burrow, English, Soccage, Gauell-kinde, Fee-tayle, fee-simple (it oft seemes to me) These Lawyers are the simplest men that be; Who are perswaded (and would haue vs too) But let's discent from them:—theres fools enough: That of al states and Tenures are possest, Or can bee had, Fee-Simple is the best. Whereas I thinke, if well they vnderstood, What specially concern'd them, and their good. They would conclude, Fee-simple will not doe, A double-Fee is better of the two. If we could find indeed a difference, In th' liues of th' tenures, then there were some sence To say, that such a tenure were the strongest; Because by it the Tennant liues the longest. But tell me, are not all estates that be Subiect alike to mutability: To the possessour you will say they are; If vnto him, why should we further care, Since as the Prouerbe is, when is gone, The world's gone with him, as all in One: O then thou Earth-bred worme, why shouldest thou vant, As if thou wert a Lord prædominant. Why shouldst triumph ore th' meaner sort of men, Since thour't composd of one selfe Mould with th?? Thou art but Adams sonne, and so are they, Both of you fram'd and fashion'd of one clay, Both haue one image: then compassion take, If not for them, yet for their image sake. For though thou canst not one good looke affoord, To these poore snakes, they'r deere vnto the Lord, As is thy selfe, as pretious in Gods eies, Bought and redeemed with as great a price. And though there be twixt Substitutes and Kings. Superiour states, and lower vnderlings, A difference in the world, yet there shall Twixt them (in heauen) no difference be at all, Onely what's good shall approbation haue, With King and subiect, conquerer and slaue. O then receiue the bowells of compassion, And beare like mind, as thou dost beare like fashion: Let thy vnrighteous Mammon get thee friends, That when thy pilgrime daies of Labour ends, Thou may possesse a glorious heritage, After the period of this pilgrimage. My lessons are but short, pray then remember, As thou the welfare of thy soule dost tender. “The best of vs are tennants but at will, “And stand in hazard of disseisure still. And though our states seeme firmer then the rest, They are vncertaine tenures at the best. In briefe, thou earthly Lands-lord striue to be, As thou wouldst haue Heauens Lands-lord towards thee Not too extreame: thou knowst the doome is giuen, That no extortioner shall enter Heauen. Resolue what thou wilt doe: for though it grieue me To leaue thee yet, I am enforc't to leaue thee, And turne vnto thy Tennant, who dismaide, Stands heere at doore to heare what I haue said. To the Tennant howsoeuer. What state soeuer thou art seazed on, Or in what Tenure thou dost hold vpon, Il'e now addresse my speech in briefe to thee, Wherein Iayme in part to comfort thee, In part to rectifie what may seeme ill, In thy peruerse and vn-conformed will; That in them both for th' loue which I doe owe, To him thou represents, I may so show, That deere affection which we're bound to beare, To one another while we soiourne heere, As when an end of all our sorrowes are Reduc'd to one set period, and our care Shall haue a finall end, what I haue done, “In loue may be approu'd when I am gone. To moue thee vnto comfort, in a word, I'le vse th' perswasion which I gaue thy Lord, To humble his ambicious spirit, when I told him of the different state of Men, How in the eyes of men indeed they were Esteemed great, but when they should appeare, Before that high Tribunall, where all should, (Though if they might auoid it, many would,) Make their appearance, then the great should know, They were no more respected then the low: One aduocate, one Iudge, one barre one triall, Conscience the onely difference, when Deniall, Seald with abite, or th' accursed doome, Or th' inuitation with Uenite come, Shall in that generall iudgement there expresse, Or weale, or woe, or hell, or happinesse: “So as when all are summon'd fore that seat, It's better to be good, then to be great. For then, as well it may be vnderstood, They onely shall be great that are found good. But thou wilt aske, is there no comfort else? Yes that there is, thy daily labour tells, There's a reward of glory that's reseru'd, For such as haue their Maister duely seru'd, In their vocation: there's a penny too, Which though it be not giuen vnto thee now, Yet be assur'd, (for he that spoke't is true) “When th' euening comes, thou shalt receiue thy due. And though thou seeme a little while to stay, Doe not repine, it's th' euening crownes the day. Wouldst know what I by th' Euening doe intend? I meane the sun-set of thy life or end Of all thy pilgrime daies, which though they bee, A very death, or Martyrdome to thee, (So little ioy conceau's thou vpon earth,) Yet wil thy Comicke end include thy mirth, VVhen from this Vale of labour and of care, Thou shalt vnto amount of ioy repaire. VVhen from this floting Sea, this fading cell, Thou shalt depart, and with thy Sauiour dwell. Yea on thy death-bed thou art comforted, Thinking how truly thou hast laboured. How many carefull nights thou hast orepast, VVithout the least of rest, how thy repast, VVas not delightfull feeding with excesse, But th' bread thou eate was mixt with carefulnesse; Noe houre without affliction or some griefe, And now to finde to all thy woes reliefe It may no little solace the, when th' end Of discontents shall bring thee to a friend That will in armes of charitie receiue thee, Where beeing lodg'd, no woe, no want can grieue thee. Happy translation, and by so much more, In that those Lordings which triumph'd before, And plaid vpon thy weakenesse, now shall stand, To th' doome which those oppressors of the land, Are subiect to: tell me (poore wormeling) then, What difference there will bee twixt thee and them? Great were they heere indeed, and did resemble, Those Bulls of Basan, yet see how they tremble, How quicke their powerfull greatnesse is made small, For little is their pompe, or none at all: See, see these Cedars now are strucke with thunder, And thogh they once sate high, their now broght vnder Those glorious titles which gaue wings to pride, Those gorgeous buildings made them deifide. Those many state-attendants, more or lesse, Like Sommer-Swallows following their successe. Are vanish't, ruin'd, and dispersed quite, Ther's none of these can come into their sight, Yea which is worse in-steed of Eminence; There is an enemy called Conscience, That still disturbs their quiet and their rest: VVhich if at peace there were continuall feast. But that's impossible, such meanes as these; Haue in themselues a thousand Witnesses, And these poore snakes cause they did heere contemn them, Shall with their Conscience stand there to condemne th?, VVhere that same place, they are appointed to Shall Tophet be, their word, yee cursed goe. Thou seest then no difference doth appeare, Twixt thou and them saue onely when you're heere A little garish vanity there is, Which doth include that happinesse of his, Who seemes so popular, yet thou shalt see, From thence is drawne his greatest miserie. For (tell me) doth no that externall state, Make him forget whereto he was create Doth't not be lull his soule in sinnes delights, (Not knowing how the flesh gainst spirit fights,) VVhereby he comes, which is the worst of all, To bring his reason to his senses thrall. Yea I haue heard of many great mens end, So full of feare and horrour as God send Me lesse delights on earth, so I may haue, A quiet easie passage to my graue. “For reason doth informe me, rare it is, That earths delight should bring a man to blisse. More could I speake to comfort thy distresse, And more I was determinde, I confesse, To insist on thy affliction, but I found, By my Experience this especiall ground, Held euer firme when we doe comforts tutch, Such is mans nature he will take too much, Rather then too too little, yea its sed; More haue through store of comforts surfeted, Then such as from all outward solace pent, Haue famisht been through inward discontent. With Gedeons souldier therefore prest I am, Rather to lap, and like a Ionathan, To tutch the hony onely with my rod, Then on this subiect make too long aboad. Which that I may, from comfort Ile descend, To faults in the which I would gladly mend. That God commands from wh? proceeds all power, “Let each be subiect to's Superiour. For it would breed confusion in the Land, If people did admit of no commaund. But like a Platoes Common-wealth, should be, Subiect to none, but in equalitie. Therefore that Lord, who of his grace doth loue vs, Hath ranked some below vs, some aboue vs. Aboue vs, that we might be caution'd thence, To shew vnto them due obedience. Below vs, that we might thereby expresse, To them our loue, to God our thankefulnesse, Our loue, that we might our affection show, In loue to them that ranked are so low. Our thankefulnesse, that we should more receiue, Then other some, that more deserued haue. Againe, aboue vs, to acknowledge here, Without that power aboue, how weake we are. Below vs, that if we vnhappy Elues, Should grudge to see som greater then our selues, By seeing these wee might suppose they're sent, By their degree to bid vs be content, In this same decent comly order then Of high and low, great and inferiour men, Thou ranked art, nor richest, nor most pore, For thou seest many goe from dore to dore, Whose scrips their store, whose wallet is their wealth, Whose staffe's their stay, whose treasure is their health. Now in thy ranke there's many things I wish Thou wouldst reforme, which I doe see amisse. “As first for all thy pouerty and want, Thou hast a disposition arrogant: Rash, heady, selfe-wild, prouder then thy state Can well beare out, extreamely obstinate, Foolishly peremptory, saucy with all, Besides I see in thee (I must tell all) A factious wauering nature, apt to rise Through discontent, in any enterprise. A very Iack Straw, or a custome asse, Alleadging such records as neuer was. A pest'lent member to the Kingdomes quiet, Prone to diuision, enmity and riot, Sower of discord, selfe-conceitedly Wise, yet I cannot well imagine why. Yea, I haue seene, some of thy crew to gather, Like wild-geese for the wagging of a feather, Making strange combinations, which did tend, Still to their owne subuersion in the end. Some Terme agoe on one I chanct to light, Was come to towne to trie his tenant-right, With whom discoursing, he impart'd to me, Mongst other things how most iniuriously He and the rest which held one tenure there, About their state or title troubled were, And therewithall alleadgd that he could show, Customes and discords (so he said) enough, And that from Noahs indignation, when Of all the world there were but left 8 men; No, this is true, quoth he, I will assure yee, Without delayer pannelled a Iurie: Where those 12. men (the number scarse holds right) Rising to 12, that were before but eight, Found that our ancestry did hold in pottage, Now I imagine he did meane in Soccage, Which to make sure, this Custom speakes for vs, And he with that draws forth a Mittimus. This I may sweare, more then a sennet after, I could not thinke on, but was forc't to laughter. But now to thee, for I haue done thee wrong, To keepe me from discourse with thee so long, Whom I resolu'd to haue aduertised, Of these precedent errors mentioned; “Conforme thy will vnto thy Lords commaund In fitting things, thou liu'st vpon his land. And art his liedge-man, therfore thou shouldst sho Thy selfe to him, as thou thy selfe doest owe. Vnto the Heyre to, a respect is due, For time may come when he shall pleasure you. Yet meane I not that thou shouldst pay a Fine, Unto the heire now in his Fathers time, “For if I were an heire as I am not, “Belieue it I would thinke that fine ill got. What I doe wish to the is briefely this, Successe in thy estate, as thou wouldst wish, Conformed so vnto thy Lands-Lord heire, That with heauens Land-lord thou may liue elsewhere. FINIS.</field>

The Argument of Pyramus and Thysbe. Childrens loue and Parents hate, Pure affection cros'd by fate. True their loue, so true to either, That they chusd to die together. Curteous woodnimphs, Tigres fierce, “Wash with teares their doleful hearse, Mirtle branches, roses sweete, “Satyres strow about their feete. Woodnimphs with their Syrens voice, Call their parents by their noise. Who with pace (slow pace God wot,) “Made hast they could, yet hasted not; Till they saw their children lie, “Arme in arme full louingly. Oft they sought, but all in vaine, To bring life to them againe. Trickling teares came dropping downe, “Groues with teares were ouerflowne, Water mixt with crimson blood, “Made a deluge where they stood. Thisbees obsequies they see, “Grauen in an Oliue tree, Their bones to ashes they doe burne And place them in one sacred vrne. That as their loue was all in all, So they might haue one Buriall. To this shrine, this statue faire, Louers wont for to repayre. Who to confirme their sincere Loue, Offered them a Turtle Doue. But when their reliques scattered were, Maids nere after offered there Their wonted incense, but forsooke, The Altar which was wont to smoke, With mirrhe and thime, which they did burne, With solemne rites about their vrne. Yet lest their fame should so decay, Their tombe is to be seene this day, Which first erected was to be, Conseruer of their memory. Pyramus and Thysbe. Nimrods faire City, beauteous Babylon, which admirations eies once gaz'd vpon, Though grac'd in all, in nought so gracious, as in her Thysbe, and yong Pyramus. Thysbe a maid as faire, as faire could be, he for his sexe, was full as faire as she. These two resplendent starres, shone in one sphere, and by contiguate mansions bordering neere, Renewd their loues vnhappy memory, press'd downe too much by parents iealousie. Aye me too iealous, to preuent that good, of sincere loue which cannot be withstood. These two debar'rd of meeting, not of louing, for loue, though smothred, hath an inward moouing Sought means to shew their mutual loue by woing, supplying that in words, they mist in doing. Their walls abutting neree, so neere did meet, That these two Saints might each another greete. A chinke there was, which Thysbe soone espies, for maids in wanton feats, haue Linceus eyes. VVhich beeing seene (well seene) she did repaire each morne betime to see if he were there: At last he spies it, (men haue duller witte, then women haue, yet better manage it.) This crany was the shrine to which they came, where either call'd on other, by their name. And with deuotion ech to other kneeled, protesting loue, hid loue, so long concealed. VVhy should our Parents, Pyramus would say, seeke to protract our loues by long delay? Or why should we, with such precisenesse shunne, that which our parents long before haue done? Suppose their loue was pure: our loue's as pure, they full as fond as we, were drawen to th' lure. And why, my Thysbe, should that comely face, for all her feature, haue a ciphers place? Thou art no shadow, but a substance (deare) in substances, impressions best appeare. Then for my loue, thy ioy, and beauties sake, that seemes eclyps'd, let me th' impression make. Lets to the field, aye me, we cannot goe, we are immur'd within the grate of vvoe; And why should I, fond man, my Thysbe moue, to vvanton pleasure? vvhere's no vse of loue; I knovv thou lou'st, in that thy griefe is more, pent from that S? vvhich thou vvould fain adore. Thysbe stood peeping through this narrovv chinke and though she spake nought, yet shee more did think, Her blush, her smile, her bittng of her lip, did all the secrets of her hart vnrippe. Thus whilst they stood both standing at a bay, wishing some priuate passage, or some way, To consummate their vowes: in comes her mother, which made them take their leaue one of another. She skoold her daughter: vvhat my tricksie girle, are you besotted with this worthlesse pearle, This beauties blossome? faire enough, but poore, dote on the rich, affect his rags no more. Mother (quoth Thisbe) you are much decau'd, if I may speake with reuerence, he nere crau'd Loue at my hands: what did he here, quoth she, that he so priuate should discourse with thee? He is (quoth Thisbe) come from Salamine, and brought me grapes, pluckt from that tender vine Ætolus planted, which she gaue in hast, vnto her mother, praying her to tast: Shee tooke and tasted: fruits variety seru'd at that time for her Apology. The pitchy shade of night-approach't at hand, vvhen Screech-owles, Fauns, and Satyres haue c?m?d Where skipping in their lawne and flowry groue, Siluane to Siluane consecrates his loue. Yet when each chirping bird, goes to her nest, loues eyes be open, and can take no rest. Beasts to their caues resort, surcease to prey, feeding on that they purchas'd by the day. Each creature in his kind dispos'd to sleepe, but feruent loue continuall watch doth keepe: He tosseth in his bed, wishing it day, hoping thereby his cares to throw away. Yet when the night is past, the day yeelds more, then ere the night affoorded him before. Thus Pyramus enthrall'd twixt hope and feare, hopes, though smal fruit of hope in him appeare. He cannot sleepe nor wake, but twixt them both, sleeping and waking as a letharge doth. Oft would he hugge his pillow in his arme, and cling it fast about, to keepe it warme. Supposing it was Thysbe, and would sweare, no creature ere could be more welcome there, Streight would he call on Hymen, then inuite, his friends and kinsfolke to his nuptiall rite. And faigning their replies, thanks he would giue, vowing requitall once, if he should liue. Oh what distractions haunt a louers minde passing those bounds which nature hath assign'd, Nought vpon earth, but limits hath we see, but boundlesse loue can nere contained be. Hearbs yeeld a soueraigne cure to euery wound, but for loues cure, in hearbs no vertue's found. Then blest is he, and in an happie state, who for loues dart is made inuulnerate. Yet was it hard to see and not to loue, Thysbe's admired beauty, which could mooue, Serp?ts, birds, pl?ts brute beasts which grase &amp; feed, more then ere Orpheus with his musicke did. Her goulden tresses, pure ambrosian Fairer then all the twists Arachne span, Shone far more bright then Phœbus glistring raies, by all mens iudgements, meriting more praise; Her corall lip, (no lip) but ports of pleasure, which seem'd to open to whole mines of treasure, Appeard so sweet, that all was sweet about it, for I am sure nought could be sweet without it. Her brests two iuory mounts, mounts may I cal th? for many vales of pleasant veines empall'd them These like two borders, did such sweets display, that who lodg'd there, lodg'd in the milkie way. Below a shady vale, aye mee that shade, which nature in her owne despite had made, Had made for glory of that sacred mount, with the sweet Nectar of a liuely fount. A still distilling fount, an heauenly riuer, for theres no earthly spring can spring for euer. Her wanton gate, her glance, her smile, her toying, all ioy'd in one, shewed pleasure in enioying. So as Euphrates, vvhere this city bounded, vents vp his passions, for he oft resounded Beating his bancks, and eccoing in the aire, and then retiring backe, seem'd to despaire. That Thysbe could not loue a sencelesse one, at which repining, he vvould make his mone. Hath not my current ere renovvned beene, for th' easie passage of my quiet streame? Hath not my torrent yeelded much content, to gild his meanes, vvhose meanes vvhere vvholly spent? Haue I not suffered much? sustain'd great paines, fraughting your trauaile with a double gaines. And for supporting of so many shippes, may not Euphrates graze vpon her lippes, Whom thus he loues? vnthankfull coast (quoth he) respecting least, who did the most for thee. This being said, hee could expresse no more, but in a loue-sicke passion, bett the shore. And to confirme, what I haue heard men say, he left his course and tooke another way. If sencelesse riuers that were neuer seene to loue, or care for louing, held no meane, In their affecting Thisbe: what should hee that had both sence and reasons purity? Pure in his mind, and faire in beauties shew, Narcissus second for his comely hew: Lipp'd like Adonis, Erycina loued, shaped like Alexis Pollyos approoued. Grac'd with a smiling countenance, which did breed, a louely white, mix'd with a comely red. Two sparkling eyes pierciue as Diamond, which, whersoere they gas'd, they seem'd to wo?d, That though the Sun were set, yet his bright eies shone as the Beames which from the sun doe rise: The night being gone, too long god wot in going, her wandring lights to Tethis banks bestowing, Titan came peeping in at Thyisbes chamber, whom she reflected with her locks of amber. Each other greeting, as if had beene there, two Suns at once, both in one hemysphere. Hard was the combat, but more hard it were, to tell whose beams diffus'd their light most clear, Yet in the end Titan in an angry mood, seeming surpast, did hide him in a cloud. Thysbe puts on her cloths, blest were those cloths, thrice happy shade, that shadow'd such a Rose, Where being dressed, not dress'd as shee would bee, she tooke her to her praiers religiously. High heauens (quoth she) from whence al pleasures flow, deigne some of them on Thysbe to bestow. For by your power, which I doe much adore. I loue but that which you haue lou'd before. Thou thundring Ioue, did dote as well as I, when thou desired with Danae to lye; Which to effect, thou turn'd her to a showre. a Goulden showre her beauty to defloure, For cloth'd in lightning, Danae denaied, to ioyne with thunder: afterward arraid In dewie moisture, (moisture we do loue,) she cast off shame, and did thy shape approue. And Iuno lou's Ixion for his kisse, Venus, Adonis, for his comelinesse. Daphne (poore Laurell) chased by Apollo, running as fast before as he did follow, Thus did your loue, your lust, your thoughts renew, if I thinke ill, I thinke no worse then you. And well may gods with womens sexe dispence, Since they were first authoris'd their offence. My loue's not spotted with lasciuious tutch, vnlesse it be by louing ouermuch. Nor branded with the note of Infamie, but pure as Delia Queene of Chastitie. Thoughts are the worst, my actions they be cleare, &amp; he'se no man whose thoughts nere soyled were. Then pardon if I loue, suppose it zeale, whose passions be too hote for to conceale: Leauing her Orisons, composed of Loue, loue dallying praiers: her eyes aside she moues, And sees the chinke, which she first saw before, which did augment her dolors much the more. For shee recall'd to minde, to memory, her mothers chiding, fathers Ielousie; Both which a streame of teares extract from her, as if pale death her comforts should interre. Oft would she call on louely Pyramus, with smothered speech, as one suspitious: Lest the pure ayre, and walls adioyning neere, should prattle loue vnto her parents eare. Oft would she nibble out a stone or two, to make the crift seeme bigger to the show Of her deepe loue: for they suspected were, therefore debard, lest they should come too neer. Pyramus pent vp all this while, at last, gets out and hies him to the chinke as fast. Where what discourse their mutuall loue affoorded, seem'd by the Gods in heauen to be recorded. Either with greedy eye gasing on other, Thysbe look'd backe somtimes, doubting her mother: For she suspected much her iealous eye, in her loues presence to be euer by. Enuious vvall oft would these louers say, diuide thy selfe and let vs haue a way, To meete, to kisse, to parley and relate, the solemne festiues of our nuptiall state. Why should thy marble stuctures hold vs out, vvhose loue encircles Babilon about? Or why should terrene composition moue a breach or separaration of our loue? Loue is celestiall: thou a marble shrine, why shouldst thou hinder loue that is diuine? And yet we cannot so ingratefull be, but we must offer vp our thanks to thee; Our vowes, our giftes, our best pris'd sacrifice, in that thou yeelds a passage to our eyes, Yeelding some comfort in this gloomie night, supplying kisses with the vse of sight. Loue hath some harmonie, some small agreeing, for what it wants in tutch it hath in seeing. Hesperias garden was by serpents kept, whose euer watching eye-liddes neuer slept. And Colchis Fleece was kept as warily, till Iasons meanes obtain'd the victorie So be our loues immur'd, interred rather, by two suspicious dames, one subtile father. Then would they kisse the wall and oft entreat, that in compassion it would let them meet. We will not tell our parents, nor expresse, who twas, gaue way vnto our happinesse. Louers be faithfull, of our faiths beleeue vs, since this straight durance cannot chuse but grieue vs. The wall replyde not: yet their words had force, piersing her hardnesse, softned with remorse. For euer since, as well it may appeare, the marble sheds each morne a Trickling teare, Thus did these louers passe the weary morne, depriu'd of that which louers best adorne, And that is priuate meeting, which being missing, we beat the aire but with conceit of kissing, A vaine conceit, to dally with delight, Expecting sun-shine in a clowdy night. Imparadis'd in ioyes he cannot be, that's clad in sable roabs of misery. Oh then conceiue what sorrow he sustaines, that in perpetuall languishment remaines. O what distractions do his ioyes disseuer, feeding like vultures on his hart for euer. If Zeuxes pictured grapes, so liuely were; That many birds in flocks repaired there, Pecking vpon his statues, and did browse vpon his liuely grapes, meere liueles showes. Well may we thinke, that Ioue himselfe can make, a farre more liuely, and proportion'd shape, Then a poore painter; though his Grapes seeme ripe, yet they were drawne from Ioues first Archetype. Then Ioues best picture, Natures admiration, Thysbe, euen Thysbe made for recreation, May well be thought to draw each bird each beast, from Pastures greene, vpon her lippes to feast. It were a festiue banquet there to be, whose breath is Nectar, breathing deity. Here Pyramus would be, if heauens would grant it, for he esteemes no treasure, whilest he wants it, Since such a Iewell, such a pretious Gem, in that it's rare, is more admired by men. Thus Tantalised, the Gods doe seeme to loue him, setting him fruite, but fruite too farre aboue him: For when his lips (pure lips) should but comny them they mocke his lips and in dirision flie them. Dost flie my lips (quoth he) ô doe not flie me, for what I doe, I doe it but to trie thee, To trie thy loues which though our parents thwarted our conioin'd loue disioin'd shall nere be parted, Well may our bodies be disioin'd a sunder, but loue's to head-strong, none can keepe it vnder: Loue is free-borne, it cannot seruile be, to begge for curtesie with a bended knee. Thysbe kept concord, for each word he spake, seem'd her retired passions to awake, Stird vp her spirit, as inspir'd by fate, making her stout that was effeminate. Continue thy intendments sweete, quoth she, and as thy shadow I will follow thee, Passing a sea of dangers launching deepe, till I the shadow to the substance creepe, Passe or't as forrest, snow-cliued Caucasus, Thysbe will follow steps of Pyramus; The Riphean Mountaines, or the Hetririan plaines, Each morne resounding with the notes of swains, If thou loue Vmolus, with her fragrant spices, or Ericthea famous for deuices: Thysbe will follow thee with speed she may, only, her trauaile with thy loue repaie. But these are but discourses of our ill, which if not cured, be augmented still. For that you know renues the maladie, which rubs the sore, and yields no remedie: For why should any labour me remoue, From that admired mirror whom I loue. And I am of that nature: more they hold me, from fancying thee, more passions do enfould me; Then plot (my Pyramus,) contriue, inuent, that we may harbour loue in loues content, Till wearied with ioy, wearyed too soone, thou leaue adoring of the watrie Moone. Where being cloyed with the sweetes of loue mayst leaue the vale, and taste the fruits aboue. Thou art my sheepheard, I will be thy plaine, I the poore cottage, thou the homely swaine, Thou shalt refresh thy selfe vpon my banckes, which hauing don, I know thou'le giue me thanks, For my diffused streames, streams meerely sent, not much enforc'd from Thysbes continent, Come then, for why should any marble wall being materiall substance, so appall Our ardent wishes, wishes which proceede from loue-sick passions, which more passions feed Let our distilling teares congeal'd in one, dissolue the hardnes of this flinty stone. Remorse may moue this stone by diuine wonder, to let vs meet, diuide herselfe a sunder. This said, maine riuers of distreaming teares, in their woes-torrents purblinde eies appeares, Seeking, but seeking all in vaine God wot, to moue that shrine which weeping moued not. It wept to see true loue so straite confinde, disioyn'd by fates, which fauours had combinde. It wept to see their parents so vnkinde, to curbe their bodies presence, whose pure minde, Rapt with content of seeing, not enioying, acts discontent, debard of further toying. It wept to see their minds so well agreeing in one selfe place, not to haue one selfe-being. It wept and much repin'd that dismall fate, Should crosse pure loue by loue-disioyned hate: And pittying their case shed many a teare, Shedding so many, she her selfe did were. Oh what hard harted parents had these two, since what the stones allow'd, they'l not allow, Reproouing that in theirs, themselues affected, soiling their youth with what their youth respected Are these the fruits and honours of our time, the fruitlesse blossomes of a sterile clyme? Are these our louing Sires? oh no, they are hard, to presse downe loue, that cannot be debar'd. You high resplendent heauens, whose cherishing heat with seasoned warmth, our spacious borders greet, Temper such parents hearts, as are not won, till both their line and linnage be vndone. Soften their stifned minds, oppress'd with rage, playing sharpe tyrants in declining age. For why should they find fault their children play, since in their prime they playd as much as they. Decrepit age, stilted for want of strength, with brinish teares deplores their sins at length; But thus I conster't: They their age deplore, theyr youth is spent, and they can doe no more. And like an enuious viper, would haue none, to vse their strength, because their strength is gone. But old age ers in this: experienc'd wit swaies their proceedings, youth abandons it. Nor doe they know what hurt poore maides receiue, to pen them vp from that they wish to haue. For though they be immur'd in walles of Brasse, Loue hath her loope-holes by which she will passe, In spite of iealous dotage, and espies some priuy chinke, though wacht by Linceus eies, For loue enclos'd like raging elements of fire and water, though imprisoned, vents, And must eruption haue, it cannot be an heauenly motion should want libertie. Eurydice though shes enforc't to dwell, in Stygian Plutoes court infernall hell, Yet her transmounting passions doe remoue themselues from hell vnto the earth aboue. Poore swaine Dorinda though by Satires kept, in a vast caue, whose watchfull eies nere slept, But with reflexion both by night and day, had speciall care lest she should get awaie, Comforts her selfe in louing, fearing not, but chast desires ore long would get her out, Loue is enfranchisd not in bonds retained, spotlesse as Christall, for no soile can staine it. The boistrous windes shut vp in iron grates, on each occasion and intendment waites, When they come forth their tempests hurrie more grieu'd at their durance, then they did before. That morn which s?ds her glittering raies too soone, sables her sunne in cloudes ere it be noone. But when its long ere that her beames appeare, we doe presage ere night they'le shine more cleere. Thetis exiled from her marine seate, a willing exile with the Sea-nimphs meetes, To celebrate Achilles funeralls, in sable robes, in dismall festiuals. Each wept whole flouds of teares to wash his hearse, whereon engrauen was a doleful verse; That no hard hearted passenger came by, but seeing it, would sheede teares instantly: Some made relation of his valiant spirit, some of the glory which his acts did merit: And wofull Brusis one amongst the rest, being his captiue, whom she loued best, Emburied him with liquid streames of sorrow, renewing griefe with each renewing morrow. So did these louers, louers too sincere, rise ere the morning daystar could appeare, Bewayling much their parents frowardnesse, that kept them from the support of happinesse. Happie, if happy in enioying loue, to see the Turtle billing with the Doue, The skipping Kid, the Goate, the pensiue Hinde, consorting each with other in their kinde: Yet these two louers are debard from this; what brute beasts haue, they haue not but in wish: And wishes yield small comfort, poore releefe to such as are prest downe with heapes of griefe. O that heauens splendor, her translucent eie should see, and seeing, pittie miserie, Yet suffer man to be oppres'd therewith, Making him die a neuer dying death. Or why should man endu'd with reasons light, In his owne bowels harbour such a fight, As may subuert the pallace of the soule, ecclipsing it, making her bewty foule; Conuerting that by her depraued will, as first seem'd good to some apparant ill; Not gathering hony from each bitter flower of discontent, nor reaping sweet of sower, But in distractions passionate we run, in headlong course till that we be vndone: And then despairing, we reside in woe shut vp in shelfes: we know not where to goe, The sillie Bee that labours in her hiue, in her Hyblæan works addres'd to striue, With nature in proportion: seemes to make, more for her selfe then nature for her sake, In her digesting and disposing fit, what she had gathered by her natiue wit, She rests secure of loue, worse hap haue we, opprest with loue-sick passions then hath she But heauens haue so decreed; this is our lotte Creatures that haue most reason, most should dote. Thus each ore-shadowing eu'ning shadowed hope, ayming at loue, loue was their onely scope: At which they leuelled: But ('las) disdaine soaring aloft, the frute of loue retaines: Lockt from all comfort, shut from sweete repose, she to their parents doth their loue disclose. Telling them how their children made repaire, vnto a chinke which breath'd a cooling aire. Yeelding content enough: and they should see that ere long time Thysbe would frutefull bee. Their parents stamp'd, but Tymon most of all, for hee was rich and feard his daughters fall. Yet well he could haue brook'd her nuptiall bed, if he were rich that should his daughter wed. Fie on such Gould-adoring parentage, that rests respectlesse both of youth and age, Who measure loue by wealth are sure to haue, Midas his eares, depriu'd of what they craue, They wrest their childrens minds to make them taste, the sweet of Gold, which works their baine at last. Thus parents are as vipers to their seed, since they their venome in their bosomes feede. Which like to Naptha that being once inflamed, Burnes of it selfe, and cannot be restrained. But loue the more repressd the more confin'd, encreaseth so much more in louers minde. For though their watchfull eies did still looke ore them, Gods pittying their distres did more deplore them. And Ioue himselfe yields soueraigne remedy, to these two louers fraught with misery. And well might Ioue yield comfort to their wounds, since he his passions on like passions grounds. For he (though God) did doate as well as man, transforming Leda to a milke white Swan. Ioue in his aiery throne with piercing eies, these louers griefes from high Olimpus spies, And spying them oppres'd, pres'd downe with louing their humane passions force a diuine mouing. You fruitfull sprigs sprung of a fruitfull tree, I heare your plaints, and I doe pittie yee, That the ioynt tablet of two louing hearts should be deuided into seuerall parts. Hard-hearted Parents, made of Marble sure, Or else they could not such distresse endure, That their owne budding blossoms which did grow, from their vnseasoned bosome should bestow Their oile, their labour in affections straines, yet kept in thraldome by their parents reynes. But I that haue the Regiment aboue, rules Cupids arrows, knows the vse of loue, I that haue poasted down from heauens high sphere, to Danae, Io, and the milke-maides here, And to Latona bewties sacred Queene, yet to this hower, as Ioue I nere was seene, Nor euer knowen, such was our diuine power, transuming shapes of plants and roarie showers, Will pittie your affections and apply, Vnto your wounds are present remedy. For we (as men) do naught of woemen craue, but what they well may giue, and we may haue. If the oreshadowing cloudes whose duskie face, obscures heauens splendor, Sols refulgent grace. If misty vapours, foggy excrements, thickned by mixture of grose elements, If Heauen, earth, Sea, plants, stones, or serpents may yield you content, or can your woes allay, Rely on me; for Ioues high diademe, was first ordained to succour wretched men, And by the flagrant cresset of the Sunne, wele either see your minds vnited one, Or else my power shall contradict her selfe, Making affection vassaile vnto pelfe, VVhich were discordant musique, harsher straines, then ere Pan sung among his countrie swains For its not fit that hand-maids should command vs or subiect powers should in their acts withstand vs. Pelfe (worlds trash) in lowest ranke should sit, loue as a Mistris framd to manage it: For who will contemne the daie, the night adore, set best behinde, and worst part before. Ioue hauing in compassion seene their woes, to Hesperus the euening star he goes, And bids her shew her light, for by her aide, she might yeeld succour to a helplesse maide, Hesperus roused, rous'd before her time in heauens horizon streight began to shine: Ore cannoping heauens beawtie with a clowde, all which by Ioue himselfe was well allowde, Then wandring starrs in different dignity, sent out their lights disparkled orderly. Arctophilax begotten of the beare, and Cassiopeiæ likewise did appeare, The Pleiades, Orion, with the rest, Castor and Pollux, whom Ioue loued best; All these consort and make one constellation, at Ioues command for louers recreation. The heauens be-sprinkled thus with sundry lights, limit the day by bringing on the night, To comfort wearied spirits spent with toyle, whose troubled brains the night-time shuld assoil. For Ioue at first conceiuing mortall seede, amidst his labors some repast to need, Created night those cares to take away, which had beene fostred on the toilesome day. Night wished night, to Louers that desire to be partakers of that heauenly fire, Cupid (blind boy) infuseth in their brest, which once infus'd engendreth their vnrest. But its no matter, leaue vve cannot louing, though bitter fruits redound to our approuing: This gloomy night yeelds comfort to their wo, For Ioue had showen the place, where they should go. To Ninus toomb, a toomb to bury griefe shaded with couert, fit for loues reliefe: These two blest louers, blest in loues appearing, addresse their eye for sight, their eare for hearing. Lest their suspicious Parents should sift out, Their fond intendments which they went about: The Night was very darke, darke nights be best, For such as on the day-time take no rest. Since each disparkling beame which doth appeare, yeelds to a Iealous louer cause of feare. But duskie nights which Louers best approue, giue free accesse of parly vnto loue. Thisbe loue-sicke, for loue had made her sicke, time thus occasioned, findes a pretie tricke To gull her keepers and her Parents too, which who can blame her, all that loue will doe: Deere be our Parents loues, their wils, their blessings by which we prosper: deerer be the kissings Of those we loue sincerely from our heart, for where they be there is our chiefest part. No vnfrequented desert can remoue our hearts from them whom we entirely loue. No distance can disioine vnited mindes, no labyrinth fram'd with Meanders winds: We rest the same or else it cannot be, that our affections ground on constancie. Thisbe with creeping pace pac'd ore the floore, oyling the hinges of the creeking dore, Lest it should shew her meaning to her mother, whose eies she feared more then anie other. For they were too too iealous and would spie, more in her dealing then her fathers eye: For he was bed-rid and could hardly moue his sencelesse ioints and knew not what was loue: Yet this bed full of bones, this sap-lesse wretch had sap within his chest, for he was rich; And more, for which all wisemen-may deride him, he euer lov'd to haue his golde beside him: For on his trash he was so deeply rooted, that he (fond-man could neuer sleepe without it: Thus had he much, yet he desir'd much more his gold, his Idole which he did adore. And though he had no vse for that he got, yet he from raking more surceased not. Which punishment was first inflict'd by Ioue, Rich men should haue no vse of what they loue; But in an in-bred appetite to golde, delight to haue it euery minute tolde: VVhich being done making an endlesse paine, they tell their trash and put it vp againe. Thus did this aged Tymon: and respected, wealth more then youth of girles most affected, For richlesse was the scope he leuel'd at, heele call none sonnes but men of good estate. Worth worthlesse seemes, if worth haue no retire, nor means by which their honour might aspire. For beggar Irus whose estate was poore, made Ithacus to driue him out of dore. And seeing him arraide in beggars list, in furious passion slew him with his fist. Thus men are made respectlesse for their want, and pouerty, though faire, yet whole not taunt? Deeming them most vnfit of honours throne, that haue more wit then fortune of their owne, But he that poiseth worth as worth should be, will not obscure true worth for pouertie; Being the substance and maine difference, twixt sauage beasts and humane excellence. And more is trash inferior to the minde, then pith of trees superior to the rinde: Thysbe escaping, hies her to the place which was appointed: her admired face Cast such a lustre on the plaines belowe, as steepy mountaines couered with snow. In Maiden white appareld: maides should be arraied so to shew their modestie; Such piercing eyes she had, which shon so bright, that they gaue day vnto a gloomy night: So that each Wood-nimph, Faune and Satyre there, rose from their caues perceiuing light appeare. Siluanus god of woods and desert groues, his shaggy head from off his pillow moues; And halfe asleepe seeing his arbour shine and all about him, long before his time He girds his quiuer to him, and drew neere to Ninus toombe, where sun-beames shon most cleere: Where he no sooner came; ay me! too soone to that vnluckie shrine that ominous toombe: But seeing her he cast all sleepe aside, sewing, and suting Thysbe for his bride. Mirror of women, best of Natures art, heare a poore wood-god that hath pledg'd his heart To thee and to thy feature: heauenly queene that would these flowry thickets well beseeme, Sit thee downe here: this is an arbour sweet, where al the wood nymphs vse each euen to meet Making a concord; whose mellifluous sound, would glad the birds and all the desert round: The Nimphs shall make their praiers and renew, each morne their hymnes, that they may pleasure you The Muses nine from Pyerus shall descend, and to our musique their attention lend, Where if there anie discord chance to be, Muses themselues will yeeld a remedie. There Clio, Erato, and Melpomene, Euterpe, Thalia, and Calliope, Terpsychore, Vrania, and that sweet tong'd Poly-himnia singing at thy feet All these shall grace thee in this rurall plaine, if thou canst brooke to loue a Countrie swaine: Yet am I borne more high then mortall men. deriu'd from gods euen of immortall stem, Sprung my beginning, therfore scorne not me, since if thou match thou match's with deitie. The flowery shrubbs thou seest doe I command, nay euen the Cedar which so high doth stand, Rests at my power: there is no branch doth grow, whose moisture doth not from Syluanus flow. The sweetest spices of Arabia, the preciou'st perfumes breth in Lidia, Smell by my meanes: for my celestiall power, can make each stinking weede a fragrant flower. Then deare affect me, for no perfume's good if I want thee that perfumes euery Wood. Thysbees replie. If you (quoth Thysbee) as you doe professe, deriue your birth from gods then shew no lesse: For its not fit that gods with starres araid, and heauens immortall sphæres, should loue a maid, A Countrie lasse best fits a Countrie swaine, his oaten pipe best suites with her harsh straine. Those gods that in Olympus regiment, sit and beare rule skorne baser elements. Then if you be diuine, as sure you be, surcease your suite which yeelds indignity, To that high of-spring whence you did proceed, staine not your loue with any mortall seed. Doth mine high linage (quoth Syluanus) shew, that I am too diuine to match with you; Thou art sure born of that ambrosian aire, which is infus'd in me: thou art too faire To be of mortall race, oh do not then debase that faire so much to mach with men: Yet if thou wilt not match but with a swaine, Ile be no god that I thy loue may gaine. A shepheards habite I wil take vpon me, if in that habite I may liue with thee. For credit me (heauens saint) if thou partake of man, all men ile honour for thy sake: Then loue Siluanus, doe not blush be free, loue god or swaine, Syluanus both will be. Thisbees reply. It ill becomes, quoth she, your peerelesse state, with silly maides to be importunate: You should protect our weaknesse and defend our brittle sexe, and euer be a friend To womans weake proceedings, ceasing still to drawe deuoted Virgins to your will: We that are consecrate to Vesras shrine, must in no lasciuious meetings spend no time. If thou (quoth he) to Vesta dedicate thy vowes, thy hests: what mak'st the here so late? For well I know dame Vesta cannot bide her maides should walke alone in euening tide. And those that meane to satisfie her will., must both be chast and feare suspicions ill. Thysbe stood mute, she knew not what to say, without reply she went a prety way And could not answer, for her tripping tongue and modest silence told she spoke awrong. For she nere Vesta lou'd nor Vestas order, but this was best excuse the time afford'd her. Churlish Syluanus (for he was a churle) so to importune a poore Countrie girle, Halfe mad with anger that she would not yeeld vnto his suite: takes in his hand his shield, And raging sternely, sweares he meanes to goe, where he will plunge her in a depth of woe. Are you so coy (quoth he) that youle denie, to ioine with gods immortall deitie? Wele learn young girles manners if we liue, and make them rew, that they our power should grieue With this he went fast trotting vp the hill, pursuing hot the proiect of his will. Intending to command some sauage beast, vpon her, whom he lou'd, he lik'd to feast. And reaching neere vnto the hill aboue, he wagg'd his hand, and ask'd if she would loue? But she denied him loue: doe you denie me? fond? quoth Syluanus, sauages shall trie thee, And thy affection: which no sooner said, then he sent out a Lion to this Maide. A Lion new returnde from rauening pray, came to the fount, his blood to wash away. Where with a shaking pace he seem'd to come towards the place appointed Ninus tombe. But Luna pitting poore Thysbes case, sends out her light, to tell her who it was That now approach'd her, whom no sooner spide, then in a Caue, poore Thysbe did her hide. But out alasse for feare, she ran so fast, that she forgot her tire through too much hast: For she all breathlesse, and quite out of winde, running so fast did leaue her tire behind. And as one carelesse of her weale or woe, distressed thus, she knew not were to goe, Carelesse of what she left or what she had, not knowing what was good, from what was bad. Yet nature grafts in all a natiue feare, by which th' euent of all things doe appeare, As we conceaue yeeld daunger to our state, and feare by time, lest we should feare too late. Thus she pent vp within a desart caue, with sobs &amp; sighes, expresse what she would haue, For in that Caue she wish'd her loue were there, For loues embraces would exempt her feare. Oft did she thinke the Lion staid without, and therefore trembling Thysbe made a doubt, To take the open ayre, but pent within, wish'd in her heart, she had caractred him, Whom she admires and loues, whose sweet respect, makes her to haue her parents in neglect. But he too slow, aye me, too slow in doing, being so forward in his formall woing: Staies too too long being more warely kept, by such sharpe keepers, that all night nere slept: But as one grasing Hart the rest doth keepe, by watchfull eyes warning the rest that sleepe; So euer one was waking, that might call vpon the rest if any thing befall: The Lion hauing quencht his scorching thirst, with springing water which he long'd for first: Found Thysbes tyre, and with his bloody pray, besmeard the same, which done, he went away. Now in the end Pyramus tooke a time, a time too late to answere loue diuine: Yet in this silent course of nighterne race, with quick recourse he runs vnto the place. So that to see him frolick ore the plaine, were worth more prise then Hipodamias gaine, For golden apples drew her tempting eie, But this young youth affects no vanity But the true touch of loue: vaine, if abused; but precious as pure gold, if rightly vsed. Then who wil blame vs, labours to endure, if we by labours can our loue make sure? For constant loue no trauaile will eschew, that constant loue by trauaile may renew. Alcides he can serue the Lidian queene, in spinning, carding, which doe ill beseeme So stout a mirrors magnanimity, but he must doe it, theres no remedy. For when his manly nature did withstand it, one glance of her could wel enough command it. No spacious coufines nor indurate labour, if these ore-past, could purchase ere her fauour, Would he refuse: one smile reward enough, for all the labours he had passed through. Thysbe the trophie of his breathing course, Thysbe the garland which doth him enforce. Her he respects, and whiles he runs apace, he meditates of Thysbes beuteous face; Her comely feature made for Adons shrine, whose Iuory orbs like Pelops shoulders shine. Had made that deep impression in his heart, that Nature seem'd to striue with Natures Art. Nature had giuen her much, Art much the more, Art decking that which Nature dres'd before. For that same creature cannot perfect be, where Art and nature ioyne not mutuallie. If you would haue the module of true wit, Nature creates, but Art must polish it. Thysbe was perfect both in Natures hew, and artificiall colours, which did shew, As if both Art and Nature should contend, to make her such an one no skill could mend; For she was witty, pregnant, full of fauour, Dictinna like, sent out a fragrant sauour, That when she walkt' in Babilons faire streete, she made the kennel with her perfumes sweet. Pyramus comming, comming all too late, to Ninus tombe expects his bewteous mate, Whom when he could not finde, he fear'd her end. Feare is an adiunct to a faithfull friend. Roundly he goes vnto the siluer spring, where all the water-nimphs were wont to sing, In honour of their Goddesse and her bewty, to whom they offred hymnes as was their duty. He ask'd the Nimphes if they his Thysbe knew, describing her, and eke her matchlesse hew: And if they did, he praid them seeke about their Nectar springs with him to finde her out, For if you be immortall, as yon seeme, and dedicate your seruice to your Queen, A beter seruice sure you cannot doe her, then to redresse them owe their seruice to her. This if you will in your compassion doe, I sweate each morne Ile offer thime to you. Better then any Hyble, can affoord, with musick sweete to which the heauens accord, And euer rest deuoted to your shrine, in that you dayn'd to glad this heart of mine. The water-nimphs replide with curtuous cheere, they knew none such, nor any did apeare, But if it pleasd him, they their springs would seeke, exquire each bushie shade, each priuate creeke, To see if she were in their mansions hid, which he assented to; all which they did: But when with watrie tripping they had sought both brake and brier; yet could not finde her out, Wearied with their diurnall labour, left Pyramus sighing, of all ioy bereft; Yet did these nimphes bemone his hard mishap, for sitting downe vnder Nereus lap, They turnd their Warbling strings to that sad straine, that all the woods re-eccoed them againe. Each in their order sung their dolefull verse, as if it had been ouer Thysbes hearse, And tun'd their odes with that vnseasoned time, as that brute beasts to pittie did incline, For they in sable colours did portend, that their two loues were neere a tragick end. Thus shadie night, Sea-nimphs, stars, plan'ts &amp; all presage to them and to their loues a fall. Yet Pyramus though sad, for he was sad to haue those hopes extinguisht, which he had, Seeks still about the tombe: sad tombe (quoth hee) that hides my loue, so much admir'd of me: Yet if thou wilt but tell me where she is, I vow by Heauens Ile pardon whats amisse, Yea I'le remit thine error and thy wrong, for keeping her within thy chest so long, Say, wilt thou tell me what became of her? Didst thou her bewty in thy shrine inter? Didst thou immure her in thy marble toombe? what makes thee silent? bewty makes thee dumb: Wilt thou so wrong a louer to conceale, From him the mirrour of his ioy his, weale, His heart, his liking euen the flower of youth? and yet conceiues within thy heart no ruth. Fie, fie for shame: ist fit that monuments should so ecclipse natures best ornaments? As to obscure the glory of her face, that where she is giues honor to the place. Thou much abstracts from trophies Ninus won, in doing that which he would nere haue done. Thou lessens much the honour he obtained, loosing that fame which Ninus conquests gained. For what great gaine or conquest i'st t'haue said, I haue possession of a countrey maide. A young vnnurtur'd girle fit for men, vnfit for liuelesse tombes which couer them? This said this doting young man, blind with louing, thinking ould mouldy shrines had liuely mouing. Mou'd with her loue, whom he did more esteeme, then any gem that ere on earth was seene. But when he saw into his error well, He seem'd those loue-sick passions to dispell, And to repaire vnto his search againe, seeking each couert, each vnhaunted plaine, Each thick-set hill, each groue that he might finde, the diapason of his troubled minde. At last too soone, by seeking long he found, (Thysbe) not Thysbe, but her tire on ground. Vnhallowed ground, vnseasoned her attire, to crosse the passions of an hot desire. Oh now conceiue what sorrows gall his brest, to see the tire of her he loued best, Be-smeard with bloud, for it all bloudy shews, her sanguine colour tinctt with Lyons iawes: Oft would hee looke vpon it, and would kisse, the tire besmear'd with blood, wishing it his, His fate, his fortune, to remaine with her, since his long absence thus had iniur'd her. How to remaine (quoth he) since she is dead, oppress'd by death, inclos'd in mourneful weede? How should I liue with her whose life is gone, and hath left me (vnhappy me) alone. Die, die, with her, with whom thou canst not liue, For thou by dying shalt thy life repriue. And haue her presence that enthroned is, in perfect ioies of heauens Elisian blisse. Yet stay awhile, this is not Thysbes tire, stay there (fond wretch) against thy tongue a lyer. This was her roabe, this was her comely weede, which hauing lost her owner gins to bleede. Oh Ioue what cause hadst thou thus to remoue two, that had their intentions voud to loue, Or why should thou this faire occasion show vs, which being showne, dost seeke for to vndoe vs? Be gods so iron-hearted, to require constant affection with a dismall spite? A sharpe reuenge it is, to set vs on, and then to leaue vs when we are begun. Did not high Ioue yeeld vs more hopes then these, when he commanded Phœbus to sure ease, For to disfuse his beames, bidding him go, retire in hast vnto the shades below. Calling for Luna to supply his place, shrowding heauens lustre with her clowdy face. That our escape suspected lesse might be, by the darke vaile of nights obscurity. But heauens I see, repine at our successe, since Gods themselues by Fates haue shew'd no lesse, To plunge my weale in woe, my loue in teares, producing nought, but sighes, and fruitlesse feares. Thou harsh tun'd Nemesis, thou tragicke ghost, against whose acts my loue declaimeth most: What cause hadst thou to sing this dolefull song, vpon her herse that neuer did thee wrong? She neuer raild against thy Soueraigne power, but like an harmelesse doue, a fragrant flower; Flourish'd secure at home, yeelding content, by gracefull smiles, a maids best ornament: She neuer curb'd thy rage, nor did she mell with ought but loue, which made worst for her sell. But Fates haue made the instrument of sinne, respectlesse of our losse, so they may win. The pretious spoyle of Thysbes bleeding soule, whose sad mishap the plants themselues condole. Yet thou remorselesse art, ill may betide thee, that wold haue none to loue that liue beside thee. Yet for all this thou canst not me depriue, of louing her, whose life did mee reuiue, For being dead, Ile rather chuse to die, then liuing, lose her loving company. This said: he takes her tyre, and kissing it, vpon the fountaine banks did water it, With dewie moisture of still-flowing teares, which being shed, renuing drops appeares. Teares liquefied the arbour where he sate, which water nimphs perceiuing, wondred at. Oft would he beat his brest, and teare his haire, shutting his hopes in clouds of deepe despaire. Oft would he curse the day, the houre, the night, that banisht him from Thisbes gladsome sight. Wishing that night had neuer beene descride, for nere did night more harsh euents betide. Oh Pyramus, and then he sigh'd to speake, for gusts of sorrow made his hart-strings breake. What meant thou to allure a simple maid, to these vvild woods? her loue is well repaid, That she should come vnto the place assignd, and thou (base coward) come so farre behind. Thou with a tardy pace came at thy leasure, such slow-pac'd coursers ill deserue such pleasure, Thou too precise, made bones of what thou did, such fond precisenes seldome hath good speed. Shee to enioy her ioy, cut off delay, that she her minds perfection might display, And with a course as quicke as Pegasus, run ore these plaines to meet with Pyramus, Which thou requited ill, basest of men, which time shall character with scandalls pen. A scandall to thy sexe, and to thy state, to leaue thy loue in deserts desolate. Oh what mishap had she to loue a swaine, that could not yeeld her loue for loue againe? Hard was her fortune to affect that creature, who for a childish feare delaid to meet her. The gods I know more forward would haue beene, to meet loues Parragon, so faire a Queene. As for her beauty, aye me, beauties faire, with Ericina she might well compare; And farre more modest: Venus had her mole, but nere was Thysbe stain'd with bewties soile. But thou hast stain'd her beauty by thy fault, ruin'd that sort, which neuer had assault, But by thy selfe, and by thy selfe too soone, since by thy meanes her shrine is razed downe. Turne thee to heauen, and loe the heauens dismaid, to see the tragicke downefall of a maide: Frowning at thee that was the cause of this, causing her end that was thy Soueraigne blisse. Turne thee to earth, and see her turn'd to earth, which makes the caues below resound with mirth That they enioy which thou didst once enioy, reaping their comfort from thy deepe annoy. Turne thee vnto the Sea, and thou shalt see, The Nymphes and Syrens crying out 'gainst thee. That should make promise, yet not promise hold, calling thee coward, but thy Thysbe bold. Bold, to aduenture on the gloomy night, bold to encounter with Latonas light. Bold in her course, swift in her cursiue mouing, bold to escape, and constant in her louing: Thus heauen, earth, Sea, concording all in one, do simpathize with thy discording mone. And wilt thou liue for this? O doe not liue, but to requite her loue, let earth receiue This little All of thine: which when they haue, they may interre two louers in one graue. Adioyning to this fount, a rocke there was, so steepe and craggy, that no man could passe. To which wild beasts repair'd, making their den in th' hollow cauernes which did couer them. Which seene by him: what doe not louers see? with face deiected, thus discoursed he. If any Lion or fierce sauage Beare, lodge in this ragged rocke, or coucheth neere, Let him come out, for heere is amorous food, and cooling streames to wash away our blood, That this may beare record by euery wight, two faithfull louers perisht on one night. But these are but delaies which cowards vse, their trembling passions seeking to excuse, Cast off vaine feare, feare is a vassalls weede, and place true Resolution in her steed. This said with praiers vnto his houshold Gods. Offring to Venus altar, myrtle rods, Which grew hard by that spring where he did fit, with other ceremonialle which befit A louers last farewell: he wisht his friends for their too hard restraint to make this mends, And to erect his shrine by Ninus tombe, as witnes of his loue in time to come. Which said: with hand resolu'd, resolu'd to dye, with sword vnsheath'd, he ends his misery. Thus hauing ended, ended ere begun, for thus the thred of his short life was spun. The sad euents and obsequies ensue, which thus in briefe my Muse relates to you. Thysbe, poore Thysbe, trembling all this while, shut vp within her caue: began to smile, And with a cheerefull countenance cast off feare, for in that coast, no ill she saw appeare. And much delighted with her speedy course, vnto the springs, sad springs, shee made recourse. She tuck'd her cloaths vp, for the euening dew, had wash'd the herbs that in the forrest grew; And tucking vp as Country maids doe vse, the high bet path to Ninus tombe to chuse; Where she (vnhappy she) no sooner came, then like Narcissus eccho, sounds his name, VVhom she affects, admires, whose onely face, drew her (poore wench) vnto that dismall place. Come, come, quoth she, thou knowst not how to wo Come to thy Thysbe she vvill tell thee hovv. She wil prescribe the rules, with fruits of woing, for fruitlesse be those fruits that haue no doing. We that doe hazard our good names for men, if they'l not pleasure vs: what profit then, Of all our toylsome labour we sustaine, that reape no haruest from such gusts of pain? We patient are to beare, and what we bore, we doe accept, and wish it ten times more, That we might pleasure you: how fond are we? The weaker sort beares your infirmity. But its our Nature Nature hath ordain'd, mans strength by womans weaknesse is sustain'd. In this same cloudy night, with what desire, did all my thoughts, and my intents aspire? To that same treasure thou hast promis'd me, promise is debt, it must be kept by thee, With what affection haue I cross'd these plaines, cheered by wood-nimphs, singing plesant strains, And dans'd Laualto till I came to thee, longing for that which thou didst promise mee. Sad Philomela skared from her rest, sung with a pricking slothorne at her brest, And sung of Tereus something, what I know not, which if I knew, yet would I neuer show it. For Tereus impious in his prophane life, to wrong a sister, and so chast a wife. Sustains the torture of his wickednesse, transform'd into a Bird: whose filthinesse, Loues marish places, flies the solid ground, good reason why: his conscience was not sound. For Tireus was a King and for his lust, by Ioue himselfe, was from his scepter thrust. A sensuall Prince to wanton motions stirr'd, chang'd from a prince, vnto a loathsome bird, Thus did I passe the silence of the night, till I arriu'd within my louers sight, Which yet I cannot doe: oh why should we, to get a little sport, paune modesty? These shady thickets, and that secret caue. those pratling Sea-nimphes, &amp; this marble graue, Beare all record what trauell I haue taken, yet like a Turtle of her make forsaken, Cannot enioy my loue, aye me, vnkind, that seemes inconstant, to a constant mind. VVhy should our fauors so deuoted rest, to them, whose hardned harts bred our vnrest? And make vs subiect to more inward griefe, then ere their comforts can affoord releefe. But thou art too too rash: (beleeue me sweet,) in more remisse Appearance doe I greete, Thy diuine beauty; pardon what is said, conceyue no harme spoke by a harmelesse maide; For if thou should (as sure I thinke thou dost,) lie hid vnder some bush, and hearst this nois'd, This shrowd inuention, gainst thy loue and thee, thou might as well condemne my speech and me. VVhy should I speake against so hallowed shrine, to whom I haue bequeath'd both me and mine? Or why should I detract from that faire sunne, vvhich (if ecclips'd) my glistring raies bee done? Then enuious thou, to daze that glorious bright, whose first arising gaue thy setting light. Rouse vp thy selfe for shame, and honour him, whom if I get, heauens treasure I doe winne. More prise and richer then those sisters three, which kept the apples of faire. Hespery. This was no sooner said, then seriously, ech Bush, ech place, she sought that bordered nie, Doing as children vse, that seeke about, their hid companions, till they find them out. Hard by this tombe, a Mulbery there was, encircled round with tufts of greenest grasse: Which tree look'd once as white as white could be, but now was chang'd, like to the Eben tree. Whose blooms were black as iear, and which was more it lost the forme which it retain'd before. Vnder these shady spraies, lay Pyramus, depriu'd of sence, a scene too ominous. Which when poore Thysbe, iudge what tis to see a constant loue in such perplexity? For sure I am, such heapes of passions cloid her, that in his death a double death annoid her. Long time she brethlesse stood aboue her loue, depriu'd of sences, for they could not moue, And as one liuing in a lethargy, hath not the vse of sences faculty; But sleeping seemes secure of any ill, so in this sencelesse mouing, stood she still: At last awaked with watry drops downe-falling, of her loues name, she fell to instant calling. Calling him by his name: awake, arise, with that he heaued vp his heauy eies. Thysbe (saith she) calls on thee, fie awake, leaue off thy sencelesse dulnesse for her sake. Thysbe no sooner spake, but at her name, he op'd his eies, and shut them vp againe. Such was the force of Thysbe, that being dead, by loues reflexe, he mou'd his louely head. And when he lay him downe, as laid before, yet his two staring eies, still glimmering more Were prest vpon his loue, as if his heart, was giuen her by his eyes at lifes depart. For they still gaz'd vpon her, as if he had seen the heauen where he wisht to be. Thrice did he moue his head, yet all in vaine, for wanting strength, it bended backe againe. Thrice did he kisse the ground, thrice kisse the ayre, Supposing that his Thysbe had beene there. And when he could not find her, hee vnrips, his loue effects, and smackers with his lips. Thysbe conceiuing what he meant, admired, his feruent loue, and to a shade retired. Hard by this Tombe where with all blubbered face, she made this sad narration to the place. Haplesse and hopelesse is mine ending friend, cruell the Fates that should such torments send, Vnto a faithfull Louer: heauens haue done, that which the plants within this forrest shun. They lose their forme, their feature and their shape, and what they doe, they doe it for his sake. For this same Tree, beares record of our wracke, decolored quite from white, to dismall black, And this same ground, all in a gore of bloud: No chirping bird within this fatall wood, And this for loue of him, that now is gone, leauing his forlorne Thysbe all alone. Hard was mine hap, to see his dolefull end, at whose sad hearse the Fates themselues attend: Hard was mine hap, more harsh the course of time, to crop my loue, my dazie in his prime. Hard was his hap to extinguish his desire, with apparition of a bloody tire: Hard was his hap to forrage heere so late, to misse his loue, and meete so soone with Fate. Turne to thy loue, see if thy vitall breath, can call him from the slumber of pale death. See if thou canst reuiue his gasping soule, for loe his eies within his head doe rowle. Embrace his iuory necke with foulded armes, destill life in him by thy louing charmes. Buzze in his eares of loue, it will not bee, his dying sences haue no mind of thee. Thus round empalld with greefe, was Thysbes mind, no hope of life in him can Thysbe find, For he grew stiffe engor'd with bloudy wound, and by his bloud fast glued to the ground. Thysbe espied her Tire which hee did hould, fast in his hand, and did the same enfould, As if it were some Antidote to cure his gaping wound and make him ere endure: Vnhappy Tire (quoth she) vnhappy were, that gaue occasion to my loue of feare. Thou that hast prest my soule in anguish more, then all the robes which ere I wore before. Thou wandring stragler, sliding from mine head, gaue the first onset to this vgly deede. For if thou hadst not been, my loue had liu'd, that now of sence &amp; mouing is depriu'd. What hap had I at first to put thee on, when darke Latonas lights were drawing on, Or what misfortune had I for to leaue thee, since thy departure doth so greatly grieue mee. It needes must grieue me: for it cuts my heart, as if my soule from body should depart. He was my soule, my body cannot breath, When as my soule is seised on by death. Why should I haue such curious regard to Nightern robes, wh? meaner would haue serud? For well I know it was my loues desire, to meete my selfe and not my curious tire. Fie on this nice precisenesse weomen vse in garish dressings: men should weomen chuse, Not by their bodies habit, but their minde, in lists of vertue, and respect confinde. We that doe loue as we protest we doe, must not get husbands with a painted show, Like puppets in a play, addres'd to play strange acts by night, to purchase loue by day. Best honour that beseems a countrey maide, is to be modest, in her actions staid. For this (beleeue me) modest lookes doe win more hearty loue, then baits of tempting sin. And yet we cannot leaue lasciuious straines, so draw young men to our immodest traines. But if young girles would be rul'd by me, They'l make their preciou'st iewel modestie. Thysbe with this beheld the bloody blade which lay all moistned vnder that same shade Where her true louer lay, and seeing it, with many a balefull ban she cursed it, Calling it cruell: Cruell sword (quoth she) that in this sort did part my loue and me, What made thee so remorselesse, so hard-hearted, to see two constant louers so soone parted; Parted by thee, fie on thee for the deede, thou murdered him, and makes my soule to bleede, Bleede in despaire of seeing him againe, who gaue a cordiall to my toilsom paine. He was the Saint that liuing I adored, this is his Trunke these marrie eies deplored. Yet ioyne with me to honour his sad hearse, let plaints and teares thine hardned temper pierce, Pierce thine owne bosome, Bosom if thou haue, that brought my loue so timelesse to his graue. And thou vnhallowed Tombe that couers him, who first enlargd this Empire, and did win, Trophies of honour, which remaine to thee; in times succession to posteritie. Open thy marble bosome and receiue, two friends at once in one renowmed graue, Thou hides the honour of a worthy King, that liuing did great conquests hither bring, Send him abroade out of thy shrine, with speed, and take vs two to thee in Ninus steed: But thou wilt answers thou should wrong him then, to place our reliques mongst such prince-like men; Which is not so: For rest assur'd that we purchase more fame then euer purchas'd he. He conquered Realmes by fates auspicious: But thou may trust me, more is got by vs: For we haue conquerd Loue, which he could neuer, which in our praise shall be recorded euer. What if his name be spread in euery place, this sounds not much vnto his reliques grace, Thou couers but his ashes turnd to dust, we turne to earth, and so all Princes must. If that thy Monument were so diuine, as the huge gulfe of mountaine Inarime. That doth possesse Typhæus Gyant fieres, and shrouds him liuing in her hollow bieres. Where he with rest of his aspiring rout, at end of each seauen yeers doe turne about. Yet pressed downe with hills that lie aboue them, for all their strength they hardly can remoue them. Then wort thou famous (for gard might betide thee) to haue such liuing wonders sleepe beside thee. But now thou art not so: for what is he, that he can challenge more of death then we? He might whilst he suruiu'd and bore the sway, his purple flags in euery coast display. He might command, and haue what he commanded, but death, pale death now swaies, &amp; she'l withstand it. Then honourd hearse, if hearses honour haue, yeeld to my sute, and perfect what I craue. Doe not denie me: to deny me this, were to depriue thee honour me of blisse. Nay doe not smile, (for I doe see thee smile) if that our bones thou in thy brest compile, And recollect them after Thysbes death, the Nimphes themselues shall set a laurell wreath Upon thy back: e'r honourd shalt thou be, for this good turne thou did my loue and me. But if thou scorne my vows, and cal them vaine, yeelding no eare to louers that complaine, Rest Well assured the Nimphs reueng'd will be. And for our sakes will quite demolish thee. When trusty Aiax &amp; Achilles came, to Patrocles tombe, with teares they bath'd the same For euery word they spake of Patrocles, drew teares from them, as streames from Caucasus. Whose ragged top sends riuers out amaine, and being sent, renews her springs againe. So they deplor'd his death, his sacred hearse, ranck set with embleames and with dolefull verse. The swanes of Caister and eke of Poe, came to ensable him in songs of woe: Since which sad time the Poets haue reported, that each daie twice the swannes haue there resorted. Passing by flockes along the Greequish plaine, seeking by songs to make him liue againe. But when it would not be, the Swans there swore, that from that time they nere would warble more; But at their death which they performe: for why they neuer sing but hower before they die. Why should a Grecian haue such honour done, that neuer any Trophies ere had wonne, But slaine by Hector: for no fame he had of doing greatly good, or greatly bad. And yet forsooth he must characters haue. in golden letters ore his worthlesse graue, In polisht marble must his shrine be set in saphires, tophies and in british ieate. Thus must he haue respect, when we, god wot, must lie obscure as if men knew vs not. And yet our fame deserues more praise then he, more grace, more glorie, and more memorie: Time shall race out that marble hearse of his, time shall amend what time hath done amisse. For we shall liue in spite of Fates decree, when lowe interr'd this famous Greeke shall be. Loue cannot die, we loued and therefore death shall crowne our hearse with times immortal wreath, And though we die we loue and liue in dying, loue to pale death perpetuall life applying. Why should prince Ilus acts haue such respect whose toomb with precious emeralds bedeckt? For well I know such acts did neuer he, In amorous passions of true loue as we, Yet Batias toomb must haue inscriptions faire, to shew what man of birth was buried there. A crowne vpon his head, and in his hand, a royall scepter which did Troy command, These must exalt his glory and make roome, for Fames resounding trumpe in time to come, And as that hearse doth memorize his name, so after times by it might doe the same. O thou iniurious time, that time obserues, yeelding not honour as our deeds deserues, Dost partialise and modest bounds surpasse, bestowing honour on each worth-lesse Asse: Ilus a stranger was vnto thy soyle. an vp-start Prince, who for a little toyle To win a crowne, was thus aduauns't by thee, from Beggers ragges to Princes dignitie. Looke at his low beginning whence he came, what wore his coper-mates his deiected name, Looke at his pompe, how ill he could beseeme, the stile of King, or she the name of Queene. And then exile his glory from thy coast, thy great'st disgrace of whom thou gloriest most: Receiue our ashes, ashes of true loue, keepe them as hallowed in thy sacred Groue, Receiue our ashes and abandon his, that liuing, kissing, dying we may kisse. For what great grace wilt be in time to come, vnto thy soile, to say, thou keep'st the toomb Of two true-louers, mirrors of affection, louing so long till loue came to perfection. Perfect in loue, so perfect in our loue that nought, (sans death) could our affections moue And yet in death we languish not in louing, though death depriue vs of all vitall morning For we conceiue more ioy intoomb'd together, then if we liu'd depriu'd the one of other. More must I say to seale these obsequies; for death is fearefull and inuents delaies, And most of all in vs: a weaker brood, the talke of death yeeldes feare to woman-hood. And yet, me thinkes I stay from him too long, and in my stay I doe him double wrong. First to depriue him life, and then begin with tardie pase aloofe to follow him. Well Ile prepare my selfe, the Fates decree two Louers should sustaine their crueltie. And yet not cruell, cruelty is showne when either is debarred of his owne. But we by Cupids meanes, that pur blind boy. obtaine by death we could not earst enioy. Death yeelds more comfort then our life time did. shewing our loue which long before was hid. No priuate crauie nor no secret chinke need we finde out, nor fearefull need we shrinke. For Parents hot pursuite we rest secure, since heauen our hearts, as earth our corps immure. Wee need not haue our Parents in suspect, they may rest carelesse now whom we affect: For well I know we can be hardly seene, twixt heauen and earth, so great a space between. Thus loue an heauenly motion doth ascend, from earth to heauen to gratulate her friend, Thysbees EPICÆDIVM. Yet Thysbe stay thine hand: thine obsequies, desire more celebrating exequies; Die not intestate, in this desert groue, but consecrate in token of thy loue Thine hests to Vesta yet let Uesta know, Thysbe vnwilling is enforced so. Then let thy Parents, Parents though vnkinde By Natures lawe, some short memorials finde, Of thy affection: Swannes before they die, leue pensiue odes and warble merrily. Yet must I needs declaime against your feare, iealous of hurt where no hurt could appeare: For I am sure nere was your thriuing blissing, more deere to me then was my louers kissing. Oh then vnkind vnkindnesse did not fit, our chaste desires that could not bridle it. Loue was the hott'st when it did seeme conceal'd, and hid in ashes, yet in time reueal'd. Then blame your selues, not vs: you caus'd our end, barring a louer from her long fought friend, Which we doe pardon if youle let vs haue, our toomb in one, our ashes in one graue. Which if you shall performe our hope extends, our disioin'd corps conioin'd you make amends. Well do I know our funerals renew, currents of teres and streames of griefe in you. And many pagent mixd with liquid teares, will make attendance on our desolate beres, Many distreaming drops will dim your eie, to see two louers end so suddenly. Yet all in vaine, being dead, your teares restraine: for teeres cannot recall vs back againe. The Nimphes themselues with Poplar twigs will make an osier basket for Idalias sake, Wherein collect you may such fragrant flowers, as shall adorne our monumentall bowers: Yet when you spreade your flowers ech in degree, Strow more on his side then you strow on me. He was more constant, he did first begin, I like his shadow did but follow him. He came vnto the place, and spite of death seeing my tire engor'd did lose his breath. I like an Ape, to imitate my loue, follows his worth, his presence to approue. A glorious presence where the gods accord all wealth, all ioy, Elizium can affoord. Fruitfull Elysis where ech constant mate, raignes in fruition of his happie state, VVhere Hero smiles to grapple with her deere, Iealous of nothing, for no cause of feare Can crosse loues action? theres no Helespont, But the sweet relish of a Nectar fount Hight the Castalian fount which Gods adore, where hauing drunke thei're neuer thirsty more. By this renowmed brooke, shall he and I, prattle of loue, and parents cruelty. Yet so wele prattle that we may receaue, loues haruest purchas'd by our ircksum graue. A happy Graue, that is a spicie vrne, where louers vse to smile, surcease to mourne, For by their dying they doe more obtaine, then euer here enthral'd they thought to gaine, And can that death be cald a death? O no; for by that death from death to life we goe. Reaping the blossomes of experienc'd good, which while we Pilgrims were, we neuer could. Then doe not weepe deere friends; for we enioy, the hauen of our hopes, where no annoy Can make disturbance, but empal'd by Ioue, we get renoume for our surpassing loue. Let no sad Odes our burials solemnise, nor let no teares com trickling from your eies, The solemne fire which euer old hath been, our buried reliques will full well be seem: Yet when you burne our ashes, you should see, His ashes haue the vpper hand of me: For Cupid with his mother Queene of loue, Pres'd downe the female, set the male aboue. Then for an order (since the Gods ordaine it) It were presumption for you to restraine it. For rest assured if we had mist this chance, we had obaid ere this their ordinance. O let our loues recorded be by you, and when you sing vnto our hearse adew, Euer imprint this caurion in your minde. Be not vnto your childrens loues vnkinde. Hang not the willow token of disdaine vpon our Toome: for that each country swaine Can set vpon his shrine: let Venus tree, the louely mirtle shew our constancie. If you want any rites or solemne hestes, which may beseem our graues: the birds protests Each in their order to solemnise them, and gods themselues for to eternize them: Each mourning Turtle hauing lost her make, will mourning make resort for Venus sake. And sweet Leucothoe will represent of Vmolus odours a delicious sent. The Nighterne owle, that night wil cease from prey howling by night, as she did howle by day. The little Batt (though fearefull heretofore) will flocke amongst the rest and feare no more. Thus euery Bird, for it is Gods desire, will with their presence decke our funerall fire. To purge our guilt dame Venus promis'd me, shele goe to heauen with lowe and bended knee. And well I know Ioue, Uenus loues so well, he will belieue what tale so ere she tell. Then for her loue let Venus altars smoke, and in each corner of her Temple looke; No ornament which best may her be-fit, Be there awanting but to perfect it. You know our Cittie much relies on her: for by her succour no distresse can sturre The prosperous sailes of our prosperitie, but like a sterne she's euer fixed nie, To rid her from those rocks vnto the shore, in liew whereof we do her shrine adore. Yet ere I die I must take leaue of you, you sacred mansions which my woes renew: Thou oliue-tree that planted was so nie vnto my fathers house where I came by This last vnhappie night: thou tender vine, whose supple slips these fingers oft did twine. Thou rosie border set with roses fayre, to which each morne I vsed to repaire, And rob thee of thy store to bewtifie my haplesse tire with crimson puritie, Farewell at once farewell, long may the dew of siluer hair'd Aurora water you, Long may you flourish, this I onely craue, that with your flowres each morne you deck my graue. Such sweetes, such fragrant roses represent, that your repose may make it redolent. Send out your spicy odours and attend, with Hyble fruites vpon my bleeding friend; For manie time and oft hath he and I, chas'd one another full lasciuiously: And if he chaunc't to be too slow in running, I would hold back and linger for his comming. But of all monuments I bid adew, broad shadowing beech-trees to the sight of you: You many times haue yeelded sweet repose vnto our loue and seasoned haue our woes, By your contented shades blest be you euer, and like Elisian-shades fade may you neuer. O many times haue we two sported there, (for we alone were priuiledged there) And twisting nose-gaies we our flowers would hide, lest by some Satyre we should be espide; Oft would we crop sweete flowers and hauing cut them, within our wicker baskets we would put them: And when we more had gathered then we needed, we gathred still for so our loue exceeded, That euery flower we cropt we did apply vnto the flower of our virginitie. “For if such flowers such sweetnesse did bestowe, flowers are much sweeter that do spring belowe. Fare-well thou spacious plaine amongst the rest, I haue no cause but to respect thee best: For manie time and oft haue we two plaide at Barli-breake, but now that sports decai'd, Full many secret corners dost thou yeelde, for Louers sports within thy louely field. And thou vnhappy Pine that mounts so hie, as if thou meant by height to tutch the skie; Thou mai'st repine at fates that murdred me, since Thysbees hand each morne did cherish thee, Oft haue I planted grafts within thy stemme, which now are growne so high they shadowe men And with a Water pot which I did bring each morne by time; I made thine arms to spring: But now, poore Pine, pine maist thou now and die, for none that I know cherish thee but I: Now shall thy shadowing branches fall away, their falling leues to winters fury paie. And none remaines there now to pittie thee, When I am dead that liuing nourisht thee; But be content; shed teres in loue of me, and when thou hear'st my death deiected be: Cast down some withered leues &amp; send them hither, portending thus much, we must die together; This if thou dost I will thee thankfull call, and wil with Laurel thy sad head empall: That though thou die, yet that thou diest with me, in after-times still honoured thou maist be. And thou straite chinke to which full many time we made repaire: through thee our loue did shine, And spearst her beames; farewell, for neuer more, shall we resort to thee as heretofore; Thou wast the author of our first vndoing, for by thy meanes thou gauest vs means of woing, Giuing eyes liberty, which eyes so wounded that by their passions passions new rebounded, Yet we do thank thee for thy fore-past loue, for by our deaths the gods themselues approue Our constant minds, recorded which must be in heauens conuentions to our memorie. O happy thou whilst our two fragrant breaths made thee so rich, impouerisht by our deaths: For this I thinke, this is my prophesie, nere shall such lips bestowe their breath on thee, When thou shalt heare of our discording end, some softned teares vpon our funeralls spend: Let thine hard marble be dissolv' to streames of liquid water, since those radiant beames Which our reflecting eyes the marble gaue might pierce him more, then euer Lyricks haue The sauage beasts, whose natures were made tame, at the rehearsall of sweet Amphions name: What then should Bewtie? whose attractiue power commands stones, serpents &amp; sweet budding flowr: What should the Splendor of faire Beawties eie act, since such acts were done by harmonie? Open your flinty bosome, let remorse shed riuolets of teres vpon my coarse: Or if you will not so, at least restraine your ayrie chinke, and shut it vp againe: Let not such Monuments liue when we die, for they'le augment our Parents iealousie: That as we lov'd, kiss'd toy'd when we're liuing, so we may loue, kisse, toy at lifes depriuing. Then shut that crany vp lest after time, impute the fault vnto that chinke of thine. This last record by Thysbe thus recorded bred floods of teres: for teres their sighs afforded, the Balme-trees wept, their teres concrete in one distilled into th' substance of a stone: Which stone it seemes, did after couer them, for after times found it laid ouer them. With many faire inscription which did shew of loue recorded neuer none more true, Then this of Thysbe and her louing mate, supposing mutuall death a blessed state, A state more blest in that they had their wish, Thysbe had hers and Pyramus had his; They were depriv'd of louing in their liuing, but by their deaths the gods themselues were giuing Tokens of loue, for they enioied their loue, which no transparent iealous eye could moue. Empall'd by diuine power, heauens maiesty, to honour them, that honour'd constancie; And which was more: dame Venus (as we read) yoking her Doues, came to high Ioue with speed, Her milke-white doues with ayrie coloured wings, vnto Ioues throne their beawteous lady brings; Where she with smiling countenance, for her smile, all foggie mists Olympus did exile, Thus spake to Ioue, who seeing her did grace her, and with enfolded arms 'gan to embrace her. Heauen-habiting Ioue, that in compassion sees, louer inflamed passions: on my knees, Doe I entreate as I am Queene of loue for shipwrackt louers: that thou wilt remoue Their earthly members to participate the glorious sunshine of one heauenly state, For they were constant, constancy thou loues and in thy selfe their passions thou approues: Deigne to eternize them with sacred Baise, It's fit such mirrors should haue endlesse daies. That consecrate their vowes to gods diuine, then so propitious to these praiers of mine, They were enobled with a constant minde, Such sacred lights it's hard on earth to finde: They were adorn'd with Vestas puritie: Vestas pure shape deserues eternitie. They liu'd in louing, and in louing did'e, nor did two Vrns their ioyned loue diuide: But both inter'd together, they haue wonne a fame recorded in all times to come. She was as faire as fairenes could be laid on mortall colours, though a country maide, Yet for her thoughts as pure, as was her face, she well deserues to haue an heauenly place. Doe not frown (deare Sire) me thinks that frowne, doe ill beseeme, to such as be your owne. I am your daughter, and I know you loue me; and I presume my praiers needs must moue you, Or else I should despaire e're to resort from Idas mount vnto your heauenly court. Then yeeld assent vnto your daughters suite, if you denie it me, I will be mute, And neuer make recourse vnto your shrine, which cannot choose but gall this heart of mine. This earthly goddesse will full well beseeme, in Iunoes absence to supply as Queene. Ioue smilde at this, for he desired change, and therfore oft from heau? to earth would range For pleasure and delight: variety willing vnwilling, wrested this reply. You speake of wonders (daughter) quoth high Ioue, of mortall wights so constant in their loue. These two in constant louing you surpasse, For they'r more constant then ere Venus was. Death cannot part asunder their desires, which like bright flames vnto our throne aspires, They're worthy (daughter) of a glorious crowne, and they shall haue it: for wele vse our owne. But to enioy that ioy, that amorous die of bewties sweete complexion: how should I Disioyne these two, both would I gladly grace, if I could distance them in seuerall place. That faire form'd creature thou dost so much praise. I doe remember in her former daies: For she entirely wisht she might haue time to vse her loue, and offred to my shrine Great store of incense; incense it was sweete, that I would giue them time and place to meete. Which I did promise: but I did not pay: for seeing her more bewtious then the day, Faire as Orgon, purer then that white louely Alcmena wore vpon the night When she suppos'd Amphitrio her deare loue possest the place which was supplide by Ioue. Being thus faire, (for Thysbe was more faire) I much amazed stood, oppres'd with care, Seeming asleepe, yet sleeping I did moane, my too large promise which was past and gon. Oft did I wish I had been Pyramus, oft I resolu'd (the night so tedious) For to transhape my selfe, and to descend, and meete with Thysbe as her pointed friend. But Iuno iealous Queene, with open eie slept not all night, but fraught with iealousie. Askt me full oft what aild me: turne (quoth she) and with my nectar lips ile comfort thee. Are you in loue? I blush'd: that blush displaies, you are inclind (quoth she) some otherwaies: You haue some tricksie Girle, that doth keepe your heart enchain'd, your powrefull eies from sleepe. Fie fie (quoth she) as you are Ioue, affect her that affoords to you the most respect: I am celestiall wife and sister both vnto your selfe: and Iuno would be loth To violate the glory of her spouse with euery swaine, in eu'ry brothell house: And can you then without regard of me, or of your selfe, disgrace your deitie With euery Leda, euery milke-maide, toie, while Iuno is depriued of her ioye? Now by my God head mortall men adore, I'aue borne so much that I can beare no more. Either content you with your choice, your Queene, or ile tell that which would ful ill beseeme The glory of your state: the Gods shall heare, what heretofore to tell I did forbeare. Then as you tender th' honour of your name, Be charie henceforth how you soile the same. This said dame Iuno, but I curbd her speech with brows contracted, till shee did beseech With trickling teares, that I would pardon giue, protesting she would neuer after grieue My royall person; wishing my delight, if it pleas'd me euen in my Iunos sight Wherewith I seemd appeasd, and fayning sleepe, with eie-lids shut, my heart a watch did keep; Euer conceiuing somthing what I know not, which if I knew, it's shame for Gods to show it, Being lasciuious passions which were bred of the distempred humors of my head. But to be briefe, I did by meanes contriue their long sought loues fruition to depriue, Which thus accomplish'd, I am glad of this. Venus intreates what Ioue himselfe did wish. This I will doe, (which done) may seeme a wonder, equall their ioies, yet distance them asunder. He from his Thysbe, Thysbe from her loue, Ioue for his Thysbe, Thysbe for her Ioue. This said: bright Uenus happy to receiue The full accomplisht sute which she did craue, Takes leaue of loue, and taking leaue he kist her, amidst his kisses with his prayres he blist her. Uenus to Ida hies Idas she sends Embassadour to Thysbe, who attends, The Gods decree; where hauing come at last, tels to Thysbe all discourse was past Twixt Ioue &amp; Venus, yet not all she told, for Venus bade him loues intendments hold, Lest his narration should more sorrow breede, then any comfort drawne from humane seede: For well I know no Ioue so precious to her, as was her louely Pyramus. When Idas had exprest what Ioue decreed, he tooke his leaue of Thysbe, and with speede Return'd to Venus, Uenus Queene of loue, whom he with Mars found lying in a groue Of leauy Poplars, sporting midst their pleasure. Uulcan was absent, they had time and leisure. Where we will leaue them, and swift Idas traine, and to our loue-sick Thysbe turne againe. Thysbe address'd to die, yet long in dying, Draws courage to her, &amp; that blade espying. VVhich was be crimsond with the bloudy gore, of that same murder it had done before; Takes it into her hand, (her hand God wot as soft as downe, such weapons handled not Before this time, (and this time was too soon to vanquish bewty, and to cut it downe. Poore wench she knew not how to vse the blade, for other armour Nature had her made. But like an vntraind Souldier wanting skill, knows not to fight, yet vseth his good will, Trauerse his ground as other souldiers doe, yet hath no method, for he knows not how: Euen so this heauenly creature handled it, long time vncertaine how to mannage it. At last by reason, reason did acquaint, which was the pummell, which the fatall point, Grasping the blade which she before did take, to th' shade which shadowed Pyramus shee spake. Thou shadowing tree, that shadowes this dark tombe, shelter vs two, that passengers which come, Vnto this forrest, may thy pitty praise, and memorise thy loue in after daies. Thou seest we are depriu'd of friend or make, which may deplore with teres our forlorne state. Supply our want with thy remorsefull shade, since (as it seemes) for pitty thou was made, Couer vs two (two louers) that would be gladly ore-cannoped with th' leaues of thee. Thou couerst him already: happy time, that twists about him with those spraies of thine. If Nature had accorded to our vowes, these armes had clept that necke, those flowry bowes, Doe now enfold: but heauens haue so decreed, to haue two louers clad in sable weed. Which I accord vnto, heauens purge my sinne, hee's gone before, and I must follow him. Which said, she fix'd the sword vnto her Brest, with more then womans spirit which exprest, Her loue vnto her Saint, who lay along, congeal'd in bloud, whose trunke shee fell vpon. The tree sent out her Branches, which did couer, their corps with vernant blossomes, shadowed ouer. Aurora breath'd vpon them, whose sweet breath, perfum'd their bodies, seazd vpon by death. Siluan. Epicædium. This done in silent passage of the Night, when stars shone fair &amp; bright in Thetis sight, The rural Wood-nimphes did their Odes display, sabled with woes: which woes to take away, They sung these verses, verses ominous, Ore Thisbes hearse, and louely Pyramus. Long may your fame and glory heer remain, honour'd by vs, and by each country Swaine. Long may you liue renowned, for your loue hath made perpetuall eccoes in this groue. A thrice blest groue, blest graue for such blest Saints, That in this flowry pale heere pitch their tents, Wherein loues warre eternized for aye, lost that by night, which was restor'd by day, Smell sweet for euer, sweetest of all sweets: you springing blossoms which the spring-time greets. Send out your fragrant sauor and releeue, our troubled springs which be adddress'd to grieue. Let not your vernant bosome so retaine, all comfort from the oat-pipe of a Swaine, That no release of sorrow or distresse, makes diminution of his wretchednesse. What should we sing? no hymne of melody: shall ere possesse our desert empery. No tune of ioy, no pleasant straine of mirth, shall yeeld contentment to Nereus birth. For farre more faire, more beautious, Thysbe was then any wood-Nimph, any Country Lasse. Campaspe shee was faire, and was belou'd, of potent Monarchs: her proportion mou'd, Doting Apelles, loues effects to shew, to that same picture which his Pencile drew. Yet if Campaspe were enshrined heere, no cause of loue would in her frame appeare. More diuine feature was in Thysbes face, a more delightfull smile more comely grace, Then ere Apelles, though in skill most rare, could make his picture any way compare. Bring mirtle branches let vs couer them, shrowding their corps with wreaths laid ouer them; And euery time and tide, let's shed a teare, ouer the sad memoriall of their Bere, Well doe these odes of sorrow vs beseeme, and better would they please Arcadias Queene, Then if with feasts and triumphs we should spend, our dismall houres, about a louers end. Wee are not for Dianas cheerefull game, though we (foretime) haue well approou'd the same. No quiuer, nor no bow, will we receiue, till wee haue spent our dirges on their graue, Whose glorious loues, so well conioyn'd in one, makes their two teares distill into one stone. For euery drop of bloud which doth descend, from Thisbes wound, flies to her louing friend: And those same streames which issued out amaine, from Pyramus make their recourse againe. And ioyne with Thysbe, whose respectiue wound, licks vp the blood was shed vpon the ground. Eternall Trophies hung vpon your hearse, made euerlasting, by our pensiue verse; And let this marble which doth couer you, her teares (each morne) with moistned drops renew, Which in remorse, compassionate may spend, some dewie drops to witnesse your sad end. You pretty gliding streames which run apace, leaue off your course, and flow vnto this place, That you may moisten this sad monument, this desert herse with watry element. And gratifie our loue, that loue you deare, and wish entirely your sweet presence heere. Leaue off to wash those cliues and ruggy caues, and now repaire to monumentall graues, To rinse all foule infection which did staine, the corps deceas'd by your still streaming vaine. Why doe you stay? why seeme you so hard harted, to shed no teares, at constant loue departed? If that our Queene should heare, as shee shall heare, this your remorselesse hart would cost you deare. Doe you not see how we in sable weeede, to weepe amaine, haue heere repair'd with speed? And in distresse enclos'd, full fraught with woe, may aske of you what's cause you doe not soe? See how ech sprig sends out a pearled drop, and when the pruner seemes their height to crop, They seeme to thanke him for it wishing death, to decke these louers with a flowry wreath. See how each bird resorts vnto their shrine, as if it were vnto some power diuine: And dedicates vnto their mournfull tombe laies, which shal serue in after times to come. They warble out their dolefull funeralls, hauing forgot their forepast festiualls. Their sad aspects such sorrow doth affoord, that we our selues their sorrows may record Time yeelds no tune, nor tune obseru's no time, time, tune, nor measure keep we ore this shrine, We cannot descant, descant there is none, to such as know no descant but to mone. Like spouse-lost Turtles, do we flocke together, and on each morn by time, consort we hither To celebrate their deaths with memorie, whose constant loues make them charactred be. Nor will we cease, or make an end of griefe, till that their parents yeeld them some reliefe, To consummate their wishes, and supply their former hardnes by their clemency: For in no time did euer children find, parents more wilfull, to their loues vnkind. Yet for that Fate hath done her worst of ill, in that she did the bloud of louers spill. And tyrannis'd in shewing of her force. raging gainst loue, depriued of remorse: Let Parents cease to hate, and make amends, by solemne hests for their vntimely ends. It is not fit that death and enmity should wage their battaile euer mutually. For none I know, but when their foe is dead they scorne base enuy in their brests to feede. But let vs to our worke, and build vs bowres, compos'd of fragrant blossomes, and of flowers, Hard by this tombe, this herse, this desert graue, where we may giue what constant loue doth craue, An ode displaying passion: and relate, the sad euent of loues vnhappy state. Each nimph addresse her to her dolefull voice, that we may charme the furies with our noise; And draw their haplesse parents from their cell, to heare the sadd Narration we shal tell. So shall our first-mornes mone performed bee, in honour of these louers constancy. Siluanor: Threnodia. If any rurall God, or poore swaine, consecrate Leucothoes rod, to this plaine: This herse, deckt with sable verse, Shall commend Him as our friend, Our springs, or groues, our straine. Let your Temples sweet, mixed be. With perfumes, let their feete embalmed be. Then will we, mutually Still expresse, And confesse, You deserue eternitie. Venus with mirtlewand, Cupid, bow, Pelops with his Iuory hand will bestow; All in one, to this stone To declare Loue is rare, Loue that hath no painted show. Ioue admires Thysbes face full of fauor, Mirrha likes the striplings grace and behauiour, Venus lippe, Ios skippe, Were both rare, Yet both are, In one Thysbe, Ioue would haue her. From Olympus Ioue espies Thysbes beauty, Which no sooner he descries, then in duety, Cupids dart wounds his heart, He by force, Sues diuorse, Iuno cannot please his fancy. Thus did Thysbe liue and dye, liue by dying Death confirmes her deity, in applying To her shrine, power diuine, Which doth shew, And renew: Life anew, renewed by dying. This ode thus tuned in more dolefull sort, Then any Muse of mine can make report: Such errours made resound both farre and neere, that these sad straines came to their parents eare. They much perplex'd to heare such wofull newes, vvhich floods of teares in their moist eies renues; With speed they could, (which speed but easie was,) they made recourse vnto that forlorne place. Teares trickled downe, as drops from Ætas hil. which with their streams ech hollow caue did fill For woes exceeded more in that their Tombe, had bard them hope of future ioys to come. For they were old, old folkes desire to see, a good successe vnto their progeny. But now no hope, mishap had cross'd their hope, e're to attaine at their desired scope. Oh what salt seas for seas they seem'd to be, no drops but floods, vvhich run incessantly From their dim eies, for teares had made them dim, which, nere the lesse, they took much pleasure in. Oft would the Mother clip her Thysbe round, vvhich lay all sencelesse on the bloudy ground, And vvith a kisse (as old vviues vse to doe,) her entire loue, her withered lips did show. Turne to thy Mother (quoth he) or receiue, thy dolefull Mother in thy haplesse graue; Acknowledge her that first, aye me too soone, brought thee to light, vvhich is eclyps'd &amp; done; I nourished thee, and with a kind embrace, made me an Idoll of that beauteous face; For I conceiu'd, deceiu'd I could not be, No birth more perfect, then the birth of thee. Thus did the doting trot deplore her fall, with dropping nose, faint breth, more then them all That did attend her passion: for the rest did more represse those passions she exprest, Nor is it proper, well I know, that man should shed his teares with ease as women can; For they more prompt to comfort, yeeld releefe, to such as are opprest with heapes of greefe, And can conceale their sorrow, as is fit, knowing the meanes and way to bridle it. They thus remaining ore their childrens graue, the hatefull ground, which did their corps receiue, They did consult how they might expiate that wrong of theirs, which they had done so late. Which whilst they did aduise, they straight did see, their childrens vowes, grauen in an Oliue tree. Which were to this effect. “Surcease to mourne, “and place our seuerall ashes in one Vrne. For whilst we liu'd, we lou'd, then since we dye, let one poore vrne preserue our memory. And let this day recorded bee by you, and festiue kept: eternise louers true. Giue vpper hand to him, for he was first: respect with care, our bones be not disperst Amongst vnhallowed reliques which will staine the glorious Trophies which our loue did gaine, Bee not vnkind vnto your childrens loue, but what they like, let your consent approue, For if your minds disposed so had beene, this spacicious glasse of woe you nere had seene. But we forgiue, forget, so you performe, what we haue wish'd: we feast, cease you to mourn. These hestes, these rites thus read; without delay, they sought their forepast guilt to take awaie, And rinse their former ill by present good, yeelding to loue which they before with-stood: For admiration rapt them, and they saw, no curbe could hold the reins of Venus lawe: For she enioyn'd them loue, which they obey'd, which by no Parents wishes could be stai'd. Each in their order did their obsequies, with solemne rites as their last exequies, Making a fire of Iuniper compos'd, in which their louely corps seem'd well dispos'd, Which were consum'd to ashes and conseru'd, in one small pot, as wel their fame deseru'd. This vrne, poore vrne, which kept their ashes sure, was made of Brasse, that it might ere endure, And as a relique, reliques then were vsed, in Nimrods Temple in a chest enclosed. There was it put, to which as some report, all constant louers vs'd to make resort. No marriage rite was to be consummate, Before they did this relique inuocate, That it would be propitious to their loue, in signe where of each gaue a Turtle-Doue, To explicate their truth, their constancie, which they obseru'd for euer solemnly. Thus were these two with honour well rewarded, their ashes, as times Monuments regarded, Kept and reseru'd for Fame, Fame grac'd the earth, in suffering Nature bring so faire a birth Into the world, which world vnworthy was, to haue two mirrors and to let them passe. But time, vnthankfull time, too soone forgot the Gem she had, as if she had it not. Soild in the lustre, lustre it had none, depriu'd of Fame, when her renowne was gone, For Parents breathlesse were, and with their birth, by times succession were interr'd in earth. In selfe-same earth for they desir'd to haue, their childrens hearse their vrne, their comely graue Which hauing got, men neuer did adore, their sacred hearse as they had done before. For lesse were they esteem'd, so from that time, nere any louer came vnto their shrine. Yet to this day, their pictures doe remaine, in Marble wrought, describing euery vaine. Ech ruby blush, mix'd with a crimson die, with Thysbes smile decolour'd wantonly. With face defac'd by times iniurious frowne, hath shown more beauty th? my Muse hath shown. The answere of Hipolitus vnto Phædra. The Epistle of Hyppolitus vnto Phædra. The Argument. Hyppolitus son to Theseus, by the Amaz? Hippolite, solicited by his step mother Phedra to sensuality, seekes by all meanes to represse her inordinate lust by exemplifying the worth, resolution, and magnanimity of his father &amp; her husband Theseus: as also aggrauating the foulenes of the fact she intended producing reasons to disswade her from prosecuting her purpose any further: as more particularly the scandall of the world, which of necessity would ensue upon committing of a fact to detestable to the supreame deitie so exorbitant to the law of nature. Next he propo?deth the ineuitable reuenge of the Gods aboue, who could not suffer such impieties to passe with impunity: but would chastise incestuous actions with the exquisitest punishments they reserue for any delinquent: concluding his Epistle more emphatically; assuring her if she would not desist from her lasciuious intendments, Theseus should be acquainted with her entirest thoughts, who in no wise could brooke her insatiable desires, but ere long would expiate the guilt of her sin with the sacrifice of her blood. If modest lines send out a modest smile, and those immodest vows you dedicate Vnto my youth; youths frailty to beguile, my vertuous blossoms to extenuate, What should I write? or in what tempred stile should I describe the ruine of my state? Since vertue is my centre, truth the scope, At which I aime the leuell of my hope? I will not call you wanton, but you seeme too too respectles of your glorious fame. That once in Creet for bewty deem'd a Queene, should now grow carelesse to eclipse the same. O better fruits should in that groue be seene, then to neglect the glory of your name. Minos esteemed was more pure, more iust, then to expose his house to shamefull lust. Turne to your spouse my father, and obserue his worth, his merits, and disclaime your vow, See what respect your Theseus doth deserue, who consecrates his loue &amp; life to you: Then I am sure you will be loth to swerue from your allegeance, which is Theseus dew. He thinkes him blest in you, O doe not then impaire the blessing of such blessed men. But if you will distaine my fathers bed, make it a brothel prostitute to sinne, Rest well assur'd Ile neuer heare it said. that I his sonne that leudnesse did begin, To poyne the prime rose, or to see it fade within his bed where I haue nourish'd been, For ill it would beseeme both him and me, that his gray head should weare my liuerie. Let not the glory of your ancient house attainted be, or dazed by your staine: For after ages would speake worse of vs, and this our shame would euermore remaine: Which could not chuse but grow pernicious to the renowme your Theseus did attaine. That he who many monsters vanquished, should let a monster liue within his bed. Employ those thoughts so wantonly inclin'd to th' comfort of your spouse, let him receaue Th' elixir of your loue anew resin'd your loues the haruest which your Lord doth craue: Then keepe not from him that which is assigned, by powers supernall for his worth to haue: Adore no shrine but his, let mine alone, I am his image, he and I are one. How ill would it beseeme distastfull youth, to wrong the winter of his reuerend age: Whom (if not gracelesse) would it not moue to'ruth? to soile his bed, Whose nie-spent Pilgrimage Craues pitty by prescription, grac'd bs truth, and vertues colours, making fame his page, To follow euery action with her breath, to giue him life when seaz'd vppon by death. Looke at the trophies Cressa doth possesse, times monumentall characters of worth, And you shall see his spoiles deserue no lesse, then adoration deifi'd on earth. Since euery act proclaimes his mightinesse, as if descended from Ioues diuine breath. His wars, his conquest, each expresse his merit, indude with more then Adamantine spirit. Leaue of inuiting your Hyppolitus to festiue banquets, of incestuous meeting, Well loues he Phædra, better Theseus, then to wrong age with such licentious greeting, To make his owne to be most trecherous. the sowrest tast from him that seemd his sweeting, In working shame 'gainst him who first sustained far more for me then in me is contained. Much do I wonder how you should conceiue, such a suspicious thought of my neglect, Vnto my fathers age? or how you haue, grounded the reasons of your fowle suspect? That I his childe, my childehood should depraue, affecting that which loue cannot effect, Which loathed pleasures, loath'd they are (God wot, to vse those sports which Nature fancieth not. These pastimes which I follow yeelde content without repentance: heere's no Parents shame, No worlds Rumor: dangers imminent, haue no repose mongst those: admired fame Followes the Court, and places eminent, each seeking how they might dilate their name. But I respectlesse of Fames admiration, reape the content of harmelesse recreation. Heere steepy clifts, and heauen-aspiring Hilles, Yeeld a sweet aier to relish my delight, There pleasant springs, from whence sweet streames destills to quench my thirst: and when the glomie night. Shuts vp the raies of Phœbus, rest we still till rosie cheek'd Aurora shew her light. Then we addresse vs to our sports againe, For where we take delight there is no paint, Then pardon me, (if pardon I may aske) that knowes no other pleasure then is heere, That neuer tooke vpon me any taske, but the pursuing of the harmelesse Deere. I need not shame, my blush requires no maske, I haue no obiects of affection neere, But the true splendor of a Natiue face, not mix'd with colours to augment her grace. If Ariadne desolate, forlorne, should heare of your intendments: what would she Reply, but ieast, that he who had forsworne those solemne vowes which should obserued be, Hath well deseru'd to weare his wantons horne, that dedicates her selfe to luxurie. O fie for shame, let shame represse that sinne, which not repress'd will shame both you and him. How glad would Ariadne heare of this, who rests deiected, rob'd of that same Gem, Which you respect not: she conceiu'd a blisse in his sweet smile, whose sweetnesse did regaine Her much prisd loue, her spels explan'd no lesse; In the subduing him, who more had slaine, Then any monster, that in Crote was bred; yet by her Art was soone discomfited. But she! vnhappy she, as Bacchus would, depriu'd of him, for whom such panels she tooke, In Chios left, neere after to behold her darling Theseus, who (you know) forsooke Her much distress'd distresses did enfold the very mansion pitch'd on high to looke, At that vnhappy place where Theseus left her, whose absent steps all comfort had bereft her. Then you that are preferr'd before her loue, set not at sale the treasure you possesse, Let Ariadnes exile something moue that fickle minde of yours, whose wantonnesse, Seemes more transparant in that you approue more of my loue, then of his excellence. Whose beautious outside's faire, but you may finde, a farre more beauteous inside of his minde. Constant he is, witnesse Peritheus, whose two combined hearts so well vnited, Haue eterniz'd the loue of Theseus: Mirrour of men, that men should be exiled, To passe such shelfes of perrils dangerous, With sight of poore Proserpina delighted: Whom to exempt with Pluto, they remaine, the one imprison'd close, the other slaine. Yet could not Pluto barr his eies from teares, which he pourd out each morne vpon the hearse, Of his deare friend, loue after death appeares, which like an Ecco earths abysse did pierce, Oppress'd with woe, surmises of vaine feares. Maugre the furie, of those Furies fierce, And Fiends below, which could not him surprise with dastard feare: Braue Spirits feare despise. O doe not then expose his vertuous age, to such dishonour, adde no discontent Vnto his outworne strength, lest you enrage his patient spirit aboue his element. Doe not corrupt your honour nor engage, the glory of your birth so eminent. Scandalls are soone engendred sooner bred, then after-times can make extinguished. Doe not degrade your Theseus from his throne, Which he enioies, conceiuing more delight, In that he hath this little of his owne, reaping contented harbour on the night, Then th' husband man to reape what he hath sowne, or the poore Turtle, in her Turtles sight. Beleeue me Queene, more doth your presence please Your Theseus heart, then any one of these. If you would haue Hippolitus to loue, Loue aged Theseus for Hippolitus sake; For by those heauenly powers that raigne aboue, more comfort shall Hyppolitus partake By that affection, then Idalias groue, ere reap'd in Venns when he did awake, And rous'd from silent flumber to returne, vnto her Birds which for their Queen did mourn. Alas, faire queene, why should you thus assault, the vnprouided fortresse of mine hart; Or why should you your colours thus exalt, displaying ruine to my chiefest part, And vnder ground as in some secret vault laying your shot, intending to subuert, The Bulwarke which supports my slender being, to raze my Fort and put my friends to fleeing. The fort which I possesse is my pure heart, my friends the vertues which do keepe my fort, The first in all my dolours beares a part, the second in distresse do make resort, To arme my soule against inuasions dart vpon their foe, their furie to retort. Were 't not a pittie then to see that fall, which doth sustaine my selfe my meanes and all? But sure you see in me some shew of pleasure, and gladly would haue me expresse my thought, Obiecting to my senses time and leasure, seldome are such delights so lightly bought, High is the price of such a precious treasure, and well deserues it to be throughly sought: But I reply that pleasure lasts not long that tis vsurp't by force, and tane by wrong: I loue no bitter sweets immixd with gall, whose sharp repentance drowns the pleasure past, A pure vnspotted soule, whose Brasenwall can hold out battrie and wil euer last That feare no ruine, no declining fall, soilde with no blemish of her mindes distaste, But fraught with wealth, thrice happy in her wealth feeding on free delights, not got by stelth. What is that pleasure, where attendeth feare, As faith-infringers doe: who violate The faith they owe: whereby it doth appeare, they rest respectlesse of their future state, Preferring lust before their Spousals deare, their shame with shamelesse Acts to aggrauate: O none God wot: no pleasure can be there, where there is nought but actions of despaire. O let those hests inuiolable stand, which heauens aboue confirme, and let them be As Charactres, writ by dame Natures hand to eleuate our senses purity: Proceeding from the immortall powers command, to consummate our liues integrity. That loue's well squared by an equall line. whose ground-worke is grounded on the lawes diuine But if these motiues cannot caution you, not to adulterise your Nuptiall bed, Be you assur'd to Theseus I will shew those indigested humors which are bred, By your vnsetled thoughts which doe renew an heape of passions in your troubled head. All which concording make that discord true. No faith more faithlesse then the Faith of you. Your brittle sexe, so brittle is your mould, you cannot long be free from alteration: Grounds her foundation on no certaine hold, but tost with sundrie gusts of times mutation, Expos'd to shame and to confusion sold, infringing loue to purchase recreation, Which we by nature do accompt a shame, to set them light that haue esteemed them. Vertues surpriser, chastities depriuer, sower of discord, refuge to the worst, Forge of ambition enmities contriuer: an hatefull monster, vipers birth accurst, Friendships dissoluer, simple soules deceiuer, which from perdition had her birth-right first. The soile and sale of honour soonest showen, where men affect all pleasure saue their owne. And what be those but vaine, vnsauourie ioyes, whose fruits vnseas'ned yeeld but small delight, When comforts are conuerted to annoies, the beauty of our day obscur'd by night, And that we iudg'd for serious seeme as toies, which haue eclips'd the glory of their light: And then reuoluing what we did admire let fall our hopes, to greater things aspire. O be asham'd to blemish that faire Roote, which had deriuall from the powers aboue, Staine not your bed with your polluted foot, loue him alone whom you are bound to loue, Giue no occasion to your Spouse to doubt of your licentious passion, but remoue, Both guilt and guilts, suspicion, whose bright eyes, Iealouse of nought your secret'st councels spies. Will you for any pleasure lose respect, of all your kindred that attend your fame, Which once surpriz'd by infamies suspect, will call your acts augmenters of their shame? O doe not so: let not your lust effect, the ruine of that house from whence you came: But as your glorie doth surpasse the rest, so in your heart let vertue build her nest. Vaine is the flower, soone fading, soone forgot, which you do pamper to your ouerthrow, Time will be, when those beautious corps shall rot, their poore remainder to the earth bestowe; Then you shall be as if you flourish'd not plac'd in earths centre, Stigian lake belowe, Where Minos iudgement giues of euery sin, that those are guiltie may remaine with him. He was your father, yet his equitie, will not permit his Phædra to transgresse: His lawes haue no exception, puritie onely exempted is, whose eminence Was first ordain'd to raigne eternally, in the Elisian fields Ioues residence; Then chuse which two you please, whether you'le dwel, in heauen with Ioue, or with your Sire in hell. Erect your thoughts depressed downe belowe, and let them soare vnto an higher pitch Then terrene pleasures, let that beauteous show of outward colours your affection teach To taste the Spring of sweetes, from whence doth flowe such mines of treasure, as will more enrich The Ars'nall of your minde then vaine delight, which lopped is before it come to height. Recall to minde Ixions punishment, see in a mirror what his folly got, Who whil'st he soar'd aboue his element, kindly receiv'd of Ioue, himselfe forgot: And as a streame which runs too violent, passing his bounds and limits, knoweth not How sooue that flowe shall haue a sudden fall, whose boundlesse current kept no mene at all. So did Ixion who in selfe-conceit of his proportion did aspire too high, Affecting Iuno which did ruinate, the mansion of his Pristine dignitie, Dasling that sun which shone so bright of late, for with a clowde deceiv'd engendred he The Centaurs varied formes, which being bred, to Pelion came, where they inhabited. O then confine affection with the bound, of vertues honour, giuing her the place In euery action, making reasons ground the strong foundation, Time cannot deface, With beautious faire contexture closed round, a correspondence twixt rhe minde and face: The one renown'd by th' others puritie, as if both made to make one vnity. Shall Hymens temple be defac'd by you, Her sacred hests by your inconstancy; O be assur'd the gods will punish you, imbranding shame in your posteritie, To breake your faith and wrong a friend so true, vnder pretence of mere simplicitie: Leue vertus shadowe, and your selfe betake, to loue the shadow for the substance sake. VVhat vertues did your maiden yeeres attend? white was your roabe but whiter was your mind, VVhen all your actions did to vertue tend; Each sence her proper function had assign'd, Vertues foundation had perfections end, youth mix'd with grace: rare was 't your like to finde, But now your lustre soil'd by shamelesse sinning, argues your end farre worse then your begining. Crete made renown'd by fathers memory, shal't be extinguish'd by the daughters shame? Times auntient browe records his equitie. for time-impartialisters merit fame, Proude was the earth to haue such men as he: earth seem'd by him to change her earthly name. For nere did fame with truth so neerely meete, as when your aged father gouern'd Crete. O then be daughter to so good a father, be his lifes pattern, shew from whence you sprang, Seeke to reuiue his glorie tropheis rather, then by your shame to see them ouerthrowne, Some fruitfull blossomes from his vertues gather: so may you make your fathers fame your owne: Crete was sustained oft by others fall. but she's sustain'd by Phædra most of all. How will this trumpe of glorie make your mind too low deiected, seeke an other port Then that you aime at now: where you shall finde, more perfect solace when you make resort Vnto the shrine of Vertue, that's refined with purest colours, where the strongest fort That could be built by Nature or by Art, conserues the sacred treasure of the heart. O time deceing youth abusing time, making her stale to obiects of delight, Seeing the best will to the worst decline: Night-owle, whose works dare not approach the light, Prophaning that which was before diuine, Truth's great'st opponent, vertues second sight, Whose minde bewitching vanities ensnare, our captiv'd reason with a seeming faire. More should I write, but that I loath to write of such a subiect whose lasciuious soyle, Makes my poore lines asham'd of such delights, That Parents birth, should Parents bed defile, Or to play false when he is out of sight: distrusting nought should I his trust beguile? O cease to loue liue to aduance your fame, freeing your Bed and me from Parents shame. Yours if your owne: But being not your owne, I will not reope what other men haue sowne. FINIS. Riddle me this. An Embleame including the Authors name. Two waies there be, one broade, the other straite, which two beat paths leade to a distinct state Of weale, of woe: this if you right explaine, the first, though worst, includes the Authors name. Or thus A Brea, a Banke, a Border, or a Shore, Smiles on his name that brought these Satires ore. His Crest His Crest a Cuckolds Crosse: his Motto, Heere I giue a Badge which Citizens doe weare. Blow my Plump-fac't Poulterer of Saffron Hill. To the equall Reader. If that thy nature answere to thy name, Thou in thy iudgement wilt expresse the same Which I entitle thee, and hate to be A squintei'd Critick to misconster me. Hows'ere: be what thou wilt, if Equall, finde Lines correspondent to thy Equall minde: If rough (for all my smoothnesse thou hast heard) Thou'se heare far rougher Satires afterward. For if these ierks so lightly laid on smart, Thoule finde rare whipping cheere i'th Second part. Where Furies run diuision on my song: Patience a while, and thou shalt haue't ere long. To the Captious Reader. My answer's this to him that saies I wrong Our Art to make my Epigrams so long; I dare not bite, therefore to change my nature, I call 't an Epigram which is a Satire.</field>
