      <field name="fulltext">Here begynneth the castell of laboure. Here begynneth the prologe of this present treatyse. O ye mortall people y? desyre to obtayne Eternall blysse by your labour diligent w? mortal riches subdue you to payne To rede this treatyse to the right ent?t whiche shall shewe you playne and euydent. That idelnes moder of all aduersyte Hyr subiectes bryngeth to extreme pouertye. The ryche by Idelnesse to pouertye ar brought By it the oratour leseth his scyence. The great clerke by it is set at nought. Thus is it ennemye vnto sapyence. wherfore let vs do our diligence. This leude capytayne fro vs to exyle whyche nought entendeth but man to begyle. Idell people euer troubled ar with thought. with indigence mysdauenture and necessyte And in the snare whan they ar cought They ar enuyroned with pouertye. Than cometh disconforte in theyr aduersyte. And also dispayre them doth manace. And thought &amp; trouble euer dothe them chace. Therfore ye people that be subiecte to this vyce. By your great sleuth and neglygence. Brake your bondes/I aduyse you to aryse And to these wordes gyue your aduertence whiche wyse man saythe in brief sentence. who laboureth nat to get his lyuynge Is nat worthy here to haue abidynge. Thus whan this vyce a man dothe assayle. Of sleuthfulnes and of ocyosyte By theyr meanes dothe ryches fayle. what foloweth than but pouertye. Thus tourneth his welthe vnto aduersyte. So of his foly dothe he repente. Than echone to hym dothe iniurye. whiche oft tÃ³ vs appereth euydent. Therfore to vs it is ryght profytable For to take reason for to be our gyde. wyth vnderstandynge/whiche ar agreable Us for to gouerne in euery tyde. wherby we may/yf sleuthe be set asyde Ouercome pouerte &amp; obteyne rychesse. And dystroy thought mysfortune &amp; distresse But mannys mynde is full vnstedfaste. More prone to vyce than to godlynesse. And whan by vyce man thus is ouercast Than cometh disceyte/vserye and falsnesse. Counsaylynge man all to vnthryftynesse. Thus yf that reason benat our frende and gyde. Trouthe shall decay/by falshode and pryde. But who wolde lyue in meane moderate. And by way of dilygence richsse purchace Good wyll must he haue to be his aduocate with a gode herte/for therin is solace Intencyon to gode/must we purchace. And than may we lyue bytwene hye &amp; lowe By suche meane that our frendes may vs knowe In this lyfe can none haue skarsnesse whyle that reason is his protectour. If he in labourynge take payne and besynesse Auoydynge sleuthe that blynde gouernour. whiche man assayleth euery day and hour wherby ar many brought to distresse But dilygence bryngeth man vnto rychesse By whiche rychesse man cometh to noblesse whiche to vertue is as cheyf nouryse. Therfore leue we sleuthe drawynge to besynesse Enclynynge to vertue &amp; leuynge couetyse. Thus is it gode to eche that is wyse Remembrynge howe sone he shall haue an ende In trouthe &amp; vertue his short tyme to spende Thus in conclusyon who redeth this treatyse To the rude langage gyue none aduertence It is but wryten the tyme to exercyse without study/payne/or dylygence. wyth style inorante/voyde of eloquence Expressynge the wayes of dilygence &amp; Idelnesse The one of pouertye the other of rychesse Thus endeth the prologe. And begynneth the castell of laboure. In musinge an euen?ge whit me was none An olde prouerbe cam in my subuena?ce A naturall foule in a hous alone wyll make for hym self shyft or cheuisa?ce Than cam in to my remembraunce. A circumspect of many dygnitees Fro whiche a man hauynge suffisaunce wythdraweth his herte as fro vanitees It is ay sene that youthes lustynesse For to subdue is harde and daungerous Some lyue in ioy/pleasure and gladnesse Fortune to some is right contrarious Some dethe tacheth in theyr estate prosperous whome he ouerthroweth with his mortall blast Thus goeth the worlde/none is so eurous But outher must he dye fyrste or last A yonge harte is vnstable and volage And knoweth nat in what estate to byde Some tyme disposed vnto maryage Somtyme to serue god the worlde set asyde Thus as my mynde varyenge dyd glyde I thought it moste for myne auauntage. Desyrynge god for to be my gyde Fermely I concluded vpon mariage. Thus hauynge all my frendes at assent In short processe I puruayed me a wyfe wythout wysdome/yet was I content To hyr to kepe the dayes of my lyfe I thought no thynge on wynynge losse or stryfe She vnto me lyghtly dyd consent Than in an euenynge sad and pensyfe By hyr lyenge symple of myne entente Sodaynly I was in great daunger For to me ferysly dyd appere An odyous man/an vnknowen straunger with thre women cruell of manere This company to me approched nere. whan that I them togeder sawe assemble So cruell was theyr countenaunce &amp; chere That fere constrayned my body for to tremble The man was mysshapen/pale and rusty Rude/foule and right abhomynable The wymen also as I coude spye Of shape were foule and detestable. Theyr chere was yll and myserable with countenaunce replenysshed with ire Lene as any wolf rauysable Theyr iyen brynnynge as rede as fyre. The man approched fyers as he wolde fyght wyth straynge iyen/&amp; sayde his name was nede His wyfe sayde necessyte she hyght. The seconde pouertye &amp; the thyrde in dede Hyr named distresse so thought I by hyr wede. Than I desyred to knowe theyr lynage Pouerty was theyr moderfull of drede This tolde they me in breyf langage. Touchynge theyr fader they coude nat denye But that he dwelt in the depest pyt of hell whan I that harde right sore aferde was I Than nede approched with co?tenaunce cruell Myne body streynynge so that it dyd swell Necessyte me so sore dyd handle So that sothly it semed right well Or that she went she wolde me strangle Than sodaynly cam pouertye whiche me tourmented with rudenesse Than with great crudelyte. Upon my bely lept distresse They all abounded in cruelnesse On me smytynge with all theyr myght Disgorgynge fyre in theyr fyersnesse Upon me as a torche lyght. Some at me foyned/some smote downe ryght That the strokes loude dyd redounde For all my payne/duryge that nyght My wyfe euer slept styll and sounde She in hyr pleasour dyd habounde And wolde nat wake for my dysease For yf I were brought to the grounde I trowe she cared nat apease As she thus slept and I in payne with these foure fures dyd endure To me approche I sawe certayne A foule and counterfayted creature Odius/proude and fyers I you ensure And by the hande she toke me fast She thought hyr purpose to procure And drewe myne armes that they nere brast This false witche me so dyd greue whiche by hyr name was called thought That vneth coude I me remeue Thus vnto dethe she me nere brought. Of wordes and tales she wanted nought Euer she talked I wot nat what And behynde hyr a vylayne coughed That was as blereiyed as a cat. Beynge in this perturbacyon This churle on me gaped full wyde I fered sore his intencyon whan that I sawe hym by my syde He loked as he had ben fryed Of shape and colour he was ful vyle Than he began with me to chyde In his langage whiche was subtyle Upon my bely he set his knees And sayde his name was heuynesse wyth scarled bordred were his iyes Bolde and full of vnlustynsse He semed fader of all vnthryftynesse Iagged and gardyd full vngay. with a face fylled with falsnesse Berdyd lyke to a kytlynge of may. Hym to beholde I was dismayde Howe he of thynges fast dyd clatter Many a newe tale to me he sayde He had well lerned for to patter Of thynges to come fast dyd he chatter Byddynge me call them to rem?braunce He lyst no thynge with me to flatter But put me to extreme vtteraunce. He bad I shulde remember my dettes And brought me forthe my countynge boke He shewed me there of my receptes And me compelled theron to loke By fere constrayned my body quoke That powre was past me for to speke That rybawde fered me with his loke That conforte to me coude I none toke. Of his turmente what sholde I say I neuer was in suche encumbraunce He bode styll and went nat away And dyd me moche more greuaunce Than all the other by theyr noysaunce And turned me fro syde to syde To slepe he lefte me no suffraunce But fersely styll at me dyd chyde This false caytyf by his cruelnesse Troubled me that my wyt was gone He put me in so great distresse That my herte was colde as any stone. I knewe nat to whome me for to mone So was I enuyroned rounde aboute. They me tourmented so echone That of my lyfe I had great doute. Than rounde aboute me dyd I loke Fyrste of all sawe I pouerte And fals nede by the berde me shoke. There were dystresse and necessyte. Thought was in theyr companye. And heuynesse dyd clater faste All these six so layde at me. That fro my bed they me nere caste. Than as I dyd my hede remeue About me lokynge for confort I sawe one come/whiche dyd me greue. More than all the other sorte. He sayde his name was disconforte. Of colour was he pale and wan It nought auayled hym to exorte. I sawe neuer suche another man. By the hande fast he me toke And with great myght dyd me constrayne Full sore me by the berde he shoke This thefe renewed all my payne His encumbraunce wasted my brayne That often I wysshed that I were dede He wolde hym selfe no thynge refayne. But kept me styll fast by the hede In frowarde imaginacion Disconforte kept me a longe space. He bad me in conclusyon To sue to hym after his grace. Saynge that the tyme and space Onys lost coude nat recouered be. with suche termes dyd he me manase Than in conclusyon thus sayde he. A pore man howe shalt thou pay All thy dettes that ar behynde. Brede and drynke must thou puruay. And a hous to kepe the fro the wynde Bothe men &amp; maydens must thou fynde. with euery thynge that longeth them to Doth nat fortune strongly the bynde. Nowe let se howe thou canst do. whan I this harde I was nere mad. And often fortune cursed I. The speciall cause why I was sad. was for my purse was clene empty Than was it nede I dyd espye My gowne to plege vnto one I sawe there was no remedye Thought that I had but that alone O blessed iesu what may this be Maryed was I in an euyll chaunce. To lyue in suche pouertye. As I this sayde the same instaunce. Cam to me Dispayre in cruell ordynaunce. One of the worste of all the sorte. She was cheyf captayne of theyr daunce And doughter vnto Disconforte. This dispayre dyd me so assayle. That loste was my discressyon. My face began to wax pale By fere of hyr cruell vexacion. So cruell was hyr perturbacion. whiche on me she dyd extende. That I thought in conclusion Of my selfe to make an ende. I was redy to renne here &amp; there. To clym vp a hye and than to fall By my lyfe set I nat an here. By meanes of this fury infernall I thought/who nedis to his deth shall. It is but folye it to prolonge This is a worde sayde ouer all. He that is drowned may no man hange. And therfore thought I for to do The worste that outher I coude or myght To sie my fader and moder also If I had founde them in my syght Than vnto my mynde cam full ryght That I shulde dye no more but onys wherfore Dyspayre that wretched wyght Bad me go therto at onys. I sawe well that without labour I neuer shulde obteyne rychesse. Fortune therof is gouernour To some she gyueth with largesse But I haue neyther mor nor lesse So that I wery am of my lyfe Auoyde of ioy full of distresse.
