      <field name="fulltext">PEARSE EDGECOMBE. The sharpest EDGE will soonest PEARSE and COME vnto AN end. Yet DOWT not, but be RICHE in hope, and take that I doo send. A. D. Pvt not trust in fading earth pust vp with fainting staies; Possesse the Lord, so shall you still persist in godlie waies. Exalt your eies from common shapes, esteeme not of this pelfe; Expresse in deeds what faith you haue, examine wel your selfe. As windes disperse the wau'ring chaffe, and tosse it quite away; All worldlie pompe shall so consume, and passe without delay. Repleated oft with wandring change recount your life to be; Remember wel, no blessed fruite remaines on cursed tree. So shal you trace the perfect path saluation to attaine; So shal you see this glittering glose set out to be but vaine. Extinguish then the carnal course exempted from aboue; Expell the qualmes of fond delights, excell in godlic loue. Depart not from the liuing Lord, delight to read his word; Delaie no time, for he doth still defend vs with the sword. Giue to your God your soule &amp; life, good gain insues thereby; Grieue not the Spirit that warneth you great dangers for to flie. Cast all your care on him alone, care for no other praie, Considering he your greatest griefes can quicklie take awaie. Of all things lent vnto this life one thing accompt the best, Onelie the truth &amp; feare of God, on which our souls must rest. Make no accompt of trustles trash, molesting misers minde; Mark how these maskers oft?times much care &amp; sorow finde. Beware betimes of had I wist; be not these pleasures vaine? Beleeue in Christ, and so you shall be sure to liue againe. To the Reader that is frendlie to Poetrie. VVhat so thou be that readst my Booke, Let wit so weigh my will; That due regard maie here supplie The want of learned Skill. A: D: THE FRENCH Historie AS walking on a daie, the woods and forrests nie: In shrilling voyce, and mournfull tunes, me thought I heard one crie. Which sodaine feare so dasht my blood and senses all, That as one in a traunce I staid to see what would befall. A thousand thoughts opprest my fearfull wauering braine, In musing what amid the woods that fearful voice shuld mean I feard least theeues had robd and cast some man aside: Because it was the common waie where men did vse to ride. Among the sauage beasts that in these woods remaine, I doubted least some trauler stood in danger to be slaine. But casting feare apart, I ranne toward the place, To see the wight that did lament, and waile his wofull case. Alone, no perill nigh, within a bushie dale, A stranger sate: I got aside to heare his dolefull tale. The pitiful lamentation of a godlie Frenche Exile, which for persecution forsooke his Countrie. O noble France (quod he) that bor'st sometime the bell, And for thy pleasure and thy wealth all Nations didst excell! How art thou now of late with mischiefe so possest, That al the Realmes of Christendome thy falshoods do detest? Where is thy vernant hiew? thy fresh and flowring fame? What fell vnluckie spot is this, that so dooth stain thy name?” Where is thy mirth become? where is thy smiling cheere?” Where is thy ioiful peace, that erst did make thee shine so cleer?” “Where are thy youthlie troopes, the Nobles of thy Land? “Where is thy faith; without the which, no realm can euer st?d. “Where is the mutuall loue that Prince and people had? “Where is the noble vnion, that makes the Countrie glad? “Where is the due regard that Princes ought to haue; “From all the bands of tyrannie their people for to saue? “Where is thy pitie gone, where is thy mercie fled; “That Lion-like in euerie place such Christian blood is shed? “But these of late to thee ô France haue bid adieu, “That rigor reignes in mercies seate: alas, it is too true. “For hauing no remorse to heare thy childrens grone, “Like as a widow comfortlesse thou shalt be left alone. “For they that feare the Lord, and haue for him a care, “Haue learnd too late the costlie wit thy treasons to beware. “Therefore thy children haue their natiue Coasts resignde, “With better hope in forrein Lands more mercie for to finde. “And that which is the worst, I see thou dost not waie “The Spiders spite, that long hath woue the web of thy decaie. “Therefore if thou wilt know the cause of all thy woe; “Then mark the judgments of the Lord, from which thou c?st not goe. Ieremie 9.12. If Iuda now (saith he) should aske the causes why “Their Land was like a wildernesse that no man passed by; “He makes no long delaie, but bids the Prophet show, “This plague doth alwaies follow them that do despise his law. “For they that Idols serue, and from the Lord doo shrinke, “They shal be fed with bitter gall, &amp; wormwood water drinke. “And why at sundrie times was Egipt plagued so? “But for because he would not yeeld to let Gods people goe. I. Samuel. 15. Why was the Lord with Saul so wroth and full of ire, “In sparing Agag and the beasts the people did desire? “For he had now accurst both Agag and his Land, “Commanding Saule without remorse to kil them out of hand: “Because this Amalek would not at all vouchsaue Within his Land Gods chosen flocke a passage for to haue:” Exodus 17.4. But falslie did conspire to worke their open shame, Numb. 24.20. To snare their feete they laie in waite from Egipt as they came. And thou Ierusalem, what sinne did file thy fall,” When Titus and Vaspasian did tumble downe thy wall?” Why did the Lord depart from thee that wast so braue,” And to thy foes made thee a pray, a iest, a seruile slaue?” Because amiddes thy mirth thy God thou didst forget,” And wouldst not haue his prophets liue, but didst th? il intreat.” O France therefore be wise, learne ere it be too late” By these examples, to begin these bloodie sinnes to hate.” France compared with Iuda, Egipt, Agipt and Ierusalem. For thou with Iuda land hast done thy God great wrong, To serue and set vp other Gods to runne a whoring long. Thou hast for wooden Gods, Gods liuelie Image spilde: And with the streams of christi? blood the streets &amp; canels fild Thou hast with Egipt long Gods word in prison pent;” And wilfullie refusde the light that he to thee hath sent.” The Moses that begins this light for to vnfolde,” Thou seekst to lap him presentlie in chaines and irons colde.” Thou dost with Amalek with all thy wit assaie” To lie in waite that in thy land the truth may haue no waie.” And thou a crueil nursse to Gods elect hast been,” To blemish thus the shining light that in thee hath bin seene.” And with Ierusalem Gods Prophets thou hast slaine,” That in thy popish ignorance thou mightest still remaine.” If Iuda shall be fed with wormwood mixt with gall;” If wilfull Egipt plagued were that kept Gods Church in thral;” If God no pitie showde, and mercie none would haue” Vpon the land of Amalek, nor man nor beast to saue;” And if the blinded pride that in Ieruslem dwelt,” Could not escape Gods heauie wrath, but man &amp; childe it felt.” What shall become of thee thou blinde and bloodie land?” How dost thou think for to escape Gods iust reuenging hand?” “But sith I doo not doubt God will reuenge our case, “And for his chosen when he list prouide a dwelling place; “I will no more lament in sad and mourning stile, “But thanke the Lord that set me safe within this pleasant Ile. “O happie England, thou from God aboue art blest, “Which hast the truth established with peace and perfect rest. “God giue thee therewithall a good and thankfull minde, “That to thy louing God no waie thou shew thy selfe vnkinde. “But still thou maist remaine as thou hast been of yore, “A Nurse to Gods afflicted flock, that he maie blesse thee more? “But now will I depart, the Lord direct my waie, “And send me in this pleasant Ile some simple slender staie: “Till God grant me returne, or otherwise prouide. The French Pilgrime hauing espied the Authour, commeth to him. But is not that an English-man that I haue yonder spide? The talke betweene them. Wel met my frend, tel what thou art that mak'st this mone? And whie within these desart woods are thou thy selfe alone? The Pilgrim. I am a stranger wight, and France my natiue soyle, Fr? which, of late, by luckles chance, &amp; need, am forst to toyle. Such troubles and such warres of late haue there befell, “That such as feare the Lord aright no suretie haue to dwell “Within that wofull Land: so God me hether sent “To liue with you in happie state, which he this Land hath l?t. The Englishman the Author. Oh happie then am I: my frend I thee desire Come goe with me, for of these warres I greatly long to hear. And if that thou wilt staie, as long as thou wilt craue My house as thine, and all therein thou shalt be sure to haue. Therefore my frend I praie, thy wit and tongue prepare, The cause of all these bloodie broiles in verse for to declare. And first of all describe the matter, and the man, The place, the time, the manner how this Ciuill warre began. The Exile. O Sir, but this request doth pierce my wounded hart, “Which gladly would forget again my woful countries smart. “For who can well displaie the treasons and the guiles, The bloodie murders mercilesse, the snares and craftie wiles” Which France hath put in vre these thirtie yeeres and more,” The like of which in Christendome was neuer seene before?” But sith it is your will to know the wofull state” Of Christs afflicted Church in France, which Antichrist doth hate.” Come rest you here a while, and marke what I shall tell,” Great warres &amp; broiles I must declare, God gr?t it may be wel.” And first to pitch the plot that you doo so desire,” I will vnfolde the cheefest cause that kindled first this fire.” The Fr?ch Pilgrime describeth the cause of the Ciuill warrs in Fr?ce About the verie yeere of Christ his Incarnation A thousand fiue hundred fiftie seuen by just c?putation: Henrie ware the Crowne the second of that name, In whose vnhappie Reigne began this fearfull fierie flame. For now in France began Gods truth for to appeere, Whose ioiful beames in Germanie at this time shone ful cleer. But as the Iewes sometimes Gods Prophets did despise, And as the Scribes and Pharisies did set their whole deuise To shade the shining light, which God to them had sent: So France in furie blindlie set against Gods truth is bent. Which truth but latelie sowen, and scant appearing greene, They seeke by force, by fire &amp; sword to roote &amp; raze it cleene. But though proud Pharao did Gods chosen long oppresse, Yet still amiddes the fierie broiles his people did increase. So now amiddes the flame Gods word a passage found, Which did increase his chosen flocke by force of siluer sound. VVhich sound in Gods elect did worke such sodaine change In all estates, that at the first in France it seemed strange. Gods mightie Spirite did worke his mercie still was prest, That some of all estates were calde their blindnesse to detest. Though riches be a let, and noble birth some staie, That verie few of these (saith Christ) do finde the perfect way: Yet God to bring to passe the worke he did intend, Did also raise some Noble men the poorer to defend. So now they fall at square, now here began the strife: For Sathan could not beare to see a new reformed life. That Prophesie is true (for Christ did speak the word) Matth. 10.34. I came not to giue peace to mine, but strife, debate, &amp; sword. Luke 12 31. The sonne against the sire, one frend against another, The word shal brothers part, &amp; set the daughter gainst the mother. So fel it out in France, his word did now deuide His chosen, from the rest of those that tooke the aduerse side. The Land deuided thus, two parts there fell at first; Gods people were in number least, the greater was the worst. Now Sathan was afraid, for now he striued sore To keepe the King and chiefest States in blindnes as of yore. It pincht him to the quicke to lose his kingdome so, It greeude him to the hart that he should let his seruants go. He sits not idle now, he calls his wits in place, Some cunning knacke for to contriue to help him in this case. His wilie wilfull craft by long experience bred Hath taught him now an ancient feat to crush the gospels head. The first oration of the diuell to the king, the Queen mother and Court of Paris. Now summons he his men and seruants to appeere; Now help me at this need (quoth he) my frends &amp; felows deer: Now is the time to stirre while matters yet be newe, While blinded mindes in doubting hang, not knowing what is true. For if the word of God do once begin to shine, “Then farewell all, I shalbe faine my kingdome to resigne. “But if you will agrce and follow mine aduise, “We shall cut off this sowen word, as fast as it shall rise. “And first we must giue out some vile and leud report “Of such as doo professe the truth, and such as doo resort “Vnto their Sermons: so this waie it will be best, “To make the King and manie more their dealings to detest. “And when as they shall meete in Church to serue the Lord, “VVee'l saie they do defile th?selues, to make th? more abhord. And when in fields they ioine their ioifull Psalmes to sing,” VVee must giue out that they conspire which waie to kill the King.” So to their filed talke the King will giue no heed,” But giue vs leaue, and ioyne with vs against them to proceede.” And manie that shall heare this smooth inuented lie,” VVil neuer seek the truth: but then condemne them by &amp; by.” So shall we haue our will, so shall we set a staie” For those that seek to know the truth to stop th? in their waie.” And that we maie the more their dealings quite deface,” I must deuise to point you all your office and your place:” For some must Captaines be to lie in waite for blood,” And burne them in their temples all, to doo your master good” And such must alwaies be abroad to range the coasts,” In euerie place to lie in waite, and meete them at their hoasts.” And some must staie at home to lie in Princes eare,” That of these men within his sight not one may dare appeare.” If force will not preuaile, if Nobles take their part,” By flattrie then some must attempt these Nobles to subuart. This said it was agreed, the Counsaile cried, Amen. And euerie one to plaie his part did giue his promise then. O poore vnhappie place, ô France how art thou led, Thou gleanst the sap of deadlie food in steed of liuelie bread. The Mother Queene as cheefe dooth promise to begin, By treason ioynd with flatterie to trap them in her ginne. And he that was ordaind to watch the Princes hall, VVas bloudie Lewes of Loraine towne that filthie Cardinall. And they that tooke in hand false rumors for to sowe, VVere Priests, &amp; friers, with deuice Gods truth to ouerthrow. The Captaines that were glad to take this cause in hand, The blinded Guises were, which swore to lead this bloudy b?d. Now let vs see the end, how these their parts doo plaie; And marke where all things fal not out as we haue heard them saie. The first outrage and horrible murder of the the Godlie, called The winning of Saint Iames his Streete. Now at this verie time when Philip King of Spaine In the raigne of Henrie the second, Anno 1557. Came to Sanquintines, garded with a great and mightie traine: The Constable of France to meete him made some hast, VVhose power was vanquisht there, and he fell Philip King of Spaine hauing married Marie Queene of Englande, gaue the Constable of Fr?ce a great ouerthrow, which afterward was called the ouerthrow of Laurence Day. prisoner at the last. The faithfull which beheld great danger nigh at hand, VVhich God did threat? now to fal, on th?, their prince, &amp; l?d. VVith one consent they meete, to God they crie and The godlie in danger fall to praier, as their best refuge. praie: VVhich is the onlie meanes for sin Gods heauie wrath to stay. But once aboue the rest, as in S. Iames his streete In Paris towne they did agree great numbers for to meete, To pray vnto the Lord to quench this flaming fire, They might receiue his Sacraments, &amp; eke his word to heare; The wicked cannot abide anie good exercise. The spies that laie in waite such vantage for to get, Intumult armde the common sort their houses to beset. VVhose follie thus abusde, which furie did incense, VVith weapons rann, as if these men had done some great offence. The faithfull closed thus, no waie there was to flie, The The vielent and mad rage of Sathan against the word. rage and tumult was so great, they yeelded all to die. To God they did commend their bodies and their life, And with their h?ble sutes assaid, to swage their raging strife. But all could not preuaile, their words could not be heard, For furie to their iust excuse did giue but small regard, But God that neuer failes his seruants at their neede, By stretching out his helping hand, did stand th? now in steed. For as to Peter once in prison closelie pent, A certain gate in this assault by the providence of God was wonderfullie opened, for the sauegard of manie, when the houses were on euerie side beset. To lose his lockes and set him free an Angel there was sent; So God now made a waie a passage strange to giue, By opening of a mightie dore the weaker to releeue. By which the fainter sort without all danger fled, The greater sort were taken then, and straight to prison led. Among which godlie troope that did their bodies yeeld, Were women of great parentage which were with shame reuilde (Of them whom furie fed) to prison as they went, Yet for all this these noble mindes their deedes did not repent. Murder with Sathans Misters, findeth more frendship th? the truth. And that which was the worst, in prison where they were, The theeues and bloodie murtherers did find more fauor ther. For they that death deserude were taken from their clinke, And in their colde &amp; vglie pits which breathd a deadly stinke These men were thrust &amp; bound, &amp; kept with watch &amp; ward, That al accesse of worldly joy from them might quite be bard. Yet now because they had not roome inough for all, In diuers wardes alone to pen, these captiues thus in thrall; Great numbers they were faine together for to place, To comfort them God did deuise to bring it so to passe. The exercise of the godlie. The prisons now did ring with Psalmes and ioifull songs, They praied god wh? he thoght best to ease th? of these wr?gs Commandement was giu? by the King, that some meet men should be chosen to consider the causes of these captiues. When this was noisde abroad and some were thither sent To know the cause: then this was found the sum of their int?t, The cause of this great tumult. At first when they did meete, a lecture there was red In vulgar tongue out of Gods book, wherby their soules were fed. Then did the preacher show, &amp; there he did recite The vse of that most sacred feast whereof S. Paule did write, Vnto the Corinthes once: In which he shewed plaine The vse and abuse of the same, to comfort or to paine. When this was done, againe they fell vpon their knees, And for the King &amp; C?mons all they praied with watrie eies: That God would yet withhold his iust reuenging hand, And blesse with perfect truth &amp; peace, their King, &amp; eke their land. Then did they all receiue Communion bread and wine To staie their faith in Christ his death, where of this a signe. Now this was all the hurt which they did then procure, For which this raging tumult rose, &amp; they these paines indure. Sathans wickedpolicie, by his ministers to deface the truth with fained lies. But marke the creeping craft of Sathan in this case, How he by false report doth seeke the truth for to deface. His seruants now he sends, and bids them ride in post, These new inuented lies to spread abroad in euerie Coast. The first lie that Sathan spreadeth against the godlie. First how the Lutherans, (so Sathan did them name) Great wickednes did put in vse in places where they came. And how that in the night when other were at sleape, In darknesse where no candles were, great numbers on a heap Of men and women both together did resort To match themselues; for to fulfill a stinking filthie sport. And how these godlie men all sitting in a round, Vp? the tables where they sate, great dainties there were fo?d, As wine, and bellie cheere, and each with others wife, In these their priuie Bacchus feasts did lead a filthie life. And how among the rest to worke their wicked will, Their vsage was (ô shamelesse lie!) their infants for to kill. These godlie men (saie they) that seeme to shine so cleere, Now vnder show of godlie life most filthie doo appeere. The diuels ambassadors. The Monkes as Legates leaud of Plutoes bloodie minde, Do sweate &amp; fome to blaze abroad this stinking hellish wind. As men that were most fit to spread this lying fame, Which in their liues as dooth appeare do dailie vse the same. But they in open place these matters so dilate, That in the mindes of blinded fooles, they raise a deadlie hate Against these seelie soules, which neuer meant this ill, That eke the common sort did long these godlie men to kill. And not the common sort are now deceiud alone, But this assailes the Noble men, and strikes the Princes throne. Princes are many times abused by lying Parasites. Which lie no sooner came before the Princes face, But stood in hope by Sathans meanes, to finde assured grace. Whose minde by light beleefe in furie so was bent, The chiefe angels of Sathan which fight against Michael our Christ, are the wicked Princes &amp; potentates of the world, Reuel. 12.7. That to destroy these hurtles men he plants his whole intent. So now he giues in charge to haue their dealings tride, And chosen men he did appoint the same for to decide. These men in office put, no time could idle spend, But hard against these seely sheepe their woluish wits do bend. This poore afflicted flocke that now in prison laie, In godlie ioy, but worldlie greefe did passe the time away. They that of the Lord haue receiued greater portion of knowledge and faith, are bo?d to comfort the weaker. And they that were in faith more stronger than the rest, To c?fort those that were but weak, their will was euer prest. And those that were at large did trudge from place to place, To ease the outward greefe of such as saw this heauie case. Declaring by the word that this came not by chance: But God was he for some intent which lead this woful dance. The comfortable speeches of the godlie one tewards another. Perchance to shew his will, perchance to trie their faith, Perchance to plant his hidden truth by their most happy death: Perchance to be a meanes their foes for to confound, As once amids the flouds he strake proud Pharao to the gro?d. Perchance amidst our mirth, our God we did forget:” And youthly bent, to vain delights perchance our mind did set” So God in mercie now to call'vs home againe,” And see our selues: hath thought it good to let vs feele some paine.” Patience a notable to ken of Gods election, and loue. Yet still amids the flame let this be all our rest, That all things done to Gods elect are alwaies for the best. Thus did they still remaine; to God they did commend Fasting and praier the onelie, best weap?s of the godlie in aduersitie. Themselues, their case, content to beare what euer God should send. And now with solemne fasts &amp; praier put in vre, And eke by writing they assaic, some fauor to procure. The King they doo request that truth might trie their deedes, The godly captiues write to the King. That Iustice cicle might deuide the Roses from the weedes; That fickle flying tales from credit might be bard, “Till that by iust and equall proofe both parties haue ben heard. “And if it were his will that they might now dispute, “They doubted not by written word the Sorbons to confute. Sathan alwaie readie at a pinch. Yet this could not preuaile for all this good deuice: For some stood by, that told the king, their writings al were lies The godlie greeued thus, as reason did them binde, By other letters trie to change the Kings affected minde. The earnest letters the sec?d time written to the king, by the innocent captiues. In which they warne his Grace to looke vnto himselfe, Not to preferre before his God this wicked worldlie pelfe. And therewithall to view the state of that his Land, How all things prospered well which he did take in band, “So long as to the truth he bent a willing eare, This K. Henry the 2.was once an enimie to the Pope, and seemed to fauor the Gospel. And to the godlie Christian flocke a faithfull heart did beare. But since he brake his faith he gaue the Germaine band, And to that greasie Priest of Rome againe did giue his hand, How all things since haue gone a cleane contrarie waie, “And nothing prospered well sith he the truth did so betraie. “And now ô Prince (quoth they) except thou do repent, “Assure thy selfe to plague this sinne the Lord is fullie bent, “And he that now hath lent to thee this happie Raigne, “Will for thy sinne most surelie turne thy pleasure into paine. “The Constable of France a looking glasse may be, “In wh? the end of swelling pride your Grace may plainly see. “Who proudlie swearing said, If he returned sound, “He would not cease till he had quasht Geneua to the ground. God for his mercie manie times giueth Tyrants little power. But God that sits aboue his follie did deride, And at Sanquintines did confound his purpose and his pride. So he that latelie swore against the Lord to fight, Was taken captiue by the foe, his armie put to flight. “Of wicked wilfull wits this is the wofull end, “When fancie rulde by witles will, their strength will striue to bend “Against the Lord. But now ô King we do not care; “For whatsoeuer God shall send we willing are to beare. The bloud of the Martirs it the seede of the Church. But yet of this be sure, the blood that thou doost wring From vs vniustlie, is the seed whereby the Church doth spring. And though our bodies be consumed in the flame, Truth, the true Phœnix Yet of our ashes God will raise that shall defend the same. To shade the shining light, no wit can well preuaile: So vaine, to striue to staie the truth which God doth nowe reueale. Thus while the Godlie worke their causes to defend, The wicked impes of Sathan lurke to bring them to their end. But one aboue the rest their death did dailie craue, Munerius that bloodie wretch, that false and periurde knaue. Who hauing now of late by falshood crackt his fame, Such are worthie men to be the diuels ch?pions. Did hope by hate of Gods elect againe to winne the same. And hauing now attaind the Princes bill assignd, In Paris towne before the States he shewes the Princes minde: Which was, that presentlie (all businesse set aside) The King would haue the prisners calde, their dealings to be tride. And that they should proceed to judge, &amp; eke beleue According to the euidence Munerius then should geue. These letters being read, the Senate all agree He that hath bin once false forsworn is not to bee receiued a witnes in anie matter. Not to receiue Munerius, nor anie thing that he Should laie against the life of those that faithfull were, For that himselfe had falst his faith, which latelie did forswere. And yet they did proclaime, that they would not refuse If anie other would step forth the faithfull to accuse. So, willing to performe the Kings intended minde, Their cankred mallice plant the plot to haue the daie assignde, When these afflicted soules from prison to their dome, Before the whelpes of Pilates brood to iudgement now should come. The daie is come, and they that were before ordaind To shew the glorie of the Lord, could not be now constraind The wicked make quicke dispatch in c?demning the godlie. By all their braue deuice the truth for to denie: But for the same amidst the flame they willing were to die. The bloodie sentence past, (which was the Kings desire) The valiant troope of godlie men were drawne vnto the fire, And chained to their stakes all naked as they stood: Vnto the Lord their crie was heard from out amids the wood. Butto the wicked troope which longd to see that daie, They knowing sure their causes good, this or the like did say. The triumph of the godlie ouer their enemies, euen in the midst of the fire. Now shall you haue your will, now shall you do your worst: Now shal ye haue our guiltles blood, for which ye l?g did thirst. We feare not of this death, we know that al must die, Yea happie are those sillie soules wh? thus the Lord doth trie. O welcome ioifull daie, ô welcome happie paine; Iam.1.2. “A crowne immortall with this flesh, we shall receiue againe. Iob.5.17. “Now hath the Lord here brought, and placte vs in this death, “Not for because he hates his truth, but for to trie our faith. 2.Cro.32.31 “The counsell of the Lord hath sent what we receaue, Act.4.28 Ephes.I.II. “And you to vs shal doo no more than God shall giue you leaue. Phil.I.28. “And you that are our foes, beware the deadlie signe, “Which showes you none of Gods elect; while thus ye doo repine “Against his knowen truth: for which we vndertake “To spend our blood in his defence, and suffer for his sake. Genes.4.10. “The blood of Abel cride for vengeance to the Lord, “Which fell on Cain &amp; al his seed, (wh? men &amp; earth abhord) “From which the Lord defend both you, and eke our land: “O Lord reuenge not this our wrong, but stay thy furious hand; “And giue them yet some space for to repent this thing; Act.7.60. “And for our death we doo forgiue both them &amp; eke our King. “Whose life the Lord preserue in health and perfect peace, “And gr?t that vnder him the truth may haue some ioiful ease. “And though you haue some power this flesh for to destroy, “Yet cannot vs your rage deuide from Christs immortal ioy. “And though our breakfast seeme to flesh and blood some paine, “Yet shall we sup with Iesus Christ, and ease receaue againe. “Into thy blessed hands, ô Lord our soules receaue: For of this earth and earthlie trash ô Lord we take our leaue.” Thus on the Lord they cride, which was their onelie trust,” Till that the flame had staid their voice, &amp; bodie burnt to dust. Now we that doo remaine our parts are yet to plaie, But when ô Lord our time shall come, grant vs like happy daie. And when our triall drawes, no matter where nor when, That God will giue like constant faith; let vs crie all Amen.The judgments of the Lord shewed vpon these bloodie persecuters in this first outrage, by the example of manie the like out of the Scriptures. Bvt let vs heere behold Gods judgements just and true, Which neuer faile to follow them, which doo his truth pursue. Genes.4.15. As wicked Caine did long poore Abels blood to haue, So did the Lord marke him to be a vile and vagrant slaue. Genes.27.43. When Esau did intend his brother for to kill, The Lord did blesse good Iacob so, he could not haue his will. Exod 14.27. When Phar ao followed fast Gods people to haue slaine, Amiddes the flouds then iustlie fell both he and all his traine. Nomb.12.20. As Miriam grudgde against the truth which she did know, So did her fault soone finde her out a leaper white as snow. Nomb.16.33. When Korath and his mates good Moses did depraue, The earth did gape, and they went all aliue into the graue. Exod 17.8. Deut.25.17. And whil'st at Bephidim Gods people did remaine, The Amalecks of Esaus brood poore Iacob would haue slaine. But God did not forget this foule and filthie thing, 1.Sam.15.33. Wisdom.11.3. Which after smote with fatall sword, both them and eke their King. 1.Sam.19.10. Though Saul did persecute Gods chosen Prophet long, Yet did the Lord at length reuenge poore Dauid &amp; his wrong: 1 Sam.31.4. For now the hand that itcht this Dauids blood to spill, Was it that framde the deadlie blade his master for to kill. Sam.25.10. That Nabal which refusde his helpe to Dauid send, vers.38. Was striken so, that there he made a short and wofull end. 2.Sam.16.5. And Shimei that reuilde King Dauid to his face, 1. King.46.1. It was not long but that he died in poore and wofull case. 2.Sam.17.1. And as Achitophel great mischiefe did intend, So did the Lord from traitors all his chosen still defend: Whose counsell being quasht (for so the Lord assignde, Vers.23. He got him home &amp; hangd himselfe to ease his careful minde. 1.King.13.4. So Ieroboam felt Gods iudgements sharpe and colde, Wh? he thrust out his wicked hand his Prophet for to hold. 1.King.19.3. So Iezabel which did Elias once pursue, VVhen Iehu came to Iezrael, her faithfull seruant threw 2.King.30. Her carcasse headlong downe from window high to streate, VVhere tr?pled down the greedy dogs her cursed flesh did eat. Euse.eccl.hist. 2.booke.7. chapter. Gainst Christ the Pilate which wrong iudgement erst did giue, Did kill himselfe, as one that was not worthie for to liue. Ibid.cap.9. And when against the truth proud Herodes hand was bent, He killed Iames, and Peter was in prison closelie pent: Acts.11.23. The Angel of the Lord of pride did show the price, That in a while his cursed corpes was eaten all with lice. Matth. 26.47. As Iudas was content his master to betraie, Acts. 1. 18. So guiltie conscience did consent to worke his owne decaie. Maxentius, Iulianus, Valens, being persecutors of the faithfull, had the like end. Like as in former age to rebels stout and strong, Gods iustice hath been plainlie seene in lieu of cursed wrong: So all this faithlesse troope, which leudlie did conspire This murder in S.Iames his streete, haue likewise felt his ire. Munerius put to open shame and banished his countries. For first the Prætor, which Munerius had to name, For iust desert, in publike view receiued open shame. And yet besides all this, they straightlie did proclaime, That he should voide his natiue soyle, &amp; not returne againe. But whil'st he was in holde his conscience did confesse, This plague was iust; for that he sought Gods chosen to oppres A A Iudge that gaue sentence, was strik? with sodaine death. Iudge that sentence gaue against his knowen faith, An angel strake him from the Lord with sharp &amp; sodain death. Another Iudge that was now sicke and like to die, Cride out; O the dedlie sting of a guiltie conscience. I see my iudgement iust, for that vile caitiffe I” By mallice haue been faine Gods people for to kill:” Who praie, and liue most godlie bent according to his will.” Two Two others cruell in the former slaughter, died sodainlie in the sight of all m?.others being cheefe in murder that was past, By sodaine death in view of all like vengeance now doo tast. And other Other two as they returned from the murder, fell at contention, and at last were slaine one of an other. two which now of blood had dronke their fill, As they came from this murther, they did one the other kill. Now let vs learne by this, Gods truth for to imbrace, That we feele not by due desart his anger in like case. The notable, famous, and constant Martirdome of Annas Burgeus, which, being one of the Kings Counsell, was burnt for the Gospel of Iesus Christ. The second example of the French crueltie. About this verie time by force of sodaine iarre, Betweene the Kings of Spaine and France, was likelie to be warre. Luk.23.12. But Herode to agree with Pilate was content, And for to murder Iesus Christ they both doo ioyne consent. So now there was a league, where both did giue their word To roote and rase Gods sowen truth, by fagot, fire and sword. The The graffe that greeued Sathan, was the Truth, which now in France increased dailie: which was the cause of this present Persecution. graffe that Sathan greeues did yet begin to spring, The tree of life some ioyfull frute as now did seeme to bring. Whose bud enameld greene, and blossome sweete to see, Inraged Sathans fierie moode with mallice; so that he In furie headlong runnes: he frets, he fumes, he raues, And of the King some speedie helpe in present danger craues. The speaches of the diuell to K. Henrie the second. “The fate that files my fall, ô King saith he, is this; “Your Senate fauours truth too much, your Iudges too remisse: “They are not sharpe inough to shred appearing ill, “They suffer impes of Luthers sect too much to haue their will. The The King appointed an assemblie to be made, to consider of the Edict of Caflellobrian. King not well content, prouideth out of hand Some new assemblie to be had, to haue this matter scand. The Senate being set, the Kings Attorney first The speaches of the K.Attornie to the Assemblie. “Doth grauely shew vnto them al; how that the K.doth thirst “To haue them all agree in matters touching faith, “And to consent that Luthers brood should all be put to death: “For that some strife of late there was betweene them found, “C?cerning this. But to their shames this iarring would redo?d. “Because for Heretikes some first would haue them tride, “And some would haue them banished, &amp; some would haue th? fride. “And therefore wisheth all with him to giue consent, “That death might end this strife, which thing the king hath alwaie ment. This was a This was Sathans subtiltie to bewray such of the Iudges, as were susoected for Religion: which after was the cause of Annas Bur gaus death. subtill slight the godlie to betray; That such as spake against the same, their c?science should bewray. The speach as of the god lie against the Papistes crueltie. But yet am?g the rest some freely spake their minde; That reason for so cruell act as yet they could not finde. “The King would haue (saie they) but Heretikes to die: “And what are they but such as dare the Scriptures to denie? “If anie such be found, let them be wroong to death; “Because the word is all our staie, and Author of our faith. “But if for Heretikes the godlie should be slaine, “God would reuenge their blood; and we by this should reap no gain. “And those which you do think the truth do now denie, “Their reasons, deeds &amp; faith we see, wherein they stoutlie die. Acts.5.32. Therefore if from the Lord this counsell doo proceede,” To striue against the same, it were a vaine and sinfull deede.” Thus did the better sort their godlie thoughts bewraie; Which being crost with co?ter cranks, was cause of their decaie. For Satan fearing least their sentence would preuaile, Sent two in post vnto the King these dealings to reueale. Counsellors of the same Senate. The limbes of Pluto which this bloodie message went, Egidius and Minardus were fit hounds for such a sent. Who comming to the King most falselie did declare, The Orati? of the wicked Counsellors to the K.coloured with lies, the more to moue him to wrath. That in the Senate such were found which stoutly now did dare ” Religion to deride, and speeches let to fall” That for his Lawes and Edictes past they made no count at al.” Now therefore is the time your Grace must looke about,” That springing showes of future ill your wisedome may roote out.” For if you should permit these rebels thus to thriue,” Great perill is least of your crowne your Grace they would depriue.” The King inflamed thus, doth make no long delaie, But to the Senate where they sate he takes his readie waie. Where placed in his throne, and hauing pausde a while, Thus spake in presence of them all in high and princelie stile. The speach of K Henry the second vnto the Senate. The Lord that lendeth all and weeldes the golden spheare” Hath sent vs now a wished peace, deuoid of forreine feare.” Which peace is aye confirmde by bande of solemne vowe;” And plighted faith of solemn match, which none can disalow.” Yet one thing there remaines to perfect this my State,” That in Religion one consent might banish all debate.” Which is the onelie cause that moues my pensiue heart” In this your meeting for to ioyne, and beare a carefull part.” This is therefore in few our craue and eke request;” That euerie man doo shew his minde as he shall thinke it best.” Here some that had before in words been verie rife, Began to staie; and doubted much the danger of their life. Yet there were some which now a noble coutage take, Annas Burgeus as the chiefe this doubtfull silence brake. The notable Oration of Annas Burgaus, deliuered before the King in the senat house. “Who lifting vp his hands, in heart began to praie, “With thankes to God that he did liue to see that happie daie “Wherein the Lord had wrought such care within his grace, “That he would b?d his willing eare to iudge so weightie case. “The cause saith he is Christs which we haue now in hand, “For which the Lord wil surely blesse both you &amp; eke your lad. “This is the blessed He setteth out the power &amp; vertue of the word of god, and what a blessing it bringeth to them that ioyfullie receiue it. 2.

The King in fierie heate Scant able to forbeare so long; spake thus from out his seate. The Kinges answere Vn to Burgeus, wheresn he shewes his deadlie anger and mallice against the Truth.

But yet such rankor rose and boiled in his breast, That presentlie he gaue in charge that there they should arrest Annas Burgeus as the chiefe, and him to prison bring: Who was, he thoght the only root by wh? the rest did spring Burgeus sent to Prison. When this was said, and that the King had so decreed, Mongomerie Captaine of the gard was he that did the deede. Now good Burgeus is in linkes and irons fast, Which sodaine fall did sore appall, &amp; make the rest agast. The King vnwilling was to haue the cause deferd: The Bishop of Paris &amp; Democheris. But time and Iudges were assignde to haue the matter heard. But such appointed were to iudge this weightie case, Which hated him, and sought the truth by falshood to deface. Which partiall minded men Burgæus did refuse; And to the Senate did recount their olde and ancient vse: Which was, if anie one of them did chance to slide; The order was by all the rest his dealings should be tride. Which they no sooner gaue the King to vnderstand; But letters came, which did command him answere out of h?d. The letters read, he said; my Prince I will obaie: But otherwise you had not heard a word of me this daie. Then questions were proposde of Saints, and Popish Masse, Of Purgatorie, and such trash as then in credit was. Whereof he spake his minde, and freelie did protest; That all these leaud and filthie toyes in heart he did detest. Burgæus protestation concerning Poperie, &amp; Popish ceremonies. I serue (said he) no Saint, but Christ my onelie staie;” I will not yeeld to anie man his honor to betraie.” He is the Sacrifice by death that made me free;” He is the onelie Paschall Lambe that shed his blood for me;” He is the onelie Christ our onelie Purgatorie. Heb. 1.3. heate by faith that purgeth sinne” In them that now beleeue, or those that heretofore haue bin.” Therefore I doo defie your popish trifles all,” And thanke the God that giues me grace to come whe? he doth call.” Which answere being made, to sentence they proceede; Who was condemned then: for that the King had so decreed. The sentence being read, he had but one refudge; He did appeale to Burgæus appealed often from this vniust Sentence: but seeing his appealations could not bee admitted, he lastlie appealed to Iesus Christ. Iesus Christ, as his supernall Iudge. And being sent againe to place from whence he came, He was content for Christ to beare this grief, rebuke &amp; shame, But Sathan did reioyce his matters framde so well; Whose bloodie minde had cast the plot Christ Iesus to expel. Great troubles did he stirre, and mischife still deuise To shred the truth in euerie place so fast as it should rise. And though Burgæus did from sentence oft appeale; Yet Sathan seeking for his blood this thing could not preuaile. So now from out againe the prison he was brought, And then For Burgæus had in his Youth receaued certaine Popish Orders. disgraded solemnly, which thing the Bishop sought. Which being done, he gaue a sweete and smiling cheare, And being not dismaide at all, he said deuoide of feare. The speaches of Burgæus at his disgrading. “I thanke my God that lent me life to see this daie, “Wherein these badges of the Beast are taken cleane awaie; “That Antichrist hencefoorth in me maie claime no part; “Whose whorish art and Romish raggs I hate with al my hart. “This Popish sinfull oyle I gladlie here doo leaue; “For this, of God a glorious crowne I know I shall receaue. “If you could see the waie that leadeth vnto life; “If you could know the perfect truth, th? ended wer this strife. “But yet you are too dull, your eies are yet too blinde; “Fare well therefore you Romish ragges, which here I leaue behind. “For theie (my God) when I before thee shall appeare; “Giue me (ô Lord) a quiet heart, a conscience voide of feare. “So shall I stoutlie stand and still professe thy name; “So shall my foes be turned backe, and quite be put to shame; “So shall I gladlie goe vnto that wished place; “And in defence of this thy truth, my stake I shall imbrace. “Now Sathan doo thy worst, I will appeale no more, “The truth (I know) which I professe is it that gals thy sore. “Now let me know (I pray) my sentence and my doome; “My blood it is which you do seeke, now let my sentence come. Which being said, indeed, they did prouide againe The final sentence to pronounce, which should for aie remain: Which then in solemne wise with words demure and graue, By Pilates brother was pronounst, who once like sent?ce gaue. The sentence of death against Annas Burgeus pronounced by the B. of Paris, the 20.of December 1559. Burgæus, I pronounce the sentence of thy death, For that thou like an Heretike hast slidden from our faith. And tied to a stake, there still remaine thou must Till that thy flesh by fierie flakes be all consumde to dust. Which when Burgæus heard he did no white repine: But cheerefullie for Christ he said, my life I will resigne. To The speaches and behauour of Burgeus at the receauing of his sentence. God he lifted vp his hands with thankfull hart That he was worthy made, for Christ to feele this ioiful smart. And meeklie kneeling downe with holie Stephen did Burgeus praieth for his persecutors &amp; forgiueth th?. praie For them that had most wrongfully condemned him that day: That God in mercie would his Iudges all forgiue, And not to laie vnto their charge the sin that might th? grieue. So he forgaue them all, though they in fierie moode, For seeking Christ, had long deuisde to shed his guiltles blood. But heere we may not passe, what counsell sage and graue, And to the Senate what he said, and what aduice he gaue. As thus. The Pathet call speaches of Burgæus to the Senate of Paris at his condemnation. Are Plutoes Nymphes instald within your brest?” Doth dire Megara now posses the place where Christ shuld rest.” Hath Sathan (which deceite and lies hath vsed long)” Inforced you against the truth and Christ to practise wrong?” And are you gone so farre, that you can be content” For loue ye beare to Sathans lies, to kill the innocent.” VVhat, is there not a God that searcheth euerie vaine?” And will he not reuenge the blood of Abel spilt by Cain?” And can you now accompt the truth to be a lie?” And can you think within your hart that Christ can go awrie?” And dare you to blaspheme that great and sacred name?” And feare you not by fained glose his Gospell to defame?” And will you be so bold to saie that we doo straie,” Vvhich haue for vs the written word,&amp; Christ our only way?” Vve are the sonnes of God whom thus you doo pursue,” If you persist, you shall to soone perceiue it to be true.” Vve know that he doth liue, his voice doth shew his loue:” If you refuse his profered word, your sinnes shall you reproue.” By him we can doo all; If he doo hide his face” Vve maie not hope without his help for mercie, loue, or grace.” Vvhat boldnesse is it then for ashes, filth, and claie,” By fond attempt for to resist the thing that he shall saie?” “And can you be content that Christ for to depraue; “Whose wounds haue washt our sinnes, whose mercie doth vs saue? “Shall we denie our King, our Prince, our ioy, our might? “Shall we consent to do him wrong, that doth defend our right? “He is our princelie Guide, our Captaine, and our staie; “He wakes for vs when we do sleepe, &amp; keepes vs from decay. “Then heare, what shall we doo? Shall feare make vs to flie? “Shall anie earthlie force make vs our Captaine to denie? “Shall we vnconstant be our duetie to forgoe? “Shall we repaie such curtesie to him that loude vs so? “No, no, we are but earth, to earth we must returne; “O happie earth, if (earth) for Christ thou be content to burne. “Our time is heere but short, our deadlie foe but weake; “The Lord is able when he list his mallice for to breake. “But what would Sathan haue? what doth this flesh require? “But onelie this; that from our God and truth we should retire. “If anie doo blaspheme, we must them not controll: “If anie wilie wantons sinne, we must their deedes extoll. “If truth be troden downe: If we will liue at ease, “We must be then with heauy hearts c?tent to hold our peace. “Which sith we doo refuse, you runne with open crie; “Loe these are wicked Rebels, which most worthie are to die. “And are we Rebels then? how will you prooue this thing? “Yes sir; you doo refuse, with vs to Baal your offrings bring. “O mercie now good Lord! what wicked times are these? “How long shal these vngodlie men keep these vngodlie waies? “How long wilt thou forbeare to bridle this their lust? “And when shall all their fleshlie pride be raked in the dust? “Why doost thou winke so long? whie dost thou so delaie? “Why dost thou not cut off those Impes, that stir this fierie fray? “But if it be thy will that they should longer raigne: “And if thou thinke it best for vs that they should yet remaine: “Restraine them yet (good Lord) least they doo go too farre; For they against thy godlie Saints intend a cruell warre.” And till thy pleasure be for to destroie them quite;” Withhold their cruell iawes (ô Lord) with thy most mightie Bitt.” Haue mercie still on vs (ô louing Father deere;” Maintaine vs in defending thee, from danger, fals and feare.” And make them Lord to know, that they those Rebels are:” That fr? the simple (which do seek) the light &amp; truth debarre.” And while that I haue breath I will declare the same;” That Sathan may not with his lies thy blessed truth defame.” Is this a Rebels part when men to Princes giue” Their bodies, goods, and al things els without repine &amp; griefe?” Is this a traitors pranke vnto the Lord to praie;” That he will keepe both Prince &amp; Land from troble &amp; decaie:” And that he will vouchsafe to take from them the myste” Which keeps th? from the knowledge of their sauior &amp; their Christ?” Or rather is not this a most rebellious part;” To seeke by all rebellious meanes Gods glorie to subuart?” To giue the honor due vnto the Lord alone,” To Saints that you haue made: or els, to senseles stock &amp; stone?” To vse blasphemous oathes; to suffer common stewes;” To iustifie your owne deuice; and such like filthie vse?” Your Conscience shall be iudge, to you I doo appeale:” Hath God deliuered you the sword against his truth to deale?” If not, beware betime, and marke what I shall saie;” This mallice which you beare to Christ will be your own decaie.” And what, are you so blinde, that you perceaue not this;” How in this sentence you pronounce, that you are none of his?” Recount within your selues and call to minde at large,” Where anie sinne or wickednesse be laid vnto our charge.” If not; then iudge againe, and tell me if you can:” VVhich is the best; to serue the Lord, or follow sinfull man?” Now if you loue your goods, your credite, and your life;” If you preferre before your God your houshold, child, or wife:” “Then know you are not fit with Christ to haue a part; “But feare, least for your sinne in hell you finde a lasting smart? “But if you doo not feare the iudgements of the Lord: “Yet know, your deeds in forreine lands to str?gers are abhord. “How manie sinfull actes, and deedes deuoyd of wit, “That ruddie purpled Phalaris hath made you to commit? “Who for his cursed gaine hath set about the King, “Such as wil Prince and Commons all to deadlie ruine bring. “And when that Beast doth bid, you runne at euerie call; “You racke &amp; teare Gods knowen truth, not caring what befall. “To please him, you doo yeeld the godlie to torment “With such outrage, as you are forc't the same for to lament. “But what; me thinkes I see the teares tril downe your cheeke? “What, haue I spoken that which now your conscience doth mislike? “Well, then beware betime, for yet the time is wel; “But if you shun this profered grace, beware the paines of hell. “Your conscience must be knowen, your deeds must al appeere; “Then call for grace, and so repent while yet you tarrie heere. “But if you quake in iest as Felix did before, “And if you feare without remorse your paine wilbe the more. “You see how they reioice whom you condemne to die; “No terror can assaile the heart on Christ that doth relie. “We waie not all your force, your mallice, and your strife; “We doo accompt this cruell death to vs a happie life. “Why should it grieue my heart for Christ to hang or burne; “For little paine, I know the Lord great pleasure will returne. “But they vnhappie are, and cursed from aboue, “Which from th?selues &amp; others seek the truth for to remoue. “But this I know from Christ nothing shall me depart, “And from assured hope in him none shall remoue my heart. “For though you teare my flesh, and heart to pouder grinde; “Yet this shall neuer so preuaile, as once to change my minde. “And when that you haue done the worst you can deuise; Vve know that in the latter day with Christ we shall arise.” This death therefore to vs we recken little paine:” For we beleeue assuredlie that we shall liue againe.” Now hap what maie befall, to hang, to burne, to frie” I haue professed Christ: and so, a Christian I will die.” Vvhy therefore doo we staie? Come hangman doo thy part;” Thy fact in this, loe heere I doo forgiue with all my heart.” And this he did repeate, Come hangman doo the deed;” Till that the stoutest heart that heard, for griefe began to bleed.” Put out, put out (said he) your franticke fierie brands;” That Christ may onlie rule &amp; reign, set to your helping hands.” Repent your wicked thoughts forsake your filthie waies:” And if you hope to haue release, then vse no more delaies.” But why doo I so long draw this forsaken breath?” Farewell my mates; for now behold, I goe vnto my death.” Thus hauing said his minde, and readie to depart; The hangman takes, and ties his hands, and laies him on a cart. In which he was conuaid vnto a place fast by; Where chained to a stake, it was ordainde that he should die. The streetes of Paris towne were kept with watch and ward, There went with him of armed m? foure h?dred for his gard. The waies on euerie side that lead vnto the place Were stopped vp, as if they had foreseen some doubtful case. And where we plainlie see these tyrants all afraid; The godlie man for all this broile was not a whit dismaid. For when he was vnbound, there was in him no feare: He put his clothing off himselfe with bold and constant chear. Where standing naked then and stript vnto his skin, With cheerefull voyce he did at last this heauie speach begin. Burgæus vseth but this short speach to the People, for so he had promised before: where vpon the vse of his tongue was permitted vnto him, which to others was denied. The cause why I am come (good people) to this death: Is not for murder, theft, or wrong; But for a liuelie faith. Which said, he held his peace: and kneeling on the ground, VVith sighes he praid, til to the stake by hangm? he was bo?d, VVhere he did oft repeate; The last words of Annas Burgeus being tied to the stake. O Lord forsake not me, Least by the frailenesse of my flesh I hap to slide from thee. O Lord receaue my soule into thy blessed rest, Giue me thy strength while I doo liue O Lord I thee request. Thus with a quiet minde, and heart deuoide of strife, For Christ amidst the fierie flame, he yeelded vp his life. Bvt Conclusion of the French pilgrime: with a description of the life and linage of Burgaus. what a ioy is this to vs that doo remaine, That God dooth giue to his elect such strength to conquere paine. This is the godlie end that blessed man did make, VVhom life &amp; honor could not b?d his Christ for to forsake. He liude with good report, his death deserueth fame, And he hath left vnto his foes a leaud and filthie shame. A rare and passing signe no doubt the Lord did giue, To see that noble constancie in him while he did liue. VVhose constant death in France and blood did sow the seede VVherby the church did much increase, &amp; godly yet do feed. He came of honest house, in learning spent his youth, And beeing plac'te in high degree he sought to learn the truth. VVhereof when he had felt the sweete and pleasant tast, He ioinde himselfe vnto the Church, &amp; sticks to them at last. VVell, he is gone before; and we that are behinde: Lord grant to vs in Iesus Christ like faith and constant minde. Amen. The iudgements of the Lord which fell vpon King Henrie the second after he had caused Burgæus to be imprisoned Anno 1589. Dilated by the examples of Ahab, Amaziah, and Zedechiah, wicked Kings, which vsed the like crueltie against the word. The Lord on Elies sonnes and sinnes, this sentence gaue; They that doo loue and honor me, great honor still shall haue: 1.Sam.2.30. But they that doo despise my word, my law, and will; They shall be sure of euerie man to be abhored still. Which sentence of the Lord for euer shall be true: As by examples we may see of such as doo insue; For when as Ahab was in fond and foolish rage To Ramoth Gilead stoutlie bent, vniustlie warres to wage: A Prophet from the Lord did tell him verie plaine, That if this warre he took in hand King Ahab should be slain. But to the prison straight this Prophet then was led; The king gaue charge that he shuld be with bread &amp; water fed, Till he returned safe from Gilead home againe: But what befell? It came to passe the King indeed was slaine. So Amaziah (which by idolls did offend) Vnto the Prophet would not yeeld his willing eare to bend. Cron.25.16. 23. But did with bitter scoffes and scornes reproue the word: For which he was by Iehu spoild, and taken by the sword. So Zedekiah proud from sinne would not returne: Iere.36.23. But Rebel-like, the word of God he did with fire burne. Iere.20.2.&amp; 32.3.&amp; 38.6. And Ieremie by him was oft in prison pent; Because he said, the King and all to Babel should be sent. But let vs see his ende; the King of Babel came, Ieremie 39.5. Who toke him captiue with his men, &amp; put them al to shame. And he that was content Gods Prophet to disgrace, Was forc'te to see the murder of his sonnes before his face; His eies that would not see Gods truth and shining light, The King of Babel put them out as they deserude of right Henrie the second. So Henrie King of France which all his force did bend Against the truth, did from the Lord receaue a fearfull end. For now amidst the ruffe of all their mirth and ioy, When euerie man deuised how the godlie to destroie. The time appointed came, for marriage of the King, Which to the Court &amp; Courtiers did great mirth &amp; pleasure bring. And for the greater pompe of all this princely traine, A solemne Iust the youthlie King by Crier did proclaime: In which he meant to shew his manhood and his might. And being horst with limber speare in armor shining bright, He chose among the rest (the challenge now begun) Mongomerie Captaine of his gard against him for to runne. Which he did oft refuse, and wiselie did withstand, Till that the King the fatall speare put in his Captaines hand. Where charging with their spears, &amp; forcing might &amp; main, A splinter pierst the Princes eie, and ranne vnto his braine. The King with sodaine wound and bleeding much dismaid, Within the next adioyning house to bed he was conuaide. Where plungd with grieuous pain, his conscience did lament The wrong which he had done to those wh? he to prison sent. A guiltie conscience bettraies it selfe. “I greatlie feare (said he) least I haue done some ill “Against Burgæus and the rest, whose blood I sought to spill. But Elimas the witch doth spend his cursed winde, By Elimas is ment the Cardinal of Loraine. From such remorse to keep in thral the Kings afflicted minde: “It is (said he) thy foe, that doth assault thy faith, “In which take heed that thou remain stil constant to thy death. This heauie hap befell (as manie men haue tolde) Nere to the place wherein as then Burgeus was in hold. And manie did obserue that he did kill the King Which was commanded to the Iaile Burgæus for to bring. The King did often brag those eies of his should see Burgæus burnt; but loe the Lord did alter that decree. King Henrie died the 10.of August, anno 1559. For ere Burgæus was vnto the fire led, Mongomeric had those eies of his thrust cleane out of his head. Now here we plainlie see the life, and heauie end Of th? which persecute the truth, which God doth often send. And let vs warning take by this most fearfull fate, For to returne and loath our sinne, before it be too late. Amen. The bloodie marriage, or butcherlie murder of the Admirall of France, and diuers other noble and excellent men, at the marriage of Margaret the Kinges owne sister, vnto Prince Henrie sonne to the Queene of Nauarre, committed the 24. of August in the Citie of Paris Anno 1572. Now haue you heard before, of faggot, fire, and sword Inhaunst by Sathan, for to quell Gods truth and blessed word. But now I must begin such treason to vnfold, As former times for crueltie, And ages new and olde Haue neuer seene the like in Christendome, till now When sacred faith by flatterie, and oath of Princelie vow By treason, did contriue to shed the guiltlesse blood Of th? which now by peace did seek to do their co?trie good. For when the Lord did send his truth into the land, He raised vp some Noble men to take this cause in hand. Among the which, as chiefe and souereigne of the field, There was Prince Henrie of Nauarre, with such as would not yeeld Vnto the Guisian race; the Prince of Condee next; Gasper de Coligni admirall of France. The Admirall, and D'andelot, with others that were vext By bloodie Guises band, who daily did inuent Francis D'andelot his brother captaine of the fonterie. How to oppresse the word of truth, which Christ had thether sent. But when as Sathan saw by words and dealings plaine, That manie Princes were in armes this truth for to maintaine. It galde him to the heart, that where he did deuise To choake the word, that euen there the more it did arise. He summons all his mates these matters to debate, How they might choak this springing seed before it were too late. Where all within a round they come without delaie, To whom this bloody captaine then these words began to say; The seconde oration of the diuell to the Queene Mother of France, the Guises, and the rest of the Papists. “There is a subtill veyne that feedes this cankred sore: “For now the deeper it is launcte it riseth still the more. “Vve see that fire and sword cannot at all preuaile, “Vve see that al our bloody broiles their courage cannot quaile. “Vve see how Noble men their forces dailie bend “To counter crosse our planted plots, this cause for to defend. “Two ciuill warres are past, the third is now in hand; “Vve see how stoutlie they are bent our forces to withstand. “Therefore we must deuise to plaie some other part, “Or else in vaine we take in hand these Princes to subuart. “Now lend your listening eares, and marke what I shall saie; “A secret thing I haue bethought which here I will bewraie: The diuels ghostlie counsell. “You must make show, as though you loude to liue at ease; “As wearie of these broiles, you must intreate to haue a peace. “The King as chiefest man this plaie must first begin, “By louing letters, words, and cheere at first to bring them in. “And looke what they mislike, the King must rase it out, “And yeeld to all things they request, to put them out of doubt. “The King must shew such face to them aboue the rest, As though he did vnfeinedlie of all men loue them best.” The worst of all their band the King must intertaine” With such good will, that no mistrust in anie maie remaine.” And he must make them know, as though of late he felt” Some pricke in conscience for the cause against the which hee delt.” And that he will forgiue al quarrels that are past,” In hope that this their new goodwil with loue might euer last” And he must make complaint, as though he did of late” Mislike the dealings of the Guise, and such as they doo hate.” And then the Guises must awhile from Court retire;” For thus you shall intrap them all, and haue your full desire.” The King must yeeld to all that they request or craue,” And he must grant for to c?firm the thing that they wold haue.” The Mother Queene in this must also play her part,” That no suspect of treason maie remaine within their heart.” And here you must giue out, as though you would imploie” Their seruice in some forreine warres, which dooth your State annoie.” As if you would not trust the weight of such affaires” To anie man, but them alone; whose faith and watchfull cares” You long haue tried: and so you maie your plot prepare” By these and such like fained things, to trap them in your snare.” It this preuaile not; then I stand in fearfull doubt,” What practise next to put in vre to haue them rooted out.” Now therefore say your minde, if thus it be not best” To cut them off, that so againe we all may liue in rest.” The Counsell did agree, this was the onelie waie, And euerie man did giue his word, this sentence to obaie. And that they would deuise such things to put in vre, As best might fit this cursed plot, and make the same most sure. Which Sathan hearing rose, and thankt them with his heart, The King doth presentlie put in practise Sathans counsell. That they to him so willing were: and so they did depart. Then presentlie the King in post a message sent Vnto the Admirall, to whom he shewed his good intent. The Kinges fained and flattering Ambassage to the Admirall. “Which was, that he was loath more ciuill warres to haue, “And that he greatlie did desire his subiects for to saue. “I will (said he) forget, yea pardon and release “All former griefes, so that you will now yeeld to haue a peace. “Which might be now to me a cause of passing ioie; “For that I meane in forreine warres your seruice to imploie; “And first we doo require, that we may ioyne our band, “Against the man that causeth all these troubles in our land. “Our Armies being ioynde, we may the stronger goe “Against the Duke of Alua, whom we know to be our foe. “Great matters moue our minde against the King of Spaine, “For he hath taken Florida, and late our sister slaine. With lies of like deuise the godlie to betraie, Requesting him most earnestly that he would come awaie; And that he should obtaine what safetie he would craue: Yea, for his suretie there, that he his faith &amp; oath should haue. The message being done, the Admirall as wise, Within himselfe did halfe suspect the plot of this deuise. And though that manie things did some suspition bring: Yet all things els he doubted more than falshood in the King. He thought the promise sure, and firmelie did beleeue, No treason could be ment, wheras the king his word did giue. The Admirall as one that was deuoide of feare, And willing for to heare of peace, vnto the King gaue eare. So now the ciuill broiles which manie did intend, By this deuise were pacified and brought vnto an ende. It cannot be exprest what shewes of frendlie minde, Both in the King and Courtiers all the Admirall doth finde. His frends likewise, which had the Gospell long profest As Countie Rouchfaucoult and eke Theligni with the rest, Like grace and fauor found: which made them so reioyce, That to consent vnto the King they all did giue their voice. And if in former warres the Admirall had lost Either castles, houses, townes or fermes what euer it shuld cost; The King commanded straight for to restore them all, And all things els which he of right of anie man could call. And those whom he perceiude the Admirall to loue, He blinded them with great rewards, suspition to remoue. Besides, he did command out of his purse to giue To him an hundred thousand pounds his losses to relieue. And when as it did chance his brother for to die, The Cardinall Chastilion: the King then presentlie The fruites and profites all of liuings all one yeare, Vnto the Admirall he gaue his charges to forweare. Yet not content with this, one thing aboue the rest The King most frendlie did: the which the godlie liked best. He wrote to Philibert the Duke of Sauoie then, That he should cease for to molest or grieue those godly men, The which in former warres the Gospel did defend; And that to such he should leaue off his rigor to extend. And that the Admirall might no misliking finde, He did by gentle meanes appease the Duke of Guises minde: He tride to make them frends, &amp; brought the same to passe; Although it on the Guises part a fained frendship was. The Cardinall likewise that was their greatest foe, To chuse a Pope, made th? beleeue to Rome that he would go. So all things being done, t'abandon all suspect, What they mislikte, the King would seeme the same for to reiect. So that about the king they onelie credit winne Which did defend the Gospel, &amp; which latelie were come in. But nothing did preuaile to put them out of doubt So much as one thing, which as now the king did go about. Which was, that he did wish his sister for to match Vnto Prince Henrie of Nauarre: by this in hope to catch. Them all within his snare; for this he did conclude, Not for good will, but mere deceipt the godlie to delude. Which match the king would haue consummate out of hand, That so it might remaine (said he) a sure and perfect band Of that vnfained loue, and inward heartie care, Which we to those that loue the truth &amp; gospel now do bear. Vvhich made them all reioice, and quite cast off their feare, Vvhen in the king they did behold such loue &amp; frendly cheer. Yet some did here alledge, that conscience did restraine The Prince to match with her, which yet did seeme for to remaine In loue with Popish rites; to which the King replide That he to ease those scruples all such order would prouide Vvhich they should not mislike: For he would there dispence Vvith all such rites and orders, as might breed the least offence. Vvhich Courtiers all mislike, and openlie repinde; Much doubting least vnto the truth the King had bin inclinde. The Admirall againe was much confirmde besides By other signes, not douting now their falshoods &amp; their slides. The godlie did reioice to see the King so bent Not thinking of the treacherie &amp; treason that they ment. So, matters being past and parties all agreed, In Paris towne to haue them ioinde by both it was decreed. The Queene of Nauarre now (a rare and vertuous dame) Vvith others to the Princes Court in full assurance came. Vvhere hauing staid awhile, she tooke her leaue to ride To Paris, for this solemne feast the better to prouide. The King to like effect, by message did request The Admirall that he would goe to Paris there to rest. And see that nothing want for that appointed day, And that himselfe would after come, and make no long delaie. And that he might not feare the mallice and the rage That Paris men did beare to him; he said he would asswage The same himselfe: and so he presentlie did write To Marcel Prouost of the towne (perceiuing well their spite) That he should intertaine and vse in frendlie wise The Admirall and all his traine, that nothing might arise Which might offend his minde or burst to anie flame: For if ther did, he swore he would most fiercely plague the same The king and Queene also vnto the like effect Vnto the Duke of Aniow did their letters now direct. So that the Admirall not doubting anie foe Resolude himselfe, and did prouide to Paris for to goe. Where being come, he found, the king and all the rest VVith frendly welcoms, so as more he could not wel request. But whilst that euerie man was busie to prouide Within the court, most sodainly the Queene of Nauarre dide: Which afterward was knowen (as some haue plainlie said) That by a paire of gloues perfumde this treason was conuaide. Which leaud and sinfull deede was now no sooner done; But that the Kingdome of Nauarre descended to her sonne. Heere manie did reioyce in hope of perfect rest, Yet this vnequall bloodie match the Guises did detest. That dismall daie is come, the marriage must begin, Where were assembled solemnlie the chiefe of euerie kinne. And for because the Masse their minds might grieue no more, The mariage was solemnised before the great Church dore Of Paris, with such words as both were well content: Which done, into the church the Bride in solemn maner w?t To heare a Popish Masse, both she and all her traine; Her husband walkt without the doore till she returnde againe. Then home at last they goe with mirth and passing ioy; They little thought this pleasant day would ende with such annoy. And now begins the plaies, the dancings and the sport, Which were performd by lusty youths that thither did resort. The King and Nobles all in pleasures are so mad, That for to talke of great affaires, no leasure could be had. And now the Admirall from Court had gone his way, Had not some causes of the Church inforced him to staie. Now from the wedding night, fiue daies are come and past: When as the King and Senate were contented at the last In counsell for to sit such matters to decide, As best might fit their fained warres in Flanders to prouide. Which ended, neere about the middle of the day As euerie man vnto his house did take his readie waie, The Admirall himselfe, with other Nobles moe Along the streetes (not doubting hurt) in pleasant talk do goe: A harquebusse was shot from other side the streete, Which charged was with bullets two the Admiral to greete. Which cursed blow did wound and strike this Noble man, That thorough both his valiant armes the leaden pellets ran. Which done, althogh the wo?d did tuch him somwhat neer, Yet nothing danted with the stroke, he said with w?ted cheer From yonder house it came, goe looke who is within, What vilde vnworthie trecherie is this they doo begin? And therewithall he sent in hast vnto the King, Such as might show vnto his grace this bad &amp; shamefull thing. The message being done (the King as then did plaie At tennis with the Duke of Guise he fiercelie threw awaie His racket in a rage, as though it grieude his heart, That thus the Admirall was hurt and streight he did depart Vnto his Castle, where a while he did remaine Close with his brother of Nauarre till he might heare againe More certaine newes: but now the matter was too plaine, That this assault was surelie made by one of Guises traine. Now whilest these greeuous wo?ds the surgeons had in cure, He sent Theligni to the King (because he was not sure Where he should liue or die) for to desire his Grace, That he would now vouchsafe to come vnto that simple place Where he did lie: for that he had a secret thing To tell him, which did much concerne the safetie of the King: Which was no sooner said, the King was well content, And with the man the message came without delaie he went. They went likewise that sought the Admirall to kill, The Mother Queen, with al her mates, no dout for great good will. Which all no sooner did within the dore appeere, But that the King saluted him with sweete &amp; friendlie cheere: The fained words of the King to the Admirall. Alas my deerest frend, how camst thou to this place,” Where wounded now I see thee lie me thinks in heauie case.” What arrant villaine wrought this leaud and sinfull act,” Would God I knew the wicked wretch that did commit the fact:” For though (my Admirall) the hurt be done to thee,” Yet the dishonor of the fact, and shame redounds to me.” Both which I will reuenge by death of God I sweare,” This King was a horrible blasphemer, and used this and such other like filthie othes. As like in France was neuer seene, to make such wretches feare.” Such speeches had the King, &amp; questions manie more Concerning Iudges, health &amp; griefe, and how he felt his sore. To which the Admirall with milde and quiet minde Such answere gaue, as moude them much such patience for to finde In him that had receaude such cause of deadlie ire: Who did request, but onelie that the King would straight inquire Vpon the fact: which was I surelie know said he Procured by the Duke of Guise, for great good will to me. Which deede the Lord reuenge as he shall thinke it best; For if I die, I hope by faith with Christ to be in rest. The rest he did desire a while to stand awaie, For that he had some secret thing vnto the King to saie. The secrete speaches betweene the Admirall, &amp; the king after the Admirall was wounded. Which done, he thus began; O King this life to saue,” Is not the thing (I thank the Lord) that I do greatly craue.” For this I know is true, we all must pay a death” To God our maker, which hath lent this vse of liuelie breath.” But to your Maiestie the great good will I bare” Is it which now aboue the rest dooth most increase my care:” To see you now beset with such as wish no good” Vnto your health, your crown &amp; life, &amp; such as seek the blood” “Of you and of your frends, to spill your noble race; “That so they may in future time your Princelie stocke deface. “And so at length ingraffe a strange Italian weede, “VVhich may in France most surelie choake the Princes royall seede. “This is the onelie marke to which they doo aspire; “This is the onelie wood ô King that doth mainteine the fire “Of these your ciuill warres, (although they doo pretend “Religion, and some other thing) this is the chiefest end “Of all their drift. Therefore ô King beware by time, “Mark this Eclipse, whilst yet ye see the Moone is in her Prime. “I saie the lesse, because I know your Grace is wise, “You shall in time most plainlie see this plot of their deuise “Your wisedome dooth perceaue (I hope) whom I doo meane, “For of the same with griefe before I heard you oft complaine. “For though that I doo lie heere wounded as you see, “The chiefest treason they intend is not alone to me: “But to your noble Grace, whose death they daily craue, “Whose life by treason long ere this &amp; now desire to haue. “I know when God shall take this fraile and wretched life, “Some will not sticke to say, that I was cause of all the strife. “But God that is aboue, and you my witnesse be, “How deare the safegard of my Prince, &amp; peace hath bin to me. “God grant you see in time your frends from fleering foe, “That still in safetie you may reigne deuoide of griefe and woe. “Now I can saie no more, but God preserue your Grace, “And shield you from your fained friends which beare a double face. “And this amidst your mirth I praie remember still, “That they that seek to haue my life, do beare you no good wil. Vvhich said, the king did giue such speach as he thought best: And then in loud and solemne words in hearing of the rest He did with frendlie cheere request the Admirall Vnto his Court for to remooue, what euer should befall. And others spake likewise vnto the same intent: His simple meaning could not see the treason that was ment. But yet vpon aduise, his frends did thinke it best, Not knowing what may there betide, the K.he should request, That he would them assigne some of his Graces gard, Before his gates both night &amp; day to keep their watch &amp; ward The motion being made, the King was well content, And said; to this their good deuise he gladly gaue consent. And that he would prouide to haue it surelie knowne, That of his life he made accompt no lesse than of his owne. And that he would preserue with care more tenderlie The Admirall, than he would keepe the apple of his eie. For that he did admire the valure of his minde, Vvho little thought in mortall man such courage for to finde. The Duke of Aniow then commanded out of hand One Cossin Captaine of the gard, to ward with Princes band The gates and streates wherein the Admirall did lie; Vvhich was no sooner said, but was performed presentlie. This Cossin that was set with watch to ward the gate, Vvas one that did the Admirall in heart most deadlie hate. And farther, for to put the matter out of doubt, They did consent that he should haue his trustie frends about The place where he did lie: which came of no good will; But hoping rather all by this the easier for to kill. And this among the rest a bloodie practise was, Vvhich cloaked guile by Sathans art too soone was brought to passe. The Queene Mother ledd out the King, the Duke of Aniow, Gonzague, Tansgues, the Co?ty de Rets called Goudin, into her gard?s called Tegliers. Bvt theere the Prologue endes, and heere begins the plaie, For bloodie mindes resolued quite to vse no more delaie. The Mother Queene appeares now first vpon the Stage, Vvhere like a diuelish sorceresse with words demure and sage The King she cals aside, with other trustie mates Into a close and secret place, with whom she now debates The great desire she had to quit them all from care, In planting long a bloodie plot, which now she must declare. “O The Oration of the Queene mother vnto the King. and other of her bloodie counsaile. happie light (quoth she) ô thrice most happie daie; “Which thus hath thrust into our hands our long desired pray: “We haue them all in hold, we haue the chiefest fast: “And those for whom we waited long we haue them all at last. “Vvhie should we longer staie? what can we farther craue? “Vvhat are not all things come to passe which wee doo long to haue? “Doth not our mightiest foe lie wo?ded in his bed, “Not able now to helpe himselfe, which others long hath led? “The Captaines captiue are, the King of Nauarre sure; “The Prince of Condee, with the rest that mischiefe did procure “Are close within our wals, we have them in a trap; “Good fortune(loe) hath brought them al, &amp; laid th? in our lap. “By force or flight to saue their liues it is too late, “If we (to cut off future feare and cause of all debate) “Doo The queen mother was a good scholer of that diuel of Florence, Machiuel, of whom she learned manie bad lessons, as this.take the profered time: which time is onelie now; “And wisedome matcht with policie our dealings doth allow. “Vve neede not feare the spot of anie 1.

Some doubting, mused long which were the better waie, The King of Nauarre and the Prince of Condee for to slaie; Or els to saue their liues in hope they would recant: Because the proofe of perfect yeres they both as yet did want. But It was of most thought best, partlie for age, partlie for diffinitie sake, that the King of Nauarre should be saued. And for the Prince of Condee, the opinion of Gonzague tooke place that be should with feare of death be drawen fr? Religion. here, they did preuaile (as God, no doubt would haue) Vvho thoght it best in this assalt these princely youths to saue. Because they were in hope, that when those impes should see Their mates torm?ted thus, they would most willingly agree To bow where they would bind, to go where they would cal; And to forswere their former faith would make no dout at all. But all the rest remaine condemned for to die Vvhich cruell verdit must be put in practise presentlie The It was decreed, that this murder should begin about midnight of the night next following. night that should insue then next without delay, Beginning ere the same were spent long time before the day. The Duke of Guise was thought the fittest of the traine To take in hand this bloodie plot to haue the godlie slaine. Concluding thus, they goe each one vnto his place, The godlie doubting nothing lesse than this so heauie case. Heere is the first part plaide; and heere I doo lament, My slender skill wants fitted phrase the sequele to depaint. The Duke in office put begins for to prepare, So that in troopes the armed men ranne busling here and there With noise &amp; threatning words, as though some tumult were Preparing now in euerie streete; which made the wisest feare Vvhat would insue. At length the Admirall did heare This tumult, and not knowing how the truth for to inquire; He sent vnto the King to know the full intent, Vvhy in the night in riot wise these armed people went Thus raging in the streetes: and where it were his will? If so, he would not feare; but rest in hope of safetie still. “The King returned word, and wilde him not to feare: For this was done by his aduise, yet not in euerie where, But in some certaine waies these armed men were set: The foolish rage of leaud attempts by this in hope to let. O leaud and filthie lie! vnseemlie for a King: Vvhat Turke or Diuell could deuise, a more vnworthy thing. For when the Duke of Guise had all in order set, And nothing rested which might seem their purpose for to let; He Marcell calls in hast, and wills him haue a care That all the masters of the streetes ere midnight did repaire Vnto the Counsell hall, where they should heare at large Great matters fr? the King himself of str?ge &amp; speciall charge. The message being done, they all without delaie This Carron was made new Prouost of the Marchants. Assembled were, to know the thing the Guises had to saie. Where Prouost Carron rose with stomacke stout and bolde, And garded with a Guisian troope, this bloodie message tolde; Carr?s blodie oration to the Citizens of Paris. My frends (quoth he) giue eare, and marke what I shall saie,” The Kings intent is presentlie this night without delay,” Those Rebels to destroy; which now these latter yeeres” Bore armes against his Grace: which thogh they be his peeres,” Yet will he quite pull vp, and roote the lawlesse race” Of th?, that long haue sought by force his dealings to disgrace.” And what a happie time (I praie) my mates, is this;” When fast within our Citie wals the Captaine closed is” That fiercelie brued the broile of this our doubtfull strife,” And manie times hath put vs all in danger of our life?” Their trust by treason trainde, is cause of this deceite:” The Queen mother was the chiefe deuiser of this bloodie stratageme Oh happie she that wrought the molde of this so cunning feat.” Their fr?ds will proue their foes, sweet plesures wil haue pain;” And being here they are not like to see their homes againe.” Their chambers prisons are, their beds shall be their graue:” And ere the day appeere we must a glorious Conquest haue.” Be strong therefore my frends, make sharpe the fatall knife;” For of these Rebels ere the day not one shall scape with life.” Their leader and their guide lies wounded in his bed,” And therefore as the chiefest foe, we'ill first haue off his head.” And when we haue dispatcht the Rebels we haue heere,” We'ill likewise ransack all the Land of like that shall appeere.” “This is the Kings intent, this is his Graces minde, “To doo this feate, let him in vs a willing courage finde: “And for a token when this murder shall begin, Tockeseine was the great bell of the Pallaice which was accustomed to be rong onelie for great causes “The warlike trumpet shall not sound, nor banner shalbe seene; “But Tockeseine shalbe heard this bloodie newes to bring, “For then begin, when as you heare this Pallace bell to ring: “The badge which you shall bear by which you shal be known, “Shalbe a Linnen cloath of white, made fast about the brawne “Of left side arme; and eke, a crosse vpon your cap, “Of white likewise: and these keepe fast what euer chance may hap. “And this is all (my frends) that I haue now to saie, “Come follow me, and let's begin and vse no more delaie. This while the Duke of Guise did shew his whole intent Vnto the Captaines of the gard, and bad them giue consent With courage to performe so great and famous act; Which seruice as the case did st?d, they might not l?g ptotract Now shortlie after this, the Duke with manie more This Cheualier was the bastard sonne of K. Henrie of France. (Accompanied with the Cheualier and armed men great store) The Duke of Guise and the cheualier come to the Amirals house. Came posting to the gate which Cossin tooke to keep, Woe worth the time wh? they did trust the wolfe to gard the sheepe. The Admiral knew wel the tumult of this rout; Yet this, nor anie thing could make his valiant heart to doubt: For though he had but few, scarce tenne within the place; Yet nothing could at all preuaile to make him doubt his case. The Admiral aduertised of this stir, comforteth himself &amp; his c?pany, with the rem?brance of the kings loue &amp; his oaths often giuen for keeping the peace. “For oft he would repeate the Kings assured loue, “Approoued by so manie signes as you haue heard aboue: “What though the C?mons rise? what thogh the tumult rage? “When they shal see the princes gard, their malice wil asswage. “I know the King will not by treason false his faith, “Thogh for the same there might ensue the hazard of his death. “The oath that he hath sworne so oft to keepe the peace, “No Christian conscience can assent at all for to release. His mother gaue her faith, his brothers sware likewise,” The publique recordes of the Land doo witnesse this deuise.” What band may surer be? what more may you desire?” What can we farther wish? And yet if more you doo require” The Queene of England is a witnes of the same,” The Prince of Aurendge, &amp; the States that from the Germaines came.” The marriage of the Kings sister was solemnised but sixe daies before This Royal match likewise my hart doth wel assure” That such a seale of perfect loue for euer will indure:” Which marriage latelie made with counsell graue and good,” The King will not permit to be so soone defilde with blood.” For what would strangers saie if such things should befall?” But such things Lord be farre from vs, &amp; Lord preserue vs all?” What would the future age of impes as yet vnborne;” What would all Nations thinke, if we by trust should be forlorne?” The stout and constant minde, &amp; honor of the King” Will neuer giue consent I know to doo so leaud a thing.” Thus whilest among the rest the case he did debate, His trustie keeper Cossin came and knocked at his gate. Who was no sooner come within the outward dore, But that there came in after him of armed men great store. Then after went the Lords, the Nobles, and the rest; For to dispatch this noble man, whom they did most detest. And those whom Cossin found within to lie or stand, He slew them with a Partisan which he had in his hand. Which wofull newes when as the Admirall perceiude, The Admirall perceiuing the treason that was in tended against him, prepareth himselfe with c?fort to receaue his death, and patientlie comm?deth his soule to God, whilest his enemies were a breaking open the dore, upon him Wo worth the time (quoth he) that I by trust haue been deceiude.” Wel, now the time is come, I may no longer doubt,” Come lend your help, my frends (I pray) fr? bed to lift me out.” To Christ my onelie hope my soule I doo betake,” And in this place from off my couch this life I will forsake.” Then st?ding on his feet his night gown on his back: Shift for your selues my frends (quoth he) that you goe not to wrack,” “And haue no care for me; for I am well content “This life to yeeld vnto the Lord, which he to me hath lent. “It greeues me not to die, Gods will is alwaie best; “From future feares I know with Christ my soule shalbe in rest. “This plot is not preparde alone to murder me; “But for the rasing of that truth, which they are loath to see. “The godlie for to spoile which haue receaude the word, “These tyrants seeke with cruel hate by falshood and by sword. “Which word vnto my power I alwaies did defend, “The mallice of which godly course hath broght me to my end. “Which doth reioyce my heart &amp; soule exceedinglie; “That for his truth the Lord hath thought me worthy for to die. “For though our sinnes doo cause these troubles in our land: “Yet shall these tyrants not escape the Lords reuenging hand. “And though our God doo seeme from vs to hide his face, “And armes our foes with cruell death his people to disgrace: “Yet if we be content, his mercie will retire. “Haue mercie Lord vpon thy Church, ô Christ I thee desire. The Admirall inuaseth against the wicked treason of the Queene Mother, the King, and the Duke of Guise. “And you ô traitors vilde that laide this trothlesse traine, “Against the Lord haue lifted vp your wicked harts in vaine. “For you are puffed vp with hope that is not sure; “For these our paines, you shal receaue the pains that shal indure. “And you that dare to lift your hands against the Lord, “Before your death most iustlie shall of all men be abhord. “Though yet you doo not feele the sentence that is due “To this your bloodie traitors act, yet know that you shall rue “Your breach of plighted faith, your deepe dissembling hart; “There is a God will iudge vs all, that will reuenge our smart. “The paine that we receaue doth breed eternall ioy; “But for the wr?g that you haue done the Lord wil you destroy “O Lord confirme my faith, which now must here be tride; “Reach me thy hand(ô Christ) that I from thee may neuer slide. My fearfull flesh is weake, my heart and will is prest:” Forsake me not my God, but now receaue me to thy rest.” Let not this irksome shade, this darke and dolefull night” Keepe from my heart in this assault thy sweete &amp; plesant light:” For though the worldlie Sunne mine eie shall see no more,” Thy blessed Sonne let me enioy, whom I by faith adore.” And whereas I dispaire no more to see the day,” In steed of that, thy louing face shew me (my God) I praie.” Loe then, a blessed chance, and happie change for me;” That from this vale of wretched life with Christ in ioy shalbe.” Now let these traitors come, the feare of death is past;” And fainting flesh that did rebell, hath yeelded at the last.” Now doth my soule reioice, my heart most gladlie saie;” Thou Sonne of God, my Sauiour come, my Christ now come thy waie?” For here againe to thee my soule I do commend, ” And to thy poore afflicted Church ô Lord thy mercie send.” So shall they be at rest, so shall they praise thy name;” Let not these tyrants longer Lord thy seruants put to shame.” Least they doo proudlie bragge, and saie within their heart;” Vvher is the God wh? they do serue, that now shuld take their part.” Come quicklie Lord therefore, &amp; make no more delay ” To ende these fierce and bloodie broiles; Amen, Amen, I saie.” Three wicked varlets brake into the Admirals chamber, whose names were, Benuise a Germaine, Cossin a Gascoine, Attin a Picard. By this came vp the staires ere ended were his words, One Benuise &amp; two other mates with targets &amp; with swords. The chamber broken vp, this Benuise swearing came Vvith sword drawn to the Admirall, &amp; asking for his name; Art thou the Admirall? the man not much appalde, Vvith quiet minde gaue answere thus; Indeed so am I calde. Then seeing Benuise bend his naked sword to slaie, My frend (quoth he) that bloodie blade I pray thee for to staie, The Admirals last words. And haue respect vnto my age, and weake estate To which by treason wrought by trust I haue bin drawn of late. But beastlie Benuise would to this no answere giue: But swearing, to this Noble man his pointed sword let driue, And thrust him to the heart: but yet not fullie dead, The cruell and cowardly murder of the Admirall. With force he laid a mightie blow &amp; strake him on the head. With that came Attin in with Pistoll in his hand, And shot him in the wounded breast; yet did he stoutlie stand: Till Benuise came againe with third repeated wound: And slasht him on the thigh: which done, he fel vnto the gro?d Where he gaue vp the ghost. The bloodie Guise that staid This while within the lower court, with lifted voice now said Hoe Benuise, hast thou done? who straightwaie did replie, Yea sir this happie deed is done, and that most perfectlie. Then said the Duke of Guise Come throw him down to me: That where it be the same, or not, we here may quicklie see: For now our Cheualier will thinke it but a lie, Except at window throwen out he see him with his eie. Then Benuise with his mates to put them out of doubt, Tooke vp this bloodie corse: &amp; so from window cast him out. Where from his wounded head sprang out so fresh a flood, That vizard-like his face was all imbrued with goarie blood. Whereby they could not well at first discerne his face: Till that the Duke of Guise himselfe first kneeling in the place Had with his napkin wipte the clotted blood awaie, And searching viewed euerie part; he rose without delay, And crying to his crue deuoide of feare and shame: It's he (my frends) I know him well, trust me it is the same. The Duke descending then from out the stately gates, With bloodie hart and cursed mouth he cride vnto his mates, The wicked speeches of the bloodie Guise after the murder of the Admirall. O happie lucke that we so good beginnings haue, ”Lo Fortune frames her willing hand to giue that we do craue. ”And sith it pleasde the fates at first such hap to send, ”It giues me cause of future hope to see some happie end. Come on my valiant hearts, so place your warlike bands,” That marching forward to the rest, not one may scape our h?ds” This is the Kings decree, this hath he giuen out;” We do no more than he commands, to put you out of doubt;” Let pitie take no place till Rebels all be rid,” Thus saith the king, feare not therfore to do what he doth bid.” Let nothing now preuaile to dant your hardie minde;” The right picture of a bloodie Tyrant. No, though with teares they pitie craue, let th? no mercie find.” Haue no remorse vnto the yong ne yet the olde;” Without regard to anie one to kill them all be bolde.” Now sanctifie your swords, and bath them in the blood” Of these religious Rebels, which do meane the King no good.” So shall we quicklie finde a path to perfect peace;” So shall we see assured meanes at length to liue at ease:” For if we can recount the troubles that are past;” Then happie time wherein we may dispatch them all at last.” Vvhich said; he bad in hast the Tockesein for to ring, Vvhich sounding bell appointed was the fatall newes to bring Vvhen as this raging rout this murder should begin: Vvhich they performde, as though they had no men, but monsters bin. And therewithall deuise a larum for to raise— Pretending with some solemne lie the people for to please. So now the trumpets sound this lie and shamefull thing, That certaine traitors were in armes about to kill the King. Gonzagues an Italian cut off the Admirals head, &amp; sent it to the Pope. Heere, one among the rest from Rome that latelie came, (Desirous by some valiant act perhaps to get a name) Cut off the bleeding head (imbrude with reaking blood) Of that most worthie Admirall in hope to doo some good; The Cardinall of Lorraine. And sent it straight to Rome as Lorraine had requirde, A present welcome to the Pope, which he had long desirde. His hands cut off by some, by some his secrete parts, Declares what hate to shining light lies hid in blinded harts. His hackt and mangled corpes by space of certaine daies Vvas dragde by rascals all along the streetes and filthie waies. At length this rusticke rage, as furie thought it meete; At common gallowes of the towne did hang him by the feete. Thus came this Noble man to this vnworthie death, Thus doo the Papists learn to break the vow of plighted faith. The Admirall being slaine, they likewise murdred most cruellie not onelie all such frends, Phisitians, Preachers, and al other that were found hidden in the Admirals lodging, but also as manie as were suspected to be of that religion within the towne or anie where els, were lamentablie put to the sword, as here folowing we may plainlie see. These furies frying thus, yet thus were not content: But in the house, from place to place, like greedie hounds they went. To search the chambers all and corners of receipt; That from the wolfe the sheep might saue his throate by no deceipt. And such as sleeping were found naked in their bed, Or gone to hide or saue themselues they first cut of their head, And after fiercelie pierst with wounds both great and deepe; Vvhich being done, like cruell currs they throw th? on a heap. Among which wofull troope two Noble youths there were And Pages of most worthie birth which likewise died there. Vvith these, among the rest a man of noble fame, The Countie Rouchfoucault was forst at length to tast the same. Vvhom for his pleasant wit the King did seeme to loue; Yet in this furie nothing might the King to mercie moue. But now in hast must be to death vntimelie sent, To yeeld againe vnto the Lord the life that he had lent. So him at first De Nance commanded was to kill; But he most stoutlie did Mounsier De Nance Captaine of the gard, refuseth to kill the Countie Rouchfoucault. refuse this guiltlesse blood to spill. His speeches vsed both priuatelie to his frends, and also to the King vpon the refusall. Shall I, said he, consent to doo this fearfull thing To shed this blood, because I am commanded by the King?” No, God forbid, I know I haue a soule to saue;” So bloodie spot, to saue my life my name shall neuer haue.” I know there is a day, a day that Reu. 6.10.Saints desire;” When of our deeds the king aboue a reckoning will require.” Obaie the Rom.13.11.Pet.2.13.Tit.3.1. King; that's true, in things that honest be:” When I obey in wicked hests, wo worth the time to me.” For Ioab did not well 2.Sam.11 16. King Dauid to obay, When wickedlie the King him bad Vriah for to slay.” Those Elders did offend which shewde themselues too prone,” Those wicked letters to obey poore 1. King. 21. 11. Naboth for to stone.” And cursed 1. Sam.22 18. Doeg which obaide a wicked will,” Shall cursed stand for that he did the Lords annointed kill.” A murder to be done the King doth now request,” My God c?mands the contrary: now which to chuse wer best?” The King doth threaten death, and God doth threaten hell,” If for the King I should forsake my God, should I doo well?” His speeches to the king. Vvhat others see ô King, I cannot well diuine,” To kill the vncondemned man it is no charge of mine.” To slaie my deadlie foe except there were some cause” I would not yeeld; much lesse my fr?d against our sacred laws.” What enuie doth report, ô King I cannot saie;” But this my frend a faithfull man to me hath been alwaie.” Therefore I praie your Grace your rigor to asswage,” Or bid some other whom you list to execute your rage.” In matters that be good if that you list to vse” My seruice, you shall see that I no perill will refuse.” 1. Sam. 22. 17. Therefore I praie your Grace this answere for to take, Which vnto Saule his Soldiers once were not afraid to make: De Nance to kill his frend no wight shall euer see, Though for refusall he were sure beheaded for to be. Take heed (ô noble King) what sprite you follow now; Let no man force you doo the thing that God doth disallow. While good king Dauid was by whoredome brought a sleep, He did the thing, which being wakt did force his hart to weep While Saule in mallice was against good Dauid bent, He ranne to that which afterward with teares he did lament. And whilest that Iezabel great mischiefe did intend Against poore Naboth, she at last came to a fearfull ende. Looke well therefore (ô King) before you leap too farre, Least in the end this testie scab do breed a lasting scarre. Well I can saie no more, but God preserue your Grace, And graunt your soule when breath is gone with him a resting place. Wh? De N?ce had refused t? kil the Counti? Rouchfoucault one Laberg an Auernois offered to do it, if the K. would give him his of fice, which was to be Captaine of the horsmen But this could not preuaile this noble man to saue, For bloodie Doeg did attend his office for to haue. For which, an Auernois a man of cused fame Made offer there, before the King that he would do the same. The King was well content this office for to giue To him, so that this Noble man of life he would bereaue. We see how Sathan doth by glorie mixt with gaine, Worke to procure this worthy wight the sooner to be slaine. There fell in this assault (for mallice to the truth) The death of Thelignis sonne in lawe to the Admirall. Theligni famous for his wit, a rare and passing youth: Who for his manlie heart and courage did excell: For which, the King in outward shewe did seeme to loue him wel. Now when the time was come that martird he shuld be The wordes of Theligni vttered before his deth “With courage bold, he smiling said; O welcome death to me. “It grieues me for to liue since faith from Princelie seate “Abandonde is, and in her place raignes falshood and deceite. It grieues me for to see this sad and irksome daie,” Wherein so great and famous King, a traitors part shuld play.” It grieues me for to heare poore soules deceiued crie” Too late, for that they did too much on Princes oath relie.” The Admirall at first doubting some policis and il meaning, staide a while, &amp; durst not trust the King: but at length ouercome with the perswasions of Theligni his sonne in law, &amp; other his frends that there could be no hurt ment, they all being deceiued with the Kings curtesies, he yeelded and came in vpon trust. Woe worth my harmlesse heart too soone that did beleeue,” And to the kings dissembling words too soone did credit giue.” Woe worth the wicked time when first I did begin” To worke the meanes, for to perswade my father to come in.” Woe worth my lying tongue which first assaid to bring” My fearfull Father in the minde, that he should trust the King.” How oft did I commend the Kings assured loue?” How did I thinke that nothing might vs fr? the same remoue?” How oft did I recount the Kings repeated oath?” How many frendly signes were seene of force to bind vs both?” How often did I vrge there was no cause of feare,” Because for this we saw the King most willing for to sweare?” But sith it is too late this error to lament,” My trusting hath deserued death; and therefore am content.” Sith I am not the first whom trust hath thus betraid,” To suffer death for no offence I am the lesse dismaide.” And since my greatest hope hath wrought me most despite,” What shall I saie? I saie no more: but Lord receaue my sprite.” Thus came this noble impe vntimelie to his graue, For that he to a Beware of the guilfull promises of the Papists. Papists oath too great affiance gaue And thus fell manie moe of Nobles here and there, Whose names &amp; valiant acts, were now to l?g for to declare. Thus did those lawlesse bands go raging vp and downe From house to house, they sought to spoyl the welthiest of the town. So they that beggers were when first this stirre began, At last with rich and flowing welth the chiefest credit wan. This while the Duke of Guise these words repeated still, With crying voice, Kill, kill the knaues, this is the princes wil.” And least the souldiers should waxe faint with bloodie toile; “Now rid th? al my fr?ds(quoth he) &amp; you shal haue the spoile. Thus did they all a day from morning vnto night With bloodie swords runne vp and down: no doubt a heauie sight. They spared none they knew, no sex could pitie finde, The rufull crie of tender babes could not asswage their minde. In great triumphing ioye of this their warlike feate, The bodies slain fr? windowes hie they throw into the streat. So that there was no way, no lane or passage by; Vvhere murdred men you might not see in heaps together lie. Now whilst within the towne these things a dooing were; The King of Nauarre and the Prince of Condee did appeere The King of Nauarre, And the Prince of Condee were had to the king. Before the King. For so before it was agreed To saue these youths to farther hope the counsell had decreed. For they their lodging had within the Castle wall; Vvhich for defence is alway thought the surest place of all. These Princes being gone, and onelie had awaie, These Princes seru?ts, frends, tutors, with all their retinue were most cruellie slaine. The rest were left vnto the sword to die without delaie: Their seruants &amp; their frends, their tutors with the rest Could not preuaile to saue their liues by sute ne yet request; But thrust without the dores, and kneeling in the place, The gard of Switzers slew them all before the Princes face. And still betweene the stroke they cried all amaine Vpon the Kings fidelitie; but faith was calde in vaine. The lamentable murder of Monsieur De Pilles. Yet none amongst them all so much lamented was, As Mounsieur de Pilles that he should come vnto so hard a passe. Because among the rest he past them all so farre For godlie zeale in truth, and eke for prowesse in the warre. Vvho lying in his bed somwhat before the day, And hearing noise of armed men leapt out to see the fray: And marking well the voyce in place and time of truce, Of cries and killings euerie where, it made him much to muse. Vvhich dump De Nance did break, who did this message bring That straight to void the place he was c?manded by the king; And that he should depart (his weapons left behinde) From out the Court and Castle gate ful sore against his minde. Vvhich was no sooner said but Pilles was forced out Among the bloodie weapons of that rude vnrulie rout. To hope for longer life he saw it was but vaine: He saw such cruell rage, and eke the bodies that were slaine? Vvhere lifting vp his voice, so that the King might heare, These words he spake before them al, deuoid of fainting feare. The vehement words of Monsieur De Pilles, vppon the Kings traitrous infidelitie. O false vnworthie King, ô whelpe of sauage kinde!” O traitrous heart in kinglie breast! ô base polluted minde!” Is this a Princelie part, by treason to procure” The murder of thy chiefest frends? Is this thy Popish lure,” To traine vs in by trust, to thrust vs thus to death?” Is this thy solemne Kinglie oath? is this a Princes faith?” Is this thy frendlie cheere? Is this thy fawning face?” Is this the fruite of Romish faith? ô false dissembling race!” And doost thou honor so thy sisters spousall daie?” And couldst thou finde no other time thy treasons to bewraie?” Is this the trust that is in mother, sonne, and kinn?” Let France th? curse the man that did first bring this kinred in.” How are thy wits bewitcht? what furie doth inrage” Thy tigers heart, that nothing can thy thirst but blood asswage?” And wast thou not afraid to giue thy leaud consent” To murder them, which to beleeue thy promise were content?” Vvhere are thy frendlie words? where is thy feined loue?” Vvhat, hath thy flintie heart forgot there is a God aboue?” And thinkst that thou shalt shed our guiltlesse blood in vaine?” Shall not the Lord (ô wretch) of thee require the same againe?” How darest thou to behold the creatures of the Lord;” Vvhen for thy false and bloodie fact this place shalbe abhorde?” “What answere canst thou make to this vnhappietowne, “Which for thy traitrous act shall loose his glorie &amp; renowne? “What answere canst thou giue to manie a weeping childe? “To manie matrones husbandles what reason canst thou yeeld? “And deemst thou not that God will plague this sinfull land “For this our blood? &amp; fearst thou not Gods just reu?ging hand. “Yes though at this our greefe thou proudlie now doo jest, Psal.19.12 2 Sam.3.27 &amp; 20.10. 1.Ki.2.34. 2.Sam.13 28. “Yet God will not forget the blood of them that be opprest. “Did Ioab die in peace that had by treason slaine “Two noble men? Did not his blood requite the same againe? “Did Absolom likewise that wrought his brothers death “By treason, vnder frendlie show, and falsing plighted faith, “Thus prosper long? No, no, for God did quicklie send 2 Sam. 18. 9 “To this rebellious wicked wretch a swift and fearfull end. “Be sure therefore of this, and marke what Pilles harh said, Monsieur De Pilles prophecieth the kings horrible death which shortlie after came indeed so to passe That this our blood by shedding of thy blood shalbe repaid. Which said, from off his backe he put a costlie cloke, And to a frend among the presse, the same thus saying toke. Take this, and let the same a token still remaine, That Pilles thy frend by treason was here most vniustlie slaine. With that he did commend his soule vnto the Lord, Vpon his knees with lifted eies still waiting for the sword. Monsieur De Pilles murdred by one of the Gard with a Partisan. Then one of Princes gard to end this bitter strife, Thrust thorough Pilles with partisan, who yeelded ther his life? This was the cruell ende of that most famous man; To read the same without remorse, I thinke no creature can. 4. Hundreth bouses in Paris sacked. This Rout in Paris streates which posted vp and downe, Foure h?dred houses sacked haue within that wicked towne. The King therewith directs his letters out in post, To Cities all his message flies in hast to euerie coast, The king commanded al Cities in his land to follow the example of Paris, in murdring as manie as professed the reformed religion. That they (as Paris had) with murder should oppresse As manie in their townes, as did the Gospell there professe. Which leaud and bloodie charge, a wonder is to see, How glad and willing to obaie most townes and Cities be. The butcherlie murder committed vpon the professors of the Gospel at Lions in France. But one among the rest, a place of ancient fame, Did Lion-like behaue her selfe, as Lions was her name. For though in other townes by murder manie fell; Yet Lions for her cruell hart, all others did excell. Where then, vnhappie then, a Lion as the chiefe Mandelot Gouernor at Li?s One Mandelot was Gouernor a blacke and bloodie theefe, Vvho hauing once receiude these letters from the King, Vvith greedy mind, he sets abroach this vile vnworthie thing. Vvho caused out of hand his Crier to proclaime That al within the towne which did the Gospel then maintain Should presentlie resort vnto a certaine place Vvhere Mandelot would haue them al appeere before his face. This message being done, the godlie doo obay, And to the place appointed them they came without delaie, Vvhere Mandelot they found with visage pale and sad, Vvho nothing said, but bids them all to prison to be had. The godlie trapped thus, and thus to thraldome sent; As sheepe vnto the slaughter they to prison meeklie went. Vvhere lying in the Clinke their feete and hands were bound, And by the cruell Iailors were laid prostrate on the ground. Then Mandelot commands the hangman for to call, Vvhom he enioynes to enter in with axe to kill them all. But this so fearfull fact the hangman did refuse, The c?mon hangman of Lions, had more grace &amp; ho nestie, than Mandelot the Gouernor. And bad him for so wicked act some fitter man to chuse.” For I will not defile my hands with guiltlesse blood,“ Nor giue consent (said he) to doo the thing that is not good.“ On such as are condemnde by Iustice and by law,“ I onelie am in publike place my deadlie blade to draw.“ The man repelled thus, inuents another waie;“ He wills the souldiers of the towne these prisners for to slaie: The garrison souldiers also refuse to commit this vilde murther. “But they likewise replide; that they would not distaine “The glorie of their martial feates, with fame that they had slain “Poore simple naked men bound prostrate at their feete, “It is a seruice (sir saie they) for souldiours farre vnmeete: “And therefore if you haue this murder thus decreed, “Chuse out some other men that list performe so hard a deed. “Yet if in Rebell sort their banners were displaide, “To put them all vnto the sword we would not be afraid. “But now sith that we know no fault that they haue done, “Let them (for vs) proceed heerein that haue the same begun. Againe refused thus, the man with furie bent, For all the butchers of the towne, he straight his message sent. To whom in sauage sort his minde he did vnfolde; And had them goe &amp; kill them all whom he had laid in holde. These beastlie butchers then no conscience made at al, The butchers more cruell &amp; bloodie, than either hangm? or souldiers, obey this wicked Tyrant, in committing this horrible murder. But with their blodie butchering kniues like tigers they do fall Vpon these sillie soules, in murder fiercelie bent; Not like to men, but rather as some furies had been sent From hell, to stop the course of Gods afflicted word; So quicklie did these helhounds put these people to the sword. Here some that prostrate were, and did for mercie crie, And other some vnto the Lord that lift their voices hie, They killed not, but did their hands cut off at first, And after chopt in sauage sort with blood to qu?ch their thirst Such shrikes and wailing cries from prisons did rebound, That euerie corner of the towne might hear their woful so?d. The mournfull mothers wept, whom nature did compell, To see these ho?ds before their face their louing babes to quel The tender infant doth for help to father crie, The wofull father cannot helpe his childe before he die. The husband to his wife, the frend to frend doth call, With heauie sighes lamenting this their most vnhappie fall. And they that strongest are to weake doo comfort giue, That so they may by sugred words their fainting harts relieue. Of these captiued soules such was the piteous plight, That verie Papists did lament to see this cruell sight. And some that loude the Pope, these dealings did detest; Who for their credit did not thinke this rigor to be best. And manie women of the towne deuoide of crime With horror of this sodain feare, had child before their time. For from the common The blood was seene to runne warme &amp; smoking through the streetes of the towne into the riuer of Some.Gaole in sight of shining Sunne, The smoking bloud from streat to streat with grief was seen to runne. But one amongst the rest, an old &amp; aged man Calde The valiant &amp; constant death of Francis Collute march?t of caps with 2 yong men his sons Francis Collute, for his faith a lasting credit wan. To whom with bloodie axe when butchers did resort, Vpon his Sonnes with teares he fell, and did them thus exhort; You know (quoth the godlie &amp; zealous oration of Francis Collute to his 2 sonnes, lying with them upon the ground, readie to be sacrificed.he) my Sonnes, what pain &amp; tender care” Your louing Father from your youth hath had for to prepare” Your hearts to know the Lord, his truth to intertaine;” Which farre surmounteth fading wealth, &amp; hope of worldlie gaine.” Now is our haruest in, now must our fruite appeere, Now wil the Lord require accompt how we haue liued here.” The finall axe is laid to roote of falling tree;” And how we have the truth imbrac't, the world forthwith must see.” Be strong therefore my Sonnes, refuse not profred death;” Which from the Lord is sent to be a triall of our faith.” But how should we be strong, when flesh doth dailie fall?” O Lord increase our faith, that we maie come when thou dost call” And from the Lord I know this butchring axe is sent, Who Sathans sword hath losed now no doubt for some int?t.” This is no new deuise which Sathan puts in vre;” For they that will imbrace the trurh of this shall still be sure.” For vnto Truth belongs both fier, sword and racke,” And naked Truth hath alwaies tied a whip vnto her backe.” “The ages that are past doo yet declare the same, “Whose constant death for Christ, depaints the glorie of their name. “For as the sillie sheepe betweene the Lions iawes. “And like the meek &amp; wailing doue in goshauks greedie pawes “So is the present state of Christs afflicted flocke, “Who are content with Christ to lay their head vnto the block “Feare not therefore to tast this cup of ioyfull paine, “That with the Lord in lasting joy we all may meete againe. “Let nothing force your faith from Christ to goe astraie, “For I your Father(as your guide) will lead you first the waie. “One house hath helde vs all, one Christ hath been our joy; “This sweete and noble vnion let Sathan not destroy. “And let vs ioyne in one this death for to imbrace, “So ioynd with Christ we shalbe sure with him to haue a place. “I was not he that gaue your vse ofliuelie breath; “I am not he that sets the time and order of your death. “It is the Lord alone, which will restore againe “A better life, if for his law by death we suffer paine. “Come, let vs gladlie giue our throate vnto the knife; “And for our Christ let vs reioyce to leaue this wretched life. “And saie you all with me; ô Lord from these our bands, “Receaue (we praie) our sinfull soules into thy blessed hands. “And lend vs Lord thy grace and mercie to the end, “Thy blessed helpe to come to thee, o Lord of mercie send. And this repeating oft the butchers with their blade, Their bodies then with deadlie wo?ds a bloody present made. Then ioyning on the ground they clasped all in one; Where groueling lay in folded armes the father with the sonn Which sodaine heauie chance such wofull sight did giue, That iust remorse of causeles death a flinty hart would grieue. Thus hath this blessed man receaud a happie place; The Lord grant vs that be behinde like portion of his grace. Amen. A cruell, cowardlie, and traitrous murder, committed in Angiers in France, vpon one Masson de Riuers a famous and godlie preacher, by a wicked enemie called Monsorrell, who was sent by the King to Angiers in post, to commit the like murder there, as was in Paris. Now Lions fare thou well, to Angiers will I goe, Wherein also the godlie flocke, lackt not a deadlie foe. For there was dwelling then a famous learned man; Vvho for his paines and godlie life a worthie credite wan. He was the first that laid the foundation of the Church at Paris. He was the first that dar'de the Gospell for to preach In Paris towne: where first the same to manie he did teach. Masson De Riuers was this godlie preachers name, Vvho had the Sorbons manie times by learning put to shame. Now when in Paris towne the murder was at most, The bloodie Curre Monsorrell was to Angiers sent in post. Vvho was no sooner come within that wofull towne, And that from off his barbed horse he was descended downe. But that he did inquire where Masson then did dwell, For that he had vnto the man some secrete thing to tell. And comming to the house, before the entrie dore He met with Massons wife; to whom he vsed then great store Of filed words, as though he meant nothing amisse, A Iudas kisse. And like a Courtier courteouslie salutes her with a kisle: And where is now (I praie) your husband to be had? To see the good man ere I went, I would be verie glad: For that with him I haue a word or two talke. In yonder garden sir (quoth An honest &amp; louing wife mistrusting no hurt, betraied her busb?d to a flattring murderer. she) my husband now doth walk. And so she did direct the traitor to the place; Where comming, he most courteouslie good Masson did imbrace. The speeches of Monsorrel to Masson. “And canst thou tell (quoth he) whie I am hether come? “It is to doo the Princes will, whereof this is the summe. “The King commanded hath that now without delaie, “Within this place I should not misse thy life to take awaie. “And that thou maist be sure the King hath thus decreed; “Lo here are letters from his grace, which letters thou shalt read. With that he plucked forth a Pistoll readie bent Full charged, and to Massons heart now readie to be sent. The speeches of Mass? de Riuers vttered before his deth. “My friend (said Masson) staie, on me some pitie take: “And to my God, ere that I die, let me my praiers make. “I meruaile whie the King this murder should intend; “I know not anie thing wherein his lawes I did offend. “It doth become a King a Princelie heart to haue: “And not vniustlie for to kill the people he should saue. “And what are you that can the vncondemned kill? “And what are you that seeke my life, which neuer ment you il? “And why should you desire to suck my guiltlesse blood, “Which in the Lord vnto my power haue soght to do ye good? “But staie; I know the cause: you hate the shining light “Of Gods eternal Truth, which now you thinke doth shine too bright. “But frend take heed how that thou welter in the dark “Take heed of Gods eternall, plague &amp; Cayns accursed marke. “The men that meate refuse with famine shalbe pinde, “To satisfie their hungrie soules, they shall no comfort finde. “And they that knowen Truth doo wilfullie reiect, “Shalbe deceiude by lying sprites their follies to correct. “I weigh not for to die, sith death the Lord hath sent; “But more to view thy wretched state it maketh me lament; “For after death with me I know it shall be well; “But for this murder thou maist feare least thou be sent to hell. “There is a fearfull lawe, let it be rightlie scand; Numb. 35. 23. The Lord himself hath trulie said that blood pollutes the land.” God is so mindful of blood wr?gfullie shed, that he maketh dumbe creatures to demaund vengeance thereof. The Land from bloodie guilt shall not be cleansde or quit,” But by his blood which wrongfullie the murder did commit.” Take heed therefore (good frend) and yet beware in time,” Pollute not this so famous place with this so bloodie crime.” But yet if thou obey a Princes wicked word,” Know in the end that thou likewise shalt perish by the sword.” Now if my hoarie haires no mercie can procure;” Yet let the safetie of thy soule to pitie thee allure.” And if the wailing teares of this my wofull wife,” Can not by anie meanes preuaile with thee to saue my life;” Yet see these sillie babes, and weigh their wofull mone,” Which fatherlesse before their time should now be left alone.” If nothing yet but blood can quench thy hot desire,” Then in the ende be sure to tast the Lords reuenging ire.” Haue mercie Lord on me, whom Sathan would destroie;” Thy godlie flocke he seekes to quell, thy Truth for to annoie.” Let them not longer Lord exalt their pridie crowne:” Let th? not scape that dailie seek to throw thy kingdom down.” Thy promise is my hope, thy word is all my staie:” My comfort is the liuing Lord, which shields me from decaie.” While Christ is on my side by faith that makes me free,” By death or life I little feare what man can doo to me.” To thee my liuing God for mercie now I call,” So in this place my promisd vowes shalbe performed all.” O Lord receaue my soule, the force of death destroie,” That presentlie before thy face I may appeare with ioy.” O Christ thy pitie send, with mercie come to me;” For from my youth &amp; tender yeres my hope hath bin in thee.” My heart is fixed Lord, my heart is surelie set;” To saue my soule (my God) let not my sinnes be anie let.” Now to thy blessed hands whether I die or liue:” My sinfull soule, receiue it Lord, I gladlie here doo giue.” “And thou that hether camest to plaie this bloodie part; “Loe this thy wicked deed I doo forgiue with all my hart: “Desiring God that this my blood now set at large, “Vvhen he doth come maie not at all be laid vnto thy charge. “Come staie no longer now if God shall giue thee power “To take my life, th? welcom thrice this sweet &amp; happy hower; His wife he kissing bade her sorow to repell, Vvith her his babes he did imbrace, and bade them al farewel. But Lord what rolling teares, what shrikes and piteous cries Betweene the wife and louing babes were sent to airie Skies. But this could not perswade the traitor to depart, Vvho framde his readie dagg to strike pore Masson to the hart. Then Masson kneeling downe, content his life to leaue; The bullet meeklie to his breast from Pistoll did receaue. Vvhere falling to the ground, his blessed life did yeeld Vnto the Lord, with quiet heart as meeke as anie childe. Vve see what worthie men the Papists haue destroid, God grant vs grace that doo remaine their treasons to auoide. Amen. The Iudgement of the Lorde against this bloodie and periured King of France, Charles the 9. Dilated by the sentence of God in the lawe against murder; by examples both out of the Scriptures, &amp; other Authors, concerning the horrible end that hath fallen vpon wilfull murderers; and lastlie, the bloodie death of this blood-sucking King himselfe. Now let vs see the ende of this periured King, And let vs weigh in future time what fearfull fruite did spring From falsed faith. And first I brieflie will repeate The sentence of the mightie God gainst murder and deceate. Then shall we plainlie see how that in euerie land The Lord according to his law with just reuenging hand The bloodie tyrants strikes, with all their faithlesse crue; As by examples we maie see of such as shall ensue. Vvho so saith God shall shed the blood of man in vaine, Gen. 9. 6. Shall with the shedding of his blood requite the same againe. And he that by deceite his Exod.21.14. Numb. 35. 20. The blood of man is of so great price with the Lord, that be wil not onelie require it of men, but also of the very dumbe creatures. Gen 9.5 neighbour shall betraie, Or shall with guile presumptuouslie his brother seeke to slaie: He shall not scape, although he to the altare flie. But Ioab the wilfull murderer, was taken fr? the altar by Salomon &amp; slaine. 1. King. 2.3.1. drawen foorth he iustlie shall without all pitie die. Such cursed bloodie men Gods plague doth follow still; For wicked King Abimelech slew 70 of his brethren, &amp; raigned as king Iud.9.5 at last be perished by the iust iudgement of God. Abimelech who was content to kill His seuentie brothers all the kingdome for to haue: From just reuenge he could not long his cursed carkasse saue. For from a womans hand a milstone downe was sent Fr? off a wall: which with the weight his brain pan al to rent. Iudg. 9 53. 54 And after by his Page was thrust vnto the heart With sword, lest that a wom?s stroke his glory shuld subuert. As Tripbon beeing Tutor and chief counsellor vnto yong king Antiochus, and bauing deuised with himself a plot of conspiracie to kill his master, thoght that Ionathan being hie priest of the Iewes, would be a hinderance vnto this attempt, being a frend vnto Antiochus. Therfore Triphon feining great fr?dship vnto Ionathan, with flattering words so trained him by trust, that hee perswaded him of 40 thousand men which Ionathan broght with him, that be should sende awaie all sauing one thousand: with which small companie when he was entered into the Citie Ptolemais vnder trust of assured promise to haue to Citie deliuered vnto him by Triphon: and being come within the gates, hee was by Triphon taken prisoner, and all his men slaine 1. Maccab. 12.41 Iosephus Antiquit, lud lib. 13.cap.10. Triphon did intrap with face of frendlie cheere Good Ionathan, to whom he did a faithfull frend appeare: So did he quicklie feele the weight of falsed word, Who shortlie was by Simon but Triphon inioyed not this trecherie long: for he was still cruellie pursued by Simon the brother of Ionathan, &amp; at last in Apania was taken &amp; put to the sword. Whose trecherie was a right picture of K. Charles his villanie. slaine, and iustlie put to sword. I read also of one Aristobolus after he had put his mother &amp; brother to death, greeued in conscience, fell into such horrible extremitie, that blood came from him both by vomit &amp; otherwise til it brought him to his end. Aristobolus by name, Who hath for murder left behinde a blacke &amp; bloodie fame. For first he did consent with famine for to pine His mother, for because she would the kingdome not resigne. And also was content by death to make away Antigonus his brother deere, which was his owne decaie. For when the deed was done, he felt a present griefe In conscience for so cruell act; which then without reliefe Did dailie so torment his sore afflicted hart, That fresh remorse did often giue new cause of greater smart. At length from The Image of K Charles his judgment. grislie corse his blood by peacemeale came; For brothers blood fr? earth did call his blood to quit the same And thus in fearfull wise he yeelded vp his breath: So was his fierce &amp; wicked life repaide with worthie death. Our Charles the 9 by the just stroke of Gods reuange died of bleeding at al parts of his bodie where was anie issue. Charles like vnto this from Gods reuenging hand By bloodic death, repaies the blood he shed within his land. From eares, from nose, fr? mouth, from hart that was so stout, Fr? euery part his blood was seen, wher blood might issue out. The man that would not yeeld when men did mercie craue, For mercie cries vnto the Lord but mercie none can haue. For he that will not help the poore when they dooth call, Shall call himselfe when he hath need, &amp; not be heard at all. The heart that was so proud, now feeles the bitter paine Whereat he iested when he saw his faithfull subjects slaine. The eares that would not heare the poore afflicted crie; But greedelie to sucke their blood would credit euerie lie, With blood are stopped vp that they shall heare no more: Such heauy plagues for wicked men the Lord hath stil in store. The mouth that would not speake to doo his brother good, In steed of words doth vomit out the clotts of filthie blood. The nose that did detest of Truth the pleasant smell, From filthie heart doth willinglie the stinking blood expell. So that we plainlie see, that blood for blood doth craue, And he shall not escape that seekes his brothers blood to haue. Then cursed be the mouth and Christopher Thaune President of the Parliament, with a wicked Oration commended the K for that he had by treason and flattery now ouercome them, whom by arms be could not vanquish. man that did perswade This wretched King that he was in a good and godlie trade, In that he did by guile the godlie so allure: And afterwards by treason did their wished death procure. Much like said he you be to Lewes the II was wont to say, Qui nescit dissimluare. nescit regnare, he that cannot dissemble, knoweth not howe to raigne. Lewes which heretofore Said in the Latine that he knew one sentence &amp; no more. Which was; That he which Truth in words will alwaies bring, And not dissemble; knoweth not the skill to be a King. Naie The riht iudgment of the godlie concerning this bloodie Act. this was rather like the red and cruell raigne Of Mithridates caused with one letter 150000. Romanes to be slaine. Mithridates, who did cause of Romanes to be slain A hundred fiftie thousand once by message that was sent, Wh? outwardlie there did appear nothing but frendship m?t. The King of Peter of Arrag? slew 8000.Frenchm?. Arragon like mate of cursed crue, By like deceit in Sicill once eight thousand Frenchmen slew. To Philip of Macedon suffred miserie by breaking often his oath. Philip once it was his ruine and his death: In that he often brake his oath, and vow of plighted faith. Then happie is the man, that timelie can beware Of Popish treason, which doth seeme great fauor for to beare. The Conclusion of the French Pilgrime vnto English man. “Now have you heard at large the chiefe of bruted broile, “That lately for the Truth hath bin in France my natiue soil. “The Lord grant England peace and mercie from aboue, “That from the Truth no trouble may their fixed heart remoue “With wished life and health Lord long preserue and keepe “That Noble Queene Elizabeth chiefe Pastor of thy sheepe: “And that she maie finde out, and hunt with perfect hate “The Popish hearts of fained frends before it be too late: “And that in wofull France the troubles that we see, “To England for to shun the like, may now a warning be. “And where our wound is seene as yet so fresh to bleede, “Lord grant to England that they maie in time take better heede. “Now sith you doo perceaue of France the wofull case; “Good sir I pray you giue me leaue to seeke some other place. “I feare that I haue staid and charged you too long, “In warping forth these bloodie broiles in rude &amp; rustick song. The Englishman to the French Pilgrime. “Not so good trend, but if with me thou wilt remaine; “I shall not think it anie charge, nor count it anie paine “To heare and keepe thee still: but if thou wilt depart, “For thy discourse take this reward, &amp; thanks fr? frendlie hart. “And so (my frend) farewell, Lord shield thee from annoy, “And grant vs al that we may meete with Christ in perfect ioy Amen. Lord Tesus Christ, the praise be thine: For blessing of this worke of mine. Anna Dowriche. Give God the praise. Veritie purtraied by the French Pilgrime. From Seate supernall of cœlestiall Icue Descended Truth, deuoid of worldlie weed; And with the brightnesse of her beames she stroue Gainst Sathan, Sinne, &amp; Adams fleshlie Seed; Reproouing wrongs, bewailing worldlings need; Who thinke they swim in wealth (blinded by guile): Yet wanting Truth; are wretched, poore &amp; vile. The World reproou'd; in rage attempts hirwracke, Sathan assists, malicious Men deuise Torments for Truth, binde scourges at hir backe, Exclaime against hir with blasphemous cries; Condemning hir, exalting earthlie lies: Yet no despite or paine can cause hir cease; She wounded, springs; bedeckt with crowne of Peace.
