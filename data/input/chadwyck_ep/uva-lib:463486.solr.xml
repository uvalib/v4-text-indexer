      <field name="fulltext">TO My Honoured Friend RICHARD CULMNE OF CANALEE, In the County of DEVON, Esq;</field>
      <field name="fulltext">THE HISTORY OF Dimagoras, Interwoven with the History OF AMORONZO AND CELANIA. BOOK I. When Argalus no longer could abide 'Tis greif, not news to say, Parthenia dy'd; Fates sad Decrees are not to be rever'st Oth liv'd, both lov'd, both dy'd, and that's the worst, But that which non-plust most that troubled Age, Was that Dimagoras out-liv'd the rage Of much incensed Argalus, whose fame For noble Acts, advanc'd his honor'd name Almost beyond extr'ordinary, and made Conquest grow customary, yet 'tis said That poor perplexed Argalus lay dead Buried in greif, whilst vile Dimagoras fled Unprosecuted, and for this respect Some say Parthenia charg'd him with neglect; But 'tis well known that Authors may incline To errors, by mistake, and so does mine: But this suspected matter is best try'd By real hearted Lovers that abide The like misfortune, for Parthenia's breath Blasted with greif was fading into death, And should distressed Argalus then goe From his dear-dying Love, to seek a Foe He knew not where, alas! he was at strife Whether to lose Parthenia, or his life; Suppose he had, to prosecute his rage, Usurpt a sad and groaning pilgrimage, And left his dear affections to the care Of her own thoughts, then crowded with despair, What then? at his return he might have found His labour lost, Parthenia under ground: But I'le desist, and recollect my thoughts, That Love is only rare, that has no faults. 'Tis not my taxe to treat upon the dead, But to persue Dimagoras that's fled, We know not where, yet close persuit and time May bring reward to his unheard of Crime. My blood-hound Muse shall ransack all about Till we have found this worst of Villains out, And then we'le give what we can best afford, A pen oft times cuts deeper then a Sword. Frightn'd with his own fears, Dimagoras flies He knows not where, and in his flight he cryes He knows not why, and in his cryes, he vents A flood of tears, then deep-mouth'd oaths prevent A further deluge, then a curse succeeds That hoast of oaths, and then he thinks his deeds Are so Authentick, that he needs not flye, Nor fear, nor swear, nor curse, nor grieve, nor dye; But having claim'd the respite of a pause, He thus discourst, Dimagoras thy cause Is just and good, disturb not then thy mind 'Tis fit that men, when women prove unkind, Should be as cruel, 'tis well known, thy fame Thy worth, thy honor, might have lay'd a claim To her deserts, what though her beauty swell'd Beyond a Venus, what though she excell'd Her Sex in wit, what though her ample parts Did ravish, nay monopolize the Arts? Art thou not rich, and great? is not thy Land Unbounded, nay, and canst not thou command Armies to wait thy pleasure? and wilt thou Basely degenerate, and fondly bow Unto a womans frowns, 'twas but a deed Proportion'd to her fault, and wilt thou bleed These inward drops? come, contemn thy pain And grief, thou canst not act it or'e again. Did not her tender hearted Mother grieve To see thy sorrows, lab'ring to relieve Thy sad extreamities, did not her care, Her skill, her wit, endeavor to prepare Parthenia's heart, and yet obdurate she Learn'd to deny, by importunitie: Her mother oft would say, ah who can find The vast dimensions of a womans mind, There's not a day, an hour, much less a minute, That brings them not an alteration in it: They're like unfixed Stars, that always move, They hate to day, what they to morrow love: But if the influence of one single Star, Can so disorder man to make him jarr With his own reason, nay, bid sense adieu, Oh! what will then a Constellation do: Thus walking, talking, pausing altogether, His heedless feet brought him he knew not whither But gazing towards the West, he soon espy'd The aged day was grown so heavy-ey'd, That being almost destitute of Light, It shrunk away, and bid the world good-night; Whil'st silent Vesper modestly exprest A speedy reason for approaching rest, To which Dimagoras yielding, soon repos'd Upon his Mothers virdent lap, and clos'd His slumbring eye lids, whil'st the whispering wind And the conspiring leaves, as t'were combin'd To grace his slumbers, but his panting breast Being grown Stranger to accustom'd rest, Denotes an inward conflict; for each part Seems to disclaim the motions of his heart, And at the twy-light of his dawning eye His ears were entertained with a cry Half drown'd in tears, and then a drilling tone Would seem to be a trebble to each groan, But at the last, these cryes, these groans, encreas'd Into a voice distinct, and after ceas'd Their wordless tones, and being well refin'd Into a speech they cry'd Oh thou unkind And most accursed Catiffe, dost thou live T'out-brave revenge, or cannot vengeance give Reward to villany, or hast thou got A counter-mand to contradict thy lot, Or are the Gods forgetful, can they see A vessel laden with impiety And yet not sink it, or did they create thee Without a Soul, and so forget to date thee? Is there no time for punishment; Oh thou That thinkst thy self secure, and wilt allow Of no contrition, know the time draws near When horrid-ill-shap'd Vengeance shall appear Ugly, beyond it self, and shall express The life of horror in a lively dresse, She's now attiring, and her robes shall be Flame-colour'd, trim'd with lavish tyranny, Her hair dishelving from her flaming head Shall be hot-burning wyre, which shall be spread Over her spacious shoulders; in her face Shall be black spots of envy and disgrace, Her eyes like fatal Comets, shall out flame Two Firmaments of Brimstone, and thy name Shall by the dreadful thunder of her tongue Startle, even Hell it self, and live among T'infernal Furies, and for ever be An adding plague unto their misery; Thy woes shall swell into so large a score That quick invention shall invent no more. Even as the weather-glass, which being prest By a warm hand, its water cannot rest But shrinks away, and hides it self, as 'twere Within it self, yet will at last repair (The hand remov'd) into its proper place, Even such was sad Dimagoras his case, His Spirits shrunk away being touch'd with fear, His fear persu'd with guilt, made him appear A senseless living statue, yet at length Receiving some of his declining strength He rais'd himself, and with a feeble tone Began to speak; had not a sudden groan Prevented th'inundation of his words He had proceeded, but his grief affords No speedy utt'rance, therefore he was forc'd To walk, and leave the matter undiscours'd. Thus walking to and fro his trembling brest Strongly inclin'd him to a second rest, But his perswasive fears would not allow The least refreshment to his willing brow; At last oppressed with a sudden gail Of sighs, his wearied feet began to fail, And in a melancholly valley, there Repos'd Dimagoras, but not his fear, His fear instructs him that his eyes behold Strange visions, &amp; his trembling heart grows cold For as the Sea which cannot be at peace Upon a sudden, though the tempest cease Even so Dimagoras, though the former blast Of his fierce rage was moderately past, Yet his innated violence was such, That like the living plant, at every touch He shrunk into despair, and here we find The dangerous Issues of a troubled mind: And thus the flames of his encreasing fires (Blown by the bellows of his own desires) Consumes his reason, and his former deeds Present themselves, he raging thus proceeds. Oh ye immortal Powers, why have ye sent So much of trouble, and so small content Into my boiling breast, ah must my life Become a woful Laborinth of strife! Why do I live? since every moment brings A thousand Serpents, with ten thousand stings To torture me, and whilst I study why And what I live for, I despair to dye? What greater curse than this did ere attend Mortality, how often must I spend My sighs, my groans upon the idle air, And hear no other language but despair, Despair, and dye Dimagoras, 'tis a death Nay worse, to live, go quarrel with thy breath: Didst thou not hear thy most unequal'd Fate Thund'red, nay worse, into thy eares of late, Yet do'st thou dare to live, resolve, and dye, And make the Devil guilty of a Lye. Dost thou observe how yonder spreading tree Would fain be proud to bear such fruit as thee, Take courage in thy ruine, haste away, He feeds a danger most that loves delay, And he that lives for fear of being dead, Spins out his grief unto the smallest thread. What greater torment is then self-grief? And what more Charity then self-relief? Triffle no more, 'tis childish to complain, And easier far to dye than live in pain. Courage Dimagoras, come, march towards that place Of speedy ease with a delightful grace; Dost thou relent, what has a sudden wind Rais'd a new tempest in thy stormy mind? Wilt thou recede, fye, fye, spur up thy will To a more certainty, why stand'st thou still? Let not the dull commands of flesh and blood Deterre thy heart from so approv'd a good. Suppose thou sawst a wretch stretchd out at length Upon the rack, and having spent his strength In tedious groans, yet would refuse to be (Though much entreated) set at liberty; Wouldst thou not stile him mad, and say his grief Was due desert that should deny relief So freely proffer'd; Is not now thy case The very same, thou knowst thou mayst displace Thy Sorrows in a moment, yet thy heart Combines with fear, and will not let them part; Resolve, resolve, and let thy speedy breath Express, 'tis better dye, than live in death. Thus said, and thus resolv'd, he wastes no time, But with extended armes, attempts to climb The lofty tree, but ere he could aspire Unto the height of his too rash desire, His trembling arms disclaim'd their idle hold And down he fell, and being down, his cold And much affrightned senses thought it fit To leave him reason equal to his wit. There lay new-dropt-Dimagoras, till a Knight And his enamored Lady put to flight By adverse fortune, chanc'd to passe that way Where dead, (as they suppos'd) Dimagoras lay, But Fate Decreed it otherwise; for now His almost sensless thoughts were pausing how He came so low, nor could he think or tell How he climb'd up the Tree, nor how he fell, But turning on his back, his dazzled sight Seem'd to assure him that the armed Knight Was daring Argalus, and when his eye Observ'd the beauteous Lady standing by, His trembling heart inforc'd his tongue to say Oh Argalus, oh wrong'd Parthenia! And there he stopt, as if his heart had swore After Parthenia's name to speak no more, But yet the pleasure of her name did seem Like a reviving Cordial to redeem His senses from captivity, and thus Outragiously he cryed, O Argalus! Oh most divine Parthenia, here, here, lyes The perfect mirror of all villanies, 'Twas I, 'twas I, conducted by the flame Of my own lust, and clothed with the shame Of my own crimes, that did attempt to do A deed, that none but Hell, advis'd me to: 'Twas I, 'twas wretched I, that did commence A wicked suite against thine Innocence! Ah poor Parthenia, how did I delude Thy ravish'd mind, and barbarously intrude Upon thy privacy, and made thee know (Instead of bliss expected) perfect woe; Thy heart conceived that the joyful summe Of all thy hopes, thy Argalus was come, But all in vain, for thy deceived Love Met with a Serpent seeking for a Dove. Could I restore—And there his feeble voice Chang'd, and recoy'ld into a dreadful noise: With that the Knight being suddenly amaz'd Stood silent for a time, and only gaz'd Upon this dreadful object, but at length. Being bold in courage, he imploy'd his strength To raise him from the earth, which having done Bold in a new attempt, he thus begun. What art thou, say what art thou, that dost thus Unman thy self to be afraid of us That would be courteous, and redress thy grief Wouldst thou be capable of our relief; Let thy dull reason credit what we say, I am not Argalus, nor I Parthenia Reply'd the Lady: At which words he rais'd His frenzy head, and for a while he gaz'd, And then his lavish tongue began to cry Oh Argalus, oh blest Parthenia, why Why do ye thus torment a Ghost that strayes It knows not where, these unaccustom'd ways Prove dreadful to me, but me thinks I spye By those pale looks ye' are Ghosts as well as I: Oh do but hand me to the Elizian plains Where ye recide, and lead me from these pains, These racks, these tortures, oh what torments wait Upon the ruines of a cursed state, But stay, me thinks I see—And there his eyes Decay'd, and seemingly Dimagoras dyes: The courteous Knight perceiving by discourse It was the strength of passion did divorce His senses from their faculties, grew sad To think no means, no med'cine could be had To bring him from his trance, till at the last His charitable Lady that had past Much time in trouble, having heard the vain And strange effusions of his idle brain, Takes forth a glasse, within whose brittle wall There was inclos'd a Spirit could recall Revolted sense, then with a stretch'd out hand She calls her Page, and gives him strict command To take the glasse, and presently convey Some drops into his mouth, and hast away: The trembling Page with an affrighted look (Obedient to his Ladyes pleasure) took The proffer'd glass, and with a fearful speed Approach'd Dimagoras and perform'd the deed, Which being done, Dimagoras compos'd Of nothing less then reason, soon disclos'd His buried eyes, and gazing round about (Pufft up with rage) his fury thus broke out, Ye dreadful Tyrants is there all extent, No diminution of my punishment; Must I Epitomize your Plagues, did I To humour you, thus play the fool, and dye Before my time, I thought in pleasing you To consummate those plagues which now renew: I'm licenc'd by my torments, and I'le chide Your dam'd injustice, were not you my guide That led me hither, did not you advise me To kill my self, and will ye thus dispise me? Must plagues be my reward, must I be plough'd And harrow'd with my torments, not allow'd A minutes ease, are these, are the gains That I was largely promis'd from my pains? Oh Hell, and there his well-oath'd tongue let fall A liberal showr, then he begun to call Upon Parthenia, oh Parthenia, thou That I abus'd on earth, how doest thou now Plague my abuses, oh that I could boast Of so much comfort, as to see thy Ghost And ask forgiveness, how content I'd lye In the dull shades of blind obscurity, I know, I know, thy patience would engage Thy Argalus to mittigate his rage: Alas, my suff'rings much out run the power Of my distracted patience, every hour Brings every Plague, oh how I am opprest, Parthenia's pardon gives Dimagoras rest, But ah in vain, with that his gazing eye Staring about did suddenly espye His former objects which rejoyc'd him more Then all his tortures tortur'd him before: It was that amorous Pair which only stay'd T'expect the Issue, whilst Dimagoras made (After obeisance) more then usual speed, And on his bended knees did thus proceed, Oh ye immortal Ghosts that do inherit Th'Elizian plains with a contented spirit, Deign to behold, and do not frown to see Your Prostitute upon his bended knee Craving your pardon, which if I obtain 'Twill prove Physitian to a world of pain, Deny me not, but ah Parthenia move In my behalf, thy dear, thy dearest Love, Thy constant Argalus, let him not rest Till he has granted my enforc'd request: At which the Knight, turning his head aside, To break a long-keept smile; Dimagoras cry'd Oh Argalus do not remove those sweet, Those pleasing looks, but let my sorrows meet, With thy calcining pity, pity take Though not for mine, yet for Parthenia's sake. Whereat the Knight (whose ears could not abide The fierce Artillery of his tongue) reply'd, Vain Self-deluder why dost thou devest Thy troubled Spirits of their liberal rest? Thy actions have inform'd me, and I can Declare, thou art no Ghost, nay scarce a man, Forget thy folly, strive to banish hence Thy idle fancies, and recall thy sense Into its proper Sphere, and cease to be Deluded into cruel vanity; Come hither, take my hand, and you shall find That I am tangible, and that my mind Is troubled for thee, view me well, and see If thou canst call to mind my Phisnomie, Observe this tender Lady, and you'l know Whether she be Parthenia or no; Nay start not back, approach, such Ghosts will do No harm at all, especially to you: At which Dimagoras with a fixed eye Star'd in her lovely face, and seem'd t'espye Something he knew, but yet his troubled sense (Much discomposed) could not say from whence Those Fancies should arise, but yet at length Having arrived to a little strength Of long absented reason, he confess'd His shameful folly, whilst he thus exprest: I am unghosted, and I now behold What my amazed senses lately told My heart ye are, and if I do mistake Pardon I crave for Amoronzo's sake Rare beauty: and if my request hall seem Absurd, oh Amoronzo stand between Your dear Celania's anger, and my brest; For if she frown Dimagoras lives unblest: With that, much-pleased Amoronzo took Dimagoras by the hand, and with a look As stedfast as his heart, he thus begun; Unfortunate Dimagoras thou hast run A most preposterous course, for at this time Thy Land is in an uproar, and the crime Falls upon thee, the blood that has bin spilt Cryes out aloud, and testifies thy guilt; Return, return, and let thy warlike hands Mow down the courage of th' Arcadian bands, Thy absence gives advantage, every hour Thou stay'st, thou givest addition to their power, Nay wonder not, nor do not stand to grieve Or shake thy head, but practise to believe Believe thy friend: And if thy low-ebb'd Fate Wants those materials that become thy state, Thou hast a friend, a friend, that will impart The secrt Counsels of a faithful heart, And if my weak instructions will allow Advantage to thy will, I'le teach thee how Thou shalt redeem thine honour, let's repair To more conveniency, and I'le declare: To which Dimagoras (being now supply'd With an indifferent reason) thus reply'd; True Friend, your words distilling from a brest So full of truth instructs me not to jest With my own fortune, I confess, the late And sad disturbance of my inward state Hath made me much incapable to be A Favorite to my self; but since I see Your liberal goodness which does truly tend To my advice, Il'e own you as my friend; And if my future fortunes chance to fall In ballance with my wish, I only shall Gaze at a distance, with a pleasing view, And look upon those fortunes through you; But since extreamities does now require Action, not words, I'le cease, and we'l retire; But stay, I know not where, for since that day I lost my self, I never found my way, But hark, what noise is this that seems t'affright My new-come sense, come, let's provide for flight; Flight, oh most horrid, oh most dismall word That cuts and wounds much deeper then a Sword, (Reply'd the Knight) and if I meet with Foes That dare encounter, I shall dare oppose Could they command the Cyclops to impail And guard them round, I'd dye, or else prevail; Look here Dimagoras (taking by the hand His dear Celania, canst thou understand These speaking looks, whose very thoughts advance The dullest Soul above the reach of chance; But let's retire, for hark, the noise I hear Encreases more, because it draws more near; Let's hast to yonder valley, where a while I'le leave my dear Celania to beguile The time with Prayers, and if you please, my Lord Dimagoras, but to favour and afford Your chearful company to my divine And dear Celania, you will much incline My heart to thank you; and for thee my sweet And most indulgent Love, could I but meet With thy consent, how quickly would I fly Upon my Foes, and bring thee victory, But ah those silent Streames that trickle down Thy too too liquid Cheeks do almost drown My hopes in deep despair, thy tears (my Dear) Are worse then poysned darts, and do appear Like Seas (but more outragious) for the flood Of thy moist eye is not to be withstood, And if the sullen world would learn t'invent A way to kill me, let it but consent To woe thee to a tear, a frown, a cry, And let me see't, and then, I conquer'd dye, Then clear those clouded Skies, and let me see The Sun-shine of a smile, and I will be More joyful then those Persians which adore The rising Sun, grant this, I'le ask no more, Nor canst thou grant a greater boon then this, For ah thy smiles, my Joy, are all my bliss, Ah do not speak in tears, nor let a glut Of sighs make sorrow cheap, each sigh does cut My very intralls, and my wounded heart Transfixt with briny tears begins to smart; 'Tis in thy power t'extenuate my cares, Cure me with smiles, or kill me with thy tears. Have ye not seen with what a watry eye After a shower the Sun begins to prye Upon the earth, as if his bashful ray Were grown asham'd to look upon the day, Even so Celania gazed on the face Of Amoronzo with a bashful grace, Before the lustre of whose eye there stood (Ready to be dissolv'd into a flood) Some Chrystall bubbles which Eclip'st her light, And sometimes dropt, yet would not rain downright But at the last, poor Lover, she confines Her tears, and for a time she spoke by signs, But when she saw that Amoronzo went To arm himself, sad Lady, then she sent Both words, and sighs, and tears, whilst in her arms She held him fast, and thus begun her charms. Dear Amoronzo why dost thou deceive me, Pretend to love, and yet intend to leave me, Oh speak my joy, tell me my high-priz'd Treasure What have I done to merit thy displeasure? Alas thy poor Celania never knew Disloyal flames, and when she proves untrue To Amoronzo, may she ever be A Prostitute to lustful villanie; But ah (my Dearest) say what mean those Arms Those Symptomes of departure, what Alarms Hath lately frightned thee to these extreames, 'Tis too, too true, oh that they were but dreams: Thou shalt not go, oh pity my sad heart, I'd rather dye, then let my life depart. The trembling wretch that's thrown into the deep Unsensible of what he does, will keep Fast hold of what he takes, as loath to dye, Ah so does he my Love, and thus do I: Couldst thou but spell my sighes &amp; read my tears, Thou soon wouldst apprehend how many fears Flow in upon me, for alas I know Nothing but grief (my Dear) thou shalt not go. Oh that my tears were manacles to bind thee Unto my Soul, then were I sure to find thee, Dear do not leave me, but let pity move Thy hand to kill, or else thy heart to Love, For be assur'd there's nothing can delay My speedy ruine, but thy speedy stay; But since thy pleasure must be done, not mine, Dear Amoronzo I must thus—decline And so farewell. Thus being almost drown'd In floods of grief, she gently kist the ground; With that the almost broken-hearted Lover Whose dear affections caus'd him to discover A world of sorrow, rais'd her from the ground And with the Balsom of a kiss made sound Her bleeding heart, and when he had divorst Rude Passion from her sense. He thus discourst. Tell me my dear Celania, why dost thou Intail such sorrows on thy stormy brow, Believe me Dearest, if I should deny To love thy virtues, I deserv'd to dye: The convertible terms of life and love Meet both in me, my Joy, and if I prove Unkind to thee, oh may all Plagues combine To meet in one, and afterwards prove mine; Dost thou not hear how danger does approach And will, if not prevented, soon encroach Upon our safeties, therefore, now, my Dear, Let loose my close-lockt arm, and stay thou here Till my return, which questionless will be Crown'd with the joy of happy victorie, Sigh not my Dear, believe't, each sigh propounds Unto my Soul more then a thousand wounds, Come let this welcome parting kiss express And seal th' assurance of a good success. Farewell, farewell ? ? Dimagoras all this while Stood lab'ring, as it were, to reconcile Himself to his own thoughts, but wit and art Were in-sufficient to defend his heart From servile fear, his very Looks exprest The dismall horrour of a throbbing brest, Although to him no danger could appear, He fear'd, because he know not what to fear, So he that should have taught Celania's heart To rest contented, caus'd his own to smart And with a trembling hand he smote his brest, He sigh'd, nay worse, he sobb'd, and thus exprest. Shall triffling honour make me to dispose My life unto the pleasure of my Foes: Suppose that Amoronzo chance to fall In this encounter, how should I inthrall Both life and safety, for when they shall see Celania accompany'd with me, Their present fury will be sure to light Upon my head, I'le therefore save by flight What I shall lose by stay, but if so be That Amoronzo should return, and see His dear Celania weeping all alone And I (suppos'd her Comforter) am gone, What then? but I'le not stay, me-thinks I hear A thousand Swords now clashing in my ear; Farewell to Antique honour, 'tis at life I aim, I hate this honourable strife, Ile hasten to yon Cave, and there I'le lye And hug my self in blest security. Dimagoras being gone, there seem'd t'arise A glimmering joy, (which blusht through extasies Of grief and care) In poor Celania's face, Glad that Dimagoras had left the place: But this, this short-liv'd joy did quickly end, Her thoughts being busied on her absent friend, Her sad expecting heart begun to grow Into extreams, her pallid lips let flow A flood of language: If the Reader please T'observe the streams, they are most sadly these. Ah me, and then she sigh'd, alas, and there She wept, sad heart, and then she dry'd that tear With a suceeding sigh: Oh stormy weather! She wept, and sigh'd, she sigh'd, &amp; wept together, The sensless rocks at each alternate groan Did seem to Sympathize, and sadly moan; My Dear, my Life she cryes, my All, nay more, If more may be, oh how I could adore Thy empty shaddow, but I wish in vain For that which is impossible to gain, He's gone, he's gone, &amp; there she wrang her hands And tore her hair, whil'st on her cheeks there stands The fruitful Issue of her brim fill'd eyes, To Emblemize her real miseries; She breath'd a while, but only to obtain The more advantage how to grieve again. Have ye observ'd a Tempest how it seems A present calm, yet suddenly redeems A greater force, and with a sturdy blast Gives satisfaction for the time that's past: Even so Celania musters up her fears, Prologu'd with sighes, and Epilogu'd with tears, And with full-blasted sorrow she prevailes Against her self, and thus her self assailes. Her trembling hand tears off her flaxen hair, And smites her Ivory brest, as if it were Ordained for that use, and then she vents In sighes, the grandure of her discontents, And then the tides of passion overflow The banks of reason, she resolves to go She knows not where, but yet the place seems blest Because it entertain'd so sweet a Guest As Amoronzo, nay, the senseless ground Where he had sate, her silent eyes had drown'd In briny floods, at last, her store being spent, Passion prevailed, and away she went; She went away, yet at a distant space She oft would stand, and gaze upon the place, Fuel'd with two extreames, her Soul did burn, First to depart, and after to return, If she departed, then her grief would stray Into a madness that she went away, And if she staid, sorrow would more ensnare Her heart, for Amoronzo was not there: Will it not prove a Paradox to say Celania stay'd, and yet she went away, She had (poor Lady) when she did depart Progressive feet, a retrograding heart, But she is gone, judg, Reader, how opprest Being misfortunes sad, and chiefest Guest, What hand, what Pen can copy out her woe That knows not where, nay, hardly how to go; Is it not pity then to leave her here In a strange place, where all things do appear Like sad Conspirators and there conspire To make encroaching misery intire; Poor Lady I must leave her, yet I know Her pardon will persue me, for I go To meet her Amoronzo, who is now Return'd with conquest shining on his brow: But to relate the combate, or each blow His valour, and the courage of his Foe, Would prove too tedious, 'tis enough that we Find him return'd with dear-bought victorie. Accept kind Reader, what is now exprest, When time shall ripen thou shalt taste the rest. Poor Lover, with what joy his hasty feet Approach'd the place with longing hopes to meet His dear Celania, but his nimble eye Lightning with flamy looks, could not espye His hearts chief Object, then his thoughts begin To be disturb'd, and mutiny within, He now inclines to fear he knows not what, Sometimes he thinks on this, sometimes on that, But at the last with a dejected look He spies her glove, which he most sadly took And recommended to his lips, and there Sate down, and bath'd it in an amorous tear: Thou consort of my Soul sayes he, what place Is now so blest to entertain the grace Of thy delightful presence, oh that I Were half so blest to be a Stander by; Why stay'st thou from me, and dost not appear Thou seemst far off, but yet I hope th'art near; Wrong not my hopes, let me not be forsook, For I am almost famish'd for a look, Appear, appear, and let no longer stay Affront my hopes (my Dearest) come away, Ah must thy longing Amoronzo sit Cloth'd with dispair, why comst not, what, not yet; Not yet, art thou asleep? Then dream my Dear, That thy beloved Amoronzo's here, He's here, and laden with as much distress As either heart can wish, or tongue express; I'le wait a while, perhaps it is thy will To steal upon me unawarres, and fill My thoughts with sudden joy, thou dost me wrong For I expect too soon, thou stay'st too long: With that, he cast his prying eyes about, Hoping to find his dear Celania out, But all in vain, for fortune which did mean To dwell some time upon this troubled Scene, Presented him an object, which indeed Caus'd not his eyes to weep, but heart to bleed: The wind, being then in love, did seem t'adore, And play with that Celania had tore From her distracted head, I mean the fair And bounteous wealth of her neglected hair, Which Amoronzo spying, with a mind Enrag'd he run, and snatch'd it from the wind; Half mad, because quite angry, he begins To take the wind with multiplyed sins. Thou impious nothing, how durst thou (cryes he) Play with a relique of more sanctitie Then can be utter'd, if so be you must Be sportful, go, and wanton with the dust: But thus this Lover minding more the pleasure Of his own fury, lost his new-got treasure; For angry Boreas in a high disdain Inforc'd it from his trembling hand again, Away it flew, he gaz'd, and then begun To start away, resolving to out-run The winged wind, and for Celania's sake He almost lost his breath, to win the Stake, By this approv'd example we may find, The wings of Love, are swifter then the wind. After this first, short conflict, he retreats Unto his former station, where he seats His melancholly self, and then his heart Begins to fall into the second part Of his first grief, that sorrow, which before Spoke all by whispers, now begins to roar, Poor Lover, he despairs, for having found Her gloves, her hair, her partlet on the ground He falls from sighs, to words, from words, to tears From tears, to groans, and then at last despairs: Despair, that worst of evils, now sits crown'd Queen regent in his thoughts, his thoughts abound With several contradictions, nay, the wind Is constant, if compared to his mind, Sometimes he thought, for fear, she had bin fled Into some Cave; and then, he thought her dead: He looks upon her glove, and in conclusion He thought himself into a sad confusion: At last inclining to a serious pause, He then resolv'd Dimagoras was the cause, Then like a fierce Revenger, he persues His name to death, whilst every thought renews Revengful thoughts, &amp; with his sharp-edg'd wrath Wounds him with curses, stabs him with an oath, Accursed hour (cryes he) when first my eyes Observ'd that Monster of all villanies, Could not his former deeds instruct my thoughts To have a care, could not his latter faults, Induce me to distrust him, well, I'le trace The world but I'le revenge this foul disgrace. But ah Celania how can I expect Thy pardon, that have us'd thee with neglect, Unhandsom Fate, if Amoronzo live Heav'ns grant it be to practise how to give A due reward to him whose very name: Poysons my Soul, and fills my cheeks with shame; I'le run, and ransack all the world about Not sparing, Hell it self, to find thee out, And question not but thy malicious fate Will still preserve thee to endure my hate; Good fortune be my guide I'le not delay Nor lavish time, but presently away: Where now we'l leave him, for Dimagoras cryes To be discover'd in his miseries. It so fell out that the Arcadian King And all his Nobles, (as a usual thing For relaxation of their minds) did ride One day a hunting, when there was espy'd A hideous Bear lye lurking in the shade Watching her prey, but that the Huntsmen made A near approach, and with a dexterous Art Did almost wound this Monster to the heart: The Bear thus wounded makes a speedy flight Being close persu'd: The Huntsmen with delight Observ'd her windings, but half spent, she took Into a Thicket, and by chance forsook Her close Persuers, till at last betray'd By her own blood, the careful Huntsmen made What speed they could, and forc'd her to retire Into a Cave, whilst they forthwith conspire T'intrape their gain, making where she should pass A secret Concave mantl'd o're with grass, Stopping all passages, that she must stay Close penn'd up in the Cave, or pass that way: At last she roar'd as able to affright The eager Huntsmen from their close delight; But on a sudden they unstopt the Cave Expecting by her speedy flight, to have The end of their desires, to which intent They watch'd the place &amp; (more then usual) spent An hour in patience, and at last surrounded The Cave, and most confusedly they sounded Their several Horns, but nothing could express The lest resemblance of a quick success: At last th'impatient Huntsmen curst and swore At their ill fortune, thinking to give o're, But yet resolving first to seek about Thinking their ill-lookt Pris'ner might get out At some concealed place, but when their eyes Had satisfy'd their hearts, they soon devise A new design, which questionless had caus'd Th' effecting of their wills had they not paus'd, Or rather started at, a sudden cry That seem'd to be, they know not where, nor why; At last they hearkening with a stricter ear, Being almost half astonished, did hear A dreadful noise, which issued from the Cave And made th' expecting Huntsmen madly rave And curse their Fate, forbearing not to swear It was a man enchaunted to a Bear: Whil'st they were thus discoursing, there appears A Monster (as they thought) compos'd of fears, Who, careless of himself, with speed came running Out of the Cave, perceiving not the cunning Of his amazed Foes, but quickly fell As he suppos'd, into the jaws of Hell, Which they perceiving, soon begun to ban, And vow the Bear was turn'd into a man; Yet for the better satisfaction, they Ran to the Cave, where they observ'd there lay The ugly Monster, buried in the flood, The little Ocean of her reeking blood: Finding her dead, immediately they went Unto the King. declaring the event Of their designs, who forthwith gave command That they in silence for a time should stand About the pit, and there expect that night The future Issue of so strange a sight: Th'obedient Huntsmen nimble to obey Their Kings command made present speed away: And so arriving at the place, they made Silence their friend, which suddenly betray'd Sad groans unto their ears, and doleful cryes, Ballast with oaths, and wing'd with blasphemies: At last they heard a voice, much more enlarg'd And more distinct, which suddenly discharg'd It self into these words, unhappy I, The abstract of unpattern'd villany, Why was I born, since all things thus agree To make compleated misery in me? Or else is life and death late grown at odds, Which shall torment me most? and are the Gods Spectators of my woes? must I endure The Plagues of two such ills, and not procure The least refreshment? ah Parthenia, now Thou takest revenge at large, but when wilt thou Abreviate my Sorrows, that I may See but the twy-light of one smiling day; For now I am in Hell, but here I find No Divel but my self, and yet my mind And Soul is tortur'd, nay I see no light Nor know no darkness, my distracted sight Possesses me with such a double being That I am blind in light, in darkness, seeing, And here I live perplexed with a doubt How I got in, but harder, to get out: How happy had I been, if I had stay'd With sad Celania in the pleasing shade, Perhaps the Gods would then some pity take If not for mine, for their Celania's sake; But I, unhappy wretch, nay most unkind Unto my friend, whose goodness was confin'd To my distress, yet basely did I prove (Prompted by fear) false t' Amoronzo's Love His dear Celania; but alas too late I here bewail my miserable state. Now envy, hatred, malice, all contrive To do your worsts, but keep me not alive, Alas I cannot grieve for what is past, As fast as you torment, I'le curse as fast. Th'impatient Huntsmen, having thus endur'd Their Kings commands, at length were well assur'd The voice was humane, so, they having made Nearer approach, they thus begun, and said. What art thou, say what art thou, thus constraines Our hearts to pity? who is that complains Of his misfortune? If thou art a Man, Desire our aide, we'l help thee if we can, Starve not the issue of a good success, They're fools that must be courted from distress, Be free, and answer, let's not long expect, Favours prove curses when they find neglect: To which he (hearkening with a willing ear, Tim'rous to speak, because afraid to hear) At last reply'd: And can the Gods incline To so much pity? ah this heart of mine Dares not prove so much traytour to the state I am now in, as fondly to create The meanest relish of a hope, for me That am the copy of all miserie, The Current of my woes are too too strong To be resisted, do me not that wrong What e're ye are, as to perswade my brest That I shall ever be so fully blest, As to be meanly miserable, no, My ebb of happiness, must never flow; But if the pleasing Streams of sweet relief Should drop upon me, 'tis beyond belief: Alas I dare not give so large a scope To my own thoughts, to credit my own hope; For 'tis well known (especially to me) The ground of hope is possibility: I'le say no more, he is excus'd to grieve That has no faith to hope, nor to believe: The close Attendants hearing this discourse, Being fully fraught, and laden with remorse, Descend the Pit, desiring him to be Assistant to his own felicitie, But he whose banck-rupt hopes had lately found The horror of despair, could not propound The least of comfort to himself, the more He was perswaded, he the less gave or'e His hellish noise ? ? Ye Furies that are sent curse Cry'd he, to adde unto my punishment, Draw near and hark with what a grace I'le And scorn these Plagues which cannot make me worse Could ye shoot fire and brimstone from your eyes Into my Soul, oh how I would despise Such triffling torments, go, and blush to see Ye are out-divel'd by my miserie; But stay, what strange, what new-created light Is this that courteth my amazed sight? What meanes this sudden change? or does a dream Possess my brain, can nothing but extream Delight or grief assault me, since my Fate Is so much checquor'd, I'le a while await, And with a patient quietness expect Future events, but as for your respects That stand before me, if good fortune chance To fall upon me, I'le not fail t'advance The merit of your worth; for though I lye Lockt in the Arms of tyrant miserie, Yet my estate and ample fortunes are Exuberant to my wish, but I'le forbear This fond discourse, be serious, tell me then, Are ye not Divels in the shapes of men? Pray tell me true? for they that go about To do me good, must strive to help me out Of this Infernal place, that so I may Once more behold the pleasure of a day: To which they said: Sir if you please to trust Your safety in our hands, we will be just, And by a speedy means we'l set you free, From this most sad, and blind captivity; Follow us then, and you shall quickly know That we intend your good, pray let us go. Away they went, and when the welcome light Had blest their eyes, they all imploy'd their sight To gaze upon him, in whose looks they saw That fear kept all his faculties in aw, Away they led him to the King, and told What they had heard, and how he did unfold The nature of his grief, and that his heart (For lost Celania's sake) endur'd a smart Extreamly great, because as he exprest, He left her weeping wofully distrest: He mention'd Amoronzo, and his tongue Declar'd, 'twas he that did Parthenia wrong, Which words we plainly hearing thought it meet, To bring him to be prostrate at the feet Of your renowned Majesty, that so You might by his confession truly know Where fair Celania (your dear Neece) was fled, To which intention we have hither led And here we leave him, joyful that our art Procur'd this news to your concristed heart; At which the King with a delightful look Commands him to him, and when he had took A strict Survey of his most gashful face, He knew it was Dimagoras whose disgrace Made him so odious to the eyes of all The Standers by, that they begun to spawl And spit upon him, biding him confess Where lost Celania was, and what distress He left her in, and then they would incline To moderation, and with speed, confine Their present fury, but if he deny'd What they requir'd, he should prepare t'abide As many plagues as mischief could invent: To which Dimagoras gave a free consent, And said. I saw (I must confess 'tis true) Both Amoronzo and Celania too, But where they were at present did exceed The power of his knowledg, for the speed Of his departure, made him not enquire Of their designs, nor where they would retire; But Amoronzo fled, I know not why, Nor to what place, whil'st sad Celania's eye Drench'd her discolour'd cheeks in briny tears, And with a storm of sighes exprest her fears, But all in vain, for he, hard-hearted he Slighted her sad, her groaning miserie, And so he left her (oh my heart did burn) Without the least engagement to return. He being gone, my weak endeavours strove To make her quit the solatory Grove Wherein he left her, and forbear to vent Such floods of tears for him that was content To leave her in distress, but all in vain, The more I su'd, the less she would retain The good of my perswasions, but did woe My present absence, that her grief might flow Without controlement, so at last I took Unwilling leave, and presently forsook The dismall place, and left her close confin'd To the strict limits of a troubled mind, Poor Lady, thus I left her all alone For ah her looks engag'd me to be gone, And this is all my knowledg can relate Of her (poor Lady) too too ridged state, To which the King, with an enraged brow Reply'd, if this be all you can allow Our expectations, you shall be our guest Till time and torture make you speak the rest; Haste him away, our leisure shall compose A plot to make him speak the truth he knows. Where now we'l leave him, &amp; transplant our eyes From his, to more concerning miseries, I mean our sad Celania, whose distress May cost you tears to read, me to express. The end of the first Book. THE Second Book. Come sad Melpomene, it is thy part To teach me to decipher such a heart As sorrow never knew, nor envious Fate Could ever dare to boast of, till of late; Come, give me tears for ink, and ink, for tears; An iron pen, that may ingrave the fears, The woes of our Celania: Come, be brief, A world of tears may drown a world of grief: And you sad hearted Ladies that have known Th'extreams of love, let now your tears be shown; It is, me-thinks, the least that ye can do, (For every word) to drop a tear or two. Sighs, tears, and groans, were ever known to be Loves proper Method, Cupids Diarie Confirms this truth, moreover, he declares That Lovers hearts are circumscrib'd with cares; If any justly can this truth deny, 'Tis Cupid's in an error, and not I. The Streams of Love run swifter than—but stay Hark, our Celania groans, my Muse, away. Bad tidings makes sad hearts, th'unwelcom news Of her unheard of sufferings cannot chuse But raise a tempest in each tender heart; For she, poor Lady, felt th'increasing smart Of Amoronzo's absence, and her breath Proclaim'd his absence was the present death Of all her comforts, and she wept, as 'twere By Patent, Seal'd with sad and black despair; 'Twas she that taught the Turtle how to morn For her absented Mate, 'twas she, forlorn, Distressed Lady, that did first intice The twatling Eccho to the avarice Of imitation, every groan she spent Out of the Store-house of her brest, was sent Trebbl'd into the world. The Eccho took Such pleasure in her name, that she forsook Her naturall voice, but yet she was to blame So much to wanton with her amorous name Had Amoronzo heard it, earth had bin Too small a circle to contain him in, Nay, and Cèlania too, would often cry, Who dare use Amoronzo's name but I; And thus this babling Nymph would still proclaim And run division on his pleasing name, As if she had (for poor Celania's sake) Cry'd him throughout the world, but could not make Return of his abode, so by consent They both agreed to groan in discontent, Under the shadow of a spreading tree, Whose drooping branches made it seem to be A Nursery of grief, Celania plac'd Her melancholly life, whose presence grac'd The kindness of the place, which now seem'd blest In entertaining so divine a Guest. But by and by, there chanc'd to pass that way A greedy Lyon, roaring for his prey, Who gazing on Celania, made a stand (As if her eyes had given counter-mand To his designs) and star'd upon her face, Whil'st she, whose Innocency gave a grace To every look, undauntedly exprest A welcom entertainment to her Guest: But see what graceful Majesty doth lye Within the circuit of a harmless eye; The Lyon seem'd so satisfied, that he Forgot to hunger, and began to be As 'twere enamor'd, and would not commence His bloody suite against her Innocence, But fawning on her, seemed to express An inward sorrow for her sad distress, Sad Lady, she amazed at the sight Begun as 'twere to take some sad delight In her Companion, and would gently clap His sturdy head which in her tender lap He softly laid, by which we truly see The Lyon and the Lamb may well agree: Nor yet could this strange accident remove Her wandring thoughts from her endeared Love, But still her tears were sadly subsequent Unto her sighes: at last away she went, Leaving (as she suppos'd) her fawning friend Lockt up in sleep ? She had not pac'd much ground, but she espy'd Two, which in running towards her, had discry'd The plenty of her beauty, which enforc'd Their speedy stay, who staying, thus discours'd. 'Tis not to court you Madam, nor to stray Into vain words enforc'd us to this stay, But 'tis t'enjoy our pleasures, therefore do What our perswasions shall advise you to, Or else we shall (to shorten our discourse) What you deny to yield, command by force, At which the Lady (half distracted) cry'd I will not yield, nor can the Gods abide So much impiety, but they will send A speedy vengeance, e're ye can befriend Or satisfie your lusts, the Gods are just, And hate, although it be well worded lust, Therefore desist, except ye will proceed Unto my death, for that's the nobler deed; Kill me, and welcom, but defile me not, Lust is a living stain, and death no blot: To which they both most desperately reply'd They that resolve to do cannot abide The least perswasions, yield, and so deprive Danger of sad effects, nay do not strive Nor cry, for know, this dismall place affords No ears to entertain imploring words, Yield then without compulsion: Give me leave Reply'd Celania, ere ye do bereave And rob me of my treasure, but to take A silent leave of what I must forsake, And then I shall submit unto your lust, Or yield my self a Sacrifice to dust: She stept aside, and cry'd, Heav'n be my shield, I neither dare, nor can, nor will I yield, Look up, look up vile Creatures, and behold A swelling Cloud even ready to unfold It self in vengeance, for ye may be sure The Gods will not behold, and yet endure, Desist, and let your passions be allay'd, For they will shield what they themselves have made, I mean mine innocence, and therefore know I will be chast because they made me so, And they which truly call upon the Gods In their distress, have more than trebble odds Against their Foes. ? ? You rather blow the fire By this discourse, then quench our hot desire They both reply'd, come, come, we have done wrong To our desires in keeping them so long Without their natural food, nay do not strive, Let virtue dye, but keep your self alive: Nay leave those tempting cryes, for know, that ear You call unto, is deaf, and will not hear; Heaven is a great way off: 'Twill so appear To you in mercy, but in Judgment, near, Reply'd Celania; for I'm sure, and know The Gods are just in all their actions—Oh, And as she cry'd that Oh, Oh they discry'd A roaring Lyon which did soon divide Their thoughts from their intents, for they begun To leave their base beginnings and to run To save their lives, repenting of their crime, (Strange alteration in so short a time!) But she, poor Lady, laden with remorse Did, whil'st her time permitted, thus discourse. I grieve, said she, to see the state y'are in, Heavens couchant Judgment, finds your rampant sin, Think not t'avoyd by running what ye'l meet Your hands are now more useful then your feet. 'Tis truth, they both reply'd, and now we must Joyntly confess the Gods are good and just: But see our Executioner draws nigh, And we must yield, for 'tis in vain to flie; With that the Lady (being pity strook) Observe, sayes she, I'le charm him with a look, He shall not hurt; for know, the Gods can be To pity, as to punish equall free; With that, as if her eyes had sent a charm Into the Tyrants heart, he did no harm, But gently lay'd him at her feet, to show The humble meekness of a Convert Foe. Even as the wretch condemn'd, that finds reprieve Cannot at present well forget to grieve, But with a quivering heart, does first display The colours of his joy; even so did they (Both timorously joyful) thus proclaim The goodness of Celania, and their shame. Admired goodness, that can thus engage The angry Gods to mitigate their rage To us, that by just Judgment were decreed To speedy death, but by free mercy, free'd! For which (most divine Lady) unto you (After the Gods) we must acknowledge due The mercy of our lives, for our attempt We here confess, most justly might exempt Your heart from pity, but in you, we found A soveraign Balsom, in our selves a wound, A deadly wound, which to departing breath Is far more harsh, more terrible then death, We see our grim-lookt Martial, how he lyes Subjected at your feet, and dare not rise To execute that fury which is prone To him by nature, but doth now disowne Nature it self, converted to fulfill The gracious pleasure of your virtuous will. Oh what a sudden alteration's bred! Here lyes a Lyon, but his nature's fled! But Madam, since 'tis so, that unto you The worthless tribute of our lives are due, Command us what you please, and you shall find Us ready, nay, and winged like the wind To execute your pleasure, Madam, these Are only words, command us what you please, And by our quick obedience you shall see The true effects of our integritie, Injoyn us to some pennance, that we may T'expiate our crimes be forc'd t'obey, For (pardon our boldness Madam) we discry Hard, and misterious Characters in your eye, Which we, by your permission, will unfold, And tell you that which never yet was told: We'l take the liberty without consent To say, we know you groan in discontent, And so does he, that is the dayly food Of your affections, Madam, 'tis not good To dwell upon delayes; in short, we know You love even to despair, and that your woe Is bleeding new. And that it may appear, Madam, believe, that Amoronzo's here, I mean in wish, I would not have him nigh, Except his dear Celania were by, Whom we suppose you are, or else his tongue By false description, Madam, did you wrong; For 'twas our hapless fortunes to be near Unto his groans, when we did sadly hear The thunder of his passion (oh hard hap) And then a sigh would usher in each clap Like flames or lightning, sometimes he would say, My Dearest, oh divine Celania! Here, here, thy tortur'd Amoronzo lyes Bewitch'd to death by his own miseries: Do not believe thy self, if thou shouldst chance To think me cruel, let thy thoughts advance To better notions, ah my Dearest, know The Gods can testifie, it is not so, Heav'n knows I love thee—There he stopt, &amp; then Even like a Torrent he brake forth again And thus exprest. ? ? What Love-sick-God hath made An errand from the Heavens, and thus betray'd My Dearest from me, oh it was unkind Unkindly done, to leave me here behind To weep her absence, well, the Gods may frown But I'le unseile the Heavens, and reach her down; I cannot breath, for she that is my breath Is ravish'd from me, and is now my death, And there—oh what, reply'd Celania, what If it be death, be sparing, name it not, Such stories please me not: Then Madam, know There he left off to speak, but not to flow In floods of tears, he being thus distrest, We ran unto him, made it our request To know the reason of his grief, but he With a mixt look, reply'd do ye not see Can ye not spell my miserable state (Far easier to endure, than to relate,) Perplex me not with questions, but be brief, And tell me, can you mitigate my grief? Can ye inform me, where th'indeared Guest Of my now widdowed, melancholly brest Makes her abode, if this ye can assure me, Ye'l prove Physitians, and for ever cure me: Within the fatal confines of this place I left her with a Villain, whose disgrace Black Hell does seeme to blush at, nay, and I (The wofull Authour of her tragedy) Am buried in despair, oh horrid truth Dimagoras was a Villain from his youth; But I'le pursue the Traytour, nay unhinge The Cerbrean gates, and bring him to revenge. Murther does non-plus Hell, which knows not how To get provisioary Plagues enough To punish it, but stay, behold, oh see These are the grounds of my just miserie, (Shewing Celania's Partlet, Gloves, and hair) Then judg, have I not reason to despair Sayes he. Thus having lavishly expended His profuse rage, he tore his hair, and ended, And there we left him, Madam, having now Exprest the truth we know, we further bow To your commands, believe it, we assure Our selves, that you do equally endure The like misfortune, neither do we doubt By your permission but to finde him out, Or else we'l lose our selves in the pursute, Then let your Faith encrease, and be not mute, Your silence tells us that you love, and we By our own confidence resolve 'tis he, 'Tis him you love, then please for his dear sake To be perswaded, and some pity take Upon your self, believ't, those blushes do Confirm, what we have told you, must be true, Nay, and the more t'establish your belief, We'l tell you what we are ? ? Then know in brief We are Arcadians, and from thence we came Being impowered in your Uncles name (Our royal King) to ransack all about To see if we could find Celania out; We had not long pursu'd, but by a chance We heard which way, and how you did advance With Amoronzo, so we soon forsook Our lazy pace, and suddenly o'retook Your most renowned Lover, whose report For feats of Armes, shall spread about the Court At our return, although it much redown To our disparagement, to heap renown Upon a Stranger, and eclipse that glory Which ought t'advance the credit of our story; If Mars had come in person to oppose And give encounter to so many Foes So well appointed, he had quickly known Th' unhappy Fate of being overthrown; For Amoronzo (much like lightning) flew About our ears, and in a moment slew Our stoutest Leaders: Nothing could asswage Or quench the fire of his consuming rage; Our lives were only sav'd, but not by slight, Or feats of Armes, but by a timely flight, So that we must confess our lives were due To Amoronzo first, and now to you, For which, as duty binds us, we shall be Faithful to you in this extreamitie, But Madam, let us crave, before we fall To our intentions, that you would recall Those ill opinions of us which do rest Within the Realm of your disturbed brest, Believe us then, we did it but to trye And prove th' effects of your known Chastitie, And if this be not truth which we declare, Then may your grim-Attendant cease, and tear Our perjur'd hearts: Now Madam, if you please To walk to more conveniency, and ease Your wearied body, we will forthwith trye Our chiefest skills, to bring a quick supply Of comfort to you, and we hope to find A Balsom to refresh your troubled mind: To which Celania without further oath (Made confident by knowledg of them both) Reply'd—Extreams of grief and care hath made This alteration in me, and betray'd The freedom of my Spirit, yet I dare With confidence assure my self, ye are Relations to my Uncle, whose severe And more then usual passions, made me fear The weight of his displeasure, which you know Falls heavy: Heaven protect me from a Foe So wrapt in fury, that he is by odd, Far more implacable than the Gods, Nor do I think it possible for Art T'allay the flames of his incensed heart, And were it in my choice, I'd chuse to dye Rather than feel the lightning of his eye; Therefore, as I suppose, 'tis much in vain To waste your time in lab'ring to obtain The renovation of his Love. What thing Can be more fierce than an incensed King; This Lyon, if compar'd to him, may be Esteem'd a Lamb, experience let's you see That he is pitiful; therefore, return And leave me here alone, that I may burn In my own flames: Thus let us end this strife, Who brings me Amoronzo, brings me life: The noble Knights (for so they were) reply'd, Madam, this truth, is not to be deny'd, Which you have utter'd; but since your distress As we conceive, requires a quick redress, Be pleas'd t'accept those proffers which will tend To your advantage, Madam, do not spend More time, in more delays, the homely place Of my abode, is not above the space Of half a League, which by our help, you may Quickly approach to, Madam, let's away, And be assured that you shall command As free an entertainment as will stand With my estate: Celania, heavy-hearted, Consented slowly, slowly, she departed; Where now we'l leave them for a time, and treat Upon Dimagoras, who is now compleat In his distress, being business'd in a strife Whether to kill himself, or lose his life By condemnation; for it so fell out That the Lyconians gave a totall rout To the Arcadian Army, and pursu'd Their victory, until they had subdu'd Their chief Commanders, and at last they sent Unto th' Arcadian King, to know th'intent Of his proceedings, whether he would yield To their desires, they having won the field; To which th'inraged King sent this reply. Know ye Lyconians that I much defie To yield, till death requires, nor is it all Your strength can make me yield unto your call, As for your Lord Dimagoras, who is now My Captive, I will quickly make him bow To my commands, his head, his head shall be The Prophesie of future victorie To my recruited Army, therefore know I am your hearty, your undaunted Foe, KALANDER. Having dispatch'd this Message, he retires And (as his speed commands him) soon requires Th' Assistance of his Council, to advise Which way to steer in these extreamities; Who being met, considering well the speed Of their occasions, gravely thus proceed: Most sacred Sir, perpending well the state You now are in, we boldly thus debate, And first grave Sir, we humbly do propose Life for Dimagoras; because your Foes Being flesht with victory, will quickly be (If not oppos'd by potent pollicie) Upon your quarters, therefore we'l prepare And make the best advantage of his fear, We have already, strongly nois'd about That you have lately gave a total rout To the Lyconian Army, and this news Being posted to his ears, sure cannot chuse But fright him into any thing, 'tis known His mungrel disposition dare not own The least misfortune, therefore we'l present To him (as 'twere by Lanskip) your intent: We will imploy an Agent who shall speak By circumambitues, and slyly break The Ice of your desires, by which we'l find Which way the Byas of his tortur'd mind Does most incline: Thus having laid the ground Of our designs, we quickly can propound What Fabrick to erect, fear seldom's clad With reason to distinguish good from bad; Therefore, most sacred Sir, if you approve Of our advice, we quickly will remove Your now-incroaching Foes; for we'l indite And make Dimagoras sign to what we write, We therefore wait your pleasure ? ? To which the King Gravely reply'd, I fear 'twill prove a thing Of small effect; Lyconia does afford But mean respects to him, although their Lord; Suppose he should command them to retire A League, or two, they'd laugh at his desire, For they are now in armes, and are made bold By victory, and what they get, they'l hold: ‘When Subjects once get head, they bid farewell ‘To duty, make it conscience to rebell; ‘The sword knowes no obedience, for it makes ‘Disloyalty a Law, and rudly shakes ‘Truths Fundamentals, seldom wanting friends ‘To brandish it into sinister ends; Therefore I well conceive that 'tis unfit To act by him that has not power, nor wit; For though it be State policy, we know To seem unwise, 'tis madness, to be so; For States-men must, like water-men still show Their faces East-ward, when they West-ward row: But to the purpose, 'tis our only way To labour, by contrivance, how to play Our after gain, giving them blots by flight, Which if they hit, they fall, we stand upright: You know, I sent for aid, which I expect Within few dayes, therefore I'le not neglect To prosecute my ends; for I intend If Fate permit, this very night to send My Carriages before, and when the Sun Gives them intelligence, I'le seem to run With these my scattered forces, but I'le leave This Garrison well man'd, for I perceive That they intend a siege, and to persue With their remaining force, which if they do, I'le flye with speed to the Olympian Plains And joyn with those recrutes which there remains In expectation of me, if th'event Prove well, thank Heav'n, for this is my intent: As for Dimagoras, I will prepare An Antidote, he shall not dye with fear, I'le cure him with a Message, which shall be Welcome, being ballast with his libertie, He shall have freedom to enjoy the air Under a watchful eye left he despair And so we lose him; for 'tis my intent To make Dimagoras finish the event Be what it will: 'Tis policy to have In such uncertainties, a royal Slave: Delay breeds danger, let's away, I long To be in action; Courage makes us strong. Reader, I crave thy favour to excuse My quick retreat; for know my tim'rous Muse Is not so military to withstand The dreadful thunderings of a Martial hand; For she complains that Mars was once before Discourteous to her, and she'l fight no more Except—but hark, who calls? Celania, how Celania call? then Reader turn thy brow From Mars to Venus, for Mars seldom saves, Nor gives he any other Crowns then Graves: We'l leave him for a time, and if there be Occasion that we must return and see His well flesht shambles, we'l not fear nor run, 'Tis better far to see, then feel what's done. All you whose Virgin-hearts have never known The painfull issues of a Love sick groan, Draw near; and you, whose barren eyes did never Let fall a tear, come now, and weep for ever; And you, whose infant eyes could never prove Or speak the proper Dialects of Love, Approach, for here are to be taught in brief, Your hearts, your eyes, your tongues, the rules of grief, Here breaths your lively copy, you may see The exact portraiture of miserie; Observe how every Linament doth speak Its excellency, and attempts to break More hearts then she has woes, whose dismal cry Eccho's; alas, I'm griefs Anatomy, See how she is disected, how each part Of her much wounded, yet more constant heart. Lies open to your view, and how each vein Usurpt by death, lyes bleeding to obtain That blood-stone of her Soul, I mean, her dear Her dearest Amoronzo, who's more near Unto her Soul, then all the wealth that can Be apprehended by the thoughts of Man, 'Tis he must cure my pains, sayes she, or I Must languish in his absence, pine, and dye: These were Celania's groans, which had more And more enlarg'd, had not the fast lockt door Receiv'd a sudden knock, which made her stay The current of her grief, and haste away To give an entrance, but her thoughts begin To mutiny, unwilling to let in Unwelcome newes, so drawing back her hand, Her trembling hand, she made a sudden stand; And gazing towards the door, she said, must I Must I be Porter to my misery; No, no I will not, yet I will—but stay, I dare not, oh I dare not, why? I may And will, I will; Misfortune do thy worst, I may be made more blest, not more accurst: With that scarce knowing what she did, she run Unto the door, and hastily begun To turn the Key, but e're she could fulfill The sensless pleasure of her captiv'd will, She heard a voice, a voice, that seem'd to bear (Being made more sad, more terrible by fear) A dreadful horror, and it seem'd to cry Harken Celania, harken to what I Shall say, fear not, for know, my Message gives This comfort, that your Amoronzo lives, He lives, but I must tell, what's sadly true, Voyd of all comforts, but the thoughts of you: Yet know Celania, 'tis my business hither To tell you that you must meet both together. But where, or when, or how, that must be hid From both, because I strictly am forbid, Yet this I'le say; it will be ere the Sun (Times painful journey-man) hath fully run His three dayes course; but I must sadly say, Ye will not know each other, and that day Will prove unfortunate; for one whose name Stands now recorded in the rolls of shame, Will by an accident, betray and bring You both before the presence of the King: These things must happen, and you'l not do well T'endeavour a prevention: So farewell. Who ever saw a trance revived Soul With what a sad aspect his lips condole His ridged Fate, that he must live to be As t'were enjoyn'd t'imbrace his miserie? Even so Celania waking from her trance Crav'd pity by each look, and did advance Her drooping head, then for a time she stood As loath t'acquaint her self with flesh and blood, But at the last, death. which did seem before To sojourn in her eyes, did now restore Lifes due prerogatives, but I'le not wrong The real truth (though rare) to say, her tongue Was first in motion, for her hands, her eyes Did seem to descant on her miseries: 'Tis more then strange, her sorrows wanting vent And grown quite lawless, had not tore and rent Her grapling Soul, each sigh which did depart Seem'd (like a boysterous storm) to tear her heart Up by the roots, at last, her sighs made way For words (like Pyoneers) and without stay She thus proceeded ? ? Since the powers above Have thus resolv'd to contradict my Love, It will prove vain to strive, the Gods will do What their firm resolutions prompt them to: Ah must these eyes of mine behold and see My Amoronzo, and not know 'tis he, Impossible! for sure there cannot rise So great a mist before my feeble eyes: Lovers are ey'd like Lyncius, can discover Though wall'd about, their real hearted Lover: But stay, what should this dark Enigma show (Strange kind of riddle) see, and yet not know, Oh miserable happiness! sad Face! See, and not know, did ever wit create A greater mistry, well, I'm sure that I Shall know him, though it be by Sympathy, 'Tis neither time nor Art can so much change My Amoronzo's looks as to estrange Or hid him from my knowledg, for my heart Retains his true effigies, and no art Can so disguise him, but even like the Sun (The worlds great eye) that may be over-run And cloth'd with Clouds, yet sure it cannot be Chang'd in aspect, but we must know 'tis he; But were this all, ah then my raging grief Might in some sort be subject to relief, But ah my sorrows more and more rebell Against my Soul, and rings a doleful knell To all my comforts, nothing can prevent The rude incursions of my discontent: Judge Ladies, judge, if ever grief could be More acted to the life then 'tis in me, Observe my Laborinths, and if ye find The relish of a comfort in my mind, Judg me to more extreams, if art can show A way to make a more exuberous woe Then mine, inflict it on me, let your eyes Weep me to death, or drown my miseries, I care not which; oh tell me is't not woe More then enough, to see, and yet not know My Amoronzo: here's a flaming rod, Here's grie s full stop, but not her period. Sad consequence, I see there is no reason In grief, that loves to tyrannize by treason! Oh pevish Fate, why dost thou thus devise New ways, new means, new woes to tyrannize! But Heav'n prevent the Traytor, may his death Betray the treason, or his feeble breath Want utt'rance to express it, Heav'n defend My Amoronzo from so base an end, But if it be decreed; The Gods are just In taking both, we'l marry in the dust, The grave shall swell with mirth, our lofty tomb Shall be both nuptial bed and dining room, The worms shall be our Guests, nay, they shall be Both Mask and Musick to our jollitie; We'l revell in our ashes, lively death Shall dance for joy, then having taken breath Shall post away, and thus nights vail being spread, The Curtains drawn by time, we'l shrink to bed: Rest then my heart, purchase a free content, Observe with care, and thou shalt see th' event Come fluttering on the wings of time, 'tis near, 'Tis near, and will with winged speed appear: With that (the Rose and Lilly being met) I mean her hand and cheek, she seem'd to let Her eye-lids slumber, but she could command No pleasing rest; for in her eyes did stand Grief's watch-men (tears) so in an angry vain She snatch'd her Lute, and thus begun to strain Her Magick voice, I cannot well say whether She wept, and sung, she sung and wept together. Celania's Song. 1 Come gentle Lute, and let's relate In warbling Notes my ridged Fate, That these (now sensless) walls and stones Hearing my well divided groans, May from their dulness frightned be Into a sensibilitie, And hearing, say, I've reason to bewail That am both Ocean, Tempest, Ship, and Sail. 2 I am an Ocean, and my eyes Send me (like Rivolets) supplyes Only in this, unlike the Main, I flow, but never ebb again, My brackish tides cannot return Nor drown (like that) but always burn: And thus my sorrows licence me to weep, My eyes (though narrow Seas) are very deep. 3 I am a Tempest, and I know There seldom comes a calm in woe, When Boreas harbours in a brest, 'Tis fondness then to think on rest, And needs must they be void of peace, Whose tempests never, never cease: Then blame me not when thus my stormes arise, To strive t'allay them with my raining eyes. 4 I am a Ship full fraught with fears Tost in the Ocean of my tears, Rackt in a storm of sighes I run Upon the Rocks, and am undone; My Pilot's lost, I know not where, And I am buried in despair. Thus am I brought unto deaths fatal brink, My Pilot being lost I needs must sink. 5 I am a Sail, and every hour Submits me to the lawless power Of Boreas, whose most envious breath Assaults, and tares me unto death. Needs must he have a stormy mind That's subject unto every wind. Then blame me not that thus my woes bewail, That am both Ocean, Tempest, Ship, and Sail. Thus having ended (may I say) her Song Her tears (like swelling Surges) grew too strong For her restraint, and fain she would have vented More vocal grief, hut that her eyes prevented And drownd her speech, yet she was heard to cry, Sum all misfortune up, and that am I. Where now we'l leave her pickl'd in her tears, Opprest with sighes, and buried in her fears; For now the Knight's return'd, and in his eye Dwells the sad Character of misery: Each look imports misfortune; he enquires After Celania's welfare, and retires In private with his Lady, to relate His fruitless progress, and th'unhappy Fate Of Amoronzo, who as fame assur'd Was lost at Sea, after he had endur'd A fearful Ship-wrack: This unwelcom newes Floated in tears: alas, and who can chuse But lend a drop, poor Lady, who shall keep Celania company in tears, or weep Equivolent streams, the Knight, who having paid The tribute of his eyes, lookt up, and said What's best to do, which way shall we contrive T'express this fatal newes, and keep alive Our Guest, Celania; for I'm sure, that breath That utters his, proclaims aloud, her death: Come then, resolve, mans judgment must resign In these extreams unto the Feminine? What shall we do? for if misfortune should Reveal Celania to the King, it would Be my destruction, or if I should go Unto the King, and utter what I know, He might reward me; but the horrid name Of Traytor fills me with insulting shame, I dare not, oh I cannot prove a death To her whose virtue priviledg'd my breath. To which the Lady thus reply'd ? ? 'tis true I apprehend what dangers may accrue By our concealment, yet I'le rather be A Prostitute to all extreamitie Then let my name (the jewell of my age) Bear treasons image, what can more enrage The Heavens then treason; I could well afford To curse each letter, of so dam'd a word; But since 'tis thus, if you (my Lord) think fit To trust this business to a womans wit, I shall endeavour both with speed and care T'extenuate Celania's, and your fear, And thus I will contrive: First then present Your self unto her, let no discontent Dwell on your brow, 'tis easie to discry Th' afflicted hearts distemper by the eye, Then have a care (my Lord) and let each word Be bitter-sweet, that so you may afford Equal of both, for if you should declare His certain death, 'twould fill her with despair, Or if with too much joy you should relate The happy tidings of his prosperous Fate, 'Twould so transport her, that no skill nor art Will moderate the raptures of her heart; ‘For 'tis well known that womens minds are such, ‘That they must neither joy, nor grief too much. But to proceed, you having thus declar'd Your doubtful mind, there shall be soon prepar'd An ancient Pilgrim, who may by his wise Discourse, aleviate her miseries: Our house hath bin (my Lord) these three days blest In giving entertainment to this Guest He is a man, except his tongue belye His heart, judicious in Divinitie, He's sparing in discourse, yet kind to all, Gravely facetious, sweetly musical, Nay, and Celania wish't, that she might be A consort in his pleasing melodie, And he as often (noting her distress) Hath wisht her griefs might find a quick redress; To which intent he told me, if his skill Might any way be useful to fulfill Or further her desires, that she should find A readiness, crown'd with a cheerful mind; If she intended) as he thought) to be Shrowded within a sacred Nunnerie, Which in my judgment very well may sute With her condition, and in time confute Her powerful adversary, grief, which now Usurps, and sits in triumph on her brow: (Poor Lady) when at last this news is spread That Amoronzo, her lifes life is dead What can she do but dye? 'twould be hard measure Onely who dyes for Love, sure dyes for pleasure: But stay, farewell, let's follow our design, Act you your part (my Lord) I'le warrant mine. Away they went, the Knight without delay Compos'd his countenance, and took his way To visit sad Celania, who then sat Disconsolate, as if she had forgot She liv'd, till at the last she heard one say Madam, be pleas'd to cast your eye this way Upon your Servant who hath thus made bold T'intrude, unlicenc'd, Madam, please to hold Your self contented, let not sorrow have The whole dominion of your thoughts, but save Some room for Amoronzo ? ? Have ye seen The Pris'ner at the bar striving between Hope and despair, with what a piercing eye He views his Judges, fearing to discry His death, cloth'd in their looks: Even so did she, Poor Lady, strive to read her destinie Regester'd in his looks; stand still she cryes, That I may read my ruine in your eyes, The Characters are legible, I know How to spell death it self, and construe woe: First in your face (my Lord) is to be read A tragick story: Amoronzo's dead, He's dead, my Lord, nor shal't be long before I'le follow; claspe your book, I'le read no more, And thus I'le finish lifes accursed summe I come my Amoronzo—Dear—I come. Hold Madam, spare your life, he is not dead Reply'd the Lord, you only have misread And made a false construction in my looks, Madam, pray read again, or burn the books; He is not dead, the Fates have now decreed To make you happy: How! nay then proceed Reply'd Celania, will the Gods at last Take pity on a wretch that's overcast With black despair, what shall I wish to give In recompence: Does Amoronzo live? His name creates new life; for now I find A new creation in my infant mind; Oh how grown in comfort, every minute Brings me a Heaven, and Amoronzo in it; See where he comes, Love, lend me wings to fly Into his bosom, come my joy, draw nigh, Imbrace thine own Celania, oh how blest Am I, Love never found so sweet a rest. The Lord (unus'd to Love sick raptures) knew Not what to say, but suddenly he flew Like lightning from her presence, where he met The Lady and the Pilgrim, who were set To wait her long'd-for coming, that they might Intice her to some musical delight, But Fate design'd it otherwise, for now They all complot, and joyntly study how To wean her from her raptures, and at last The Pilgrim (sadly hearing what was past) Being fill'd with pity, took his Lute, and went Near to her Chamber, where he forthwith sent His airy Messengers unto her ear To summon all her senses to appear Before his melody, at last, she rais'd Her drooping head, and after she had gaz'd About the room; where is (said she) my Dear, What, stole away, and left Celania here? Or was it but a dream? but hark, that hand Which playes, is his, and sure I understand Each pleasing touch, but stay, what voice is this, I'le swear it is an Angels, or else his, 'Tis his, and he is mine: I'le rest content To hear his Song, and then expect th'event. The Pilgrims Song. 1 Sail gentle Soul, the wind blows fair Despair is buried in despair; For wind and tide now seem to court And lead us to our wisht-for port, The wanton Billows seem in state to dance To see our safe, our blest deliverance. 2 The Pilot smiles, the Ship prevailes, The storm submits, the swelling sailes Puft up with Pride, does seem to run More then Post-haste to kiss the Sun. Then cease sad heart, thou needest not to bewail, For thou art neither Tempest, Ship, nor Sail. The Song thus finished, Celania calls Her thoughts in question, and she forthwith falls Into a serious study, well, sayes she, I cannot be mistaken, sure 'tis he, Or I am not my self, both voice, and hand Invite my tortur'd Soul to understand It must be he, but oh that I could see That Saint, which gave this voice that libertie; Impatience hates delay, I must be bold In spite of modesty; I cannot hold But must attempt: Ye Fates prove not unkind, The eye, not ear, must satisfie the mind: With that, with Eagle-speed (she that before Could hardly creep) now flyes unto the door, Which being open, suddenly her eye Surveys each corner, but could not espye The treasure of her heart, but having found Her hopes in vain, she fell upon the ground, Being intranc'd, the Pilgrim that had view'd Her passion (though unseen himself) pursu'd His resolutions, so with speed he takes His Lute, and with a willing heart he makes A near approach, and sent unto her ears (As if he had Epitomiz'd the Spheres) Such Heav'n-bred strains, that in dispite of death He re-inforc'd her to her former breath, This being done, she gently mov'd her head, Which was repos'd upon too hard a bed. Oh that my Soul had wings, she cryes, that I Might quit these vain delusions, and fly To my delight, this world affords no treasure To me, but base-bred joyes, and spurious pleasure; Oh that I could—with that a sudden glance Betray'd the Pilgrim to her eyes, whose chance It was t'observe her, as the purple dye Usurpt her cheeks; she blusht, but knew not why, And yet the more she labour'd to restrain Her blushes, still the more she blusht again; At last, with bashful modesty, she rais'd Her feeble self, stood still awhile, and gaz'd Upon the Pilgrim, who admir'd the grace And majesty united in her face, Whil'st she, did equally admire to see So much of meekness, cloth'd in gravitie; Resolving then, that pity needs must rest In such a Soul; she thus her thoughts exprest. Grave Sir, sayes she, although it disagree Unto my Sex to take the libertie Of speech, before requir'd, yet I depend Upon your liberall goodness to befriend My errors with a pardon, that I may Return deserved thanks, and haste away. To which the Pilgrim ? ? Madam, if your haste Depend upon my pardon, I shall waste Some time before I grant it; for I have An humble favour, which I needs must crave; My hopes assure me you will not deny To crown my wishes; Madam pray reply. To which Celania: Sir, it is not best To grant, before I know what you request, Yet my assured confidence is such, That you will neither ask, I grant, too much; Therefore propose your will: Then Madam, know I have observ'd, nay, copy'd out your woe, In which (excuse my boldness) I do find The sad extreames of a tormented mind, Therefore be pleas'd to say (for I respect The cause, there is no judging by th'effect) The reason of your grief, whith once being known The cure is more then half perfection: Stand not to ruminate, but be assur'd What you relate, shall safely be secur'd Within the strong-fenc'd bull-wark of my heart, Not to be taken by the force of Art: Believe it Madam, and from that belief Derive to me the reason of your grief: I am a Pilgrim, treason cannot dwell More in my brest, than in a Hermits Cell, My calling makes me bold, and I must say Your Conscience ought t'inforce you to obey; Some days have pass'd since these mine aged eyes Have truly witness'd your extremities, And 'tis my Conscience bids me to require The reason: Madam, this is my desire; Or if my Judgment or my Reason fail, I have a Conscience that will stand my Bail, Nay weep not Lady, lay aside those fears I understand your tongue, but not your tears, Tears are good signs, but words are understood More in one breath, then tears are in a flood; I could drop tear for tear, but to what use? Tears in some sense are only words excuse; 'Tis a known truth, that Nature, which affords An eye for tears, has given tongue for words; Therefore be pleas'd as long as I stand by, To let your tongue be flowing, not your eye. To which Celania, after she had dry'd Her watry eyes, lookt up, and thus reply'd. Grave Sir excuse me that I must deny At present, what you claim as courtesie; For my disordered thoughts cannot invent As yet away t'express my full intent, But be assur'd time shall not lose much sand Before your heart shall fully understand The nature of my grief; for I will throw My life into your hands, and then bestow It as you please; In the mean time consent To grant my pardon, and I'le rest content: And so all peace attend you, may your eyes, See as much joys, as mine have miseries. The end of the second Book. THE Third Book. Post on, my Muse, for hark, the Readers say What, is Dimagoras lost, and shrunk away? Or has th' unmindful Author quite forgot To bring him on the Stage, why comes he not? Reader he comes, be pleased to prepare To see him only come to take the air After his love-sick passion, which indeed I shall relate; And thus in short proceed: The King was pleased (but I know not whether, Pity or pollicy, or both together Mov'd him) to give Dimagoras leave to shew Himself abroad, confining him to go Guarded without regard; which newes being brought Unto his willing ears, he forthwith thought Himself in Heav'n, for after a restraint Who would not think that man a happy Saint That brought him newes of liberty: But now I must implore the Reader to allow Pardon for an omission, which in brief, Is this: Dimagoras being fill'd with grief, Not knowing, and worse doubting, what would be The issue of his sad captivity; But still his thoughts (inclining to despair More then to comfort) often would prepare An instrument of death; but still his heart Prov'd the worst Actor, of the chiefest part, And would not let him; but he oft would cry Were't not for fear of dying, I could dye; Oh life! Oh death! said he, why should there be Between you two, such an Antipathie? Alas 'tis nothing but this trifling breath That makes such diffrence between life and death; And what is breath? 'tis nothing but a blast, A smoak, a vapour, and it cannot last, Only in me it riots but to spight And plague me with the still approaching light, Or else succeeding darkness; thus am I The subject of curst Fortunes cruelty: See now the grim-lookt night is come, and all The worlds inhabitants provide, and fall To rest; but I (the watch-man of the world) Am like an abject creature, tost, and hurld Into obscurity; but yet I'le try If sleep will lend a visit to mine eye; With that he threw himself upon his bed, Reposes his much discomposed head; But all in vain, the flatterers of sleep, (I mean short slumbers) would not let him keep Decorum in his rest, for now, and then He starts, now speaks, and then lies still agen; Sometimes his voluntary tongue would cry, Parthenia, ah Parthenia, why, Oh why Dost thou perplex—and there a sigh would part His words, and leave him with a throbing heart: At last he wakes, and yet I cannot say He wak'd, because he slept not, for he lay Charm'd in a dream, which soon shall be exprest; (He that dreams most, still takes the lest of rest.) At first he dream'd, he saw Parthenia stand Cloathed in white, with Lawrel in one hand And Palm in th' other, at whose feet she spread The Palm, and plac'd the Lawrel, on his head; At which Dimagoras (much delighted) vented His joy, in tears, and seemingly lamented His own unworthiness, whilst she stood by, And with a pitying smile did seem to dry His blubber'd cheecks; but (as he after swore) The more she wipt his eyes, he cry'd the more; At last she seem'd to lay her gentle head Upon his Pillow, and retire to bed; With that ('tis quickly judg'd in what delight He thought to spend each minute of the night) He went to welcome her with an embrace, And found a Spirit snugging in her place: His warm embraces now are turn'd to cold And frosty fears; alas he cannot hold A joint from trembling, for his gashly eye Being fix'd upon that object which lay by, Did strive t' out stare the Devil; but at length Fancy retreats, and he receives new strength; So finding it a Dream, he turns, and then He falls asleep, and sleeping, dreams again, And dreaming, thought he saw bold Argalus Smiling upon him, and salute him thus: My Lord Dimagoras, I am come to tell A story, which, I'm sure, will please you well: The Gods have seen your suff'rings, and now Intend to view you with a serene brow; As for your wrongs to me, I freely do Forget them, and in that, I pardon you; I freely pardon, and Parthenia shall Be my Engagement, that I pardon all Your vile abuses, nay, her hand shall sign Your gracious pardon too, as well as mine; But I must tell you, though the Gods now please, After an age of grief to send you ease; yet if your care contrive not to fulfill Each particle of their commanding will, Be well assur'd that Hell himself near knew A greater fall, then shall befall to you; And as for plagues and torments, be assur'd You shall find such as cannot be endur'd; Thus I advise you; but because th' intent Of this, my speech, is charitably bent I'le shew you more, observe, ? ? With that appears A manly shape, more grave in looks, then years, Nor did he come alone, for in his hand He led a Lady, on whose cheeks did stand A showr of speaking tears, which seem'd to say, Oh miserable, miserable day: These are those two, says Argalus, which you Would willingly betray, but if you do, Expect the plague of plagues, to vex thy heart, And re-instate thee in eternal smart; Observe, and weigh my words, and let not fear Bribe thee to so much baseness, have a care; And when you see them, seem to see them not, So shall you purchase a most happy lot; But one thing more: Before I dis-appear, I needs must recommend unto your ear A serious truth, which will be ere this night, Chas'd by th' approaching morning, takes its flight; 'Twill so fall out, that your distracted head Will fall much lower then your lofty bed; You shall receive a fall, which fall, indeed Shall cause your heart, as well as head, to bleed; But at which time, a Damosel shall present Her self unto you with a good intent To salve your several hurts, her virgin name Shall be Lutosa, whose renowned fame Shall eccho through the world; her virtues shall Precede her Beauty, and her beauty, all: The wings of fame shall mount her to the skies, She's fair, she's rich; and what is best, she's wise; She's wise, because she's humble, and she's fair, Because she's wise, she's rich, because she's heir Unto Apollo, Venus, Cræsus; Nay, She's more then second to Parthenia: This Lady, whose perfections far transcend Perfection, shall be proud to recommend Her dear affections to your constant brest, And so farewell: Th' event shall speak the rest, And there he vanish'd ? ? Now Dimagoras dreams Of Cupid, Venus, and of all th' extreams Of Love; his over-busie thoughts are now In consultation, sweetly ploting how To Pen an amorous Letter; first he writes, And then blots out, and afterwards, indites; And now his trembling hand begins to hold The Paper, where loves stories must be told; He sighs, and then begins; My dearest Dear, May these my rude unpolish'd Lines,—and here He stops, dislikes, then likes, dislikes again. Throws by that Paper; then another strain Must be constrain'd, and now his matter flows; He smites his brest, looks up, and too't he goes: The Letter's finish'd, now it must be read; Hark how he sighs, see how he shakes his head. He reads, and cryes, the matter is not good, The manner's naught, and 'twill be understood More Complement, then love; yet he is bent To send it; What is love but Complement? And now 'tis seal'd, seal'd with a bleeding heart Transfixt, and wounded with an amorous dart: Away 'tis sent; Oh how his spirits burn In expectation of a quick return: The allmost breathless Messenger is now Return'd again, who with a sweating brow Presents a Letter, which with trembling speed He took, and kist; and then began to read; He reads, then studies, reads again, and then Cryes out, Oh cruel women, wretched men; These women-Sophisters can make that sense That's Present, be the Preterfect-tense, These she Grammarians often times displace, And put the Verb before the Nom'native Case; There Rhetorick kisses and their Logick looks, Would make an Aristotle burn his Books; Their smiles are Tropes, &amp; figures, &amp; their words Are dark Enigma's, every look affords Large Volumns of discourse; their tears, they are Who can tell what, my Genious, stop thou there; Women, like Globes, do always love to be In motion, still confin'd to liberty; In this they differ, That no art can find The perfect Centure of a womans mind: But stay, me thinks this Letter does express More then an ordinary dubiousness; Her tongue must be th' interpreter, for I Am unacquainted in loves mistery; I'le haste unto her, for this cannot be Her proper Language, no, I know that she Is more ingenious, yet a womans heart Is always wav'ring, ? There a sudden start Gave motion to his Limb, yet sleep at length Did captivate his brain, and gave new strength Unto his fancy, then his fancy brought Him to his Lady: Now each forward thought Corrects the former; so that he could find. No means t'express th' affections of his mind; Now sighs, and steadfast looks must only prove, The sad, and powerful Orators of love; They counter-look each other, for her eye Still thwarted his, and yet she knew not why; She blush'd because he look'd and he again Would look, because she blush'd, but all in vain, For on a sudden (starting from his dream) He wakes, and waking cries, Oh how extream Unquiet, are my slumbers, yet I find The more I slumber, I am more confin'd To slumber; but I hope the welcome day Will come, and chase these falcities away: Till then,—and there a slumber did surprise The yeilding Fort of his besieged eyes; He had not long engag'd himself to sleep Before an other vision seem'd to creep Into his fancy, which rejoyc'd his brest And brought more comfort to him then the rest: He dream'd he saw Parthenia, in whose face He read the pleasing Charracters of grace, He lookt upon her, and her Commet-eye Portended liberal pardon; by and by (Approaching nearer) she began to break Her lipps; he seem'd to hear, and she to speak To this effect: Know then, that I am come To tell you that your time of Martyrdom Is near at hand, nay start not, for I mean No harm; I'le be an Actor in this Scene: Mistake me not, you are not like to prove A Martyr, only in the flames of love; Be careful, that no envious fate incline To cross your love, as once it did do mine: Remember who it was, that to fulfill The cruel pleasure of his greedy will Surpriz'd me when my busie thoughts were crown'd With Argalus; Who drag'd me on the ground? Revil'd, and kickt me? nay, and what is worse Poyson'd my face, and made my life a curse: This was the cause which made me to deny My Argalus, and say, It is not I; And yet I lov'd him, but my love was such I wav'd it, why? Because I lov'd him much: Ah was it fit that Argalus should be Match'd to so much extream deformity; Yet in what love-sick tearms would he express How much he lov'd deformed happiness; How did he curse the day-light for revealing So foul a face, the darkness for concealing The treasure of his heart; Thus night nor day Could please him, when his dear Parthenia Deny'd her Argalus; ah can there be In man, so unbeliev'd a constancy; Nor was this all, for when, nor word, nor vow; Could tempt my stubborn heart once to allow A grant to his desires, away I stole, Unknown to any, left him to condole My unknown absence, for 'twas my intent To lose my self; I knew not where I went, Nor what I did; that passion of the mind, Which make us dumb, as well can make us blind; But see the will of fortune, I that stray'd I knew not how, nor where, nay never made The least enquiry, was by well-pleas'd Fate Brought to my Aunts, (the Queen of Corinths) Gate, Where being come, my near relations, made (After they knew) me welcome, where I stay'd Till time had wrought my cure, which being done My well composed thoughts began to run Upon my Argalus, the more each part Was cur'd, the more I found, a wounded heart; At last I sent to see if I could find (There is no sickness to a love-sick mind) My Love; but when the Messenger return'd I froze with fear to ask, and yet I burn'd With a desire to know; and who can blame Long smothered Love, to break into a flame; But Fate (which then was courtious) brought about My wishes, for at last, I found him out: Nor was I then content; my zealous mind Began to plot, and try if I could find A flaw in his affections, but I found His heart as constant, and his love as sound As heart could wish; 'tis true, I laid this plot To see if Argalus had quite forgot His Dear Parthenia; but I could espy (And read within the volumn of his eye) Th' affections of his heart; but he at first Took me for what I was, yet after burst Into a storm of tears, because his eye Cheated his thoughts, I told him t'was not I; But that I came t'invite him now to take A heart on trust, for dead Parthenias sake: But he refused; yet the more I made My strong attempt, and resolutely said; My Lord, you must accept; He shook his head, And cry'd, Oh Heavens! and is Parthenia dead? If she be dead, what heart have I to give? And how can I receive. that cannot live To make requital, Earth shall sooner move Then I will yeild unto a second love, Although I must confess, says he, you are Parthenia's Image, and might be her heir In worth, and beauty; but alass, she's fled, And I am flying; Is Parthenia dead, Oh then—with that I flew into his arms, And so restor'd him with my wofull charms, Nay it was long before I could perswade His heart to credit what my tongue had said; Yet at the last, loves circumstances prov'd That I was once his lost, yet well-belov'd And true Parthenia; thus by lucky art My face was cur'd before, and then, my heart: Thus after all this turbulent confusion Fate brought our wishes to a good conclusion, And you to punishment, which seem'd to glory, In being Authour of this Tragick story; But I forgive you, wishing you to be A Philalethes, not a fallsie: And now because that you may fully know That you are pardon'd, follow where I go; Be confident of what I say; and tell Th' enquiring world, what hath this night befell; So follow me: Impatient of delay He rises in his sleep, and hasts away; And being up, he ransacks all about To see if he could find Parthenia out; But she was gone, and yet he blindly gropes About the Room, being fill'd with fruitless hopes At last to find her; but his sleepy pace Brings him with speed unto the fatal place Of execution; down the stairs he falls, And falling wakes, and waking, swears, and bawls For Justice on Parthenia, whilst he cryes, Revenge, revenge, my swelling injuries Upon that cursed Hagg; Oh let her be Confin'd to Hell for perpetuity; Oh where am I, cryes he, can any tell Except the Devil; Am I not in Hell; Or do I dream; yet Dreams do seldom show Reality; I'm bruis'd and batter'd,—Oh— My head, my shoulders, nay, and every part Does now contrive to breed an aching heart; What Devil toss'd me hither, must I be The Tennis-ball of Hell? Oh tyranny; What, have they drencht me in the Stigian Lake? For I am wet, my head, my shoulders ake; What streams are these, that run, and flow about My face, and ears, what are my brains beat out? Oh help, for pitty help,; what shall I lye Brainless, and helpless, and unpitied dye; What is the world grown deaf? or do I call Without regard? Oh most accursed fall; I cannot help my self, 'tis therefore vain For me to strive to crawl up stairs again; Well then, since none will pity, farewel breath, I'le be content to groan my self to death: Thus lay Dimagoras, groaning forth a curse, His cryes were terrible, his groans were worse. The trembling Goaler heard his groans, his cryes; But had as little power to pray, as rise; He is all fear, no hopes can reconcile His thoughts to Heaven, his actions are so vile; He call'd his sins before him with intent To add unto them, but not to repent; Goalers are Hells pawn-brokers, for they take Forty, per Cent. and doe't for pity sake; Sometimes they'l carry (with a dexterous art) Heav'n in their face, the Devil in their heart; And 'tis well known, th' oppressed pris'ners cry, Is their delight; their groans, their melody: Reader, consider but a Goaler well, You'l find him Devil, and his prison, Hell: But whither run I: must Dimagoras lie Pickled in blood without a remedy: The day appears, the Goaler now begins To stare about him, and forget his sins, He now starts up; His Wife being grave &amp; wise, Bids him confess his faith before he rise; Faith (says the Goaler) what should that thing be? If I keep faith, in troth 'twill not keep me: Tell me of faith, Hell bury thee alive; 'Tis sweet oppression makes a Goaler thrive: She speaks again; why, Minion, what dost ayle Says he; Faith will not silver-lace thy tail, Nor feed your wants: No more; for if you do, Your Faith shall be your meat, and clothing too; The name of that bare word will make me fail, 'Twill prove a poyson, and break ope my Goal; 'Tis much like Mercury, because 'twill eat Through Iron bars, nay, 'tis a thing will cheat, The Devil, nay, I tell thee without doubt, If we keep that, 'twill let our pris'ners out; I fear, I fear, this very word portends Some mischief unto us, or to our friends: My dreams were sad this night, me thoughts the great Lyconian Lord was grown so spruce, and neat, That all the world admir'd him, nay, his brain (Untun'd by frenzy) was now tun'd again, And at the last me thoughts I saw him lye Upon a Couch, and our Lutosa by, Braiding his hair; he gently seem'd to play And toy with her,, but in a civil way; At last me thoughts I heard a noise, that made My trembling unprovided heart afraid; I started from my sleep, made haste, and went To rise, but that thy Language did prevent, And hinder my design; I thank my Fate I never heard a word did more abate My courage, for, indeed, I was inclin'd To rise, and run to quarrel with the wind; But such another word (I'le tell thee true) Would make me use a pris'ner like a Jew: But now I'le rise, but prethee speak no more, Nor name that word which once you nam'd before; But now I think on't, I must haste and go Unto my Lord Dimagoras, and know What he intends; the King hath gave him leave To take the air; but yet I can perceive No great desire he hath to leave this place; My Paradice sure pleases well his grace; But e're he stirs, I will be sure that he (Were he my flesh and blood) shall pay his Fee; I'le hast and see what his wise Lordship saith, Good morrow Wife; Pray not a word of faith: Away he goes; no sooner was he come Within the door of the scarce-twilight room, But he espies confusion; for the Bed Was thrown quite open, and Dimagoras fled: The Goaler, much affrighted, hasts away Unto his Wise, and thus began to say; I am undone, cryes he, undone, Good Wife Be civil to me, quickly take a knife And cut my throat, Dimagoras is fled, I shall be hang'd, Oh that I now were dead; Prethee dispatch me, for 'twill be disgrace To see thy husband hang'd before thy face; Call up my servants quickly, whilst I stay And see if I can force my self to pray; Good Wife make haste, be quick; away she flyes, And runs down stairs with light'ning in her eyes; She calls her servants, but they could not hear, For sleep had barrocado'd every ear; At last, away she runs, thinking to call Her Daughter; but she stumbling, catch'd a fall; They say that women stumble at a straw; But this I'm sure was none, because she saw It was Dimagoras, who begun to cry Torment me not Parthenia, let me dye, I am half dead, Oh do me not the wrong To hinder me, I'have liv'd too too long Too long: with that up gets the Goalers wife, Runs to her husband, husband safe thy life, Dimagoras, Dimagoras ? and there She wanting breath, was forc'd to gape for air; With that the Goaler, for a little space Stood still, and she stood staring in his face; They both were mute; the Goaler thought it vain To speak to her that could not speak again; But looking strictly on her, he espies Her hands, her cloths all bloody, then he cryes Out murther, murther: and by this time, all The house was up, who hearing him to call, And cry out murther, came all arm'd to see What was the matter; but by this time, she Had taken breath, and told her husband, that Dimagoras was not fled, but to say what The matter was, she knew not; but her haste Made her to trip, and tumble cross his wast. The Goaler now looks big, begins to swear By Hercules, that all things were not fair; He snatch'd his sword into his hand, and run Down stairs, to see the things that had been done, Where being come (attended with his Guard) He lookt about, but could not see, yet heard Sad groans, as could by horror be exprest; (But to find pity in a Goalers brest Is more then miracle) he hunts about, Yet could not find (what he expected) out; He calls his Wife, and says, 'tis strange that she Should stumble at a thing, he could not see. Prepostrous fool, says she, suppose that men, Should know how oft their wives did fall; what then? By this I see your zealesie appears, Your horns, good man, are longer then your ears, Says she; Come follow me, I'le shew you where Your Pris'ner lyes, lift up your horns, look there, Look well upon him, judge him if you can To be a knowing able womans man; The Goaler now provides him, to debate The cause, and reason, of his low estate; Goes nearer to him, wills him to express The dismal cause of this unhappiness; But all in vain, Dimagoras, whose eyes Were glew'd with blood, cou'd not behold his wise And careful Goaler, neither did he find Whose voice it was, being, deaf, as well as blind; With that the Goaler seeing 'twas in vain To question him, whose fear, more then his pain, Made him elingued, gave command that he Should be committed to his bed, and be Observ'd with care, whilst he himself, would run And fetch a Chirurgion, which thing being done, He brings him in, who presently provides To patch his head, and plaister up his sides; He wash'd his head, then takes his Probe, and tries The deepness of his wounds; Dimagoras cryes, What you mean, ye Hell-hounds, are ye come To bring me to a second martyrdom; Torment me not, 'tis known that I have store Of plagues already, then what need I more? Oh that my eyes were open, that I might But see the day, how blest a thing is light? Say, are ye men, or Devils? by and by, Reply'd the Chirurgeon your observing eye Shall testifie the truth, so by degrees Unglews his eye-lids, and Dimagoras sees, And knows them all; he being gently drest, Tells his misfortune, and so goes to rest; After some hours of sleep, Dimagoras wakes, Finding himself at ease, he gently shakes His slumbers off; and then begins to call To minde the fate of his unlucky fall; He well remember'd that he dream'd he should Receive a sudden fall, a fall that would Prove prejudicial, which he found too true; But mist the Damosel promis'd to ensue, And dress his wounds; nay, and he calls to mind Her name, and cryes Lutosa was unkind Not to appear; but yet he hop'd his fate, Would yet prove kind, it being not too late: His longing soul now groans, and sighs to see Some good, after so much of miserie; Alas, says he, has providence forgot To send thee hither, ah why com'st thou not In spight of Fate? be certain I will prove A constant lover' never to remove My well-fix't thoughts: Love has a secret art, I am already wedded in my heart; I hugg thee in my soul; Oh do not stay My dear Lutosa, come, Oh come away; My thoughts, are by thy absence, much increast; And thus I take up love at interest; Save these extream expences, and command That I may take it at a better hand; Oh come: Having so said (half void of hope) The door being softly mov'd, did gently ope; In comes a thing, whose worth is best exprest By saying nothing, Reader, judge the rest; And yet because truth may be clearly shown, It was the Goalers daughter, who was known, And call'd Lutosa,; this is she, whose beauty, As it commanded, so it proffer'd, duty Unto Dimagoras; Reader, wouldst thou hear Her Character; be patient, and give ear: ‘First, she was natures over-sight, and then ‘Her fathers darling, and a scorn to men: ‘Her mother oft would say, she was begot, ‘When peevish nature did, she knew not what; And this is she, (Dimag'ras dream'd) was fair, Was rich, was wise, nay, and Apollo's heir; But let me whisper, and I'le tell thee what, Believe quite contrary, and she was that: 'Tis more then double misery to dwell Upon a name, whose Character, is Hell; She was a Goalers daughter; what need more? The consequence denotes her to be—W? Yet good enough for him, whose lep'rous name Deserves no other Wife, then lasting shame; She stares upon Dimagoras, who now Begins to view her with a wrinkled brow; His faith depending on his flattering dream, Makes him believe that she is all extream; His love-sick thoughts are plotting how to praise And court her beauty, in an amorous phrase; He calls her to him, she (not being coy) Stradles unto him, and begins to toy And wanton with his hair, entreats, desires, To dress his wounds, and with much zeal, requires The reason of his raging grief; whilst he Is ravish'd with her affabilitie; His trembling hand seizes her dirty paw, Her daring Nose still keeps her mouth in awe, Or else she had, (more to compleat his bliss) Crown'd his pale lips, with a be-slabbering kiss; He sighs, and she, as willing to requite His pains, endeavours with much speed and might To answer him, but counld not, for she knew Not how to sigh, but gave a grunt, or two, Which (to speak truth) did very much content Dimagoras, who thought that she had rent, Her heart in pieces; after that, she throws Her goggle-eyes about, and then bestows A wide-mouth'd smile upon him, which exprest Ten thousand joys, he thinks himself as blest As bliss can make him, and begins to take Couragious boldness, passionate to make Humble addresses to her; She begins T' admire her self, he courts her and she grins, Grows now a little coy; and will not stay, But by compulsion; strives to go away, Because she knows she cannot; Oh what pains He takes to hold her, whilst she strives and strains T' unscrew her self; why, let me go, says she, Or I will tell your incivilitie Unto my father, who will make you know What 'tis to use his virgin Daughter so; I will be gon, with that Dimagoras vents A showr of tears, and shews his discontents, By his too-stedfast looks, which made her show An angry brow, although it were not so: 'Tis importunity makes women prove Insulting tyrants over proffer'd love: Dimagoras sues, and begs, whilst she replies, Away with these your false, fond flateries; My mother told me, that I must not yeild At first; and they are Cowards quit the field At the first on-set; nay, my mother told me, Men do not always love me, when they hold me; She charg'd me too, when men desir'd to know Whether I could affect; at first, say no: And here she whisper'd, Oh unhappy I, It goes against my stomack to deny; And though I dare not in a present sense Yet I may love you in the Future Tense; Then let me go, you shall not be withstood If you'l but keep in the Optative Mood: Away she trundles, whilst his nimble eye Pursues her to the last discovery. The door being shut, and his Lutosa fled, He then composed his distracted head; Begins to ruminate, and call to mind Her several graces, and with what a kind Aspect she look't upon him, then to say She had no crime, but that she went away; But Oh ye powers, cryes he, do but befriend My wishes with success, and quickly send My soul unto me, for alas I own Nothing of life, when my Lutosa's gone: I am a Statue, nay, and what is worse, Her present absence makes my life a curse; Ah, where art thou my dearest, do not stay Too long but come; Oh quickly come away, Here, here, thy languishing Dimagoras lyes Wounded, with what must cure, thy balmy eyes; Let thy disquiet heart permit no rest To crowd into thy heart, till thou hast blest Thy dearest with a visit: Couldst thou see My heart, my dear, Oh thou wouldst pity me. The door (which seem'd to pitty) by degrees Was op'ned, but alas Dimagoras sees, Not what he lookt for, for it prov'd to be The Goaler, and Chirurgion, come to see, And dress his wounds, so after he had done Departs; And then the Goaler thus begun. My Lord, I thought it fit to let you know If you desire to take the air, and go A mile or two; I shall this afternoon Be ready to attend you, and as soon As with conveniency your Lordship shall Give me command, I will attend your call; To which Dimagoras (after thanks) reply'd, Your civil kindness shall not be deny'd; Therefore this afternoon, I shall prepare My self, and willingly enjoy the air; But being (you know a stranger) must depend Vpon your interest, for I have no friend To welcome me; Thus having understood What I intend; do what you shall think good: To which the Goaler thus reply'd, My Lord, Arcadia it a Country doth afford Both courtesie and plenty, 'tis well known, That civil entertainmet's always shown, Especially to strangers; never doubt, My Lord, we'l finde good entertainment out: There is a Knight, not two Leagues from this place (Whose hospitable goodness gives a grace, And life to fame) whose seat, is truly, call'd The Pallace of delight, being fenc'd, and wall'd About with Marble; Art and Nature, were A long time plotting how to make it rare; And many curious eyes, have often went To see, and judge, which was most excellent, Nature, or Art; but none could justly tell, Because they both endeavour'd to excell: Unto this place, my Lord, if you think fit, We'l steer our course, but let us not omit Our oppertunity, my Lord, time flies Without reclaim, conveniency bids rise, Whilst I, my Lord, will hasten to prepare Accomodations, this shall be my care. Away the Goaler went, who being gone, Dimagoras began to think upon His dear Lutosa, nothing could proclaim Him happy, but this crooked piece of shame; But time draws on, Dimagoras now prepares To take his Journey, loaded with more cares Then ever; Now he labours to pretend An indispose, as hoping to befriend Himself with an advantage how to speak With his Lutosa, or his heart must break; But see how all things seemingly concurr To make compleat his happiness in her; For in she comes, I will not now expres; Her comely carriage, or her dirty dress; Her graceful dopps, no, nor her sheep-like eyes, It is enough, Dimagoras discries Nothing but beauty joyn'd with equal parts, Sufficient to subdue the stontest hearts; He stroaks his Beard, and with a well-pleas'd look He step'd unto her, chring'd, and after took Her by the hand; judge then what follows next, Not much of consequence from such a Text: He look'd as if his hopeless heart were breaking, Nor could he speak for sighs, she ligh, for speaking But at the last, perpending well, how short The time would be, he treated in this sort: My dear Lutosa, wonder not, I know Thy name, for fancy told me it was so; Moreover, I was warned in a dream T' adore that beauty which I found extream: Then blame me not (because in thee I finde My dream fulfill'd) to proffer thee my kinde, And true affections, for by all that's good I love thee equal with my dearest blood; The world shall not exclude thee from my arms, I will defend, and guard thee from all harms; Oh that I were in Arms, that I might try; For love gives courage, courage victory: I'le plough the Ocean, rip up Mountains, make The knit brow'd-surly-cragged Rocks to quake At my appearance; nay, if Hell shall dare To contradict me, he shall feel a share Of my impos'd revenge, there's nothing can Withstand th' attempts of a resolved man; I am resolv'd, let all the world conspire Against me, I will crown my blest desire With good effect; If my Lutosa say It shall be done, 'tis done, who dare gain-say? If any dare oppose, let him be shown To me in Arms; I'le warrant thee mine own: If Mars should come in person, and propound But love to thee. I'de make him kiss the ground: What were Knight Errants, only arrant knaves, And base Impostors, nay, the very slaves Of time, and fortune, prating thus, and thus; And such an other thing was Argalus, Compar'd to me; I'm confident that fate Dares not to make me less then fortunate: Suppose (my dear affected) thou wert now Inclos'd with Bulls, and Bears, dispairing how To save thy life, and I by chance come by, And view my Dearest in such misery; Oh how I'de make those Tyrants fly, and run Like subject mists before the Princely Sun: What says my Love, wilt thou accept a heart Unconquerable, but by thee, who art Commandress of my soul; wilt thou incline To my request, and tell me thou art mine? Forget that female custome, do not say The child of Love, cannot be in one day Begot, nay bred, and born; for it must be Encreast, brought forth, by times maturitie; Believe not these fond falseties, for know Love is an active, sprightly thing, will grow Insensible; 'tis more then petty treason Against the God of Love, to love by reason: What reason was there, that there should be seen So much intire affection between Vulcan and Venus; Cupids Arrows fly Not always constant, sometimes low, then high; For I have known, a Noble Lord, express Affection to an humble Shepherdess; How many high-born Kings did often prove Sad Martyrs in the common flames of love; But this (I must confess) discretion must Not attribute to Love, so much as Lust; There may be Love, in Lust, but 'tis well known To be a spurious, and a bastard one; Such Love, like Mother-pearl, does oft send forth A glorious luster, but is little worth: Or like that foolish fire, which men say Only mis guids, and leads men from their way, And then it leaves them like a sudden blast, Whose fierce extreams portend it cannot last; This is a mock-love, only fit to be The subject of our hatred; thus you see, My (Dear Lutosa) and may well infer From hence, that perfect Love can never err; For notwithstanding love may like the fire, Whose rapid flames, do often times aspire; And sometimes wanting fuel to maintain It's strength, does seemingly go out again; Yet, without doubt, the fire is still the same, The cause being gon, th'effect must needs be lame; Love is the ground of Love, a thing divine, And truly Noble, such a Love is mine; My dear Lutosa come, let me infold, And lock thee in mine Arms, er'e time grows old. Let not the prime of Love be spent in toys, At my return I will compleat my joys By sacred Matrimony; speak, my Dear, And let a speedy, free consent appear, Though usher'd with a blush; 'tis always known The Rose does never blush until 'tis blown; Reply (my Dearest) time cannot allow A fitter opportunity then now; Wilt thou compleat the blessings of my life, And crown me with the comforts of a Wife; Speak, speak my Joy, or let thy silence be The proclamation of our unitie; I must be gone: She stares upon his face, As if her looks would speak, and for a space She held him by the hand, with an intent To speak, but that the Goaler did prevent Her resolutions; so being heavy hearted, He sighs, she grunts, he sighs again, and parted: Away he went, scarce knowing what he did, And love sick passions are not eas'ly hid: At last when he had made a near approach, He spies a Guard stand round about his Coach, Which unexpected object made him vent In whispers, his unruly discontent; He calls the Goaler to him, makes his ear The privy-Chamber of his new-bred fear; His fear was so extream, that every part Declar'd in trembles, his afflicted heart: The Goaler wonders at this sudden change, Speaking but softly, said, my Lord, 'tis strange To see what alteration's newly bred; You that but now advanc'd your stately head As high as Heav'n, do now abuse your birth Make honour blush, to see you court the earth With your depending crest; my Lord, advance Your drooping soul, fear not, nor fate, nor chance Shall do you wrong, this Guard is to attend, And wait upon your Honour, to defend Your noble Person; well, if good success Proves this a truth, says he, that you express, Be well assur'd, that thou shalt ever find A grateful friend; but prethee prove so kind To tell me truly, is it not intended That I shall dye, because I am befriended With such a Guard, I fear 'tis too too true But you are loath to tell me, prethee do: Let these few Angels tutor thee to speak The speedy truth, or else my heart will break: With that the Goaler, (Oh th' effect of gold, What Town? What Garrison is that can hold Against such Batteries?) suddenly reply'd: May all the plagues of Hell, my Lord, betide And fall upon me, may they be encreast To more then infinite, if in the least Your death's intended; now, my Lord, be free In your beleif, enjoy your liberty; As for the Guard, assure your self they are To wait in honour, till you take the aire: And so my Lord, be pleased to possess Your Coach, and you shall see their readiness To do you honour; so away they went, Dimagoras being mod'rately content, Until he came into the Street and spy'd Such throngs of people, and how he was ey'd By every one, who lookt, but on this score As he suppos'd, never to see him more; Nay that which more confirm'd him, was, his ear (Which then was much attentive) seem'd to hear Some curse and say Now may the hang-man take And truss the villain for Parthenia's sake: These words were bitter Corasives; now he Curses the Goalers infidelitie; He thinks to quit the Coach, but then his thoughts Presents before him his unequal faults; Resolves to stay, because he thinks the Rout Would have no mercy till his Brains were out: At last seeing himself begin t' appear Without the City, he begins to cheer, And stroak his Beard, his peaceful heart doth now Begin to sit in tryumph on his brow: ‘Fear is the senses whirlewind, for it blows ‘The minds chief faculties away, and throws ‘The reason out of order, judgment must ‘Be whirl'd in to the lofty aire, like dust: Dimagoras can witness this conclusion. ‘Folly and fear are parents of confusion: ‘And he whose fear exceeds his reason, borrows ‘A fair advantage to encrease his sorrows; But now Dimagoras his stormy mind Grows calm, and quiet; now he is enclin'd T' observe the Countries pleasure, which indeed Does justly claim the priviledge to exceed: She's natures eldest Daughter, wears the Crown Of pleasure, plenty, jewel'd with Renown; And to speak truth, she truly can invite The strictest eye, to banquet with delight; But in respect she has been prais'd before By better Pens then mine, I'le say no more: Thus having brought Dimagoras, though with fear Yet with much safety, out of Town, I'le steer My course towards his Lutosa, who is now In labour with her thoughts, complotting how With most advantage, to declare her mind Unto her Mother; Fortune proving kind Just at that instant, brought her Mother in, Which gave Lutosa courage to begin, And thus proceed:—Mother, says she, I must Commit a secret, to your care, and trust, Which is as follows: ? ? Our Lyconian Lord Of late hath pleas'd in passion to afford Large promises of Love; but Mother, know Because you bid me, I still answer'd, No; But still the more that I deny'd, the more He importun'd me, and would not give o're His strong requests, swearing by all the powers Above, before th' expence of many hours, He would; though with the hazard of his life, Finish his joys, by making me his wife; Oh how he vow'd; And there, with much ado, She wrings, and squeezes out, a tear or two; And then she cryes, Mother I must confess I love the man more then I can express: Oh Mother! how his circling Arms did twine About my waste, he call'd me his Divine And Dear Lutosa, holding fast my hand, And staring in my face, whilst there did stand A Pearly showre within his pretty eyes, As Arguments of his extreamities; Oh how he wrong my hands, and would not let Me go, but like an Owl catch'd in a Net I flutter'd up, and down, but all in vain The more I strove, the more he would constrain, And keep me, swearing that he car'd not whither His life, or I went first, or both together; So dearly does he love me, and I'm sure His stedfast love will constantly endure, It will, it will; Oh how my Spirits burn, I am inflam'd, I long for his return; Mother, 'twil add unto your aged life A score of years, to see your daughter, wife Unto a Noble Lord: Ah Daughter, Daughter, Reply'd the Mother, mind what follows after; 'Tis no such happiness to be his Spouse That makes (with an intent to break) his vows Besides, what joy, what pleasure can there be In this his love's extream extremitie. Extreams, like bubles, swell, but cannot last, Nor claim more durance then a sudden blast; Suppose you were invited as a Guest To some rich Banquet, or a Marriage Feast, Tell me, nay quickly tell me, would you eat By well-cram'd handfulls, such delitious meat, Or by degrees? Reason, and Nature are For moderate uses; they that eat to spare, Spare oft to eat; Thus consequence may prove There is no surfeit like a whole-sale love; Moreover, do you think that wit or art Can make it good to my experienc'd heart, That he, vile man, (that never yet was true To any) will be constant unto you; Beleive it not; but yet, for ought I know, He being mad, perhaps has made you so; Only in this, the match is very fit, Because you truly equal him in wit; Moreover, call to mind how he abus'd Divine Parthenia, nay, and basely us'd Our most Renown'd Celania, whom I wish The Gods defend and guard from prejudice: He is a Traytor to the Laws of Reason, Begot by murther, and brought forth by treason: And do you think that he which was content To'abuse those Beauties which were excellent Can dote on you, that only have a beauty Can boast equivolency to your duty. Which (to speak truth) is nothing; you inherit Your Fathers baseness, with as base a spirit: Nature did crowd into the world a curse When thou wert born, and could not make thee worse; But now you fondly hope to change your life; You'l be a Lords, and I a Goalers wife; Your cruel Father, doubtless will be proud To hear this news, pray tell it him aloud; With that away she flung, clapps to the door, Being tyr'd with what she heard, would hear no more, Where now I'le leave them, for I am to make What haste, what speed I can, to overtake Dimagoras in his Journey; but a while I'le rest, not turn a pleasure to a toyl. The end of the Third Book. THE Fourth Book. Fly gentle Pegasus, it now must cost Us labour, to redeem the time that's lost, Dimagoras has gone much ground, whilst we Loyt'ring behind, have lost the libertie Of hearing his discourse, which, without doubt Was pleasing; Come let's hast to find him out. My Muse has overtaken him, and now He's very busie in observing how The Country lay, whilst his observing eye Upon a hills assent, did soon discry A Stately Pallace, which indeed gave more Content, then all that he had seen before; It was Kalanders Pallace, who indeed (As 'twas impossible he should exceed His Fathers virtues) equally exprest As much of bounty, with a noble breast: Dimagoras (much contented) makes a stand, First views the house, and then surveys the Land; Observes each herd of Cattel, how they browse And inter-weave themselves amongst the boughs; Then his obliquor eyes (with living chear Banquet themselves) observes the well-fed Deer Crusted within a wall, that would invite Meer gluttony unto an appetite: Then with a more, then half reverted eye (Being greedy in his looks) he did espye Hugh flocks of well-fleec'd sheep, whose frisking Lambs Would (in obedience to their blating Dams, And their own hunger) oft kneel down, and tugg The swelling bounty of th' exuberous dugg; Nor did his eye alone Monopolize These several pleasures; for his ears, likewise Were courted with delight; in this they got The upper hand, the eyes could see them not; Yet by the ears direction they could see The happy Authors of this melodie: It was four Damosels, sitting on the ground Cussion'd with Hillocks, lab'ring to confound Their sorrows in a Ditty; having took There several seats neer to a neighbouring Brook, Whose silver streams, being proud to overflow Their virdent banks, stood still, as't twere, to show An admiration, seeming to express An humble duty to each Shepherdess; At last (having not Neptunes grant to stay) They shrunk within their bounds, &amp; danc't away: Dimagoras (though well-pleas'd) was not content To hear at distance, crav'd the free consent Of his attentive Goaler, to go near Unto the place, and undiscovered hear Their Amarous Songs; The Goaler gave consent, They quit the Coach, and so away they went; But er'e they could arrive unto the end Of their desires they were enforc'd to lend Their ears to new delights, a voice was sent Into their souls, to cause a ravishment; They both amazed, thought, they knew not what Both wondring what it was they wondred at; They now imploy their eyes to pry about To see if they could find this Angel out; At last their heedless paces brought them nigh Unto a Jes'mine Grove, being thick and high; Yet was it not so thick, but that the ear strictly attending, could prevail to hear, And understand these words, which in regard They pleas'd him not, Dimagoras wish'd unheard. Feighn would I love, but dare not trust Because I know the hearts of Men Glory oft times to be unjust, Therefore I'le love I know not when. Happy and blest is she that can Live without this thing call'd Man. Were I like fair Parthenia, And had an Argalus to wo me, Experience bids me sadly say A vile Dimagoras might undo me. Happy and blest is she that can Live without this thing call'd Man. I will not love, nor will I hate, But constant to my vows I'le prove, I'le be contented in this State, When men prove just I'le learn to love. Happy and blest is she that can Live without this thing call'd Man. Then farewell all those flatt'ring toys Which some esteem the greatest pleasure, They are but out-side painted joys, Virginity's the best of treasure. How truly blest is she that can Live without this thing call'd Man. And here Dimagoras, though he did not care T' applaud the matter, yet he lik'd the aire; But his disturbed thoughts were all this while Boyling with rage to hear himself call'd vile: And now he (like a blood-hound) sents about; To see if he can find this party out, Who sent this pleasing, most displeasing Song Into his ears; he had not hunted long Before was represented to his sight (Which indeed pleas'd him not) an armed Knight Who with undaunted courage thus exprest Himself: What are ye Friends that have transgrest Our strict-kept Laws; go back, look up, and see That fair Inscription, read your destinie; With that Dimagoras lifting up his head, Observes th' Inscription, stares upon't, and read To this effect. Let none presume to pass this way, But such as do intend to stay, And give Encounter to a Knight Who will forthwith come in sight; Let him that overcomes remain Till he be overcome again, Or else if he in several fights Can conquer two and fifty Knights He may, at that self same hour Release Corinda from this Bower; And to period all his strife, He is to take her for his Wife; She is a Princess, whose Renown Justly deserves to wear the Crown. Dimagoras having read this dismal story, Not greatly thirsting after short liv'd glory, Looks pale and wan; The Goaler thinks of flying, Trembles, and almost dyes, for fear of dying: Th' impatient Knight forthwith imploys his Page To fetch Accoutrements, whilst with a sage And well-composed countenance he told Dimagoras, that good fortune made him bold In these attempts; for he had often shown Himself a Conqueror, and over-thrown Forty six Knights already, and before We part, says he, I hope to want but four, As now I do but six, for by that fate That sent you hither, I'le expire the date Of both your lives; the world hath truly known Amphialus was never overthrown, Nor ever was my courage fully try'd, Or match'd, except by Argalus, that dy'd By my unequall'd Sword: These thundring words (Though modestly exprest) prov'd two edg'd swords Unto Dimagoras his heart, who made (His fear permitting) this reply, and said, Think not (most worthy Champion) that I fear Because you are Amphialus, or care To meet you in a Combate: 'tis well known Unto this Knight, that I have overthrown More then you boast of; Nay, indeed 'tis true, Reply'd the Goaler; Sir, be pleas'd to view This powerful Warrant, whose Contents will be A bar to your intended Victorie: This is the Lord Dimagoras, who is now My Pris'ner, being one that scorns to bow, Or stoop unto the hardiest Knight that lives; And this is he to whom that Warrant gives A priviledge to take the aire: But when Dimagoras heard those words, he cry'd, what then? Must my concealed, well-known valour, lye Dorment because I want my liberty; Accursed Fate, cryes he, and there he swore; The more perswaded, still he rag'd the more; The courteous Knight desir'd him to surcease His passion, and enjoy a quiet peace; For know, says he, Honour will not permit A present Combate; for, my Lord, as yet You are a Pris'ner (as I understand By this informing Paper in my hand) Therefore (my Lord) If I should boldly enter A Combate with you, I should more then venture My life at once; Suppose (My Lord) that Fate Should Crown me Conqueror, what's my Estate, Or Fortunes worth? I must be sure to stand (For boldly breaking of our Kings Command) In danger of my life; Nor is this all, For this (thy Keeper) will be sure to fall Into the hands of Justice: Therefore now My Lord be satisfy'd, unknit your brow; Go get your Liberty, then fight, and spare not, For now I dare not fight, because I dare not, Your Warrant tyes my hands; What tongue can tell My sorrows for this chance: My Lord farewel. The Knight departs, Dimagoras now would fain Follow, but that the Goaler does restrain, And keep him back; when he begun to know He could not, he the more desires to go; Oh that I had this cursed villain here, Says he, that I might make my worth appear In his disaster! Does he think his Arm Is able to inflict the least of harm Upon my body, no, I'd make him feel The full reward of my chastising steel; Oh how I'd carbonado every part Of his imperious, his perfidious heart; I'de make the wretch revoke his former vows, Or I would hack his body into mouths To plead for pity; Oh my Spirits boyl T' obtain the tryumph of so sweet a spoil: Audatious wretch, that told me to my face That he would bring us both to quick disgrace, If we encounter'd him, yet I dare say, The fool was glad we let him go away; And so were you, my friend, your looks betray'd The troubles of your heart, you were afraid: I must confess, reply'd the Goaler, I Hate fighting with a true sincerity, Except I am enforc'd, and then I show No mercy, for I kill at every blow; And had that proud, and vap'ring Rascal stay'd A little, till my fear had been allay'd, You should have seen with what a dext'rous ski'l I would have wrought the Traytor to my will, Nor do not think my fear did wholly rise From cowardise, but from a quick surprise: Man were not Man, except he were inclin'd To feel the several passions of the mind, As love, and fear, which often discontents The mind with several obvious accidents; Then blame me not; he's valiant can abide, When danger tells him that he must be try'd; But now he's gon, Nor will I so much strain My Valour, as to wish him back again: But now (my Lord) occasion does invite After this storm, to take a fresh delight: Let's haste away, for now our time draws on, My Lord, forget your passion, let's be gon; Away they went into the Coach, and eas'd ('Tis hard to judge which was the better pleas'd) Their trembling limbs, where for a little space We'l leave them, and return unto the place From whence they came; I hope the Reader will Pardon a small digression; whilst my Quill Steps to Corinda's Bowr, and enquire Of several passages, and then retire: First we must know this pleasing Bowr, wherein Corinda was, has for a long time bin A pleasant reseptacle for all such Distressed Ladies, that had griev'd too much For their unconstant Lovers; There they find So many rare diversions of the mind, That fright'ned Melancholy seems to be A non-apparent in that Libertie. Here liv'd the fair Corinda, who indeed In Virtue, Riches, Beauty, did exceed Most of her time, nay, I may boldly say She did exceed, all, but Celania: This Lady, who to safe-guard her delights Was still attended with a hundred Knights, And fifty Damosels, who were still t' invent New Rarities to crown her with content; And whatsoever pastime seem'd to be, Without the Bowr, she stood unseen, to see: It so fell out, Dimagoras was espy'd (With his plump Goaler walking by his side) To pass that way, who being known by most Of all the Knights, they soon began to boast Of their approching past-time, which they knew (If plotted well) would presently ensue; And knowing that Dimagoras his ear Was always very courteous to hear Harmonious strains; they presently made choice Of one, whose more then ordinary voice Would tame a Tyger, nay make sorrow glad Having an Art which Orpheus never had, She has been often times mistook to be An Angel in a Damosels Liverie; And first, this Lady was desir'd to strain Her magick voice, that so they might obtain, And bring him near the Bowr; that so his ear Might with more ease, and more distinctly hear, Himself revil'd, and scorn'd; and how his name Was eccho'd to the world in lasting shame; Nay, that which vext him most, was, in regard Th' attentive Goaler, listning, over heard The same expressions, which indeed enforc'd His present fury, whilst he thus discours'd: From whence proceeds those Philomelian airs Cloath'd in such angry words; whose's that dispairs And wil not love, if Argalus should wo them For fear a vile Dimagoras should undo them? What Hellish tongue pronounc'd so damn'd a word? It is well known Dimagoras is a Lord, Of more obliging courtesie; his Arm Was always ready to defend from harm Distressed Ladies? If I speak a lye, Oh may some well-prov'd Knight appear, and try What I dare act; ? ? At that time did resort (As if that fortune meant to crown the sport With good success) a Clown, whose well-known name Was Clinias, much admired for his Fame, In being infamous; and this was he That strove t' obtain a glorious Victorie Over Demetas; But in short, the Knights (Being covetous to feast with new delights Corinda's eyes) did forthwith send away For Clinias, who arriv'd without delay; And being come, they presently declare Their minds unto him, bid him to prepare, And arm himself; for now it must be try'd Whether his well-prov'd valour will abide A fierce assault: Clinias receives this news With an astonish'd brest, begins to muse; Non plust for want of words, thinks he, should I Shew my self so unworthy to deny This first Command, I should for ever be Disrob'd of honour, cloth'd with infamie; But what care I; What honour can proceed From blood? besides, I truly hate to bleed: May he, whose steely brow invented first This thing call'd fighting, ever be accurst; I hate it with my soul; besides, I vow'd The last Encounter (if I was allow'd The favour of a Conquest) I would never Be valiant more, but live at peace for ever; The very thoughts of fighting is enough To kill me; pish; this honour's but a puff; I'le tell an honourable lye, and say I'm troubl'd with an Ague, and this day 'Twill sojorn in my bones, I'le not dissemble, For I have fear enough to make me tremble, And they shall see't, which sure will make them cease Their importunity, and yeild me peace: But haste requir'd an answer, therefore they Bid him resolve whether he would obey Corinda's pleasure; Clynias having got An Ague in his tongue, replyed not So soon as was expected; but at last (Compounding with his fear) and having past The trouble of his thoughts, he soon displays The colours of his heart, looks up and says, Think not (you most Renowned Knights) that I Have studyed, by my silence, to deny The honour you impose for I protest And swear by sweet Corinda, that my breast Is ready to defend her; but I find A weakness in my body (not my mind) Just at this instant, I am half asleep, (And there he stop'd) I feel a spirit creep Into my bones; Alas I am all frost: Oh how I shake, my strength, my limbs, are lost: Action's the best of cure for this desease Reply'd the Knight, Now therefore if you please To mount your Steed, you'le very much endeare Your self unto Corinda, and appear The object of our praises, for behold How near they come, and will, if not control'd, Attempt the Bowr; with that, sad Clinias, cast His eyes about, and looking, had at last Observ'd it was Dimag'ras, then he cryes, Give me my Horse, my Armour, I despise This thing call'd cold, hereafter, I'le proclaim True valour turns a frost into a flame; Oh how I'le slice the slaves within this hour, And bring the villains heads into the Bowr, And lay them at Corinda's feet, that she May tryumph in my glorious victorie: Now Clinias strives to mount his well-known Steed On the wrong side, whose, allmost cripple, speed Answers his Riders valour; being plac'd Within the Sadle, seem'd to make great hast: Away he goes, and meeting with his foes, He told them, they must labour to oppose His valour, having wilfully transgrest In their approch, as was before exprest: Corinda and the Knights were all this while Within the Bowr, and could not chuse but smile, To hear, and see, how Clinias did behave Himself, observing very much his grave Deportment towards them, for he soon descry'd Their servile fear, which made him swel with pride; But yet he fearing that Dimagoras might, Being (as 'twere) compel'd, presume to fight, He spake bigg words; and to advance his fame, And quell their courage, he usurp'd the name Of bold Amphialus, which sadly made Dimag'ras, more then usually afraid; But when they saw the Page was near at hand With Horse and Arms, they all three jointly stand, Gazing upon each other; Clinias thought T' excuse the matter, and remit the fault, Because it was the first; but that prov'd vain, For then he fear'd, when he return'd again Unto the Bowr, Corinda would command His speedy death; time would not let him stand To reason longer, neither could he stay, So he in short, concludes to run away; Which he had done, had not the Goaler shown His Warrant to him, which was after known To be an amorous Ballad, for indeed Clinias (though looking on it) could not read; But took it in his hand, and for a while He seems to read and now, and then to smile At the Contents; the Goaler having spy'd The wrong end upwards, smil'd, being satisfy'd Of his transcendent ignorance, declar'd What was before related, and prepar'd To march away, desiring first to know Whether that he were satisfy'd or no: I dare not now (said Clinias) but reveal My satisfaction, having hand, and seal To warrant me, and if you please, you may Take your own liberty, and hast away: At which Dimagoras (though much pleas'd) exprest Much discontent with an inraged Brest; But at the last his seeming discontent Gladly abated, and away he went; And so did Clinias, glad withall his heart Of such a fair advantage to depart; And now he thinks each munite is an age Before his near arrival could engage Corinda to a thankfulness; for he Thinks he has more then got a Victorie; At last approaching near the Bowr, a Knight Came forth unto him, wisht him to alight, And enter in, that so he might possess The honour due unto his worthiness; Who having enter'd, presently was brought Unto Corindas presence, whilst he thought Himself in Heaven, and that the time drew near That his long promis'd glory should appear; Corinda viewing him, was well content To see his clownish garb, and after sent The favour of a look, to let him know (As he suppos'd) her goodness to bestow Reward upon his merits; but at last More, then half ravish'd Clinias, having past The bounds of silence, opn'd wide, and said, Most Oderiferous, most refulgent Maid, I, thy notorious friend, that stand before thee Will fight for thee, because I do adore thee; Tell me, my Pigeon, didst thou see how I Behav'd my self, and made the Rascals fly, That would have done thee wrong; pish, I can make An Army fly before me for thy sake; I'le hop o're Walls, and Mountains, nay, I'le dive Into the Ocean to keep thee alive; Me thinks the world's too small, for when I come To fight for thee, I groan for Elbow room; These narrow Confines allmost make me sweat My self to death, for I am grown so great That I must stretch the world; I here profess I will enlarg't, or that shall make me less; How dost thou like me, Wench, come, prethee say Art thou not blest, to see this happy day And me, (thy most Renowned Champion) here To take thy part, when danger shall appear. With that a noble Knight, which then stood by Corinda, made to Clinias this Reply, And said, Sir Knight, this Lady much does wonder She saw no light'ning, when she heard it thunder; She saw your pastime, but she heard no blows, You courted them like friends (she says) not foes; Moreover, 'tis her pleasure you should be Respondent to some questions, which shall be Forth-with propos'd unto you. First you are With speed, and freedom forthwith to declare Why you mis-call'd your self, and said your name Was bold Amphialus, that you had slain So many Knights; she says this must appear To be untrue, Amphialus is here, Now looking on you, and ere you depart Will take revenge upon your perjur'd heart: Clinias takes courage (for it is conceit Makes all our actions either small or great) And thus reply'd; Sir Knight, I do conceive My self much injur'd, for you would bereave And rob me of my honour, when as I Have dearly bought it of mine enemy; As for Amphialus, I must confess, (In the relation of his hardiness) I did him honour, not appropriate His name, but sung the glory of his fate; And this was all; moreover, when I saw The Kings broad Seal, and Hand, it was a Law To warrant my forbearance, I protest My vexed soul was never more opprest Then at that present; What is, to a Knight Of valour, more delightful then a fight? But being charm'd by power, what could I do More then I did; Sir Knight, I speak to you. Corinda, and her Ladies (all this while Being in labour with a hearty smile) Were now delivered, which truly sent To Clinias his heart no small content; For fools love all extreams, because, sometimes They censure smiles to be the greatest crimes; But when their apter faiths perswades their brest That every word's a meritorious jest (Because it is most non-sense) then they toyl (And he commits a fault that does not smile) And tugg for jests; But yet in Reasons School Who laughs because, another is a fool, ‘Condems himself; I therefore only shall ‘Say Clinias was a fool, and that is all; ‘How many great pretenders to the Sword ‘(As well as he) could never read a word? ‘Yet what a bluster in the world they make; The Sword's their Pen, their Book, with which they take Such large accounts, that 'twill at last be known They have expended more then was their own; But I must haste Dimagoras now draws near To his desires, where all things do appear Delightful to his wish; his greedy eyes (Being satiated with varieties) Conceal'd themselves, that so they might obtain (When reinvited to observe again) New strength; but at the last they were descry'd ('Tis known great persons seldom go uney'd) By several servants, which did then attend Upon Kalander, who did forthwith send (Being then a time of war) to prove, and know Whether that they were enemies or no; But when Dimagoras was for certain told This real truth, his troubled heart grew cold, Not knowing what the matter was, for he Thought every bush a fatal enemy: By which example we may sadly find The strange effects of a tormented mind, At last 'twas known Kalander only sent To know for certain what was the intent Of their approach, which when Dimagoras knew, He soon lookt up, endeavouring to renew His former courage, giving that respect Was due; And after, spake to this effect: I well perceive (my friends) says he, ye are Attendants to this Lord, whose pleasant aire, And stately Pallace, makes me bold to be His Orator, desiring libertie A while to be his Guest, I'le therefore stay To wait his favourable answer; Nay Reply'd the Servants, you may please, my Lord, T' approach, we know his goodness will afford A lib'ral wellcome; 'tis well known, that he Is not a niggard of his Courtesie. Therefore be pleas'd t' approach without delay, And we'le be bold (my Lord) to lead the way; Away they went; At last they drawing near Unto the house, Kalander did appear Nobly attended, which Dimagoras spy'd, And soon dis-Coach'd himself, and thus aply'd Himself unto him; If my unhandsome Fate, My Lord, says he, makes me unfortunate In my obtaining favour from your hands For my presumption, here your servant stands To wait your will; With that, Kalander stayd The Current of his Language, and thus sayd. My Lord, if your offences be so great As you express, 'tis fit I should retreat From thoughts of pardon; unto which intent Walk in my Lord, and take your punishment; I must assure you that 'twill much exceed The merit of your crime; My Lord, you need Have more then usual patience: This discourse Had allmost made Dimagoras divorce His thoughts, from his intents, his wit affords No sense to understand Kalanders words; These are but homely Complements, thinks he, Is this the effect of his lib'ralitie? Let what will happen, I am fully bent, Thinks he to enter, and expect th' event; So being led into a spacious Hall Whose uniformity might justly call It self most Excellent, and could supply The ear with rare delights, as well as th' eye, Where being come, Kalander does address Himself unto him, with a chearfulness Disconsonant to what Dimagoras did Expect, and with a graceful presence bid Him freely welcome, which did much repair His drooping spirits, and decrease his care; So after mutual Ceremonies past They both sat down, Dimagoras often cast His eyes upon the Pictures; but before His nimble senses could half look them o're. His ears were courted with such melodies That now he's turn'd all ears, that was all eyes; He lookt about, but could not apprehend From whence those Heav'n-bred Raptures should descend But on a sudden (just before his eyes) Two folding doors flyes ope, and he espyes Variety of objects; Now his ears, And eyes are grown at variance, and he fears One sense disturbs another, for the eyes, And ears are so antartique, that it lyes Not in the power of nature to unite Or reconcile the ears unto the sight; Although 'tis not deny'd they often are Assistant to each other; yet I dare Presume to ask this question; tell me whither That they can see, and hear, and judge together, Both at one instant; but it is in part Answer'd, because Dimagoras his heart Did truly wish it lay within his power, To be or deaf, or blind, for half an hour; My judgement's satisfy'd enough to know Both eyes, and ears, were captivated so, That 'twas, nay very difficult, to tell Which object did most please, which most excel: The first thing represented to his eye, Was a rare Fountain, whose curiosity Was known by this Inscription writ thereon, I'm Made For Wonder Not Description. Under whose fluent eyes Dame Flora lay Nursing her off-spring for the Month of May; Each swelling Hillock gladly seem'd to be Much pleas'd at their so near deliverie; Whilst from the Christal Fountain there did flow Like April showrs, fresh streams to make them grow Against the general Mid-wife of the earth Should shew the world a party-colour'd birth; Nor was this all; for there, the lofty Pine, The Beech, the Cedar, did as 'twere combine To in wilderness this Fountain; but yet so, That the refreshing Sun might come, and go To court her streams, being welcom'd by a quire Of warbling Nightingals, who would retire Into the Thickets, and at every noat Ravish the Sun, and make him seem to doat Upon their harmony, and pry about (As 'twere) to find these feathered Syrens out, Whilst Zepherus being favourably kind, Would with a sober, and refreshing wind Move back the dangling-boughs, whose leaves conceal'd A pleasure not much fit to be reveal'd; It was Diana, and her Virgin crew, Going (as often times they use to do) To bathe themselves; but being near undrest, The doors clapt too, and would not let the rest For modesty be seen, so without stay, Dimagoras curst the doors, and went away; By which it does most perfectly appear His eye was better pleased then his ear; The sight, and musick ending both together, Dimagoras knew not what to think, nor whether 'Twere Art, or Nature that had all this while With sweet delusions labour'd to beguile His ravish'd senses, neither did he much Desire to know, for his delights were such, That he (inspir'd with an enlivening mirth) Beleiv'd himself in Heaven, and not on earth; And it had past for current I dare sware Had he not spy'd his ill-look'd Goaler there Kalander all this while sate still, and took A perfect Character of every look; And so perceiving that his ravisht brest Inclin'd him to extreams; he thus exprest. My Lord, your punishment does now present It self unto you, in the small extent Of my abilities to entertain Your Noble self, and your most worthy Train; But be assur'd, my Lord, if wishes could Creat a real Feast, I quickly would Wish Cleopatra's dainties to delight, And bring refreshment to your appetite; But since my wishes, and my fortunes are Extreamly different, I shall forbear Further discourse, my Lord, 'tis my intent To lead you to your further punishment, Therefore I crave excuse; My Lord, reply'd Dimagoras, I will follow, and abide What you shall please t' inflict, because I know No danger can proceed from such a foe: At last (discoursing as they went) they came Into a stately Room, the very same Wherein disguis'd Parthenia met her dear, Her Dearest Argalus, after a year Of hopeless separation; being brought Into this Room, Dimagoras forthwith thought There was variety of Heavens, begins To think what he did there with all his sins; He turn'd his head, and as he lookt, he spy'd His well-paunch'd Goaler staring by his side; To whom his ready lipps begun t'express; His new-bred joy for this his happiness, But being soon prevented by a Train Of Ladies, was enforced to restrain His nimble tongue, and forthwith turn the stream Of his discourse; having so good a Theam, He thus began: Most splendent Stars, says he, Your Beauties give my tongue the Liberty To call you excellent, I must confess I want a flood of language to express Those innate virtues which do truly rest Discovered by each eye, in every brest; Therefore my admiration shall supply My tongues defect: My Lord, you soar too high In your hyperboles, reply'd the fair. And virtuous Ladies, neither do we care To hear such vain Encomiums; and we can Presume to slight the flateries of man; (Dimagoras being charm'd, he only took (Though not to speak) the priviledge to look, And gaze about him; but at last he spy'd Parthenias Picture, which he sadly ey'd, And blusht at every look, his eyes exprest A world of passion warring in his brest, Which grave Kalander seeing, soon addrest Himself unto him, whilst he thus exprest Your tell-tale looks (my honoured Lord) declare That you are struck with death, and that you are Now drawing on, 'tis therefore good to be My Lord, prepar'd for such a certaintie, Death is a speedy change, were his conclusion Like his exordium, what a strange confusion Would fall upon us; but our finite pains Are crown'd at last, with everlasting gains; But since 'tis so, that death begins t'appear Upon your Stage of life, My Lord, draw near Unto your self, for you will find that death (Whose entrance gives an exit to your breath) Will prove a rugged, an intrusive guest; When he's in earnest, 'tis in vain to jest; Therefore, My Lord, since time will not permit Further conveniency, if you think fit To make my brest the office of your will, I will be just, my Lord, pray stand not still, It is a busie time: These words being spoke With serious gravity, had almost broke Dimagoras his heart, yet after he (Consulting with himself) did plainly see There was no signs of death, although his heart Indeed was wounded with a sudden dart Shot from Parthenias image; he reply'd, And said, my Lord, those sorrows which abide, And riot in me, are no signs of death, But the disturbers of my feeble breath; However, for your good advice, I do Return those thanks which reason says is due; But as for death, my Lord, were it as near As you suppose, ide neither start, nor fear, For death is but a period to our strife, A noble passage to a better life; But I perceive, my Lord, nature does make It usual for the wisest to mistake; To which, well pleas'd Kalander, smiling said, My Lord, you are mistaken, and have made A false construction of my Text, 'tis true, I must confess, I said, I thought that you Were struck with death, which if it be deny'd, I'le undergo your censure, and abide The merit of my crime; to which intent I will expatiate my self, and vent The reason of my speech. I did discry When I observ'd, my Lord, your greedy eye Survey Parthenias Image, that your blood Retreated to your heart, and frightned stood A distance from your cheeks, by which I know This Image was that death which wrought your woe; And be assur'd this Image never yet Was view'd by any, but they would forget Their present reason, and would seem to be In love with that they could but only see: But if a silent, empty shadow, can Make such impressions on the heart of man; What would the substance do? Oh this was she Whose latter days were fill'd with miserie; Yet in the flowr of age, she was the flowr Of all her Sex, nor was it in the power Of Nature to do more; she must excell That liv'd, and dy'd without a Parralel; This, this was she, that both in life and death, Left an example to succeeding breath; This is that fair Parthenia, whose glory, Encreast into an everlasting story; This, this was she whose Tragi comick age Begun with pleasure to conclude in rage: Walk further on, My Lord, and you shall see Her cloathed in her Robes of miserie; But I must crave excuse, because indeed The emblems of her suff'rings far exceed The valour of my patience; And, my Lord, The Laws of consanguinity afford A reason for my absence; yet if I Intreat these Noble Ladies to supply, And execute my place; I hope 'twill be Sufficient warrant for my libertie; And so, my Lord, I'le leave you to behold The saddest story ever yet was told; And so they parted. Now Dimagoras grows Conscious unto himself, because he knows, Or at the least suspects, and fears th' event Would prove injurious; so away they went: At last being brought into a stately place Furnisht with Pictures, where each lovely face, Did seem, as 'twere, ambitiously to strive In silent terms to plead themselves alive; But walking further, they did soon discover Abus'd Parthenia, and her raging Lover, Her noble Argalus, whose very look Exprest so much of terror, that it struck Dimagoras to the heart; for when his eye (Although unwilling) saw Parthenia lye Rackt on a bed of horror; he began, Oh miserable Lady, wrethed man! What fury hatch'd this mischief? and displac'd The Pride of nature; she that once embrac'd Perfection in her Beauty, now does lye Perfect in nothing but deformity; Alas, alas; And is it even so? Or is't the Painters Tyranny, to show His cruel skill? Oh most untimely art, See how death lodges in each senseless part; I must be gone, or else my heart will break, I dare not stay for fear her wrongs should speak: My Lord, you being unconcern'd, may stay, Reply'd the Ladies, or else pass this way, Where shall be represented to your sight An object of less horror, more delight; Away they went; Dimagoras all the while Check'd his own thoughts, forgeting not how vile He had been to Parthenia; but at last Comming into a Room being over-cast, And rooft with horror, where his gashly eye Observ'd Parthenia, and himself stand by, Drawn to the life; at which displeasing sight, His heart grew cold, his thoughts were turn'd to night, And lowring with revenge, his tongue let fall A showr of words, he spake unto them all, To this effect: Ladies, says he, this dismal place retains More shapes of horror then deserves our pains In staying in it, and our quick recess Would make our joys be more, our griefs be less, Therefore be pleas'd to let us now retire, And learn to pity what we now admire; For now, alas she's dead, let's therefore strive T' express our griefs that once she was alive T' indure such misery; 'tis always known Extreams are changeable, and seldome own An hour of certainty; for she whose heart Boasted it self above the power of art, Or fate to make her happier, was quite Bereav'd of all; her day being turn'd to night: Even as a stately Fabrick, which but now We see insulting with a lofty brow Over the lesser, which would seem as fair, And much admired if that were not there; But if a tempest comes, it fails, and why? Things most in danger, often stand most high; Even so the fair Parthenia, which indeed (I hope I speak offenceless) did exceed Her Sex in beauty, and had so much store Of pleasure, that her heart could wish no more; Her joys were sum'd in Argalus, and he Compris'd in her, and yet we sadly see Fates sudden change; her beauty soon was thrown And blasted into ruine, she could own Nothing but woe: Since thus it was decreed, Oh blame not him so much that did the deed; Not blame him, cry'd the Ladies, may he never See happy minute, but be curs'd for ever, May plagues, and growing horror dwell about His cursed heart, and keep all comfort out; May all his meat turn scorpions, and his drink Prove fiery-flames; and let all them that think Upon his cursed name, cry out, and say, Most vile Dimagoras, wrong'd Parthenia: Draw near, my Lord, said they, behold, and see This treacherous Monster, whose grand Tyranny Exceeds, almost beleif, behold each part, How they proclaim the treason of his heart: Behold his dangling locks, which now appears Like Serpents circling round about his ears; Observe his megre looks, his hollow eyes, The silent Heraulds of his tyrannies; See how his griping hands tares off the fair And bounteous treasure of her flaxen hair; See how his fury labours to dispence His rage upon her youthful innocence; See how he makes her tender Limbs adore By sad compulsion, the, now happy floor; Happy, because Parthenia Oh sad fate! Did there bewail her miserable state; Happy, because it keeps, and sadly bears A Monument of her defused tears; Alas how poor are all the Indian Mines Compar'd to this, to this, which far out shines A Contenent of Rubies, for there lies Th' unvalued treasure of Parthenias eyes; I mean, her tears, her tears, that truly woe And begg for pity from her cruel foe, That most accurst Dimagoras, that stands Darkening the Sun with his prodigious hands; See how he clouds her beauty with the veil Of horrid poison; Nothing can prevail To stop his fury, which resolves to run, And spend it self until the dreggs are done; Observe, my Lord, would not her looks prevent A petty fury in a bad intent; But this grand Pluto, who resolves to show The abstract of his malice, and o're throw The Idol of the world, does make her cryes, Her groans, her tears, her sighs; his melodies: And thus, my Lord, because I sadly see You seem to sympathize in miserie, With poor Parthenia, I will turn the stream Of my discourse, and chuse another Theam: It only now remains to let you know The punishments of her unequall'd foe The vile Dimagoras, which if you, my Lord, Will please to walk a little, and afford A willing ear) I shall in short relate, And let you know the changes of his fate. It so fell out, that after this most vile, And perjur'd wretch, had triumph'd o're the spoil Of poor Parthenia's beauty, that he fled (Firmly supposing he had murthered Her body with her beauty) from that place Into a wood, where he a little space Pamper'd his soul with the delightful dyet Of full revenge; Thus in a calm of quiet He floated for a minute; but at last His wounds being chil'd with the impetuous blast Of sharp dispair, his conscience, which before Did hardly grumble, then began to roar; Fear (which indeed does evermore controle Within the confines of a guilty soul) Did now begin to riot in each part, And play the Devil in his treacherous heart: My Lord, pray mind this story, for indeed It justly claims the priv'ledge to exceed All stories of this nature ? ? Madam, said Dimagoras, if I humbly might perswade, And woe you to a silence, I should stand Ever obliged to your strict command; For at the present my distracted mind Is rackt with thoughts, and will not be confin'd To any thing that's serious; For of late I have been dogg'd with an unlucky fate; Beleive me Madam, I can hardly own A minutes rest; The story is best known Unto my self; It burns within my brest, Those griefs are greatest which are least exprest. Madam divert your thoughts, me thinks I see A Cloud, which darkens our felicitie, I mean, your Window, which does even woe My hand to open it, that I might know What pleasures are without; Excuse, that I Madam, am bold, to satisfie my eye; With that away he went, and having set The window open, he begun to let His eye survey each rariety; but he (The more he saw, the more desir'd to see) At last espy'd the Pilgrim, in whose eye He read the Characters of gravity; The serious Pilgrim often times would shed A tear or two, then sigh, and shake his head; He whisper'd to himself, and seem'd afraid Himself, should hear himself, but what he said Dimagoras could not hear, because indeed Those Ladies that were with him did proceed In their discourse, which very much opprest His troubled mind; but what they then exprest I will not now relate, for time invites, And calls us unto new, though sad delights; But yet I hope my Reader will suppose Th' effect of their discourse; for he that knows Dimagoras is their subject, well may guess Th' event, and save me labour to express. —. It so fell out, when the declining Sun Declar'd unto the world, that he had run Th' extreamest of his labour, for that day That sad Celania chanc'd to pass that way Where the deep thoughted Pilgrim sate, who minded Nothing but his own mind, and being blinded With contemplation, did not then discover The near approach of this distressed Lover; But like a sluggard, who is loath to rise Until the Sun intrench upon his eyes: Even so the Pilgrim, when Celania glanc'd Before his eyes; rous'd up, and soon advanc'd His drooping head; but this amazed sight Could nor endure th' approach of so much light; Which she perceiving, suddenly did shrowd Her beauty underneath a Cypress cloud; Which when the Pilgrim saw, he soon addrest Himself unto her, and his thoughts exprest To this effect ? Most pensive Virgin, if my serious thoughts Hath made me guilty of too many faults In this my bold attempt, which may indeed Justly assure you that it did proceed From your own promise, which I claim as due; Then pardon him who lives to honour you: And since I see your virtues have enclin'd (If I mistake not) your perplexed mind To the performance of your promise made To me, after your sorrows had betray'd, And brought you to my sight, I crave to know The reason of your grief; Madam, bestow Your confidence upon me; for I vow By these my sacred Weeds, that I will bow My whole endeavours, to procure your peace, Though by my own disquiet; therefore cease Those bashful tears which I perceive distill Out of the Limbick of your tim'rous will; Beleive me then, each word that shall depart Out of your lips, shall drop into my heart, Which now lies open, with a full intent To take them in when you shall give them vent; Therefore uncaptivate those thoughts, which lye Struggling within your brest for liberty: To which Celania, after she had made A short, though seeming pause, lookt up, and said: Grave Sir, since thus your Oratorious skill, Hath made me yeild to your inviting will; I shall in short, though sadly, thus relate The grandure of my miserable state, By which relation, I shall boldly thrust (With an assurance that you will be just) My life into your hands: May, Heaven, reply'd (The Pilgrim) strike me dumb, when I divide Your secrets from my heart; I will forbear To tell them to my self, for fear the air, Being infected with an envious spight, Should bring your secrets to untimely light; Therefore with confidence proceed to show, And tell the reason of your lavish woe; At which Celania (all her joys being fled) Contemning life, because her life was dead, (I mean her Amoronzo) did express Her self as follows Know (grave Sir) this dress You see me in, is but a sad disguise To change my person, not my miseries: I had a Father, whose indulgent care, And carefull indulgency did not spare For cost to educate me to the best Advantage of the times: I made request Upon a time unto him, that I might (Being of years sufficient) take delight In what I had acquir'd, and forthwith show My self at Court; Ah there began my woe! But to proceed, My Father to fulfill The wilfull humour of my eager will Perpending not the danger might arise (Parents affections often wanting eyes) From my request, did forthwith give consent For my departure, So away I went, Where being come, I forthwith did apply My self unto the choicest company; My Birth and Fortune was at last declar'd Unto the Court, then every one prepar'd To do me homage; for indeed, the Court (That grand Idolater) did soon report, And Idolize my worth, which made me look Above my self, I presently forsook That glorious thing call'd Virtue, and became (Having lost the honour of a virtuous Name) A perfect Courtier, and I soon forgot How to be good, because I us'd it not; And to speak truth, the Court will scarce allow, Or give acceptance to a modest brow; They that come there, must forthwith dis-ingage Themselves of virtue, learn to court the rage Of every humour; Courtiers, all men know, Like Butter-flyes, are only good in show; Yet I'le not blame them all, because I've seen Bees amongst flyes, The Lawrel will be green In spight of frost, yet every one supposes A Wilderness yeilds Nettles more then Roses, And they that live a perfect Courtiers life As I have done, change true content, for strife; Virtue at Court is like a blazing Star Gaz'd at for wonder—But I run too far In this discourse, I therefore will return Unto my self (who although green) did burn In flames of Love, not doubting but to find A sweet refreshment for my tortur'd mind; But all in vain, for my distracted brest (Being subject unto every thing, but rest) Was so tormented, that I was enforc'd To vent my thoughts, And thus in short discourst With my own thoughts: Cindana, why dost thou (For that's my name) thus play the fool, and bow To every passion? tell me, canst thou show A reason for thy love? dost thou not know Extreams are dangerous; Ah cruel he That flatter'd me into this miserie; Ah Theophrastus! how hast thou betrayd— But here the current of her speech was stayd By an approaching Lady, who desir'd Some secrecy; the Pilgrim soon retyr'd, And gave them opportunity; but he Began to muse, and wonder what would be The sequel of her Story, whilst indeed She was, her self, unwilling to proceed; So being glad of this advantage, took Her leave, and so immediately forsook The Garden, telling him withal, that she (Having begun t' unfold her miserie Unto his ears) would take another day, To perfect what she then begun to say, Away she went. The Pilgrims heart affords Nothing but wonder; her promiscuous words Torment his soul, because he could not find (Although he labour'd with a serious mind) The aim of her discourse; he therefore broke His silence into language, and thus spoke Unto himself: What, are my senses grown So dull, so stupid, that they cannot own So much as common reason? sure my brain Is very empty, or her words are vain; The time has been when I could understand Cloudy Enigma's, when I could command The knottiest intricacies to appear Before my apprehension, plain, and clear; But to be baffl'd by a womans wit Is more then peevish nature can forget; Yet I must needs confess, and say I lye Under a most ingenious tyranny; But why was I so curious, as to know, And hear the reason of her stubborn woe? What have I gain'd, but wonder, doubt, &amp; trouble? Inquisitive hearts are still tormented double; Her story was so clouded, that the eye Of my dull sense, cannot at all discry, Or guess the sequel: First she said, her life Was wrapt up in each word, which made a strife Within my thoughts, for fear that they should be Born into words, and make discoverie Of her disigns; well, may she never rest Till I have heard, and she has spoke the rest; And so farewell vain thoughts, my serious mind Must aim at higher things, farewel, unkind And cruel Virgin; I will now retire Into my self, and never more enquire After thy endless story, for indeed I fear that thou wer't fearful to proceed, Or, at the least, asham'd; The Court, I know Receives the good, but seldom keeps them so; But stay, my thoughts, me thinks I did espye Something within the circuit of her eye That I have seen before; Me thinks her face Is radiated with a glorious grace; But being mask'd with sorrow, she lies hid From my remembrance, and I am forbid To make enquiry, therefore I'le surcease My present thoughts, and shrowd my self in peace; And thus we'le leave them both, and now return Unto Dimagoras, who begins to burn, And flame with anger, every word they spoke Batter'd his conscience, and had almost broke His treacherous heart; The Ladies, did indeed At that time all endeavour to exceed Their usual passions, every one did throw A dagger at him, and would oft bestow, The name of Villain on him: Thus his ear (Although unwilling) was enforc'd to hear Himself revil'd, but yet he durst not show His rage in words, for fear that they should know, Or at the least, mistrust, that it was he, That was the Authour of that villanie, And they, as being willing still to add To his beleif, would often wish they had The Traytor there, that they might jointly take Revenge in part, for wrong'd Parthenias sake. Dimagoras being tyr'd, does now prepare For his return, but scarcely could forbear To shew his anger; Yet at last, he took His solime leave, return'd his thanks, forsook Kalanders house, being not a little proud To think that he had pass'd so great a crowd Of difficulties; He does now begin To think what an unpardonable sin He had committed, in respect he staid So long from his Lutosa, who had made A battery in his soul: But here 'tis best To take th' advantage of a breathing rest; Therefore (My Muse) retire, we must not play Too much at first, but begg another day From our more serious thoughts; till then, desire The Reader to excuse thee, and retire.
