      <field name="fulltext">POEMS UPON SOME OF the holy raptures of DAVID. TO THE RIGHT WORSHIPFULL SIR THO. METHAM MY HONOURED FRIEND, and his vertuous Lady, the Lady METHAM. Sir, Madam, Pardon; it is a dutie that enflames And makes me gild my paper with your names. Nor (honour'd Pair) can't a dishonour seem To grace into the world a holy theam. I will not build a paper wall betwixt You and your Lady: your two souls are mixt In essence; vain then to divide this pair, When spirits most indivisible are. Yet I will act the Chymist; they have art Which can unmingle essences, and part. I'le take you two asunder with a pen, Yet so as that I'le mingle you agen. Sir, you have been a Courtier long: the Court Did almost snow upon your head, not hurt Your candid soul; and, which I most admire, You have the art, the vertue to retire; And not, as some, who like a meteor blaze Of exhal'd complements: no, no, your dayes You happily divide in equall sort, Sharing to th'Countrey half, half to the Court. Let on your thoughts my meditations wait, Which now triumph they'r born to such a fate. Nor, Madam, are you by my pen forgot: Yet to your beauties ink were but a blot. What? shall I passe like lightning by? we say Objects of worth do court a longer stay. Let me survey, admire, commend: You are The true Pandora, you the wise, the faire, The eloquent Pandora. Would you know That Lady? ask the gods, they did bestow Themselves on her: Venus did, as they feigne, Dwell in her features, Pallas in her brain, And nimble Mercury lodg'd in her tongue: Apollo in her voice breath'd when she sung. Then may my Muse, to adde unto your state, Like a poore virgin in your chamber wait. I've drawn some lines betwixt you; but now deigne That I may tie and twist you up again. The traverse of my verse remov'd (blest Paire) Meet and unite like to divided aire. Your humble servant John Saltmarsh. Meditation I. By the rivers of Babylon there we sat down, yea we wept, Psal. 137. Sad posture! sat and wept: yet from your eyes Runne teares: oh how your fountains gently vies With rivers, teares with waves, as if these drops Meant to outrunne thine, Babylon! No stops In this sad Musick? how these mourners seem, As though they wept division with thy stream! Why weep ye o're these banks? should we suppose These rivers ow their current to your woes? Or of your joyes were ye so long forsook, Ye came to drown your sorrows in this brook? Oh how these loving rivers would be one And mingle waves with thine, O Babylon! What wofull speed they make! none can define Which are their waters, Babylon, which thine. Yet Babylons proud current glides away, While your sad teares do court her waves to stay: Ye beg some pitie, and she murm'ring flies; And talking to her banks, neglects your eyes. The rich are rivers, and your teares present The passion of the poore and their complaint: They weep like these set here; the rich go by Like rivers swift, and pitie not their cry. Meditat. II. We hanged our harps upon the willows, Psal. 137. When sorrows do salute, joyes take farewel: These pair of guests never together dwell: They inne at severall signes; Sorrow she lies At the sad Count'nace, Joy at Flaming eyes, And sanguine face blithe looks: their empires are Divided: Sorrows kingdome is not farre From Babylons sad rivers, and there grows A grove of shadie willows; under flows A pitchie current; on the gloomie trees Do hang these harps of pleasure. Oh who sees This embleme, views a melancholy scene: Thus sits Contrition on a shady green Nigh to these streams and willows, while her lute (As though it were sad penance to be mute) Hangs by her for a time hid amongst leaves, Whil'st she forgetfull of her musick grieves. Thus sinfull souls lay by a while their joyes, And sorrow seems to hide these pleasing toyes: When they have sigh't some minutes, then again They take their harps to tune their wonted strain. Meditat. III. I have eaten ashes like bread, and mingled my drink with weeping, Psal. 102. Here is a feast whose sprucest cates are ash, Whose purple Nectar's teares: come all and wash And cool your scalding thirsts: ye that do burn With sinfull fevers, never taught to mourn, Here's cold repentant liquour, drink apace; 'Twill make you freeze to sinne and flame to grace. Man to these Ashes for a guest I'le woo: Vain man's a guest that's Dust and Ashes too. Shall I call Princes? no; their palates are Fatten'd with richer dainties: oh this fare Of Ashes is too homely, and their vests Are purple: oh these are too gallant guests. Who comes, must be like to poore sinners drest. Sad sackcloth unto ashes suits the best. Shall I call Ladies to this dish of Dust, These mortifying dainties? no; they must Be soft'ned with more cost; they will not eat Such morsells of mortalitie; their meat Are chymicall Elixers to refine Their flesh to immortalitie; they dine Not with such meals of sorrow; David may For them table the worms: fit guests, they say. Hearing of teares in drink, each beautie cries They carrie not their cellars in their eyes. Let David drink alone, they will not sip, Nor with his liquour stain a rosie lip: They say they never wept, unlesse a teare Dropt from them in a laughter: never feare Of sinne cost them so rich a pearl: they ne're Repent, unlesse they do bestow some deare Toy on a changeling Iover. Beauties up, And broach your tender eyes into your cup. Thus David did his sinnes with teares condole, Drank healths, not to his bodie, but his soul. That I may know I'm mortall, I'le afford My self some ashes ever at my board: And that I may quench my sad thirsting soul, I'le ever shed some teares into my bowl. Meditat. IV. My dayes are like a shadow that declineth, Psal. 102. My dayes? and why my dayes? good David hold; Thou art too prodigall, thou might'st have told Me of my houres and minutes: 'las thy chime Is slow, and cannot lackey with swift time. And why my dayes? 'Tis true, my dewie Morn Is Infancie, the time when I was born: My Noon is Youth; perhaps I then am bright And wanton as the brisk meridian light: The Even is my Age; then I decline: And when the sunne hastens beneath the line Of my Horizon, then I set, and say, Ah thus poore mortall close I up my day. My day? and why my day? Call it my night; For here we dwell in darknesse, not in light. The sunne's a starre, and sheds a feeble ray: If, Lord, we do compare it to thy day, We sit in shade: mortalitie serves thus But as a vail drawn betwixt thee and us. My dayes? why not my day? oh it is rare If we can live so long to make a paire. My dayes are like a shadow, ill exprest: Ev'n I am but a shadow at the best. Hold me a thousand crystalls, you shall see So many thousand shadows shed from me: Which makes me think my substance to be small, That I am shadows most, ev'n shadows all. My dayes are like a shadow; they and I, Both, like a pair of shadows, live and die. Meditat. V. Wilt thou shew wonders on the dead? Psal. 88. Man dies, his soul and bodie part, that spark Of fire divine flies up, while in a dark Close urn the ashie part is left behinde Both cold and pale. Peep in anon, you'l finde The tenement that lodg'd it to decay, Ambitious, mingling dust with finer clay. Oh when this bodie's fall'n, each arterie Unlac't, each nerve and sinew carelesly Shiver'd, and every vein rent, let me know, If thou canst build again good God; for lo The fabrick's ruin'd, and the timber's lost: Each ivorie pillar of unvalued cost, That so upheld this edifice of man, With all the contignation's fall'n: who can Spie where th'are scatter'd? yet my God, who first Built them, can gather them, though thus disperst. There's not an atome of thee but shall be Officious to unite: my God is he That marries and divorces, he that can In pieces take this curious frame of man, And recompose't: then soul and body both, Part; ye shall meet again: why are ye loth? Meditat. VI. The Emblemes of the resurrection. In beds of earth our latest rest we take, Like fading roses, that intend to wake After a winters nap; our bodies lie Wither'd to all but to a Christian eye. We are Gods tapers, this dark world's his night: Death his extinguisher puts out our light: Our bodies fall like snuffe; yet will he deigne At his great fire to light us up again. We see the Eastern bird, whose ashy nest Is a rare embleme of our latest rest: We see the flying serpent shift his slough To frolick in a fresher: 'tis enough. We see the sunnes bright empire leaves us all Shut up in shade, in darknesse: then we fall To slumber, yet but till the rising day; Then chides he slumber with an early ray. All our farewells we celebrate with friends, Though sad, yet ever in this cadence ends, Farewell untill we meet again: So may The soul departing to the body say. Meditat. VII. THE RESURRECTION. Shall the dead rise and praise thee? Psal. 88. What pow'rfull trumpet's that which at the last Shall breathe so many souls forth at a blast, Send such a pack of spirits home that have Been absent, left their lodgings in their grave? Say that the winde be wanton with thy dust, And playes with it; return, return it must, And mingle with rich liquour that doth wait, And so to flesh again coagulate. Into what quarter of the heav'n thy breath Be blown and scatter'd by unruly death, It shall return, return though it depart, And gently fanne again thy flaming heart. With whatsoe're pale brook thy blushing floud Did mix complexions, yet thy bloud's thy bloud, And shall return swift from those watrie tanks, Turn crimson current in thy azure banks. Thy nat'rall warmth returns which made thee brisk And blossome, now though't in a meteor frisk, Or dance a round with th'elementall fire, Following the nimble soul, but reacht no higher. Thus thou shalt rise as quick'ned with a charm, Or with that sprightfull Architect in sperm, Which first did mould thee into man; and then This dust (O Lord) shall praise the new-turn'd men. Meditat. VIII. Create in me a clean heart, Psal. 51. O God I thought (but now no limitation) Six dayes had been the age of thy creation: But still thou dost create: good David say, Where's that old heart of thine? for there I may Survey the picture of an aged sinne: The shadow of an apple blots that skinne. How is thy heart so black? fond I, I thought That sinne had been welfavour'd, but all's nought. It seems the beauty then pleasure dawb'd on, Was but some cerust false complexion. But why create a whole one? is no part Good, out of which thy God can make a heart, But must create of nothing? Lord redeem, Create no more in me, but with thy stream That runnes so freely from thee, bloudy scene, Wash this foul heart of mine and make it clean. Meditat. IX. He healeth the broken hearted, and bindeth up their wounds, Psal. 146. My heart, O Lord, is broke (nor is't a fiction) In pieces (Lord) and parcels in my breast, Slit with thy pow'rfull thunder of affliction: O heal it, Lord; till then I take no rest. Ah, like poore tradesmen with full shops of wares, Who cannot pay for all that they have took: So is my heart a shop of many cares; And I not able to discharge, I broke. Binde up my wounds, O Lord: oh thou couldst finde The linen thou shook'st from thee in thy grave; And with those clothes, Lord, thou mayst gently binde And spread me plaisters too: both which I crave. Yet while thou bind'st my wounds up, oh I see Thine fresh &amp; bleeding, yawning more then mine. Lord let thy wounds lie open still to me: To heal my wounds, I'le lay them close to thine Meditat. X. The Lord is nigh to all those that call upon him, Psal. 145. Nigh Lord, &amp; yet divorc't with such bright walls Of starres and planets and transparent balls? 'Las when I view the aerie distance, I, As though my pray'rs were too shortwinded, sigh: My pray'rs scarce feather'd with devotion flie, And like faint arrows in my bosome die. Shew me a nearer path my pray'rs may tread: This journey I despair on: they half dead Languish; O let some plumes (in thy great love) To make my pray'r some wings fall from thy Dove. O shoot me down a sheet of lightning; so I'le wrap my pray'r in that and let it go: Or reach me down a ray, and I will tie My thoughts in that bright string and let them flie: No need of this, Lord; thou art nigh, dost dwell About, within, in body, soul: O well For me faint sinner! dost thou thus with me, Dull, grosse, ev'n mix thy purer entitie? I live and move in thee; and Lord so neare Thou border'st on my essence, thou art here. In thee I have my being: when I crie, Do not remove O Lord, but be still nigh. Meditat. XI. The Lord looseth the prisoners, Psal. 156. My soul's the pris'ner, Lord, and it doth lie Shackl'd with fetters of mortalitie: The prison is my self; in walls I rest Dawbed with flesh; bones stead of barres: at best I'm such a wretch: yet I have leave to see Through this dark cell, nature hath glaz'd for me, A pair of windows, thorough which I look, And often cast my eyes upon that book By which I must be sav'd. Lord, without doubt I could soon break the prison doore, and out: But I'm afraid that my escape may draw Upon my soul a sad eternall law. Thou keep'st the keys my God; and thou; I hope, Wilt either with the key of sicknesse ope, Or of some other fate: yet let thy keys Gingle and make a noise to warn me, these Prepare: shake palsies, then the pris'n, as when The earthquakes which unfetter'd Peter; then I shall lesse fear. Thus all shut in a room Imprison'd live, waiting the dreadfull doom. A Meditation upon the Song of Songs, or, A request to Solomon. Say blessed Poet, with what sacred fire Blazes thy soul? this flight of thine is higher Then ever fancie yet upon vain wings Could fanne to. Say, what Chore of muses sings Notes to thy soul? sure of more blessed sort Then e're yet humane fancie flew to court. Say, where is thy Parnassus? we suppose Sion is thine: now tell me too, where flows Thy Aganippe, whose diviner streams Have made thee drunk with holinesse, till theams Drop down yet most sublime? or in what carres Rid thy triumphing fancie gilt with starres? Thou ne're writst these unlesse thy head were even During these raptures all the time in heaven. Or did some Angels croud into thy brain, And sublimate thy fancie to a strain? O no: if these bright Hierarchies had been Poets, and every flaming Cherubin Had took a pen to write this amorous song, Oh they had done the Deitie a wrong. When to these flames my fainter flames I trust, I see thee ravisht with a holy lust: There is a Cupid more divine I finde Then that same wanton wandring boy that's blinde; I see there's arrows too, but yet I spie That they are pointed with more sanctitie: There is a Venus too, but not like this; One whom the Trinitie will court and kisse: There's Hymens tapers too, though not the same; These lighten with a farre more holy flame. Blest Poet to the Deitie, I'le ask One question, and I pray thou would'st unmask; How is my Saviour such a lover turn'd? Is he grown wanton, amorous, that mourn'd? Is he recover'd of his wounds, and fit To court and woo a beauty? can he sit And use such blessed dalliance? he all wet In sorrow, through whose cranies sprung a sweat The quintessence of grief? O can he still Cap. 5. vers. 5. From his fingers dropt myrrhe.Myrrhe from his limbeck hand, or dip his quill In such a sonnet, which was steept (O glory!) In his own bloud to write a crimson storie? He hath no gay apparel, he's not brave; You know he left his garments in the grave. No gallant troup waits him; 'las none you finde But creeples, poore apostles, and the blinde. He hath no feasts to frolick, no repast: Forc't fourtie dayes, long Lent, he was to fast. Can his complexion suit a Ladies room Who hath but lately peept out of his tombe? Whose hair &amp; breath's still powderd with the dust, Perfumed with a grave, can he breathe lust, Lust holy like himself? O can his lip Drop wine, which he in vineger did dip? Say, can he love this beautie, call her dear, Who for an arrow's wounded with a spear? Can he glide Cant. 2.9. like a Roe, so brisk, so light, Upon whose feet hung such an iron weight? Cant. 6.2.Will he to th'garden usher her, (O blisse!) And there was first betrayed with a kisse? Cant. 6.3.Can he trip through the lilies as he goes, And thus with wounds crimson'd into a rose? O yes, he's now, now in a glorious plight; Now his hypostasis sheds stronger light, To be ador'd, admir'd: see Lady, see; You never saw lover so bright as he. Myriads of sp'rits, of naked souls a rout Whose old bare liverie bodies are worn out, Now clad in richer excellence, do wait About this sacred lover. O rare state! Who would not be thy spouse? O let me be But a poore page O Lord to wait on thee. FINIS.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">TO THE RIGHT WORSHIPFULL George Butler Esquire, one of his Majesties Councell established in the North. Let others with their pencils and their skill Paint you fresh objects of delight; my quill Sheds no such various colours: I present Your eyes with an old Picture that was lent Man at his first creation. Pray Sir ope This Paper cabinet that dwells in hope Of honour from your eye. I dare commend This Picture, God first limm'd: I onely send It wrapt in verse: enough had I to do To be the Poet, not the Painter too. Yours in all dutie and service John Saltmarsh. THE PICTURE OF GOD IN MAN, OR, THE IMAGE OF GOD IN MAN before the fall. Chap. I. Why called the Picture. As in a tablet where an Artists quill Hath learn'dly travell'd to unload his skill, Till to more constant being he hath brought Which had but flitting essence in his thought; Then to court admiration sets it forth Till that some ruder pencill spoil the worth, Till time with shadows darken it; and then Draws cobweb curtains over it; some men That finde this piece of art, and would enquire Into this curious relique, will desire To wipe off dustie yeares or strive to draw Times envious traverse by, untill they saw If any beautie were alive that might Speak for the rest to their ambitious sight: Thus fares't with man: for on the walls of clay God did his exc'lent divine feature lay, Yea hung it in this room of flesh: but sinne That fair unvalu'd picture did begin Soon to deface and blemish; we scarce spie Any complexion of divinitie. Yet we are busie wiping man decaid: Some part looks fresh, the Picture is betraid. Chap. II. God in the [illeg.] he drew upon man, excells the following art of men in presenting themselves. Gods tablet was a Soul; in that he drew, None but the intellectuall eye could view: Mans is a bodie: then this difference spie; God paints to th'intellect, weak man to th'eye. God did no other colours use but white; And that was innocence, temper'd with bright Rayes of his Deitie: man mixes black: Mans colours do some of Gods colour lack. God did his picture without shadow make; His pencill shed no darknesse: man doth take Most glory to shade well: then God is said To excell man as substance doth a shade. God's good, and like himself did he limme man: Man's sinfull, and limme like himself he can: So in comparing is this difference had; God's the good Painter, sinfull man the bad. Thus pictur'd God his beauty on the soul: Mans body to this Venus was the mole. The Riddles. My pen mounting on wing, one did appeare, And whisper'd me these Riddles in my eare; Mortall, saith he, I see what thou wouldst have: Search for a dead mans spirit in his grave: Go forth in shade of darkest night, and say Thy bus'nesse is to look about for day: Walk in December to heare linnets sing, To pluck the youthfull posie of a spring: Look in thy Ladies mirrour for her face, While she is flitting to some other place: Follow the nimble dove, and pointing say Where she did wing't through the diaphane way: Go trace the fishes path, tell where they have Stept on the fluid surface of a wave: Go up and shew me where the lightning stood After the first bright kisse upon a cloud: Shew me the leaves of stone th'Almighties pen First writ on in the flaming mount; and then Measure the path to Euphrates sad banks: Ask for the garden at those weeping tanks; Then for the tree and the unluckie bough Where the first sin hung and was pluckt: And now Gaze up to see the starre the heav'ns did hatch To light the Eastern wisdome to the cratch: Do these, I shall beleeve there's one that can Shew me the Picture of a God in man. Chap. III. A representation of God in man. I see the Sunne when he admiring stood His face in the smooth mirrour of a cloud: I lookt upon the cloud, and I did say, There shines a Sunne, but with a watrish ray. Then did I think mans clearer soul it was To the Almighties count'nance as a glasse; On which he looking, glimmering graces sent, Till the soul faintly did his God present. To make a compleat mirrour, there is laid Pellucide clearnesse on an opake shade: So body terminated soul; and why? To do the service of opacitie. Chap. IV. The Image of God in man. God had an Image before man was known Or quick'nd out of dust, that wore his own Feature of Deitie, one whom he bred Out of his own Divinitie, and shed From his indivisible essence, who Was coindivisible with him too, Who shar'd with him his autousie, and was His most indistant Image, more then as The Sonne of man: he did communicate Himself all infinite to him; his date Was from eternitie, who after knit Another essence to his own: from it Resulted that hypostasis. Man's made According to his image. Who can wade With pen to the first image, and betray The true representation? let me stay, And waken'd from a rapture cry, A blisse Too infinite, too finite I for this. Yet we have shadows: thus a Schoolman paints, Though his weak pencill on his paper faints. Gods Image, as the kings, is in his Sonne, Who's of his own specifick essence, one With him a sharer of himself: but man Is like his coin, upon whose face he can Stamp his own character: they differ much; In form and essence it presents none such. Chap. V. Gods Picture not in the bodie of man. Think not the structure of a man that part Which God did fashion with a meaner art: For to the soul he did assemble all The Senate of Divinitie, did call A meeting of his Inf'nite self. Who can Fancie that this same earthy part of man Was like a God? God hath his eares, his eyes; His back parts Moses saw them and descries. Is there a soul yet so concrete with sense, So stupid with a bodies influence? To think these so, man onely doth expresse Thus, 'cause he knows no spirits nakednesse, Sees not their operation; so he gives To them a conjunct state in which he lives. When one the picture of an Angel brings, A naked youth fann'd with two golden wings, I know these plumes are emblemes of his speed, Whose motion's instantanie: yet we need Expresse it thus by wings, because we know Most motions to the volatile are slow. Farre be from God a corporall essence: he Is too incircumscriptible to be Figur'd: no other Archetype we finde But that eternall figure of his minde. Chap. VI. Gods Picture in the soul, and what it is. The image is the Soul, a spirit made Fit to present a Deitie, who's said To be a spirit too. Oh could the eye That intellectuall ray reflect, and spie The exc'lence of it self, and in that state Wherein it first took being, fortunate, Had it been longer liv'd! Oh what a day Of graces brighten'd it! it body'd lay Like a rich gemme shut in a crystall case, Through whose transparent walls broke every grace. The intellect saw God, and could advance To heav'n at pleasure in a blessed trance: Which like a holy torch did scatter light To guide the will, who else would sit in night As blinde as dark: each facultie obey'd And did them service: nimble senses strayd Never abroad to court their objects so As to forget their God; they did all know Him wheresoe're they travell'd: Deity Gave them white liveries of integritie To wait on him: none labour'd to betray Their Lady to a sinfull or dark way. Mans eyes mov'd to good objects: you would think That God did some intelligences link To manage their swift motion: at his eares Enter'd no harmonie, unlesse the sphears Whisper'd their musick or some better note, An Hallelujah from an Angels throat: His breath, his words were like refined aire, As holy as the incense of a prayer. This was mans holier state; here ye might see Gods Picture in this rare conformitie To him; each active member seem'd to move Nimble to grace, trembling with fear and love; As though God breathing upon Adams face, Had blown in every arterie a grace. But oh how is this picture ruin'd! where Lives there so much of God, one may say, Here Was he presented once? yet we have juice That from a sacred side dropt; we make use Of this so rich a colour to redeem Gods thus decay'd complexion, till it seem As fresh as at the first. Oh may I see Such a fair Picture so reviv'd in me! FINIS. A meditation upon Eternitie. Methought I had a Clepsydra so wide, It held the ocean in his proudest tide: I still'd by teares, by drops, this watrie main; Yet I was glad to fill my glasse again. Then all the sands, all atomes of the aire I did imprison in a glasse: with care I let the dusty minutes single passe To the last atome; yet I turn'd the glasse. Methought I had a clock hung at a starre: My fancie spun the lines, the plummets were Ty'd too, which reacht the centre that low stop; Yet these runne down: again I wound them up. Then when I saw Eternitie outgo My clock, my glasse scorn'd to be measur'd so; I spy'd an Angel hover, and did crie To him, What's this you style Eternitie? He spoke thus in his momentanie stay, Go pluck from time his winged Yesterday And his To morrow. Then I askt him, How Call you it? So he answer'd me, A now. Then shew'd a Ãternitatis emblema apud Ãgyptios. circle uniform and round, And pointed to a chair set on the ground. I weary with enquiries, thought me blest, Sat in this embleme of eternall rest. Upon the rest on the Lords day. The world's Gods Lute; his creatures are the strings; Gods finger gives them motion; Angels sings Their Hallelujahs to it; on week dayes God to his glorious self a lesson playes: For from this Universe so strung, doth flie A rare, an universall harmonie. This is Gods weekly musick: yet too long Tension, he knows, may do his strings some wrong. A rest to this great Lute he'l not denie, So doth relax each string, then layes it by. We all are strings, and fastned to Gods Lute, Who to this generall musick contribute: God slacks us from our duties, sees we lack Some rest; else such weak trebles would soon crack. FINIS.</field>
