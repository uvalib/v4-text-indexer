      <field name="fulltext">To E. A. S. ROMANTIC BALLADS THE WEIRD OF MICHAEL SCOTT. NOTE. (Michael the Scot: fl. circa 1250.) Variants of the Michael Scott legends still exist in parts of the Scottish Southlands: betwixt Tweed and Forth, mainly in the remote districts of the shires of Selkirk, Peebles, and Roxburgh, and north of the Forth here and there along the Fife coast. The most common is that which relates to the magician's power of changing into an animal anyone who crossed him; and it is upon this that Part I. of the following ballad turns. That also is current which relates how Michael the Scot could win the soul from the body of any woman whom he loved. There are several versions of this uncanny kind of wooing: sometimes Michael Scott is said to have seduced the spirit from its tranced tenement, only to find himself eluded after all; sometimes the maiden, unable to resist his spell, comes to him, but over the battlements, and so is killed; again, just as she is about to yield she calls on Christ, and only a phantasmal image of her goes forth, though in the struggle her mortal body perishes (it was upon this version that Rossetti intended to write a poem; his prose outline of it is given in his Collected Works); or, yet again, she comes at her wizard-lover's signal, but when he would embrace her a cross of fire intervenes, and, to save himself from sudden hell-flames which arise, he has perforce to bid her return in safety. I have in Part II. treated Michael Scott's allurement of Margaret's soul not wholly accordantly with any legendary account, yet in superficial conformity with that which most appealed to my imagination. Part III. is in treatment entirely imaginary, although, of course, the germinal ideaâthat of encountering at the point of death one's own soulâis both old and widespread. The DoppelgÃ¤nger idea is a most impressive one in its crudest guise, and I have endeavoured to heighten its imaginative effect by making Michael Scott pronounce unwittingly a dreadful doom upon his own soul. Part I. The wild wind moaned: fast waned the light: Dense cloud-wrack gloomed the front of night: The moorland cries were cries of pain: Green, red, or broad and glaring white The lightnings flashed athwart the main. The sound and fury of the waves, Upon the rocks, among the caves, Boomed inland from the thunderous strand: Mayhap the dead heard in their graves The tumult fill the hollow land. With savage pebbly rush and roar The billows swept the echoing shore In clouds of spume and swirling spray: The wild wings of the tempest bore The salt rheum to the Haunted Brae. Upon the Haunted Brae (where none Would linger in the noontide sun) Michael the Wizard rode apace: Wildly he rode where all men shun, With madness gleaming on his face. Loud, loud he laugh'd whene'er he saw The lightnings split on Lammer-Law, âBlood, bride, and bier the auld rune saith Hell's wind tae me ae nicht sall blaw, The nicht I ride unto my death!â Across the Haunted Brae he fled, And mock'd and jeer'd the shuddering dead; Wan white the horse that he bestrode, The fire-flaughts stricken as it sped Flashed thro' the black mirk of the road. And ever as his race he ran, A shade pursued the fleeing man, A white and ghastly shade it was; âLike saut sea-spray across wet san' Or wind abune the moonlit grass!â Like saut sea-spray it follows me, Or wind o'er grassâso fast's I flee: In vain I shout, and laugh, and callâ The thing betwixt me and the sea God kens it is my ain lost saul!â Down, down the Haunted Brae, and past The verge of precipices vast And eyries where the eagles screech; By great pines swaying in the blast, Through woods of moaning larch and beech; On, on by moorland glen and stream, Past lonely lochs where ospreys scream, Past marsh-lands where no sound is heard, The rider and his white horse gleam, And, aye behind, that dreadful third. Wild and more wild the wild wind blew, But Michael Scott the rein ne'er drew: Loud and more loud his laughter shrill, His wild and mocking laughter, grew, In dreadful cries 'twixt hill and hill. At last the great high road he gained, And now with whip and voice he strained To swifter flight the gleaming mare; Afar ahead the fierce sleet rained Upon the ruin'd House of Stair. Then Michael Scott laughed long and loud âWhan shone the mune ahint yon cloud I kent the Towers that saw my birthâ Lang, lang, sall wait my cauld grey shroud, Lang cauld and weet my bed o' earth!â But as by Stair he rode full speed His horse began to pant and bleed: âWin hame, win hame, my bonnie mare, Win hame if thou would'st rest and feed, Win hame, we're nigh the House of Stair!â But with a shrill heart-bursten yell The white horse stumbled, plunged, and fell, And loud a summoning voice arose, âIs't White-Horse Death that rides frae Hell, Or Michael Scott that hereby goes?â âAh, Lord of Stair, I ken ye weel! Avaunt, or I your saul sall steal, An' send ye howling through the wood A wild man-wolfâaye, ye maun reel An' cry upon your Holy Rood!â Swift swept the sword within the shade, Swift was the flash the blue steel made, Swift was the downward stroke and rashâ But, as though levin-struck, the blade Fell splintered earthward with a crash. With frantic eyes Lord Stair out-peered Where Michael Scott laughed loud and jeered:â âForth fare ye now, ye've gat lang room! Ah, by my saul thou'lt dree thy weird! Begone, were-wolf, till the day o' doom! A shrill scream pierced the lonely place; A dreadful change came o'er the face; The head, with bristled hair, swung low; Michael the Wizard turned and fled And laughed a mocking laugh of woe. And through the wood there stole and crept, And through the wood there raced and leapt, A thing in semblance of a man; An awful look its wild eyes kept As howling through the night it ran. Part II. Athwart the wan bleak moonlit waste, With staring eyes, in frantic haste, With thin locks back-blown by the wind, A grey gaunt haggard figure raced And moaned the thing that sped behind. It followed him, afar or near: In wrath he curs'd; he shrieked in fear; But ever more it followed him: Eftsoons he'd stop, and turn, and peer To front the following phantom grim. Naught would he see; in vain would list For wing-like sound or feet that hissed Like wind-blown snow upon the ice; The grey thing vanished like a mist, Or like the smoke of sacrifice: âCome forth frae out the mirk,â his cry, âFor I maun live or I maun die, But na, na mair I'll suffer baith!â Then, with a shriek, would onward fly And, swift behind, his following wraith. Michael the Wizard sped across The peat and bracken o' the moss: He heard the muir-wind rise and fall, And laughed to see the birk-boughs toss An' the stealthy shadows leap or crawl. When white St. Monan's Water streamed For leagues athwart the muir, and gleamed With phosphorescent marish-fires, With wild and sudden joy he screamed, For scarce a mile was Kevan-Byresâ Sweet Kevan-Byres, dear Kevan-Byres, That oft of old was thronged with squires And joyous damsels blithe and gay: Alas, alas for Kevan-Byres That now is cold and grey. There in her bed on linen sheet With white soft limbs and love dreams sweet Fair Margaret o' the Byres would be: (Ah, when he'd lain and kissed her feet Had she not laughed in mockery!) Aye she had laughed, for what reck'd she O' a' the powers of Wizardie! âWin up, win up, guid Michael Scott, For ye sall ne'er win boon o' me, By plea, or sword, or spell, God wot!â Aye, these the words that she had said: These were the words that as he fled Michael the Wizard muttered o'erâ âMy Margaret, bow your bonnie head, For ye sall never flout me more!â Swiftly he raced, with gleaming eyes, And wild, strange, sobbing, panting cries, Dire, dire, and fell his frantic mood; Until he gained St. Monan's Rise Whereon the House of Kevan stood. There looked he long and fixed his gaze Upon a room where in past days His very soul had pled love's boon: Lit was it now with the wan rays Flick-flickering from the cloud-girt moon. âCome forth, May Margaret, come, my heart! For thou and I nae mair sall partâ Come forth, I bid, though Christ himsel' My bitter love should strive to thwart, For I have a' the powers o' hell!â What was the white wan thing that came And lean'd from out the window-frame, And waved wild arms against the sky? What was the hollow echoing name, What was the thin despairing cry? Adown the long and dusky stair, And through the courtyard bleak and bare, And past the gate, and out upon The whistling, moaning, midnight airâ What is't that Michael Scott has won! Across the moat it seems to flee, It speeds across the windy lea, And through the ruin'd abbey-arch; Now like a mist all waveringly It stands beneath a lonely larch. âCome Margaret, my Margaret, Ye see my vows I ne'er forget: Come win wi' me across the wasteâ Lang lang I've wandered cauld and wet, An' now thy sweet warm lips would taste!â But as a whirling drift of snow, Or flying foam the sea-winds blow, Or smoke swept thin before a gale It flew across the wasteâand oh 'Twas Margaret's voice in that long wail! Swift as the hound upon the deer, Swift as the stag when nigh the mere, Michael the Wizard followed fastâ What though May Margaret fled in fear, She should be his, be his, at last!â O'er broom and whin and bracken high, Where the peat bog lay gloomily, Where sullenly the bittern boomed And startled curlews swept the sky, Until St. Monan's Water loomed! âThe cauld wet water sall na be The bride-bed for my love and meâ For now upon St. Monan's shore May Margaret her love sall gie To him she mocked and jeered of yore!â Was that a heron in its flight? Was that a mere-mist wan and white? What thing from lonely kirkyard grave? Forlorn it trails athwart the night With arms that writhe and wring and wave! Deep down within the mere it sank, Among the slimy reeds and rank, And all the leagues-long loch was bareâ One vast, grey, moonlit, lifeless blank Beneath a silent waste of air. âO God, O God! her soul it is! Christ's saved her frae my blasting kiss! Her soul frae out her body drawn, The body I maun have for bliss! O body dead and spirit gaun!â Hours long o'er Monan's wave he stared; The fire-flaughts flashed and gleamed and glared, The death-lights o' the lonely place: And aye, dead still, he watch'd, till flared The sunrise on his haggard face. Full well he knew that with its fires Loud was the tumult 'mong the squires, And fierce the bitter pain of all Where stark and stiff in Kevan-Byres May Margaret lay beneath her pall. Then once he laughed, and twice, and thrice, Though deep within his hollow eyes Dull-gleamed a light of fell despair. Around, Earth grew a Paradise In the sweet golden morning air. Slowly he rose at last, and swift One gaunt and frantic arm did lift And curs'd God in his heav'n o'erhead: Then, like a lonely cloud adrift, Far from St. Monan's wave he fled. Part III. All day the curlew wailed and screamed, All day the cushat crooned and dreamed, All day the sweet muir-wind blew free: Beyond the grassy knowes far gleamed The splendour of the singing sea. Above the myriad gorse and broom And miles of golden kingcup-bloom The larks and yellowhammers sang: Where the scaur cast an hour-long gloom The lintie's liquid notes out-rang. Oft as he wandered to and froâ As idly as the foam-bells flow Hither and thither on the deepâ Michael the Wizard's face would grow From death to life, and he would weepâ Weep, weep wild tears of bitter pain For what might never be again: Yet even as he wept his face Would gleam with mockery insane And with fierce laughter on he'd race. At times he watched the white clouds sail Across the wastes of azure pale; Or oft would haunt some moorland pool Fringed round with thyme and fragrant gale And canna-tufts of snow-white wool. Long in its depths would Michael stare, As though some secret thing lay there: Mayhap the moving water made A gloom where crouched a Kelpie fair With death-eyes gleaming through the shade. Then on with weary listless feet He fared afar, until the sweet Cool sound of mountain brooks drew nigh, And loud he heard the strayed lambs bleat And the white ewes responsive cry. High up among the hills full clear He heard the belling of the deer Amid the corries where they browsed, And, where the peaks rose gaunt and sheer, Fierce swirling echoes eagle-roused. He watched the kestrel wheel and sweep, He watched the dun fox glide and creep, He heard the whaup's long-echoing call, Watched in the stream the brown trout leap And the grilse spring the waterfall. Along the slopes the grouse-cock whirred; The grey-blue heron scarcely stirred Amid the mossed grey tarn-side stones: The burns gurg-gurgled through the yird Their sweet clear bubbling undertones. Above the tarn the dragon-fly Shot like a flashing arrow by; And in a moving shifting haze The gnat-clouds sank or soared on high And danced their wild aÃ«rial maze. As the day waned he heard afar The hawking fern-owl's dissonant jar Disturb the silence of the hill: The gloaming came: star after star He watched the skiey spaces fill. But as the darkness grew and made Forest and mountain one vast shade, Michael the Wizard moaned in dreadâ A long white moonbeam like a blade Swept after him where'er he fled. Swiftly he leapt o'er rock and root, Swift o'er the fern his flying foot, But swifter still the white moonbeam: Wild was the grey-owl's dismal hoot, But wilder still his maniac scream. Once in his flight he paused to hear A hollow shriek that echoed near:â The louder were his dreadful cries, The louder rang adown the sheer Gaunt cliffs the echoing replies. As though a hunted wolf, he raced To the lone woods across the waste Steep granite slopes of Crammond-Lowâ The haunted forest where none faced The terror that no man might know. Betwixt the mountains and the sea Dark leagues of pine stood solemnly, Voiceful with grim and hollow song, Save when each tempest-stricken tree A savage tumult would prolong. Beneath the dark funereal plumes, Slow waving to and froâdeath-blooms Within the void dim wood of deathâ Oft shuddering at the fearful glooms Sped Michael Scott with failing breath. Once, as he passed a dreary place, Between two trees he saw a faceâ A white face staring at his own: A weird strange cry he gave for grace, And heard an echoing moan. âWhate'er you be, O thing that hides Among the treesâO thing that bides In yonder moving mass o' shade Come forth tae me!ââwan Michael glides Swift, as he speaks, athrough the glade: âWhate'er you be, I fear ye nought! Michael the Wizard has na fought Wi' men and demons year by year To shirk ae thing he has na sought Or blanch wi' any mortal fear!â But not a sound thrilled thro' the airâ Not even a she-fox in her lair Or brooding bird made any stirâ All was as still and blank and bare As is a vaulted sepulchre. Then awe, and fear, and wild dismay O'ercame mad Michael, ashy grey, With eyes as of one newly dead: âIf wi' my sword I canna slay, Thou'lt dree my weird when it is said!â âWhate'er you be, man, beast, or sprite, I wind ye round wi' a sheet o' lightâ Aye, round and round your burning frame I cast by spell o' wizard might A fierce undying sheet of flame!â Swift as he spoke a thing sprang out, A man-like thing, all hemmed about With blazing blasting burning fire! The wind swoop'd wi' a demon-shout And whirled the red flame higher and higher! And as, appalled, wan Michael stood The flying flaughts swift fired the wood; And even as he shook and stared The gaunt pines turned the hue of blood And all the waving branches flared. Then with wild leaps the accursÃ¨d thing Drew nigh and nigher: with a spring Michael escaped its fiery clasp, Although he felt the fierce flame sting And all the horror of its grasp. Swift as an arrow far he fled, But swifter still the flames o'erhead Rushed o'er the waving sea of pines, And hollow noises crashed and sped Like splitting blasts in ruin'd mines. A burning leagueâleagues, leagues of fire Arose behind, and ever higher The flying semi-circle came: And aye beyond this dreadful pyre There leapt a man-like thing in flame. With awful scream doom'd Michael saw The flying furnace reach Black-Law? âBlood, bride, and bier, the auld rune saith Hell's wind tae me ae nicht sall blaw, The nicht I ride unto my death!â âThe blood of Stair is round me now: My bride can laugh to scorn my vow: My bier, my bier, ah sall it be Wi' a crown o' fire around my brow Or deep within the cauld saut sea!â Like lightning, over Black-Law's slope Michael fled swift with sudden hope: What though the forest roared behindâ He yet might gain the cliff and grope For where the sheep-paths twist and wind. The air was like a furnace-blast And all the dome of heaven one vast Expanse of flame and fiery wings: To the cliff's edge, ere all be past, With shriek on shriek lost Michael springs. But none can hear his bitter call, None, none can see him sway and fallâ Yea, one there is that shrills his name! âO God, it is my ain lost saul That I hae girt wi' deathless flame!â With waving arms and dreadful cries He cowers beneath those glaring eyesâ But all in vainâin vainâin vain! His own soul clasps him as its prize And scorches death upon his brain. Body and soul together swing Adown the night until they fling The hissing sea-spray far and wide: At morn the fresh sea-wind will bring A black corpse tossing on the tide. THE SON OF ALLAN. Allan, son of Allan, Chief of the Colquhouns, had wooed and won Adair, daughter of Malcolm McDiarmid; but on the day the nuptials were to have taken place she was carried off in willing flight by MacDonald of the Isles. Allan pursued with twenty of Lord Malcolm's men, but arrived on the lonely Argyll sea-board only an hour too late, MacDonald having just sailed in triumph to his western isles. Allan for a time lost his reason, but in the autumn again regained his former vigour, and it was shortly after this time, in the first month of the New Year, that a message came at last from MacDonald offering to privily meet the man he had wronged, and fight out their quarrel alone. The ballad opens on the eve of this duel. Allan, nigh upon the appointed meeting-place on a lonely hill-side, waits the fixt hour at the hut of one known as the Witch of Dunmore. She foresees the fatal result of the duel to her clansman as well as to his foe, and strives to dissuade him from the combatârecalling her past experiences to him and mentioning signs and portents, hoping thus to convince him of the truth of her vision. âThe wind soughs weird through the moaning pines, The icy moon through the fierce frost shines, The steel-blue stars are baleful signs, Son of Allan!â âThe wind may blow to its last faint breath, Ere I turn aside from the shadow of death!â âMy dreams come true: thou knowest my laugh Hath blown the ripe grain into chaffâ Son of Allan!â âYour curse may come and your curse may goâ My soul must dree some other woe!â âWhen New Year came with gusty moan I lay forgot, accurst, aloneâ But I saw the scroll of your life as my own, Son of Allan!â âGod knows if Hell or Heaven's my life, To-night is hoarse with the sound of strife!â âAnd I saw you ride one sweet May morn, When the missel-thrush sang on the flowering thornâ O better if you had ne'er been born, Son of Allan!â âI would that God had strangled my soulâ But living, to-night I seek one goal!â âAnd I saw you ride by the brown-stoned burn, And your horse's hooves the flag-flowers spurnâ O turn now, if ever you turn, Son of Allan!â âThe fierce tides ebb from the ruthless shore, But I turn not now till one thing's o'er!â âAnd I saw you leave the speckled stream Where the moor-hen clucks and the plovers scream, And ride with your eyes in a far-off dream, Son of Allan!â âLong weeks ago I dreamt, and now The awakening nears my fever'd brow!â âAnd I saw you leave the woods apace And seek Dunallan's grassy ways, With a golden glory on your face, Son of Allan!â âA thousand years ago I sought My love's cruel death, and knew it not!â âAnd I saw you choose a ready stall, And leave your horse by the castle wall, And loudly for the henchman call, Son of Allan!â âNo more on men or maids I callâ I or he this night shall fall!â âAnd I saw you leap the deer-skinned stair, And I saw you kiss the golden hair And the sweet red lips of Lady Adair, Son of Allan!â âI kissed her lipsâeach kiss a coal That burns and flames within my soul!â âAnd I heard you say, âMy love, my dear, How speed the maids with the bridal gear?â And then you whispered in her ear, Son of Allan!â âI whispered thenâbut one shall know No whispers soon when he lies low!â âAnd I saw them fill the one great room, Where the sword-scarred pennons waved in gloom, With a golden dish for every plume, Son of Allan!â âWhite plumes may flaunt, white plumes may wave! White swords shall this night carve a grave!â âAnd I saw the wine-cups filled brim-high, And joy shine bright in your bonnie blue eye As âLady Adairâ was your toasting cry, Son of Allan!â âI hear no more the wine-cups clash,â I hear the gurgling red blood splash!â âAnd I heard Lord Malcolm call out loud For his daughter fair,âand I saw a bowed Old henchman quake 'mid the servile crowd, Son of Allan!â âLet traitors sweat with sudden fright! God's wrath disturbs the world to-night!â âBut as sleet rings fierce on a wind-beat grange, His words fell swift, and stinging, and strange,â Lord Malcolm's smile had an awful change, Son of Allan!â âGod's smile was lost in a deep dark frownâ But one of twain shall this night fall down!â âAnd I saw thy face wax flushed, then pale, And thy lips grow blue like black-ice hail, With eyes on fire with the soul's fierce bale, Son of Allan!â âPale, pale I was with my soul's dread,â But one this night shall lie full red!â âAnd I heard Lord Malcolm cry âTo horse! MacDonald has swooped with the falcon's force, But we'll catch them both ere they end their course, Son of Allan!ââ âThe hawk may swoop, and the dove may fly, But the hawk for the dove this night shall die!â âAnd I saw thee haste, and mount, and away With twenty men by thy side that day, And thy face was like the gloaming grey, Son of Allan!â âLong, long ago the sun shone bright,â But since that day black mirk o' night!â âAnd I saw thee ride through the brief chill dark, Till dawn awakened each sinless lark, And the hills re-echoed the sheep-dog's bark, Son of Allan!â âAh! long ago sweet morns were fair,â Now blood seems dropping every where!â âTill the horses tramped in the blazing noon, And the cuckoo called farewell to June, And the blackbird sang a blithe glad tune, Son of Allan!â âAh! once I knew that sweet bird's sangâ I hear naught now but steel's harsh clang! âAnd, Son of Allan, ere swart night fell, I heard Lord Malcolm's savage yell, And saw thy face in the shadow of hell, Son of Allan!â âHope died upon that cursÃ«d strandâ But to-night we meet, each sword in hand!â âFor the horses plashed on the wave-washed shore, And MacDonald had sailed an hour before: Thy bride to his isles the chieftain bore, Son of Allan!â âMy bride! my bride! no bride have Iâ But a bridegroom this night shall fall and die!â âAnd I saw thee fall like one struck dead; And they made for thee a pine-branch bedâ And thus-wise with thee home they sped, Son of Allan!â âO would to God I had met him where He kissed and fondled his Lady Adair!â âAnd I saw the fever burn and flame Like fire through all thy tortured frame, And ever shrill'dst thou one fair name, Son of Allan!â âOf false, false heart of Lady Adair, Whose corpse behold you cold and bare?â âNot till the autumn's purple days Did thine eyes lose their empty gazeâ Then Reason came in one sharp blaze, Son of Allan!â âO madness comes and madness goes, But the slain corpse no madness knows!â âThen word was brought MacDonald sentâ He bade you rest no more content With dreams of anguish impotent, Son of Allan!â âNo dreams I dream! one thing I know, This night a soul to hell doth go!â âAnd now beneath the New Year moon He rides to grant your final boonâ And neither shall see Spring wed to June, Son of Allan!â âSweet Junes may bloom, and Junes may blow, But a soul this night shall taste of woe!â âHe grasps the hilt of his waist-band knife, And he smiles as he thinks of his laughing wife, And his blood leaps hard as a steed's for strife, Son of Allan!â âAye! loud she may laugh, and loud may he, But his eyes shall gladden no more at the sea!â âMy dreams come true: upon my bed Last night I dreamt I saw o'erhead A darkness fold thee, and leave thee dead, Son of Allan!â âThe mirk you saw is light to what Will gather when he and I have fought!â âStop, stop!â (the Witch of Dunmore calls) âI see in vision the man who falls: A cloud of blood my sight appals, Son of Allan!â âI wait no more for thy blind wordsâ No words this night but gleaming swords!â âThe wind soughs weird through the moaning pines, The icy moon through the fierce frost shines, The steel-blue stars are baleful signs, Son of Allan!â âThe wind may blow to its last faint breathâ Cross swords, cross swords, for life or death!â âBack bloody swords! Forbear, forbear! Lord Allan see, thy wraith is thereâ The stars gleam through its shadow-hair, O son of Allan!â O dripping sword, spring, lunge, and sweep! O thirsting sword, drink deep, drink deep!â MAD MADGE O' CREE. Hither and thither, to and fro, She wander'd o'er the bleak hill-sides; She watch'd the wild Sound toss and flow, And the water-kelpies lead the tides. She heard the wind upon the hill Or wailing wild across the muir, And answered it with laughter shrill And mocked its eldritch lure. Within the running stream she heard A music such as none may hear; The voice of every beast and bird Had meaning for her ear. âWhat seek ye thus, fair Margery? Ye know your Ranald's dead: Win hame, my bonnie lass, wi' me, Win hame to hearth and bed!â âHark! hear ye not the corbie callâ It shrills, Come owre the glen, For Ranald standeth fair and tall Amid his shadow-men!â ââHis shadow-men,â O Margery! 'Tis of the dead ye speak: Syne they are in the saut deep sea What gars ye phantoms seek?â âHark, hear ye not the curlew wail May Margery, mak haste, For Ranald wanders sad and pale About the lonely waste.â âO Margery, what is't ye say: Your Ranald's dead and drowned. Neither by night, neither by day, Sall your fair love be found.â âHe is not dead, for I hae seen His bonnie gowden hair: Within his arms I've claspit been, An' I have dreamit there: âLast night I stood by green Craigmore And watch'd the foaming tide: And there across the moonlit shore A shadow sought my side. âBut when he kissed me soft and sweet, And faintly ca'd tae me, I rose an' took his hand an' fleet We sought the Caves o' Cree. âAh, there we kissed, my love and I: An' there sad songs he sang O' how dead men drift wearily 'Mid sea-wrack lank and lang. âAnd once my wan love whisper'd low How 'mid the sea-weeds deep As but yestreen he drifted slow He saw me lying asleepâ âAye sound in sleep beneath the wave Wi' shells an' sea-things there, An' as the tide swept o'er my grave It stirred like weed my hair: âIn vain, ah, all in vain, he tried To reach an' clasp my hand, To lay his body by my side Upon that shell-strewn strand. âBut ah, within the Caves o' Cree He kissed my lips full fainâ Ay, by the hollow booming sea We'll meet, my love, again.â That night again fair Margery In Cree-Caves slept full sound, And by her side lay lovingly The wan wraith of the drowned. O what is yon toss-tossing there Where a' the white gulls fly: Is yon gold weed or golden hair The waves swirl merrily? O what is yon white shape that slips Among the lapsing seas: Pale, pale the rose-red of the lips Whereo'er the spindrift flees. What bears the tide unto the strand Where the drown'd seaman lies: A waving arm, a hollow hand, And face with death-dimmed eyes. The tide uplifts them, leaves them where Each first knew love beside the sea: Bound each to each with yellow hair Within the Caves o' Cree. THE DEITH-TIDE. âWi' a risin' win', An' a flowin' tide, There's a deith tae be; When the win gaes back An' the tide's at the slack, There's a spirit free.â âFragment of a Highland Folksong. The weet saut wind is blawing Upon the misty shore: And like a stormy snawing The deid go streaming o'er:â The wan drown'd deid sail wildly Frae out each drumly wave: It's O and O for the weary sea And O for a quiet grave. âWhose voice is that is calling Frae out the deid-wrack there, What saut tears these aye falling Upon my rain-weet hair? âWhat white thing blawing, blawing Before the moaning gale, The grey thing 'mid the snawing, The white thing 'mid the hail?â The wan drown'd deid sail wildly Frae oot each drumly wave: It's O and O for the weary sea And O for a quiet grave. âO wha be ye that's mournin' Down by the saut sea-shoreâ Mournin', mournin', mournin' Alang the saut sea-shore: âO weel I ken my dearie, My dear love lost lang-syne: O weep nae mair my dearie Your tears o' bitter brine: âThe weet saut win' is falling, An' hear ye not the tide, The deith-tide calling, calling? O come wi' me, my bride! âO come wi' me, my marrow, Ye'll sleep love's sleep at last, No in a cauld bed narrow But swirlin' on the blastâ âO come wi' me my ain ain Jeanâ What gars ye grow sae chill?â âO I fear your hollow burnin' een, An' your voice sae thin an' shrill!â âO come wi' me my marrow, Sae sweet sall be your sleep, No in a cauld bed narrow But in the swayin' deep.â The wan drown'd deid sail wildly Frae back the weary land: It's O and O for the saut deep sea Ayont the barren strand. âO weel my soul is flying Abune the faem wi' thee: My bodie white cauld cauld is lying Beside the gurly sea: âO gie tae me your shadowy han' An' swift your phantom-kiss, It's drear, sae drear, within the mirk Here where the white waves hiss!â The wan drown'd deid sail wildly Frae back the weary land; It's O and O for the saut deep sea Ayont the barren strand. Poems of Phantasy. Phantasy. Riding o'er a lonely plain I came unto a woodâ And there I met, in dreamful mood, A damsel singing a low strain, All ye who love me love in vain! Her song it seemÃ«d far away, But oh her kiss was sweet: She led me to some green retreat, And there within her arms I lay The livelong day. All ye who love me love in vainâ I kissed her wistful face But found a leaf-strewn space Alone, and far I heard her strain, All ye who love me love in vain! I seek the wood in twilit hoursâ At times I hear her sing; At times her white arms round me cling: She leads me into magic bow'rs And sings and wreathes me wilding flow'rs. Her eyes are tears, and pain Is in her kiss, but wildly gay She laughs, and fades away, And through the dim wood floats the strain, All ye who love me love in vain! The Willis-Dancers. The Willi or Willis-Dancers are the spirits of those who have died untimely, youths and maidens who on earth had no fulfilment of their desires. On certain nights they hold wild phantasmal revelry on earth. The moonlight floods the hollow dell:â The dell where all the city's dead Were laid, when oft the loud plague-bell Filled wayfarers with sudden dread: The accursÃ«d plague it was that swept The young from life, and spared the oldâ Who wept and lived, and lived and wept And mourned the silent sleepers in the dell's chill fold. The hollow dell is fill'd with light, The frosty radiance of the moon; Yet gleams there are, more weirdly brightâ And what is that slow swelling tune? It is not any wind that blows, For not a wafted leaf doth fall; What is the rustling sound that grows, As if a low wind stirred amid the poplars tall? Yon white, yon pale green hues that shineâ Are they but fungus-growths that beam: What moves by yon funereal pineâ What haunts the pool where marsh-fires gleam? From out the shadow-haunted trees, Along the nested hedgerows dumb, And o'er the moonlit sloping leas Singing a thin strange song the Willis-dancers come. In hurrying scores, with silent feet, In weird processional array They pass, with motions wild and fleet: And now they gain the common way. Adown the long white road they flit, Slow-singing their unechoing song, Till, where the Calvary, moonlit, Crowns the low hillâround whose white base the dancers throng. Fair, fair, unutterably fair, With wild and gleaming eyes they pray O for the breath of mortal air, O for the joys grown faint and gray! But never the carven god commands; The frozen eyes nor gleam nor glanceâ The Willis-folk ring phantom-hands, Then laugh and mock and whirl away in frantic dance. Wild, wild the dance, with blazing eyes, With flowing hair, and faun-like leaps, With thrilling shouts, and ecstasies. Now one withdraws, and wails, and weeps: Her grave-blanch'd hair around her thrown, Her white hands claspt, she doth not hear A voice that claims her for his own, Nor hearkens her dead Lover call in awful fear. For oft when from the grave they've fled To gain phantasmal joys on earthâ Fair youths and maids who ne'er were wed But died within their spring-time mirthâ A fearful thing hath happ'd to some: A joyous dancer hath withdrawn, Hath wailed and wept, and then grown dumb, And paled, and pass'd away ev'n as the stars at dawn. The wan soul, with its burning gaze From hollow eyes with anguish fill'd, Would fain the lapsing maiden raise: One moment all her being is thrilled With one wild passionate desireâ Then, as a flame that is blown out, Or as a mist in the sun's fire She fades into the silence round the whirling rout. Still wilder, swifter grows the fray: Youths who on earth had lived in vain, Maids who had yearned the livelong day For ease to love's imperious pain, All whose high hopes had come to nought, All who for life's delights had striven, All who had suffered, dreamt, or wrought To make of our common Earth a glowing Heavenâ All, all, with eager, frantic haste Swift dart and glide and dance and springâ As gnats above a stagnant waste Will interweave in a mazy ringâ With locks that once were living gold Tossed wildly in the moonlit air, With panting breasts that ne'er were cold In the dear vanish'd days ere death came unaware: Lovers who knew no joy of love In the old barren years of life, Together now enraptured moveâ Claspt each to each with rapture rife: Bosom to panting bosom pressed, Hot lips athirst on thirsting lips, Strange joys and languors doubly blestâ Snatch'd from the sombre grave, yea even from Death's eclipse! Swift, swifter grows the mystic dance More wild, more wild, each fierce embrace: The woe of death's inheritance Gleams ghastly on each wildered face; A wan grey light illumes the head Of the carv'd god to whom they prayed: A haltâa hushâamong the dead! A long-drawn sighâand lo, the Willis-dancers fade! A Dream. Last night thro' a haunted land I went, Upon whose margins Ocean leant Waveless and soundless save for sighs That with the twilight airs were blent. And passing, hearing never stir Of footfall, or the startled whirr Of birds, I said, âIn this land lies Sleep's home, the secret haunt of her.â And then I came upon a stone Whereon these words were writ alone, The soul who reads, its body dies Far hence that moment without moan. And then I knew that I was dead, And that the shadow overhead Was not the darkness of the skies But that from which my soul had fled. The Wandering Voice. They hear it in the sunless dale, It moans beside the stream, They hear it when the woodlands wail, And when the storm-winds scream. They hear it,âgoing from the fields Through twilight-shadows home,â It sighs across the silent wealds And far and wide doth roam. It moans upon the wind No more The House of Torquil stands It comes at dusk, and o'er and Haunts Torquil's lands. He rides down by the foaming linnâ But hark! what is it calls With faint far voice, so shrill and thin, The House of Torquil falls. He lifts the revel-cup at nightâ What makes him start and stare, What makes his face blanch deadly white, What makes him spring from where His comrades feast within the room, And through the darkness goâ What is that wailing cry of doom, That scream of woe! No more in sunless dells, or high On moorland ways is heard the moan Of the long-wandering prophecy:â In moonlit nights alone A shadowy shape is seen to stand Beside a ruin'd place: It waves a wildly threatening hand, It hath a dreadful face. The Twin-Soul. In the dead of the night a spirit came: Her moonwhite face and her eyes of flame Were known to me:âI called her nameâ The name that shall not be spoken at all Till Death hath this body of mine in thrall! And she laughed to see me lying there, Wrapped in the living-corpse bloody and fair, And my soul 'mid its thin films shining bareâ And I rose and followed her glance so sweet And passed from the house with noiseless feet. I know not myself what I knew, what I saw: I know that it filled me with trouble and awe, With pain that still at my heart doth gnaw: That she with her wild eyes witched my soul And whispered the name of the Unknown Goal. O wild was her laugh, and wild was my cry When with one long flash and a weary sigh I awoke as from sleep bewilderingly: Her voice, her eyes, they are with me still, O Spirit-Enchantress, O Demon Will! The Isle of Lost Dreams. There is an isle beyond our ken, Haunted by Dreams of weary men. Grey Hopes enshadow it with wings Weary with burdens of old things: There the insatiate water-springs Rise with the tears of all who weep: And deep within it, deep, oh deep The furtive voice of Sorrow sings. There evermore, Till Time be o'er, Sad, oh so sad, the Dreams of men Drift through the isle beyond our ken. The Death-Child. She sits beneath the elder-tree And sings her song so sweet, And dreams o'er the burn that darksomely Runs by her moonwhite feet. Her hair is dark as starless night, Her flower-crown'd face is pale, But O her eyes are lit with light Of dread ancestral bale. She sings an eerie song, so wild With immemorial duleâ Though young and fair Death's mortal child That sits by that dark pool. And oft she cries an eldritch scream When red with human blood The burn becomes a crimson stream, A wild, red, surging flood: Or shrinks, when some swift tide of tearsâ The weeping of the worldâ Dark eddying 'neath man's phantom-fears Is o'er the red stream hurl'd. For hours beneath the elder-tree She broods beside the stream; Her dark eyes filled with mystery, Her dark soul rapt in dream. The lapsing flow she heedeth not Though deepest depths she scans: Life is the shade that clouds her thought, As Death's the eclipse of man's. Time seems but as a bitter thing Remember'd from of yore: Yet ah (she thinks) her song she'll sing When Time's long reign is o'er. Erstwhiles she bends alow to hear What the swift water sings, The torrent running darkly clear With secrets of all things. And then she smiles a strange sad smile, And lets her harp lie long; The death-waves oft may rise the while, She greets them with no song. Few ever cross that dreary moor, Few see that flower-crown'd head; But whoso knows that wild song's lure Knoweth that he is dead.</field>
