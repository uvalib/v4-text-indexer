      <field name="fulltext">APOLOGY FOR POESY. Form what far regions of the Infinite Beyond the solar glow I have been sent from uncreated light, And why to this dim borderland of Night, My Lord, I do not know. But Thou art wise; and in my mortal sphere, Pent in this prison tower, Blown to me from my spirit-home I hear, Sounding, now faint and far, now near and clear, Harmonies every hour. The sun goes surging up the East in song; The moon in muffled strain Repeats the pæan, whispering it among The choral stars, that listen and prolong, And cease and sing again. Ocean all through his many-chambered seas, The seas through all their bays, Rivers and rills, forests with all their trees, Tempest, and thunder, and the wandering breeze, My God, proclaim Thy praise. —And oft when midnight buries vale and hill, Loosening its music free, My heart instinctive sings, as sea-shells will, Though inland carried far, faithfully still Echo their parent sea. These are of Thee—these broken harmonies, That wander from Thy lyre Like wind-blown blossoms of the Hesperides, Or spray sun-kissed to golden irises And twists of coloured fire. I hear and thrill;—not as the soulless cliff Deaf to the vocal sea, But answering to the joy like dancing skiff: —God of all Harmony! forgive me if I dare to answer Thee! ORELLANA A POEM BOOK I. Peru was fallen, and her king was dead; And from its tower, plucked down with ruthless hand, The golden image of the worshipped Sun No longer blazed o'er Cuzco. Far and wide The land was harried of its garnered wealth, Stripped of its ornaments of dowried gold, Its silver from the rock's reluctant grip Wrung with relentless hand; and what remained Was the slow promise of the laboured fields. But not to them, these fiery youth of Spain, The shepherd's even pulse, or the long hopes That wait on tillage and the swelling seed And fostering heat and rain: their veins were filled With lust of conquest, and the gleam of gold Was ever in each eye. Yet still they thronged The narrow belt between the aerial hills And the wide mystery of the Western seas; And, finding nothing left of native growth To fuel their ambitious wants, they turned With envious glances on each other's gain. Till the great Marquis, sitting at Quito, And ruling with an ill-acknowledged sway Subjects that hoped each one himself to rule, Spoke to Gonzalo: “Other realms there are Beyond these giant hills or o'er those waves, Haply in continent, at least in isle, The bearer of whose destiny be thou And these—take whom thou wilt—that cannot rest Until it be delivered. Oh, my brother! There comes not once again in after-time To thee or any man such glorious hope As beckons now: 'tis the last mystery Of the round globe hid in yon ocean waste, Or from yon snowy heights to be descried. Rise equal to thy fortune. Be it thine To finish what Columbus but began, And make the name, our common name, Pizarro, Wide as the water, lasting as the land! See what a sacrifice of fame I make! But thou or I, what matter? We are one; And while I strengthen yet my foothold here The freer thine for conquest.” While he spake, Down the steep flanks of the Sierra crept The tell-tale breezes, bearing in their wings Odours of cinnamon, and whispering low Of wealth unguarded in the vales beyond. The Spanish soldier, keeping nightly watch Before the general's tent with idle pace, Paused, and with upturned face inquiringly Sniffed the cool odorous air: sweeter to him Its soft caresses on his swarthy cheek Than memories of Xenil, or the gush Of Ebro's waters clear: nor kindlier less Its freshness folding round his sunburnt neck Than virgin's arm of snow. While thus he stood, Gonzalo, issuing from the tent, remarked His absent gaze upon the snowy ridge Which cut into the sky, shearing the stars, Past the low-floating moon. Familiarly Upon his shoulder with broad hand he smote, And to his look high thought attributing— “What say'st thou, comrade? Will it yield to Spain? Or is it sacred to the stars alone, A higher Alp than Hannibal would dare? Perchance there is a Hannibal at hand! Only be ready thou, my valiant soldier, Whom I elect my standard-bearer here —What is thy name?” Abrupt he stayed; and he, That other,—“Hernan Sanchez am I called.” “I know thee well: attend my trumpet-call To-morrow morning; I have need of thee”— And passed to his own tent, leaving the youth With the warm blush of pride upon his face, And a vague sense of praise. At earliest dawn Gonzalo's trumpet shrilling through the tents Awoke the warrior conquering in his dreams. Three hundred youths sprang joyful to the call. These overnight, ere e'er he had retired, And with his great idea burning clear In its unclouded dawn, Gonzalo drew, As flame draws flame, partakers of a faith To light on hidden empire, win for Spain Another Mexico, a new Peru! Each brought a heart strengthened by hardy use, And never yet contaminate with fear; A sword, and each could wield it; and a band Of dusky faces waiting on his nod, And catching from his frown the fearlessness Born of excessive or habitual fear. With arms caught up in haste, and warlike stores, And other needs resigned to Indian slaves Enlackeyed with the baggage, forth at dawn, With little words of parting,—forth they rode While yet the ensanguined sun, like some vast bird With flaming wings in a wide equipoise, Stooped on the mountains ere he soared aloft For a strong flight prepared: not otherwise The soul of each, with vigorous thoughts elate, Spurning the summits of attainèd hope, Looked to a loftier goal. Next day at noon Their ranks were startled with a voice behind As of a messenger who gallops hard, Ere yet too late, with some neglected trust. All turned; and lo! impelled by destiny, Breathless he comes, the inimitable thief Who stole the glory of the Amazon, And wrote across a continent his name As if on parchment with a running pen,— Who, like a meteor flashing down the night, That bursts full-blazed, and, blazing, is blown out, That upsprings unannounced of tremulous dawn, And sinks without a setting,—shot athwart The width of the New World, and disappeared Leaving the long lapse of the ocean stream To syllable his name to all its shores With repetitive murmur, Orellana! On the fifth day The sudden swoop of night descending prone Surprised them in a hollow where the land Sinks ere it reascends with daring slope To end with snowy purity in Heaven. Here, weary with their march of days, the task, Though self-imposed, in all its magnitude First seemed to tower with sudden increment Beyond the flight of Hope. For, as they lay Supine beside their camp-fires, and the moon, Looking sheer down upon them from the ridge With unexpected light, revealed the steeps Which rose to where she seemed to sit enthroned, And the vast bulk as of a natural wall Which God with His own hands had built, the thought Of their own littleness, as there they lay, A handful hid in a forgotten valley, While the great mountain towered and the broad sky Spread placid and serene, and the vague fear Of a presumptuous sin in such high presence O'ercame them, wearied, and they would have fled, But that they were ashamed even to speak The coward thoughts which each man deemed his own. But with the morn courage returned; and Hope That, revelling in the Elysian fields beyond, Forgetful of her office by the way, Had winged by night her backward flight unseen, Now settling on the summits overhead, Shone with severer ray, commandingly To the stern joys of danger ill to dare And labour yielding slow. Under its light (For hope too distant but fatigues the mind) They braced them for the first encountered toil, And were in wonder, past the point of shame, Whence the distrust and awe of yesternight,— Distrust of mind, the strongest power on earth, And awe of senseless matter, dull and dead, And would have laughed aloud in the clear air Of early morning as they scaled the side Of the huge innocent mountain, but the dread Of a recurrence of the perilous spell Moved them to sober thought and kept them mute. Three days the ascent continued—three long days— And on the fourth they came upon the snow; And still the mountain towered till lost to view In a dense whirl of cloud. Ah! then for thee, Poor Indian slave, struggling beneath thy load, With back low bent and shivering limbs thin clad, On the bleak wintry heights, what woes in store When wild and wide, with whirling wind and snow, And crash of loosened rocks the storm came down, And, clutching at thy heart with fingers cold, Blew the sharp ice of death into thine eyes, That never more should brighten at the glow Of summer beauty in thy native plains! Unseen the mute imploring look, unrecked If seen, with which the sinking Indian turned His human eyes, dim with the glaze of death, Upon his resolute lord, the Spaniard drew His mantle closer round him, set his teeth, And without word toiled steadily up the steep, Nor turned to right or left, nor paused, nor spoke Even when his comrade, swaying to the blast, Went headlong o'er the rocks, or disappeared Where, walking fearless to his doom, he stepped Upon a bridge of snow. For he would storm The stronghold of the storm, and plant his foot And flag victorious in the chiefest seat And citadel of the tempest! Yet at last When they had reached the summit the wind dropped, And the mist reeled and fled: the sun poured in, And shivering on the naked top, they saw Through the immaculate air the curving globe Bend to the far horizon's utmost verge From west to east unknown, a roomy width! But not beyond the grasp of human will To limit and explore: the mystery, The impenetrable mystery was gone Of magnitude: the big earth seemed to shrink To conquerable compass; and the fear That there was nothing further now to find, Nor continent to conquer after this, High-hovering o'er their minds, would have descended To circumscribe their hope, but that the view That eastward stretched beneath them filled their eyes, And shut out from their hearts the after-pain, Which yet, with furious mind swift to exhaust Immediate expectation, some even then In lust of conquest were anticipating! It was a scene of Earth the grandest: far As eye could pierce undimmed with utmost strain The landscape spread in virgin loveliness As if new-made, without the trace of man, And waiting in the hush of afternoon Expectant of possessors, a new race Of sinless being, to admire its beauty And live the life of happy worshippers Amid its groves, and gratefully content. Far other they that with fierce eyes looked down From the high natural wall that guarded in This later paradise: the wolvish joy That snatches to destroy lay in their heart Slumbering, while wonder gazed on tiptoe mute Where wide savannahs rolled like a green sea Of verdure decked with flowers, and forests waved Their wealth of branches on the lower hills, And in the lonely valleys brightly clear Wound with a noble freedom lordly streams, With here a wide expanse of silvery lake Green-islanded with palm of stately droop, And there the sheeny bend repeated oft Of some more distant river sliding slow To far-off waters. They forgat their toils, Forgat that they had ever lived till now. The past broke from them wholly, like a mantle It slipped from them with all its care and grief, Remembrance of inhospitable shores, Hardship on hill and billow, sickness, want, Thirst, the broad ocean, memories of home, Country, and kin, and love's and friendship's claims. They seemed new-wakened; and, the present pain Of pinching cold unfelt, their souls leapt down To taste existence in the under valleys. On the sharp rocks meanwhile the Indians lay Breathless with pallid lips moaning in pain Their secret miseries to Mother Earth That would not take them to the long embrace Of her pain-lulling arms, but let them cling Heedless of their complaints, the while she flung Her favours at the feet of aliens. Or if, though few, in shivering groups upheld By force of sympathy, not native might, Incuriously like timid sheep they turned Their dumb pathetic eyes from the new scenes That met their adverse gaze, arrived the top, Backwards to whence they came: it was their home, And this perchance the latest farewell look Of happiness and hope! Night caught them thus; These on the new-found land gazing with hope, And those with mind or eye despondingly Upon the old. And now along the ridge Glimmered the little camp-fires, scantily fed With sapless twigs in handfuls, wintry moss, And baggage-boxes, what they best could spare. To sleep was death: the Spaniard in his cloak Stalked out the weary hours from fire to fire Under the chilling shadow of the dark, Shadow of death to many! where they sat Frozen to statues, stretching pulseless arms To flames that but revealed the stony glare Of eyes untenanted, and gave no heat; Or ghastlier still when the cold beam of morn Played on the features of the seated dead Circling a heap of ashes! Down the long slope At break of day the straggling march began, And ere the last, an Indian with his load, Had left the night's encampment to the dead, The hovering condor dropped upon its prey. Snow fell in mantling flakes, but soon they dipped Into a warmer air: the grass grew green, And plants, just budding in the sheltered cleft, And clumps of trees in social brotherhood, And note of startled bird, and flash of plumes Awoke unwonted pleasure in their minds To see and hear at hand: in one day's march They stepped from January into June. And still 'twas January, the drear time When universal death to other lands Makes periodic visit to assert Usurped dominion o'er the realms of life Designed of old for governance of man, An ill-kept birthright: but in this fair land, A new-made world then first surveyed by eyes Tired with the faded glories of the old, Perpetual Spring and Summer hand in hand, Inseparable sisters, make their home Eternal in the valleys: wintry storms Menace but come not, nor the bounteous year Ends in a harvestry of withered leaves, But leaf to leaf without a pause succeeds Shooting off death, and bud to blossom grows, And on the bough, whence falls the fruit mature, Straight peering through the tender bark you see The hastening buds gemming the immortal tree. Arrived the lower slopes they pitched their camp Under a lofty shade of forest boughs, And wasted a long afternoon in doubt Which way to turn, so wide the region lay, In its immensity fit to maintain The growth of ancient monarchies that might In solitude be sitting far apart And coexist, perchance in mutual peace As being each to other quite unknown. Ere early nightfall—for the western hills, A high horizon, met the sinking sun Before its full decline—their scouts returned And made report of natural gardens fair, And bird and beast that followed wildly tame But fled them when approached, as half in fear And half in wonder of the human form, But nowhere trace of man or other race Corporeal that betokened by their look Or handiwork the godlike power of mind. The gibbering of the ape rang through the woods And from the rocks and o'er the rushing streams; And on the lonely level river-shores Where cities should have sat, or temple towered On flowery hill, primeval quiet reigned: The land was tenantless. So on they rode with listless bridles ringing Idly, and silence fell upon their march. Through the clear air from boughs o'erarching high In sunny radiance fragile blossoms fair, The peaceful tribute of the unowned woods, Descended lightly on their warlike arms, As down the glade or by the forest's marge In a strange pomp the short procession wound. They moved as in a dream: the industrious bee Hummed heedless by on its own task intent As if they were not; on the distant glade The indifferent herd was feeding as they passed; The bird pursued its mate from tree to tree, Forgetful of their presence; they were shunned Or tolerated only in a land Sacred to peaceful thoughts and beauteous forms: The genius of the place viewed them askance, Withholding all communion: they were awed By the lone wealth and beauty of the land, And felt like men of too presumptuous mind Trespassing on the gardens of a god. They longed for difficulties, dangers, foes, Which yet they dreaded being yet unseen, Yet everywhere suspected: and as oft As to some flowery eminence they came That rose unforested, a specular mount, Commanding all the varied region round, It was the sudden movement in the brake Of panther half-revealed, or to the shore The alligator shooting from the stream, That sent the languor from their sated eyes, O'erwearied with the spectral loveliness And dulled by the excess of beauty,—if perchance The distant figure might betoken man, Savage or civilised, urging the chase Afoot, or in canoe threading the maze Of intertangling waters that unite Haply some hidden settlement or hut With the big bustle of a central town. Strange choice of men, if choice it may be called, Perverse that inappreciative turns Or with suspicious eye from the green nooks Of Eden that still gem the desolate earth To fix on barren sands and snowy wastes And rocks amid the sea: strange choice is theirs Self-exiled in the wild to force by art, And hardly force after long strife and pain, A pittance from inhospitable shores Among unlovely scenes, while nature wastes Her richest and her fairest on the brute. As lovely is the land, and still, alas! As lonely to this day, as when they passed, These mailèd strangers, like a threatening wing That hurries through the sunshine of a dream. Yet still the Briton to his barren rocks Clings with convulsive hand! It seems as if, Since the great nameless terror of the Flame That round the umbrageous gates of Eden swung Relentless to the expatriated pair, The memory of the fear, an instinct grown Transmitted with the blood, still drives the sons Of Adam to the Desert, and despoils With strange suspicions loveliness itself Of more than half its natural yield of joy. So through those beauteous realms, that seemed to them The hallowed gardens of an absent god, With fearful hearts they hastened. And ere long Strange fitful airs of most divine perfume, That come and go like wandered harmonies Loosed from an angel's lyre, salute their sense Inhaling Paradise;—the heralds these Of a new marvel from the hidden East. And lo! at last she comes, the fair Windqueen, Riding the billowy air most gracefully! The tall tree-tops in meek obeisance bow, The lower forest claps its hands of leaves, And the dim air is lightened with the flush And glow of scattered blossoms, pink and pale, Before her coming! She is come, is gone! And the sweet thought of cedarn palaces And bowers of cinnamon in far retreats Amid the woodland gloom fills all the mind, Dropped from her trailing garments as she passed, Till growing faint and faint the charm dies out, And to the hungering Spaniard leaves again The common airs of earth, and memories Eternal, though of momentary birth. Now with the heavenly balm intoxicate They turn their quest to whence the incense came, If haply they may find the odorous shades Of El Dorado: sudden hope is theirs Expectant of fruition every hour, But every hour the hope is lengthened out, And fond exertion slackens; droopingly They journey on as in a labyrinth Whose every winding leads them towards an end, Or leaves them more astray: forward they move, Yet more like wearied soldiers to their camp Listless returning after a defeat. The vacant air transmits no messages, Or, from perplexing quarters faintly blown, The musky-pinioned couriers of the sky, Viewless and vagrant, only mock their toil; For everywhere the land is as before, Beauteous but barren of immediate gain; And the long calm eventless monotone Of day succeeds to day with all the hues That at the first flashed in their joyous eyes Now faded, blanched, and colourless as glass On which the shivered lance of level light, Full aimed, no longer falls. “A soldier I,” At length impatiently the leader spoke: 'Twas midnight, and the restless Spaniards sat Like statues, speaking none, beneath the shade Of the mysterious wood, while overhead Pulsed the large constellations in the heat Of the high air most tranquilly: “A soldier I; And this strange peace and utter loneliness, They madden me: nor man nor town is here, Nor laurels worthy of a warrior's brow; And if the promised groves of cinnamon Be here, we know not—the winds only know! Nay! I will back—there's honour in Peru!” None moved nor answered, when a distant voice That seemed aerial from the listening wild Rose syllabled above the forest hum Articulated humanly, and thrice In a strange tongue but sweetly kind to hear. It startled all—save one, whom destiny With most secure indifference lapped in sleep, The unconscious owner of the Amazon, Biding his time. And first the Father spoke, Whose spirit, fired with Christian chivalry, Yearned for adventure in the pagan mind (And hither on that errand had he come): “It is the voice of God, spoken by bird I know not, but believe the omen true. Inviting was the sound—nay! let us on! Speak not of going back: trifles like this, If it were but the cry of startled bird, Are trifles only to the heedless ear; To those that note them they are proved the call Of Heaven to noble deeds: nay! let us on! It needs must be that somewhere in these wilds A remnant of the sundered race of man In pagan isolation dwells apart From the great brotherhood, with whom 'tis ours To link them in fraternal bonds of love; For not alone to us did God's dear Son Leave the rich legacy of promised Heaven; And they, the co-heirs with us of His grace, Wait the announcement privileged to us, Yea, and enjoined the ambassadors of God Of His most blessèd embassy to them. Lofty our mission and our warfare high, Above the mean ambitions of the flesh, With demons and the darkened mind: and if, Pray Heaven it be! a bloodless victory Won by the spiritual arm, let the spear rust, Let Spain be silent of our soundless deeds: We are the vassals of a higher lord Of more imperial sway than Charles of Spain!” They gave assent, cloaking their secret thoughts Of earthly riches, temporal renown, With a religious falsehood self-deceived; For soon the fair white robe they seemed to wear Of Christianity was splashed with blood, When, with the fruitless toil renewed in vain, Exasperate on an Indian tribe they fell After long search, and, failing in their hopes Of a sure guide, secured at length though late, To point their march to El Dorado, used Torture of steel and fire and hounded dog On the poor timid wretches to extort A knowledge from them which they did not know. What knew they of the dreams in other lands, Of fancy and unreasoning rumour bred, That pointed to their own disastrously, And met a naysay with vindictive rage And further search infatuate of belief? Dreams, idle dreams! that haunt the restless mind With recollection of the primal loss Of happiness and everlasting youth, Transferred of old to Heaven's securer clime. Dreams, idle dreams! worthy alone in this— They fire the sluggish mind to energy, Whence spring collateral deeds of lofty strain That, blindly wrought, in benefits endure When the false heat that moulded them is cold, And the unconscious worker, faint and foiled, Has perished in the flames himself had fanned. To kindly nursing in the native tents, Dumb with the sheer scverity of woe, Gonzalo left his sick, loath to be left, Not from a fear of vengeance, for their hopes Swallowed all fear: a godlike fearlessness, Responsible to none, was in their look, Which, weakened though they were and numbering few, Struck with paralysis the Indian mind: But that their eyes should miss the first far glimpse Of unknown empire rising with its towers Amid the woods and waters onward still, Whither their comrades with impatient steps Were certainly advancing. They, meanwhile, Pushed on through dreary flats of marshy land;— For the scene changed, and all was desolate: The forest thinned, and even shrubs were few; And, save the plashing of incessant rains Among the stagnant pools, and the wild cry Of passing bird lost in the misty air, With distant winds that round the horizon sobbed Like spirits imprisoned in a drear confine Searching for freedom, other sound was none; Nor did they seek to break the monotone With show of cheerful talk where cheer was none. And here amid the rainy solitude A gaunt companion joined them—Famine stalked With fleshless limbs and hollow-staring eyes Silent beside them, full of brooding thought, Or chewing bitter buds plucked from dank boughs, Or yellow roots that only bred disease, From the black soaking soil snatched greedily, Yet with blue feverish lips mouthed in disgust. Here sank amid these melancholy wastes, Like worthless weed, full many an ardent life Whose value had been left, a cherished hope, Endeared by many and many a conscious fear In some particular home, in some one heart, Hopelessly far in Spain! And here, perhaps, They all had perished in a nameless grave, As some have perished daring deeds as great, Of whom no record tells, and the stern hum Of the big drowsy world had sounded on Unbroken in regardless apathy, But that the forest with its foodful palms And medicinal stores opened once more Its wide asylum to the wasted band; And further on beside the Coca's banks The friendly shelter of an Indian town, Built underneath one patriarchal roof, Offered the accepted welcome of a home. Long time they tarried here—oh, rest was sweet! And the most ardent of them could have sold The dowried future, riches, power, renown, And a salvation from the common blank On History's glorious page, in glad exchange For the torn blanket and the garlic meal Of herdsman on the brownest hills in Spain. Sickness, fatigue, and fasting, and the sense Of utter homelessness so tamed their pride, And they so yearned for human sympathy, That all mean occupations, once despised, And all the trammels of society That gall the fiery spirit to endure, Seen in their artificiality, Seen from Brazilian woods afar in Spain, Were coveted, yea! realised in dreams; Which so subdued their thoughts to humble mood That frankly, when awake, they fraternised With the meek Indians marvelling much that men Visaged so sadly should have dared so far. But with returning health vigour returned, And the old restlessness stirred in their veins, And drove them forth a reunited band, Recruited and with fresh access of hope To penetrate the mystery of the wilds. The Coca's turbid stream, swollen with the rains, Seemed in their eyes a clew by which to thread The wilderness: it babbled in their ears Of distant empire in its lower course Whither its waters hastened: nay! it seemed By very force of sympathy like themselves, A pioneer peering for hidden lands: With what mad joy its current leapt along, Reeling and swaying like a drunk Bacchante, Startling the temple quiet of the woods And revelling through their holiest adytum! Not one of all the Spanish band but threw A portion of his soul into the stream And raced with it along: not one but chode The slow delay, the halts, the tedious turnings On the swift-rushing river's cumbered banks. How enviously they saw sweep on before The speeding fleck of froth, the brittle bell, Borne on the river's back triumphantly, Leaving them far behind! Eagerly now They would have hurried, having put their hand Upon the running clew-line of the stream That promised a safe passage through the dark Illimitable wild: nearer they seemed With each day's farther march to friends and home, For they had found a highway to the sea On whose salt waves no Spaniard could be lost. Yet, as they gazed upon the rolling flood And with its pace compared their daily march, Time seemed to stagnate; and their hopes were chilled With the cold fear, deep-seated in their hearts, That Fate had caught them in her iron clutch, Restraining them to a funereal march Timed to have ending in the desert, where A sacrificial altar was prepared On which their hopes should perish, and their lives. Unspoken were their fears; they even sought, As brave men will when Fate is at their neck, To conquer by obedience, to annul The despotism of dire necessity By uncomplaining patience, and the show Of liberty that wears as if in sport And with a jaunty air a weight of chains. So from the painful task they turned not back, Nor paused, nor 'plained, but, though with joy-less lips Flinging upon the air semblance of mirth In songs that told the glory of the Cid And ballads of the Moors, right steadfastly They kept their pensive faces all the while Fronting the great Unknown. The storms were up One evening when they pitched their wind-blown camp Under the rocking trees beside the stream. But as they slept o'erwearied with their toil The tempest sank, and in the sudden calm A muffled voice came booming up the stream, Deepening and broadening, a continuous roll As if of thunder breaking through the folds Of cloud and night that wrap it seven times round, Until the full-voiced terror drowned the ear And wrought such horror in the realm of dreams That some from ineffectual struggling woke Screaming; and others started to their feet Making the holy sign; and each looked wild And strangely on his neighbour, gathering in Slowly his personality of pain. Never before had European ears Been so bewildered by such awful noise. Was Hell broke loose? Or had the keystone slipped That binds the fabric of the bulging globe? Not even Ordas could conjecture make; Ordas! who dared the dark volcano's throat Courting the horrible, what time the flame Of Cortez' genius shot towards Mexico Like a clear-burning tongue of arrowy fire Scorching the dazzling halls of Montezume; Even Ordas felt a shrinking of the soul, The veteran Ordas! who in one dark night— The Night of Sorrows—faced a thousand deaths, Till the last trace of Fear's alloy was purged From his whole heart for ever. Day by day The awful sound with fascinating dread That drew them towards it, loud and louder swelled Till the wide air was one vast sea of sound, And from sequestered chambers of the soul Strange threatening echoes from their primal sleep Rose like a new creation, horrible! And scarcely was the terror reasoned down When from the high bank of a river cape They saw this vast immensity of waters, Drawn by the Coca from a thousand caves In the far-distant Andes, leap in mass Most fearfully into a gulf of air Two hundred fathoms down: the volumed foam, That without halt makes everlasting plunge, Whirled from its sphere of consciousness the soul And left the body, emptied of all feeling, Tranced in the dumb rigidity of awe. Nor was their wonder less when farther on The narrowing torrent with concentred strength Poured all its length into the channelled rock, And through the chasm that pent its thunders in, A dreadful depth, unsounded of the sun, Toiled in tumultuous agony: the rocks, Irrevocably sundered, scowling flung Defiance on each other front to front, And heedless of the Hell that howled below. On the sheer brink, grasping with knotted roots The stable rock, a giant cedar leaned Forward, who from the forest had advanced More dauntless than the rest: him Horror seized, Preventing all return: and on the verge, Bound in eternal spell, he gazed below. With ruthless axe assailed, his giant trunk Fell crashing o'er the chasm from bank to bank, The first beam of a bridge: beside him thrown Lay lighter palm-trees, in the forest felled: Gay flowering clusias bound the rolling logs; And o'er the airy walk the Spaniards marched, Horseman and foot, struggling and stumbling on, Till all had passed, safe—to a hostile shore. For here a shower of darts, blown from the woods Through the long gravatana, sing i' the air, And hiss and sting! Anon the ambuscade With hideous yell advance, a martial race Accustomed to aggression. But unknown To them the sudden flash, the rattling peal And fatal ravage of the Spanish arm. Unknown the graceful terror of the steed That speeds and fights and almost thinks for man. The astonished Indians fled, or grovelling lay As at the feet of centaurs suppliantly Conceding all—possessions, children, life. Under their conduct through a barren tract The Spaniards journeyed, joyful with the hope Of rumoured fortune in a distant realm. And after weary days corn-fields appeared, And cotton plantings, and the huts of men Domesticated to a settled life Arcadian, but with little store of gold. Here fretting much at their enforced delay By sickness, hunger, and the present rain— For now unceasing torrents night and day Poured from the inky sky, and from its bed The rising river wandered in gapó, Flooding the forest—deeming they had reached The edge of empire where the arts of man Wage desultory warfare with the wild, They sent forth pioneers to make survey For further action: these returning told Of broken forests, marshes, pools, and ponds, And squalid tribes inhabiting in trees, Who yet confirmed, in terror, or in fraud, The rumoured hints of empire, but remote. With mingled feelings of despair and hope, Impatient of suspense, Gonzalo's mind Resolved a final throw with Fate, which failing, Farewell the hope that lured him from Quito! The river was their only highway—smooth And swift its hurrying waters ran; it only Could solve the secret that consumed their soul. Thus musing in the doorway of his hut With folded arms, and eyes of brooding gloom Bent on the muddy flood that tumbled by Scourged by the slanting rains, the while his men Dozed out the weary moments—musing thus, Suddenly to his mind a Vision rose, A fair large vision of a River Ship That idly lay moored to a bank, with sails Full-spread and oars, the while the current raced That should have borne the naiad freely on. Starting, he looked again, and it was gone; And th' inscrutable waters whence it rose, Or seemed to rise, assumed their apathy: But not less real seemed the gurgling stream Than that aerial ship that sat the wave, A moment seen full imaged in the rain, Then without warning took mysterious flight! “Saint Jago be my speed,” Gonzalo cried, With spirit roused from her inactive mood, “And I will make this glorious fiction fact! Why was I blind to the fair dream till now? Did not the whispering waters hint of this? And I, dull schoolboy, understood them not! Heaven sent me this to fire my flagging zeal In mild reproach: Did not the lively mind Of Vasco Nuñez on the mountain ridge Provide a fleet for the yet distant sea? Dull dreamer that I am! did not the mules Of Cortez bear upon their sweltering backs, O'er many a mile, to launch them in the lakes Of Mexico, the keels of many a bark? And I, with a great river in my eyes Daily, and timber for a sea of ships In these vast forests where each branching trunk Sends seaward with the rushing winds and streams Its wishes to be free—I saw, I heard it not, And murmured at my own slow-paced delay! No more of this! No longer on the banks, Waiting for fortune, housed in idleness; But on the river—that way lies my path— To force her tardy coming!”—In his eyes The light of genius shone, and where they darted Among his listless followers, a new life Shot through their veins, and cheerfully remembering That they had set themselves the task of choice, Like boys at play they went about the work, Gonzalo guiding. In the sombrous woods Screened from the incessant rain and gusty winds That shook and pattered on the slim-built shed Their workshop in the wild, they built a forge; And soon the ruddy gleams, forth darting far Into the cavernous forest, sent their glow Upon the sinewy limbs and naked breasts Of willing workers bending at their toil Or passing to and fro: around the axe Here thick the splinters flew whitening the ground; There, as if wakening from its centuried trance And wakening but to look around and choose Ground for a resting-place, the stately tree, Swaying with all its boughs in the high air, Sank down majestic in its fall, as sinks Some galleon in mid-ocean in a calm With sails unfurled and all her bravery on. Some lop the prostrate branches; on the stocks Some stretch the keel, and prop the curving frame. There, half concealed in smoke, a cheerful band Of demons move, charring the flameless wood For future fuel: others from the pine, That stand like patient martyrs ringed with fire Bleeding from many a wound, collect the drops Of resin as they fall. One with a box Makes circuit of the camp, collecting tax Of ear-rings, finger-rings, crosses, and chains Of ornamental gold, given willingly, With armour-plates of silver framed in steel, And helmets thought superfluous. In the furnace These with the iron shoes wrenched from the feet Of mules and horses, dead or yet alive, Flung, in the blaze he stands with one arm stretched To stir the glowing coal; the other plies The groaning bellows. Like a Cyclops vast His shadow on a background of green leaves, Begrimed with smoke, yet glistening in the rain, Toils like a phantom in the noiseless shades To idle imitation damned. Anon The obsidian anvil rings: chief at the work With sleeves rolled up Gonzalo sweats and toils, Now at the forge, now swinging the wide axe, Or straining at a rope, knee touching knee Familiar with his fellows, bating nought; And men must follow when their captain bends The crest of his nobility to toil. So from their hands this Argo of the West Took shape, and grew, and to their houseless hopes Became a very fortress where they sang. To songs that breathe of ancient chivalry Opposed to Frank and Moor, in snatches sung, The unforced product of a hopeful heart Recalling the achievements of its race, And in that memory strong—the fair renown Bernardo heired from brave Orlando slain At Roncesvalles, or when Gonsalez set The first stone of Castile; of Vargas, too, Surnamed the Bruiser, and Ramiro old; But most of him Spain's matchless paladin The brave knight of Bivár:—to songs, that made These heroes live in them, the vessel rose, The structure of their hearts no less than hands, Endeared by mutual suffering cheerily borne, For in its sides their hearts were built, and not Alone their wealth in every driven nail, Their very clothing steeped in bubbling pitch Thrust in its seams, and hope of life and home. Lo! as they toiled the river-god arose Curious above his banks, and his great eyes Gleamed through the trees upon them at their toil; Then, as if found the object of his quest, The virgin vessel, with tumultuous rush He flung out his long arms, folding her round, And like a bridegroom took her to his breast. And now, their more immediate wishes met, The dull reaction came with idle hands Of labour wasted: what were one small bark Where scarcely forty would suffice to bear Their numerous band along? The greater part, With futile efforts every hour renewed, Hewed for themselves along the bosky banks Their woodland way, while in the brigantine A scanty complement of sickly men Waited, with oars backed in the hurrying rush Of the impetuous stream, the slow-paced march Of their o'erwearied comrades on the shore. So passed laborious weeks, till hunger-forced, And tempted by fresh rumours of a land Rich in all blessings—food, and towns, and gold, Far down the river where a mightier stream Engulfed the Coca, they made general halt Arguing the folly of the bridled ship, On the free element a captive log, Bound to the sluggish measures of the land. BOOK II. By this the happy season was returned When to the texture of his cloud-built tent Diaphanous the red-faced sun approached, Peering into the shrouded world below That languished in the rain: the curtains caught The glory of his burning countenance And went ablaze: this way and that they fled, And lo! the lofty firmament serene In a wide stretch of deep ethereal blue Enroofed the laughing globe. There hung the sun; And Nature stretched her praiseful arms aloft In distant hills and towering trees and waves And little humble flowers adoringly Towards the benignant Sun, that smiled again! Along the forest glades now might you see The wavering flight of indolent butterflies Whose blue metallic wings lit up the shades Like fluttering patches of the fallen sky. The yellow troupials whisked from bank to bank, And hung their pendent nests on the high boughs That swayed in graceful fringes down the sky. While ever and anon the frigate-bird With head thrown back came sailing down the air That streamed above the stream, and disappeared. Ah me! what wistful faces sad and wan And wasted with disease met the red gaze Of the returning sun! How with the heavens Their prisoned hopes enlarged, defying bounds, Yet chafing at the strange mysterious leash That pulled them to the wingless body back. Meanwhile as if from sudden ambush sprang A lurking fever on the pallid frame Of stout Gonzalo: from his restless couch He turned his hungry eyes upon the priest: —“O holy father, must I here abandon, Here within promised access of renown, The great hope of my days? And must I die, Thus circumstanced with new-awaking life In all around me? Water, earth, and air, The winds, the sunbeams, insect, bird, and river Rejoice unfettered: I am captive bound. Oh for the pinions of yon passing bird, That I at least might overfly the land, And, if but with a transient glimpse, drink in The wealth of my possessions! Hard it is To be the heir of what I cannot hold; Harder, indeed, if I have brought you all Into this sylvan solitude, apart From human ken, only to waste and die In unrecorded pain! And therefore I Would send at least, if that I may not go, To claim my heritage: call Orellana! I have marked him fit for noble deeds, Approved him bold, ay, somewhat over-bold, And think him true. What if the after-race Ignoring or in ignorance credit him With all the honour of the enterprise! I shall not mind it, though it cut me now Even to anticipate. Vain fear! 'tis mine; Nor have I less the greatness that I feel Wanting the confirmation of the crowd.” “A noble deed,” gravely the priest replied, “Done in obscurity or deepest night, Needs not the shouting of the multitude To make it fact,—yea! and if but conceived When other hands receive it at the birth, Stolen or adopted, none the less remains In highest truth the author's. A brave mind, Strong in the consciousness of native worth As hero in his mail, will estimate The praise of men as but a needless cloak Thrown over armour: And yet true it is The purple trappings and the nodding plume Become the warrior well;—but they are less His own delight than worn to pleasure friends. Think you the great Columbus, when the light First showed him where the long-lost hemisphere Lay sleeping in the void—think you he felt At that abandoned hour of soundless night Less sure of his own greatness, as he stood On the lone poop surrounded by the dark While Europe far behind in her grey walls Chaffered and gossiped through her daily rounds Forgetful of him quite, or mindful only As of a fond enthusiast pitiable— Than when, after long months of secret greatness, He told to courts his prophecy fulfilled, And Europe, pausing in her mill-horse round, Turned all her million eyes to the grey seas, The riddle of whose mystery was read, And hailed him Finder of a Second World? And yet, when all is said, be sure his mind Chose her seat well,—not on the unstable base Of airy speech of men, which a side wind Blowing sinister with capricious gust Can sweep as swift away as castled clouds Before an evening gale,—not on renown As men translate the word, an empty sound, Which themselves give and often give awry, And then withhold, and with as little cause; But on the steadfast rock, the immortal stance Of consciousness of a great duty done. In that one word all honest greatness hides, And each may grasp it in his several sphere, For that is duty that a man can do And that beseems a man—all else is vain.” He ended, but the germinating thought Grew in Gonzalo's mind. Upon the priest His large eyes gazed in silence till his mind, Slow to appropriate the strength-giving truth, Returned the dictum like a lingering echo— “Yea! that is duty that a man can do, And mine is now to send, not mine the event, Since that I may not go: call Orellana!”— A young man still, though in his auburn hair Time's silvery threads were spreading, and his brow Had gathered more than one long line of grey. But in his eye the wandering light of youth Still showed a mind unsettled in its aim, Though powerful to achieve what others planned. A dreamer was he in his hours of ease, And careless of preferment undeserved By action of his own. A volunteer, He came from drowsing by the torpid banks Of Guadiana to the Western world, Smit with the hope of some great deed of fame,— Which so absorbed his soul that lesser gain For its own sake, or as a central germ That tarries the slow-fostering of the years, Was blown contemptuous to the passing winds; For he would be at once i' the eye o' the world, Or live and die among the shadows seen By none. Yet think not he was idle all, Waiting to strike and strike but once for fame: His sword was ever at his chief's command, And what he undertook his very daring And utter recklessness, or rather say Firm confidence of the event, made sure and fast A fact in history. But mark his pride Or self-neglect, or call it what you will —After such enterprise he shunned to meet His grateful leader; and his comrades' praise Around the barrack-fire or in the tent, In town or field, fell cold upon his ear: Upon his heel he turned, and, listlessly Reclining on his couch with half-shut eyes, Or roaming vacantly in lonely places, They found him, and gave up the thankless task. Or if importunate the public voice Threatened ovation—he would seize his cloak; His sword was ever belted to his side; And disappear. Thus had he joined the band A day's march late that journeyed from Quito Under Gonzalo. Thus he clipt the winglets Of his own growing fame; for he would soar At once i' the eye o' the world, or sink unseen Among the shadows, known to none or all. —“If I have sent for thee,” Gonzalo said, “'Tis not to speak thy praise; for what thou hast Deserving praise thou hast from Heaven, and there The honour lies; and that thou knowest unmoved By voice of man; and therefore praise is thine In that I choose thee from among the rest, Deeming thee loyal, who hast well approved The motive of thy acts, to take my place And duteously fulfil my vows to Spain And to my brother: thou shalt take command Of this our ark, the brigantine—that bears The fortunes of our expedition: I Commit them to thy charge. Do thou descend Whither the Indians tell. Of some great stream That rolls its ink and flings its yellow foam Around some central capital they tell. There glory waits thee, ripened to thy hook; But bring me back a sheaf—a few stray ears I surely well may claim! We tarry here. Our hopes, our very life goes with thee! See Thou prove no alien! Choose thy men, and go!”— And Orellana knelt, and kissed the hand Of great Gonzalo, rose, and nothing said But turned in act to go. With searching eyes Gonzalo gazed upon his soldier bearing As wishful for some proof of loyalty; Then, as it came not, turning to the priest— “Thou, too,” he said, “wilt go.”—“Nay, here I stay,” The father answered; “tempt me not, my son, With the fruition of an earthly fame Bought with a bartered conscience! Even now The Devil is at mine elbow—I can feel His fingers on my shoulder, in mine ear His hot breath urging me to make a league With him and thee and Heaven; take thine offer, Abandon thee with all the show of friendship, Compound with Heaven for a brief course of sin By future sanctity—the greater saint And more acceptable to heaven the more I give my passions rein! ‘And what is he? A sick man dying in the wilderness, A withered stalk upon the tree of life That will be green no more’—Satan, avaunt! And thou, Gonzalo!—these are devil's words That urge my going, put into thy mouth By thy great enemy and mine and man's: Speak them no more! For, grant I leave thee here And go to what great glories who can doubt, How shall I hear and see amid the glare And blaze of triumph the dispassionate voice And the white star of duty? till perchance The tumult has sunk down and the time gone For doing duty? Oh, the Devil ever Wraps round a man the mantle of his praise Spoke by the yelling multitudes, whene'er He means to hide the irrevocable chance Of a great duty offered by the Lord!— So tempt me not!” The words were vehement And uttered as in anger—eyeballs starting, And the full veins upon his beaded brow Relieved like whipcord. From his pillow raised Upon one elbow, breathless, pallid, fixed As stares a statue with its marble eyes Rounded with wonder, and with doubt congealed, Gonzalo gazed upon the speaker. In The hush that followed a cicala ran Across the open doorway, on the roof Outside the tapping of a woodpecker Was heard, and one low distant moan subdued Its anguish in the woods. The father's eye Fell, and a chill ran through his frame: “For-give,” He said, in a strange wearied tone Altered and low: “Forgive the unwonted heat; For thou know'st not, my son, the carnal heart That beats beneath this mantle, as do I!” Sudden, and at a bound, Gonzalo leapt From his sick-bed, and with a strong man's voice— “What guarantee have I, if thus the storms Of wild ambition shake the Holy Church Personified in thee—what proof have I That Orellana will not play me false, Self-duped in sending him? Go! call him back! I, I myself—Here by sheer strength of will I fling this fever from me!—It is mine; The glory I have traced to this far haunt No hand shall seize but mine! And bring my mail— I, I myself will head the enterprise. No proxy suits with me. This very hour— Nay, on the instant—stand aside!” For here The father caught him staggering to the door, And forced him back, panting and flushed and faint Upon the couch. “Dost thou withstand me?” “I Withstand thee not—it is the hand of Heaven! Is this the resignation thou didst feel? Such resignation is but the result Of weakness to rebel. If thou wouldst live And heir the honour Heaven intends for thee Obey me!”—for he struggled yet to rise. “I have hid nothing from thee. Therein lies My error: but that I am true to thee Believe, and let me show it by remaining. Ask me no more to go: I will not go! My duty is with thee—and with these others, Our numerous sick, that must remain behind; But chief with thee; for thou art marked by Heaven For some great work, and I have charge of thee! Only live thou to do it. It is thine If one go at thy bidding though thy hand Should never finger the dictated work; And that a servant here relieve thy hand The hand of God upon thee laid in sickness Gives clear assurance 'tis the will of Heaven. —As for this Orellana, let him go Since one must go and thou hast chosen him! And for those fierce temptations that in thought Assailed my soul a short while since—of this Be sure, no fiercer storm, no tempest half so fierce Can Satan raise in Orellana: ‘I,’ (Thou say'st; for I can read thy inmost thoughts, Knowing my own so well) ‘If I,’ thou say'st, ‘A son of Holy Church can be so tempted,— If I a green branch burn so fiercely, what Swift-tongued destruction must lick up the dry?’ —Am I a green branch? I have read my life And studied my whole nature: that I am A son of Holy Church I know, and boast, Unworthy though I be; but Holy Church Gives not a change of nature: I have here Under these pious vestments the wild pulse Of warrior, and—root out the infirmity, O Heaven!—I feel a tigerish instinct stir Even in the pastoral service of the Church If bloodshed would but frighten to the fold The heathen flocks that roam the wilderness! To thee I make confession of my weakness That this confession may be as a chain To bind me closer to thee! I believe That in our band no breast is visited With half so fierce temptations, nor no heart Half so susceptible of earthly fame! And thou mightst but commission me to ruin, To send me girt with equal power with him This tool, this Orellana, whose dull heart, Though stout to dare what others planned, was never Stirred with the nobler passion to create And carve self-confident for his own ends. Fear not; this tool will do the work for thee More faithfully than I thy truer friend, And I shall yet be saved for thee and Heaven!” More was there in his looks and in his tone Than in the words, uttered impulsively And wildly ordered, to assure Gonzalo The revelation was indeed sincere. He stretched him out his hand; quickly the priest As catching at salvation caught the grasp Ere yet half way, and held it tight and long. Gonzalo's generous heart returned the pressure, And “I have known thee long,” he said; “but never Known truly till this hour. With reckless hand Thou hast loosened for me a prop on which I leaned as on a hill—nay! hear me out; There need be now no secrets 'twixt us twain: For I had thought thee steadfast as the Earth, Infallible as Heaven: Thou art, instead, Even in thy weaknesses, thy doubts of self, Thy struggles with the flesh, and all thy fears, A brother on whose breast I yet may lean, If not with such security as once, Surely with a new sympathy that both Imparts and gathers strength. And so, I trust thee; Go he, stay thou, thy will is wholly mine!” While yet he spake Day fell; the sunset spilt Its crimson on the waters; down the stream With a great rush it sped, purpling the wood, The river-banks, the brigantine, the air, With the reflection of its sanguine glow. It was a world of red—red leaves, red waves, Red faces; e'en Gonzalo's pallid face Took on the hue of health: all things were dyed In the rich rubious translucent streams Of the great fountain welling in the West! The Father's eyes were on Gonzalo, his Looked wistfully out through the open door Of the rough wooden shed—his hospital— Upon the evening glory of the world: The brigantine lay moored within his gaze Motionless, save where the eye might note A certain rhythmic movement of her mast Obedient to the lapping of the stream. What thoughts were his, what longings or what fears, He uttered not, save that unconsciously By pressure of the hand fast locked in his He intimated to the watchful priest A spirit busy within him forcing up The gateways of the future. Thus they sat, The Father with his broad back towards the door Shrouded in shadow. On Gonzalo's face The red light died away, the air grew dim; Wild dissonant cries answering to dissonant cries Of birds and chattering apes, unearthly screams! Ran like a desecration down the aisles Of the wide-vaulted wood. Low in the shade, Appearing here and reappearing there, Tiny initial sparks of wavering fire Twinkled about, till o'er the tufted trees Diana raised her argent arc and shot The first dart of her beauty through the gloom! The solemn Night was hers: high o'er the woods That underneath spread like a sea of leaves, O'er which the night-wind moaned and made no stir Among the billows and reposeful waves, She walked serene in chosen loneliness As if her meditations would outlast Eternity. The wanderers were asleep Wrapt in oblivious visions all, save one, The holy Father: He, from where he sat, Beside Gonzalo's couch, gently unclasped The sleeper's feverish hand, and gathering up The rustlings of his robe, stole from the shed With more than woman's care. At the low door Free from the shadow of the shed he stood Full in the moonlight. First he glanced to heaven, Then on the width of waters weltering by Fixed his keen gaze as if he would enforce Confession of the secret of their goal: More stealthily the waters seemed to glide Under his searching eye; and longer he, Rapt in a reverie of human life, The mystery of its birth and course and end, Had stood, entranced under the mystic spell Of moonlight on a river yet unnamed Lying familiarly, but that a fish Leapt up the stream and sank with peaceful plunge Amid a spray of diamonds; whereat The Father started, brushed the dreams away With open hand across his troubled brow, Then with uplifted face looked straight to heaven, The silver moonlight on his moving lips As if in prayer: from the pure deeps above That from the feet of God flow down to earth His spirit drank assurance, rest, and faith, And was refreshed. Along the river-bank He passed to where the watch half leaned, half lay Snoring against a tree: his head thrown back Revealed his naked throat that glimmered white Beneath a beard black-pointed toward the moon. With angry hand he twitched the sleeper's beard— “Rouse thee! but question not—where lies to-night Young Sanchez?” And the sentinel abashed, Awkward, and dazed, with spear-encumbered hand Rubbing his chin, glanced wildly round the camp, Then pointing with the other—“Near the bank In the big tent beside the tall assaí: 'Tis he relieves me.” “Let him relieve thee now! If I mistake not, thou art one of those Impatient of preferment, and unfit To fill the meanest post with the first want, Fidelity: go, house thee in a sheet; And when—for fate gives sloth a length of years— They ask thee to recount at home in Spain The achievements of thy youth, boast of thy deeds, But in thy boasting, blush to recollect This night's disgrace! Comrade! take this, and go— A year of loyal service, borne with pain, And left to speak its own reward, will scarce Efface the blot upon thy name to-night!” Came from beneath a tall paxinba's roots, That as on tiptoe stood stretching its neck Above its forest confrères, Hernan Sanchez, Equipped for outpost duty. Straight he marched And steady as a tower to where the priest Waited his coming: “Art thou one,” said he, “Of Orellana's band?” The soldier bowed— “One of the fifty I.” “A volunteer?” “Sought out,” replied the youth with modest pride, “Ere yet I knew to intercede to go!” “Thou art Gonzalo's standard-bearer?” “Yea; By his own gift that honour do I bear!” “And he has honoured thee! requite it, youth! —Tell me, for youth has still a live ideal By which to dress its conduct, who is thine?” “The Marquis, ere we left Quitó; since then, Oh, need'st thou ask? our noble chief Gonzalo.” “Thou art not one of those who worship still The rising star?” “Thou wouldst insult me, priest? —Prove me, and then upbraid me!” “Nobly said; 'Tis for that end I come, to prove and—praise thee! For when thy conscience, speaking in thy breast, Shall praise thy conduct, hear in it the voice Of honest men; among which rank am I, And own no other. Thou wilt go to-morrow Under the leadership of Orellana To great discoveries, freedom, life, and fame. Let not the whirl of fortune turn thy head: Remember thou thy fealty to Gonzalo; He goes with you—misunderstand me not— For Orellana is but as thyself, Nor more nor less, divested of the power Lent him by great Gonzalo: honour it, Be jealous of it in thy leader's charge; But see thou make no transfer of thy faith To him the man that wields it!—I had said The same to Orellana following thee Hadst thou been chosen to the chief command. There is no treason in my counsel, then, But truest loyalty to those that go And those that stay: we constitute a State Commissioning you with powers which you may use Against the State that grants them. This he knows, This Orellana; and I have no cause To doubt his faithfulness: assist him, thou, To keep his faith—but slay him if he fail!” This said, abrupt he turned and disappeared Back to his post in the low wooden shed Where in delirious sleep Gonzalo lay Tossing. The camp next morning was astir As dawn crept up the water: with the first Long level lance of pioneering light That struck the tall paxinba's topmost plume Ten thousand voices woke, and the dim wood And the grey air burst from the trance of Night; And screams and shrieks and sharp dissevered notes That intimated freedom rent the sky. Flocks of white, green, and scarlet parroquets Leapt from their perch; thousands of toucans flew With outstretched bill seeking their morning meal: Here on a heavy-podded inga's branch Some twenty would alight with clumsy foot, Shaking the ripe fruit ready for the drop Into the stream a hundred feet below: The nimble trogon with obedient wing Skimming the mid-air, swerved with easy grace And caught the falling fruit and disappeared. Herons, and terns, and gulls innumerable Followed the sinuous current, or made halt Upon a floating tree, or on the marge Searched for their food among the water-weeds. While ever and again a kingfisher, With back of glossy green, shot down the river Like volant ball; and golden orioles, And troupials, banded black and yellow, whisked From nest to mid-air and from mid-air back To slender purse-like nest depending fair From the high branches all adown the sky. Amid the lower shrubs that fringed the strip Between the wood and water, bush-shrikes ran, Their long loose silky feathers fluttering fierce With joy, as they impaled with corneous beak Their insect-victims on the hard-barked bough. Meanwhile the golden disc of the new sun Shone through the trees like a great shield of gold: Whereat the moon grew faint, and stole away Worn to transparent thinness in the West; And as the round of red rejoicing Day Rose free at last of forest-screen, she slipped Ghost-like behind the shelter of the hills. How do familiar scenes, daily beheld, And daily held to be the stereotype Of long-traditioned nature meaning nothing, Grow suddenly significant! What power, Ebbing and flowing in the speechless air, And growing half-articulate in the cries Of birds, and in the whispers of the woods, And smiling in the sun, or in the cloud Frowning, gives character and mood and mind To dull or idle nature?—Nay, what power In man informs the brutish earth with soul, Shooting a meaning into clods and stones To prop a hope or feed a cherished fear? 'Tis not in nature: but the God in man, As man was God-created from the clay, Breathes into nature mystery of meaning, Then wrests her riddle to his own desire, Strengthened and propped by natural sympathy. So to the nobler of that hopeful band Whom Orellana gathered to his cause Came with a speedier course that morning's sun, And larger life was on the water's marge Pulsing with warmer flow in every wing. Nature expectant of a famous deed That day should see commence was earlier up. In all they saw there was a harmony Benevolent to their purpose, and the heavens Smiled in consent of all their hopes and schemes. Under the smiling morn the patient bark Slept idly on the shallows: hasty feet Struck heavily on the gangway—a slim plank That swung from shore to ship; but still she dreamed Rocked in the eddying waters: fruit sun-dried And mandioc meal in bags and boxes borne On willing backs were hurried up the plank And tumbled in the vessel: with more heed Guns, and gunpowder in a chest ill spared From a diminished stock, were stored; and now A hasty meal was snatched or from the stream By flowering thorn-hook, or from sweet assaí In clusters of small purple berries struck By climber with his pole: then came the priest And in the ears of all confirmed the charge Of Orellana, limiting his power, And asking his acceptance of the trust In words which Orellana gave,—and gave Besides fealty in clear well-ordered phrase Both for himself and men to great Gonzalo. Thus satisfied the Father caused advance The leader and his fifty from the rest; And while they knelt, dinting the forest spores And choking many a weedy cassia's bells And flowered convolvulus, around the priest, He solemnised promise and enterprise By special mass appointed by the Church For mariners at sea, and shrived them all. The ritual o'er, like schoolboys freed from school They raced on board the galley, swung her round Instinct with life into the middle channel Churning the stream, ere scarce the tense-drawn rope That kept her to her moorings snapt across And curling sprayed the water. Then like bird Hovering in mid-air on vibrating pens Ere yet it flies a straight course down the gale, She, quivering with the sudden keen delight Of freedom, all her dreams shook to the air, A moment with backed oars stood on the stream, Then, thrusting out like one her twenty paddles, Dipped with a thought in the thin element, And bounded forth between her lines of foam, That widened in her wake, and waned away Amongst the tumbling river ere the cheer Of God-speed! from their comrades on the bank Ceased in the rowers' ears. Their answering hail Came back as from another world, faint-voiced And far and past recall. And long they gazed Ranged on the bank like statues of despair Staring with strained and film-o'erspreading eye After a disappearing hope: they saw Rise on the bark now dwindled to a bird The white wing of her sail; and as the curve Of wooded shore denied them farther view It made partial amends by sending back An echo of the boat-song sifted drear Through the dim arches of the pillared palms. Sank from the light and life of cheerful day The lingering echoes falling restfully Into the caves of silence,—as distil Through chinks and cracks to intramontane wells The drops which twinkled on the tempest's wing In rainbow lustre ere the tumult rose That dashed them with a myriad diamonds more Into the surging heather! Sank the strain From healthful morn: yet through the curtain door Which severs dreamland and the drear abode Of shadows from the light of open day A thrice-enfeebled wail ran plaintively: It crossed Gonzalo's spirit in the dark, Labouring belated like a lonely bird Above a moaning sea through cloud and storm And falling stars and ruin and eclipse; And in his sleep wrought on mysteriously The patient tossed his arms in weak despair. The bark shot onward into unknown scenes. So shot the ray of new-created light Into chaotic gloom: so bursts the dawn Of knowledge on the wondering infant mind. Chaos, surprised with happiness, looked grim, Laughed, and danced into cosmic loveliness: Even so the mind breaks into rapturous singing And leaps with joy of an immortal pulse. And did not the new scenes laugh and look glad, And shape their gladness into dance and song, To be thus visited and viewed of man, Far wandering but arrived at last, though late, To claim his due inheritance? The river Proud of the burden bore the heirs along Of all the Amazons, sang at the prow The songs of hope, and at the helm repeated The achievements of the past in choral praise. The little waves that sparkled in the sun, And smiled, and ran hand linked in tiny hand, Gay messengers transmitted from the bows, Lisped to the crowded banks, and venturous reeds Advanced to meet them in the shallow bays, “The long-expected heirs are passing by.” Whereat the rushes waved their bannerets And the bright banks broke into brighter bloom. The forest formed its ranks along the shores And crowded forward, where the river bent, With homage and oblation long delayed But now extended in each laden bough. The very airs, the wandering spies of heaven, That roam from Alp to Andes, seeing all Man's glories and the grandeur of the world, Caught the contagious glow of sympathy With wave and wood, and whispered flattering tales. The homage and the tribute and the triumph Were seen and felt by all as with one heart. For as the hours fled and the distance grew Between them and their comrades left behind They gathered in, mutely, by slow degrees Community of feeling, hopes and fears, That merged at last incorporate in the bark Into identity. Thus animate Forward they sped with ever-joyful leaps Along the reaches of the mighty stream. Suns rose and set paving their level path With robes of scarlet and with cloth of gold. Night flung submissive at their fearless feet Her gemmed tiaras and her strings of stars, The dowry of old Time: the silver moon From a full horn rained tribute down the sky And widened nightly in admiring wonder, While still the attendant winds buzzed flatteringly Of marvels that should open on their view, And willingly gave up their wonted freedom To guide and retinue the sons of Spain Through valley lands long centuries known to them. On swept the brig borne on the river's back, While hopes like cherubim flew on before, Their white wings rustling ever round the bows Or ever disappearing in a flash Of dazzling plumes at every vista's end Or shady turning! On—no need for pause: The river gave them of its watery stores; The trees held out their fruitage, and they plucked With unstayed course, sparingly, as they passed The offered bounty of the burdened bough. It was the noon of Night: a far-off moon Looked from the lofty firmament aslant Down on the speeding brigantine through twists Of stationary cloud. The winds blew soft, Rocking the slumb'rous trees; and all was still,— Save where the forest-hum for ever in Incipient burst of speech deceived the listener; And there was, too, the babble and the throb Of lapsing waters felt along her keel Lifting the vessel, as a cross is lifted Gently upon the bosom of a nun Inhaling and exhaling in her dreams Regular breath. The helmsman at his post Dreamt of Castile. High on the forward deck Stood one whose brow the moon with cooling beams Tiara'd,—while with sleepless glance he questioned His future of the stars: “Say ye who stand A scriptured mystery on creation's wall, Revealed by night, invisible in the sun,— If in your radiance wrapt from human ken, As ye are wrapt in all-unfolding Day, The story of my destiny is traced! And I may know but that I may fulfil With firmer, bolder heart Heaven's hopes in me! . . . “Faith in myself I have not: I am but A waif upon the tide of human life, Helmed and commanded by a higher power, Whose fingers on my fate I seem to feel Shaping my course, and leaving me,—as I Shape for this passive brig its unknown way At intervals upon the drifting stream. . . . “Let me indulge the fancy: ships there are That rule the waves awhile: there waits for them A smiling surface and a hidden rock. Some, with contemptuous gesture tossed to land A broken wreck, waste publicly away. Others the ocean slips from, leaving them Upon a barren beach, their ventures o'er, Henceforth to blister in the sun, and rot. —Each has its various end.—But who would see In all the necessary whirls and shifts Of fortune that befall or floating logs Or floating ships the hand of God, save him Who gives his god indeed impossible power But less of wisdom than himself to guide it?... “Chance rules it all; or else the fool is right Who, rather than seek out with patient search The mighty Maker, makes one for himself And worships his own idol—not less surely Than blacks in Africa their wooden blocks; —Worships a baby god who takes delight In dropping nuts into a forest pool To hear the lonely splash, in whirling logs Along the barren seas, and puffing leaves Rustling and red around an idle hill. . . . “And may not man, superior though he be, To whom with nuts and logs and leaves the same Final decay succeeds an idle life, Be equally the abandoned toy of chance And orphaned of his Maker? . . . “'Tis not so With him: inferior nature, to itself Left and the governance of man, repeats Its patient function ordered from without Incapable of will; but man is free, Though, still partaking of the lumpishness Of mortal earth, he be the slave of law So far; and may be wholly; to the which His grosser nature drags him, drugs his will, And wraps the aspiring spirit flesh-encased In most ignoble slothfulness and sleep. But souls of noble possibility, Though lapped in indolence, shall rouse at last And will their liberty and laugh at law. Among which rank am I; no more a boat Beached among shells and shingle, or afloat Upon a drifting current idly borne Helmless, and having no far haven marked, Its free-determined aim, beyond the roar Of surges and cyclones, and past the maze Of atoll, archipelago, and shoal. “'Tis flow-tide with me, and I feel the chance That has withdrawn its strong sustaining waves From underneath Pizarro's stranded bows Lapping my fortunes and upbearing me. But here I ask no more, would trust no more To idle chance, but, master of my will, Wrest from the laws of gross inferior earth My future, and contrive with strenuous care Of my own choice a famous destiny. . . . Would Heaven but give assurance of my wish And of my hope, confirming them to faith That I am free and master of myself, How would the token I entreat in vain Nerve me with triple strength to bend the laws Of nature to my will! I have been long A very tool to other men, with which They smote to their own purposes the chains Which nature would impose; then flung me by, A disregarded and inglorious—fool. “Enough of this! Hereafter for myself I work—I plan, I live, I joy in freedom! Chance favours me; Nature, already tamed, Turns with obsequious smile her sympathy Upon me; and the stars—if ever stars Registered in their rubric on Heaven's door A lofty deed, may have some trace of mine. Never,—if in obedience to the priest I, backward toiling, bear my own deserts And fling them at the feet of a Pizarro Disburdening me of glory all my own. But verily if onward on this highway, Which ends indeed at Charles's throne in Spain! The question is—backward or forward, then: Back to obscurity, to keep my faith With one who robs me of the fame I win; Onward to fame and freedom, life and power, —And ignominy of a broken word And an abandoned friend?” He paused, and weighed The question, while his hand balanced a sword Mechanically mimicking his mind. “Give sign, ye stars, Ye voiceless keepers of Heaven's closed archives, That hold his former and his latter will! Say, is it Heaven's great will that having had The reins of this behemoth-river thrust Into my hands, I fling them in the air To the wild hands of hundreds stretched to grasp them; Or that I bridle him through all his bounds And ride him to the sea?” Just then a star By unseen fingers lightly disengaged Slid from the zenith in a line of light, That was reflected in the river's course, Eastward o'er hidden empire to the sea. It fell into the scale-pan of the balance That symbolled progress in the thoughtful mind Of Orellana: doubt, distrust of self, Loyalty, and danger, and delay and fear Flew up and kicked the beam. “Be this,” he cried With arm upraised, “the signal that I seek! It woos me down the water; in its flight It sped like arrow from the bow of Heaven Shot o'er the region that I yet shall rule To guide me to my kingdom!—'Tis enough! There is no wrong in following Heaven's decree, There is no faltering fear: Heaven's eyes behold Me, and my hopes are histories in Heaven!” The steersman Sanchez, dreaming o'er the helm Of tranquil ease and household joys obscure Afar in fair Castile, roused by the words, Looked up to see his leader on the poop Transfigured in the moonlight, falling clear Of cloud or bough around him, by resolve To something more than seems in common man. On o'er the olive pathway of the stream Through solitudes lit up with radiant suns Or steeped in mystic moonlight, joyfully With song upon their lips or lapped in dream Calmly they glided, trusting in the calm Reliant face of their still-thoughted leader. One day at noon, rounding a river cape Clothed with a lofty forest, ere they knew They slid into a black tumultuous stream Of broken waves that hurrying from the West Made sudden swerve to southward, drinking swift In its fierce wrath the placid olive wave, And swirling the frail bark caught in the rapids Round in the yellow foam. By dexterous twist Of rudder aided by auxiliar oar They shot into still water, and lay to Upon a sandy bottom on the lee Of a large island where in former years The rivers mingling met,—now far below. And here they landing looked in vain for tower, Temple, or teocalli o'er the waste Of woodland stretching round—listened in vain For cymbal or for drum where in far glades Or on sequestered plains religious rites Might then be celebrating, or great chiefs Or borla'd monarch holding with his queen Peaceful review or mustering troops for war. And here they fell in passionate dispute Of farther action, frequently renewed, Yet ever ending in divisive taunt And more divisive silence. To go back Now that the goal was reached were to preserve The faith of gentlemen. This was opposed,— It were the work of months against the stream Toiling, and even if the work were done What could it bring Gonzalo or themselves But disappointment of a fostered hope Of fame to him; to them the mute reproach, Loud-tongued perchance, of disappointed men? Then to go forward—that were breach of faith, Shameful desertion of confiding friends And blindfold rush through danger;—or it were Bravery, and reason, and a sure reward. And so they strove, through the long hours of noon, With the strange Stygian river's dismal hue, That would receive no glory from the sun, Reflected in their faces. In the gaps And pauses of their talk, one heard the note Of drowsy bell-bird, snow-white o'er the shade Of mountain-forest faint and far away. At length up sprang the leader: he had watched With vigilant eye the varying tide of talk, And now broke silence. “In this camp,” he said, “There are two parties where there should be one. —One in the brig, while I command her, one And only one there must be!” Here he paused, Then with his scabbard on the firm smooth sand He drew a parting line: “You that believe I should command that party, cross this line And range yourselves beside me: here stand I!” And stepped across with sword unsheathed. Many With acclamation leapt across the line; Some crossed in silence; and, with lingering step, Others; till only one at last remained, Young Sanchez. Him the sole inhabitant And prisoner of a melancholy isle They left, his brave face turned from them away Proudly resentful of their mocks and prayers, And loyal to Gonzalo. Off they fled Like unreturning arrow swiftly loosed From a strong bow new bent. Free was their course Upon the hurrying rapids down the stream, Yet aided still by twinkling oar, and sail Hoised on the rattling yard. Their wish was now Under their fresh-elected chief to unwind The mystery of the river to the main, Glance at the virgin glories of its coasts, Unfold to Europe their discovery, And claim its government, as Cortez claimed The rule of Mexico.—What thrill was theirs Of still-succeeding ecstasy to trace The panorama of the Amazons Throughout the mighty river's thousand links, Past selva and savanna to the sea! What joy to feel their unimpeded bark Leap in responsive rapture light along As if, like some new creature come to life Upon congenial element, it shared The sanguine hopes, the mad impatient pulse And keen delight of motion swift and free That made them demigods, body and mind! O, in those days and fairy-visioned nights, Feeding on manna hopes that come no more To this old worn-out earth, they lived indeed, Breathing heroic air, and lifted high Above the sordid cares that creep within The guarded ease of villa nests, and make The peasant's term a pitiable strife With Hunger sniffing wolf-like at the door! Forest and forest passed them, whirling west With all their unclaimed grandeur: hill on hill In the far distance, capped with snow-white quartz Thin-veined with gold, rose up and sank adown, Doing them stately homage: shady alleys And sunlit glades in the dim columned woods Opened and closed their beauties as they came: Islets and infant archipelagos Thronging their wavy pathway grew in size, And shrank again behind them: rivers poured Their roaring tribute from imperial urns Into the main of waters where they rode Almost invisible in midmost channel; For wide and wider grew the guarded banks, As if the opening avenue must soon With all its retinue of silent trees End the long triumph of its thousand miles. And here at last were towns and heathen fanes Glittering with all the glory and the glow Of occidental wealth; and tawny chiefs, Hung round with rubies and with emeralds, Welcomed them from the shores; and martial maids Of Amazonian stature, breasted round With plates of beaten gold, stood on the banks And seemed to offer tribute, and entreat The strangers' stay. Still on and on they sped With all the glory of the Occident Unrolling like a map before their eyes; Until, at last, their river voyage o'er, They came one sunset within earshot of The sullen roar of Ocean swinging ever His billowy strength against the stolid land. All night they listened to the measured beat Booming along the dark: and at the dawn, Lo, the far banks receding north and south Never again to meet! and the green sea With all its millioned multitude of waves Tumbling in chainless freedom! and the sun Slow-rising as of old with welcoming smile Out of the depths of the familiar sea! The muffled boom of ocean far away Is in mine ears again: but now no more As in blue breakers whitening on the beach Hear I the voice of cheerful energy, Activity and change: it is the moan Of baffled feebleness that flings in vain A tangled waste of drenched and drownèd hopes In final effort on the rocks of fate. And sing ye may, ye mariners, who launch Your gilded galleys in the freshening dawn Upon a sunlit sea: to you the winds Call joyous from the deep; to you the plain Of ocean is a silver-fretten floor Of sapphire luminous with the living gleams Of the great crystal sky-dome over all. And ye with faces brown that, homeward bound, Press where the faded figurehead below Looks towards the enlarging hills, and shout for joy When on the far edge of the safe-crossed main The old kirk-spire shoots up, the old round tower At the pierhead, and on the concave shore Houses and homes in social brotherhood With open door waiting your late return —Ye, too, may sing in heart, your labours o'er, The quiet haven in your weary view, And the calm lights of evening overhead Steadily shining as the sun goes down. But wonder not if on despondent lips The voice of song has died, and querulous care Breaking a silent grief draws nigh to them Who on the ocean lost and far from home Feel neither morning's flush of airy hopes Nor evening's rest resigned—see neither sun Nor lunar light nor stellar, wrapt in mist And pelting rains that intermingle night With dawnless day and unseen sea with land. O dreary seas, your sullen leaden grey Will ever sun enlace with gold again? Will ever hope rise more in complete orb Of brilliant song, Apollo with a crown Of fresh-dug gold luting it o'er your sadness? O many times in heedless ears shall sound The solar melody, in heedless eyes The solar blazon be outrolled above Your leaden waters! But to one to whom These were the joy which youthful monarchs feel When first they grasp a sceptre, nay, were life, Were very life throbbing through all the veins And arteries as with eternal pulse —To Orellana, never, never more! On him the shadow of the Hand of Death Descended darkening, as a falcon's wing Falls on the snowy radiance of a dove. Oh, how should he escape that closing Hand? Would the imperial parchment in his gripe, With the vain sanction of its dangling seals, Its signatures, its pomp of Latin phrase That gave the wealth and width of the Brazils From seashore to sierra westward far, To Don Francisco Orellana, bribe? Would prayer, or tear, or impious sacrifice For just a little summer's lease of life Such as an insect has, persuade? Would love Of wife new-married by vicarious pain Avert? But what were all the wish of life, Now hope of life was gone, for that one stain Of perjury that blackened all the past? The stain sent rays of gloom even to the realm Of sunny infancy: and forward far It rushed into Eternity, a flood Of widening blackness! Orellana groaned And hid his face with both his hands: “The star!” He muttered in his agony—“The star! Oh, I mistook it for the will of Heaven!” Beside him where he tossed in fever-pain In the dim narrow cabin sat his wife With ne'er a word of comfort in her heart. His men dotted the deck like images Of famine and despair—hating both him Who with a lying story lured them forth To chase a madman's fancy, and themselves Who credited a dreamer. Vainly they Had thrust through mist and rain, through creek and strait And muddy shallow, searching for a channel To inland El Dorado:—in despair Now waited for the end. The rain-streams hissed Along the deck, and all around the ship, And on the sea, and all along the sea To where the neighbour ships loomed through the mist Like veilèd monuments; and at the window Of the dim cabin where the leader lay Hissed loudly; and in scornful hissings drowned, Sank Orellana from the world of men. BRIERS “There grows a bonnie brier buss in oor kailyard.” —Old Song. I. IN MEMORIAM. “There is one event unto all.” Out there in the sunshine, that's gilding The garden that seldom is green, The workmen are lazily building A pillar in praise of the Dean. Last week they were at a church-steeple, And next week it may be a jail: —They're a common mechanical people, You see, and their labour's for sale. Two soldiers at them are gazing, Schoolboys, and a loafer or two: Asks one, “What is it they're raising?” Another, “And what did he do?” Pale Frank hurries past to the College, Hollow-eyed, red-nosed, and lean; The way to get on is get knowledge, And he's hoping one day to be Dean. II. THE MASK OF MISERY. “Thou art unto them as a very lovely song of one that hath a pleasant voice and can play well on an instrument: for they hear thy words but they do them not.” The lattice is open, and into the street Floats music sad and slow; To the midnight Bobby it's quite a treat —Up there there's company, light, and heat, And the luxury of woe. Now none will say she cannot play, That lady at the keys; And the singer that beside her stands With Gounod's music in his hands Can melt a soul with ease. There is a green hill far away— And the passion sinks and swells. —Do you think they believe it? that lady gay? That silken tenor? . . . Or would you say It's a sound and nothing else? Be this as it may, they dissipate The night with wailing psalms; And the rest of the company clap and prate, While a waif from the Pleasaunce at the gate Sings merrily for alms. III. FOUND DEAD. A little wayward human elf Lay dead at Cæsar's feet Where sceptred Cæsar lifts himself Out of the vulgar street. A passing workman at the dawn Of a December day, He found this little doeless fawn, This “Home”-reared runaway. A wild bud by the rude winds blown From its untended sod; A young life on the altar stone Flung to a pagan god. They bore the slender fragile thing From Cæsar's feet of stone. And who was she?—By their whispering A child of Cæsar's own. IV. THESE AND THOSE. Under an apple-tree, laden With pink promissory-notes, Loiter a man and a maiden —Each on the other one dotes. Blue through the apple-boughs o'er them It gleams like a sapphire, the sky; Rosy and radiant before them Vistas invitingly lie. Out of their sight and their hearing, But only over the wall, Two are snarling and sneering Who love not each other at all. What had you said had you seen them As I have put them in rhyme? For these are those, and between them Is only a measure of time. V. PARTING AND MEETING. They quarrelled, parted with a frown, Took each his separate path, And that and many a day went down And rose upon their wrath. And Jim went east and Duncan west, And not a word said Jim; And Duncan—well, he would be blest Before he'd speak to him. The tranquil hamlet of their birth The brothers left behind; Wider between them grew the Earth And keener blew the wind. . . . In 'Frisco where the cypress waves Its melancholy green, Are James and Duncan Gordon's graves, And but a step between. VI. THE PLEADER. It's an edifying sight to see His teeth like ivory shine As he laughs with a lord familiarly Over the walnuts and wine: Or as from court to court he skips, Too busy to look grand, With a golden lie between his lips And truth half-choked in his hand. Busy indeed! And, little with big, And one time with another, Must many a thought hive under his wig: —There's never one of his mother. Over a tub in the village she bends, Red-armed amid the suds, While he a titled rogue defends In town before my Luds. VII. DELILAH. “Quod dicit amanti In vento, et rapidâ scribere oportet aquâ.” She put an arm around his neck, and, looking in his eyes,— “For other love I nothing reck; 'tis yours alone I prize.” She kissed his brow, she kissed his mouth, she made his heart rejoice,— “In all the land from north to south you are my only choice.” —And yet he knew within a week, at most within a year, A like confession she might speak in some one else's ear. VIII. THE TWO SUNSETS. Finished, on the studio wall Hangs the painter's masterpiece; Round it crowd the critics all Gabbling like a flock of geese. This is good, now! That is splendid! —The foreshortening on that oak! See how well the greys are blended! Ah! but here's the master-stroke! —So they gabble, heads awry, Craning all their necks together, Just like geese when in the sky There's a change to dirty weather. Sad at heart the painter pale Turns his back upon them all, Watching down the long green vale Summer's sun in glory fall. Pass unseen, translucent splendour! Change and pass, ye coloured fires! Apes to art their homage render —Heaven's great pictures Art admires. They will gabble over paint Till the night descending blind them, Heedless of the gold that, faint, Fades, and fainter yet behind them. IX. THE PROMENADE. He beats his wife, who in the street Hangs smilingly upon his arm With such a sad, pathetic, sweet, And tremulous grace in the deceit —None but a devil could do her harm. The crowds sail on, the coaches roll; And once, as former friends drove by, One tearful glance at him she stole: Yet this man with the little soul —He has a body six foot high. X. JOAN THAMSON'S MAN. He fears his wife, who in the street Leads him about from shop to shop; His training is a thing complete, He's taught to carry, and look neat, And stop wherever she may stop. To-day I marked him when a shoal Of boisterous bachelors cantered by; At them a greyhound glance he stole: And this man of the little soul —His body's over six foot high. XI. WITHOUT AND WITHIN. Martial words to a mournful chant! But martial words her patrons want Where the bounce is big if the sense be scant —Though to her it's nothing at all; It happens to be some jingo rant Caught from a music-hall. A white face hooded in a shawl, Upon whose faded tartan fall Prelusive hail-drops round and small In the blaze of the dram-shop seen: —A tapster flings her a coin, and a call For “Jock o' Hazeldean.” Within, across a table bend A drunkard and his drunken friend, Who with the empty gill-stoup end Keeps time with noisy beat To the song the girl he should defend, His wife, sings in the street. XII. THE AULD HOOSE AND THE NEW. Click go the balls in the billiard-room, The glasses clink at the bar, Mine host at the door looks into the gloom —Looks up at the evening star. That star of old has looked too cold On a Cæsar's cinctured brow To envy the gold whose links enfold The breast of a Boniface now! And covet not, mine honest host, The treasury of heaven: 'Tis to enrich some beggar's ghost Yon gold will yet be given. And here it comes adown the street, Slips into the window blaze And sings with tremulous voice and sweet A song of eldern days. The auld house, the auld house, What tho' the rooms were wee? Kind hearts were dwellin' there And bairnies fu' o' glee! The mavis still doth sweetly sing, The bluebell sweetly blaw, The bonnie Earn's clear-windin' still— But the auld house is awa! The Auld Hoose to the simple strain Rises in memory clear; He sees the round-stone walls again, In youthful days so dear; A bent old man with silver hair, His father! at the plough— God! what avails the anguished prayer That he were living now? He looks out into the vocal gloom, But his thoughts are wandering far, While the balls go click in the billiard-room And the glasses clink at the bar. SYLVÆ THE GENIUS OF THE GLEN. (A Ballad of the Sunless Summer.) It was the glen so dear to us, And on the eve of May, Yet ne'er a leaf was on the buss Or blossom on the spray. The sky aboon was grey and still —Oh, something was to blame! And immelodious flowed the rill That gives the glen its name. Grey were the dripping craigs wi' fogg, The ferns were red and sere, Dowie the day, as days that dog The wa-gaun o' the year. And but ae gowan in a nook Had daured to ope its ee; And, wae was I! it seemed to look Reproachfully on me. And mair than wae, amazed was I A flower o' gentle fame Should lay its woodlan' shyness by And bid me bide a blame. The linties on the scroggy brae, They hadna heart to sing; In undertones they seemed to say “Ye've robbed us o' the spring!” And wae and mair bewildered yet I waited for their sang: Puir things! I only heard them fret That winter days were lang. The faded firs and larches tall On me looked darkly down, They wagged their heads together all, And met me with a frown. I turned me from the steep glen-side To glancing linn and pool: The naiad down the water wide Fled with a sound of dule! Oh, doubly dowie noo the glen, And drearer yet the sky, And sad the winds that noo and then Complaining passed me by. For I was mingled wi' the cause That wrought the season wrong, Had somehow meddled wi' the laws That lead the months along; Had stolen the sunshine from the air, The greenery from the glen, Had killed the querulous wren wi' care, And made the merle a wren. O' whatna man could that be true? —Surely he'd spare, I cried, The glen in which he came to woo, In which he won his bride. I carved her name upon an oak Last August, and since then Although Glen Farg to ither folk, To me 'tis Annet's glen. And Scotland in its hundred nooks Nae brawer glen can show, Nor yet amang her hundred brooks A burn sae dear I know. And wae am I, and sad indeed, Sae fair a glen should grieve And wear the weary winter weed Sae late as summer eve. —Wi' that the day grew dim as e'en, A glamour owre me fell, And weird and foreign grew the scene, And far away as well. And first a thin forwandered wind, As of a voice that grieves Gaed up the glen, and left behind A rustling of red leaves. And next a hush fell on the glen; Nor move nor breathe could I; The hush sank into deeps, and then I heard a long-drawn sigh. Then, from the shadow of a lirk That cleaves the grey glen wall A reverend figure from the birk Rose like a tower, and tall. His face was dusky red as leaves That burn with autumn fire: Such tint the cedar-bough receives When summer suns retire. Brown beechen leaves that once were green Composed his coat of mail, And round his long white beard was seen A fringe of lichens pale. And if the centuries had enlaced His cheek with many a line, There was a vigorous freedom graced And made his look divine. Upon his brow there sat awry A crown of faded fern, And troubled was his coal-black eye, And grave his look, and stern! And full on me he fixed his glance —Oh, but his glance was keen! Like shimmer of a flying lance It dazzled baith my een! “I am the Genius of the Glen,” He thus the silence brake, “And thou—! Among the sons of men A falser never spake! “Last August to this glen you brought A blithesome maid, and true; And when my fairest bower you sought, I welcomed both of you! “I housed you in my fairest bower —True love is all so rare; It was a joy I feel this hour To see so kind a pair. “And all my nymphs and naiads took A peep at where you lay, Then hastening back to brake and brook, Talked of you all the day. “So glad were they, so pleased was I; And when you vowed to bring The maiden with the sunbright eye This way again in spring, “I vowed that spring might come or stay, But as for mine and me, Our glen and we would not be gay Till she should come to see! “And birds are mute, and flowers have slept, And trees delayed to leave; And sadly we our vows have kept Till summer's very eve. “And here on summer's eve art thou, The falsest among men, Who darest with a broken vow To enter Annet's glen!” His voice was stern, and anger blazed In baith his coal-black een: “And this,” he cried, with arm upraised, “Our welcome would have been!” A flash—a rush of opening leaves, A mist of emerald light, And green with yellow interweaves A vision of delight! A million myriad leaves and flowers, Where flowers and leaves were none; And where but late were sunless bowers, New gilded by the sun. The sunshine on the soft green leaf Flowed down from broad blue skies: —Oh me! it was a dear relief To rest the weary eyes. And merle and throstle sat or flew, And whistled loud and sang; And more and more their gladness grew, Till all the valley rang. And down the glen the water ran, With pleasure plashing cool; And roses blushed, and lilies wan Grew pale by every pool. The flaunting woodbine o'er the rocks Held out its honeyed horn; The belted bees flew past in flocks And incensed with the morn. The broom was fringed with golden flame, And through the woodland wide A wind that wandered without aim Grew sad for joy, and sighed. Dear Lord! it was a pleasant sight To see but in a dream— The green leaves, and the holy light, And the clear, flowing stream. Sure Eden glimpses yet are got, And Eden memories ours, While summer's golden glance is shot Through woodbine-birken bowers! But now the whole air seemed to dance, The glen went whirling round, And falling in a slumbrous trance I lay along the ground. How long in this deep sleep I lay I have not to declare, But when I woke the sky was grey, The birks and larches bare; The maniac wind, that takes no care Whether 'tis glad or grieves, Was scattering in the beamless air Handfuls of autumn leaves. 30th April 1879. THE MEET AT MIDNIGHT. 31st December 1879. They are mustering to-night on the ocean Their legions in mighty force, Their banners in wild commotion, Their trumpets braying hoarse. The billows are scourged into madness By the stroke of their giant wings, And the hollow vault that holds the stars Booms, and bellows, and rings! Would you know why all this gathering Of winds at the midnight hour? —I will tell you anon, but you must know First of their mighty power. They have come from the south, and the eastward, And the fierce north blasts are there; And shoulder to shoulder with rumpled wings, They press till they fill the air! For miles and for miles of the ocean, Shoulder to shoulder they lie, And the long strong sweep of their flanking wings Strikes from sea to sky. You might trace the track they have come by By lighthouses down thrown, And towns with steeples and churches And the sea with wrecks o'erstrewn. And their squadroned strength is greater Than ever yet shook the earth, When she shakes with the mighty anguish Of an earthquake at the birth. But now they are all in motion, And with one continuous shout They sweep in a hurricane up Strathbraan, And blow the Old Year out! For the burden of sin on the Old Year's back As he sways and staggers along, Is as big as the huge earth-globe itself, And needs a wind so strong. Blow, winds from the German Ocean, This burden from the earth!— Sweet rest be yours and the weary world's In the hush of the Young Year's birth! SIMMER LOST: A SIGH FOR SANDIE IN NEW ZEALAND. Hoo sweet were simmer i' the woods, Or doon the burnie clear, —In a' her haunts, in a' her moods,— If, Sandie, you were here. Then doobly graun the wastlin braes Wad glow at gloamin-tide, An' redder wad the mornin' rays Rin up the plantin-side. An' bonnier owre the loch wad creep The dimplin' waves sae sma', An' wins less wantonlie wad sweep The young green leaves awa'. And I should look wi' clearer een Aboot me an' before, An' cease to think o' simmers, been To be again no more. It's simmer yet, an' yet a'most I mourn the simmer gane, An' feel as if its joys were lost Lavisht on me mylane. A GIFT FOR A BRIDE. A gift for my bride on her birthday! —But what shall the souvenir be? What best of all gifts of the earth may Remind her of me? A ring for her delicate finger, To pinch it a little all day? A song in her heart that will linger When I am away? A chain for her neck, with a locket? A book that her mind will engage, And will easily go in her pocket? A bird in a cage? A volume of manuscript verses? A flower in porcelain that blows? A phial of scent that disperses The attar of rose? The frond of a fern, or a feather, Among her fair tresses to twine? A sprig, for her breast, of white heather, Or pale jessamine? A thimble? a bangle? a bonnet? A pencil? a portrait of me? A bracelet with AEI upon it? A crooked bawbee? Now which of them all shall I send her? Indeed I might send her them all, “With care,” “Carriage paid,” “Special tender,” —And think it too small. Suppose I just send her a letter And sign it in silver “Your Own”? —Bah! either I'll manage it better, Or leave it alone! That notion is too mediocre: —Come, Fancy! there's something amiss! —I have it! As I am a smoker, I'll send her a kiss! But how to transmit it! . . . What fairy, Or seraph, or sylph of the air Will come in my present quandary My offering to bear? I'll cleanse my mustache of tobacco, And wait for a wind from the south To take the dear trifle, per Bacco! Direct from my mouth. Receive it, ye breezes! And lest ye Should lose it, or make a misdeal, Take ten or twelve more to attest the Devotion I feel! Your flight is up over yon mountain That looks o'er Strathearn to Strathtay, Then down by the clear caller fountain; —At Craigie you stay. And there, to the mirthfullest lady That ever was sad in the sun, Deliver your trust; but be ready To go when it's done! —And how will ye know when ye've found her? —Her gait, and the grace of her glance, The beauty that brightens around her, Will tell you at once! She's true, and she's kind, and she's clever, And pensive, and not very tall —As high as my heart is, however— And modest withal. And so, unannounced, you'll enfold her; And, ere from your wings she can slip, You'll softly pay down, while you hold her, My tax on her lip. THE CAMP ON THE OCHILS. “Et propinquá luce fulsere signa: . . . et Romanis redit animus: . . . et fuit atrox in ipsis portarum angustiis proelium, donec pulsi hostes.”—Taciti Agricola, xxvi. The gold has paled to silver on the height, The gull belated to the lake has flown; Why sits young Andro in the house to-night While Cæsar hunts in the old camp alone? The goodman's cutting clover in the field, Young Phemie o'er the meadow calls the cow: They've all a task but Cæsar—idle chield! Cæsar stands whining on the whinny knowe. How would his ears go up, his eyes grow clear, The white star on his tail be whisked about, If only Andro's bonnet should appear Above the dike, followed by Andro's shout! What fun you'd see in the old camp! What bounds O'er burrowy mound and boulder, furze and heath! Andro would beat—Cæsar would watch the grounds, His pink tongue palpitating o'er his teeth! Where lingers Andro?—Harvesting the light For one red page beside the kitchen flame: A different Roman is the spell to-night, And Tacitus, not Cæsar, is the name! The page is open where Agricola's camp One daybreak, eighteen centuries ago, Sprang to a man from earth-bed cold and damp At the wild slogan of the Celtic foe. The battle's in the gateways, hand to hand; The sword of Caius rings on Colin's mace; The eagles flash—who can their glance withstand? On them! They yield—the rout becomes a race! How strange it seems,—the ruined camp without, With peaceful rabbits hopping to and fro; Within, the schoolboy glorying in the rout Of his forefathers there so long ago! ADVENTUS VERIS. Spring came to-day! and glad were we As very children in our glee. The sun shone forth with blinding flame, And from the west a soft wind came: The west! Nay, sister, rather say It blew from boyhood's happy day! It brought with it the village old Wherein was passed our age of gold, And I, a happy-hearted scholar With jacket short and broad white collar, Frisked with my classmates in the street: —Ay me! how fast the seasons fleet! Spring came to-day! Our minstrel, mute No longer, tuned and tried his flute; Puss in the window-corner heard, Looked cageward, closed her eyes, and purred; And outside in the open air Sparrows shot whirring here and there; And one old ragged meagre rook Who, feeling beauish, rashly took A sunward voyage, venturing high Was buffeted about the sky. Spring came to-day: she called us out With a right cheery country shout. We spied her through the blackthorn hedge, We saw her in the lakeside sedge, We traced her footsteps o'er the hill, We chased her down the rippling rill, We lost her in a miry lane, But in Craiglockhart copse again We sought the merry gipsy, chiding, And caught her in a hollow hiding. Spring came to-day: the hawthorn buds, The crystal of the Pentland floods, The sword-like sedges by the lake, The red-tipt branches in the brake, The thin clean braird of new-year's grass, Gowans that open as you pass —Their wide-awake fresh fearless eyes Glowering surprised at your surprise— And balmy airs, and skies of blue Convince you that the news is true. We tarried as the sun went down On yon high hill besouth the town, But fairest view, of all we spied, The gardened homes of Morningside. The ploughman half a field away Rested his horses on the brae, Leaned o'er his plough, and on the air Came pattle-raspings of the share; Then overglanced the furrows drawn By his stout greys and him since dawn, Took snuff, clicked with his cheek and tongue, Shook the plough-line and snooved along! How sweet it was to see a star Born in the heavenly blue afar! To mark the slowly waning light, The coy approach of veilèd Night; To see domestic lights appear In villa windows far and near; And hear upon our homeward way The children singing at their play, Their fresh young voices rising sweet Out of the dim suburban street! Spring came to-day: let's dedicate The evening hours to celebrate Her joyous advent, sister mine! —And first, a glass of generous wine; Then fruit; and strew the room with flowers To dull the footfall of the hours; And you will sing when I am mute, And I will choose a tale to suit The sweet occasion—What You Will Or As You Like It: Shakespeare still For every season has a say A mood for every man; And so we'll mark Spring came To-day As well as ever we can! THE LAD OF BENARTY. Happy the man wha belangs to nae party, But sits in his ain hoose an' looks at Benarty. On the dome of the Lomond I lie With my head on a bed of red heather; I see but the clouds and the sky, But whether above me, or whether Below me, I care not a fly Or a feather! Far down in the town there's a din Where the blues are abused by the yellows, For the yellows are likely to win And the blues are resentful and jealous; —I laugh in my sleeve and my skin At the fellows! And happy the chappie, say I, Who sails in the tail of no party: He laughs as he looks to the sky With a laugh that is low down and hearty; Or he sits in his house with his eye On Benarty! PINES AND BOULDER. “The whole creation groaneth and travaileth in pain.” These gloomy pines upon the heath, That in the sunlight sigh— Their secret they will not bequeath, Nor will it with them die. The cold stone they moan around Crusted with lichen grey— It will not waken from its swound Till peals the Judgment-day! A horror of the midnight dark Sleeps in that slumbering stone! A shower of blood-drops on their bark Has made these pine-trees moan! THE TWO FLOWERS. “Learn by a mortal longing to ascend Towards a higher love.” There's a cleft high up on the bare hillside That looks like a fairy bower; The prospect is fair and far and wide, And the fairy is a flower. —Why do you nod, little one, up there At your watch-tower window so high?— I like to feel the caressing air, And I love to be near the sky! There's a mossy cell in a sunken vale In the depths of a forest dim Where a tiny flower is hiding pale, Her eyes with tears o'erswim. —Why do you shrink, little one, down there In your sunless nunnerie?— I fear he will kiss me, the wandering air, And the big sky frightens me! IN THE KNOCK-WOOD. Come up and hear the pine-trees sigh! Come up within their shade, and lie And let the peace which they impart Sink soothingly within your heart. The sigh they send from every leaf Breathes resignation and relief; If there's a sadness in the tone, You put it there yourself alone! Each in its own allotted place Lifts as it were to Heaven its face, The while it stretches out the hand Of friendship to the forest band. Here are no jarrings and no jeers, No fevered haste, no vexing fears, No envious wish that will not wait, No jealous blasphemy of Fate. There's pathos in the patient air With which their annual wrong they bear, —Forgetful of the winter's blast And glad the summer's come at last. A placid pensiveness pervades The mighty mountain-forest shades, —A pensiveness that has no fear, No shame, of past or future year. Come, plunge you in their solitude; The bath will prove a double good —A Styx for strength, for sinful pain A Lethe to the sleepless brain. THE LIGHT ON THE HILLSIDE. “You see it gleaming far up the height, Yon little square patch of warm red light? —It's a far way up, but it's full in my sight, And I lodge within its warmth to-night. Around it the mists of the mountain are curled, Above it the Night like a flag is unfurled, But it shines like Milton's pendent World With the bluster of Chaos against it hurled! It's only a simple shepherd's cot; But there isn't in all the earth a spot Where half so hearty a welcome is got, —And that's the charm of home, is it not? Within, my father is dozing through tire, My mother is plying the twinkling wire, Between them stands in front of the fire A chair that encloses my heart's desire. Its back ascends an enormous height, Its arms stretch outward to left and right, And it's clothed from top to bottom quite In a clean chintz wrapper of blue and white. But many wet bushes the winds will toss Against my cheek; and one long moss, And braes and brooks, I must climb and cross, Ere I cover the miles between it and Kinross. —Good night, fellow-student! Good night, good night! A couple of hours will see me all right: Think of me then in my chair on the height, Think of me then—and you'll envy me quite!” How strangely his voice at parting thrilled! —Well, the night wore by, and the storm was stilled, And morning dawned; but the Fates had willed That chair on the mountain should never be filled! HEIGH-HO! THE WIND AND THE RAIN! Day had come without dawning, The street was deserted and still, At the mill-door the miller stood yawning With his back to the hum of the mill. We drove past the mill with a clatter, And out on the wind-swept plain, And then down came, whole water, In gleaming sheets the rain. The road struck up the mountains Suddenly ere we wist, We heard the gushing of fountains And the wail of mews in the mist. At times through the grey fog stealing Swept columns of ghostly pines, Behind us they seemed to be wheeling And forming in squares and lines. And once far up at a turning Where a loch feeds a hundred rills, We were ushered without warning Into a conclave of hills. Like hooded monks before us They loomed through mist and rain: The swirling mists closed o'er us And they were lost again. Splish! splash! on the flat of the mountain Stumbles our jaded beast; The jolts are past all counting, And the rain has never ceased! For dull monotonous mileage The hills in a mist have the palm: —I wish I were back in the village, Or sound asleep where I am. Y? FATE OF Y? BOOK. I wrote a book; and, what was worse, I wrote the whole of it in verse. Then upspoke an evil elf —“Be a credit to yourself!” So I printed it, and sent it forth West, and east, and south, and north. Just as it left my hand I woke, And the elfin spell that bound me broke; And I wished as I saw it o'erfly the land That I had it back again in my hand; But the elf laughed loud with malicious glee —“It may not be, and it may not be! The cage is empty, the bird is free!”— And his mocking came back on the winds to me. Then came forth the critic men With sharp nose and sharper pen; They flung their long fingers into the sky And caught the book as it fluttered by; And it shook like the wings of a captured bird, And then, like a dead thing, hung; nor stirred As they bore it off with a strange dark smile. But my heart was beating fast all the while. From the free fresh air to a sunless gloom They hurried it into a secret room: The door swung back with a boding boom, “And here,” they said, “we will write your doom.” They pierced and probed it with their pens, Examined it with a powerful lens, And up and down they viewed and reviewed, Till the good was bad and the bad was good, Till white was black, and B was A; —But they used my book in a frightful way; For its wings they broke and its back they bent, And rumpled its feathers to their hearts' content. They then sat down at two long tables, Dipt into ink, and wrote out labels; The while, most piteous to be seen, My book lay ruined and wrecked between, And meekly bore the dissecting glances That stung my heart like a shower of lances. At last one rose at the right-hand table And read aloud from the written label— “Though he may not have an eagle's pinion, Yet the upper air is his dominion.” “And so say I, and I've written it so,” Said Number Two; “he has wings of snow; My judgment is that a swan is he.” “A swan!” from the left hissed Number Three, “A swan!—I've a different tale to tell: He's a gosling; I know the bird right well!” Said a Fourth, with a head like a downy owl, “It's a very ordinary barn-door fowl: A useful creature, no doubt, in its place; But a cackler! Dixi—that is, it's the case!” “I agree so far with Number Four,” Said Number Five, “as the barn-door: But I made an inspection nice and narrow And I pledge my ears the bird's a sparrow! —And where's the critic will gainsay That pledge of mine goes a good long way?” Out to the centre stalked Number Six: “Your various verdicts I must mix; He's a bird has caught the various tone Of other birds, but has none of his own. It's a great pity, too, for he imitates well; But all that he has he got outside his shell —You know what I mean—he belongs to the breed That pick up their song as they pick up their seed. —I may add in your ear, but don't let it be known, He has plagiarised from a bird of my own!” “Yah! yah!” they all yelled, “it's a very good lark That bird of your own: you were best keep it dark!” Uprose Number Seven. He, staggering, rose; And I will not do more than refer to his nose: “My masters”—he spoke rather thick—“are you blind? I've examined him—hic!—and what do I find? —He has wings that will soar with the best we have had; But I hate him for all: at his best he is bad!” Upspoke Number Eight, while he tore what he wrote,— “I think him a bird of original note, But I cannot be sure; so let's damn him as dunce; He ought to come out more decided at once. If he isn't a dunce I'm a Dutchman? So be it! If he is—you will own I'm sagacious to see it!” Scarce two agreed, till they fell on a plan Which seemed to please them every man— At least the hubbub ceased: they took And hung their verdicts round my book Like flags of all nations on a wreck, Or labels on a phial's neck Which each describes the draught to be Sherry, laudanum, cold beef-tea. They dragged it then to the door of their den And gave it to the air again. And away like a guilty thing it flew, That thinks it a crime to live, to you; And you took off the labels and stroked its wing, And my poor book looked like another thing. And now it was plain they all had erred In naming it that and the other bird, For it grew in the keep of those I love A homely plain domestic dove. THE FIFTEENTH OF AUGUST. Now, while above heaven's windows dim and darken, And shadows shoot and grow, And the wild peaks of rocky Thelemarken Blacken the evening glow,— My thoughts come back from roaming o'er far places, Like sea-birds to their isle; And here in Norway bonnie Scottish faces Look through the gloom, and smile. I know them all: it is a birthday meeting, And she, the birthday Queen, Looks round as she receives each kindly greeting For one, who is not seen. There's mirth, and music, and the chink of glasses, Laughter, and lights, and flowers; —And so they pelt with roses, as he passes, Time, and his train of hours. The lights are out at last, the guests departed, Yet, lingering near the gate, There's one, I know, is listening gentle-hearted, Although the night be late. She feels almost a lover's kind caresses, Hears his approaching feet: —'Tis but the night wind in her wavy tresses, Or blowing down the street. Retire, sweet lass! in vain you look and hearken For steps that are not near; His path is through the wilds of Thelemarken, Whose voice you think you hear. The vision fades—fade all the much-loved faces, Fade Perth, Kinnoull, and Tay; And unfamiliar outlines fill their places And gloom athwart my way. I hear but in the wood the torrent calling In tones that come and go, I feel but from the feels a silence falling Into the vand below. And now above heaven's windows fairly darken, And earth is black and drear: —And what do I afar in Thelemarken From all my heart holds dear? WORKING AND IDLING. While some attempt the task on stirks, And some on mules or asses, The man, that best could do it, shirks The gallop up Parnassus. His Pegasus unsaddled feeds Beside him in a hollow, Close by the rocky path that leads Up to thy heights, Apollo! And idling in the shade he lurks, While they tug at their bridles; They well may call their efforts Works; And what are his but Idyls? BLOOMTIME: A SONG. My life is in its bloomtime, And faded sisters say— “We've all our summer sometime, She need not look so gay.” But oh! the wild young fellows, They compliment one so! And then, to have them jealous —It's more than praise, you know! A DITHYRAMB. I. Lift up your voices in fraternal chorus, All ye who share The joyous spirit of the poet, Wheresoe'er In the four corners of the earth ye dwell! —Lift up your voices! Tell Its owners earth is fair! Sing! Shout aloud, and show it! Sing! for the earth is fair! The same blue heaven is bending o'er us, The same green earth extends before us, And heaven is kind and earth is fair —But mankind do not know it! Lift up your voices Till the world rejoices And knows that earth is fair! II. What though we stand in sundered lands And sing in several voices? The brotherhood has many bands, But with one heart rejoices. III. From the same Father-God we came, To the same Father-God we go; Our hopes above are all the same, —The same our griefs below, Our sadness! IV. Sing! till the night of sorrow Is frightened from the land! Give into every hand The torch of gladness! —Gladness is a flame Increasing if you lend or if you borrow— And cry aloud! proclaim At midnight everywhere Good morrow! and good morrow! Till timorous souls leap from their hidings And know that earth is fair!— Lift up your voices Till the world rejoices! Sing! till the surging air Beats on the battlements of heaven the tidings That man rejoices for the earth is fair! COMPOSING A SONNET. I Composing a sonnet 'S like kindling a fire: Heap largely upon it —The spark will expire! II Your very best “chance” is To coax it with rhyme, Then try it with fancies —A touch at a time. III Now lay the lines lightly, Keep blowing between, And soon it will brightly Seize all the fourteen! DAVID. He sits above the mists of Time, Above the poet throng; He sits on morning heights sublime The king of choral song. All lesser bards on lower heights Fall at his feet their lyres, Unknown to them his high delights —Unfelt his far desires! They sing of mortal grief and mirth In measures sweet to hear: His song ambitious spurning earth Makes for Jehovah's ear! He soars unmated and alone Into eternal day, The angel-host around the throne Clear for his wing a way! The Sons of Morning left behind Cease after him to sing, Not theirs that fervour of the mind That fury of the wing! The burning offering of his praise To heaven himself bears he, And with impetuous ardour lays Even on Jehovah's knee! No seraph's fear his soul can tame, Nor cherub overawed; To him with first and foremost claim Jehovah is a God! The universe through all its bounds Is but a means of praise, An orchestra of many sounds Concerting with his lays! Hark, how to his conducting rod He calls creation's train To hymn the praises of his God, And swell his choral strain! PSALM CXLVIII. Praise we the Lord! Begin, ye matchless creatures, The first-born of His might, Circling His glory till your young-God features Absorb the eternal Light! Take up the song, ye Seraphim! Prolong, Ye Cherubim, the pæan! Drown with His praise, ye meaner angel-throng, The echoing Empyrean! Praise Him, thou vast of space, that, like an ocean, The eternal heavens between And the mysterious maze of starry motion, Stretchest afar serene! Praise Him, ye Powers, that occupy with light Creation's outer porches, Fronting the chaos of primeval Night With the eternal torches! Praise Him, thou Sun, that from the flames of Morning Upleapest crowned with light! Praise Him, thou Moon, retiring and returning To shepherdess the night! Praise Him, ye wanderers of the Milky Way! Ye whispering Constellations! Ye Comets! and ye Meteor Stars that stray To unknown destinations! Awake, thou Earth! and wake thy slumbering legions, And shout aloud, and show The challenge of the Everlasting Regions Is answered from below! Praise Him, ye Winds, that sweep the deep sublime! Ye lower Seas and Surges! Praise Him, ye Thunders of the torrid clime! Praise Him, ye Polar Scourges! Praise Him, ye Clouds, ye stately sailing Fountains! Ye Cataracts and ye Rills! Ye floating Icebergs and ye burning Mountains! Ye Deserts and ye Hills! Praise Him, ye Earthquakes, from your secret mines! Ye rushing Avalanches! Praise Him, ye congregated Palms, ye Pines! —Forests with all your branches! Praise Him, ye Camels and ye Flocks domestic, That whiten the green plain! Praise Him, thou Terror of the Woods, majestic With turbulence of mane! Praise Him, ye Herds upon a thousand hills! Ye Colts, without a rider, That drink the freedom of the desert rills, Praise Him, the All-provider! Praise Him, thou Eagle, from thy pinions flinging A twilight o'er the sea! Praise Him, ye Doves! Praise Him, ye Swallows, winging O'er isles and oceans free! Praise Him, ye Sons of Eve, of all estates, Kindreds, and tongues, and nations! Praise Him, ye Kings, ye sceptred Potentates! Ye Priests, with heart oblations! Praise Him on chord, and reed, and with your voices, All peoples, maids, and men! Praise Him together, while the heaven rejoices Answering the earth again! Praise Him alone, for He alone is great Beyond all mark and measure; And we are but His handiwork, who wait Well pleased upon His pleasure! OUR MARY: HER FATE. This was Mary twenty years ago— Mary then was four from twenty, Mary then was gimp and genty, Mary then had beaux a-plenty, Rosy cheeks and brow of snow; Like a fairy Was our Mary Twenty years ago. This was Mary nineteen years ago— Mary then was meek and modest, Neatly ankled, shapely bodiced, By the village poets goddessed, Classed with Dame Demeter's Oe; Like an airy Sylph was Mary Nineteen years ago. This was Mary eighteen years ago— Mary properly deported, Chastely with her sisters sported, Would not kiss though she was courted, Coaxed by many a downy beau; Wise and wary Was our Mary Eighteen years ago. This was Mary seventeen years ago— When the lads their longing uttered Nothing in her bosom fluttered, And she neither stayed nor stuttered When she simply said them No! —Feeling nary Had our Mary Seventeen years ago! This was Mary sixteen years ago— When the men their custom carried Off to other marts, and married, Though it tested those that tarried, Mary her ain gate would go; Veer nor vary Would our Mary Sixteen years ago. This was Mary fifteen years ago— It was at a Christmas party That the spinsters at écarté Leapt up, startled by a hearty Smack beneath the misletoe; “Did he?—dare he?” “Yes!” said Mary Fifteen years ago! RETURN TO EDINBURGH AFTER THE HOLIDAYS. An' noo, fareweel to hills an' braes, To wuds an' watters broon! We've pairtit wi' the holidays —They're aff! they're fairly flewn! An' we, wi' torn an' suddled claes, An' tired fra cuit to croon, Wi' scartit hauns an' blistered taes, Are hirplin' back to toon! Like laddies, ill for an excuse For havin' played the tru'n, We're comin' in a kind o' daze, An' dummies every loon! The ne'er a lauch hae we to raise To hud oor hearts aboon; —E'enoo we'd raither dee nor praise Oor ain pedantic Toon! SONNETS APRIL. Yonder comes April, on her lip a smile And in her eye a tear! She has the look Of one whose face is as an open book Yet thinks her harmless secret safe the while. Her half-aversion is a childish wile To win a welcome from you; in the nook Of the sweet eye a tear has just forsook Lurks a blue ring that would a saint beguile! —How shall we welcome her? Why, as a child Returning from a ramble, half afraid Her absence may have vexed her mother mild, While through the pathless woods alone she strayed; And waiting till her father once has smiled And spread his arms and called his little maid. NIGHT. Night lifts her shadowy arms above the earth, And breathes a benediction o'er the town; And eyes are closed, and aching heads go down, And silence sits by the forsaken hearth. And now in dreams to pale neglected Worth Come recognition and a cool green crown, And these have friends for every waking frown And those for every misery now have mirth. O blessèd sleep! that like a curtain nightly Drops on this tragi-comedy of man. And blessèd, too, ye heaven-sent dreams, that rightly Transform the piece to the original plan. But best the buskined close—however lightly Hope slipped the sock on when the play began! A BACK-LYING FARM. The first part of this sonnet, which has already appeared in the author's earlier volume of poems, is here reproduced as an introduction to its second part. I. [A back-lying farm but lately taken in; Forlorn hill-slopes and grey, without a tree; And at their base a waste of stony lea Through which there creeps, too small to make a din, Even where it slides over a rocky linn, A stream, unvisited of bird or bee, Its flowerless banks a bare sad sight to see. All round, with ceaseless plaint, though spent and thin, Like a lost child far-wandered from its home, A querulous wind all day doth coldly roam. Yet here, with sweet calm face, tending a cow, Upon a rock a girl bareheaded sat Singing unheard, while with unlifted brow She twined the long wan grasses in her hat.] II. So sat the maiden: to the outward eye The flower-like genius of a flowerless waste, Dropped from the hand of Providence in haste And left neglected here to wane and die. —And yet, who knows what youthful fancies, ay, What heavenly visitants descending graced That lonely life, and with bright dreams displaced The cloudy terrors of the natural sky? Heaven lies about us in our infancy, And heaven is not a thing of sight or sense; Here on this desolate flower-forsaken lea It opens to the eyes of innocence: There is an Eden for us all, till we Let in a devil who straightway drives us thence. “THY WILL BE DONE.” A Painting by Sir Noel Paton. I.—THE PAINTING. “No earthly beauty shines in him, To draw the carnal eye.” 'Twas in the painter's choice: he might have framed A figure more commanding, and a face Earthlier fairer and of finer grace, And none that loves the Saviour would have blamed. But wiser he: so should a form that aimed At drawing all men to him take a place No ways superior to the common race, In proof he was not of their state ashamed. And so—no hero, cased as if in mail With adventitious halo of romance; No strong-built athlete, never known to ail, Proud of his strength, defiant in his glance; But looking as if liable to fail, With nothing to commend him or enhance. II.—TO THE PAINTER. Creator of The Christ! when first I stood Before thy handiwork, and overawed Beheld the mystery of the Son of God Sinless yet suffering in the midnight wood, Suffering, and yet to suffering quite subdued, How could I think of thee? how could I laud The power that pained me so? or how applaud In presence of that brow with blood bedewed? And yet I owe a dearer debt to thee Than I have paid to any: there will rise Within my memory Paul; yet even he, The great Apostle, failed to realise As thou hast done, for thou hast made me see The Christ in Scotland with my actual eyes! Great Painter! unto thee the awful dower Of genius has been given to dare and do,— To image Deity in pain, pursue The image into act, hour after hour, And bid it live! I tremble for the power, God-lent and (surely for great ends) to few, That thus creates the agony anew Which God hid in Gethsemanë's dark bower! —For they will come, the idle and the rude, And these will praise thy skill, and those will blame; And some, indulgent of a prying mood, Will stand and stare, departing as they came; And thou wilt seem, thy work misunderstood, In these to put the Lord to open shame! TENANTLESS. A level waste, where sheep are starving drear, And lapwings breed, and sapless windle-straws, Weakly submissive to the gusty flaws, For ever round the waste forlornly veer,— In midst whereof, most desolate, appear Four grey walls round an empty house: you pause As you pass by, and ask what fool he was That built, and brought his household darlings, here? No pathway through the waste leads to the door That fronts the snow-cold hills; the lake between, When, as to-day, a north wind's blowing keen, Sends to the very doorstep, cold and hoar, Patches of flying foam:—a dreary scene! Thank heaven! to be lived in by child no more! ON GRANTON PIER. Well, this is what I saw on Granton pier: In front, the Firth!—“Oh, that is nothing new!” Ay, but you never saw a bonnier blue Than its glad waters wore; the day was clear, And—you may laugh—to me they seemed to rear Their waves in actual joy! Now, this is true— One of the waves took wings, became a mew, And sunward rose upon a new career! Across the Firth I saw the coast of Fife With here a cliff and there a nestling town; And here and there the hillsides showed the strife Of April green contesting winter brown; And eastward far the horizon's edge was rife With clean white sails that rose and sank adown. ON LOMOND HILL. The top at last! . . . All hail, celestial blue! Mother of Freedom, where the winds are nurst And the clouds fly, and sunbeams through them burst, Gilding this old earth till it shines anew! From thy broad bosom also drops the dew As duly on the grass as at the first Ere storms were known, and the green earth was curst, And Man from Nature within walls withdrew. —Yonder, far o'er the Firth, what smoky blot Stains the pure ether? Ah! I know it: there The Town-Witch, crooning o'er her seething-pot, Compounds and brews for man infernal fare! Thee and thy stews, black Witch! from this high spot I solemnly for one whole week forswear! TWO SONNETS IN DEFENCE OF SONG. I. MORNING. Loose beechen leaves above me; over which, The cupola of heaven—so still and bright, With the sun dreaming in a far high niche, You think it never can again be night. Nature at rest. The only sounds that reach The listening ear are Labour's, and are light— Rustlings among the oats, the reaper's speech, And the mill-hum of a small town in sight. Afield and in the factory they work, Those at the loom, and these among the corn; While I, the only idler, seem to shirk The duty laid on every one that's born, And, lapt in leaves, among the beeches lurk, A spy upon my fellows all the morn. II. EVENING. But evening comes: the sounds of Labour cease, And weary workers from their toil return; Domestic lights in cottage windows burn, And sundered families unite in peace. Now what shall smooth with gentle hand the crease Of furrowed brow and ruffled heart outworn, Strengthen for the recurring toils of morn, And wrap the spirit in the robes of peace? —Song! which the poet, idling, as ye said, Gathered fresh-fallen from the morning skies. Song! which he wove, and dipped in rainbow dyes When ye cried Out upon him, Lazyhead! Song! that both feeds and clothes, and far outvies Your factory fabrics and your oaten bread! BERRY-HILL. We stand upon the Ochils in the air Of a September eve; great fleecy clouds, Like sheep new-washen, circle earth in crowds, But all the cupola is blue and bare. Here, on the right, our Lomond towers; and there, Far to the west, from a pale smoke that shrouds Its base, Ben Lomond; and the heaven is bowed Serenely o'er us, resting on the pair.— It is a dutiful delight to flee At times the sorcery of the sordid town, To shake the mind from all vexations free, To know on hill-tops Heaven without frown, And feel like children looking up to see Their parents at a window smiling down! A HUMOUR OF THE LINKS. He drops in dapper dress upon the ground,— White cuffs, and sleeve-links glancing in the sun, —A demd fine morning!—this at half-past one,— And with three caddies enters on a round. He hits the turf; the ball with oblique bound Flees to the onlookers, who duck and run, And running fall, and falling yell What fun! While he calls Fore!—and wonders when 'tis found. Six balls he loses, breaks three clubs, a cleek, And, putting, makes an unexpected drive Which lames a boy and cuts a golfer's cheek, And so ends round the first at half-past five— Seven holes in ninety strokes!—I would not seek To wrong a living man: the man's alive! LOCHLEVEN IN NOVEMBER. Morning succeeded morning o'er the Lake All through the spring, and never once a pair Came quite the same, and yet the Lake was fair And kept the lengthening charm without a break. And surely now (thought I) no power will take Her beauty from the Naiad; none will dare To give the honour to the earth or air, But all will praise it for her own dear sake. —Well, one November morning, dazed and deaved With the dull round of the professional wheel, I left the city, and stole unperceived Upon my Naiad ere the morning meal: She looked up hastily, surprised and grieved, Like a proud beauty caught in deshabille! THE LAWN-ADONIS. Lawn-tennis and the Ladies—give him these: Misses, with rosebud mouths, and creamy cheeks Spread thinly with a smile that lasts for weeks: And leave the silken Sybarite to his ease. No other paradise so well could please, No other paradise the spaniel seeks; That smirk of well-fed satisfaction speaks A life content with what it sucks and sees. —You sneer, Major! The sneer upon your lip'll Only bring pouts, my gallant god of war! What! to his ruby mouth deny the nipple, And smirch his pearls with porter and cigar, To whom the smell of small beer's a strong tipple And Polson's paste a food too solid far? [A great man dies, or whom the world calls great] “Nec vixit male, qui natus moriensque fefellit.” —Horace, Epist. xvii. A great man dies, or whom the world calls great —And, I've observed, the world will scarce allow One leaf of laurel to your living brow Though it grows lavish when you lie in state: This for your comfort,—well, he's dead! and, straight, A kite sits on the shroud; but whence or how The carrion came you cannot guess; and now It claims with yellow beak and claw its bait. Faugh! 'Tis enough to make the dead upstart, To be so near a living grave, and smell it! Happy the man who takes the final dart And drops among the grass with none to tell it, Who quietly through life has done his part, And, to quote Horace, moriens fefellit! OLD AGE—THE WRESTLER. Seems but as yesterday that I was young, Inhaled the fever of the war of life, Made eager preparations for the strife, And with the joy of a strong gymnast flung My soul into the contest: swayed and swung This way and that I reeled; yet joys were rife,— Home, and the smile of friends, the love of wife, And Hopes that flew above my head and sung. But, as I wrestled, woe, alas! my pride Of youthful strength received a fall from One Who came upon me with a hasty stride And threw me heavily: broken, undone, I rose and to a corner limped aside, And lo, far down the west had sunk my sun! WINTER'S PALE MARTYR. Here, in the social city, by the hearth, This winter midnight, in an easy-chair, While the flames bicker on the bars, and flare, And a wild east wind blowing up the Firth Shouts down the chimney in its boisterous mirth, Put on your hat and face me if you dare— I think me of a hillside lone and bare Far up among the Ochil Hills of Perth. How piteously it waited for the spring With a cold snow-drop sickening in its hand! How patiently it waited for the wing, That never came, of summer in the land! And now it stands in snow-shirt shivering, Winter's pale martyr, meekly at command! “A BARBARY HEN.” See Shakespeare's As You Like It. Whither have fled his gamesomeness and glee, His rosy gills, his laughter, and his jinks, The sparkle of his eyes between the winks, And all the merriment we used to see? There is not now a duller man than he: At festive times he sits alone and thinks, Drains glass on glass, and still the more he drinks The less inclined to smile he seems to be. And now, what power in what fell hour did snatch The mirth we may not hope to see again? —They say it went for money in a match That gave him with the gold a Barbary Hen! —Proves the old proverb, Tom! the maddest bach- Elors make still the saddest married men! NORWEGIAN SONNETS To Norroway, to Norroway, To Norroway owre the faem! —Old Ballad. I. BALDER BACK! Facing the North, in the grey sea he stands. The solar orb comes northward, sliding slow, And—empties on him its solstitial glow! Blinks up at last with tear-bewildered glands The puzzled jotun: Giant. from his rough red hands Slip the huge balls of hard compacted snow That in his wrath enraged he meant to throw, And where they melt, behold! a brace of vands. Lakes. Meanwhile the blinding tears run down his cheeks, Like torrents swollen with sudden summer rain; In vain deep-knuckling in his eyes he seeks To clear his sight—the cataracts burst amain; Till, at the last, he gets a peep, and speaks —It's you, Balder! So you've got back again! II. UP THE SKAGER RACK. It was the point of dawn; and in the bow I stood alone, facing the grey north-east. Far on the left, like a huge brown sea-beast That had been chased and was o'ertaken now, Surprised asleep, lay Norway. From the prow A hissing of salt spray that still increased Rose plainly audible—for the gale had ceased And the keel cut the sea-plain like a plough. And so with only a ripple on the sea, And ne'er a storm-cloud o'er us muttering black, We voyaged with an easy course and free And—disappointing, now on looking back; For the old sagas make the surges flee Like riderless horses up the Skager Rack. III. WELCOME! Was it the filial instinct of a child Yearning to visit the ancestral home That drove me o'er the furrows and the foam To Norway northward of the ocean wild? Meseemed at least from fell on fell up-piled Streamed voices—Now at last, though late, ye come; Here is your parent land, no longer roam: And the scenes grew familiar all, and smiled. But who was he, this worshipper of Thor? Or, likelier, Odin would the genius suit Of a bold-cruising Viking ancestor— Some scale-mailed Eric, or chain-shirted Knut! —Vainly I questioned welcoming breeze and torr, Hill. The winds were silent now, the mountains mute! IV. THAT SPEAR. We parted with the Times at Guldsmedmo'n, Yet two days longer up the dale the hum Of European politics would come— But sunk, and sinking, to an undertone. At last we entered a deep dell o'ergrown With ancient pines of lofty stature—some An hundred feet—and Europe's voice was dumb, And we now fairly found ourselves alone. Silence, and gloom, and isolation drear Produced a feeling, hard to understand, Which grew at last a dim-embodied fear As of a Spirit, gloomy, silent, grand, That rose from out the wood, and drew a-near, Grasping a pine-spear in his rebel hand! V. MILTON IN NORWAY. The feeling passed, the Spirit passed away —The silence and the isolation drear, As broke in fitful bursts on Fancy's ear A gravely measured yet melodious lay. Wider the sweep, and more complete the sway, And longer, deeper, louder, and more clear, Until I cried—Milton is monarch here, Whatever Oscar and his subjects say! —How had the Master slung into his song The pride of Norway, with an arm as free As fierce Alcides' when he hurled along The ether from Mount Œta to the sea, Nerved with the strength of that Thessalian wrong, The groaning trunk of many an uptorn tree! VI. THE SCENERY—GO AND SEE IT! And speak ye may of grandeur and of gloom And all the dread magnificence that lies Where through the dale the foam-fleckt torrent flies, Or gorgeous sunsets o'er the mountains bloom. But who shall in the sonnet's scanty room Set the majestic magnitude, the size, The mighty mountains and the widening skies Up on Norwegian table-lands assume? This you must see to feel within your heart, And cannot know from others: Nature still In this defies all imitative art, Baffles all schools and soars beyond their skill: It is a joy she only shall impart, But, once received, it ne'er can cease to thrill. VII. A TERROR OF THE TWILIGHT. Far in Norwegian solitudes we strayed: Behind us lay a long bright summer day, But evening now was stooping o'er our way, When, at a sudden turn, alarmed we stayed. It was a terror by the twilight made Of river, cliff, and cloud, and the weird play Of sunset's one live liberated ray Piercing the horror of the pinewood shade. Stood, like a charred cross, or a huge sword-hilt, Against the sky, above the cliff's black line, That seemed a bastion by Harfager built, A solitary thunder-blasted pine; On the dark flood below, the sunset spilt What now was blood and now was wassail-wine. VIII. A WATERFALL WITHIN A WOOD. The sound, that seemed at sunrise—when the glow Of Morning, mingling with the early breeze, Caught the still water through the lakeside trees— The Voice of Liberty, now seems to grow The muffled moan of an imprisoned woe; And Fancy, peering through the forest, sees An agonising Samson on his knees, With the pines looking on and whispering low. How does a noise, monotonous and rude, Take tone, when blown into a poet mind, Concording with the mystery of its mood, And suiting with the symphony it designed! —'Tis but a waterfall within a wood To Peter Bell and others of his kind. IX. MINERVA IN THE SÆTERSDAL. We said Far Vel to Frœsnæs at the dawn— Leaving it as one leaves a treasure, soon To long for it, and call it prize and boon In words, sincere no doubt, but overdrawn. Then on we raced as gamesome as the fawn Though not so graceful, till mid-afternoon Brought us to Hellé to the skydsstation Pronounced shûs-stash??n—the posting-station. Under a cliff behind a natural lawn. Here in a squalid room we look for ease, Loath to sit down, but yet too tired to stand, And call for black-cock, bacon, bread and cheese —In short, whate'er their larder might command: Enters Minerva, kilted to the knees, With a vast shield of fladbröd in her hand! X. THE LITTLE MEAL-MILL. Perched on its four grey cairns across the stream That tumbles down the cliff, secure it stands; An old possession, for on plank and beam Are Knuts and Olës carved by various hands. Its cubic measure, six by five by four; Yet in this compass, everything complete; And there he bent—his back was towards the door— While plashed the mill-wheel merrily at his feet, And ground his rye, and sang with honest glee. —Be mine the knowledge that I now possess, And mine a heart, like his, of envy free, And I could don to-day the sæter A sæter is a farm: the sæter dress, the dress of the peasants of the Sætersdal. dress, And bring my wishes docile to my will To moil content in this Norwegian mill. XI. THE CLIMB FROM VALLË. Steep was the climb from Vallë: far below The sæter we had left lay lost in mist, And still the height rose higher than we wist Beyond the ravings of the Otteraa. Pronounced Ottero. And now a thin bleak air began to blow, And now the bispevei Bridle-path. to turn and twist, Here round a tjern Mountain lake, tarn. no summer ever kissed, And there behind a hide of hoarded snow. The stars dissolved anon; and airy trills Of wavering music showed the day begun: We toiled to meet the morn—o'er rocks, o'er rills; And, breathless, but at last our wish we won— The top! and lo, a countless herd of hills Tossing their shining muzzles in the sun! XII. “PAA HEJA:” LIFE ON THE HEIGHTS. Is there a pleasure can with this compare?— To leap at sunrise from your mountain-bed, Roused by a skylark revelling overhead, And drink great draughts of golden morning air; A plunge, and breakfast—simple rural fare; Then forth with vigorous brain, elastic tread, Hope singing at your heart o'er sorrow dead, And strength for fifty miles, and still to spare! That joy was ours!—O memory! oft restore us Those autumn runs, here in the smoky town, When through the woods our mad nomadic chorus Rang freedom up and civilisation down! Io! my hearts! the world was all before us, And we nor owned nor envied king nor crown! XIII. THE MOUNTAIN LAUREATE. Morning is flashing from a glorious sun On the broad shoulders of the giant fells That outreach arms across the narrow dells And form a silent brotherhood of one Listening their skylark laureate! New begun He up the heavens in ever-rising swells Carries their thanksgiving in song that wells From his small breast as if 'twould ne'er be done. What life his music gives them! They are free In the wild freedom of his daring wing; And in the cataract of his song, the sea Of poetry that fills all heaven, they sing; —He is their poet-prophet in his glee, And in his work and worth their priest and king! XIV. A THOUGHT OF HOME. She walks where Callerfountain to Kinnoull Looks lovingly across the twists of Tay, And oft, along the zigzag of her way, Up Craigie burn, or through the plantains cool, Stoops, from the bank beside the shaded pool To pluck forget-me-nots, or from the brae A gowan, with whose petals she will play, Filling her breast of love's distractions full. Fair are the Scottish hills around her here, Nor fairer scenes a wandering eye beheld, But now in all the glory of the year To her their beauty is a dream of eld, And Norway's distant hills have grown more dear —For sake of one far up the Dovrefeld. XV. MORNING—THE MOUNTAIN FAMILY AT THEIR DEVOTIONS. I see across the lofty table-lands A hundred regal mountains at the least Inclining mutely towards the opening East,— As many little tjerns and queenly vands Kneeling at different levels: Phœbus stands Beaming benevolence like a great High Priest Blessing a nation for some holy feast At his wide temple-door with lifted hands.— Rejoice, ye hills! ye happy mountains, fling Your arms aloft in worship wildly free! Ye vands, and rivers in the valleys, sing! Shout! till the heavens ring with your choral glee; And God Himself with mild face wondering Looks out at last, and smiles well-pleased to see! XVI. A CANDIDATE FOR HONOURS. This were a spectacle to cleanse the heart Of all the mean vexations of the town, The envious slander and the jealous frown, And all remembrances that make it smart. Phœbus Apollo! fit another dart And shoot the last surviving meanness down Ere on my head thou place the golden crown And teach my lyre the mystery of thine art! Then, with a bosom purified of hate And rankling cares and cankers reared of wrong, Envy forgotten and the low debate That to unworthy rivalry belong, On thine own heights, Apollo, will I wait A shriven candidate of holy song! XVII. “THE LAST INFIRMITY.” The god!—or else a fierce consuming flame! Spare me, Apollo of the burning brow! Spare me! It was a rash novitiate's vow When to thy shrine with shameful haste I came And vowed, alas! with an unworthy aim, To be a priest of thine: forgive me now And let me go, or take me where I bow And purge me of that lust of earthly fame! —Thus, like a weed that woos the summer sun To wither in the fierceness of his glance, The ignoble wish that I had told to none And scarcely to myself, by sweet mischance, Seeking to honour it, was clean undone, Pierced by Apollo's keen detecting lance. XVIII. HARVEST IN THE DALE. A million fields to-day are standing white Over the north of Europe: here is one, And three bright sickles circling in the sun Will have the little crop cut down ere night. The girl is singing, for her heart is light; But the two brothers think it best to shun The guise of gladness till the work be done And they have earned a reason and a right; Yet they are glad: God of the bounteous Year, What pleasure must be Thine to look from heaven Into a thousand happy dales, and hear From out the barren rocks, where man has striven, The voices of Thy children far and near Rejoicing in the gifts which Thou hast given! XIX. ARTHUR'S SEAT AGAIN! Fjord, wood, and waterfall, and cliff whose line Rose level with the heavens, and the long swell Of fell up-reaching arm to brother fell, And the lone aspiration of the pine That stood erect on sunset heights divine Under the gaze of God in holy spell, While on the slope, or from the sunken dell, Aspens looked up and trembled—these were mine; And I had grown familiar with them till They seemed a patrimony all my own; And yet when Arthur's green and rounded hill Met my returning gaze, and seaward blown A Scottish voice came floating—closer still Was Scotland at my heart than I had known. XX. A GREY MORNING AT GRANTON. “How bright it is to-day! we see across The Firth quite clearly to the shores of Fife!” —Good heavens! And yet 'twere pity of my life (Thought I, while travelling northward to Kinross) If I should count as worse to me than loss My fellow-creature's gain. Yet was the strife 'Twixt scorn and pity for the grey-worn wife, Thankful for nothing as it seemed, a toss. For I had been where skies of brilliant hue Soared o'er gigantic cliffs to heaven itself, Where the delighted eye for miles looked thro' Opaline widths of air, and aa Water; pronounced o. and elv Stream; pronounced elf. Linked vand to fjord with chains of living blue, Or shot in foam from granite shelf to shelf! XXI. ON THE PIER AT BURNTISLAND. So ran my thoughts at Granton as the train Swept curving round in view of the grey sea, But when the lazy steamer crossed, and we Were free of its collective stinks again, I caught a glimpse, through cloud, coal-smoke, and rain Upon the sloppy pier, that furnished me The missing gloss there well was need to be To clear the air for her, and light the main!— The world looks bright to kings—a favoured race Who free of toil through earth's gay gardens roam; Looks fair to lovers; and a happy place To children; but its brightest mornings come To humble mother waiting the embrace Of her bronzed sailor son returning home. XXII. A RARE DIP. I've floated on Lochleven, dipped in Tay, And many another stream both great and small, Dared the white thunder of a waterfall, And been baptised in many a mill-wheel's spray; I've drunk the brine in Kristiania bay And swum almost all up the Sætersdal, And every bath was ecstasy, but all Must yield to one rare dip I had to-day. Oh, pleasantly the Farg's clear waters flashed Into the rocky pool their liquid song; With more than Alpheus' haste I stripped, and dashed Among the music, plunging oft and long; And not alone my limbs—the music washed Hate from my heart, and from my memory wrong! XXIII. FROM THE WICKS OF BAIGLIE. Here there are braes, and glens, and brawling brooks, And cascades flinging loose their diamond spray, And waters winding down to firth and bay, And woods, and craigs, and knowes, and fairy nooks; But on the hill-tops there are golden stooks, And mill-wheels in the cascade's thunder play, Boats breast the river, artists glenward stray, And over barren craigs rise pastoral crooks.— Not many years ago the scene was claimed By the rude elements—to whom it gave Thistle, and thorn, and stone, and stream unnamed, Harvestless hill, and undivided wave; Now the wild elephant is trapped and tamed, Caparisoned and tended—and a slave! XXIV. THELEMARKEN: A PER-CONTRA. However, there's the freedom of the Fells, Such as the wilds of Thelemarken show, Where cataracts roar unbridged, and torrents flow Burdened but with the beauty of their bells; Where the cliff soars, and the broad sky-roof swells, And morning comes with larger longer glow, And, pinnacled beyond the axe's blow, In peace the stately pine its centuries tells! Here you may live at large, with no one nigh: —Only, when twilight darkens earth and air, From the lone uplands you may chance to spy On the cliff-edge a wolf, perhaps a pair; Or silhouetted on the evening sky The slouching horror of a hermit bear!</field>
