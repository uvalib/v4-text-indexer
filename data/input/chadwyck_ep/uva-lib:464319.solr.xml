      <field name="fulltext">? quondam cithara tacentem Suscitat Musam, neque semper arcum ? Tendit Apollo. Horat. Od. 2. 10. To the worthy of all Honour, THOMAS STANLEY, Esq; To my Noble Kinsman THOMAS STANLEY, Esq; On his Lyrick Poems Composed by Mr. JOHN GAMBLE. I What means this stately TABLATURE, The Ballance of thy streins? Which seems in stead of sifting pure T'extend and Rack thy veins: Thy Odes first their owne Harmonie did break, For Singing 'troth is but in Tune to Speak. II Nor thus thy Golden Feet and Wings May it be thought false Harmonie T'Ascend to Heav'n by Silver Strings, This is Urania's Heraldrie; Thy Royal Poem now we may extol, And truely, Luna blazon'd upon Sol. III As when Amphion first did Call Each list'ning Stone from's Den, And with the Lute did form the Wall, But with his Words, the Men; So in their twisted Numbers now you thus Not onely Stocks perswade, but Ravish us. IV Thus do your Ayres Eccho o're The Notes and Anthemes of the Spheres, And their whole Consort back restore, As if Earth too would bless Heavens Ears: But yet the Spoakes on which they scal'd so High Gamble hath wisely laid of UT, RE, MI. Richard Lovelace. On the Excellent Poems of Tho. Stanley, Esq; Composed by Mr. JOHN GAMBLE. VVrapt in like Numbers (could th'husht world but hear Th'above abstracted Harmonie) Such Words Th'Octave Intelligence sings to his Sphear, When all th'Astonomers trembling Lines turn Chords. Thus the Mean Quire of Movers roul in Tone Their Crystal Tenor-Orbs to the Concent, This Base the Gammut Heaven of the Moon Ecchoes the G-Sol-Re-UT Firmament. Like which the nobler Poesie consignes Love Heat, and Beauty beams to Touch and Sight; Now strung with Rapsodie, th'Harmonious Lines Have taught the Ear burn, and admire what's bright. As if the King of Song had tun'd his Rayes, Make Souls turn Kindred Numbers, and reply Transport and Rapture, as th'untoucht Chord playes, Who moves the Diapason Sympathy. And all the Muses Hover in each Aire, Aire that they breath; Muses not yet concern'd In Poesie by that name (though Nine were there) Not from the Poem, but the Musick learn'd. For when they were but Girles, could yet not spel Their A-re Alphabet, they could talk Rime, And Tales of Love, and right scann'd Fancies tel, Though not with Fingers, but with Feet kept Time. Till they from untaught Strokes, and us'd to Twang O're all the Fathers sleeping untun'd Lyre, Began to wonder what it was he Sang, So by degrees Consorted into Quire. Clio, Urania, had no name beside Th'God-father gave at the Fount Hippocrene Muse, the addition of Maturer pride Inur'd like State noyse Princess and the Queen. But since the god assents, both Artists treat Th'Hils royal Parcener, thus She do's chuse Both Favourites Consorts to the lawful Sheet, Ore as She's Clio, th'other as the Muse. Jo. Redmayne. To my much honored Cozen Mr. Stanley, Upon his Poems set by Mr. JOHN GAMBLE. I Enough, Enough, of Orbs and Spheres, Reach me a Trumpet or a Drum, To sound sharp Synnets in your Ears, And Beat a Deep Encomium. II I know not th'Eight Intelligence; Those that do understand it, Pray Let them step thither, and from thence Speak what they all do Sing or Say: III Nor what your Diapasons are, Your Sympathies and Symphonies; To me they seem as distant farre As whence they take their Infant rise. IV But I've a grateful Heart can ring A peale of Ordnance to your praise, And Volleys of small Plaudits bring To Clowd a Crown about your Baies. V Though Lawrel is thought Thunder-free, That Storms and Lightning Disallows, Yet CÃ¦sar thorough Fire and Sea Snatcht her to twist his Conquering Brows. VI And now me thinks like him you stand I'th' head of all the Poets Hoast, Whilest with your Words you do Command, They silent do their Duty Boast. VII Which done, the Army Ecchoes o're Like Gamble Ios One and all, And in their various Notes implore Long live our noble Generall. B[illeg.] P[illeg.]st[illeg.] On Mr. Gamble's Composing of Mr. Stanley's Incomparable ODES. Sure when this Lyre was touch'd, fit Words Did Dance in Order to the Chords; And Lines in Harmonie thus strung Rise sprightly Cap'ring on the Tongue; We that but read with hoarser Throates, Do yet disturb them into Notes; And who Repeats, unwitting Sings, As Ecchoes rise from Jangled Strings: So Theban Walls by Batt'ries soone As Shaken, totter into Tune; And Instruments that Scrued stand, Sound, Struck by an unwilling Hand: So a but peradventure Fall Awakes the sleeping Harpsychall, VVhich since the Artist ang'red last Lay lull'd in its own Musick fast. Here's no disordring the fair Mind, Unruly matter up to bind, Until the too much forced Zones Snapt, Knit in short Ellisions; No Crowded words in Huddle meet, That shuffle on un-even Feet, And strugling labour in their Pains, As if the Verse were pac'd in Chains. The very Syllables as Clear Pass'd (as their Ayres now) through the Ear; And He that made the Essence whole, Cannot distinguish which is Soule, VVhere one informs the other, They So mixe in their Unbodyed Play. Eldred Revet. To his Friend THOMAS STANLEY, Esq; On his ODES Set and Published By Mr. JOHN GAMBLE. Stanley the Darling of Apollo, you That make at once both Verse and Musick too; So sweet a Master of so sweet a Muse, Whom not to name with honour, were t'abuse. How your words flow! How sweetly do they Chyme, VVhen your pure Couplets do imbrace in Ryme! How quick, how lovely, and how full of Sence Your Fancie is, and all that springs from thence! VVhich Gamble has enliv'ned by his Art, And breath'd an Active Soul through every part: And so deduc'd your Mind to us, that we May feast our Ears and Souls with raritie. How much to You, how much to Him we owe, VVe can conceive, but cannot make you know; Nor have we thanks proportion'd to your worth, You that did make, and He that set them forth, In such a lively Dress too, VVe admire VVhat we cann't praise, what we cann't do, Desire; And therefore turn our praises into prayers, That You'l make more such Odes, He more such Ayres. Alexander Broome. On my Friend Mr. JOHN GAMBLE His excellent Composition of the Songs and Dialogues of THOMAS STANLEY, Esq Man is Compos'd of Harmonie, each Sense Moves by a Sphericall Intelligence; Such as have small Skill in Articulate Notes, Yet, as their Ears do like, can give their Votes; And by that Judgement I am led (my Friend) On thy Just Merits some few Lines to spend: Here, thou hast play'd the Cunning Chymist, fixt Mercurial-Notes to Words, so aptly mixt, So wedded to each Accent, Sense, and Feet; They like two Bodies in one Center meet: The Elements of Fire and Air here kiss, Without Confusion, by Hypothesis, Unto the Muses Lamp thou addest Oyle, By thy Elaborate-Skill, Ingenious Toyl: Plato by Numbers Mounted Heaven, and Wee Have no less Ladder thus Inspir'd by Thee; Wee that have Souls! no undigested Stuff, Like th'Dunghill-Cock that Struts after S? ? Buff; Let such imbrace their Chaos, with it sink, Discord to them's as good as Meat and Drink; While Wee Three Regions 'bove Them sit, and Praise Thy Concord in these Snarling-Dogged-daies. Jo. Tatham. The following poems are scored for music in the source text. Where poems are not stanzaic, no attempt has been made to reconstruct the metrical lines. Variations for different voices have been ignored. Repetition marks have been ignored. 1. The Return. [I] Beauty whose soft Magnetick chains Nor time not absence can untie, Thy power the narrow bounds disdains Of Nature or Philosophie; That canst by unconfined Laws, A motion, though at distance, cause. II Drawn by the powerful Influence Of thy bright eyes, I back return: And since I no where can dispence With flames which do in absence burn, I rather choose 'twixt them t'expire, Then languish in a hidden fire. III But if thou the insulting pride Of vulgar beauties dost despise, Who by vain triumphs Deifide Their votaries do sacrifice, Then let those flames, whose magick charm At distance scorch'd, aproch'd, but warm. 1. The Answer. [I] Beauty thy harsh imperious chains, As a scorn'd weight I here un-tie; Since thy proud Empire those disdains, Of reason or Philosophy: That wouldst within Tyranick laws, Confine the power of each free Cause. II Forc'd by the powerful Influence Of thy disdain, I back return; Thus with those flames I do dispence, Which though they would not, light did burn, And rather will through cold expire, Then languish in a frozen fire. III But whilest I the insulting pride Of thy vain beauty do despise, Who gladly would be Deifide By making me thy sacrifice: May Love thy Heart, which is his Charm, Approch'd, seem'd cold; at distance, warm. (3) The Tombe. [I] When, cruel Fair one, I am slain, By thy disdain; And, as a Trophy of thy scorn, To some old tombe am born; Thy fetters must their power bequeath To those of death; Nor can thy flame immortal burn, Like monumental fires within an urn; Thus freed from thy proud Empire, I shall prove, There is more liberty in Death then Love. II And when forsaken Lovers come To see my tombe, Take heed thou mix not with the croud, And (as a Victor) proud To view the spoils thy beauty made Press near my shade, Lest thy too cruel breath or name Should fan my ashes back into a flame, And thou, devour'd by this revengeful fire, His sacrifice, who dy'd as thine, expire. III But if cold Earth, or Marble must Conceal my dust, Whilst hid in some dark ruines, I Dumb and forgotten lie, The pride of all thy victorie Will sleep with me; And they who should attest thy Glory, Will, or forget, or not believe this story: Then to encrease thy Triumph, let me rest, Since by thine Eye slain, buried in thy Brest. (4) Celinda, by what potent Art [I] Celinda, by what potent Art, Or unresisted charm, Dost thou thine ear and frozen heart Against my passion arm; Or by what hidden influence, Of powers in one combin'd, Dost thou rob love of either sense, Made deaf as wel as blind. II Sure thou as friends united hast Two distant Deities And Scorn within thy Heart hast plac'd And Love within thine Eyes. Or those soft Fetters of thy Hair A bondage that disdains All Liberty, doth guard thy Ear Free from all other chains. The Close. Then my Complaint, how canst thou hear; Or I this passion fly; Since thou imprison'd hast thine ear, And not confin'd thine eye. (5) When I lie burning in thine eye [I] VVhen I lie burning in thine eye, Or freezing in thy brest, What Martyrs in wish'd flames that die, Are half so pleas'd or blest? When thy soft accents through mine ear, Into my soul do fly; What Angel would not quit his sphere, To hear such harmony? II Or when the kiss thou gav'st me last My soul stole in its breath, What life would sooner be embrac'd Then so desir'd a death? When I commanded am by thee, Or by thine eyes or hand; What Monarch would not prouder be To serve, then to command. The Close. Then think no freedome I desire, Or would my fetters leave, Since Phenix-like I from this fire Both life and youth receive. (6) Favonius, the milder breath o'th Spring [I] Fatonius, the milder breath o'th Spring, When proudly bearing on his softer wing, Rich Odors, which from the Panchean Groves, He steales, as by the Phenix pyre he moves, Profusely doth his sweeter theft dispence To the next Roses blushing innocence; But from the grateful flower a richer sent He back receives then he unto it lent. II Then laden with his odours richest store, He to thy breath hasts, to which these are pore; Which whil'st he sportively to steale essaies, He like a wanton Lover 'bout thee plaies. And sometimes coo ing thy soft cheek doth lie, And sometimes burning at thy flaming eye; Drawne in at last by that breath we implore, He back returns, far sweeter then before. The Close. And rich by being rob'd, In Thee he sinds, The burning sweets of Pyres, The cool of Winds. (7) So fair Aurora [I] So fair Aurora doth her self discover, Asham'd oth' aged bed of her cold Lover, In modest blushes, whilst the treacherous light Betrays her early shame to the worlds sight. Such a bright colour doth the morning rose diffuse, When she her soft self doth disclose Half drown'd in dew, whilest on each leaf a tear Of night doth like a dissolv'd pearl appear. II Yet 'twere in vaine a colour out to seek To parallell my Chariessa's Cheek, Lesse are conferd with greater, and these seem To blush like her, not she to blush like them. But whence faire Soule this passion what pretence Had guilt to staine thy spotlesse innocence; Those onely this feele who have guilty been, Nor any blushes know but who know sin. The Close. Then blush no more, but let thy chaster flame That knows no cause know no effects of shame. (8) On this swelling bank once proud [I] On this swelling bank once proud, Of its burden Doris lay; Here she smil'd and did uncloud Those bright Suns eclipse the day; Here we sate, and with kind Art Shee about mee twin'd her Armes, Clasp't in hers my hand and heart Fetter'd in those pleasing charmes. II Hear my Love and Joys she crown'd, Whilest the hours stood still before me, With a killing glance did wound, And a melting kiss restore me. On the down of either brest, Whilest with joy my soul retir'd, My reclining head did rest, Till her lips new life inspir'd. The Close. Thus renewing of these sights, Doth with griefe and pleasure fill me, And the thought of these delights, Both at once revive and kill me. (9) I prethee let my heart alone [I] I prethee let my heart alone, Since now 'tis rais'd above thee; Not all the beauty thou dost own Again can make me love thee. He that was shipwrackt once before by such a Syrens call, And yet neglects to shun the shore, Deserves his second fall. II Each flatt'ring kiss, each tempting smile Thou dost in vain bestow, Some other Lovers might beguile Who not thy falshood know. But I am proof against all art, No vows shall ere perswade me Twise to present a wounded heart To her that hath betray'd me. The Close. Could I again be brought to love Thy form, though more di-vine, I might thy scorn as justly move, As now thou suffer'st mine. (10) Love what tyranick laws must they obey [I] Love what tyranick laws must they obey, Who bow beneath thy uncontrolled sway; Or how unjust will that harsh Empire prove, Forbids to hope, and yet commands to love: Must all are to thy hell condemn'd Sustain a double torture of despair and pain; Is't not enough vainly to hope and woo, That thou shouldst thus deny that vain hope too. II It were some hope Ixion-like to fold The empty air, or feed on thoughts that's cold: But if thou to my passion this deny, Thou mayst be starv'd to death as well as I. For how can thy pale sickly flame burn clere, When death and old despair inhabit here? Then let thy dim heat warm, or else expire; Dissolve this frost, or let that quench the fire. The Close. Thus let me not desire, or else possess; Neither or both are equal hapiness. (11) Delay? [I] Delay? Alas there cannot be to Love a greater tyrannie: those cruel beauties that have slain Their Votaries by their disdain, Or studied torments sharp and witty, Will be recorded for their pity, And after-ages be misled To think them blind, when this is spred. II Of deaths the speedyest is Despair, Delays the slowest torments are: Thy cruelty at once destoys But expectation starves my joys: Time and Delay, may bring me past The power of Love to cure, at last; And shouldst thou wish to ease my pain, Thy pity might be lent in vain. The Close. Or if thou hast decreed that I Must be beneath thy cruelty: Oh kill me soon, thou wilt express More mercy ev'n in shewing less. (12) Prethee trouble me no more [I] Prethee trouble me no more; I will drink, bee mad, and rore: AlcmÃ¦'on and Orestes grew Mad, when they their Mothers slew: But I no man having kill'd Am with hurtlesse fury fill'd; II Hercules with madnesse strook; Bent his Bow, his Quiver shook; Ajax mad, did fiercely wield Hectors Sword, and graspt his Shield: I nor Spear nor Target have, But this Cup (my weapon) wave: The Close. Crown'd with roses, thus for more Wine I call, drink, dance, and rore. (13) Roses (Loves delight) [I] Roses (Loves delight) let's joyn To the red cheek'd God of Wine: Roses crown us, while we laugh, And the juyce of Autumn quaff: Roses of all Flowers the King; Roses the fresh pride oth' spring: II Joy of every Deitie; Love, when with the graces he For the Ball himself disposes, Crowns his golden hair with Roses. Circling then with these our brow We'l to Bacchus Temple go: The Close. There some willing Beauty lead, And a youthful measure tread. (14) Foolish Lover go and seek [I] Foolish Lover go and seek For the Damask of the Rose, Or the Lillies white dispose, To adorn thy Mistris cheek; Steal some star out of the sky, Rob the Phenix, and the East Of her wealthy sweets devest, To enrich her Freth or eye. II We thy borrow'd pride despise For this wine to which we are Votaries, is richer far Then her cheeks, or breth, or eyes: And should that coy fair one view These diviner beauties, she In these flames would rival thee, And be taught to love thee too. III Come then break thy wanton chain, That when this brisk wine hath spred On thy paler cheek a red, Thou like us mayst love disdain: Love, thy power must yeeld to wine; And whilest thus our selves we arm, Boldly we defie thy charm, For these flames distinguish thine. (15) Dear, back my wounded heart restore [I] Dear, back my wounded heart restore, And turn away thy powerful eyes; Flatter my willing Soul no more, Love cannot hope what Fate denies; Take away thy smiles and kisses; Thy Love wounds deeper then disdain, For he that sees the heaven he misses, Sustains two hels of loss and pain. II Shouldst thou some others suit prefer, I might return thy scorn to thee, And learn Apostasie of her Who taught me first Idolatrie. Or in thy unrelenting breast Should I disdain or coyness move, He by thy hate might be releas'd, Who now is prisoner to thy love. III Since then unkind Fate will divorce Those whom Affection long united, Be thou as cruel as this force, And I in death shall be delighted. Thus whilest so many Suppliants woe And beg, they may thy pity prove, I only for thy scorn do sue, 'Tis charity here not to love. (16) Since Fate commands me hence [I] Since Fate commands me hence, and I Must leave my soul with thee, and die Dear, spare one sigh, or else let fall A tear to crown my Funeral, That I may tell my grieved heart, Thou art unwilling we should part; And Martyrs that embrace the fire Shall with less joy then I expire. II With this last kiss I will bequeath My soul transfus'd into thy breath; Whose active heat shal gently slide Into my breast, and there reside: And may in spight of Fate thus blest Be in this death of heaven possest: Then prove but kind, and thou shalt see Love hath more power then Destinie. (17 Song.) Chide, chide no more [I] Chide, chide no more; Away, The fleeting daughters of the day; Nor with impatient thoughts out-run The lazie Sun, Nor think the hours do move to flow delay is kind, And we too soon shall find, That which we seek, yet fear to find. II The mystick dark decrees Unfold not of the Destinies, Nor boldly seek to antedate The Laws of Fate: Thy anxious search a while forbear, Suppress thy hast, And know that time at last Will crown thy hope, or fix thy fear. (Song 18.) Fool take up thy shaft again [I] Fool take up thy shaft again, If thy store Thou profusely spend in vain; Who can furnish thee with more? Throw not then away thy darts, On impenetrable hearts. II Think not thy pale flame can warm Into tears, Or dissolve the snowy charm Which her frozen bosom wears, That expos'd unmelted lies To the bright suns of her eyes. III But since thou thy power hast lost, Nor canst fire Kindle in that breast, whose frost Doth these flames in mine inspire, Nor to thee but Her I'l she, That disdains both me and you. (19) Though when I lov'd thee I Though when I lov'd thee thou wert fair, Thou art no longer so; Those glories all the pride they wear Unto opinion owe; Beauties, like stars in borrow'd lustre shine, And 'twas my love that gave thee thine. II The flames that dwelt within thine eye, Do now, with mine, expire; Thy brightest Graces fade and die At once with my desire; Loves fires thus mutual influence return, Thine cease to shine, when mine to burn. III Then (proud Celinda) hope no more To be implor'd or woo'd; Since by thy scorn thou dost restore The wealth my love bestow'd; And thy despis'd Disdain too late shall find That none are fair but who are kind. (Song 20.) When dearest Beauty thou shalt pay [I] When dearest Beauty thou shalt pay Thy fith and my vain hope away, To some dull Soul that cannot prize or know The worth of that thou dost bestow; Least with thy sighes and tears I might Disturb thy unconfin'd delight; To some dark shade I will retire And there forgot by all, expire. II Thus whilst the diffierence thou shalt prove, Betwixt a feign'd and real Love, Whilst he, more happy, but less true, Shall reap those joyes I did pursue, And with those pleasures crowned be By Fate, which Love design'd for me Then thou perhaps thy self wilt find Cruel too long, or too soon kind. (Song 21.) Think not pale Lover [I] Think not pale Lover he who dies Burnt in the flames of Celias eyes, Is unto Love a sacrifice. II Or by the merit of this pain Thou shalt the crown of Martyrs gain Those hopes are as thy passion vain. III For when by death from these flames free To greater thou condemn'd shalt be, And punisht for Idolatrie. IV Since thou Loves Votary before, Whilst she was kind dost him no more But in his shrine disdain adore. V Nor will this fire the gods prepare To punish scorn that Cruel fair Thou now from flames exempted spare. VI But as together both shal die, Both burnt alike in flames shal lie, She in thy heart, thou in her eye. (22) Torment of absence and delay [I] Torment of absence and delay, That thus afflicts my memorie, Why dost thou kill me every day, Yet will not give me leave to die: Why dost thou suffer me to live? All hope of life in life denying; Or to my patience tortures give, Never to die, yet ever dying. II To fair Narcissa's brighter eyes, I was by Loves instruction guided, A happiness I long did prize, But now am from their light divided. Favours and gifts my Suit obtain'd, But envyous Fate would now destroy them; Which if to lose I only gain'd, What greater pain then to enjoy them. Song 23. I will not trust thy tempting graces I I will not trust thy tempting graces, Or thy deceitfull charms; Nor pris'ner be to thy embraces, Or fetter'd in thy arms; No Celia, no, not all thy art Can wound or captivate my heart. II I will not gaze upon thy Eyes, Or wanton with thy Hair, Lest those should burn me by surprize, Or these my soul ensnare: Nor with those smiling dangers play, Or fool my liberty away. III Since then my wary heart is free, And unconfin'd as thine, If thou wouldst mine should captive be, Thou must thine own resigne, And gratitude may thus move more Then Love or Beauty could before. [24.] You that unto your Mistress eyes [I] You that unto your Mistress eyes Your hearts do sacrifice, And offer sighs or tears at Loves rich shrine, Renounce with me Th'Idolatrie, Nor this infernal power esteem divine. II The Brand, the Quiver, and the Bow, Which we did first bestow, And he as tribute wears from every Lover, I back again From him have tane, And the Impostor now unvail'd discover. III I can the feeble childe disarm, Unty his mystick charm, Devest him of his Wings, and break his Arrow, We will obey No more his sway, Nor live confin'd to laws or bounds so narrow. IV And you bright Beauties that inspire The boys pa'e torch with fire. We safely now your subtil power despise, And (unscorch'd) may Like Atoms play, And wanton in the sun-shine of your eyes. V Nor think hereafter by new arts You can bewitch our hearts, Or raise this Devil by your pleasing charm; We will no more His power implore, Unless like Indians, that he do no harm. [25.] You earthly Souls I You earthly Souls that court a wanton flame, Whose pale weak influence Can rise no higher then the humble name &amp; narrow laws of Sense, Learn by our friendship to create An imaterial fire, Whose brightness Angels may admire, But cannot emulate. II Sickness may fright the roses from her cheek, Or make the Lillies fade, But all the subtil wayes that death doth seek Cannot my love invade: Flames that are kindled by the eye, Through time and age expire; But ours that boast a reach far higher Cannot decay, nor die. III For when we must resigne our vital breath, Our Loves by Fate benighted, We by this friendship shall survive in death, Even in divorce united. Weak Love through fortune or distrust In time forgets to burn, But this pursues us to the Urn, And marries either's dust. Song 26. See how this Violet which before I See how this Violet which before Hung sullenly her drooping head, As angry at the ground that bore The purple treasure which she spred, Doth smilingly erected grow, Transplanted to those hils of snow. II And whilest the pillows of thy breast Do her reclining head sustain, She swels with pride to be so blest, And doth all others flowers disdain; Yet weeps that dew which kift her last, To see her odours so surpast. III Poor flower, how far deceiv'd thou wert, To think the riches of the morn, Or all the sweets she can impart, Could these or sweeten, or adorn, Since thou from them dost borrow sent, And they to thee lend ornament. Song 27. Why thy passion should it move I VVhy thy passion should it move, That I wisht thy Beauty less? Fools desire what is above Power of nature to express, And to wish it had been more, Had been to outwish her store. II If the flames within thine eye Did not too great heat inspire, Men might languish, yet not dye, At thy less ungentle fire, And might on thy weaker light Gaze, and yet not lose their sight. III Nor wouldst thou less fair appear, For detraction adds to thee; If some parts less beauteous were, Others would much fairer be: Nor can any part we know Best be styl'd, when all are so. IV Thus this great excess of light Which now dazels our weak eyes, Would eclips'd, appear more bright, And the only way to rise; Or to be more fair then thee Celia, is less fair to bee. Song 28. Ask the Empress of the night I Ask the Empress of the night, How that hand which guides her sphere, Constant in unconstant light, Taught the waves her yoke to bear: And did thus by loving force Curb or tame the rude Seas course. II Ask the female Palm how she First did wooe her Husbands love; And the Magnetick, ask how she Doth the obsequious Iron move: Waters, Plants, and Stones know this, That they love, not what Love is. III Be not thou less kind then those, Or from Love exempt alone; Let us twine like amorous Trees, And like Rivers melt in one; Or if thou more cruel prove, Learn of Steel and Stone to love. Song 29. Dear urge no more the killing I Dear urge no more the killing Cause of our divorce; Love is not fetter'd by such laws, Nor bows to any force Though thou deniest I should be thine, Yet say not thou deserv'st not to be mine. II Oh rather frown away my breath With thy disdain, Or flatter me with smiles to death; By joy or sorrow slain, 'Tis less crime to be kill'd by thee, Then I thus cause of mine own death should be. III Thy self of beauty to devest And me of love, Or from the worth of thine own breast Thus to detract, would prove In us a blindness, and in thee At best a sacrilegious modestie. IV But (Celia) if thou wilt despise What all admire, Nor rate thy self at the just price Of beauty or desire. Yet meet thy flames, and thou shalt see That equal love knows no disparitie. Song 25. Not that by this disdain I Not that by this disdain I am releas'd, And freed from thy tyrannick chain, Do I my self think blest; Nor that thy flame shall burn No more for know, That I shall into ashes turn, Before this fire doth so. II Nor yet that unconfin'd I now may rove, And with new beauties please my mind; But that thou ne'r didst love: For since thou hast no part Felt of this flame, I only from thy tyrant heart Repuls'd, not banish'd am. III To loose what once was mine Would grieve me more Then those inconstant sweets of thine Had pleas'd my soul before. Now I have not lost the bliss I ne'r possest; In spight of Fate am blest in this, That I was never blest. Song 31. When deceitful Lovers lay I VVhen deceitful Lovers lay At thy feet, their suppliant hearts And their snares spread to betray Thy best treasure with their arts, Credit not their flatt'ring vows, Love such perjury allows. II When they with their choycest wealth Nature boasts of, have possest thee; When with flowers their verses stealth, Stars to Jewels doth devest thee: Trust not to their borrow'd store, 'Tis but lent to make thee poor. III When with Poems they invade thee, Sigh thy praises, or disdain; When they weep, and would perswade thee That their flames beget that rain: Let thy breast no bates let in, Mercy's only here a sin. IV Let no tears or offrings move thee, At those cunning charms avoyd, For that wealth for which they love thee They would slight, if once enjoy'd: Guard thy unrelenting mind, None are cruel, but the kind. [32.] He whose active thoughts disdain I He whose active thoughts disdain To be captive to one foe, And would break his single chain, Or else more would undergoe; Let him learn the art of me, By new bondage to be free. II What tyrannick Mistress dare To one beauty love confine? Who unbounded as the aire All may court but none decline: Why should we the Heart deny As many objects as the Eye? III Wheresoe're I turn or move A new passion doth detaine me: Those kind beauties that do love, Or those proud ones that disdain me; This frown melts, and that smile burns me; This to tears, that ashes turns me. IV Soft fresh Virgins not full blown, With their youthful sweetness take me; Sober Matrons that have known Long since what these prove, awake me: Here staid coldness I admire, There the lively active fire. V She that doth by skill dispence Every favour she bestows, Or the harmless innocence Which nor Court nor City knows, Both alike my soul enflame, That wilde beauty, and this tame. VI She that wisely can adorn Nature with the wealth of Art, Or whose rural sweets do scorn Borrow'd helps to take a heart, The vain care of that's my pleasure, Poverty of this my treasure. VII Both the wanton and the coy Me with equal pleasures move; She whom I by force enjoy, Or who forceth me to love; This because she'l not confess, That not hide her happiness, VIII She whose loosly flowing hair, Scatter'd like the beams o'th' Morn, Playing with the sportive air, Hides the sweets it doth adorn, Captive in that net restrains me, In those golden fetters chains me. IX Nor doth she with power less bright My divided heart invade, Whose soft tresses spread like Night, O're her shoulders a black shade; For the star-light of her eyes Brighter shines through those dark Skies. X Black, or fair, or tall, or low, I alike with all can sport; The bold sprightly Thais woo, Or the frozen vestall court; Every beauty takes my mind, Tied to all, to none confin'd. Song 33. No, I will sooner trust the wind I No, I will sooner trust the wind, When falsly kind It courts the pregnant Sails into a storm, And when the smiling waves perswade Be willingly betray'd, Then thy deceitfull Vows or Form. II Go and beguile some easie heart With thy vain art; Thy smiles and kisses on those foo's bestow, Who only see the Calms that sleep On this smooth flatt'ring Deep, But not the hidden dangers know. III They that like me thy falshood prove, Will scorn thy Love. Some may deceiv'd at first adore thy Shrine, But He that as thy sacrifice Doth willingly fall twice, Dies his own Martyr, and not thine. [34.] Such icy kisses Anchorites that live I Such icy kisses Anchorites that live Secluded from the world to dead sculs give, And these cold Maids on whom Love never spent His flame, nor know what by desire is meant To their expiring fathers, such bequeath, Snatching their fleeting spirits in that breath, The timerous Priest doth with such fear and nice Devotion touch the holy Sacrifice. II Fie Chariessa, whence so chang'd of late, As to become in love a reprobate? Quit, quit this dulness, Fairest, and make known A flame unto me, equal with my own: Shake off this frost for shame, that dwels upon Thy lip, or if it will not so be gone, Let's once more joyn our lip, and thou shalt see That by the flame of mine 'twill melted be. [35.] That I might ever dream thus I That I might ever dream thus, that some power To my eternal sleep would joyn this hour, So willingly deceiv'd I might possess In seeming joys a real happiness: Death, I would gladly bow beneath thy charms, If thou couldst bring my Doris to my arms; That thus at last made happy I might prove In life the hell, in death the heaven of love. II Hast not away so soon, mock not my joys With the delusive sight, or empty noyse Of happiness; Oh do not dissipate A pleasure thou so lately didst create. Shadows of life or death do such bliss give, That 'tis an equal curse to wake or live; Stay then kind sleep, be ever here confin'd; Or if thou wilt away, leave her behind. [36.] Roses in breathing forth their sent I Roses in breathing forth their sent, Or stars their borrowed ornament; Nymphs in the watery sphere that move, Or Angels in their orbs above; The winged chariot of the light, Or the slow silent wheels of night; The shade which from the swifter Sun, Doth in a circular motion run; Or souls that their eternal Rest do keep, Make far less noise then CÃ¦lia's Breath in sleep. II But if the Angel which inspires This subtle flame with active fires, Should mould this breath to words, and those Into a harmony dispose; The musick of this heavenly sphear Would steal each soul out at the ear, And into plants and stones infuse A life that Cherubins would chuse; And with new powers invert the laws of Fate, Kill those that live, and dead things animate. [37.] Rebellious fools that scorn to bow I Rebellious fools that scorn to bow Beneath Loves easie sway, Whose stubborn wills no laws allow, Disdaining to obey, Mark but this wreath of hair and you shall see, None that might wear such fetters would be free. II I once could boast a soul like you As unconfin'd as air; But mine, which force could not subdue, Was caught within this snare; And (by my self betray'd) I for this gold, A heart that many storms withstood, have sold. III No longer now wise Art enquire (With this vain search delighted) How souls that humane breasts inspire Are to their frames united; Material chains such spirits well may bind, When this soft braid can tie both Arm and Mind. IV Now (Beauties) I defie your charm, Rul'd by more powerful Art, This mystick wreath which crowns my Arm, Defends my vanquisht Heart; And I, subdu'd by one more fair, shall be Secur'd from Conquest by Captivity. [38.] Yet ere I go I Yet ere I go, Disdainful Beauty thou shalt be So wretched, as to know What joys thou fling'st away with me. A Faith so bright As Time or Fortune could not rust; So firm that Lovers might Have read thy story in my dust. And crown'd thy name With Laurel verdant as thy Youth, Whil'st the shril voyce of Fame Spread wide thy Beauty and my Truth. II This thou hast lost; For all true Lovers, when they find That my just aims were crost, Will speak thee lighter then the wind. And none will lay Any oblation on thy shrine, But such as would betray Thy faith, to faiths as false as thine. Yet if thou chuse On such thy freedome to bestow, Affection may excuse, For love from Sympathy doth flow. [39.] Cast off for shame ungentle maid I Cast off for shame ungentle maid That misbecoming joy thou wear'st; For in my Death (though long delay'd) Unwisely cruel thou appear'st. Insult o're Captives with disdain, Thou canst not triumph or'e the slain. II No, I am now no longer thine, Nor canst thou take delight to see Him whom thy love did once confine Set, though by Death, at Liberty: For if my fall a smile beget, Thou gloriest in thy own defeat. III Behold how thy unthrifty pride Hath murtherd him that did maintain it; And wary Souls who never tride Thy Tyrant Beauty, will disdain it: But I am softer, and that me Thou wouldst not pity, pity thee. [40.] Wert thou by all affections sought I Wert thou by all affections sought, &amp; fairer then thou wouldst be thought, Or had thine eyes as many Darts As thou believ'st they shoot at Hearts, Yet if thy Love were payd to me, I would not offer mine to thee. II Ide sooner court a Feavers heat, Then her that owns a Flame as great; She that my Love will entertain, Must meet it with no less disdain. For mutual fires themselves destroy, And willing Kisses yield no Joy. III I love thee not because alone Thou canst all Beauty call thine own, Nor doth my passion fuel seek, In thy bright Eye, or softer Cheek: Then Fairest if thou wouldst know why I love cause thou canst deny. [41.] Deceiv'd and undeceiv'd I Deceiv'd and undeceiv'd to be At once I seek with equal care, Wreched in the discovery, Happy if cozen'd still I were: Yet certain ill of ill hath less Then the mistrust of happiness. II But if when I have reach'd my aim, (That which I seek less worthy prove,) Yet still my love remains the same, The subject not deserving love; I can no longer be excus'd Now more in fault as less abus'd. III Then let me flatter my desires, And doubt what I might know too sure, He that to cheat himself conspires, From falshhood doth his faith secure In Love uncertain to believe I am deceiv'd, doth undeceive. IV For if my Life on Doubt depend, And in distrust inconstant steer, If I essay the strife to end (When Ignorance were Wisdome here;) All thy attempts how can I blame To work my Death? I seek the same. [42.] Men and Maids at time of year I Men and Maids at time of year The ripe clusters joyntly bear To the Press, but in when thrown They by men are trod alone, Who in Bacchus praises join, Squeeze the Grape, let out the wine: Oh with what delight they spy The new must when tunn'd work high! II Which if old men freely take, Their gray heads and heels they shake; And a young man if he find Some fair Maid to sleep resign'd, In the shade, he straight goes to her, Wakes, and roundly gins to wooe her; Whilest love slily stealing in Tempts her to the pleasing sin. III Yet she long resists his offers, Nor will hear what ere he proffers; Till perceiving that his prayer Melts into regardless air; Her, who seemingly restrains, He by pleasing force constrains: Wine doth boldness thus dispence, Teaching young men insolence. [43.] I must no longer now admire I I must no longer now admire The coldness which possest thy snowy breast, That can by other flames be set on fire; Poor Love to harsh disdain betray'd, Is by ambition thus out-weigh'd. II Hadst thou but known the vast extent Of Constant Faith, how farre 'Bove all that are Born slaves to Wealth, or Honors vain assent; No richer Treasure couldst thou find Then hearts with mutual Chains combin'd. III But Love is too despis'd a name, And must not hope to rise Above these ties. Honour and Wealth out-shine his paler Flame; These unite Souls, whilest true desire Unpitied dies in its own Fire. IV Yet, cruel Fair one, I did aim With no less justice too, Than those that sue For other hopes, and thy proud Fortunes claim, Wealth honours, honours wealth approve, But Beauty's only meant for Love. [44.] Love the ripe harvest of my toyls I Love the ripe harvest of my toyls Began to cherish with his smiles, Preparing me to be indu'd With all the Joys I long persu'd; When my fresh hopes, fair and full blown, Death blasts ere I could ca I my own. II Malicious Death, why with rude force Dost thou my Fair from me divorce? False life why in this loathen chain Me from my Fair dost thou detain: In whom assistance shall I find, Alike are Life and Death unkind. III Pardon me Love, thy power outshines And laughs at their infirm designes; She is not wedded to atoombe, Nor I to sorrow in her Room: They what thou joynst' can ne'r divide, She lives in me, in her I dy'd, [45.] See the Spring her self discloses I See the Spring her self discloses, And the Graces gather roses: See how the becalmed Seas Now their swelling waves appease; How the Duck swims how the Crane Come's from's Winter Home aganie See how Titan's Chearrful Raye Chaseth the dark Clouds a way, II Now in their new robes of green Are the Plough-mens labours seen; Now the lusty teeming Earth Springs each hour with a new birth; Now the Olive blooms; the Vine Now doth with plump pendants shine, And with leaves and blossoms now Freshly bourgeons every bough. Song 46. Now will I a Lover be [I] Now will I a Lover be, Love himself commanded me; Full at first of stubborn pride, To submit my soul deni'd, He his Quiver takes and Bow, Bids defiance, forth we goe; Arm'd with spear and shield we meet, On he charges, I retreat. II Till perceiving in the fight He had wasted every flight, Into me, with fury hot, Like a dart himselfe he shot, And my cold heart melts my shield Uselesse, no defence could yeild; For what boots an outward skreen When (alas) the fights within? Song 47. Dear fold me once more in thine Armes [I] Dear sold me once more in thine Armes; And let me know, Before I goe, There is no blisse but in those charmes, By thy faire selfe I sweare, That here and onely here I would for ever ever stay, But cruel Fate calls me away. II How swiftly the light minutes slide The hours that hast Away thus fast By envyous flight my stay do chide: Yet Dear, since I must go, By this last kiss I vow By all that sweetness which dwels with thee, Time shall move slow, till next I see thee. Song 48. Thine Eyes (bright Saint) disclose [I] Thine Eyes (bright Saint) disclose And thou shalt find, Dreams have not with illusive showes, Deceiv'd thy Mind, What sleep presented to thy view, Awake and thou shalt find it true II Those mortal Wounds I bear From thee begin, Which though they outward not appear, Yet bleed within, Loves flame like active lightening flyes, Wounding the Heart, but not the Eyes. III But now I yeild to die Thy sacrifice, Nor more in vain will hope to flie From thy bright Eyes; Their killing Power cannot be shunn'd Open or clos'd alike they wound. [49.] Faith 'tis not worth your pains and care [I] Faith 'tis not worth your pains and care, To seek t'inspire A heart so pure as mine; Som fools ther be, Hate libertie, Whom w?? more ease thou mayst confine. II Alass! when with much charge thou hast Brought it at last Beneath thy power to bow, It will adore Some twenty more, And that perhaps you'ld not allow. III No Cloris, I no more will prove The curse of Love, And now can boast a heart Hath learn'd of thee Inconstancie, And couzen'd women of their Art. Song 50. Reach me here that full crown'd Cup [I] Reach me here that full crown'd Cup, And at once I'l drink it up For my overcharged Breast Pants for drowth, with care opprest; Whilest a Chaplet of cool Roses My distemper'd Brow incloses; Love I'l drench in Wine; For these flames alone can his appease. II I am sprung of humane seed, For a lives short race decree'd; Though I know the way I've gone, That which is to come's unknown; Busie thoughts do not disturb me; What have you to do to curb me? Come, some Wine and Musick give; Ere we dye, 'tis fit we live. Song 51. Oh turn away those cruel Eyes [I] Oh turn away those cruel Eyes, The stars of my undoing. Or death in such a bright disguise May tempt a second wooing. II Punish their blindly impious pride, Who dare contemne thy glory; It was my Fall that deifide Thy name, and seal'd thy story. III Yet no new sufferings can prepare A higher praise to crown thee; Though my first death proclaim thee Fair, My second will unthrone thee. IV Lover will doubt thou canst intice No other for thy fuel, And if thou burn one Victime twice, Both think thee poor and cruel. [52.] Now Love be prais'd [I] Now Love be prais'd! that cruel Fair, Who my poor Heart restrain Under so many chains, Hath weav'd a new one for it of her Hair. II These threads of Amber us'd to play With every Courtly wind, And never were confin'd, But in a thousand Curls aloud to stray. III Cruel each part of her is grown, Nor less unkind then She These fetters are to Me, Which to restrain my Freedome, lose their own. Song 53. To set my jealous soul at strife [I] To set my jealous soul at strife All things malicio sly agree, Though sleep of death the Image be, Dreams are the portraitures of life. II I saw when last I clos'd my eyes, Celinda stoopt t'anothers will, If specious apprehension kill, What would the truth without disguise? III The joys which I could call my owne Me thought this Rival did possess, Like dreams is all my happiness; Yet dreams themselves allow me none. [54.] Wrong me no more in thy complaint I VVrong me no more in thy complaint, Blam'd for inconstancy; I vow'd t'adore the fairest Saint, Nor chang'd whilst thou wert she: But if another thee outshine, Th'inconstancy is onely Thine. II To be by such Blind Fools admir'd Gives thee but small esteem, By whom as much Thou'dst be desir'd Didst thou less beautious seem: Sure why they love they know not wel, Who why they should not cannot tel. III Women are by Themselves bettay'd, And to their short joys cruel, Who foolishly Themselves perswade Flames can outlast their fuel: None (though Platonick their pretence) With Reason love unless by Sence. IV And He, by whose Command to Thee I did my heart resigne, Now bids me choose A Deity Diviner far then thine: No power from Love can Beauty sever; I'me still Loves subject, thine was never. V The fairest She Whom none surpass To love hath only right, And such to me Thy Beauty was Till one I found more bright: But 'twere as impious to adore Thee now, as not to have don't before. VI Nor is it just By rules of Love Thou should'st deny to quit A heart that must Anothers prove Ev'n in thy right to it: Must not thy Subjects Captives be To her who triumphs over Thee? VII Cease then in vain To blot my name With forg'd Apostasie, Thine is that stain Who dar'st to claim What others ask of Thee: Of Lovers they are onely true Who pay their hearts where they are due. [55.] My sickly breath wasts in a double flame [I] My sickly breath wasts in a double flame; Whilst Love and Death to my poor life lay claime; The feavour in whose heat I melt By her that causeth it not felt. II Thou who alone Canst, yet wilt grant no ease; Why slight'st thou one To feed a new disease? Unequal Fair, the heart is thine, Ah! Why then should the pain be mine. Song 55. Alas! alas! thou turn'st in vain [I] Alass! alass! thou turn'st in vain Thy beauteous face away, Which (like young Sorcerers) rais'd a Pain Above its power to lay. II Love moves not as thou turn'st thy look, But here doth firmly rest; He long agoe thy Eyes forsook To revel in my Brest. III Thy Power on him why hop'st thou more Then his on me should be, The Claim thou lay'st to him is poor To that he owns from Me. IV His substance in my Heart excels, His shadow in thy Sight; Fire where it burns more truly dwels, Then where it scatters light. [57.] As when some brook flies from it self away [I] As when some brook flies from it self away, The murmuring Christal loosly runs astray. And as about the verdant plane it windes, The meadows with a silver ribbon bindes, Printing a kiss on every Flower she meets, Loosing her selfe, to fit them with new sweets. II To scatter frost upon the Lillies Head, And Scarlet on the Gilloflower to spread; So melting sorrow, in the fair disguise Of humid Stars, flow'd from bright Cloris Eyes, Which watring every Flower her Cheek discloses, Melt into Iesmines here there into Roses. Song 51. I languish in a silent flame [I] I languish in a silent flame; For she to whom my vowes encline Doth own perfections so divine, That but to speak where to disclose her Name. Ff I should say that she the store Of Natures graces doth comprize, The Love and wonder of all Eyes, Who will not guess the Beauty I adore? II Or though I warily conceal The Charms her looks and Soul possess; Should her cruelty express, And say she smiles at all the Pains we feel, Among such suppliants as implore Pity, distributing her Hate Inexorable ar their Fate: Who will not guess the Beauty I adore? Song 59. Not always give a melting Kiss [I] Not always give a melting Kiss, And Smiles with pleasing Whispers joyn'd; Nor alwayes extasi'd with bliss, About my Neck thy fair Arms wind. II The wary Lover learns by measure To circumscribe his greatest joy; Lest, what well husbanded yeilds pleasure, Might by the Repetition cloy. III When thrice three Kisses I require, Give me but two, withhold the other; Such as cold Virgins to their Sire, Or chaste Diana gives her Brother. IV Then wantonly snatch back thy Lip. And smoothly as sly fishes glide Through water, giving me the slip, Thy self in some dark corner hide. V I'le follow Thee with eager haste, And having caught (as Hawks their prey) In my victorious Arm held fast Panting for Breath, bear thee away. VI Then thy soft Arms about me twin'd Thou shalt use all thy skill to please me, And offer all that was behind The poor Seven Kisses to appease me. VII How much mistaken wilt thou be! For seven times seven shalt thou pay, Whilest in my Arms I fetter Thee, Lest thou once more shouldst get away. VIII 'Til I at last have made thee swear By all thy Beauty and my Love, That thou again the same severe Revenge for the same Crime wouldst prove. Song 60. Whilst our joys in wine we raise [I] Whilst our joys in wine we raise, Youthful Bacchus we will praise: Bacchus dancing did invent; Bacchus is on songs intent; Bacchus teacheth Love to court, And his Mother how to sport; Gracefull confidence He lends, He oppressive trouble ends. II To the Bowle when we repair Grief doth vanish into air; Drink we then, and drown all sorrow; All our care not knows the morrow; Life is dark, let's dance and play, They that will be troubled may; We our joys with wine will raise, Youthfull Bacchus we will praise. Song 61. Tis no Kiss my Fair bestows [I] Tis no Kiss my Fair bestows; Nectar 'tis whence new Life flows; All the sweets which nimble Bees In their Ozier Treasuries With unequall'd Art repose In one kiss her lips disclose; These (if I should many take) Soon would me Immortall make. II Rais'd to the divine Abodes, And the Banquets of the gods. Be not then too lavish, Fair! But this heavenly Treasure spare, 'Less thou'lt too Immortal be: For without thy Companie, What to me were the Abodes, Or the Banquets of the gods. [62.] As in a thousand wanton Curls I As in a thousand wanton Curls, The Vine doth the lov'd Elme imbrace; As clasping Ivy round the Oak doth twine To kiss his leavy Face; So thou about my Neck thy Arms shalt fling, Joyning to mine thy Breast; So shal my arms about thy fair Neck cling, My lips on thine imprest? II Ceres nor Bacchus, Care of Life nor Sleep Shall force me to retire; But we at once will on each others Lip Our mutual Souls expire. Then hand in hand down to th'Elizian Plains (Crossing the Stygian Lake) Wee'l through those Fields where Spring eternal reigns Our pleasing journey take. III There their fair Mistresses the Heroes lead, And their old Loves repeat, Singing or dancing in a flowry Mead With Mirtles round beset. Roses and Violets smile beneath a Skreen Of ever verdant Bayes; And gentle Zephyr amorously between Their leaves untroubled playes. IV There constantly the pregnant Earth unplow'd Her fruitful store supplies: When We come thither, all the happy Crowd From their green Thrones will rise. There thou in place above Iove's numerous Train Of Mistresses shalt sit; Hers Hellen, Homer will not his disdain For Thee, and Me to quit. Song 63. When I see the young men play [I] VVhen I see the young men play, Young me thinks I am as they, And my aged thoughts lay'd by, To the dance, with ioy I fly: Come a flowry chaplet lend me, Youth and mirthfull thoughts attend me. II Age begon, we'l dance among Those that young are, and be young: Bring some Wine Boy, fill about; You shal see the old Man's stout; Who can laugh and tipple too, And be mad as well as you. Song 64. Now with roses we are crown'd [I] Now with roses we are crown'd, Let our mirth and cups go round, Whilst a Lass, Whose hand a spear, Branchd with Ivy twines doth bear, With her white feet beats the ground To the Lutes harmonious sound, II Play'd on by some Boy, whose choyce Skill is heightned by his voyce: Bright-hair'd Love, with his divine Mother, and the god of Wine Will flock hither, glad to see Old men of their companie. Song 65. On this verdant Lotus laid [I] On this verdant Lotus laid, Underneath the Myrtles shade, Let us drink our sorrows dead, Whilst love plaies the Ganimed. II Life like a wheel runs round, And ere long we underground (Ta'n by death asunder) must Molder in forgotten dust. III Why then graves should we bedew, Why the ground with odours strew? Better whilest alive prepare Flowers and unguents for our hair. IV Come my Fair, and come away, All our cares behind us lay; That these pleasures we may know. Ere we come to those below. [66.] I yeild, dear Enemy I yeild, dear Enemy, nor know How to resist so fair a Foe; Who would not thy soft yoke sustain, Or bow beneath thy easy chain, That with a bondage blest might be, Which far transcends all liberty? But since I freely have resign'd At first assault my willing mind, Insult not o're my captiv'd heart With too much tyrannie and art, Lest by thy scorn thou lose the prize, Gain'd by the power of thy bright eyes; And thou this conquest thus shalt prove, Though got by beauty kept by love. [67.] Draw neer you Lovers that complain Draw neer you Lovers that complain Of Fortune or Disdain, And to my ashes lend a tear; Melt the hard marble with your grones, And soften the relentless Stones. Whose cold imbraces the sad Subject hide Of all Loves cruelties, and Beauties pride. No verse no Epicedium bring, Nor peaceful Requiem sing, To charm the terrors of my Herse; No profane Numbers must flow neer The sacred silence that dwels here; Vast griefs are dumb; Softly, oh softly mourn, Lest you disturb the peace attends my Urn. Yet strew upon my dismal Grave, Such offerings as you have, Forsaken Cypress and sad Ewe; For kinder flowers can take no Birth or growth From such unhappy Earth. Weep onely o're my Dust, and say, Here lies To Love and Fate an equal Sacrifice. Song 68. Go Dear Saint away Go Dear Saint away, Snatcht from thy Arms, By far less pleasing charms, Then those I did obey: But if hereafter thou shalt know, That greife hath kill'd me, Come, and on my toomb, Drop drop a tear or two; Break with thy sighs the silence of my sleep, And I shall smile in death to see thee weep; Thy tears may have the power to reinspire My ashes with new fire, Or change Thee to some flower, Which planted 'twixt thy breasts shall grow; Vail'd in this shape I will, Dwell with Thee still, Court, kiss, injoy thee too; Securely wee'l contain all envyous force, And thus united be by Deaths divorce. Song 69. The lazy hours move slow The lazy hours move slow, The minutes stay; Old time with leaden feet doth goe, And his light wings hath cast away; The slow pac'd spheres above Have sure releas'd their guardians, and without help move, Whilest that the very Angels rest; the numbred sands That slide through this small glass, And into minutes time divide, too slow each other do displace; The tedious wheels of light No faster chime then that dul shade which waits on night, For expectation out-runs time: How long Lord must I stay? How long dwel here? Oh free me from this loathed clay; Let me no more these fetters ware; With far more joy shall I resign my breath; For to my grieved soul not to die is every minute a new death. Song 70. When on thy lip my soul I breath VVhen on thy lip my soul I breath, Which there meets thine, Freed from their fetters by this death Our subtile Forms combine; Thus without bonds of sense they move, And like two Cherubins converse by love. Spirits to chains of earth confin'd Discourse by sense; But ours that are by flames refin'd With those weak ties dispense; Let such in words their minds display, We in a kiss our mutual thoughts convey; But since my soul from me doth fly, To thee retir'd, Thou canst nor both retain; For I must be with one inspir'd; Then, Dearest, either justly mine restore, Or in exchange let me have thine. Yet if thou dost return mine own, Oh tak't again! For 'tis this pleasing death alone Gives ease unto my pain: Kill me once more or I shall find Thy pity then thy cruelty, less kind. Song 71. The air which thy smooth voyce doth break The air which thy smooth voyce doth break, Into my soul like lightning flies, My life retires whilest thou dost speak, And thy soft breath its room supplies. Lost in this pleasing Extasie, I joyn my trembling lips to thine, &amp; back receive that life from thee, Which I so gladly did resign. Forbear, Platonick fools, t'enquire, What numbers do the soul compose; No harmony can life inspire, But that which from these accents flows. [72.] Doris, I that could repel Doris, I that could repel All those darts about thee dwell, And had wisely learn'd to fear, 'Cause I saw a foe so near; I that my deaf ear did arm 'Gainst thy voices powerful charm, And the lightning of thine eye Durst (by closing mine) defie, Cannot this cold snow withstand From the whiter of thy hand; Thy deceit hath thus done more Then thy open force before: For who could suspect or fear Treason in a face so clear; Or the hidden fires descry Wrapt in this cold outside lie; Flames might thus involv'd in ice, The deceiv'd world sacrifice; Nature, ignorant of this strange antiperistasis, Would her falling frame admire, That by snow were set on fire. [73.] Cast Chariessa, cast that glass away Cast Chariessa, cast that glass away, Nor in its Chrystal face thine own survay; What can be free from Loves imperious laws, When painted shadows real flames can cause? The fires may burn thee, from this mirror rise, By the reflected beams of thine own eyes; And thus at last faln with thy self in Love, Thou wilt, My Rivall, thine one martyr prove; But if thou dost desire thy forme to view, Look in my heart, where love thy picture drew, And then if pleas'd with thine own shape thou be, Learn how to love thy self by loving me. [74.] Number the sands that do restrain Number the sands that do restrain And fetter the rebellious main, count those pale fires that do dispence To us both light and influence, The drops of the vast sea divide, These in themselves be multipli'd; That all when added into one, May by our kisses be outgone; By which when number they surmount, Wee'l teach Arithmetick to count. Song 75. This silkworm (to long sleep retir'd) This silkworm (to long sleep retir'd) The early year hath re-inspir'd, Who now to pay to thee prepares The tribute of her pleasing cares; &amp; hastens with industrious toyl To make thy ornament her spoyl; See with what pains she spins for thee The thread of her own destinie; Then growing proud in Death, to know That all her curious labours thou Wilt, as in Triumph, deign to wear, Retires to her soft sepulchre. Such dearest, is that hapless state To which I am design'd by Fate, Who by thee (willingly) or'ecome, Work my own Fetters and my Tombe. Song 76. Pale envyous sickness Pale envyous sickness, Hence no more possess Our breast too cold before; in vain alass thou dost invade Those beauties which can never fade; Could all thy malice but impair, On those sweets which crown her fair, Or steal the spirits from her eye, Or kiss into a paler dye, The blooming roses of her cheek, Our suffering hopes might justly seek Redress from thee, and thou might'st save Thousands of lovers from the grave; But such assaults are vain, For she is too divine to stoop to thee; Blest with a form as much to high for any change but Destinie; Which no attempt can violate, For what's her beauty is our fate. [77.] Come my Dear Come my Dear, whilest youth conspires Aith the warmth of our desires; envyous time about thee watches, And some Grace each minute snatches: Now a spirit, now a ray From thy eye he steals away, Now he blasts some blooming rose Which upon thy fresh cheek grows; Gold now plunders in a Hair; Now the Rubies doth impair of thy lips; And with sure hast All thy wealth will take at last; Onely that of which thou mak'st Use in time, from time thou tak'st. [78.] When thou thy plyant arms dost wreath VVhen thou thy plyant arms dost wreath About my neck, and gently breath Into my Breast that soft sweet air With which thy soul doth mine repair; When my faint life thou draw'st away, My life which scorching flames decay, Orecharg'd my panting bosome boyls, Whose Feavour thy kind Art beguiles, And with the Breath that did inspire Doth mildly fan my glowing fire, Transported then I cry, above All other Deities is Love! Or if a Deity there be Greater then Love, 'tis only thee. [79.] As on Purple Carpets As on Purple Carpets I Charm'd by wine in slumber lie, With a troop of Maids (resorted There to play) me thought I sported: Whose companions, lovely boyes, Interrupt with rude noyse: Yet I offer made to kiss them, But o'th'sudden wake and miss them: Vext to see them thus forsake me, I to sleep again betake me. Song 78. With a whip of Lillies VVith a whip of Lillies, Love Swiftly me before him drove: On we courst it through deep floods, Hollow valleys, and rough woods, Till a Snake that lurking lay Chanc'd to sting me by the way: Now my soul was nigh to death, Ebbing flowing with my breath; When Love, fanning with his wings, Back my fleeting spirit brings; Learn, saith he, another day Love without constraint t'obey. Song 81. When my sence in wine I steep VVhen my sence in wine I steep, All my cares are lull'd asleep: Rich in thought, I then despise CrÃ¦sus, and his royalties: Whilest with Ivy twines I wreath me, And sing all the world beneath me; Others run to martial fights, I to Bacchu's delights; Fill the cup then boy, for I Drunk then dead had rather lie. Song 82. Vex no more thy self and me Vex no more thy self and me With demure philosophie; Hollow precepts, onely fit To amuse the busie wit; Teach me brisk Lyeus rites; Teach me Venus blithe delights; Jove loves water, give me wine; That my soul ere I resigne May this cure of sorrow have; There's no drinking in the grave. [83.] Old I am, yet can (I think) Old I am, yet can (I think) Those that younger are out-drink; when I dance no staff I take, but a well fill'd Bottle shake: He that doth in war delight, Come and with these arms let's fight; Fill the cup, let loose a flood Of the rich Grapes luscious blood; Old I am, and therefore may, Like Silenus drink and play. Song 84. A Kiss I begg'd A kiss I begg'd, and thou didst joyn Thy lips to mine; Then, as afraid snatch'd back their treasure, And mock'd my pleasure, Again my Dearest, for in this Thou onely gav'st desire, and not a kiss. [85.] Fair Rebel to thy self, and Time Fair Rebel to thy self, and Time, Who laugh'st at all my tears, When thou hast lost thy youthful prime And age his Trophie rears, Weighing thy inconsiderate pride Thou shalt in vain accuse it, Why Beauty am I now deny'd, Or knew not then to vse it? Then shal I wish ungentle Fair Thou in like flames mayst burn; Venus, if just will hear my prayer, And I shall laugh my turn. [86.] A Dialogue Between CHARIESSA and PHILOCHARIS. Char. VVhat if Night should betray us, and reveal To the light all the pleasure that we steal? Phil. Fairest, we safely may this fear despise; How can she see our actions who wants eyes? Char. Each dimne star and the clearer lights we know Nights eyes are; they were blind that thought her so: Phil. Those pale fires onely burn to yeeld a light T'our desires, and though blind, to give us sight. Char. By this shade that surrounds us might our flame Be betray'd, and the day disclose its name. Phil. Dearest Fair, these dark Witnesses we finde Silent are, Night is dumbe as well as blinde. Chorus. Then whilest these black shades conceal us, we will scorn The envyous morn, And the Sun that would reveal us; Our flames shall thus their mutual light betray, And night with these joys crown'd outshine the day [87.] Dialogue II. Between PHILOCHARIS and CHARIESSA. Phil. That kiss which last thou gav'st me, stole my fainting Life away, Yet (though to thy Breast fled) my Soul still in mine own doth stay. Weak Nature no such power doth know, Love only can these wonders show. Char. And with the same warm breath did mine Into thy bosome slide, There dwel contracted unto thine, Yet still with me teside; I. Chorus. Weak Nature no such power doth know, Love onely can these wonders show. II. Chorus, Voyces 3. Both souls thus in desire are one, and each is two in skil, Doubled in Intellect alone united in the Will; Weak Nature no such power doth know, Love onely can these wonders show.</field>
