      <field name="fulltext">TO THE Most Reverend FATHER in GOD WILLIAM, Lord ARCH-BISHOP of CANTERBURY, Primate of all ENGLAND, and Metropolitan, And one of his MAJESTIES most Honourable PRIVY COUNCIL.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Upon a Paraphrase of Salomon's Song, Done by his Worthy Friend, Dr. Samuel Woodford. Whilst Thou with Sacred Rage inspir'd dost Sing The Mystic Song of Songs, can Cold Age bring An Offering fit? Or, without Fire, devote True Zeal to Verse? Or can I tell by rote Thy Praises without measure due? Shall I Confound Thy Consort then, or Modesty Prophane in Print? No, let me silent be A Monumental Foyl to Poetry and Thee. Nicholas Stuart. Baronet. ODE. To his Honoured Friend Dr. Woodford, On his Excellent Paraphrase of SALOMON'S SONG. So Eastern Spices, and rich Gums send out In the warm Limbeck while they pant, A precious Vapour spreading all about, Which the cold Mass did seem to want; But urg'd with equal heat it up do's rise, The Active Spirit now more nimbly flies, Ascending Balm in Dew distils, And far-extended Air with fragrant Essence fills. An holy Fire, Woodford, in Thee has rais'd, Numbers so sweet, so rich, and high, Methinks I see Thy eager Soul amaz'd, In its blest lyric Ecstasy, Melting away in Stream of fairest Verse; Which when to Mortal Ear Thou do'st rehearse, With purling Noise it seems to move, Its Music Charms th' attending Ear, the Soul it's Love. Hail blessed Flame, that did'st such Verse inspire! And to an humble Heart dispense, From the chast Touch of an Harmonious Lyre, Such Angel sounds, such Mystic sense: High God of Love's Love unto Man he sings; The Spouses choicest Beauties are the Kings: Who pour'd his Blood, here sweetly pours His Soul out to his Spouse in these Divine Amours. Immortal Love! Cement of this huge Frame, Dearest First-born of the Mind, Who wer't become Impure Romance, a Name, Thee undebauch'd where could we find? Yet art indeed wise Natures beauteous Child, Till with the Bodies fouler steam defil'd; Here rais'd to Soul and Mystery, All pure, all holy thou art agen, Love Travestie. Wisest of Kings and Men, was there sent down A double Portion of Thy Rage? And Heavenly Laurel this chast Brow to Crown? Greater than Men and Kings did engage, Thee, happy Wordford, to this lofty Song; Touch't from his Altar with a Coal thy Tongue: Then we, and no prophane Thought neer, May say a greater too than Salomon is Here. W. Croune. M. D. Fellow of the Colledg. To my dear Old Friend, the Reverend Dr. Samuel Woodford, On his Sacred Rimes. I Well! since it must be so, so let it be, For what do Resolutions signifie, When we are urg'd to Write by Destiny? II I had Resolv'd, nay, and I almost Swore, My Bed-rid Muse should walk abroad no more: Alas! 'tis more than time that I give o're: III In the Recesses of a private Brest, I thought to entertain your Charming Guest, And never to have boasted of my Feast: IV But see (my Friend) when through the World you go, My Lacquy-Verse must shadow-like pursue, Thin, and Obscure, to make a Foil for you. V 'Tis true, you cannot need my feeble Praise, A lasting Monument to your Name to Raise, Well-known in Heav'n by your Angelique' Layes. VI There, in indelible Characters They are writ, Where no pretended Heights will easie fit, But those of Serious, Consecrated Wit. VII By immaterial defecated Love, Your Soul it's Heavenly Origin doe's approve, And in least dangerous Raptures soar's above. VIII How could I wish (Dear Friend!) unsaid agen (For once I rank'd my self with Tuneful Men) Whatever dropt from my unhallowed Pen! IX The trifling Rage of Youthful heat, once past, Who is not troubled for his Wit misplac'd! All pleasant Follies breed regret at last. X While Reverend Don's, and noble Herbert's Flame, A glorious Immortality shall claim, In the most durable Records of Fame. XI Our Modish Rimes, like Culinary Fire, Unctuous and Earthy, shall in Smoke expire; In odorous Clouds your Incense shall aspire. XII Let th' Pagan-World your Pious Verse defy— Yet shall they envy, when they come to Die,, Your Wiser Projects on Eternity. Thomas Flatman. A PARAPHRASE ON THE Canticles, In English Rhythms. ?? ????????? ????? ???? ?????, ??? ?? ???? ??? ???????, [] ??? ?[] ?????????. V. Ad Ephesios, 32. ? ??????????? ??????. xxiv. Matth. 15. PERSONÆ. SPONSA. SPONSUS. CHORI tres. Primus AMICORUM SPONSI. Alter FILIARUM HIEROSOLYMITANARUM. Tertius MULIERUMèGENTIBUS. ???? ????. I Avoid Prophane, avoid! for such as you There is no place, or listning here; They're Mysteries, which we sing, and but a few Receive them with a well-purg'd ear: To all beside of love they sound, Mock-love, that does from every Hill rebound, And is no Virgin, when the painted Eccho's found. II A Female Love that is, by a truer name Lust obscene, and dalliance call'd; For whom th' unhappy wretch, who has a flame, To fires of his own kindling's hal'd: Yet such an Empire has she gain'd, So universal, and so well maintain'd, That Verse, as well as Men, she'has to'her service train'd. III Ah Verse, that e're thou shouldst be thus abus'd, That thus thy self thou shouldst abuse! The Devil, thy enemy, wisht thee ne'r worse us'd, Than thou thy self, thy self dost use: Quit, quit, thy Chains, er'e 'tis too late, At length return to thy' unimprov'd estate, Lawrels yet grow at th' Altar, where thou first didst wait! IV Lawrels there grow, and there's a Love Divine, Which will compleatly fill Thy Song; A Love that's Heav'n-born, truly Masculine, From whom thou' hast banisht been too long: Only return'd, this caution take, As solemn as thou canst new homage make, Both for Thine own defence, &amp; Thy chast follow'rs sake! V And thou, my LIEGE, bright and immortal LOVE, Who er'e Thou mortal Flesh didst take, Descending from Thy azure Throne above, An Image of Thy self didst make, In which soft thoughts thou didst inspire, And threw'st large portions of æthereal Fire, To consecrate the shrine, where Thou wouldst in time retire; VI Thou, who e're made Man, wouldst as Man be known, And transports infinite to' express, Sustaind'st a part, which was no more thine own, Than as each greater holds its less, Wouldst love, and as a Lover sue, In Words, and Acts, as Mortal Lovers do, And thus THY SELF, thus thy BELOVED to us shew: VII Shewing us thus, as we could it conceive, What had from Ages hidden lain, The Glorys Thou designd'st Thy SPOUSE to give, And what to 'effect them was thy pain, Flesh of our Flesh, Bone of our Bone, Pure GOD, and perfect MAN, in person One, The' Great-grand-sires Father, and his Virgin daughters Son: VIII In Thine own Words this Myst'ry to unfold, Or still to fold it, guide my Verse; Inspire me, as Thou Salomon didst of old, That I the Wonder may rehearse: And when of Love the terms I use, (Thy self its softest terms didst not refuse) The softest to me' indite, the chastest for me chuse! IX Make my Verse soft, but make it chast withal, These are the Beauties I desire, Witness Thy self, whom I the Witness call, How pure, and earthless is my Fire: That pure, and earthless it may shine, Reader, and Writer from all dross refine, And Thine own Image stamp for'ts guard, on Thine own Coyn! Cap. I. CANTICUM Canticorum Salomonis. DIVINI AMORIS ECSTASIS Quæ &amp; PROTASIS. SPONSA. SPONSUS. SPONSA. Osculetur me osculo. Sponsa. I False Glozing World, in vain Juices and Herbs for me Thou dost compound; Juices and Herbs, which ne'r can ease my pain, Or heal an inward bleeding Wound: With love (alas!) I'm pierc't to th' heart, Beyond Thy skill, or helpless Physicks art. II Come then, thou heav'nly LOVE, And with Thee thine own sov'raign Med'cine bring: Come! and the cause of all my griefs remove, That I Thy mighty praise may sing: Ah! put Thy sacred Lips to mine, And let's mix souls, as we chast Kisses joyn! III Dear Kiss! how sweet it was! Above those Spirits, which gen'rous wines exhale; Like perfume how it fill'd the ambient space, And in its passage ravisht all, Virgins, who but Spectators came: Sweet are Thy kisses LOVE; sweeter Thy Name. IV Only to see my LORD They came, but now like me are all on fire; Draw me, O, draw me by Thy pow'rful Word, One pace shall shew our joynt desire: Both they, and I will follow Thee, And Thy unransom'd Captives ever be. V Thy Love at length, blest King, Where all her fears may have an happy end, Into thy Nuptial Chamber please to bring, Where we Thy praises may intend, And firmly of Thy self possest, Our Mouths with singing fill, with joy our Breast! VI With songs Our Mouths We'll fill, And to exalt Thy Glories never cease; The Od'rous dews, which from Our Lips distil, Shall give Thy Land a rich encrease: Above all Wines Thy Love wee'll raise, And just Men with us shall record Thy praise. VII I'm black, 'tis true, but so, Fair Daughters of Jerus'lem, as the Tents Of Sun-burnt Arabs, humble, dark, and low, But full of Regal Ornaments; Or as those Curtains Salomon Draws to conceal from vulgar sight his Throne. VIII Unjust you 're to despise A Face, which only wants your beaut'ous Charms; My Country Sun (alas!) has stain'd my Eyes, And robb'd them of so potent Arms: From his too near approach I took What thus you gaze at, my discolour'd look. IX My Mothers Sons beside, Careless what burden they on me did lay, And angry too, to' a Vineyards scorching side, Bound my attendance every day: Their Vines too' unfit to keep, when my' own, With weeds, for want of dressing, were o'regrown. X Dear LOVE, by whom I'm freed And to a nobler Service now design'd, Tell me, O tell me, where Thy Flocks do feed, And what cool shades, at Noon they find; Why should I from Thee go away, And to the Tents of other Shepherds stray? SPONSUS. Si ignoras te, O Pulcherrima. Sponsus. I Fairest of Women, beaut'ous Shepherdess, If hitherto Thou hast not known What walks thy Faithful Shepherd does possess, And where my Flocks find shade at Noon, This narrow Tract, will to our Sheepcots lead, Where thy Kids may securely rest, and safely feed. II But, ah, how ill with simple Swains agree Those beauties, which are all Divine? Pharao in triumph born, compar'd to thee, Does with unequal glory shine; And tho exalted in his Chariot high, With more of pomp, wants of thy real Majesty. III To those, who need them, Chains and Bracelets leave, My Love has beauties of her own; Beauties, which no advance from Art receive, Nor owe their flame to' a sparkling stone: For when these Ornaments she please to wear, Jewels take lustre from her Eyes, gold from her Hair. IV Enough 'tis that she any place will yield, Near her, for things I've common made, As flints ith' City, and as grass ith' Field, And with them deigns to be array'd: Tho at her feet the rich Embrodery, Low as the Earth its bed, worn in her Train does ly. SPONSA. Dum esset Rex in accubitu suo. Sponsa. I My LOVE, my King, when from thy Fold Return'd, Thou shalt with me sit down, The Pris'ner in my Arms I'll hold, And his Head with Spik-nard crown: He 'twixt my Breasts shall sleep all Night, And flames inspire pure as the Mid-day light. II The spicy East, Father of Gums, Deserves not to be nam'd with Thee, From whom his Myrrh, and Virtue comes, Thy self the true Myrrh-bleeding Tree: Engaddis Camphire, when it blows, Near Thee does all its scent, and spirits lose. SPONSUS. Ecce tu Pulchra es amica. Sponsus. Worthy my Love, how art thou fair, Beyond what mortal Women are! Chast, and inno'cent, as a Dove, Full of mild, and spotless love, And from whose Eyes a ray does shine, Than Doves more bright, and as Thine own Divine. SPONSA. Ecce tu Pulcher es Dilecte. Sponsa. Not I, t'is Thou, my LOVE, art fair Bright as the Sons of Heaven are; And those perfections Thou giv'st me, Are what I first receiv'd from Thee, In whom, as in their true Original they be. Come then, my HEART, lo, all around, With Greens our Bed, with Flow'rs I've strew'd the ground! Come, let us sit down, and beguile, Unmist the weary Hours a-while; And when the Night recals us home, T'our Cedar Palace we will come, And of each others Love possest, With jealous boadings unopprest, On beds of Iv'ry take our chast and welcome rest. Cap. II. EVOCATIO SPONSÆ. SPONSUS. SPONSA. SPONSUS. Ego Flos campi &amp; Lilium, &amp;c. Sponsus. Earths glit'tring stars, vying with those above, Fair Rose, and Lily, emblems of my love, As far as mortal Flowers proportion bear To Love, and Beauties, which immortal are, How gay you look, how pure your flame does shine, Fit to resemble, tho not equal mine! My Dearest is a Lilly too, Tho in differ'nt scites we grow, I ith' rich Valley, she on the' hard cliffs wrinkled brow. With Thorns, and Brambles girt around, The Plant not to defend, but wound. Yet ev'n thus plac'd, with such a foil, As is the Curse of any soil; Tho Lilies one with Thorns compare, Lilies 'mongst Thorns are yet less fair, Less beauteous, and less gay, And all their glories less display, Cloath'd in pure, and genial light, Cloath'd or naked in their Virgin white, Than my BELOV'D, amongst the Daughters shows, With Grace upon her Lips, and terror on her Brows. SPONSA. Sicut malus inter ligna. Sponsa. I Too WELL, my LORD, too well I know, By what Thou hast compar'd me now, What to my self, what to Thy love I owe.

Ah me! e're yet his Words were done, So far remov'd hence, and so soon? But he'll return ? He comes, he comes, I see him come, The very Mountains make him room, And bow their Heads to yield him way; The Hillocks dart a brighter ray; Over the Mountain tops he skips, Light as the Wind, o're th' Hillocks trips: And now he's there, and now he's here, Swift as the fleet wing-footed Deer; And now behind our Wall he stands, Looks at the Window, and commands My' attendance, at the Lattice, with his beckning hands. Nay he speaks too, and I hear him say, “Rise up, my Love, my Fair one, come away! “Winter at length is past, and gone; “Look, how th' expected Spring comes on! “Apace it comes, on Zephyrs riding, “And the Rain, that stopt it chiding. “The Rain is gone too, and gives place, “And now appears a clearer face “Of Heaven, and Earth, than did before: “Enough of Storms, there's now no more. “Lo! how the Flowers lift up their heads, “And start out of their drousie beds. “Wak'd by the Quire of Birds, that sing “And Carol to the new-come Spring. “They sing, and dance from bough to bough, “As if they Winter ne're did know; “As if they Winter ne're did fear, “And 'twould be Summer all the Year, “And every Night, and every Day, “(Who more rich, or pleas'd, than they) “Unbidden, Pipe, and unrewarded, play. “The Fig-Tree too, on every twig, “Puts out its callow unfletcht Fig. “Unflesht, unripe, unripe tho' it be, “Hatc'ht at once by its Mother-Tree; “Born at one pang, without the throws, “The' hard teeming Olive undergoes, “That Gems, and Flowers, and flowring dies, “E're th' half form'd Embry'o up does rise: “Or the slow Vine its clusters brings, “That gentle Plant, made up of Rings, “Crispt, and curld, and wondrous sweet, “But modest too, and veild toth' feet. “Which in their courses, all attend, “And forth their Odours all do send, “The Springs to perfume, and thy way, “Rise up my Love, my Fair One, come away!

To one less deaf thy prayers direct, Whom as Thy self, but more they may affect: Make them, my Love, make them to me, And let me Her, who makes them see!

Come then of Heav'n, and me belov'd, And be to a better Seat remov'd! —SHE comes, she comes, I see her come, The Cliffs, that held her, make her room; And stoop their Heads, to plain her way, Our Lawns reflect her brighter ray! Take us the while, the Foxes take, Which in our Vineyards Burroughs make!

'Twas Night, a sad and dismal Night, Without one gleame of chearful Light; Silence, and horror seiz'd its place, And rioted ith' empty space; When wake'd with dread, Lo! all alone I found my self, my LOVE was gone. With trembling Hand, to find him out, I felt, I sought, but found him not. At last thus to my self I said, “I'le up, and see whither he' is stray'd: “Fearless the City compass round, “Nor give o're till my LOVE is found. “No labour spare ith' quest, or pains, “Through the broad Streets, and narrow Lanes, “But eve'ry Lane, and every Street, “Measure out with my weary Feet, “And thus, or find him, or thus prove, “My truth to His, and to my Love. I spake, I rose, but in vain sought, And tir'd my self, yet found him not. Him I found not, but they found me, Who the City-Warders be; And in their Night-walks compass it, Amaz'd a stricter Watch to meet, And thus themselves first askt to be, “Him, whom my Soul loves did you see? My steps scarce from them could I move, But I found Him my Soul does love. I held him fast, nor would let go my hold, Chast in my Love, and in his Favour bold, Till to my Mothers House I brought Him, And all my adventurous search had taught him, To the glad room, where I was born, But in my Birth less joyous than in his return. And now, fair Daughters of Jerusalem, Who are, and to your selves more glorious seem, In his attendance than your own fair stem; By the Hills, and by the Launs, By the Roes, and by the Fauns, By the Fields, and by the Woods, By the Springs, and by the Floods, All that I or you count dear, All he loves, and all I fear: I charge you, I charge you not to awake My LOVE from the rest, which now he does take, Till himself pleases the signal to make! CHORUS Amicorum Sponsi. Quæ est ista quæ ascendit per, &amp;c. Chorus. What fair One's that, who from the Desert comes, Strait as a Palm, and breathing Odorous Gums; Or like those Pillars, which from th' Altar rise, Of mystic Smoak, on which Heav'ns Pavement lies; Th' expiring Soul of Myrrh, to its last abode Hasting, as if 'twould be it self a God? So choice a Beauty, and Divinely fair, A meen so lovely, and so bright an Air, Centred in whom all just Perfections meet, The Wise, the Good, the Awful, and the Sweet, Is only worthy him, whose sacred Love, None equal knows, but his, who reigns above. Behold his Bed (his Bed that's Salomons, As far as Heav'n admits comparisons) No Queen need dread the terrors of the Night, With such a Watch, so 'appointed, and so bright. About it Sixty valiant Grooms attend, Such as for triumph Israel forth do's send. All valiant Men, and expert all in War, Girt as in Fight her mighty Conquerours are; Each with his Sword upon his guarded Thigh, And able each an Army to defy, But whose united Forces all meet here, To keep the Post and drive thence grizly fear. A Chair the King, of Cedar too has made, The cleanest Trees that Libanus e're had, Whose Balli'sters are of finest Silver wrought, The floor of Gold, from Ophirs treasures brought; Its Cano'py of the richest Tyrian dye, Enough to upbraid a meaner Majesty. Such the Materials, but Art Divine, Ith' Workmanship does Nature far out-shine. For all with winged Loves tis Carv'd around, Love in more various postures ne're was found. Some on Heav'ns Message flying, from above, Thither advancing some our mortal love, Which all refin'd, like Prophets, others Preach, But learn of Sions Daughters, whom they seem to teach. —These are the shadows, fair One, of that bliss Awaits Thy love, and all are Myste'ries: Which none, but he that's Wise, can understand, Nor any write but with a guided Hand. SPONSA. Egredimini &amp; videte filiæ Sion. Sponsa. Daughters of Jerusalem, The fairest Sprouts of Sions stem, Come forth, my Friends, come forth, and see What mine, and what your Honours be! You well remember th' happy Day, (And well remember it, you may) When first your King receiv'd his Crown, King Salomon, and 'twas his own, Not of the Kingdom but of his Love; And it the fairer Crow'n did prove. From 'his Mothers Hands the joyful Son, On 'his Nuptial Day receiv'd the Crown. But such a Son, and such a Mother, Vying Glories each with th' other, And such a Crown, and such a Day, When in chast Joys dissolv'd they lay, The happy Bridegroom, and the Bride, And you, their Friends, on either side, If once again you'd wish to see, And greater Joys than those could be, Come, and my greater SALOMON behold, More glorious in his Love, than he in all his Gold. Cap. IV. CATASTASIS. DESIDERIUM. SPONSUS, SPONSA. SPONSUS. Quam Pulchra es Amica mea. Sponsus. I Behold Thou 'art fair, my Love, behold Thou art Fair, Let the World know, and know it Thou; But (alas!) what Thy hidden Beauties are, Nor thou, nor that, till by me taught, can know: Till Thee, by all that's Beauteous I compare, And after all rejoyn, Thou 'art yet more Fair. II Begin my Song! But where shall I begin? Ah! where, but with Thy Dove-like Eyes, Those Doors of Dia'mond, which first let me in, And of my Passion, were the Virgin prize? Love thence redoubled on me his thick stroaks, But, sallying forth, lay fetter'd in thy Locks. III Locks of that Head, which does like Gilead shine, When on the Golden Fleeces there, The jealous Sun, just ready to decline, Ith' mid-way stops, his Tresses to compare; But brighter far, and longer too are they, Than Sun-beam, in the fairest Summer-day. IV Such is thy Hair, thy Teeth like couples thence, All washt in Aenons streams, and shorn; In Aenons Silver streams, and rising whence, To th' joyful shearing House new washt they' are born: Each has its make, and Twins they bear all round, Nor is a barren One ith' number found. V And as Thy Teeth, such are Thy Lips, their Fence, The purest Wooll, with the' noblest Dye; And every graceful Word, that's uttred thence, On purple Wings, to Thy' lovers Heart does flie; Thy Cheeks, hid under Thy bright Curls, appear Like shaded Pomgranates, but shine more clear. VI But, O, Thy Neck, that Tower impregnable, How full of Beauty, and of Dread? Like that of David, built for a Cittadel With thousand spoyls of the' Living and the Dead. A thousand Shields of th' Mighty hang up there, All mighty Shields, and but thy Necklace are. VII Yet such a Cittadel, and such a Tower, To guard those Twins there was but need, Those two Roe-twins, of all the Herd the Flower, Which under it, among the Lillies feed; Thy two fair Breasts, which yet to Lillies give A tincture brighter, than they thence receive. VIII Till the Day come, my Love, the Bridal-Day, For which thou less than I dost long; Till the Nights shadows swiftly flee away, A while I'll leave Thee, a little while be gone: To th' Hills of Myrrh, and Frankincense I'll go, And fetch the Morning, as it 'gins to blow. IX Yet (ah!) I cannot leave Thee, Love, thus soon, My Love thus soon I cannot leave; Our Flocks may graze, for 'tis yet scarce High-noon, And we, till Folding time, the Hours deceive. Thou art all fair, my Love, all fair Thou art, And first I'll die, e're from Thee thus depart. X Rather a while, my Love, let 'us hand in hand, To Liban walk, and Amana; Shenir, and Hermon, which large views command, And thence see how our Lambs do feed and play, Whether unscar'd they from the Lions rest, Or Leopards paws, and where the' next Folding's best. XI They' are safe, my SPOUSE, they' are safe, but (Oh) my heart, SISTER, my Heart (Oh) where is't gone? For gone it is, I know, by the' pleasing smart; Welfare poor Heart, that's from its Master flown! But this one glance, one Eyes bright glance has done: Who's proof for both, if thus Thou wound'st with One? XII Yet as Thou' hast tane my Heart, so keep it fast! A single Chain is strong enough, One link o'th' Chain, with which thy Neck is grac'd, To hold, fast hold a never starting Love; My SPOUSE, my SISTER, I'm Thy Captive made, Bind him, nor of Thy Priso'ner be afraid! XIII A willing Captive, Prisoner of Thy love, Which guess how strong, and fair it is; So strong 't has drawn me from my Throne above, And truly hides a God in this disguise: So fair, that Thee no less to Heav'n 't shall raise, To Crown Thy Maker with Immortal Bays. XIV But this, till to' Heav'n we come, I'll let alone, Nor canst Thou understand it yet; Wherefore Thy Love by things to Thee well known, As thou canst bear, I will before Thee set; To Wine compare 't, tho better 'tis than Wine, And all Thy Odours are of race Divine. XV Thy Lips, my SPOUSE, drop as the Hony-comb, Hony and Milk are in Thy Tongue; Some drops for Susten'ance, and for Med'cine some, The Weak to nourish, and confirm the Strong: Like Libanus, Thy perfum'd Garments smell, Liban, that does all Mounts, for Sweets excel. XVI All, but that Garden, in the holy Mount, Where I design three Nights to lie, In Spices wrapt, as Prophets shall recount, And notice give the World, when the' time draws nigh: Yet such a Garden, and so sweet art Thou, My SPOUSE, my SISTER, when Thy Spices blow. XVII A Garden fenc'd, and all enclos'd around, Lockt up, and double is the Key, With a quick Spring, that waters the' holy Ground, And all its parching Fervors does allay; But so seal'd up, the curious passer by With Foot ne're soild, ne're saw it with his Eye. XVIII To none but its own sacred Plants it flows, Making the place a Paradise, Where nothing noxious, or forbidden grows, Nothing, but what will make one truly wise: Or make, or please, or truly keep one so; For all there planted, as its Trees do grow. XIX The Pomgranate is there, and there the Date, The Spikenard, and the Cypress Tree, Spikenard and Saffron, and hither brought of late, The sweet-Cane, Cinamom, and all sorts that be Of Frankincense, Myrrh, Aloes, and a Train Of Princely Spices, wont in th' East to Reign. XX There Reign they, but here serve my Love, and me, Whose Fountain all their drought supplies, And flows so largely, constant, and so free, Th' whole World may have for its necessities: Jordan that sacred, and perpetual Flood, Had not more streams, when like the Sea on heaps it stood. SPONSA. Surge Aquilo &amp; veni Auster. Sponsa. I Father Winds, that gently ride, On downy Feathers, through the Skie, You, that ith' cold North abide, And Southern Gales, which cold defie!

III Then on your Wings the Perfumes take, And bear them with you gently Home; More grateful your return they'll make, And th' young Winds wonder whence you come. IV But why, O Winds, first call I you, Let my BELOVED rather come! More than your Gales his Breath can do, Not show, but make my best Perfume. V Why comes he not? Ah! where's the Lett?

II So pleased I was with each choice delight, And delights such as Thine I but rarely meet; That, scarce knowing how, I forgot my self quite, Nor took time enough to choose only the sweet; My Hony and Hony-comb at once devour'd, And with my Wine, Milk into the Bowl pour'd. III Chear up, my Friends, and eat your fill, Chear up, and eat, here's store enough, Thanks to my bounteous Love, And drink, drink plenteously, what each one will! “Who fears excess, or fondly thinks to spare, “Disparages that Heav'n, whose Guests we are.

All as I slept, but with my waking mind, (My Heart slept not, tho sleep my Eyes did bind, And on my Temples his soft Fillet ti'd, But as I slept and) dead to all beside, Liv'd to my LOVE, a Voice I seem'd to hear, A shrilling Voice, and pitteous, pierc't my ear; A Voice well known, 'twas my BELOVED's Voice, And at the Door he made th' appointed Noise, Knocking, and calling, Why comes not my Love? “Open my SISTER, my 'Undefil'd, my Dove, “Open, I pray Thee, nor be so unkind, “Thus to treat him, who's come thy Love to find; “A long, and weary Journey come ith' Night, “Weary and wet, by the Moon's dusky Light. “Lo! how my Head with the moist Dew is fill'd, “And the Nights drops through all my Curls distill'd! “And art Thou come, I flatteringly repli'd, “But why, my Dear, so late, without a Guide? “I fear it much, but (ah!) I'm now in Bed; “And many a sad distrust nights horrors breed, “He're in the dark, ith' dark here all alone; “My Vest's put off, How shall I put it on? “My Feet are washt too from the Days foul soil, “Nor with new sullies would I them defile. “O, how I tremble, and would gladly rise, “But dare not, (Oh!) I dare not, LOVE how dark it is! I spake, but 'twas excuse: To be deni'd, Unwilling he, still for admission cry'd. Drawing the Latch, and lifting with his Hand The easie Door; grieving he thus should stand, My Heart was in me mov'd, and I began To pitty him, and my' unjust self disdain; At his so meek attendance did relent, And of my own unlovelike words repent. So up I rose in haste, to let him in, Who was my LOVE, and had so patient been. I rose, and to the Door like Lightning flew, To th' very place, where he the Latch first drew. My Hands dropt Myrrh, which on the Door he left, Pure Myrrh, in eve'ry chink of th' Door, and cleft, Myrrh on the Lock, in every ward was Myrrh, And Myrrh, where every busie Finger I could stir. But opening,—Woe's me! he was gone; Himself, my dearest LOVE, had thence withdrawn. My Soul was gone too, roused as I lay, And heard him speak, but with him fled away. So pensive, all about I for him sought, Sought curiously about, but found him not: Call'd him by Name, begg'd his return to have, I call'd, and sought, but he no answer gave. Nor hear, nor find him could I, but they found me, They, who the Warders of the City be: Unlike in Court'sie, tho alike in Name Those Just ones, to 'whom in my first search I came, Who let me pass unwrong'd; these barba'rously Struck, and did more than strike, have wounded me: And though by place, and office bound to look No' assaults be made, my torn Vail rudely took. But you, fair Daughters of Jerusalem, From whom much better things to hope I seem, Worthy your selves, and worthy your bright stem. If you chance my Love to find, Virgins, be to' a Virgin kind! If you chance my LOVE to meet, Virgins, be to a Virgin sweet! Sweet, and kind so Love to y'ou be, As you are kind, and sweet to me!

Help, help me LOVE, to give each part its grace, Nor from my humble Verse, or Heart, their Lines efface! WHITE, and ruddy is my LOVE, As when the Rose and Lilly strove. White and pure, as Mid-day Light; Ruddy as Clouds that flie the Night, And e'en or'e-taken blushing run, Blushing to o're-take the setting Sun, And with him in the Sea headlong plunge down. The Banner worthy 'alone to bear, Under which Myriads listed are. Around his Head a Ray divine, Bright as the purest Gold does shine. His Locks as any Raven black, Hang in loose Curls a-down his Back. His Eyes like Doves by' a Rivers side, Well set, and with a decence wide, As washt in Milk, are lovely white, But sparkling Fire from the killing sight. His Cheeks with spicy mixtures flow, Flourets ith' downy Borders grow. His Lips the choicest Myrrh distill, Lillies the parting Valley fill. His Hands with Rings of Berril set, Of Jacynct, and of Chrysolet. His Chest's like polisht Ivory, Where Veins of liquid Saphir lie. Two Pedestals of solid Gold His Marble-pillar'd Thighs uphold. Libanus only is his Peer, Ith' fairest Cedar growing there. Strait as a Cedar and as tall, (By Trees to express the Natural) But when he speaks, so 'himself he is, With every Grace, and every Bliss, Whole Liba'nus is unfit to be, With all its stores, the Pourtraict of his Deity. Such, fair Daughters of Jerusalem, Such is my LOVE, and such my Friend; If such an One you chance to find, Seise him for me, when y'have by th' Marks discover'd him. VI. AMBITIO SPONSÆ.

II Ah! from me turn those killing Eyes away, Too piercing is their beauteous sight; I yield, my Love, I yield, Thou hast gain'd the Day, And all in vain I see it is to fight: Thou need'st but only look to overcome; And, bound in Chains, thy Captives are led home. III Chains of that Hair, that does like Gilead shine, When on the Golden Fleeces there, The jealous Sun, just ready to decline, Ith' Mid-Heav'n stops, his Tresses to compare; But brighter far, and longer much are they, Than Sun-beam in the fairest Summer-day. IV Such are Thy Locks, Thy Teeth like couples thence, All washt in Aenons Streams, and shorn, In Aenons Silver Streams, and rising whence, To th' joyful Shearing-house, new washt they' are born: Each has it's make, and Twins they bear all round, Nor is a Barren one ith' number found. V Thy Cheeks, which underneath Thy Temples lie, And there their modest blushes hide, In such a Vail, as does all Art defie, (Nature for Virgins does that Vail provide) Thy Cheeks, all vaild within Thy Curls, appear Like shaded Pomegranats, but shine more clear. VI Tho threescore Queens, and fourscore Concubines, And Virgins numberless there be; Ten thousand Virgins, Concubines, and Queens, Nor are, nor ever were so fair as She: She, who's my Dove, my Undefil'd, the One, Mine and her Morthers, more than all, alone. VII The Virgins saw her, and their blessings sent, Heav'ns tendrest blessings on her shour'd; As if th' officious drops they on her spent, Should on themselves again, in streams be pour'd: The Queens, and Concubines by different ways, Whom yet they envi'd, could not chuse but praise.

Sponsa. Ah! too o're curious, and too over-bold, What is't you'd in the Sulamite behold? What is't, when all that you can in her see, Are but the Lines of a tremendous Majesty. As when two Armies ready are to joyn, And with stern Looks, to th' onset give the Sign. VII. AMORES MUTUI. SPONSUS SPONSA. SPONSUS. Quam pulchri sunt gressus tui in calceamentis? Sponsus. Fair One, who dost from Loins of Kings descend, The King, whose Empire does o're all extend, Beyond those Worlds, which undiscovered lie, Ith' boundless circuit of th' All-embracing Skie, Let others, as they please, recount Thy praise, I from the ground its Monument will raise. Those parts of Thee which have the lowest place, But beauteous in their kind— Thy Feet, which on their well fix'd bases, bear The fairest Pile, that Nature e're did rear. How glorious are they, when Thou leadst Thy Flock, Or on Thy buskins rais'd, or in thy humble Sock? The juncture of Thy Thighs like Jewels are, The Work of the most fam'd Artificer. Thy Navil (nor let Scoffers here blaspheme The Mysteries of the New Jerusalem, Or to vile Lust debase the noble Theme.) But like a Goblet round Thy Navil is, Brim full, and flowing with the richest Juice. Thy Belly pregnant with a numerous Train, Which Heav'ns void space, shall People once again. Like heaps of Wheat, with Lillies set around, Thy Children shew, and how their Mother's Crown'd. Thy Brest's like two Twin-Roes, and Twins they are, In all the Herd there's not a lovelier pair. Thy Neck is like a Tower of Ivory, Hung with the Trophies of Loves Victory. Thy Eyes surpass the Silver Streams, that run By Bathrabbim, to th' Pools of Essebon. Thy Nose, of perfect shape, like a Fort Royal stands, Off from Thy Cheeks, and th' under Plains commands. Or like Loves Labyrinth, by the Forrest side, Pointing, and to Damascus op'ning wide. Thy Head's like Carmel, and Thy purple Hair, The brightest Dye th' Assyrian Fleece can bear. Fetter'd in its soft Chains the King doth lie, Enamour'd of the Bands of his Captivity. How fair art Thou! how made for all delight! Slender, clean Limb'd, and, as a Palm, upright? Grow, happy Tree, the Queen of all the Wood, Grow, as Thou dost, less great than Thou art good! In whose warm Bosom, the Vines clusters rest, And shew, and seem themselves, the swellings of Thy Brest. Up to the Palm-Tree I'll ascend, I said, Palm in my Hand; with Palm Ill crown my Head; The blushing clusters with my Lips I'll seise, And all their winy juyce, rich Wines express: With which enflam'd, I'll cooling Apples take, Apples, the best repast that Lovers make; Apples, whose Cordial they the best can tell, Apples, which like Thy perfum'd Breath do smell. Apples, Thy Breath: Thy Speech is generous Wine, That sparkles in the Cup, and gives its shine; Moves it self right, to my Beloved goes, Goes as it can, and all its Wonders shows: Making the Lips of those, who sleep to speak, And at one touch their Chains and silence break. SPONSA. Ego Dilecto meo, &amp; ad me conversio ejus. Sponsa. I my BELOVED's am alone, And beside me has he none; None beside me does he love, Equal none, and none above. Mine he is and mine alone, And beside him have I none; None beside him do I love, Equal none, and none above. Come then my LIFE, ah! come away! Ith' City let's not ever stay; But look how our Fields do smile, And in the Villas lodg a while. There, with the Sun, We'll early rise, And visiting our Nurseries, See how the Vines their Branches spread, And the young Grape shoots forth his head: And how the Pomgranates do blow. But then my LOVE less ruddy show. My Loves there will I to Thee give. Loves in the Country happie'st live. The Mandrag's there, that Love excites, The Mandrag, chief in Loves delights; Which forward now, begins to 'appear, And fumes our Gates with it's Rosie Hair. With many a Fruit, and many a Flower, Which I will in Thy Bosom pour. Store of Pleasures, new, and old, More than can of Tongue be told. More, if possible, than enough, And all reserv'd for Thee, my LOVE. VIII. CATASTROPHE. SPONSA. CHORUS Gentium. SPONSUS. SPONSA. Quis mihi det te Fratrem meum? Sponsa. I love, but cannot yet my LOVE injoy, Ah! Love that Thou should'st have so much alloy! Still some nice thing to interrupt Our bliss, Something to fault, which yet we would not miss! This as I think, I wish Thou wert my BROTHER, Thou my Soul loves, the Son of my own Mother: How would I 'embrace Thee then, and kiss thine Eyes, Where e're I meet Thee, safe from base surmize! Home would I lead Thee to my Mothers House, And, by her taught, the happy Moment use; Talk o're our Loves, fill, fill the Wine, The spicy blood of th' Pomgranate and Vine. Satiate with which, Thou should'st thy Left-hand place Under my Head, whole me with the' right embrace. 'Tis done, and see he sleeps— Fair Daughters of Jerusalem, Who are, and to your selves more glorious seem, In our attendance, than your own bright Stem, By the Hills, and by the Launs, By the Roes, and by the Fauns, By the Fields, and by the Woods, By the Springs, and by the Floods, All that I or you count dear, All he loves, and all I fear: I charge you, I charge you not to awake My LOVE, from the rest, which now he does take, Till himself pleases the signal to make! CHORUS Gentium. Quæ est ista, quæ ascendit de deserto? Chorus. What fair One's that (but words can ne'er express How fair she is) who from the Wilderness, Leaning on her BELOVED's Arm ascends, And hitherward their amo'rous Journey tends. They 'are come, and now approach't so near, That wer't not rudeness, we their privacies may hear. SPONSUS. Sub arbore malo suscitavi te.

CHORUS Gentium, &amp;c. Soror nostra parva &amp; ubera non habet. Chorus. A LITTLE Sister yet we have, For whom we'd Loves assistance crave. Young, and little, though she 'is yet, And her Brest not fully set, Tho as yet no Breasts she has, Grow our Sister does apace. But if thus high Loves price does go, What shall we for our little Sister do, When the time comes, that we should her bestow? SPONSUS. Si murus est ædificemus super. Sponsus. If, when grown up, your Sister prove a Wall, We'll on her build a Silver Arcenal; Defence, and Ornament we'll to her give, And all her Stones shall, as ith' Quarry, live.

My constancy to guard the Fort does stand, And dares the rudest Shock, of th' roughest Hand. This as my WELL-BELOVED heard me say, The Holy Boast he did approve; And in his Eyes I found such grace that Day, I dare no longer doubt his Love. SPONSUS. Vinea fuit Pacifico in ea, &amp;c. Sponsus.

Compare we now our Vineyards, peaceful King! Which does to 'its Lord the greatest Profit bring? Thine for a thousand Pieces yields its store; Admit it do; 'tis worth two hundred more, But these the Keepers have: Mine is my own, Accountable for' its Fruits to me alone, (As for its care) and sharers have I none. Thou art that Vineyard, Love, my Vineyard Thou, Who in the Flowry Gardens dwellest low; Low, but with all the Stars of th' Garden crown'd, And Thy Companions sitting Thee around, Attent, and listning to Thy tuneful Voice; O, make me hear it, and fulfil my Joys!

THE LEGEND OF LOVE CANTO. I. I Song, which the God of Love did first inspire, Not he the blind, and sottish World calls so, No God, nor ought save a wild raging Fire, Which with incessant Bellows Lust does blow, But HE, to whom all things their being owe, In whom alone they live, in whom they move, And, by his Love made, to perfection grow, All who below adore Him, or above, The Mighty Lord of Hosts, the very GOD of LOVE, II Song, by the very God of Love inspir'd, And of a thousand more the sacred Chief, But wherein Salomon, from himself retir'd, Not what his Love, but what was his belief, (Songs ill became the cause of all his Grief, If love we to our Mortal Standart bring, Whose spoils are Robbe'ries, and whose God's a thief) Under Love's borrow'd name to th' World did sing, LOVE is the borrow'd Name, Holy Churches FAITH the thing, III Song, which the borrow'd Name dost understand, And all the Mysteries which in it lie, For 'tis the Dialect of the Heav'nly Land, Nor as to us it sounds does signifie, (Blest Souls in Love discourse with the most High) Thou, who knowst this, and more than this, whence came The profanation of the Deity, And how this lustful Earth took th' empty Name, Embracing sulphu'rous clouds, for its Gods purest flame, IV Tell the World, Song, whence first its madness grew! Who knows not th' World is mad? Thou best of all, Which, if 'twere possible Inno'cence to renew, To its first Inno'cence wouldst the World recal, And more than e're it lost ith' wretched Fall: By love Thou callst it, and the Voice is known, Well known's the Voice, but we too sensual, So brutish in our Lusts obscene are grown, That call'd by it's name, we think't an Idol of our own. V Yet none of ours is what we' have stol'n the name, That Idol, which we thus with Mirtles crown, But with our form from Heav'n at once it came, From Heav'n was with a Silver Cord let down, And into the Souls mass divinely thrown, To be its Salt, miraculously contriv'd; And first in Heav'n the name of Love was known, From whence at length it hither was deriv'd, And here a while such, and so call'd in pleasure liv'd. VI In pleasure 'it liv'd, and with its chang'd aboad, Strangely surprizd, was strangely pleas'd a-while, At first perceiv'd not the unusual load, But in her Face, who should betray 'it, did smile, As fearless, as unconscious yet of guile: And to a Body tho it were design'd, A Body, as the Land of its exile, All parts so' agreeable, and soft did find, Its Tour seem'd thence enlarg'd more, than confin'd. VII For all with Spi'rits it did converse before, It self a Spi'rit, but when the Eternal Mind To new displays of his creating Power, In beings of a lower Rank inclin'd, Which Angels yet should not come far behind; Soon as the great Resolve was past above, And Man of all those Works the Lord design'd, Love the first mover, and the last, did move, That He, whom all obey'd, o're all should rule by Love. VIII It mov'd thus, and the motion was embrac't, Als' Love, that made it downwards took its way; And viewing how the Bodies parts were cast, Seiz'd, with the Spi'rit, the scarce yet moulded Clay, Nor for partition, or nice choice did stay, But blending both together, seiz'd the whole; Both in the whole, whole both in each part lay, And both together making th' humane Soul, Th' unactive Matter did both quicken, and controul. IX The Spi'rit gave Life, with what to Life pertain, Sense, Motion, and the several Faculties, A cheerful, goodly, and a pompous Train, When rul'd, as they' ought, and manag'd by the Wise; The wise is Love, that th' whole unites, and ties, And which, where e're it undisturb'd does reign, Makes th' earthly frame, with th' Heav'nly sympathize, Nor to rebel dare any passion strain, When o're them reason, o're that love does hold the rein. X Thus ith' first happy Pair, a while Love reign'd, And but a while, with regal Soveraignty, Who to its Lore so early both were train'd, That Love it self, as rapt in extasie, Wondred what in dull Flesh the' effects might be: It wondred, but so chast, and innocent, So Love-conspiring every part did see, And so obsequious to its great intent, That Love it self enamour'd was of its descent. XI Forthy the happy pair, with sever'd flame, Which yet in both was one, to love inclin'd; Two downwards only, but rise'n whence it came, Again collected in one point, and joynd, And still the higher rise'n, the more refind; They lov'd, and so in Heav'n to love are seen Bright Seraphs, nor could Differe'nce be assignd, But that the Body here did croud between, There by pure Spi'rits was dressed out the mighty Scene. XII The new form'd Body here did croud between, But all to love was so dispos'd, and made, In either Sex, and with so Beauteous meen, That either seem'd with other well appay'd, And Love himself the Hymenæal said: (For Love's an He, who proud of what was done, And of Man most, as fairest there Pourtraid, The form assum'd, which likest was to' his own, And will but as a Male, when sung in Verse be known.) XIII Love said it, and Heav'n all he said approv'd, By signs authentick, which none durst deny; The new Creation in soft measures mov'd, And the whole World of beings, waiting by, Bow'd all a-down, and blest the Augury, They bow'd, and blest it, as they waiting stood, They bow'd, and blest it each, tho near so high, From the Angelic Natures, to the Brood Of Earth-born Vegetables, and God saw 'twas Good. XIV 'Twas good He saw for Man to have his Make, Man saw no less 'twas good for him to love, And in his Arms the Virgin Bride did take, With all the' endearments that affection move, Nor Hell that lookt askaunce could th' Rites reprove. In 'his Arms he took her, as Superiour, She, as one yet, who would be Conquer'd, strove, Till safe arriving at the Genial Bowre, And conquer'd both, Love each saluted Conquerour. XV There gentle purpose did they enterchange, And all the innocent delights, that make Blest Wedlock happy, nor did think it strange, Connubial pleasures to or leave, or take; For, nor him Inn'ocence did, nor her forsake, And they who think it did, or that the place, Or state forbad such use'ith fordice rake Of their own lusty-head, fouly miss the case, And on God's noblest Masterpiece retort disgrace. XVI Think so, who will for me, and bear the shame Of such sad thought; those just ones thought not so Nor God, nor Love, who kindled first the flame Wherewith they in desire alike did glow, Desire unhappy never till 't would know Secrets of knowledg unpermitted it, Unhappy knowledg, source of all our Woe, Unhappy Tree, ith' midst oth, Garden set, Unhappy seen, but tasted, more unhappy yet! XVII Forbidden therefore 'twas, but that alone, What else beside Man could, or wish, or crave, Enclosure, Limit and Restraint had none, Nor other Law than what Right Reason gave; Right Reason, unforc'd yet to be a Slave, To 'its under Ministers, a Lawless suit Of stubborn Lusts, when they the Mastery have, Less of the Man partaking than the Brute, And are the dire effects of the forbidden Fruit. XVIII Too dire Effects, if God had seen it fit, Which Natures Course disturb'd and alter'd so, That all the Bands, which held it were unknit, And quite revers'd the Pyramis did show, Above a Front unshapely, 'a point below: Thus while 'twas turning, but once set upon It's no Foundation, for so grim a Brow, Or which was but a point, as good as none, Down fell the Heap, Hell trembled, and the Earth did groan. XIX Love was that Pyramis, which whilst it stood, As fixt by Heav'n, on its own proper Base, (Matter, in Mankind, cemented by Blood Spiritous, where Sense had lowest place, Reason supreme) whole Nature did embrace; Which o're her Works such Robes of Beauty threw, And with such Rays did th' Universe enchase, That Instinct some, the' rest Inclination drew, Only to Love, and what was lov'd, by Love pursue. XX Love, and Fruition of their Kind, was the' whole, Whither to 'arrive, most Creatures did aspire, (By Sense led,) and arriv'd; but Man, whose Soul Had particles of an Æthereal Fire, Aim'd at Fruition too, but of what high'er, And more sublime, was laid up, than his Kind, Or that part of 'it his Flesh, whence to retire, In Innocence he found himself inclin'd, The beauties of his own, and of th' Eternal Mind. XXI His Kind he lov'd, as all things did beside, All things beside his Kind he also lov'd In their due Rank, but how to be apply'd To use, th' Hypothesis was to be prov'd, And thousand Stones to move, and be remov'd, E're Love he to so just an height could raise, As in his Intellect it was approv'd, That he from Earth to Heav'n by steps of Praise, Might hourly mount, and boldly tread God's secret Ways. XXII Deep in himself was the Foundation laid, And in those Acts, wherein he did partake With meaner Beings, for his Empire made, And of which some for Propagation make, By their first Institution, call'd Love by mistake, Whose sacred name they have engrost; but Love, Or cause, or sign of Love no more are, take But the Disguise off, as bare Acts they prove, Nor higher look, than 'tis Love naturally to move. XXIII These therefore were laid deep, and of the Pile, If ought, Substruction, consecrate to Night, The sense of Touch, too subject to beguile, Where Reason does not hold the Ballance right; Reason, wherein true Love, and pure Delight Only consists, and is the Fabricks Scale, Uninterruptedly to' ascend Heav'ns height, To him, who has the skill Heav'n thus to assail, And o're th' Omnipotent by almighty Love prevail. XXIV The first Man had that Skill, and of his Love, BEAUTY and GOOD the Object, he it sought In that bright Sphere, where it on High does move, And thither by Reduction all things brought, Which, in their Season, beautiful are wrought; All that in others, or himself he spi'd, Which of the Heav'nly Goodness Trace had ought; And by this Chain did an Ascent provide, To th' Foot-stool of that Throne, where its first Link was ty'd. XXV By view hereof He upward did ascend, Still upward, as he cast his curious view, The Higher any thing did upward tend, The better 'twas, and much more Beauteous grew, And with it from the Earth, Love upward drew: From th' Earth, of which once having lost the sight, Love more refin'd became, by Objects new, And all presented by a clearer Light, That did exhaust the Flesh, and ravished the Sp'rit. XXVI For having past at length the Atmosphere, By many a Stage, the Flesh was left behind; And now another Face of things appear, And other Beauties, that surprize the Mind, On which to gaze he did strange Pleasure find: And tho their Light excessive he scarce bear, Seeing above his Journey unconfin'd, Upward he presses still, and void of Fear, As perfect grown, above the Skies his Head does rear. XXVII Above the Skies he to those Heav'ns does mount, Step after step ascending, where there be For happy Souls, as sacred Writ does count, Mansions prepar'd, for their sublimity, The third Heav'n call'd, and 'its Furniture does see: With which he could delighted ever stay, But that advanced to the last Degree, That mortal Foot e're toucht, a farther way, By Wing to be dispatcht he' espies, Loves last Essay. XXVIII So on he claps his best, and largest Wings, And swift as thought, but more direct upright Than Eagle soars, into a Welkin springs, (If so it may be call'd) of Flame more bright, And pure, than what by this Worlds Sun, and Light, Can be compar'd; and in blest Extasy, With sacred Wonder, but without affright, Those fair Idæas contemplates, whereby Himself, and th' World was made, and there laid up do lie. XXIX Ascended hither, Love the place well knew, As whence himself into our World came down, Eve'n Man as nearer to his God he drew, New motions felt, and Powers before unknown; And swallow'd up in Speculation, Forgot what ever he admir'd below, Himself, and Her, whom he had left alone, To wait' his return, and rapt, he scarce knew how, To th' Land of Love, himself a Love transform'd did grow. XXX For why that Tract the Realm of Love was stil'd, And all, who thither in deducted mind, Leaving this lower Earth arrive, are fill'd, As the bright Region is, with thoughts refin'd, And Quintessence of Love; but of what kind, Impossible it is to be exprest, And in a Chime of soundful Words design'd, Which but Conceits are, to our Fashion drest, And if Immortal, with the mortal Load opprest. XXXI Suffice it, Angels there Inhabited, Rang'd all in their Trinal Triplicities, Into a Body, under Love their Head, And ready all for some Renown'd Emprise, Soon as the mighty Signal given is: He saw it given, and all before a Throne, Of Heav'nly Diamond, vailing each his Eyes, Each Angel prostrate on his Face falls down, And at its Foot-stool casts his Consecrated Crown. XXXII From simple Angels, as th' Inferiour Band, To the Archangels, led by Michael, Then to Dominions, that the third Rank stand, To Virtues then, whose numerous Banners swell, And Principalities, of whom none fell With Rebel Lucifer, 'or abbetted him, To Powers then, and to Thrones, whom who can tell? And so up to th' eighth Order, Cherubim, But by the ninth compleat, Love-flaming Seraphim. XXXIII All these our Father saw, by Love retir'd In, and above Himself, but o're them all, One fairer yet, to whom his Mind aspir'd, Th' Incomprehensible Original, In whom no Blemish, and no Spot can fall: By Love he saw Him, and in Him the end, And utmost point of Love, enough to' appall The Holie'st of his Sons, who should descend From' his after sinful Loins, and thither after tend. XXXIV But him the sight appall'd not, rather fill'd With Images more fair his enlarg'd Brest; And from the Principles his Love instil'd, On naught less high could he affix his rest, Or be content tho of the Earth possest: The' whole Earth, that in this Res'very view'd round, Too scanty seem'd an Heav'n-born Soul to' invest, Too scant a Limit, and too scant a Bound, For what an Infinite was only equal found. XXXV Excursions therefore into that he made, Often Excursions into Infinite, Infinite Love, and Beauties seen display'd I'th' Prototype, by Intellectual Light, And Reasons yet undim'd discursive sight: Tho when that fail'd, or when 'twas weary grown, Through 'excess of conceiv'd Vision, as it might, The' Almighties self would come in Person down, And oft prevent Man's journey to Him, with His own. XXXVI Or come, or send Him frequent Embassies Of Angels, who still ready on the Wing, With hasty flight, from summit of the Skies, Would seem to vie, who should the Message bring, And first approach the Favorite of their King: Tho all the Message, which they bore was Love, And all their Service was but Ministring To one below them made, yet who above, Was Heav'ns great Care, and greatest Ornament should prove. XXXVII Not much below them, while his Innocence, On its Foundation did unshockt abide, And perfect Love, seen in obedience, The nether World so fast to th' upper ti'd, That Hell between them could not once divide: One Heart, one Business was in both approv'd, One God alike, in both was magnifi'd, That mighty Axis, round which both were mov'd, And whom alike both prais'd, and whom alike both lov'd. XXXVIII Alike they lov'd, and as they lov'd alike, All Vertues in that Act did comprehend, Which did in both an awful Reverence strike, And careful made them, lest they should offend, But chiefly Man did thence his Mark intend, With greater vigour, as on whom was laid Fear for a Rein, if Hell its Wiles should send; For Death was threatned, if he disobey'd, And He not to be' high-minded, chose to be afraid. XXXIX Love made him chuse so kind, and wholesome Fear, From which all Torment yet secluded was, And but the brighter made his Love appear, Like Beams reflected upon burnisht Brass, That their own Native Lustre thence surpass: So shon his Love, and thence his Temperance, That the forfended Limit would not pass, Nor to behold it care'd with wanton Glance, What ever fond Conceit its Glories might enhance. XL Hence Justice, hence true Magnanimity, Prudence, and Wisdom, o're his Soul did flow, And sacred Truth, and peaceful Loyalty, And all the Graces, that to Love do owe Their Rise, and into' Eternal Rivers grow: And all upon the Supreme Beauty plac'd, That Good, which still the more we come to know, The more we' admire, till in its Arms embrac'd, An end of all our Love we find, the First, and Last. XLI Such was his Love, and like it was his Praise, A Service, wherein with him Nature joyn'd, Whole Nature, and each part, by several ways, As with him in one love they were combin'd; And various was the Anthems stops, and kind, Articulate by Man, their High Priest, made, And in one sacred Hallelu-jah twin'd, Which he, as First-Fruits, on Earths Altar laid, And Heav'n with grateful Odours early did invade. XLII Their Orisons, which he each Morning paid, With his fair Partner, or by Angels taught, Or whereof capable their Form was made, By Images from Heav'n first thither brought, And which they into perfect Figure wrought, By Plastic Art of Words harmonious; Which to the great Occasion came unsought: And whether sung in Verse, or said in Prose, In Prose most powerful were, in Verse most numerous. XLIII For Verse, and all that does to Verse belong (In this lowe'r World) had its first happy rise In Innocence, which first invented Song, And how so e're one may its Charms despise, Or which is worse, abuse, in Paradise, By Pause, and Fugue's, adapted to fit strains, Was first perform'd; to whose Discoveries The Sons of Verse now elocate their pains, And (save from Heav'n) expect no their Immortal gains XLIV In Paradise, discover'd first was Verse, And Voice, and Number with it given to Song, And glorious Subjects, which both did reherse, Alternate, and in Chorus, as or long, Or short returns did to the Ground belong; But than of Love they sounded nothing more, Or ofter, or with Brest more large, and strong, The Love Divine, whom thus they did implore In raptur'ous Odes, and (as they of it sang) adore. XLV They sang how All things their beginning had, From Loves diffusive, and Life-giving heat; How Immaterial Spirits, with Glory clad, Its First-born were, with Love as high, and great, As from this lower World's remov'd their Seat: Then how this lower World from Nothing rose, And No-where, in that beauteous order met, That Place, and Matter, which the whole compose, And circumscribe, unconceiv'd Luster did disclose. XLVI Not at an instant made, but by degrees, As confus'd Chaos could th' impression take, In Six Days space, and throughly purge its Lees, Hell newly form'd more horrible to make, And its own new made Enmities off-shake, For of such jarring Parts it was contriv'd, And of such contrarieties did partake, That it by Discord, and Confusion liv'd, (A life such as it was) with Death to be surviv'd. XLVII So strove they, thus would they have striven ever; Till pittying their debate, the Spirit of Love Calm'd the discordant Mole, and did dissever Th' Eternal Combatants, plac'd some above, Others did to the deep Abysse remove Fast to be held, in Adamantine Chain; Whilst those few Parts, that did more ductile prove, Into Four Principles, which all contain, Themselves in all contain'd, were solely left to reign. XLVIII FIRE, which as lightest took the highest place, And upward rais'd its towring Head; then AIR, That follow'd it, but with unequal pace, And tho it vy'd to be and look as fair, Forc'd in the midst to hang, self-ballanc'd there: Next WATER, which the Surface cover'd o're, That pregnant Mother of the EARTH, less rare, In its vast Womb conceiv'd, but which, before It could emerge, lackt mighty Love to force the Door. XLIX And so it did, but LIGHT was first to shine, And an whole Day, for that which makes the Day, But little enough was thought ith' Mind Divine, Through Darkness palpable to clear its way, And all its various Beauties to display: Darkness, which tho but counted Privative, Such claims to th' heap, whence 'twas call'd out, did lay, That Love like equal shares to both did give, Alternately, each Day, in Day, and Night to live. L But harder were the teeming Waters Throes, When on the second Day, Earth nearer came To its great Birth, like weight, that heavier grows, Long born, and to break through disjoynts the frame; The Waters pangs compar'd thus, were the same, When they divided burst, but ne're to close, Stopt by the solid FIRMAMENT, whose Name Immoveable Partition does suppose, By' whose Shoar disjoyn'd, upper and nether Ocean flows. LI And now the third Day of her Monstrous Child Half way deliver'd the Great Mother was; Monstrous, unsightly yet, with Horrour fill'd, Which in its Oasy Arms it did embrace, And, half supprest, to the' Birth would ne're let pass, But, with it joyn'd, one Monstrous Body made, Above DRY GROUND, below a confus'd Mass, Part Earth, with Briny Hatchments overlaid, Part unmixt Water, upon empty Nothing staid, LII And called SEA; as what appear'd was LAND; Rough, bare, mishape't, tho dry, unbeautifi'd, It self unbeautiful, vast plains of Sand, More horribly deform'd, with terrors Pride, Mountains, that to' Heav'n aspir'd, and gaping wide, With rais'd up Jaws, threatned to swallow down, In gorge unsatiate, glories there envy'd, And wrinkled Forehead, which scarce made did frown, And Omens give of Future War, from cause unknown. LIII Nor could there cause be gi'ven, for a new Face From the' Love Divine it took, and Nakedness Was cloath'd upon with all the Charming Grace Of Fruit, and Flower; and the grim Gyantess, (Its own Eternal Goodness to express) Kind Heav'n illumin'd with a double Light, The fourth Day made, the greater, and the less; By Day the SUN with vital heat, and bright, To warm, the MOON with starry Robe to' invest at night. LIV Nor was this all, but at the fifth Days dawn, Earth, and her Mother Sea replenished With new Inhab'itants were, and every Laune, And every Hill (scar'd Solitude thence fled) Legions of FOWL produc'd, and kindly bred, Which on large Wings, above the Ground did fly, But perching on some Tree, made that their Bed; Whilst Lakes, and Streams, and the huge Sea fast by, With mighty WHALES were fill'd, and with the lesser FRY. LV Fill'd were the Floods with these, but still the Earth, (As whose Wing'd-People most partook of th' Air, Their haunt) impregnate with a second Birth, For which disclos'd 't had room enough to spare, Did on the sixth Day to disclose prepare; And out all BEASTS, and REPTILS, in their kind, Sprang from the fertile Womb, proportion'd fair, Each to its Nature, but with Look declin'd, To th' Earth whence tane, to th' Earth whereto confin'd. LVI Of these, and other Works of God they sang, In Lays harmonious, as Love utterance gave; Yet these, and others, which they lowdly rang, Were but as Præludes, which, with Mast'ry brave, Their Voice shew'd, and what compass Verse might have: Verse which then triumpht in Recitative, When they all other Grounds resolv'd to wave, Sang of themselves, and Him, who at once did give One power to Sing thus to Him, and like Him to live. LVII A wondrous Work it was, from Nothing thus All things in weight, and measure up to raise, And perfect Order form'd most beauteous, Subordinate, as different were the Ways, Whereby their Maker would direct his Praise: But none so Wondrous did, and strange appear, Of Power and Beauty with so rich displays, As Mans Formation, made the Rule to bear, And sublim'd Earth equal to highest Heaven rear. LVIII That Dust could Live, in what was done before Was plainly told, but that it too could love, As Love all life in it contains, and more, All that or Reason knows, or can improve, Th' Eternal Treasures only were enough To drein, and to be drein'd: For God but spake, And all below, and all the Hosts above, Being, and Life from the great Word did take; But Hands Divine, Man's model were employ'd to make. LIX By Hands Divine, his Body first was wrought, The full Abridgment of this World to be; With curious Art, to 'its last perfection brought, But infinitely base, in its degree, To th' Soul the Pourtraict of the Deity, Into his Nostrils breath'd; that in his Brain Might be infixt the Heav'nly Ima'gry, And Life, with Vital Blood in every Vein, To th' Parts extream convey'd, the Character retain. LX Love was that Character, in Holiness, And perfect Purity exemplifi'd, And Innocence, which that first state did bless, And Reason with them Empire to divide, And o're th' Inferiour Appetite preside, Which it restrain'd, and furnisht with true Skill, It self, in all its Acts to curb, and guide; At least had power to do so, and fulfil The Charge Divine, close backt by Freedom of the Will. LXI Blest Qualities, which made him Lord and King, Of all this lower World, and Majesty On his Erected Countenance stampt, did bring Heav'n down to Earth, and Earth, that flat did lie, Advance'd to be for Angels Company; Nay farther, and what Angels did admire, For its Ætern Exemplar, the Most High, Who with his Work delighted, would retire Frequent from Heav'n, as to divert, and view it nighe'r. LXII Himself hereby Man dexterously did guide, And o're himself so absolutely reign, (The greatest Kingdom in the World beside, And which all other Kingdoms did contain, In 'it self in Chief, or Vassalages Chain) That only Peace, and only what was Good, And only Love was given for Love again; With Charms, that by no force could be withstood, And centred in one Point Indivisible GOD. LXIII Hail happy state of Innocence, thrice Hail! Hail to Thy Love and Thee! And may my Verse, From thence inspir'd, with generous Souls prevail, As they deserve, Thy Wonders to reherse, And through the World thy Sacred Name disperse! No Theam, like that, so high can Numbers raise, Or render more Humane Mankinds converse; For if there any Vertue be, or Praise, They in Perfection shon, in those first happy Days. LXIV Ah! that those Happy Days should be so few, Ended, cut off, e're scarce they were begun! Whose early Happiness, when known to Two, A Third crept in, by whom all was undone, And Love unthron'd hard drive'n away to run. Follow him, Muse, for if he should go wrong, Thou art in danger too, whose Fates are one With his; Nor canst Thou be without him long, But do it, if thou'hast Courage, in another Song. CANTO. II. I I OFT am thinking whether Love was known To the World Heathen, and what was their sense Of Man's, and His Origination; Or if of this first state of Innocence They any certain knowledg had, and whence The Notice was deriv'd, and to them came, Dark as it was; and turn o're Books, but thence Am little satisfi'd, find there the Name, 'Tis true, but Pillars of black Smoak instead of Flame. II Fiction I there find has so Truth disguis'd, That hard it is for one to know what's true; And, amongst all the Vanities they priz'd, How much, or little 'twas they truly knew, And ancient Faith obscur'd with Fancies new; Which diversly, as diffe'rent was their Art, They dressed out, and 'mongst the People threw, Part plain, with lame or monstrous Figures part, As in a scarce, or not discover'd Countrys Chart. III For there as We' Hippogryphs, and Satyrs place, Or Seas, or Carra'vans, when there's nothing found Of certainty, to fill the empty space, That each Man in his own sense may abound: Just so did they, but more the Truth confound, With Fable, as themselves it suited best, Who, so they did but keep the markt out bound, Convey'd them by Tradition, for the rest, Left it to others, as 'twas left them to be ghest. IV A Godlike therefore 'twas, and Golden Age, Tho little known to them, who call'd it so, And of it counted, fill'd with ancient rage, Not as it was, but did at distance show; Tho something, 'tis confest, they seem'd to know; And what they of it said, by chance was true, As to the main, if somewhat we allow, For the false Light, and those, who 'its Figure drew, In Plane, or Prospective, and were but Copiers too. V By Negatives the Plane was most design'd, And prov'd the Fairest, and the luckiest Draught; The Prospective was stiff, and more enclin'd To an hard confus'd roughness, scarcely brought To decence, done by Images they sought In their own Breasts, or Age, by Heav'nly Light Unlumin'd, and by false Priests blindly taught: Love only made o're all to take his Flight, Came nearest to the Truth, if understood aright. VI For by a Child they Love did represent, As his best Emblem, under which disguise, (For such it was) they hid with high intent, Or rather plainly shew'd those Mysteries, Which were conceal'd from base and vulgar Eyes; Native Simplicity, pure Innocence, Absolute freedom from all touch of Vice, An easie mildness Favours to dispense, And all those Graces, that its Actions influence. VII Not that they would that Ages Faults approve, In Lovers, but its Vertues thence propound; For tho a Child they made, and painted Love, Scarce such another Child ith' World was found, By whose soft Hands were fiercest Lions bound, Traind to his Yoke; the Course of Thunder staid; And all the Gods above, and underground, Which Gentilisms great Religion made, (As sottish as it was) in heavy Fetters laid. VIII Naked, 'tis true, they feign'd him; but just so, As we, who yet esteem our selves more Wise, In Oratories naked Angels show, Nor count it blame our selves thus to advise, How open all we do, or think to Heaven lies; That from it nought we can, or would conceal, That from us banisht is all Artifice; All which by 'his Nakedness Love does reveal, And, from his Step-dames Temples, to the Church appeal. IX But by his Fillet they such Lessons taught, As the Worlds present Learning far out-goes; Nor did the Master, who design'd the Draught, And for a Dia'dem put it on Loves brows, E're think it would his Sacred Head expose; Tho be 'it a Fillet, what can it intend? What teach, but that, which every Lover knows, Eve'ry true Lover, that to chuse a Friend, Barely by sight, 's beginning where scarce Fools would end. X His Eyes were therefore hid (if hid they were) From all commerce in Love to' exclude the Eyes; Which judging, as the Object does appear, Too oft impose, impos'd by Flatteries, False mirrors of an Heart, which deeper lies: The Heart, where Love that's true does first begin, By Reason guided, its own worth to 'apprize; Then by Discretion, seld in Lovers seen, Who still the more's the outward glare, see least within. XI Eyes Intellectual he' had, wherewith agree Those Wings, which they no less unto him gave; I'll Furniture for Love, if Blind he be, Who rather then would want a Guide to have, Himself from dangers unforeseen to save: But love himself alone was his own Guide, Nor needed any others Conduct crave, And with his Wings spread, and extended wide, A flight to Heav'n attempted, none durst dare beside. XII For why no Love it is, whose vile desires, Incline it downwards to the Miry Ground; This Earth of ours, which Sottices inspires, Preying on Carnage there, or made, or found, And with ignoble thoughts does most abound: But that's true Love, and does deserve the Name, Whose noble Acquists, nothing mean can bound; And mindful of the Region, whence it came, Thither aspiring terminates with Heav'n its Fame. XIII Like Wings, like Quiver: With bright Arrows fill'd, Of different sorts, but with like Mystery, As is well known to them, who 'in Love are skill'd, Well taught, what Motions in the Mind there be, And how both Love, and Hatred there agree; Hatred of all that bears the' impress of ill, With love of all that's good, in its degree; The Choques and just fixt byass of the Will, Which make up Love, and all its various parts fulfil. XIV The Golden pyl'd its Inclination prov'd, Leaden Aversion, ne're to be deny'd; Or if thereof there should be Question mov'd, The Torch Love bore, his other Arms beside, Too bright did shine the Mystic Truth to hide, That Soul of th' World, that all things keeps intire, In Life, and Motion, nobly Typifi'd; Noblest of Elements, but yet rais'd higher Than place'd at first, when made Loves noblest Symbol, Fire. XV Thus by the Ancients Love was first express'd, And, tho a Child, their God most ancient own'd; Older than Saturn, whom Jove dispossess'd Of Right usurpt, and in his stead was Crown'd: Son of Urania, (as in Books is found) Venus Urania, whom we Heaven call With them, who their Mythologie expound, Distinct from that Pandeme, who was Thrall To Vulgar Souls, and had from th' Earth Original. XVI Two unlike Mothers of two Sons unlike, Eros and Anteros, whose oppos'd Name, (Which different Sentiments in them did strike) From their own first great Opposition came, That from their Nature; and tho judg'd the same, In one, and t'other Sex, where they preside, The Male, and Female Hymeneal Flame, Are two so, that once kindled they divide, Just like those Fatal Brethrens, who Dead, each defi'd. XVII Eros was Elder, and the stronger too; Of Constitution likely to endure Eternal Ages, if the Spi'rit he drew, Were not empoyson'd by an Air impure; Of which consulting how to be secure, 'Twas plainly told him from th' Oraculous Throne, Than that of Themis far more Old, and sure, A Tripode, which ne're fail'd, When two are One, Then Love in danger is by Love to be undone. XVIII Of two made one, Love well enough conceiv'd, For that himself had seen, himself had done; But it by Love could hardly be believ'd, That he to' himself so contrary should run, As to provoke, what most he sought to shun: Against himself that he should so prevail, As thence in hazard be, to be undone; This ev'en to Love, obscur'd in Mortal Vail, Abstruse did seem, and by another sai'd might fail. XIX But Time, a little time the Mysterie clear'd, When by another Love, this Anteros, He was betray'd; who that which first appear'd, (And 't was the Sun) when from the Earth he rose, Ador'd as his chief God, with sacred Vows; And many Altars to it after made, By 'his Votaries, on whom he did impose The Task Idolatrous, and First-fruits pai'd, Himself the first Idolater, there prophanely laid. XX From Earth first rose this feign'd, and Idol Love, By DIS begot; tho not till after known Who was his Sire, or what himself would prove; Of a curst Father the as cursed Son, Born Arm'd for others Ruine, and his own; With all the Ensigns Love was wont to bear, By th' Heathen read, that if together shown, All but themselves to' impose on they'd go near, And here's the true Love one would say, &amp; one he's there. XXI Like Youth in both, like Face, and Looks were seen Like naked Limbs, with covered Impudence In this, but gesture tending to obscene, In a free gayety 'hid, to' elude the Sense; Like Chaplet, for their Brows, and Eyes defence; Like Wings, like Quiver hung their Backs adown; Like different Arrows to be drawn out thence; Like burning Torch, which Flames so like did crown, Either would seem the true, if single, and alone. XXII Ah! that they had like Grace those Arms to use! But this was loudly by the False decry'd, Who only took them, that he might abuse, The World, by whom he should be Deifi'd, And acts inglorious in that Visor hide: Never to use them was his full intent, Or if he did, not as before well try'd; But to a Love, and Learning different, Where Sense alone should be supreme in Government. XXIII Love saw all this (for what to Love is hid?) The true Love saw it, and withdrew in haste; No place was left him on the Earth to' abide, Wherefore he to the Empyrean past, And only Conscience his Vicegerent plac'd: With Promise yet, that if in time to come, Man wiser grew (the Counterfeit uncas'd) Himself his now left Charge would reassume, And once again to Man return, as his last Home. XXIV For Man, 'tis known, scarce the wild Phanto'sm saw, This Pageant Counterfeit of Love Divine, But his Allegeance back he straight did draw, And to the Enemies part from Love decline, By Sense led, which had quickly sunk a Mine, Reason, or to surprize, or to o'rethrow; And the vain Stratagem had drest so fine, With umbrage, that it Good, and Ill should know, The Fort surrendred was, scarce known for what, or how. XXV But up 'twas given, and therewith given was all, (For Nothing, or what's worse than nothing, lies) What ever Man his own, by right might call, Or by Commission, but sure ne're did prize Deserv'dly, since he' it could so soon despise; His Life, his Soul, what most was of behoof, To' a Being so dispos'd, and fram'd, as His; Of his Obedience the first easie proof, And what, as Heav'n it self was valuable, his Love. XXVI All were give'n up, and now adieu, blest Love! Adieu all Happiness, and Innocence! Honour, and Vertue, which the same Course move, And Mortals very rarely visit since! Adieu unto you all, for Love's gone hence, And only left your empty Names behind, Upon the Stage to please, or give offence, As variously Spectators are inclin'd, But wherewith most are pleas'd, as most 'gainst Love combind. XXVII Honour and Love adieu! And now my Song, Since thou hast trace'd them to their first aboad, Rest they a while; and tell, as does belong To the Mock-Love, the World's, and Peoples God! But make of every Rime an Iron Rod, Wherewith thou mayst the Profligate chastise! And tho thou goest a way, as yet untrod, Despair not but thy Work shall beauteous rise, And with the Sober find acceptance, and the Wise! XXVIII With these acceptance, but with others scorn, Who to this Anti-Love blind Vassals made, By our First-Fathers Act, have Fealty sworn To a fell Tyran, who must be obey'd, And will, nor in his furious heats gain-said: Unhappy Men, if their unhappiness They could but know, and how they are betray'd; Enough unhappy, would they but confess The little that they know, which words can scarce express! XXIX Slaves of Vile Passions, which drive furiously, And all that's Sacred, with high Hand bear down; Themselves, their Ancestors, the Deity, Reason, and Reasons Guide, Religion, The Worlds consent attested by their own; Till to the Winds, and Seas their Faith they gave, And sought, what else they could not flee, to drown In bottomless Abyss, nor Shipwrackt have The least security, they shall their Fraightage save. XXX And yet who more secure? But this their Love, Their New Love, in whose Service they 're retain'd, Gives as his own, and their most urging Proof, That they, true Conquerors, have the Victory gain'd, And broke those Iro'ns, wherewith all else are chain'd: Ill Education, brutal Thunders dread, A fear of what's above, to which they 'are train'd, And what's to come, dreams of the long since dead, That first made Gods, and what their Fears made, worshipped. XXXI Horrors th' Anti-diluvian World ne're knew, Or if it did, durst not bare-face'd profess; Tho from one Seed their Love, and Atheism grew, Both Ills, but which the greater, which the less, Is hard to say, almost as hard to ghess: For either both, in both was either had, In both, and either lost Man's Righteousness; I'th' cause, or in th' effect, both equal bad, And both, that sensually, and this prophanely mad. XXXII But for Prophaneness, Sense was th' Harbinger, And busily by Love prepar'd its way; (For so I'll call awhile the Worlds Troubler) Who all its Stages did before-hand lay, And longer here, and longer there would stay: Till having th' whole Earth compass'd, and laid waste, A Deluge came, and swept their Spoils away, The Spoilers 'scaping with the few, who past, By Ship to a new world, where Cham their Standard plac'd. XXXIII Cham pitcht it there; Curst Cham who for the shame Done to his Father, just Reproach did bear, In that Addition to his cursed Name, Servant of Servants, which his Race still wear: But never did he Slave so much appear, Of Slaves the verie'st Drudg, as when he Love Permitted uncontroll'd to domineer, And lustful War 'gainst Heav'n, and God to move, And all below seduce, and defy all above. XXXIV With him Love went (while yet the World was one, One People, and one Language) unperceiv'd; And so great Victories by his Conduct won, That He was openly at last receiv'd, The first, that no more Worlds there were, who griev'd: And yet more Worlds he for his Triumphs found, Or what's as good, new Coasts to be deceiv'd; When the divided Earth was Peopled round, With distinct Nations sown, which stockt the new-broke Ground. XXXV Each Nation was a several World, or as A World distinct; the Islands most of all, Which, late discover'd, for new Worlds did pass With those, who by that Name did Countries call, Surrounded by the wide Seas rolling Wall: And Love in every Land, and every Isle, Did reign with Majesty Imperial, And sway unbounded by the farthest Thyle, Tho that, as the World's farthest bound, did stand erewhile. XXXVI A mighty Prince, and curious Traveller, Of sense most exquisite, from each to take, Each Country, lay it farther off, or near, What for the gust of Loving most could make, And the o're-labour'd Appetite awake, Satiate with loose disport, and rockt asleep, Of not yet tasted Pleasures to partake; Which in his dark Serraig'ls he close did keep, And laid, till time should serve, as the Earths Center deep. XXXVII At length it serv'd; Ah! that it serv'd not now! And Love by 'his Conquests had such Subjects gain'd, (For to his Yoak the Universe did bow, And Arts, and Arms were to the Service train'd) That out of fear to lose what he' had obtain'd, He only Trophies gave himself to rear, And the Disguise put off he had sustain'd; As the Supreme God would Himself appear, And above all, that's else call'd God, his Head did bear. XXXVIII Above the Sun, whom Himself worshipped, But whom disgraded he to th' Persian sent, Next to himself to be propitiated, In their Horn'd Mithra, which to Idols bent, With thousand others, of obscure descent, By this time Gentilism Gods had made, New Deities industr'ious to invent; Whom or in Hills, or thick Groves hallow'd shade, With Beasts, or Humane Blood they aton'd, and to them pray'd. XXXIX Their Sons, or Daughters Blood for these suffic'd, But what to him they offer'd was their own; Freedom, above their Life, to be appriz'd, Which how they could disvalue well was shown By this, if only this had been alone, That when th' Usurper did their Homage claim, And in 'his true Colours made himself be known, In throngs they to his Feet, and Altars came, And kept, with Fires from their own Brests, perpetual Flame. XL Fires, which consum'd, e're felt, the noblest Part, And all that's good in Man, or great, laid waste, By th' Eyes convey'd most treacherously to th' Heart, Whence to the Liver soon the Burning past, And Vertues Images in both defac'd; Thence to the Bones, nor did the Flesh 'scape long; Till Soul and Body in a Flame at last, The present God, to be deny'd too strong, Plung'd all into a Sea of Sulphur'ous Flame headlong. XLI Like God, like Victim; To a God unclean, Of Beasts th' Uncleanest offer'd, Man turn'd Beast; Himself the Sacrifice, and Priest obscene, In which to minister he did divest, All that above the Brute he once possest, And lower than the Brute unforce'd sank down; With such Unmanly' Indignities opprest, He' had scorn'd them, as he might, by 'another done, Her rude disgusts, whom he solicited, and his own. XLII For why a SHE's the Quarry, and the Game, At which this Mock-Love, and his Haggards flie; The Sex in either Sex, both worthy blame, And tho distinguisht first for ends more high, Both equally debaucht by 'his Effrontry, And acts so mad, and foolish (yet call'd Love, Thereby engrossing the' whole Monopoly) That one would think't should Indignation move, Such Follies to commit, such Madness to reprove. XLIII A Medly, with part Folly, Madness part, And is the All of Love, Person, or Thing, Or Act, or Powe'r, or by the Poets Art However call'd, as he can Matter bring, Of Love in Numbers and in Verse to sing; And tending all, as Love's in all the same, By Images of divers fashioning, (If all are yet enough to' expose the shame) One Spoiler to denote, and LEGION is his Name. XLIV The hardest Devil to be dispossest; For e're he came the empty Rooms were swept, By Idleness the' Housekeeper, and new drest; Idleness, only for that service kept, And who, or so employ'd, or ever slept: A brawny Carle, that ne're did work beside, But here commanded forward briskly stept; And rather than be found unoccupi'd, The Windows stopt, and all the several Lights did hide. XLV But Fancy well enough did that supply, Or little mist, Loves next fore-runner light; Who having once uprear'd his tender Eye, And of the Object ta'ne the distant height, Made up the view all by Internal Sight: And with new Beauties unperceiv'd before, But there display'd, himself did first delight; Then open'd, which he'had to him shut, the Door, To let in loose Desire, and again tell them o're. XLVI So in Desire came, vainest of the Three, And after him in Triumph rode the Fiend; Whom seven Spirits, full as bad as he, Did close behind in Mascarade attend, And Iö sang to Love, that Heav'n did rend: So sang they all, but with unequal grace, As were their looks; for some their Brows did bend, And grin'd most horrid, with distorted Face; Others were blith, and smil'd as they along did pass. XLVII These Folly were, and Mirth, and Dalliance, Who hardly could their Way for laughing hold, By Genius clos'd; the Three, who lookt askaunce, And midst their shouts could hardly cease to scold, Were Lust, that scorn'd by th' best to be controll'd; And Proteus Sin, who diverse Shapes put on, As diverse kind, and Names he' had manifold; And Death, the seventh from Love, mere Skeleton One half, t'other Fantastick clad as shall be shown. XLVIII Folly the First, by' her Habit seem'd a Maid, And by her Face, which was excelling fair; Tho whether such, was difficult to be said, Nor safe it may be, since few Men there were, But in her claim'd with Women equal share, And ill had took't, had she pure Woman been: A pretty thing to gaze on, but whose Air, And Gate, and Gesture, made it quickly seen, She none of th' Wisest was, and somewhat lackt within. XLIX Light Gesture, Gate ungraceful, compos'd Air, Save when she spake, or laught; but then betray'd A thousand Follies, with prodigious glare; For by a Glass she with a Shadow plaid, (Her self, to whom she frequent Honours made) And every glance, which she design'd to cast, And every look, by that in order laid; And to such troublesome Impertinence past, That every little Word she thereby form'd at last. L Mirth was a Youth of beautiful regard, With chearful Eyes, plump downy Cheeks, and Chin; And nothing in his looks, or strange, or hard, That, if one by the Face could ought divine, All Beauties there amass't did seem to shine: All that can Man become, or Love excite In Loves great Criticks, the Sex Feminine; All but i'th' Timorous, whom his Whip did fright, And more deterr, than all his other Charms invite. LI For in his Hand a Bloody Discipline, With many a'pointed Rowel stuck, he bore; And wherewith, when unmark't, he saw his time, Backward reflecting, he his Shoulders tore, And the smooth Channel fill'd with purple gore: But when or Folly call'd, or Dalliance, The fretting exercise he soon gave o're, And, as recovered from a sullen Trance, Met with quick Eyes, and amorous Look each smiling Glance. LII Him Dalliance followed next, a Damsel gay, Of light behaviour, as she well could feign; And wantonly her Brest did open lay, The Lover who came next, to entertain; Tho who the He were of her mighty Train, She was not much solicitous to know, Nor much to fancy him her self did pain; For she like Favours did on all bestow, And bonnour was to all, how high so e're or low. LIII A Night-Gown was the Habit which she wore, Loosely clapt round her, but so airy thin, That through its light disguise appear'd the more, What she ne're strove to hide, her beauteous Skin, And just proportion of each curious Limb: With Impudence too luscious to be told, And speech Lascivious, when she did begin, Which none, but like her self, unchast, and bold, Or unreprov'd could hear, or unasham'd behold. LIV Next after her in order Genius came, Of Body somewhat gross, but Humour free; Whom part call'd Comus, as by his Sirname, Tho both, or either with him well agree, Without whom Love, nor merry Life can be: A right good Fellow, as his Belly show'd, Which in a Swath reacht almost to his Knee, And made him passage through th' admiring Crowd, Which shouting to him louted, as to them he bow'd. LV No wrinkle in his Counte'nance did appear, Nor careful thought seem'd to come near his Mind, Of what should be; but things, which present were, Variously turn'd him, as did sit the Wind, And this way now, now that way he inclin'd: Tho if 'twere still, (and sometime still it lay) Diversions to himself he'd make, or find; And sometimes only muse a live-long Day, Tho askt on what, he or nought knew, or nought could say. LVI These were the fairest Shews Loves entrance had, And of the Pomp the sightliest Officers, Who therefore next the Carr Triumphal staid, But Spirits Incarnate were, and all as fierce, Provoke'd once, as those Fatal Ministers Of his, and more than his, of th' Wrath Divine, Which follow'd next, with look, and meen perverse; A Grisly, Horrid, and Prodigious Trine, Which hardly into shape, Love could by 'his Art refine. LVII Lust was the First, but whether Man, or Beast, Or He, or She, one could by no means know, For it both Sexes had, and did invest Mankind above, and Beast mishape'd below, And slote divided did for ostent show: With shaggy Hair the' whole Body cover'd o're, And poysonous stench, which he around did throw, Undampt by th' Perfumes, which the Satyre bore, (For so they call'd him) and about him ever wore. LVIII A very Satyr, whom he nearest came, In Face, and Guise, but in Deformity Excell'd, the first of the' Family, and Name; And shameless was his Look, and lew'd his Eye, But sharp withal, Beauties which cloyster'd lie, First to discover, then to circumvent, By Clamour, wherein low'd he was and high, Nor could forbear, as he in Triumph went; Prime Visier of the Port, and Loves chief Confident. LIX Sin follow'd him, who was his Eldest Son, And only Child, with place and dignity, His Parents Titles suiting, and his own; But on his own he mostly did relie, And all, but what his own was, did decry; Would, and did loudly against Lust declame, As Impotent, couragious to defie, But who to Handy-blows, or never came, Or not with such effect, as he, to get a Name. LX For tho but one, a thousand Heads he had, And twice a thousand Hands boldly to fight; An Army of himself, and which he made Greater, or less, as the Cause did invite; (Love, and Loves Good Old Cause was his delight) Rebellion, whose design to carry on, Himself he variously, as 'it hapt, would dight, A Beasts, or Man's form take now, and anon Angels, or Fiends, a multitude, one be, or none. LXI But Death the third, the same shape alway kept, If Shape it might be call'd, that shape had none, Except in that half of him, which foremost stept And to the view expos'd a side of Bone, That seem'd with Skin to have been cloath'd upon, And Musculage, not many Days before; For scarcely cleansed was the Skeleton, And here and there appear'd fresh stains of Gore, And gobbets of green flesh, which from the joynts he tore. LXII To'ther half was the Universe, and all, And every thing, that in the World is found, Which hastens, or is ready at Death's call, And are th' Ingredients, which he does compound, Or single, or in Mass to give the Wound: A dreadful Mixture, and of which to tell, Almost to think, would th' greatest Wit confound; For since the time that Man from Happi'ness fell, They were collecting, and had at the bottom Hell. LXIII Where e're he came, these were Loves Company, With Train and Baggage, which did far extend; And Meny suiting so great Prince as He, For Prince and God they call'd him, tho Pure Fiend: Unquiet Care, which all his time did spend Himself to' undo, backt by Suspicion, Then Impudence, which did to Lechery lend His unchast Ear, and Fury bad come on, By Riotice drawn up, and Irreligion. LXIV Without door Danger, and Distrust did wait, And Fear, that never was himself at rest, Or others would permit their Watch to 'abate; And Jealousie, which tho he were possest Of what he lov'd, for rage tore his own Breast; And Lust unnatural, and Villany, And Revellings, in thousand Anticks drest; And Poverty, in Rags clad piteously, Calling aloud for Death, which did th' unhappy fly. LXV It fled him, as one, who from Love was fled, Under the Disc'ipline, if he had the skill To use it right, of Sorrow, seeming dead, But which for a blest Life prepares Our will, By that Repentance, which Shame does instil; Repentance the first step to Innocence, Whose various parts it makes, or does fulfil: But whereof Lustful Minds have little sense, Till Shame sum up the Total of the vast expence. LXVI Death such a Bankrupt therefore flies, Hasting to those, who call'd, or call'd him not, By Loves own Hands crown'd for the Sacrifice, And or pursue'd, or i'th' pursuit were hot, E're well aware to th' end of all things got, By Death inglorious, and with Infamy; (Of most Luxurious Livers the hard lot) Yet which Love colour'd with such Maistery, That the most follow'd, what the most did seem to flie. LXVII For Love had thousand Deaths at his command, And every Lover, might his own Fate make, Which some did, but by'a way so under-hand, That from the praise of Love it much did take, And many 'a Lover lost he for their sake; Tho such he pleaded were by him giv'n o're, (If all might be believ'd, which then Love spake) Nor could to his account be reckoned more, Than if thus, or a Natural Death they dy'd before. LXVIII Be the Point therefore, as it will for me, Who list not further of it here to tell; Enough are Lovers Deaths we daily see, (And so 'twas then) a Songs scant bounds to swell, Nor yet for Love, or them contriv'd so well, But that one midst the Pomp might easily find The Mighty, by whose cruel Hands they fell; And Verdict give the Murther was design'd, By th' Pains they felt before, Reproach they left behind. LXIX Pains more than can of Mortal Tongue be told, And sharper than e're Tyran did invent; Which the whole Man did in strait Fetters hold, Till tortur'd Nature, quite worn out, was spent, Of Love the Guerdon and the Punishment: Yet Tyrans Racks found out, the Pale, and Wheel, And Fire, and all that can by Fire torment, Or be prepar'd, th' Ax, and derr-doing Steel, But make no wounds all, set with those which Lovers feel. LXX Thrice, and than thrice more wretched state of Love, When Innocence and Truth to Heav'n were gone! But seve'n times wretcheder it yet did prove, When this Mock-love wholly usurpt the Throne, (As he 'after did) and single reign'd alone, With Name and Pow'r alike usurpt, yet was, Ah! What not was he?—But 'tis time to' have done With him, who can to Verse give little grace, And in another Canto to the True Love pass. CANTO III. I Tire'd with the Way I have already gone Longer by many a Stage, than setting out I thought it would have prov'd, and where there's none To guide me, in the search I am about, How well I shall succeed is my great doubt, Who almost of the Enterprize repent, Wishing I better of it first had thought; At least before me some Espials sent, Who might have told the hazard of the bold Attempt. II But to repent (alas!) 'tis now too late, And in the last Act fail, a wrong to Love, Which in another I should surely hate, And cannot in my self unblam'd approve, What Arguments so e're Distrust may move; Which many, cogent seem, and weighty all, But all which by this single'One I reprove, That well if well, if ill succeed I shall, 'Tis not inglorious from the noblest heights to fall. III But help me Love, and I'll not yet despair! For other Muse I dare not invocate; None but thy Self, with whom the Treasures are Of bright Idæas, tho discover'd late To me, who half my time in Darkness sat, Ylamped only by a Foolish Fire, Whose wandring guidance I now deprecate, Led by it often, and my vain desire, To whence I could not till Thy Day brake out, retire. IV At length it brake out, and I came to know How wofully I had mistook my Way; Shine forth again with double Glory now, And in my Verse Thy fairest Beams display, That others with me in it triumph may: And having their Night Sullys thence refin'd, Carol with sacred Hymn's to th' Beauteous Day; Carol to Thee, by Heav'n, and God design'd, The Counterfeit to' uncase, and Eyes restore the Blind. V LONG had the Mock-love, by his false disguise, Upon the Credulous World impos'd, but more Upon himself, if he had been so wise To think how much 'twould cost him to restore, And, what by tort he' had snatcht, a new pay o're; But this (alas!) came seldom in his thought, Rather perverse still, as he was before, The World, which he had into Bondage brought, Eternally to' enthral, was th' only Prize he sought. VI This was his aim, nor to rebate it found, Save Prophecies of a Supplanters race; Which well he knew not, and could worse expound, Wherein the happy Country was the place, Whence was foretold should come his great disgrace; But when, or how, tho himself Oracles gave, Too hard to be resolv'd was the dark case; Nor could he any certain knowledg have, Who should the Mighty Conqueror be, his Thralls to' unslave. VII The happy Country well enough he knew, Part of his Syria to be 'hight Palestine; Wherefore he thither his Chief Forces drew, And seiz'd it first by 'a more than double Trine Of cursed Nations, from the Great Chams Line; Cham, who first gave him credit by his Arms, And then his Empire to him did resign; Cham, whom he thus rewarded for the harms He had sustain'd, to be Camp-Master of his Charms. VIII Seven cursed Nations, of his cursed Seed, To be its constant Guard Love thither sent; Who fill'd the Land so with their cursed Breed, That scarce was left him room for his own Tent, Less for new Col'onies, if such thither went: A stupid, bestial, and unmanly Rout, That all their Age in Lusts unnatural spent; Till the time came their Land should spue them out, Too long opprest, and bring the dread Foresight about. IX Love saw it coming, and began to fear, When Jacob's numerous Host, from Bondage led, Unto the Cananitish bounds drew near, Seising the Nations with unusual Dread, While Seas to make them way rose up and fled; But never did he more confounded stand, Than when he Jordan saw recoil to 'his Head, And to new Armies shar'd by Lot his Land, Supplanted e're he did th' Supplanters understand. X Before he doubted those would prove the Men, And therefore when they were upon the Way, From Madian drest a Female Stratagem, By which above two Myriads slaughter'd lay, Tho Madian for it after dear did pay, And he who gave the Counsel with them fell. Balam their Priest and his the Sword did slay, To expiate for th' Whoredoms he did sell, And more advise, than by Prophetic rage foretel: XI But then he knew it, and in every Age, As Israel did in wealth and power encrease, New Wars would with the Holy People wage, Wars Amorous, the sad result of Peace; Nor his Assaults defeated oft surcease; Till David was exalted to the Throne, With Testimony that he God did please, As Enoch had, and then Love gave for gone All he before had gain'd, and by his Conquests won. XII Ah! that it had been gone! and that his sway Had here expir'd! But Jesses Son soon fell, A victim at his Altars, and a Prey; Wherewith, and with his Pride he so did swell, That tho he after had not much to tell, Nor much to boast more, during his whole Reign, Eluded was he judg'd the Oracle, Nor could there for him ought behind remain, But what He thus had got, as happ'ly to maintain. XIII This Salomons youth did easily perswade, (David's next Successor) who tho most wise, (Love of the Wisest ne're was yet afraid) Had other Grandures, which might chance to rise Higher in Loves account, well plac'd, than his: Infinite Riches, Peaceful Government, The Necks, and Pleasures of his Enemies; And, what then these was more, a mind intent, Of Folly, and of Love to make th' Experiment. XIV He made it, and in making it was caught, To his Lands baleful Ruine, and his own; And both, by him that, he by Love ill taught, As from a Precipice together thrown, Ne're stopt till come to th' bottom Head-long down: Unhappy Prince, who could not single fall! Whose smiles appear'd more fatal than his frown; The Kingdoms Laws this, for the Criminal, But bad example those, which further reacht to all! XV And now, if ever, Love to the' top was got Of his unmeasurable Soveraigntie; So far above his Hope and deepest Plot, That scarce could he believe what he did see, And almost trembled in those heights to be, Compar'd with which the Honours he had gain'd, In the World Heathen, were a low degree; For there he o're the brutish only reign'd, The Noblest, and the Wisest here to 'his Lore were train'd. XVI Ev'n God himself most High to serve was made; And his first Institution, Marriage, Cement of holy Love, so base allay'd, That it degen'rated to Bestial rage, And more divided, than it did engage To mutual Amours and joyn'd Hearts consent: Madness before begun, but which this Age, With ancient Rites, indulg'd long, not content, Perfected by a new, and wild Establishment, XVII Of sharers infinite in the Marriage Bed, By this false Loves prime Ministers brought in; With Artifice, at first, close palliated, The New-made World, which was but peopled thin, To stock amain and plausibly begin: Hence Bigamy, and then Polygamy, Causless Divorce next, to them near of kin, On every small dislike, did multiply, And Children reck'ned were of Loves huge Family. XVIII And so it stood, even in the Holy Race, (From the Beginning tho it were not so) For many Ages of permissive Grace, But more of Hardness that ith' Heart did grow. Of those, who no delight in One would know, And whom Variety would only please: Yet God at first but One design'd, to show His, and the pow'r of Love, and if Disease Abus'd 't should after be, its Remedy and Ease. XIX (For more, if more are sought the drought to allay, But like strange waters to th' Hydropic prove, And frequent draughts, which in the Bowels stay, And nor the Thirst, nor the Disease remove; And such is Change to him, who Change does love, (The more, the worse) He drinks, and thirsts again, And still the more he drinks, does more improve His Thirst, the very remedy is pain, Yet neither can shake off, of neither but complain.) XX And that Disease 'twould prove, in his Foresight, Abus'd once, the Almighty knew, and thence To 'a single Circle bound the subtile Sp'rit, Who, one transgrest, was Proof against all fence, And easi'ly could with Just and Fit dispense; One Partner in Chast Nuptials, as enough Their Ornament to be, and their Defence, By Sin prevented, all that was above, Or two, or more, or many, came from this False Love. XXI From him they came All, but successively, And even the Many yet were but a Few, Compar'd with that excess, which grown most high, In Salomon's Reign, no limits had, or knew, And into th' Band, not One, but Hundreds drew: Seven hundred Wives, Three hundred Concubins, Whom the Uxorious King did close pursue, A Female Army, under Love's Ensigns, With Treasure infi'nit drein'd, and with exausted Loins. XXII Prodigious Astoreth, be 'it an He, or She, Or both, or neither, an opprobrious Stock; For Sex in Idols is a Nicetie Unknown to th' Makers, whom it ne're did choque To stile as they should please the sensless Block: Tho if they call'd it by a Female Name, More Folly, and less Power, they yfere did yoke; And, if need serv'd, a Male the God became, Their own to 'attemper, and expose the Votaries shame. XXIII Be it prodigious therefore, and a She! And a She this Mock-Love, if so it please! Prodigious Astoreth! and prodigious He, Who was her Slave, and Slave to 'a thousand Shees, On the Rack put by 'his Lusts, or Marriages! And if 'tis true, that each a Body makes, (And true it is) how monstrous with all these, Must his appear, who has so different stakes, Where each with only 'him, he with each, and all partakes? XXIV With all partook he, and made up with all One monstrous Body, which did all contain; All Lands, and Languages, from the huge Wall Of Babylon, to where Nile bedds the Main, Lusty in Egypts Spoils, with Pompous Train: No Country was there, but sent in some Love, No Love, but did its Countries Gods retain, All which he serv'd, if he were Service-proof, Enough to satiate, not to satisfy enough. XXV Marriage perverted thus from its design, Love to enhance, and raise an Holy Seed, To hinder Whoredoms, and the Rage confine Of an unruly Passion, which did need More Reins than Spurs, and of Hells fiercest breed; But above all, nobly to typify The Mystic Union, which shall intercede 'Twixt Christ &amp; holy Church, Man &amp; th' Most High, All Mischiefs thence brake in, and all Idolatry. XXVI Thence Whoredoms, Fornications thence brake in, And, which the Holy People did or'eflow, Rapes, Incests, and than Incest worse, the Sin Confusion call'd, foul Sod'omy, and a row Of bestial Vices, which 'twere guilt to know, But more to tell; The 'unwary Course some take Lust to perstringe by action, or by show, But teaching more, what does no teaching lack, And those whose Ign'orance, their whole Innocence does make. XXVII Yet Israel acted all, and did out-do, Well thew'd in Villanies, their Teachers skill; And Men with Men, with Women Women too All Shame put off, and did both parts fulfil, With Sexes counterfeited, (every Hill, And Grove with Humane Beasts, and mingled Blood Promiscuous cast, replenisht thick) the while Brutes themselves, as less salvage, wondring stood, Man o're them made to reign, should with them change Manhood. XXVIII No wonder thus debas'd, new Gods they chose, Gods like themselves, and they new Gods did chuse, Prodigious as their Lusts, on whom they'impose Horrors the Beast would, if it could, refuse, Design'd for Service and a nobler use: Baalim and Astaroth, or what-ever name Those Generals include, bleeding Thamuze, Dagon, and Moloch, Kemos, Moabs shame, And thousand others, which into the Bead-roll came: XXIX All which they worship'd, and did lowly bow Before their Altars; lowest bow'd their King, Who Temples made them, and did first allow Their Rites absurd, (by his strange Wives brought in, Authentick made, when their establishing Own'd him as Founder) and some think that Verse Then lustful Orgias first began to sing, And prostituted Mysteries rehearse, Which Fabulous Greece did after through the World disperse. XXX Verse it is sure, did early suffer wrong; And Tyran Love debaucht it, as he' had done God's noblest Creature, for the chains are strong, With which he holds it yet, as if his own It purely were, and were enough alone All that he else has lost back to regain, And whence he had been tumbled, to the Throne Once more advance him, in his Hands the Rein Of all things, midst an holier People, put again. XXXI It serv'd a little then, its service now Is wondrously encreast, since Sloth, and Age Have heightned Vice, and made Verse to it bow; To th' Gods before it was in Vassalage, And only knew the Pythonesses rage, Or Priests inspir'd, to all beside most chast, To Vertue did, and to true Worth engage; And if the Object had been rightly plac'd, Might for a real Vertue, and true Grace have past. XXXII But now, (what quickly after it begun) Retaining nothing but the Ill 'it has gain'd, By Lux, and Travel, it does counter-run To all that's Good, or Honest, or maintain'd I'th' Civil Worlds esteem, with Atheism stain'd, (As the next step to many Gods is none) And all Impiety, has place obtain'd With the worst Men, and is so furious grown, That in its fits it God and King defies alone. XXXIII These it defies, and dare unmask'd profess, (Where'it may be free, and to its full pitch flown) What e'ven to think abash'd mere Heathenness; Nay when reserv'd most, and most modest grown, 'Twill others Follies sing, and make its own, And than the Wise much rather please the Vain: But since its present State too well is known To be conceal'd, my self I shall not pain To tell it here, or further, tho provok'd complain. XXXIV Ah! that it would it self, or could complain! And of the Lusts, to which it did submit Unwillingly at first, nor without pain, But willingly when Custom humbled it, Betray'd by 'its false and treacherous Mi'gnon Wit: Her Mistress Verse the treacherous Maid beguil'd, The false Love her; and up they both did set One shameless Brothel, wanton that, this wild, Till both of Honour, Vertue, and true Love were spoil'd. XXXV Despoil'd they were, despoil'd, what they did serve, Honour, and Vertue, and the Love Divine, And Wedlock, which did covertly preserve Some Traces of a Vigor Masculine, Which Lust could never to its Beck incline So perfectly, but it resistance made, Weak as it was, and sprung a Counter-mine: But now aside all Enmities were laid, And all with one consent did plot Heav'n to invade. XXXVI Which as th' Almighty saw into his Mind, That Mind of his it came, which ever love To 'his Works did bear, to Man was ever kind, The madness of such Faytours to reprove, And what none else could do, the Cause remove; The cause was this Mock-Love, whom to debase, Into his Mind it came, by him, who strove So high to raise him, and who what he was, Of all Men best did know, did all in Loves surpass. XXXVII Wise Salomon, who when he long had try'd The vain Experiment, at length grew Wise; Nor longer with him would the secret hide, Than till th' Almighty open'd had his Eyes, And to him clear'd the blest Discoveries: Till his Repentance had his Loves effac'd, And Credence gain'd us, that, immerst to rise Tho hard it be, the Doom may not be past, If what's too long one Day deferr'd, yet come at last. XXXVIII Him his great Prophet God most high did raise, Turning the Tenor of his inspir'd String, Of Ancient Honour, and of Future Praise, But most of Love, the Cause, and end to sing, And hidden Mysteries to the Light to bring; The mighty Works th' Almighty's Self would do, For Loves, and his BELOVEDS ransoming: All which he did to th' Royal Prophet show, And all which, by him taught, his Israel came to know. XXXIX Not as those Works, when finisht perfectly Should be display'd, but as became their state, And Him, who was, restor'd, the Type to be Of all the Glories, which he should relate; By Figures, and by Shadows adæquate To Humane Reasonings, and Discourse finite; By his chang'd Loves a Love to adumbrate, Which cannot else be seen by Mortal Light, God's Love to man, which different Natures should unite. XL That Love, which God in time from Heav'n should bring, With Man to dwell, and as true Man appear; Which Man no less, of all his Works the King, To Heav'n, excluded thence by' his Fall, should bear, And on his Wings triumphantly up-rear: And all the way, as he does thither rise, With Idees fill him of the Beauties there; That Love, in fine, which does all Loves comprize, Whence Man to'his Maker lives, his Maker for him dies. XLI Of all which Marriage is the Sacrament; (Or Symbol call it, if the Name displease) The closest Union to represent, 'Twixt God and Man, 'twixt Man and Happiness; And if there closer Union be than these, Or more (and whether more be meant who knows? Tho closer none) in one Term all to' express; Marriage, which once confirm'd by holy Vows, Is Loves Reprizal, and in one all Unions shows. XLII So God most High resolv'd, so Salomon, By him inspir'd did carnal Love impeach Of highest Treason, and Rebellion; The first, who plainly did the Mystery preach, And what himself, but late learnt, others teach: That Love alone, whose long and outstretcht Line, Through Natures Works, to Natures end does reach, Their Love, whom God, not Lust or Interest joyn, Unequal tho it be, comes nearest the Divine. XLIII As near as was, or fit for us to know, Or possible, in Mortal Flesh immur'd; (Tho God himself the Form would take below) When brighter Vision could not be endur'd, Nor Loves invisible taught else, or secur'd; For such is Man, tho of God's Works the chief, Of things Invisible to be assur'd, That from things Visible he must receive Th' imperfect Image, and of God by' himself conceive. XLIV His Bodies structure, and his Souls great Powers, Both which as having God himself propounds; Tho Acts Organical are purely Ours, And he the Deity by the shift confounds, Who makes it what the Parable expounds, With Senses, and with Parts corporeal, Loving like us, and with a Lovers Wounds, Which from the Deity are excluded all, And only us'd, that under Sense those Acts may fall. XLV Yet so God loves, so would be known to Love, As Love ith' Marriage Bed, kept undefil'd, Might figure best, if one the Vail remove, Our Nature, which of Innocence dispoyl'd, Till rais'd, whence sunk, beguiles and is beguil'd; But once restor'd, is worthy Him, and Us, Him still to love, with Love us to be fill'd, (Of Grace not Debt) become both Amorous, The Churches Husband He, the Church his Bride and Spouse. XLVI Thus loving, and belov'd thus shame on those, Whose either Atheism, or Impiety, Dare the Tremendous Figure, or expose, Or subject make it of foul Raillery, And to vile Lust embase the Mystery! That of their Happ'ness have so little sense, Their God, their Souls, and their Civility, That they with things most sacred can dispense, And rather than not give it, take from Heav'n offence! XLVII From Thee, most sacred and inspired Song, The humblest Condescention of Heav'ns King, From which my roving Verse has stray'd too long, Led by the Mock-love, and now late does sing; Next that the humblest, which with Saffron Wing, Gabriel, the True-loves mighty Harbinger, Foretold to the' EVER-VIRGIN, e're the thing Was full accomplisht, and thereof did bear, When done first News, and what the signs to know him were. XLVIII Signs too unlikely, till by Angels told, Whereby the Maker of all things to find; For who would think a simple Cratch should hold Eternal Majesty, mean Swathings bind Th' Incomprehensible, and Unconfin'd; And that an Ox, and Ass were company, (To Scorn enur'd, and labour by their kind) In an Inns-Stable fit for God Most High, And that a Babe should be that God, and expos'd lie? XLIX Yet signs they were with Heav'n which suited best, And best with God, when God should Flesh appear; And so was Wedlock, thence to be exprest, E're that time came, the Image he should bear, Or rather what our selves, allyed to' him near, (Nearer by Purchase, than Creation) Should thence become; like Glories with him wear, And since to us it could not else be known, Till Man to Heav'n should rise, high Heav'n to Man bring down. L By Love to bring it: And by Love HE brought it, Who all the Mysteries of Love did know; Second alone to Loves dear self, who taught it, As or above it was, or as below, And in thee, Song, its Mystic Power did show: Not as thy Words to'us sound, but as thy Sense, To th' Church apply'd, by holy Churches Vow, Must be expounded, with this Difference, Of God 'tis Figure All, of Man all Innocence, LI Of Soul and Body, but of Soul the most, Whose Acts and Motions Thou dost most intend, By views Material, to our Light dispos'd, But where the Matter does all Act suspend, And shadows what it cannot comprehend; Is nothing, or as nothing, how e're laid, Compar'd with what comparison does transcend; Nor meant at all, tho by it all is said, That's said of Love, which through its broken Pipe's convey'd. LII So wouldst Thou, Song, so must Thou be understood; And short of this, who e're Thy Flight would bound, To th' Deity sacrifices Human Blood, And fixes on th' Impassible that Wound, Which the Mock-love to offer had astound. For He soon as he heard the words Divine, His Sentence in them, and his Doom he found; At which affrighted, back he did resign All he before usurpt, nor ought had to rejoyn. LIII Happy he so could scape, tho e're away, Cast, and condemn'd, he into Exile went, The True Love, who long waited for that Day, Hymen his great Embassadour down sent, To beg some Exemplary Punishment, And Caution, that he would return no more: But all the Caution, which to give he meant, Was but his Word, nor longer that than Power Should fail him to attempt, what he had done before. LIV For Punishment, 'twas yet too early Day, To move, or hope; Himself enough had done, By those Spoyls, which unforce'd he down did lay, The Jurisdiction of Heav'ns Court to own, Whom that acknowledgment must serve or none: And out he went, with stern, and bloody Eyes, And bitter Railings on blest Hymen thrown; Who all his Railings did no less despise, Content (since he no more could get) with the bare Prize, LV Marriage restor'd to' its Just and Ancient Right, And all th' Intents, to which it was design'd; Marriage, which once secur'd, does Souls unite, And made in Heav'n, to Heav'n so near is joyn'd, That only there we purer Love can find: Marriage of th' Fallen World the best Estate, Marriage most Honourable with Mankind, Which to abuse, a Man his Flesh must hate, Marriage God's Blessing, when He gave o're to create. To the Muse, ODE PINDARIC. I. STROPHE. But whither bear'st Thou me, O Love, Sovereign Disposer of all things, Beyond the flight of Verses Wings, Which after Thee a Course unequal move? So swift Thy passage is, and wondrous light, Scarce can I of Thee get the sight; And all so here, and there, So unconfin'd, and every where, Appear Thou dost, and disappear, A Phantosm Thou would'st reckned be, But that whole Nature lives alone by Thee. I. ANTISTROPHE. From Heav'n to Earth, from Earth again To Heav'n, who has Loves Journy trace't? Hail ye bright Stars, which saw him last, And greater Lustre by his grant obtain! You last of all his parting Charge receiv'd, And still to keep it are believ'd, In times, and seasons thence, Which you to all his Works dispense, With kind and wholesome Influence; And at his Thrones dread Footstool wait, Illustrious Guards and Messengers of Fate. I. EPODOS. “Happy the Man, whose noble Soul “Hath rais'd him to a pitch so high, “That he the Heav'ns, as they about him roll, “Undazled can behold with curious Eye; “And every Mystic note, “That's in their Mighty Volume wrote, “As clearly understand, “As if acquainted with no other hand: “Yet happier He by far, “Who like the Kings, first guided by a Star, “Obtains like Royal Grace, “Into the Sacred Presence, usher'd thus, to pass! II. STROPHE. An Honour done but to a few, As few there be, who care to joyn Their quest to th' search of Love Divine, Thither applying, what from thence they drew; Heav'ns Priests, and Loves, who have the lucky skill, Both Services at once to fill; Nor like the most all day, Or Idle stand, or play, And gaze tho' on Heaven their Age away: Of Love, who largely boast the Name, But never saw his Light, or felt his Flame. II. ANTISTROPHE. At once both Services he fill'd, Whom the Muse sings, both knows the best Of any, who e're those Gifts possest, In Books so different so divinely skill'd; Natures and God's, the Gloss that, this the Text, And read together unperplext: While that, by' it self alone. Read, as too oft is done, But Altars rears to' a God unknown; To th' True this does a way provide, But difficult to walk without a Guide. II. EPODOS. Not SETH, whose Pillars Fabulous Surviv'd the all-devouring Flood, Taught the New World the Half he teaches us, Were all he taught as well but understood: Tho when of Love He treats, And His high Mysteries repeats, All hear, and what is heard By all for certain Truth is so rever'd, The ravisht Soul resents Its teadious stay, and future joys prevents; Rapt in Ecstatic Fires To the Divine Aboads, almost ith' Flame expires. III. STROPHE. Witness Thou Sarums sacred Pile, Which from the day Thou first cam'st down From the parcht neighbouring Hill, the Town Attending Thee, and shouting all the while, None happier saw'st than that which made Thee His, And Him Thine with united bliss. Thy Streams, Thy Fields, Thy Towers, By the' Graces led, and Hours, Daunc'd to their Genius Crown'd with Flowers: Thy very Children bless that time And their new Aera from its date sublime. III. ANTISTROPHE. Not but that worthy Thee, and Verse, There have been Prælats heretofore, (Tho none so Worthy) had like store Of sacred Poets been, as now rehearse. But all (alas!) are in Oblivion drown'd, Unsung laid underground, Because the Muses ayd, To all th' Acquists they made, Or lacking was, or else unpray'd: And their fond hopes of Future glory, Or to dumb Walls confin'd, or doubtful story. III. EPODOS. So Thy first Fathers, so others fare'd Before, and since Thy great Translation; And if to' escape 'twas not for some so hard, The Works they wrote, were their Fames best Foundation; In which an Age they live, That Brass, and Marble shall survive. So Jewel ever lives, And life to' his very Enemy gives. So shall Thy Reverend Lord Long hence be Thine, and His own best Record. Hast to Him Muse, and take At 'his Knees that blessing, which may Thee Immortal make. To the Right Reverend FATHER IN GOD, SETH Lord Bishop of SARUM. Mindful, whence first she learnt the early Skill, In humble strains Almighty LOVE to sing; And then of Her, to whom she' her Works does bring, The CHURCH, and Colledg, both whose Names instil Like Sentiments, and shall Fames Records fill With Worthies, fit to 'employ the Noblest string Of Heav'n-tun'd Verse, and almost tire its Wing, To bear them, hence translated, up its Hill: My Muse to You, my LORD, and your great Name, This LEGEND of the one, and t'other LOVE, (As different as their Ends and Natures prove) Doubly inscribes; that thence her purer Flame To Heav'n, so offer'd, may more grateful rise; The grosser Parts be Wood for th' Sacrifice. FINIS. A PARAPHRASE UPON Some Select HYMNS OF THE New and Old TESTAMENT, With some other Occasional Compositions IN English RIMES. The VI great HYMNS of St. LUKE. I. HYMN. The ANGELS Salutation. Ave Gratiâ plena. Lucæ 1. 28. Hail of Heaven highly Grace'd, Hail, O VIRGIN full of Grace! Heav'ns Blessings all on Thee be place'd, In whom Heav'ns GOD takes up his Place! Blest Thou among all Women be, Blest be Thy Name and Memory, Blest VIRGIN-MOTHER be Thy Stile to' Eternity! II. HYMN. The Salutation of ELIZABETH. Benedicta Tu inter Mulieres. Lucæ 1. 42. I Blest Thou among all Women be, And blest the FRUIT, which Thou dost bear! But whence is this great Honour done to me, That my LORD'S MOTHER should approach thus near And greater joys supprest at Home, In mine to 'assist should hither come? II Yet not at Home those greater Joys, Tho there supprest, couldst Thou wholly leave; For scarce was heard Thy salutations Voice, But my glad Womb the Signal did receive: And there with joy the Babe did spring, It's present GOD to' attest, and King. III Thrice blest the Faith, which firm does hold! For a Performance there shall be Of all, that was by th' Heav'nly Message told, And, or Thy happy FRUIT concerns, or Thee; The Sender was the Eternal Lord, Who having past will Crown his Word. III. HYMN. The Song of the BLESSED VIRGIN. Et ait Maria,—Magnificat anima, &amp;c. Lucæ 1. 47. I My SOUL does Magnifie the Lord, My Spirit in God my Saviour does rejoyce; My Spirit his thankful Praises shall record, And my Soul, thence awak't, provoke my Voice: Nor Soul, nor Spirit, my Judgment, or my Will, My Voice, or Lyre, shall in his Praise lie still, But all my Powers I'll summon, and their noblest skill. II For (Lo!) his Hand-Maids low estate, He from on High has view'd with kind regard; His Hand-Maids, to th' encrease of whose sad Fate, The Royal Blood, from whence she sprang, prest hard: But now all Nations shall Record me BLEST, And David's Seed, of David's Throne possest, To' his Blood the Glory shall return, to' his Land its rest. III Great are the things, which He hath done, And done for me, who' Himself is great of Might; Great tho He be, 'tis Holiness alone, Wherein He of all Names does most delight: All but of's Mercy, which in him the same, He to Gen'erations therefore does Proclaim, And keep with them, who fear Him, and his Holy Name. IV To all beside, by His Arm He is known, And strength Almighty, which none can repel; His Arm, that from their height the Proud pulls down, And open throws their Plots hid deep as Hell: That Kings and Kingdoms at its Will does sway, And gives their Crowns to those ith' dust who lay, With good things th' Hungry fills, the' Rich empty sends away. V Israel thus hath He fill'd, thus rais'd, And rais'd up thus, will with his Hand uphold; Israel his First-born; And our God be prais'd, Who mindful of th' Inheritance past of Old, Warrants to' His Child, and with it all Decreed By' His Word to our Fathers, to' Abraham and his Seed, And all whom Abraham's Faith makes Parties to the Deed. IV. HYMN. The Song of ZACHARIAS. Benedictus Dominus Deus Israel. Lucæ 1. 68. I Israels Great God eternally be Prais'd, Who Israel from the Dust at length hath rais'd; And mindful of his Ancient Care, Forgotten, when we thought we were, Israel to visit has himself come down, The Prison Doors wide open thrown, And by th' Redemption wrought, made his great Presence known. II Redemption for his People has he wrought, And to the Throne the Royal Pris'ner brought; To David's Throne, and 'tis his Son Sprung from his Loyns, holds David's Throne; With Empire, which no place or time can bound, With Subjects, in all Countrys found, Subjects, which like him shall be Kings, and like him Crown'd. III This by his Prophets, which have been of old, In every Age he wondrously foretold; (For every Age have Prophets been, From since the World did first begin, This to foretel, which now we Celebrate;) That God our Wrongs would vindicate, And from one Ruine save us, and our threatned State. IV Not for our Righteousness, but to perform The Mercy promis'd, and his Covenant sworn; Promis'd the Fathers, who first were, But which himself did to' Abraham swear, By Oath most Sacred; for to be no more Doubted, tho stablisht 'twas before, By' himself, Heav'ns greatest Oath, the God most Highest swore. V So God most Highest, so by' Himself he Swore, And that from Heav'n we should receive the Power, (Deliver'd from our Enemies Hands, Their Captive Chains and Servile Bands) His own more Noble Service to attend, Fearless of all that may offend, In Righteousness, and holy Praise, which ne're shall end. VI And now he comes, O Child, who this hath wrought; He comes, who has the great Salvation brought: Be thou his Prophet, and his Ways Prepare, while He a moment stays, Only till thou before Him canst prepare His Ways, which deep and wondrous are, By laying down his own, the Life o'th' World to spare. VII Teach the World, Child, and make his Israel know Whence their Salvations mighty Source does flow; That from Remission of their Sin, The mighty Source does first begin: Through our God's tender Mercy, who the Way To Pardon does by Penance lay; Penance, which does the glories of his Grace display. VIII That Grace, whereby the Day-spring from on High, Now visits us with Streams, which ne're shall die. Streams of pure Æthereal Light, To shine on those, who in darkness sit; Which Death's pale shadow shall with Rays encrease, And hopes long Pris'ners thence release, And both theirs guide, and our feet into th' way of Peace. V. HYMN. The ANGELIC Hymn. Gloria in Altissimis, &amp;c. Lucæ 2. 24. Glory be to God on High! Ith' Highest Great Jehovah bless! Good will tow'rds Men, on Earth be Peace! Glory to God on High! And may this Round, begun thus, last eternally. VI. HYMN. The Song of SIMEON. Nunc dimittis servum tuum, &amp;c. Lucæ 2. 29. I Enough, my God, enough! I beg no more: Nor Thou, tho begg'd, canst greater Grace bestow; My Prayers at length are answer'd, and I 'adore The Word, which from thy Mouth did go, The Word, which like thy Self no change does know: And now Thy Servant is content to die, Now, as the best time, since Thy Word and Life's so nigh. II Nigh is the Word, which Thou to me didst pass, Nor has Death come, me and Thy CHRIST between; As nigh is Life, Thy other Word, which I embrace, And who, that has thus happy been, In two great Words, fulfill'd one, t'other seen, Would not like me desire in peace to die, And mortal Life exchange for Immortality? III In Peace I die, and Thou dismissest me, My God, in Peace, since with these very Eyes, Before their change, I Thy Salvation see, And lack not from the Dead to rise, As Prophets must to 'approve their Prophecies: By Faith they only at a distance saw, What in my Arms I hold, the end of all their Law. IV Hail, blest Salvation of the Eternal King! Hail Thou, who hither bringst it, Blessed Child! In whom, as holy Bards inspir'd do sing, Those wondrous Truths shall be fulfill'd, Which to Immortal Verse shall subject yield! Hail to you both, prepar'd of God to be, This Worlds Redemption, Heav'ns and Angels scrutiny! V Such is the great Behest; such is Thy Will, Who now before all Nations dost prepare What shall with joyous Praise all Nations fill, As in Him all have equal share: Thy Son, who shall to those who' in darkness are, Rise, as the World's Sun does, with scattered Light, But Israels Glory be, with Rays like 'his own Flames bright. Comiato. To Sir Nicholas Stuart, Baronet. Songs, made in lieu of many more, (And more than Songs,) which to his Love I owe, Who, when your Master waited at the Door, First let him in, and sacred Honours did bestow; (You, blessed Songs, ith' Temple first to sing, And then to Descant, on an humbler thing.) To his, and your lov'd Patron go, And tho you ne're can recompence The ease, and leasure both of us have thence, Proffer the utmost service Verse can do; And as He is your Ornament, Be of my grat'itude and his Virtue the fixt Monument. The VIII Great HYMNS of the Apocalyps. I. HYMN. The Adoration of the XXIV ELDERS. Gratias agimus tibi Domine Deus Optime. Apoc. 11. 17. I Worthy Thou art all Honour to receive, Thrice Honour'd we, who may that Honour give, Blest King, who in One undivided now, The scatter'd Parts of Time collected, hast, The Future, Present, and the Past; And every Time and Age dost in one moment know. II We praise Thee', Almighty God, for that Thou' hast tane To Thee thy great Power, and at length dost Reign; Thou Reign'st, and tho the Nations troubled are, Thy Wrath is come, and therewith come the Time, When Thou wilt sentence every Crime, And all the Dead shall for the Great Assize prepare. III Up shall they rise; and as their Works have been, Or Shame, or Glory, on all Brows be seen; Thy Prophets, and Thy Saints shall shout for joy, And all who fear Thy Name, both small and great; But Vengeance, from Thy Judgment Seat, Th' Earths bold Destroyers shall eternally destroy. II. HYMN. The Acclamation of Heaven, upon MICHAEL's overthrow of the Dragon and his Angels. Nunc facta est Salus &amp; Virtus, &amp;c. Apoc. 12. 10. I Now is Salvation, now is come the Hour, That long expected, never shall be done; Now Reigns our God, with whom in equal Power, And strength Enthron'd, sits his Anointed Son: They Reign and Judg, and having Judgment past, The Brethrens great Accuser, or'e the Bar have cast. II Both Night and Day the Brethren he accus'd, Heav'ns common Barrettor, with Charge unjust; (Their Patience, and the Judges Grace abus'd) Tho from them the forg'd Calumny they thrust, And his false Evidence or'e-rul'd, bore down, By the Lambs Blood in Court attested, and their own. III These were the Pleas whereby they overcame, And these the Witnesses call'd, and allow'd; Which ev'n the Devil their slanderer heard with shame, And self-condemn'd, to the just Sentence bow'd: Greater their Word was than could be deni'd, But greater yet their Testimony, that they Di'd. IV For this, O Heav'ns, rejoyce, and ye who there In Sacred Bliss uninterrupted dwell, Rejoyce, and a part with you let them bear, Who from below shall of your Justice tell! With joy shall Sing, how the' Dragon overthrown, From Heav'ns high-top to th' Earth was tumbled down. V But wo worth you, to whom in wrath he's come, Of Earth and Sea the miserable 'out-cast, On whom he'll seek to be aveng'd, the Doom Was on himself, and curs'd Abettors past; With rage he comes, and whole Hells last effort, Fury incenst, because he knows his time's but short. III. HYMN. The Happy Dead. Beati mortui qui in Domino moriuntur. Apoc. 14. 13. I Blest are the Dead who in the Lord depart, From henceforth Blessed write them down! For Labours tho, and Pain they have known, Of neither feel they more the irksome smart. II So says the Spiri't; for but to' enjoy full rest, From all their Toils are they remov'd; And of their Works, by God approv'd, That follow close, in Bliss they are possest. IV. HYMN. The Song of MOSES and of the LAMB. Magna &amp; Mirabilia sunt opera, &amp;c. Apoc. 15. 3. I Great are thy Works, and marvelous thy Praise, Lord God Almighty, just and true Thy Ways, Blest King of Saints; who would not fear In Thy dread Presence to appear, Whom Angels, and attending Thrones revere? II Who would not Fear Thee, Lord, and Glorifie That Name of Thine, which Thou hast rais'd so high! Thy Holy Name by which Thou art known, (For Holiness is Thine alone,) But better, than each single Man by' his own. III Take then, Blest King, what is Thy proper due, And through all Lands and Coasts, Thy Right persue! That eve'ry Coast and every Land, Who wondring at thy Judgments stand, May Worship Thee, and stoop to their Command. V. HYMN. The Angel of the Waters Lauds. Justus es Domine qui es &amp; qui eras, &amp;c. Apoc. 16. 5. I Righteous art Thou, O God, who art, and wast, I. Angel. And shalt be, when all time is past, The first who reignedst, and the last: Righteous art Thou, who hast this Day, Thy Kingdoms Justice to display, Righteously judg'd, that Blood shall Blood repay. II Thy Servants Blood they without mercy shed, And to be' aveng'd of th' happy Dead, Made by curst hands the Living bleed: With big swoln Veins Thy Prophets stood, Each Saint, the Genius of his Flood, Pour'd from his opened Heart true streams of Blood. III For Blood they thirsted; and to drink have now II. Angel. Pure Blood, wherewith their Rivers flow: So worthy they, so Righteous Thou! Et audivi alterum dicentem, Etiam Domine. So Righteous Thou, so worthy they, Who did Thy Saints, and Prophets slay, For Blood to' have Blood, and Blood in Blood repay. VI. HYMN. The holy Company of Heaven rejoycing at the overthrow of BABYLON. Allelu-ja. Laus &amp; Gloria &amp; Virtus. Apoc. 9. 1. I Hallelujah! To our King, Honour, Power, and Glory sing: Laud and Worship to Him bring, True and Righteous are whose Ways; Both deserves, and has our Praise. II True and Righteous is his Doom, For in Judgment overcome, Chain'd the great Whore stands, and Dumb: Chain'd she stands, and Dumb withal, Without Friend, or Voice to call. III Judg'd she is, who th' Earth did stain With her Prostituted Train: Justly judg'd to 'Eternal Pain, And aveng'd the Blood she shed, Dying ever, is never dead. Et dixerunt iterum Halleluja. IV Hallelujah; to our King Worship, Laud, and Praises bring, Glory, Power, and Honour sing! Lo! how up her Smoke does rise, Who dead ever, never Dies! Ceciderùntque viginti quatuor Seniores, &amp;c. &amp; dixerunt Amen, &amp;c. V Even so, Lord, be it so! That the Earth Thy Power may know, And thence make Thy Praise to grow! One bless'd Song with us may sing, Halleluja to our King! VII. HYMN. Epithalamium on the LAMBS Marriage. Et vox de Throno exivit dicens, laudem dicite Deo, &amp;c. Apoc. 19. 5. I. Praise Him, ye Servants of th' Eternal King, To God your noblest Praises sing, And make Heav'ns vault with the loud Eccho ring! Praise Him, all ye, who fear his Name, And o're th' Expanse his Lauds proclaim; Both great and small in tuneful Shouts accord, And with one Heart and Voice adore our Lord! Et audivi quasi vocem turbæ magnæ, &amp; sicut vocem aquarum multaram &amp; sicut vocem tonitruorum magnorum dicentium Alleluja! quoniam, &amp;c. II. Hallelujah! Sing aloud! Lowder still th' harmonious Voice, Till it drown a Thunders Noise, And with gay Horror fill th' admiring Crowd! For (Lo!) our God Omnipotent does Reign, And to himself resumes the Rule again. III. Let us be glad now, and let us rejoyce, And give him due Honour, who made us this Day; A Day that compensates for all our Annoys, And Ages that we for its Coming did pray: The Lamb's Marriage-day, which tho long e're it came, We meet, and greet thus with our Songs purest flame. IV. 'Tis come, and does with hallow'd Glory shine, So bright a Day in Heav'n did ne're appear, (Tho ever Day, and bright 'tis ever there) As this, illumin'd by the Sun Divine, And for 'his own Nuptials made with high Design. But yet how bright so e're it is, His Bride new Lustre to it gives, Who in her Glory waits Him, as He her in his. V. See, where She stands array'd in Glorious wise, Second alone to Him, who ever lives: Above the boldest flight wing'd Seraph strives, Who ne're such Beauties with Immortal Eyes, E're gaz'd on, save in Him whose is the Prize. For beside what's Her proper Dower, (Charms, which th' Almighty overcame) Heav'n all its riches on Her Dress does pour. VI. Choice of rich Garments has She thence, and store, (Presented from the Wardrobe of the Lamb) Of Gems that blaze with an Ethereal flame, Enough all but the Wearer to devour, And all but Heav'n to apprize them find too poor: Choice of fine Linnen, clean and bright, Beyond the skill of Mortal Art, Washt in the Lambs pure Blood, and there made White. VII. These are Her Robes, and these Her Lord's delight, (Who from His Presence ne're will let Her part, But thus Array'd, resigns to Her his Heart) The Righteousness of th' Saints, with sacred Light, Communicated from his own blest Sight. Thrice happy they, thrice happy he! Who when their Mortal Life is done, The Bridgroom's Friends, to' his Supper call'd shall be! L'envoy. Thrice happy I, my God, if I be one, One of the few, whom then Thou shalt invite! No matter how Thou shalt dispose of me, The meanest service Regal Honours does impart. VIII. HYMN. The Exultation of Heaven, at the Descent of the New JERUSALEM. Et audivi magnam vocem de Throno dicentem, Ecce Tabernaculum Dei cum, &amp;c. Apoc. 21. 5. I Blest state of Innocence, When out of his just Makers Hand, The first Man came, with sacred influence, If what he might, he' had kept the' unhard Command! But happier far that state, To which he is restored, tho late, By him, who, (made Man) Man did first Create! II A greater Work this was, (As to redeem it more did cost, Than barely make;) the one by a Word did pass, His Life, the WORD to' effect the other lost; But there-with did provide, What none could hope, or do beside, That they should th' happiest be, for whom he Died. III Happy were both, but these By this the more, that when God went To Paradise, himself in' his Works to please, And pleas'd to Heav'n strait took his great Ascent; A longer stay below, To make with his Redeemed now, Heav'ns richest Grace he does on Earth bestow: IV For now (behold!) his Tent With Man is pitcht, and there Hee'l dwell, Late to return; and I'm his Herald sent, The mighty News to the whole World to tell; That God to Man comes down, With Man to dwell, as Man be known, Whose Form assum'd, he keeps still joyn'd to' his own. V With them Hee'l dwell, and they His People, he their God will be; Not as of Old alone, but in a way Unthought, and of exalted Dignity: Where each Relations Band, By various Titles on each hand, Made Indissoluble, fast knit does stand. VI God from their Eyes all Tears Away shall wipe, they in his Praise Endless Eternity shall spend: No fears, No sighs more tempests in their Brests shall raise: Eve'n Death shall be no more, Nor Sin, that to it op'd the Door, Nor pain: for former things are all past or'e. VII Past o're they are, and gone, So says the Faithful and the True, The High, the Holy God, who from his Throne Pronounces thus, (Lo!) I make all things New! And thou to whom it's made known, O Man belov'd, The words write down, Nor doubt; for he who does it, says, 'Tis done. Our Blessed Lord's Thanksgiving. Confiteor tibi Pater Domine. Matt. 11. 25. I I thank Thee, Father, Lord of all, Of Heav'n, and Earth the Blessed King, That to reveal Thy Discipline, The Prudent of this World Thou dost not call, The Mighty, Noble, and the Wise; But such, whom they, as Foolish, Base, and Weak despise. II From those Thou hast Thy Counsels hid, Who first Thy Counsels did refuse; And Babes to publish them dost chuse, That no Flesh take what Power Almighty did, And when Thy Hand alone hath done The weighty Enterprise, ascribe it to their own. III Eve'n so, O Father, so it is! Thy Will, Thy Love do hence appear, And that great Power, which every where In all things Rules, but more in none than this; For so to Thee it seemeth good, Thy Grace should none withstand, but those who it withstood. The Song of MOSES. —Tunc cecinit Moyses, &amp; Filii Israel carmen hoc Domino; &amp; dixerunt, Cantemus Domino, &amp;c. Exod. 15. ?????????. I. Since the Almighty has in Triumph led, Not by our Battels, but his Arm o're-thrown, The Proud Egyptian King, and from his Head, On ours to put it, tane the Crown, What more accepted Trophy can we raise, Than an eternal arch of Duty and of Praise? Begin, my Song and thou Immortal Verse, (Now truly such, since him Thou dost Record, Who only is th' Immortal Lord) I my self will begin too, and rehearse The wondrous Conquests of his Word: To him I'll Sing, who gloriously, His Promise, and his Ancient Faith to keep, Has gotten himself, and us the Victory, And Horse, and Rider hurld, at once, into the Deep. II. God is my Strength, and he shall be my Song, From whom my great Salvation came; Who is my God, approv'd in dangers long, My Father's God, the Puissant, and the Strong, Israel's tri'd Champion, and Jehovah is his Name. Him will I Sing, of him shall be my Praise, And of the Works, that he hath done; Th' Eternal Glories he hath won, But ours no less, than his own Fame to raise. For Pharao and his host, (Their way, their hopes, themselves ith' Ruine lost) Into the Sea he hurld, the Red Sea, as a Stone By a Giants arm is lightly thrown, Him and his chosen Captains at a cast. They flew; they sank; the wounded Sea did groan, But into it's bottom headlong let them down, Through thousand Waves that murmured, as along they whirling past. III. There were they Drownd; there cover'd with the Deep; There sank they, never to be rais'd again; In Adamantine Chains Thou didst the Pris'ners keep, The same Thou threwst before upon the Main, And now on them, o're both to show Thy equal Reign. Glorious Thou didst that Day, O Lord, appear; Glorious in Power appear'd then thy Right Hand; Thine Enemies the Shock could not withstand, And found too late its Wrath was heavier than their fear; When dasht in pieces they all scattered lay, And to th' Leviathans became a Prey. So on a sudden were they gone, So soon, so eas'ly, by Thy Breath o're-thrown, As when a raging Fire does Stubble seise, And with it Thorns, to' unequal Battel press. Such was Thy Wrath, tho in a different kind, (And different was the Element, But Death as certain, and as sudden sent) Thy Wrath tow'rds them, which like a mighty Wind Stood up and up the Floods bid stand, As on an heap to let Thy People go; The Floods obey'd the great Command, And like a Wall, on either Hand, Of congeal'd Chrystal, in the heart of th' Sea did show. IV. This as the Spoyler saw, “Tis now, he said, “Now is the time an end to make; “I will pursue, I will o're-take, “Lo! how the Sea the Fugitives has betray'd, “And, to leave us a way, its dri'd up Channel do's forsake! “Now shall my Sword with slaughter glutted be, “My Lust shall on them now be satisfied, “Nor till they 'are totally destroyed, “This Arm withdraw, or let them other Conquerors see; “With Charms their Leader staind the sacred Flood, “But I'll the Sea, or perish, new Dye with their Blood. Scarce said; Thou with Thy Wind Upon the parted Sea didst blow; The parted Sea its hold invisible let go, And hollow'd to its fellow Waves behind. They came; and having traverst them around; The Chamiam Hosts did in their Arms enclose; A while they floated, diving where they rose, Till touching thrice the fatal Ground, Like Lead they sank, and all the Deaths they had threatned, found. V. Amongst the Gods, Who is there like the Lord? Or with Him, who can once compare? So 'unsearchable His Counsels are, So great the Wonders of His Word; In holy Glories, who does all excel, And Terrour strikes in us, who would his Praises tell. For Thou thy Hand didst only wave, And Israels way was Egypts Grave, Which th' opening Earth, and Seas, conspiring gave. Thus perisht they: Thus sav'd by Thy Right Hand, Thy ransom'd People hitherto Thou' hast brought; Whilst of the Miracles it wrought, We and our Children living Monuments here stand. Nations shall hear this, Lord, and be afraid; Horrour on Palestine fast hold shall take; Courage the Dukes of Edom shall forsake: And Moabs daring Warriers, ill appaid, Shall on themselves feel unknown Terrors laid: Whole Canaan ready to expire, With dread dissolv'd, as Wax shall melt before the Fire. VI. Trembling and Fear, Anguish, Dispair, and Dread, On every Land shall fall, on every Head. As Thine Arm is, such shall their Horrours be, And not a Soul from the' Consternation free. Close shall they lie within their Dens, Still as the Rocks, wherewith they are cover'd, lie; And fearful once to issue thence, Scarce to their helpless Gods send forth a cry, Or let their Groans be heard, while Israel passes by. Till to Thy Promis'd Land they' are come, And, where they have been strangers long, their ancient Home. Thither, my God, through thousand dangers past, To Sion, by Thy self prepar'd to be Thy Dwelling Place to 'Eternity, The Sanctuary, with Thy Presence grac'd, Thither be pleas'd Thy purchas'd Flock to bring at last! So shalt Thou through all Ages Reign, And in all Lands new Subjects to Thy Empire gain. Sumpsit ergo Maria Prophetissa soror Aaron tympanum in manu suâ: egressæque sunt omnes Mulieres post eam cum tympanis, &amp; choris, quibus præcinebat dicens. CHORUS Mulierum. Sing to the Lord, who gloriously, His Promise, and his Ancient Faith to keep, Has gotten Himself, and us the Victory, And Horse, and Rider hurld at once into the Deep!

Sacred Fountain, Mystic Spring, Lo! how to Thy Dance we Sing, And Cymbals tun'd by thy soft Purlings ring! Spring eternally, O Well, Spring up, and into Rivers swell! For why, no common Well art Thou, Nor was it chance first found Thee out; But having for Thee searcht about, To Princes Thou thy rise dost owe, Who digg'd Thee first, and made Thee flow. Spring, happy Well, by Princes made, Without or Mattocks help, or Spade, (The' ill-boading Instruments of Graves) But digg'd by Princes, with their Staves, And by their Lawgiver survey'd! 'Twas He to th' Work those Worthies sent; Spring Well, and teach his great Intent, And what He by the Mystery meant! “That as to all Thy Waters flow, “So should their equal Justice do. Sacred Fountain, Mystic Spring, Lo! how to Thy Dance we Sing, And Cymbals tun'd by Thy soft purlings Ring! Spring Eternally, O Well, Spring up, and into Rivers swell! The Prayer of JABEZ. —Invocavit autem Jabez Deum Israel, dicens. Si benedicens benedixeris mihi, &amp; dilataveris terminos meos, &amp; fuerit manus tua mecum, &amp; feceris me à malitia non opprimi!—Et præstitit Deus quæ precatus est. 11. Part. 4. I Thus Jabez pray'd, and thus pray I; Great God, O, that it might Thee please, Thy Servant, who upon Thee does relie, With Thy choice Favours, and indeed to bless! Tis Prayer alone can this obtain, And, but to Thee, even Prayer is vain. II Enlarge those Coasts, wherein I dwell, Nor let me ever live retir'd; But in Thy CHURCH those mighty Wonders tell, Which have my Verse with Heav'nly Flame inspir'd: Lord to my House Thy Love secure, And let it, like Thy Word, endure! III Yet not for Greatness do I pray, Nor, e're Thy Time is, to be known; But do Thy Will, I can its Pleasure stay, Waiting that Harvest, for which Thou hast sown: Only till then, make me content, And leave to Thee th' whole Management! IV Thou know'st I do Thy Temple love, I know there's time enough behind; Why should I make th' Enjoyment bitter prove, By hasting, what I'm sure Thou hast design'd? In hope at present, I rejoyce, And both my Heart employ and Voice. V For what concerns my poor estate, Since I to Thee my All commit; No time, when e're it falls, shall be too late, To soon it may, if I encumber it With Wishes, that unlawful be, And vain affects, which move not Thee: VI No! I'll never think the time too long, How long so e're the time may be; Let but Thy Hand, through Patience make me strong, And keep off Evil from disturbing me! If Jabez thus to Thee did cry, And could be heard, Lord, why not I? Hæc Sacrorum Ordinum desiderio raptus, mihimet ipsi meus Vates, cecini, III Nonas Decemb. M. DC. LX. VII.

Israel, the blest and happy State, For whom th' Almighty all his Wonders show'd; Israel, your great Redeemer celebrate, And what for you he did, rehearse aloud! Tell, how he made his hand appear, And when the willing Tribes their Youth an Off'ring sent, How God before the Sacred Army went, And vengeful Ruine follow'd in the Reer! And ye, O Kings, (whose awful Sway The many-headed Multitude obey, And at whose feet they both their Necks and Tributes lay;) Princes and Rulers, to my Song attend, Whose lofty Subject challenges your Ear, By all that can a Verse commend, Or greatest Kings perswade to hear, A tuneful Voice, with Charms divinely strong, A Woman begs your audience now; And if that will not do, Deb'rah a Judg in Israel sings, and Israels God's the Song. II. Domine cum exires de Seir. Lord, out of Seir, when Thou didst go, Marching the Hill, before Thine Host adown, When Thou mad'st Edoms Fields Thy Conquests know, And with Arm'd Troops the Wilderness didst crown; Affrighted Earth did at Thy Presence quake, Heav'ns labo'ring Machin did the Warning take, And from its torn sides dreary Tempests shake. It thundred, and down fell from Heavens high Tow'r, Of Stones and scalding Rain a mighty show'r; With Darkness all the Sky was cover'd o're, Through which the blew-wing'd Lightning flew, And after it a trail of kindled Brimstone drew. It strook the Rocks, and they took fire; The Mountains with excessive heat did melt, Unusual scorchings Sinai felt; And tho than other Hills exalted higher, Tho with its head it did to th' Clouds aspire, Sinai nor could resist, nor bear the Flame, But down in a burning Torrent headlong came. III. In diebus Samgar, &amp;c. Samgar and Jahel wondrous Saviours were, And did in Counsel and in Arms excel; Of Jahels Prudence we the Trophies are, Six hundred Philistims by Samgar fell, All with an Ox-goad slain, and driv'n like Beasts to Hell. But yet the Roads untrodden lay, Scar'd Passengers through Woods did stray, And but to Dens &amp; Caves led not the Mountainous highway. Woods, and thick Bushes in all Pastures grew, The Plough-man, and his Labour ceast, The Land as Curst enjoy'd its rest, And not each Seventh alone, but every Year a Sabbath knew. It rested, till I Debora rose at last, At last in Israel I a Mother rose, Then when new Gods the People chose, And from Rebellion to Idolatry had past. But see the Vengeance that pursu'd their Sin, Slavery and Cowardise at the Breach rusht in, And not a Shield, or Spear was found midst forty thousand Men. IV. Cor meum diligit Principes, &amp;c. Fly, fly, my Muse, from this unmanly race, And to new Pomps thy strains address; Israels great Generals, who to efface Of all our foregone Miseries the very trace, Couragiously did to the Battel press, And, where in Irons we lay, with Laurels strew'd the place. With them my Heart, with them my Praise shall be. And ye, O Fathers, who at Home reside, And you, who equal Justice to dispense, Unguarded to your peaceful Cities ride, And Justice done, return unguarded thence; Judges, and People by their arms set free, Come in and joyn with me, And let us bless the Lord, as we their Spoils divide! Come let us bless Him, and proclaim The Wonders of his Reverend Name; There, whence we exil'd were of late, And at our Fountains first begin, Where we so oft have rescu'd been, Scaping the Death we saw upon the Wing; Our Fountains tuneful numbers will inspire, And by their purling falls direct the Quire, Which well tun'd there, we may advance in state, And bring with Harps and Songs our Praises to the City Gate. V. Surge, surge Debora, surge, &amp;c. Awake, O Debora, awake, And from this hint fresh vigour take! Encourage, and provoke Thy Lyre, Till all its speaking Chords conspire, And with Thy Voice a perfect Concert make! Up Barak, at th' harmonious Sound, Abinoams warlike Son arise! Lo! Thy Captivity stands in Fetters bound, To be Thy valours early Prize, And dreadfully adorn Thy entrance with its Exequies! Lead on, Great Prince, by God ordain'd To be Thy Nations Glory, and this Days; Who hast Thy self the heat of th' War sustain'd; Tho Women with Thee share divided Praise! And all the while Thou dost the sacred Mount ascend, Boldly Thy Ransom'd Peoples shouts attend, The Bays Thou wearest will Thy Head defend! Yea, speak Thy self, how God made Thee, The Captain of his Armies be; And when retir'd Thou long hadst lain at Home, How forth he call'd Thee to o'recome: The strange deliv'erance by Thy Hands he wrought, And how to mine he Judgment gave; And let the Tribes, which with us fought, A just Memorial in our Triumphs have! VI. Ex Ephraim delevit eos. Place Ephraim here, Ephraim whose Fortitude In Amaleks first overthrow was try'd, When stoutly he th' Uncircumcis'd defi'd, And with unerring Shafts their flying Troops pursu'd. Benjamin, with his Squadron follow'd close, And his scorn'd Life more nobly to expose, The Tribe, he dearest lov'd, for witness of his Courage, chose. From Machir Princes to the Battel came, And Counsellors from Zabulon, Who to encrease the glory of their Name, Kept by the Sword, what by the Pen they won. Then Issachar and Napthali, By Debora that, and this by Barak led, Both valiant Tribes, and both resolv'd to die, Or conquer with so brave an Head. But had you seen the Emulation there, And how they strove each other to out-fight; You would have thought them arm'd with Heav'nly Might, And (all so terrible they did appear Such Trophies of Mail'd Corps did round them rear,) That every Isra'elite a destroying Angel were. VII. Diviso contra se Ruben. Ruben the while did with his Flocks abide, And blest the Flood, whose streams the parted Land divide. Careless of what his Brethr'en thought, And what the fears his cold indifference wrought; Strange and distracted fears his cold indifference brought. But why, O Ruben, why didst thou refuse An Enterprize so great and good? Was it to hear thy bleating Ews; Or could thy Honour be so little understood, That their plain Fleeces thou shouldst chuse, Before a Robe di'd Purple, in thine Enemies blood? This cold indifference, Ruben, lost thee more, Than ever thou in Arms hadst gain'd before. Ah! hadst thou been alone! but far behind, By thy example, Gilead stai'd; On Shipboard Dan drove on his Trade, And Asser, that he might be signally unkind. Tho of pale Death too Womanly affraid, Rather than yield his aid, Watcht on his naked Beaches, torn with Seas and Wind. Unlike to Zabulon, and Nepthali, Who best knew how to Live, yet fear'd the least to Die. VIII. Zabulon vero &amp; Nepthali, &amp;c. Thither, my Song, behold their Ensigns spred On the High-places, and how equally endu'd With Learning, and with Conduct too, they shew'd, That never friendlier those best gifts inhabited, And softer thoughts designs more noble bred. The Cananitish Kings approacht the Hill, Tabor, by their defeat to be renown'd, But fearful to ascend its top, did fill The Plains of Tanaach, with their Camps around, And lowd Megiddos Waters with their shoutings drown'd. They came, and fought, but Heav'n, that took our part, Bore the first shock, and on them turn'd the War; A mortal shaft was sent from every Star, Which sank like Lead, into the Spoilers Heart. No Gain or Pay, the Sacred Legions took, But to the Service arm'd, in Diamond marcht on, And, whom they spar'd, Kison, that ancient Brook, Kison in its swoln Torrent carri'd down. In vain the Horse assay'd the Flood to stem, Which hurld their Riders with them down the rapid stream. IX. Conculca Anima mea robustos. Enough, my Soul, enough, the chase give o're! Those Enemies thou hast seen, thou shalt behold no more. Stop, for at length the War is done, And thou in Blood, I know, tak'st no delight! Sound a Retreat, the Day's thine own, And so shall Sisera too, e're Night, Finding the Death he'd shun by an inglorious flight. But first confirm a Curse was laid By our God's Angel, and a Charge divine, “Curse ye Meros, the Angel said! “Curse Meros bitterly, and join Yours to Jehovah's Curse and mine! Curse all, who dwell there, and be this their Doom, Who like them to th' Almighty's standard will not come! But blessed above Women be, Israels and Hebers Ornament, Jahel above all Women blest ith' Tent. And let this Song preserve her Memory! Never was greater Name Recorded, ith' Eternal Monuments of Fame. X. Aquam petenti lac dedit. To her on foot Sisa'ra his flight addrest: The courteous Wife to meet him went: The courteous Wife invited him into her Tent, And future Joys with thoughtful Cares supprest. He askt her Water, and she ran in haste, To execute her own, and to prevent his Wish, And pour'd him Milk into a Royal Dish: (A ready and a quick repast.) And having give'n the fatal Bait, Humbly at his Feet did wait, And smil'd to see how greedily he drank and slept his last. “Sleep, Tyrant, sleep she said! And up a Nail and Hammer took, The Nail into his Temples struck, And with his own unbloody Sword smote off his Head. He bowd, he fell, and at her Feet he lay, Down at her Feet he bow'd, fell, groan'd his Soul away, Where he bow'd, there he fell down dead. XI. Per fenestram respiciens. Out at a Window his blith Mother gaz'd, And waiting there his coming, cry'd, “Why lies the Dust so long unrais'd, “Nor Sisara yet, with Captives by his side, “Exalted high in his triumphal Chariot ride? Her Ladies answer'd her, Those Ora'cles of her Court, Yea, to her self she made her own report. “Have they not sped, have they not gain'd the Day, “Have they not shar'd the Israelitish Prey? “To every Man a Dame, or two, “To Sisara as the General's due, “Choice of rich Slaves, and choice of Garments too? “A curious Vest, with Needles wrought, “With curious Needles wrought on either side, “And all in Royal Colours dy'd, “By th' Hebrews of their Neighbour Tyrians bought; “And only fit the Victors bloody arms to hide? So, Lord, may all Thine Enemies die, So Conquer, and be Conquered so; When such, as on Thy Power relie, In Heav'n alone their equals know, And like the Sun, which triumphs there, Crown'd with illustrious Beams, and robe'd in Light appear. Comiato. To the Reverend the now Dr. James Gardiner Sub-Dean of Lincoln. Song, in the Country little understood, For my dear Gardiner, at the Town inquire, And all thy heat into his gen'rous Brest inspire, To mingle with a nobler Fire, Which lies at present smouldring in his Blood! Perchance thou may'st effectual prove, To make that upward, tow'rds its Center, move, And him in softest lays rehearse the HOLIEST LOVE. 1668. David's ELEGY Upon the death of Saul and Jonathan. Considera Israel pro hiis, qui mortui. 2 Sam. 1. I Israels delight, the glory of our Land, How are the Mighty overthrown! Before their Enemies Swords they could not stand, Nor conquer'd fall by any but their own: In Thy High-places Israel, both did fall, A publick Victim for their Land, in view of all. II Let not in Gath the mournful News be known, Nor in Philistia publish it; Stop the Report, e're it reach Ascalon, Nor let our Captive names their Arches fit: Lest fearful Women, whom they left at Home, With Songs to share the Spoil, and meet their Triumph come! III And ye, Gilboas Mounts, may never Rain, Or fertile Showres descend on you; But on your Heads let there abide that stain, Which Seas, should they pour down, would but renew: Let the curst Earth no more an Offering yield, Nor God expect his First-fruits from the empty Field. IV 'Twas there the valiant Saul resign'd his Breath, And there his Shield was thrown away; Never was such a Trophy rear'd to Death, Nor ever sacred arms so scattered lay: The valiant Saul's, as if he ne're had been The Lord's Anointed, or his Chosen Peoples King. V From the pursuit the Bow of Jonathan, Some Regal Spoil, did daily bring; Destruction after his fleet arrows ran, And at the Wounds they made, Death entred in: The Sword of Saul did never empty come, But a new Purple, from the Blood of Kings, brought home. VI Alike in Life, in Death alike they were, Not more in Blood ally'd, than Mind; Themselves alone, you with them could compare, Who none their equals saw, or left behind: And on their arms there hung such Victory, That Men they only seem'd, because they both could die. VII For as the Eagle, to her Prey does haste, And hovering o're the Quarry flies; Or the fierce Lion, having once a taste Of Blood, does all the Shepherds noise despise, And at their Slings no shew of fear does make; Like Lions they o're-came, like Eagles did o're-take. VIII And you, O Daughters of so great a King, (Our Tribes support) his Death lament, Whose Victories you before were wont to Sing, And clad in Scarlet to adorn them, went: Now put on Mourning, to attend his Hearse, Sad as your own complaints, and mournful as my Verse. IX For (Lo!) the Glories of our State, and Land, (Lo!) how the Mighty are o're-thrown; Before their Enemies Swords, they could not stand, Tho Saul by none could perish, but his own: In thy High-places, Jonathan, thou didst fall, A publick Victim, where thou shouldst have reigned o're all. X For thee, my Brother, 'tis for thee I grieve, The best of Friends, as well as Men; In whose Death I that fatal Wound receive, Which clos'd will ne're be, till we meet again; And in the Mansions of the Saints above, Enjoy, what here we vow'd, our more than mortal love. XI Israels Delight, the Glory of our Land, How are the Mighty overthrown! Before his Enemies Sword one could not stand, Nor th' other fall by any but his own: In thy High-places, Israel, both did fall, A publick Victim for their Land, in view of all. DAVID's Thansgiving and Prayer. —Ingressus est autem Rex David &amp; sedit coram Domino, &amp; dixit, Quis ego sum Domine &amp; quæ? 2 Sam. 7. I Who am I Lord, and what's my Family, 1 Paral. 17.The youngest House of the Jessean Race, In all things little, but that Grace, Which Thou on us hast shour'd, but most on me? Who am I, that Thou hitherto Hast brought me, Lord, Thy Bounty and Thy Power to show? II Hitherto Thou hast brought me, and that Hand, Which for a Sling, and Sheephook was design'd; A nobler Service is enjoyn'd, And Men, instead of Flocks, are my command: Israel the Flock, and care Divine, And my exalted Name does midst rich Trophies shine. III Like the great Mens of th' Earth, Thou' hast made my Name, And yet (as if all this were not enough, And thousand Pledges more of Love, But the foundation only of that Frame, Thou in Thy mind hadst cast to raise) Of future Glories Thou foretell'st, and growing Praise. IV Of Times to come Thou' hast told, long hence to come, And that my House, and Throne upheld shall be; Like a Prince born, Thou' hast treated me, As having, what Thou' art making for me room; And are Men, Lord, thus wont to do, Who rather than exalt the Poor, will keep them low? V Yet thus Thou' hast done, and what can I say more, Or greater, for Thy Honour, Lord, or mine, Which both here equal issues joyn, That all, who th' Work admire, may Thee adore? Greater I'd say, Thou knowst full well, And more, but what I know not, how I cannot tell. VI Unless I add, that for Thy great Words sake Thou didst it, that Thou mightst at once fulfil The secret Counsels of Thy Will, And, what they were, known to Thy People make: For Thine own sake, my God, and mine, For Thou thy Servant knowst, and that his will is Thine. VII Great art Thou, Lord, and wondrous are Thy Ways, The best and greatest, the only God alone; Beside, or like whom, there is none, Glorious in Holiness, fearful in Praise: Thus sing we, who did first receive The Truth from our Fore-fathers, but seeing, now believe. VIII For what one Nation, as from them of Old We' have often heard, with Israel can compare? For whom Himself God did not spare, But came from Heav'n in Person to behold The Mise'ries they did undergo, And not to see alone, but to Revenge them too? IX From Heav'n he came, from Heav'n himself came down All cloath'd in Tempest, and sulphureous Flame, To get Himself the greater Name, And do, what by His Word He might have done: That thus from Egypts Gods set free, Himself he might declare His Peoples God to be. X This our Fore-fathers told us; but we' have seen Our selves as mighty Wonders of Thy Love; Nor need we fetch from them our Proof, Who' our selves as mighty Wonders oft have been: Confirm'd by Thy after vast expence, (And more's to come) to be Thy great Inheritance. XI And now, my God, the Word, which Thou hast said, Th' irrevocable Word concerning me, Let it for ever stablisht be! And stablisht be that House, which Thou hast made! Thy Servant David, thus approv'd, Establish with his House, nor let them be remov'd. XII So shall Thy Word and Name be ever prais'd; “And Israels Holy God, shall Israel sing, “Is God alone, and Israel's King: “He His Anointeds Horn on high has rais'd, “Of David, and his House approv'd, “David and 'his House establisht ne're to be remov'd. XIII Not that I'm worthy, Thou shouldst hear my Vows, Only Thy self was pleas'd the Word to pass; Lord, since I 'have with Thee found this Grace, To be assur'd Thou 'lt build Thy Servants House, Another Grace turn not away, Which in my Heart I since have found, even thus to pray. XIV Thy Promise 'tis this holy boldness gives, That Word of Thine, which like Thy self is sure, And through all Ages shall endure, True, as its Speaker, who for ever Lives: The God of Truth, who cannot Lye, Nor his own Goodness, promis'd thus to his Child, deny. XV Please it Thee therefore, may it please Thee, Lord, Thy Servant, and Thy Servants House to bless, With Blessings that may never cease; Blessings, as fixt as Thy Eternal Word, For Thou, my God, canst bless alone, Thus bless; and once thus blessing me indeed, I'have done. 1677. The last words of DAVID. Dixit David filius Isai, dixit vir, &amp;c. 2 Sam. 23. Terzetti. Thus David, Jesse's Royal Son did sing, Thus spake the Man, who the great Promise had, That from his Loyns the CHRIST of God should spring. On whose Eternal Shoulders should be laid The Government, Psalmist of Israel, Thus sang he, thus from Heav'n inspir'd he said: The Spirit of God in Vision on me fell, And by my Mouth Himself th' Almighty spake, His Words they are, which I his Prophet tell, His, who the Care of Israel does take, And hitherto ne're falsifi'd His Trust, Nor will, tho Heav'n and Earths Foundations shake. “The Man, who rules o're others must be Just, “Ruling himself, and them, ith' sacred Fear “Of Heav'ns dread King, to whom account he must; “For all the wrongs he does, or makes them bear; “By an Impartial Judgment to be tri'd, “Whose Doom definitive he forc'd shall hear. Thrice happy Prince, who (e're that Oyes cry'd,) The God within his Brest, his Conscience, Appealing, and appeal'd has satisfi'd! There, first absolv'd, with approv'd Innocence, His Righteousness shall shine, as Morning Light, When th' early Sun, his Glories to dispense, New guilds the Sullys of the murky Night; And without Cloud between his Beams to pass, As higher he ascends, appears more bright. So shall he shine; or as the tender Grass, Shooting its verdant Head above the Ground, With gems of pearly Dew, midst Flowers, takes place. This I'll not say, that in my Rule I've found, A perfect and uninterrupted Bliss, (For what's my House, or Rule thus to be own'd?) Yet for my Kingdoms Justice I'll say this, That with me God a lasting Cove'nant made, In all things sure, as His great Promise is: Order'd and sure, nor e're to be o'resway'd, Tho I too oft have forfeited His Love, And when I should have rul'd, my Lusts obey'd. But even then did I, and do now reprove The Follies I so passionately pursu'd, And whose remembrance greater Passions move. Blest God forgive me! be Thy Word renew'd! For all before Thee is my whole desire, All in Thy sight, as it by me is view'd; Confirm Thy Promise, humbly I require, Not for my sake, O Lord, but for Thine own; And double Zeal into my Son inspire! So shall he grow up as a Plant alone, And in his Fame, tho dead, I too shall grow, The happy Father of an happier Son: Whilst those, who will not to his Scepter bow, As Thorns shall all of them be thrust away, Thorns, which th' unguarded Hand tho they pierce through, To th' Hook and Fire shall be an easie Prey: Justice, which in his time from th' Earth shall spring, And Peace, from Heaven descending, meet half way. The Song of HEZEKIAH. Ego dixi in dimidio dierum meorum. Isa. 38. I Revolving the sharp Sentence past, And how an end, e're thought was on me come; How soon, said I, have I approacht my last, And unawares reacht Natures farthest Home? Ah! now I to the Grave must go, No more, or Life, or Pleasure know, But a long doleful Night, in darkness deep below. II No more, my God, shall I see Thee, Nor the great Works of Thy Almighty Hand; No more a Votary at Thy Altar be, Nor in the crouds of them, who praise Thee, stand: Mankind no more shall I behold, Nor tell, nor of Thy Love be told, Eve'n mine to Thee, shall like my ashes, Lord, be cold. III Lo! as a Tent am I remov'd, And my lives thread, which I thought wondrous strong, Too weak to bear the Looms extension prov'd, Ith' midst broke off, too sleasie to run long: With Sickness I am pine'd away, And feel each moment some decay, All Night in Terrors, and in Grief die all the Day. IV For as a Lion hasts to 'his Prey, And having gripe'd it, breaks the yielding Bones; So on me came th' Almighty, whilst I lay In vain expecting help, but from my Groans: O take, said I, Thy Hand away, See how I feel my Loins decay, All Night in Terrors, and in Grief die all the Day! V Then like a Swallow, or a Crane, I chatt'red o're my Fears, his Heart to move; The widow'd Turtle does not more complain, When in the Woods she' has lost her faithful Love: My Eyes, O God, with waiting fail, Why shouldst Thou thus a Worm assail? I'm Thine, O let for once th' Almighty not prevail! VI Yet do Thy Will, I must confess, Worse Plagues than these, my Sins deserve from Thee; The Sentence past is than my Crimes far less, And only Hell a fit reward can be: Ah! let my Prayers that Doom prevent! My age in Mournings shall be spent, And all the Years Thou giv'st, shall be, but to repent. VII On Thy great Pleasure all depend, During which only, I and Mankind live; To teach us this Thou dost Diseases send, And daily claim'st the Life, which Thou didst give: Yet such is Thy resistless Power, That when our age is quite past o're, What Thou at first didst give, Thou canst our Life restore. VIII And thus with me, Lord, hast Thou dealt, Tho I for peace had only bitterness; Th' effects of mighty Goodness thus have felt, Beyond what words, or numbers can express: For from the Pit Thou drew'st me back, And that I might no pleasures lack, Upon Thy Self the burden of my Sins didst take. IX Triumphant Saviour! the still Grave, For so great Love, Thy Name can never praise; Nor in the Pit canst Thou Memorial have, Thy Truth, or hop'd for, or ador'd Thy Ways: The Living, Lord, the Living are The Men, who must Thy Power declare, And of them chiefly such, whom Thou like me, shalt spare. X They to their Children shall make known, As I do now, the Wonders of Thy Hand; How when we eve'n to Hell did head-long run, To stop our passage, Thou ith' way didst stand: Lord, since Thou 'hast thus deliver'd me, Thus made me Thy Salvation see, My Life, and Harp, and Song, I'll consecrate to Thee. ??? ???? ?????? ???????. III. ID. NOV. 1667. Three Psalms according to the old Version, and Meeter, ordinarily used in Churches, a little alter'd. Psal. I. Beatus Vir qui non abiit. The Man is blest, whose doubtful Paths Unrul'd by Sinners are; Who in their Council never stood, Nor sat ith' Scorners Chair. But in the Law of God the Lord Hath fixt his whole delight; And in that Law does exercise Himself both Day and Night. He shall be like a Tree, which grows Close by the Rivers side; Whose loaded Boughs in Fruits return Their Tribute to the Tide. No Storm or Drought shall make him fade, But he unmov'd shall stand; Nor shall Success less prosp'rous crown, What e're he takes in hand. Not so the Wicked, who as Chaff By Tempests rais'd on high, The triumph of fierce Winds are made, And as they drive them, flie. Unlike in Life, unlike shall be The ends which on them wait; Whilst these in Judgment cannot stand, And those are prais'd ith' Gate. For why the ways of Righteous Men Unto the Lord are known: But Sinners ways, hid to themselves, Unto the Dead lead down. Psal. LVII. Miserere mei, Deus miserere. Great God, on whom I have reli'd, Whose Mercy is my stay; Under Thy Wings, or let me hide, Or on them flie away! Or hide, or flie, until the Storm Which threatens me is past; Thou all things for me dost perform, In Thee my hope is plac'd. To God I'll cry, who shall descend From Heav'n, ith' Fight to close; And while his Love does me defend His Truth shall slay my Foes. With Lions, Lord, my Soul lies down, shut up within their Den; Lions so fierce were never known, Cruel, and bloody Men. Whose Tongues are Swords, and Eyes all Fire, With gore and slaughter Red; And who against me all conspire, To look, or speak me Dead. Yet set Thy Glory 'above the Skies, O're th' Earth exalted be; For tho so high I cannot rise, Thou mayst stoop down to me Thou didst so, for as I lookt round, Pensive and full of care; My prostrate Enemies strew'd the Ground, Each tane in his own Snare. Fixt is my Heart to sing Thy Praise, Tis fixt, and I'll rejoyce; Awake my Harp, and with Thee raise, To Heav'n my tuneful Voice! I will awake too, and my Song To th' Nations shall rehearse Mercies, whose Praise to Heav'n belong, Worthy an Angels Verse. Lord, set Thy Glory 'above the Skies, O're the Earth exalted be! Lo, how thy Son does thither rise, Lift from the Grave by Thee! Turn'd and Transcrib'd with the following Psalm, for an Hymn upon Easter-day, 1671. Psal. CXIV. In exitu Israel de, &amp;c. When Israel was by God's address, And his Almighty Hand, From Bondage led, and wondrously Brought to the Promis'd Land; In Judah God his Glory shew'd, And did his Power declare; Israel his great Inheritance, Temple and Empire were. The Sea it saw and suddenly Amaz'd rose up and fled; The parted streams of Jordans Flood Ran trembling to their Head. Aside the Mountains leapt like Rams, And to the Hills did show, (The Hills, which shook like frighted Lambs) The way which they should go. What ail'd the Sea that all amaz'd So suddenly it fled? And what made Jordans parted streams Run trembling to their Head? Why did the Mountains leap, like Rams, And to the Hills first show, (The Hills, which shook like frighted Lambs) The way which they should go? Confess, O Earth, thy Soveraign Lord, And at his Presence quake! Before the Face of Jacob's God Bow, and Obeysance make! 'Tis he, who caus'd those Rocks to hear, And when Thy Springs are dry, Can from their flinty Bowels fetch Streams, which shall never die. Psal. CLI. According to the LXXII. —?????? ??? ???????, ??? ??????????? ?[] ?????? ?????? ??[] ?? ???? ???????? ???, [] &amp;c. I Youngest of all my Brethren, and the least In Jesses House, to' a Service I enclin'd, Which both my Age, and Innocence suited best, And best the Throne, to which I was design'd: My Fathers Flock, was early set to keep, And how to govern Men, first learn among my Sheep. II I kept and fed them with a pious care, And as they fed, my Harp, and Pipe assayd; Them, and my self to please, did Songs prepare, And variously, as pensive Shepherd, playd: Till having wearied out an humbler String, A bolder flight I dare'd, Israels Great God to Sing. III But who such Praise can worthily rehearse? I strove my best, and it acceptance found, With Heav'ns Blest King, who to approve my Verse, A double Glory round my Temples bound; By' his Prophets Hand there plac'd the Regal Crown, (From the Flock calling me) the Poet's with his own. IV I many Brethren had, and great of Might, All valiant Men, and all renown'd in War, Oft tri'd, but God in them took no delight, For Causes, tho from us removed far, To' himself best known, who sees not as Man sees, But as the Heart is, judges, and gives Dignities. V For that, and his own Pleasure He chose me, And having chosen, call'd me forth to fight With Raphas Giant-son, whose blasphemy Levell'd at Heav'n, on his own Head did light: By' his Gods he curst me, and his Gods he curst, Himself as the chief God propitiating thus first. VI But such curse Proof, I out against him went, The firmlier arm'd, as he disarm'd thereby; And certain Death into his Fore-head sent, E're he the place could guard, or turn to flie: He fell: I ran, to th' lifeless Monster came, From him with's own Sword took his Head, from Israel shame. Job cursing his Birth. After this opened Job his Mouth and cursed his Day: And Job spake and said. Pereat dies in qua natus sum. May the Day perish, and its hasty flight Be still, or retarded by a sluggish Night! The Day, unhappy Day, whereon 'twas known, My Mother could that name, and sorrows own. Let it look black as Hell, no Ray appear, Nor on it God in common Light draw near! But unregarded may it from above, To 'all other Days a different Circle move! Augment the last Nights gloom, and ne're be found, But in a Sea of Rapes, and Murder drownd! Let Deaths grim Terrors on it ever dwell, Of if't has Light, let it be such as fell On Sodom, when avenging Heav'n did showr Tempests of Fire, and flouds of Lightning pour! And for the Night (if yet it were the Night, For any Day too bad, which first disclos'd the sight) Dark of it self, let Horrour on it seize! And when all others welcome are for th' ease, And respit, which they bring the toilsome care Of pains, which in their Curtains hidden are, Let it be Curst too, and by' a fatal Breath, Doom'd not the shadow of it, but very Death! Sad, dismal, solitary, know no Joys, No chearful shouts, but a dull confus'd noise Of Groans and Shrieks, as when the parting Soul Labours in vain its dest'iny to controul! And as the Criminal, who, to die next Morn, The pity of the many, and their Scorn, Curses its shortness, and does think it done, Sooner than other Nights are well begun; Let it abide Curst, and grown Ominous, Its Tale in some prodigious ruine lose! Black be its Twilight, in it rise no Star, But such, as when 'tis seen, tho from a far, Famine portends, and Blood, and the Worlds flame, And all the Plagues that have, or have not Name! Let it expect the Light, and pine away To Darkness palpable, but see no Day! With thousand Curses more— And Day or Night be' it, Ev'ning, or the Morn, From th' Years account let it be ever torn! To me, it self, and Heav'n and all be lost, And from the number of the Days be crost! O had it never been, or had that Hour But barr'd the Gate, and damn'd the fertil Door (Unhappy Gate, but Hour unhappy more!) Sorrow I ne're had known, nor had these Eyes Beheld the Light, which none but Fools can prize. Rather why di'd I not, making the Womb, At once my busie tyring House and Tomb; But by the Knees I must prevented be, And live more Deaths than one to act, more Plagues to see Draw th' hated Brests only to fetch supply, After ten thousand Deaths, new deaths to try, And at the last with greater sense and torment die! Had I then dy'd, still as the Night, or Grave, My Voice had been, without a Death to crave. Still had I lain, and in Oblivion's brest Enjoy'd a sweeter sleep and sounder rest. The Earth, which does in its cold Lap enfold All Arts and Arms, Princes and all their Gold, Which Sepulchers does for their Tombs prepare, Great in their Dust and in their Ruines fair, For me, to Die then had I been allow'd, Had markt a place, amidst the awful Crowd, There where untimely Births ith' Pit are thrown, And through the Earths soft pores the Plains with verdure crown. An awful place it is, with Company The best and great'st, where in appartments lie Kings, and their Counsellors, each in his Bed, With each his Sword clapt underneath his Head. For there the proud Usurpors terrors cease, And there the weary are at perfect ease, And the whole Region riots in the spoils of Peace. Pris'ners enjoy their Liberty, at least know No other Chains, than what their Jaylors do. Both small and great there undistinguisht be, Undisturb'd by outworn Authority. Masters and Servants throw those Names aside, And for a nobler freedom both provide. No fear of the Oppressor 's there, no wrong, No Clamours, no Reproach amidst that throng; But a deep silence fills the profound wast, Deaf to all calls, but the last Trumpets blast. Ah, might I rest there! Why is Death deni'd To him, who seeks it, in those shades to hide? Who for it digs, and would more gladly find That Treasure, than the mines he leaves ith' way behind! Light and this Life, which but encrease his pain, Light and this Life, of which he does complain, And would for 'one Death exchange, but all in vain. Why is Life thrust on such a Man, who's dead, Dead to himself, and God, all comfort fled? Me why is't thrust on, who the Gift despise, As th' worst of this Worlds great impert'nencies; Nay more, its greatest Curse; unwelcome Guest, That never, lets me never be at rest, Nor Bed, nor Board their just refreshment give; Ah! (who would thus?) thus I'd not always live; Too long already, to feel what I fear'd, Sadder than can be told, too doleful to be heard; At rest I ne're was, but compar'd with this, All former Grief as gone, and vanisht is, And all, but very Hell, would be a kind of Bliss. 1660. The Prayer of HABAKKUK. Domine, audivi auditionem. Hab. 3. I. My God, I have Thy Wonders heard, And their report like those, who saw them feard. I heard, what Thou of Old hast done, Revive Thy Work, nor let it die; But since to make us hope Thou hast begun, Let our Deliverance too draw nigh! Lord, in the midst of th' Years appear, Nor ever, ever thus forbear, To put an happy issue to our Fear! Ith' midst of th' Years Thy Greatness show, For we are ready if Thou 'art but so! Let us in Wrath Thy Mercy see, Remembred this, let that forgotten be! What tho with us the full Time 's not expir'd, With Thee 'tis ended, and by us desir'd. Ages to come, and Ages long since past, In Heav'n, where Thou art, present are, 'Tis ever now and now will ever last. O, Now from Heav'n Thy Power declare, And let it once be here, what it is ever there. II. Deus ab Austro veniet. God came from Teman, and the Holy One, Descended from Mount Paran, with a mighty Train: The Earth to Heav'n did dart the Rays again, And as He past the Skie with Glory shone. Refined Light, without allay, Such as above makes Angels Day, Such was His Brightness, and such was His Way. He was all Light, but from His Side Shot forth a Beam, so clear, and pure, That none to see it could endure; And there, as in the dark, He did His Glories hide. The Pestilence before Him went, Gathering new Poysons, as the old were spent; Ruine and Desolation, at His Feet, Never to part again did meet, But sworn to execute His Wrath on Man, Kist and embrac'd each other close, as they before Him ran. III. Stetit, &amp; mensus est Terram. He stood and in His Hand He held a Line, and measuring Wand, Both to mete out, and to destroy his Land. Over the Earth the fatal Line He threw, And that it level on all sides might lie, He smote the Nations, and they' in haste withdrew; Th' affrighted Earth, that fain would flie, Seeing it could not stir, the Line did take, But did with horrour, and amazement shake; The Rocks as it came o're their Backs, did quake; Bow'd down their Heads, and griev'd they were so high. The everlasting Mountains scatt'red lay, And the perpetual Hills sank down, and stole away. IV. Pro iniquitate vidi Tentoria. I saw the Tents of Egypt in distress, Methoughts I heard their doleful groans; The Land did tremble, and its emptiness An hollow murmur added to its moans, And shriekt a deadly eccho from the wounded Stones, When not content to see their First-born slain, Conquer'd on Land, they once again Would try the fortune of the Main. Since they the Tenth Shock could so stoutly brave, They scorn'd to fear the Eleventh Wave, Till they themselves, and that saw buried in a Grave. What ail'd the Rivers, Lord, what ail'd the Flood, That Thou shouldst make their streams true Veins of Blood? What could the Sea, against Thee do, So small against so great a Foe, Exalted Thou so high, and that so low? Could it deserve Thy Wrath, or roar so loud, From Heav'n, Thy Throne, to call Thee down; Or in its swellings was it grown so proud, It 'sdeign'd a check from a single frown, Unless in Triumph God would o're it ride, And Seas, from Seas below, as first from those above divide? V. Suscitans suscitabis Arcum. So on the Sea; ith' Air his Bow was seen; Not by Reflection, like the Rain-bow made, Where all the pleasing Colours are together laid, That Man might be no more afraid Of a new Deluge to be unsherd in, And once more drown, what it could never purge, his Sin. That is his Bow of Peace, but this of War, The Skie about it was with Darkness spread, Slaughter, and Gore had stain'd it red, Ghastly and terrible it glistned from afar. A poysoned Arrow on the string did hang, It hung a while, but when the Bow He drew, Drawn to the head away it flew, And flying gave a deadly twang; The Air a good while after rang. The sound how loud, the Pile how keen, How would it enter, when no Mail could come between? Such was his Word, which did their Way prepare, The Oath, which to the Tribes He past, Making them Conquerors every where, Till they were in Canaan plac'd, Till to the Promis'd Land, He brought them safe at last. VI. Semper fluvios scindes Terræ. But first the War did rage at Home, Thirst, a worse Foe than Amaleck, to be o'recome. To God for Drink they cry, Not with a Wet, but envious Eye; For Drought long since had made those Cisterns dry. They cry'd, and murmur'd, to' Egypt back would go, Till from the Rock God bid the Waters flow; The Rock obey'd, and to the sacred Rod did bow. Out gusht new Streams, th' admiring Earth gave way, But wondred how such Rivers should come there; Yet lookt again to see her fear, And as she saw it quak't, and ready cut in Channels lay. VII. Viderunt te &amp; doluerunt Montes. There as He marcht, the Mountains saw their God, And stagger'd as he shook His Rod; The surly Deep past silent by, And fearful any more to look on high, In humble plains of liquid Chrystal flat did lie. The bolder Waves, which yet would rise, And with their towring Billows dare the Skies, Seeing Him, started and shriekt out; No more of their Defiance thought, And of His Presence were asham'd to doubt. As when one sees some Ruine near, Ready upon his Head to fall, Which yet he cannot help at all, Cannot prevent; but with unequal strength must bear; Expecting the dead weight he stands, Shrinks in his Shoulders, and lifts up his Hands: So stood the Waves, and without power to flie, With rais'd up Hands and Eyes, had hardly strength to cry. VIII. Sol &amp; Luna steterunt. The Sun amaz'd stood still, and at the sight, Bid the Moon stop, and see the bloody Fight; Never was such a Fight, never so long a Day, When Heav'n it self did waiting stay, Nor till it saw the Victors went away. The Lord Himself that Day marcht out, Hail-stones and Coals of Fire hurl'd all about; In wrath He marcht, through the whole Land, And thresht the Nations, as He past along, His Arm so weighty, and his Wrath so strong, None durst against Him stand. To save his People did He thus appear, To them so Glorious, to His Foes so full of Fear. IX. Percussisti Caput de domo, &amp;c. To th' Earth He stroke their Princes down, Their Villages destroy'd, sack'd every Town; Tho like a Whirlwind, they against us came, God for us fought in arms of Flame. Flames, which their blasts made fiercer burn, And on themselves with double Vengeance turn; In Fire God came against them, and o'recame: Did through the Sea on His great Horses ride, Whilst Waves to make Him room, stood up in heaps, on either side. X. Audivi &amp; conturbatus est, &amp;c. This as I heard my Joynts unloos'd, Through all my Veins chill Horrour was diffus'd. My Belly trembled, and my Lips did quake, My Bones for very rottenness did shake. Afraid I was, yet could not chuse but fear, When I such mighty things did hear, When e're I was aware, The God, who did them I perceiv'd drew near. O may I rest, when he to judg shall rise! For when He does the wicked World chastise, How heavy then will be His Hand, how red his Eyes! XI. Ascendam ad Populum. From Thee, Lord, then, to my God now I flie, And for Thy Mercy, on Thy Power relie, Propitious Thee thy Land has found, and so shall I. Nothing shall make me quit my trust, For Thou art Pitiful, as well as Just No, tho the Fig-Tree blossom not, And on the Vine the generous clusters rot; Tho th' labours of the Olive cease, And all the lesser Plants of Life, With Man, as He is with his God at strife, Deny to give their rich encrease. Let th' Earth threat Famine, bear no Grass, Iron below, as Heav'n above, is Brass. No Fruit, no Pasture yield, But be with Thorns and Brambles fill'd, And they burnt up, whilst there's a Furnace in each Field; Let the Flocks die, and in the Stall The Ox, not by the Knife, but want of Fodder fall; Yet in my God will I rejoyce, Whose care I am, as I made him my choice. 'Tis He's my strength, and freed from fear, For me on high He shall His Truth display; Or when the Desolation's near, Give me Hinds Feet to scape away. 1663. Comiato Song wherewith I first Begun, My Great Redeemers Praise to sing; And from a far more noble string, (Than I was wont) an Hebrew Descant run, For the great Harp of Jesses Son, To be prepar'd, when Time should be: Preserve that Times blest Memory, And all that, by Thee' inspir'd, I since have done, That if with Men no Grace I find, With Heav'n I may, and Peace in my own Mind!

I Lead me, O Providence Divine, Where e're Thou hast appointed me to go; I'll follow willingly, and show, By my quick pace, that one design, Tho hid to me, acts Thy unerring Will and mine. II Briskly I'll follow Thee; for so I shall prevent my Fate, which to decline Beyond my Compass is, and Line; Worse by resistance I shall grow, And after all be driven, whether I will or no. Upon a terrible Storm of Thunder, Wind, and Rain, 25 July 1670, done by Night in the midst of it. I. Great God of Thunder, at whose Voice The Earth and its Foundations shake, And Man, whom Thou hast made its Lord, does quake, Still the dreadful, and amazing Noise! Lo! as Thy People Israel did of old, By Fear surpriz'd, yet by our fear made bold, Lord, lest we die, we beg Thou wouldst Thy Voice withhold! II. Yet speak, for (Lo!) Thy Servants hear! And speak Thy self, but not in Smoak, and Flame! The mighty Storm, that by the Tishbite came, And rent the Hills, and did the Mountains tear, The Tishbite saw unmov'd, knowing Thou wert not there. At length was heard an awful sound, Whispers and murmers undistinct around, With silence waited on profound, And a soft Voice, in which the Thunders shouts were drownd. The Prophet listned, and inclin'd his Head, Fill'd with sacred and unusual Dread; His Face did in his Mantle hide; For Thou in triumph on the peaceful sound didst ride, And He, who brav'd the Thunder, bow'd and worshipped III. With such another Voice Divine, Lord, speak to us, and we will hear! Thy Thunder is too loud for our purg'd Ear, And dreadfully Thy scorching Lightnings shine. That voice of Fire, till the Great Day restrain, Where to be slept out 't shall be strove in vain; For, even the Dead by it awak'd, shall rise again. The Nativity. An Ode. I. Who would not envy, if he durst, your Grace, Blest Shepherds, to whom first the Tidings came, That God, whom neither Time can bound, nor Space, Th' Almighty, who upholds this rolling Frame, Deign'd to be born, and did the Breast imbrace: Of the Worlds Maker made himself a Child, And wrapt in swaths, tho He whole Nature fill'd? Too happy News this, in the City to be told, I'th' Palace, and at Herods Court, Where all the learned Father Jews resort; E're it reach them, let the report grow cold! There's too much Spleen, and Malice there, Hypocrisie, Distrust, and servile Fear, Intemp'rance, Lust, Extortion, Cruelty, And, if than these there greater Vices be, Pride, which of ills the worst, pollutes the Air. The Country 'a better place, God for his Birth did chuse, (Tho not so gay,) and Men more Innocent, To whom Hee'd show His great Descent: And when He did Jerusalem refuse, 'Twas to recal the Ancient Time, and Use, When He to Man in Paradise first went: That He to Peace, and Justice, might the preference give, And all the Graces that ith' Country safely live: And lest the Truth should be deny'd, Ith' Country Hee'd be Born, but in the City Dy'd. II. “Fear not, O Shepherds, th' Angel said! And need there was, to bid them not to fear, Since greater Souls than theirs might be afraid, That God, unlookt for, should approach so near, And full Spring-tides of Light, at Midnights Ebb appear. For Night it was, and posting tow'rds the Day, Grown darker on a sudden, than before, The Shepherds by their Flocks expecting lay, Till their bright Star should ope' the Mornings Door; When, Lo! a brighter Star brake out, And sacred Beams Angelic Forms did show, Fairer than thousand Suns, tho all about They their united Flames should throw. 'Twas Gabriel, who the Message brought To the 'ever Virgin that she should conceive; Gabriel, who now the happy Minute taught, When his Great Lord the Father's Throne did leave, A Body fitted for him to receive; Bright in His Princes glory, bright in 'His own, All clad in Hallow'd Light came down, Embassador of God, and Herald to His Son. III. On Heavens high Top awhile He stood, And view'd all Palestine around; All Palestine in sleep lay drown'd, Eve'n Jordan slumbred to the murmurs of his Flood. Nor voice of Man, nor noise of Dogs was heard, The bowing Mountains seem'd to nod, And at the Presence of their God, Who o're them wav'd his All-commanding Rod, Inclin'd their Heads, and the great Spell rever'd. Each Field, each Hill did rest, And equal Night possest The painful Labourer, and his weary Beast. Bethle'hem alone, this Transient Death surviv'd, And in her Plains some liv'd, Yet whom the Sight did so surprize, They hardly durst believe their Eyes, Yet durst not but believe, and sent to Heav'n their cries. IV. So at the last Day shall there some be found To hear, alive, the Trumpets dreadful sound; Amaz'd and trembling shall they stand, Feel on themselves a Powerful Hand, And willing, or unwilling take, the great Command. “Be chang'd ('twill say) ye Living! and ye Dead “Wake and arise, and to the Judgment come! The Living, soon as e're the word is sed, Shall feel the Terrors they did dread, And without help of Death, or Grave, reach their Eternal Home. The Dead with their own Bodies shall arise, And then the Earth, and Sea, and Skies, The scatter'd Atomes shall restore Of Bodies, which they did devour, To joyn with parted Souls, but never to be parted more. No guilty Criminal his Face shall hide, Or undiscovered the great Judg avoid, But from his Hold, tho self-condemn'd, come and be tri'd. V. Nature it self shall to 'its old nothing roll; And then Heav'ns beauteous Scroll, With all the Mistic Notes that there (Writ by the Hand Divine) So wondrous, and so bright appear, Shall in one flame with Earth and Sea, more dreadful shine. Like that, which once the Prophet sent To Judahs stubborn King; Jer. 36. A while he heard the Woes, but grown impatient, With Hands prophane the Parchment rent, And into th' Fire the sever'd parts did fling; And there they crackled, there did together shrink, Till all-consum'd they were to Ashes burn'd. Ah! sottish Prince, and vain to think Decrees of Heav'n so easily overturn'd! Lo! God himself resents the wrong, Thy self shall be the subject of a longer Roll ere long! VI. And so he was, for by the dread Command, A larger Roll the Prophet did prepare. By th' same Command another Heav'n more fair, In place of this, when 'tis consum'd shall stand. And there the Thrones shall be for Judgment set, From which the Son with awful Majesty, And doubled Grace shall Reign illustriously, In his own Godhead, and th' Exalted Manhood, great. All Nations then, and Languages, The Rich, the Poor, the Simple, and the Wise, With all who Tents inhabited, or Palaces, Naked to the Bar shall rise, And answer each Man to his name: Distinctions shall aside be thrown, Nor Kings be by their Scepters known, Or the great Houses which they made, or whence they came. Around the Bar shall Angels wait, For Execution arm'd, and cloth'd for state, Sole ministers of Wrath, who only were of Love alate. VII. Thither, O Muse, thither bring back my Song, From which thou wandred hast too long; Of Gabriel, and his second Message sing, Who now upon the Wing, The happiest News, e're heard by mortal ears, does bring. “Attend, he said, and those glad Tidings hear, “Good Tidings, and of great Joy, which shall be “Not unto you alone, “Or from the Father to the Son, “For one descent alone continued down, “But unto all who are to come, or wisht this day to see. “For Lo! to you is Born this Day, “A Saviour, which is Christ the Lord, “In David's Town, which long expecting lay, “Promis'd Messiah, and th' Incarnate Word. “To Day He's Born, and this shall be the Sign, “By which the Mighty Infant shall be found, “In Swadling Clothes he shall lie bound, “And in a Manger rests the Babe Divine. Never was Sight of equal Fame, Not the first Man of God-like Frame, For God himself thus Born, a Mortal Man became. VIII. He spake, and with him strait were seen Myriads of Angels, in their best Array, Myriads of Angels, who kept Holy-day, And all their Glories did display, No Cloud to 'eclipse the Lustre came between. And then they Danc'd, and then they Sang Praises, themselves did first compose; The Starry Vault, with the loud Eccho rang, And the whole Concert doubled o're this close; “Glory to God on High, “Ith' highest great Jehovah bless, “Good Will t'wards Men, on Earth be Peace, “Glory to God on High! And may this Round begun thus last Eternally! And up they rose, with Bays and Ivy Crown'd, Not such as Mortal Poets wear below, But what ith' Heav'nly Tempe grow, And with whose Wreaths the first great Makers Brows are bound. IX. Go! Shepherds, go! and kiss th' Eternal Son! To Bethle'hem go, and the first Tributes bring To Israels Saviour, and Heav'ns New-born King! To you this more than common Honour's done, To' approach your God, and Worship at his humble Throne. Make haste, nor by your own delay For others to prevent your Joys give way; Why should they first be happy, whilst you only stay? For Kings shall come e're long, from th' East, By a less Flame than what's your Guide, Directed hither, to find that Rest, Which seems not theirs, till by 'you accepted, or deny'd. Of you God takes the first, and greatest Care, Who thus by Angels Summon'd are; When they, tho Kings, and coming from afar, Shall wait, and both to call, and lead them, only have a Star. 14 Jan. 1667–8. The STAR. A Carol For the Epiphany by the III Kings. 1. King. See how that Glorious Star, at Noon does rise, And like another Sun new Guilds the Skies! 2. King. Look how it dares the Ruler of the Light, And in His clearest Beams appears more bright, Calling before its time the sluggish Night! 3. King. Rather the Conquer'd Sun to' its Rays gives way, And but a Phospher seems to its new Day. The Conquer'd Sun, &amp;c. [Chorus trium.] 2. King. Sure 'tis no common Star, see where it goes A daring Passage it self only knows; 1. King. And cross the Heav'n points out to Palestine, And as it that way leads more bright does shine: Come let us follow, where it leads, and see 3. King. What may the Cause of its appearing be, Whether it set a Star, or some Divinity. Come let us, &amp;c. [Chorus alter trium.] 3. King. Some greater Power, which to direct our Way, Has chose this borrowed Shape, and glorious Ray; And when we knew not well which Road to go, 1. King. Does tow'rds Judea our great Journey show: 2. King. That way it points, that way we must along, No fear, when Heaven's out Guide, we should go wrong. That way, &amp;c. [Chorus trium tertius.] 1. King. O're Bethle'm lo! at length the Flame does rest! Bethle'm, that with the Prince of Peace is blest: 2. King. Bethle'm, which must by ancient Prophecy The Tyring-House of the Almighty be, Where he will cloath Himself with base Humanity. 3. King. And that's the House, where we our Gifts must bring To the World's God, and Israel's Infant King. Chorus Omnium. Hither 'twas, hither the bright Star did lead, Let's enter humbly, and approach with Fear: The Star, which brought, will shew him us more clear, And be a Glory round the Infants Head: O this is He! fall down, and worship him! fall down And kiss his Feet, whose Head ev'n Heav'n thus stoops to Crown! 23. Decemb. 1660. The PASSION. An Ode. I. Twice sixteen Years have almost o're Thee past, Twice sixteen more Thou mayst as fondly waste, In expectation, Sylvius, as thou hast The swift-wing'd Years, which in their Passage scap'd thee last. The Kalendar is searcht, and all in vain Wouldst Thou have this Day return To the same Point, as when in 'it Thou wert Born, 15. Apr. 1636.But 'twill not be this Age, if it e're come again. Enough 'tis that Thou once didst see The great Conjunction: Wait not o're long, for what may be Too late for Thee, And is sufficient of it self alone, Without that Circumstance to fill Thy Song. For grant it now what could to Thee be' apply'd But that thy Birth fell out the Night thy Saviour Di'd. II. Rise then my Muse, but from a nobler Ground, And sing in Numbers mournful as the Day, Of Natures fright, and disarray, Which did Philosophy confound, And scattered dismal Horrours all around. When Heaven, and Earth, and Hell partook In the Darkness, and the Night, Which like a Sea o'reflow'd the plains of Light, And all Spectators with amazement strook! Unlike to that, which once in Egypt raign'd, When solid Night did Rhamases invest, But Goshen, of the Sun possest, Over the Gleam a Prospect gain'd, And uninvellopt saw how far the Heav'ns were stain'd. Nor was it to the Antipodes The Day had hastned his access; For they unsensible of Light, Lay buried all the while in Night, And without Miracle could not behold it bright. Unless Thou add'st the Prodigie to raise, (And which none else but Thou, O Muse, dares say) Th' Antipodes at Midnight rose to gaze, And Night Jerusalem less admir'd, than they the Day. III. A thought too wild this, and extravagant, And which does all but its own airy basis want: Say rather that the Pangs and Agonies Of a new, and better World, Which was thence to take its rise, Were thus conceal'd from Mortal Eyes, And Darkness, as at first, o're all th' Expansion hurld. God's sacred Kingdom was that Birth, The same New Heaven, and new Earth, Which the belov'd Disciple saw, In all its Beauties, as it did appear, And to provoke Adventurers there, A Chart thereof by Vision did exactly draw. For on the Cross as our great Saviour hung, And just Expiring, bow'd his Conquering Head, From the black Skies bright beams like Lightning sprung But as the Day, continued long, Chasing wing'd Darkness, which before them fled. And as the first Creations Work begun By the commanding Word, which He To Nothing, and to Chaos sed, Making when He spake only, “Let there be, By a no less Word this too was done, Created by that Voice, which cry'd, “Tis Finished. IV. 'Tis Finished the Mighty Victor cry'd, All reaking in Triumphal Gore, Which his own Wounds, not Enemies Necks supply'd; For tho with them He Skirmisht had before, And oft rebated had their Power, He could not throughly for us Conquer, till He Di'd. Alone He did the Wine-press tread, Of his Just Father's Wrath, alone, Israels to raise, stoopt his own Head, And to assist Him was there none. So far from that, that ith' pursuit Of Satan, Sin, and Death, when He cry'd out, With fainting Groans, I Thirst, His Patience some, and some his Conquest Curst, And Gall and Vinacre of the bitter Tree, was all the Fruit. Till having tasted of the Brook ith' way, Anew He follow'd, till He gain'd the Day; And to compleat his Victory, Got thence more Aids, and strength enough to Die. V. Blest Saviour, who but Thou couldst Live so long, And in one Soul so many Deaths endure, And different all, and all their Pains so strong, That their rehearsal does fresh Griefs ensure, And again pierce those Hearts Thou bledst to Cure? When in the Garden Thou didst first begin, Gethsemane, for ease design'd, And safe retirements of a troubled Mind, Purging thence all th' effects of Sin, Which still, tho hid, remaind behind, The dregs of what on Man in Paradise brake in. Fatal, but happy Place that, where did grow Midst whole Woods, no less beauteous, but one Tree, That even, by Wilfulness alone, could be The occasion of our Misery; But in all else, more secret Snares than we Till by them Caught, shall ever know! From this to clear it, and restore To th' Garden, what it had before, And perfect Innocence add, one Beauty more; As there fall'n Man his Life first forfeited, There, to Redeem him, first the Blood of God was shed. VI. How grievous were his Pains there, and how great? Burning, tho in the frosty shades of Night: Shivering with Cold, but in a Bloody Sweat; And all dissolv'd, at his approaching Passions Sight? Thrice did He his Disciples leave, And thrice to his Great Father pray'd, Thrice to himself He answer made, And by an Angel did support receive; But, (O!) th' Assaults that were within, Compar'd with which his Bodies Flame, Was temperate heat, and scarce deserv'd the Name, When in his Soul the Burning did begin, And Hell to 'encrease the Fire, did Mines of Brimstone bring! A thousand Fiends about him flew, And Coals, and bailful Firebrand; threw, That seiz'd at length the noblest Part, Beyond the weak defence of Nature, or of Art, And unconsum'd, did only leave the Heart. VII. The Heart did unconsum'd remain, By the Arch-Fiend With its own Grief to burst design'd, When in the Judgment Hall again, He should the Charge renew, but all in vain. Thither betray'd by 'a Kiss the Traytors bring, With Fetters bound, Heav'ns Sacred King; Where being Cited, and Blasphem'd, Flouted, Scourg'd, Spat upon, Derided, and Contemn'd, By them Revil'd, deny'd by 'His own, A Reed in 'his Hand, his Head with Thorns they Crown, And lead to Golgotha their God, whom they 'had Condemn'd: VIII. Follow, Muse, if thou hast the heart, and see What other Torments they prepare; I know the utmost of their Cruelty, And from thy Mouth had rather hear, The sad Report, than a Spectator be. Yet, that thou mayst not stand thy self surpriz'd, Stript off his Clothes, in Nakedness disguiz'd, To th' Cross they'll nail his Hands, 'tis said, And bore with Nails his tender Feet; Then, all his Sufferings to upbraid, “Cry, If Thou art the Son of God, let's see't, “Now from the Tree triumphantly come down, “Or reign thence, like Thy self alone, “Or any other Wonder show, “Whereby Thy De'ity may be known, “And to its Scepter we will bow. As if there greater Miracle could be, Than all that Patience, which they do, but will not see. IX. Nor is this all, but when He's Dead, His Side they'll open with a Spear; Approach the Wound, and look what Blood is shed, For it Mysterious will appear, And be another Argument for thee next Year! A better Spring will thence arise, Than Helicon, so Fam'd of old, There bath thy self, if thou art wise, Nor fear in those chast Streams to be too bold. But see, be sure too long thou dost not stay, For all the while Thou art away, Tears only from these Eyes will flow, And in my Fancy I shall double o're All that I have told thee now before, And all that thou return'd will'st tell again, and more, Beside my Verse will fetter'd be, and slow, And want both Wings to flie, and Feet to go. 10. Martii 1667–8. EPIGRAM Out of Latine. When my God Di'd, I first began to Live, And Life which he refus'd Heav'n me did give Unlike that Day, O how unlike we were! Him dead the Cross, me 'alive the Knees did bear. But may not I die too? This life of mine I can as well as Thou dispise, if not like Thine. Ah dearest Lord, this Legacy bestow, A double Life, then to Thy Death I'll owe: And sanctifi'd thus in my Birth by Thee, A living Death, my dying Life shall be. 5. Decemb. 1668. An Extasie of Divine Love. Aquesta Divina Union, &amp;c. Out of Spanish. S. Teresa. I That sacred Bond of Charity, Wherein I uncorrupted Live, Makes God the Captive Chain receive, But my pinion'd Heart sets free, Tho causing still such love in me, To see Heav'ns King my Pris'ner lie, That I die, 'cause I cannot die. II How teadious now this Life is grown, The way to Death how hard and long; How dark the Dunge'on th' Ir'ns how strong, With which my' unwilling Soul's kept down, And has no trust but hope alone! These thoughts my Troubles raise so high, That I die, 'cause I cannot die. III Bitter Life, shalt thou be to me, Where I my God can ne're enjoy; But if my Love has no alloy, My hope as try'd and pure may be; Ah! come my Lord, and set me free! Take off this weight, which makes me cry, That I die, 'cause I cannot die. IV By hope alone it is I Live, Hope that I bear the seeds of Death, And dying once, a second Birth Secures that Hope, and Life do's give; O Death, I'll ne're thy coming grieve, When Life succeeds, through hope so nigh, That I die, 'cause I cannot die. V Who can the Charms of Love refuse? Ah Life, no more my Heart betray, 'Tis only thou stand'st in my way, Which rather than my Love, I'll loose, And Death for my great Champion choose; So much alate thy Enemy, That I die, 'cause I cannot die. VI The Life alone, that's hid above, Can of true Life the Title claim; That Toy, which here usurps the Name, Its pleasure hides, and deads our Love, And a worse Foe than Death does prove; Death, for whose sake I Life so flie, That I die, 'cause I cannot die. VII What can I give, frail Life, but thee To th' God, who in me deigns to live? Yet how can I the nothing give Till he first grants me Liberty? O let me die his Face to see! But that's so distant from my Eye, That I die, 'cause I cannot die. VIII Beside, my God, from thee away, Who would not of a Life complain, That terrible, and full of pain, Suffers a thousand Deaths each Day, A Mortal, but a slow decay? And this so swells my Misery, That I die, 'cause I cannot die. IX All Creatures love their Element, And pleasure there enjoy and rest; And if by Death they are disseas'd To their first nothing they are sent: But I'm beyond kind Death's extent, And yet so many hardships try, That I die, 'cause I cannot die. X When in the Eucharist my dull Soul, Eating thy Flesh it self would ease, A thousand thoughts for entrance press, And there not to enjoy Thee whole, Whole, and alone, I a 'new condole; For 'tis the Voice of every Sigh, That I die, cause I cannot die. XI I please my self ith' Hopes, 'tis true, E're long, my God, of seeing Thee; But fearing lest they false should be, My Torments with my Fears renew, And both so close my Soul pursue, Hoping mid both so heartily, That I die, 'cause I cannot die. XII Lord, from this Death deliver me, And Life thus beg'd at length bestow! Why should I still be kept below? Look how I die for love of Thee! And since enjoy'd Thou canst not be In this Lifes death, regard my cry, That I die, 'cause I cannot die. XII My dying Life I'll then lament, And living Death in Tears bewail; For my Sins sake those Foes prevail, And all my Age in Mourning's spent: To my release at length consent, Nor let me grieve eternally, That I die, 'cause I cannot die. L'Envoy. Blest Soul! that hither couldst arrive, How do I love yet envy Thee, Wishing my self this Extasie, And that th' Example Thou dost give, Would make me less afraid to live; And to each close of Thine reply! That I die, cause I cannot die! 20. May, 1668. The Flight. I No wonder, Soul, thou so admir'st a Verse, And countst thy self in its Possession brave; For 'tis, what e're thou canst desire to have, On this side Heav'n, but more to make, than to rehearse. II 'Tis th' end of Preaching, Loves best Exercise, The Quintessence of Prayer, Praises refin'd; A Change exstatic into th' Heav'nly Mind, And on whose soaring Wings above the World I rise. III O, could I always stay where 't first sets me! How naked looking down would th' World appear! Its Joys how empty, and how vain its Fear; Another flight would make me leave Mortality. IV For as the sealed Dove so high does towre; That i'th' pure Air at last it flying dies; So should I mount too, and above the Skies, Rapt to th' Etern aboads unfeel my dying Hour. V But I must live still, and my flight to bound, Till truly seal'd, there something, Lord, will be; Some Work of Thine be' it, be it but a Tree, Eve'n there I nearer Heav'n shall rest, than on the Ground. 22. Jan. 1671–2. noctu. Exsurrexi &amp; adhuc sum tecum An Hymn and Prayer, To the Holy JESUS my Lord. Parode. The hint and manner of stanza taken from the last Canzone of Fr. Petrarc. lib. 11. Virgine bella. I Jesu, th' Eternal Sun of Righteousness, Unlike our Mortal Suns, which Rise, and Set, Subliming this, and t'other World with Light, Love bids me of Thy wondrous Power to Treat, But how Thy Power, or Wonders to express, I know not, till Thou make my Darkness bright, And with Thy Beams dispel the shades of Night: Therefore I beg Thy aid, JESU, to whom I' have pray'd, And still pray, that I worthy Thee may write; Illustriously o're all th' Expansion shine, And if I 'm weak to endure A Light so pure, dart through my Verse a ray Divine. II JESU, the Wisdom of the Deity, In whom the Mistic Treasures are conceal'd, Be'yond Reasons search, of the Eternal Mind, And with whose Stripes the Afflicted World is heal'd; Proof against Death, the Vanguishts Victory, Under whose Standart to its God rejoyn'd, Love for the Noblest Service is design'd, Love that's a Rebel now, JESU, so Great that Thou From Heav'n Thy self must come his Slaves to 'unbind: That I some Trophies of Thy Power may boast, When Thou dost Conquering ride, I'll Crowns provide, and sing Thy Triumphs through his Coast. III JESU, the Virgins, and the Martyr's Wreath, Who without Spot, or Wrinkle didst adorn The fairest Soul, which in a Body all, Of Charms was wondrously Conceiv'd, and Born; Fought'st, and wast fought, resign'dst thy labouring Breath, The Lost to Save, and from the Dungeon call Hopes weary Pris'ners, and Death's Captive thrall, To Thrones, at Thy Right Hand, JESU, as Thou dost stand At Thy Great Father's, in Heav'ns Judgment Hall; Grant me the Grace, and Thou the Grace canst grant, That when Thou shalt come next, Tho now perplext, to attend, Thee then I nothing want. IV JESU, in whom the Godhead does repose, Infinites Comprehension, and the Bound Of boundless Majesty, fathomless Deep, With Thorns first pierc'd, and e're with Glory Crown'd, Submitted to the Triumphs of Thy Foes, A Man of Sorrows, and inur'd to weep; Substantial God, and Man, who both dost keep Unmixt, and Unconfus'd, JESU, th' Untoucht, and Bruis'd, Quickning the Dead, yet who ith' Grave didst sleep; 'Tis Thou hast broke our Bands, th' Uusurper hurld Headlong into the Pit, In whose sides sit the great Disturbers of the World. V JESU, the Way, the Truth, whose Life does give The' exactest Method how we may direct Our wandring Course to Thy Divine Aboad, And whence, seduc'd to stray, is not to Live; A Way Thy self, while here Unerring trode, And now Exalted dost with Blessings load; A Way, which rough at first, JESU, appears and Curst, But entred once proves worthy Thee and God; Shew me Thy Way, nor take it in ill part, Since I am blind and weak, If I bespeak Thee' in that, whose Guide and End Thou art. VI JESU, Whose Cross the surest Anchor makes, Both strong and sure, entring within the Vail, Where Passions waves, how fierce and uncontroul'd So e're, rage not, (and yet they dare assail The holiest Place, and Heav'n ith' Tempest shakes) Thou seest how there I have fixt all my hold, And am ith' midst of Storms and Floods grown bold: Yet still there is a Shelf, JESU, I mean my Self, 'Gainst which I am in danger to be roll'd. I sink, O now thy saving Hand forth stretch! Now e're my Head with th' Weeds, Which this Sea breeds, is wrapt, and I'm below Thy reach! VII JESU, how many Tears have I in vain, How many Sighs, and Prayers in vain pour'd out, Tho by th' expence my Flame alone's encreast! My Life from its first Stage, trac'd all about, Unchang'd by change of Habit, 's nought but Pain, Anguish and Torment, void of Peace and Rest; Nay even my Soul Heav'n-born, has been opprest, And humbled to the Grave: JESU, make hast to save, Nor tarry, tho of Men I 'have lov'd Thee least! Now help, to Morrow may not be so well, For Misery and Sin Have me 'on the Wing, and where they 'll pitch me who can tell? VIII JESU, one half of me's already gone, So gone, that tho I have piec'd up the Rent, Methinks I'm not the perfect thing I was, Tho happy still in that I am content, And who shall be more perfect when th' World's done, And One made Three into' One again shall pass: Unhappy Man, unhappy were my case, Such doubts gave'st Thou not skill, JESU, to Reconcile, Thou who see'st Past and Future in one Glass! Dear Lord, for whom too hard there nothing is, Give all my Griefs such end, As may intend Thy Honour first, and then my Bliss. IX JESU, my Confidence, my Hope, my Fear, Able to help in time of Need, and Free, O leave me not, when my last Hour shall come, Not for my sake, but His, who Ransom'd me! Merit crys, No. But th' Image which I bear Pleads hard, and would for Ancient Love make room; Tho I have been betray'd by Errors doom, To a Fairy Wood, and Brook, JESU, my Shepherd, look, Find Thy lost Sheep, and bring the Stragler home! Of Streams so troubled, may I drink no more, Or having found my Way, Any more stray, or wander as I did before! X JESU, My God, who far off seest the Proud, And hatest him, let Thy Blood some pity move, An Heart all bruis'd, and contrite to regard, That does at length bewail its sottish love; And which, if once it can get free, has vowd, 'Twill that and all things else for Thee discard, Twill more than ever eye th' ador'd Reward, And purg'd with sacred Flame, JESU, to Thy great Name, No cost of Wit, or Verse being basely spar'd, Its Life, and Hymns, and Service dedicate, To Thee own its chang'd desires, Kiss the soft Fires, and blame it self that 'twas so late. XI JESU, to whom that Name, as the Prize is given, Of all Thou didst and sufferedst without measure, The mighty Dowry, which Thou broughtst Thy Wife, Deaths plague, Hells spoil, but whose exstatic Pleasure Is for the Marriage Feast reserv'd, in Heav'n, Whither I haste, to be than hope more rife, And plentiful; (Lo!) the short Day of Life Posts swiftly on, and flies; JESU, in my Agonies, Tho now with Death and Hell I am at strife, Let me experience this Names healthful ease, And after a long War, With Truces rare, in 'it Conquer, and depart in Peace. Comiato. Thus, tho with different heat of Spirit, and Verse, What Petrarch sang to another, JESU, Thy Virgin Mother, The stops in part chang'd, I to Thee rehearse: I chang'd the stops, (for under Thy Broad Seal, Thou givest us no Commission, Her to Petition) and from her to Thee appeal. Altro Comiato. And now be pleas'd to accept this humble Praise, Other, and better Fruit, JESU, of all my Suit, I dare not beg; eve'n Pardon here is Bays. And for the Prayers, dropt more from my Heart than Pen, Since their least part's the Rime, And words, which chime, say, as I to them say, AMEN. I'l Terzo. When I sent it to Sir Kingsmil Lucy. At London, Song, Thy Russet, and Thy Freeze, Will seem, I fear, but course; Jesu, they'll cry, or worse, See! the dull fleghm of Solitude and Trees. Thus will the Fops treat Thee, those Wits by Rote; Yet one Thou 'lt know, e're long, Who will own Thee, Song, and see Thy Beauties through Thy Coat. An HYMN for Vespers. Out of Greek. ??? ?????? ????? ????? Jesu CHRIST, blest Light of Light, Th' Immortal Fathers chearful shine, Ray of Glory, all Divine, Equally with Him fair, and bright; When we see the Day decline, Calling the sluggish Evening on, We praise the Father and the Son, And in our Lauds the Spirit joyn, “Worthy art Thou, O God, we say, “Worthy, O Son of God, art Thou, “And Thou, of Life the Lord and Giver, “Worthy to be Prais'd for ever, “Great THREE and ONE to Thee we bow, “And with th' whole World thus Crown each Day! LENT. Sestina al' Italiana Convertimento a Dio. I Welcome, great Queen of Fasts, thrice welcome Lent, With solemn Penance, and Devotion crownd, Sweet Abstinence, clean thoughts, and chaste desires, The Wings, whereby th' unpinion'd Soul does rise Above this lower Circle, and exchange Substantial Cares, for Joys unmixt and pure. II I well remember, when with thoughts less pure, Nor more to Piety a Friend, than Lent, Pleas'd I could well have been ne're to exchange My course of Living, no, tho to be Crown'd With Bays Immortal, and Exalted rise, In hopes as large, as are my chang'd desires. III But that time's gone, and with it those desires, Which held me down, and in their stead a pure Ethereal Flame, which upward still does rise; Kind thoughts of what's esteem'd severe in Lent, My Soul (the Victim) has for the Alter Crownd And ee'n burnt up, nor would I 'again exchange. IV This was Thy Work, Lord, Thou 'twas didst exchange What was beyond my power to curb, stubborn desires, Making them subject to the Head Thou 'hadst Crownd; And now I'm Victor, with Robes clean, and pure, (Pure to what once I wore) and this new Lent, To 'attend the Triumph, rich in Spoils does rise. V And as that rises, such hope I to rise, When on the Fasts great close I shall exchange For Easters Sun, the dewy Pearls of Lent; Bathing, like Oar, with frequent Tears, desires, Which only such a Flame can render pure, Fin'd from all Dross, and worthy to be Crown'd. VI Hast Thee, blest Day, wherein with Glory crownd, The Worlds great Saviour from the Grave did rise; And credence gives His Spouse, that like Him pure, She shall rise too, and all her Spots exchange, For Glories, larger than her vast desires, And the' Pious Resveries of an holy Lent. Were Lent, and Primitive Institutes thus Crown'd With purgd Desires, and Lives, their Fame would rise, And none the Church exchange, to be more Pure. Sent to my Excellent Patron, Sir Nicholas Stuart, Baronet, 1672–3. The Song of the ANGELS, At the Fall of Lucifer. I Son of the Morning, First-born of the Light, The once bright Phospher of the Day Divine, How art Thou hurld into eternal Night, And hid in Flames, who didst with Glory shine! The bold Usurper of th' Almighty's Crown, Proud Lucifer, to Hell is thrown, And sing'd the Heav'ns, as he from thence fell headlong down. II “Above the Heav'ns, he said, I will ascend “And there above the Stars exalt my Throne, “My Conquests in the North I will extend, “And God a parted Rule shall have, or none: “Above the heights ne're reacht before I'll flie, “And equal made with the Most High, “Or gain an honourable Fall, or Victory. III Scarce said, a pointed Thunderbolt was sent From th' Hand Divine, which pierc'd him to the heart. In vain he sought the Vengeance to prevent, And to Almighty Strength oppos'd his Art. But down he sank, and down the Monster fell, The stroke, nor bore, nor could repel, And exil'd once the Heav'ns, the next descent was Hell. IV Hell from beneath to meet him rais'd its Head, “And now no longer shall we empty be, “Since Thou art come, the pale Abyssus said, Look! How we dress our Flames to welcome Thee! And all with Flames they Circled him around, With Flames their Princes Temples bound, An Heav'n of Flames they made him, strewd with Flames the Ground. V Rejoyce, O Heav'ns, for your Oppressor 's ceast, And tho e're long there shall from Earth ascend, An unknown Race, which shall disturb your rest; Rejoyce, and their Triumphant Arms attend, For when by these you shall invaded be, With Tears, and Importunity, Thus to be Conquer'd is to gain the Victory. VI Son of the Morning, First-born of the Light, The once bright Phospher of the Day Divine, How art Thou hurld into eternal Night, And hid in Flames, who didst with Glory shine: The bold Usurper of th' Almighty's Crown, Proud Lucifer to Hell is thrown, And sing'd the Heav'ns, as he from thence fell headlong down. L'Envoy. SONG, that long since wert finished, And for another Place design'd, Than what Thou here dost find, In a long Work, and long since promised; Say that (the Piles Foundations laid) The 'unwary Builder all his Charge has lost; For till begun As a Wise Man should first have done, He did not, as was fit, sit down; Throughly the Ground had not survey'd His Friends, or Strength had tri'd, or reckned up the cost. Convertimento á Dio. Lord, my First-fruits should have been brought to thee, Whose due I am, and all that's mine, By Birth-right Thou a Title hast to me, And by Command those Fruits are Thine; But Thine, or mine, neither have bin Offered before to Sin. Sin came, and first conceal'd my right in Thee, And then usurpt what e're was mine, But let Redemption clear Thy Right to me, And then both shall again be Thine, Both Thine and mine, tho they have bin, Offered before to Sin, Instead of First-fruits, Lord, I bring to Thee, Th' whole Harvest, which yet is not mine, Thou in return shalt give Thy self to me And make it so, because 'tis Thine: Both Thine and mine, as if 't had bin, Neve'r offered up to Sin. Deo Opt. Max. S. Qui huc usque auxiliatus est &amp; in futurum mihi Providebit. This Altar to Thy Name, Great God, I raise, The Pious Labour of my too late Praise: With Stones from Thine own sacred Quarry brought, Tho by my Artless Hand but rudely wrought. Artless and rude, tho its Traces be, Methinks I by it clearly see, My Past Supports, and Future care, And what of both 'is my present share, The Guidance of the Love Divine, Making me call his Pleasure mine. O let it in Thy Presence stand, Inviolable from any Hand. And when on it thou deignst to look, Write down the Votary in Thy Book. Who at its Foot, has his Dependance set, And in th' Inscription thus proclaimes Thee Great; To God, who hitherto has helpt; my only Trust, And for the Future will provide, for He is Just. Ad Psalmos, 1667. The following Compositions and Translations are therefore here Printed by the Authors consent and allowance (suitable enough to the general Title of RIMES, and he hopes not unbecoming his Habit, tho done the most of them long before his Admission into Holy Orders) because they have (as to such of them at least, which he could much rather have wished lost and forgotten) by some too curious Collector of such Trifles against his will and knowledg, been already from very false Copies very falsly Published, and he is not wholly out of danger for the rest, as neither was he till now for a good number of those above, whose Copies he doubts are in many Hands. ODE. Ad Passagium inducendum. Out of Italian of Mr. Fr. Petrarcha lib. 1 canza. 2. I. O aspettata in ciel Beata, &amp;c. Blest Soul, in Heaven expected long, (And long in Heav'n mayst Thou expected be, Who 'art cloath'd, not loaded with Humanity, Like others, but more Resolute, and Strong, Of God belove'd, those briny Paths to tread, Which from our unjoyn'd World, unto his Kingdom lead) Look how a Western Gale, Do's on Thy Barques spred Canvass blow, Loos'd from the Shore long since, with hoys'd up Sail, A better Port than what Thou leav'st to know! The Wind is to Thy Service prest, And from this gloomy Vale, where we complain, Both of our own, and others Wrongs in vain, Of Thy first Innocence possest, In a strait Line will drive Thee to Thy Rest, And, whether now thou 'art bound, to the true East. II. Forse I devoti, &amp;c. 'Twas, that or now the fervent Prayers Of holy Men, re'inforced by their Tears, Had on th' Eternal Goodness wrought; Or if both Prayers, and Tears were weak, And useless Arms to stop th' Almighty Justice thought, Nor us'd, it may be, its fixt Course to break; Twas that of His meer Love alone, Heav'ns Sacred King, again deny'd, Again by 'His Murdr'ous Enemies defi'd, Ith' place where He in triumph Di'd, In pity thither did at length look down. He lookt, and in the generous Brest, Of holy Charles revenge inspir'd; Revenge, which was too long desir'd, Revenge, whose lingring Europe did infest, But only to be greater was a while deferr'd. Thus would He help his Spouse belov'd, And of a War just Heav'n approv'd, The bare report found Babylon thoughtful, left her mov'd. III. Chiunque alberga 'tra Garonna, &amp;c. All, who between the Alps and Garoone dwell, Twixt Rhodanus, and Rhene, and the salt Sea, The Christian Armies with their Banners swell; Whole Spain, that Jealous ever us'd to be Of others Honour, to the Camp does come, Leaving the Pirenes behind, to guard its empty Home. Britain, and all the Isles that lie, From th' Orcades extremity, To where the Straits do Afric bound, With all where e're is found But the first Traces of the Gospels sound, Various in Garb, various in Arms and Speech, Chari'ty does to th' high Impress provoke, or else beseech. And worthier her, what could be ever done, Or who has e're so just a War begun? Not Menelaus for his Wife, nor Minos for his Son. IV. Una parte del mondo è, &amp;c. Up in the North midst Winter, and thick Snow, Beyond the Suns auspicious Ray, Where Clouds and Storms mete out the short liv'd Day, Is bred a Nation, which did never know Peace, and her Charms, or if it did, but as a Foe; Who ne're were heard, or Wounds to flie, or Pain, Or of Deaths Icy Fetters to complain, That were their Country to upbraid, and Birth to stain. These, more devout grown than of old, With German rage, have of the Sword tane hold. Turks, Arabs, Saracens, and the shame They go against of Heathen Deities, Only to know were to despise, As fit but with their Blood, their bordring Sea anew to name. A People naked, timo'rous, ignorant of War, That ne're strook blow, but from a far, And only with their Arrows wound the bloodless Air. V. Dunque hora è 'l tempo, &amp;c. Now is the time, from our too patient Neck, That ancient Yoke, wherewith we' are gall'd, to break, And from our Eyes the Vail to lay aside, Which both the Ene'mies weakness, and our strength does hide. And now, my Friend, is an occasion seen, Wherein you may those Virtues show, Which part from Heav'n you have, and part have gaind below; The Trophies of your Tongue, and learned Pen Nor will it longer any Wonder be, Tho you of Orpheus, and Amphion read, Whose Songs tam'd Beasts, and Stones did lead, When of your own a greater Miracle you see, And Men more Deaf, and Salvager than they, Led by your Skill, go where you point the Way. When Italy, awak'ned by the sound Of your loud Voice, and all her Sons around, Rise from their sleep, expecting that bright Day, When they' may get him Laurels, who with Thorns was Crownd. Ne're had that Aged Mother yet, An opportunity so fair, her Sons a cause more great. VI. Tu c' hai per arrichir, &amp;c. Thou, who to' enrich the Treasure of thy Brain, Hast many a flying Roll turnd o're, Of th' present Times, and those that went before, And on those Wings to Heav'n aloft dost soar, Seeing the Fates of Empires all beneath Thee plain; Full well Thou knowst how in the Roman State, From the first Day that Mars his Son, In Blood laid its Foundation, Till great Augustus, who thrice entred the triumphal Gate, Rome of her Blood was ever free, And for the Wrongs her Alleys bore, Without regret that Sacrifice could see: And shall she now more sparing be, When stricter Bands, and sacred Piety, Expect, and challenge more, Her Saviour to revenge, and Sepul'cher to restore? What help can Nature yield, or Art, Or what faint hopes inforce the Enemies part, When from Christ's Hand is thrown the first &amp; fatal Dart? VII. Pon mente al temerario, &amp;c. Think of Proud Xerxes bold design, Who to approach and tread our Shore Europe and Asia, with a Bridg did joyn, And Seas an Outrage bore, Which Rivers only felt unwillingly before. The Persian Dames, who thought to Greet Their Husbands Victo'ries, and their Conquests meet, At their o're-throw confounded stood, In Black they Mourn'd, and th' Hellespont triumph'd in Blood. Nor is't this Naval Victory alone, Which like Success does promise you; But the unlucky Marathon, To th' Father so, as Thermopyle was to the Son, When brave Leonidas, with but a few, Maintain'd those Straits, and like a Lion flew, Or Eagle on the Prey, and did more than Subdue. With thousand Histories more, Which you'my Friend, have heard and read, and treasur'd up in store. Wherefore the least which you can do, Devoutly is that God to Praise, Who for such haypy Times, and hopes has cast your Days. Comiato. To Rome long since, and Tybers Streams, Petrarch this Ode, when his, did recommend; To London now, and the more honour'd Thames, Since thus made mine, I it abroad will send, (Where more judicious Spi'rits its numbers will attend,) And thence whole Christendome invite, All other Wars being thrown aside, In vain 'twixt Brethren for false Glory often tri'd, In an Eternal League to' unite, And where the true may be 'easier gain'd, with Infidels to fight. 1668. ODE. To the Right Reverend Father in God GEORGE Lord Bishop of Winton, my very good Lord. Out of Italian of Fr. Petrach, l. 1. Canz. 12. I. Una Donna piu bella. A fair, and Vertuous Dame, Bright as the Mid-day Sun, but more Divine, My tender Age first overcame, And made me to her part my Fortunes joyn. With thoughts uncommon she my Mind inspir'd, Then gave me Words their Image to express, Whilst the dull World judg'd me to sloth retir'd, Or piti'd, (which was worse) my Unhappiness, (For such it counts those gifts, which Heav'n-born Souls possess.) Through thousand ways she was my guide, And changing still from what I was, Tho her fair Eyes she with a Vail did hide, I felt their Influence through my Liver pass; So that for love of her I 'have undergone Such Hardships, and such Risques have run, That if at last I shall arrive At th' happy Port, I hope to live Beyond the power of Death, an Age, which She can give. II. Questa mia Donna. 'Twas many a Year, that thus She led me on, Big with Conceit, and Youthful Fire; For trial, as I since have known, If I'd prove constant to my first desire, Shewing me now her Mantle, Shade, or Vest, But to my Fancy leaving all the rest: With which yet well enough content, My Youth I in her Service spent So pleasantly, that I can scarce the Time repent. At length, prevail'd on by my Prayers, My Importunity, and Tears, Her Glories She was pleas'd to show; But then how little was't that I before did know? “'Twas midnight with me sure, I said, till now. And with the sight there rose a storm of Cares, Amaz'd I at the Vision stood, Wisht in my Arms, what yet I fear'd too good, A Flame was in my Heart, and Ice was in my Blood. III. Ma non me'l tolse la paura. In this Surprize the heat I felt within Gave me new Courage, and did make me bold; Whilst the chil Fetters, which did hold My Captive Powers, to loosen did begin, And nearer I approacht to 'admire her Beauties yet unseen. I came, and gazing stood, when she Turning to mine her Heav'nly Face, “Now, Friend, that I am Fair, said, you may see, “Possibly Fairer than you ghest I was, “I'm sure more Powerful, for what ever now “Befits your Years but ask, and I'll bestow. “'Tis a long time, Fair One, I said, “That on you only have I placed my love, “The Joys of which I here most truly prove, “With Air before, and empty Shadows fed; “But now so strangely smitte'n, that to require “Ought but your Pleasure, were my' own ruine to desire. With a Voice then, and look Divine, Which chase'd my Fears, and did my Hope refine, In this most gracious Speech, she answer'd mine. IV. Rado fu al mondo, &amp;c. “In your mad World, and its Impertinence, “'Tis rare, but when my Worth is heard, “The veriest Stock has felt some little sense, “And my just Service for a time preferr'd: “In love to me, and my rewards would burn; “Only my cruel Enemy, “That seeks what e're I build to overturn, “Quenches the Flames I kindle with mine Eye, “And makes all Vertue die; “Promising largely, what he ne're can grant, “Those Pleasures, and that ease he crys my Subjects want. “But Love, my Friend, has said so much of you, “And all he said I find so true, “That you henceforth my Charge shall be, “Unsought for Honours both to Gain, and Merit too. “One of my choicest Friends I'll stile you now, “And as to such, a Fairer Lady show, “Than me you 'admire, where you more richly may your Love bestow. V. I 'volea dir, &amp;c.

I lookt, but strait inclin'd my Head, With Wonder struck, and sacred Dread; I lookt again, and felt within, A new, and greater Flame begin: Which as she saw her Railliery thus she drest, “I well enough know where-about you are, “And as the Sun, when he doth first appear, “Makes every Star its twinkling ray devest, “Perceive my Eyes now seem less bright, “Since thus obscur'd by 'a greater Light; “Tho to be hers, you need not me to leave, “For to us both one Seed and Birth did being give, “She as the Elder first, then I did mine receive. VI. Ruppesi in tanto, &amp;c. A Strain so sweet my Tongue unloos'd, And fearing now no more the Shame I had conceiv'd, upon my hasty Flame, Least my first Love should deem her self abus'd, Thus I repli'd: “If this be true (“And who dare doubt it once, since said by you) “Thrice happy Father, and thrice happy Day, “In which you two into the World were brought! “And such from hence shall all that time be thought, “Which others tell I' have fondly thrown away. “'Tis now my Trouble more, “Than e're it was my Joy before, “That I reacht here so late, or did no sooner stray. “But if I'm worthy, and 'tis fit to show “Of your Condition more than what I know, “A greater Honour you to none can ever do. Looking me then to th' very Heart, And with her Eye engraving there, What e're she spake, in a deep Character, Fixt and Compos'd she thus resum'd her part. VII. Si come piacque, &amp;c. “Know then, 'twas our Eternal Father's Will, “That we, like Him, should both Immortal be; “But what's all that to you the while? “Wretches enamour'd of your Slavery, “For whom 'twere better, that the fault were ours, “Of all the disrespect we find, than that 'tis only yours. “Courted and Lov'd we were of Old, “But now to such a Pass reduc'd, “That she to Heav'n, and Contemplation us'd, “Has taken Flight to reach her ancient hold: “I stay'd behind a while, but have been so abus'd, “That thither too I'll 'scape e're long, “And only where she gives the ground, inspire the Song: “For of my self I'm but her empty shade. Then turning as about to go, “But first receive as both our Gift, she said, “This Wreath, which we for you together made! And with her Hands she bound Immortal Bays, my Temples all around. Comiato.

Citing my old, and cruel Master, Love, Before that Queen, which holds our part Divine, And first descending from the Seats above, Ith' Brain enthron'd with Heavenly Light does shine, I shew'd my self like Gold, by Flames made fine. Loaded I came, with Horrour, Grief, and Fear, Those heavy Chains my Jaylor on me laid, And as a Wretch, who begs his Judg to hear, Tho Self-condemn'd, and of pale Death afraid, I bow'd to th' Bar, and all in Tears thus said: “In an ill Hour, Great Queen, I toucht the Land “Of this false Prince, where Rage, and Pride command; “And where, even from a Youth, I underwent “Such different Torments, that with Pain quite spent, “My Life seem'd more a burden than delight, “And Patience was o'recome, tho next to Infinite. II Cosi 'l mia tempo, &amp;c “In Pains, and Anguish, spending thus my Age, “How many Seasons did I, Fool, despise, “My self in Noble Studies to engage, “Whereby in Wealth I might, and Honour rise, “Deceiv'd of both by empty Flatteries? “But where's the Wit that can such Words command, “And at its pleasure fit Expressions call, “That others may my Miseries understand, “And how I'm just to implead this Criminal? “How little Hony has Love, and how much Gall! “I tasted both, but both were temper'd so, “The sweet above, the bitter lay below; “Seducing to fond Amours by surprize, “A Soul, if I mistake not, made to rise, “And up in Heav'n Exalted look more fair: “Nor did Love only break my Peace, but rais'd new War.

Love is a Net, and Love's a Snare, A Thief disguis'd is Love; Poyson below, Honey above, A Serpent under Flowers most fair, Fatal as Death, whose bitings are: A Whirl-pool sounded ne're to be, And a foul Sea from Tempests never free. Love is a Lion robb'd of his Prey, A Wolf with Famin pin'd; Love is a Fortress undermin'd, A Fire, whose flames no Floods allay; Flattery, which does our Life betray; A Labrinth pleasant to the Eye, But without Clew to guide the Wanderer by. Love is a Rock of Ambushments, A weeping Crocodile; A Syrene us'd to Sing, and Spoil, And all the Lovers false Contents, Are Frauds which he too late repents: Love's an incurable Disease, And War eternal mid vain boasts of Peace. Dirupisti, Domine, vincula mea, Tibi bostiam landis Sacrificabo! SONNET. Loves Exaltation. Enlarge Thy flight, Love, said I, and on high Raise my dull Soul, those Beauties to admire, Which in the Heav'nly Treasuries do lie, And Mortal Brests with holy Flame inspire! Shew me the Spring of that Celestial Fire, Design'd our Earthy Dross to purifie, But after which in vain below we' enquire, Who sit down ith' warm Sun of a fair Eye! So up he rais'd me, but no Tongue can tell, What I in Rapturous Vision did behold: My Love I found was Pure, and made me bold: This only I remember very well, So high we soar'd, till on an Arch above, I saw inscrib'd, SACRED TO HEAVENLY LOVE. ODE. The Thoughts. Out of the Italian of Fr. Petrach, l. 1. Canz. 21. I. I'vo pensando, &amp;c. Full of strange Thoughts, and pensive as I go, A tenderness, which to my self I owe, So strongly does my Mind assail, And so insensibly prevail, That all in Tears I flow, But for my own misfortune now, And not anothers Cruelty, as I was wont to do. For seeing every Day my end draw nigh, A thousand times of God I've begg'd those Wings, With which from this lewd World, and Mortal things, Th' unpinion'd Soul to Heav'n does flie; And beg still, but he does the Grace deny. And tho I Sigh, and Grieve, and Pray, That Happiness does countermand; But reason 'tis, that he, who will not upright stand, When 'tis in his own Power, or wilfully must stray, Low as the Earth should lie, and never find his way. I see, 'tis true, th' Eternal Arms extended wide, But my own Fear, and others Fate, Who have deferr'd till 'twas too late, Make me tremble at my present state. Another Tyran too beside, Whom oft to throw, in vain I oft have try'd, Furiously spurs me on. (Ah!) Whither will he ride? II. L'un pensier parla, &amp;c. But, (Lo!) what thoughts my mind assault, And how to it thus One roundly says; “Why, foolish Thing, why these delays? “What lookt-for Succour causes such an Alt? “Seest thou not how the winged Minutes pass, “And add more Years to thy Disgrace, “And yet thy help as far to seek, as e're it was? “Take, rather take thy last Farewel, “And do it quickly; every Root destroy “Of fruitless Pleasure, which couldst thou enjoy “In its Perfection, for it thou must sell “Thy Soul, and Liberty, and in an hurry dwell. “But since thou ne're canst that expect, “And in the toilsome quest art tir'd, “Of what's so much admired, “Yet which the glozing World, when it does thee neglect, “May to an He as ill deserving give, “Why as fixt here dost thou live, “And midst rude Wars, and giddy Vanity, “Hope for Peace and Constancy? “Now while thou mayst dare to be Wise! “In thine own hand keep fast the Rein! “And since thou must begin again, “Stop, and turn back, the Road behind thee lies. “Tis hazardous thou knowst too long to stay, “And till to Morrow leave, what's better done to Day. III. Gia sai tu ben, &amp;c. “Long since Thou hast been taught, nor art thou now “To learn, what Happiness, and Content, “From the fairest Eyes are sent “To 'n Heart, that does the Charms of Beauty know. “But what think'st Thou both had been, “What Thy Content, and Happiness, “The greater Glory, and the less, “If those fair Eyes had ne're been seen, “And in their stead another Flame had entred in? “Thou well remembrest, (and 'tis well thou dost) “How their Image seiz'd thee first, “And thy Heart like Lightning pierc'd, “Where it was so much Lord of all the Coast, “So fatally did overcome, “That none for other Loves it left, scarce for it self had room. “With that thou first wert set on fire, “And if its wild fallacious heat, “Has held thee many Years with vain desire, “And expectation of what ne're was yet, “Nor e're may come, (that joyful Day “Which should thy Mise'ries end, and largely for thy waiting pay,) “For none so silily themselves undo “As Lovers, and so thanklesly if Poets too.) “Why dost thou not to a better hope thy Soul advance, “And Heav'ns Immortal Glories view? “For if one Smile, one pleasing Glance, “A Song dear purchas'd, one kind word or two, “The price of Love can here enhance, “What will those Heavenly Beauties do; “And how great must the Pleasure be above, “Where they do ever Sing, and where they ever Love! IV. Da l' altra parte. On tother side, a different thought, With a sharp, but pleasing pain, Of Hope and Fear together wrought, Makes me love it, but complain. For while with Hope it feeds my Heart, And profers Fame to crown desert, The Fear I can despise, and dare the cruel smart. Insensible it almost renders me, Of all but its dear self insensible, The effects of Study I ne're feel How hot or cold, how pale so e're I be; Nor will one Death to kill 't suffice, One Death to end its Tyrannies, Since throughly slain, it does with greater vigor only rise. When but a Child, as a Child with me it plaid, Just like my self, and as I grew encreast; Nor will 't I fear permit me any rest, Till in one Tomb we be together laid. Dead with my Body, there 'twill lie, Nor any further with me go; And then what signifies this Fame, if I Its best Report can never know? Since there must once a parting be, And away the Shade will flee For the true substance I'll leave it, e're that leave me. V. Ma quel' altro voler. But (Oh!) that Passion like my Soul, Which in each part is all, and all ith' whole, And as a great, and spreading Root, To' it self the moisture draws, and starves the Ground about, How does it Vex, and Torture me, When I my Pride, and Folly see, My Ignorance, and Vanity, Of others writing still, so mindless of my self to be! Those Eyes I mean, whose heavy Chain, My captive Will does so restrain, That Art and Force to break it I employ in vain. What then, tho my spread Sails are fill'd, And that prepar'd I for the Voyage am, If yet my Barque midst Rocks is held, By two such Cables, Love, and Fame? But Thou, my God, who from those other Bands, With which the sottish World's held fast, Long since my freedom Ransom'd hast; Why hear not these Thy great Commands, And loose the Pris'ner, who with shame confounded stands? Abasht I stand, and like a Man at Night, Assaulted in his Dreams, with Deaths grim sight, Fain would resist, but want both words to speak, and Arms to fight. VI. Quel ch' i' fo veggio, &amp;c. I well enough know what I ought to do, Nor does the Ignorance of what is true, At all deceive me; but this Love, With which so mise'rably I am opprest, Tho all his, and my 'own Follies I reprove, Too much, and much too long of me possest, Permits me not one step to move, And the true Honours shiny Path intend above. Yet now and then there does begin, Something, I know not what, to strive within; A cruel and severe Disdain, Thus for ever to remain, And where of all it may be read again, This secret thought writes in my Forehead plain. “What can more unmorthy be, “The Man, who does to th' fairest Prize aspire, “Than towards Mortal things to be on fire, “With the same Flame that only fits the Deity? Nor does it thus alone, but crys aloud To my Reason, drawn aside, And behind my Senses hid; Reason obeys, and strait condemns what it allowd. But as I'm thinking back to go, Custome does, or make me stay, Or leads me to some other way; I gaze, and that does show The brightest Eyes, e're shon below, But born alass for my incurable Disease, For too much me, too much their cruel selves they please VII. Ne so che spatio mi, &amp;c. How long, or short the space may be, Which when into this World I first came down, By Heav'ns Arrest was granted me, To undergo Wars misery, And all those pains, which from my self have grown, I know as little, as I do the Time, When this wretched Life shall end; For both are Mysteries too sublime, And Mortal knowledg far transcend. But this I know, and daily find, That all without, and all within My Body 's chang'd, and so 's my Mind. Gray Hairs appear, nor is th' End far behind When to approach these Harbingers begin. Like a Man therefore, who much Ground and Day has lost But wiser made at length by his cost. I'm thinking oft to take the Right Hand way, Where I see my Journey lay, And which when first I left, I first began to stray: But Grief and Shame to have truanted so long, Hold my one half, Pleasure does t'other seize, Pleasure through Custome grown so strong, That it with Death dare stand on terms for War or Peace. Comiato. SONG, thou seest me as I am, And me more than thou Petrarch sawst of old, With an Heart than Ice more cold, Ne're to be thaw'd I fear by any Flame, But that which in 'its embrace the Universe shall hold. Yet (Lo!) I am resolv'd again, Once more the great Experiment to try, Tho ne're liv'd Man in so much pain, With Death, or in his Heart, or Eye. But this my Trouble does renew, That what I would, I cannot do, And what I hate and would not, that I vigorously pursue. 1668. SONNET. Convertimento á Dio. Io son sistanco sotto 'l, &amp;c. Out of Italian of Mr. Fr. Petrarc. Sonnet 59. Tir'd, and almost or'ecome with th' heavy weight, Of my old Sins, by Custome grown so strong, I'm fearful, lest Lifes way being rough and long, I from it turn, by my own, or Foes deceit. I have a Friend 'tis true, that from Heav'ns height, Came down to free me, and redress my Wrong, Of love he came, but quickly 'amidst the throng I lost him, whose return in vain I wait; Upwards he flew, and flying thus did cry, “Burd'ned and weary Souls, behold your Way “Hither, come hither to me, and find Rest!

The present Life's a Field, till thus improv'd, In which midst Flowers an hidden Snake does lie, And tho its Verdure please the wanton Eye, Death from th' unwary Foot 's not far remov'd. Would you then have a Mind at last secure, And endless Joys, in which thou mayst persever, Follow the Few, to them thy Steps inure, And all thou canst to leave the most endeavour! Brother, you teach well, but yourself first sure, Who oft have stray'd, yet more of late than ever. SONNET. To the now M??. M. W. under the feigned Name of Iärma, with the Parable of the Pilgrim. A tedious Age, I like this Pilgrim spent, In search of that fair Place, where Heav'n design'd, I should an end of all my Travels find; But still I stray'd the more, the more I went, I stray'd till Clelia in a Vision sent Illustrious Rays, diffus'd o're all my Mind, And made me see the Way lay far behind, Whose entrance was my Wandrings to Repent, She told me what Companions I should take, How Resolution and Humility, And Faith and Charity I should provide, If I a prosperous Journey hope'd to make. But where dear Clelia do these Graces lie? Iärma has them all, make her your Guide. 1666. SONNET. To the Reverend Mr. J. G.

To your account shall be at th' Audit plac'd, Who Virtues Path by few trod, made me know, And timely did my wandring Youth reclaim, By Grave Advice, tho not so reckoned then, (The more my Folly) how e're it has been since; But when the Spirit Divine to blow begins, What Boys we scorn'd, we follow close grown Men, And the kind Warner have in greatest Fame. SONNET. On the Picture of our LORD, represented on the Cross as Dead. The Hint out of the Italian of Marino. Pietoso quanto accorto, &amp;c. Something there was, Great Master, more than chance That Thou the Pencils Wonders to express, And therein Thy more wonderous Hands address, Tookst my Dead Lord, the Colours to advance. Pity directed Thee that Choice to make, And (having in Thy Pious Brest design'd, To shew how rude the Jews, Thy Self how kind) His Pale and Lifeless Form resolve to take, 'Twas nobly done; for hadst Thou made him breathe, Ever in Torment he had seem'd to live, And from Thy Hands a greater Wound receive.

And Thou, if Thou desir'st that Friend to be, What art the better for it in the Grave, Thither Thy Fame will never follow Thee, Nor with the Dead shalt Thou more Honour have For Verse, than if Thou Verse hadst never known, The Living will not, Dead can give Thee none.

Fathers through our Land, Thee, I, tho far unworthy, Greet, And at Thy Gates, as does a Son befit, To lead him to his Stall with Songs, Thy late great Guardian meet. II. With Thee, my Song, in Thee this happy Man, Whilst only Thine, a bold Attempt began, Whose Fame Posterity shall ne're let die, But thence it self instructed how to live, Due Honours to the first Discoverer give, And Consecrate his Name to Vast Eternity. A bold Attempt it was, worthy this Age, And Him, whom Heaven did with the thought Inspire, (Yet which this Age can ne're enough Admire, How full so e're of Art, and Learned Rage,) In Natures search alone, and bravely to engage. At Home he sought, but there Only some Traces of her Footsteps were. For tho with Him she long Inhabited, And lay in his Retreats secure, Seen but of few, once urg'd, could not endure A public Scrutiny, and at the News away she fled. He follow'd close, and lodg'd her in the Town; LONDON, that was so big, and populous grown, She hop'd, or there to hide, or there to pass unknown, And midst the Multitude, The Noise, the Hurry, and the Crowd, As safely breath, as in a Solitude. III. But all in vain, He quickly found Her out, And having Summond to his Aid, The Wise, the Learned, and the Stout, (All noted Champions, and in Wars assaid) What was before a search to Arms Decision brought. Levies on both Hands listed were, And Nature, then Attaqu't, began to fear; But like a Conqueror, and ne're known to yield, To be Obey'd, and not Compell'd, Led up her Self her Troops into the Field. A mighty Host they made, Encamped wide, And with their Wings toucht Heav'n on either side. 'Gainst which a little Party, reinforc'd By Reason, and Experience, Approved Arms, for Battery, and Defence, Both often Try'd, and not alone Discours'd, Came boldly forth, and did Defiance bid; But in the others shouts were drownd, and in the other Numbers hid IV. And now both Sides had joyn'd the Fight, One to maintain, t'other their Conquests to extend; When, (look!) between the Camps, a glorious sight, The British Gardian-Angel cloath'd in Light, Did on an Azure Cloud descend, And to the baleful Quarrel with his Presence put an end. He came, but not ith' Shape he takes above, For that 's a Form too subtile, and too great, With its excessive Lustre Mortal Eyes did threat, And in his Fellow Spirits dreadful Wonder move, But like the Warriers to whom he was sent, And suiting th' Embassy, on which he went, The Faith's DEFENDER, Heav'ns best Charge did represent, In Rings of Polisht Jet, so shon his Hair, A Colour that in Heav'n is rare, But yet in Heav'n admir'd, for such the Almighty Son does wear. Over his glittering Arm was thrown, A Military Crim'som Vest; Close by his Brest his Sword hung down, And did in his Embroidered Scabard rest. His Left Hand held a Silver Shield, Charg'd with three Leopards, in a Canton of the Field. Two shiny Talbots in his Right he led, Such as are in the Heav'nly Forrests bred, And o're his Godlike Head, An Eagle her extended Wings auspiciously did spread. V. “Give o're, He said, give o're your Rage, “A better Fortune both your Arms attends; “Nor let it be reported, ith' next Age, “That furious Zeal, and unknown Ends, “In Civil Wars destroy'd the best and dearest Friends! “For such you are, and by the High Decree, “Shall with united force those Trophies raise, “Over Mankinds common Enemy, “Proud Ignorance, and blind Credulity, “As shall gain both deserved Praise, “And fetch from Worlds as yet unknown for both Immortal Bays. “You NATURE, and 'tis Gods Command, not mine, “To these shall all your Store submit; “Whose Industry, with Skill shall joyn, “To search, Improve, and Husband it. “Together Reconcil'd you shall abide, “My CHARLES shall of his Goodness so provide, “Who will your FOUNDER, and your PATRON be, “Call you the ROYAL, and his own SOCIETY: “And of his special Grace to th' new Erected Company, “With you his rich Hereditary Coat divide, (“As on this Shield:) If any Doubt arise “In your Inquests, Lo! Heav'ns and my Supplies, “These TALBOTS scent, that EAGLES Wings, and Eyes. VI. But whither Muse, Ah! whither wilt thou rove? Already thou hast stray'd enough, And in thy wild unruly Flight, Forgot thy Reverend Prelate quite, And lost of thy first Theam the sight. He's gone, but if thou haste dost make, And haste thou oughtst, for my sake, and thine own, And in his Learned Train make one, His Learned Train, thou quickly mayst o'retake: And e're he Chester reach, so slow, So heavily his Wheels do go, (Yet not from His, but Friends delay, Who wish him there, but yet with them would have him stay) Be ready with the Ancient Dee, (Dee in praise will joyn with Thee) His Entrance to attend, and Installation see. VII. Hail! Sacred Stream, Prophetic Flood, Who couldst of Old the Fates of Nations tell; The Fates of Nations now Thou skill'st as well, As when Thy Channel leaving Thou didst bode Their Misery, 'or their Happiness e're either fell. For this 'twas that thou gotst the Name Of Dee the Holy, and Divine, And amongst Rivers of the loudest Fame, As rich in Wonders, and illustriously dost Shine. To whom all else Renown'd, And with Genial Honours Crown'd, Or for their pleasant Banks, or Waters pride, And little Mysteries, which they're said to hide, All but the Starry Thames, above Eridan falsly call'd, their Places yield: And in the Oceans boundless Field, Where every Night they meet, in a long Row behind thee move. Worthy thou art, thrice worthy of my Song; And worthy Thee, in all Thy Glory, The Man we both admire, of both expected long, My Numbers to advance, and to revive Thy Story. VIII. Till He was Thine, something there was did want, To render Thee compleat: The Colony Rome on thy Banks did Plant, Made Thee not half so great, Nor is it self so famous for Agricola's, as his Seat. His happy River, whose vast Spring Of Real Goodness, and of Learned Arts the best, A new increase shall to Thy Waters bring; Joyning with which they ne're shall rest, Till they those Triumphs end, which EDGAR on thee did begin. “Well row'd my Braves, the British Monarch cry'd, As at the Helm Victoriously He stood, His Tributary Kings on either side, (Eight Tributary Kings at th' Oar then ply'd) Tugging to waft him down the Flood. Tiber did never Day so glorious see, Nor could Augustus, in such State, After his Alexandrian Victory, Enter Romes Triumphal Gate; He the Effigies had to show But of one Queen, and her tane, when Dead too. EDGAR Throned Kings had Eight, All in their Robes, on him to wait, And all with Crowns upon their Heads his Barge to row. L'Envoy. At Chester, Song, Thou wilt behold The Wonders, which Thou here hast told; But let not all Thy Time be spent, In a search too inquisitive; Find out the Rev'rend Father there, to whom thou'rt sent, And humbly at his Knees receive That Blessing, which return'd thou mayst thy Master give! So shalt Thou into Credit grow, And have from him that Honour, Verse on others must bestow To the Honourable Sir JOHN DENHAM, upon his New Version of the Psalms. I Twas but of late, that in our Northern Clime, Verse, which had many Ages been a Slave, Regain'd its freedom, and tho bound to Rime, The Tyrans, which had humbled it, did Brave. II Fetter'd before in gross Impertinence, And by strange Monsters forc'd, it Pris'ner lay; Whose Strength was big swoln Words, and empty sense, And all the Cheats, which Ignorance betray. III To make Vile Anagrams, was its best Art, And lewdly then to descant on the Text; Whose Gloss was evermore the dullest part, And all the Wit to seem, and be perplext. IV Then motly Metaphors at length stole in, And that the Poet might his Treasures boast; Rubies and Pearls were in each couplet seen, And a poor Sonnet would an Empire cost. V But still the Sun to th' hardest Task was prest, And wearied with his Journey all Day long, I'th' Sea at Night enjoy'd but confus'd rest, For less the World could want him than a Song. VI These were the Vices captive Verse obey'd, With thousand worse, to which it did submit; Till you the Enemies weakness open laid, And to its ancient Grandure ransom'd it. VII 'Twas you, great Sir, who like the Redcross Knight, To save the Damsel Poesy, arose; Like him did with th' Enchanted Dragon fight, And made her Reign a Queen, amidst her Foes. VIII Wit from your Pen, was quite another thing, Than what the Ignorant imagin'd it; And in your manner skilfully to Sing, More than to make rich Rimes, and Noises hit. IX Twas Manly, Grave, and full of sprit'ely Fire, The same that it was sixteen Centuries past; Able the very Reader to inspire, And whose fixt Monument shall ever last. X But sacred Poesy lay all this while Scorn'd, or Neglected, as it was before; As if it were no Sacriledg to spoil, But what from God was once Robb'd, to restore. XI Any thing for the Temple would suffice, No matter how ill drest the Service were; To th' Institution it did nearer rise, More like th' unpolisht Altar, and Goats Hair. XII Waiting your help it lay, who to redeem The Credit, which it long unjustly lost; Have rais'd it to a more enlarg'd esteem, Lov'd of the best, and Courted by the most. XIII From you the Jewish Psalmist has receiv'd The latest Glory, which he could expect; And all, who at his barbarous Sufferings griev'd, With Pleasure on them thus expir'd reflect. XIV You were that Worthy, for whom all did look, To' attempt, and execute this bold Design; Nor was there other Way, than what you took, By Humane Poesy, to restore Divine. XV For as ith' Revolutions of Great States, Civility Religion did produce; The Muses Kingdoms too have born like Fates, By' you first made Civil, then Religious. L'Envoy. Full often, Song, I've griev'd, thou staydst at Home, Nor kiss'dst those Hands for which thou wert design'd; Sure hadst Thou ever to His Presence come, The known He 'had lov'd, who to th' unknown was kind 1668. ODE. To Mr. Isaac Walton, Publishing the Life of Mr. George Herbert. I. Heav'ns youngest Son, its Benjamin, Divinities next Brother, Sacred Poesy, No longer shall a Virgin reck'ned be, (What e're with others 'tis, how e're call'd so by me) A Female Muse, as were the Nine, But full of Vigor Masculine, An Essence Male, with Angels in shar'd Glories joyn With Angels first the Heav'nly Child was bred, And, while a Child, instructed them to Sing The Praises of th' Immortal King, Who Lucifer in Triumph led. For as in Chains the Monster sank to Hell, And tumbling Headlong down the Precipice fell, By Him well thew'd and tutor'd well, “How art Thou fallen, Morning Star, they said! Too fondly then we 'have fanci'd him a Maid, We the vain Brethren of the Riming Trade, A Female Angel less would Rafaels skill upbraid. II. Thus 'twas in Heav'n, this Poesies Sex and Age, And when He thence to 'our lower World came down, He chose a Form most like his own, And Jesses youngest Son inspir'd with holy Rage; The sprightly Shepherd felt unusual Fire, And up he took his Tuneful Lyre; He took it up and strook 'it, and 'his own soft touches did admire. Thou Po'esy on Him didst bestow, An Honour shew'd before to none; And to prepare his Way to th' Hebrew Throne, Gave'st him Thy Empire, and Dominion: The happy Land of Verse, where flow Rivers of Milk, and Groves of Laurel grow; Wherewith Thou didst adorn his Brow, And madst his first most flourishing, &amp; Triumphal Crown. Assist me Thy great Prophets Praise to Sing; David the Poets, and blest Israels King, And with the dancing Eccho let the Mountains ring! Then on the Wings of some auspicious Wind, Let His great Name from Earth be rais'd on High, And in the Starry Volume of the Skie, A lasting Record find; Be with His mighty Psaltery joyn'd, Which taken up long since into the Air, And call'd the Harp, makes a bright Constellation there! III. Worthy it was to be Translated hence, And there in view of all Exalted hang, To which so oft the Princely Prophet sang, And sacred Ora'cles did dispence; Tho had it still remain'd below, More Wonders of it, we e're now had seen, How great the mighty Herberts Skill had been: Herbert, who could so much without it do, Herbert who perfectly its Chords did know, More perfectly than any Child of Verse does now. Ah! had we known him half so well! But then, my Friend, there had been left for you, Nothing so fair, and worthy Praise to undergo, Who so exactly all his Story tell, That, tho we envy not his Bays, Nor all the Piramids Verse can raise, Your Hand, and Pen we do, that eternize his Praise. Herbert, and Donn again are joyn'd, Here below, as they 'are above; The Friends are in their old Embraces twin'd: And since by you that Enterview 's design'd, Too weak to part them Death does prove, But in one Book they greet again, as in one Heav'n they love. L'Envoy. To Wotton too, my Song, A kind remembrance Thou dost owe, With my Friends Name, who made Thee know This great Triumvirate of Verse; but long Too long, I fear, Thou then wouldst be, If not o're-born, with th' mighty subjects Dignity. ODE. To the same Mr. Is. Wa. upon the Publication of the Reverend Mr. Richard Hooker's Life. I. Hail, Sacred Mother, British Church, all hail! From whose fruitful Loyns have sprung, Of Pious Sons so great a throng, That Heav'n to 'oppose their force of Strength does fail, And lets the mighty Victors, o're Almighty Arms prevail. How art Thou chang'd from what Thou wert of late, When destitute, and quite forlorn, And scarce a Child of thousands with Thee left to mourn, Thy Vail all rent, and all Thy Garments torn, With Tears Thou didst bewail Thine own, and Childrens Fate? Too much (alas!) Thou didst resemble then, Sion Thy Type, Sion in Ashes laid, Despis'd, forsaken, and betray'd. Sion Thou dost resemble once again, And rais'd like her, the Glory of the World art made. Threnes to Thee only could that time belong, But now Thou art the happy subject of my Song. II. Begin, my Song, and where the doleful Mother sat, (As it in Vision was the Prophet shown) Lamenting with the rest her dearest Son, Blest CHARLES, who his Fore-fathers has out-run, And to the Royal joyn'd the Martyrs brighter Crown; Let a new City rise, with beauteous State, And beauteous let its Temple be, and beautiful the Gate! See! how the sacred Fabrique up does rise, The Architects so Skilful all, So Grave, so Humble, and so Wise, The Axes, and the Hammers noise, Is drownd in Silence, or in Numbers Musical. 'Tis up, and at the Altar stand The Reverend Fathers, as of old, With Harps, and Incense in their Hand, Nor let the Pious Service grow, or Dumb, or Cold. Th' Inferiour Priests, the while, To Praise continually employ'd, or Pray, Need not the weary Hours beguile, Enough 's the single duty of each Day; Thou thy Self, Woodford, on thy humbler Pipe mayst play: And tho but lately 'admitted there, So gracious those Thou Honour'st all appear, So ready, and attent to hear, An easie part, proportion'd to Thy Skill may'st bear. III. But where (alas!) where wilt Thou fix Thy choice? The Subjects are so noble all, So great their Glories, and Thy Art so small, They 'll judg, I fear, themselves disparag'd by Thy voice. Yet try; and since Thou canst not take A Name, so dispicably low, But 'twill exceed what Thou canst do, Tho Thou thy' whole Mite away at once shouldst throw, Thy Poverty a Vertue make, And that Thou may'st Immortal live, (Since Immortality Thou canst not give) From one, who has to spare be 'ambitious to receive! Of Reverend, and Judicious Hooker Sing! Hooker does to the Church belong, The Church and Hooker claim Thy Song, And inexhausted Riches to Thy Verse will bring; So far beyond it self will make it grow, That Life his Gift to Thee, thou shalt again on him bestow. IV. How great, blest Soul! must needs Thy Glory be, Thy Joys how perfect, and Thy Crown how fair, Who mad'st the Church thy chiefest care, This Church, who owes so much to Thee, That all her Sons must Sacrifice unto Thy Memory. 'Twas a bold Work the Captive to redeem, But bolder the Opprest to raise, (Our Aged Mother) to that due esteem, She had and merited in her younger Days; When Primitive Zeal, and Piety, Were her best Laws, and Policy, And decent Worship kept the mean, Its too wide-stretcht extreams between, The rudely scrupulous, and too wanton vain. This was the Work of Hookers Pen, With Judgment, Candour, and such Learning writ, Matter, and Words so' exactly fit, That were it to be done agen, Expected 'twould be, as its Answer hitherto has been. Retornata. To Chelsey, Song, and tell thy Masters Friend, The Church is Hooker's Debtor, Hooker his; And strange 'twould be, if he should Glory miss, For whom two such most powerfully contend. Bid him chear up, the Day 's his own, And he can never Die, Who after Seventy 's past and gone, Can all th' assaults of Age defie; Is Master still of so much Youthful heat, A Child so perfect, and so spirit'ous to beget. The Metamorphosis CLELIA [chang'd into] A BAIE. To the Memory of Mrs. A. W. who died in Childbed, 14 January, 1663–4. Down in a Vale, between two shady Groves, Whose Trees in sighs bewail'd their distant Loves, And o're a Stream, which gently glid below; Stretcht their long Arms, and leafy Heads did bow, As if each others Necks they would embrace, And murmuring chid the interrupting space; Sylvius the wretched Shepherd chose to lay, Clelias remains, and his own Vows to pay. The Tomb nor Marble was, nor glitterant Brass, No weighty Pile, but Bank of Turfy Grass, Which he himself cast up, and all around, With Winter Roses strewd the sacred Ground. Close by a mournful Tablet hung, whose Verse Was thus engrav'd— Kind Earth, where I securely trust My Dearest half, in Peace to sleep; Be sure thou safely guard her Dust, And undisturb'd the still lov'd Ashes keep: But look thou lightly on them fall, And as in thine own Center have no weight at all! So shalt thou be with Roses Crown'd, And all those Flowers, which now I strow, Again, as in their Native Ground, Only more fair, shall in thy Bosom grow; Maintain'd by an Eternal Spring, Which with my constant Tears, I to these Banks will bring. Witness ye Floods, which deeper run, By them encreast than heretofore; And as you purling roll along, Those ancient bounds you seldom toucht, run o're; At my request yet higher swell, And what's their power, tho in your broken numbers, tell. With you my Tears, but here's my Fire, Preserv'd alive in Clelias Urn; Never to Languish, or Expire, But in the next Age to break forth and burn: When it to Verse a Theam shall give, And by the Flames it shall inspire, be known to live. Retir'd the Valley was from common View, By none frequented, known but to a few, Sylvio's best Friends, who thither us'd to go, Sometimes with him, and there joynt-Tears bestow. Belisa, and her Swain, who claim'd a share, By Love, and Friendship in the Pious Care, Were all his Company, and who alone, Best knew, and judg'd his Sorrow by their own. Yet for their own, tho they some ease could find, In vain they sought it for his troubled Mind. For still more restless that, and stubborn grew, And with the Day his Griefs did still renew. Clelia was all his thought, and with her Name, He so stirr'd up the yet encreasing Flame, That the thick Sighs, which from his Brest did go, Were but as Wind the glowing Coals to blow; And his exhausted Tears too late did prove, That Love alone, not they, could quench his love. And so he liv'd (if one a Life may call What was indeed but a long Funeral) Till as one Morning to the Grove he went, And to conclude the Ceremony meant, The Grove he found by a new Tree encreast, Whose sleeping Root seem'd laid in Clelias Brest. The sight amaz'd him, but when he drew near, And saw the Plant, how gay it did appear, His Clelia in the Plant the Shepherd spi'd, Nor could the strange disguise her Beauties hide. 'Twas a fair Bay, but so exactly shap'd, That it the perfect Form of Woman kept. Not as Philosophers feign'd Man to be, In their wild Resve'rys, an inverted Tree, But standing on its Root, and whose strait bole, Shew'd how great once, and gentile was her Soul. For if Souls can by th' Bodies frame be ghest, Of great the greatest she' had, of good the best. The beauties of her Bosom did appear, In swelling Knots that balmy perfumes bear. To Leaves her Hair was chang'd, to Boughs her Arms, Yet both retain'd their ancient Force and Charms. A jollier Tree than ever Daphne was, And much more worthy bright Apollos grace. For whatsoe're in Woman is admir'd, When in a Lovers chaste embrace retir'd, Was found in her, who did nor coyly flee, Nor court that Love, t'other was proud of when a Tree. Laura the Thuscan Poets brightest Flame, Laura, whom Verse has given a lasting Name, Which all but her own Vertues shall survive, Laura to be her Emblem does in Numbers live. Which as the mournful Sylvius view'd, he said, (Gathering some Leaves to bind about his Head, The Leaves to bind his Head bow'd gently down, And form'd themselves into a Laurel Crown) “Daphne, Apollos, Clelia was my Love, “Tho both turn'd Trees, with Fates unequal strove. “Unlike in Life, alike in Change they were, “A Mother this, a Virgin that severe: “O're whom till Plant, Phebus could not prevail, (Python He did with more Success assail.) “Yet as to her he did his Harp resign, “Clelia with no less Passion shall have mine. “Grow sacred Plant, the better Daphne be, “Iärmas and my Consecrated Tree! L'Envoy. Poor Pastoral, for simple Shepherd fit, Without or much of Art contriv'd, or Wit; Do as Thou mayst, the Curious City flie; Or if Thou thither chance to come, Conceal'd as the' Ashes, which Thou herriest lie, For whose dear sake alone, Thou dost thy Fortune try; Tho, like thy Master, Thou might'st safer be at Home. ODE. To Posthumus. Mortem Vitari non posse. Hor. l. 2. Ode 14. Time Posthu'mus scuds it with full Sail, Nor can thine honest Heart avail, A furrow'd Brow, Old Age at hand, Or Death unconquer'd to withstand; One long Night Shall hide this Light, From all our sight, And equal Death, Shall few Days hence stop every Breath. Tho thou whole Hecatombs shouldst bring. To' attone the' inexorable King, Who Geryon, and Tytius bold, In Chains of Stygian Waves does hold; He' ll not prize, But despise, Thy Sacrifice; Death thou must feel, 'Tis so decreed by th' fatal Wheel. The numerous Off-spring of the Earth, That feed on Her, who gave them Birth, Must have, each Birth its Funeral, The Womb, and Urn 's alike to all; Kings must Die, And as low lie, As thou and I; And though they have Atchievements here, there 's none ith' Grave. In vain we bloody Battels fly, And fear to sail, when Seas are high; Fear Plagues, or an Infectious Breath, When every Hour brings a new Death: Time will Mow What e're we Sow; Weal or Wo, Shall have an end; And this, tho' unwilling, Fates must send. Cocytus Lake thou must waft o're, Thy tattred Boat shall touch that Shore; Thou Sisyphus e're long must know, And into new Acquaintance grow: Shalt, with Life, Leave House and Wife, Thy Loves and Strife; And have no Tree, But the sad Cypress follow Thee. Mean while thine Heir shall nobly quaff, What thou with hundred Locks kepst safe; Cæcuban Wines, and wash the Floor, With Juice would make an Emperor poor: Doubt it not, 'Twill be thy lot, To be forgot, With all thy Deeds, E're he puts on his Mourning Weeds. Tho the Publisher has several Translations of his own, of some of the Moral Odes, &amp;c. of Horace so falsly Printed, that it would be but Justice to himself to give them a light review; yet having since their first Publication changed his Habit, he declines it wholly here; nor would have presumed on the Reader for Reprinting this, but that it is to do a greater piece of Justice to his long since deceased Father, b. m. Mr. R. W. and from himself, under whose Name it now goes, in that false Copy, return it to the right Owner. To Belisa. The Excellent Mrs. Mary Beal, upon her own Picture, done by her Self, like Pallas, but without any Arms, except Head-piece and Corselet. Such would the Learned Pallas chuse to be, With all the Charms of Nature and of Art, Tho she had neither Shield nor Dart: For if the mighty Pallas were like Thee, Without those, she to Conquer, need but come, and see. But here (alas!) the Goddess nothing can espy, Except the Garb to own her Figure by; The Warlike Dress, and that 's so Gay, Such Terror, and such Softness does display, That that as little as the Face she seems to know; Wishing that her own Greece had drawn her so: Says Fabulous Antiquity; Ne're gave her half that Grace or Majesty: That she was never half so Fair, In her own Beauties, or what'ere they feign'd, With such clear Limbs, or with so great a Mind, As in your Draught, Belisa, she's design'd: And were she to be Born again, Would from your Hand desire it rather than Joves Brain. 1664. To Clelia. On his own Picture done in Water-Colours, by the Learned Poet and Limner, Mr. Thomas Flatman, Fellow-Student with him, and Chamber-Fellow at the Inner Temple. Proof against Time, and Age, And Fortunes Batteries, and Wars out-rage; Able to Triumph o're the' Affright Of an Eternal Night, Of maigre Sickness, and the rotting Grave, When no Embalments else can save, But in themselves their own Consumption have. When Tombs and Epitaphs shall die, And in an heap as undistinguisht lie From the dry Bones, and Dust, Committed to their trust, In hopes of Immortality, As if they were themselves a Portion of the Rust; This Shadow, Clelia, shall preserve intire Those Reliques incorrupted, and unmixt; The very Air, and Fire, The active Youth your presence did inspire, And that bright Image of your Self it on me fixt. And tho one common Urn may possibly contain, (Tho not dispairing of return again) My Ashes, and a thousand more, Of such as shall be, or have gone before, Here's that will almost give Eternity, And next his Verse, who made the Draught ne're let me die. 1661. SOLITUDE. Rura laudamus merito, &amp;c. Cl. Abr. Coulei. The Country, as 'tis fit, we Poets praise, And there alone, like our gay Laurels thrive; Laurels, which in the Dust great Cities raise, And from their Sun conceal'd seem scarce to live. For Corn ith' Strand, or Cheap, will sooner grow, And self-rais'd Flowers throng'd Market-places Crown; Even Grass will sooner all its Lands forego, To become Burger in some Flint-pav'd Town: Than in the City midst its confus'd cries, A future Harvest of good Verse e're spring; Verse, that did ever hate the Cities Noise, And which few Soils to its just growth can bring. Rather my Life ith' Country let me spend, Thither withdrawn Dioclesian like in state; To th' Town my Envoy'e an Ode I'll send, And that's enough to' observe, and to relate. Hail! Beauteous City of the Winged Quire, Fair Trees, sweet Bowers, inviolable Woods; The Muses Kingdom, and where they retire, The Hampton Court of th' happy Gods. Let me repos'd within your hallow'd Shade, The Dances of soft-footed Zephyrs hear; And tir'd with the Disputes the Schools have made, Hark how by Leaves and Winds they manag'd are. View but the lusty Year, how 'it smiles and plays, When vigorous heat, through the gross matter hurld, Provokes to love, and the swell'd Womb does raise, Of the Adult and Marriageable World. A Summer-House here let me ever find, Where Nature the wise Architect may be; And who 'would prefer, that is in his right Mind, A smooth dead Beam to a rough living Tree? On an Hills flowry Bed, as there I lie, I'd listen how some Floods new married Streams, Laugh, and tell o're their Loves as they run by, Glittering in Light, and flam'd with liquid Gems. He, tho alone, who wants Employment here, With Life but labours, as an ill Disease; Or Prodigal of what most buy too dear, His Hours puts out to none, or the' worst increase. Blest Solitude! sacred Companion, Of God, and even Mankind, till Numbers tree, Rank springing up, and thick from the' Trunk of One, Still as in Arms, increast in Misery. 'Tis Thou, who like a skilful Chariotteer, The Minds wild Passions dextrously dost rein; Make'st them the Curb receive, approach more near, And in a straiter Tour their Course confine. 'Tis Thou its languid Heats, and fluid Rays, When by expansion ready to exspire, Collect'st again, as with a Burning-Glass, And hatchest to a new and brisker Fire. In vain, fond London, thy Eternal Spring, From whence a living Thames of People flows; London, in vain Thou dost Thy Pageants bring, And to my envy Thy rais'd Towers expose. For take but all Thy Gaudy Fools away And Vices large extended Family; A Village scarce of those, who after stay, Almost a Solitude Thou too wouldst be. 1668. The Voyage. ODE. I. As one, that's from a tedious Voyage come, And safe, through thousand Storms arriv'd at Home, Resolves to put to Sea no more, Or boldly tempt the flattering Main, How smooth so e're it lie, or plain, But having drawn his broken Hull ashore, To some kind Saint hangs up his Consecrated Oar: I, who as foul a Sea had past, The Ocean of rough Poesy, Where there so many Shipwrackt be, Or on the Rocks, or on the Quick-sand cast; Recounting what my self had seen, And in how many Deaths I 'had been, Where scarce an empty wish or hope could come between; With almost as confirm'd a Vow, Resolv'd no less to Consecrate Some votive Table, which might show The Labours I did undergo; And at a far more easie rate, Than I them bore a'-late, Give others the delight to view on Land my dangerous Fate. II. Already was the Sacred Plank design'd, And in it how I first assay'd the Deep; When thinking only near the Shores to keep, There rose a sudden, and tempestuous Wind, Which made me leave the unsaluted Land behind. The Sea before was calm, and still, And gentle Airs did with my Streamers play; Scarce strong enough my half struck Sail to fill, And through the yielding Chrystal force my way. Close by did many a Vessel Ride, Whose Pilots all, with Bays were Crown'd, And to the murmurs of the Tide, Voices and Mirth were heard around; My self made there Anacreon's Harp resound, Which, sprightly seem'd, and wondrous brave, And its old killing Notes to have, (which I gave. But from the Waters more, than those rough touches, 'Twould still of nothing sound but Love, Tho I the various stops did often prove; Wherefore new Loves I did begin, And intermixt as parts my own, Which took fresh vigour from the String, And o're the Dancing Floods were quickly blown. The Carthaginian Queen, I sang, and stolen Joys, And of his Flames, who 'scapt at Troys: And as the Thracian Orpheus by his Skill, To Ransom his Euridice is sed, And from the Shades bring back the Dead; My Song as great a Miracle did tell, And thither chain'd in Verse, alive Proserpina did lead. III. Such was my Song, but when the Storm arose, Voices, and Mirth were heard no more; But every Man fell stoutly to his Oar, And to the Floods all did their Strength oppose, Hoping to reach some Harbour, but in vain, They were with greater fury hurri'd back into the Main. No lays resounded, which might please, But dying Shrieks of such as Shipwrackt were; And those proud Galleys, which before, at ease, Plough'd up the Deep, no longer did appear; But to the Waves become a Prey, Some downright sank, some broken lay, And by the Billows were in Triumph born away. My Keell so many Leaks did spring, That all the Hold, with Water was flow'd o're; And a Sea no less dangerous rag'd within, Than that which strove abroad the Tempest to outroar. So Over-board my Lading straight I cast, With some faint hopes my Barque to save; But on the Wind away they quickly past, And my best Safety was no hopes to have. Yet by me still the great Jessean Lyre I kept, Which down I from my Bed did take, (Where it neglected too too long had slept) And all its numerous Chords I did awake; Thinking, since I the Waves must try, Them and the Sea-gods with a Song to pacifie. IV. I plaid, and boldly then plung'd down, Holding my Harp still in my Hand, My dear Companion in those Paths unknown, But hopeless with it e're to reach the Land; When lo! the Sage Eüarna (in my Song Iärma rightli'er stiled) with Nymphs and Tritons waited on, As she by chance there past along, Drove up her Chariot to my side; And in requital for my humble Song, Invited me with her to Ride, And fearless of the Way, with them my Course to guide. So down she reacht her Pearly Hand, And from the Floods me gently rais'd; Whilst all the Crowd upon me gaz'd, And waited, e're they further went, some new Command, Which straight She gave, and at Her Word the Wind, Backward did scour, before us smooth and plain The Ocean lay, Storms only rag'd behind; And to my Harp I turn'd again, No longer was I of the Deep afraid, But bolder grown, some Anthems plaid, And on them put my Chains, who theirs upon the Waves had laid. Till having many a Country past, And Coasting the whole Earth around, (The North-west passage Navigable found) I on my Native Shore was cast, And safely toucht the British Isle at last. V. This Table as in Colours 'twas exprest, And with Belisas curious Pencil wrought, With Ivy Garlands and Sea-holm I drest, And to my Muses sacred Temple brought, Hoping it would accepted be, And surely gain my Liberty, From future Service, and declare me free. But as I waiting in the Court did stand, Into a sudden Extasie I fell; And led by an Immortal Hand, Which entrance for me did Command, Approacht the Fanes most private Cell, By none e're seen before, where awful Dread, and Reverence dwell. 'Twas not like those strait Oratories here, Which we by that Name call, But a Magnifi'cent, and Stupendous Hall, The Roof with Paintings garnisht all, And where in Niches, on the Wall, There did the lively Forms appear, Of such who for their Verse the Laurel Sert did wear. Greece and old Rome possest the chiefest place, And all the upper Square on th' East their Quarter was. The sides were into several Coasts design'd, And by their Country you each Name might find. The Thuscan, French, and Spanish Band, And others more, as they did with their Titles stand. Britain as fair a space as any had, (The' whole Western Square) and tho the lowest laid, Had no less Honours to her, than to Rome and Athens paid. VI. Thither I turn'd mine Eye, and in the Throng Of Crowned Heads, translated there, Whose very Names to count would be too long, From Chaucer downwards, (tho some Ancienter there were) The fair Orinda did appear, And tho come thither last of all, Made the most Beauteous Figure on the sacred Wall. Aside her several Niches were prepar'd For those, who after her should come; (The mighty Cowley since has there obtain'd a Room, And Davenant as with her they in the Muses service shar'd) With other Names, which there I saw Enroll'd, And in bright Characters enchast; But who they were must not be told, Till they the fatal Stream have past, And after Death have here their Breathing Statues plac'd. My Muse alone those Worthys did out-shine, As she approacht me there in shape Divine, Her Golden Hair was all unbound With careless Art, and wantonly did play, Mov'd by her Strings harmonious sound, As on her Shoulders the loose Tresses lay. A wondrous Mantle on her Back was thrown, And her gay Mystic Vest below, In Royal State traild all adown; An Harp was in her Hand, and on her Head a Crown. VII. Amaz'd I at her Feet did fall, And Prostrate lay, till up she bid me stand, Saying, “For this I Thee did never call, “But boldly to receive my great Command. “Arise, for (Lo!) a better Fate “Does on Thy tuneful Numbers wait, “Than what Thou in the Deep hast tri'd of late; “Not but that all thy Labours there, “To Thine own Wish shall amply be repaid, (“How ever for a while delay'd) “For I, by whom enroll'd they are, “Second to none but Heav'n in that great care, “Which of Thy Verse and Thee I ever had, “Will look so large allowance for them shall be made, “And all the time Thou hast, or shalt have staid, “That the whole Damage, which Thou didst sustain, “Shall not compare with Thy Immortal Gain. VIII. “Witness Thy Table which I here accept, “Worthy for the' Hand design'd it to be kept, “Within my Archives a fair Room to have, “And Thy mean Name from dark Oblivion save; “Till to another Temple, that's above, “Thy Souls true Image I hereafter shall remove. “Where several, whom Thou here dost know, “Ambitious at their very Names to bow, “Leaving their wanton Strains behind, “And from all base alloy refin'd, “More to resemble the Eternal Mind, “With several, who were never here, (“So Godlike all their Numbers were) “As Heman, Ethan, Moises, and the Quire, “Of Jewish Psalmists, whom Heaven did inspire, “And Jesses Son, whose Harp thou late didst bear, “In Glory with the first Great Maker live, “And for your Mortal Bays, a Starry Diadem receive. IX. “But first, my Son, Thou 'again to Sea must go, “And many Towns, and Men, and Countries know, “In the new World of Heav'nly Poesy, “Part of which long since was design'd to be “The happy Fruits of thy Discovery; “Where none of all Thy Nation has been yet, “The Way so dangerous, and the Task so great; “Nor doubt, but it shall recompense thy cost, “And, were it more, that Age they cry thou hast lost, “When Thou didst Tibers City fly, “The dusty ruines of Antiquity, “And for my Service thy old Love to 'her Stones deny: “And later, since didst Laws, and the' Bar forsake, “And for the long Robe th' Ivy Garland take, “As that which would Thy Name Immortal make. “Much, I confess, much that alone can do, “Very much I, “But more my Elder Sister, Sage Theology, “Whom thou e're long shalt know, “And from my Service to attend her go: “Her to attend, but not renounce me utterly. “For I have Honours to bestow, “And endless Treasures, tho I rarely show “The happy Country where they grow. “And tho some Wretch the Plague endure, “Of Ridiculous Poverty, “The fault's his own, and not in me: “Not that he is my Votary, “But under that disguse to her an Enemy. “Not I, but they who count and make me so, are poor. X. “Try me this once, and once more tempt the Main! “Thou shalt not unattended go, “For when thou next putst forth to Sea again, “I'll be Thy Pilot, and the Passage show. “Nay, wonder not, for 'tis no more “Than what I several times have done before, “When Tasso I through unknown Straits did guide, “And made my Bartas o're the Surges ride, “And Collins sacred Mulla deifi'd. “Those Admi'rals of my Seas, which did extend “Their Countrys Bounds, and Savage Nations made attend “'Twas I Conducted them those Lands to find, “Where each did plant his Nations Colonies; “All spreading less their Sails than Victories, “And there are yet more Lands for thee behind, “Or to Discover, or Improve by a nobler kind. “Let's go, my Son, and all the way rehearse “The Birth of things, as they from Nothing rose, “By that Almighty Word, which shall inspire thy Verse, “And help Thee all its Wonders to disclose. “No Storm upon Thy Mast shall rest, “Nor any Blasts, but Vernal, blow; “The Sea it self to my great Service prest, “In plains of Liquid Diamond shall lie below, “And its obedience to my Rule in dancing Billows show. “And when thou Home return'd shalt be “And of thy Native Earth once more take hold, “My self thy Barque will Consecrated see, “And for this New World thus found out by Thee, “Make it an Heav'nly Sign, next that which sav'd the Old. “Or if this pleases not “Too long laid by, too long forgot, “And that thy Habit chang'd, thou changest thy design “Thy own be the free choice, the Conduct shall be mine. Made first 1666, and some time after review'd. Comiato. Song, that thou shouldst of all be understood, I little hope, and less design; Tho few there be who wish thy Masters good, And know him, but they something will divine: That Verse so early he began, Scarce will the Poet die before the Man. And that the boasts he makes of Bays, (The most that almost any of the Trade e're got, And happy he if this be his Lot) Is the thin Diet of an Airy Praise, On which he, like his Brethren, lives his Verse to raise. 1677.
