      <field name="fulltext">THE WANDERING BARD. PART FIRST. I. I saw the sun fast waking from his sleep, Thick gauzed o'er with clouds and shadows deep; The mists were curling thick around the head Of the great mountains, solemn, like the dead; Whilst, in the valleys, silver frost-work lay Glistening amid the early dreams of day. Hush! be ye still, ye sleepless sounds of Time! Chain all your tongues, ye cataracts sublime! Ye shepherds, peace! for lo! adown the hill Glides peacefully the Day: such glories fill The swelling of that fair and heavenly form! Is it the breath of God upon the storm? Is it the spirit of the mountain God?— Such stormy music from the grassy sod, Such gladness wheresoe'er his sounding feet have trod! Ah no! I dream—It is a peaceful light, Full of all beauties, that salutes my sight; A shroud of silver, a soft guileless eye, A stir of thoughts, upon the forehead high, A glow of sunlight on the grassy bed: Streams of divinest lustre clothe her head; And she is bright and good as are the sainted dead! What shall I call thee, thou intensest light? What name decree for one so madly bright? How tell thy looks, thy language?—thou art dumb! How count thy treasures to a simple sum? A mother, that hath wander'd from the sky To find the mound where her sweet babe doth lie; A murder'd virgin slain in vestal pride, Seeking her sleeping sister, thence to glide With savage eyes unto her murderer's bed, And glare with lightning curses of the dead; A sainted shape, from God's own throne sent down, Bearing the sceptre, and the queenly crown! How shall I do fit worship? give thy name Meet Immortality? and tell thy fame? For never, never, from mine aching eye, Shall this intense and solemn beauty die. I'll chant thy praise aloud, and in all time Shall fill the world thy memory sublime! Spirit of inspiration, agony Of rapturous dreams, that yet are nearest sky; Lightning of Poet's spirit, temper'd true, Calming the burning soul like honey dew; Angel creation, sent to steal away This dull perception to the perfect day! II. A wide, wide moor, and all alone! And the winter wind is cold and chill; And the damp, dark heather, and high crag stone, Of the holy moonlight take their fill. No scent is here of the flowering plain, No city sound, no voice of trees, No murmur of the woodland strain, No flow of stream or breeze. These hills are sacred to the storm, And voices of the wildest tone; And sacred to the rapturous form Of bard that walks alone! The moon she hath no spots of green, The stars no mirrors for their eyes, No raptures light the kindred scene Of glory from the skies: Yet joyous still the moorland tongue, The language solitude doth love; For here hath inspiration sung The joys that at her heart-strings move! Silence doth kindle heavenly lore, Each bird hath here an angel's wing, And music murmurs evermore, And makes the hill-tops ring. The stars, the moon, the heavenly blue, The marble path where angels tread, Bring ever feelings strange and new, Make music to the earthly dead: They waken memory's mouldering flames, They stir the heart to ancient days; Old voices speak, we hear old names, And seraphs warble heavenly lays. III. Ah! who is this amid the snow— The dews all frozen on his hair, Cold drops of ice upon his brow— That forehead bright and fair? His lips are trembling in the chill, His robes float streaming on the gale, And the wild voices of the hill Sound o'er him like a demon's wail: On the damp ground the form doth rest In the cold and frozen night, The wither'd leaves o'erstrew his breast In their careerings light. Poor youth, some sorrow wild is thine, Some canker at thy brain; Grief's chains of molten fire entwine Thy heart—thou second Cain! Thou wondrous shape, why linger here When frowns the winter cloud, For already I hear the storms rave near, And the hill-brooks thundering loud? Where are thy parents that long ago Did fondle thee upon their breast? Alas! if they could see thy wo In the grave they could not rest. That is no brow, so flush'd and wild, Where quiet peace in smiles may lie— Thy father weeps to see his child, Amid the songs on high! That quivering lip, why its unrest? Those large vein'd hands, why are they prest Above that heavily heaving breast As in dying agony? Like one who in a wilderness Where flower nor streamlet dwells, Long time he hopes some sight may bless, Of fragrant bloom, or spring that wells Sweet crystal drink from out the sand: But neither these, nor fruitful tree, Rejoice in all that barren land! So whither shall the wanderer flee? How doth he on the hot ground lie In piteous prayer lamenting loud! Like a worn child he sinks to die, And the white sand becomes his shroud: So hath this youth sunk down afraid By his great misery dismay'd! IV. “Arise, arise! if there be none To comfort this thy deadly wo; I even, like thee, depress'd and lone, With thee o'er these wild wastes will go, And soothe thee when the tempests blow. Awake, thou miserable boy! Let thy spirit awake to the touch of joy, Be thy heart stirr'd high once more; There yet are joys without alloy Shall clothe thee o'er and o'er. There yet are hopes thy soul shall know, Life's pleasant flowers are not yet dead, Thou'lt hear the joyful waters flow, And mountain winds shall fan thy head. The lofty lore of ancient men Shall greet thee in thy lonely bower, And magic of the wood and glen Wile every passing hour. Along the untroubled solitude Still stately beauty walks in pride, And love will smooth thy pathways rude, And sing thee to her side. What if the lady of thy love Hath scorn'd thee, and denied her smiles; Or if she walk the skies above Among the heavenly isles? Lament not—give thou scorn for scorn, Or tears, if that she be no more; Though storm to-night, to-morrow morn The sun will gladden every shore. Sweet lips will warble yet to come, Some gentle bosom proffer thee a home.” V. From underneath his even brow The shadow o'er his eyes was gone; In the clear air uprose he now, All pale as sculptured stone. Beauteous and strong he once had been, Among the mountains like a god, No place 'mong all these wilds I ween O'er which in joy he had not trod: He had felt the spell of a new delight, The swelling of the gladden'd breast, Loud joy as the winds rush'd by in might, With heather scent opprest; Great joy when the placid sunbeams lay Upon his stormy brow, And visions of the brighter day Shone fair as heaven's own bow. No earthly maid might hold her love From him when in the festal throng, So bright as if from heaven above A seraph moved along. Stately and proud the imaged thought, Which fancy to a maid hath brought, A maiden wanderer of the wood, Who in the solemn solitude With lofty dreams delights her soul. VI. Weep for your own beloved, ye mountains wild! Ye moors, ye rocks, ye caves, lament your child! Weep, for the joy of summer is laid low, The sound of music in the wavelets flow; The glory of the storms!—he had a voice As loud, and yet as sweet!—he could rejoice With breezes too that murmur by the flowers— With birds that gladden all the forest bowers! He had a heart, with Nature he was made Immortal as herself, whose mighty harp he play'd. VII. What wondrous spell doth sorrow bear, Whose armour is the sword and spear? She walks mail'd conqueror of a world, On which her death-plumes are unfurl'd. When she doth frown, Hope dies away, The sickening sun withholds his ray, The flowers all die, their fragrance fled, All founts of joy and thought unfed: Among the forests all glad echoes die, And in the grave at last her wearied children lie. The man of pride, the stately man, What is he when grief's tempests blow? He who through thousand storms hath ran Now bends him faint in tearful wo. Amid the chambers of the brain The waves of death in madness flow; Fancy lies dead in hopeless plain, And slacks her eagle bow. Grief's face is pale, her steps are slow, She ever dreads the crowded walk; By silent groves, where the streams flow, She mournful loves to stalk. Yet unto Melancholy calmed down, How graceful, then, in thy serene distress, Imagination wears a golden crown, And strews with heavenly flowers the wilderness. Unto the stars she rears her radiant brow, She gathers dreams from every passing thought, Along the heavens her sounding footsteps flow, And silver bells seem tinkling in her throat; All ditties murmur their divinest air, All voices find sweet echo in her breast, Spiritual shapes glide floating everywhere, And heavenly visions glimmer through her rest. This is the joy of grief; for melancholy Hath strains divine, born of her own fine ear; This is it makes her starry pathways holy, And cinctured round from every wandering fear. Now Liberty doth seek the wood-walks wild, The eddying storms, upon the hill-top born, Liberty, of broad heaven the charter'd child, Clothed in the robes of sunlight and the morn. Now doth sad lover fashion snow-white vision Of lady love still panted for in vain, But sent unto his soul in heavenly mission, Easing with seraph sounds his deadly pain. Now doth the chained slave behold afar His fields, his flocks, the children of his care, And hope triumphant shineth as a star Bright on his kindred and his pastures fair! “Now tell me, youth, how without dread Thou darest by night those hills of storm, Why on the cliff-stone rest thy head, On the damp heath thy form? What is the unmitigable wo That circles round thy beating brain? Say, what hath struck this cureless blow, This agonizing pain?” VIII. “I'll tell thee all—Long, long ago, Just learnt to dream, my father died, And in one year, oh, memory wild! My mother buried by his side. Long time is past; but yet I see The cold pale face I saw in death; The eyes once bright, now dark to me, Silent the gentle voice I heard Hymning like a bird. I treasure well the sound of prayer By a green grave side all wet with rain, A heavenly voice that fill'd the air, And slowly told me in my pain, ‘Thou ne'er mayst view the dead again.’ And one long night when restless sleep Wrought fever in my burning head, And all in vain I strove to weep In memory of the dead, A spirit came from heaven above, Her head all clothed in glory bright, Her eye serene with heavenly light, The lambent light of love. Her face so rapturously shone, That when at first the floating shade Came radiant o'er my drooping head, I was with fear undone.” Now morning rose upon the sky, The waters and the winds were still, Sleep ruled each peaceful cottage nigh, Each field, and grove, and hill: The mists upon the lake lay sleeping, And the dews still bow'd each blade of grass; And the lazy brooks their notes of weeping Chant dolefully as on they pass: In the clear waters calmly lie All shadows of flower, rock, and tree; For the mists unto their pastures fly, And the coral depths are free: In beauty streams the silken grass, And flowers that are the stars of earth, And birds of rainbow plumage pass Singing in love and mirth. What though bright love of human life Dwelleth not in the crystal deep, Nor cankering care, nor clanging strife, Disturbs the heavenly sleep? Those cottages, the sportive glee Of children by the green hill side, In the clear waves are mirror'd free As down the depths they glide. IX. Rejoice, ye glorious scenes, rejoice That not in vain your murmurs sound, That not in vain ye hold a voice Of power that clothes us round. Ye have no eye, or tongue of fear, Nor vainly shines your summer dress; The stars behold ye in their sphere, And the heavens love your forms to bless Far in their cavern'd wilderness. Lo! the soft echoes waken round Of bleating lamb and shepherd boy; From all the earth leaps forth the sound Of merriment and joy; Exultant from the dust starts up A spirit of the heavenly air,— The lark,—to swell her daily cup Of offering to the morning star! A thousand myriad hymns appear, Of voice and echo at heaven's gate, Glory seraphic soundeth in mine ear— Oh, never can it sate! Glad choristers that fragrantly do go Out from the yellow broom singing so sweet, How do I bless ye for the strains that flow Of love, like light, that clothes me to my feet! Sound yet the chords of your harmonious throats, Till Heaven and earth are drunk with your seraphic notes! X. Now through the joyful morn we moved along Through the thick broom, and by the forest steep, Till far away, large sycamores among, A snow-white cottage lit the foliage deep: The smoke made columns in the loving sky, The white walls glitter'd in morn's ruby light. How sweet a place, I thought, to live and die, To dream and wander through life's wintry night! Solemn the youth, meantime, stalk'd on his way, His brow, his eyes, clouded with mournful thought; He had no sunshine for his spirit's day, No objects round sweet contemplation brought; He seem'd a walking marble from the sand Of Egypt, thundering through the desert gloom, A miserable wanderer on the land, A spectre shape burst forth, and walking from the tomb. XI. Sudden he spake! “O bright, bright skies! O sunshine ever bright! How often have ye darken'd since I knew What glorious visitations died in night, Since here my flower most loved and cherish'd grew? The honey-bee's glad murmur fill'd my soul, Soft from those sycamores in ancient day, And o'er my charmed spirit wont to roll, Even as an angel's song, the blackbird's lay. And she would sing, whose voice was sweeter far Than all the birds that warble on the bough, Than all the marvels of the spheric jar— Where, where, breathe on those heavenly murmurs now? No more in sleep swift visions fire my head, No more the glorious hues of feeling fall Into my spirit, all their colours dead! And Joy hath put her on a funeral pall! I wont to feel a joyful bounding here, Here, at the heart, but that had fled away, And now the fiend Remorse, the spectre Fear, Watch ceaseless at its gates by night and day. I am a wither'd tree within a grove, Leafless and lost, all else in foliage strong, Where never come the ministering winds of love, Sunlight, fair blossoming, and the echoing song. XII. “Hark! did ye hear that horrible sound of dread? That ghostly shriek that from the door-way came? See, see, a bared and dishevel'd head, The garments all enwrapt in rolling flame: I, I have murder'd her, I have torn out The saintly life, forth from that blessed thing: I drove her down to hell, and put to rout The godlike shapes that round her wont to sing Virtues that her upheld, as doth an angel's wing.” XIII. This said, he threw him down upon the ground, As torn by bitter pangs of deadliest fear; As if he heard some agonizing sound, Some hideous shriek, still thundering in his ear. After long pause, at length with fixed gaze, And stern pale brow, the stately wanderer spake; More terrible wo ne'er sat in mortal face: A stricken god he seem'd by old Avernus' lake. XIV. “And wilt thou hear? Long, long ago, A beauteous phantom did appear; When first she came, I scarcely know, So swiftly glided by each year. Helpless and lone, an orphan she, From father's house condemn'd to dwell, No tender sound of brother's glee, For ever still love's marriage bell! And in our guardian's house we were alone; No marvel then the morn of heavenly love Sounded within our hearts her various tone, And lifted us unto the realms above. “She knew all birds by their strange carved note; Each flower she conn'd by its bright painted hue; And the sweet music warbling in her throat Fix'd on my beating heart the knowledge true. No lone and silent grot we did not know; No quaint inlacing of the summer trees; No shadow where the brooks made sweetest flow, No waterfall that wanton'd with the breeze. And her round brow was as a tablet fair, Whereon were written thoughts, like garlands wove; Within her eyes all books were written clear, And her sweet lips were full of heavenly love; Her hair was as a harp when the wind plays; Her neck was white as snow 'neath raven's wing; Her whole bright presence was a stream of rays, Fashion'd to shape, from where the seraphs sing; Her dimpled cheek the splendour of a dream; Her chin's fine curve might grace a godhead's bow; Her voice, as when by night the charmed stream Of moonlit Windermere's glad wavelets flow. And when she walk'd, what queen of ancient time, Lifting her feet to sound of silver bells, Ere walk'd like mine in beauty's pomp sublime, By mountain side, or where great ocean swells? No marvel then this heavenly shape I loved; A spiritual light clothed her whole frame; Where'er she breathed, where'er she moved A glory from the heavens came. Gazing on her, I saw no more The splendours of the earth and sky, The waves fell voiceless on the shore, The winds walk'd lyreless by. Around her beauteous breast the snow-god placed The holiest veil that wraps his inner shrine; O'er all her limbs devotional love had braced Garlanded brightness, tenderness divine— As vestal loved by godhead did she shine. XV. “Wo to the generations! ever wo, That love should be but as an ocean wave, A dismal cloud upon the heaven's bright brow, A burial chorus, sung o'er Pleasure's grave! Yet doth it shine, a diamond in the mine, A glow-worm by the gloom of mossy dell, One ray of sunlight where lone captives pine, One star that loveth aye some mountain well. But storms wake madly mid the pine trees tall, Chanting loud dirges of Æolian hymn; The thunder clouds their death-black plumes unroll, All the glad sunshine changed to darkness dim; And as some great vast oak tree of the plain, Its monarch arms, fruits, foliage, rolling down, Falls sudden down by the red lightning slain, So love's high sun-lit towers are ovorthrown. Not loosen'd star through heaven more swiftly flies, Not rays of light dart swifter from the sun, Not thunder sweeps across the lurid skies Faster, than love's high dreams from fond hearts run. XVI. “Through leagues of dreary wandering we must go, Who gain love's blushing bowers, far away; Through the black gloom entangling creepers grow, Whilst every poisonous herb pollutes the way. Vast savage beasts fright with their hideous yell; The owl and raven vex the weary sight; And frowning shapes obstruct, and spectres fell Glide stalkingly upon the hungry night. But, lo! the gorgeous temples, where they stand, What glorious visions burst upon the eye! In prime of youth, glows all the blushing land, Treasured with all the riches of the sky. There are no growing fears, nor vague desires, Nor dread, nor doubt, nor madness borne in vain; But, lifted on the clouds, love's heavenly fires, Brighten the sacred shrines of heart and brain. Bright blossoms clothe the trees with every hue; Notes of seraphic music fill the boughs; The birds, as rainbows gem the o'erarching blue, And tune accordance to love's holiest vows. Waters, divinely singing, flow along Amid the jassmine shades and laurel bowers, Whilst shining rocks, with precious stones made strong, Glow with the bloom of many-colour'd flowers. Here every creature sports in new delight; There is no bird or beast contemns his kind; No hope of blood guides the stern eagle's flight; The lion and the lamb no cause of hate can find. Oh, holy spot! fair pastures! breezes mild! Calm heaven! bright waters! music ever new! Here could I wander, innocent as a child, And to my dying day still love each peaceful hue. XVII. “Love is Religion's handmaid; on its brow Shine stars of heaven, and cinctured on her head Glow amaranthine blooms, and ever flow All round her sounds divine, that might awake the dead. XVIII. “Yet not for me, Love's bowers immortal shine; Oh! not for me, mad outcast, grovelling slave! The charms of woman never can be mine, Who soon must sink into the pitiless grave. All eyes glare on me with the laugh of scorn; Young children mock me as they stop their play; Yea, I am yell'd at, as at one forlorn, And men who meet me, drive me from their way. Oh! what a damnable thing, all this to bear, And be too dastard for the deed revenge! To be so ground to earth, that they should dare Torture, and not the murder-pangs avenge! Base, paltry slaves, whose foreheads sweat the mire, Whose loathsome life polluteth heaven's sweet air, Who sell their heart-wrung wretchedness for hire— Would that I had revenge, how happy should I fare! XIX. “Ay, there are Cains among us, and the flowers, And grass, and odorous altars cannot save; Like ghosts, they walk upon the midnight towers, And madly mock the terrors of the grave. Vile hypocrites, that on the house-tops pray; Murderers of prophets and of holy men; Base Judases, their Saviour to betray, And kings, whose argument is the lion's den. Why sleep the thunders? Why the earthquakes still? Where are the terrors of the mountain deep That boil'd of old, before the heavenly will? Where, as when holy angels shrunk for fear, By Lot's barr'd doors, sleeps the consuming fire? Hath bitter Pestilence no flaming spear? Hath all our mortal wo no spell that can inspire? Oh, for some more of that keen heavenly light, That burst of old on Sion's sacred hill! Oh, for some more of that effulgence bright, Of which the righteous prophets drank their fill, To guide reluctant man to God's Almighty will! “The rascal rabble, the base infidel mob, Would from God's altar tear the holy veil, The sacred fire from innermost shrine would rob! Already do I hear the angels wail At profanation they must needs behold. With swollen throats they dash upon their prey, Scatter the glories of the temples old, And drag the silver and the gold away. The white-hair'd priests lament the woeful sight; Fair choristers their hymns forget to sing; Dimm'd the rich shadows of the window light; Dead the loud organ's peal that seem'd an angel's wing! “Their heart's are roll'd in mire, to Mammon bow'd; They would erase the temples to the dust! Dead men with horror shudder in the shroud, And the thin grave grass trembles in the gust. What care they for their father's churchyard rest; What care they, sisters, brothers, lovers there? No holy pang can stir their rugged breast, Lift up their soul to reverential fear. The church bells have no charm, that long ago Merrily peal'd upon their wedding day; The dreams of love and youth forget to flow; The glories of old time have died in dust away. “Things, sacred as the mountains, now are naught; Time-honour'd custom hath dissolved her chain; From other lands ambition's dreams are caught, As various as the ever changeful main. Changed is the peasant's life, by his bright fire, Religion hath sunk down to party wars; There is no Bible read by gray-hair'd sire, Once morn and evening, steady as their stars. And hate for lofty heads is springing up; From princely brows men would tear off the crown; They hate the plenty of the rich man's cup, The heraldic glories hate, and would drag down; Ay, and the ancestral woods, and castles proud, They would erase; the sunny lawns destroy; They call the gardens Babylon, and yell loud As the glad chariots roll, laughingly in their joy. “Oh, for a voice loud as the stormy sea! To shout the people, of their madness vain, From such vain phantasies afar to flee, And turn to ancient memories again. In its own bed the river loveliest flows, Along its own flower'd banks and pastures green; Change harbingers a thousand coming woes, As various winds and clouds disturb the heaven serene.” PART SECOND. I. “Within a grotto, by the ancient wood, With my beloved at even-tide I lay: Soon must I leave this pleasant solitude, And to the distant city wend my way,” I said: “and though it sure will break my heart To leave those glorious landscapes for a time, And from thine own beloved self to part, Oh! there are other cliffs than these to climb, And other walks where brightest flow'rets grow, And blue bright skies than where yon bird doth soar, And other boundless space than this bright shining shore.” II. She bow'd her forehead down upon my breast, And her sweet eyes look'd upward into mine; Then softly murmur'd, as she closer prest— “But I, my love, for ever more am thine! Old Autumn hath put on his crown, and lo! The forest in her robe of thousand dyes; The stormy wind already 'gins to blow His chant unearthly where the pine-grove lies: But my love's autumn never can arrive! Like yon bright star thy memory still shall be; The dreams of every day of joy shall live, To fill my soul with steadfast love of thee! Thou art the bay wherein my shallop sleeps, Thou of my Bethlehem shinest calm the star; When I see thee, a rush of fondness sweeps All through my frame, knowing thou art not far. III. “But, oh! I feel, as if I never more— Never again shall view this blessed head! When thou returnest from the distant shore, I shall be slumbering with the silent dead. For, oh beloved! strange dreams disturb my night; And once I saw thee, dearest, wan and ill, Driven by a horrid spectre ghastly bright, With cutting sword, o'er river, field, and hill. No cliff so fearful where thou didst not go, No hot or cold too terrible for thee! And down thy limbs I saw the hot blood flow, And long, red wounds, most pitiful to see. Methought that thou hadst done some horrid deed, Some hideous thing that Heaven was wroth to hear; And this it was thy punishment decreed, That aye the murder'd ghost should haunt thy path of fear.” IV. I kiss'd her snow-white brow, I kiss'd her eyes; And, pointing upward to the evening star, “Sooner,” I said, “from yon embracing skies, From their enduring and immortal car, The beams of liquid light shall die away, Than shall this never-changing love decay. I swear by the great ocean, changing never; I swear by the high mountains borne sublime; I swear by the young moon, still young for ever, That this strong heart shall love thee through all time. Listen, ye glimmering stars, and hear my vow; Spirits that warm the evening, come and hear: These all are mine—this face, these eyes, this brow; And, when I cease to love, then come thou mournful bier!” V. Now fell the shadows over Ocean old, Each star-like ship and gaudy painted hull; And streamy pennant that in ether roll'd, Gave back the waves their colours beautiful. Sleep held the roaring giant by the throat, So sullen, like a dying Fiend he lay! Still, 'mong the trees, was every sweetest note, Each living creature knew departing day, And now chimed forth o'er heaven of stars the bright array. VI. “Mine own beloved, my beautiful,” I said, “Here must we part, my beautiful, my own! Still toward the heavens let shine this radiant head, These tresses hang their golden shadows down. The loveliest things of earth to thee will cling, And angels will weep o'er thee from the sky; Around thy brain all sounds divinest ring, And win to sights of heaven thy dreaming eye. No evil thing dare touch thy radiant feet, No savage creature venture in thy sight: Virtue by God's own footstool hath her seat, Throned in the splendour of the central light. And I will tell thee of the wondrous things That guide the passions of the many men; And every scroll, borne forth on love's swift wings, Shall also bear my heart into this glen.” Then caught I her unto my breaking heart, Whilst she, in floods of tears, dissolved lay: “And must we,” murmur'd she, “and must we part? And can I overlive this mournful day?” I heard her not—I kiss'd her more and more; And, whispering to her ear my last farewell, Then hurried fast unto the distant shore— This bosom then was pure as is a mountain well. VII. We parted, as at last all love must part, To the accursed city I did go!— I hear the heaving of her breaking heart, The panting of her agony of woe. Why, thou remorseless Heaven, not let me die? Why all these worlds of agony in vain? Why that o'erwhelming madness in her eye? Why her sweet spirit suffer such wild pain? The cataract rolls down the cliff unbound, The stars dart headlong from the heaven's brow, Storms soon will roar where the sweet wavelets sound— I am a madman now! We parted: but her eloquent language came From her own mountain dwelling, far away, Like honey-dew her music calm'd the flame That on my heart's high altar ever lay. And still my love's unceasing fire remain'd, Subduing, conquering every alien thought, But surely a fiend on my spirit wrought And planted there Doubt's poisonous spot; Ay, doubt of her, the angel, the supreme Spirit of Innocence, mine own true love— Doubt, for the perfect spirit of a dream— Doubt even for her, whom God sent from his realms above. VIII. Oh, doubt most poisonous! all my glories low! My high-wrought dreams, far lifted as a cloud, All these fine streams of feeling dried up now, These seekings far wrapt in oblivion's shroud! Thee, not the tramp of armed men can fright, The neighing steed, the clarion's sound of fear, The frown of kingly warriors in the fight, The cannon's thunder in thy stony ear! Thou, mid the star-light of the eloquent men, In the state's council like a serpent lies, Watching, as doth a tiger in his den, All voice of tongue, all language of the eyes! Thou whisperest to kings upon the throne; To saintly men in adoration bound; To lovers as they make their sorrowful moan, Hearing in every breeze thy jealous sound: Thou standest hidden on the mountain's height, Where patriots kneel unto the goddess born; Firing each bosom with thy ghostly light, And black'ning with thy shades fair freedom's morn: Upon the storms thou wand'rest through the air, On the glad sun-light doth thy visage gleam; No lone and beauteous spot but thou art there, But flows amid the flowers thy pestilential stream. No tie so dear but thy stern hand can break, No love so strong but thou can'st weave a spell; Beauty for thee no glories can awake To drive thee down unto thy native hell. Bear witness! witness bear, this way-worn breast, These languid steps, dim eyes — oh, witness bear! This burning head, that knows not where to rest, This spirit, blinded to all aspects fair, Bear witness to the wreck that has been done: Two broken hearts, a green grave worn away, Worn all away the monumental stone Whereon I kneel, lamenting night and day. Wonder not then I curse the heavenly will, A roaring, raving madman have become, Without a place, by forest, cavern, hill, Or grove, or stream, where I may find a home. Oh, when will these red fires within me die! Rain from the skies assuage this burning heat, That, like a hundred hells, all through me lie, Fierce burning from my brain unto my feet! IX. Amid the madd'ning Bacchanalian rout, Mid the ferocious stir of drunken glee, Mid the tumultuous song's delirious shout, Came the accursed doubt—Oh! how could she, Pure as the eternal star-light, false become? Had she not made this beating heart her home? Had she not in that sacred parting night, Beneath the approving moon's endearing light, Deign'd her great love to tell? What base and wretched monster then was I In madness deem that this all-golden hair, That cheek, like waking morn, that star-like eye, Those winged footsteps, and that bosom fair, Should from my yearning go— Should to another bosom true become! Sooner shall Ocean's thunders cease to flow; The ever faithful shore become their constant home! But sure some demon's madness drove me on, All on my heart the distant days had died! The hills, the streams, the woods' tumultuous song, The joys and musings of the ocean's side. My father's house was a sweet tale forgot; The Bible, ever read at even and morn; The field, the garden, every pleasant spot; The sycamore that sigh'd for my return: As a strange vision lay the midnight past, The shadow'd memories of my childhood days; These glorious dreams of youth all run to waste, All constant springs of love, all old familiar ways. 'Tis past'—tis past! but still the burning pain Gnaws steadfastly into my seared heart; A serpent eats all round my leaping brain, That never for a moment will depart. O sainted form, that dwells in heaven above! Oh, look in pity on my utter wo! Sound through my heart again that voice of love; All round me let thy soul's enchantment flow. Lean down that whitest forehead of the skies, And let me view again that angel face; The starry radiance of those gentle eyes, Each soft persuasion, and retiring grace. Celestial winds shall wave thy garments white, And lift the flowing of thy golden hair; All round about thee stream effulgent light, And scents immortal fill the burthen'd air. Then come to me, mine own eternal love, Sigh forth thy pardon to mine own still ear; Come from the heavenly palaces above, And dwell in peace with me, and be my constant dear! The earth is wide, my love, for thee and me; Spots of eternal verdure still bloom on; Still sings his hymns of glory the old Sea; Still sit the joyous Mountains on their throne: We will ascend them, love; we will rejoice, Proud, as of old, as singing on we go; The madd'ning birds shall catch our happy voice; Our hymns shall join the mountain brooklets' flow; Glory, and might, and power, shall greet us where we go. PART THIRD. I. She is not dead! Oh, say she is not dead! Have I not seen her floating o'er my head, Chanting high, holy hymns; and, on my brow, Breathed to my aching brain in murmurings low? I have beheld her in the rolling mist, Clothed in celestial garments; ay, and kiss'd Her heavenly eyelids—bending o'er my face. And, lo! in yonder dim and solemn place, Whither she wanders at the midnight hour, With rarest flowers, for her I've rear'd this bower. Oh! how had her sweet heart delighted been To see the splendour of this goodly scene! The soul's keen eye, sword pointed, gathers here Each various beauty that the thought can bear! The cataracts, that, thundering, rush along; The crystal brook; the forest's voiceless song; The swallow's evening flight the clouds among; The hyacinth beds, in fragrance spread about; The lambkin's bleat; the shepherd's joyous shout; The eternal mountains, where no foot hath trod,— All tell the might and majesty of God! II. And here I mournful wander, each long night, And madly kneel, amid the solemn light; Pray, my beloved, that thou, with gentle eye, Will breathe forgiveness from the throned sky; And, through the manifold glories o'er my head, Oft do I view, methinks, the radiant dead! The plaintive moon, amid the foliage, streams, And wakes to memory all my ancient dreams; The murmuring waterfall recalls again The happy times we never shall regain; The melody of Ocean, loud and strong, Thunders into our hearts its ancient song: Each wondrous thing I see brings back the day, That now lives only in this tongue of clay. III. Oft, oft, like streams of moonlight, in the glow Of the white silvery mists, her footsteps flow; She gladdens the black gloom; her walk is high Amid the worshipping clouds, that round her fly; Bright hosts of angel sisters, robed like her, Chant o'er her hymns of harp and dulcimer; And, in the quiet of the charmed storm, I have beheld her heaven-bearing form, And heard her voice in caves and among groves, And where the song of birds the woods symphonious moves. And yet she must be dead! Now never more Shines the Celestial Presence as of yore. Changed, changed to me, a madman—I became Crazed miserably—heart and brain of burning flame. Madness, the giant fiend, the accursed host Of Nightmare, Fear, and Death—the tempest-tost Shipwreck, upborne upon the perilous sea Of blacken'd dream—the terrible phantasy— The hideous thing—the unconnected throng Of shapes and faces wild, unnamed in song— The Fancy drown'd in ashes, waking never— The Imagination wrapt in tortures ever. What tongue can tell the pangs, beyond control, That sat, like Nightmare, on my burthen'd soul? The fires that burn'd like hell, the clinging weight That prest my spirit with a giant's might? All beauty wither'd, glories of earth and sky; Still every sound of joy—no solace nigh; No hope on wandering breeze—love in the sun,— The grandeur of the moon and the bright starlight gone. She whom I loved!—oh wither'd every grace And hue, and cloudless shape—no lingering trace Of her young beauty, brightening when she came: In scorpion locks, and eye of living flame, The skin of speckled white, dingy and dim, The skeleton head, and ulcerated limb! All love had fled away, and her foul kiss Breathed on my forehead like the serpent's hiss; Her voice fell shrieking, like the sea-bird's yell, And Hate lay brooding where sweet smiles did dwell; Now dwelt no more pure Truth upon her brow, But cruel Treachery's war; and never now Play'd the proud glow of Innocence on her cheek. How changed the virtuous—the pure—the meek! Oh, it was horrible! and my sickening blood Gurgled about my heart,—a bounding flood Sudden down dropping to a fathomless cave. Oh! how I yearn'd for the dead, silent grave To be my sure and everlasting home, Where Fancy's hideous shapings might not come! Mary! I cried, and a wild shrieking fell— Ten thousand thunders from the vaults of hell! Mary! and Echo, answering, yell'd him hoarse; And I was worse than mad; and the vast curse Of everlasting life seem'd to be mine! Then round my limbs her rotting arms would twine, And to my lips her colourless cheeks she prest, And held me tight unto her mouldering breast, And hymn'd death songs to me, and shut my eyes With her dead fingers, and pestiferous sighs Of piteous love breathed down my burning throat: And this she did whole days, repenting not. Thus, thus she came unto my loathing sight! Or was it some foul fiend, that, in black night, Had eat his way into her angel frame? Or dreams of dark affright—so foul, that name Cannot be given—so wild, so horrible— Like murderers when they see the fires of hell? The heavy darkness, and the clouds of day; The pale affright, that would not let me pray; The agony enduring; the huge weight, Crushing my aching breast the livelong night, So that I could not view the Sun, that shone so bright. IV. The dews of Heaven, that wet the orphan's hair, That calm the conflagration of despair, That sleep like tear-drops in the widow's eye, That cool the withering flowrets ere they die,— Why fell they not on me? But I was wild With grief and madness—heavily beguiled I was—undone—and damn'd—and utterly gone: I was an outcast—laugh'd at—scorn'd: and one Whose curse was that of Death,—to suffer, and alone. V. At length, methought, within a frozen cell, I was with chains, and stripes, condemn'd to dwell: Loud, hideous shriekings stunn'd my list'ning ear— Yells of despair, and agony, and fear. Was it a cavern from the rock?—a hold Of savage strength, and feudal pomp of old? And these the yellings of the hollow wind?— But why corroding bonds these faint limbs bind? And who this watcher? for what crime should I Be driven from earth's sweet sounds, and sunshine of the sky? VI. Not long I dreamt—my jailor told me all! I was a madman—this the Bedlam wall; These were Despair's loud groans—these shrieks the sway Of the untenanted mind, and mine were bad as they. Then did the jailor tell each woeful tale! One was a weeping orphan, worn and pale, Yet beautiful, as the moonlit night; And she would dream of ancient memories bright, And sing melodious songs her love had heard, In voice as sweet as of a dying bird. He was a gallant sailor, and the sea, And England's glory, knew the bold and free; He mid the thunders of the Nile had stood, The waters swollen with his warrior blood; And, when great Nelson at Trafalgar died, The brave, the beautiful, fell by his side. The murderous shot wing'd through him—he was dead, And the deep caves of Ocean were his bed. And there was one who shriek'd all night and day: Her eyes were blind with grief; and thus she lay, Her lifetime like a monumental stone; Her saithless lover from her side had gone, And from her brow was fled the starry gem Of Chastity's celestial diadem. The fragrance of the rose had died away, The garden's scent, the sunny blooms of May— The spell of beauty in pure virtue's eye, The wandering splendour of truth's morning sky. What! can the heavens behold such hellish thing, And not hurl vengeance down? Where the stars sing— Where the calm moon in holy slumbers shine— And where the blue sky bends—Vengeance divine, Storm, lightning, and the thunder terrible, Ready for Heaven's command, all armour'd dwell! Another was a warrior—great each word; His the all-conquering spear, the shield, the sword! He a proud hero was of ancient time— A throned king—a warrior god sublime! His plumes danced in the sun, his helmet bright Gleam'd mid the loudest thunders of the fight; And, to his ears, applauding millions sent Cloud-shattering plaudits, wheresoe'er he went. One was a mother, and she never spake, But like a bird, all wounded in the brake, She sigh'd her life away—a desert well Weeping in sleep; the flower that wont to dwell— One single flower its all, that now is dead— So wept she, her sole blossom withered. Others there were, each with his own strange tale: A dark hair'd youth, feeble, and sick, and pale; He swiftly journey'd to his latter end— She whom he loved had married to his friend. A man of pomp and pride, ambitious, vain, His darling hope undone, had crazed his brain: A tyrant, who, in dungeons buried deep, Had driven high minds their country's wrongs to weep: A villainous robber of the poor man's purse, Till stricken by a dying orphan's curse: A murderer, whom one he had deem'd dead, Madden'd at once, shaking his gory head! Cowards, by guns made mad; villains, by looks Of midnight ghosts; pale students by their books. Such are the miseries that high heaven doth see; The world beholds them not—its pleasures flee Far in the paths of air; and millions die, Seen only by the Omnipresent Eye. VII. But is she dead,—Mary beloved? the light Of the fair morn dark on her closed sight? Do grave-dews winnow through the rotting clay? Doth the breeze fan in vain the cheeks of day? Is her's the eternal shroud?—Say, is she part Of grim, old Death, pulseless her eloquent heart? 'Tis false as Hell!—they lie—the dastards lie! She, dropp'd from th' immortal Heavens, cannot die. What! head like hers, all golden—dim and dark? Barken and clotted?—her voice silent?—Hark! I hear it once again—solemn and sweet! No—'twas the breeze rating the craggy peak! Dead? dared they heap the dust, and I afar, And shroud the glory of heaven's brightest star? Blacken the splendour of the purest flower That ever lit with beauty forest bower? I never heard the church bell tolling low, The organ's burial peal, majestically slow, The moan of prayer over the sullen grave— The hymn that rolleth as the Ocean wave; I saw no virgins, in the summer day, All robed in white, bearing her form away; I never heard the rope, grating and dull, That folded her,—the bright, the beautiful! I saw no breaking hearts—I heard no groan, When she was laid beneath the cold grave stone. Mine own betrothed!—mine own in dying prayer!— They could not lay her in the sepulchre— They durst not bury her, and I afar! VIII. Yet, oh, I feel not her white hands in mine! I never view her polish'd forehead's shine! Strange words most unintelligibly flow From her low murmuring lips, that long ago I never heard her breathe—and her light tread, That touch'd, like gentlest dew, the harebell bed, Falls lighter, like the spectre-footed dead! Where sleep the glories that, like heavenly light, Smiled on her eyes, transcendent with delight? Where the immortal eloquence that lay, Melodious sunbeams, on her lips alway? The glow celestial, clothing all her face, Each look of radiant peace, each play of heavenborn grace? She comes not, when my yearning heart beats high, As pants the eagle for the summer sky; She comes not, when I call her from the cloud That folds her round like light—her spirit-shroud! Nor when in solemn glens I rush along, Chanting the memory of some ancient song, Which, had she heard, had brought her smiling near, And bound in wond'ring love her listening ear! In every place I seek her; where the storm Thunders through rocky caves, I seek her form; Each heather-scented moor, each wilder'd way, Where in her happy days she loved to stray! And when the mellow moonlight from above, Showers down upon the tombs in streams of love, I rush along; and through the abbey aisles Seek for the sunshine of her radiant smiles. Her gentle voice!—the threat'ning tempest hath No might to drive me from my steadfast path; Nor heaven, nor earth wield terrors to affright My constant yearning for her pathways bright! IX. Oh! come beloved! in heavenly mercy come, Here be thy rest—this broken heart thy home! Dost doubt my love? is't this doth cause thee stay? Oh! hear my misery groan'd through night and day! View me low weeping, whilst loud storms roll on, For thy sweet love, for peace and reason gone! By these hot tears, numerous as thunder rain, By Melancholy, hell-like—by the pain, The torture, and the madness I have borne, A wand'rer through Hope's starless heaven forlorn! By the remember'd hour of parting love, Come to me from thy starry throne above; Come, though a thousand blessed angels pray That thou in their celestial homes wilt stay; Come, though the enduring stars for ever shine On thee and thy bright sisters! Mary mine! Come, though the sun is warm, the moonlight clear; No snows to chill, no clouds to dim the air— Though hymns perpetual, of the lyre and voice, Bid the high-vaulted arch of Heaven rejoice! Though Sorrow hath no home, though Sin lies dead, And heav'nly glory clothes each sainted head, And amaranths immortal glow around, And fadeless pastures bloom, and holy waters sound; Come! and my love shall never more decay, Or wander from thy beauteous side away. X. And thou shalt be a queen: and thy sweet smile Will of its achings this sad heart beguile: Thy lustrous eyes, heralding Evening in, Shall to thyself all wand'ring visions win; Strong as its star, its glow-worm's eye of fire; And lauding thee, my voice still sounding higher, Shall chant immortal hymns! till thou become The poet's mountain shrine—the sacred home Of love-worn damsels, wand'ring by the moon; And where a true heart beats, there be thy throne. There's not a land, whereon warm sunbeams fall, But thy loud name shall sound through bower and hall! The woods shall hear thee, and each running brook, Shall know the changing raptures of thy look; Each dell, and mossy cave, and fairy place, Be glorified by thy celestial face. The Mermaids, where the coral caverns lay Wantoning in the sun's enlivening ray, As, gazing on the waves, they weave their song, And mutter dirges of their ancient wrong, Will stay their grief, and listen to the sound, And wonder where thy palace may be found! And they shall bring thee pearls, and make a crown Of gold and emeralds, to win thee down. The Fairies, sighing, o'er the dew-drops clear, Sweet hymns, that stay the storm in his career; And dance in robes that mock the milky way, Upon their knees, shall call on thee to stay. The Naiad Queen, amid her mossy bowers, Shall weep for thee to tend her emerald bowers; And as her subjects dance upon the green, And chant their silv'ry hymns, the pomp serene Of thy proud presence shall enchant their eyes, And shower new glory on their Paradise! Angels above will love thee, and their loss Forget—beholding, where thy footsteps pass, Thee worshipp'd everywhere; and see the trace Of their own glories mirror'd in thy face, The saintly love that lowly man doth swell, For those that in the heavenly regions dwell, The obeisance kneeling low, the sacred fear Of worshippers to their eternal sphere; And to thy praise our golden harps shall rise In strains celestial through the enraptured skies! XI. “She comes not! she will never come! and I Soon 'mid this wilderness of ways must die; For without her, what is the world to me, Its sun, and moon, and stars?—a shoreless sea, Whereon no bark, except my own, may be— A wilderness whereon no flow'ret blooms, To the dry winds showering its faint perfumes: A realm of citadel'd towers, where no one is, But I alone—a monarch subjectless. XII. “All old delightful dreams have lost their dyes, All lovely shapes have fled my weary eyes; Sunset hath lost his towers of golden light, And hues of glory, on the waters bright; Shadows of trees, and silence of the dead, And cloud-lands gorgeous visions, over head! The moon can light no more this earth-worn brain, And lift me up to heaven—her own domain. The stars they have no voice; the eternal shell Of the great rocks is still—earth's marriage-bell! Bound unto heaven by links of spheric tunes, And spiritual harmonies! I heedless view my old companions' ways, I heed not inspiration's heavenly lays, As when, by mountain sides' embowering grove, I read wild tales of knights and hapless love, Whilst on the page the chequering light would rove. Science hath lost her greatness—classic store, Traced with the pen of sunbeams, joys no more; The still small voice of solitude hath gone Into her own wild caverns—the death moan Of beauty's knell is past, her chain of fire Broken and scatter'd—and the celestial gyre Of heavenly virtues, swelling her spirit up, Hath fallen away from out my empty cup— Bright modesty, like moonlight on a tower, And all the gorgeous hues that gladden'd beauty's bower. XIII. “The winds that swell'd this bright life's swollen sail, Shriek o'er me, like the winter tempest's wail. Arouse thee, my sad heart! wake to the sky!— Again, my spirit! bare thine eagle eye!— Dare passion with her storms!—make thee a home On the sea-cliffs of thought!—again become A mammoth among men!—and let thy might Shroud all the lesser's glories!—let thy light, Like living fire, unfold her banners wide! Stir to the splendour of thy faded pride, And dash thy misery off, as garments worn! Alas! alas! but I am too forlorn, And faint, and feeble, and bow'd down to die, Ingulf'd in fires of fadeless agony!” PART FOURTH. I. “My God! whose throne is where the Thunders sleep— Is where the Storms their lofty watch towers keep— Is where, embowell'd, the hideous Earthquake lies, And Plague and Pestilence,—all that the skies On sorrowing man do hurl in madness down! Thou, Lord! who these can silence with a frown, And quiet with a smile, what hems thee round,— Oh, smile on me! and heal my heart's great wound; Shower down thy sunlight on my wintry brain, That I to happy days may journey forth again. The ocean roaring like a hell of fire, When human blood fattens the funeral pyre— The sea of mountains in his stormiest rage, Thou, stretching forth thy finger, canst assuage! The tempest, dragging down vast forests old, And shattering giant cliffs — when far unroll'd Thy banner streams of Peace—sinks down dismay'd, And sighs and sobs, unutterably afraid, Like wayward child astray by parent's anger sway'd! Thou canst stay mighty rivers in their course— Shackle the cataract on the rocky steep— Drive wrong into the dust, and scatter wide Sin's armour'd legions, in their pomp and pride; Whilst Virtue, brightening like a tower of flame, Beacons to all the earth thy lofty name, And, worshipping thee, a thousand valleys ring With the Hosannahs that thy children sing! Bear up the broken reed, and make it grow Strongly towards heaven again; and stir the flow Once more of healing streams about its root, For I am barren, and can bear no fruit: All other men go forth, their task to bear, Whilst I have no community to share! Though I can view no future to desire, No prospect glad, to wake life's lingering fire, Are not the dwellers of the savage place Happy, and the lone spots their footsteps trace? Do pleasure and love not stir each bird to sing, And wake the joy that through the woodlands ring? The leaves and blossoms greet the wanton wind— I only ne'er respond to what all else can find! II. “Yet I'm familiar with all wondrous forms— Spirits that guide the pathways of the storms, And shriek and yell along the ocean wave, With ghosts that moan beside the midnight grave! I know each star—for there my Mary is; Each sound I know of field and wilderness; There's not a mountain voice but I have heard; Nor river strong, nor brook, hath unknown word: And my beloved hath heard them—heard with me, Listen'd long days to hill-sounds; to the sea; The visible wonders of the starry sphere— The tempest, when the cliffs are shook with dread! Tranceless, beheld the rainbow over head; Laugh'd with the laughing waters; known the breeze In each diaphanous sound of flowers and trees; Studied each fertile valley's trooping sound, Whilst, in her breast, each voice a fitting echo found! III. “Dost know what's the Volcano? 'Tis a fire Vast, and of lightning heat, savage and dire, That shakes great mountains to their central heart, And eats and gnaws for ever—there's no part With sustenance, but the hungry fiend doth dwell, The bright and green-based mountains are his hell; And ever and anon, with hideous shower Of burning lights, he leaps to heaven's far tower, And mocks the god-like sun, and imitates his power! “Then with perpetual thunders, he will stay In terrible calm; then roaring on his prey, Scorch the white clouds, and bellow to the plain, And roll aloft his hearth-despising rain! Thou know'st Pompeii! Herculaneum, thou! With all your thousands in their pride laid low! Ye know who rear'd proud temples, who had wrought Divinest marbles, brightening out with thought; Ye know whose lords were slain, whose saintly men Were buried on their knees, praying in vain, Mother and child; ye know the hungry flame, And miserably died, your house and name! “Dost know what's a Volcano? I am one; This quivering flesh, scorch'd down unto the bone— This heart of burning fire—this blood that rose To glorious heights of passion, black with woes! The temples of my pride all dead, the light Of godlike genius sunk in endless night, And driven beneath the lava dust to die, For ever shut beneath the circling sky. IV. “I am as a dried river,—no fair bark Of hope, to glide upon my waters dark; No pennant gleams upon the laughing air; No star-light glimmering of the white sail fair; The silver bells, that on the clear waves lay, Have breathed their spiritual harmony away; Dead are the sunny flowers, that met the flow Their scent exhaled to heaven; and ceaseless now Of insects bright, the ever murmuring wing; And all the happy songs that the young breezes sing! “Now swells its joyful mountain heart no more, The voice melodious of the days of yore! Here never pilgrim bows his reverend head, Drinking refreshment from the crystal bed! No glowing wood-nymph, in the solstice heat, Softly reclining, laves her pearly feet, Nor bares her heavenly bosom to the breeze, Shrouding with her bright hair, lest wandering hunter sees! The pebbles smooth have lost their lustre bright; Dead the fair dwellers, clad in silver light; And the young loves, at evening's idle play, Cease on the warbling stream to chase their shallops gay. V. “Even like a hungry raven in the storm, That in the chasm'd rock, with shivering form That seems Remorse, glares on the cold black sky, And screams for bitter agony,—so am I. A wither'd flower upon a barren heath— A frighten'd bird, that sees the hand of death— A gibbet on the moor, where murder lies— A star thrust out from the relentless skies— A monument of wrong, and shame, and sin, No more within the light of hope to enter in! VI. “O, matchless maid! how had thy forehead high Rejoiced in ancient time!—how had thine eye Call'd forth the valour of the knights of old Amid the storms of war! thy footsteps bold, Queen-like, and proud, had made the chivalry, By the sea-shore, amid the forests free, Rush from their towering homes to win thy praise; And princes crowd thy shining paths, to gaze Upon thy peerless form in blank amaze! How many holy names had greeted thee From warriors' lips, till the eternal sea Spoke not such praises to the admiring shore! But Chivalry is dead, and Valour is no more! Now, 'mid the emblazon'd pomp, the proud and great Through perilous fears, no more love's smiles await; The forests bear no clang of warlike steed, No lofty emprize, no heroic deed; There are no fierce enchanters, castled strong, To work in midnight gloom their hellish wrong; No shapes perplexing on the ensanguined sky; No deeds of horror fright the day's bright eye; No fairy isles rejoice the emerald sea, Exultant with seraphic melody; No wanton mermaid, by the gray rocks seen Combing in glassy bay their locks of green, Seeking to wile with songs, and tear-drown'd eyes, Hands stretch'd beseechingly, and piteous sighs, Rearing white shoulders, and the bosoms move To win us to their melancholy love; No monstrous shape to slay; no conflict long To rescue spotless maid from brutal wrong; No chains to break, by fell enchantment bound, Fasten'd on valorous knight in slumber found. Romance hath fallen away, and Chivalry Hath lost its godlike hues; and from the sky All shapes that prophets saw are past and gone! Each glorious thing hath lost its various tone, And the glad dreams that erst rejoiced the sight Are sunk into the shades of endless night. The heavenly Una—the celestial maid— The daughter of a king, in dust is laid; Her white lamb dead, her righteous lion slain! The green sward ne'er shall bear her feet again; And Amoret, and Britomart, and Florimell, No more amid the enchanted forests dwell: All from the sacred groves have fled away, And the fair flowers are dead, where their sweet bodies lay! VII. “But thou art weary, for my griefs are dull— Thy heart is gay, thy loves are beautiful; And I sustain no sympathy with thee— Thy paths through all the world are wide and free. Thy earliest deeds are yet within thy breast, Thou hast to learn how I have been opprest— How I have been abused! come, then, thou breath Of bloated calumny—ye airs of death That smoulder ever,—come! ye ruffian crew Of my oppressors—yet can I war with you! And when I sink, still fall a conqueror! For the white grave flowers cannot tremble more, The worms they have no stings, the dews no hate, The coffin boards no need to war with Fate; And I do know that yet this spirit will soar To dwell at God's right hand for evermore.” VIII. He was not made for Love's tumultuous life, For the enduring of the world's mad strife; His proper home was joy—in this bright sun Alone he lived; this past—his day was done. A rainbow glimmering on the spray-wrought wave, Which the storms kill—sweet violets on a grave, Which the cold frostworks nip—swift shades on braes, Which the clouds dim—all that night slays— The Wonder of the northern heavens—the bliss Of holy union,—such, alas! was his! IX. Oh! there are griefs that, fastening on the heart, No might can tear away, no violence part! But as a mighty serpent, that doth hold Some helpless breast in its relentless fold, And, till the fluttering ties of life are gone, Gurgles the heart's blood as it rippleth down. X. A broken heart!—what terrible memories crowd At that sad sound—life chronicled aloud. A broken heart? it is a castle old, Its days of grandeur o'er, its glories told! The large halls desolate—the sounding floor To festal merriment stirr'd up no more! No wreathed dance, swift-borne to martial tread— In each glad bower the silence of the dead— Forgetfulness, oblivion, partners led! The lute's lascivious note, the harp string's thrill, The lofty lady's voice, the player's skill, The winning eloquence of gay cavalier, Breathed as the west wind to the listener's ear, The war steed's stately tramp, the vassal swarms, The sword's swift lightning, war's up-stirr'd alarms, The victor's proud return, whilst flowers beneath Strew all the ground, and beautify his path, And white hand beckoning on the turret towers, And laurels falling in perpetual showers,— All these are dead—these are the lights of youth Ere years have come, with their engender'd ruth. XI. These all are gone! each sound, each sight hath died! Beauty lies sleeping by stern Valour's side; The minstrelsy is dumb, broken the spear, Rusted the conquering sword and helmet clear. For lady's songs, the hoarse winds through the arch At midnight do their plumed battalions march; Time hath beat down the warrior, and on high Rules in his rusty armour, where the sigh Breathed hottest love, the bat doth weave his flight, And ghosts perplex the pathways of old night; The garden bowers are broken, the streams gone, The picture's face defaced, and wild winds moan Through niche unfill'd, where marble statues shone; Death and oblivion rule, the shrieking wail Of desolation thunders on the gale; Old Time lifts up his spear, he reigns sole king, And shadowing all the past, floats far his conquering wing! XII. The heart grief-broken!—'tis a riven cloud Where sunlight will not dwell—it is a shroud Where rottenness is folded—'tis a tree Worn by great storms where verdure cannot be— A hollow in a rock—a stranded wreck— A shatter'd beach, where constant billows break! XIII. Already he was dying—the black cloud Was closing over him—death's funeral shroud— The mists were filming on his radiant eye, The sepulchre's damps lay on his forehead high. How should I save him? shone the blooming place Beloved of old, where glow'd health's blooming face?— The glory infinite of the everlasting hills Might rouse him, murmuring with a thousand rills, And bring his soul's old dreams: So we moved on, Teaching our hearts each loveliest spot to scan, Each solitude remote from foot of man! Divinest aspect of each pleasant place, The holiest lines that Nature loves to trace, The brightest smiles that beautify her face. PART FIFTH. I. How do I love thee, Westmoreland! long, long I had beheld thee through the Halls of Song; I knew that glorious minds sprung up like flowers Of bloom Immortal, 'mid thy woods and bowers; I knew each lofty mountain, wood, and vale, Was sanctified by some undying tale; I knew thy lakes sublime, thy mountains high, That tower'd unto the temples of the sky: But when I saw, how higher didst thou seem, How loftier far than loftiest thought could dream: Thou wert another world—thy mountains high, Thy fields, woods, walks, each sight that fill'd the eye, Streams, rivers, lakes, lawns, hedgerows, every place, Each beauteous hue that shone on Nature's face, Was grander than I deem'd—I was enwrapt In visions beatific. II. How did I grieve the long years past away, Thee having not beheld!—the many a day Long past, whilst gentlest winds and waves flow'd on, I listen'd not unto their sky-borne song, Nor heard the mountain music, nor the joy That the winds murmur forth without alloy! Echo till now was but a tuneless jar, The thunder meaningless that roll'd afar; The setting sun was new—such light divine In golden towers than on the hill tops shine: His splendours on the waters—the great mood He exerciseth over rock and wood, The grandeur on the cliffs, the gorgeous hue Of rainbows that great cataracts embue: The moon, she was divine! and ne'er did seem Vision so holy, such enraptured dream! I could not gaze for joy—I was a child Stricken to tears—it made my spirit wild: All objects rose refresh'd with dews divine, And the glad heart-strings swell'd exalted as with wine. III. Thee, Windermere, with undecaying love, Till life's last sands unto the lowest move, This beating heart shall hold! Exultant pride, I feel that I have wander'd by thy side; For in my dreams thou'lt come, and 'mid the care Of the great world, wilt smile thy visage fair. Thy melodies upon my soul will fall, Thy bays, thine islands, these enchantments all— All that the lavish hand of God can pour On this sad earth! Thine is a lofty tower For inspiration's watch; there is no spell To dim the splendour inextinguishable. Madness might moan delight, Remorse decay, And Grief's black clouds awake to brighest day,— Religion be a martyr as of yore, And rear her standard proud to float for evermore. IV. What though thou calmly in thy passion lie, Bright as a fallen daughter of the sky? What though close round thee swell not mountains high, Though to the ear by moonlight comes no sound Of cataracts that o'er the rocks resound, And waterfalls that laughingly rebound? Thou shin'st with moss-floor'd bays where Naiads sleep, And the broad water flowers their green tents keep. Embowering woods thou hast, where, sailing by, We hear all sweetest sounds that fill the sky; And emerald islands, singing 'mid the waves, Where still, for empire, the serene lake braves The haughty earth; and thou art full Of heaven's continual changes, beautiful; And thou hast places where the warm winds dwell, To flout thy snow: white sails innumerable, And spots of joy and grief, where the proud river First seeks thy lovely breast, then loses it for ever. V. How many a long and idle summer day, O'er thee my boat hath won her languid way; Whilst, half asleep, I dream'd away the hours, With Nature's lyre, amid thine island bowers; And long, long nights, when every eye was dim, Entranced, listening, learn'd thy various hymn, Thy changeful shadows of the earth and sky, Which the rich moon down shadow'd from on high; And, as thy waters murmur'd in mine ear, Methought I wander'd in another sphere,— Such holy stillness, such untroubled calm, Sights beatific, sounds of heavenly balm! VI. And I would speak of one beloved place, Where dwelleth Genius! Nature's every grace Is shower'd profusely; and she loves to come, Richly embroider'd making her best home. Sweet spot! the broad lake's wanderings softly weave, And sounds of sweetest joy delight the eve; Far through the gloom, the mountains, wave-like, steep, The eagles on their towering dwellings sleep,— Woods, such as loved Diana, when, of old, The huntress nymphs swept forth, in beauty bold, And slew the deer; and fields and pastures wide; Fair halls, where Beauty dreams, and where divide Bright streams, the hollows of the giant hill, And places sacred made, where Genius hath her fill. VII. I view the tower of Bowness, snowy white, Gleams like a swan within the waters bright; And streamy pennants flutter in the air, Of vessels that adorn the waters fair; Sounds of the flute and bugle, and the clear Songs of sweet voices in the chamber'd ear. The tempests dare not harm thee as they flow; Amid thy bowers no hideous shape may go; Joy fills thy chambers—sitteth at thy gate, And ministering winds each sweetest sound await. Thine are all treasures of the night and day— Heaven's gentlest looks are thine, beloved Elleray! VIII. And he, thy lord, in early youth, cared nought For cloud or storm; and mountain toil but brought Around him rest for his too vivid thought; He moved as a young eagle, and his eyes, Burning with life, shone, fearless of the skies; The mountains were his joy, and the black gloom Oft by his white tent kindled with delight, For they his palace were through many a day and night. They were thine own, for they were part of thee,— Their cataracts thy harp-strings; thou wert free To house amid their storms; the hill fox came And crouch'd before thee, soothed down and tame; The wild high voices stay'd when thou wert there; Thou wast a Sovereign Ruler; bright and fair, Dropt from the clouds; and thou wert strong, and bright, And godlike in thy bearing—with the light Sublime of genius filling thee with might. IX. Oh! to have walk'd with thee, when thou wert young, And the fresh breezes through thy long hair sung, And thy glad voice awoke the sounding earth, Birds, bees, and blossoms, to responding mirth! From thy lips' music I had never gone, From where thy star-like form sublimely shone, But by thy eloquent side had learn'd to know Where her divinest sounds Nature rejoiced to show. X. Years now have gather'd o'er thee, but the light Of thy strong youth still lives: never can might Obscure those stately limbs, that starry soul— O'er thy immortal deeds its billows roll! And wheresoe'er thou walk'st, in bower and hall, Fame hath gone with thee, coming at thy call. Years now have gather'd o'er thee, but thine eye Is steady, as of yore, as pure thy forehead high! And God hath made within thy woods to grow Fair spots, that still shall bloom when thou art low, Strong pillars of thy house, that brightly stand, Beauty divinest, over all the land— Beauty celestial, that, in times of old, Had brought their feet a hundred warriors bold— Had fill'd the forest depths with lofty dreams, And rear'd a new starr'd heaven, themselves the themes! And even in changed years!—but I must stay, Entranced and dazzled by too strong a ray. XI. He died! and wailing youths and maidens near, Wept the dead lover to his sepulchre. They laid him underneath the same carved stone Which guarded the sad damsel who was gone— A savage place! Mountains as black as night, Stretch'd all around, stood frowning in the light, Their pinnacled crags far lifted from the power Of climbing tree, meek moss, and wilder'd flower, And taught from chaos solely to resound Backward the thunder and the tempest's sound, So wildly high were they that the church bell Ne'er heard its Sabbath voice, but in the dell Fainted away into its own “Farewell!” In this deep dell they laid him, where the wind Maketh continual moan through vaults that bind,— Where the vast abbey towers into the sky Old carved heads of monks in arches high; And on his grave, through the thin ancient yew, Falleth perpetually the various hue In the sun's shine of the old painted glass. The infant God, the Virgin, and the mass, Christ's agony, strange miracles, the doubt Of Thomas, and sweet Moses' finding out. XII. He died, the Wandering Bard, in grief he died, A solitary man, and by the side Of her whom he had loved, they laid him down. The tyranny of Death could never drown Affection deep like theirs—and well beseem'd The same fair grave-flowers that together gleam'd O'er both alike—the same brief epitaph, Whose solemn wo the silent moonbeams quaff; The angels' wings wide stretch'd—the open book, And sculptured quaint device—and holy look, And breathing calm of monumental stone— And all the wonders of that churchyard lone. Yet are they not all dead; and though we grieve For that which is the dust, still do they live, Holy and beautiful, in all their power; High, like a star on memory's guarded tower, Twin spirits do they dwell; and all the night, And all the day, wait in their robes of light. The winds do touch them not with their low moan, Quietly gleams the battlemented stone, Untouch'd by cloud or storm; and but the sun Of holiest love in playful streams doth run, Of lambent light, gold-ring'd, above their head, Clothing, with heavenly robes, the spiritual dead! They are not dead: in gentlest song and hymn, Young maidens tell their woes, in moonlight dim, And the sun's glare; and most on winter eve, When the wild winds among the pine trees grieve, A lone and melancholy strain will come From loveliest cottages, that have their home Among the moors; and tale, and madrigal, And pity-laden sighs, and the tears fall, (Given by kind heaven, the children of the eye,) Proclaim the healing love of memory. And many a day, when kingdoms, on the wane, Are tottering down—and the destructive reign Of Tyranny declines—and raging War, With its loud pomp of fear, is heard afar, Still will this hapless pair remember'd be!— Continuous in sound, as is the sea, Be heard Compassion's voice, and on the hill Aloft of Memory, will they flourish still! MISCELLANEOUS POEMS. LINES WRITTEN NEAR A WATERFALL. Loney I here repose; the birchen tree, Like a proud lady, waves her tresses long; This sovereign oak's proud beauties flutter free, Singing sweet undersong; Like a dead giant, Silence lone doth brood, Her banners black unfurl'd on all the solitude. My heart is sick, for I have much to weep— I weep, because so little I have done; The burning years of youth all sunk to sleep, And yet no Trophy won; My yearnings all in vain—my soarings high Hurl'd down into the dust, that late had touch'd the sky. I weep, because my heart is growing gray! And yet, methinks, I am too young for care; My feelings, passions, thoughts, all sunk away, All life's illusions fair; And here I rot, a wither'd leaf of spring, Whilst all the forest trees are bright and blossoming. I weep, because my harp-strings have no song; There glows no Memnon for the sunlight now; The oracle inspired hath lost her tongue, Persuasion's eloquent flow. Oh! had my time, my feelings waste, my thought, Chimed with my sounding harp, what garlands I had wrought! I have had friends—the beautiful, the brave— Ye dead, bear witness! they are now no more! Mine earliest love is rotting in the grave, Beneath yon ruins hoar! Hope's rainbow hues are dead, her voice asleep, Her faithful champion's slain, and therefore do I weep. Yet more lament I griefs that are not mine! New times have fallen upon old England's fields; No sacred light illumes the inner shrine; No sword the patriot wields! Black clouds of death on the high mountains curl— Rear up the oriflamme, the blood red flag unfurl. There is no Curtius now, to save the state, Ingulf'd with all his heavenly armour on; No Cincinnatus, in his cottage great; No Tell—no Washington; No God to save, though wax'd the oppressor more; The Tyrant, many-mouth'd, yells at our very door! Oh! where is there a pilot in this storm, To scare the Tyrant minions from the throne? Is there, throughout the land, no terrible form, To hurl the traitors down? Shall fire consume our halls, blood stain our hearth, And yet no warrior forth, to hunt them from the earth? Thou Waterfall! so brightly flashing by, Forgive me, that harsh thoughts disturb thy sound! Thou only know'st these shadows, and the sky, These solitudes profound! But when I see even lofty names so vain Worshipping unknown gods, how can I then refrain? O Nature! were thy face but better known, Thy language felt more widely through the earth, Less frequent wouldst thou hear the sigh and moan Amid the general mirth; Thou wouldst become a Temple, where we all, Forgetting each his woes, unto thy God would call. Thou Waterfall! the winds delight in thee; The stag starts up to hear thy mellow voice; And the dried leaves, that haunt thy pinions free, Thou makest to rejoice! Oh, ever could I dream the eventide, And, with exulting heart, behold thy waters glide! This ancient bridge, sure it must feel delight, So long rejoicing on thy pathway fair; And this white house must glory in the light, Glimmering every where: No flower that haunts thy wave, no silver'd moss, No pebble, but hath joy where thy glad footsteps pass. Thou Waterfall! when I am far away, I shall behold thee in the heavens of dream; And I will brood o'er what I felt this day— Thee for my theme; And I will strive to mould my future life As pure, as clear as thou, and as devoid of strife.
