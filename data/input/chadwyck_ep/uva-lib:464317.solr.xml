      <field name="fulltext">To his Honoured Friend Mr. HENRY LAWES, Upon his Annual Book of AYRES. Brave Lavves! Thou art Return'd again: the Sun And You do thus your Emulous Courses Run. And whiles you both in different Orbes appear, He onely Makes, but Thou dost Crown the Year. That if the Old Philosophy were true, What his Spent Fires could not, thy Lyre would doe; Make Old Time Vigorous still, confessing more Thy Fam'd Layes now, then all his Beams before. Nature her self should thus thy Learn'd Aid crave, From whose Stockt Brain all that we have, we have. Whose Yearly Spendings Shew, not wast thy Store, Who after Numerous Births can yet give more. Still whole, Unspent that when the Year doth cease (As Ãgypt Nile's) We wait thy Next Encrease. Then High, and Rich as He Thou Flow'st: We see What all else cannot, and what Thou can'st be. And till We pass the Spheres, must still attend, To know what Height Musick hath yet t'ascend. For Thou Grasp'st all; We the rude Matter give, Thou into Verse breath'st Soul, and bid'st it Live. Endu'st it with that Plastick Pow'r to Spring What Thou would'st have it, This, That, any Thing. Dost in thy Mould our Wit new Shape, and Cast, Giv'st it New Salt, the Haut Goust, and Rich Tast. It Lives with us, doth Flourish in thy Ayre, Born from our Brains, but Educated there. Things that from us flat and insipid flow, Voic'd once by Thee, straight into Raptures grow. When from her Mine Invention Fancy brings, Thy composition a New Fancy Springs. Thus whiles all comes Exact, Watch'd, Humour'd, Hit, Thy Ayre's Ingenous, and makes Musick Wit. Nor dost Thou, Narrow, only dwell among The Easie Rhimes of thine own Time, and Tongue: Thy Reaching, Vent'ring Soul doth Wit pursue Setting of Anacreon's Odes.Thorough all Languages, and all times too; That which some Twenty Ages since first grew, Thou Retriv'st now, and we admire as New. Compar'st and tri'st how th'Ancient Pipes will sound, Mak'st Old with stronger by the New Rebound: Who are, and who are not, Obliged bee, Poet, and Poetry it self to thee. What She suggests comes a mishapen Birth, Till Thou step'st in, and thence strik'st Musick forth. Admired Lavves! thy Happy Ayres have knit Eternall Leagues 'twixt Harmony and wit: Which none but those thy Richer Robes will know, When she keeps State, or would in Triumph go. We drink in Thousand Pleasures from One Song, Which Charms us all, the Learned and the Throng. We are Transported, Lost! thy Notes betray, Drop on the Sense, and melt us quite away. And when we're Extasy'd, Expiring, then Thy Next Note Wooes, and calls us back agen. At once Thou Steal'st, and can'st invade us too, Straight Rouze those pow'rs which were all Lodg'd but now. Thou like some Mighty Monarch dost controul, Dispence, Rule, Work, and Reign o're all the Soul. Thou shoot'st New Beings: For we are no more, When we hear Thee, that which we were before. But as that Begger who in's Raving Fits, Got Crowns and Scepters when he lost his Wits; Cur'd, and himself again, Griev'd straight to pass Into that poor, shrunk Nothing that he was: So when thy Strains Feast our low Fancies high, We Trample Earth, and Mounting, Knock the Sky. But when They cease, All Mourn that we have lost Those Tow'ring Thoughts our then Rapt Souls engross'd. Thou, like a Generall Influence, Sway'st in All, Dost Touch the Mind, and her glad Motions call. Whiles We our Constant Acclamations bring To the still New Choice Graces that You Sing. Thus dost Thou Govern all (Harmonious Soul!) And through the Great whole Orbe of Musick Rowl. Break'st from thy Self, Scatt'ring Day every where, Not leaving one Dark Part in all the Sphere. All Native, Genuine, and Unborrow'd streams, The Sun and Lavves know not to Owe their Beams. Who on the Wings Thou Imp'st Verse with, hast Spread Thy Fame far as the Roman Eagle fled. Those Judging Few who can Compare, admire, And find Thine Match the best Italian Lyre; Thou still Stand'st High; thy Rules so True, Severe! All by thy Card, Thou by thine Own dost steere. Like the First Mover, Uncontrol'd dost Move, (He which makes peace, Turnes, and Tunes all Above.) Even, and Just as he: whiles all doth shew What Harmony, that is, what Lavves can do. And such! so Full! so Mighty is thy Vein, Thou hast scarce Thought when all flowes from thy Brain. As Things first met in the Creation, All, Doth of it self straight into Concord fall; Which issuing free as Springing Light from th'Morn, Shews Thee Musician, like the Poet Born. You Two do Wing it still in Noble Flights, Strive, Stretch, Mount, Soar, Match, and vie Heights with Heights. And we the while Admiring, doubtfull stand, Which shall at last the Bravest Place command. With Words and Ayres our Ears are doubly fed, What e're thou set'st is at once Sung and sed. Thou dost still Apt, Complying Notes dispense, True to the Words, but truer to the sense. The Tunes Rehearse: no Crowd of Graces throng, And Justle all the Words out of the Song. But are so scatter'd here, and there, so sowne, It hath them all, and yet is vex'd with None. Thy Jewels with such Art are plac'd and worne, That they ne'r Cloud the part they should adorne. Thus doth thy Equall Skill not more delight, To do thy Self, then do the Poet Right. Thou Maim'st not him to come forth Conquerour, Thine, Steales none o'th Bullion when it adds the Coin. No tedious, long, deviding tricks betray His sense; and vapour all his Words away. Yet when a Word comes fit t'Espouze a Grace. Thou marri'st both, and know'st the Rites, and place. Then Fancy humour'd shews the guilded Beam, That Glitt'ring Plays, and Quavers on the stream. Both Close, and Kind as Life and Spirit sit, Thy Ayres still Quicken, never stifle Wit. And as One Dram of Gold can ne'r be lost, Though in a Thousand Fires Try'd, Vex'd, and Forc'd, Dissolv'd, mix'd with all Elements, we see, Expans'd to Infinite, what was will Bee. So with the same Entireness Numbers do, From all thy Artfull Compositions flow. Which though through all thy Flats and Sharps express'd In thy Rich Notes, and various humours dress'd. Are still the same: if any Change appear, Stamp'd now by Thee, they'r better than they were. Where Words, Sense, Tunes Embrace, so Kiss, Twist Hit, Thy whole Age hath not lost One Grain of Wit. Go on Great Master of thy Art! Strike dumb, And with thy Tones Calm the Tempestuous Drum. Tune, Recollect, Please, and reform us; Thine, Come at once Musick too, and Discipline. Let thy soft Notes invite us, slide, and Steal, Rock this Frow'rd Age, and with their Balsam Heal. Shew all the Miracles thy voice can do, Our Orpheus and our Ãsculapius too. And when these Revolutions make thy Shine Compleat, and Thou hast woave thy great Designe: Hush'd all our Noise, spread Calms made all serene, And with thy Ayres at last shut up the Scene: All Done, Thou shalt (though late, we hope) Remove, And change thy Musick here for that Above. Where thou shalt here how Saints their Anthems sing, And shalt thy Self another Anthem bring. Thou who did'st Tune the World, whiles Thou wert here, Shall take an Angels place, and Tune a Sphere. Horatio Moore. [Ayres for One Voyce] Chloris landing at Berlington. Amintor. See, see! my Chloris, my Chloris comes in yonder Bark: Blow gently winds, for if ye sink that Ark, you'l drown the world with tears, and at one breath, give to us all a universal death: Hark, hark how Arion on a Dolphin playes, to my sweet Sheepherdess his roundelayes: See how the Sirens flock to wait upon her, as Queen of Love, and they her Maids of honor. Behold, Great Neptune's risen from the deep with all his Tritons, and begins to sweep the rugged waves into a smoother form, not leaving one small wrinkle of a storm: Mark how the winds stand still, and on her gaze; See how her beauty doth the fish amaze; the Whales have begg'd this boon of wind and weather, that on their backs they may convey her hither; And see she Lands just like the rising Sun, that leaves the Brynie Lake when night is done: Fly, fly Amintor to thy Envi'd bliss, and let not th'Earth, rob thee of her greeting kiss. Constancy protested. [1] Oft have I swore, I'de love no more; Yet when I think on thee, Alass I cannot give it o're But must thy captive be; So many sweets and graces dwel About thy lips and eyes, That whosoever once is caught must ever be thy prize. 2 Sure thou hast got some cunning net Made by the god of Fire, That doth not only catch mens hearts But fixeth their desire. For I have laboured to get loose Some dozen years and more, And when I think to be releas'd I'me faster than before. 3 Then welcome sweet captivity, I see there's no relief, Yet though she steal my liberty, I'le honor still the theife And when I cannot hope to see Thee Mistris of my pain, My comfort is that I do love Where I am lov'd again. Counsel to a Maid. [1] Chloris, when e're you do intend To venture at a Bosome-friend, Be sure you know your Servant well, Before your liberty you sell; For Love's a feaver in young, or old, That's sometimes hot, and sometimes cold; And men you know when e're they please Can soon be sick of this disease. 2 Then wisely chuse a Friend that may Last for an age, not for a day; Who loves thee not for Lip or Eye, But from a mutual Sympathie: To such a Friend this heart ingage, For he will court thee in old age, And kiss thy shallow, wrinkl'd brow With as much joy as he doth now. Love despis'd. [I] In love? Away, You do me wrong, I hope I ha' not liv'd so long Free from the treach'ry of your Eyes, Now to be caught and made a prize: No, Lady, 'tis not all your Art Can make me and my freedome part. II In Love! 'tis true, with Spanish wine, Or the French juice Incarnadine, But truly not with your sweet face, This dimple, or that hidden grace; Ther's far more sweetnesse in pure wine, Then in those lips or eyes of thine. III Your god you say can shoot so right Hee'l wound a heart i'th darkest night; Pray let him throw away a dart, And try if he can hit my heart: No Cupid, if I shall be thine, Turn Ganimed, and fill us wine. [Come fil's a cup of Sherry] Come fil's a cup of Sherry Come fil's a cup of Sherry, and let us be merry, there shall nought but pure wine, make us love-sick or pine; wee'l hug the cup and kiss it, wee'l sigh when e're we miss it, for 'tis that that makes us jolly, and sing Hy trolly lolly. Hopelesse love cur'd by derision. [1] What? wilt thou pine, or fall away, Because thy Daphne says thee nay? Wilt cross thine arms, or willow wear, Because that Shee is so severe? Fye Shepherd, Fye, this must not bee, Thy Daphne then will laugh at thee. 2 No, if She needs will be unkind, On somewhat else divert thy mind: Go sport with wanton Amarillis, And dance with lovely nut-brown Phillis: For Love's a shadow will deny To follow thee, until thou sly. 3 Then Choridon, do not despair For Daphne, whom we all know fair; Let no proud Beauty on our Plains Destroy thy youth with her disdains: But if thou find her scorning thee, Think thus, She was not born for mee. A young Maids Resolution. [I] Goe young man, let my heart alone, 'Twil be a pris'ner unto none; Nor will I Cupids shackles wear, Since Lovers laws are so severe: Love is my slave, while I despise; But once content, hee'l tyrannise. II 'Tis onely Beauty you admire, And that's the object of Desire, Which by degrees burns to a flame, And hence Love first receiv'd its name. Then young man give me leave to doubt Since Love's a fire, and sires will out. Cupid no god. [I] I prethee Love take heed or else I shall blaspheme, And swear that thy great deity is nothing but a dream. II How canst thou be a god When subtle womens hearts Are grown so wise To blind thine eyes And rob thee of thy darts. III See where a Lady stands With Quivers in her Eyes, And swears that shee Hath conquer'd thee, And sold thee for a prize. IV If thou be Womans prize, Alass, then what are wee Who borrow light From thy blind sight, And know not what we see. Inconstancy return'd. [I] Did I once say that thou wert fair, And swear thy breath perfum'd the air? Did I commit Idolatry, And court thee as a deity? Ah CÃ¦lia! sure then I was blind, Or else it was when thou wert kind. II Did I once beg a wanton kiss, And thought there was no higher bliss? Did I all other objects flye To live i'th sun-shine of thine eye? 'Tis true I did, but CÃ¦lia then Return'd as much to me agen. III Now CÃ¦lia's chang'd and so am I, Love feeds upon variety; My constant thoughts could never find The pleasures of a Fickle mind, Till thy example did invite My appetite to new delight. His Rivals danger. [I] Take heed bold Lover, do not look upon my Chloris Eyes, for every dart is tipp'd with death that from her glances flyes. II Nor do not think to save thy self From danger, or from harmes, By any virtue in her smiles, Or other secret charmes. III Love hath commanded her to cure No other heart but mine, There is no hope that Shee can be So merciful to thine. IV For though her Eyes be Murderers, She hath reserv'd for me, A Balsam in her Coral lips That gives Eternitie. To his Platonick Mistris. [I] Beauty once blasted with the frost Of Age or Sickness, is quite lost; He who loves that, and on it can, Dote till he be no longer Man, Hath neither Intellect or Eyes To judge where womans beauty lies: No, let him court your better part, Your virtues and your loyal heart. II If nought but beauty in you be, Your Picture seems as fair to me; He that admires your red and white, Is Traytor to his own delight; And with those shadows growes so blind He never can your sweetnesse find. Then let me court your better part, Your vertues, and your loyall heart. III Yet do I never hope to see Goodnesse lodg'd in deformitie; Though devils oft take shapes divine, Angels take none but such as thine; This made me make my choice of thee The emblem of divinitie; That I might court your better part, Your vertues, and your loyal heart. Amintors welladay. [I] Chloris now thou art fled away, Amintor's sheep are gon astray; And all the joy he took to see, His pretty Lambs run after thee, Is gon is gon, and he alone, Sings nothing now but welladay, welladay. II His Oaten pipe that in thy praise Was wont to play such roundelays, Is thrown away, and not a swain Dares pipe, or sing, within his plain; 'Tis death for any now to say One word to him but welladay. II The Maypole where thy little feet So roundly did in measures meet, Is broken down, and no content Comes near Amintor since you went. All that I ever heard him say Was Chloris, Chloris, welladay. IV Upon those Banks you us'd to tread He ever since hath laid his head, And whisper'd there such pining woe, As not a blade of grass will grow; O Chloris! Chloris! come away, And hear Amintor's welladay. Affection for a Lady he never saw. [I] O now I find 'tis nought but Fate That makes us either love or hate; Yet I have heard the wiser tell, Love onely doth with Beauty dwell; And that the Eye the thief must play, To steal each others heart away. But 'tis not so I find with me, For I love one I ne're did see. II There's a Divinity in Love, That doth inspire us from above; Which needs no tutoring from the eyes, To make our hearts to Sympathize. Such Noble and Platonick fires, Will know no Object for desires: But Love's the good that dwels with thee, Although thy self they ne're did see. III Thy soul, not this, or t'other part, Hath sent her Cupids to my heart; And there like little Angels tell, What hidden vertues in thee dwell, Prompting my reason to suppose Thy Shape's Angelicall like those; Which I shall pray I ne're may see, Lest I should more distracted be. Freedome from Charmes. [I] Go, fair Inchantress! charm no more, But give thy fascinations o're; Since I have found a pow'rful Spel, That doth thy cunning Art excel; For when I think of thy disdain, I'm free from witchcraft, or from pain. II When I was young and unbetray'd, All then was Oracle you said; So innocent I was of guile, I thought love dwelt in every smile: But now that cloud of youth is spent, I find you'r all but complement. III I'le love no more, I'le learn to hate, I'le study to equivocate, And all my pleasures now shall be To cozen those would cozen me; For Loves best musick runs (I find) On fickle changes of the mind. Future Hope. [I] When shal I see my Captive heart That lies in Chloris brest? Or, when will Love again restore Rhose joys I once possest? Yet, 'tis a blessing I confess, When Fate is thus severe, Not to be barr'd of future hopes To mitigate our fear. II The Tyrant Love would be depos'd, And from this Empire thrown, Were not his subjects fool'd with hope That mercy would be shown. Then Captive heart contented lye, And banish all despaire, Since there is hope that she may be As kind as she is faire. On a Black Ribbon. [I] Black as thy lovely Eyes and Hair, This Ribbon for thy sake I wear, To tye rebellious passions in, Lest they on other objects sin; Thus I Love's pris'ner am, and may Expect my sentence ev'ry day; My heart fore-tells me now that I Am doom'd a slave to constancy. II How easie 'tis for to confine An am'rous and a willing minde! Soft Silk from your faire hands I feel Bindes faster far than chains of Steel: O let me still thy Bond-man be! I'le never sue for libertie; Let others boast that freedome have 'Tis my content to be thy slave. A Resolution to love no more. [I] Let me alone, I'le love no more, Nor will I that fond God adore; All your perfections cannot move One am'rous thought in me to love: Yet I'me not old, nor yet dis-eas'd, But onely with your Sex displeas'd; Not that I e're was scorn'd by any, But because you can love too many. What wonder is there then in thee, When thou hast lost thy constancie? II Alas, where lies that great delight Men fancy in your red and white? The common Lilly and the Rose Are far more beautifull then those; And many objects in the Skies Outshine the lustre of your Eyes, Though Poets please sometimes to say Your Eyes are brighter than the Day. Cupids Artillery. [I] Alas poor Cupid! Art thou blind? Canst not thy Bow and Arrows find? Thy Mother sure the Wanton playes, And layes 'em up for Holydayes. Then take but Arrows from her Eyes, Nnd all you shoot at surely dyes. II Then Cupid mark how kind I'le be, Because thou once wert so to me; I'le arm thee with such powerful darts, Shall make thee once more god of hearts. III My Chloris Armes shall be thy bow, Which none but Love can bend you know; Her precious Haires shall make the String, Which of themselves wound every thing. A Lady to a young Courtier. [I] Love thee! Good Sooth, Not I; I've somewhat else to doe: Alas! you must go learn to talk, Before you learn to wooe: Nay fie stand off, go too go too. II Because you'r in the fashion, And newly come to Court, D'ye think your Clothes are Orators T'invite us to the Sport? Ha ha, who will not jeer thee for't! III Ne'r look so sweetly Youth, Nor fiddle with your Band, We know you trimme your borrow'd Curles To shew your pretty Hand; But 'tis too young for to command. IV Go practise how to jeer, And think each word a Jest, That's the Court wit: Alas! you'r out To think when finely drest, You please me or the Ladies best. V And why so confident! Because that lately we Have brought another losty word Unto our pedegree? Your inside seems the worse to me. VI Mark how Sir Whacham fools; I marry there's a Wit Who cares not what he sayes or swears So Ladies laugh at it; Who can deny such blades a it? Falshood discovered. [I] Fond woman, thou mistak'st thy mark; Thy reason guides thee in the dark: And though thy Cupids cannot see, Mine have too many eyes for thee. Alas, I read in ev'ry smile, The Arts you use when you beguile. II What though you sweat to me, you love With passions equal to the Dove; And that your flames are blown no higher Than to the Sphere of chaste desire? Forgive me if I needs must say This is the common womans way. III Your Eyes like Suns I know can be As warm to any as to me, And yet you blush not oft to say You love but the Platonick way; Love how you will, and when you please, My heart shall sleep and take it's ease. Liberty. [I] Though thou hast Wit and Beauty too, Enough to make a Hermit wooe, And though, you swear your heart is mine, Yet all this will not make me thine; My Cupids now are full of eyes, And that's the reason they'r so wise. Then Ladies wonder not at me, If I desire my libertie. II 'Tis time to call my passions in, That have so long in darkness bin; For now I see you only play To win a heart and so away; She that can number all her store Of servants, now is very poor: Then Ladies wonder not, &amp;c. III Spring-garden is the Market-place Where men are brought up for a face; Some with their hands, some with their eyes, Catch any new thing for a prize; That Lady now grows poor and pines, Who wants her slaves to dig her mines. Then Ladies wonder not, &amp;c. A Pot of Flowers presented to Chloris. [I] See Chloris, see, how Nature brings All what she owes to thee that springs; These Roses from your Cheeks did grow, Those Lillies from your Bosomes snow; This various Tulip from your Eyes, From whence it bears so rich a prize. II Those purple streams in Azure set, Gave being to this Violet; These sprigs of Bayes we ne'r did see Till you taught Shepherds Poetrie: And all these flowers of purest red Sprung up where once your finger bled. III These Pansyes which so low do creep, Grew up one Night where you did sleep; So did these Poppyes, and from thence They have their sleepy influence; And all their leaves became thus green In hope by you they should be seen. IV And here I bring them in an Urn Of water, which themselves did mourn, Fearing to wyther and grow drye By too much Sun-shine of your Eye; For if your Beams the World inflame, Poor things, they needs must feel the same. A doubt resolv'd. [I] Fain would I love, but that I fear, I quickly should the willow wear; Fain would I marry, but men say, When Love is ry'd, he will away: Then tell me Love, what shall I doe, To cure these Fears when e're I wooe? II The Fair one she's a mark to all; The Brown one each doth Lovely call; The Black's a pearl in Fair mens Eyes; The rest will stoop to any prize. Then tell me love, &amp;c. Reply. Young Lover, know it is not I That wound with Fear or ealousie; Nor do men ever feel those smarts Until they have confin'd their hearts: Then if you'l cure your Fears, you shall Love neither Fair, Black, Brown, but all. To the first object of Content. [I] Why up so early in the world, And fondly led about From place to place to seek Content And could not find thee out? Alas! 'tis plain I was abus'd, I did mistake the light Which quickneth ev'ry Lovers eye, And gives a perfect sight. II Thou art the only Star that can Direct us where to find The way which I so long have sought To ease a troubled mind; Each limb of thine's so full of grace They ravish ev'ry Eye, And all the Musick that we know Is from their Harmony. III 'Tis You alone that do create The Beauties of the Spring, Those Shadows which from You reflect Adorneth ev'ry thing; Philosophers may govern Fools, But shall not tutor mee, For now I find that I was blind Until I found out thee. A Recantation. [I] Forgive me Love, what have I done! Abus'd the Stars, Eclips'd the Sun; And rashly call'd a Wandring light The Star whence true love borrows light: Yet mark the jest, She thinks that I Speak truth, and dote; Love knows I lie. II Will you not give men leave to sport, Alas, my heart commands a fort, Whence all the artillery of your Eyes Can make no breach, much lesse a prize: How subtle Ladies now are grown! Yet caught in Engines of their own. III My heart's no Coward, you shall see, To yield, because you shot at mee; A man o're come so quickly may Be taken pris'ner every day: Then Lady boast not of your prize, My heart still in his castle lyes. A description of Chloris. [I] Have you e're seen the morning Sun From fair Aurora's bosome run? Or have you seen on Flora's Bed, The Essences of White and Red? Then you may boast, for you have seen My Fairer Chloris, Beauties Queen. II Have you e're pleas'd your skilful eares With the sweet Musick of the Spheres? Have you e're heard the Syrens sing, Or Orpheus play to Hels black King? If so, be happy and rejoyce, For thou hast heard my Chloris voyce. III Have you e're smelt what Chymick skill From Rose or Amber doth distill? Have you been near that sacrifice The PhÅnix makes before she dies? Then you can tell (I do presume) My Chloris is the worlds perfume. IV Have you e're tasted what the Bee Steals from each fragrant Flower or Tree? Or did you ever taste that meat Which Poets say the Gods did eat? O then I will no longer doubt But you have found my Chloris out. Chloris a constant comfort. [I] Stay, stay ye greedy Merchants stay, Send not your ships so fast away, To trade for Jems or precious Ore, For now they'l be esteem'd no more; Sayl to the Indies of my Chloris Eyes, Cheeks, Hair, and Lips, there perfect treasure lies. II Come here Loves Hereticks that can Beleive ther's no true joy for man, See what refined pleasure flyes From ev'ry motion of her eyes; Gaze on my Chloris freely, then go tell To all the world where true Content doth dwell. III Forgive me Heavens if I adore Your Sun, or Moon, or Stars uo more; Those often are eclips'd, and can As soon destroy as cherish man: But Chloris like a constant comfort shines, Not only to our Bodies but our Mindes. Inconstancy. [I] O tell me Love! O tell me Fate! Or tell some other pow'r; Who did Inconstancy create, That changeth ev'ry houre? Why should one creature seem this day The object of Content, To Morrow lose that new-born joy, And prove a punishment? II Fair Shapes and guilded Honours raise Rebellion in our hearts; Then blame not Cupid if he shoot Such sev'rall sorts of darts: Such sullen miseries as these Will wait on fickle Love; Be thou a Saint it is decreed She must inconstant prove. Amintor's Dream. [I] As sad Amintor in a Medow lay Slumbring upon a bed of new-made Hay, A Dream, a fatal Dream unlock'd his eyes, Whereat he wakes, and thus Amintor cryes; Chloris, where art thou Chloris? Oh! she's fled, And left Amintor to a loathed Bed. II Heark how the Winds conspire with storm and rain To stop her course, and beat her back again: Heark how the heavens chide her in her way For robbing poor Amintor of his joy: And yet she comes nor. Chloris, O! she's fled, And left Amintor to a loathed bed. III Come Chloris come, see where Amintor lies, Just as you left him, but with sadder Eyes; Bring back that heart which thou hast stoln from me That Lovers may record thy Constancie: O no she will not. Chloris, O she's fled! And left Amintor, &amp;c. IV O lend me (Love) thy wings that I may flye Into her bosome, take my leave, and dye: What comfort have I now ith' world since she That was my world of joy is gone from me, My Love, my Chloris: Chloris, O she's fled And left Amintor to, &amp;c. V Awake Amintor from this dream, for she Hath too much goodnesse to be false to thee: Think on her Oathes, her Vows, her Sighes, her Tears, And those will quickly satisfie thy fears. No no, Amintor, Chloris is not fled, But will return into thy longing Bed. Chloris dead, lamented by Amintor. [I] Mourn, mourn with me, all true Enamour'd hearts, And Shepherds throw your pipes away: Cupid go burn thy Arrows and thy Darts, Let Night for ever Mother Day: For Chloris out bright Sun is dead, And with her all our joys are fled. II Love is with grief congeal'd into a Stone, And o're my Chloris grave she lies, Where round about the Graces sit and moan, Neglecting other Deities: The valleys where her flocks she fed Are drown'd with tears since she is fled. III Then follow me, where comfort never shin'd; Down, down into some darker Cell; There see Amintor weep, till he grow blind And comfortless for ever dwell: The Gods I fear will soon repent This universall punishment. Here Endeth the Ayres for One Voyce to the Theorboe-Lute or Bass-Viol. [Ayres for Two Voyces] A Dialogue on a Kisse. Among thy Fancies tell me this Question. Among thy Fancies tell me this, What is the thing we call a Kiss? Resol. I shall resolve you what it is: It is a creature born and bred betwixt the lips all cherry-red, by love and warm and warm desires fed; [Chorus both together.] And makes more sweet, and makes more sweet, and makes more sweet the Bridal bed. It is an active flame that flyes first to the Babies of the Eyes, and charms it there, and charms it there, with lulla lullabyes, lulla lulla lulla lulla lulla lulla byes. Chorus. And stills the Bride, and stills the Bride, and stills the Bride too when she crye. Then to the Chin, the Cheek, the Ear, it frisks, it flyes now here, now there, 'tis now far off, and now 'tis neer: Chorus. 'Tis here and there, 'tis here and there, 'tis here and there and ev'ry where. Has it a voycing vertue? Yes, How speaks it then? do you but this, part your joy'nd lips then speaks the kiss: Chorus. And this Loves sweet, and this Loves sweet, and this Loves sweetest language is. Has it a Body? I, and wings, with thousand various colourings, and as it flyes it sweetly sweetly sings, Love hony yields but never stings! Chorus. And as it flyes it sweetly sings, Love hony yields but never stings. A Dialogue between a Lover and his Friend. I love a Nymph Lover. I love a Nymph. Friend. A lack a day! Lover. But dare not say I love her. Friend. Perhaps she may thy love repay; speak then thy thoughts, and prove her. Lover. If I reveal, and she reject my love, I'm quite undone. Friend. Weomen when we do least expect, we see are often wonne. Lover. True, but her state great flocks requires, mine are but poor and small. Friend. Peace Fool, love onely love desires, and nothing else at all. [Chorus for three together.] They who do love for private gain, may suffer shipwrack, may suffer shipwrack, may suffer shipwrack in the Main. A Dialogue. StrephonâAmaryllis. Come come Amaryllis, I am ty'd by oath Streph. Come come Amaryllis, I am ty'd by oath, which now I must fulfill; let Fate my Soul from Earth divide, if Damon be not constant still: and the poor Swain, sits under yonder tree, with sighs bewailing your severitie. Amar. There let him sit sighing his fill, and take his labour for his hire; or piping go from hill to hill, till Sun-beam: his false pipe do fire: It moves not me, this this I onely grieve, I e're did him, and cannot you believe. Streph. Are apples gather'd from a tree, and put into fair Chloris hand, symptomes of his Inconstancie? Is this a breaking of Loves band? No, no, he ne'r lov'd Chloris; heark, heark he cryes, Come Amaryllis, come Amaryllis, or your Damon dyes. Amar. Ah Strephon, could I but be sure, that this unfeignedly were true, and that the tears he sheds were pure, I then could pity, I could pity more than you, and entertain the Eccho of his cryes, Come Damon come, Come Damon come, or Amaryllis dyes. Chorus. Thus Amaryllis to her Damon turn'd, whose Life was almost into Cinders burn'd: the gods will Lovers crown, though sooner we can kindle love, can kindle love, than quench loves jealousie. A Dialogue. CleanderâFloramell. Awake, awake, fair Floramell Clea. Awake, awake, fair Floramell. Flor. I doe. Clea. But who freed thee from this inchanted spell? Flor. 'Twas you, such heav'nly Chymistry you taught, from earth sublim'd my purer thoughts. Chorus both together. Happy, thrice happy those who govern Fate, subjecting greater Mindes to meaner State. Clean. And how appears Earths glories now? Flor. They'r gone. Clean. Then on, fly, lest they once more dazel thee. Flor. I Run and undisturb'd my flocks Ile find, there guide them with a quiet mind. Chorus. Happy, thrice happy those can see and try the worlds fond glories so, and pass them by. Clean. But tell me, Canst thou thus retire? Flor. I can. Clean. But when? VVill not those hasty vows expire? Fond man, 'tis now the Souls affections more Ãtherial flames, diviner love. Chorus. Happy thrice happy Soul that ravish'd so, enjoys a second Heaven here below. Short Ayres for One, Two, or Three Voyces. [Once Venus Cheeks that sham'd the Morn] Once Venus Cheeks that sham'd the Morn Once Venus Cheeks that sham'd the Morn, her hew let fall; her Lips that Winter had out-born, in June in June look'd pale; her Heat grew cold, her Nectar dry, no Dew she had but in her Eye, the wonted fire and flames to mortifie. When was this so dismal sight? When Adonis, Adonis bad Good-night. [I have prais'd with all my skill] I have prais'd with all my skill I have prais'd with all my skill each curious limb a-bout thee, so often, and yet do so still, that now each Swain can flout mee; and with nimble taunts can say, Sure this is some Bird of May. [When doth Love set forth Desire?] When doth Love set forth Desire? When doth Love set forth Desire? In prime of Youth, men say. And when doth that again retire? When Beauty fades away! Then you in youth in youth that think on this, taste what the sweets, the sweets of Beauty is. [Trust the Form of Ayrie things] Trust the Form of Ayrie things Trust the Form of Ayrie things, or a Syren when she sings: Trust the slye Hyenna's voyce; or of all, Distrust make choyce. And believe these sooner then Truth in Women, Faith in Men. [Deer, throw that Flatt'ring Glass away] [I] Deer, throw that Flatt'ring Glass away, I have two truer for your turn; These Eyes I mean, wherein you may See how you blaze, and how I burn. II Ah! could you but as plainly there My Faith as your owne Face descry, You'ld gaze your self no other where, And burn (perhaps) as well as I. [Do not delay me though you have the pow'r ages to stay me] [I] Do not delay me, though you have the pow'r Ages to stay me, O do't in an hour. Then do not slight me, O do not reject me! Say not what might be, since thus I affect thee. II No bodies stirring, O none that can hear thee! Then leave demurring since I am so near thee. This is the season each Bird is a building, You that have reason, O be not unwilling! [If you can find a heart (Sweet Love)] [I] If you can find a heart (Sweet Love) to kill, Yet grant me this, to read my latest Will: May all things smile on you, may nothing cross Your wish or will, who ever bears the loss. II May Fortunes wheel be ever in your hand, That you may never Sue, but still Command; And to these blessings, may your Beauty still Be fresh, and pow'rfull, both to save, and kill. [Sure thou framed wert by Art] [I] Sure thou framed wert by Art Purposely to take my Heart For such looks were ever made Onely for that Catching trade. II All thy Oathes and folded Armes, Sighing Blasts, bewitching Charms; Ev'ry Thought thou tend'st that way Was only lent me to betray. III False (alass) they are that swear, All Loves bargains are not dear. Know then Flatterer that I must Hear no more than I dare trust. IV You may promise, swear, and say, What perhaps you mean to day; But e're Morrows Sun be set, You another Love will get. V Had'st thou left me then untide Thou had'st never been denide, And I wish (for Maidens sake) None e're better bargain make. [O PhÅbus, cleer thy face] Go PhÅbus, cleer thy face Go PhÅbus, cleer thy face, collect thy rayes; and from those Stars which to thee Tribute payes, draw back thy light, and in thy greatest pride view my Love, a Star, a Star not yet deifide. [I Prethee send me back my heart] [I] I Prethee send me back my heart, Since I cannot have thine; For if from yours you will not part, Why then should you keep mine? II Yet now I think on't, let it lye, To send it me were vain, For th'hast a thief in either eye Will steal it back again. FINIS.</field>
