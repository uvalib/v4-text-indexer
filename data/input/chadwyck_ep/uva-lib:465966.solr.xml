      <field name="fulltext">[The History of the New Testament] St. MATTHEW the Evangelist. The GOSPEL according to St. Matthew. Christ's Line and Birth St. Matthew first relates, The Wisemens Off'rings and the Infants Fates: The Baptist in the Desart cries, Repent! Jesus Baptis'd: The Holy Spirit's Descent. Christ's Fast, Temptation, his Disciples choice; Fiends and Diseases flie his pow'rful Voice. His Sermon; Rules for Fasting, Alms, and Pray'r; Of false Foundations next he bids beware. The Leper, Palsy'd, Twelve; Christ's Yoke of Ease: The Sabbath, Sower: Christ's Words the Winds appease. Traditions, Loaves; Transfigur'd Christ appears; Children, Divorce, Hire, Christ Hosanna hears. The Marriage, Scribes, Temples and World's Decay: Christ's glorious Coming at the last Great Day; Tho' first betray'd, for Man's Offence he dies, And does from conquer'd Death the Third glad Morn arise. II. St. Matth. Chap. I. to Ver. 17. The Genealogy of CHRIST from Abraham to Joseph. The Saviour's Line and Acts these Leaves contain, From Abraham's Stem, and David's fated Reign, Old Abr'ham, Isaac, Jacob, fist take Place, From whence the Patriarchs and their Sacred Race. To Judah, did fair Thamar, Pharez bear, Ezrom was his, and Aram Ezrom's Heir: Aminadab to Nashon did resign, Salmon his Son, as Boaz, Salmon! thine. Obed was his, and Jesse Obed's Son, His, David, who the Hebrew Scepter won. From thence his Line the Sacred Writer brings To Babel's Chains thro' a long Race of Kings: To Joseph thence, and Mary, chast and fair, Mary, who did the Great Messiah bear. Thrice fourteen Ages lineally descend From Abr'ham down to Christ, whose Kingdom knows no End. III. St. Matth. Chap. I. Ver. 17. to the End. Christ's Conception and Birth. Joseph satisfied by an Angel, who interprets the Names of Christ. Mary to Joseph by firm Contract bound, She of the Holy Ghost is pregnant found. Yet, Mild and Good, he would not her expose; Private Divorce he rather kindly chose: When loe! an Angel in a Dream appears, Softens his Cares, and thus dispels his Fears: Refuse not, O! of David's Royal Line, Thy spotless Spouse in Holy Bonds to joyn, Her Fame untouch'd, her Burden's all Divine. From thence a wondrous Son shall soon proceed, JESUS his Sacred Name by Heav'n decreed. Whose mighty Arm shall set his People free From Sins, and Hell's ignoble Slavery: He rose, refresh'd, then Heav'ns Commands obey'd And to his Bosom takes the Sacred Maid: Preserves unknown, unspotted as before, Till She the promis'd Prince, the World's Great Saviour bore. IV. St. Matth. II. to Ver. 12. Wise-men directed to Christ by a Star, worship and offer Presents. A radiant Star whose kind and friendly Beams Against Judea dart their golden Streams. Three Eastern Magi from their Country brings; Wise-men they were, or at the least were Kings. Their Royal Presents in their Hands behold, The Sun's rich Birth, Myrrh, Frankincense, and Gold: With these the Monarch of both Worlds they meet, These and themselves they prostrate at his Feet. Thus were fulfil'd those weighty Truths foretold In mystic Holy Oracles of old: That Jacob's Star should in the Orient rise, And with amazing Splendor gild the Skies; Whence Kings shou'd to his rising Brightness flow, Sabæan Odours round his Altars throw; Exhaust their Treasures to encrease his Store, And bent profound to Earth the King of Kings adore. V. St. Matth. II. Ver. 13, 14, 15. The Flight of Joseph and Mary into Egypt. The Royal Strangers now divinely warn'd Herod avoid, and privately return'd: Agen an Angel is to Joseph sent The Heav'n-born Infant's Murder to prevent: “Sleep'st thou, O Son of David! (thus he said) “When worse than Death is hov'ring o'er thy Head? “Thy Sacred Charge by Herod's Cruelty “And jealous Rage already doom'd to die: “So he decrees, but so decrees not Fate, “Which gives his threaten'd Life a longer Date: “Then rise and flee, to Egypt flee with speed, “The Means by Heav'n as well as End decreed; “There till the Tyrant's Death a Refuge chuse, “Nor long before I bring the welcome News. He rose, he fled, he bore his Charge away, And robb'd the murd'rous King of his expected Prey. VI. St. Matth. II. Ver. 16, 17, 18. Herod's Anger, and the Slaughter of the Innocents. When the fierce King the Magi did deceive, And unresolv'd his curious Malice leave; Nor shall he 'scape my Sword, enrag'd he cry'd, Tho' all his Angels warding by his Side: Nor unattended shall he go, for all The Infants with their Childish Prince shall fall: Let Bethlehem mourn! Haste! Haste, my Guards, he cries, If one escapes with Life, who spares him dies. Too soon his bloody Ministers obey, Nor moves ill Fate it self more swift than they: The Mother's Shreeks, th'expiring Infants Groans, Who broach'd on Spears, or pash'd against the Stones, Or whelm'd in Waves resign their tender Breath, From the last Image of Despair and Death. Thus Rachel did her Childrens Loss deplore: They're gone, for ever gone, and Joy is now no more. VII. St. Matth. III. to Ver. 6. The Preaching of St. John the Baptist; his Apparel and Diet. Thro' Judah's fertile Wild the Baptist came, And the Messiah's Kingdom did proclaim; He comes, he comes, prepare! aloud he cry'd, Fill every Vale, low'r every Mountain's Pride. Severe the Preacher's Garb, his Mien, his Food, As on the Rivage of fair Jordan's Flood, Encompass'd with admiring Crowds he stood. Thy lofty Turrets, Salem! they forsake, Desarts of Towns, of Fields they Cities make. On Jordan's verdant Bank, thick Clusters stand, As when of old they seiz'd the Promis'd Land, Trampling the Earth, and blackning all the Strand. Their Sins no more defended, or disguis'd, They're in the Consecrated Stream baptis'd: Thus purg'd from many a long-contracted Stain, And thus prepar'd to meet th'approaching Saviour's Reign. VIII. St. Matth. Chap. III. from Ver. 13. to the End. Our Saviour baptized in Jordan, and acknowledg'd from above. To John at Jordan Jesus came, and press'd To be himself Baptiz'd among the rest: Trembling, the Baptist did at first refuse, Unworthy he who shou'd his Sandals loose; Till thus our Saviour—'Tis the Father's Will, That thus we shou'd all Righteousness fulfil. He strait obeys, when loe the Heav'ns divide, Whose azure Gates unfolding deep and wide Disclose a Dove, as Light, or Beauty fair, On Silver Pinions wafted thro' the Air, Which circling down their plumy Honours spred Gently incumbent o'er the Saviour's Head: When loe a Voice as rolling Thunder loud Breaks from the Bosom of the shining Cloud: This is my Son Belov'd, attend with awful Fear! In him I'm pleas'd with Man, let him his Saviour hear. IX. St. Matth. Chap. IV. Ver. 1, 2, &amp;c. Jesus tempted of the Devil. Now Jesus by the Sacred Spirit led, A Glorious Hermit to the Desart fled: Him Hunger first, the Tempter then assail, In hopes o're weaken'd Nature to prevail: If thou th'Eternal Son of God, he said, Exert thy Power, and bid these Stones be Bread! Repuls'd, he to the Temple Roof did bear Our patient Lord, and thus accost him there: If thou the Son of God, leap fearless hence, Thy Father's Angels will be thy defence: Still baffled, still he urg'd his curs'd Design, Do but adore me, all the World is thine. Our Saviour thus: Tempter blaspheme no more! 'Tis writ, The Lord thy God alone adore! As Thunder struck he fled, this answer giv'n, And in his room attend their Lord, the Host of Heaven. X. St. Matth. Chap. IV. Ver. 15, 16, 17, 18, &amp;c. Simon Peter, Andrew, James and John call'd to be Disciples. Thro' Galilee's dark Regions next he goes, And Seeds of Light and heav'nly Wisdom sows. Repent, repent! thus did the Saviour cry, The promis'd Reign and future World is nigh: And while he preaching did his Progress take By fair Gennezareth's extended Lake, Two Fishers on their poor Employ intent, Equally Ignorant and Innocent. He sees, and beckning calls, this Andrew nam'd, That Simon, more in Sacred Story fam'd. Next the two Sons of Zebedee he saw On the broad Lake, who struck with sacred Awe, And drawn by Cords of Love at his Command, Leap from their Bark, and print the yielding Sand: Such was the Train that form'd his humble State, Such Courtiers did upon the King of Glory wait. XI. St. Matth. Ch. V. Ver. 3, 4, 5, 8, 9 The Sermon on the Mount; or, the Beatitudes. And now unnumber'd Crowds together draw, To whom he thus unfolds his sacred Law: Thrice bless'd the Poor in Spirit he first declares, A glorious heav'nly Kingdom shall be theirs. Bless'd are those Mourners who their Sins confess, Nor will I leave those Mourners comfortless. Bless'd are the Meek, who sure Rewards shall gain, In the New Earth and Heav'n shall with me reign. Bless'd all who after Righteousness aspire, For Heav'n will fill their most enlarg'd desire. Bless'd are the Merciful, the Mild, the Kind, Who when they need themselves, shall Mercy find. Bless'd are the Pure in Heart, for they shall see Th'Eternal Beatific Purity. Bless'd are their Names who make all Discord cease, The genuine Sons of him who is the God of Peace. XII. St. Matth. Chap. V. Ver. 10, 11, 12 Blessing on such as suffer in the Cause of Religion. But, (he goes on) those above all the rest, Who suffer in fair Virtue's Cause, are Bless'd: Thrice bless'd are ye when scorn'd, blasphem'd, revil'd, The basest, worst of Men esteem'd and stil'd, You know your Friend, for whom you undergo The worst of Scandals, your Reward you know. Let boundless Joy your ravish'd Hearts possess: Indulge it here, for here is no Excess. See yonder glorious Host, not far before, Who once, unmov'd, the same Afflictions bore; How pleas'd! how bright! of endless Palms possess'd, In Abraham's Bosom they securely rest: Their never-fading Laurels you shall share, Companions in the Triumph, as in War: For light Afflictions weighty Bliss shall gain, Crown'd with no vulgar Stars in endless Glory reign. XIII. St. Matth. Chap. V. Ver. 23, 24. Brotherly Love and Forgiveness enjoyn'd and directed. Next learn the Rules for Sacrifice and Pray'r, If to the Temple thou with gifts repair Unreconcil'd expect no audience there! Propitiate first thy Brother, else in vain From Heav'n thou dost acceptance hope to gain. Forgive, forgiv'n! yourselves my Followers prove, Melt Curses down with Pray'rs, and Hate with Love! Your Great Exemplar, make that Love divine Whose fruitful Show'rs still fall, whose Sun does shine On Good and Bad promiscuous: thus you'll be As far as suits with weak Humanity, Above the World, and Perfect ev'n as he. Secret your Alms and pious Pray'rs, and known To him, who sees and will reward, alone; Who all things does thro' secret Shades survey, As in the open Light, and blazing Noon of Day. XIV. St. Matth. Chap. VII. Ver. 3, 4, 5. The censorius Sinner. To judge another let not Man presume, As he'd have Mercy at the last Great Doom: What rigid Measure you to others give Press'd down and running o'er you shall receive. Why so exact and nice, fond Mortal! why To find small Motes within thy Brother's Eye, Tho' Beams within thy own thou canst not 'spy? Base Hypocrite! first mend thy self, and then Thou'lt clearly see the Faults of other Men. Nor yet is he censorious who the Root Does justly argue from the vitious Fruit. The churlish Thistle cannot Figs produce, Nor yield harsh Thorns the Grapes reviving Juice: Nor 'scapes that Tree the Planter's hope deceives, For gen'rous Fruit producing nought but Leaves: The Ax is rais'd, its dreadful Fall is nigh, The unconsuming Food of Flames that never die. XV. St. Matth. Chap. VII. Ver. 13, 14. The strait and narrow, with the broad and wide Way. Two Paths there are thro' which all Mortals go, This leads to Bliss, and that to endless Wo: The Way that leads to Misery is broad, A smooth, a pleasing, and a flow'ry Road: With Company 'tis crowded every where, The Rich, the Gay, the Witty, and the Fair. Ah, fondly-blinded, whither will they run! Why in such headlong-haste to be undone! See how they press Death's ample Gates to win! How heedless of the Flames that glare within! There is another unfrequented Way, Leads to the Confines of Eternal Day; Thorny and strait, yet as thou farther go, 'Twill still more easy, more delightful grow: To pass this narrow Gate no Labour spare, For Heav'n and Holy Souls, and God himself is there. XVI. St. Matth. Chap. VII. Ver. 24, 25, 26, 27. The Wise and the Foolish Builders. Who hears attentive, and my Word obeys, He's like the Man that firm Foundations lays On a strong Rock, whose Building storms defies, Tho' Rain descends, and angry Billows rise. But who at Wisdom's sacred Gates appears, And hears the Word of Life, but only hears, Shall to that foolish Builder be compar'd, Who with vast Cost a stately Palace rear'd. Fair to the Sight, and towring to the Sky, But on loose Sands its faithless Walls rely. See how the Heav'ns with Clouds and Tempests frown! What Cataracts of Rain come pouring down! How fell the mustring Waves! how high they flow, And sap the false Foundations from below; Till with a Crack the Walls come tumbling o'er, And spread the faithless Sands whereon they stood before. XVII. St. Matth. Chap. VIII. Ver. 2, 3, 4 Christ cleanses the Leper. From the green Hill descending, compass'd round With wond'ring Crowds, a Leprous Wretch he found All crusted o'er with Ulcers, on the Ground: With Eyes dejected, scarcely rais'd his Head. And Voice submiss, he to our Saviour said, O! if a Wretch like me may sue and speed, (Tho' none than me had ever greater need) Since, Lord! to Will and Do's the same with thee, Regard my Pray'r, and heal my Leprosie: Our Saviour with mild Pity in his Eyes, Unto the Miserable thus replies: Thy Faith hath conquer'd, and thy Grant is seal'd, I firm thy pious Pray'r. Be cleans'd and heal'd! His pow'rful Word and Touch to Health restore, His Flesh return'd as firm and beauteous as before. XVIII. St. Matth. Chap. VIII. Ver. 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13. The Centurion's Servant heal'd of the Palsie. A brave Centurion next our Lord address'd, Whose Servant with the Palsie lay oppress'd: To whom he thus—Thou hast not ask'd in vain; My self I'll come, and soon remove his Pain: When He—I'm far unworthy such a Grace, A Sinner of the Gentiles hopeless Race. Speak and 'tis done, for thus at thy Command My Soldiers march, retreat, advance, or stand. With pleasing wonder thus our Lord rejoyn'd, Such Faith in Israel yet I ne'er could find. But many a Gentile shall the Kingdom gain, In Bliss and Light with all the Patriarchs reign; While in the dismal Realms of Night and Pain Shall Abraham's miscall'd Offspring be confin'd: For thee, thy Faith has won, thy Suit is sign'd, Thy Servant lives.—O'erjoy'd he went, and found The Sick restor'd to Health, the Paralytic sound. XIX. St. Matth. Ch. VIII. Ver. 24, 25, 26 The Tempest stilled by his Rebuke. The Saviour now a Voy'ge is pleas'd to make, Royal Tiberias! o'er thy fishful Lake, With his lov'd Twelve, when loe! a Storm arose, And every Wave their feeble Bark o'erflows; While he, whom Sins nor Cares did waking keep, In their small Cabin did securely sleep: They run and wake him with the Tempest toss'd, O Master! help us! or we all are lost. He 'rose and did their sinking Vessel save, First them rebuk'd, and then the rising Wave. O weak in Faith! what meant this causless Fear? What Danger can there be when I am here? Then calms the Winds and Surges with his Word, For Nature knew him, and obey'd her Lord: To well-known Caves the trembling Tempests creep, And Waves to Dimples turn'd, adorn the smiling Deep. XX. St. Matth. Chap. IX. Ver. 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8. A second Paralytick heal'd. When Fame had spred the Palsy'd Servant's ease, Another lingring of the same Disease, Thro' the uncover'd Roof his Friends convey, And at the Feet of Jesus humbly lay: Pleas'd with their Faith, he said, Thy Sin's forgiv'n, I loose on Earth, and thou art loos'd in Heav'n: What bold Blasphemer's this, that pardons Sin? Murmur'd the Scribes, with rancour gall'd within, Yet dare not to the World their Thoughts express, When he who knows the secret Soul no less Than broadest Actions others, thus reply'd, And justly checkt their Malice and their Pride: Since Falshood ne'er by Miracle was seal'd, See, my Credentials! Man! arise! be heal'd! He 'rose to Health and vig'rous Strength, and bore The useless Couch away which him sustain'd before. XXI. St. Matth. Chap. IX. Ver. 9. St. Matthew call'd to the Apostleship. A stately Mole near rich Capernaum lay, To bridle and secure the neighb'ring Bay: Fronting the Lake a noble Palace stood, Marble the Stones, and Cedar all the Wood: The Burse of Galilee, which cou'd contain The different Nations thither drawn by gain, Who Custom pay for what their Vessels bear, Nor durst unload their Freight till entred there. This Post of equal Honour, Trust, and Gain, Rich Levi did by Friends at Court obtain. As in his Office there he sat, and told The glitt'ring heaps of all-commanding Gold, Drams, Shekels, Talents, him our Lord did see, And kindly thus accosts him—Follow me! Struck with his Words he runs without delay, The World has nothing now to Bribe his stay. “O! may we imitate his happy Choice, “Like him, O Son of God! obey thy Voice! “So shall we Treasures in the Heav'ns secure, “Which far beyond the reach of Time or Age endure. XXII. St. Matth. Chap. IX. Ver. 18, 23, to 25. The Daughter of Jairus raised to Life. Jairus, a Ruler, next to Jesus ran, Fell at his Feet, and thus with Tears began: My only Daughter struggling lies for Breath, And labours in the Agonies of Death: Yet on her lay thy Hands, I ask no more, Thy sacred Hands will Health and Life restore. Mov'd with his pious Pray'rs he went and found The Musick with a slow and solemn Sound; The loud Laments for her untimely Fate, Declaring ev'n his Help was now too late: Piercing the mournful Crowd—Give place he cries, The Maid's not dead, but only slumb'ring lies. With scornful Smiles they go; he bids her rise: She 'rose, he to her Friends restor'd the Maid, And Fame thro' all the Land the wond'rous News convey'd. XXIII. St. Matth. Chap. IX. Ver. 32, 33. The dumb Devil cast out. Some sullen Dæmon did a Wretch invade, And struck him dumb, to Jesus brought for Aid. With Eyes of Pity first he him survey'd, Then bids the Fiend dislodge, who dares not stay, But murm'ring and reluctant glides away: The Patient freed from his Infernal Guest, His Great Physician's Pow'r aloud confess'd; Those who from the adjacent Regions came, Attracted by the heav'nly Healer's Fame, When all the Works of this Great Day they saw, Pregnant of Miracles, with sacred Awe And strange Amazement seiz'd, they freely own, The like in Israel ne'er before was known. Not all th'Inspir'd, who their Forefathers taught, Not mighty Moses's self so many Wonders wrought. XXIV. St. Matth. Chap. X. Ver. 5, to 15. The Mission of the twelve Apostles, to teach and do Miracles. Now Jesus call'd his chosen twelve, and sent To every Place before him where he went: To their Commission, Miracles the Seal; He bids 'em raise the Dead, Dæmoniacs heal, The Gospel preach; as freely they receive, So all again with generous Bounty give. Yet not refuse what Nature did require, The Workman sure does well deserve his Hire. But where with Scorn or Negligence they meet, He bids 'em shake the Dust from off their Feet. A dreadful Sign to those that still refuse The proffer'd Grace, their own Damnation chuse! Curst Sodom and Gomorrha's Towns which fell Thro' Gulfs of liquid Fire from Earth to Hell, Adjudg'd to a far milder Doom than they, More temp'rate Flames at the last Great Decisive Day. XXV. St. Matth. Chap. XIII. Ver. 39, 40, 41, 42. The Parable of the Sower and the Tares. Now he in lively Parables express'd His sacred Law, in this among the rest. A Sower went to sow his fertile Land, And spread choice Seed abroad with lib'ral Hand; But while his Servants slept, an envious Foe, Unhappy Tares among the Wheat did sow: Together they, a dubious Crop, arise, The angry Servants saw, and strait advise To weed the Field: the wiser Lord replies, So may the Wheat for Tares be cast away: No—both shall stand till the Great Harvest Day, Then shall the Reapers in my Garners lay, Ne'er to be blended more, the precious Seed, The Tares in bundles bound, the Flame shall feed. The Field's the World, the Tares reserv'd for Fire, Th'accursed Children of a wicked Sire, Sworn Foe to God and Man, and Mischiefs Friend; The Harvest is the World's approaching End: Then shall the Unjust be divin'd to endless Night, Then shall the Just out-shine the Sun's meridian Light. XXVI. St. Matth. Chap. XIV. Ver. 3, to 11 The Decollation of St. John the Baptist. The Baptist at his Life's expence reproves Herod the King, for his incestuous Loves; Imprison'd first, till Festal Pomps proclaim The Tyrant's Birth, when all his Nobles came To hail the happy Day, nor wanted there Herodias self, that false revengeful Fair. Her Daughter with her, Ah! too like her, came, The lawless Birth of a forbidden Flame. Dancing and Royal Music closes all, And young Herodias still out-shines the Ball. Extravagantly pleas'd, the Tyrant cry'd, What e'er she ask'd, she should not be deny'd. Taught by her Mother, she resolves too soon, The rev'rend Baptist's Head, her impious Boon: Dropping with Gore, 'tis in a Charger laid, Which to her Mother she with barb'rous Joy convey'd. XXVII. St. Matth. Chap. XIV. Ver. 19, 20, 21. The Miracle of the five Loaves and two Fishes. Now to the Desart Jesus did repair, And sought in vain a calm Retirement there; For soon unnumber'd Crowds together draw, To see his Works, and hear his sacred Law. Till dewy Evening came, attent they stay'd, When with Compassion them our Lord survey'd; And bids th'Apostles for his Guests prepare; Amaz'd they ask their Master—Whence and where? Five Loaves and two small Fishes all their store For num'rous Thousands—'Tis enough, and more, Our Lord replies; these in his Hands did take, Then looking up to Heav'n, he bless'd and brake, Which to the Multitude the Twelve divide, Till all their Hunger largely was supply'd. Five thousand Souls the wond'rous Feast sustain'd, Yet Twelve large Baskets-full of broken Food remain'd. XXVIII. St. Matth. Chap. XIV. Ver. 29, 30, 31. Christ walking on the Sea, saves St. Peter sinking. It was a dismal and tempestuous Night, No cheerful Stars afford their friendly Light; When 'cross the Lake the Twelve directly bore, Their Master left behind 'em on the Shore: Their Pilot absent, they with Waves are tost, All Marks of Land, and Hopes of Safety lost. And now the solemn dead of Night was near, When restless Shades and guilty Ghosts appear, When lo a Shape, which struck 'em all with fear, Approach'd the Bark, they raise a dreadful cry, A Ghost they thought it, till our Lord—'Tis I. Him Peter first discern'd, and bold and brave, Leapt fearless down, and trod the boistrous Wave, But sinking, cry'd, at last, O Master save! He did, but did his want of Faith upbraid, Then to the Ship in safety him convey'd: They shoot away, the Winds oppos'd no more, And in a Moment reach Capern'um's welcom shore. XXIX. St. Matth. Chap. XV. Ver. 1, to 20. The Scribes and Pharisees reprov'd for their Traditions. The captious Scribes and Pharisees came down T'accost our Lord from Salem's sacred Town; Tempting, they ask—Why he'd their Laws despise, And eat with Hands unwash'd?—he thus replies: Nay rather, Why, by your Traditions vain, Do you the Sacred Laws of God profane? For God's Command our Parents bids obey, On pain of Death, but your Traditions say, Who e'er to Corban does his Substance give, He need no more his aged Sire relieve. In vain you wou'd unwary Minds beguile, Meats cannot reach the Soul, or that defile: Adult'ries, Murders, all are from within, The Heart retains the secret Seeds of Sin. But, O ye blinded Leaders of the Blind, In vain you hope the Ways of Life to find: Into the Pit of Pain you all shall slide, The wilfully-misled with their unfaithful Guide. XXX. St. Matth. Chap. XV. Ver. 22, to 28. The Canaanitess Daughter dispossest of a Devil. As Jesus walk'd by Sidon's winding Shore, A Syrian Woman did his Aid implore; Vex'd by a Fiend, whose only Daughter lay In grievous Pains; our Saviour turns away, To her Petitions not a word replies; She follows still with Tears, and louder Cries, O Son of David help!—The Twelve implore He'd let her persecute their Ears no more: To the lost Sheep of Israel am I come, Our Lord returns, to guide their wand'rers home; Nor can you think it meet the Dogs be fed (A Race impure and vile) with Childrens Bread, Nor dare my humble Wishes aim so high, The Woman did again with Tears reply; Yet may the Dogs the falling Crumbs receive, And eat the broken Meat the Children leave. Vanquish'd at length, with Smiles rejoyn'd our Lord, Great is thy Faith, and Great be thy Reward! Make thy own Terms!—She went, and on the Bed Her Daughter found compos'd, the angry Dæmon fled. XXXI. St. Matth. Chap. XV. Ver. 36, 37, 38. Four Thousand fed with seven Loaves and a few Fishes. Again the Multitude to Jesus come, And with 'em crowd the Blind, the Lame, the Dumb. These to the Great Physician's Feet they brought As on a verdant Mountain's side he taught; From whence he might with ease a Prospect take Of Jordan gliding thro' the Neighb'ring Lake: Not one return'd unheal'd, but found Relief For each invet'rate Pain, and hopeless Grief: Thrice did the Sun o'er Hermon's Cliffs aspire, And thrice beneath the Western Waves retire; Yet still attentive to his Words they stood, Tho' spent and fainting now for want of Food. Again our Saviour them with Wonders fed, A few small Fishes, and seven Loaves of Bread. Four thousand Souls the heav'nly Feast sustain'd, Yet seven large Baskets-full of broken Food remain'd. XXXII. St. Matth. Chap. XVI. Ver. 18, 19 Various Opinions of Christ. Peter's Confession. And now from Noise and Company retir'd, Our Saviour of his chosen Twelve enquir'd What Thoughts of him the People entertain? They answer—Some, that John's reviv'd again: Elias some, and others think they see The Soul of Jeremias breath in Thee. But fervent Cephas boldly—Thee we own The Christ of God, th'Eternal Father's Son. To whom our Lord—Barjonas! thou art bless'd, Who early hast this noble Truth confess'd. Thou by thy Heav'nly Father this wert taught, And far beyond the School of Nature brought: This Faith the Rock whose strength shall still excel, My Church unmov'd by all the Powers of Hell. As they to me by my Great Father giv'n, To thee and these I give the Keys of Heav'n: What here you loose, your Sentence I approve, What here you justly bind, my Father binds above. XXXIII. St. Matth. Chap. XVII. Ver. 1, 2, 3 The Transfiguration of Our Saviour. Cephas and Zebedee's two Sons he chose, And to the flow'ry Top of Tabor goes; Where soon with radiant flames his Temples shine, Larger his Form appear'd, and all-divine. The Sun enthron'd in his Meridian height, Did ne'er around him shoot so fair a Light. Moses and Great Elias both descend, And at an awful distance him attend; What they had learnt among the Bless'd explain His wond'rous Passions, and his glorious Reign. Such Splendor the Disciples cou'd not bear, But sunk profound to Earth, and trembled there: When loe a Voice, as rolling Thunder loud, Breaks from the Bosom of a shining Cloud, This is my Son Belov'd: attend with awful Fear! In him I'm pleas'd with Men; let Men their Saviour hear. XXXIV. St. Matth. Chap. XVII. Ver. 14, 15, 16, 17, 18. The foul Spirit cast out of the young Man. An aged Sire his Son to Jesus brought, And kneeling, thus with Tears his Aid besought; —A furious Dæmon has my Child possest, And from his Cradle robb'd of Sence and Rest: Now plung'd in Water, ready to expire, And now half-burnt we snatch him from the Fire. And though I to thy own Disciples came, My Hopes they fail'd, his Torment's still the same. O stubborn and averse to proffer'd Grace! How long shall I endure your faithless Race? Our Saviour inly mov'd with Sighs, replies, To heav'nly Light, why will you close your Eyes? Then bids the Fiend dislodge, who hastes away, Nor dares he but his dreaded Voice obey, Which shakes Heav'n, Earth and Hell; murm'ring he fled To his own dark abodes, and mansions of the Dead. XXXV. St. Matth. Chap. XVIII. Ver. 2, 3, 4. Children call'd, and Meekness recommended. Ambition now the chosen Twelve divides, Which shou'd be first, which thus our Lord decides: A little Child he to himself did call, And sets him in the midst amongst 'em all; Then thus (when him he in his Arms had plac'd, And with a Mother's Tenderness embrac'd) If you'd be great, hence your Example take, This Innocence you must your Pattern make. If you the heav'nly Kingdom hope to gain, And with me in my Father's Glory reign: Let fond Ambition pass, be meek and mild, And teachable and humble, like this Child. Wo to the Wretch who one of these offends, How just, how dire a Fate his Crimes attends! Far better for him that he found a Grave, A thousand Fathoms deep beneath the briny Wave. XXXVI. St. Matth. Chap. XVIII. Ver. 23, to 27. The King who took account of his Servants. A King there was, whom, tho' both Wise and Great, His faithless Servants long conspir'd to cheat; Tho' long they reign'd, discover'd at the last, He asks a strict Account of all that's past; And with the greatest Villain first begun, Who twice five thousand Talents had out-run: Insolvent found, he bids 'em take away And sell the Wretch, the vast Account to pay; Low at his Feet the Hypocrite did fall, Have Patience with me, and I'll pay thee all. Mov'd with Compassion, him his Lord forgave, And from his justly-threaten'd Fates did save; What yet remain'd, advis'd him to improve, As he'd regain his Confidence and Love, O'erjoy'd and free, he from his Presence went, Bow'd low, and promis'd fair, but no Performance meant. XXXVII. St. Matth. Chap. XVIII. Ver. 28, 29, 30. The cruel Fellow-servant deliver'd to Torment. Too soon did he his Fellow-servant find, From whom, as chanc'd, a trifling Sum behind, An hundred Pence was on Account unpaid; Throttling he seiz'd, and did the Wretch upbraid; Who clasp'd his Feet, his Patience did implore, And us'd the Plea the other did before; But us'd in vain, it now could find no Room, A loathsom Goal his unrelenting Doom; The rest commiserate his hapless Fate, And to their Lord with speed the whole relate: Enrag'd he did the Wretch remand in haste, And thus th'irrevocable Sentence pass'd: Cruel and Wicked! thy Request I heard, And hadst thou no Compassion, no Regard To other's Prayers! Hence, from my sight away, In Dungeons mourn, till thou the Debt do pay. Such Measure shall they from high Heav'n receive, Whose Hearts with Rancour fill'd, their Brother not forgive. XXXVIII. St. Matth. Chap. XIX. Ver. 13, 14, 15. Christ's Tenderness to little Children. Some pious Parents did our Lord address, And their dear Infants bring for him to bless. Whom his officious Follow'rs did oppose, Why should he troubled be with such as those? With Anger and Displeasure in his Eyes, Such as they seldom wore, our Lord replies, —O, do not Little Children turn away, But let 'em to me come, and with me stay! My Father Crowns of Light for them prepares, A glorious heav'nly Kingdom shall be theirs. He says, and kindly takes them in his Arms, Nor with their Infant-Blandishments and Charms Remains unmov'd: His Hands upon their Head He laid, which Grace and heav'nly Virtues shed: By Words and Deeds his tender Care express'd, Nor willingly dismiss'd, nor sent 'em thence unbless'd. XXXIX. St. Matth. Chap. XIX. Ver. 16, to 22. The Difficulty of Salvation to rich Men. With eager Haste a Youth to Jesus ran, Fell prostrate at his Feet, and thus began: What shall I do, for none can better tell, T'arrive at Bliss, and 'scape the Flames of Hell? To whom our Lord—You must not steal nor kill, Adult'ry shun: Obey your Parents Will. These I've observ'd from Childhood, he rejoyn'd, What is there of Perfection yet behind? With Love and Pity, him our Lord survey'd, And to the forward Learner thus he said: Sell all thou hast, if thou wilt perfect be, Give to the Poor, and come and follow me. As Thunder-struck with this reply he stands, Nor e'er expected such severe Commands: At length he did with much of Pain depart, His Wealth prevail'd, and stole away his Heart. Sighing, our Lord—How ill doth Wealth agree With the neglected Cross and Pietie? As soon the loaden Camel may pass by A narrow Gate, or thred a Needle's Eye; As he who trusts in Riches, Life obtain, Enter the Gates of Bliss, the Crown of Glory gain. XL. St. Matth. Chap. XX. Ver. 1, 2, 3, 4. The Parable of the Labourers in the Vineyard. A careful Landlord did the Sun prevent, His Business call'd, he to the Market went; And there for painful Labourers enquir'd, Whom he to work in his fair Vineyard hir'd; Their Wages fix'd, his Care he twice repeats, With others on the same Conditions treats. 'Twas now the Hour when the declining Sun Almost the Western Goal of Heav'n had won: Again the Lord did to the Streets repair, And others found, remiss and idling there; Displeas'd he ask'd 'em—Why so long they stay, And waste in thriftless Idleness, the Day? That none had hir'd 'em, they for Answer give; Go work, he said, and what is just receive. At Night his Steward call'd, the Workmen paid, And first and last their Wages equal made: Those murmur who began at early Morn, And all the Sun and scorching Heat had born. My Friends, you are not wrong'd, the Lord replies, Why shou'd you then behold, with envious Eyes, Another's Good? and why, without Offence, May I not, as I please, my own dispense? But there are Last who shall the First appear, And oft the foremost Ranks come latest in the Rear. XLI. St. Matth. Chap. XX. Ver. 20. to 28 Humility recommended on occasion of the Request of the Zebedees Mother. The Mother of the Zebedean Pair Embrac'd our Saviour's Feet, and prostrate there, Unless he'd grant her Boon, refus'd to rise; He bids her name it, she again replies, That these my Sons, who with thee first embrac'd Thy Law, may next thee on thy Throne be plac'd. Returns our Lord—You know not what you do, How dear an Honour 'tis, for which you sue. And can you then a Fate like mine sustain, Share in my Suff'rings as you'd share my Reign? We can, they answer; and you shall, says he, But for the other, 'tis not lodg'd in me; That Honour must alone by those be shar'd For whom by my Great Father 'tis prepar'd. The Twelve were at th'ambitious Suit enrag'd, Until their Anger thus our Lord asswag'd: The World and you a different Course must steer, He must be least, who wou'd be greatest here: The Son of Man expects not Pomp or Fame, In a mean Servant's humble Form he came; His Life a Ransom for Mankind to give, That, sav'd from Death and Hell, they might for ever live. XLII. St. Matth. Chap. XXI. Ver. 4, to 9. Christ's Entry into Jerusalem; the Hosanna's of the People. On a mean Ass to Town our Saviour came, Yet loud Hosanna's his approach proclaim: The Palm's fair Branches in his Road they lay, And with their Garments spread the crouded way: Before, behind, unnumber'd thousands press, And with glad Hymns the Son of David bless: Thus came those sacred Oracles to pass, Which in a Vision's intellectual Glass, Ten Ages since, by Angels shown to thee Great Iddo's Son, illustrious Zacharie! Who thus—O Sion's Daughter! do not fear; Behold thy King! behold thy Saviour near! By no triumphant Chariot is he born, No Horse, whom rich Caparisons adorn: An humble Ass's tender Fole must bring The Saviour of the World, fair Salem's peaceful King. XLIII. St. Matth. Chap. XXI. Ver. 12, 13. The Buyers and Sellers cast out of the Temple. To God's high Temple Jesus went, and found Large Droves of Oxen spread the sacred Ground. From distant Basan's fertile Pastures bought, With Sheep from Carmel, or from Sharon brought. The fair Piazza's round with Shops are fill'd, And those with Bankers, well in cheating skill'd, Before 'em tempting heaps of Coin were laid, Far less has many a Prince and Realm betray'd, Nor this our Lord, with anger in his Eyes, A Scourge of smarting Cords he well applies, Then thus—Ye sacrilegious, hence, away! My Father's House, where all should meet and pray, By you a Den of Thieves and Robbers made, A noisie Bourse for Barter and for Trade. Then his Disciples thought on Truths foretold Of him, in holy Oracles of old. “For Zeal of thy dear House my Spirits decay, “It sinks my Strength, and steals my fainting Soul away. XLIV. St. Matth. Chap. XXI. Ver. 33, to 38 The wicked Husbandmen, and their just Punishment. A Lord there was who plants a Noble Vine, To yield the choicest Grapes and gen'rous Wine: This soon he did to Husbandmen convey, A just proportion of the Fruits to pay. As chanc'd he to far distant Regions went, And when the Vintage came, his Servants sent, To bring him of the Fruit; the Churls refus'd, Some did they beat, some kill, and all abus'd: What shall he do? his Son he speeds away, For him they sure wou'd rev'rence and obey: When him the Traitors at a distance spy'd, The Heir himself! with barb'rous Joy, they cry'd: Now must our Force and Policy be shown, Dispatch but him, the Vineyard's all our own. They did, but when the Lord their Treason knows, How will he of the Murderers dispose? The Wretches he'll destroy, their Houses burn, To those his Vineyards lett, who will the Fruits return. XLV. St. Matth. Chap. XXII. Ver. 2, to 13 The Marriage-Feast, and the unworthy Guests. A Monarch who with regal Pomp and State, The Nuptials of his Son would celebrate. His Servants sent t'invite the Country round, But all with one consent Excuses found: The first had Oxen which he never saw, And them he needs must go to prove and draw. The second had a Purchase newly made, And begs his Patience till his Ground's survey'd: The third his Bride had just conducted home, For him, he cou'd not, nor he wou'd not come: The rest dispatch'd the Messengers employ'd. Justly enrag'd, the King th'ungrate destroy'd, And sends his Servants, worthier Guests to find, Who bring the Poor, the Lame, the Maim'd, the Blind. Amidst the crowded Room a Wretch appears, Who in contempt a sordid Garment wears. The King commands to seize, and bind him fast, And into Dungeons deep, and utter Darkness cast. XLVI. St. Matth. Chap. XXII. Ver. 19, 20, 21. The Question of the Pharisees concerning Tribute, answer'd. The Herodians and the Pharisees combine, T'intrap our Lord was their accurs'd design, And thus accost him—Rabbi! well we know Thou dost the Way of Truth to Mortals show: To Fear a Stranger, Vice thou dost not spare, Despise the Mean, nor for the Greatest care. Inform us then, shall we to Cæsar pay, Whom now compell'd the chosen Race obey, That Tribute which with harsh and rig'rous Hand, His impious Publicans of us demand? Their Wickedness from him they could not hide, Who all things knows, and cautious thus reply'd: You Hypocrites! in vain, why tempt you me? The question'd Tribute-Money let me see! They brought a Piece, he asks 'em whose the Coin, And whose th'Inscription? Cæsar's they rejoin. To Cæsar, whence Protection they receive, He bids 'em pay his Due, to God they God's must give. XLVII. St. Matth. Ch. XXIV. Ver. 3, to 30 The Signs of Christ's coming to Judgment. On lofty Olivet, beneath the shade, Whence the devoted City he survey'd; Our Saviour sat, th'Apostles him attend, And ask'd him, trembling, when the World must End, And he to Judgment come? He thus replies, —Be not deceiv'd, for Nation first must rise, Encount'ring Nation, Plagues and Famine reign, But the beginning of their hopeless Pain. Ev'n you, my Friends, who Heav'n's Commands obey, Hated of all, and all shall you betray. The spatious Globe my sacred Law must hear, And then prepare, for then the End is near: The Sun shall to eternal Shades descend, The Moon her shorter Year for ever end: The Son of Man amidst the Clouds appear, And all the conscious Earth shall shake for fear; Th'Angelic Guards discharge their weighty Trust, And from a flaming World collect and save the Just. XLVIII. St. Matth. Chap. XXV. Ver. 1, to 12. The Parable of the wise and foolish Virgins. Ten Virgins fair one Roof did entertain, One half were Wise, the other Fond and Vain: All went to meet the Bridegroom and the Bride, The Wise their Golden Lamps with Oyl supply'd: Th'imprudent, careless, tho' their Lamps were dry, 'Twas time enough they thought Recruits to buy: But while the Bridegroom on the Road did stay, Tir'd with their Journey, and his long Delay, Inglorious Sleep did all the Ten surprise, And heavy-laden Slumbers seal'd their Eyes; When loe, a Midnight Cry—The Bridegroom's near, He comes, he comes, his Harbingers are here: In haste they rose, their Lamps they all prepare, Those of the Wise shone sparkling, bright and fair. The Foolish wou'd have borrow'd of the Wise, But ask in vain, their Oyl wou'd but suffice: Arrives the Bridegroom, while they went for more His ready Guests receives, and shuts the Door; The other came at length, but came too late, And mourn in midnight Shades their own unhappy Fate. XLIX. St. Matth. Chap. XXV. Ver. 15, 16, 17, 18. The Talents entrusted with the faithful and slothful Servants. A Lord e'er he to distant Regions goes, Among his Servants wou'd his Goods dispose; Five Talents one, the second two receives, A single Talent to the last he gives. The Two, so well in Trade the Stock he lent Improv'd, they gain'd their Master Cent. per Cent. The Third, with lazy Stubborness and Pride, His useless Talent in the Ground did hide: The Lord return'd, and strict Enquiry made, What each had gain'd by Barter and by Trade: The faithful Servants, who improv'd their Store, He praises, honours, and entrusts with more; But bids the barren Talent take agen, And give to him who rais'd his Five to Ten. Th'ungrateful unimproving Servant's thrown In Dungeons deep, where Light and Joy's unknown; Where solid Wo, and Death and Darkness reign, And Wretches gnash their Teeth, and gnaw their Tongues for pain. L. St. Matth. Chap. XXV. Ver. 31, 32, 33. The Description of the last Judgment. The Son of Man with all his Glory crown'd, His Father's menial Angels waiting round; High in Mid-Heav'n his radiant Throne, shall come, And to the trembling World pronounce their Doom. On his Right-Hand shall then the Sheep be seen, The Goats o'th' Left, how vast a Gulf between! Then to the Just—O of my Father bless'd! Come, come to Joy, and Peace, and endless Rest! Me, in my Poor, you did on Earth relieve, Now in requital all my Heav'n I give, But to th'Unjust with angry Frowns he'll say, From Bliss and me, ye curs'd, Depart away, To Flames prepar'd for impious Spir'ts that fell; 'Tis you who chuse it, and must share their Hell. To me you in my Friends were once unkind, No Mercy shew'd, nor Mercy hope to find: These shall depart to boundless, hopeless Pain, The Just in Life, and Bliss, and endless Glory reign. LI. St. Matth. Chap. XXVI. Ver. 17, 18, 19. Christ sends his Disciples to provide the Passover. And now the sacred Festal Day took place, Which banisht Leaven from the chosen Race: The Twelve our Lord address, and ask him, Where They shou'd for him the Paschal Feast prepare? Who strait did to the crowded City send Bold Cephas, and his Zebedean Friend: Where from the Brook you see a Man return, And Water bear in no capacious Urn, Follow, says he, his steps, and thus accost, As my Embassadors, the courteous Host: “The Master saith, this Day I'll be thy Guest, “And with thee celebrate the Paschal Feast. He'll you to a fair furnish'd Chamber guide, Make ready there, and what we want, provide. They went, and all things found as he declar'd, And soon the Wine, and Bread, and sacred Lamb prepar'd. LII. St. Matth. Chap. XXVI. Ver. 20, 21, 22, 23. The Passover eaten, and the Betrayer foretold. In a large Room prepar'd for such a Guest, The Master celebrates the Paschal Feast; Himself, for so his Father did ordain, Th'unspotted Lamb for our Offences slain, Whose Memory he bids his Friends retain, (Till Heav'n restores the Substance for the Sign) In Feasts of mystic Bread and sacred Wine: Tho' first, as all the Twelve around him sate, Deep musing on his near-approaching Fate; He thus—O can it (yet it must) be true! The Son of Man's betray'd by one of you. Name, name the Monster, or some Signal give, They all reply, he not deserves to live. He did, the lurking Traitor soon is shown, The false Iscariot he, no more unknown: As soon he's by th'invading Fiend possest, And Seeds of Murder fill his avaritious Breast. LIII. St. Matth. Chap. XXVI. Ver. 48, 49, 50, 51. Judas betrays Christ to the Priests. While Judas with the Priests his Death conspires, To sweet Gethsemane our Lord retires: The favour'd three Disciples, as before, He with him leads, the others Guard the Door; Nor Guard it long, while there he kneel'd and pray'd, E'er distant murm'ring Sounds their Ears invade, And glaring Light disturb'd the solemn Shade: Lanthorns and Torches at the length appear, And swiftly raise the Hill; they cry, they're here! The murd'ring Band approach: our Lord who knew, And dar'd the worst their barb'rous Rage cou'd do, Advanc'd to meet 'em; by the Traitor found, And with a Kiss betray'd, he's seiz'd and bound. Nor Cephas this, who drew his shining Blade, And thro' the thickest at the Traitor made; But missing him, the Blow on Malchus fell, And lop'd his Ear: our Lord his forward Zeal Reproves, and did the wounded Servant heal. But when they saw their Master captive led, Like Sheep their Shepherd slain, th'Apostles trembling fled. LIV. St. Matth. Chap. XXVI. Ver. 57, to the End. The Arraignment of our Saviour, who is deny'd by Peter. 'Twas Night, nor wou'd the Moon her Beams display, Unwilling to behold so black a Day: When to the Sanhedrim our Lord they brought, And perjur'd Evidence against him sought; But sought in vain, their Witness can't agree, Till him the Pontiff charg'd with Blasphemie, Confess'd the Son of God: his fearful Train Dispers'd in Caves and secret Shades remain. But Cephas, who each Path and Turning knew, Did by long winding Ways his Steps pursue: Trembling at last, and scarce himself for Fear, He mingles with the Crowd, th'Event to hear. Yet he who lately wou'd for him have dy'd, As he foretold, his Master thrice deny'd. The Saviour turn'd, and mildly did reprove, With silent Looks of kind Complaint and Love; Which pierc'd his secret Soul, nor needed more, With bitter Grief he did his Crimes deplore, And wash'd his Breast in Tears far whiter than before. LV. St. Matth. Chap. XXVII. Ver. 21, to 28. Christ deliver'd bound to Pilate, and led to his Passion. Bound and abus'd, our patient Lord they bear To Pilate's Palace, and accuse him there: He strives in vain the Innocent to save, The clam'rous Crowd a Murderer will have, A Murd'rer and a Rebel, then in Bands Before the Prince of Life he wash'd his Hands To shew him guiltless of the Blood was shed, (Ah vain Lustration!) then he dooms him dead: And now to mournful Calvary he's led, Fainting beneath his Crosses pond'rous Load, Blood from his Shoulders marking all the Road. But Saviour! who can tell thy Suff'rings there? A sight the conscious Sun deny'd to bear: Low at thy Cross we'll mourn, nor thence remove, But write in Tears our Grief, as thou in Blood thy Love. LVI. St. Matth. Chap. XXVIII. Ver. 2, to the End. Christ risen from the dead, appears to his Disciples. Sorrows be gone! no longer we'll deplore; Our Lord is risen, we must sigh no more: See him on Tabor his Disciples meet, With doubtful trembling Joy they kiss his Feet! What Love, what Awe, what Majesty and Grace! Dazling his Form, ineffable his Face; To me, he said, by my Great Father's giv'n, Won by my Death, the Pow'r of Earth and Heav'n. Go then, for thus I your Commission sign, Disciple all the World, and make 'em mine; Baptize, that they a Right to Bliss may claim, In the mysterious Triad's sacred Name. Nor this alone your Care; Instruct 'em too, What e'er from me you've learnt, t'observe and do. My constant Care and Love shall you defend Till utmost End of Time, but these shall know no End. St. MARK the Evangelist. The GOSPEL according to St. MARK. Our Saviour's Acts, in brief, St. MARK recites, The Baptist's sacred Mission first he writes. The Palsy'd, and the wither'd Hand restor'd: The Seed: A hellish Legion flies our Lord: Him his ungrateful Countrymen despise: By Herod's cruel Sword the Baptist dies. Of Hands unwasht. The Loaves. Christ's Death reveal'd. Divorcement. Children; and the Blind is heal'd. With Triumph to Jerusalem he rode, The Vineyard; Dues to Cæsar, and to God. The Temple's Ruins, and the World's Decay. Th'accursed Judas does his Lord betray: Accus'd, condemn'd, amidst two Thieves he dies, But does to Life by his own Pow'r arise; To native Realms of Light returns again, And does, at God's Right-Hand, in endless Glory reign. LVIII. St. Mark Chap. I. Ver. 16, to 20. Simon, Andrew, James and John call'd to be Disciples. As Jesus walk'd along the yielding Sand, Where dying Billows wash'd the Verge of Land, Two Fishers on the Lake he chanc'd to see, And awfully commands 'em—Follow me; Fishers of Men I'll you hereafter make, For thousands you with friendly Guile shall take. Nor far he coasted on the Waters side, E're he another friendly Pair espy'd; James, and the favour'd John, who at his call, Struck with a sacred Awe, their Nets let fall, (For those they mending sat) their Bark forsake, And to a nobler Work themselves betake; Their careful Father, with the Servants leave, Amongst his humble Train does them our Lord receive. LIX. St. Mark Chap. IV. Ver. 3, to 8. The Parable of the Sower, and its Explanation. Our Lord in Parables his Law reveals To docil Minds, which justly he conceals From those with Pride and Stubbornness possest, And seal'd for Death; in this among the rest. A Sower went his fertile Glebe to sow, And precious Seed, with Care, did round him throw: Some fell upon th'uncultivated Way, To rav'nous hov'ring Fowls a speedy Prey: Some fell on shallow Earth, and stony Ground, But wither'd soon, no Depth of Root it found; Others with churlish Thorns was choak'd and lost, Nor pay'd the lab'ring Hind his Pains and Cost: Some, tho' alas too little, prosper'd well, For on prepar'd and grateful Ground it fell. The Seed's the Word, the Fowls the watchful Fiend, With his black rav'nous Train, who strait descend And all devour: What falls on Stones, are those Who leave the Gospel, if the World oppose: Riches and Cares the Thorns that choak the Field: Those on good Ground, who hear, and Fruit with Patience yield. LX. St. Mark Chap. IV. Ver. 21, to 33. Parables of the hidden Candle, the Husbandman, and the Mustard-seed. To what's the heav'nly Kingdom like, or where Can ought be found we may therewith compare? —'Tis like a painful Husbandman, which goes And choicest Seed in well-laid Furrows sows; Nor does the Crop deceive his careful Plough, But springs with secret Growth, he knows not how, Yet when the Harvest's ripe, he sends and shears, And lays it up for barren fruitless Years. 'Tis like a Grain of Mustard-seed; when sown How small! But when 'tis burgeon'd, and 'tis grown, It soon of all its Fellow-Trees takes place, And stands the Giant of the shrubby Race. Under a Bed if you a Lamp restrain, It blazes to it self, and wasts in vain. Your Light before the wond'ring World must shine, So clear and wide that all may own you mine; Around the House project a borrow'd Day, And chase the gloomy Night and sullen Shades away. LXI. St. Mark Chap. IV. Ver. 37, 38, 39. The Tempest still'd. A sudden Tempest on the Lake did rise, And whirl the working Billows to the Skies. The Bark, which did far more than Cæsar bear, (For he who spred the spatious Globe was there; Tho' sleeping in the narrow Cabin laid) Work'd hard for Life, ev'n Cephas was afraid, The steersman left his Helm, and Judas pray'd, The stagg'ring Vessel now had shipp'd a Wave, They sink, and sinking cry—O Master save! He 'rose unmov'd, for all within was Peace, Chides the mad Waves, and bids their Tumults cease; Rebukes the Winds, which soon forgat to roar, And all the murm'ring Billows kiss'd the shoar. Then blames their want of Faith; amaz'd they say, What more than Man is this, whom Winds and Seas obey! LXII. St. Mark Chap. VI. Ver. 7, to 13. The Twelve sent forth to teach and work Miracles. In friendly Pairs the Twelve their Master sent, And thus Instructions gave 'em e're they went: —Against your Journey no Provision make, No Scrip, nor Bread, nor useless Money take: A Staff, one Coat, and Sandals will suffice, Who sends you will not let you want supplies: Light for your walk, and mean and simply drest, It suits your Message, and your Master best. But wo to those the proffer'd Grace refuse, You and your Mission slight, or else abuse: Unnatural Sodom met a milder Fate, Than does for these at the great Audit wait. Commission'd thus, th'Apostles haste away, The murm'ring Fiends their pow'rful Voice obey, And quit those Holds where long entrench'd they lay: Their Hands Diseases chase, their Words do more, Long-rooted Sins eject, and vitious Souls restore. LXIII. St. Mark Chap. VI. Ver. 49, 50, 51. Christ walks on the Sea, and stills the Tempest. While in the lonely Desart Jesus stay'd, And all the Night to him who sent him pray'd. Th'Apostles, whom, embark'd, he sent before, Were working hard to make the distant shore: With many a fruitless Board; the storm grew high, And fighting Whirlwinds mingled Earth and Sky. Dark was the Night, as that which did of old, In Hell-born mists th'Egyptian Realms infold; No chearful Pleiades, nor watchful Bear, Did to th'Apostles thro' the Clouds appear, To guide their Course, nor was their Master there. —At length he came his faithful Friends to save, And treads with steddy Feet the slipp'ry Wave. Passing the Ship a glimpse of Light he threw, Which pierc'd the shades; at this imperfect view Th'Apostles thought they saw some wand'ring Ghost Of one upon the Lake in Tempests lost. A general Cry they raise, their causless Fear Our Lord did soon remove with—I am here! Entring the Bark, his Words the Winds command, They make the happy Port, and seize the welcom Land. LXIV. St. Mark Chap. VII. Ver. 32, to 35. The deaf Stammerer miraculously recover'd. Now Tyre's proud Walls and faithless Coast he leaves, And Galilee again our Lord receives. When with a hapless Youth to him they come, Fair and of gentle Looks, but Deaf and Dumb; Whom from the gazing Crowd he first convey'd, Then, mov'd with mortal Labors, sigh'd and said, (His Eyes to Heav'n, whence all good Gifts proceed) From thy Infirmities be loos'd and freed; The String which held his Tongue imprison'd brake, His Ears were open'd, and he heard and spake: To his glad Friends did him our Lord restore, Enjoyning Silence, but they spake the more; Throughout th'astonish'd Land the Wonder tell, And all confess he has done all things well: The Deaf his Words relieve, the Dead are rais'd, And Tongues, unus'd before, the heav'nly Healer prais'd. LXV. St. Mark Chap. VIII. Ver. 6, 7, 8. The Miracle of the seven Loaves and a few Fishes. Of old the FATHER in the Desart fed His chosen Flock with Angels tastful Bread; The SON does a resembling Care express, And feeds with Wonders in the Wilderness. —Where now vast Crowds around him fainting lay, As helpless Sheep without their Shepherd stray. With Pity mov'd, th'Apostles Faith he try'd, And bids 'em for his famish'd Guests provide. Surpriz'd they answer—Where and whence the Food, In barren Wilds for such a Multitude? Searching their Stores, but seven small Loaves they found: He seats the weary People on the Ground, Great Nature's Board, with grassy Carpets spred. Then taking in his sacred Hands the Bread; In equal Parts divides, when first he had blest, And his Disciples reach to every Guest; A few small Fishes clos'd the heavenly Feast: All were suffic'd, yet from th'encreasing Store, The Wonder multiply'd, as did the Loaves before. LXVI. St. Mark Chap. XI. Ver. 12, 13, 14. The barren Fig-tree cursed. Long abstinent, our Lord to faint began, For such his Frame, in all but Sin, like Man: As chanc'd a Fig-tree near the Road he spy'd, Whose verdant Leaves, and Boughs extended wide, Oft call'd the weary Trav'ler from his Way, And promis'd Fruit they never meant to pay. Thither he goes, the Tree his Hopes deceives, And nothing found he there but tastless Leaves: No Fruit, he said, hereafter on thee grow, Nor shalt thou more deceive with empty show: When from the Town i'th' Morning they return'd, Th'Apostles saw it wither'd, sear'd, and burn'd, As blasted with the Lightnings piercing Flame, Or Winds that from the sultry Desart came. With Wonder struck—How soon 'tis gone, they cry'd! Is this so strange, our Lord again reply'd? Have but firm Faith in God, you All things may, This Mountain bid remove, this Mountain shall obey. LXVII. St. Mark Chap. XII. Ver. 42, 43, 44. The Widow and her two Mites. As in the Womens Court our Lord was plac't, And saw the Gifts were into Corban cast; Handfuls of Gold, which they take care to show To all around, the Rich profusely throw; So large, as tho' they thought just Heav'n to move, And buy their Pardons in the Court above: When now the wealthier Crowd had left the Place, A needy Widow with dejected Face Offer'd her two poor Mites, 'twas all her store, And blush'd, and inward sigh'd, she had no more. Nor unconcern'd did this our Saviour see, But prais'd the Widow's generous Poverty: The rest but their superfluous Wealth had thrown, Nor wou'd their Coffers miss it when 'twas gone: To her two Mites, their Talents were but small, For more she could not give, who freely gave her ALL. LXVIII. St. Mark Chap. XIII. Ver. 1, to the End. The Destruction of the Temple foretold. As thro' the lofty Eastern Gate they go, Our Lord the Temple his Disciples show; What Stones, what Building's here, how Firm, how Vast! Sure these as long as Time itself must last. To whom our Lord—Such flatt'ring Hopes away! The Day approaches fast, the dreadful Day When all this lofty Pile that threats the Sky Shall bury'd in its own vast Ruins lie. Trembling, they ask him when, and what the Sign? —Nation shall against Nation first combine; Rumours of Wars the guilty World affright, The Heav'ns be fill'd with many a fearful Sight: In Earth's dark Caverns struggling Whirlwinds meet, The hollow Ground shake underneath your Feet. But when the holy Place profan'd you see, Look not behind, but to the Mountains flee. From Fields and Houses-tops fly swift away, Nor for your unavailing Treasure stay. Till then, be on your Guard with cautious Fear, Lest when you least expect, the Son of Man appear. LXIX. St. Mark Chap. XIV. Ver. 3, 4, 5, 6. Mary Magdalen with her Box of Ointment. At wealthy Simon's pleasant Country-Seat, Where oft our Lord did with the Twelve retreat; Their courteous Host a Banquet did prepare, And beauteous Magdalena's self was there: With Love and Grief contending in her Breast, The Penitent approach'd their heav'nly Guest: A Vial of the purest Nard she brought, That e'er for thrice its weight of Gold was bought, Which o'er his Head she broke, the rich Perfume Diffusing all Arabia round the Room. False Judas strait with Indignation cry'd, This Waste might to the Poor have been apply'd. Blame not (our Lord rejoyns) her pious Care, Against my Fun'ral she did this prepare; The Poor you always have, (but I must go) And when you please, to them may Pity show: Whilst the good Deeds this Penitent has wrought, Shall thro' the World be with my Gospel taught, As long as Earth remains, or as the Sun Shall round the radiant Belt his glorious Circle run. LXX. St. Mark Chap. XVI. Ver. 2, to 8. The Resurrection of Christ declared by an Angel to three Women. Scarce had the sober Morning's doubtful Ray Beckon'd the Sun and warn'd the Shades away, When the two Maries went with pious Care T'anoint their Master in the Sepulchre: Concern'd, as thro' the silent Shades they come, To move the pond'rous Stone which clos'd the Tomb. That Care was vain, their kind celestial Friend Had roll'd it thence, they to the Vault descend; When loe, a Form adorn'd with heav'nly Grace. Immortal Youth sat smiling in his Face: In long white Robes of purest Æther made, And his own native Light and Flame array'd; And to the trembling Women thus he said. —I know your Cares, dispel your causless Fear, Jesus you seek, he's Risen, he's not here. The joyful News to his Disciples bear, For Galilee he's gone, to meet 'em there. They went, but till they to th'Apostles come, To none the Vision tell, Amazement struck 'em dumb. LXXI. St. Mark Chap. XVI. Ver. 9, 10, 11. The Appearance of Christ to Mary Magdalen. Again did Magdalena now repair, Unto the Tomb to seek her Treasure there: Distract with Fear and Love, she can't believe The Witness ev'n an Angel's self did give; But leaning o'er the Vault her beauteous Head, Survey'd again the Chambers of the Dead; And when the Body there no more appears, Washes the Place, as once his Feet, with Tears. —Behind her now a sudden noise she hears, Startled she turns, and glimm'ring thro' the Leaves, Something that seem'd of human Form perceives, Which kindly ask'd her, Why she wept, and whom She sought so near the solitary Tomb? Who Joseph's Gard'ner him supposing said, O tell, tell me, where my Lord you've laid. —MARY, he said, the Master's Voice she knew, And at his glorious Feet herself in Transports threw. LXXII. St. Mark Chap. XVI. Ver. 19, 20. The Ascension. And now to well-known Bethany he goes, And leads the small but faithful Flock he chose; Imperfect yet, with Expectations vain, On Israel's Throne to see their Master reign: They ask if now the Sceptre he'd restore To Judah's Race, and let 'em serve no more? Seek not, he says, with bold and curious Eye Into th'Arcana of high Heav'n to pry; But wait till the bless'd Spirit descend, and you With equal Pow'rs for your great Works endue, I go, but he shall ever with you dwell, Thus you I bless, and bid you thus Farewel! He says, and instantaneous shoots away To his own native joyous Realms of Day; They greedy after gaze, and sigh to find Their Master gone, themselves expos'd behind: But with his Promise cheer'd, though't long they mourn'd, Their Faith and Joy receiv'd, they to the Town return'd. St. LUKE the Evangelist. The GOSPEL according to St. LUKE. Behold St. LUKE, in neat and courtly Stile, Correct and clean our Saviour's Acts compile: He tells how Gabriel to the Virgin came, The Baptist's strange Conception, and his Name. Our Saviour's Birth, his Harbinger, his Line, Temptation, Conquest, Preaching, Pow'r divine. The Ears of Corn, the Twelve: The Dead are rais'd, The Baptist, and the Woman's Faith is prais'd. The Sow'r. The Twelve, and then the Seventy sent, His Pray'r: He bids the Pharisees repent. Weak mortal Rage, and persecuting Hate, His must despise, the broad and narrow Gate. The Dropsy heal'd, the Prodigal returns, The Beggar crown'd with Bliss, and Dives burns. Offence. The Widow. With Zaccheus staid Our Lord; and silent all his Tempters made. The Widow's Mite. The Saviour is betray'd. Unjustly doom'd, with Patience Death receives, Rais'd the third Day, ascends, in Bliss for ever lives. LXXIV. St. Luke Chap. I. Ver. 11, 12, 13. An Angel appears to Zacharias, and foretels the Birth of John. Long e're the impious Myst'ry did begin, Or holy Marriage yet was made a Sin; A virtuous Pair there liv'd, of Aaron's Race, Who did not their illustrious Stem disgrace: He Zacharias call'd, Eliza she, Renown'd for ancient Faith and Piety: So fair their Life, that no malicious Tongue The Fame of either durst attempt to wrong. All Blessings Heav'n, besides an Heir, had sent, Since Heav'n deny'd, they were, without, Content. As he with Incense did, and Pray'rs, atone Th'Almighty King for Errors, not his own; An Angel came in Curls of Incense down, And promis'd him an unexpected Son. Too big for Faith the News at first appear'd, He asks a Sign, and his Request is heard; The Sign did his mild Punishment become, Until the Angel's Word perform'd, remaining Dumb. LXXV. St. Luke Chap. I. Ver. 42, 43, 44. The Salutation of Elizabeth to the Virgin Mary. When Gabriel had the wond'rous News convey'd, Of God incarnate to the sacred Maid; By him instructed, she departs to see The pregnant Wife of aged Zacharie. Nor sooner were their first Embraces done, When thus Elizabeth inspir'd begun: Thrice bless'd art thou, Belov'd, and full of Grace, Above our weakly Mother's frailer Race. And bless'd the Fruit of thy illustrious Womb: Why shou'd the Mother of my Saviour come To visit one beneath her least Regard? When first thy Voice, thy dear-lov'd Voice, I heard, The Babe within me leap'd at ev'ry Word, And Homage paid to his approaching Lord. And bless'd is she whose noble Faith like thine, Yields full assent to Truth and Power divine; No Sign requir'd, but gen'rously believ'd His Word who can't deceive, nor be Himself deceiv'd. LXXVI. St. Luke Chap. I. Ver. 60, to 64. John nam'd, and Zacharias restor'd to his Speech. At length Eliza sees her destin'd Son, Who must before the King of Glory run. Seven Days, entire, he in her Bosom lies, On th'eighth, as Moses bids, they circumcise: The solemn festal Morn shone bright and fair, They all things for the sacred Rite prepare; Their Friends came crowding in, the Priest was there, He bids 'em Name the Child, they all agree, The Father's 'twas, it must be Zacharie. Inspir'd, his Mother her Consent deny'd; They yield, the aged Sire the Doubt decide. He signs, a Table's brought, and he thereon To their amazement writes—His Name is JOHN; Tho' the Spectators were far more amaz'd, When he with Voice restor'd, aloud th'Almighty prais'd. LXXVII. St. Luke Chap. II. Ver. 10, to 14. The Nativity of Christ declar'd by an Angel to Shepherds. In Bethlehem's happy Regions, where of old The Royal Shepherd wont his Flocks to fold, The same Employ the Swains did waking keep, From Thieves and midnight Wolves to guard their Sheep. The Queen of Night high mounted on her Throne, Had now thro' half her silent Journey run, When loe the East far lovelier Beams adorn, Than guild the Evening Clouds or rising Morn; And on a Globe of pure etherial Flame, Descending slow, a Heav'nly Courtier came: Groveling on Earth, th'affrighted Swains he rears, And bids 'em banish their mistaken Fears, Never such cause of Joy: This happy Morn The promis'd Saviour of the World is born: To Bethlehem haste, you'll find him there, he said, Nurst in a Cave, and in a Manger laid. —Strait, Myriads of the Heav'nly Host appear, And crowd with shining Forms the Hemisphere; This Anthem sung by all the Quire above, Glory to GOD on high, to Mortals Peace and Love. LXXVIII. St. Luke Chap. II. Ver. 15, 16, 17. Jesus in the Manger, visited by the Shepherds. With Joy and Wonder fill'd, the Shepherds run At early Dawn, to seek a brighter Sun Than e'er before enlighten'd mortal Eyes: But, O! astonish'd Heavens! see where he lies: That Voice which shakes the Poles, to Infant-cries Is now contracted; those Almighty Hands Which launch th'unerring Thunder, wrapt in feeble Bands: And he who turn'd the shining Orbs above, Which, as his Nod prescribes 'em, stand or move; When he comes down our ruin'd World to save, Is shelter'd in a Stable, and a Cave. By him his Virgin-Mother watching there, Nothing, besides her Son, on Earth so fair. O, what a sight! with new and strange amaze, Well may the Shepherds look, when Angels gaze. They saw, and slowly part, and what they found, They soon disperse th'astonish'd Land around: With Hymns from Seraphs learnt, his Name they raise, Whom holy Souls adore, Fiends dread, and Angels praise. LXXIX. St. Luke Chap. II. Ver. 28, to 32. Our Saviour presented, and good old Simeon's Nunc dimittis. Now to the Temple they our Lord convey, Two Turtle-Doves, as Moses bids, to pay: When loe, an aged Sire accosts 'em there, Simeon his Name, his Head with silver Hair Was venerably crown'd, whose pious Zeal To recompense, an Angel did reveal He shou'd not die, nor cou'd he freely rest Until his Saviour's Sight his Eyes had blest. He came, in his glad Arms the Child he takes With Tears of Joy, and thus his Silence breaks: —Lord, let thy Servant now in Peace depart, Whose aged Eyes have seen what joys his Heart; Thy wish'd Salvation, now no more confin'd To Judah's Land, or Jacob's chosen Kind; But for the universal Globe prepar'd, To be alike by all the Faithful shar'd: A Light to Gentiles, who in darkness dwell, The Glory and the Pride of thy lov'd Israel. LXXX. St. Luke Chap. II. Ver. 46, to 49. Jesus found Disputing with the Doctors in the Temple. When Childhood past, and blooming Youth begun, Unto the sacred Town their Heav'n-born Son His pious Parents brought, a glorious Guest, Himself the Lamb, to their great Paschal Feast. To God's high Temple he did soon repair, Not unimploy'd, nor idly gazing there, But went where learned Hillel fill'd the Chair; High rais'd the Sanhedrim and Doctors round, Below th'attentive Audience on the Ground: Silent a while our Saviour sat, but rose. At length, and did his weighty Doubts propose. The Reverend Fathers with amazement heard His stronger Judgment to their own preferr'd: Here by his careful Parents found, who mourn'd His Loss, and searching to the Town return'd: His Mother asks him, Why so long he staid, And both uneasy with his Absence made? —Why shou'd you seek me, he replys: And where But to my Father's House shou'd I repair, In whose bless'd Service I my Hours have spent? Amaz'd they silent stood, unknowing what he meant. LXXXI. St. Luke Chap. V. Ver. 8, 9, 10. Promise to the Disciples that they shall be Fishers of Men. Tracing the Lake, on utmost Verge of Land, Two fishing Barks, their Crew upon the Sand Washing their Nets, our Saviour did perceive, But Simon wou'd not his small Vessel leave; Casting his Net, tho' still without Success: Our Saviour, whom the num'rous Crowd did press, Enters his Bark, and bids no longer keep Th'unfaithful Sholes, but launch and try the Deep. What can we hope, he says, but fruitless Pain, Where all the Night we've toil'd, and toil'd in vain? Yet at thy Word we'll try, and as he spake They cast, and such a num'rous Draught they take, As did almost unpeople half the Lake: The glutted Net, as o'er the waste 'tis haul'd, Breaks with the bulk; his Partners Simon call'd, And both their Boats they fill'd unto the Brink, Till over-freighted, both begin to sink: Astonish'd, Peter kneel'd, and thus began, Depart from me, for I'm a sinful Man! Fear not, but follow me, our Lord replys, Henceforth you Men shall take, their Souls a nobler Prize. LXXXII. St. Luke Chap. VII. Ver. 12, to 15 The Widow's dead Son restor'd to Life. As he thro' Galilee his Course did bend, And on his steps uncounted Crowds attend, A Crowd as large they meet at Naim's Gate, The empty'd Town on a sad Coarse did wait; His Mother's only Son while Life was left, Of her dear Consort long before bereft: A mournful Pomp, solemn they march, and slow; Tho' fast the Tears from ev'ry Eye did flow; His Mother's most, nor hop'd, nor wish'd Relief, Or Ease for her intolerable Grief: Death only this, and Death she did implore, Since that wou'd her to her lov'd Son restore. With tender Pity mov'd—Lament no more, Our Saviour said, then fix'd his Hands and Eyes Upon the Bier, and bids the Youth arise: From Death he 'rose, and robb'd th'expecting Grave, And him our Lord to his glad Mother gave: Th'astonish'd People all were fill'd with Dread, And round the bord'ring Coasts the wond'rous Tidings spread. LXXXIII. St. Luke Chap. VII. Ver. 37, 38, 39. Christ's Feet anointed by a sinful, but penitent Woman. Rich Simon did a splendid Feast provide, Nor there his Company our Lord deny'd; A Woman heard, and weeping enter'd in, Whose vitious Soul had long been stain'd with Sin. Behind she kneel'd, as one who dar'd not meet Our Saviour's Eyes, and wash'd with Tears his Feet, Then softly dries 'em with her lovely Hair, And trembling kiss'd; nor this her only Care, Them with rich Oyl anoints. Who made the Feast Thus censures to himself his Heav'nly Guest: Had he a Prophet been, he'd ne'er endure The Touch of one so sinful and impure: Our Lord who reads his inmost Thoughts as plain As he himself, to Simon thus began: —A Creditor two Debtors chanc'd to have, Insolvent both, and frankly both forgave: The greater ow'd five hundred Pence, the least But fifty: Tell me which will love him best: He whom he most forgave, his Host reply'd. Our Lord—Thou rightly dost the Case decide: This Woman's Sins were great, her Love was more, And thus I Peace to her repenting Soul restore. LXXXIV. St. Luke Chap. IX. Ver. 23, to 26. The patient bearing of the Cross enjoyn'd to the Disciples. Our Lord his Passion to the Twelve declares, And thus against approaching Ills prepares. —No golden Dreams of Pleasure entertain, Vain Fantoms all, your flatt'ring Hopes are vain. If you'd my Crown, you must my Suff'rings share, Who wou'd come after me his Cross must bear; Altho' a shameful 'tis, and pond'rous Load, And mark with Tracks of Blood the thorny Road. Who e'er his Master thus to own denies, Who e'er inglorious from the Combat flies; Him will I justly at the last great Day Renounce, and send to endless Flames away: But he who boldly me confesses here, When in my Father's Glory I appear, Thron'd on his blissful Side the Angels near, Him there I'll own, my faithful Friends confess'd, Before th'unnumber'd Hosts, and Myriads of the Bless'd. LXXXV. St. Luke Chap. X. Ver. 25, to 30. The Traveller falling among Thieves. A captious Lawyer tempts our Lord in vain, And asks the way eternal Bliss to gain. What does the sacred Page you teach contain, Returns our Lord? To whom he thus rejoyn'd, We there are taught, with Heart, and Soul, and Mind, With utmost Strength and Thoughts, united Pow'r, To love th'All-High, whom Earth and Heav'n adore, Our Neighbour as ourself, there needs no more. Our Lord again replies; observe but this, Thou canst not fail of everlasting Bliss. He questions still—but who my Neighbour is? When Jesus thus, a Trav'ler once went down To Jericho, from Salem's sacred Town A hollow Vale between two Thickets lay, Where ruthless Men, the fiercest Beasts of Prey, In Covert lurk'd, him there they seiz'd and bound, And rifling left with many a ghastly Wound, (For small their Booty was) expiring on the Ground. LXXXVI. St. Luke Chap. X. Ver. 31, to 34. The Priest, the Levite, and the charitable Samaritan. A priest, as chanc'd, came next along the way And saw where in his Blood he welt'ring lay, But far from home, to help him could not stay. A Levite next a glance of Pity cast, But that was all, without Assistance past. Not so the third, who from Samaria drew His hated Birth; the wounded Wretch he knew; Mov'd with Compassion, went and rais'd his Head, Recall'd his fainting Spirits but newly fled With Cordial-Drops, his frightful Wounds he found, Rich Oyl and Wine infus'd, and gently bound; On his own Beast did to his Inn convey, And promis'd, what the Host expends, to pay. —Which of the three who on the Road did pass, Which, think you, the poor Trav'ler's Neighbour was? —The Lawyer—He who found him on the Road, And to the wounded Wretch Compassion show'd: Go thou and do the same, our Lord rejoyn'd, And Mercy show to all, as you wou'd Mercy find. LXXXVII. St. Luke Chap. X. Ver. 38, to 42. Martha entertains Christ. One Thing needful. Now, with his Twelve, the noisy Town he leaves, And Martha them at Bethany receives; Solicitous her Guest to entertain, While Mary still did at his Feet remain, And heard his Words; her Sister did complain That unemploy'd, she did for nothing care, But all the Toil and Business left to her; Entreats he'd bid her from his Feet be gone, Nor her unkindly leave to serve alone. To whom our Saviour mildly thus rejoyn'd, —How many things, my Friend, disturb your Mind! How little frugal Nature will suffice! What Pains and Care for needless Luxuries! One Thing is needful, O let that be sure, The Way to Bliss that ever shall endure: But Mary doth with happier Judgment choose, Hers is the better part, which she shall never lose. LXXXVIII. St. Luke Chap. XII. Ver. 17, to 20. The Rich Miser suddenly destroy'd. A wealthy Churl there was, who car'd for none Besides himself, and liv'd upon his own; From whose large Fields when plenteous Crops were giv'n, He thank'd his Dung and Ploughs, but ne'er thank'd Heav'n. So overgrown at length his hoarded Store, The crowded Granaries wou'd hold no more. With all his Fruits and Goods what shall he do? He'l pull down his old Barns, and build 'em new. To these enlarg'd he bids his Corn be led, And thus unto his sordid Soul he said: —Soul, take thine ease! I for the best advise, We're rich enough, and therefore must be wise: We ne'er can want, give to the Winds thy Fears, We've Corn and Gold laid up for many Years. We'll eat and drink, and revel every Day, Conscience we'll drown, and chase our Cares away. When loe a Voice like Thunder strikes his Ear From Heav'n, which ne'er before he knew to fear, “Thou Fool! this Night's thy last, and when thou'rt gone, “Then whose is all that Wealth thou now miscall'st thy own? LXXXIX. St. Luke Chap. XIV. Ver. 3, 4, 5, 6. Works of Charity break not the Sabbath. The Sabbath came, a Ruler calls our Lord, And seats him at his hospitable Board: A crowd of Pharisees and Lawyers went, And plac'd themselves around with curst intent, To watch each Word, that him they might betray, And at his Feet a poor Infirm they lay, Swoln with the Dropsy; nor unknown their spite To him who sees thro' deepest shades of Night. Who sounds 'em thus—Masters of Israel! say, Is't just to Heal on the seventh sacred Day? In doubtful silence they their Thoughts conceal'd, He touch'd th'Infirm, and as he touch'd he heal'd; Then thus resumes his Speech—Which of you All, Whose Ox or Ass into a Pit shall fall, Struggling for Life, wou'd not, without delay, Draw him from thence, tho' on the Sabbath Day? Confounded with the Force of Truth they stand, None cou'd a Word return to answer his Demand. XC. St. Luke Chap. XIV. Ver. 18, to 21. The Guests invited to the great Supper excuse themselves. A Lord there was who made a splendid Feast, Inviting thither many a thankless Guest; But to accept his Kindness all deny'd, This pleads his Oxen, that his Farm and Bride. The Servants come, and to their Master show Th'unkind Returns they met; he bids 'em go Thro' all the Streets and Lanes, whome'er they find, Inviting in; the Poor, the Lame, the Blind. They did, with joyful haste th'Invited come, Yet in his ample Palace still was room: Again he sends to search the Country round, The Hedges and Highways, and all they found With an obliging force his Guests to make, His House to fill, and no denial take: Since those who first were call'd, their Doom was past, Nor one of those Ungrate should of his Banquet tast. XCI. St. Luke Chap. XV. Ver. 4, 5, 6. The Parables of the lost Sheep, and piece of Silver. A hundred Sheep of pond'rous Fleece and Train, A Shepherd fed on Dothan's fertile Plain. Each Morn his Flock, and late at Ev'n survey'd, And mark'd with Care if ought diseas'd or stray'd: Yet one, by hopes of better Pasture led To distant barren Desarts wand'ring fled: Soon miss'd, the Shepherd ranges Hills and Dales, O'er craggy hanging Rocks and hollow Vales. Till he at length th'unhappy Straggler find, Too faint to go, 'tis on his Shoulders laid, And to the Fold again with Joy convey'd; His Friends and Neighbours are invited round, All must rejoyce, the wand'ring Sheep is found. Such Joy in Heav'n receives each friendly Mind, (Not unconcern'd at Cares of human Kind) When one poor Sinner here, whose Loss they mourn'd, To Virtue's shining Paths, and to himself return'd. XCII. St. Luke Chap. XV. Ver. 11, 12, 13. The prodigal Son leaves his Father's House. A good old Sire there was, whom Age and Cares Had bless'd with Wealth, and crown'd with silver Hairs. Two Sons he had, this careful of the main, The younger, wild, extravagant and vain; Yet he the Darling; which too well he knew, And only did his Sports and Mirth pursue. But tir'd at last with Home, he longs for change, His Pleasures now must have a larger range: His Portion giv'n, he'll not a moment stay, But to far distant Regions speeds away. See him encompass'd round with Harlots stand, How fast he makes his Fathers Bags disband! As fast dismiss'd his Conscience and his Shame, Learns to Treat high, to Revel, and to Game: See him to Balls, and Masks, and Musick run, To THEATRES at last, and then he's soon undone. XCIII. St. Luke Chap. XV. Ver. 16, to 19. The prodigal Son reduc'd to Misery. When all was spent, a dreadful Famine rose, And to a wealthy Citizen he goes; Who weary'd soon, desires his Friends excuse, One Place he had, which he must not refuse Till better fell, 'twou'd serve in Time of need, And many sought it—'twas his Swine to feed. What cannot fatal want of Bread persuade! Tho' Blushes his ingenuous Shame betray'd, He takes the servile Task, and waits the Swine, While they on envy'd Husks and Acorns dine. Till these suffic'd, he at a distance stood, Half-famish'd, wish'd to share their sordid Food. When loe! of heav'nly Light a cheerful Ray, To his dark Breast restor'd forgotten Day: To mind his injur'd Father's Image brought, And once, dear Home, a sadly pleasing Thought; He'll thither strait, if him his Limbs will bear, And perish if he must, resolve to perish there. XCIV. St. Luke Chap. XV. Ver. 20, 21, 22. The Prodigal returns: His reception by his Father. His Father saw him as he came, and ran, Embrac'd and kiss'd, and thus the Son began: —O Father! if 'tis lawful yet to claim An Int'rest in that dear, that injur'd Name, So great my Crimes against both Heav'n and thee; A Son no more, a Servant let me be! Too big the Parent's Joy to be exprest, My Son, he cry'd, and spake in Tears the rest, For sordid Rags in splendid Robes he's dress'd. A Banquet for his welcom they prepare, Nor want harmonious Songs and Music there: His Brother weary from the Field came home, And Sounds of Joy he heard in ev'ry Room, Wond'ring the Cause, he asks, which when he knew, He from the Gates with Indignation flew, His Father pleads, but more enrag'd he grew; “If thus a Prodigal must treated be, “Who wou'd be careful and a Slave like me? The Father thus—To thee my ALL I give; Long since, thy Brother did his Share receive: His second Birth-day shou'd with Joy be crown'd, Tho' Dead and Lost in Vice, he's now Alive, and Found. XCV. St. Luke Chap. XVI. Ver. 3, to 9. The Parable of the unjust Steward. A Lord there was whose Steward prov'd unjust, His Goods he wasted, and abus'd his Trust; He bids him strait for his Accounts prepare, What shall he do—perplex'd with anxious Care, Whither to go when him his Lord disclaim'd; He cannot Dig, and is to Beg asham'd? At length, resolv'd, he takes the wisest way, And thus provides against a rainy Day: For all his Master's Debtors strait he sent, And ask'd 'em what they ow'd in Goods or Rent: The First a Hundred Pound, he bids him take His Bill with speed, and only Fifty make. The rest the like:—so Worldly-wise are those Who here their Treasure and their Hopes repose: Not so the genuin Sons of Light appear, Born to be injur'd, trick'd, and cheated here. Yet they from hence may learn, and Friends secure, Which shall beyond this short-liv'd World endure; With earthly Mammon those in want relieve, Who on the Bounds of Bliss, shall them with Joy receive. XCVI. St. Luke Chap. XVI. Ver. 19, to 24 The Parable of the rich Glutton and Lazarus. A Lord there was of vast Estate and Pride, Whose Robes in Tyrian Purple doubly dy'd; Whose Linnen, nice and costly as his Fare, Might well with those of Eastern Kings compare: Ah! how unlike, a Wretch who at his Gate, Cover'd with Ulcers, for an Alms did wait, But waits in vain, nor wou'd they him afford The broken Reliques of their festal Board: At length he dies, and free'd from Pain and Care, Kind Angels him to Abr'ham's Bosom bear: Nor cou'd the other's Wealth exempt from Fate, He dies, and greedy Fiends his exit wait: From the dark Pit of Pain he rais'd his Eyes, Abr'ham and Laz'rus sees in Paradise; One drop of Water thence in vain desires, To cool his Tongue, when scorch'd amidst infernal Fires. XCLVII. St. Luke Chap. XVII. Ver. 12, to 17 Ten Lepers cleansed: the Samaritan only returns Thanks. A village which did Galilee divide From more abhor'd Samaria's Northern side, By chance receiv'd our Lord, as he came down From his own Fields, for Salem's sacred Town: Ten Lepers, an impure and odious Band, Descry'd him entring; they at distance stand, And—Jesus, Master, Help, aloud they cry; He bids 'em to the Priests themselves apply: Nor sooner they the Road for Salem took, But them the stubborn Malady forsook: One of the Ten who saw himself restor'd, Return'd immediate, and our Lord ador'd: He prais'd th'All-High for his mirac'lous Grace, Tho' he of curs'd Samaria's hated Race. Something of Wonder thus our Lord exprest, Were not Ten cleans'd, but where are all the rest? Not one, but this poor Stranger, Glory gives To God's Great Name, from whom he Health receives. —Thy Faith has sav'd thee, I thy Soul release From all its Sins and Fears, and bid thee—Go in Peace. XCVIII. St. Luke Chap. XVIII. Ver. 10, to 13 The Pharisee and Publican go to pray in the Temple. Two Suppliants to the Temple did repair, T'atone high Heav'n with Sacrifice and Pray'r. The one a Pharisee, who thus begins, And boasts his Virtues, but forgets his Sins. —I thank thee, Lord! a Vessel of thy Grace, Unlike th'abhor'd and reprobated Race, Unlike this Publican, that I am free From foul Extortion, and Adultery. To cheat thy Priests of Tithes I ne'er was known, And Fast for others Sins, but not my own. Far off, the Publican dejected stays, His guilty Eyes to Heav'n he dares not raise, But thus, contrite, with trembling Voice and low, —O God! to me, a Sinner, Mercy show. This humble Penitent acceptance gain'd, While the proud Pharisee in Wrath and Sin remain'd. XCIX. St. Luke Chap. XVIII. Ver. 35, to the End. The blind Man receives his Sight. As lab'ring Bees a doubtful Murmur make, Whose num'rous Troops their waxen Towns forsake; With such a Noise vast Crowds our Lord attend, When he to Jericho his steps did bend. This heard, a Wretch depriv'd of Sight, who sate To ask an Alms of those who pass'd the Gate; At whose Request the Standers-by declare The Cause, and tell him that our Lord was there: O Son of David, help! aloud he cry'd; His clam'rous Importunity they chide: Yet he persists, till him our Lord did hear, And bids 'em bring him; whom approaching near, He asks, what wilt thou? he again replies, Lord, since thou canst, restore me my dear Eyes: 'Tis granted, Jesus said, receive thy Sight, When strait his Eye-balls feel the cheerful Light; Our Lord he follow'd, who had him restor'd, And he and all that saw, prais'd, wonder'd, and ador'd. C. St. Luke Chap. XIX. Ver. 3, to 6. Zaccheus the believing Publican. Of Stature low, Zaccheus cou'd not see Our Lord amidst the Press, but climbs a Tree That grac'd the Road; as near it Jesus past, He saw him there, and bids descend with hast, This Day he at his House must be a Guest. With Joy and Speed he comes, and him receives, The envious Crowd around repines and grieves: Why shou'd a Prophet with his Presence grace A Sinner, of the Gentiles faithless Race? When to our Lord Zaccheus thus begins, Struck with a deep Remorse of all his Sins: To those I've wrong'd, I more than Thrice restore, And half my Goods I give to feed the Poor. To whom our Lord—Ev'n thou of Abraham's Line, Salvation's offer'd to thy self and thine; For this I came, those whom my Father gave, Lost in a sinful World to ransom, seek, and save. CI. St. Luke Chap. XXI. Ver. 25, 26, 27 Signs of the Coming of the Son of Man in Glory. Th' Apostles ask our Lord what Signs portend His Coming, and the World's approaching End: He thus—Impostors first shall rise, and claim A Title to the Great Messiah's Name: Rumours of Wars the guilty World affright, Prodigious Signs, and many a fearful Sight Glare in the Heav'ns, the Sun to darkness turn, The Moon and Stars, as cloth'd in Sackcloth mourn; The firmest Hearts shall fail with anxious Pain For Ills they feel, and Ills that yet remain: Well may the Earth with horrid Murmurs quake: When ev'n the Pow'rs of Heav'n themselves shall shake: With fervent Heat the Elements shall flow, Yon azure Vault with ruddy Vengeance glow: Then when the guilty World dissolves for fear, Look up with Joy, for your Redemption's near: Then shall you see the Son of Man appear Amidst the Clouds, the World's Great Judge confess'd, Circled with glitt'ring Hosts, and Myriads of the Bless'd. CII. St. Luke Chap. XXII. Ver. 41, to 44 Christ's Agony. He is strengthen'd by an Angel. 'Twas dead of Night, and thro' the solemn Shade, The Moon a faint and doubtful glimm'ring made, When in the Garden Jesus kneel'd and pray'd: —O Father! O, if possible it be, (Unbounded Might! what is not so to Thee?) Remove this Cup, this bitter Cap away, But since 'tis thine to order, mine t'obey, Father, Thy will be done, still did he pray; While faint, large Sweats, as in the doubtful Strife Betwixt encroaching Death and lab'ring Life, As watry Mists the Sun, enwrapt him round, Then roll'd in sanguine Drops upon the Ground. When loe, a heav'nly Watcher cleaves the Air, As Lightning swift, as Love or Mercy fair; Descending from the Chariot of a Cloud, Where kneel'd our Saviour, thrice he lowly bow'd; Then his oppress'd Humanity sustains, And strengthens him against approaching greater Pains. CIII. St. Luke Chap. XXIII. Ver. 3, to 24 Our Saviour carried first to Pilate; then to Herod. Our Lord betray'd, the Crowd to Pilate bring, And plead he sought to make himself a King; Herded with factious Galilean Jews, And Tribute unto Cæsar did refuse. Examin'd, when no Cause of Death he found; The Governour to Herod sends him bound. Receiv'd with Joy, the Tyrant hop'd that He Some long-expected Miracles shou'd see: Silent he stood, the Guards despis'd and scorn'd; And him blasphem'd, in Royal Robes adorn'd: To Pilate brought again, he calls the Jews, Who nothing prove, tho' strongly they accuse; Fain wou'd the Governour have him releas'd, Since One he always did at their Great Feast; They Mercy to themselves and him deny, No other Voice is heard, but Crucifie! Those Wretches to the Lord of Life prefer A black Seditious and a Murderer. At length the facile Governor's o'ercome, He mounts the Judgment-Seat, and there pronounc'd his Doom. CIV. St. Luke Chap. XXIII. Ver. 26, 27, 28. Christ led away to his Crucifixion on Mount Calvary. Condemn'd and Scourg'd, our Saviour they convey To Calvary, a long and dol'rous Way: He faints beneath his Crosses pond'rous Load, And marks with Tracks of Blood the crowded Road. Their cruel Mercy makes a Stranger share The odious Weight, and after Jesus bear. The softer Sex, 'twas all they dar'd, exprest In Sighs their Grief, and spake in Tears the rest. To whom, compassionate, our Lord—No more Lament for me, or my sad Fate deplore; Enough of Grief's for my Misfortunes shown, Reserve the rest, you'll need it for your own. The Day, the dreadful Day approaches nigh, And big with Wrath prepares to mount the Sky; The barren Womb no longer then, a Curse, Wo to the Mothers then, and vainly fruitful Nurse! CV. St. Luke Chap. XXIII. Ver. 33, to 46 Christ crucified, pierc'd, and revil'd. High-rais'd, behold upon th'unhappy Tree, Sinner! Behold the Lord that dy'd for thee! See where below the Rulers him deride! Behold above, the Sun his Glories hide, Nor bear to view his Head, his Hands, his Side. See the sick Earth her hollow Vaults display, Nature in Pangs, as at the last Great Day: Th'Holy of Holies bare to Eyes profane, The Temple's Sacred Veil is rent in twain: While thus the Lamb of God, thus meekly pray'd For those who him in his last Pains upbraid, Who his Destruction and their own pursue; “Father forgive, they know not what they do. At length, I thirst, he faintly crys, they run For eager Wine, he tasts and says—'Tis done. He bow'd his Head, “Receive my Soul, he cry'd, “Dear Father, in thy Arms, he bow'd his Head and dy'd. CVI. St. Luke Chap. XXIII. Ver. 50, to 53 Our Lord taken down from the Cross and buried. Joseph, the Lord of Rama's ancient Town, For Wisdom and true Honour widely known; Who in the Sanhedrim our Lord confest, And there, undaunted entred his Protest Against their murd'rous Vote, to Pilate came: For his dead Friend his Love was still the same, As while he liv'd; and for his Body sues To give those dear Remains sepulchral Dues: The ready Tributes of his Tears to pay, And him in his new Tomb lamenting lay: To his Request the Roman gave Consent, And with his Friends to Calvary he went; Down from the Cross his lifeless Limbs they bear, In purest Linen wrapt with pious Care, And decently entomb in Joseph's Sepulchre. CVII. St. Luke Chap. XXIV. Ver. 4, 5, 6. The Resurrection declar'd to the Women. Scarce had the early Dawns yet doubtful Ray Shot upward and proclaim'd th'approach of Day, When the two Maries to the Tomb repair, With spicy Gums t'embalm their Master there: But he was gone, his Grave-Cloaths left behind, And in his room two Angel-Forms they find, Array'd in bright celestial Robes, who said, Why seek ye him that lives among the Dead? He bids his Friends dismiss their causless Fear, He's rais'd in Glory, he's no longer here: Remember how he said before he dy'd, He must by sinful Men be crucify'd, And the third Morn arise—They call'd to mind His Words, and to th'Apostles left behind, Bear the glad News; their Witness nought avails, Vain Dreams they all esteem'd, and idle female Tales. CVIII. St. Luke Chap. XXIV. Ver. 13, 14, 15, 16. Jesus walketh and discourseth with two Disciples. As two Disciples sad and mournful walkt T'a neighb'ring Village, on the Road they talkt Of all that past; when Jesus self was there And joyn'd, unknown, the melancholy Pair: He asks them what their sad Discourses were. They thus—Art thou a Stranger, that alone, To thee the Things that late have past, unknown; Of Nazarean Jesus, David's Seed, A wond'rous Prophet, Great in Word and Deed, Whom our High-Priests and Rulers have deny'd, Betray'd, accus'd, condemn'd and crucify'd? Vain were our Hopes, our flatt'ring Dreams were vain, That he design'd to break our servile Chain: Yet some report, tho' little Faith they gain, That he again on the third Day did rise. —O Fools, and slow of Heart, our Lord replies: Are not the Scriptures evident and plain, Christ ought to suffer first, and then to reign? Then did he all those mystic Truths display, Which in the Psalms and Prophets clouded lay; And e'er in Western Waves the Sun descends, At once he Ends his Speech, at once their Journey Ends. CIX. St. Luke Chap. XXIV. Ver. 30, 31, 32. He discovers himself and eats with them. Near to the Village come, he still press'd on, And semblance made as he'd have further gone: With an obliging Force they him retain, He must beneath their humble Roof remain; Since far away the Hills project their shade, And humid Night wou'd soon the World invade: Ent'ring the House, he not disdain'd to share Their frugal Board, and homely Country-Fare: He took, he bless'd, he brake, and gave the Bread, When from their Eyes the mists that veil'd 'em fled: They saw the well-known Glories of his Face, They saw and wou'd have rush'd to his Embrace, But grasp'd the Air, he vanish'd from their sight, And cloth'd his heav'nly Form in Clouds and Night. With Joy and heav'nly Love, and glad Surprise, Either on other fix'd, at first, their Eyes; Then thus—As with us on the Road he came, Did not his piercing Words our Hearts enflame? Nor from th'Apostles long the News conceal'd, But told 'em how our Lord his heav'nly Form reveal'd. CX. St. Luke Chap. XXIV. Ver. 39, to 43 He appears again to the Eleven, and convinces them. Now to the under-World the Sun was fled, And Night her sable Mantle round her spred, When the Disciples of the Jews afraid, Clos'd all the Doors, and sought a deeper Shade. Loe, in the midst they see our Lord appear, Who kindly thus accosts 'em—Peace be here! The sudden sight distracts 'em all with Fear; They some illusive Spectre him suppose, Till them his wounded Hands and Feet he shows, Why suffer you these doubtful Thoughts to rise? He mildly asks, Believe your Hands and Eyes! Sense cannot be deceiv'd—Handle and see, A Spirit has not Flesh and Bones like me. Tho' all his Wounds they yet unclos'd perceive For Joy and Wonder yet they scarce believe. More to confirm 'em still, he asks for Meat, And their mean Viands not disdain'd to eat; Divine Instruction freely then imparts, And fills with Light their Eyes, with heav'nly Joy their Hearts. CXI. St. Luke Chap. XXIV. Ver. 50, to the End. He blesses his Disciples, and ascends into Heaven. To well-known Bethany our Saviour goes, And led the little faithful Flock he chose; With lifted Hands he blesses first his Friends, And then to Heav'n, from whence he came, ascends. They saw the Gates of Bliss unfolding wide, They saw Cherubic-Guards on either side: Low on the Ground they fell, his Aid implore, And him, th'Eternal Lord of Life, adore: Then down the Olive-bearing Mounts descent, Back to the sacred Town with Joy they went. To God's High-Temple daily did repair, And mix their Hymns with Saints and Angels there: His Praises, who's above all Praise, confess'd, And prostrate at his Throne, they Bless'd the Ever-Bless'd. St. JOHN the Evangelist. The GOSPEL according to St. JOHN. Behold the Lov'd Disciple's heav'nly Face! What Beams of Light! what Glory, and what Grace! Last of the four Evangelists he writes, And what the other Three omit, recites. With more than Eagle's Wings he soars on high, Confounds abhorr'd Blasphemers, who deny With Mouth's impure, the Son's Divinity. The wondrous Marriage next, and then the Sage, With whom our Lord did in Discourse engage. Sychar: The long infirm his Limbs does find, The Loaves: the Feast: the Adult'rous; and the Blind. Christ is the Door: His Friend from Death he rais'd, And Mary, who his Feet anointed, prais'd. Th'Apostles Feet he washt, his Death foreshows, And comforts and instructs 'em e'er he goes: He prays: Is by his own betray'd, deny'd, By others scourg'd, condemn'd, and crucify'd: Is rais'd, and shews his wounded Hands and side: Saint Peter thrice he trys, and then enjoyn'd To feed with Care the Sheep and Lambs he left behind. CXIII. St. John Chap. I. Ver. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. The Divinity and Humanity of Christ. In the Beginning was th'Eternal Word, Before all Time by heav'nly Minds ador'd. There never was when he began to be, Coequal with th'Eternal Father He, Equal in Substance, Pow'r, and Deitie. True God of God: By him were all things made, By him the vast Expanse above display'd: Each glitt'ring Orb that rolls in liquid Air, Each brighter Mind that keeps its Station there: By him the Earth with various Beauties dress'd, And Man, by whom his Maker's prais'd and bless'd. That unexhausted Spring of Life and Light, Gilding the wast unlovely Realms of Night, The Word made Flesh, did in the World appear, Left his own Heav'n and Tabernacl'd here: We saw him, full of Glory, full of Grace, We saw his Father's Image in his Face: The Lines of Truth and Goodness plain express'd, Which claim'd his heav'nly Sire, and all the God confess'd. CXIV. St. Luke Chap. I. Ver. 28, to 33. The Salutation or Annuntiation of the Angel Gabriel to the Blessed Virgin. The Angel Gabriel from high Heav'n descends, To Nazareth his shining Course he bends; This weighty Message he to Mary brings, Espous'd to Joseph, both the Seed of Kings, “All Hail! Belov'd of Heav'n, and full of Grace, Belov'd beyond the Sexes frailer Race: Thy Virgin-womb an Infant-God does shrowd, JESUS his sacred Name—and then he bow'd. Th'Eternal Father's Coeternal Son, Enthron'd in Light before the World begun: Over the House of Jacob he shall reign, His Kingdom shall no Time nor Age restrain. The Holy Spirit, the pure Etherial Dove, Shall warm thy Breast with Joy and heav'nly Love. She bow'd with humble Faith and full Assent, Back to his radiant Seat the heav'nly Courtier went. CXV. St. Luke Chap. II. Ver. 21, 22. The Circumcision and naming of the Blessed Jesus. O early Suff'rer for a Mortal's Sin! And must thy Sorrows with thy Life begin? Together they set out, and still kept pace, Together they conclude their weary Race. Nor did the Patient Son of God disdain To yield his tender Flesh to Shame and Pain, So to remove our ancient mortal Stain: Thus he obedient to the Law was made, And meekly thus he suffer'd and obey'd. He saw the Eighth appointed Morn arise, When him, as Moses bids, they circumcise; JESUS the Name his pious Friends assign, Appointed by the Messenger Divine, E'er his first Threads of Life on Nature's Loom Were wrought, e'er the bless'd Maid conceiv'd him in the Womb. CXVI. St. John Chap. I. Ver. 47, to 50. Philip call'd, and Nathanael approv'd by Christ. Bethsaidan Philip, a Disciple made, Nathanael found, and to our Lord convey'd: At distance he perceives 'em on the way, And to his small Retinue thus did say: —An Isra'lite indeed you there may see From all ill Arts and guileful Practice free: Nathanael wond'ring thus—Whence know'st thou me, Unseen till now? To whom our Lord reply'd, E'er Philip call'd, thou wert not unespy'd: I saw thee when repos'd beneath a Shade, By the broad Fig-tree's leavy Branches made. —O Son of God, confess'd! I ask no more, Nathanael cries, but Israel's King adore. Does this your Wonder raise, our Lord rejoyn'd? What then will more stupendious things behind? When your glad Eyes shall in mid-Air behold The heav'nly Hosts their glitt'ring Ranks unfold: Their glorious Ensigns in the Clouds display Around the Son of Man, at the last dreadful Day? CXVII. St. John Chap. II. Ver. 7, to 10. Marriage at Cana, Water turn'd into Wine. At Cana, they a Nuptial Feast prepare, Our Lord, his Mother, and the Twelve were there: Free, but not fast, the cheerful Bowl went round With decent Mirth, and sober Welcom crown'd: The num'rous Guests exhaust their frugal Store, The Servants go for Wine, but find no more. This the great Mother saw, her Care exprest, And beg'd Assistance of their heav'nly Guest, Regardless first he seem'd of her Request, Who wou'd her Son's mirac'lous Pow'r confine, But yields at length, and Water turns to Wine: Six fair capacious Urns the Treasure hold, Repleat with gen'rous Juice, and liquid Gold: The Guests admire from whence this secret Store, Of nobler Flavor far than that before. Our Saviour thus his Miracles began, Which show'd his Pow'r, and spake him more than Man: Confirm'd the Faith of those with him remain'd, Wide spread his Glory round, and new Disciples gain'd. CXVIII. St. John Chap. III. Ver. 5, 6, 7, 8. Christ teaches Nicodemus the Necessity of Regeneration. 'Twas Night, which covers Fear, and covers Shame, When Nicodemus to our Saviour came: Rabbi, (he thus began) we must confess Thou art from God, thy Works declare no less: He'd ne'er with Miracles thy Mission sign, Were not thy Doctrine, like thy self, Divine. To whom our Lord— That which is born of Flesh must Flesh remain, Till of the Spirit and Water born again: Reason's too short the secret Mode t'explain, Tho' clear the Fact, as cooling Breezes blow, Unknown from whence they come, or where they go. But greater Things are in my Law reveal'd, Tho' from the Wise and Prudent yet conceal'd. The Son, who does his Father's Will declare, Came down from Heav'n, he heard and learnt it there, Yet still's in Heav'n, for he is every where. Who him believe, and on his Word depend, He'll bring to lasting Bliss and Joy, that know no End. CXIX. St. John Chap. IV. Ver. 5, 6, 7, 8. Christ reveals himself to the Samaritan Woman. Our Saviour to Samarian Sychar goes, And does by Jacob's Well himself repose; (For now the Sun directly darts his Ray, High-mounted in the burning Noon of Day.) Weary and faint, the Manhood he confess'd, And Water does, t'allay his Thirst, request Of one who then, as chanc'd, approach'd the Place, A Woman of Samaria's mingled Race: She wonders why a Jew, who them defy'd, Shou'd ought of her desire; our Lord reply'd, With whom thou dost converse, didst thou but know, (The greatest Gift that God cou'd e'er bestow.) Thou Living-Water would'st from him implore, Which those who once but taste, shall thirst no more. Then did the Errors of her Life unfold, Which to her Neighbours she departing told: This must, she said, the Great Messiah be, For who cou'd know the secret Soul but He? They came, they heard, his Doctrine they receiv'd, Vast Crowds their Errors left, and him Believ'd. All with enlighten'd Eyes confess they find That He indeed the Christ, the Saviour of Mankind. CXX. St. John Chap. IV. Ver. 49, 50, 51. The Noble-man's Son of Capernaum heal'd. A courtier, thro' Herodian Regions known, Noble of Birth, and Kinsman to the Throne; ?????????. Whose dear and only Son expiring lay, Address'd our Lord, and for his Life did pray. To whom the Son of God, his Faith to try, As mindless of his Suit, did thus reply: Unless you Signs and Wonders daily see, O hard of Heart! you'll not believe in me. Again th'impatient Father begs his Aid, Which, if his Presence longer he delay'd, Wou'd come too late: This answer Jesus gives; —Return with Joy, thy Son's restor'd and lives. The Man believ'd, and as he hasten'd down The easy Hill to rich Capern'um's Town, His Servants met, the joyful News they tell, Tho' out of Breath, his Son was strangely well. Our Saviour's Doctrine gladly he receives, And him the Son of God, with all his House, believes. CXXI. St. John Chap. VIII. Ver. 4, 5, 6, 7. The Adulteress deliver'd. Scarce did the Sun the Temple-Gates behold, And double-gild the Roof with heav'nly Gold, When to the Courts his steps our Saviour bends, And down the Olive-bearing Hill descends; And while the Crowd assembled there he taught, The Scribes and Pharisees a Woman brought, I'th' very Act of foul Adult'ry caught; Then tempting thus— The Law of Moses these forbids to spare, They must be ston'd—Is thine alike severe? Our Saviour their malicious Treason found, And stooping down he wrote upon the Ground, As one who nothing heard; they still press'd on, And ask him still; he rose, and thus began; Whoever Innocent his Life has past Of the same Crime, he the first Stone may cast. Again he stoops, each knows his own Offence, Their Conscience urg'd within, and drove 'em thence. Singly they melt away till all are gone, When Jesus rising, found himself alone, The Woman in the midst; he asks, if none Had her condemn'd; none, Lord, th'accus'd replies, Ingenuous Tears thick-streaming from her Eyes: Neither do I, he says, thy danger's o'er, If truly thou repent; depart, and sin no more. CXXII. St. John Chap. VIII. Ver. 57, to the End. The Jews boasting of Abraham, offer to stone Christ. As in the Treasury our Lord remain'd, And to the Crowd his heav'nly Laws explain'd, He's urg'd and tempted by the ungrateful Jews, That to the Romans him they might accuse: Poiz'd on himself, he ne'er the more forbears, Nor fears their Malice, nor their Vices spares: In vain themselves they boast of Abraham's Race, Degenerate they, his sacred Stem disgrace: Rather their Sire the Enemy of Man, Treason from him, and Murther first began. To his Eternal Father Christ appeals, Who by his Works his heav'nly Mission seals. Abr'ham, he says, from whom your Race you draw, Just Abraham saw my Day, rejoycing saw: Nor ought but my undoubted Right I claim, Before your Father Abraham, was I AM: The Temples Marble Pavement up they tear, And wou'd, for a Blasphemer, stone him there: He thence himself does silently convey, Passes the num'rous Crowd, and safe withdraws away. CXXIII. St. John Chap. X. Ver. 9, 10, 11, 12. Christ Jesus the Door, and the good Shepherd. I only am the Shepherd and the Door, Robbers and Thieves were all that came before, My Sheep their Shepherd know, they know his Voice, And when they hear it, follow and rejoyce; I chuse their walk, reduce 'em when they stray, They know not Strangers, nor their Voice obey: They with my Rod and Shepherd's Crook are led, By crystal Streams in verdant Pastures fed; The Thief surrounds the Flock but to destroy, To steal, to kill, to ravage all his Joy: The Hireling basely flees, nor dares engage The furious hungry Wolf's invading Rage; Nor heeds the Sheep, tho' scatter'd o'er the Plain, Or by the hoary Robber seiz'd and slain. The good, the faithful Shepherd, only I, For my dear Flock who not refuse to die; And other Sheep I have, which now are led To different FOLDS, in diff'rent Pastures fed. CXXIV. St. John Chap. XI. Ver. 41, 42, 43, 44 Lazarus raised from the Dead. Good Lazarus, who oft receiv'd our Lord, And treated at his hospitable Board; Who in his Breast had an uncommon share, The Lov'd Disciple only nearer there, Struck with a mortal Sickness gasping lay, His Life despair'd, his Friend was far away; Yet to the Twelve he does his Death declare, Rejoycing for their sakes, he was not there: Touch'd with true Sorrow, Thomas did reply, Let us return, that we may with him dye, For Life's a Pain when such a Friend is gone. Our Lord departs, and as they journy'd on First Martha him accosts, and weeping said, Had you been here your Friend had not been dead. Only Believe, our Saviour mild replies, And Wonders see, for he again shall rise. He asks 'em where he's laid; they show the Tomb Clos'd with a pond'rous Stone; when thither come, As one with mortal Sorrows not unmov'd, He groan'd, and wept the Death of him he lov'd. The Stone remov'd, to Heav'n he lifts his Eyes, And prays awhile, then bids his Friend arise. Arose the Dead in Fun'ral Garments bound, Many believ'd, and spread the wond'rous Tidings round. CXXV. St. John Chap. XIII. Ver. 12, 13, 14, 15. Jesus washing his Disciples Feet, recommends Humility and Charity. 'Twas now the Eve of the Great Paschal Day, Our Lord, who knew the Price he was to pay For Man's misdeeds, his Garments laid away, And not disdains to wash the Feet of those, Whom for his little Family he chose; High Heav'n forbid, said Simon, such Disgrace, So low thou never shalt thy self debase: Our Lord—Unless I wash thy Stains away, I'll never own thee at the last Great Day: Not only then, my Feet, Barjonas cries, But Hands and Head; the Son of God replies, If those are wash'd, 'twill for the whole suffice. You me your Lord and Master justly name, If I then wash your Feet, do ye the same. Their Master's Fate his Servants shou'd content, Greater is he that sends, than he that's sent: You know your Duty now, and happy they Who humbly trace my steps, and what they know, obey. CXXVI. St. John Chap. XVII. Ver. 5, to 10. Christ prays to his Father to glorifie him, and to preserve his Apostles in Unity and Truth. And now our Saviour lifts his Hand and Eyes, To his Great Father, thron'd above the Skies; Then thus begins—Father! the Hour is come, Fore-fix'd by thy irrevocable Doom, When I my dear, my glorious Crown must gain, Decreed to suffer first, and then to reign. At length my Work in this bad World is done: O Righteous Father! Glorify thy Son; That those who Thee, the one Supreme believe, And him whom thou from Heav'n hast sent, receive, May, ransom'd by his Blood, for ever live: May they with our reflected Glories shine, And in the Holy Bands of Friendship joyn, Their Union firm, resembling the Divine. With me, O let 'em enter into Rest, And see the Glory I with Thee possest, Before the Earth on its strong Base was laid, Before the vast Expanse above the World display'd. CXXVII. St. John Chap. XVIII. Ver. 20, to 23 Jesus bound and examin'd by the High-Priest. Betray'd and bound they to the Pontiff bear Our Lord, accuse him and affront him there: The haughty Caiaphas, who fill'd the Chair, Of his Disciples and his Law enquires; Our Saviour thus—No corners Truth desires; Nothing in secret silence I've conceal'd, But in the Temple all my Laws reveal'd. The Jews themselves have often heard me there, If ought amiss, let them the Truth declare. One of th'officious Guards who fill'd the Place, With a rude Halbert strikes his heav'nly Face. Mildly our Lord—If ought that's ill you hear No Favour shew, impartial Witness bear: If only Truth, and in my own Defence, I freely speak to clear my Innocence, Why am I rudely smitten thus, and why Do you both Judges and Tormenters place supply? CXXVIII. St. John Chap. XIX. Ver. 1. Christ arraign'd and scourg'd. Now they those Hands that launch the Thunder strain, A Prelude to approaching greater Pain. Behold his sacred Body, Virgin-born, With stripes unmeasurable, raz'd and torn; Long livid Furrows on his Shoulders made, How dear the Price for our Offences paid! The Blood flow'd swift from one continu'd Wound, And in a Crimson River stain'd the Ground. Cou'd Heav'n at such a sight its Bolts refrain, Or, O ye Angels! were your Swords in vain? Whose shining Myriads prest and ready stand, And only wait your Master's dread Command. But he must suffer now, for us was bruis'd, Nor the Chastisement of our Peace refus'd. We by his Stripes are heal'd, and give him more By our unkind Returns, than all his Wounds before. CXXIX. St. John Chap. XIX. Ver. 2, 3, 4, 5. Christ crown'd with Thorns and mock'd. Much had the Lamb of God already born, Yet more remains of Cruelty and Scorn: The Soldiers all their Band together bring, And with abusive Honours, hail him King. A Robe of Royal Purple they provide, With that his bleeding mangled Shoulders hide. A reedy Sceptre in those Hands he bears, Which as they moulded first, still guide the Spheres; His Head, the Spring of Blessing, they adorn With a mysterious Crown of pungent Thorn, While Drops of sacred Blood profusely shed, With precious Rubies circle round his Head. Him thus adorn'd with bended Knees they greet, Or lower bow, and prostrate at his Feet; Then rising, smite with impious Hands his Face, And with insulting Shouts and Laughter fill the Place. CXXX. St. John Chap. XIX. Ver. 13, 14, 15. Our Saviour offer'd, and Barabbas demanded. Forth to the clam'rous People Pilate goes, And in his mock-Regalia Jesus shows: His reedy Sceptre in his Hands he bore, And still his thorny Crown and Purple wore: When Pilate to the Crowd—Behold the Man! Anew their Clamors and their Rage began; They rend their Garments, and they rend the Sky, No Voice amongst them heard, but Crucify! Again the Governour did thus reply, What Crime, what Accusation can you bring? Why am I press'd to Crucify your King? They answer—Cæsar is our King alone, All others as Impostors we disown, This Galilean most; again they cry'd, If thou art Cæsar's Friend, let him be Crucify'd. No more their Fury Pilate dares engage, The spotless Victim gives to their insatiate Rage. CXXXI. St. John Chap. XIX. Ver. 26, to 30. The Crucifixion of our Lord and Saviour. Dismal the Place, and dismal was the Day, The gloomy Sun deny'd his cheerful Ray; The Eye of Heav'n was clos'd, nor longer shin'd, When on the Cross the Saviour of Mankind: Who struggling for his last expiring Breath, And casting round his Eyes that roll'd in Death; His Mother and his Friend beneath him 'spy'd, Whom from the Saviour cou'd no Hour divide. Not ev'n the last; then to the Virgin said, Woman! behold thy Son! nor think me dead. Next, to the happy Man who shar'd his Breast, Behold thy Mother there! nor more exprest; Nor needed more, such filial Duty shown, And friendly Care, as made his Home her own. And now the Dear, the Glorious Conquest won, And all fulfill'd, our Saviour cries—'Tis done! He Pardon for his Murderers desir'd, Then bow'd his fainting Head, and with a Sigh expir'd. CXXXII. St. John Chap. XX. Ver. 26, 27, 28. The appearance of Jesus after the Resurrection. Our Lord to his Disciples does appear, And stills their trembling Breasts with—Peace be here; Tho' Didymæan Thomas was not there, To him th'Apostles what they saw, declare. But Dreams to him, and idle Tales they told, Unless these Eyes, these very Eyes behold Those deep and ghastly Wounds of which he dy'd, Unless my Hands may feel his opening Side; Another's Witness yet I sha'n't receive, I cannot, and I will not yet believe. Seven times the Sun in his diurnal Race, Had now discover'd Nature's smiling Face; At length the Eighth revolving Morn arose, When to th'Eleven himself our Saviour shows; To Thomas he above the rest apply'd, And bids him feel his wounded Hands and Side, Thy own bold Wish, he said, thou shalt receive, O! be not faithless yet, but now Believe! With Tears of Joy he cry'd—“My God! my Lord! “Incredulous no more, and Isra'l's King ador'd. CXXXIII. St. John Chap. XXI. Ver. 4, 5, 6. Christ appears a third time to his Disciples being a Fishing. As on the Sea from fair Tiberias nam'd, Tho' for our Saviour's Wonders justlier fam'd; Simon and others went their Nets to cast, They all the Night in fruitless Labor past; The Morn at length with happier Omens rose, And on the Beach did their lov'd Lord disclose, Who bids 'em o'er the Starboard cast their Net, Which done, they of the scaly Nation get Within their twisted Toils a Prey so vast, As from the Place to move, their Strength surpast; Till with more Hands th'unequal Toil they share, And to the Shore their struggling Captives bear. A Dinner ready on the Sand they find, Their Master with 'em sits, and when they'd din'd, The Love of Cephas, and his Patience try'd, And thrice he sounds him who had thrice deny'd; Then bids him feed his Flock with tender Care, Nor fear, for his lov'd Charge, his Master's Fate to share. [The Acts of the Apostles] CXXXIV. Acts Chap. II. Ver. 1, to 12. The Feast of Pentecost, and Descent of the Holy Ghost. And now arriv'd the Day our Lord assign'd, For the bless'd Spirit's descent, one Place, one Mind, To all the faithful Flock who him confest, And the Great Mother there among the rest. When from the rifled Heav'ns was heard a Noise, Loud as the rolling Tempest's dreadful Voice: And loe, like cloven Tongues, a lambent Flame, Which from the bright celestial Regions came, On every Head assembled there did rest, And fill'd with sacred Raptures every Breast. The God, the God within's by Wonders shown, They spake his Praise in Language not their own. That awful Voice which from High Heav'n came down, Had all around alarm'd the sacred Town: The pious Strangers soon assembled were, Who did to their Great Paschal-Feast repair. Each in his native Dialect amaz'd, By Men unletter'd heard the Great Creator prais'd. CXXXV. Acts Chap. II. Ver. 14, to 36. Peter's Sermon to the Multitude. When fervent Cephas with th'Eleven arose, And to the Crowd did thus the Truth disclose: —You see accomplish'd what has been foretold, By Men belov'd of Heav'n, inspir'd of old. All Flesh, says God, shall my Salvation know, My sacred Spirit I will on all bestow: Inspir'd shall then your Sons and Daughters be, The Old shall Dreams, the Young shall Visions see; Wonders in Earth and Air shall then appear, And make the guilty World dissolve for Fear: A Heav'n of Fire, whence Show'rs of sanguin Rain, Direful Portent! shall Earth's sad Face distain. The Sun shall in unnat'ral Darkness mourn, The Moon's fair Lamp to Blood and Horror turn; Before our Lord shall in the Clouds appear, Before his Great and Dreadful Day be here: 'Tis He, 'tis He, whom you with Hands profane, The Good! the Just! have crucify'd and slain; But him did his Great Father raise again: Does him, his Only Son, triumphant own, Lord of both Worlds He sits, and shares th'Eternal's Throne. CXXXVI. Acts Chap. II. Ver. 37, 38, 39. Multitudes converted by Peter's Sermon. When this they heard, a deep Concern they felt, Their Hearts with inward true Compunction melt: What shall they do t'avert the threaten'd Doom, Atone just Heav'n, and shun the Wrath to come? Th'Apostles thus—Believe, Repent, Obey, And wash in sacred Streams your Sins away. None are excluded from the proffer'd Grace, It reaches all of Abraham's faithful Race; To Children and the Gentile World extends, And only with the Line of Nature ends. With Joy the happy Tidings they receive, Three Thousand Souls, prepar'd for Life, believe: Who, all the daily Temple-Prayers frequent, All constant to the Word and Sacrament. Wonders and Signs were by th'Apostles shown, All free to all, they nothing call their own. Singly their Hearts from wordly Cares remov'd, They God's High Praises sung, by God and Man belov'd. CXXXVII. Acts Chap. III. Ver. 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. Peter and John restore a lame Man to his Feet. 'Twas now the Hour when pious Crowds repair To God's High-Temple with glad Hymns and Pray'r, When Cephas and the Lov'd Disciple there A poor Infirm with stedfast Eyes survey, Who at the Temple's Beauteous Portal lay, And did the Peoples Charity request, Th'Apostles ent'ring ask'd among the rest. Silver and Gold expect not to receive, Said Cephas, what we have we freely give; And in the Name of Jesus bid thee rise. That sacred Name now Strength and Spirit supplies; Such pow'rful Words all Nature must obey, He rose, he stands, he walks and springs away; Him to the Temple his Restorer brings, With loud and cheerful Voice he God's high Praises sings. CXXXVIII. Acts Chap. V. Ver. 1, to 12. Ananias and Sapphira, their Deceit and Punishment. Some Tares among the Wheat thus early were; The first appear'd, a lost unhappy Pair; He Ananias, she Sapphira nam'd, For Sacrilege, and its just Vengeance fam'd: Their Land they sold, and part they kept away, Part at th'Apostles Feet dissembling lay: Nor this unpunish'd dar'd, for to the Man, With Holy Fervour Cephas thus began. Why has the envious Spirit thy Heart possest, And fill'd with Lies thy avaritious Breast? Th'Almighty Mind thou would'st deceive in vain, And part of what was lately sold detain. He heard the piercing Words he cou'd not bear, But down he falls, and dies in deep Despair. Few Hours expir'd before his Wife came in, Partner, if not Adviser, of his Sin: With the same Question her th'Apostle try'd, And she the same with harden'd Brow reply'd: Since then, Barjonas answers, you've agree'd In Sin, be the same Fate for both decreed: He said, a sudden Mist invades her Eyes, Paleness her guilty Face, and down she falls and dies. CXXXIX. Acts Chap. V. Ver. 17, 18, 19, 20. The Apostles imprison'd and released by an Angel. And now the Sect of Sadoc rose enrag'd, (The furious Pontiff on their side engag'd;) To see the Wonders by th'Apostles wrought, To hear our Saviour's Resurrection taught; By these their darling Principles were crost, And every Day some new Disciple lost. Then on the Twelve their impious Hands they laid, And to the common Prison them convey'd. High-mounted on her Ebon-Car, the Night Had conquer'd half her Stage, when loe a Light Beyond the Sun's, the lonesom Vault invades, And quickly chases thence the trembling Shades. I'th' midst, behold a heav'nly Watcher shine, Of Strength immortal, and of Form divine: He touch'd the brazen Gates, the Gates gave way, The Pris'ners freed, and thus to them did say, To God's high Temple go with speed, and there Unto the list'ning Crowd the way of Life declare. CXL. Acts Chap. VI. Ver. 8, to the End of Chap. VII. St. Stephen, the first Martyr for Christ, stoned. Just Stephen, full of Faith and Pow'r, the Jews Before their partial Sanhedrim accuse: That Moses and the sacred Law he dar'd Blaspheme, nor God, nor his High-Temple spar'd. Angelic Splendor in his Face they see Mild Goodness mixt with awful Majesty. Undaunted he his Nations Errors told, God's wondrous Works, and all their Sins of old: Like their Fore-fathers they, a niff-neck'd Race, But clearer Light abus'd, and greater Grace: The Holy, and the Just, foreseen, desir'd Of pious Minds of old from Heav'n inspir'd; By you betray'd, and by your faithless Train Of wicked Hands was crucify'd and slain. They hear, they gnash their Teeth, they rave, they cry, With Dust, and Shouts, and Curses fill the Sky; They drag him thro' the Gates without the Walls, And stone him; on the Lord of Life he calls, Prays for his Murderers, his Faith exprest, Then down he calmly lay, and slept in endless Rest. CXLI. Acts Chap. VIII. Ver. 35, 36, 37, 38. The Baptism of the Ethiopian Eunuch by Philip. Philip the Deacon by an Angel sent For Gaza, and the Southern Desart went; An Ethiopian Eunuch there he spy'd, Who did in his own stately Chariot ride: Thither de draws, the sacred Spirit did lead, And heard him thus in lofty Esay read. “As helpless Sheep when by the Shearer caught, “As spotless Lambs when to the Altar brought, “Silent in all his Suff'rings he remain'd, “Nor murmur'd once, nor meanly once complain'd. Of whom, says he, does Esay this relate? His own describes he, or another's Fate? Of Jesus only is the Scripture meant, The Holy Man replies; then farther went, His Heav'nly Doctrine did to him display, And teaches how to wash his Sins away: He hears attent, and what he hears believes, The Laver of Salvation him receives: Rapt in a Cloud the Saint from thence is born, The Convert does with Joy to his own Land return. CXLII. Acts. Chap. IX. Ver. 3, 4, 5, 6. The Conversion of Saul. Nothing but Blood did Saul, and Threatning breath, And hal'd vast Crowds to Prison and to Death: Nor with his native Country's Spoil content, The same his Bus'ness to Damascus went. O'er Libanus the Sun his Beams displaid, And neither way the Cedars shoot their Shade: When loe, a Light, which drown'd the Days, as far, As that a feeble Lamp, or twinkling Star, Blaz'd from Mid-Heav'n, th'intolerable Beams, Delug'd the Road with large etherial Streams Which whelm'd 'em all to earth, and in their Fall, A Voice like Thunder loud was heard by Saul. Struck blind: Who art thou Lord? he trembling cry'd, And, “I am JESUS, the dread Voice reply'd, Whom thou dost persecute with furious Rage; 'Tis hard with mortal Arms High Heav'n t'engage. Arise and to Damascus strait repair, What thou must do shall soon be told thee there: He went and was baptis'd, nor longer blind, A heav'nly Light refresh'd his Eyes and Mind: The more oppos'd, his Strength encreas'd the more, He boldly taught that Name which he blasphem'd before. CXLIII. Acts Chap. X. Ver. 3, 4, 5, 6. Cornelius his Vision; he sends for Peter. A brave Centurion, who did nought disgrace His ancient Stem, and noble Roman Race; At Cæsarea in th'Italian Band, Did the Proconsul's faithful Guards command; A Soldier, yet devout, his Conscience clear, He fear'd th'All-High, tho' none but him cou'd fear. With pious Pray'rs he daily pierc'd the Skies, And Alms, the most accepted Sacrifice: His Family, by his Example sway'd, Virtuous and Just the King of Heav'n obey'd; As in his Closet he devoutly pray'd, One of the Glorious heav'nly Host came down, And bids him send to Joppa's wealthy Town, For Galilean Simon, refug'd there, Who shou'd the perfect way to Bliss declare: He sent, and Simon, by a Vision warn'd, Immediate with his Messengers return'd; The Gospel preach'd, which gladly was receiv'd, Cornelius with his House, and all his Friends believ'd. CXLIV. Acts Chap. XII. Ver. 6, 7, 8, 9. Peter imprison'd, and deliver'd by an Angel. By Herod, Zebedean James was slain, He lost his Head a Martyr-Crown to gain: The Tyrant saw the bloody Jews were pleas'd, And farther went, and next on Peter seiz'd; Within a loathsom Dungeon him confin'd, A second Victim to their Rage design'd. To Guards twice doubled him commit in vain, At Night they lodge him with a double Chain. Sweetly he slept, for all was calm within, No black disturbing Dreams of Guilt or Sin. —Sleep on bless'd Saint! nor hast thou ought to fear, Tho' near the Tyrant's Guard, thy heav'nly Guards more near. The Angel who secur'd thee from the Womb, Enrob'd in Light is to thy Rescue come. He came, he saw, he gently touch'd his Side, And bids him rise, the Doors are open'd wide; The first and second Ward unseen they past, The Iron-Gate that mov'd on Hinges vast, Silently open'd to the heav'nly Guide, While his lov'd Charge walk'd wond'ring by his Side. Another Street they pass'd, from Danger clear'd, Forth with the Angel left his Saint, and disappear'd. CXLV. Acts Chap. XII. Ver. 21, 22, 23. Herod smitten by the Angel of God. When thus the haughty Tyrant's Rage deceiv'd, And of his long-expected Prey bereav'd; Against his Guards he storm'd and rav'd in vain, The Saint by Wonders sav'd, while these are slain. Now he's with Tyre's and Sidon's Towns displeas'd, Who him by Gifts at length and Friends appeas'd. When in his glitt'ring Royal Robes aray'd, Whereon the Sun with fierce Reflexions play'd, Plac'd on his Throne he an Oration made. The Crowd with Acclamations rend the Sky, And fawning low, a God! a God! they cry. What flowing Sweetness, and what massy Sense! No mortal Voice, nor mortal Eloquence! The Tyrant all with secret Pride receives, And scarce his due he thinks th'Assembly gives: But Heav'n who saw him ripe for Wrath, when He To Persecution added Blasphemy; A vengeful Angel sends, who smites him there, And from his Throne he tumbles in Despair; Th'Immortal Man now owns superiour Pow'r, And yet alive, the Wretch increasing Worms devour. CXLVI. Acts Chap. XIII. Ver. 9, 10, 11. Elymas the Sorcerer is stricken Blind. Great Saul and Barnabas abroad were sent, And preach'd the Word of God where-e'er they went. To Cyprian Paphos come, accepted there, To prudent Sergius heav'nly Truths declare: But a false Jew in Charms of Magic read, And the forbidden Language of the Dead; With all his Art oppos'd the Sacred Law, The noble Sergius from the Faith to draw. Nor this Great Paul, who on him fix'd his Eyes, And thus began—O full of Fraud and Lyes! Unworthy that high Title thou hast claim'd, The cursed Child of Satan rather nam'd: Wilt thou not cease thy guileful Art t'apply, Opposing Truths thou never canst deny? And since to wilful Darkness thus inclin'd, Bid the Sun's Light farewel, and, Wretch, be blind! Seiz'd with a sudden Mist, he saw no more, But did the help of some kind Hand implore. The Deputy receiv'd the heav'nly Law, Justly amaz'd at all the wondrous Things he saw. CXLVII. Acts Chap. XIV. Ver. 11, to 18. Paul and Barnabas accounted Gods by the Lycaonians. Great Paul and Barnabas to Lystra came, Where lay a Wretch who from his Birth was lame; They bid him rise and walk, his Limbs obey, With new mirac'lous Strength he springs away. Th'astonish'd Crowd (who still are wise too late, And always in Extreams admire or hate,) Cry'd out—The Gods in human Form come down To see Mankind, and bless our happy Town: So soft their Speech, so awfully they move, It must be Hermes, and his Father Jove: Two free-neck'd Bulls, whose Heads and threatning Horns, A sacred Wreath of od'rous Flow'rs adorns, The vested Priests for Sacrifice prepare: Th'Apostles rend their Cloaths, and cry—Forbear, Your Fellow-mortals we, and wou'd restrain From your mistaken Zeal for Idols vain, To serve the one Supreme, who ever lives, And Sun, and Rain from Heav'n, and Food and Gladness gives. CXLVIII. Acts Chap. XVI. Ver. 26, 27, 28. The Jailor converted and baptised. With faithful Silas Paul's in Bonds secur'd, When cruel Scourgings they had first endur'd; Yet full of inward Peace and heav'nly Joy, In Songs of Praise their Midnight Hours imploy. When loe the bellowing Earth begins to quake, The Prisons deep and strong Foundations shake; All things were, full of Fear and Noise, confus'd, The Doors fly open, ev'ry Bond is loos'd: The Jailor thought his Pris'ners all were gone, His Poniard draws and wou'd himself have thrown Against the deadly Point—Rash Man forbear, Aloud th'Apostles cry, we all are here. For Lights he calls, and when the Saints he sees, Springs trembling in, and prostrate at their Knees, The way to Bliss and endless Life enquires. They readily comply with his desires; The Gospel he sincerely must receive, And in the Saviour of the World believe: He washt their Stripes, then both with Food suffic'd, And he and all his House rejoycing were baptis'd. CXLIX. Acts Chap. XX. Ver. 9, to 12. Eutychus, dead by a fall, is raised to Life by St. Paul. To Asian Troas, not unknown to Fame, The Great Apostle of the Gentiles came; The Church together his Arrival brought, Whom now till heavy dead of Night he taught; Young Eutychus among the rest was there, In a large Window plac'd to take the Air And shun the stifling Heat; so long he staid, Till heavy Slumbers did his Eyes invade; When down he sunk three dreadful Stories deep, And there had lain in everlasting Sleep; But with Compassion him the Saint survey'd, And on him his All-healing Hands he laid; And while his hopeless Friends around him mourn'd, To his forsaken Breast his wand'ring Soul return'd. CL. Acts Chap. XXVIII. Ver. 2, 3, 4, 5. St. Paul entertain'd by the Barbarians, unhurt by the Viper. 'Scaped from the Sea, and dropping with the Waves, A Rock which lost the Ship, th'Apostle saves: The barb'rous Insulairs, who long before Wishing the Wreck stood watching on the Shore; When him they saw, were chang'd to mild and kind, And gentle Pity seiz'd their soften'd Mind; A Stranger there till now, they spread the Sand, And help the weary Passengers to Land: A Fire they make, their frozen Limbs to warm, And dry them, wet and beaten by the Storm: When from the heat a dreadful Viper sprung, Fix'd on th'Apostle's Hand, and winding hung. Th'affrighted Islanders around him fled, And every moment look'd to see him dead: A Murd'rer sure, whom, tho' the Waves he'd past, Impartial Vengeance found, and seiz'd at last. He shook the Viper off amid the Fire, And felt no harm, still more the Crowd admire. Tho' him a Murderer they thought before, A God! A God! they cry, and only-not adore. [The Book of Revelation] CLI. Rev. Chap. I. Ver. 13, 14, 15, 16. Christ's Appearance in Power and Majesty. The Lov'd Disciple, John, the bless'd Divine, The Foes of Truth in Patmos Isle confine; Within whose narrow Desart Limits pent, He suffer'd and enjoy'd his Banishment. Nor did his glorious Friend forget him there, But wond'rous Truths in mystic Scenes declare: Frequent he came, tho' now disguis'd no more, In our weak mortal Nature as before: He came, a golden Girdle round his Breast, Amidst seven radiant Lamps, and all the God confest. His piercing Eyes the Flame for brightness pass, His Feet like pure refin'd Corinthian Brass: His Voice like Streams which from a Mountain steep, With awful Sound rush roaring to the Deep: His Hair like purest Wool, or Virgin-Snow, And from his Mouth a two-edg'd Sword did go: His Face exceeds the Sun in Pride of Day, As he a glimm'ring Lamp or Torches feeble Ray: CLII. Rev. Chap. XXI. Ver. 9, 10, 11, 12. The Description of the heavenly Jerusalem. An Angel did the Lov'd Disciple bear To a tall Mountain's Brow, and shew'd him there The Holy City from high Heav'n descend, And watchful Seraphs at the Gates attend: Of Pearls those Everlasting Gates were made, Of precious Stones the firm Foundations laid: The Walls of Jasper, wond'rous to behold, The City flam'd with pure Etherial Gold; Thro' whose broad Streets a lovely River glides, And in the midst with crystal Streams divides; Which from the Throne of God incessant flow,' On whose green Banks in comely Order grow Immortal Trees, which various Fruits produce, Of heav'nly Flavour, and reviving Juice. No solar Lamp, or Moon's officious Ray, No twinkling Stars, to make a fainter Day; No useless Flambeau there, but from the Throne, A radiant Blaze of Light profusely shone. Here pious Souls shall blissful Seats obtain, With God, and with the Lamb, to endless Ages reign.</field>
