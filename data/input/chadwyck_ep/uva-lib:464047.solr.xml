      <field name="fulltext">Here begynnyth a good tale of IPOMADON. This version of Ipomadon is taken from the Chetham Library Manuscript. 1 Off love were lykynge of to lere And joye tille all, that wol here, That wote, what love may mene; But who so have grette haste to love And may not com to his above, That poynte dothe louers tene. Fayre speche brekyth never bone, That makythe these lovers ilkone Ay hope of better wene And put them selffe to grete travayle, Wheddyr it helpe or not avayle: Ofte sythes this hathe be sene. 2 Be this poynte well may I prese, That of his love was lothe to lese Fro tyme that he began; Thereffore in Ã¾e world where euer he went, In justys or in turnamente, Euer more the pryce he wan. But a stravnge lover he was one: I hope, ye haue harde speke of non, That euer god made to be man, Ne lother knowen for to be; No whedure a better knyght Ã¾an he Was no levand than. 3 In Cessyle sumtyme wonyd a kyng, That holden was wyth old and ynge Off poynttes wythe owten Ã¾ere; He was worthy, were &amp; wyse, Ouer all he wan losse and pryce, Men callyd hym Mellyagere; He had bovnden to his hande In Fraunce &amp; many other lande Dou?ty dukes and dere; He gatte neuer chyld, his eyre to be, But a brother son had hee, That was his newov nere. 4 That chyld he Ã¾ou?te to make his eyre; In all this world was non so fayre, I darre welle wittnes thus. Large he was of leme and lythe And wonder-well he wex there wyth, Men callyd hym Cabanus. How he was gotton, I can not sayne; Yff ye wille witte, wyth oute layne, Further spyre you bvs. His brother to the kyng hym sent: âAnd prayeth hym ofte wyth goode intente, For the love, he owe tyll vs, 5 That he wille kepe well my son!â He sayd: âFro tyme he kepe tham con, My landes I shall hym take!â Begge he wex of bonne &amp; blode, There wyth so handsum &amp; so goode, That all men hym worshipe spake; He was a derlynge to the kynge, Hym lovyed above all oÃ¾er Ã¾inge For his brothere is sake. Whanne Cabanus was comyn to elde, That he cowde ryde &amp; armus welde, Knyghte he gan hym make. 6 A systur hadde kynge Melyagere, That was chaste &amp; mylde of chere, The feyrest, that on fote myght goo. There come many a ryall kynge, For to wowe that lady yinge, And other prynces moo. The kyng of Calabrye thedur paste And at her brother he here aste And sayd betwene them tow, His systur gyffe hym yf he wolde, Of hym shold he his landes holde, And in acorde made soo. 7 Wyth worshipe he that lady wede And to Calabur he her lede Wyth game &amp; grette lykynge; He made his omage, or he yede, Tyll hym, that dou?ty was in dede, Syr Mellyagere, the kynge. They levyd to geddur but yers ten; A chyld they gatte betwene them Ã¾en, A doughtter fayre &amp; yinge, That aftur them ther ayre shuld be. The elevenyth yere bothe she &amp; he Dyede, wyth oute lesynge. 8 The may was younge &amp; tender of age, And therefore all her baronage Emonge them toke there rede, The moste worthely man &amp; wyse Shuld kepe this lady, mekyll of pryse, And teche hur womanheede; Off bewte and of grette bovnte Sho was the beste in all degre, That euer on erthe myghte trede. Be that she was XV yere of elde, She toke hyr selffe her londes to welde, To gouerene in that stede. 9 She was blyth and bry?te of hewe, All men callyd her, that her knewe, Of Calabere the fere, Visibyll and vertuyvs, Meke, mylde and mervelus, Chaste and fayre of chere; Fro she come to here above, That may wax so provde of love, Her thought no prynce her pere; Yf she were semelyeste vnder schrovde Of other poyntes, she was namyd prowde But of love to lere. 10 She sayd the fyrste day, I vnderstonde, That she toke sesyn in her lande, That fayre as flowre in felde: âNow here to god a vowe I make, I shall never man for riches take, In youthe ne in elde; For welle or woo, whether it be, Man, that is of lowe degre, Shall never to wyffe me helde, But yf he be the best knyghte Of all this world in armus bryghte, Assayde vnder his shelde. 11 There at all her lordes lowgh And sayd: âThis vowe ys grette rowe For anny, that euer were borne! Thou spake, as has don other moo: Some of them saye not so, Though it were a skorne!â Nowghte she covthe of love amowre And held hur howse wyth so grette honoure Of welthe, of wyne and corne, And dyd so worthely and so well, All prayd god gyffe her happe &amp; sell, That come that fre beforne. 12 In Brettayne, Fraunce &amp; Lvmbardy, The word sprange in to Araby, What howse that laydy helde, In Cypres and in many a soyle; The same tyme in the lond of Poyle A noble kynge ther dwelld, That was callyd Ermagynes: Yf anny man wold agayne hym ryse, Euer more his foos he feelld; A worthy wyghte he had to wyffe, A sone she bare hym in her lyffe, As I haue harde betelde. 13 Men keppyd hym, tille he reasone knewe, And they betoke hym to Talamewe, That worthy was all waye; In the world was emperoure ne kynge, But he cowde in all thynge Have seruyd hym well to paye; Fyrste he leryd the chylde curtessye, And sethe the chasse and chevalrye, To weld in armys gaye. He waxed worthely, ware and wyse, Of hvntynge also he bare the pryce, The sertayne sothe to saye. 14 This was he holdyn in his dayes Comely, kynde and curtayes Bothe wyth kynge and quene, Hende and happy ther wyth all; He seruyd in his faders hall And had never forther ben; His name was Ipomadon: A fayre chyld than he was one, Ye haue but selden sene, Of all ken fetowre and of face, Ther wyth god gyaff hym grace, They louyed hym all bedene. 15 His fader was a noble man, Well his landys he governyd than, Bothe fare and nere; His meyne louyd hym moste &amp; leste, And on a tyme he made a feeste To men, that worthy were; When they wer set &amp; seruyd all, The worde spronge in the hall Of Calabrye the fere; Than sayd a knyghte of bewte: âSo fayre, so good at all degre Was non levand to her! 16 As worthy a corte she holdes an, As ys fro Ynde to Ã¾e Oxlyane, This darre I warande welle!â Ipomadon servyd in the hall And herde the knyghttes wordes all Of that damysell; So grette good of her he spake, Hym thoughte, hys hertte asvnder brake Wyth syghynge and vnsele; No thyng he sayd, what so he thoughte, But stode stille and answeryd nought, But thynkyd ylka dell. 17 Whene he to his mette was sett, He myghtte nother drynke ne ete, So mekyll on her he thoughte; He wax wan and pale off hewe, That sawe his maystur Talamewe And he parsayuyd yt nought. Hym Ã¾ou?te full longe, Ã¾at Ã¾ey had ettyn; Talamewe had not forgettyn, But to the chyld he sought, He sayd: âSone, me mervayls mekyll of Ã¾at, So thoughtfull at your mette ye sate: Ys anny Ã¾inge mysse-wroghtte?â 18 He sayd: âDere maystur Thalamewe, Ye haue byn to me trusty &amp; trewe, Sethe fyrste your faythe was fest! Here I lye as bere in denne And come neuer amonge no men, Nother este ne weste; Who lovys ay at home to wonne, Lyttill gode shall he conn, Of bewete whan he ys beste: To seke my seruys will I gange, Here, me thynke, I dwell ouer-longe, It rewys me ro &amp; reste! 19 I haue harde speke of contreys straunge, The whiche it makyth my hertte to chaunge, Mekell more it mone; The wyse man and the boke seys: In a cowrte who so dwell alweys, Full littill good shall he con; I will you swere, mayster, ya, I trowe, ye will wyth me ga, Suche frenshipe in you I fonde. Me alone forther yf I wende, Here I woll not lengur lende, As se I syghtte of sonne! 20 And therfor, mayster, y you praye, That ye will to my fader saye And to my moder fre, Me were full lothe, I shuld them greue, Therefore I praye you, axe them leve, Grythe for you and me; And yf they will not lett me goo, Myselffe at mydnyght leve shall ta, Thow? I shullde barfote bee; Whethur they be foo or frend, Tyll vncovth contreys will I wende, The maner wille I see!â 21 And when he had Ã¾is tale tolde, His mayster stode &amp; hym behylde, Awonderd as he ware: âDere sone Ipomadon, Syn thou arte purposyde here vpon, Wheddur wille ye fare?â âMaysturâ, he sayd, âye harde full wele Of that dereworthy damysell, The knyght spake of langare: The semely fere of Calabyre, The way thethur will I spere, To se the maner thare. 22 And, sertes, yf ye will helpe me nowe, For euer I shall be holden to you, As I haue euer mekyll bene; But, maystur, &amp; ye leve behynde, I not, where I sholde frenshipe fynde, Ne to home I myghte me mene!â His maystur stode &amp; lowde gan low?e And sayd: âSone, Ã¾is pleses me well inowe, To wette, wyth owten wene; To leve behynde, me were full lothe, I shall aske leve for vs both, And that shall sone be sene!â 23 His mayster made no tarynge, But sought, tille he fande the kynge, And thus to hym sayd thanne: âIn a courtte who ay soioyrons so And se the maner of no moo, Of no mo they can: Leve, I rede, that ye hym geve, For, yf god will lett hym leve, He will be a noble man! 24 Syr, a poynte I you praye: Gravnte me leve, as I saye, For wyth hym wynde I wolde!â The kynge Ã¾ought, he sayd but skylle; The quene chambyr he went tille And her thus purpos tolde. His moder had full mekyll care, Her sone so fere shuld fro her fare And she ne wyste, whedder he sholde; She graunte hym leffe at the laste And wyth a sorowfull hert he aste Her blessynge vppon molde. 25 When they had getton leve to goo, In hertt full joyfull were they tow, They made no tarrynge. The kynge to Thalamew bekende, Gold and syluer inowghe to spende For ys sone so yinge; Ayther hade a palffraye, Tow somers for the chyldys araye And eke for his spendynge, Tow men and no mo mene, That chyldes currure for to be, Tythandys to bere and brynge. 26 His leve he toke at kynge and quene And sethen at all the courte bedene; His moder sighed sare. They travayllyd day be day fro home, In to Calabyre that they come, They wold no spendynge spare. They speryd aftur that bryght of ble, Men tolde them in a ryche citte, And thedyr can they fare. Att the beste ynne of all the towne Talamewe is lyght adowne And toke them herbowre thare. 27 In the world was kynge ne emperoure, That he ne myghte wyth grette honoure Have holden his howse wyth ynne Wyth bankers brodyrd all abowte, The dosers steynyd, wyth oute dowte, Wyth fowle and fyshe well fyne. His oste vpon the chylde gan loke And in his cuntenavnce vndertoke, He was full hye of kynne; The burgays cowth of curtessye And at his wolle full worthely He purveyd hym that inne. 28 Talamewe sayd: âI the praye, Ordayne for vs corne and heye And loke, that we well fare, Off mette and drynke grette plente, The beste wyne of thus contre, Fayne wold I wette, where ware! Thou artte wythe thy neybors kende: Brynge it in, we haue inow to spende, And god shall send vs mare! But, maystur, to the covrtte wille we wynde: To make you mery, that levys behynde, God forbede, that ye spare!â 29 The chyld wolde no lengur to abyde, But arayde hym ryally to ryde And to the courte gan cayre; Talamewe wyth hym gan fare. Alssone as they come thare, They were resseuyd full fayre. The courte was plenere all that day Off worthy lordes, the sothe to say, And other grette repeyre; A duke had doone an other wronge, Att grette debatte had byn longe For holdynge of an ayre. 30 That day the fere hade made hem frende And broughte that grette debate to ende, So ys she ware and wyce. Ladyes wote, that she will nat Abowtte hur suffyr no debatte, So grette goodenes in her lyse; Her meyny lovy her euer ilke one. In to the hall comys Ipomadon Amonge thes lordes of price; An even pase forthe he paste, Nother to softe ne to faste, But at his owne devyce. 31 Lordes, laydes, in the hall Lokes on hym, men and all, And grette mervaylle they Ã¾ought, He was large of lyme &amp; lythe, And made so wonder them wythe, Of fetter faylyd hym nought. A llyttell wax he rede for shame, Full welle that coloure hym became, Before that high he sowghtte; His dobelett was of red welvet. Off bryght golde botuns ibete, That worthely was wrovghte. 32 His mantell was of skarlett fyne, Furryd wyth good armyne, Ther myght no better been, The bordoure all of red sendell; That araye became hym wele, To wete, wyth outen wene. A noble countenavnce he hade, A blyther and a better made Before they had not sene. Also bryght his coloure shone, All hym lovyd, that lokyd hym one, Bothe lord and lady shene. 33 And longe hym beheldes the fere, But no thynge chaunges her chere For carpynge of the crowde; Her hertte is sett so mekyll of wyte, Wyth love it is not dauntyd yte, Thow?e she be shene in scherovde; But aftur sore it bande the fre, And so I wold, that all ye shuld be, That is of love so prowde! The chyld before her knelys than And to the lady he began To tell his tale on lowde; 34 He sayd: âDereworthy damysell, Grette god kepe the in hele And all thy fayre mene! Vnder heyvyn is holdyn none So worthy a lady, as thow arte on, Ne of so grette bewete: Ofte sythes this haue I harde saye: A nobler courte, then thyne allwaye, There may non holdyn bee; The to serve haue I thowghte, Thereffore haue I hedyr sought Oute of farre contre. 35 What as thou wilte, put me tow: That longes a gentill man to doo, Gladlye I wille do; Thereffore I praye the me tell, Whedur thow will I wyth the dwell Or wynde, thedyr I come froo! On asay now shall I see, Yff it be, as men say of the In countreys many and moo!â The lady satt and hym behylde, And lykyd full wele the tale, he tolde, When she hym hard say soo, 36 That he wold hur servand be; She behyldes his grette bewte And in her hertt she thought, That he myghte wyth grette honoure Haue seruyd kynge or emperoure, He was so worthy wroughte; A thynge in her hert gan ryse, That she shuld lyke wele hys seruyce, Forgoo hym wold she nought; She answeryd hym full curtesly: âThou arte welcome, belamye, I thanke hym, that the browghte! 37 Syn thou to seruys will be sett, What ys thy name, Ã¾ou stravnge valete, Anon that thou tell mee!â âI was callyd at home by the same name, And borne I was in ferre contre: Forther wotte ye not for me, Wheddyr ye blysse or blame!â The lady att his wordys lough, She sayd: âSone, this holde I good inowe, It is a noble name, And thou artte welcome securly!â His mayster sayd, that stode hym by: âGravnte mercy, madame!â 38 The lady callyd hur botelere: âThis cupe of gold Ã¾ou shalte take here And gyff hit to younde man, To buttrey dore lede hym wyth the, Ther wyth of wyne to serue me: We shall se, yf he can!â The butteler hym the cuppe betoke, And he was fayne &amp; not foresoke, To the chylde sayd he thanne: âIt ys my ladyes prayere, That thou off wyne shall serue here!â In covrte thus he began: 39 Rightte in his mantell, as he stode, Wyth the botteler forthe he yode, The cupe on hande he bare; All that lovyd Ã¾at chyld beforne, For that dede lovghe hym to skorne, Bothe the lesse and the more; Yff that he shuld serue one, It were semande, they sayd ilkone, Away his mantell ware; But littill knewe Ã¾ey his entente: To the buttery dore he went And offe he caste hit yare. 40 To the boteler than went hee: âSyr, this mantell gyff I the, As I haue happe or sele: And thow wilte take Ã¾is sympull gyfte, It shall be mendyd, be my thryfte, Wyth efte so good a wille!â The butteler thankyd hym curtesly And sayd: âGentyll syr, gramercy Off this frenshipe I felle, And in owght Ã¾at I can do or saye, Be grette god, that oweth this day, It shall be quytte full wele! 41 For this VII yere, be my thryfte, Was not gevyne me suche a gyfte!â The mantyll he toke hym tille. All them, that thowght skorne before, Thought them selfe folys therefore, They satt and held them stille And sayden, it was a gentill dede: âThere may no man, so god vs spede, Other wyse say be skylle!â All they spake in prevyte: âA hundyrd men may a man se, Yet wott not one his wille!â 42 This dede saw the lady clere, How he gaffe to the butelere That gyfte of grette bewete; Tille her selffe she sayd for thy: âYounde dede ys doon full gentilly, Be god and be my lewte! Where he euer come or what he is, He can of convenence, iwys, Be younde full wele I see!â She sayd to hem, Ã¾at by her stode: âThis chyld is comyn of gentille blode, It may no nother weye bee!â 43 The cope he brought before hyr syne And seruyd the fre wyth the wyne So worthely alweys, Tille III yere ende were comyn &amp; gon. The lady, she thought, she saw neuer one, So mekyll to halde to prayse; And in the courtte now he es Louyd bothe wyth more and lesse, So gydyde hym in his dayes. But a condycyon havys he, That I shall say, sore rewys me, All ladyes to love it lays. 44 Covarde be countennaunce he semyd, To hardenes nothynge he yemyde, To melle hym there wyth all: When knyghttes yede to turnement, There to wold he take no tente, Nother grette ne smalle; Of dedes of armus when they spake, Ipomadon wolde turne his bake And hye oute of the hall; He wold here of no chevalrye; Prowde men of the cowrte for thy Cowarde gan hym call. 45 By syde ther was a fayre foreste; Huntynge lovyd he alder beste, To see his grehoundes rinne; Gamen of houndes was all his thought, Be dede of armys sett he noughte, That was parsauyd hym in, Of chevalry wold he not here; Grettly that myslyked the fere, He wold no worshippe wynne: âAllasâ, she sayd, âso mekyll fayrenes Ys loste on hym wyth outen proves: Yt is a sory synne! 46 Allas, that euer so grette gentryse Ys loste on hym for cowardise, Woo worthe destone, Syn he is so fayre of face, That god had not gevyn hym that grace, Of hertt hardy to bee! For, were he a man of hardynes, As bovnte semys &amp; bewte es, Be god and be my lewte, On lyve I know non lewand nowe, That cordes so well to myn avowe In all this world, as hee!â 47 Thus she monys the stravnge valete; To love hym yf her hertte be sett, It makys here lekyng lake, That he sett be no chevallrye; To euery he spendys so largely, That all good of hym spake. Then sum men of his huntyng lowe, Sum therefore was wrothe inow, That harde behynde his bake. Thow the lady hym wolde not chyde; For hym in herte many a tyde Her thovght asunder wold breke. 48 In somer seson it befell, When flovrys were sprong, swete of smell, And fowlys songe bedene, The fre bethought her at Ã¾at tyde, That she wold on huntyng ryde In to the foreste grene; She bad her men, the sothe to saye, They shuld be redy the VIII day Amonge the schawes schene: âIn to the foreste wyll we fare, To hunte at the herte full yare, That longe has soveryd been!â 49 Her meyne made them redy faste, On the VIII day to wood they paste, As was her comaundemente. Vppon a lavnde fayre and wyde Be a rennande reuer syde They sett that ladyes tente; There was there dere won, When they were wery for rwne Wythe baynge on the bente, Or any reysyd oute of araye, Grette herttes, to byde the bay, To the watter wente. 50 Logys and pavelons they pyghte For erle, baron, &amp; for knyghte, That huntyd in that foreste. Ipomadon was not the laste, His horne abowte his halse he caste And went in to the weste. [In to the depe foreste.] How so they dothe of other thynge, Of justus or of tvrnaynge, Huntynge lovyde hee beste; Thow?e he set be no chevalrye, Moste he couthe of venarye, There on his hert was feste. 51 For she schuld moste of solas see, On the lavnde they set Ã¾at bryght of ble, And many a man her wythe; Hunters blewe there hornys Ã¾at stovnde, Caste of and oncowpelyd ther hounde, Foundes in to the frythe; Dyueres weys went her men, To reyse the dere oute of there denne, Lyght of lyme and lythe; For bugelys blaste &amp; brachys crye Wyth oppon mowthe full veralye There myght no best haue grythe. 52 Hym besyed faste Ipomadon, For why he cowthe inowgh Ã¾erone, Lowde his horne he blewe; Wyth hym he toke a lytill rache, The dere oute of there kyth to cache, The coste full wele he knewe; That was a brachet of thee beste, That euer wold trewly queste And securly pursewe; He hyes hym oute of all the prece, Thre greyhoundes he lade in lese, His maystur Tholamewe. 53 Hornys blewe and houndus ranne Wyth oppyn mowthe full mery than And many bugels blaste; A noble noyse it was to here, In hertte full wele yt lykyd the fere, There houndes fell to so faste Ipomadon, a hertte he chase, His hounde so gladely to hym gos; This grette hertte at the laste. 54 So wery was for ron that day, That, on the bent to byde the bay, To the watter he made hym bowne. The littell hounde nyghed hym so nere, In myddys of the lavnde before the fere For feyntes fell he downe; Forther myghte he go no foote, So had Ã¾is hertt be holdyn hoote Wyth that brache browne; The hounde also myghte renne no more, For feyntenes fell downe before That lady fayre off facyown. 55 So wery for renne wer they tow, A foote further myghtte noÃ¾er goo, But fell before the fere; A littill fro hym Ã¾is hounde lay, Att the grette hertte questyde aye, That saw that lady clere; Att the brachet lowde she low?e: âNow, sertes, he can of fete inow?e, That Ã¾us his hounde gan lere: Hym selffe comys sone, he is not ferre!â Ipomadon drawythe nere, Where he is hounde gan here. 56 As a hunter all in grene He come before that bryght &amp; shene, And on his foote he lyghte; His kyrtell covyrd not his kne, To that grette hertte gon is hee And seruyd hym full right; He lacys the slowche, to fede the hounde, Then sayd the lady in the stovnde Tille her maydens bryghte: âFolowe me, for I wille wende, To se younder curteys chyld &amp; hende, How he younder dere gan dyghte! 57 More helpe ne hade he noughte, But the hounde, that hym to bay brou?te, When he this hertte hade slayne!â Ipomadon, in a thrawe Aftur his maystur he wendes to blowe Welle forthe on the playne. The brachett by the hertte lay stylle, He wold not let no man come hym tille, The sothe ys not to layne, Ne sertes he wold not takyne be, This hounde, of no man, till he se, His maystur was comyn agayne. 58 And when he sawe his maystur thore, He dyd his besynes the more, It shulde the better bee; The hedde he corvde wonder well, And sethe vndyd euery dele Full fayre before that fre. All, that she sawe of oÃ¾ur men, Tille hym she held but fablis then, So deyntely dede hee; Agayne in to her tent she turnys, In hertte for hym full mekyll she mornys And cursyd his destone, 59 That in so mekyll fayrenes for?ete, That ne hade poynte of prowes sete: âFor suche a noÃ¾er know I no, So fayre, so curteys, as he es,â But for he louyd no hardenes, The lady was full woo; She thynkys to haue Ipomadon, And thought agayne: âThynke not there on!â Thus turnythe she tow &amp; fro. âAtt the laste of love drewry Dystrwes defawte of chevallrye: Alas, why ys it so? 60 For hym to love, yf I had thoughte, To myne avowe acordes he nought: That makyth myne hertte vnblythe; That prowde sory vowe, that I Made be my grette folye, Now makyth me wrynge &amp; wrythe!â Wyth hur owne hete, thus she thowght That amys, that she wroughte, And sykynge sayde sythe: âI shall love neuer no knyghte, But he be man of myghte, His costes for too kythe! 61 For louyde I hym sekyrlye, All men ther of wold haue envy And praye, god shuld them wreke; They wold saye: âBe oure lady, nowe She hathe well sett her grette avowe On a febyll freke!â I trowe, that tyme shall com above, That I mvn fynde a knyght to love, That wele a schafte can breke: But, sertes, my love is so isete, That hym to love I may no lette, What so euer they speke!â 62 Ipomadon hym bysyes faste Wondere-wele hym bare; That day he brought to quary tenne, Moo than dyde all other men, Of noble herttes, that were. The sonne beganne to drawe downe, They hyed them to pavelyown Before Ã¾at wyse off lare; Ipomadon lowde blewe, Full well that fere his horne knewe, That she hade herde it are. 63 His maystur Thalamewe &amp; he Blowes aftur mo mene, Semble where they sholde Sevyn heddes he brought to present, She rose and gayne hym wente, Vppon them to beholde. So grette heddes, as they were, The lady thoughte, she sawe neuer ere, That made were on molde. 64 In a stody full stylle she stode: I hope, here lokynge dyd here goode, Be god and my lewte! The righte, I trowe, who vndertoke, She had more luste, on hym to loke, Then any herttes hedde to see. Whenne erlys &amp; baronys asemblyde wore, All they gaffe, bothe lasse and more, Before that bryghte of ble The pryce to that straunge valet, That came alone wyth his brachet, And sayd: âBeste worthy ys he!â 65 A cosyn had that lady bryghte, A noble chyld, that Jason highte, Ryghtte bygge of bone &amp; blode, And fro he had Ipomadon sene, They lovyd, as they brethryn been, To gedder ay they yode. In a swtte they bothe were clade, Grette joye of them the ladye hadde, They were so fayre and goode; So semely chyldern, as they tow, In all the curte was no moo, Ne mylder of there mode. 66 The tow wyshe and to supper yede; Ipomadon toke good hede, His cope forgate he noughte, To the bottry went he syne And made hit there be fyllyd wyth wyne And to the borde it browghte; Here lokynge hade she not forgetton: âSay, valettâ, she sayd, âhas thow etton? To day thou haste welle wroughte!â âDamysellâ, he sayd, ânot yete Drynke I dranke ne mete I ete, Fro bale as I be broughte!â 67 âSyr, that ys to longe, be skyll, My cosyn Jason call the tille, For suppud, I wold, ye hadde, In the flore before me sett ye adowne!â They bothe were att her byddyng bown And dyd, as she them badde. There was berlyde at Ã¾at suppere Drynke, that sethyn was bought full dere Wyth many a syghyng sade, And lyke brethryne they toke them thore, That aftur rewyde sum full sore, Ofte sythes to gamen onglade. 68 Whate myghte Ã¾at be, but derne love, That all ways wyll be above To them, that shall it havnte? All othere thynges men davnte may, But, sertenly, be no waye Love wille not be davnte! Who presus ofte to serue hytte, Worse schall have his gurdovn quyte, For he be loves seruante. Who entrys in to lovys scolys, The wyseste is holdyn moste foolys, Fro that they haue graunte. 69 How so it be, this lady yinge Makythe many a love-lokynge, But foly thoughte sche non, And yet she thought, it dyd here good; That full wele vnderstode The chyld Ipomadon; He caste her many a lovely loke, Full well that lady vndertoke, That he wyth love was tone; She drede, that it shuld ryse Ã¾orow chaunse, Sum slavnder thorow countenavnce, He lokyd so here vppon. 70 For in a stodye styll he sate, That mete and drynke clene he forgate, So mekyll on hur he Ã¾oughtte; There att the fere began to smyle And bethought hur on a wyle, How sche hym schastys moughtte; In hertte sche thynkes so to devyce, Be hyr owne cosyn hym to chastyce, That other parcevyde yt noughte. âJasonâ, âsche sayd, âfor goddes payne, Why lokys thow so vpon Imayne? What has my mayden mys-wroughte? 71 What ayles the man, for god avowe? Say, damysell, ys this for yowe, That Jason lovys so haate?â Rede for shame wexyd that may And sayd: âCertes, madame, naye, Not that I of watte!â Jason ofte she turnyd vntille: âWhate weneo thou, fole, Ã¾at ladyes wille, Her love be on the latte, On the to lay for curtesye? Nay, in feythe, sekyrlye, Then loste they there estate! 72 Be thou neuer of so grette bewte, Trowes thou this lady bryght of ble Here loue on the to laye For fayrehedde or for any largenesse, But thow were man of proves?

Nay, syr, I say the securly, Thou comyste not so above!â Jason, in a stody he sate, That mete &amp; drynke he forgatte, So drede hym that reprove, Hym thought, for tene his hert wold brest. Ipomadon full wele wyste, She sayd for his behove; 74 He sayd: âJason, broÃ¾er, be Ã¾ou stylle, And that thou take it at no ille, I praye the specyallye: Yff she haue gevyn the Ã¾is vmbrayde, It ys for good, that she hathe sayde, Greve the not for thy!â But welle wyst Ipomadon, The wordes were sayd for hym ychone, Spokyne of that ladye, And therefore was he shamyd full sore, That on hur durste he loke no more, She toke good hede ther by. 75 All dropyng downe held he his heued, All lykynge love fro hym is reued, So herde his hertte was sette. When the sopper was all done, To chambyr went that lady sone; Her lordes, wyth ovten lette, Toke leve and to there innys ys goone; Before hyr knelyd Ypomadon And hur full godely grette: âHave good nyghte, damysell, for I mvst wende!â What meanys this? Ã¾ought Ã¾e lady hende, This dyde her mechyll unsete. 76 But neuer the lesse, for parseyvyng sake Countenaunce of love she wolde non make, But gravntyd hym leve to goo, And that repent her syth full ille; The dore tille he was comyn tille, Here eye come never hym fro; For love she myghte stonde Ã¾er no langer, The lady thaught, for pure angur Here herte wold braste in tow; To her chambyr sche her spede, Tomblyd downe vp on her bede Wyth wrythyng and wyth woo. 77 She callyd Imayne, here mayden fre, And bade, hyr bed shuld redy be, That sche myght bye there inn; No thynge sche slepyd all the nyght, But ofte tymes turnyd and sadely syghte, Her gerdyll waxit thyn, And sayd: âDere god, wherefore &amp; why And wethyr thou thus sodaynly TO love hym schall begynne, So worthy lordes, as Ã¾ou haste sene, Prynces and many dukes bedene, And kyngges of noble kinne? 78 Never the les yt saw I neuer none So godely, so fayre of flesche and bonne, So kynde ne so curtays: A fole, so thynkys thee! Trowyste thou, Ã¾at Ã¾er any oÃ¾er bee, Here loue so one hym layese? Nay!

Sertes, I maye! Be grette god, that made me, nay, I may not do ther too, For thou, hertte, ys so on hym sett, Ãat hym to love Ã¾ou wylt not lette, For oughte, that I may doo! Are they not sorow worthy be lawe, That willfuly will ouer hem sorow drawe?â Thus tyll her selffe sayd scho. âCursyd pryde, woo mot thou be! Thou bryngys me to lowe degre And reves me reste and ro! 80 It hathe byn sayd in lest of love, That aftur pryde comythe grette reprove, Of the wysest yet that was: Prowde in hertte ay haue I been, Therefore I haue afalle, I wene, It nedys no helpe to asse. Euer more worthe ys sempylte, Then ouer-provde or fers to be, For ay that poynte wille passe! Had never man so grette reprove, As I gaffe hym this nyght fore love; Why dyd I so, alas? 81 I myghte haue had hym, when I wolde, And all my purpos to hym tolde: A, wetles wreche, lett bee! Alas, foule, what haste thou sayde? Reson wolde, Ã¾at thou were prayde, Thou shuld not praye, par de! A lord, what I haue ben fers: I thought no kynge ne prynse my pers Ne no man in no degre, And now thys lythe belerte I am Of love, and I wott not, wyth whame, Ne wott not, what ys hee. 82 Ne, sertes, his name know I nought, Ne in what londe he shuld be sought, And he were fro me goone: Me nedyd not to love for thy The kyng of Pers or of Araby, And now my hert ys tane, Yet me mvst love att lowere degre, But, sertus, a fayre one than hee Was neuer of blode ne bone, A kyndere nor a curtysure, Thorow this world thow? men shuld spere: That makys me make this mone! 83 So fayre, so good in all thynge, He come neuer lowere than of a kynge, This dare I savely saye! Who, so thynkes the, foll, &amp; no moo: Hopys thou, Ã¾at all other thynke hym soo? I say the, securly, naye! Trowes thou any other ther bee, That lokes on hym wyth suche an ee, As thou haste done all waye? Nay, I hope, as I haue roo! Yes, in faythe, I hope thei doo, Ellys ille avyssud were they! 84 For there ys nother old ne yinge, But they mvst love hym ouer all thynge, He ys so fayre and goode: Yesturnyghte settynge by Jason Full swettely lokyd he me vppon, That mynges thus all my mode; But more of huntynge, I hope, he thoughte, Thenne anye loue in hertte was wroghte, That blythe of bon and blode! Nay, that trowe I not, par de: Why lokyd he so faste on mee, But he love vnderstoode? 85 He toke his leve, whon he shuld fare, And, sertes, so dydde he neuer are, Syn fyrste that I hym kende! That was to his inn to goo! Nay, in faythe, I trowe not soo: It was, his weye to wende! Nay, I hope! Yes, in faythe, Yestur nyght thou lokyd on hym so laythe, No wonder, thow? he wold wende! Yf he goo, then mvste I dye, Or els in care belefte am I For euer wyth owtyne ende! 86 Alas, whye he Ã¾us parte awey? Be god of hevyn, I hope, naye! Yes, in fayth, he will! Thou cowde not hold thy peas, but chyde, He were a foule, and he wold byde, Me thynkes be prove &amp; skylle! Yf he goo, wonder the nought: Yesturnyght so grette shame Ã¾ou hym wrought, Alas, Ã¾ou dyd full ylle! He may goo wyth an lawghyng herte, And thou, thy selffe hit gertte, Shalte leve in mornynge stille. 87 But yf he to morow abyde, I shall hym shewe no poynte of pride, Yff god will geve me grace; Curtesly I wyll hym call And wyth good wille tell hym all My covncell of Ã¾us casse. Ressone wille, it is not to layne, He shuld not love, but he be lovyd agayne, He ys so fayre of face; Bettur were me, suche ane to haue, Then anny tow, so god me save, Me thynkes, on ground Ã¾at gaase.â 88 Wyth hyr owne hertt Ã¾is she strave, That rest that nyght she cowde non haue, That for hur selffe was bad, That she shuld entur so farre in love, Hit shuld hur doo sum grett reprove, She was so streytly stadde; Wyste she, on morowe how it shuld fare, Her grette sorowe doblyde ware, And yet inowgh she had; Her mynde was not but for to morne. Agayne to hym will I retorne, That nyght what lyffe he ladde. 89 When the chyld his leve had tane, To his in he is ganne Wyth sorowys &amp; sykynge sare; He saw right nought, Ã¾at was hym leffe, All thynge, he Ã¾ought, dyd hym greffe In ye, bothe lesse and more. His maystur Thelamewe he prayed, That his bedde were redy arayde: âThere in, I wold, I wore!â Off all the nyght he slepyd no Ã¾inge, But lay wyth many a sore sykynge And mornyethe aye more &amp; more. 90 Alas, foule, what alysse the, Soo farre oute of thy owne contre Heddur for to come? Thou dyd, as many haue done are, Come to seke sorye care, And ther of hathe Ã¾ou som. Thou myghttes no man, but Ã¾i selffe, blame: Thyne owne wille made Ã¾e come fro hame, Thereffore no man wille the moone. As euer haue I happe or skelle, That makes Ã¾ou, lady, euery dele, Yet love makes me so dome. 91 Be god of heyvyn, now I wott well, That she parcevys hit euery dele, How I wyth love was tane, And thoo she gyffe me wyth vpbrayde, Hit was for gode, Ã¾at she me sayde, Thow?e I toke hit wyth none; Therefore spake she all Ã¾at Ã¾inge, To make me leve my longe lokynge, That I caste hur vppon 92 There att, I wotte welle, she gave tene, Yet be hur owne cosyn, as I wene, She blamyd me for thye And sayd, it was a skorne, parde, That anny suche brothels as we Anny ladyes love shuld thye, That nought Ã¾inkyth for to thryve Nor neuer gyffys in oure lyve To no chevalrye; But ther was an oÃ¾ur Ã¾inge: On me she cast an longe lokynge, I toke good hede there bye. 93 A, dere god, what myghte Ã¾at mene? I shall the tell all bedene: Younde lady ys so whyce, In fayth, she holdythe me but a foole, That shuld me melle of lovys scole, That neuer wanne losse ne price; Now, sertes, Ã¾at trowe I well for thy, She lokyd and spake so angurlye And callyd vs euer full nyce: Of helle yt is the hottest payne, To love and be not lovyd agayne, There on no wysdome lyese. 94 Now, hertte, I praye the, lett hur be! Nay, Ã¾at maye I not, parde, Yf thow wylte, I were slayne! Yes! Nay, in faythe, I, For thou, hertte, artte sett so sodenly, Thou wilte not turne agayne. Why? I wotte neuer, whereffore, But dede, I had leuer, I wore, Then longe to dryve this payne; Dyd neuer love man so deyre: Had she parte, yet rovghte I neyre, In faythe, then were I fayne! 95 We, leef, what dyd thou in this londe? I came to seke and I hur fonde, That aye wille do me dere. He fallythe, that puttes hym selfe so farre, That all his lyffe louythe to warre, Thus darre I savely swere! Yet is ther non, that wotte that, Ne whens I come ne what I hatte, So prevely I am here; Shalte thou tell them? Sertes, naye And gette the schyld and spere, 96 And wen the price, &amp; Ã¾en may Ã¾ou Acordynge be to her avowe, For thou have gotton losse. Yet in her cowrte there ys none, That so mekyll of bowrdyng can Ne of all gamus, that goose, Bothe wyth schyld and schafte to ryde, But so, that lorne ys all thy pryde, Thereffore all men be thy foos: In erthe ys none so worthy a knyght, But yf his dede be shewyde in syght, Men will no good sopose. 97 And vnder pryde so arte thow hyde, That for a cowarde art thou kyde Bothe wyth lesse and mare, And yf thou now thy selfe schuld rose, Men wold say: All this he dos, His spendyng for to spare; Of suche dedes have we not sene, As he awauntes hym of bedene, Hym semes of bownte bare! Therefore thy way I rede the gange: In faythe, and thou dwell here lange, It moo the sorow full sare! 98 Foole, wille thou lyghttly goo Fro thy love, and lovys her soo? Be god, I may not byde! May thou goo? Sertes, naye! Yes, in faythe, I hoope, I maye! Suche harmys in hertte I hyde. To morowe thou goos, yf Ã¾ou haue querte! Yea, and thou haue anny hertte, Thou turnys not that tyde! Here has thou take thy leve for aye, That nedys behovys the love all way, Where thou shalte goo or ryede! 99 And here shall thou wynne no Ã¾inge, But many a skorne of old and yinge: Lo here this foole for the! Who so maye be nere hys love, Sumtyme love, it comys above, Be they neuer so slee, And fere there fro yf he be browghte, Then shall no man witte his thought, But his hertte and hee. On thynge ys, yf he take kepe: Sore is he bett, that darre not wepe, Be god and be my lewte! 100 He hathe no myghte, Ã¾at mornynge gas, Ne no ese, that sorowe hase, This darre I trewly telle!â Thus lythe he wrynggyng tow &amp; fro Wyth many a sory syghyng so And mewsus ay in mell; A while to go he ys in wille, AnoÃ¾ur stovnde to hold hym stille Wyth Ã¾at gay damysell. To hym selfe he told Ã¾is tale: âMight I byde, I were all hale! Be god, I may nought dwell! 101 For love my herte hathe bovnde so faste, That euer more love will wyth me last To tyme, that I shall dee; It ys full swete, to enter in love, But ay more &amp; more it brynges above To sorowe, &amp; that I se. Who so euer ys takyne Ã¾er wyth, Or wythe inne hem he lythe, Full sore schall bovnden be. Wyth a sorovfull hertte I mon wynde, And sche in quarte mon leve behynde And haue no maynde on me!â 102 Where he was, well he ne weste, In towne or in wylde foreste, So mekyll on here he Ã¾oughte; But aye was the last ende, He toke his purpose hole to wende, And byde ne wold he noughte. No thynge he slept of all Ã¾e nyght, And when the day daved lyght, Vp fro his bede he soughte. In come his maystur Thelamewe And sawe, he was pale of hewe, So grette wo love hym wroughte. 103 His maystur than began to spere And sayd: âI praye you tell me, sere, Ayels you awoght but good? Of all this nyght ye had no reste, But many a gresly grone ye vp caste, That grettly menges my moode!â âThow?e I myght for sorow synke, Maystur, ye wold no wonder thynke, And ye wyst, how hit stode!â The sothe to tell hym wold he nought, For no thyng, that he cowde owghte, [But faynyd hym seke] That he nou?te vnder-yode. 104 âMayster, I schall tell Ã¾e now ryghte: A wonder dreme I dremed to nyghte, Vnglade that gars me goo; The sothe fro you I will not hyede: Me thought, my fader had loste a syde, My moder another also, And therby darre I well warrande, They ar bothe dede or ellys nyhande, That warkes me all this woo. In to my contre wille I ryde, Here wille I no lengur byde, For frenshipe nor for foo! 105 And, maystur, me thynkes, it were the beste, We wend in to younder thyk foreste And made vs redy thare; For be god, that ys but one, Of oure wendyng, he ys non, I wold, the wyser ware!â Welle wend his maystur Thalamewe, The tale, he told hym, had byn trewe, And thedyr gan they fare; Sone were chargyd the somors towe, Wyth sorowfull hertt forthe they goo And many a syghyng sare. 106 He for her love hym selffe lyste And she for hym, &amp; no Ã¾ing wyste His maystur Thelamewe; Yf they cowde neuer so mekyll of arte, Love them betwene well ys parte, For bothe one draught they drewe. Thow?e grette loste of love hit garte, Ayther of them hath oÃ¾ers herte, Ye trowe this tale for trewe! 107 Thow?e this chyld his way gan fare, His hertte he levys in ostage Ã¾are, So mekyll of hur he thought, And hyrres away he beyrethe, That brethen hym full littill deryÃ¾e, For why he knewe hit noughte; He hathe the tonne &amp; she Ã¾e tother, But noÃ¾er of them comfortyd oÃ¾er, So warely they wroughte; Betwene them burgenyd such a bravnche, That in Ã¾er lyves schall neuer stavnche, Tille they on bere be brought. 108 Ipomadon went his waye Sythen forther on the day, Hovndes of hath he caste; In the forest gan they fare, At the herttes to hounte Ã¾are, Wyth many a bugell-blaste; A way traversyd come Jason And mett wyth Ipomadon, Hyinge wonder-faste, His hors trussud wyth his harnes; Jason grettly wonderd wes And of his purpose aste: 109 âWhedur, broÃ¾er, whedder arte Ã¾ou bovn?

In the mornyng yerlye Ã¾at lady rose, Oute of her pavelyone on she goos, Abowte her she toke good heede, Yf sche sawe oughte the straunge valet; To love hym thowgh hur hertte be sette, Euyre more has she dredde, 115 That he shuld be frome hur went; So come her cosyne ouer the bent And on his foote he lightte. âWhat tydynges, Jasone, I the praye!â âMadame, yf I the sothe schall saye, No wors be they ne myghte!â âHow soo, cosyne, be god alonne?â âYour valette, damysell, ys agoone, Ofte grette you wele that wyghte!â âWhiche?â sche sayd; âÃe valet straunge: Ye of hym schall haue chalenge Nether be day ne nyght!â 116 âYs he goone?â âMadame, yea!â âWhotte thow oghte, why?â âMadame, na, As haue I joye or blis!â âDyd anny man hym aught but righte?â âNay, but a dreme, he dremyd to nyghte, Hathe made hym wend, iwys!â She hard neuer tydynges ore, That sche was halffe so sory fore, But he pursevyd not this; She answeryd, thow sche were woo: âYe, cosyne, lett hym goo, Good aventure mut be his! 117 But has he trussyd his harnys?â âYe, and his maystur also his!â Then was she woo all weye; Thow?e sche lett, as sche ne rovghte, The contrary in hur hertte sche Ã¾ou?te, For sorowe mornyd Ã¾at maye: âJason, now thy selfe maye se, That Ã¾ou wyth me ne I wyth the May not won all waye, And ofte ys sayd in old saw: Lett hym goo, he was a felowe!

His moder gaffe hym hyr blessynge And dyede wyth oute more tareynge And fro this world can passe. 142 Ryghte sory was Ipomadon, And so was all the courte eche chone, For his moder was dede; Women wepte and colovre caste, They sayd, for sothe, sche was Ã¾e best, That euer on erthe myghte trede. All that hyr seruyde before, Grette gyftes sche gave, bothe lasse &amp; more, Of syluer &amp; gold so redde.

There he wold no lengur byde, But toke his leve, &amp; forthe gan ryde, Att kyng and berde in bowre; He travellyd euer fro land to lande, To wynne his los and price wyth hande, Where styff men were &amp; stoure; In Brettayne, Fraunce &amp; Lumbardy, In Allmayne and in Arabye They hylde hym for the floure. 147 Where euer he came at any werre, Euer more the price away he bere, So boldely he hym bare; He wex so worthy a man of hande, Agayne his stroke myght no man stonde, He set them so sade &amp; sare. But so prowd was Ipomadon, What he was, there wyste no mon, Nother lesse ne more; And also his men comaundyd he, They schuld tell no man of no degre, Off whens ne whatte they ware. 148 Men covthe not calle hym, there he came, But the worthy knyghte, Ã¾at had no name, In cuntres fere and nere; In suche londes, where he come inne, Bothe love and los he gan to wynne Of lordes and ladys clere, Los of lordes and love of ladyes, Of gentille damysellys &amp; wys, That grette and worthy were; But euer more in his hert he Ã¾ou?te, That love be reson myghte he nowghte No woman, but the fere. 149 And also thynkes this bryght of ble, Knyght in erthe, but it were hee, Shuld neuer to wyff her wedde. But noÃ¾er wyste of othere wille, But ovthere suffyrd grette ille, Ryght longe this lyff they leede. Ipomadon now leve we here, And speke we of that lady clere, That is strangely stede 150 Tow yere felt yt, that after sete, That went was Ã¾at straunge valet, The lady levyd stylle.

Well more sorowe then she hadde, These tydynges makythe here vnglad, Here hertte for bale wold brynne. 152 She sayd: âLordes, bothe more &amp; lesse, Wille I witte, sothe it es, This tale, ye haue me told!

When kynges spake of werryng, Ipomadon spake of huntynge, How he in forest founde; When euery knyght regyd hym to juste, To kepe there armowr fro the ruste, No thynge he wyth hem bounde. 238 Whan barons in gay aray ?ede, Ipomadon to the foreste grede, To hunte &amp; to haukynge; Whan knyghtes spake of stedes rounde, He spake of a fayre grayehounde And of no nother thynge. Knyghttes of the courte, boÃ¾e lesse &amp; more, To skorne lou?hen hym Ã¾erfore, That was his grette lykynge. He parcevyd the warnynges full well And lykyd the doyng ilk a dell, Bothe of knyght and kyng. 239 So longe they levyd in Ã¾is talent, The tyme is comyn of turnament, That they before had sett; Kyng Melengere, forgett it he nolde, His promys to kepe, that he shold, Betwene the II sees he fett [To hold that he had hyght] II Ml. knyghttes good, That were hy-borne of blode, The best, that he myght gette; Thedere wyth hym went Ã¾e quene And all his othere meyne bedene; Thus many a myle they mett, 240 Tille they come in to Calaber, Mekyll folke wyth hem there, That wyse and worthy wore; They wold not to Candores goo, But in a castell, a myle Ã¾er fro, The quene shuld soioyrne thore, Whiles they were at the turnament, And wyth hyr many a lady gent; Hyr comeforte was the more. That holde stode in the foreste, That Ipomadon knewe alÃ¾er best; Full well hym lykyd therefore. 241 Many tymes he had huntyd Ã¾er ine, The fyrste was not then to begynne, For there beganne his payne. That thike foreste lastyd all way To Candires, there the lady lay, There of he was full fayne. Knyghttes dyd Ã¾er besynes, Horse and harnes for to dres, All lou?hen at drewlerayne: He did but, as he was wonte, On the mornynge erly went to hunte, At eve come home agayne. 242 And grette wonder hade Cabanus, When he his felow saw thus, And lyghttly to hym yede; âSyr,â he sayd, âwell wayte ye, To morowe shall Ã¾is turnament be: Why raye ye not your wede? Ye haue hors &amp; noble harneys: Cast you, to be there all wayes, As god in heyvyn you spede! Dresse you, syr, and go we thedyre, We too shall all way be to geddur And ayther helpe othere at nede!â 243 When he off turnament spake so, Hee lokyd right, as he were woo, And sayde: âSo haue I sele, Now se I well, I fynd it nought, Full frenshipe in Ã¾e, as I haue sought, For grette hevynes I fele; Thou hard thy self, wyth out lesyng, I made a comnaunte wyth Ã¾e kyng, To serue my lady well: It is noÃ¾ur my wille ne myn entent Wyth justis ne wyth turnamente 244 Ne boke to ende in all his lyff, The warkes, that there were dy?te; And a bell stode Ã¾er on off gold, That was wysely made on mold: When wayttes shuld blow on ny?tte, It wold ringe a long while, That men my?te it here more Ã¾en a myle, To comfort kyng and knyght. 245 In this belle a stone stoode, A charebokyll ryche &amp; good; Lyght as the mone it shone. The tent was white as anny mylke, The bordures all of clene sylke, In Ã¾e werld was bettur non; There Malengere abydythe stille Wyth wyne and ale at all Ã¾er wille And knyghttes as trewe as stone; On ilke a syde they reysud Ã¾en For lordes and for gentilmen Tenttes monye one. 246 By Ã¾at was sett, come oÃ¾er grett plente, Dyueresse lordes of ferre contre, That worthy were and wyghte; Syr Monestus, I vnderstond, The kynges sonne of Irelond, That new was dubbyd kny?te; He had seruyd Malengere, In hope to have Ã¾at lady clere, A longe while day &amp; nyghte; Tow C knyghttes of hert thro He browght hym wyth &amp; many mo, In armure burneshed bryghte. 247 For all Ã¾e power, that he brou?te, I trowe, that lady gettes he nou?te, So mot I euer thryve! Then come the riche duke of Breytayne, That also her wold haue full fayne, Wyth fyftye skore knyghttes &amp; fyve; But he myght wynne Ã¾at lady hende, He Ã¾ought, or all were brou?te to ende, Wyth stalworthy men to stryve; All this travell lesythe hee; While sum men on lyve is, parde, He weldys her not to wyff! 248 Then come the duke of Normandy Wyth noble knyghttes a companye Well L and a skore, To haue Ã¾at lady, as he Ã¾ought; But, in faythe, he gettys her nou?te: His name was syr Astore. The kyng of Denmarke come after thanne, Wyth hym many a noble man, Right welle arayd Ã¾erffore, Off Skottelond &amp; off Norwaye, Off Irelond and of Orkeney, Yet spede they neuer Ã¾e more. 249 The woode was full of pavelyone, Wyth oute them, that lay in the towne, Ten thousand and moo; All that came oute of the west, They harbured them in the foreste, They wold no farthere goo. Be than was come Ã¾e kyng of Spayne Wyth II C knyghttes of mayne, That were of hertte full thro, The lady to have, that hathe hym forsakyn, Amfyon hathe he wyth hym takyn, And thought to wakyn Ã¾em woo. 250 The better spede he not Ã¾erffore: His name was syr Antymore, A styffe man and a stere. Amfyon had provde pensell, That wrought was of a damsyll Was in the feres chambere; But Ã¾er off wyst the lady nought, Syr Ottymore to feld it brought, That bought he sythe full dere. Syr Dayres come after thenne, The riche duke of Loren, He Ã¾ought to wynne Calabere. 251 To haue that lady was his cast, But yet he faylyd at the laste, Were she neuer hym so dere. The erle of Flaunders come in feld Wyth II C vnder sheld, Off worthy men that were; He brought in his companye Noble knyghttes oute off Russye, To wynne that lady clere; Syr Dryseus was his name, Yet fayls he, or he come home, To gett hur to his fere. 252 Provde Semyon, of Almayne The emperours sone, was not to layne, A styff man and a stronge, Cam theder wyth many a dou?tty knyghte, And yf he were neuer so wyghte, Yet fayls he hur to fonnge. Many other come be than, Well more, then I rekynne can, But I shuld byde ouer-longe; Some were wyth oute &amp; sum were wyth in. On the morowen the turnament shuld begyn, Whan that a bell had ronge. 253 Leve we now this folke thore And off the knyght speke we more, That dwellys wyth the quene; To serue hur, welle he did his tente, No semblaunte made he to turnament, There at was ladyes tene. The maydons hym to skorne lou?gh, There off had he joye inowgh, For he the sothe had sene. The quene to hur mete he sett And seruyd hyr, when she was sett, Right worthely, I wene, 254 And sythen agayne vp her ledde, And kyssyd that lady before her bedde, To speke he gan hym spede: âMadame, lett thy turnay to morn, I will hunte wyth hounde &amp; horne And bryng vs home a bred: I hold it better amonge Ã¾e okys, Then in turnament to take strokes, I kepe no blod to blede!â The maydons hym to skorne lough And seyd: âLoo, madame, your drew Spekys off doughtty dede!â 255 The quene cursyd his desteny, Wyth oute prowes Ã¾at he shuld be, That was so fayre off face; But sothe ys sayd in olde sawe, Whedur Ã¾at euer love will drawe, Lake no lettyng mase: She louyd hym well for his service, But oÃ¾ur damysels of pryse Grette skorne at hym hase; To there skorne toke he no hede, But toke his leve &amp; forth he yede, To the porter he gaase. 256 He gaf the porter a grette goldrynge And he sayd: âSyr, I love huntyng At rayne-dere and at roos, And as welle wott thow as I, He, that ys not there erlye, His best tyde mvst he lose; Therefore of o thyng I Ã¾e praye: Lett me forthe before the daye!â âIn faythe, syr, I sopposse, Whyles this offyce shall be myn, Entre &amp; issue shall be thyne, For frenshipe or for foos!â 257 Ipomadon to bede goos And in the mornyng erly he roosse, Or day began to sprynge; He gerte aray his why?te stede And all his armore, that hym was nede, Belyve he lett vp brynge; Sonne was covpled all his houndes, Wyth lowde blowyng forthe he foundes; That wakyd ladys yinge; They sayd: âLo, madame, your drewe Wyth horne and hounde se ye may now: He hyes to turnaying!â 258 The quene Ã¾er to wold take no kepe, But laye in bedde, purposyd to slepe, And sore forthought Ã¾at tyde, That he ne was man of prowes; Whedur she loved hym neuer the lesse, In hertt she it hyde. In the thykest place of all Ã¾at woode, A ermytage, he wyst, Ã¾er stode, And thedur gan he ryde; There he gert araye hym tyte, His stede and hym all in white, He wold no lengur byde. 259 âMaysterâ, quod Ipomadon, âTo day on huntynge moste ye goone: For goddis love I you praye, Yff god will send you any dere, Agayne the nyght abyde me here, I shall come, while I maye!â Fro then vnto the justyng plase A full depe dale ther was In a deerne waye: Couyrd-heddyd myght men ryde, No man myght se hym on no syde, Yf it were lyghte of day. 260 His mayster dyd his comaundement; Ipomadon his waye is went Thorow the thike woode; No man take wyth hym he lyst, But a chyld, Ã¾at he on tryste, Whiche was bothe fayre &amp; goode, Of his lond a barons sone, That wele hym serue con And ofte in stedde by hym stoode; The semely chylde Egyon Was cosyn to Ipomadon, Right nere sib of his blode. 261 In the mornynge erly He passyd thorow the derne sty, Be Ã¾at the day gan dawe, He hovis before that fayre castell, The wynd wavyd his whyght pensell, And waytes began to blawe, And ouer the walle Ã¾ey behylde And sawe hym hove in the feld, As why?te as any snawe. He cryed: âWake, lady bryghte, For sothe, younder hovis a knyghte, The feyrest, that euer I sawe! 262 His stede and he is all in why?te, That syght to se is grette dely?te, Fro bale as I be broughte!â The lady weyndis to a wyndowe And saw hym hove as white as snowe; In grette care is she broughte. So ne she wyst at that day, On whome she shuld her love laye, For in hur hertte she thought, She wold not the valet chaunge For emperoure nor for kyng stronge, Gette hym &amp; she movghte. 263 She beholdys the knyght in whyte, But what he was, she wot but lite, The more care had the maye; The sonne was vp on lofte be thenne, All the feld was full of men, There armys to assaye. The kynge of Spayne, syr Ottynore, Sawe the white knyght hove thore In armys good and gaye; To all his folke he sayde syne: âThe fyrste juste to day is myne, And I hold comnaunte aye!â 264 Wyth hym was syr Amfyon; The kyng comaundyd hys men ilkone, Stille they shuld abyde; He sayd: âYounder is for the feres love A kyng in white, wele dothe hove, And to hym will I ryde!â A grette spere in honde he nome, Ipomadon was ware, he come, And blemesshyd on anoÃ¾ur syde. Ayther on other brake Ã¾er speris, Ipomadon behynde hym beris Twenty foote Ã¾at tyde. 265 The kyng laye waltrand in his wede, Egyon of his hors toke hede And lyghttly lepte Ã¾er one; For all the strengh, Ã¾at he weldyÃ¾e, The riche kyng of Spayne hym ?eldyÃ¾e To Ipomadon. Joyfull was Ã¾at lady clere, How she ordayned, now shall ye here, Hyr owne cosyne Jasone, That he shuld serue Ã¾ere of speres, To what man that best hym beres, To the III dayes were goone; 266 And Ã¾erfore trewly she hym highte, The thryd day he shuld be knyghte, His good dedys to alowe. A spere to Ipomadon he bare, As he hadde neuer sene hym are, He sayd: âSyr, what artt thou?â âI am the laydes cosyn, syr, That thus is ordayned here be hur, Trewly for to trowe, That I shall serue here of speris Two what man that hym best beris, And, sertus, that I hold you, 267 For the man, that was of grettest boste, And hym, that my lady hatyd moste, In feld here haue ye felde!â For wele he wyst, it was reson, But he knewe not Ipomadon, To geddur that they had dwellde; But it was long beffore; Ipomadon likyd the more The tale, that he hym telde, And he sayd: âSyr, so god me spede, My presonere to thy lady lede, I wold, Ã¾at she hym helde! 268 Thou shalt haue to Ã¾i lady gent His hors, &amp; saye, Ã¾at I hit sent, The kyng to hur presone!â Syr Attynore than sorow hade, But vp he wanne, as he hym bade, And rydythe forthe wyth Jasone.

Thus endyrs-daye he hyght it me, Agayne that I shuld dubbyd bee, I shuld haue had hym thanne!â 272 Ipomadon sayd wyth myld mode: âSyr, syn thou knowest hym for so good, To stabull all our stryffe, Off my myght thou hym take, I vouche saff, for my lady sake, Were he worthe suche fyve!â Jasone thankyd hym herttly And sayd: âSyr, gramercye!â And vp he hathe hymgive. Hee ledde hym to Ã¾e lady bryght: âJasoneâ, she sayd, âbe goddis my?te, Ye begynne to thryue! 273 Who so wynnes &amp; who so los, Me thynke, not wyth out gift Ã¾ou goos, Be god &amp; be my lewte!â âMadame, Ã¾e knyght, Ã¾at gaff me Ã¾is, Wold god off heyven, ye were his, For noble inowghe is hee!â Syr Amfyon is men wer full woo, That her lord was slayne soo, To hym come grett plente; Tille a temple they hym bare And beryed hym, wyth oute more; Hit lykyd that lady fre; 274 For he had done her grette dyssesse And littill hym cast, hur to please, The whilis he was on lyve. In world was neuer a curteyser knyght, Then he wold, &amp; he myghte, Have wedde hur to wyffe. That knew not Ipomadon, All woo was hym, Ã¾at he was slone, But sonne was stynt Ã¾at stryffe. Jason in towre wold not abyde, To the why?te kny?t he hym hyde Wyth shaftes IIII or fyve, 275 And serued hym worthely off sperys, Many a bold man downe he beres, That preces into Ã¾e place. There was non, Ã¾at he hit, That lengur my?te in sadull sitt, But to the grounde he gaas. Stronge waxid Ã¾at turnament, Ipomadon Ã¾er haubrakes rente And brekes many a brace; He hew in sounder helme &amp; shyld And feld many knyghttes in Ã¾e feld, That wyght and worthy was. 276 Prowde Isomyon off Allmayne, Mekill folke he put to payne Be worthynes off werre; He was holdyn moste of myghte Off all next the whyte knyght, So dyd hym mekill dere. That parceuyd Cabanus, A kene knyght &amp; a corayous, In hand he hent a spere; To the emperoure he rode, And he to hym, wyth oute bode, Eyther oÃ¾ur downe gan bere. 277 Lyghttly vp agayne hem stertte, Pulde oute there swerdes wyth eygure hertte, To fyght they wold not fyne. The emperoure wyth a brond full bright Hit Cabanus on Ã¾e helme on hight, That nygh had done hym pynne; Before his visage the dent yede downe, Nere hand he had fallen in sowen, The emperoure saw hym lyand syne: âWhat, wenyst Ã¾ou, prowde knyght, Ã¾ou be At Palerne now, thy riche citte, Drynkand pyment or wyne? 278 Naye, thou art in turnamente!â Cabanus Ã¾erto toke good entent And was nere wood for wrathe; Wyth a styff swerd in Ã¾at stoure He smote of the eyre of Ã¾e emperoure And his lyfte arme bathe: âIn turnament, I wene, I be, That sore, I hope, forÃ¾ynkes the, Thy skornynge doth the skath: Now may thou skorne, wyne to drynke, But wher euer Ã¾ou goo, here on thynke, Thou levythe a wedde off wathe!â 279 Grette sorowe made the duke Dayres For his cossyn germayn, iwis, That was the emperoure; So hard Cabanus on the helme he hitt, That vnnethe a loft he my?te sitt, So stroke he in that stoure; He was so stonyed Ã¾er wyth all, Hus swerd oute of his hand gan fall, But sone come to hym succoure; Ipomadon Ã¾er to toke heede, To reskewe Cabanus he yede, That bought Ã¾e duke full soure. 280 Ipomadon wyth a swerd thenne Stroke the duke of Lorene Thorowe oute the good ventayle, That downe he fell as a stone; Off Ã¾at stroke they wondyrd ychone, So breste he many a mayll. On bothe sydes they turneyed faste, Blode oute off the brenniys braste, Be that the day gan fayle. All praysud the whyte knyght maste. Wyth outen dowte, he toke a shafte: One com, hym to assayle. 281 In a turnynge of his bake The duke off Breten a spere brake, That all to peces it yode. Ipomadon turnethe hym agayne And stroke the duke off Breteyne Wyth a swerd full good; On lofte myght he no lengur sitte, On the shulder he hym hitte, Benethe the ribbus it yode. His stede to the lady he sent: That day it was the last present; All that aboute hym stode 282 Sayd, for sothe, he was the best Off kny?tes, Ã¾at come fro est or weste; Thus graunt they hym the gre. Be Ã¾at the turnament gan twyn, Yche man drawethe to his inne, To towne and to citte. To the towne lokes Ipomadon, Soo was he warre off Jasone, And lowde on hym cryes he: âA, Jasone, brother, I the praye, Abyde, swette syr, yf Ã¾ou maye, A while, and speke wyth me!â 283 The tothere sayd: âBe goddes myghte, Syr, how wiste ye, how I highte?â âYes, Jasone, I the kenne: Thynkys Ã¾ou not off the strange valett, Att the super be the was sette?

Ipomadon prekyd in to the presse, Josane hym loste, wyth oute lesse, And sawe hym on no syde. Wyth sorowffull hertt, the sothe to say, He wyndythe home, where Ã¾e lady laye, Chaungynge hewe and hyde. 285 âJasone,â she sayd, âwhat ayls the, Off so hevy chere to be?â âRight so may ye, madame: To day haue ye lorne The best knyght, Ã¾at euer was borne, Yet know I not his name!â The lady sayd: âFor goddis myghte, What was he?

His mayster had huntyd full well Ã¾at day: In the foreste, the sothe to sey, Thre grette herttes hade he slon. 291 Ipomadon in his hert was fayne, That his mayster had this herttes slayne; When he the sothe had sene, Off he kyst his armore bright And as an hunter he hym dyght In a gowne off grene, A grette horne aboute his halse, His horse wyth his harnes alse Lede Egyon, I wene. To the citte by anoÃ¾er way Wyth lowde blowyng and grette bay He rydythe home to the quene. 292 Before the gates lowde he blew, The maydens hym to skorne low? And to the quene Ã¾ey sayde: âMadam, now comyth your derlyng Wyth hounde &amp; horne fro turnaynge; As swythe ye shall be payde Off noble stedys, Ã¾at he you brynges, That he hathe wonne off riche kynges, On grounde when he them layde.

Sone come the kynges chamburlayn Fro the turnament; Before the borde downe gan he knele: âMadame, the kyng gretes you wele, He hathe me hedur sent!â The quene sayd: âThoas, Ã¾ou art welcome: Syr, off thy tydandis tell vs sum, Who durst best byde on bent!â 295 âIn fayth, madame, Ã¾at can I nought, To tell you, who most worthy wrought Of all, that were comen thedur!â The quene sayd: âFye for shame, In faythe, syr, Ã¾ou art to blame, Whereffore come Ã¾ou home hedur, But Ã¾ou sum tythynges covth haue told?

Wythe ovte any more abyde To the armetage he ryde And garte araye hym thare, His stede &amp; hym all in rede; He sayd: âMayster, in that stede On huntyng mvste ye fare! 307 For goddis loue, do ye your myghte, Abydes me here agayne the nyghte, I pray you specyally!â His mayster hies on huntyng faste, Ipomadon his way is paste, Be that derne stye; The way prevely he nome, As he had oute off the citte come, That no man shuld hym spye; As a worthy knyght he workes yare, To helpe than, Ã¾at he hyede thare, Was his encheson, whye. 308 At the fyrst day wyth inn was he, Wyth oute thought he than to be, For they, dysconfyte, ware Wyth grette reddoure fled awaye, Off his strokes, the sothe to seye, So they were sad &amp; sare.

He stroke syr Manastus so sore, That hors &amp; man boÃ¾e downe he bare, The speris on sundyr brak. 316 Or any succure was to hym come, Ipomadon hath his sewrance nome Betwene Ã¾em too alonne; Jasone come to feld be Ã¾enne Wyth noble speres IX or X; Hym knewe Ipomadon, But he lette, as he hym neuer see, He sayd: âGood syr, of whens ar ye?â The tother answered anon: âA cosyne nere to the fere!â âNoble speres haue ye here: For goddis loue, lend me one!â 317 He sayd: âSyr, so god me save, Off the best shall ye haue: Chosse at your owne avyce, For worthely ye gan Ã¾em welde!

More to hym wold he not doo, His hors he broughte Ã¾e erle too And sett hym in the arsoune. Ilke a man to oÃ¾er sware, Suche a dede saw thei neuer are, Bothe erle and bold baroun. 323 They sayd, Ã¾er was non so mekyll off mayne; When Cabanus was recouered ageyn, Vppon his fote he stertte; He sware be god &amp; sent Myghell: âThus dede shall be venged full wele, Yff god will gyff me querte!

Off thes spere fayne was hee And dyd hym well, Ã¾er her selff my?te see, How many to grounde he brought. That saw a knyght, Cananeus, Steward off the kynges howse, Oute off a syde he soughtte. 327 A nobull man off werre he was, But a condycion he hase, That mevis all my mode: Was non that tyme so worthy wetyn, Than he covthe haue wyth hym fletyn, Hadde he ben neuer so good. Some men sayd, as haue I sell, That he louyd the quene well, But in no stede hit stoode; A seker stede he rydethe vppon, That mekyll hathe covetyd Ipomadon, And to hym sone he rode. 328 He stroke Canoneus soo, Tope ouer tayle he garte hym goo, That bargyn myght he banne; The stede by the brydull caught, All men saw, he stale hym nought, But worthely he hym wanne. He lede hym syne to Egyon, To the forest wyth hym is he gone, O the feter full well he can. Kyng Melengere all Ã¾is behyld, Worthely he gan his wepons wyld, On Lyard lepythe he Ã¾anne. 329 The kyng waxe nye wood for tene, That he smot downe his kny?ttes kene, And to hym rydis on werre; Emyddis the shyld he stroke hym so, That Ã¾orow the soket he gert goo, And braste his oÃ¾ur gere; Vnder-nethe the lyght pappe The dent yede, be cause it was happe, &amp; dyd but littill dere; Ipomadon wex red for tene, He stroke the kyng ageyne, I wene, That downe he gan hym bere. 330 His shild myght no lenger laste, The naylis off his haubreke braste, That worthely was wrou?te; Be his nakyd syde Ã¾e soket glad, A littill tynde, hurte hym it had, But the wors was he nought Ipomadon Lyard ledis a waye And to his squyere hym brought, And in to Ã¾e forest he hym ledde; Melengere was stretlye stede, But sade men to hym soughte 331 And socurryd hym, wyth oute wene, Els had Ã¾e kyng takyne bene; In hertte is not to hyde. The vttereste syde was full fayne, They sawe the kyng lye on Ã¾e playn, And lowde Ã¾erfore they cryde. Wyth the banner prekys in to Ã¾e place The noble erle, syr Deras, His folke to hym relyd. Ipomadon full wele hym bare, His strokes were full sad &amp; sore, Durste non that day hym byde. 332 So longe laste the turnament, The nyghte ys comyn, the day is went, The sonne drawethe downe. The inner syde wyth grett honoure Was drevyne to dyscomfettoure, They toke Ã¾er pavelyons. Bothe lord &amp; lady brightte Seyd, for sothe, the redde knyght Moste was off renowne. The seconde day this is comen to ende, And as Ipomadon to the wood shuld wende, So metis he wyth Jasone. 333 âJasone broÃ¾ur, lo here thy launce! There on is yet the conysaunce, As thou thy selff may see. Grette that lady, as god me save, And saye, wyth me I will it haue In to myn owne contre!

In the pres Jasone loste hym has, Wyth sorofull hertt home he gaas, Where that the lady laye. 336 âJasone,â quod that lady clere, âTell me, what ails thy chere? âMadame, wepe I moste, For to day haue I loste The best knyght, Ã¾at euer was wroght!â âWhiche, cosyn?

His mayster had huntyd of the best: That day in the thyke foreste Thre grette herttes had he slayn. Off he kest his armore shene, And as a hunter all in grene He rays hym selff agayne. Home he rydes wyth lowde blowyng, Than low?e &amp; seyd both old &amp; ying: âNow comythe the drewlerayne 339 Wyth nobull stedes many one And ryall knyghttes, Ã¾at he hath tane In the turnamente: He may have gevyn amonge Ã¾e okes Knyghttys so mony grette strokes, That nygh hym selff is shent!â Egyon by other weyes Wyth his hors &amp; his harneys Ys to the citte wente, And that noble stede also, That he wanne Gananeus fro, Wyth hym has he sente, 340 And also Lyard of the kynge; Wyth outen any parseuynge He broughte Ã¾em to Ã¾at citte.

He made his present to the kynge And told hym all, wyth oute lesynge, The tale, as he hym bade, How that Bloncan and Nobilet Hathe renne right &amp; goon well bett, And how the price Rydall hade, 351 And how the rede kny?t shuld haue sparde, To haue lede away Lyard, And he had wyth hym been. There att all men low? there fille, But Cabanus lykyd full ille, His hertte brest nere for tene. When the soper tyme was done, Ipomadon after sone To chambyr ledde Ã¾e quene And kyste her wyth mowthe still, Full well he wyst Ã¾e quenes will, To reste she went, I wene. 352 His leve toke Ipomadon, To his inne is he goone; Before the day he rase; Wyth oute more tareynge His blake stede he dyd forth brynge And his blake harnas; Sone was copled all his houndes, As he Ã¾orowe Ã¾e citte foundes, An hedeowes noyce he mase; Hit was non, Ã¾at slept so faste, That they ne wakyd at the laste And sayd: âNow the quene leman gase!â 353 When he come, Ã¾er the quene laye, He blowythe as lowde, as euer he maye, Thereffore was ladyes wrathe; They cursude &amp; bannyde hym euery chone, Seyd: âReste for hym we may haue none, His blewyng is so brathe!â To the ermytage gan he fare, In blake he made hym redy thare And his steede bathe; Then Ipomadon gan saye: âFor goddis love, mayster, I you praye, On huntyng high you rathe!â 354 His mayster dothe, as he hathe hym byden, Ipomadon ys way ys reden, His stede &amp; he in blake. The same tyme in Gresse-londe A duke ther wonnyde, I vnderstonde, That grett maystryes covde make; His name was syr Aryus, A bolde man and a bountevous, Off dedys nothyng to lake. A dyuynere wyth hym had hee, That be the sterres gret plente Cowde grette insamble take. 355 Hys name was syr Anferas, He told hym mekyll, Ã¾at he asse, Off devynyte, that cowd he. The same nyghte, at Ã¾e turnament Was sett be the comen assente, He went, the sterres to see, And be the planettes well hath he founde, That Ã¾er shuld grette worshipe be wonne Off knyght of that asemble; But off the best he was onwyse, Off hym, Ã¾at bare awey the pryce, His termes wrong toke he. 356 He dyd his lord to vnderstonde, What he be the sterres fonde. He made hym redy faste, Two hundyrd knyghttes off grette araye Sayles on the flode so graye: To semble was his caste. The thryd day he ryse yare; Whedyr syde wars ware, A bachelere he aste. All men told hym at Ã¾at tyde, They on the inner syde Was dyscomfett laste. 357 He Ã¾y?tte his pavelyon, Ã¾at stou?te, To helpe them, Ã¾at were in dou?te, Wyth all the myghte, he maye. The riche duke sware, iwis, That, yff he my?te, it shuld be his, The fyrste juste Ã¾at daye. Ipomadon wyste well all to geder, The riche duke, was comyne thedyr On a ryche araye, That on Ã¾e inner syde wold he bee, Thereffore wyth outen bydythe hee: That boughte he sothen, I saye. 358 Ipomadon hovyd before the towne, The wayte hym sawe, Ã¾at lokyd abowne, And he callyd on the fere, He sayd: âAwake, lady bryghte, Younder hoves a blake knyghte In armys good &amp; clere!â âWayte,â she sayd, âfor Crystys dede, Sees thou au?te the knyght in rede, That yester day justyd here?â âNay, madame, but no lake Younder hoves a knyght in blake Wyth a noble chere!â 359 The way to the walles she toke, After the rede knyght gan she loke And sawe hym on no syde; In sonyng fell she downe agayne, To chambur leydes hur Imayne And her comforttes Ã¾at tyde. The duke off Gresse wyth grette boste Comaundythe swythe to all his oste, That none shuld to hym ryde, But yff they se abowte hym mo Knyghttes, Ã¾en oÃ¾er one or two, That bolddly durste abyde. 360 He rydes vp on a red stede Toward the blake knyght, In rede sadull, sheld &amp; spere, And red was all his oÃ¾ur gere, Hit shone as beymes bryghte. On the lady cryes Imayne: âMadame, as I be kept frome payne, Here may ye se wyth syght, Your avncyante knyght, arayde in rede, Agayne the blake nyed in that stede And forses hym to fyghte!â 361 So joyfull was she neuer ere, She wend, the knyght in rede were, Hee had hur leman beene. In the mornynge, erly, as she myghte, Jasone she dubbyd knyght In armore good and clene; She gyrdythe hym wyth a swerd above And XXX?? other for his love, That herdy were &amp; kene. A younge squyere gan she byde: âSerue oure of speris, as Jasone dyd The tother to dayes bedene!â 362 For well wend Ã¾at lady bright, The redde had byn her own kny?te, When she saw hym there. To gedder are these knyghttes gone, The duke strake Ipomadon Wyth a stallworthe spere, That his shild flo fram his halse, Nerehande had he falen alse; Be worthynes off werre Ipomadon fayled nought, He sawe here Ã¾er, that he on Ã¾oughte, The duke downe gan he bere. 363 Egyon wyst, what shuld be done, On Adyrus stede he lepus sone, The lady hovis &amp; beheld; In sonynge fell Ã¾at lady clere, She wend, Ã¾at it hur leman were, That so was fallon in feld. Thee duke full dulfully was dy?te, That vp to ryse he had no my?te, His swerd he gan hym yelde. He proferd hym to his raunsome Castelles riche &amp; many a towne And mekyll gold to welde. 364 âNay, syr,â quod Ipomadon, âOff thy castelles kepe I none, Be god &amp; myn lewte, But on thy trewght here shall Ã¾ou swere, To day Ã¾ou shalt no armys were, Wyth y?en that men may see!â He cryed: âGentill syr, mercy! To this turnament comyn am I Oute off ferre contre: Grettly there on haue I coste, And yff I thus my travell loste, It were grette shame to me!â 365 âSyr, synne thou wylt juste nede, Thou shalte caste off thy rede wede, And sythen goo, do thye beste!â Trewly his trewght Ã¾er to he ply?te; To his tente youde the knyghte And off that armore keste. Ipomadon saw oute of the castell A chyld come, he knew full well, A littell Ã¾er be weste; But he knewe not Ipomadon, A noble spere he brou?te hym one, To take hit, he was full preste. 366 He sayd: âSyr, take thus rede stede And to thy lady thou hym lede, For no man that Ã¾ou spare! The why?te knyght, Ã¾ou may her say, Ne the rede had not goon awey, Hadde I come anny are; And I trowe to day to be sene, Her leffe is strekyne down, I wene, For all his freshe fare; In her presonne shall he not be, Ne, sertus, she shall hym not see To day juste no mare! 367 Swythe shall he wend in to Ã¾e weste The man, I trowe, Ã¾at she louythe beste, And also Ã¾ou her saye! Yff he beffore the gre haue wonne, Here he hathe his felow founde, Yche myghte se, where he laye.

But what is me of all Ã¾o? Righte nought, synne I my love forgoo, Be grette god, that me made!â 369 So faste she grett &amp; gaff her ille, That ner she is in poynte to spille, And to hur sellff gan saye: âLoste thus and my leman be, Shall Ã¾er neuer man haue of me, As farreforthe as I maye!â The stoure wyth outen waxed stronge, Ipomadon in to the thekyste thronge And dyd full welle that day Men on horsse faste they wynne, And many, an lond they laye. 370 They wyth oute gadyrd myghte, Faste forses they to fyghte Bothe wyth spere &amp; shilde; So harde ychane on oÃ¾er layde, Stedes stode stakerand stoneyde, There maysturs fellt in feld. Dreas lokyd hym aboute And blewe &amp; creyd after his rowte, The banere vp he helde. Ipomadon Ã¾ere sone cryed, III C. knyghttes to hym relyd, That cowde Ã¾er wepons welde. 371 Sone come the kyng off Skottelonde, His swerd bolddly in his hande, And strykes Ipomadon, That nere hand to Ã¾e grounde he yoode; He Ã¾ought to yeld hym as good; The kynge he lyghtt vpon, His body evyn in to he cleue, The noble swerd, or it wold leeffe, Ys Ã¾orow the sadull goone. His stede &amp; hym bothe hath he slayne Wyth that stroke mekyll off mayne; Men wonderd euery one! 372 Now off Jasone shall ye here: The blake knyght he holdythe nere In armore burneshede bright; That lyked Ipomadon full well, And sayd: âSyr, so haue I sell, Younder comythe a knyght; Dought hym not, Ã¾ow? he be grym, Goo ryde &amp; juste wyth hym, Littill thou artte not off myghte!â âGramercy, syr, so haue I roo, As ye me bydde, so shall I doo, Be he neuer so wyghte!â 373 Jasone wold no lengur byde, To the knyght can he ryde, He knewe his conusaunce; He strake hym so in myde Ã¾e shyld, That flate he feld hym in Ã¾e feld, To shevers went the lavnce. Be the brydull he toke Ã¾e stede, But Ã¾e knyght coueryd &amp; away yede; Ipomadon lykyd that chaunce; He sayd: âBe god and my lewte, A bettur knyght of his tyme, Ã¾en he, Ys not froo hens to Fraunce! 374 Now shall ye se a wonder cas Off the noble erle, syr Dreas, He had a brother dere Wyth the kynge of Irelonde; New dubbyd, I vnderstond, The tother day bothe they were; For he was stalworthe vnder stel, The stought kynge louyd hym wele And gaff hym armys clere 375 Dreas was wyth outen Ã¾at day, And he wyth in, the sothe to saye, Many to grounde he broughte. That saw Dreas, securly, Off his dedis hadde grette envye, Oute of that syde he sought. Dryas rydes vnto his broÃ¾er, NoÃ¾er knowlegge had of oÃ¾ere, To juste they bothe had Ã¾oughte. Cavdor smote his broÃ¾er Dreas Thorow shild of gold &amp; his harnas; Yet, sertis, he hurte hym nought. 376 Dreas stroke his broÃ¾er Cavdor Wyth a spere sadde &amp; sore Thorow oute all his armore In at his brest, oute at his bake, The chyne-bone asonder brake Dede off his brothers hande, And that was grett doloure; He gaff hym suche a spetuous falle, In sunder brast the lachettes all, That shuld his helme socoure. 377 His basnette flew off Ã¾are; When Dreas sawe his visage bare, Wonder-woo he was; When he sawe his broÃ¾eres face, In sonynge fell Dreas Syghand, and sayd: âAlas, Dere broÃ¾er, woo ys mee, That euer I thy bane shuld bee, Mercy I the asse!â He lokyd vpe &amp; lokyd hye, His eyne closude, &amp; gan to dye, His soule away gan passe. 378 Then hadde Dreas mekill care, He rent his clothes &amp; drewe his hare, And oute a swerd drawethe he; The hylte downeward, Ã¾e poynte vp stode, He swere by god, that is good: âMyne noune bane shall I bee!â To hym prekkythe Ipomadon, His swerd oute of his hond hathe tone And sayd: âBenedycyte!â âAlas, syr, for sorowe &amp; payne: It is my broÃ¾er, that haue I slayne, Therefore full woo ys mee!â 379 âYe, syr, lette this greffe ouergoo, For better is oo man dede, Ã¾en tow, This is Ã¾e sothe, I saye! Ye, so there is no more to kepe, Agayne vp on your stede ye lepe And for his soule do praye!â Dreas dyd, as he hym bade, The body to an churche Ã¾ey hade, In beryall they hym laye, Yff they hadde neuer so mekyll care; Thus Dreas leves his broÃ¾ur thare And wendythe forthe on his waye. 380 The stowre lettyd no Ã¾ing for Ã¾is, But many a worthy man, iwis, Was boldely borne downe. Yche of them sheverd oÃ¾eres shyld And feld many a knyghte in feld, That were of grette renoune. On noÃ¾er syde was not to lake, But euer more the knyght in blake To the beste is bowne. So worthely wroght Ipomadon, That the vtter syde ilkone Yaffe hym thare benysowne. 381 One, Segamvs, made a fraye And grette boste all Ã¾at daye, A noble spere he bare, A knyght of the kynges mene, He louyd the quene in fayth, parde, As I haue harde seyde yare; Till Ipomadon he chese, And he to hym, wyth outen leesse, Two nobull knyghttes Ã¾ey ware; Eyther on oÃ¾ur Ã¾er speres brake, Bvt still on ther hors bake They bothe heyld them thare. 382 Sygamus hys swerd hathe tone And stornely strykes Ipomadon Vppon the stelyne hatte; Ipomadon his swerd hathe drayn And strake Segamus agayne, That to Ã¾e ground fell he flatte; His swerd he yeldes to hym Ã¾ere, Vp on his trought he made hym swere, He shuld not leve for that, That he ne shuld ryde home to Ã¾e quene And yeld hym to that lady shene, In chambur where she satte: 383 âAnd say, a knyght in armys blake Has for that ladyes sake Forgevyne the thy ravnsom!â He rydys home to Ã¾at lady hende And told hur his tale to ende, When he was come home; Then low?e the quene in preuyte And sayd: âLord, what man was hee, That durste beyre you downe?â âA blake knyght, madame, Ã¾at I not know, But well I wott, down he me slow And sent me to your presone!â 384 Hit was neuer, syn god Ã¾is world began, A fayrer turnament, Ã¾en Ã¾at was one, Off men, that worthy ware. The fere all way had in sighte The dedis off the blake knyghte, How boldly he hym bare; So doughtly he dang them abowte, That all men off his dentes had dowte, So warre they bothe sadde &amp; sore. Hit drewe to the nyght faste: The inner syde att the laste Was ouercome thare. 385 On the chasse folowed Ipomadon, Cabanus turrned &amp; lokyd hym on, Toward hym rydythe hee; Was neuer knyghte, sithe Ã¾us world began, Better belouyd, thanne he was Ã¾anne Amonge the comynalte. Ipomadon west full well, Cabanus was stallworthe vnder stele, And lothe he was to flee, And lothe he was his love forgoo And his travell also Off this dayes thre. 386 In feuter ayther castes a spere, Sethen to gedder ryddes there Wyth all the myghte, they maye; There sheldes all in sounder brake, They bothe, noÃ¾er were to lake, Behynde Ã¾er horsse they laye. Cabanus sett his strokes so faste, Ipomadons sheld asunder breste, The serten sothe to seye. Vndernethe the lyfte pappe Thorowe all his hernes, Ã¾is was his hape, The sokett glasyd away. 387 Nere hand brest his hertte for tene, He wend, he shuld a knowen ben, Or he hadde paste that playne; The blake stede toke Egyon And broughte hym to Ipomadon And horsud hym efte agayne, And sethyne to Cabanus stede he wan, In to the foreste he ledes hym thane, And off that freyght was fayne. Then waxed Cabanus nere hand wood, &amp; he sterte vp wyth egur mode, As he wold hym aslayne. 388 He sowre: âBe god &amp; my lewte, This dede shall well avenged be, Yff god will gyff me querte!â Ipomadon will stryke hym no more, But wyth his hors brest down hym bare, And sore forthought it in hertte, Soo godde a knyght wold hym not yeld; Kynge Mellengere all Ã¾is beheld And on a stede he stertte. He prekes to Ipomadon, A spytuos stroke he gaff hym one, That right sore dyd smerte, 389 On the righte arme in Ã¾e braune, I wene; Full faste the blod ranne down bedene, That many a man myghte it see; He says; âThus shall be vengyd well!â And oute he takes a bronnde of stele And lyfte hit vp on he; There to the kyng good hede toke; When he sawe hym so gremly loke, Righte sore aferd was hee; I darre not sey, the kyng fled Ã¾at tyde, But for his dent he durst not byde, Be god and be my lewte! 390 The inner syde was sore agasste, The kyng awayward heed hym faste, To fle they toke that tyde, Some to towne and sum to tente. Thus endyd the turnamente: In faythe, it is not to hyde. The blake knyght was off dedes beste And boldyste durste abyde. Be that hit drew to Ã¾e ny?te, To wodward hyed that blake knyght, As faste as he my?te ryde. 391 By syde hym lokyd Ipomadon, Soon was he warre of Jasone, On hym lowde gan he crye: âAbyde, Jasone, &amp; speke wyth me!â The other sayd: âHow may Ã¾is be, So grette mervell haue I, That ye so well woste, what I hight?â âYes, Jasone, be goddes myghte, I haue a grette cause, whye! Felows, I wot well, onys we were, Att a supper, thou wotte well, where, When I was sett the by! 392 Thus thre days I haue juste here, And euery day, broÃ¾er dere, In dyueres colours sene.

Grette well thy lady bright of ble A gyfte I shall hur gyff, Euer more, while I leeff, Too wytte wyth outen wene! 393 Thus maye thou, Ã¾at wyth me spake, When I was whyte, rede &amp; blake; For nedes mvste I wende.

I shall here after, when god will, Att leyser speke wyth her my fille, So saye to that lady hende!â He cryede lowde: âMercy, ser, Trewly, goo ye thus fro here, My lady her selff shall shend: 394 For you she suffyrs mekyll care!â âNaye, Jasone, lett be thy fare, Me mvste in to my londe! Fare well, till eftsones Ã¾at we mete, And as oftyne tymes Ã¾ou her grette, As gresses Ã¾er be groande!â In to the thykyste prese he paste And Jasone loste hym att the laste, In no syde he hym fonde. Wyth sorofull hertte &amp; grette mornyng Wepand he gothe home to Ã¾at lady yinge, Sorowfull, &amp; wrange his hande. 395 âJasone,â quod that lady thanne, âWhy makyste Ã¾ou suche mornynge, man, Who may haue grevyd thee?â âAlas, madame, that I was borne, For to day haue we lorne, The beste knyghte, that maye be!â âWhy, cosyn, the knyght in blake?â âHe makyth me all Ã¾is mornynge make!â âWhy wyste thou, what he be, He, that will brynge me to my dede?â âThe same, that juste in whyte &amp; rede, To day in blake was hee!â 396 Then had she thrys so mekyll care, She tare hyr clothes &amp; drewe hure hare Wyth many a carefull crye: âThow dethe, thou come to me to day And helpe, be lyve, that I were slaye, I praye the specyallye!

He lefte me Ã¾are, the sothe to saye, On lond, when he ledde hym away, On fotte, full verely!â 445 The burgays this euery deall Hathe done his message wonder-well Before all, that there ware: âLordynges, yet is here a stede, That gaff me to my mede That fre, when he shuld fare, Wyth that, Ã¾at I shuld do his message Before all Ã¾is boronage And laydes wyse of lare!â The burgays toke his leve &amp; yede, All men marveld of his dede, Lordes bothe lesse &amp; mare. 446 The kyng in a stody he satte, The quene tremeld after Ã¾at And to hyr selff she told: âI had leyser inovgh to saye, But they, that woll not, when Ã¾ey maye, They shall not, when Ã¾ey wolde!â She sayd: âLordynges lesse &amp; more, Ye wytte well inow?e, wherefore This turnament was holde; To you I haue forward feste, What man in erthe bare hym beste, My londes brode shuld wold. 447 Now here you, who moste worthely hathe wrought, But where is he, yet wott ye novghte, Thow?e he his happe hath hadde: Fynde you hym, yff that ye may, And I shall swere you, be my faye, There ys no lenger bade, That I shall take hym wyth good will!â Euery man thought, she sayd but skille, And forthought, Ã¾at Ã¾ey sayd had, That he was so his gates goone, They sayd: âSo worthy a knyght was non In all this world so brade!â 448 There was no man, for her sake Wold covnsaylle hyr, oÃ¾ur lord to take, But bad, that she shuld byde Tille tyme, that he myght fovnden be; Thus partyd that grett semble And euery man gan home ryde. The lady in Candres boode, The kyng to the castell rode And the quene went by his syde, Wyth sorofull hertte makyng her moone, That he was so his gates goone, Hyr herte nere braste that tyde. 449 To chambyr she went sore sighande, And when she come, Ã¾er she fonde A way the maydon clene, That Ipomadon hade theder broughte; In a stody she stode &amp; thoughte, What waye beste myghte been, That he to her were brought agayne; Might no Ã¾ing make her so fayne, 450 Thus dare I savely saye, As women, what Ã¾ey will haue wrought, To do ther lykyng, lett they noughte, Come after, what sum maye: âThe knyght, that all these dedys dydde, Ill his curtasy here has kyde, My mayde he hath lede away, 451 Whiles I was at Ã¾e grette semble, And but I Ã¾eron vengyd bee, Hard is my behove; I maye in romaunce &amp; in ryme Ellys say in sorye tyme, That I haue lorn my love On many worthy bachelere, That wonnand is wyth Mellengere, Yff I take this reprove!

The maydon hard at the laste Horsse come rennand wyth bryduls faste, But no man covthe she see; The damysell full witty was, A littill she tovchis his face, And Ã¾er wyth wakyd hee. 455 Vp he lepe full lyuerlye, Armyde well and all redy, On his helme he hente; Wyth that he sawe Ã¾e high steward In the way come prekand harde Wyth grette ire ouer the bent; And when he saw hym hy so faste, He thoughte, hit was the quenes caste, That he was thedyr sent. When he saw hym come precande soo, He wyste full wele, Ã¾at her was woo, That he was so awey went. 456 The steward to hym rydes Ã¾anne, To speke spettuesly he began And lenys hym on his shafte: âWhy haste thou done, belamye, The quene so grette velonye, Her maydone when Ã¾ou her rafte? Syr, I say the by my thryfte, My lady will the peche off thefte, Thy nvrture Ã¾er thou lefte; Goo, lede agayne that maydon gent, Or thou shalt suffur jugmente, That fallys for thevys crafte! 457 Ye bothe forgatte your curtasye, To stele away so prevelye Agayne my ladyes wille, And noÃ¾er off you toke no leve: Ye myghte well witte, it wold her greve Ouer-grettly be that skille, And also, syr, my selff hath knowen, Thou toke wyth the more, Ã¾an thyne owen, Or euer hadeste resone tille: Thow ledys a stede, that is not thyne, Thou shalt abyde &amp; leve me myne, Lyke thow neuer so ille! 458 Thy dedis shall Ã¾ou by full dere, But neuer the lesse, yf Ã¾ou wilt here, Become my lege man And sweftely on my swerd swere, Neuer me nor non of myn to dere, Yet wyll I save the thanne!

The steward was a noble man, Off dedes off armus right well he cane, And he had full secur gere. Ipomadon was not to lake; These too knyghttes, on Ã¾e stedes bake To geddur they rydde on were. The justes betwene them was full fayre, Cananeus wyth a grett eyre A shafte to hym gan bere. 463 He hit hym so the myddes the sheld, A quarter fle in to the feld, Thow it were neuer so good. So stravnglye stroke he at Ã¾at tyde, Thorowe all his harnes be the syde Evyn the spere in yode Vndernethe the lyfte pappe; But, as god gaff hym happe, The spere, it drew no blode. Ipomadon was wrothe wyth Ã¾at, Stone-stille in his sadull satte And was Ã¾er wythe nere woode. 464 He strake the steward so sore agayne, The vasell fley in to the playne, He gaff hym suche a batte; So sternly he gan hym stryke, That nose &amp; cheke was bothe lyke, So had he made hit flate. Were his gorgede neuer so good, The swerde thorowe the hawbreke yode, In sadull where he satte. He brake his right shulder bone, That to the grounde is he goone Tope ouer tayle wyth that. 465 The stuard lyethe on the grounde, Grevously lay gronande in Ã¾at stounde And hathe full mekyll care; His shulder bone was brokyne so, That dyd hym twys so mekyll woo, That he myght juste no mare. âSyr,â quod Ipomadon, âSyr, ye myght a lette me goone And byn in peas langare. He that moste ys manasand, Hym selff hathe cause, I vnderstond, Febly yf he fare! 466 Now shall thou ryde home to Ã¾e quene And yeld the to the lady shene: I wott, thou arte her dere; But, as god of heyven me spede, Thus mayden wyth the shall Ã¾ou not lede, Ne no?te ellys, that ys here. A stede I hadde of thy broÃ¾er, In fayth, now will I haue anoÃ¾ur, To kepe hem all this yere. But say, I lede no more off thyne!â âNay, syr, be the trovthe off myne, Dede I, wrong it were! 467 I wyght the nought, yf it be Ã¾us, Thus vnhape nedes haue me bus, Thereffore wo worthe destonye!â âSyr, thou shalt haue a littill hackeney, That shall the beyr be the way Twesse so essely.

I myghte haue byn in peas langore, Now laydes love grevythe me sore, So dothe it hym, Ã¾at on hem layes; My longe travayle is now in veyne, They love, and but they be louyd ageyne 469 I haue boughte her loue to dere, Me rewis the tyme, Ã¾at I come here, So mot I borowed bene!â Ipomadon sayd: âSyr, I praye the, A thousand tyme recomaunde me, When thou comyste to the quene, And all, that I haue done wyth ille, It shall be amendid at hur will, Thou say so to Ã¾at lady shene!â In his sadull they hym sett, Whome he rode, wyth outen lette, There fewe men wold hym meene. 470 The quene was euer more lokyng oute, But in hur herte euer had she dowte, He shuld not come agayne. So was she warre at the laste, Where the steward come rydyng faste Alone on the playne. His arme hyng waginge be his syde, The blod ranne down fro his wondes wyde, As hit was droppus off rayne. âWhat, how now, syr?â quod the quene, âBe your semblant it is sene, Ye haue mett wyth drewlerayne!â 471 He sayd: âCertes, ye, madame! Mee had ben bytter, byne at hame, That make I god avowe: In a sory tyme for my behove Youde I, to juste for my ladyes love, Euer more that will me rowe! Fro me he ledus younder mayden bright: So wold he do for any knyght, That dwelland is wyth you, So worthy a man, as he is one: Brokyne he hathe my shulder bone, Full sore that greuythe me nowe!â 472 Grette worship spake he off hym pare, So dyd he neuer off no man are, Syne he was borne to man; To his chambyre sithen he went, The quene in herte her sore repent And wordes she began to banne, Synne he was at her owne will, That she ne had shewed hym Ã¾anne here will, How will she louyd hym Ã¾anne; Mornyng in hur hertte she bode. Ipomadon his way forthe rode Wyth the worship, he wanne. 473 Home to Poylle he Ã¾ynkes to ryde, His cosyn ledynge be his syde, Wyth outen anny tareynge; On a day, it is not to lett, Fowre barons off his land he mett, Yche was a grett lordyng, That many a day had hym sought And straunge tydynges to hym brought, That lykyd hys hertte right no thinge; A tale to hym they beganne, That dede was his fadur Ã¾anne, Ermogynes, thee kyng. 474 When they saw Ipomadon, The barons were glad euery chone And wyth hym turnes ageyne. When he was comyn in to his londe, Men send hym many a fayre presand, And of hym they were full fayne; Att Barlett, that riche citte, Men brought hym omage &amp; fewte, The sothe is not to layne, Right as they shuld do to Ã¾er lord; He and his barons were sone acorde, Knyght, squyere and swayne. 475 Ipomadon thynkes, it is no witte, In worshipe is not he growon yit, Be aught, that he couthe see; Farther Ã¾inkes he for to goo, Aventurs for to seke moo In many dyueres contre. He Ã¾ought, Ã¾at tyme shuld come above, That he wyth worshipe shuld wyne love, When it myght better bee. Att home he wold no lengur abyde; For to kepe his londes wyde, A warden ordeyns hee. 476 In Fraunce, hard he say, was werre, Ipomadon dyd make redy his gere, Thedur for to wende. His mayster toke he wyth hym thanne: Was neuer knyght, sithe Ã¾is world beganne, A more faythefull frend. He badde his cosyne Egyone, In to Callabre that he shuld goone, To herkyne after that hende: âIn to Fraunce will I fare, Thus twelffemonythe shalt Ã¾ou fynd me Ã¾are, Yff any man will her shend!â 477 Egyon wyndes to Callaber, Prevely after the fere to spere, Ipomadon in to Fraunce, Wythe hors &amp; hernes grette plente, And wyth hym went kny?ttes three, He toke no more retenaunce, Neyther lyke kyng ne emperoure, But he rydythe lyke a sodyoure Wyth armore, shyld and lavnce. Where any dede off armys were, The gre he wynnes euery where; Betyde hym many a chaunce. 478 Att home he wold no lengur abyde. In Fraunce dwellyd a kyng that tyde, That callyd was Catryus; A younger broÃ¾er hadde he thenne, That lord was off Lorene, The storye wettnes thus; That tyme men callyd hym kyng Dayre, Off Loreayne he had weddyd the ayre, The doughttur off Dryseus. Att hym his broÃ¾er hadde envye, Grette werre betwene them was, trewlye, Defende hym nedes hym bvs. 479 She is dede, that was his wyff; Thereffore stabuld they not Ã¾ere stryffe, But gadurd grette powere. This Dayere was a noble man And well his landes he gouerend Ã¾anne, Bothe farre and nere; His broÃ¾ur wrought hym mekyll woo, And grette parte off his landes also Wyth warre he wanne Ã¾at yere, And off his castels II or thre He stuffud &amp; held it wyth grett plente Off men, that worthy were. 480 The kyng off Fraunce, in Paris he laye, Ipomadon that hard saye And thedur gan he ryde; He made his dwellyng wyth Ã¾e kyng, Gladder was he neuer of Ã¾inge In all thys world so wyde. Wyth grette honoure there was hee, The kyng beholdes his knyghttis thre And all his folke that tyde; Many off them he hadde sene before, But he knewe them neuer Ã¾e more; The glader he was to byde. 481 The kyng sent after his barons bold And bad them, counsell to hold, To loke, how beste myghte bee For his brothere, Ã¾at on hym werred, And all hys londys grettly dered Wyth knyghttes off grette bovnte; And as they at the covnsell standes, To Catryus came new tydandes, That chaungyd all his ble: His brother wyth XXX?? thousand knyghttes, Welle armyd att all righttis, Were come before the ryche citte. 482 The kyng had many a noble man, But not halff so many, as he had Ã¾anne, Therefore he was in dovte. Euery man made hym redy faste, Sethyne oute of the citte Ã¾ey paste, A full ryall rowte. Ipomadon was full glad &amp; blythe, Hym self dyd hym aray swythe Vppon a stede full stovte; He was the fyrste, that toke feld, Clenly couered vnder shyld, And bolde men hym abowte. 483 A nobull knyght, wyth owten les, To Ipomadon he hym chesse, That was on Dayres syde; Wythe a spere he to hym sought, The sheld was good &amp; faylyd novght, There in the soket plyde. Ipomadon strake to hym so faste, The spere thorowe the sheld paste Wyth a stroke, was vnryde; The hawberke vnder was good &amp; sovnde, He bare hym streyte to the grovnde Wyth manly herte that tyde. 484 Or any socur to hym ys comyn, Ipomadon had his suravns nomyn, Thow he grette rewthe hade; Wyth owten reskew off any man The knyght to hym yeldis hym thanne, Where of he was full glade; Ipomadon saythe to hym fayre, Sethen he sent hym to kyng Dayre: âGoo tell thy lord,â he bade, âThe blake knyght now he maye se here, That justyd in Calabyre for the fere, That made hym onys vnglad!â 485 The kyng off Fraunce &amp; all his men Trewly was awonderd Ã¾enne, When they had sene that sight; He sent his presonere to his enmye, Off tresone dred they them than for thy, Them thowght, he ded not righte: There was neuer knyghte, sithe Ã¾is world began, That better wrought, then he dyd than, He forsyd hym so to fyghte. The kyng off Fraunce, in armys clere Ipomadon he heldythe hym nere, He saw, he was so wyghte. 486 The kyng Dayre had mekill care, When he wyste the blake knyghte Ã¾are, Wyth sorow in hertte his he wovnde, For wele he thought, &amp; it not for hym be, He shuld off Fraunce have grette plente That day wyth sworde haue wonne. Wonder-stronge was Ã¾at store, There dyed many a man sore Be rysynge of the sonne, And gevyn was many a stroke vnryde: What knyght off Dayres durste abyde, He hathe his felowe founde. 487 Dayres was a noble man off werre, He dyght hym lyghttly in his gere And in to the pres gan pryke, And wyth hym many a well good knyght, The frenshe folke, wyth mekyll myghte In thwerte wyles they were wyke. Ipomadon so worthely wroughte, That bothe sydys grett wondur Ã¾ought, So styff men gan he stryke; Where he went on any syde, Was none, that durst his dent abyde, So was he wonder-wyke. 488 There was non, that peryd to Ipomadon, Inwerre he was so wyce a mon, Todo hit euery deell; His mayster had lornyd hym well Ã¾at were, Bothe to ryde wyth shyld &amp; spere And to weld a swerde off stele. So many off Dayres men he slowe, That the kyng wepte &amp; had sorow inowe Wyth sykyng and vnsele; He layde on faste on euery syde, All his folke had fled that tyde, But that he dyd so welle. 489 The kyng Dayre had Ã¾ere be syde A castell stovffed in Fraunce Ã¾at tyde, And thedur he can hym drawe; Two hundyrd knyghttes there fovnde oute, Ipomadon met so wyth that rowte, That many he layd full lawe. This nobull knyght, as he well covthe, An olywhantes horne he sett to mowthe And lowde began to blawe; The knyghttes, that were strowyd wyde, To hym drawes on euery syde Redy and on a rawe. 490 Barons vnder stedys fett Lay hevely gronynge on the grete, And many there lyvys had lorne, Ryche hawberkes all torente, Barnys bledand on the bente, There shuldurs on sovnder shorne; They presud to gedyr so grette repayre, That at the laste kyng Dayre Vnto the erthe was borne; His stede agayne was to hym fette; Tho he was in the sadull sette, Wyght men hathe hym worne. 491 Ipomadon wroughte full worthely, There at Dayre had grett envye And lyghttly to hym wanne; He stroke hym so the myddyst Ã¾e backe, That bothe plate &amp; hawbrake brake, By his syde the sokett ranne, But no harme in the fleshe it dyde, God wold not, that it betydde. So strettly he stroke hym Ã¾anne: Ipomadon, to the grounde hym bare, That wors hap betyde hym neuer yare, Sethe he was fyrste a man. 492 That was no thynge long on hym, Vp he sterte wyth hertte grymme And oute his swerd he drowghe, Wyth the tone hand his brydull he toke, And wyth the tother hand, as tellyÃ¾e the boke, He fendyd hym well inovghe. The prese aboute hym come so faste, His horse brake fro hym at the laste And goos vp on a clowgh; The chyld, that shuld hym serue thare, Therefore he had so mekyll care, That nere he fell in swoughe. 493 Ipomadon favghte so faste, The blode thorow the browes braste, Off all the riche raye, Knyghttes full thyke abowte hym wendes, And he grettly them defendes, The sertayne sothe to say; There was non, Ã¾at he hitt, That longe myght in his sadull sitt, He sterryd as bere at baye; He smote so steffly hym abowte, Off his strokys they hadde suche dowete, That many on fled away. 494 Grette sorow his chyld had, That his mayster on foote was stade, Fyghttand wonder-faste; He hyed faste after his hors, And in the feld wyth playne fors He toke hym att the laste; Glader was he neuer of dede, To his mayster he dyd hym lede, A lowde crye vp he caste. Ipomadon drawys to hym warde, He hew on there helmes harde, That the blod thorowe the browes braste. 495 Ipomadon was neuer so fayne, As when his stede was brought agayne, Lyghtly vp he lepe. Fresly fendes hym assayled now, Off his steropus, as I trowe, He toke but littull kepe: Suche strokys Ã¾en he sette, The moste myghtty as he mett, He made there wyffes to wepe. Knyghttes in the feld lay strewed, There neke bonys in sundere hewed Wyth many a wounde full depe. 496 His felowes was sory euery chone, That tyme they wend, Ipomadon, He hadde byn loste them froo; The presse aboute hym was so thyke, There wend noo wyghte, he had byn quyke, Therefore they were full woo. The rowte, to reskewe hym, wolde ryde; So stravnge was that stoure that tyde, They myghte not to hym goo; When they saw hym fyrste agayne, The kyng of Fraunce was full fayne And many othere moo. 497 Mervelys you not for thy, Thow Ipomadon was wery, So harde he gan hym to melle! Was neuer knyght, borne of woman, eere Harder besette, then were thare, That darre I trewly tell. Many a man in feld laye slone, But off them all Ipomadon Off bounte bare the bell. Dayres blew an horne that tyde, His knyghttes relyd on euery syde, That were bothe fers and fell. 498 There at Ipomadon was wrothe, Thow he were wery, there he gothe, He crakes many a crowne; The inner syde euery dell Was comfortyd of hym wonder-well, As bere ay was he boune; He hewe in sunder helme &amp; schelde And feld many worthy knyghttes in feld, That were off grette renowne, Many swonyd and lay in sweme; Kynge Dayre, hym selff that tyme Efte sonys he was borne downe. 499 Knyghttes, to reskew hym, wold thyder ryde, They prekyd many a stede that tyde Spetowsly wyth sporys; Ther is no other Ã¾ing to ax, But he, that moste worthy waxe And moste off bounte beres; Wyth mekyll woo wele they weste, To the kyng they socourde at Ã¾e leste Wyth strokes, that many a man deris. 500 Dayres folke wyth grette doloure Were turnyd to dyscomfetture, Oute of the feld they flede. The kyng of Fraunce folowyd faste And made many a man full gaste, Before that day wer neuer adred. Or they in to the castell wanne, Slayne there was many a noble man, That Dayres thedyr ledde. They speryd the gates, Ã¾at were wyth in, To sege wyth oute they begynne; Thus Dayres men bale they brede. 501 They pyght pavelyons off pryde, To kepe that hold on euery syde, That non shuld essu oute; Ipomadon wyth good chere Sett his tent the kyng nere, Well borderyd all abowte. So worthely wrought he Ã¾at daye, Dayres, that wyth in laye, Off hym hade mekill dowte. Righte wyse he was, wyth outen lesse, To be his mesengeres, he chesse Stille men and not stovte, 502 Off his barons many one, He sent them to Ipomadon, As he, that wold be frende: âAnd specyally ye shall hym praye, He helpe, to brynge, as he, Ã¾at may, This grette debate to ende; And on that comnaunte I will hym gyff Halff my kyngdome, while I leve, My doughtter fayre &amp; hende!â The mesengers were full wyse, They waytyd, where the knyght lyse, And to his tent they wende. 503 They dyd there message welle &amp; fayre, They tolde hym all of the kyng Dayre, That them thedyr sente; They prayed hym, that he wold be frend And sythen to the kyng of Fraunce wend Be rightwys jugemente And helpe, to make a good acorde Betwene the kyng &amp; Ã¾ere lord, That no men were shent: âOn that comnaunte he hight Ã¾e Ã¾e fayre, Here, that he thynkes to make his ayre, His doughtter bothe fayre &amp; gent.â 504 Right wyse was Ipomadon; He sayd to the barons ychone: âHis doughtter were me dere: Syr, to yowre lorde graunt mercy, That he wold shewe me Ã¾at curtessy, Worthy yf that I were; But never the lesse say hym agene, All Fraunce yf he wille quyte clene, Bothe towne &amp; castell in fere, And to the kyng omage make, This message I vndertake Wyth a noble chere. 505 His doughttur gladly have I wold, Grette good of her I haue hard told: That is to me but a trayne!â âNay, syr,â sayd the mesengere, âThat dare we boldely hight you here, As we be sauyd frome payne, On bookys &amp; sawters for to swere, Neuer after to do you dere, Fro that they be frendes agayne!â Ipomadon to the kyng gan wend And told hym all Ã¾at tale to ende; Thereof was he full fayne. 506 The mesengers was full glad Off the answers, that Ã¾ey hadde, They foundyd on the felde; When they come to the castell And to there lord this tale can tell, They sayd: âSyr, this berys you belde Kyng Dayre, on the morne The kyng of Fraunce he come beforne And omage gan hym yelde. 507 Brode bokes were brought oute thanne, To swere the kyng Dayre began Wyth many a barone bolde, That he shuld neuer stere ne stryve; No more he dyd in all his lyve, For the trouthe had he tolde. This acorde is made fayre, Ipomadon shuld wedde his eyre Wyth halff his lond in wolde. Joyefull was that maydon fre, But I trowe, by my lewte, That comnaunde will not holde. 508 Off hym the damysell was glade, For in the towre sene she hadde, How dow?ttly he dydde. He gaff so many a grette strake, She wend, hit had byn for hyr sake, That suche maystres he kyde; There by she thought, he louyd here well: To wedde hyr thought he neuer a dell, For oftyne tymes has bytydde And sayd off long tyme agoone, That on the bushe bettes one, A nothere man hathe the bryde. 509 Then the kyng of Fraunce thankyd hym than Off the grette worshipe, Ã¾at he hym wanne, And sayd: âBe god alonne, Better, than ye dyd yestyrday, Dydde neuer no man, I dare wel say, That was made of blode &amp; bonne!

He waytyd hyr homwardes the way, And he come rydand, sothe to say, Evyn where Imayne lyes; The maydon was wery &amp; slept faste, But wyth a grett noyse at the laste She woke and vp gan ryse. 567 âWell fovnde, mayde Imayne, Vpon your palffrey ye lepe agayne Wyth oute wordes moo, For, trewly, lady, ye are myne, Gyvyn off my lord, syr Lyolyne!â Than was Imayne woo: âSyr, that were grett outerage, Gyff I were mayd of my message: For goddes loue, lette me goo!â âIt nedes not, to make Ã¾is mone: Whether ye lyke or none, In faythe, it shall be soo!â 568 Then as an aspleff she quoke, Vppon the dwarff gan she loke Wyth angur and syghyng syne; Ipomadon sittes and lokes them two: âSyr, what wylte thou wyth Ã¾at maydon doo?

Wyth oute any more abode Thus II knyghttes to geddyr rode Be worthenes of werre. Maugis sett his stroke so faste, The spere Ã¾orow the shyld paste, But vnder it dede no dere; So sternely stroke Ipomadon, In two he stroke his shulder bone, And downe he gan hym bere. 571 Ipomadon lefte not Ã¾at knyght, Tille he hadde trewly his trovthe plyght, Though hym were lothe there too, That he shuld ryde home to Lyolyne: âAnd say, the mayden ys not thyne, In peas for the may she goo, Wyth joye they heldyn forthe Ã¾er jorneye! And also, syr, thou shalt hym saye, As thow haue reste or roo: The fere wyth oute grette battayle Shall not come to his spousayle, For nought, that he can doo! 572 But, syr, so god of hevyn me spede, Behynde the thow shalt leve thy stede, I wyll the say, for why: Wetly wondyd, I trow, thou bee, But thou shall haue, to bere the, Thus lyttill lowe rouncy!â In his sadull they hym sett, He rewes, that euer she wyth hym mette, His arme hynge babelyng bye; Thus hathe he toke his leve and ys gone.

He dyd it be his grette folye And nothyng be his chevalrye, Therefore this wordes lett bee!â Thee hette was well ouercome Ã¾anne, Agayn vpon Ã¾er hors they name And forthe they rode all thre; Att evyn till an inne they came, Ipomadon harboryd at the same, The mayde, all awaye drew she. 576 The dwarffe hym seruyd to fote &amp; hande, Imayne was wrothe, I vnderstonde, But therefore lett he novght. Att morowe they rose &amp; went Ã¾er way, There thorowe a forest Ã¾er way laye, The mayde rode in a thoughte. Att hye pryme they fonde a well, Joyefull was that damysell, Downe fro her hors she sovghte; The dwarffe pyght her pavelyone, Wyne and bakyne venysone Before that berde he brought. 577 Ipomadon lyght a lytell her fro, The dwarffe to his hors gan goo And raynd hym to a boughe And prayd the mayde wyth good will, The knyght she wold calle here till; The wyth she was wrothe inowgh: âI praye god, I bide neuer yole, That I to me shuld calle a foole!â Ipomadon satte and lovgh; He lykyd hur wordes full well, He sayd: âÃat day hathe ben, damysell, We fro youre dalentes drowgh, 578 But I ne wotte, what tyme ne where!â Imayne to the dwarff sayd there: âNow thou may here take hede, How younde foole begynnythe to rave, And yet thou wold, so god me save, Ouer land I shuld hym lede!â As they satte spekyng alther beste, A knyght come rydyng thorowe the foreste, Syttand on a stede. Imayne say and syghed sore And thought on the tother day before, How she hadde byn in drede. 579 That knyght was cosyn to Mawgis, He mekill hathe wonne of losse &amp; prise In Ynde and Palestyne; He was Lyolyne suster sonne; When he had Imayne fovne, He sayd: âDere leman myne, Vppon your palffraye leppe ye, For to reward hathe you gevyn mee My cossyn, syr Lyolyne!â Thereffore had Magis be full wrothe, For he had gyffner to them bothe: As fayre a gyfte they tyne. 580 Toward the foole gan she loke And as an aspenleff she shoke, She was so sore aferde. âSyr,â than quod Ipomadon, âGoo forthe thy wey &amp; lett hure goone, Fro wyghtes I have here werde: Be my faythe, thow getyste here nowght, But yff it be wyth bofetes bovghte, Thow?e thou byght on thy berde!â His eye on his sheld he caste And sayd deyrnely at the laste: âSyt still, thow foole moserd!â 581 âYe, yff I be a foole,â quod hee, âThe sadder shall my strokes bee, Right sone Ã¾at maye ye witte!

The knyghttes name was Greon, A worthyer knyght, then he was one, Nede neuer be sene in feld. That tyme they wold no lengur byde, On werre to geddur gan they ryde, So worthely they them welde. These knyghttes, Ã¾at were conyng of craftes, To shevers wente bothe Ã¾ere shaftes; Imayene satt and behelde. 583 Ipomadon smot hym wyth his spere, Thurghe shylde and all his oÃ¾er gere, A lyttill above the thee; Thereffore was Greon wrothe inovgh, A noble swerd oute he drowgh And att his hedde lette flee; In his hand hit turnyd wyth that And on his hedde hit fell all flatte, Ellys hadde he slayne that fre. Imayene had full mekyll care, When she saw hym smytte so sare, Nere swovned that lady fre. 584 Ipomadon was not thyng payde, That he was so sore stonayd, He drew his swerd that stovnde; Soo wyghttly he weldes hym in his geyre, That off he smythe syr Greon eyre; Wyth that he fell to grounde: âLonge have ye callyd me but a foole, Leve syr, now, how lyke ye my skole? I holde you wyghttly wounde. Ye may be orderde, when ye wille: Syr, have here my trowthe Ã¾er tille, Thow arte shavyne rownde!â 585 He bade the dwarff: âGo take the stede, The maydons harnes there on to leede, Thy somere hors thow hym make!â A chylde wyth hym Greon hade, That in the woode syde hym abade, Ryghte sorye for his sake; He saw his mayster woundyd ille, Another hors he brought hym till, Vp they gan hym take. Alofte wettly wondyd was hee, Ipomadon sayd: âI hope, ye be Ill stonyd off a strake! 586 Att this tyme ye gett not Imayne, To Lyolyne ryde home agayne And say, wyth outen fayle: Ye, for ought, that he can doo, To his weddyng come not sho Wyth oute grette battayll!â Wyth sorowe hertt he hyed hym hame, As Magis had told, he told the same, How a man cled in mayle Had ouercome them bothe in fyghte: âIn all this world is non so wyghte Ne so sekyr to assayle!â 587 Imayne att hur deynere satt And grettely mervelayd was off Ã¾at, That he had done so dovghtily; Her hertte a littill bowed es: âHade it be done be worthynes, He were grette thanke worthy; There is no man fro hens to Roome, Mighte have done better, be my doome, Ne yett hens to Normandye; And he ne were right mekyll of myghte, He hadde neuer ouercome this knyghte; I se full well there bye, 588 In battell can he well endure Bothe be witte and be mesure, So haue I happe or sell; How so he farithe wyth folye, His dedis byn off grette chevalrye, Be god and sent Myghell!

Sethe Ã¾ou haste so faste for hym prayed, Lett hym come, I hold me payde!â There of they novghte tyne: The dwarffe was glad &amp; to hym he gaas And herttly prayed hym he has, To come and drynke a draw?t of wyne: âAnd ye shall dyne of the wylde, And wyth you shall younde maydon mylde Make a sufficiante fyne!â 591 As he were halff wood, he faris, And on the dwarff sternly he staris, That for feyre he quake: âNay, I praye to god, I lesse my witte, By none suche rapokys will I sitt, For all the fare, ye make! For hyr prowde wordes too Now wott I well, she will me sloo, Downe for I theme strake. For all your trappyng &amp; your trayne, There wyth shull ye bothe agayne The devyll off hell you take!â 592 Then had the dwarff sorow inovgh, Sorofully agayne he drowe, So sore aferde was hee. Imayn harde euery dele, She sayd: âSyr, so haue I sell, For thou trowest nou?te me Off the tale, that I the tolde, Be the grette god, thy selff I hold A more fole then hee! Hit farythe by the, as dothe be moo: Ye know not, that ye here also, Ye beleve not, that ye see! 593 Men makythe them folis, Ã¾at ar wyse, And witte them, Ã¾at non in lyese, So fayreth of them playne!â The dwarff was angurd sore And wrothely spake to hyr Ã¾erfore: âLett be thy fare, Imayne!

When they had dyned, forthe they rode, Right as a fole, wyth outen bode, Euer more his hedde he shoke. Hit drew to the nyghte faste, They saw a towne at the laste Stondyng on the syde of a broke. Hit was but a meane velage, So littill was the harburage, That both one inne they toke. 596 The inne was so streyte, for thy They bothe mvst in a chambur lye; Imayne grogyd noughte, In her hertte she thynkes sone, Ouer-mekyll amys has she done, To amend it, she hathe thought. He put of his armore euery dele, The dwarffe hym seruyd wonder-well, A mantill to hym he broughte, Blake wyth in and red wyth oute; He wrapud hym worthely abowte, That richely was iwroughte. 597 Off sylke he hade one a serke Wrought of a wondyr werke, Sowyde bothe well &amp; clene, A kyrtyll and a crochett fyne Full wele idyght all bedene. Imayne hym behyldes on the face: A fayrer knyght, thanne he was, Her thought, she hade not sene: âYs this a fole? Nay, certes, hee! In hertte sore forthynkes mee, So straunge that I have been!â 598 Imayne repentes, that she hathe done, And in her hertte she thynkes sone, To amend hit mekyll more. A womon is bothe warre &amp; wyse, Grette loue &amp; lykyng in them lyse, Who lyste, to lere at there lore; There they haue byn most straunge, All att onys then will they chaunge, Yff they be not sought ouer-sore, And love twyse so herttly syne: Godes dere blessyng and myne Muste they have therefore! 599 Imayne sayd: âSo haue I blis, That I so mekill have done amys, Sore forthynkes mee: Syr, forgyff me, that I haue done ille, And I shall amend me at your will, Be god &amp; be my lewte!â The dwarff was neuer so glad in hertte, Then lyghttly vp he stertte And sayd: âSyr, for charyte, As ye be curtayse knyght &amp; hend, Eysythe you and be this maydes frend, That desyrythe hit off thee! 600 And I shall be hyr borowe, syr, That ye shall fynde no more in hyr Forfettynge vnto yowe!â Ipomadon this sewraunce toke And as a fole his hedde he shoke And kest downe wyth the browe. Syne they were to supper sett, Imayne may not hyr hert lett, In love to dure nowe. The more she lokes on Ã¾at knyght, The more hyr loue is on hym ly?te, This is she fayne to vowe. 601 When they had suppud, they went to bede, Imayne was so streytly stede And prykyd wyth a payne; Trobelyng too and fro she lyes, Waltryng on a woofull wyse; All syghyng sayd Imayne: âIn a sory tyme it wase, Oute of the chambyre when I did pase; The sothe is not to layne: So wyse, as I was holden Ã¾erin, Off me my lady shall haue synne, Gyff I come neuer agayne!

She is not cause off thy woo, That to bewitt, iwys: Yff she the sent on her message, She bade the do no suche outerage, Thy body to ly be his! Thou haste thyne owne hert to constreyne, The blame ys thyne owne, Imayne, 603 That love dothe the so mekyll payne, Woundes wyth outen spere! Nay, it is turment, as men tellis! Hit is loveâwhat is hit ellys? â That peas hathe turnyd to werre!â Vp she ryses and downe she fallis, And on love playnly she callys: 'Why doste thou me this dere?â 604 I wyght the it neuer a dell, Though my lady loue hyr lemon well, That is so good a knyght, When I thus wyth a fole is taked, That among all lordes is lakyd For on so vnresnable a wyght! Nay, be my faythe, he is no fole, He is a noble knyght of skole, Who so hade sene hym wyth syght. Thowgh I allther wyseste be, His manlynes and gret bewte Makyth my loue on hym to lyght! 605 Ye, wheder it turne to well or woo, To know his will, I will goo!â Her mantell she toke her tille, To his beddes syde she yode, AnoÃ¾er while there she stode In a stody full stylle; She sayd: âAlas, fole, what is thy Ã¾ought?

But yf thou of Ã¾is foly blynne, Imayne, thou shamest all thy kynne, In faythe, than dos thou ille!â 606 Stille lay Ipomadon, And, how she made Ã¾is mekill mone, He hard euery dell; To hyr wordys he toke no kepe And lay right, as he dyd slepe, What she mend, he wyst full wele, That love full sore hyr bovndyn hase; To his bedde syde she gas Wyth sighyng and vncele; Softely at his clothes she drowe And sayd: âSyr, ye haue slept inowe, Be god and sent Myghell! 607 Awake a while and speke wyth me!â Grewosly vp starte hee And sayd: âWhat devill art Ã¾ou?â In his mowthe her hande he gate, Right as he wolde haue eyton Ã¾at; âMercy!â she cryed nowe, âFor love I maye not lengur layne, And, sertes, it is Imayne, That is comyn to you, Off all, Ã¾at I haue done wyth ille, To make amendes at your wille: Trewly, ye may me trowe! 608 Syr, I am a dukes doughttur dere, As grette a lady, as the fere, But neuer the lesse for thy, Love will lett me haue no peas: Syr, after my faders dysseace Off Burgayne ayre am I; Lett this alone, and goo we theder, Ye shall be lord off all togeddyre, Bothe of bowre and bye! I shall you make, so haue I ro, As grett a lord, as euer myghte sho, I say yow securlye!â 609 Ipomadon stille lay And hard all Ã¾at she wold saye; That she had care, he wyste: âDamysell, so god me save, To morow thy leyser Ã¾ou may haue, To say, what is thy lyste; To nyght thou gettes no more of me, Goo to thy bedde, I comaunde the, And lett me haue my reste!â A, littill comforte Ã¾ou haste, Imayne! Vnto hyr bedde she went agayne, But no thynge slepe she lyst. 610 At morow they rose &amp; went Ã¾er way; There way thorow a forest lay, The fowlys song merely &amp; swette. Off love, that is the grettest payne, Soo mekyll then had Imayne, Hyr dynere she forgette. The dwarff sayd to the damysell: âHere be syde is a fayre well, And Ã¾ere I red you sitte: A morsell to dyne, I wold, ye had!â There of was the maydon glad, She lyght adowne on hyr fete. 611 By syd hyr lyght Ipomadon, To hym streyght is Imayne gone And sett her hym be syde; Bakone venysone &amp; wyne The dwarff before them brought ful fyne, In erthe is not to hyde. As they at Ã¾ere dyner satt, A knyght come prykyng after Ã¾at, As faste, as he myghte ryde. Whan he saw the mayden there, So joyefull was he neuer yere In all Ã¾is world so wyde. Ofte sythes had he done his payne, To praye his lord for Imayne, That maydyn fayre &amp; clere; He graunte hym lyghtly, &amp; so he mow?te, The thyng, Ã¾at neuer coste hym nou?te, A fayre thyng in forty yere; Duke he was of grett Tesayle And Lyolynes broÃ¾er, wyth outen fayle, His name was Leyvnder. He rydythe streyght to the well And sayd: âDereworthy damysell, Well be you foundyn here! 613 Leppis on youre palffray &amp; comyÃ¾e wyth me, The duchesse off Tessayle I shall make Ã¾e, I have covetyd the longe!â Ipomadon, wyth hardy hertte Lyghttly vpon his stede he sterte And sayd: âSyr, fals ye sang: Yff thou so large gyff thy gyfte, Thou gettes nan here, be my thryfte, Me thynkes, than dydyste thou wronge!â The tother sayd: âWhat arte thou, That so nycely answeris nowe?

Grette sorow had Egyone, He hard men wepe so faste.

As he bade, his men dyde, In the woode they them hydde, Hym selff frome them dyd ryde. When they saw this knyght come, Joyefull they were all &amp; sum, All men prayed god hym spede. 648 Wyste non, what he was, sertayne, Allone but the maydon Imayne, She knew hym by his stede, That he hadde wone of Lyonder, But she wold not tell the fere, The dwarff she gan forbede, What he was, he shuld not tell; The dwarff sayd: âNay, damysell!â Off hur he hade suche drede And wyste not, wyth oute dowte, To tell his name covde he novght, The sothe to say in dede. 649 âImayne,â sayd the lady bright, âSyster, younder is a semely knyght, Right bygge of blode and bone: This is the same, I trowe, That yester day folowyd you, But no fole semys hym one!â âNay, madame, it is not hee, For he, be god and my lewte, Suche armore hadde he none!â Imayne was to blame therfore, She made hyr lady morne the more And terys to wepe goode woone. 650 Imayne parcevyd euery dell, That it was he, she wyst it wele, Yet tolde she not the fere.

Yff they were neuer so sekyr of mayle, Hedes made them breke and fayle, As wyttnes her be weste; Thorowe all there harnes be Ã¾ere syde Euyne bothe her sperys dyd glyde And brake, that sure was fest. 662 Thow?e they were neuer so strounge Ã¾at stounde, Bothe they tombled on the grounde, But nothere woondyd wore. This knyghtes, that hardy were of herte, Agayne vp on there stedes they sterte, As bryme as any bore. Wyth speris eftesonys they met to gaddyr, There strokes made there stedes to stakyre, So were they sad &amp; sore; There speris all to peces breste, They swang to geddyrs at the laste. 663 So manly they to gedyr fyghte, That battayle to deskrye no man my?te, The strokes, that were them be twene; The sparkels frome the helmes flowe As fer, that lemys in lowe, They share the gresse on the grene; The folke sayd, that beheld them, A gretter fight be twayne men Before was neuer seene; Might no man vnder the heyvyn lyght Know, whiche shuld the better fyght, So bygge men bothe they bene. 664 Lyolyne was a nobull mon, He strykis to Ipomadon, That on his helmet hit lyght; Nerehand he made hym fall, His stede stakyrd there wyth all, Was he neuer so wyghte; He was so stonyed in Ã¾at stounde, On knes he knelyd on the grounde, Imayne cryed lowde on highte And sayd wyth many a sighand sore: âThou, that has made bothe lesse &amp; more, Kepe and save younde knyghte!â 665 The fere Imayne can asse: âWhy, wot ye, syster, what he was?â âI say you: nay, madame, I wott neuer, what he es, But younde strokes of dystresse Makes my herte full tame!â Imayne wyste well, it was hee, That wold she not tell the fre, The more she was to blame; To love hym hath hyr selff thought, That, in trought, it avayles her nou?te, As god me kepe frome shame! 666 Full wele hard Ipomadone, How they dyd make Ã¾is mekill mone And to hym drewe hertte; Be that his stede wyth myght &amp; mayne Haue gotton his myghte right wele agayne, Vpon his fete he sterte; Grevossly in agayne he gett, And in that stowre so he hym hitt Wyth sterne strokes and smerte, All, that lokyd on, Ã¾ought grette skathe: Thorow helme &amp; browe bathe The blod oute braste he gerte. 667 Ipomadon was a nobull knyght And mekyll he cowde of fyght, He stroke tho Lyolyne, A quarter of his helme away, Downe by his shulders, sothe to sey, The nakyd swerd youde inne; But wold to god, it had gone nere, I trowe, hit shuld a hit hym there; The blow he cowde not fyne, Tille hit had clovyn his sadull in two, And of his noble stede also Insonder smote the chyne. 668 Tho fell Lyolyne to the grounde, He stert vp lyghttly in that stounde And sawe his owne blode; A swerd in hand hathe he tone And rennethe toward Ipomadon, As he were nerehand wood. Ipomadon saw hym so fare And wyth his hors he hym downe bare, Though he were neuer so wood. Vp he starte bothe pale &amp; wanne, To Ipomadon his stede thane Eygurly he yode. 669 Betwene two rybbis he smote his stede, The swerd in to his body yede Evyn to his hertte; There wyth all to grounde he yode; Ipomadon saw his stedis blode, Oute of his sadull he sterte, He swore be god and be sent Myghell: âMy stede shall be venged well, And god will gyf me querte!â So strong betwene them was the stowre, Hit was grette wondyr, they my?t indowre, Bothe Ã¾er strokes were so smerte. 670 The fyght betwene them was so long, A while to rest bothe they gang And on there swerdes they lenys; Lyolyne crabbyd spekes nowe: âHye devyll, what fole art thou, That this thy dedys demenys?

As god gaff hym grace that tyde, The swerd in his hand turnethe be syde, Or els he had be slayne, I wene. 678 Ipomadone was angred sore, He was as wode as any bore, When he had sene his blode. On the ring can he loke, That his moder hym toke, To dede when she yode; He towchyd the wounde wyth the ston, Off bledyng was he stavnchyd sone, So was the vertu good, The knyght was wonder-glad for thy; Lyolyne spekes full skornefullye: âHow lykes you in your mode? 679 Ye ar wyttly wondyd, I trowe; That ye come her, sore rewis yowe: Will ye haue any more? Lokes on youre arme and rede Ã¾at letter! I trowe full well, ye hade better Byn in peas langore!

Or I shall yeld me this to the, Slayne in the feld fyrste shall I be And onys for aye be quyte!â 681 Ipomadon grette wondur hadde, That he shuld be so streyttly bestadde Wyth o man euery dell: So hard sayd as he hathe ben, That o man shuld do hym Ã¾at tene Wyth a swerd off stele. He bethoughte hym on the fere, How he had louyde hyr many a yere; He sayd: âSo haue I sele, I slepe not, or it youlden bee!â His swerd in hand grypus hee And thynkythe, to venge hym well. 682 Thowe he were sore woundyd, I wene, That tyme hit was forgotton clene; As a bere thane was he bowne. His strokes was so sadde &amp; many, The tother wyst not, when he myght gyf any, So thyke came they downe; Lyolyne begynethe to chasse Vp and downe in the place; That sawe they in the towne. But when they had slayn the stedes bo, Wyst no man, whiche was oÃ¾eres foo, That made them all knele downe. 683 But, neuer the lesse, Lyolyne es A man off grett worthynes And manly faught ageyne; Bothe there strokes were so good, The erthe quakyd, as they stode, The sothe is not to layne. Att the last Ipomadon wex kene, He strykes to syr Lyolyne A stroke of muche mayne; His helme he clave in two, Thrugh hate &amp; heryne Ã¾an also He slave hym to the brayne. 684 âLong, syr, haue ye skornyd me, The worste, I trowe, your owne bee, For you be grettly wounde; A monke ye may be, when ye will, For ye be shavynne wile Ã¾er till, And right wele be ye crownde: Goo take youre abbyte on be tyme And helpe to syng bothe oure &amp; pryme, For ye be shavyne rownde!

On felde hovyd Thalamewe, Be tokyns well he hym knewe, On foote he saw hym byde; A good stede he brought hym tille, Vp he lepe wyth egur wille, To the tent gan he ryde. 688 Thalamewe had byn oftyn Ã¾at day Glad &amp; sorowe bothe, in faye, For syghttes, that he had sene, For they wyste neuer, whiche better was; Oute off the citte durste no man passe For the knyght, syr Lyolyne. In to the tent when they sawe hym ryde And no man trubled hym that tyde, There herttes brest nere for tene; A blake baner forthe toke he thore, And there wend both lesse &amp; more, It had ther enemye been. 689 He wold no lengur byde, To the wallys gan he ryde And cryed lowde on hight: âHaue done and dight you, damysell, Now maye ye se your selff full well, That Lyolyne ys wyght!

He spendithe well his long travayle, That at the laste, wyth outen fayle, His love gette maye! 739 The fere in to the citte yede; Ipomadon, when she come, toke hede And met hyr curtesly; The lady he full goodely grete, Wyth kyssynge to geddyr ar they mett, They tremblyd bothe for gree, As lovers maners hathe bene, That long while no noÃ¾er hathe sene, Ye maye well witt there by: Wyth myrthe they ar mett ageyne, There herttes will quake bothe for fayne Be way off drewry. 740 A long while no worde he spake, Bott at the last they both out brake, Thow? they were neuer so wrathe: âGod save you, damysell!â quod hee; She sayd: âSyr, welcome mot ye be!â Ther herttes quakyd bathe. All the cowrte was full fayne, That Lyolyne was so slayne, That hade theme wrought gret lathe. When they had sene Ipomadon, All they thankyd god alonne, That he skapyd that skathe. 741 Cabanus, wyth good intent Letturs to the kyng he sent And told hym euery deell, How hit was the drewlerayne, That had Lyolyne so slayne And wonne that lady lel. Mellengere wold no lengur abyde, But thedyre he rayud hym to ryde Wyth styff men vnder stele 742 The kyng sayd: âLordes, wyth outen wene, Long wyth oute a kyng haue we bene, In sorow that has you brought. Now god hathe sent you here a knyght, That will you mayneteyne in youre right: Was there neuer a better wroughte!â All prayden the kyng: âFor goddis sake âHelpe ye, that maryage for to make, That it be taryde noughte!â 743 Ipomadon sayd: âSecurlye, So mekill of price winne wolde I, That I am not krowened yit; I love your nece, so mot I thryve, More, thanne all the women of lyve: I reke nere, who it witte! Will my love asent there tille, Home in to Poyle, ser, wend I will And neuer more forther flytte, Wyth worshipe crownyd for to be And there to wedde my lady fre, And ye will acorde to hitte!â 744 The kyng sayd: âSo god me save, Here of we grette lykyng haue, Be hym, that owethe this daye!â Euery man made them redy faste, The waye in to Poyle they paste, To Berlett comyn ar theye. There hathe he weddyd that lady hend And brought there long love to ende; They crowyned them bothe, I saye, Hym for kyng &amp; hur for quene; The seventhe day they toke there leyve bedene, Bothe kyng and maye. 745 Ipomadon gave to Tholamewe, That to hym was euer good &amp; trewe, To his wyff Imayne Wyth landes, that was long &amp; brade; Duke of Burgayn he hym made, The sothe is not to layne; And to Jasone he gaff the fayre, The kynges doughttur of Lorayne &amp; his eyre, There of she was full fayne; And to his cosyne Egyone Bothe castell &amp; demayne 746 To geddyr ar this louers two, Was there neuer non, that louyd so, Borne of womon yett. Betwene them to was neuer no proffe, So wonder-grett delyte of love In bothe there herttes was sett. Fro the tyme, that they beganne, Right wele they had rekynd tille thanne, For no thyng wold they lett, But euer there love alyke was haate, Betwene them two was neuer no bate, Fro the tyme, that they were mette. 747 All, that had seruyd the fere ore, He warysound, both lesse &amp; more, Euery man in there degre. To gedyr gan this louers dwell, But, how long, I can not tell, Be god and be my lewte! So merely they ledde ther lyff, Betwene them two was neuer stryff, That man myght here or see. In hyr tyme she bare hym sonys two, The fayrest, that on ground my?t goo, No godelyer myght non bee. 748 Cawnus was the oldest brothere, Portusalus was the tothere, That after hym was bryme &amp; bold, And aftur his fader, wyth oute lesynge, Of Poyle was Cawnus crownyd kyng, As herytage hit wolde. And Portusalus of Calabere Was crownyd, for why it come of hyr, The modere mylde of molde. She toke hit hym be heritage, For hit was hyr in maryage, And nother hit was bought ne sold. 749 He was a full nobull kyng, Lyke to his fader in all thynge, That was so wonder-wighte, Of kyndnes and of curtessye, Off armvre and of chevalrye, Off semelynes be sight. Off the fader haue ye now harde: At the citte off Tebes how so he farde, There dyed that nobull knyght; And when that to the fere was told, Neuer aftur ette ne drynke she wold, For pure love dyed that wight. 750 Aftur Mellengers dysses Cabanus, wyth outen lesse, Off Cessyle crownyd was kyng; He was a full nobull man, His burgayes and his barons Ã¾anne Off hym had grette lykyng; A worthy lady he weddyd to wyff, Wythe joye and blys they led ther lyff, He and that lady yinge. They were full good at all degre, But wyth his brothere dyed hee, They bothe had one endynge. 751 Ipomadon hathe sent his sonde To lovers, that leve in londe, His messyngere makythe he me; He commaundythe on goddis behalue, To lovys wounde ye lay no salue, But poynttis of grette pette. Where right loue was in herte brought, That for a littill lette ye noughte: Sertes, no more dyd hee. This endythe Ipomadon, iwis. That good lorde bringe vs to his blis, That bought vs on the rode tre! And that ye shall for louers pray To hym, that made bothe nyght &amp; day. [To brynge vs to the blysse, that lestis aye.] AMEN for charyte. THE LYFE of IPOMYDON This version of Ipomadon is taken from the British Library MS. Harl. 2252. Mekely, lordyngis gentyll and fre, Lystene a while and herken to me: I shall you telle of a kynge, A dowghty man, with owte lesynge; In his tyme he was full bolde, A worthy man and wele of tolde; Feyre he was on fote and hand And wele belouyd in all that lande; Off body he was styffe &amp; stronge, And to no man he wold do wronge. Of Poyle-lond lord was he, Gold and syluer he had plente, Hye and low louyd hym alle, Moche honoure to hym was falle. Hys name was kynge Ermones, He hated wronge &amp; louyd pees. His quene was bothe bryght and shene; Moche goodnesse was hem bytwene. To god they preyd after an eyre: He sent theym one, bothe good &amp; feyre; Feyre he was of flesshe and blode, They thangkyd god with myld mode; To chyrche they bare the chyld thonne And crystenyd hym Ipomydon; Till a noryce they dyd hym take And for Ã¾at chyld grete joy they make; Many ladyes toke they, hym to ?eme, That serued all Ã¾at chyld to queme. The childe was feyre and waxe with all And playd in chamber &amp; in halle; The kynge of hym had joy plente: A feyrer child myght no man see. He lette calle a knyght full trew, That namyd was syr Tholomew; He was a knyght of grete Ã¾ouste And well bylouyd in that contre Bothe of more &amp; of lesse, For hym folowyd all goodnesse; Curteyse he was and hend of mouthe, Of norture, iwys, myche he couthe, That lordys vsyd in there halle And ladyes in chamber, grete &amp; smalle. Hermones sayd in his manere: âI haue a sonne, Ã¾at me ys dere, That shall be eyre of all my lande: I wille, ye haue hym to vndyrstand And to teche hym in all manere, Lyke as he thyne owne were!â âSir,â quod Ã¾is knyght myld of speche, âWold god, I cowthe your sonne teche Thyng, that myght torne hym to prow!â Ipomydon resseyueth he now; Tholomew, a clerke he toke, That taught the child vppon Ã¾e boke Bothe to synge and to rede, And after he taught hym other dede, Aftirward to serve in halle Bothe to grete and to smalle, Before the kyng mete to kerve, Hye and low feyre to serve, Bothe of howndis &amp; haukis game; Aftir he taught hym all &amp; same In se, in feld and eke in ryuere, In wodde to chase the wild dere And in the feld to ryde a stede, That all men had joy of his dede. All Ã¾at lond of hym spake good, For he was so myld of mode, Hende he was, curteyse &amp; fre, A godelyer man myght no man see; They preysed hym, bothe more &amp; lesse, Bothe man &amp; woman, as I gesse; All lovyd hym, Ã¾at were hym by, For he bare hym so curtessely. Now is he waxen a goodly man, To all godnesse he yaff hym than; He ys a myghty man for the nonys And wele ishape with grete bonys. In all that contre was there none, To hym myght cast Ã¾e tre ne stone. The kyng of hym grete joy had, For all folke of hym were glad. Every yere the kyng wold At whytsontyde a fest hold; Off dukis, erlis and barouns Many there come frome dyuers townes; Ladyes, maydens, gentill &amp; fre, Come thedyr frome ferre contre, And grete lordis of ferre lond Thedyr were prayd byfore the hand. When all were come to gedyr than, There was joy of many a man; Full riche, I wote, were hyr seruice, For better myght no man devyse. Ipomydon Ã¾at day servyd in halle, All spake of hym, bothe grete &amp; smalle, Ladies &amp; maydens byheld hym on: So godely a man they had sene none; His feyre chere in halle theym smert, That many a lady smote throw the hert, And in there hertis they made mone, That there lordis ne were suche one. Aftyr mete they went to pley, All the peple, as I you sey, Somme to chambre and som to boure And somme to the hye towre, And somme in the halle stode And spake, what hem thought gode. Men, that were of that cyte, Enquered of men of other contre, Of Calabre-lond who was kynge, And som answerd to this askynge: âHe ys dede sythe many a day, And by hynde he lefte a feyre may, That ys his doughter &amp; his eyre: In all Ã¾at lond is non so feyre, And so sayne all, Ã¾at hyr do see, She is Ã¾e feyreste, Ã¾at may bee: For, thoughe a man wold all Ã¾is day Hyr beaute discryve, he coude not sey All hyr worshyp ne hyr porture; She is a lady of grete honoure; In all Ã¾is world is non so wyse, That hir goodnesse kan devyse; Kynges and dukes comethe, hyr to seke, And so done emperoures eke And wold haue Ã¾at mayde to wyfe, But she will non, Ã¾at is on lyffe, But he doughtyeste be of hande, That suche on is non lyvande.â This word sprange wyde with all Bothe in chambre &amp; in halle Of the eyre of Calabre, Ã¾at feyre may. Ipomydon, he herkenyd ay: Bothe in chambre and in boure Men spake Ã¾at lady grete honowre; There was none, Ã¾at speke couthe, But they the lady had in mouthe. Ipomydon drew hym nye tho And ofte he herkenyd to &amp; fro; When he herd of hir so speke, Hym thought, his herte wold tobreke, But if he myght se Ã¾at mayde, To wete, if she were, as they seyde; Off hyr he had suche a thoght, That in mornyng he was broght, And so he mornythe nyght &amp; day, But yit to no man wold he sey. By than come forthe syr Tholomew, That was hys master good and trewe: âGode syr,â he sayd, âfor charyte, Telle me, who hathe grevyd the, And why thou makyst Ã¾is mornynge: I swere by Jesu, heuyn kynge, He shall abye on somme manere, But if it be thy fader dere!â âNay, master,â he sayd, ânot soo! I shalle you telle, or that I go; But if I haue the helpe of the, Joye thou getest neuyr of me, For now to you, syr, I will sey: Myne hert ys sette vppon a may, That she may nevir oute of my thoght, But I hyr se, I worthe to noght: The eyre of Calabre, for sothe, it is, That men speke of so myche blysse; But if I may Ã¾at lady serve, For care &amp; sorow my hert wille sterve!â Tholomew sayd: âLette be this wille! Thynke ye now youre selfe to spille? Ye ar the kynges son and hys eyre And may haue maryages gode &amp; feyre; There ys no man in crystente, Ãat richer maryages may haue, Ã¾an ye!â âMaster, these wordis avaylethe noght; But if I do, as I haue thoght, And to hyr go, as I you saye, I dye for hyr, with oute deley!â Sir Tholomew sayd: âSythe it is so, That ye may not hyr forgo, I shall go vnto the kynge And gete you leve, with oute lettynge, That ye may go, sir, at your wille And se the mayden all youre fille!â Sir Tholomew forthe gan goo, And to Ã¾e kynge he went tho; Vppon his knees he hym sette And the kyng full feyre he grette: âSir, of one thyng I you prey, Besechyng you, to sey not nay, Off your sonne Ipomydon, For he thynkith to be a mon: Off youre courte and youre norture He hathe wele lernyd, I you ensure; He wold wend in to strange contre, More in service for to bee; So that ye take it not at greffe, Full feyne he wolde prey you of leffe, And I shall make me redy, To wend with hym in companye And serve hym as his owne knyght And honoure hym with all my myght!â Than seyd Hermones, the kynge: âIff this be his owne desyrynge, I am well payed of his wille, For his askyng I hold skille, And now I wote, thou arte my frend, Sithe Ã¾at thow wilt with hym wend, Take you inough of all thynge And loke, ye wante no spendynge!â Sir Tholomew forthe gan goo, And to Ipomydon come he tho And sayd: âSyr, with oute lesynge, Your fadir hathe grantid youre askynge; He bad, Ã¾at ye no thyng shuld spare, And my self shall with you fare!â âI pray god thanke you, master dere! That ye me love, I may se here.â Than they busked theym to goo, Horse they toke and harnesse also; Off all thynge they wantid none. Now to his fader the child is gone; On knees he felle byfore the kynge And prayd hym of his dere blissynge: âThat blissyng haue Ã¾ou, my sonne trew, That Marye gaff hyr sonne Jesu!â Now they go forthe on hir way; Ipomydon to hys men gan sey, That ther be none of hem alle So hardy, by hys name hym calle, Where so they wend, ferre or nere Or ouer the strange ryuere: âNe man telle, what I am, Where I shall go ne whens I cam!â All they granted his comandement, And forthe they went with one assent. Ipomydon and Tholomew Robys had on and mantillis new Off the richest, Ã¾at myght bee, There was none suche in that contre, For many was the ryche stone, That the mantillis were vppon. So longe there weys they haue nome, That to Calabre they ar come; They come to the castelle yate, Ãe porter was redy there at; The porter to theyme they gan calle And prayd hym go in to Ã¾e halle: âAnd say thy lady gent and fre, That comen ar men of ferre contre, And if it plese hyr, we wold hyr prey, That we myght ete with hyr to day!â The porter sayd full cortessly: âYour erand to do, I am redy!â The lady to hyr mete was sette, The porter come and feyre hyr grette: âMadame,â he sayd, âgod you saue! Atte your gate gestis ye haue, Strange men, as for to see; They aske mete for charyte!â The lady comaundith sone anon, Ãat the gates were vndone: âAnd bryng theym all byfore me, For wele at ese shall they bee!â They toke hir pagis, hors &amp; alle. Ãese two men went in to Ã¾e halle; Ipomydon on knees hym sette And the lady feyre he grette: âI am a man of strange contre And pray you, yff your wille be, That I myght dwelle with you to yere, Of your norture for to lere! I am come frome ferre lond, For speche I herde byfore the hand, That your norture and your servise Ys holden of so grete empryse. I pray you, Ã¾at I may dwelle here, Somme of your seruyse for to lere!â The lady byheld Ipomydon, Hym semyd wele a gentilmon; She knew non suche in hyr londe, So goodly a man &amp; wele farand; She saw also by his norture, He was a man of grete valure. She cast full sone in hyr thoght, That for no seruyce come he noght, But it was worship hyr vnto, In feyre seruyce hym to do; She sayd âSyr, welcome ye be And all, Ã¾at comyn be with the! Sithe ye haue had so grete travayle, Of a service ye shall not fayle: In thys contre ye may dwelle here And at youre wyll for to lere; Of Ã¾e cuppe ye shall serue me, And all your men with you shal be; Ye may dwelle here at youre wille, But your beryng be full ylle!â âMadame,â he sayd, âgrantmercy!â He thankid the lady cortesly; She comandyth hym to Ã¾e mete, But, or he satte in any sete, He saluted theym, grete &amp; smalle, As a gentillman shuld in halle; All they sayd sone anone, They saw neuyr so goodly a man Ne so light ne so glad Ne none, Ã¾at so ryche atyre had. There was non, Ã¾at sat nor yede, But they had mervelle of hys dede And sayd, he was no lytell syre, That myght shew suche atyre. Whan they had ete and grace sayd And Ã¾e tabyll away was leyd, Vpp Ã¾an aroos Ipomydon, And to Ã¾e botery he went anon And his mantille hym aboute; On hym lokyd all the route And euery man sayd to other there: âWill ye se Ã¾e proude squeer, Shall serue my lady of Ã¾e wyne In his mantell, Ã¾at is so fyne!â That they hym scornyd, wist he noght, On othyr thyng he had his thoght: He toke Ã¾e cuppe of Ã¾e botelere And drew a lace of sylke full clere, Adowne than felle hys mantylle by; He prayd hym for his curtessy, That lytelle yifte Ã¾at he wold nome, Tille efte sone a better come. Vp it toke the botelere, Byfore the lady he gan it bere And prayd the lady hertely, To thanke hym of his cortessye. All, that was tho in the halle, Grete honowre they spake hym alle And sayd, he was no lytelle man, That suche yiftys yiffe kan. There he dwellyd many a day And servid the lady wele to pay; He bare hym on so feyre manere To knyghtis, ladyes and squyere, All louyd hym, Ã¾at were hym by, For he bare hym so cortesly. The lady had a cosyne, Ã¾at hight Jason, Full wele he louyd Ipomydon; Where Ã¾at he yede in or oute, Jason went with hym aboute. The lady lay, but she slept noght, For of the squyere she had grete thoght, How he was feyre and shape wele, Body and armes and euery dele; Ther was non in all hir land So wele besemyd, doughty of hand; But she kowde wete for no case, Whens he come ne what he was, Ne of no man cowde enquere Other, than he het the strange squyere. She hyr bythought on a queyntyse, If she myght know in ony wyse, To wete, where of he were come; Thys was hyr thoght all &amp; somme; She thought to wode hyr men to tame, That she myght know hym by his game. On the morow, whan it is was day, To hyr men than gan she say: âTo morow, whan it is daylyght, Loke ye be all redy dight With youre houndis more and lesse, In the forest to take my grese, And there I will my selfe be, Youre game to byhold and see!â Ipomydon had houndis thre, That he broght frome his contre; When they were to Ã¾e wodde gone, This lady and hyr men ichone, And with hem hyr howndis ladde, All, that euyr any howndis had, Sir Tholomew, foryate he noght, His mastres howndis thedyr he broght, That many a day ne had ronne ere; Full wele he thoght to note hem there. Whan they come to Ã¾e laund on hight, The quenys pavylon there was pight, That she myght se of the best All Ã¾e game of Ã¾e forest. The wandlessours went prow Ã¾e forest And to Ã¾e lady brought many a best, Herte and hynde, buk and doo And othir bestis many moo. The howndis, Ã¾at were of grete prise, Pluckid downe dere all at a tryse, Ipomydon with his houndis thoo Drew downe bothe buk and doo; More he toke with howndis thre, Than all Ã¾at othyr compaigne. There squyers vndyd hyr dere, Iche man on his owne manere; Ipomydon a dere yede vnto, Full konnyngly gan he it vndo, So feyre Ã¾at veneson he gan to dight, That bothe hym byheld squyere and knyght; The lady lokyd oute of hyr pavyloun And saw hym dight the venyson; There she had grete deynte, And so had all, Ã¾at dyd hym see. She sawe all Ã¾at he downe droughe, Of huntyng, she wist, he cowde inoughe, And thoght in hyr herte than, That he was come of gentill men. She bad Jason, hyr men to calle; Home Ã¾ay passyd, grete &amp; smalle, Home they come sone anone. This lady to hyr mete gan gone And of venery had hyr fille, For they had take game at wille. Ipomydon serued, as I vndirstand, As he was wonte done byfore hand. âSir,â she sayd, âsanz fayle, Ye haue bene in grete travayle: Anothyr man, as I you say, Shall serue me at mete Ã¾is day; Go to ?oure mete sone on hye, My cosyn Jason shall sytte you by!â The ladyes hert was on hym cast And she byheld hym wondir-fast, Euer on hym she kest hyr eye, Ipomydon full wele it sye, Anone it gaff hym in his thoght, To loke ageyne, lette wold he noght, Nor no more coward thoght he to be Off his lokyng, than was she. The lady parseyued it full wele, Of all his lokyng euery dele, And there with bygan to shame, For she myght lightly falle in blame; If men parseyued it ony thyng, Bytwyxe hem two suche lokynge, Than wold they sey all bydene, That somme loue were hem bytwene, Ãan shuld she falle in deshonoure And lese myche of hyr honoure. She thoght, to werne hym preuely By hyr cosyn, Ã¾at sat hym by: âJason,â she sayd, âpou art to blame, And ther with the ought to shame, To byhold my mayd Imayne: Euery man to othyr wille seyne, That bytwyx you ys somme synne: Of thy lokyng, I rede, Ã¾ou blynne!â Ipomydon hym bythoght anone, How Ã¾at she blamyd Jason With oute deservyng euerydele, But the encheson he parseyued wele; Downe he lokyd and thoght grete shame, That Jason bare for hym Ã¾at blame; Stille he satte and sayd no more, He thoght to dwelle no lenger thore. As the lady hyr chambre had tone, Byfore hyr come Ipomydon And sayd: âMadame, god yeld it the, The grete honoure, Ã¾ou haste done me! Haue good day, now wille I fare In to Ã¾e contre, that I was are!â âFelaw,â she sayd, âchese at Ã¾i wille, Whether Ã¾ou wilt wend or abyde stille!â He went anone in to the halle And toke his leue of grete and smalle, Bothe at lesse and at more, And they thoght there of ryght sore. To Jason he wendith anone ryght And takith hys leve with hert vnlyght; Than sayd Jason on hye: âLeve syr, leve this folye And with my lady Ã¾ou dwelle here, She louythe the in all manere: Iff thow wende forth in this wille, For sorow she wille hyr self spylle!â âJason, felow, lett be thy thoght: Lenger dwelle here ne wille I noght, For I shall wende home to my kynge And leve you here with all joyinge!â âMy dere frend, sythe it is so, That thou wilt algatis goo, Yeve me leve, with the to wend, Into what contre Ã¾at Ã¾ou wilt lend, I wold full fayne do it, in dede!â âGrantmercy, syr, god yif the mede! With me hedyr come ye noght: Ne shall with me but that I broght!â He toke hys leve at Jason there And went forthe ellys where. Whan the lady wist, Ã¾at he was gone, A sory woman Ã¾an was she oon; Vppon hyr bedde she gan hyr ley And to hyrself than gan she say: âThere is not suche a man in lande, If he be doughty of his hand, As he is of body to see, Of what lond that euyr he bee! âAllas,â she sayd, âand welle away, That for a word he went away! Had men sought all mankynde. A feyrer body shuld no man fynde!â This lady, Ã¾at was of ryche blode, That nyght she cowde but lytell gode, That she shuld suche mone make For a strange mannys sake, That no man wist, what he was, But yit she sayd ofte: âAllas, For suche ys none in crystente, Full wele hym semeth, a knyght to be!â Thus she comforted hyr amonge And ofte she felle in mornyng stronge. Ipomydon went, as ye may here, By hynde he lefte a messyngere, For to brynge hym tythyngis newe, Iff there were any, that he knewe; What they were, he shuld hym brynge, And that anon, with oute lettynge. The land of Poyle he hathe nome And to Ã¾e kyng, his fader, ys come And to Ã¾e quene, his modyr dere, For hym they made ryght glad chere. Curteyse he was, bothe stoute and bolde, And myche in land he was of tolde; All men hym louyd, suche was his grace. Of chyld Ipomydon here is a space. They were to gedyr many yere With myche myrth &amp; game in fere; The kyng his sonne knyght gan make And many another for his sake. Justes were cryed, ladyes to see, Thedyr come lordys grete plente, Turnementis atyred in the felde, A Ml. armed with spere and shelde. Knyghtis bygan to gedir to ryde, Somme were vnhorsyd on euery syde. Ipomydon Ã¾at day was victoryus And there he gaff many a cours, For there was non, that he mette And his spere on hym wold sette, That not aftir with in a lytell stounde Hors and man bothe went to ground. The heraudes gaff Ã¾e child Ã¾e gree, A Ml. pownd he had to fee. Mynstrellys had yiftes of golde, And fourty dayes Ã¾ys fest was holde. Off the eyre of Calabre here will I telle And of hyr baronage fayre &amp; well, How that they had at counselle bene And of assent was theym bytwene, Ãat here lady shuld take an husband, To gouerne theyme and all there land, By cause she was of yong age. To hyr come all hyr baronage And sayd: âMadame, we wille you pray, That we myght oure will sey! Youre lond thynkyth, ye do theyme wronge, With owte kyng to dwelle so longe, That myght gouerne Ã¾is land so feyre, And bytwyxe you gete an eyre And hold Ã¾is land in right blode!â The lady answerd with myld mode: âYour counseyle ys gode euerychone, But husband yit will I haue none!â They toke leve and wente here way And bytaught the lady gode day. To counselle new than gon they gone And full sone they were at one, To kyng Melliager, hyr eme, they went And told hym of the ladyes entent: For an husband Ã¾ey had bene at herre, And she yaff theym lyght answere. Furthe they went with oute lettyng, To the land, there he was kynge. Kynge Melliagere sone they found And anone they knelyd to ground, Praying hym, as lord dere, That he wold here prayere here; They told hym all to gedyr nowe, What Ã¾at they had done and howe, And suche answere she yaffe theyme tylle, Husband to haue she had no wille: âWhere fore, lord, we wold you prey, For we wote wele, Ã¾at ye best may, Councelle wele oure lady nowe, As best may be the remes prowe!â âLordyngis,â he sayd, âwith outyn fayle, I assent vnto your concaylle, For to my cosyn will I goo And make hyr, or I wend hyr fro, Me to graunt, husband to take, Or clene my love she shall forsake!â Than they thankyd the kynge so free And went home to theyre contre. Kyng Mellyager to his cosyn ys gone, And she hym welcomyd feyre anon, And of his comyng she was glad, And moche joye of hym she made. Whan they had take hyr sporte in halle, The kynge to counselle gan hyr calle And sayd: âDere cosyn, here my wille: An husband must ye take you tylle, The whiche may of Ã¾is land by kynge And gouerne it in all thynge; For no woman may take on hand, Wele to gouerne suche a land!â âSir,â she sayd, âye be of my blode, I hold your counselle feyre &amp; good And aftir it feyne wold I doo, As most worship may be me to: But, sythe Ã¾at I haue husband shalle, Do make crye vndir Ã¾is castell walle Justes, there thre dayes to laste, And who Ã¾at there may bere hym best And that doughtyest ys of hande, Shall welde me and all this lande! Syr, loke, ye crye, with oute delaye, By halfe yere afore the day, That it be know ferre and nere, On what day it shall be here!â Now thynkith this feyre may On the strange squyere nyght &amp; day: âIf he be suche, as I hym holde, Also doughty and so bolde, For me than he wille be here And wynne me in all manere!â Heraudes were callyd in hye, Thrughe the land to make the crye; This crye was knowen ouer all, In all the land grete and smalle. Ipomydons messyngere, anone Home to Poyle gan he gone; The crye he vndyrstode wele And told his maister euery dele. Ipomydon in hert was full glad, Whan that he the tythyngis had; He callyd his maister Tholomewe, That euer was full gode and trewe, And sayd: âSyr, make vs redy, For in to Calabre now will I!â He purveyd hym III noble stedis And also thre noble wedys; That one was white as any mylke, The trappure of hym was white sylke; Ãat other was rede, bothe styffe and stoure, The trappure was of Ã¾e same coloure; Blake Ã¾an was Ã¾at othir stede, The same coloure was his wede; Thre greyhondis with hym he ladde, The best, Ã¾at his fader had, Rede and whyte and blake they were. Whan he was dight in this manere, With hym he toke a feyre may And went forthe on his jorney; Into Seseney the wey they nome. With in the lond whan Ã¾at he come, He bad Tholomew take his stedys, All his men and all his wedys: âAnd take your inne in the cyte By nyght, Ã¾at no man you see! Lette no man se theyme nyght ne day, But them, Ã¾at shall here mete ley!â Hys owne wey forthe he nome, Vnto a forest tyll Ã¾at he come; There huntyd kyng Mellyager in Ã¾at forest Atte hert &amp; hynd and wyld beste; Ipomydon mette with a knyght And askyd hym anone right, Who that grete lord was, That in the forest made Ã¾e chase; The knyght sayd: âYff ye will here, It ys the kynge Mellyagere, That thus huntithe here be syde!â Ipomydon vnto Ã¾e kynge gan ryde And saluted hym as a kynge dere, He welcomyd hym on feyre manere; He prayd the kynge, if it were his wille, A lytelle stounde to stonde stille And here the speche of a knyght; The kynge hym grauntid anone right. âI am a knyght, as ye may see, And come I am frome ferre contre; For nobley of you I haue herd telle, All my desyre ys, with you to dwelle, In youre contre to be here, The manere of Ã¾is land to lere!â The kynge byheld Ã¾e knyght than, Hym thoght, he was a godely man: âIn all this land, bothe ferre &amp; nere, Ys none so feyre a bachelere!â âSir knyght,â he sayd in feyre manere, âGladly shall ye dwellyn here!â Ipomydon sayd: âI shall you telle, At this couenant wold I dwelle: Full fayne I wold be redy bowne, To lede your quene bothe vp &amp; downe, Fro hyr chambre to hyr halle, &amp; my lemman I wold hyr calle; My mayden, Ã¾at is of honoure, Shall dwelle in Ã¾e quenys boure; At euery terme, Ã¾at I hyr lede, A kusse of Ã¾e quene shall be my mede: I will no more for my servyse!â The kyng anone, with oute avyse, Thoght, he come for othyr thynge, And grantyd hym his askynge. Anone the kyng lefte his game, Home they rode bothe in same And to Ã¾e quene Ã¾e covenantys seyd. âAs ye haue done, I hold me payd!â There he dwellyd many a day With myche myrthe, game &amp; play; Full feyre he dyd his servyse And servyd Ã¾e quene at hyr devyse; Where Ã¾at she went, in boure or halle, The quene his lemman dyd he calle. So it befelle vppon a day, That to Ã¾e justes men dyd them araye; Thedyr wold kyng Mellyagere With all the knyghtis, Ã¾at with hym were: Sir Campanyus, Ã¾at good knyght, In all Ã¾at lond was none so wight, And sir Caymys, Ã¾e kyngis steward, A doughty knyght and no coward. The kynge sayd to sir Ipomydon, That callyd was the quenys lemmon, As he mette hym in the halle: âThe tyme ys come, Ã¾at juste we shalle: Dight you now, go we oure way, I wote, ye thynke, to wynne Ã¾e may!â And he answerd with myld chere: âWho shuld Ã¾an serve my lady dere? For, certis, of justes can I noght, To serve my lady is all my thoght; If I hyr lefte for other dede, I were not worthy, to haue my mede!â The kynge hym turnyd Ã¾an away And to his knyghtis gan he say: âSo feyre a body, as bereth hee, Allas, a coward Ã¾at he shuld be!â Campanyus and all, Ã¾at stode hym by, Bymenyd that knyght curtesly; They toke there leve at Ã¾e quene And wente forthe all bydene; Vnto Calabre they toke Ã¾e way, There they shuld just Ã¾at other day. Leve me theyme at Ã¾e justynge And talke we now of other thynge, Off Ipomydon &amp; Ã¾e lady shene, That was at home with Ã¾e quene. Whan tyme come, Ã¾ey shuld to mete, Ipomydon brought hir to hyr sete; In to the halle whan he hyr broght, To take hys cusse forgate he noght. Whan she had etyn, to chambre she wente, Ipomydon, to the quene he mente: âTo morow, madame, I wold you pray, With leve of you, whan yt is day, Go to Ã¾e forest, to take a dere: My greyhondes ranne not Ã¾is quartere; Whyle my lord ys at Ã¾e justynge, My greyhoundis I wold feyne se rennynge. O thyng, madame, I wold you pray: If I come not be tyme of day, Whan ye se tyme, to mete ye wend, For I wote neuyr, how long I lend!â âSir,â she sayd, âgod you spede!â He kyssyd hyr and forthe he yede. Ipomydon callyd his master than, Sir Tholomew, that noble man: âTo my hostage ye go by nyght, My white stede, loke, he be dight, And with the armure hedyr ye brynge To morow, or the day sprynge! Hye you oute at Ã¾e castelle yate And frome all syght kepe you all gate!â Ipomydon went to Ã¾e portere And prayd hym, if his wille were, The yate myght by opyn or day; Ãe porter grantyd hym &amp; toke hym Ã¾e key, And at Ã¾e fryst cokke roose hee; Furthe he went with greyhondis thre, In a lesshe he dyd hem do And blew a grete horne also; He blew lowde and shoke it wele, That it ronge, all Ã¾e castelle. The maydenys to Ã¾e quene gan say: âYoure lemman gothe, to wynne Ã¾e may!â The quene answerd with oute lettynge: âAll men konne not of justynge: Thoughe he kanne not of suche dedys, He may be gode at other nedis!â Ipomydon is to Tholomew gone And toke hym hys houndis euerychon, He prayd hym, as his maister dere, To note theyme wele in all manere And with the flesshe kepe theym in place, There Ã¾at theyre stevyn sette was. He sayd: âGod spede Ã¾e, lord dere! There to I shall do my deuere.â Ipomydon went forthe and his page, Till he came to an ermytage; He lokyd forthe and byheld, Many a knyght he saw in feld; Iche to other fast gan ryde With grete sperys on iche syde. He toke his spere anone ryght And lepte on his stede so light; In he come amonge hem alle, Throw the clowdis as he had falle; The fryst knyght he gan to ryde With a spere, Ã¾at wold abyde, In myddis the sheld he sette his spere, That hors and man he gan downe bere. Anothir knyght he mette also, That his bakke tobrast in two; The thryd he sloughe, with oute lettynge, The fourthe wente in to Ã¾e same rynge. There was no knyght, Ã¾at he mette, Ãat wold hys spere on hym sette, But if his spere all tobrakke, He wold hym to Ã¾e ground shake. The lady lay ouer Ã¾e castell walle And byheld Ã¾e justis alle; She sent speres white and blake To all men, Ã¾at wold hem take; Jason she sent vnto Ã¾e knyght, That in white harneise was dight, To bere hym sperys at his nede; She thoght hym worthiest of dede, And every man till othir gan saye, He was Ã¾e manlyest there Ã¾at day. Than all Ã¾e peple homeward went And Jason to Ã¾e knyght hym bente, Praying hym: âAs lord dere Come home here to thyne owne manere, For wele I wote, thou shalt be kynge, The whiche is gretly to my lykynge!â âJason,â he sayd, âgod Ã¾e foryelde Thy grete servyce to day in Ã¾e felde, That Ã¾ou hast done me in Ã¾is place!â Jason merveyled of Ã¾at case: âSir,â he sayd, âfor charyte, What man be ye, Ã¾at knoweth me?â âIt were merveile, but I Ã¾e knew: Somme tyme Ã¾ou were my felow trewe! I am,â he sayd, âÃ¾e strange squyere, That servyd my lady Ã¾is endris yere; Grete hyr wele on all manere: This day for hyr I haue bene here, But lenger dwelle here may I noght, Suche tithyngis to me is broght Home frome myne owne contre, And forth I most, as I telle the!â âA, sir,â he sayd, âart thou he? For god, Ã¾at dyed vppon a tree, Come now &amp; with my lady speke, Or ellis I wote, hyr herte will breke, For, and she knew, Ã¾ou went away, She lyveth nevir to morow day!â âThou shalt, Jason, vndirstond: I wold not tarye for all Ã¾is land!â He toke his leve and went his way. Jason to Ã¾e quene gan say Word for word euery dele: âThe strange squyer grette you wele: He was Ã¾at ylke whyte knyght, That in Ã¾e feld so richely was dight!â This lady to hyr chambre ys gone; A sory woman was she one, Vppon hyr bedde she gan downe falle On swoune afore hyr maydens alle, And whan she roos of swounynge, Hir handis fast gan she wrynge: âAllas,â she sayd, âwhat I was wode, A witteles thyng, and cowde no goode: My witte myght haue seruyd me, That suche a man doughty most be!â But yit she trowyd in hyr thoght, So lightly wold he leve hyr noght; That was hyr comfort most in care, And ellis she had hyr self forfare. Ipomydon to his maister camme, He found hym and his houndes anone; Plente of flesshe had he caught, Hors and harneyse he hym bytaught, And eyther passyd to hyr inne. Ipomydon the flesshe toke with hym, Byfore the quene he ganne it bere, As she was sette at hyr sopere. âMadame,â he sayd, âmy lord, Ã¾e kynge, Hathe not Ã¾us sped with hys justynge!â All the halle, that Ã¾ere were in same, At hym they loughe &amp; had game. Ipomydon went to his mete, Faste he brake &amp; faste he ete, For he had fasted all Ã¾at day, Suche a lykynge he had in pley. As they satte as there sopere, In comythe the kyngis messyngere; Vppon his knee he hym sette And Ã¾e quene feyre he grette. To hyr sent word hyr lord, Ã¾e kynge, How they had done at Ã¾e justynge; Tho askyd Ã¾e quene anone right: âWas there any, with Campanyus dyd fight, That was so doughty in Ã¾e feld, Outher with spere or with shelde?â âYa, madame, so mot I thee, Ther was oone, worthe suche thre: In white armure he was dight, In all Ã¾e feld was none so wight, But if it were my lord, Ã¾e kynge, For he is passand in euery thynge!â The quene asked: âWhat was hee?â The messyngere sayd: âSo mot I the, At Ã¾at tyme knew hym no mon!â Than byspake Ipomydon And sayd: âMessyngere, I the pray, Vnto my lorde, Ã¾e kyng, Ã¾ou saye, That my good whyte greyhound Hathe sleyne more dere and broght to ground, Than wold hys haue done to daye!â Ipomydon to Ã¾e quene gan saye, Praying, he moste Ã¾e kyng somme bere, To wete, Ã¾at he was no lyere. The quene ys to hyr chambre gone, Thedir ledithe hyr Ipomydon; He prayd leue, on Ã¾e morow to play, As he had done Ã¾at othir day. The quene hym grauntyd curtessly; To hys maister he dyd hym hye And prayd hym, sone and anone To his ostage Ã¾at he shuld gone And brynge hym his rede stede, Foryete noght Ã¾e same wede, In the place, Ã¾at they were ere, And Ã¾at he shuld be erly there. Full erly roose Ipomydon, His horne, hys greyhond, he toke Ã¾on, He blew it lowde &amp; wele gan shake, That all Ã¾e maydens Ã¾o gan awake; Than sayd all, Ã¾at were Ã¾ere inne: âYour lemman gothe, Ã¾e mayd to wynne!â The quene answeryd, as she dyd ere: âHe may more wynne, Ã¾an he were Ã¾ere!â The kyngis messengere forthe went And toke hym hole his present; Euery word Ã¾e kynge he tolde, Than seyd Ã¾e knyghtys, Ã¾at were bolde: âAllas, Ã¾at suche a knyght shuld leve, But he to manhode wold hym yeve!â Ipomydon to his maister wente, His armure &amp; his stede he hent, Ãe rede greyhound he toke hym right; That day he prayd hym do his myght And in Ã¾at place kepe Ã¾e fleshe With Ã¾e greyhoundis in Ã¾e lesshe. Forthe he went in Ã¾at stounde And to Ã¾e ermytage he came sound, In to Ã¾e feld he lokyd Ã¾anne, He saw many an armyd man, Hym he armyd and forthe gan ryde; Faste they justyd on euery syde, And euyr byheld Ã¾e lady bryght, If she myght se Ã¾e whyte knyght; For she on hym non eye myght caste, She thoght, hyr hert wold tobreste. Jason Ã¾at day was made knyght And richely in Ã¾e feld was dight; Ipomydon, this case he sawe, Ãat Jason was knyght, his owne felawe; To hym he prekyd faste in hye; Whan he shulde mete, he rode hym by: That day he taught hym, so to done, That worthely he wanne his shone. But Ipomydon, as I you saye, Many a knyght he fellyd Ã¾at day, So many sperys he brakke on sondre, That all folke on hym had wondere; They sayd, there nas in all Ã¾at lande Noon so manly man of hande, For all they sayd Ã¾o full tyte, The rede was better, Ã¾an Ã¾e white, And so he bare hym Ã¾at daye, That knyghtys wexe wery of his playe. Whan euery knyght to hys inne gan ryde, Sir Jason dyd with hym abyde And sayd: âSyr knyght, god Ã¾e foryelde Thy grete helpe to day in Ã¾e felde! Thrughe the the more loue I wanne, That more desyre I ne canne. I wote, Ã¾ou shalt be lord here, For I know noon, Ã¾at is Ã¾i Ã¾ere, Saffe yistyrday the whyte knyght, But he is owte of lond dight!â âNay, Jason, my trew fere, Thou shalt se, Ã¾at I am here! But grete wele my lady dere, For hyr to day haue I bene here, The whiche, I say, with outen fayle, Will me torne to grete travaile, And many an hors ryde to dede, Or I come there, Ã¾at me most nede; For all my lond I lese for ay, But I be there by a certeyne day!â Jason sayd: âSyr, mercy, And thynke vppon my lady, For, &amp; ye passe hyr Ã¾us froo, For sorow she wille hyr selfe slo!â Ipomydon sayd: âBy heuyn kynge, At this tyme I will not lynge, But grete hyr wele &amp; haue gode day, And I shall come, whan Ã¾at I may!â Sir Jason passyd forthe in hye And this tale tolde to the lady: âThe rede knyght and Ã¾e whyte ys one, But, for sothe, now ys he goon!â Than sory was that swete thynge And efte she felle in mornynge; But she bethought hyr, as she dyd are, And ellis she had hyr selfe forfare. Ipomydon to his maister yede And toke his armure and his stede, He toke the flesshe and Ã¾e greyhound And gan to go toward the towne; His hors he had and his huntyng wede, Anone in to Ã¾e halle he yede, Byfore Ã¾e quene the flesshe he leyd: âHere ys my dayes jorney!â he sayde; At hym they loughe and made glad chere, The quene went to hyr sopere And hyr leman sat hyr by; The kynges messengere come in hye And sayd, Ã¾e kyng grete hyr wele; The justis he told hyr euerydele. The fryst word Ã¾e quene gan say: âCome Ã¾e white knyght there to day?â âNay,â he sayd, âby god allmyght, But there was a noble rede knyght, The whiche all men, Ã¾at gan hym see, Said, Ã¾at he was bettir Ã¾an hee.â Ipomydon sayd to Ã¾e messengere: âRecomand me to my lord so dere And say, that Gager, my rede greyhounde, Moche dere hathe broght Ã¾is day to ground: I had more joye at hys rynnynge, Than to stand &amp; stare, to se Ã¾e justynge! Madame,â he said, âso god me amend, Of youre game, I rede, ye hym send!â âSir,â she said, âas ye thynke beste! Fare wele, for now I go to reste!â Vnto hyr chambre she went Ã¾on, Byfore hyr come Ipomydon; Ones of leue he wold hyr praye, He wold not hunte after many a day. She hym grantyd of his bone, To his master he went sone; He yede and fette, with oute lakke, Stede and harnesse, Ã¾at was blakke; He knew Ã¾e way at Ã¾e beste, Where they shuld mete in Ã¾e foreste. The messyngere come vnto Ã¾e kynge, Hys present feyre he dyd hym brynge; What he shuld sey, forgatte he noght; The kynge of hym wondir thoght And in his hert had grete pyte, So goodly a man, as was hee, That euyr he was so lytell of prise And ther to full of cowardise. What euyr they thoght in here hert, Many of them he made to smerte. Latte hym go, god hym spede, Till efte sone we of hym rede! Ipomydon rose erly there, As he was wonte to done ere; Forthe he rode blowyng his horne, That all the maydens gan hym scorne And sayd: âYour leman gothe to playe, For he wille wynne vp all to daye!â The quene hem blamyd wondir-faste, Hyr hert to hym was somwhat caste. To hys master he went in hye And prayd hym full hertely, To take more dere, yf he myght, Than he dyd Ã¾e tother day light. Anone his hors he gan dighte And rode to Ã¾e feld forthe ryght, Armure blak lyke the stede. To Ã¾e ermytage forthe he yede; Anone his stede he bestrode, Amonge hem all in he rode; He was sone warre of a knyght, That in rede atyre was dight âThis rede knyght was here yisterday, He justid for Ã¾at feyre may: There was none, bore hym so feyre, Of Calabre he wille wynne Ã¾e eyre!â The lady lay on toure on hye The reed knyght full sone she see, She wende, it were Ã¾e strange squyere, Ãat she hopid shuld be hyr fere. Her purpos was, to hym to wende, Whan the justes come to ende, And brynge hym home with feyre manere, To hyr was none so leffe ne dere. Right as the quene in thoght stode, The rede knyght anone in rode; The blake toke a spere in honde, To just with hym, he thoght in londe, And eyther with othyr sone they mette, In myd the sheld the stroke they sette. The blak knyghtes spere was stiffe and stronge, And there with he gan fast thronge The knyght and stede with in a stounde, That they lay bothe vppon the ground. Ipomydon toke Ã¾e rede stede, To hys men he gan hym lede. Than come forthe syr Caymys, A proude knyght &amp; a daynous; Just he wold with Ã¾e blak knyght, But all to lytelle was hys myght; With a spere, Ã¾at welle wold laste, Knyght and hors downe he caste. Sir Caymys horse he toke in hye, The rede knyghtes he sette hym bye. Sir Campaynus hym faste byhelde, He thoght, to just with hym in felde; Hys thoght was, to wynne Ã¾e maye, But he fayled foule of his praye. Forthe they rode to gedyr faste, That there sperys a sondre braste; Bothe they were stiffe and stronge, Ãey luste to ryde, Ã¾ey taryed not longe, And eyther of theym toke a spere; Campaynus Ã¾oght, hym downe to bere. In mydde Ã¾e place Ã¾e knyghtes mette, Ipomydon so Campanus grette, That knyght and stede in Ã¾at case Felle on hope in mydde Ã¾e place. The blake knyght toke hys stede goode, The kynge there of began to wode, That his knyghtes bore downe were; He folowyd Ã¾e knyght with a spere; He had thoght, to done hym harme, For he smote hym throw Ã¾e arme. Ipomydon with Ã¾at stroke abrayde And to Ã¾e kynge Ã¾us he sayde: âAs Ã¾ou arte kynde, gentille and free, Abyde and juste a cours with me, And I foryiffe Ã¾is vilanye!â The kynge sayd: âTherto grant I!â Full fayne he wold haue bene away, But for shame he sayd not nay. The kynge and he, in place Ã¾ey mette, The blake knyght suche a stroke hym sette, That kynge and hors downe he caste, That hym thoght, hys nekke tobraste. The kynges stede he ledde away, Ãat euery man to other gan saye: âHe may wele be kynge of londe For the doughtyeste man of hand, That any man sawe euer ere!â And so sayd all, Ã¾at there were, They gaffe hym Ã¾e gre of felde For Ã¾e doughtyest vndyr shelde. Herawdis discryued hys arme blake And sayd, in Ã¾e world was not his make, And they sayd, with oute lettynge, He was worthy to be kynge. Whan euery man homeward gan draw, Jason went to his felawe: âCome home, syr, I you pray, To youre owne, I darre wele say: Ye shal be made kynge of lond For Ã¾e doughtiest man of hand!

Recomaund me to hyr anone righte, For I must travaile day &amp; nyght!â He toke hys leve &amp; forthe ganne fare; Jason tornyd home full of care, &amp; whan he come in to the halle, He tolde Ã¾e lady, what was byfalle, The blak knyght was Ã¾e squyer stronge, That had dwellyd with hyr so longe, And how he wanne hyr with his hand: âBut he is passid oute of Ã¾is lande!â The lady mornyd &amp; was full woo And thoght, hyr hert wold brest on two, But yit she trowed in hyr thoght, So lightly wold he leve hyr noght, Sithe Ã¾at he had, with oute fayle, For hyr loue so grete travaile.

Sone the lordis dyd theyme see, There they satte in companye, They had wondyr of Ã¾e stedys And of Ã¾e men in dyverse wedis; The kynge knew Ã¾e burgeyse at alle, Anone to hym he lette hym calle: âWhose be those stedis, Ã¾at be so stronge?

Than sayd Ã¾e eyre of Calabre bright: âHelp, to gete me Ã¾at gentill knyght! But I hym haue, Ã¾at in feld me wanne, For sothe, I shall nevir haue man!â Anone gan sir Caymes say: âHis he stolyn thus away And broke my ladyes boure, Ã¾e quene, And ledde a way hyr mayden shene, Worthe I nevir glad ne fayne, But I brynge theym bothe agayne!â The kynge was bothe curteyse &amp; gente, Full goodly he reseyved his present; Hertely he thankid Ã¾e gentill knyght And sayd, in lond was none so wight. He yaff Ã¾e burgeyse for his message An C L to herytage. But Ipomydon forth is gone And his men euerychone; His messyngere he lefte stille there, To brynge hym tithyngis, if any were, In suche manere, as they felle; What they were, he shuld hym telle. Ipomydon come by a foreste, A while he thoght there to rest, He was forwakyd &amp; all werye; To hys men he sayd on hye: âSlepe I muste, with oute fayle, For I am wery for travayle!â He layd his hede on his mayden barme And felle on slepe; he thoght no harme. He had not slepyd but a while, Not the space of a myle, The mayden sawghe forthe comynge An armyd knyght, faste rydynge; She woke hyr lord &amp; bad hym ryse, For hyr hert bygan to gryse. Than come forthe Caymys full stoute; To hym he spake wordis proute: âTraytour,â he sayd, âpou dydist dishonour, Whan thou brakkist Ã¾e quenys boure And toke hyr mayden and my stede: Agayne to courte I will Ã¾e lede. Aryse, traytour, I byd the, To court Ã¾ou shalt agayne with me!â Ipomydon hym answerd now: âTo courte I darre as wele as thou, But for the torne I nylle, Not, bot at myne owne wille. For his loue, Ã¾at vs dere bought, Sithe I haue haste, lette me noght!â Caymys than gan to hym sayne: âWilthow, nyllthow, Ã¾ou shalt agayne, Or right here Ã¾ou shalte abyde!â Ipomydon sterte vp that tyde, Anone he worthyd vppon his stede, They rode to gedyr with good spede; Ipomydon vnhorsyd Caymys tho, That his arme braste in two. He bad hys men, take his stede And lette a wors hors hym lede; In his sadille Ã¾ey sette hym bakwarde And bound hym faste with a cord: To the tayle was turnyd his visage, They bad hym lerne a new vsage. Thus Caymys rode toward Ã¾e towne, Whan he had lost all his renowne; His hors hyeth hym, homeward to fare, The master also with moche care; His hors to Ã¾e courte hym broght. The kynge euyr on Caymys thoght And sayd, he wold not go to bedde, Tille he wiste, how Ã¾e knyght spedde. The hors broght Caymys to Ã¾e yate, The porter lette hym in there atte; Jason the hors in gan brynge And ledde the knyght byfore Ã¾e kynge; The kynge askyd, by goddis payne, Iff he had brought the knyght agayne. Anone he answerd to the kynge And tolde hym hys myslykynge: âThoughe all Ã¾e knyghtis in the halle Come to hym, bothe grete and smalle, He wold of theyme yiff no thynge, But if it were of you, syr kynge!â Than they loughe all in same And at his harme had good game; There was none in that place, But they were glad of Ã¾at case. Thus Caymys hathe his seruyce quytte, And of Ipomydon here is a fytte. Ipomydon held forthe his way, Full glad he was of his jorney; He saw grete folke agayn hym ryde, The whiche had sought hym wondir-wyde, For to brynge hym new tidynge, That dede was his fadir, the kynge, Of whiche tithyngis he was wo, But he may not agayne god do. Throughe his lond he went rydynge; All they honoryd hym as kynge, And whan he come in to Ã¾at stede, That the kynge, his fadyr, was dede, Throghe that land he lette crye, That all men shuld thedir hye, Prestis and klerkis of euery towne, Byschoppis, erlys and barowne. There he made an entyrement With many messes, with good entente. An ersbyschope beryed his fadir dere, Prechynge there was of many a frere; Pore men, Ã¾at sat vppon Ã¾e ground, Were delyd of many a pownde. A grete feste there was dight For erlys and for many a knyght; All men, Ã¾at wold there of take, Had mete there for goddis sake. Whan this feste was brokyn vp, Euery man his leve tuke And went hyr way, as I you telle; Ipomydon thoght, at home to dwelle. His modir and he dwellyd in same With moche myrthe, joye and game, Tille it befelle vppon a day, The quene to hyr sonne gan saye In pryuyte and in counsaylle: âThou hast a brother, with outen fayle, Preuely goten was me vppon, Or I was weddyd to any man; But hastely he was done fro me; I note, yf he a lyffe bee, But he me sent Ã¾is endyr yere A riche rynge of gold full clere: And euyr he any brother had, I shuld yeffe it hym, he bad, Ãat, where he come amonge hye or lowe, By that rynge he shuld hym knowe. Take thys rynge, my sonne, of me: In what contre that he bee, Who that knowith this ylk rynge, He ys thy brothyr, with oute lesynge!â The rynge he toke of his modyr And trustid wele, to know his brothir. Thus they partid in Ã¾at place, But aftir with in a shorte space To hym come his baronage, That were men of grete parage; There entente is, to crowne hym kynge, But his thoght was on other thynge, For crowne wold he none bere; He wold be more assayed ere In othir londis, ferre and nere, Of his strenghe and his powere. He had an eme, was stiffe and stronge, Of myddille age, to lyve longe; Sir Pers of Poyle was his name, Men he distroyed, that dyd shame. Byfore his baronage, I vndirstand, Ipomydon sesyd hym in his lande And yaffe hym the profyte for his sake, Tylle Ã¾at he the crowne wold take. Turne we now all the matere And speke we of Calabre the eyre! A duke dwellythe Calabre be syde, A stoute man and of grete pryde: He was myghty and of grete powere, Men dred him, bothe ferre and nere; His name was duke Geron, Of Sesseny-lond he was baron. This doughty duke herd saye, The eyre of Calabre was suche a may; Messengeris he sent anon, Vnto Calabre for to gone; He sayd, he wold haue hyr to wyffe, If she wold, with outen stryffe: âAnd in case she wold not soo, I shall make hyr moche woo; For I shall distroye hyr landis alle, Hyr men sle, bothe grete and smalle, Hyr castelle breke and hyr toure, With strenghe take hyr in hyr boure, Lesse than she may fynde a knyght, That for hyr loue with me darre fight!â Forthe went the messyngere And told Ã¾e lady this matere; The lady answerd ryght sone And sayd, she wold neuyr haue none, âBut hym, Ã¾at me wanne, so god me saffe, Othyr husband wille I none haue!â This messyngere his erand gan sayne And homeward he went agayne; He tolde the duke of his answere And anone he bygan grete werre, For grete power gadryd he, To wynne Ã¾is mayde, Ã¾at was so free. Ipomydon his messyngere herde, Of this tithyngis how it ferde; To his master he went sone And told hym bothe all and somme. Whan he that herde, Ipomydon, Than was he a sory mon, That he ne myght with that duke fight, The whiche was holden so noble a knyght; Right vnsemely on queynte manere He hym dight, as ye shalle here: A barbor he callyd, with outen more, And shove hym bothe byhynd &amp; byfore, Queyntly endentyd oute and in, And also he shove halfe his chynne; He semyd a fole, Ã¾at queynt syre, Bothe by hede and by atyre. Armure he toke, Ã¾at was rusty, And horsyd hym on an old rouncy; An helme, as blak as any Ã¾anne, A crokyd spere he toke hym than. Whan Ã¾at he was thus dight, He semyd ylle a doughty knyght; To Sesseyn he went, as ye may here, Vnto the kynge Mellyagere And in his halle brak his spere, Ryght as he wode were, The tronchoune felle vppon Ã¾e bord; He faryd, as he had bene wode. The kynge and quene laughed light And sayd, he was a fole welle dight: âFole, go to mete!â Ã¾e kyng gan say; The fole answerd and sayd: âNay! For yit I wille not ete with the, But thou a bone will grant mee: The fryste dede of armys I wille haue, Ãat any man of Ã¾e wille craue!â âFole, go to mete!â sayd Ã¾e kynge, âI grant the thyne askynge!â The fole yede to mete in hye And tyed his hors fast hym bye, But, or he rose fro Ã¾e borde, Many men laughyd at his word. In to Ã¾e halle come rydynge a may, Oute of Calabre, sothe to say, On a white mule byfore Ã¾e kynge, A dwerffe with hyr come rydynge. âSir kyng, my lady gretis wele the And prayeth the for charyte, To helpe hyr in this mystere Agayne the dukis powere: He hathe distoyed hyr landis alle Right vnto hyr castelle walle, And bot if she haue helpe of the, She wille leue hyr landis &amp; flee!â The kynge answeryd anone And sayd: âAll my knyghtes ar gone, Campanus and other full bolde; Helpe my cosyn fayne I wolde, But they be all at a dede, To helpe a lady oute of drede; In this world wote I no knyght, That durst his one with hym fyght.â Vp sterte the fole anone, To the kynge he sayd full sone: âLoo, I am here all redy dight, That darre with hym allone fighte!â âSitte downe, fole!â the mayd gan saye, âVs list to speke of no pleye: Dryve thy folye, where thow wille, For no joye haue I there tille!â The fole sayd: âBe Ã¾ou wrothe or glad, Suche promyse of the kynge I had, That I shuld haue Ã¾e fryst dede!â The mayde turnyd and forthe yede. The fole stert vp with oute delaye And sayd: âSyr kynge, haue good day!â He lepyd on his hors there And sayd: âFare welle and haue gode yere!â Somme sayd, he was a fole welle dight, Somme sayd, he semyd a knyght, That is come fro ferre contre, By cause he wald not knowyn be. He prekyd his hors wondir-faste, The mayde he saw at the laste. As they rode by the way, The mayde to the dwerfe gan saye: âVndo my tente and sette it faste, For here a while y wille me ryste!â Mete and drynke bothe they had, That was fro home with them lad; Bothe they dranke there of and ete, But euyr the fole with oute sete; One morselle they nold hym caste, Thoughe he shuld for hungre brest; Ãe dwerfe sayd: âWe ar to blame: Yiff Ã¾e fole somme mete for shame!â âNot one morselle!â she gan say, âFor hungre shall dryue hym away!â With that there come rydyng a knyght To hyr tente anone ryght: âCome forthe with me!â to hyr he bed, âI haue the spyed, sythe Ã¾ou oute yede: Thou arte my lemman, as I haue thoght!â The fole sayd: âÃat leve I noghte: She ys myne, I wille hyr haue, Fro the I hope hyr wele to saue!â The knyght sayd: âFole, leve thy folye, Or ellis Ã¾ou shalt dere abye!â The fole sterte to a tronchoune, Ãat bare vp the maydens pavilloun, And smote the knyght on the crowne, That sterke-dede he felle to ground. He yaffe the dwerffe Ã¾e knyghtes gere, To hym selfe he toke the spere. Vp they rose and forthe yede, Till efte to ryste they had nede; They toke mete &amp; made them glad, To Ã¾e mayd the dwerf bad: âYif the fole somme mete for shame: He hathe sauyd you fro blame, And thynke, ye shuld haue be shent, Had he be oute of youre present!â The mayde answeryd hym anone: âByfore god, mete getteth he none: It was but foly, I prayse it noght, I wold, he were fro vs broght!â With that there come another knyght, The mayd he chalengid anone ryght And sayd: âCome forth, my leman dere!â The fole sayd: âÃou haste none here: She is myne, and longe hathe bene!â With that Ã¾e knyght bygan to tene And sayd: âFole, thou shalt abye, Yff Ã¾ou speke more of Ã¾is folye!â The fole sayd: âI will not blynne: If thou hyr haue, Ã¾ou shalt hyr wynne!â With that he lepte on his hors lyght, And eyther to other ganne hem dight; The fole hym metithe with a spere, That throughe the body he ganne hym bere; The knyght was dede throughe Ã¾at dede, To the dwerffe he yaff his stede. Forthe they buskyd hem anone, To a place they thought to gone, There they wold haue bene al nyght; Ãey myght no ferther for lak of light; They toke them mete and drynke gode spede, Vnnethe they wold Ã¾e fole any bede. Right as they satte and made hem glad, There come a knyght, as Ã¾e deville hym bad; He was the dukis brother Geron, All was blak, Ã¾at he had on, Bothe his hors &amp; his wede; To Ã¾e mayde he gan hym spede And sayd: âSythe I fynd you here, Ye shall be my leman dere!â The fole sayd: âNay, not so: Anothir she hathe tane hyr too: That am I, that Ã¾ou seest here: If thou hyr bye, she is to dere!â âFole,â he sayd, âpou bourdist grete: With my spere I shall the bete! Hyr tyme foule had she spedde, If she shold lye with Ã¾e in bedde.â The fole sayd: âTwyse I hir bought: With thy chydynge Ã¾ou gettest hyr noght. Iff thou hyr haue, Ã¾ou shalt hyr bye A peny derrere, Ã¾an euer dyd I!â There was no lenger to abyde, But eyther of theym to othyr gan ryde; The fole mette Ã¾e knyght soo, That his bak braste on twoo; With that stroke he hym sloughe And his armure of he droughe; Anone he toke Ã¾e knyghtis stede And armyd hym in his wede. Whan the fole was wele dight, The mayde he semyd a godely knyght, And trowyd wele, fole was he none, By the dedis, Ã¾at he had done. They layde hem downe, to take hyr reste; The dwerf fulle sone slepyd faste, But the mayde wakynge laye And on the fole thynkith ay; She demyd, he was a doughty knyght, Wherefore to hym she gan hyr dight: âSir knyght,â she sayd, âslepe ye nowe? Ye ar no fole, Ã¾at wele I knowe: Ye be a knyght, doughty of hand, I know none suche in all Ã¾is land, And Ã¾e same knyght, so trow I, Ãat somme tyme wanne my lady, I trow full wele, Ã¾at thou be he: Wilt thou hyr leve and wed me?

Whan she saw, it wold not be, âSir knyght,â she sayd, âfor charyte, Trowest thou, Ã¾ou shalt not fayle, To helpe my lady in Ã¾is batayle And with the duke Geron to fyght, As Ã¾ou kynge Melliager hight? What shall I to my lady say, Whethyr will ye come or nay?â âTo morow, whan I Ã¾e duke see, Par auntur in suche plyte I may bee, That I wille the bataille take, And so it may falle, I wille it forsake, For I am holdyn no thynge you tille, Noght but at myne owne wille!â The mayden turnyd homeward &amp; thoght, To his answere she coude sey noght; She bad Ã¾e knyght haue good day, And he bad: âFare wele, fayre maye!â In at a preuy posterne gate By nyght she stale in there ate, And to Ã¾e lady she told sone, What the fole had for hyr done, And that he comythe for hyr to fight. This lady was a sorowfull wight, For on the morow Ã¾e duke with pryde Vnto the castelle gate gan ryde, But they were stokyn hym agayne; With lowde voyse he gan to sayne: âCome owte, leman, on feyre manere: I wille no lenger tarye here, Or ellys a knyght ye oute sende, With me to fight, you to deffende!â And as he stode Ã¾us talkynge, He saw a knyght come rydynge; A glad man tho was he, His brothir, he wende, it had be: It was not he, as ye shall here, He answerid Ã¾e duke on this manere: âWhat art thou, that makist Ã¾is crye And at this gate so grete mastrye?â âI am,â he sayd, âlord of here inne, For I am sekir, Ã¾is mayde to wynne, And will so do, or I hens will gone, That othir husband gettyth she none!â Ipomydon saide: âÃat thou shalt mysse, For all myne owne that lady ys, And full longe she hathe be soo, There fore I rede the hens goo: I wille hyr deffend frome all men!â The duke answerd bitterly then: âTraytour,â he sayd, âpou art anothir; I wende, thou haddist bene my brothir: His stede thou hast, his armour, loo, Thow hast hym slayne, I trow, also!â âThat I hym slow, I gaynesay noght: The so to serue haue I thoght!â With that word, with oute lye, Fast to gedir gan they hye, That there sperys all tobrast; They drowghe swerdis and faught faste. The lady lay in an hye toure And saw bytwene theym all Ã¾e stoure, But she ne wist, whiche for hyr did fight, For they in lyke wede were dight. Gretter bataille myght none be, For neyther wold for othyr flee; They faught to gedyr wondir-longe, Ãe bataille was bothe stiff &amp; stronge, That of there lyves neyther rought. Ipomydon than hym bythoght, He was in poynte, to lese there, That he had bought wondir-dere; Hys swerd in bothe handis he toke, It was sharpe, as saythe Ã¾e boke, And hertely he dyd it vp lyfte, Amyd the crowne he yaff hym swifte, Thrughe helme &amp; bassenet it raught, Hys crowne was shavyn at one draught. The duke felt hym hurt full sore, He prayed Ã¾e knyght, to smyte no more: âI am nye dede, I may not stande, I yelde me here vnto thyn hande And shall be thyne owne knyght, At thy wille bothe day &amp; nyght; I shall restore in to this lande More good, Ã¾an euyr I here fonde, And euyr more, while Ã¾at I lyve, A thousand pownd I wille Ã¾e yiffe!â Ipomydon sayd: âI grant Ã¾e here, So Ã¾at thou do on this manere, Thow come not nye this pavilloun, But hye the faste oute of Ã¾is town!â The duke hym grantyd hastely, Oute of the towne for to hye. He and all, Ã¾at with hym come, Homeward they hyed hem full sone. Ipomydon rode to Ã¾e pavillon, Right as it were duke Geron. Be syde Ã¾e castelle, where in was Ã¾e eyre, Rennethe a ryuer longe &amp; feyre With shippis &amp; sayles many folde; There stremes were of fyne golde. This lady sayd, she wold flee, Iff that the duke wan Ã¾e gre. These shippis where stuffyd with vytayle, Ãat with this lady sholde sayle; She lokyd oute in to the towne And saw one come to Ã¾e pavilloun; She wende, Ã¾e duke had wonne Ã¾e gre, Where fore she busked hyr to flee. Ipomydon to Ã¾e yates wente, Than the lady helde hyr self shent: âCome forthe,â he sayd, âmy leman dere, For I haue wonne Ã¾e now here!â The lady herde hym make suche crye, To hyr shyppe she gan hyr hye; They plukkyd vp sayles &amp; forthe Ã¾ey passe, She &amp; hyr men, bothe more &amp; lasse. Turne we now anone ryghtes And speke of kyng Melliagere knyghtes, That, whan hyr jorney was done, They hem buskyd home full sone, Campanus and his felows full bolde, But the tydynges were hem tolde Off Ã¾e eyre of Calabre, Ã¾e fayre may, And of Ã¾e duke, as I you say, And how she sent aftir sokoure The preuyest mayden in hyr boure, And how a fole hathe take on hond, To fight with hym in Ã¾at londe. Sir Campanus buskid hym to fare, To bryng this lady oute of care, And all the power, Ã¾at had Ã¾e kynge, Buskyd theyme to Ã¾at fyghtynge, In all the hast, Ã¾at they myght, With the duke for to fight. Toward Calabre as they rode, Ãey saw shippis in Ã¾e flode; Anoon they callyd to theyme there And askyd hem, of whens they were. The shippemen sayd: âOf Calabre-londe: A duke hathe wonne it with his hand; Here ys Ã¾e lady, as ye may see, She hathe forsake hyr owne contre.â Campanus prayd Ã¾e lady, to dwelle And somwhat of hyr greffe to telle. She herd, they were hyr eme knyghtes And tornyd ayeyne anon ryghtes And tolde the knyghtes all in hye Off Ã¾e duke, Ã¾at was so doughty, And how the fole had hym borne Off good poyntis there beforne, And how Ã¾e duke hathe hym slayne, â&amp; comyn ys to my yates agayne!â Campanus sayd anone ryght: âI darre ley, it was Ã¾e same knyght, Was comyn oute of hys owne londe, For he was doughty of his hand: Madame, I rede, we torne agayne, And we shall see, who is slayne, &amp; than we shalle Ã¾is dede awreke, Iff we haue grace, with hym to speke, That all Ã¾is land shall there of here, And ellys honge me be the swyre, But I his hede vnto you brynge!â All they grantyd, with oute lesynge. This lady turnyd hyr shippe anon And with sir Campanus forthe gan goon. When she come Ã¾e castelle nye, As ferre as euyr she myght see, In that place she wold abyde, Tille she wist, how it wold tyde. Campanus all his men lette calle And to Ã¾e castelle they went alle; They saw a knyght in blak atyre, They wend full wele, Ã¾e duke it were, Ãat had distroyed Ã¾e land aboute; To hym they hyed, all Ã¾e route. Campanus sayd in Ã¾is manere: âWhat art Ã¾ou, that standis here? Tell me, why Ã¾ou makist Ã¾is dynne And what Ã¾ou woldist haue here in!â He sayd: âMy leman, Ã¾at I wanne, I wille not leue hyr for no man!â Sir Campanus sayd: âÃou getist hyr noght; I rede, frome hyr thou change Ã¾i thoght And go home to thy contre, Or ellis, for sothe, Ã¾ou shalt dede be: Where fore hens fast thou hye With owte any more vylany, And ellis I swere, by god almyght, We shall all ageynst Ã¾e fight!â Ipomydon sayd: âWhat may this bee? Is this the maner of this contre? Yif any of yow haue better right, Than I haue, to Ã¾is lady bryght, Come forthe &amp; prove yt with your hand, One for one, while I may stand!â Campanus answerd to Ã¾e knyght: âChese, whether Ã¾ou wilt go or ellys fight!â Ipomydon sayd: âSythe it is soo, That I shall hyr thus forgoo, Rather I wille Ã¾e bataille take And lese my lyffe for hyr sake And put it all in goddis hond!â Agayne hem all he thoght to stond; All at ons at hym they layd, Ipomydon hys swerd oute brayd And many a man he fellys downe ryght; He faught with many a doughty knyght, That many a stroke vppon hym layd: âYeld the, traytour!â âNot yit!â he sayd. The knyghtes, that were of grete pryde, Faste they faught on yche syde; Ipomydon saw non othyr wone, But socouryd hym at a walle of stone, And they pursewyd aftir faste, Ãat many vnto Ã¾e dethe he caste. So longe ageynste them he gan stand, They hewyd the gloves of his hand; All bare-handyd faught Ã¾is knyght, They saw neuyr are non so wight. Sir Campanus, as I vndirstande, Saw the rynge on his hand, That he yaffe his modyr, Ã¾e quene: Many a yere are he ne had it sene. Campanus prayd hym stand stille, While he askyd hym a skyle. The knyght answerd &amp; bad hym sey, For all they were wery of there play; âSir knyght,â he sayd, âtelle me this thynge: Where had ye that ilke rynge?â Ipomydon answerd, as he thought, And sayd: âFor sothe, I stale it noght: For Ã¾ou coueytes, to haue Ã¾is rynge, I swere by Jesus, heuyn kynge, Or Ã¾ou it haue with mystrye, With sore strokis Ã¾ou shalt it bye!â Sir Campanus prayd hym with feyre chere, To telle hym on feyre manere, Where he had Ã¾at ylke rynge, And say the sothe, with oute lesynge. Ipomydon sayd: âSo god me spede, Y wille not telle Ã¾e for no drede! But telle me, why Ã¾ou doste enquere, And I shalle yeve the an answere!â âThis rynge,â he sayd, âÃ¾at is so fyne, For sothe, somme tyme it was myne: Now, as ye are a gentill man, Telle me, where ye Ã¾at rynge wanne!â âThe quene,â he sayd, âof Poyle-land Yaff me this rynge, ye shall vndirstand! She ys my modyr good and fayre, Off all Ã¾at land I am Ã¾e eyre.â âSir knyght,â he sayd, âyit abyde: What sayd she more to you Ã¾at tyde?â âShe sayd, I had a brother on lyve, Was gotyn, or Ã¾at she was wyffe, And sayd, who Ã¾at knew this rynge, Was my brother, with oute lesynge!â Sir Campanus sayd: âBy god allmyght, I am thy brother, Ã¾ou gentill knyght!â They felle downe bothe in Ã¾at stound, At onys fallynge to Ã¾e ground; Men caught hem vp &amp; wakyd hem bothe, They were full glad &amp; no thynge lothe. Ipomydon enqueryd of his brothyr, What was his name, for none knew othyr; He sayd: âSyr Campanus I hight, That gaynste Ã¾e dyd fyght, With kynge Melleager dwelle I!â âSom tyme we were in company: Knew ye nevyr the quenys lemman, That som tyme this mayd wan?â âA, brother,â he sayd, âbe ye he?â There was joye grete plente. Ipomydon sayd: âI bare Ã¾e shelde, That wanne Ã¾e lady in Ã¾e felde; Stedis I had Ã¾ere Ã¾at day in place, Ãe sothe ye know, Ã¾at it so was, Whyte and rede &amp; blak also: Wele ye wote, Ã¾at it was so. And there I wanne throw goddis grace The beste stedis Ã¾at day in place, Ãe kynges stede and thyne also, And of myne owne I sent you two, And youres I sent to other men: Ye wote wele, it was so then. I toke my leve of Ã¾e quene, With me went my mayden shene Home toward myne owne lond. Sir Caymes sayd, I vndirstand, That he wold feche vs bothe agayne, Or ellis Ã¾at he wold be slayne; He sayd, I went with oute leve: All ye wist, how it dyd preue; And therfore, brother, as I haue sayd, I am best worthy, to haue Ã¾e mayd!â They saw, it was Ã¾e same knyght; Ãan all there hertes began to light. Euere as they went, they gan hym kysse, There was joye and moche blisse. Messengeris afore gan thrynge, To bryng Ã¾e lady good tythynge; When she saw, Ã¾ey come so fast, Than Ã¾e lady was agast, She wende, Ã¾ey had scomfyted be; Ãis lady bad, draw sayle &amp; flee. The messyngers cryed, as Ã¾ey were wode, Whan they saw hyr go with Ã¾e flode, They sayd: âMadame, drede you noght: The strange squyer hathe you sought!â Whan she herd of hym speke, She thought, hyr hert wold tobreke, But she myght se hym with syght, That hyr wanne in grete fight. They tornyd Ã¾e shippis to Ã¾e land, To gedyr they mette at Ã¾e sond. Whan Ã¾e lady of hym had syght, She comaundyd a bote forthe ryght, For at Ã¾e lond fayne wold she bee, That she myght Ã¾e knyght see. She lepyd oute of Ã¾e bote in hye In to Ã¾e water, Ã¾e knyght stode bye, And he in aftir also faste, Ãat vp he gatte hyr at Ã¾e last. Whan Ã¾ey come vnto Ã¾e lond, Ipomydon toke hyr by Ã¾e hond And told hyr Ã¾ere, with outen fayle, Hyr love had causyd hym grete travaile: âSythe fryst Ã¾at I with you dyd dwelle, Half my sorow can I not telle, And how ye blamyd your cosyn Jason For Ã¾at I loked you vppon, And fro I toke my leve and went, Tille I herd of youre entente, How Ã¾at ye wold haue a knyght, That of his hand was most wight; Thedyr I drew, when I it herde, All ye wote, how Ã¾at it ferd: I seruyd your eme longe with alle, The quenys lemman Ã¾ey dyd me calle; And aftir I justed dayes thre, Many men ther dyd I see, And there I wan stedis good, Somme were rede as any blode, And also wisely god me amend, The kyngis stede to you I send; But sone after, I vndirstand, I went in to myn owne lond, Tille I herd vppon a day Of Ã¾e duke, Ã¾at made outray; I busked me in queynt manere, Right as I a fole were, And went ageyne to Ã¾e kynge: He knew me not, for no thynge; And thedyr come frome you a mayd, And to Ã¾e kynge Ã¾ese wordis she sayd, That he muste you socoure sende, Fro Ã¾e duke you to deffend; But Ã¾e kyng you of help forsoke And I the bataile to me toke; Forthe with Ã¾e mayd gan I gone And there I kepte hyr frome hyr fone; Thre knyghtes of hyr lyffes I lete, And now Ã¾e duke I haue scomfyte: I darre wele say, by goddis sond, I haue you wonne with my hond!â Whan Ã¾e lady herd, how it was, She felle on swounyng in Ã¾e place; He toke hyr vp with good spede, His mouthe to hyrs he gan bede, They kyssyd to gedyr with good chere, For eyther was to othyr dere. I lette you wete, with oute delay, Halfe there joye I can not say. Forthe they went to Ã¾e castelle, There this lady byfore dyd dwelle; All that nyght they were in same With moche myrthe, joy and game. On the morow the clerkis were bowne, To wryte lettres of grete renowne To the kynge of Seseny-lond, That was hyr eme, I vndyrstand; To Ã¾e emperoure, I dare wele say, Were wrytte lettres of grete nobley, To ershebisshoppes &amp; bysshopis of Ã¾e land: Prestes &amp; clerkis, Ã¾at were at hand, Dukis, erlys and barons also, Knyghtis and squyers shuld thedyr go. Messyngeris were sent euery where, For pore and ryche, all shold be there; And whan these lordis tythyngis herd, They hyed hem fast thedyrward. Ãis fest was cryed longe byfore, Fourty dayes it shold laste, with oute more; Metis were made grete plente, For many a man Ã¾ere shuld bee; With the emperoure come to Ã¾e feste An hundreth knyghtes at Ã¾e lest, And with the kynge, hyr eme, also Two hundreth hors, with oute mo; Sir Piers of Poyle thedyr came And with hym knyghtes of grete fame, That doughty were, of Ã¾at land, In bataile preuyd, I vndirstand. On the morow, whan it was day, Thay busked theyme, as I you say, Toward Ã¾e chirche with game &amp; glee, To make Ã¾at grete solempnyte; The archebisshopp of Ã¾at land Weddyd theyme, I vndirstand. Whan it was done, as I you say, Home they went with oute delay. By Ã¾at they come to Ã¾e castelle, There mete was redy euery dele; Trumpes to mete gan blow tho, Claryons &amp; other menstrellis mo; Ão they wasshe and yede to mete, And euery lord toke his sete; Whan they were sette, all Ã¾e route, Menstrellis blew than all aboute, Tille they were seruyd with pryde Of the fryst cours Ã¾at tyde; The seruyce was of grete aray, That they were seruyd with Ã¾at day. Ãus they ete and made hem glad With suche seruyce, as they had. Whan they had dyned, as I you say, Lordis and ladyes yede to play, Somme to tablis &amp; somme to chesse, With othir gammys, more and lesse. Ipomydon gaff in Ã¾at stound To mynstrellis V C. pound, And othyr yiftes of grete nobley He yaff to other men Ã¾at day. Thus this fest, as it was told, Fourty dayes it was hold. Ipomydon his brother lette calle, There he stode in the halle, And yaff hym all Poyle-land, But on erledom, I vnderstond, And of that land made hym kyng, And afftyr hym hys offspryng. He thankyd god and hym with mode, And euery man spak of hym good. Syr Camppanus forthe ys gon on sond To the kyng of Sesanay-lond, There he was in hys chamber, Talkyng with the ladyes on fere. He told of the yefftes fayre, Off Poyle-land how he was eyre; The ladyes answerd all on one: âSouche a man in the world ys non!â Ipomadon, there he stod in hall, Tholomew he lette to hym call And yaff hym an erledom fre And a mayde, hys leff to bee, That was with hym in Pole-lond, With the quene, I vnderstond. Syr Tholomew tho gan say: âI thanke yow, lord, for thys may And for yowre yefftes many on, That ye hawe yewen me here befforne!â Tho passyd he forthe, as I yow say, There he lyked best to play. Ipomadon, in hall there he stod, Bethowght hym of myld mode. Of hys felaw, syr Jason, How he was a worthy mon; To hym he gaff bothe ferre &amp; nere Grete londes, as ye may here, To hys wyff a fayre may, That he had louyd many a day, And other yiftes he yaff also Tille other men many moo. Whan this feste was comyn to Ã¾e end, Euery man busked hem, home to wend. On the morow, with oute lesynge, The emperoure went vnto Ã¾e kynge, His leve to take, gan he gone, And with hym lordis many on; At Ã¾e takynge of his leve Halfe Ã¾e joye I can not discryve, That there was hem amonge Off ladies and of knyghtis stronge. The emperoure his leve hathe tone At Ã¾e kynge Ipomydon And at Ã¾e quene fayre and free, So dyd many mo than hee. Thus the lordes fayre &amp; hend Homeward all Ã¾ey gan to wend, Euery lord to his contre Or where them lyked best to be, And lefte them there bothe in same With myche myrthe, joye and game, There to dwelle for euyr more, Tille theyme departyd dethe sore. Ipomydon and his lady dere To gedyr were many yere With all joye, Ã¾at men myght see; In world so moche neuer myght be, As was euere Ã¾em amonge, Till dethe Ã¾em departid, Ã¾at was stronge. And whan they dyed, I trow, iwis, Bothe they yede to heuyn blysse, There as non other thynge may bee, But joye and blisse, game &amp; glee: To Ã¾at blysse god bryng vs alle, That dyed on rode for grete &amp; smalle! Amen. Explicit Ipomydon.</field>
