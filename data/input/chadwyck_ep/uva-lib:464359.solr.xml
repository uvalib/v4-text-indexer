      <field name="fulltext">The prouerbes of Salomon, translated into Englyshe metre. [The wysdom of the Lord our God] Argumentum. Cha. i. The wysdom of the Lord our God, doth call vpon vs styll That we fle farre from wycked men, and folow not their wyll. My sonne thy father harke vnto &amp; to his lore enclyne Forsake thou not thy mothers law but sure let it be thyne For that shal cause grace plentifull, to lyght vpon thyne heade And on the necke shalbe a chayne, and stande the in good steade Therfore (my s?ne) take thou good hede wh? sinners do the tempte For though that they do the entyce, to them do not consente Yf they shall saye, come thou w? vs, let vs laye wayte for bloude And causeles kyll the innocent, and spoyle them of their good. Let vs them swallow quycke and hole let vs deuoure them al: As those that slyde into a pyt, so shall they take their fall. And we shal costely ryches fynde, to do therwyth our wyll: And w? the spoyles that we shal get we may our houses fyll. Cast in thy lotte amonge vs now, a man yf that thou arte: And th? we wyl haue all one purse, and thou shalte haue thy part. But walk thou not w? th? (my s?ne) theyr pathes do thou refrayne: Their fete are hasty bloude to shede al yll they do retayne. But al in vayne the nette is layde, before the byrdes eyes: Yet one an others bloude to spyl, much yll they do deuise. And thei th?selues their own deare bloud this way do hurt and noye: And theyr owne soules do quite depriue of al eternal ioye. This is the way of gredy men and thys is al theyr feate: For to beryue his brothers lyfe: his ryches for to gette Without therfore doth wysd? cal, &amp; putteth forth her voyce Behold for in the open streates, to you she maketh noyse She calleth before the multytude, that al men may her know And in the towne gates openly, her wordes she doth nowe shewe Oh folysh men and fonde saith she, how longe wyl ye delyte In folysshe schole? and ye vnwyse, to wysdom beare suche spyte Oh turne to my correction, I wyl my mynde expresse And I wyll make you vnderstand, my wordes both more and lesse Sence then that I haue called you, and ye refuse my name And haue put forth mine hand also, and ye forsake the same And al my counsels ye haue hadde, in mockynge and despite And also my correction, haue set at naught and lyght Therfore wyll I laughe ioyfully, in your destruction And mock you whan the plage you feare shal iustly on you come And wh? that whych you feare so much ful sodaynly doeth fal And troubles and great heuines, shal come vpon yon all Th? when you do vpon me craue, I wyl not heare your minde Though you seke me, &amp; that earely yet shal you not me fynde And why? I say because that you, my knowledge so abhorde And cast away against my wyll, the feare of god the Lorde I sayd before they dyd refuse, my counsels euery one And dyd not cease, for to despyse, my good correction To eate the frute of their own way the lord shal them constrayne With the deuice he shal them fyll, of theyr insensate brayne And for the fal of the vnwyse, he shal them slaye anon And eke the wealth of foles shalbe, theyr owne confusyon But who to me that geueth eare, shal dwell safely I saye And haue ynough, &amp; nede not feare by nyght, nor yet by daye. [It is hete taughte that we shulde learne] Argumentum. Cha. ii. It is hete taughte that we shulde learne Gods wysdome to obtayne The wealth also that cometh therof Is here descrybed playne. My s?ne receiue y? these my wordes the which shalbe right wyse And kepe thou my c?ma?dementes, my sonne I the aduyse So that thine eares may euermore to wysdomes scholes encline Applye thyne harte to vnderstand, suche thinges as bee dyuyne For yf thou after wysedome crye, and styl vpon her craue And callest on for knowledge gift, because thou woldeste her haue And seke for her as thou woldest seke for mony in the dust And dygge for her as treasure that in earth is hydde and trust Th? shalt thou right wel vnderst?de the feare of god the Lord And of his law the knowledg find, accordyng to hys worde For god alone doeth geue to vs, his wysdom for to speake Out of his mouth doth knowledg spring and vnderst?ding eke The rightuous m? he doth preserue in welfare through hys myghte. He doth defende the innocent, that walke his way aryght He doth th? kepe straight in his pathes that they go not astraye He doth directe hys holy ones, to walke ryght in his waye Yf thou be soch, thou shalt th? lerne by iustice for to deale With euery man in equitye, throughout the comen weale In iudgemet right thou shalt lykewise al other men excel And euery good path vnto the, the lord shal shewe ful well Yf wysdom enter into thyne harte, and knowledge in thy spirite Th? vnderstandyng good counsel, shal the preserue vpryght That thou mayst so deliuered be from euery wycked way And fr? those m? that froward th?ges do alwayes speake &amp; saye The which do leue the wai of light and walke in darkenes styll And whych reioyce most iocundly, when they haue done full yll Whych do delyte in wyckednes, whose wayes are vyle &amp; vaine Whose croked pathes are scla?derous fr? them do thou refraine That also from the stra?ge woman delyuered thou mayste be And from her eke that is not thyne, or was not wedde to the Which speaketh faire, &amp; doth forsake the husb?d of her youth And doth forget the c?naunt made, of God and of hys trouth. Take hede, her house enclineth fast to death, as I the tell Her pathes ar sure the ready way, that leadeth downe to hell And they also that go to her, shal not come oute againe Nor take hold of the waye of lyfe, I tel the thys is playne That thou mayst walke in the sure waye wherof I do the tel And kepe the pathes of ryghtuousnes th? shalt thou do ryght wel For why? thee iuste shall euer lyue, in ioye that dothe not cease The innocente remayne on earthe in wealth, and eke in peace But the vngodly shalbe pluct, out of the lande I saye And wicked men chased shalbe, out of the same for aye. [Sure trust in God ought all men to haue] Argumentum. Cha. iii. Sure trust in God ought all men to haue and not in theyr owne brayne The wycked man thou shalte not feare, ne yet the skorner vayne. My s?ne, forget not thou my law but haue it styl in syghte And let thine hart obserue my wordes so shalt thou walke aryght For sure they shal prol?g thy dayes thy yeres, and lyfe also And bryng the peace and quietnes, and rydde the out of wo Let mercy nor yet faythfulnes, henceforth from the departe Bind th? about thy necke (my s?ne) and write them in thyne harte And so shalt thou great fauor win, of god and eke of men In vnderstandyng perfectlye, expert thou shalt be then With al thine hart to god the lord put confidence and trust And leaue thou not in anye wyse, to thyne owne wyt and luste In al thy wayes haue thou respect vnto the lyuing lorde He shal thy doinges order wel accordinge to his worde Be not to wise in thy conceite, but feare god in thine harte In hast also from wickednes, endeuoure to departe So shal thy nauyl styll (my sonne) continue hole and sounde Thy bones also and bodye shall, wyth lyuely strength abound Honour the lorde, and to hym geue the best of thy substaunce And the fyrst frutes of thine encrease hys glory to aduaunce So shal thy barnes be fylled ful, and that wyth plentuousnes Thy presses all shal ouerflowe, wyth wyne of great swetenes The bitter scorge of God the Lord, (my sonne) do not despyse And when thou art rebukte of hym, faynt not in any wyse For loke wh? y? the lorde doth loue, hys rodde shall on hym lyght Eu? as the father whypes his s?ne, to know hym self a ryght Yet doth the Lorde neuertheles, loue hys afflicted styll Euen as the father doth hys chylde, when he hath bete hys fyll Full well is he therfore I saye, the which doth wysdom fynde And vnderstanding to obteyne, doth sette hys harte and mynde For marcha?dice ther is none soch, through out the worlde so rounde There is no syluer nor yet golde, wherin soch welth is founde More worth th? al the gold on erth let wysdom be to the To hyr al thynge thou canst desyre, compared maye not be. On her ryght hand attendaunt is longe lyfe, wyth coloure grene And honour st?des on her left hand, wyth ryches well besene Her wayes also right pleasaunt are whych pleasure doth not cease Her pathes lykewyse ar nothing els but vnitie and peace She is a tree of lyfe to them, that laye holde on her ryght And blessed ar thei that kepe her fast wyth all theyr power and myght In wysdom eke the lyuinge Lorde ful wel the earth dyd founde And w? his worde y? heau?s he made the earth to compasse rounde And through the wysd? of the lord the waters brake vp al The cloudes also power downe the rayne that on the erth doth fal My son, let not these thinges depart at no tyme from thyne eyes But kepe my lawe and counsels all, by the in any wyse So shall it be eternall lyfe, thy soule for to embrace Thy mouth shall be replenished wyth vertue and wyth grace Th? shalte y? be right sure to walke full boldely in the waye Thy fete shall neuer slyppe from the by nyght, nor yet by daye Yf thou doest slepe at any tyme thou nedest not be afrayed But swetely slepe, and take thy rest, for god wyl be thyne ayde And thoughe that the vngodly men, rushe in with vyolence Thou shalt nor be afrayed at all, for God is thy defence The Lord wyl st?d fast by thy syde, and helpe the at thy nede And kepe the safe, and suffer not, thyne enemyes to procede And soche as woulde to other men, do good wyth all theyr harte And haue therto sufficient, to lette is not thy parte And yf thy selfe thou able be, thy neyghbour to releue Helpe him w? soch as thou maist spare, and gladly to him geue Refuse not to do good to them, to whom it dothe belonge Whyle that thy ryght hand able is, to do it them amonge And yf thy frende do aske of the, saye not, gette thou thy waye To morowe come agayne to me, or els some other daye And th? wil I geue it y?

[It is oure duety bound] Laudate pueri domi. psalm. cxii. It is oure duety bound, as in this psalme is found. To prayse the lyuyng lord, and in that lorde of myghte. To set oure hole delyght and in his holy word. O prayse you now the lord, and that withe one accorde, ye seruauntes do the same, and se that euermore, ye serue hym wel therfore, for blessed is his name. The Lordes name to prayse, we are worthy alwayes, Euen from the rysinge tyme, of the sunne fayre and brighte, Untyll it be in syghte, that downe she doeth incline. The Lorde is hye of myghte, ther is no maner of wyght, That can wyth hym compare, hys glorye certaynely, Aboue the heauens hye, remayneth in lyke manere. Who is lyke vnto hym, that wyl presume to clym, The whych so hye doeth dwell, the Lorde that is so meke, Whych doeth behold to kepe, both heauen and earth full well. Whych doeth the symple take, oute of the myry lake, And lyfteth them vp agayne, he taketh out of the dust, All that in hym doeth truste, And ryddeth them of theyr payne. So that he maye hym sette, among the princes great, By hys great power and myght, the princes all amonge, That ruleth all the thronge, of people daye and nyght. The whyche doeth make also, the woman full of wo, That baren longe hathe bene, A mother full of blys, And kepeth an house ywys, her chyldren maye be sene.
