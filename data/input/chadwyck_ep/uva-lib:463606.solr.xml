      <field name="fulltext">Dignum laude virum Musa vetat mori; Carmen amat quisquis, Carmine digna facit. HORAT. To the Right Honorable WILLIAM EARL of STRAFFORD, &amp;c. Out of the Satyr of Petronius Arbiter, pag 48. Now conquering Rome did all the world controle, From East to West from one to th'other pole: Yet was not satisfied. The plough'd-up Sea With brazen keels, was made her commom way. If any nook were hid, if any Land (Which yellow Gold afforded) lay beyand, It was a foe, and covetous anger seiz'd Whatever wealth. No vulgar pleasure pleas'd: No worn plebeian joy. The Soldiers disht Their meat in Silver: and (from Rivers fisht) The Purple of the Land rivall'd the Sea's. Here Lybian stones, there silks (the new disease) And their perfumed fields, Arabians fleece. Lo other spoils and wounds of injur'd Peace! In woods is sought the Mauritanian beast, And Affricks farthest Hammon hunted, least That Monster should be wanting, which is slain Because his tooth sells deare, instead of Graine. Armenian Tigers our Corn-fleets import, To be led stalking in a gilded Court: And quaffe (the people clapping) humane blood. I blush to speak, and broach Fates violent flood. In Persian guize (yeares ripening to their harm) They grub man up, and with a knife disarme The apt for Venus wars: and, whiles this checks Time's horse in his full speed, lost nature seeks And cannot find her self: so all approve Male Concubines, and which, like Geldings move Broke to a pace: Love-locks and Cloaths which speak All Countreys, and no man. Behold they break Numidian ground! a Citrian board comes out On painted Carpets plac'd, and round about A Troop of waiters stand: and, drown'd in wine, Upon the floore wallows an herd of Swine. A Tree which did a Patrimony cost, Fetcht (for the ruine of a Land) to boast A new Nobility, did counterfeit With spots the cheaper gold: On which were set By the Earth-rounding-Soldier (that now hurl'd His Arms aside) the spoyls of all the world. His throat had wit. A Terbot, that did dive In Corsick Seas, rose at his Board alive; There Oysters pull'd out of the Lucrine lake, Onely for Sawce to lure his hunger back. Now Phasian waves are of their birds bereft: And the dumb banks (save winds) have nothing left To sing amongst the widowed leaves. As dire Is the field's fury: The base Romans hire Their votes out for the chime, and touch of Gold: A venal people: venal Senate sold Favour: even Age let her free vertue fall, And right by bribes was just led to the wall? And Majesty lay flat, with gold sought out, Cato himself repuls'd was by the rout. He that o'recame more sad, who blusht to see That Cato should have fewer votes than he. For 'twas the people's, and the time's disgrace: 'Twas not a man, but virtue lost the place, And the old Roman honor: here then lyes Rome her own Merchant, and own merchandise: Besides now use on use, mens principals So swell'd, it overwhelm'd them. No man calls His house his own. None uningag'd: but debt Like to a lingering disease, doth fret Into their barking bowels, being pain'd They cry to Arms: and wealth with ryot drayn'd Must heal with wounds: safe Want sets on fire. Cast in this sleep, and rowling in this mire What reasons can make Rome, but war and blood? Which till th'are felt, are never understood. Fortune had rais'd three Captains, all which feel In several ways Enyo's mortal steel. In Asia Crassus; Affrick Pompey slain: Ungrateful Rome great Julius blood did stain And Earth, to poize her load by portions just, (Greatness found this respect) divides their dust. A wide-mouth'd vault descends to Hell's black-hall, 'Twixt great Dicarchis fields, and Naples wall, Lav'd with Cocytus streams, whence all the heath About is blasted with a Sulph'rous breath: Where Autumn is the mother of no fruits. Out of the Summers Turf no glad herb shoots, No tender sprigs, inspir'd by vernal songs, Are heard to warble with melodious tongues: But Chaos, and rocks sweating with black dew, Delight in Canopies of fatal hue. Here Pluto rose in funeral flames and smoke, And with these words light Fortune did provoke; Divine-and-humane-things-commanding-Power, Fortune, that likest no height that's too secure, That lov'st new things, and (gain'd) discard'st them straight, Shrink'st thou not yet beneath the Roman weight, Unable longer to support the Tower Of Romes recoyling Greatness? Their own Power The Roman youth abhor, nor bear the piles Of wealth they rais'd. See their vast Lux of spoyles, And riches curs'd into a punishment! They build in Gold, and to the Firmament Exalt their seats. Here Seas with stones expel, There let them in with Sluces, and rebel Against inverted Nature. Not I 'scape: The earth delv'd through for their wild Heaps doth gape; The Mountains shovell'd down: the caves now groan There, whilst for several uses they dig stone. Th'Infernal Ghosts are bid to hope for day: Then Fortune turn thy smiles to dreadful fray: Possess with rage the Roman breasts, and throng Our Realms with funerals. Methinks 'tis long Since these black jaws have been with Gore imbrew'd, Since my Tisiphone hath bath'd in blood Her thirsty limbs: since Sylla's sword was drunke, And horrid Earth nurs'd fruits from humane trunke. This said, and striving to give her his hand, With reaching up he brake the cleaving Land: Then Fortune thus from fickle bosome says, O Sire, whom all on that side Styx obeys, If without danger I the truth may tell, Thy wish is granted thee: nor to rebel Have I less mind then thou: or boyles thy womb With a less rage. All I bestow'd on Rome I hate, and am fallen out with my delight: The God that rais'd these walls, the same shall slight. The sweet of burning Towns, of sucking blood, Is by me also fully understood. I see Philippi with two Chiefs there slain: Thessalian tombs: and funerals of Spain. The clash of Arms now strikes my trembling eare: The groans of Libya: and her Nile I heare: And Actian waves: and Sol cry, on. Expand The thirsty Kingdoms of thy silent Land: And get more Furys help. A boat's too small For Charon to waft o're his souls withal: It asks a Fleet: and pale Tisiphone With the great ruine do thou gorged be: With ragged tushes chaw the tender wounds: The mangled world descend, to Stygian sounds: Scarce had she spoke, when (cleft with lightning sheen) Trembles a cloud, and darts squeez'd, fire between. The King of Shades into earth's bosome sunk: And from his Brother's thunder frighted, shrunk. Forthwith the fates of men, and ills to come Heaven shows by signes: for the deformed Sun. Veils with a mist his blushing face, as far From giving count'nance to a civil war. The Moon at full (to leave them groaping) pops Her light out too. The palsey'd Mountain-tops (Supported with weak necks) come thund ring down. Nor wand'ring Rivers run in channels known, To dye a natural death. Armies appeare In th' Ayre, and Trumpets (even in his own spheare) Alarum Mars. Now hotter Ætna burns, And thunderbolts for thunderbolts returns. Lo! 'Mongst the Tombs and disinterred bones, The Gastly shadows send up baleful groans! A blazing-Star draws an unusual train: And a new Jove descends in bloody rain: Heav'n soon these signes expounds: for Cæsar drove With his own speed, and sweet revenges love, Threw down the Gallick, Civil Arms took up. On cloudy Alps, where, winding to the top, The rocks made passable by Græcian hands, A Temple sacred to Alcides stands. 'Tis thatch'd with crusted Snow, and blends its gray Head to the Stars: how like the milky way! It thaws not with the Sun's Meridian rayes, Nor with the Spring's warm breath: but pav'd with lays Of Ice and feathered Rain, the Heaven it beares: For it both threatens and supports the spheares. When He (the Soldier glad) these cliffs did tread, And touch'd his wishes, from the Mountains head Stretching his voice, (the Latian fields survey'd) And both his hands to Heav'n, thus Cæsar said. All powerful Jove, and thou Saturnian Land Triumphant oft, safe always by my hand, Witness I come unwilling to this warre, Unwilling Clash: but such my proud wrongs are, Expuls'd my Country, whilst I paint with blood The Rhine, whilst I the Galls the Alps exclude, Threat'ning again the Capitoll. Exil'd Farther by conquering more: the Germanes foyl'd, And sixty triumphs are my crime. But who Denounce this war? Blind with our beams a crew Of trading Soules step-children to my Rome, But they (I think) shall know too upon whom Nor shall mechanick hands bind these with cords. Go mine: Go victors: plead the Cause with Swords. We all are in one fault: one shame threats all: You conquer'd too. If punishment must fall On them that beat, if this our triumph be, Let the Dye fall, and Fortune judge for me. Take up the war they throw you: try your force: If overcome, my case can be no worse. But arm'd, and with such men, that ne're can hap. This said, the Delphick bird her wings did clap, (An Omen good) and in a wood beside A Bay-tree crackling in strange fire was 'spy'd. Apollo's self shone brighter then he us'd, And had a golden glory circumfus'd. Stronger then Omens, Cæsar did advance, And with unwonted pace first snatch'd a Lance. First bound with ice, and candyed with the driffe The earth was quiet with dull horror stiffe: But when the Troops the clouds gives off, did take, And trembling horses the waves fetters brake, The heat snows melted; streight new rivers burst Out of the hills: these also streight were forc't To make a stand: whilst (lo) new ice appeares, And liquid late make work for Pioneers. Then first deceiv'd the feet the slipp'ry ground, And tript them up, Men, Arms, and whole Ranks, (round,) In heaps deplor'd? big clouds with tempest's stroke, Their burthens threw. Nor blasts with whirle-winds broke, Were wanting there, or vollyes of gross haile. The concrete raine fell ratling on the Mayle, Like showres of Arrows from a Parthian bow: The Earth was overcome with a deep snow: The Lamps of heaven o'recome; with Christal bit The Rivers overcome; Cæsar not yet: But leaning on his speare, that would not yield, With secure steps he brake the horrid field: As when Alcmena's son marched apace, Down Caucasus: or with an angry face When Jove descended the Olympian hill, With Giants blood Phlegrean plains to fill. 'Mean while swift Fame is born with frighted wings, And perching on the Capitol, sad things Tells the affrighted Romans: that the Maine Is swarm'd with ships: The Alps of a light flame With Troops, yet reeking with Sicambrian gore, Arms, Blood, Death, Fire, and War is drawn before Their eyes from head to foot: which makes them erre, And see their danger double through their feare. This flyes by land, this by, and that to Sea, So for no land his native changes he. He's safest now, the Chance of war that tryes, And follows fates instinct: He farthest flyes Whose feare is longest winged: (A grief to say!) The people led by wild amazement, stray They know not whither: Rome delights in flight, And scar'd Quirites their sad mansions quite; At the bare rumour of approaching Arms, Those clasp with trembling hand their tender barnes: These in their bosomes hold their Houshould-Gods: And hurry from their desolate aboads: And in their prayers kill the absent Foe: There are that to their wives sad bosomes grow, And bedrid parents: youths impatient heat Takes onely her, on whom his soul is set. Some all, and to the war unwisely sweep The prey, for which 'tis made.— —As when the deep Is plough'd up by Northwinds, and her roul'd hills Are knock'd together: And the Seamen's skills Avail not now, one binds the splitting mast, Another to the quiet shore doth hast, A third to Sea and and Fortune trusts with all. What talk I of small things? the Generall With both the Consuls The great Pompey, He Terror of dire Hydaspes, and the Sea, The Pyrates rock, whom (thrice triumphing late) Jove trembled at, lest he should shake his state: Whom Pontus (having crush'd it's watry braves) And Bosphorus ador'd with crouching waves: (Oh shame) deserting the State's rudder, fled: That fickle Fortune might t'have seen be sed Ev'n Pompey's back. A flight authoriz'd so, Involv'd the Gods, and Heaven his back did show: See a mild troop of Gods (loathing the rage That regins in mortals) take a pilgrimage, From a damn'd crew of Earthlings: And first Peace (Beating her snowy Arms) her vanquish'd face Hides with a cask, and flying from the light, Seeks the husht mansions of eternal Night: With Her pure Faith, and Justice, (her sword broke) And Concord in a rent and mourning Cloak. On th'other side where Hell's wide jaws respire, Grim Pluto's train springs rise: Erinnys dire, And fierce Bellona, and flame-girt Megeare, And Death and Fraud, and multiplying Feare. Amongst whom Rage, like Bacchus (his reines broke) Runs headlong, and with bloody helm doth Cloake A thousand ugly faces digg'd with wounds With heavy shafts: a Martial Target sounds Worn with his left, and from his right hand hurl'd A blazing fire-brand terrifies the world. The stars are pos'd: light-headed Atlas reels; Wond'ring to miss the weight that poys'd heaven's wheels. The factious Gods come down on earth to side. And Venus first her Cæsar justify'de, Pallas with her, and Mars that shakes a whole Oak for a speare; and with his Sister, Sol: And Atlas Grandson and Alcides (found Like him in all his acts) The trumpets sound, And Discord with torn hair, her Stygian head Advances from a dell, her dim eyes shed Instead of tears a blotted show'r of blood: Two tire of brazen grinders rusty stood: Her tongue o'reflows with gore: her snaky locks Hang down over her face: and through her Frocks Wide-gaping Rent, thrusting a bloody hand About her head she tost a flaming brand. She leaving Hell, and where sad rivers joyne, Touch'd the high top of noble Appennine: From whence each realm and sea she might command, And view the Troops that roule on every Land: Then burst into these words, with fury warm, Arm all the world with fell intentions: arm: Shoot flames in midst of Towns (who e're he be That stands a Newter, is the Victor's fee.) Fight Boys, fight Maids, fight Old men neer your end. Quake Earth, and shattered stones rebel.—Defend The laws Marcellus.—Do thou Curio preach Up tumults.—Lentulus do not impeach Thy Martial spirits working.—What mak'st thou Julius the while freezing in Armour? now Enter the gates, or scale the walls, and break The Roman Fisk.—Pompey art thou too weak To keep Rome's Towers? to Epidamnum pass The Ominous Scene, and dye Thessalian grass With Roman blood. To all that Discord said, Earth cry'd 'Tis done: and her command obey'd. The Translator's POSTSCRIPT. Here Petronius breaks off abruptly, thereby as well as in many imperfect places of his own Copy, proving as good as his word, that he had not added thereto the last hand. In which thing alone I have translated him to the life, for neither have I added mine to the English: onely making so much use thereof, as to shew the Rule and Model, which (indubitably) guided our Camoens in the raising his Great Building, and which (except himself) that I know of, no Poet ever followed that wrought in great, whether ancient, or modern. For (to name no more) the Greek Homer, the Latin Virgil, our Spencer, and even the Italian Tasso (who had a true, a great, and no obsolete story, to work upon) are in effect wholly fabulous: and Lucan (though worthily admired) is as much censured by some on the other side, for sticking too close to truth. As Fabius for one;—Lucan full of flame and vigour, and most perspicuous in his Sentences: yet (that I may speak what I think) rather to be reckoned amongst the Orators then the Poets. And Servius for another, with less manners in his expression; That which I said, that the Art of Poetry is forbidden to set down a naked story, is certain: for Lucan deserved not to be in the number of Poets, because he seems to have compiled a History, rather then a Poem. Amounting to the same which is objected above in the Introduction to this Essay (which glanceth particularly at Lucan) and mended (as the Author thereof conceived) by the Essay it self, which is of a mixt nature between Fable and History. TORQUATO TASSO. in his 6 Part. fol. 47. Vasco, whose bold and happy ships against The Rising Sun (who fraights them home with day) Display'd their wings, and back again advanc't To where in Seas all Night he steeps his Ray: Not more then Thou on rugged Billows felt, He that bor'd out the Eye of Polypheme; Nor He that spoyl'd the Harpyes where they dwelt, Afforded Learned Pens a fairer Theam. And this of Learn'd and honest Camoens So far beyond now takes it's glorious flight, That thy breath'd Sailes went a less Journey, Whence To Those on whom the Northern Pole shines bright, And Those who set their feet to ours, The boast Of thy Long Voyage Travails at his Cost. THE LVSIAD OF Lewis Camoens. First Canto. 1 Armes, and the Men above the vulgar File, Who from the Western Lusitanian shore Past ev'n beyond the Trapobanian-Isle, Through Seas which never Ship had sayld before; Who (brave in action, patient in long Toyle, Beyond what strength of humane nature bore.) 'Mongst Nations, under other Stars, acquir'd A modern Scepter which to Heaven aspir'd. 2 Likewise those Kings of glorious memory, Who sow'd and propagated where they past The Faith with the new Empire (making dry The Breasts of Asia, and laying waste Black Affrick's vitious Glebe; And Those who by Their deeds at home left not their names defac't, My Song shall spread where ever there are Men, If Wit and Art will so much guide my Pen. 3 Cease man of Troy, and cease thou Sage of Greece, To boast the Navigations great ye made; Let the high Fame of Alexander cease, And Traian's Banners in the East display'd: For to a Man recorded in this Peece Neptune his Trident yielded, Mars his Blade. Cease All, whose Actions ancient Bards exprest: A brighter Valour rises in the West. 4 And you (my Tagus's Nymphs) since ye did raise My Wit t'a more then ordinary flame; If I in low, yet tuneful Verse, the praise Of your sweet River always did proclame: Inspire me now with high and thund'ring lays; Give me them cleer and flowing like his stream: That to your Waters Phebus may ordaine They do not envy those of Hyppocrene. 5 Give me a mighty Fury, Nor rude Reeds Or rustick Bag-Pipes sound, But such as War's Lowd Instrument (the noble Trumpet) breeds, Which fires the Breast, and stirs the blood to jars. Give me a Poem equal to the deeds Of your brave Servitors (Rivals of Mars) That I may sing them through the Universe, If, whom That held not, can be held in Verse. 6 And you, a present Pawn to Portugale Of the old Lusitanian-Libertie; Nor the less certain Hope t'extend the Pale One day, of narrow Christianitie: New Terrour of the moorish Arsenale: The foretold Wonder of our Centurie: Giv'n to the World by God, the World to win, To give to God much of the World agin. 7 You, fair and tender Blossom of that Tree Belov'd by Him, who dy'd on One for Man, More then whatever Western Maiestie Is styl'd Most Christian, or Cæsarean. Behold it in your Shield! where you may see Oriques Battaile, which Alphonso wan, In which Christ gave for Arms, for you t'emboss, The same which He himself bore on the Cross. 8 You (pow'rful King), whose Empire vast the Sun Visits the first as soon as he is born, And eyes it when his Race is half-way run, And leaves it loath when his tyr'd Steeds adjourn. You, who we look should clap a yoak upon The bruitish Ishmaelite, become your scorn; On th' Eastern Turk, and Gentil who still lies Sucking the stream which water'd Paradise. 9 That Majestie which in this Brow appears (This tender one) suspend for a small time, Already such, as in your perfect years When Fame's immortal Temple you shall climbe Those milder eys, with which you banish Feares, Bend to the ground: on which, by num'rous Ryme, You'l see in me a Passion overgrown, To make the Portugal-Atchievemenes known. 10 You'l see a strange love to my Native-soyle, Not mov'd with Vile but high immortal Meed: For, to be compted is a Meed not vile The Trumpet of the Nest where I was bred. By That, their names drawn great, and laid in oyl You'l see, of whom you are the Sov'raign Head: And judge, which is the greater Honour Then To be King of the World, or of such Men. 11 Hear me, I say, for not for Actions vaine, Fantastick, Fabulous, shall you behold Yours prais'd, though forraigne Muses (to obtaine Name to themselves) have ev'n feign'd names extold. Your Subjects true Acts are so great, they staine And credit all the Lyes of others told. Stain Rhodomont, that puffe Rogero too, And Mad Orlando, grant their deeds were true. 12 For These, I give you a fierce Nunnio Who King and Country propt, almost alone. An Egas, a Don Fuas, whose worths to show I wish my Voice could reach great Homer's tone. For the twelve Peers, I other twelve bestow That past to England, and Magrizzo one. Th'illustrious Gania in the Reare I name, Who rob'd the wandring Trojan of his Fame. 13 Then (if to Match with Charls The Great of France, Or one you seek to rival Cæsar's name) The first Alphonso see, who with his Lance Eclipses whatsoe're outlandish Fame! And Him, who by successful Valiance Rescu'd and snatcht his Realm from civil Flame! The second John, unconquer'd by the sword! The Fourth and Fift Alphonso, and the Third! 14 Nor shall my Verses in Oblivion leave Those Chiefs, who, in the Kingdoms of the Morn, Their name in Armes unto the starres did heave, By whom your ever-conqu'ring Flag was born: Matchless Pacheco: Two Almeyda's brave, Whom weeping Tagus will for ever mourn: Terrible Alburquerque: Castro bold: And more, whom death had not the pow'r to hold. 15 And whilst I These do sing, and dare not you, Great King (for I aspire not to that height) Take you your Kingdomes reynes your Hand into, And furnish matter for a loftier flight, Whilst your new worth may meet a Vein as new. Your num'rous Fleets, and Armies pond'rous weight, Let the World groan with, and their terrour seize The Affrick-Land's, and Oriental-Seas. 16 On you with fixed eys looks the cold Moore, In whom he reads his ruine prophecy'de: The barb'rous Gentile (viewing you) is sure You'l yoak his neck, and bows it to be ty'de. The silver Thetys offers you in dow're All her blew Realm, and doth the same provide. Took with your Face (where love is mixt with Awe) She seeks to buy you for her Son-in-Law. 17 In you, out of their Blissful Bow'rs Above Your Grandsires souls (both famous in their way, The one in golden peace, which Angels love, T'other in bloody War) themselves survay. In you they hope their glories shall improve, Their Vertues be recoynd with less Allay: And wide they sit, to keep for you a roome In Heav'n's eternal Temple 'gainst you come. 18 But now, because your time creeps slowly an To rule your People, who much wish it so; Play with the new Attempt of a bold man, That up with you this Infant-muse may grow; And you shall spye ploughing the Ocean Your Argonauts, that they may also know You see them tost upon the angry Brine: And use your self to be invok'd betime. 19 They now went sayling in the Ocean vast, Parting the snarling Waves with crooked Bills: The whispring Zephyre breath'd a gentle Blast, Which stealingly she spreading Canvas fills: With a white foam the Seas were overcast, The dancing Vessels cutting with their Keels The Waters of the Consecrated Deep, Where Protheus's Flocks their Rendezvouses keep. 20 When in the Heav'n Of Heav'ns the Deities, That have of humane things the Government, Convene in glorious Councel, to advise On future matters of the Orient. Treading in Clusters the Diaphane skyes Thorough the Milky way their course they bent, Assembled at the Thunderer's command By Him That bears the Caduceian Wand. 21 They leave the patronage of the Seav'n spheres Which by the Highest Pow'r to them was giv'n: The Highest Pow'r, who with an eye-brow steers The Earth, the raging Ocean, and the Heav'n. There, in a moment, every one appears; Those, where Bootes's waine is slowly driv'n, Those, who inhabit South, and where the Sun Is born, and where his golden Race is don. 22 With an austere and high Majestick grace Upon a Christal Throne, with stars imbost, Sublime The Father sate (worthy that place) By whom the Bolts, dire Vulcan forg'd, are tost. An Oderiferous Ayre blew from his face, Able to breathe new life in a pale Ghost: A Scepter in his Hand, and his Head crown'd With one stone, brighter then a Diamownd. 23 On glitt'ring chairs (imbroyd'red richly o're With infinite of Pearles and finest Gould) The other Deities were placed low'r, As Reason and the Herald Order would: The Seniours first, to honor them the more, And after them those who were not so ould: When thus the most high JOVE the silence brake, With such a voice as made Olympus shake. 24 Eternal dwellers of the Tow'r divine, And Impirean-Hall with starred Vault; If the much Vertue of the valiant Line, Of Lutus be not worn out of your Thought; You needs must know what the great Fates design To crown the former Wonders Those have wrought, That they shall darken with their evening-Glory Th' Assyrian, Persian, Greek, and Roman story. 25 Your selves were witnesses, with what a poor And naked Army it was giv'n to Them To take from the well-fix't, and num'rous Moor All that sweet Tagus waters with his stream. Then 'gainst the stout Castilian-Warriour Heav'n still beheld them with a fav'ring beam: And still in fine with glory and Renown The hanging Trophies did their Churches crown. 26 I speak not (Gods) of that more ancient name Which with the Queen of Nations they did get When (led by Viriatus) so great fame They wan, whilst They and hostile Rome were met. I pass their other Clash with that proud Dame (Which 'tis impossible you should forget) When a Bandito did their Truncheon bear, Who feign'd himself inspir'd by a tame Deare: 27 See now, how trusting to uncertain Waves In a fraile Barke, through ways untrod before (Fearless of horrid Boreas, and the Braves Of the fierce Southern wind) they throw at more! How (having yoak't before that Sea which laves Affrick's North-side, and yoakt her Southern-shore) They bend their purpose and their forces turn To win the Cradle of the budding Morn. 28 To Them is promis'd by eternal Fate (Whose high decrees no Power can ere revoke) To be perpetual Porters of that Gate Through which the Sun first guides his silver spoke. They've spent at Sea the bitter Winter's date; The men are harast, and with Travaile broke. 'Tis now high time (as it appears to me) To shew them that new Land where they would be. 29 And therefore, since they have (as you have seen) So many dangers in this Voyage past; Tost through so many Seas and Clymates been; Of so sharp adverse Winds felt many a Blast; I purpose now they shall as friends be in The Affrick-Land refresh't with some Repast; And, having victual'd there their wearied Fleet, Proceed in their long course as it is meet. 30 Thus JOVE: when in their course of Parliament The Gods reply'd in order as they Sate, And to and fro by way of Argument Upon the matter calmly did debate. Then Father Bacchus stiffly did dissent From what great JOVE propos'd; As knowing, that His Fame ith' East must suffer an eclipse Should there arive the Lusitanian-ships. 31 He of the Fates had understood, from Spain How that a warlike People was to come Thorough the middle of the Ocean, Which all the Indian-Coast should overcome, And which, with modern Victories, should stain All old ones, whether forraign, or their own. It griev'd him sore, those Actions should be drown'd Which still in Nysa made his name resound. 32 He looks on India as his old Acquest, From whom nor Time, nor deeds by others don, Had robd the stile of Conq'rour Of The East, By All That taste the streams of Helicon. But now he fears that Glorie's neer it's West, In the black Water of Oblivion To set, should their desired Port obtain The valiant Portingalls That Plough the Main. 33 Fair Venus holds up the contrary Theam Affected to the Lusitanian-Nation, For the much likeness she observ'd in Them To her old Rome, for which she had such passion, In their great hearts, in the propitious beam Of their to-Affrick-fatal constellation, And in the charming musick of their Tongue, Which she thinks Latine with small dross among. 34 These things did Cytherea move: But more Because from Fate of truth she heard it sed That at those Lands her Altars should adore Where this Victorious People should be spred. So one, to keep what was his own before, T'other, to gain new honors to her head, Contest and stickle for their sev'ral ends, And Both are backt and favour'd by their Frends. 35 As when the fierce South-wind, and fiercer North, Have got into the thickest of a Wood, Breaking the Boughs to force a passage forth Through matted shades, impetuous and wood; The Air that yells, and all the mountain roar'th, The Leaves are scattred, and the strong Rocks mov'd: Such was the tumult which amongst the Gods Was raised then in the Supream Aboads. 36 But Mars, who, with more cordialness did take Then any of the rest, the Goddes's part; Whether it were for old Affection-sake, Or for this valiant People's own desart (His look confest him vext before he spake) Amongst the Gods upon his feet did start. His heavy Target, at his shoulder hung, (Displeas'd, and dreadful) he behind him flung. 37 Lifting a little up his Helmet-sight (Twas Adamant) with confidence enough To give his Vote himself he placed right Before the Throne of JOVE, arm'd, valiant, tough: And (giving with the butt end of his Pyke A great thump on the floor of purest stuffe) The Heav'ns did tremble, and Apollo's light It went, and came, like colour in a fright. 38 And thus he said; O Sire, whose will (whate're) All which thou hast created must obay: If These, who seek another Hemisphere, Thou wouldst not have to perish in the way, Whose deeds and Valour once thou heldst so deare, And did'st of old ordain what they assay: Then hear no more (since thou'rt a Judge upright) Reasons, from one who sees by a false light. 39 For if sound Reason did not plainly show It self here vanquisht by excess of Feare, 'Twere prop'rer Bacchus should his pains bestow For Lusus's Race, who was his Minion deare. But let this spleen of his at present goe; “Tis an ill stomach rising at good cheare: “And envy never found the way in fine “To do Man right, or what the God's designe. 40 And Thou (the Father of great Constancy) From the determination thou hast tooke Recoyle not. “It is imbecility “When once a Thing's begun, then back to looke. But since in speed the winged Mercury Outstrips the Winds, a Shaft, the swiftest Brooke. Let Him now shew them to some Countrey, where They may refresh, and news of India heare. 41 The pow'rful Father having said the same, Gave with a nod the Soveraign Assent To that which Mars said here with greater flame, And over All his holy Nectar sprent. Streight through the milky way, by which they came, The Gods to their respective Stations went, Making a low obeysance to the Throne As they past by in Order one by one. 42 Whilst this in the High-Court is passing now And beautiful Of Heav'n Omnipotent; The warlike People the salt Ocean plough Leaving the South, and face the Orient, 'Twixt Madagascar's Isle, where all things flow, And Ethiopia's barren Continent. 'Twas in that month, when Sol the Fishes fryes To which fear'd Brontes turn'd two Deities. 43 So pleasantly they went before a Wind As those That now had got the Heav'n to frend. Serene the Ayre was, and the Weather kind: No Clowd, nor ought that danger might portend. The Promontory Prassus left behind, Which antient Ethiopia doth defend, Neptune disclos'd new Isles which he did play About, and with his billows danc't the Hay. 44 Vasco De Gama (a most valiant Guide, Born and pick't out for that great Enterprise, Of a high Soul, and strongly fortify'de, Who Fortune to him by his Boldness tyes) Stands off, to leave this Land upon one side, Thinking, that uninhabited it lies; And on his course determines to proceed: But otherwise the matter did succeed. 45 For streight, out of that Isle which seem'd most neer Unto the Continent, Behold a number Of little Boats in companie appeer, Which (clapping all wings on) the long Sea sunder! The men are rapt with joy, and, with the meer Excess of it, can onely look, and wonder. What Nation's this (within themselves they say)? What Rites? what Laws? what King do they obay? 46 Their coming, thus: in Boats with finns; nor flat, But apt t'o're-set (as being pincht and long) And then they'd swim like Rats. The Sayles, of Mat Made of Palm-leaves, wove curiously and strong. The Mens Complexion, the self-same with that Hee gave the Earth's burnt parts (from Heaven flung,) Who was more brave, then wise; That this is True The Po doth know, and Lampetusa rue. 47 The Cloaths, they came in, were a Cotton-Plad With divers Colours strip'd, and white the ground; Which some cast queintly under one arm, had; Others, about their Middles streightly bound; All else from the waste up remain'd unclad: Their weapons, Skeyns, and crooked Faulchions: Round Terbants upon their heads; and, as they row'd, Resounded Timbrels in an antick Mode. 48 Waving their hands and kerchers, These made signe To those of Lusitania to stay: But the swift Prows already did incline To come to Anchor in the Island's Bay. Land-men, and Sea-men in this work All joyne, As all their labours should have end that day. They haule the Roapes; strike, strike, the crew resounds: The salt Sea (stricken with the Anchor) bounds. 49 They were not Anchor'd, when the uncouth Folke Already by the Cordage did ascend. Their jovial countenances wellcome spoke, To whom the Lordly Chiefe did (courteous) bend. Bids streight the Boards be spread, the Bottles smoke, With that rich juice which is the Poet's frend. Ours pow'r it into Bowles, and All They fill The burnt by Phaethon spare not to swill. 50 They ask (and still the cheerie Bowle goes round) In the Arabick-language, Whence The Fleet? Who, and of whence, the men; and Whither Bound, And through what Seas It came where now they see't? Hereto the valiant Lusitanians found Such answers as were proper, and discreet: We are the Portugheses of the West, We go to seek the Countreys of the East. 51 All the great Ocean have we sail'd, and crost, To the Antartick from the Artick Strand Gone all the Round of Affrick's spacious Coast; We have felt many a Clyme, seen many a Land. We serve a potent King, who hath ingrost His Peoples loves so, that, at his command, With cheerful faces, not vast Seas alone, But we would pass the Lake of Acheron. 52 And 'tis by that comand we travel now To seek the Eastern Land which Indies laves: By that this distant Ocean-Sea we plough, Where none but Monsters sayl'd the horrid Waves. But now 'tis reason, We should likewise know (If Truth have found a Harbour in your Caves) Who you are? what this Land in which you dwell? Or, if of India you can Tydings tell? 53 We are (one of the Isle replying said) Strangers unto this People, Law, and Place; The Natives being such, as Heav'n hath made Without the light of Reason, or of Grace. We have a Law of Truth, which was convay'd To Us from that New-light of Abram's Race, Who houlds the World now in subjection due, By Father, Gentile; and, by Mother, Jew. 54 This little Isle (a barren healthless Nook) Of all these Parts is the most noted Scale For such as at Quiloa's Traffick look, Or to Mombassa, and Sofala, sayle. Which makes Us here some inconvenience brook, To gather, for a mortal life, and frayle: And (to inform you in one word of All) This little Isle Men Mozambique call. 55 And now (since you come seeking through long toyle Indian-Hydaspes, and the Spicy Strand) You shall have such a Pilot from this Isle, As through the waves the way doth understand. 'Twere also good, you here repos'd a while, And took in fresh provisions from the Land; And that our Governour did come Aboard, To see what else may need for Him t'afford. 56 This the Barbarian, and retreated then Into his Boates with all his companie, Departing from the Captaine, and his Men, With demonstrations of due Courtesie. Mean time Apollo in the Sea did pen The golden day, and down to sleep doth lye Leaving his Sister so much Torch to burn As may suffice the World till he return. 57 With unexpected joy their hearts on floate, Blithely they pass the Night in the tyr'd Fleet; To think that in a Country so remote The news so long desired they should meet. Within themselves they ruminate, and noate The mens odd fashion, and admire to see't, Or how a People of their damned way Could take such root, and bear so vast a sway. 58 The silver Moon's reverberated Ray Trembled upon the Chrystal Element; Like Flow'rs in a great Meade, at middle May, The stars were in the azure Firmament. The furious Winds all husht and sleeping lay In drowzy Hyperborean Caves dark-pent Yet those of the Armada do not sleep, But in their turns accustom'd watches keep. 59 And when Aurora left her Spicy Bed, Shaking her deawy locks the Earth upon; And drawing, with a lilly-hand, the red Transparent Curtains of the waking Sun, To work go All; over the Decks to spred The shadowing Sailes, and all their Streamers d'on, To entertain with feasting and with joy (Advancing in his Barge) the Isle's Vice-Roy. 60 Merrily sayling he advanc't, to see The Lusitanian-Frigates in the Road, With fresh provisions from the Land: For Hee Still hopes, they are of that inhumane Brood, Which, from their mountains neer the Caspian Sea, The fruitful Lands of ASIA overflow'd; And, by permission of the Pow'r Divine, Usurpt the Empire of Great Constantine. 61 The Captaine, with a meen benevolent, Receives the Moore, and all his company. Things of great price he doth to Him present, For such Occasions carryed purposely: Gives him Preserves, and gives him of that queint Unusual liquor which gives jollity. The Moore receives it all in courteous part, But what he Eats and Drinks most glads his heart. 62 The nimble Lusitanian Mariners Upon the shrowds in admiration hung, To see a mode so different from theirs, And barb'rous gibbrish of that broken Tongue. No less confus'd the subtle Moore appears, Eying their colour, habit, and ships strong. Then, asking all things; This, amongst the rest, If happily they came from Turkie, prest. 63 Moreover, to behold desireth Hee The Books of their Religion, Law, and Faith: To see, if with his own the same agree Or that of Christ (as he suspects) he saith. And (that he All may note, and All may see) He prays the Captain, shew him what he hath Of Armes, which by his Nation used are When with their Enemies they go to War. 64 To whom the valiant Captaine made reply By one well versed in that Bastard-Tongue: Illustrious Lord, I shall to thee descry My Self, my Faith, and th' Armes I bring along. Neither of Turkish-blood nor breed, am I; Nor of a Countrey that delights in wrong. In fair and warlike EUROPE was I born, I seek the famous Kingdoms of the Morn. 65 We worship Him, who is by every Nature, (Invisible, and visible) obay'd, Him, who the Hemispheres, and every Creature, (Insensible, and sensible) hath made: Who gave Us his, and took on Him our feature: Whom to a shameful death his own betray'd: And who from Heav'n to Earth came down in fine, That Man, by Him from Earth to Heav'n might climbe. 66 Of this God-Man sublime, and infinit, The Books which thou desir'st I have not brought, For that in Books we need not bring that Writ, Which (written in our Hearts) we have by rote. For th' Arms, whereof thou hast desir'd to git A sight, with all my heart I do allow't, To see them as a Friend; For well I know, Thou ne're wilt wish to see them as a Foe. 67 This having said, the ready-Officers He doth command to shew the Magazeen. Out come the Backs, and Breasts, glitt'ring and terse; Fine Mayles, safe Coats, with quilted plates between; Bucklers, where various Imagerie appeares; Ball, Lead, and Iron; Muskets of Steel sheen; Strong Bows, and Quivers with barbd Arrows wedg'd; Sharp Partesans; and Halberts double edg'd. 68 The morter-pieces come; and with them came (Confounding where they light) Granadoes dire; Yet would he not permit the sons of Flame Unto the dreadful Cannon to give fire. For valiant spirits (which are still the same With generous) to boast their utmost Ire, To few, and timid soules, cannot indure “To be a Lyon among Sheep, 'tis poor. 69 But now the Moore from what he heard and view'd, (All which he did observe attentively) Conceiv'd within his Breast a certain feud, A root of Envy, and Malignity; Yet no such thing his outward gestures shewd: But, with a smiling hollow Courtesie, He with himself resolves to treat them faire, Till he his purpose may by deeds declare. 70 Pilots the Captain at his hands doth pray, His Ships as far as India to guide: Assuring him they shall with ample pay For all their pains therein be satisfy'de. The Moore consents; but still the poyson lay Close, where it was, invenoming his side: For, had he pow'r of blasting with his breath, Instead of Pilots, he would give him death. 71 So great the hate was, and so great the spight, Which to the strangers suddainly he took; Knowing they follow that unerring light, The Son Of David holds out in his Book. “O the deep secrets of that Infinite “Into the which no mortal eye can look! “That They, whom Thou to be thy friends hast chose “Should never be without perfidious Foes. 72 The trech'rous Moore, when he his fill had seen, Departeth from the Frigates with his Crew (As false in heart, as flatt'ring in his meen) And feign'd Regards on all the Sea-men threw. Through the short Traverse of the humid Green The Boats had quickly cut, when, wellcom'd to The shore, and met by an obsequious Train, To his known House they wait him back again. 73 The famous Theban from th'æthereal Hall (He, in his Thigh, whom JOVE his Father bore) Seeing this meeting with the Portingall Is an abomination to the More; Hath in his Brain a Stratagem, which shall (He hopes) destroy him quite upon that score. Now whilst this plot is forging in his head, Unto himself these angry words he sed; 74 Is it already then by Fate ordain'd, That so great Victories, and so renown'd, Shall by the men of Portugal be gain'd On warlike People, and on Indian Ground? And I (son of the HIGHEST, unprofan'd With carnal mixture, and in whom are found Such rare Indowments) must I suffer Fate To a meer man my honors to translate? 75 Unto the son of Philip it is true Such pow're the Gods did in those parts afford, 'Twas one with Him, to See, and to subdue, And Mars himself did homage to his Sword. But can it be indur'd, that to so Few Fate such stupendious puissance should accord, That that of Macedon, of Rome, and Mine, The Lusitanian Glory should out-shine? 76 It must not, nor it shall not. For before This Swabber shall arrive the wished Land, I'l spin him such a Webb on yonder shore, That he shall never see the Eastern-strand. I'l down to Earth, and spur th'inraged More: “The Iron cooles that suffer'd is to stand. “And who so means a business sure to make, “He by the foretop must occasion take. 77 Thus saying (vext, and little less then mad) Upon the Affrick-shore he did descend, Where, in a humane shape and visage clad, To neighb'ring Prassus he his course doth bend. The shape he took on him (thereby his bad And false designe the better to commend) Was of a Moore in Mozambique known, Old, wise, and with the Governour all one. 78 And (entring to his Patron when he spy'de The fittest season to infuse his guile) He tells him; These, who in the Harbour ride, Are men That live by robberie and spoyle: That Fame, from Nations rang'd on the Sea-side, With hue and crye pursu'd them to their Isle, Of whom these Vagabonds a Bootie made When they had anchor'd with pretence of Trade. 79 Moreover I would have thee know (quoth Hee) These bloody Christians (as I understand) With Flames and Pyracies have fill'd the Sea, As well as with their Robberies the Land; And that they have it in designe, how Wee May be reduc't too to their proud command: How they may rob us of our goods, and lives, And take for Slaves our children, and our Wives. 80 And this I know, to morrow by day-breake To come on shore for water they intend, Arm'd, with their Captaine: Can Men plainer speake? “They mischief mean, to feare it, who pretend. Thou, arm'd with thine, the same advantage take; Them in close ambush quietly attend: Who, thinking to catch thee at unawares, Will come with ease to fall into thy snares. 81 And, should it so fall out, that by this feat They should not wholly be destroy'd, and slain; Another Plot (the which will give thee great Content, I'm sure) I have within this Brain. Send them a Pilot, skill'd so in deceit, And how to lay an undiscerned Train, That he may lead them blinded, where they may Be kill'd, wreckt, sever'd, or quite lose their way. 82 This said by Him, who plaid so well the Moore Whom years and Fraud made wise to obviate Harmes; Thanking him much for his advice mature, About his Neck the Zeque throws his armes. And from that instant bids his Bands be sure To be all ready for the Morn's Allarmes. That so, when land the Lusitanian shou'd, He may convert their water into blood. 83 Farther (t'effect that other false device) A Moorish Pilot he did ready git, Subtle, dissembling, and in mischief wise, To whom so great a Trust he might commit. Him, through such Seas, where such and such Coast lyes, He bids to guide the Lusitanian Fleet, That, should the danger in one place be past, It may be sure to perish at the last. 84 Now visited th' Apollinean Ray. The Nabathêan mountains with a smile, When Gama with his men themselves aray To go and fetch fresh-water from the Isle. Plac't with good order in the Boates are They, As he had known of the intended guile; And in a sort he did so: “For the Wise “Have a divining soul that never lyes. 85 Moreover for the Pilot he had sent To land before, in need whereof he stood; To which the sound of Warlike Instrument Was all the answer he had understood. For this, As likewise, to be confident Of a false Nation being never good, He went as well provided as he could With no more people then three Boats could hold. 86 But the keen Moors (pickeering on the Strand To keep them from the Fountain's thirsted draught, With Buckler on one Arm, and dart in hand, Another with bent Bow, and poyson'd Shaft) Stay for the valiant Portingalls to land, In secret Ambush others hid with craft: And send (to make them think the business sure) A small Forlorn, as Faulkners throw their Lure. 87 On the white Beaches the black Warriours prance, Waving and vap'ring all the Levell o're; And with heav'd Target, and with threat'ned Lance, Dare the bold Portingalls to come on shore. The noble people have not patience To see the doggs grin at them any more. But spring in Covey, with such equal hast One could not say which landed first, or last. 88 So a brisk Lover in the bloody Place (His beauteous Mistress by in a Balcon) Seeks out the Bull, and (planted face to face) Curvets, runs, whistles, waves, and toles him on; But the stern Bruite, ev'n in a moment's space (His horned Brow low'd to the Earth) doth run Bellowing about like mad; and (his eys shut) Dismounts, strikes, kills, and tramples underfoot. 89 Loe, from the ships the Flames out of the hard And furious Cannon roll'd, to Heaven rise! The Bullets murther, whom the Sound but scar'd: The hissing Aire, struck, bandies back the noise. The Moors hearts melt in them, they are so fear'd; And the same passion chills their blood to Ice. Now He, That lay in hidden ambush, flyes: And He, That ventur'd the Incounter, dyes. 90 The Lusitanian People rest not here: But, following their success, destroy and slay. The Wall-less-Town, and timber-Houses there, They waste with fire, and flat with Cannon lay. His sally now the Moor repents full deer, For which he thought a cheaper price to pay. Now he blasphemes the War, curses ill luck, Th'old devil, and the dam that gave him suck. 91 The flying Moors their Javelins backward threw Faintly, through feare, and haste of their Retreat. The Flint, the Stake, the Stone in folio flew. “Anger makes all things weapons, when 'tis heat. Now, to the Victor leaving the Isle too, Unto the Continent they frighted get. The Sea's small Arm, that doth their Isle imbrace, They cut and traverse in a little space. 92 Some leap with their best goods into the Boats; Some with their natural Oars swim to the shore; This sinks into the crooked waves, then floats; That puffs the Sea out, he new drank before. The showred Bullets from the Cannon-Throats The bruitish peoples brittle Vessels tore. Thus did the Portingalls in fine chastise The falshood of malicious Enemies. 93 To the Armada Victors they return With the rich spoils and booty of the War. Water they may have now to serve their turn At their own time without controle, or bar. The Moors (fresh smarting with their losses) burn With greater malice then before by far: And, seeing so much unrevenged shame, Set their whole Rest upon the After-game. 94 The Governour of that infamous Land To sue for Peace (as if repenting) sent. Nor do the Lusitanians understand That, under shew of peace, worse war is meant: For the desired Pilot (underhand Instructed in his trecherous intent) In token of the Peace which he did crave He sends to be their Pilot to the Grave. 95 The Captaine (who already understood 'Twas time to go his discontinued way, And that the weather and the wind are good To carry him for wished India) Receives the Pilot with a cheerful mood: And th' Envoyé, who did his answer stay, Dispatcht in haste (his minde is in the skye) To the large Wind lets all the Canvas flye. 96 Departed in this wise, the azure Waters Of Amphitrite cuts the warlike Fleet, Attended by a Troop of Nereus's daughters (sweet Friends, and no less constant, then th'are sweet) The Captain (thought-less of those devilish matters Which in his Brain the subtle Moor doth knit) Touching all India, and the Coasts they past, Informs himself by Him from first to last. 97 But the Moor well instructed in deceit (To whom his lesson spightful Bacchus gave) Prepares for Him, e're he to India get, New Ills, either of Thraldome, or a Grave. Giving accompt of Indian Harbours yet, He shews him All that ever he did crave; That (judging Truth what he in that confest) The valiant People may not doubt the rest 98 And then he tells him (with the same intent With which false Synon witcht the men of Troy) There is an Isle, not far from where they went, Which ancient Christians from all times injoy. The Captain (who to all he told him lent Attentive Eare) at this so sprang with joy, That he conjur'd him with a golden spell To guide him speedy where those Christians dwell. 99 This very thing the trech'rous Moor design'd Which the deluded Christian doth intreat, Those, who possest this Isle, being the blind Disciples of the filthy Mahomet. Here death, and certain Ruine, he shall finde (As he believes) for a far more strong and great, Then Mozambique, is this Isle; by name Quiloa: frequent in the mouth of Fame. 100 To It the joyful Fleet he did incline. But Shee, whose Altars in Cythera steam, (Seeing him go astray from his right line, To meet a death of which he doth not dream) Permits not those in so remote a Clyme To perish, whom she doth so much esteem: And puts them, with contrary winds, besides The Place to which the trayt'rous Pilot guides. 101 Then the base Moor, when he did plainly finde He could not work the Villany be meant; Spawning another mischief in his minde, And always constant to his black intent: Tells him, that, since the waves are so unkinde To put them by the Port to which they bent, There lyes another Island hard before, Where mixed live the Christian, and the More. 102 Likewise in this the shameless Villain ly'de (As his Instructions were in fine to do) For not a Christian-Soul did there reside But All of Mahomet's detested Crew. The Captain (who in all believ'd his Guide) Made a short task to bring his ships thereto: But (his protecting Angel saying, nay) Past not the Bar, and anchors in the Bay. 103 This Isle lay to the Continent so neer That a small Chanel onely ran between: In front thereof a City did appeer Upon the Margent of the Ocean green: Fair and Majestical the Buildings were, At a far distance plainly to be seen: Rul'd by an aged King. Mombassa, all The Isle; the Town too they Mombassa call. 104 And neer the same the Captain being come Is much rejoyc't: There looking to behold People, That had receiv'd their Christendome, As the false Pilot promis'd him he should. When loe, Boats coming from the King, with some Provisions to the ships! For He was tould Of such a Fleet by Bacchus long before Taking the figure of another More. 105 Such the Provisions were, as Friends send Friends, But there is poyson hidden in the Baite. Of Enemies their thoughts are and their ends, As will be too much manifested straight. “O the perpetual danger which attends “The lot of Mortals! O uncertain State! “That, where our trust seems to be anchor'd sure, “We are not safe, although we are secure. 106 “By Sea; how many Storms, how many Harms, “Death in how many sev'ral fashions drest! “By Land; how many Frauds, how many Allarms, “Under how many wants sunk, and opprest! “Where may a fraile man hide him? in what Arms “May a short life injoy a little Rest? “Where Sea, and Land, where Guile, the Sword, and Dearth, “Will not all arm 'gainst the least worm o'th Earth? End of the first Canto. Second Canto. 1 Now was the glorious Guilder of the Pole, Who into hours distinguishes the Day, Come to his temp'rate and desired Gole, From Mortals hiding his celestial Ray; And God Nocturnus to descending Sol Of Thetys's private Chamber turn'd the Kay: When to the ships the faithless People row'd Which were new-anchor'd in Mombassa's Road. 2 Amongst them One (who had it in command To Sugar o're the poyson) thus began. Undaunted Captain, That with Keel hast span'd The spaces of the briny Ocean; The noble King of this renowned Land At thy arrival is an o'rejoy'd Man: The sum and heighth of whose Ambition is, But to behold and serve thee with what's his. 3 And, for he longs indeed thy Face to see, As One's, whose name Fame glories to repeat; Within the Barr, without suspition, Thee With all thy ships to come; he doth intreat. Also, because thy Men must wearied beee Through so long Toyle, and so excessive great, He says, thou maist refresh them on the shore Which humane Nature doth delight in more. 4 Moreover, if thou seek for Merchandize Produc't by the Auriferous Levant; Cloves, Cinnamon, and other burning Spyce; Or any good or salutiferous Plant; Or, if thou seek bright Stones of endless price, The flaming Ruby, and hard Adamant: Hence thou may'st All in such abundance beare, That thou may'st bound thy wish and Voyage Here. 5 The Captaine by the Bearer did return His humble thanks unto the King, and said; Because the Sun already did adjourn His Royal pleasure was not streight obayd: But at the first disclosing of the Morn, Whereby the Anchors might be safely weigh'd, With all assurance he would Enter, since He was oblig'd to more for such a Prince. 6 He asks him afterward, if in the Isle Are Christians, as the Pilot certify'de; The subtle Messenger, (who smelt the Wile) Most of the Isle believe in Christ, reply'de. With this, all jealousie he did exile, And wise suggestion of the soul decride In the strange Captaine; Resting now secure, In a false Nation, and a Sect impure. 7 Yet, out of such as (having been condemn'd For faults and horrid mischiefs done at home) Had their lives giv'n them onely to the end For desp'rate services with Him to come, Two of the prime and craftiest Heads, to send With the deceiptful Moores, he pick't: By whom To spye the Town, and what their strength might be, And note those Christians, whom he yearns to see. 8 And He by them sent presents to the King, Through which the Friendship to himself pretended Might be soft, pure, and without wavering, Nothing of which was by the King intended. Now was the wicked and perfidious Ging. Gone from the ships, and through the waves contended. The two of the Armada, with a faign'd Alacrity, on shore were entertain'd. 9 And when they had delivered to the King The Presents, with the message, which they brought, They walkt the Town: But no discovering The half of what to have observ'd they thought. For the suspitious Moors, not every thing Would shew to them, which They to see besought. “Where malice reigns, there Jealousie doth nest, “Which doth suppose it in Anothers Brest. 10 But He, who hath perpetual Youth, and Mirth In his plump Cheeks, ruddy with blood and wine, And from two mothers took his wond'rous birth; Who for the ships spun all this snare so fine; Disguis'd into a Creature of the Earth, Was in a House within the City's line, Feigning himself a man of Christian lore, And deckt an Altar where he did adore. 11 On It, the picture of that Shape he plac't In which the Holy Spirit did alight: The picture of the Dove (so white, so chast) On the Blest Virgin's head, so chaste, so white. The Sacred Twelve sate figur'd all aghast, More wondring at themselves, then at the sight; As Those, who knew, what onely did inspire Their various Tongues, was those faln Tongues Of Fire. 12 The two Companions (carried by design Where Bacchus was in this deceitful guize) Their knees devoutly to the Earth incline, And raise their hearts to Him That's in the skyes. Gums of the oderiferous and divine Panchaya; Gums, in which the Phenix dyes, Lyeus burnt: from whence it doth insue, That the false God came to adore the true. 13 Here entertained and carest that night, With all good Treatment, and Reception fair, Were the two Christians: heedless of the slight By which with holy shew deceiv'd they were. But when the Sun displayd his glorious light (Having dispatcht before him through the Ayre Old Tython's youthful Consort, to proclame With Blushes to the world her Gallant came.) 14 The Moors return, who to the City went, With Orders from the King for entring There: With them, the Couple whom the Captain sent, To whom the King appear'd a Friend sincere. So that (assur'd there is no Evil meant To Portingalls, which he should need to feare, And that Christ hath some Sheep amongst those Wolves) To enter the salt River he resolves. 15 His own Envoyees say, they saw on shore Religious Altars, and a holy Priest; That they were nobly treated, and did snore Till fair Aurora left her rosie nest, Nor ought but joy, and wellcome more, and more, By King, or People, could they see exprest: So that to doubt a thing so fair, and cleer, No ground of reason did to them appeer. 16 Therefore the noble Gama did receive With open arms the Moors That came aboard: For wariest minds 'tis easie to deceive When words and deeds so seemingly accord. His Ship is cram'd with faithless folk, who leave The Boats which brought them, ty'de to't with long Cord. Blithe they are all, as Those that understand They have the Prey as sure as in their hand. 17 Weapons, and Ammunition of the War, They have on Land prepared secretly; That, when the Ships are anchor'd past the Bar, They may invade them, bold, and suddainly, And, by this treachery, resolv'd they are To ruine Those of Lusus totally; Making them (unexpected) to pay, so, The score which they in Mozambique owe. 18 Hoysting the holding Anchors, the ships Men In the accustom'd Nautick clamour joyn'd. To thrid the Barr's Land-marke they bord it then, Giving the fore-sails onely to the Wind. But fair Dione (never absent, when The gallant Folk need her in any kind) Seeing so neer so cruel a surprize, From Heav'n to th'Ocean like an Arrow flyes. 19 She calls together Nereus's snowy daughters, With all the azure Flock That haunts the deeps; (For, being born from the salt-Sea, the Waters In her obedience as their Queen she keeps) And, telling them the Cause that thither brought her, With all in Squadrons to that part she sweeps Where the ships are, to warn them come, no nigh, Or they shall perish fundamentally. 20 Now through the Ocean in great haste they flunder, Raising the white foam with their silver Tayles. Cloto with bosom breaks the waves in sunder, And, with more fury then of custom, sayles; Nise runs up an end, Nerine (younger) Leaps o're them, frizled with her touching Scales: The crooked Billows (yielding) make a lane For the feard Nymphs to post it through the Maine. 21 Upon a Triton's back, with kindled Face, The beauteous Ericyna furious rode. He, to whose fortune fell so great a grace, Feels not the Rider, proud of his fair load. Now were they almost come upon the place Where a stiff gale the warlike Navy blow'd. Here they devide, and in an instant cast Themselves about the Ships advancing fast. 22 The Goddess, with a party of the rest, Lays her self plum against the Am'ral's Prow, Stopping her progress with such main contest That the swoln sayl the Wind in vain doth blow. To the hard Oak she rivets her soft Brest, Forcing the strong ship back again to go. Others (beleagu'ring) lift it from the Wave, It from the Bar of Enemies to save. 23 As to their Store-House when the Houswife Ants, Carrying th'unequal Burthens plac't with slight To their small shoulders (left cold Winter's wants Surprize them helpless) exercise their might; This tugs, that shoves, one runs, another pants; Strength far above their size, they All unite: So toyl the Nymphs, to snatch and to defend The men of Lusus from a dismal end. 24 The ship (inforced contre) goes back, back, In spight of those she carries, who with Cries Handle the Sayls. They fume, their wits they lack; From side to side the shifted Rudder flyes. The skillful Master from the Poop doth crack His Lungs in vain, for in the Sea he spyes A horrid Rock just just before the Ship, Threatning a Wreck should she advance a step. 25 Here the rude saylors raise a Cry indeed, As they are busie at their work. The More This hideous clamour strikes with such a dread, As when in horrid fight the Cannons roar. From them the cause of all this fury's hid: Nor whom t'approach know They, or what t'implore. They think their treacherie is made appeer, And that for it they must be punisht heer. 26 Loe! in the twinckling of an Eye some dart Themselves into their speedy Boats agin: Others betake them to their swimming Art, Making the Sea leap up as they plump in. They vaut o're the ship-sides from ev'ry part, So mainly are they frighted with the dyn: Advent'ring rather to the Ocean, so, Then to the hands of a provoked Foe. 27 As Froggs (in ancient Ages Lycian-Folkes, Confin'd to live in Water, they deny'de) If, basking heedless on the Banks, or Rocks, Some Person on the suddain they have spy'de, Skip back again, and fill the Pond with croakes, Flying the danger which they have descride; And (scaping to their Sanctuary known) Shew above Water their black heads alone. 28 So fly the Moors. And so the Pilot (who To this great peril had misled the Ships) Thinking his Treason was discovered too, Into the briny water, flying, skips. But that fixt Rock to scape and to exchue, Which the sweet life might drive out of their lipps, The Admiral threw streight an anchor out; And close to her the others likewise do't. 29 Th'observing Gama, seeing the great fright And unexpected of the Moors; withal The Pilot's suddain and accusing flight, Found what the bruitish Folke hatcht in their gall: And seeing, how in spight of wind, in spight Of Tyde (both with him) and in spight of all Their Art, the Ship would not advance a head (Holding it for a miracle) thus fed. 30 O great, undreamt of, strange deliverance! O Miracle most cleer and evident! O fraud discover'd by blind Ignorance! O faithless Foes, and Men dev'lishly bent! “What Care, what Wisdom, is of suffisance “The stroake of Secret mischief to prevent, “Unless the Sov'raign Guardian from on high “Supply the strength of frail Humanity? 31 Well into Us hath Providence infus'd What little safety in these Ports is known: Well have we found how much we were abus'd With shows of Friendship, and Religion. But since to humane Prudence is refus'd To pierce intents, and where such masks are on; O thou (Guardian Divine) to guard Him daigne, Who without Thee doth guard himselfe in vain. 32 And since thy heart is toucht with so great Ruth For a poor People wandring on the Seas, As of thy goodness (whence alone it doth Proceed) to save us from such Wolves as these; Unto some Haven now, where there is Truth, Resolve to lead us for a little Ease; Or shew us to the long desired Coast, If for thy honour we desire it most. 33 These pious words the fair Dione heard And (to compassion being mov'd thereby) Goes from among the Nymphs, who sad appear'd That they must loose so soon her company. Now doth she pierce the Stars; now in the therd Sphere, she is entertain'd: whence by and by (Having repos'd her) she doth forward move Towards the Sixt, where is her Father Jove. 34 And (ruffled with her motion) now so fair, So fresh, so gay, so lovely is her looke; That Starrs, and Heav'n, and circumfused Ayre, And All That see her are with passion took. Her Eyes (the Nests of Cupid whom she bare) Breath'd such quick Spirits, and such fire they strook; They burn the World again like Phaeton, And to the torrid turn the frigid Zone. 35 And (to bewitch her Sov'raign Sire the more, Whose dearling she was always, and his joy.) She comes to Jove, as she had done of yore In the Idean Grove to Him of Troy. The Huntsman who the Horns (transformed) wore, For seeing thus that other Goddess coy; Had he seen this, had ne're been torn asunder By his own doggs: But di'de of love, and wonder. 36 The golden Tresses on her shoulders fell, Whose whiteness smuts the Fleece of nnfaln Snow: Her Breasts (and those ev'n their own milk excel) Playd with by unseen Cupid, trembling go: Her Cesto's white doth mounting flames expel, Which, that Boy kindling, those white bellows blow: Of this fair Pyle the Pillars smooth, and round, Desires, like Ivy, have about them wound. 37 Those parts, of which Shame is the natural Screen, In a thin Veile of Sarcenet she doth fold; Not wholly shewd, nor wholly left unseen, Not Prodigal, nor niggard, of that Gold. But this transparent Curtain draws between, To double the desire, by being control'd. Now Heav'n is fill'd with jealousie, and love: This mov'd in Mars, in Vulcan that did move. 38 And then, discov'ring in her Angels face A Sadness temper'd with a little smile, Like some nice Dame, who by the rude embrace Of heedless Lover got a bruise, or soyl; She's pleas'd and angry in one instant space, And one while chides, and laughs another while: So spake the Goddess who admits no Peer Less sad, then Minion, to her Father deer. 39 O pow'rful Father, I had always thought That, for such things on which my heart were set, Kinde I should finde thee, affable, and soft, Though some Opposer should the same regret. But since I see, without neglect, or fault Of mine, thy love is bated in the heat; What remedy? let Bacchus have his will: In fine, his luck was good, and mine is ill. 40 This People (who are mine, for whom I pore These tears out, which I see in vain distill) The more I love, I seem to hate the more; Thou being resolv'd to break me of my will. For Them I weep to thee, for them implore, And 'gainst my Fate in fine am fighting still. Well then, because I love them they're misus'd, I'l hate them, then they will be better us'd. 41 But let them dye by bruitish Peoples hands; For since I was ? and heer with pearly drops (As when the morning's-dew on Roses stands) Making a salt Parenthesis, she stops: As if her words obey'd not her commands, Through melting pity of the mens mishaps. Then (going to proceed where she gave o're) The mighty Thund'rer lets her say no more. 42 And, mov'd by that dumb Rhet'rick (which would move A Tygers flinty Breast) with the same Face Of cheerfulness, with which he doth remove The Clowds from that of Heav'n, and Tempests chace, He wipes her Tears, and (kindling with nevv love) Kisses her Cheek, her vvhite Neck doth embrace. Who, had he hated Portugal before, Would novv have lov'd it meerly on her score. 43 And (pressing her lov'd face vvith his) She burst Into fresh Tears, and faster then before: As vvhen, a child being beat by mother curst, The more one moans it, it vvill sob the more. Novv, to allay this Passion, He is forc't To tell her much vvhich he till then forbore: And, vvith these vvords, out of the secret vvomb Of pregnant Fate, rips many things to come. 44 Fair daughter mine, fear no adversitie Which to thy Lusitanians may betide; Nor Any, to have greater povv're vvith me Then the svveet Tears vvhich from these cleer Springs glide For, let me tell thee (daughter) thou shalt see Both Greeks and Romans (so much magnify'de) Forfeit their ancient Honours by the New Acts, vvhich this People in the East shall do. 45 For if the Eloquent Ulysses fled, The Sirens Song, and dire Calypso's spell; And if Antenor with his ship did thred Th' Illyrian-Sleeve, and reacht Timauus's Well; And if 'twixt Scylla, and Charibdis dread, Pious Eneas with his Navy fell: How much worse dangers pass Thine dayly over, Who, sayling round the world, new worlds discover? 46 Thou shalt see (daughter) Cities, and strong Ports, And lofty Walls, which These shall build, and found; Thou shalt see warlike Turks, and their proud Forts, By These destroy'd and level'd with the ground: The Indian Kings (secure in their free Courts) By a more potent King Thou shalt see bound. He, in conclusion holding All in awe, Unto that Land shall give a better Law. 47 This very Man, who now, through so much fright And misty Errour, stumbles to the Ynd, Thou shalt see Neptune tremble at his sight, Curling his waves without a breath of wind. O wonderful, nor seen by mortal Wight, The Winds lockt up, and yet a Storm to find: O valiant People, and for great things made, Who makes the Elements themselves afraide. 48 That Land, which water late to Him deny'de, Thou shalt behold it a commodious Port, Where in their way to rest them shall abide The Ships that (weary) from the West resort. All this wyl'd Coast in fine (which now hath try'de By wicked trechery to cut him short) Shall pay him Tribute; knowing they must down, If they withstand the Lusitanian Crown. 49 And Thou shalt see the Erythrean, lose It's native red, and pale with Terrour look: And see the potent Kingdom of Ormuse Twice taken, twice subdu'de unto their yoak: And see the furious Moor stand in a Muze With his reverberated Arrows strook: That he may learn, if against Thine he fight; His Treacherie on his own pate shall light. 50 The famous Fort of Dio Thou shalt see, Being twice besieg'd, thy People twice defend. There will their prowess manifested be, There will their name in Arms to Heav'n extend, There will they bring great Mars under their Lee With deeds which, told, would set the Hayr on end. There will the falling Moor blaspheming ban, And dam with his last breath the Alcoran. 51 Thou shalt see GOA taken from the Moor, GOA, That by her loss at last shall gain; When, on the wings of Conquest made to soare, Shee, as the Queen Of All The East shall raign. The stubborn Gentiles (who the Sun adore) High and triumplant then, she shall restrain With a rough Bitt, and All who in that Land Against thy People dare to lift a Hand. 52 Slenderly mann'd, and in poor order put; Thou shalt see held the Fort of Cananowr; And shalt see won the City. Calicut, In People infinite, boundless in pow'r; And in Cochin shalt see such honor got By one, shall stand in battail like a Tow'r, That never Lyre a Victor did resound, Who so deserv'd to be with Lawrel crown'd. 53 Never was so Leucate of a flame With shocking Fleets, when gilding with their Trim The Actian waves) Hence young Octavius came, Bringing Italian pow'rs along with Him; Thence Anthony (with a fresh Victor's name Barbarians from the Orient, from Nyle's brim, And from the farthest Bactria; and (the bane Of All!) th'Egyptian Mistress in the Traine. 54 As thou shalt see the Sea, and neighb'ring Shores, Fire with thy Peoples Battails. Who, in bands Shall coupled lead Idolaters with Mores (Triumphing over many Tongues and Lands) And (Golden Chersonesus's pretious stores To farthest China conquer'd by their hands With the East's outmost Islands, in the end Make all the Ocean to their Tagus bend. 55 In so much (daughter mine) that, at the rate This Nation's valour passes humane bound, The World hath not to match them in debate, From silver Ganges, to th'Herculean Sound; Nor, from the Northern Ocean, to that straight Which the affronted Lusitanian found; Though all the ancient Hero's (deifide) Should rise again to have the mastry try'de. 56 This having said, his consecrated Poast (The son of May) down to the Earth he sends, To finde some peaceful Port upon that Coast Where the Armada may repose with Frends. And (left the valiant Captain should be lost, If longer time he at Mombassa spends) He gives his Legate farther in command To shew him in his sleep that friendly Land. 57 Now swift Cyllenius cuts it through the Ayre: Now to the Earth his winged feet declin'd. Badge of his office, the black Rod he bare: This Hell's sad Pris'ners doth release, and bind: This lays asleep the Eye opprest with Care: Whisking with this he doth outstrip the Wind: His Hat of maintenance upon his Crown: And thus he comes into Melinde's Town. 58 With him he carries Fame, that she may tell The Lusitanian prowess, and rare parts: “For an illustrious Name is a strange Spell “To attract Love, and good Report hath darts. Thus he prepares their way with a sweet smell, And takes up lodgings in the Peoples hearts. Now all Melinde is on fire, to see What kind of men these valiant souls should bee. 59 From thence he parteth to Mombassa straight, Where, what to do, the Ships uncertain stand; To bid them, without question or debate, Leave that Foes Harbour, and suspected Land. “For wicked plottings of infernal hate “In vain are Force and Courage to withstand: “In vain, to extricate our selves, is Wit, “If Heav'n do not both prompt, and second, it. 60 Now sable Night had finisht half her Race, And in the Heav'n the Stars with borrow'd light Supply'd the Moon's, as She her Brother's, place; And sleeping now was Mortals whole delight. Th'illustrious Captain (who had all that space Been kept awake about the last day's fright) Gave then to his tyr'd Eys a little sleep: The rest by Quarters did their Watches keep: 61 When in a Vision he did Hermes see. And fly (he bid him) Lusitanian fly The Ambush of a wicked King, which Hee Hath laid, to make thee yet obscurely dye: Fly, for the wind and Heav'n Both favour Thee. Thou hast the Ocean calm, serene the skye, And not far of another King, to frend, On whose reality thou mayst depend. 62 Look for no better entertainment here, Then what was giv'n by Thracian Diomed; Whose Horses (us'd to bloody Provendere) He with the Bodies of his strangers fed. Th' infamous Altars of Busiris (where His Guests inhumane humane offrings bled) Unless thou quit it, look for in this place: Fly a perfidious and a cruel Race. 63 Steer straight alongst the Coast, and thou shalt light Upon a Countrey where more Truth resides; Close there, where burning Sol at constant hight The night and day with equal line divides. Then shall a King receive with much delight Thee, and thy men; and give to you (besides Safety, and Treatment worthy of a King) One, who the Fleet shall unto India bring. 64 Thus Hermes; and the Captain (parting) woke. He, rowz'd out of his Nest in a great fright, Perceives the circumfused darkness broke With a shot Ray and stream of divine light. And (seeing it imports Him, and his Folke, From that infamous Land to take their flight) Commands the Master, with a spirit new, To hoyse the sayles unto the Wind that blew. 65 Set sayl (he cride) set saile to the large Wind: Heav'n is our Guide, and God our course directs. These Eys saw the Express, he was so kind To send from his high Court to guard our steps: At this, the Mariners before, behind, As with one motion spring upon the Decks. They towe the Anchors in to the ship-side With that rude strength which is the Sea-mans pride. 66 The self-same time they did their Anchors weigh, (Hid in the mask of night) the trech'rous More Sawing their Cables husht and silent lay, So to destroy them being run ashore. The Christians (though there shone not the least Ray, Yet) in their heads the Eyes of Lynces wore. The other, finding how they were awake, With Wings, and not with Oares, away did make. 67 But now did the sharp Keels go cutting through The liquid Element of silver pure: The Wind ('twas a side-wind) gently it blew With motion calm, and steddy, and secure. Discoursing, on their dangers past they chew As they sayl on: for 'tis not easie sure. To pass in silence a deliverance So great, and brought about as 'twere by chance. 68 The burning Sun had finisht one Career, Began another, of his annual Race; When, as far off as they could ken, appeer Two Vessels creeping on the Water's face. Knowing they must be Moors, who coast it there, Forthwith ours veer their Sayles to give those chace. One (as more nimble, or as frighted more) To save her People ran herself ashore. 69 Her Fellow (not so light to make away) Into the hands of those of Lusus falls, Without or Mars to board her; or, to play On her bruiz'd sides black Vulcan's horrid Balls: For (she being weakly man'd, nor built for Fray) At sight of his own Men the Master falls. His courage, and his sayles (His wisest course) Had he resisted, he had far'd the vvorse. 70 Then Gama (who did this but to procure A Pilot for the Indies so long sought) Amongst those Moors thought to have found one sure, But found he was deceived in that thought. There's not a man of them, That can assure Under what part 'tis of the heav'nly Vault. This All can tell him; That Melinde's nigh, Where he may finde a Pilot certainly. 71 The goodness of that King the Moors extol, His bounteous nature, and his Breast sincere, The greatness like the goodness of his Soule, With other parts, which win him love, and feare. The Captain easily believes the whole, Concurring with that very Charactere. Hermes had given in his sleep before: So goes, bid by the dream, and by the More. 72 That gladsome season 'twas, in which returns Into Europa's Ravisher the Sun; Putting new lights in both his gilded Horns Whilst Flora pours out Amalthea's one. And now that glorious Planet turn'd the Morn's Red finger, to that moving Feast; whereon He, who was dead the soul-sick world to heal, To it's Redemption rose to put the Seal: 73 When, to that distance from the which their Eys Might reach Melinde, the Armada came; Adorn'd with Tapistrie triumphant-wise, As that day's holiness it well became. The Standart trembles, and the Streamer flyes, The Scarlet-Wast-cloaths at a distance flame, The Drums and Timbrels sound. Thus they that Bar, Like Christians enter, and like Men Of War. 74 With People hid is the Melindian shore, That come to see the joyful Fleet. More kind Are These, more humane, and of truth have more, Then Those of all the Countreys left behind. The Lusitanian Navy drops, before, The heavy Anchors, which fast rooting find. One, of the Moors they took, is sent on Land: To let the King their coming understand. 75 The King (who was already by report Of those of Lusus's gallantry possest) The Captain's so frank entrie in his Port Takes as a favour from so brave a Guest: And with true heart, and in most courteous sort (Both individual from a noble Brest) Bids the man pray them much to come on Land, Where they shall have his Realms at their command. 76 Th'offer as real is as it appears, The words full of unfeign'd Sinceritie, Which the King sent the noble Cavaleers, Who had past so much Land, and so much Sea. He sends them more, Live-sheep aboard, fat Steers, And Poultry cram'd by Houswifes industrie, With all such Fruit as then in season was: And the good will the Present did surpass. 77 The well-pleas'd Moor, who with this Errand went, The Captain pleas'd receiv'd, with what he brought; And instantly another Present sent Unto the King, far fetcht, and dearly bought: Illustrious Scarlet (colour of content) Brancht Coral fine, for Nobles greatly sought: Of double nature under water soft And velvet-horn'd, hard-pen'd when 'tis aloft. 78 Sends more, one dext'rous in th' Arabick-Tongue, To treat a firm League with the Royal More, Excusing him he did not leave his strong And lofty Ships, to kiss his hand on shore. Unto the noble King, led through a Throng Presents himself the fit Ambassadore; And with these words (which Pallas herself dips In her own Nectar) disunites his lips. 79 Most high and mighty King, to whom the pure And incorrupted Justice from Above Gave, to restrain the rough and haughty Moor; Nor more to force his Feare, then win his love: As to the strongest Port, and most secure Of all the East, Hither we flye; to prove What Fame reports, and find in It and Thee, A certain Port in our necessitie. 80 We are not Men, who, spying a weak Town Or careless, as we pass along the shore; Murther the Folks, and burn the Houses down; To make a booty of their thirsted store: But (by a King we have, of high renown, Sent from fair EUROPE, never to give o're Our compassing the World, till we have found The wealthy India) thither are we bound. 81 How stony yet some Race of People was! What barb'rous guize! what stile of a Man-Hater! To bar not their Ports onely (let that pass) But the cold Hospitalitie of Water! To whom have we done wrong? wherein (alas!) Have we discover d such a savage nature, To make so many of so few afraid? That Traps and Pitfals should for us be made. 82 But Thou (O gracious King) from whom, to have True dealing we are sure; and hope, we may That certain help too, which Alcinous gave Unto the wandring Prince of Ithaga: To Thee secure we come, as boldly crave Of Thee, conducted by the Son of May: For, since Joves Harbinger was ours; 'tis cleare, Thy Heart is large, is humane, is sincere. 83 Nor think (O King) out noble Chiefe declin'd Coming, to see and serve thee pers'nally, For any thing he scrupled of unkind; Or hollow dealing possible in Thee: But the true reason, why he stayd behind, Was, that in all he might obedient be Unto his King; who gave him this command In Port, or Roade, never to go on Land. 84 And, because subjects are the self-same Thing With Members governed by the Head, or Crown; Thou, bearing here the Office of a King, Wouldst not that Any disobey'd his own. But, he doth promise an acknowledging Of thy great Grace and favours now bestown, With all That can by Him and His be done, So long as Rivers to the Sea shall run. 85 Thus He harangu'd: And, with one Voice, the whole Presence (comparing notes there where they stand) The matchless courage of the men extol, Who traverse so much Sea and so much Land. But the wise King (revolving in his Soul The Portingalls's obedience to command) In Scales of wonder and of rev'rence weigh'd A King, who so far off could be obeyd. 86 Then answers (gracious) with a Brow serene Th' Ambassadour, to whom inclin'd he seem'd. Wipe all suspition from your Bosoms cleane; Let no cold Fear be harbour'd there, or teem'd: For such your worths are, and your deeds have been, To make you over all the world esteem'd. And They who injur'd you, We will be bold, Know not what price Vertue and Honor hold. 87 That all your People do not come on shore Observing the respect due to our Port, Though in our own regard it grieve us sore, Yet our esteem of them is greater for't. For if your Rules permit it not, no more Shall we permit, that (onely to comport With our desires) such loyal excellence Should lose it self, or suffer Violence. 88 But when to morrows light shall come, to greet And shew, the World; with our own Barges, Wee Shall go in person to the warlike Fleet, Which we so many days have long'd to see. And, if it need any convenience meet, Through shatt'ring storms, and keeping long at Sea, A Pilot it may have, and Victnals here, And Ammunition, with intention cleere. 89 This was his language, And Latona's Boy Into the Ocean div'd. The Messenger (Returning with this Embassie of joy) To the Armada rows with merry cheer. Out of all Breasts is banisht black Annoy, Seeing the proper remedie is here To find the Land whereof they sayl in quest: So all that night they keep a double Feast. 90 There wants not there the artificial star Like trembling Comet (nor less cause of wonder) The Gunners do their Part, making the Ayre, Water, and Earth, resound with Mortalls's Thunder. The Cyclopps (practising for t'other War On JOVE) with Bullets rend the Clowds in sunder. Others on lofty Cornets (singing) playd: And These with Musick did the Spheares invade. 91 They answer from the shore at the same time With Squibs that crack amongst the Rout: In gyres The whizzing Vapours up to Heaven climbe: Th'imprison'd Powder with a bounce expires: Heaven's brazen Vault ecchoes the Voyces's chyme: The Sea's cleer Glass reflects the joyful fires: The Earth is not behind them. In this sort Both sport in earnest, and Both fight in sport. 92 But now the restless Heav'n, wheeling about, To their day-labours mortals doth incite; And Memnon's mother (fair Appollo's scout) Sets bounds to sleep by her arriving light; With her approach dull shadows, Put to rout, In a cold sweat upon the Flowers light; When the Melindian King (embarqued) plide To see the Ships That in his Harbour ride. 93 The shores are crown'd with people (of a fire To be Spectators onely of the show) The Scarlet Coates flame with the dye of Tyre: The glossie Silks with all May's flow'rs do blow. Instead of Arrows (part of Warr's Attire) And of the horn'd Moon-imitating Bow; Palm in their hands, in sign of Peace, they bear: Which on their Heads victorious Heroes wear. 94 In a Canóe (which was both long and broad, And glissend in the Sun with Cov'rings, made Of mixed Silks) Melinde's King is row'd: Wayted by Princes 'mongst their own obay'd. In rich Attire (according to the mode And custom of that Land) he comes arayd. Upon his Head he weares a Terbant, roll'd, Of silk and Cotton, with a Crown of gold. 95 A Roabe, of Scarlet-damask, (high-extold By Them, and worth the wearing of a King) About his Neck a Collar of pure gold: The work worth twice the substance of the Thing. A Velvet sheath a dagger keen did hold, With Diamond-hilt, hang'd by a golden string. Sandals of Velvet on his Feet he wore, With gold and pearl imbroydred richly o're. 96 O're Him a round Silk-Canopy he had Advanc't aloft upon a gilded Pole; With which a Boy behind to burn forbad Or trouble the Great King, the beams of Sol. Musick ith'Prow, so merry that 'twas mad, Grating the Eare with a harsh noise. The whole Consort, is onely crooked Horns, wreath'd round, Which keep no time, but make a dismal sound. 97 No less adorn'd, the Lusitanian From the Armada in his Boats doth dance, To meet Him of Melinde with a Train Whom much their cloaths, but more their deeds advance: Gama comes clad after the use of Spain, But wears a Cassock ala mode de France: The Stuff, a Florence-Satin; and the dye, A perfect Crimson, glorious in their Eye. 98 The Sleeves have golden Loops, which the Sun-shine Makes too too bright and slippry for the Eyes: His close Camp-Trowzes lac't with the same myne, Which Fortune to so many men denyes: Poynts likewise of the same, and Tagging fine, With which his Doublet to his Hose he tyes. A Sword of massive Gold, in Hanger tyde: A Cap and Plume; the Cap set a toe side. 99 Mong'st his Camrades, the noble Tyrian dye (Not liv'ry-wise, but) sparcled here, and there, The sev'ral Colours recreate the Eye: So do the diff'rent Fashions which they weare. Such their inamel'd Cloathes Varietie (Compriz'd in one survey) as doth appear The painted Bow, in water-colours laid, Of Juno's Minion, the Thaumantian Mayd. 100 The ratling Trumpets, now, their joy augment As, other times, they had their courage done. The Moorish Boats cover'd the Sea, and went Sweeping the Water with their silks Anon. The Clowds of Heav'n the thund'ring Cannon rent, And with new Clowds of Smoak put out the Sun. Before the Blow the winged lightning flies: The Moors's hands stop their Eares, the lids their Eyes. 101 Into the Captain's Boate the King doth come (Folding him in his Arms) And He agin With such respect and rev'rence, as become, Doth both receive, and speak unto, the King. A while with wonder and Amazement, dumb, The Moor on Gama stands considering, As He That highly doth esteem the Man Who came so far to seek the Indian Stran. 102 Then makes him a large proffer, of whate're To do him good his Kingdom can afford; And that he freely would demand it there As his own goods, if ought he lackt aboard. Adds, though till now he saw the Lusians ne're Yet he from Fame had heard much of their Sword; And how, in other Parts of Affrica, They have had wars with People of his way. 103 And how through all that spacious Land resown The glorious Actions of that Nation, When they therein did gain that Kingdom's Crown, Where the Hesperides of old did won. And most of That, which to the King was known (Although the least the Portingalls had done) He spread out thin in words, and magnifide: But to the King de Gama thus reply'de. 104 O great and gracious King, who dost (alone) The Lusitanian People's sad estate, (By Neptune's rage, and adverse Fortune, thrown Into so many streights) Commiserate: The King Of Kings (who, from th'eternal Throne, Turning Heav'n round, did the round Earth create, Since Mercy is his chiefest Attribute) Reward thee for it, for We cannot do't. 105 Thou onely, of all Those Apollo blacks, In peace receiv'st us from the Ocean vast: In Thee, from peril of Eolian Wracks, We find a Refuge kind, syncere, and fast. Whilst the Sun lights, whilst Night his presence lacks, In Heav'n's blew Meade whilst Stars take their repast, Where're I go, in either Hemisphere, Thy Name, and Praises, shall be founded there. 106 This humbly said, towards the Fleet they row, (The King requesting that he now may see't). Ship after Ship about it round they go: That he of All may note all he thinks meet. Lame Vulcan walks on Lynstocks to and fro, With which the Guns salute him from the Fleet. The Trumpets play unto him in shril notes: The Moors with Cornets answer from the Boates. 107 But when the gen'rous King had ceast to Noate All That he would, nor heard with little wonder Th'unusual Instrument with the wide Throate That speaks so big, and tears the Clowds in sunder; He bids them (in the Sea anch'ring the Boate) Suspend their Oars, as they had done their thunder: That he may know at large of brave De Game Those things, which lightly he had heard from Fame. 108 The Moor doth into sev'ral questions run, With gust inquiring, sometimes of the great And famous Wars between our Nation, And Those who do believe in Mahomet. Now of the Land we dwell in, which the Sun Bids last good night, when he makes hast to set; Now, of the Nations which therewith confine; Now of his ploughing through the Gulphs of Brine. 109 But rather, valiant Captain (quoth the King) Make us a full and orderly narration Under what Part of the Celestial Ring, Under what Clyme ye have your Habitation; Also your ancient Generation's spring, And, of a Realm so potent the Foundation; With the successes of your Warrs: For (though I know them not) that they were vast I know. 110 Tell us besides, of all that tedious maze Through which thou hast been tost with angry flaws On the salt Seas, observing the strange ways Of our rude Affrick, and the barb'rous Laws. Tell; For the Horse of the new Sun, the Day's Imbroydered Coasts with golden traces draws, Postilion'd by the Morn: The Wind's asleep, And the curst Billowes couch upon the Deep. 111 And if the Winds and Seas are husht, to hear The story thou shalt tell: no less are Wee. Who would not lend your Acts a greedy Eare? Who hath not heard of Lusus's Progenie? Sol (who the Brain of man doth purge and cleer) Drives not his Coach thus nigh us as you see, To have Melindians thought so dull a Breed, As not to value an Heroick deed. 112 A daring War the haughty Gyants made Upon Olympus permanent and pure: Rash Theseus, and Perithous, did invade Grim Pluto's Kingdom horrid and obscure. If such high Boys as these the world hath had, 'Tis not less hard, nor will less Fame procure, Then the attempting Heav'n and Hell by Them, That others should attempt the Watry Ream. 113 Diana's Temple built by Tesiphon (Rare Architect!) Horostratus burnt down: To be talkt of, though for a Thing ill done, And dye defam'd, rather then live unknown. If on so false, and vile Foundation, The sweet desire deceives us of Renown; How much more lawful is't to seek a name By deeds deserving everlasting Fame? End of the second Canto. Third Canto. 1 Now what illustrious Gama, neer the Line, Inform'd that King, report Caliope: Breathe an immortal Song, and voice divine, Into this mortal Breast, that's big with Thee: So, never the great God of Medicine, (To whom thou Orpheus bar'st) love Clycie, Court Daphne more, or call Leucothoe Frend, Since Thou in Beauty doest them All transcend. 2 Thou, Nymph, promote my pious just desire To pay my Country what to It I owe; That the whole world may listen, and admire To see from Tagus Aganippe flowe. Leave Pindus's flow'rs: For (Loe!) the Muses's Sire Bathes me in Sacred dew from top to toe. If not, I swear thou hast some jealousie Orpheus (thy joy) should be eclyps'd by me. 3 To hear the noble Gama, In a Ring Gather'd was all th'attentive Companie; When (having sat a while considering) Raising his manly Visage, thus said He. Thou doest command me to unfold (O King) My noble Nation's genealogie: Thou bid'st me not to tell a forraign story, But of my own thou bid'st me tell the glory. 4 Upon Another's Prayses to dilate Is usual, and that which Friends doth raise: But of One's Own the Prayses to relate, Will prove (I fear me) a suspected praise. Besides, to praise ours to the worth, the date Would first expire of six the longest days. But (to serve Thee) a double fault I'l do: I'l praise my own, and crop their praises too. 5 Yet what in fine doth animate me, is, I'm sure of Lying I shall run no danger: For of such deeds say what I can, I wis I shall leave more to th'utterance of a stranger. But (to pursue that method in all this Thy self prescrib'd, nor seem in all a Ranger) First, of the Territory large I'l tell; Then, of the bloody Battailes that befell. 6 Between the Zone where Cancer bends his clutch (To the bright Sun a Bound Septentrionall) And that which for the Cold is shun'd as much, As for the Heate the middle Zone of all, Prowd EUROPE lyes: whose North, and parts which touch Upon the Occident, have for their Wall The Ocean; and, with unreturning Waves, Her South, the Sea-Mediterranean laves. 7 Upon the East she neighbours ASIA: But that cold River with the doubling stream (Which from Riphean Mountains plough his way To the Meotick Lake) divideth Them: So doth that furious and that horrid Sea Which with their Fleet th incensed Greeks did steme; From whence the Sayler now with his mind's eye Sees the name onely of once glorious Troy. 8 Where she is most beneath the Artick Pole The Hyperborean Mountains she doth see; And those, where Eol raigns without controle, Owing to blustring their Nobility. The Sun, That spreads his lustre through the Whole, His rays have here such imbecility, That a deep snow is still upon the Mountains, The Sea still frozen, frozen still the Fountains. 9 Here Scyths, and Tartars, in great numbers, live; Who were ingag'd in a sharp war of old, About their Pedigrees prerogative, With those who then th'Egyptian-Land did hold. But, where the justice of the Cause to give Being hard by erring Mortals to be told, To get more certain information, look In the Clay-Office from which Man was cook. 10 In that far Nook (to name of many some) Are the cold Lapland; Norway comfortless; Scandia that triumpht o're triumphant Rome (Which her proud ruines to this day confess). Here, whilst the waters are not stiffe, and numb, With Winters Ice glazing the Baltick-Seas, That Arm of the Sarmatick Oceane Sayles the brave Swede, the Prussian, and the Dane. 11 Betwixt this Sea, and Tanais, live strange Nations: Rutheni, frozen Muscovites, Livonians, That were in former Ages the Sarmatians, And, in th'Hercinian Forest, the Polonians. Held of the GERMAN EMPIRE are Alsatians, Saxons, Bohemians, Hungars, or Pannonians: With divers other, whom the Rhine's cold waves, The Elve, the Mozell, and the Danow laves. 12 'Twixt wandring Ister, and that Narrow-Sea Where, with her life, fair Helle left her name, The warlike Thracians dwell: who lay a plea To Mars his Sword, as from whose loyns they came. Here Hæmus, and Orphean Rhodope, Obey the Ottoman; and (to the shame Of Christendom) Bysantium's noble Seat, A proud affront to Constantine The Great. 13 The next in order Macedonia stands, Bath'd with the Actian (now Lepanto's) Sea: And likewise you, O admirable Lands, Where Wit, and Manners, were in high degree; Which bred those solid Heads, and valiant Hands, Those streams of Eloquence, and Poetrie, With which Thou (famous Greece) unto the skies As well by Letters, as by Arms didst rise. 14 Dalmatians follow Them: and, in that Bay Antenor chose for his new City's Syte, Venice (like Venus) rises from the Sea; From low beginnings swoln to that proud hight. That Sea, an Arm of Land doth over lay, Which the whole WORLD subjected by its might. That Arm (no less then Greece) to HEAVEN soar'd With the two wings of Learning, and The Sword. 15 'Tis wall'd by nature, part, where it doth joyn Unto the Alps thick shoulders: Neptune barrs The rest with his salt waves: The Appenine Cuts ith'middle: where your Lybian Mars Wan him such Fame. But now, since the divine Porter hath got it (impotent in Wars) 'Tis stript of the vast pow'r it had before: “So much is GOD delighted with the pore. 16 Pass we from thence to France, so much of old With Cæsar's triumphs through the World renownd. 'Tis water'd with the Royal Seyn, the cold Garoon, the pleasant Loyre, the Rhine profound. Now those high Mountains in the clowds behold Which still the lost Pyrene's name resound: From which, being fir'd (as ancient Books have told) Rivers ran down of Silver, and of Gold. 17 Loe! here displays it self illustrious Spain, As Head there of all EUROPE: In whose strange Successes of their Wars, and ways of raign, Fate's wheel gave many a turn, wrought many a change. But never Force, or Fraud, shall fix a stain (Through Fortune's humor always giv'n to range) But Spain will finde a time to wipe it out, And make her blasted honors freshly sprout. 18 She faces Tingitania: and There (As if to make the Mid-land Sea an Isle) The well-known Streights to close their jaws appeare Innobled with the Theban's latest Toyle. With diff'rent Nations she her head doth reare (Sea-girt three sides, the fourth with Hilly Pyle) Of such Nobility and Valour All, That each pretends to be the principal. 19 She has the Arragonian, so renown'd For conqu'ring twice stubborn Parthenope: Those of Navar: Asturians, who did bound The Moors, broke in upon us like a Sea. She has the shrewd Gallego, many crownd Castilian, whom his Star reserv'd to be Spain's great Restorer and her Lord: Sevilia, Granada, Leon, Murcia, with Castilia. 20 The Lusitanian Kingdom here survay, Plac't as the Crown upon fair EUROPE's Head: Where (the Land finishing) begins the Sea, And whence the Sun steps to his watry Bed. This, first in Arms (by gracious Heav'n's decree) Against the filthy Mauritanian sped: Throwing him out of Her to his old Nest In burning AFFRICK; nor there let him rest. 21 That, That, the loved Earth where I was born! To which if kinder Heav'n do so dispose That I (this Task perform'd) alive return: With It, my dying Eyes, there let me close. From Lysus (which the Latines Lusus turn) Old Bacchus's Camrade, or (as some suppose) His Son, was Lusitania's name deriv'd, When in that Countrey his Plantation thriv'd, 22 Here was that Shepherd born, who in his Name (As well as in his Actions) did write Man: Whom none must hope to equal in his Fame Since that of Rome he to eclipse began. This Spot, through shuffling of light Fortune's Game, Time (who devours his children) saw, Anan, On the World's Theater a great Part play Rays'd to a Kingdom: and it was this way. 23 There was in Spain a King (Alphonso hight) Who made so close a War upon the More, That (what with policy, and what with might) Many he slew, and many a Town he bore. This King's sublime Renown taking her flight From Streights Herculean to the Caspian Shore, Diverse (affecting an immortal name) To Him and Death to offer themselves came. 24 Others (more fir'd with an intrinsick love Of Christian Faith, then Honour popular) Flock from all Corners: willing to remove Both from sweet Countrey, and from private Lar. But, when their names, by Actions rais'd above The vulgar pitch, they All advanc't in War; The fam'd Alphonso, for such gallant deeds, Would have them reap proportionable meeds. 25 Amongst These Henry (saith the History) A younger son of France, and a brave Prince, Had Portugal in lot, in the World's eye Not then so glorious, nor so large, as since. And the same King did his own daughter tye To Him in Wedlock, to infer from thence His firmer love: as giving, in her hand, The Livery and Scisin of that Land. 26 He (when against the Off-spring of the Hand- Maid Hagar mighty Conquests he had won, Gaining in much of the adjacent Land, And doing what was comely to be done) Obtains from Him, who doth high Heav'n command In a short time (to guerdon All) a Son: Who (adding to his Father's worth, his owne) Shall first erect the Lusitanian Throne. 27 Henry was now come from the Holy Land, And Conquest of enslav'd Ierusalem; Having seen consecrated Jordan's Strand, That saw the flesh of God bath'd in his stream; For, Godfrey finding nothing could withstand After Iudea was subdu'd by Him, Many, who in that War had giv'n him Ayd, Their wisht return to their Dominions made: 28 When, come to the last Exit of his Age The famous French-Man (to a wonder brave) Pull'd by Death's hand down from this mortal Stage, His Spirit, unto Him, that gave it, gave. His Son remain'd in tender Pupillage, True Copy of his Sire that's in the Grave: Then whom more excellent the world had none, For such a Father must have such a Son. 29 But old Report (how true I cannot say: For things so distant with much night are spred) Tells, how the Mother, taking all the sway, Scorn'd not to stoop unto a second Bed: And, for herself an After-Game to play, Her Fatherless-Son disinherited: Claiming for Hers the Land, and Princely Pow're, As giv'n her by her Father for a dow're. 30 Then young Alphonso (so the Prince they call, Inheriting his Grandsire in his Name) Despairing by fair means of Portugall, For that the Mother, and her Groom, the same Usurp, and mean from Him to give it All: (His bosom boyling with a Martial flame) By force to seize it in his mind revolves, As briskly executes what he resolves. 31 The blushing Plains of Araduca groan, With one-same blood of War intestine dide; In which the Mother (whose deeds spake her none) The Son her love, and his own Land deny'de: Now stands against him in battalion, And cannot see (being blinded with her pride) How much she sins 'gainst Heav'n, and natural Love: But in her Breast the sensual swims above. 32 O Witch Medea! Progne, with blood-stain! If for their Fathers, not their own misdeeds, By you your children in Revenge were slain, Behold, Teresa's Sin ev'n yours exceeds! Incontinence, the sacred Thirst of Raign, These are the Causes whence her Crime proceeds. Scylla her aged Father slew through one: Through Both Teresa goes against her Son. 33 But the brave Prince a perfect conquest had O're an ill mother, and a Father-in-Law. Forthwith, the Victor, all the Land obay'd That did before their swords against him draw. Then (by his Wrath his judgement oversway'd) Fast laid in Irons he his Mother saw: Which God's avenging Hand did soon pursue. “Such Reverence is to all Parents due. 34 Loe! proud Casteel unites her Forces all (To be reveng'd for sad Teresa's wrong) Against the few-in-People Portingall: But, though his Troops be weake, his Heart is strong. His mortal Head with Shield Angelical Hid in the day of Battail from a throng Of falling darts, not onely firm he stands Their shock, but routs the formidable Bands. 35 Yet, not long after, was this valiant Prince In the same Araduca (his chief Nest) Blockt up with a vast Army, to which, since Their late defeat, the angred Foes increast. But by his faithful Tutor Egas, thence (Offring himself to death) he was releast. Else (of all needful matter ill bested) He in that streight had surely perished. 36 But the best Servant ever Master found, Seeing his Prince can no resistance make, That he should hold of Him the Countrey round To the Castilian King did undertake. He (having honest Egas Moniz bound) The dreadful siege did presently forsake. But the Illustrious youth cannot afford To pay low Homage to another Lord. 37 The time prefixed was arrived now When the Castilian Monarch made account To do him homage that the Prince would bow As to his Founder, and Lord Paramount. Egas (who knew that would not be, and how Because of Him Casteel rely'de upon't) Resolves his broken promise, at the rate Of his sweet life's expence to expiate. 38 And, with his children, and dear Wife, he went T'unpawn and to redeem his morgag'd Faith, Barefoot and bareleg'd, and with eyes so bent To th'Earth, as would move pity more then wrath. If my rash confidence thou have intent To scourge as it deserves (O King) he saith; Loe, here I bring thee of mine own accord A life, in lieu of ill-accomplisht word! 39 Loe here (to piece out mine) the innocent Lives, of my Wife and Babes, before thy Eyes! If Bosoms generous and excellent Accept so frail and dire a Sacrifice. Loe here the guilty Hands, and Tongue! invent All sorts of pains and deaths to exercise On These: such as may prove fierce Scinis dull In mischief; and out-roare Perillus's Bull. 40 Just as before the Heads-man one condemn'd, Who doth in life his death anticipate, And now upon the Block his Neck extend, For the fear'd stroak which must dispatch him straight: So Egas look't, expecting the worst end Could be pronounc't by King's deserved Hate. But the King seeing such stupendious Faith, Mercy at length could more with him, then Wrath. 41 O great, and Portingal-Fidelitie, Payd by a Subject to his Prince! What more Perform'd the Persian in that Project high, When Nose and Face he carbonado'd o're; Which made the great Darius (sighing) cry, His brave Zopyrus, such as he was once, H'had rather have, then twenty Babilons? 42 But now the Prince Alfonso did provide The happy Hoast of Lusitania Against the Moors, who, on the other side Of Tagus's delectable River, lay. Now in the fam'd Orique's Champion wide The proud and warlike Troops he doth aray, Just in the beard of the confronted Moor: As rich in courage, as in numbers poor. 43 His Trust is not in Flesh, but placed all In the eternal God, That Heav'n doth steer: For the baptized Army was so small, To his one man an hundred Moors there were. Those, who consider things by Reason, call It madness rather, then th'effect of cleer And sober heate, on such vast Heapes to run, Where there's an hundred Horsemen to his one. 44 Five Moorish Kings he hath that day defy'de Of whom the Chief hath Ismar to his name: All with the style of Soldier dignify'de, By which is purchased immortal Fame. Each had his Mistress fighting by his side, Like that, as beautiful, as warlike, Dame Who helpt so long to prop up falling Troy; And Those, who streams of Thermodont injoy. 45 Now did Aurora, beautiful and cleer, Out of the Welkin chase the golden Fry: When Mary's son, Alphonso's heart to cheer, Appear'd to him upon the Cross on high. Whom worshipping, That thus vouchsaft t'appeer, All of a fire with Faith) the Prince doth cry, Not to me LORD, but to the Infidel: Not unto me, who know thy pow'r so well. 46 This miracle of mercy so inflam'd The Potingalls, and did their minds erect, That they the gallant Prince their King acclam'd, Whom with such cordial love they did affect; And (drawing up before the Foe) proclam'd To Heav'n, and to the World, their new Elect: Crying alowd; The Army, Crown And All, For Great Alphonso King Of Portugall. 47 As a fierce Mastiffe in in the woody Chace (Whom Shouts, and Hunters Instruments incite) Attacks a Bull, the which his Trust doth place In his sharp Horns's irrefragable might; Now fastning on his flank, now on his Face, More nimble at the turn, then strong in fight; Till, tearing out his Throat, down falls the Beast, The groaning Mountain with his weight opprest: 48 So the new King (with courage no less new Inflam'd by God, and by the People, Both) Upon the barb'rous Hoast, before him, flew With his bold Troops, impetuous, and wroth. With this, the doggs take up a Howle and rue- Full Cry, the people rowze, th'Alarum goeth: They snatch their Spears, and Bowes, the Trumpets sound; Lowd Instruments of war go bellowing round. 49 As when a fire in Stubble dry begun (The whistling Boreas hapning then to blow) Fann'd by the Bellows of the Wind, doth run To the next which Field, Furzes overgrow; And there a knot of Sheepherds (who upon The grassie ground sweet slumbers undergo) Wak't by the crackling flames in the thick Brake, Snatch up their Hooks, and to the Village make: 50 So the surprized Moors, and thunder-strook, Catch up their weapons, which lye round about. Yet fled not, these; but to their Arms they took, And spur'd their warlike Barbs, resolv'd and stout. The Portingall incounters them unshook, He makes his Lances at their backs come out. Some drop half-dead, some tumble dead outright, Others invoke the Alcoran, and fight. 51 Most terrible Incounters, there, resound; Enough to shake in its firm seat a Rock: When those fierce Beasts, the Trident-strooken ground Produc't (with their more furious Burthens) shock. No Nook exempt, the war is kindled round, Vast wounds are giv'n, Neither hath cause to mock: But those of Lusus, Armours, Males, and all, Break, cut, hack, batter, penetrate, and maule. 52 Heads from the shoulders leap about the Field; Arms, Leggs, without or Sence, or Master, flye. Others (their panting entrails trailing) wheel'd; Earth in their bloodless check, death in their Eye. Th'impious Army now the day doth yield: Rivers of Blood flow from their wounds, whereby The Field it self doth lose its colour too, And into Crimson turns the verdant hew. 53 The Portingall victorious doth remain, Reaping the Trophies and the wealthy Prey. Having discomfited the Moor of Spain, Three days the Great King on the place doth stay. In his broad Shield (which he till then bore plain) A Badge eternal of this glorious day, Five small Shields azure he doth now include, In sign of these five Kings by Him subdu'de. 54 In these five Shields he paints the Recompence For which The Lord was sold, in various Ink Writing his history, who did dispence Such favour to him, more then Heart could think. In every of the Five he paints Five-pence, So sums the Thirty by a Cinque-fold Cinque; Accounting that which is the Center, twise, Of the five Cinques, which he doth place Cross-wise. 55 Some time after he gave this grand defeat Th'illustrious King (whose Thoughts to Heaven soare) To take in Leyria marcht; which Those, He beat, Had took from Him a little while before. To boot, the strong Arronchez he doth get: And, with her pleasant Vale, the evermore Glorious Scabelicastro (Santaréne) Which Thou, sweet Tagus, waterst so serene. 56 Unto these noble Towns reduc't, he soon Adds Mafra, dar'd by his victorious Wings; Then, in the famous Mountains of the Moon Cold Syntra (forc'd) to his obedience brings: Syntra, in which the Nayades do run From the sweet Snare, hiding themselves in Springs. But Love hath Nets will there too serve their turn: And in the water will his wild fire burn. 57 And Thou, fair Lisbon (worthy to be crown'd Of all the Cities of the World the Queen) Which that great Prince of Eloquence did found, Who by his wit Troy-Town had ruin'd seen; Thou (whom obeys the Ocean-Sea profound) By the brave Portingalls wer't taken in, Helpt by a potent Fleet, which at that time Happen'd to come out of the Northern Clime: 58 Thence, from the German Elve, and from the Rhene, And from the Brittish-Sea-commanding Theames, Sent to destroy th'usurping Saracen, And free their sister Jordan's captive streames. These, entring Tagus's pleasant mouth, and then With great Alphonso joyn'd (whose Glory's beames Attract all Hearts, but those his name appalls) A Seige is laid to th'Ulyssean Walls. 59 Five times the Moon did hide her horned head, And other five her face at full displayd; When by main force the City entered The will of the Beleaguerer obayd. Fierce was the Battail, much the blood there shed, As needs they must be (circumstances waigh'd) Between rough Conquerours, That all things dare, And conquer'd People driven to despaire. 60 Thus Shee, was after some few Months expence Compell'd to stoop to this new Victor's law; Whom in old time to their obedience, With all their might cold Vandals could not draw: Whose pow'r (which own'd no bound, stuck at no Fence) Eere, and Golden Tagus, trembling saw: And Betis they did so entirely tame, They did that Land Vandalusia name. 61 If noble Lisbon could not stand it out, Where is that City so resolv'd, and strong, That can resistance make to such a stout And warlike people (Fame's immortall song) Now all Estremadura's at his Foot, Oeidos fair, Alenquer proud (among Whose pleasant Groves runs many a River sweet, Murm'ring, as if too good to wash their Feet) And Torresuedras. 62 You likewise, O ye fair Trans-Tagan Lands (Which golden Ceres with her Bounty crowns) Hee, who brings more then Mortall strength, commands Out of your Forts, and Arms. And you (the Clowns Of Affrica) who plough'd them with your hands, Hope not to reap the Fruits: For the good Towns. Of Moura, Serpa, Yelves, by assault Are taken, and Alcacer Of The Salt. 63 Lo! now that noble City (certain Seat Of the brave Rebell in old time, Sertorius; Where still his far-fetcht Water pure and neat, To serve the place b'an act so meritorious Through Arches on Two hundred Pillars set Doth pass, with Royall restauration glorious) Ev'n Her, the bold Gerardo's prowess brings To own, and serve, the Lusitanian Kings. 64 Against the City now of Beya, To take revenge for spoyl'd Trancoso's Town, Alphonso goes; who cannot rest a Day For ymping a short life with long Renown. Before this City long he doth not stay; And (storming it b' a part that's beaten down) Enraged enters: where, of all that breathes, His hungry Steel he in the Bowels sheathes. 65 Jointly with these, Palmela doth he win; Fishy Cizimbra too: nor wins alone, But (his good star assisting him therein) A potent Army there hath overthrowne. The Town saw his intent, so did her King: Nor was he backward to relieve the Towne. Careless he marcht along the Mountain-side, Little imagining what did betide. 66 'Twas He of Badachoz (a haughty More) Four thousand furious Spirits were his Horse, Of Infantry innumerable store, With gilded Arms (Gallants, and Warriors) But, as in May a jealous Bull (before He is perceiv'd) rushes with all his force Upon a Travailer, and runs him over, (Twice mad, both as a Beast, and as a Lover): 67 Just so Alphonso, from an Ambush close, Assaults the people that securely past; Strikes, overturns, and kills; The Field he mows; The Moorish King flyes for his life in hast. Struck vvith a Pannick fear, the Remnant throvvs Avvay their Arms; and follovvs him as fast: They That made all this Havock, being a Force (Good God!) consisting but of sixty Horse. 68 The Victory vvithout delay, the great And indefatigable King pursues, Causing his Drums through all the Realm to beat (Conqu'ring of Lands he as his Trade doth use) Besiegeth Badachoz, and soon doth get The end of his desire: For there he shevvs So much of Souldier, and a Soul so high; That keep, It must the others company. 69 But the great GOD (vvho keeps his Rods in store, For such as merit them, till his ovvn time; Whether, for Sinners to amend, before They fall: or Causes, Man can not divine) If he, till now, the valiant King forbore, And (through all dangers leading) gave him line: Yet now, he vvill no longer let him be, From his imprison'd Mother's curses, free. 70 For lying in this City weakly man'd, The Leon-Men besiege th'ill-guarded Walls, 'Cause he that Conquest took out of their Hand, Being of Leon, and not Portugal's. Here dear did Him his Pertinacy stand, As in the World out oftentimes it falls: For in a furious Sally (his leg burst Against an Iron) he to yield was forc't. 71 O famous Pompey! Be not Thou in pain To see thy Glories's sad Catastrophie; Or that just Nemesis should pre-ordain Thy Father-in-Law to triumph over Thee; Though frozen Phasis; and Bootes's Wayn; The Land under the Burning Axle-Tree; And strange Syene, where no oblique Sun A Shadow casts, and all the day is Noon; 72 And Eniochians fierce; and Arabs rich; And Colchos, famous for the Golden Sheep; And Cappadoceans; and Judeans, which Abolisht Rites so obstinately keep, And soft Sophena, scurft with pleasures Itch; And (with Silician-Robbers on the Deep) Armenia, That two Rivers boasts, which came From Paradise; All trembled at thy name: 73 And though, in fine, from the Atlantick-Sea To Scythian-Taurus with erected Crown, Victorious: Wonder not, that thou shouldst be In the Pharsalian Battail overthrown. For high and great Alphonso thou shalt see Bear All before him, and at last bourn down. By a Cross-match of Fate were Both undon, Thou by a Father-In-Law, He by a Son-. 74 The noble King thus scourg'd by Heav'n, at length Restor'd was to his Portugal again. There (after he had been; by a vast strength Of Moors, in Santaren besieg'd in vain; And, after that the Corps of St. Vincenth The Martyr, from that Head of Land in Spain Which by his name to all the world is known, Translated was to th'Ulyssean Town.) 75 To carry on the Work by Him begun, The old man (weary) doth his Son command With men and warlike preparation To march into the Alenteian-Land. Sancho (to prove himself his Fathers Son) Like a strong stream let loose, passes beyand: And makes the River of Guadalquiveer Run Moorish blood, That wont to run so cleer. 76 Flesht with his winnings, the young Gamester grows Now Covetous; and cannot rest, before He in a second Battail overthrows (In sight of Beia) the beleagu'ring More. Nor long with this design in labour goes E're he the Bays by Him desired Wore. The Moor (on both sides justled to the Wall) Resolves at once to be reveng'd for all. 77 Now, from the Mountain which Medusa star'd Out of that Body which the Heav'n sustayn'd, From Ampelusa's Promontory, hard They march; from Tanger, where Anteus raign'd. Of Avila the dwellers are not spar'd: Doth likewise march (well-arm'd, and choicely train'd) At the harsh Mauritanian Trumpet's sound Of noble Juba all the Kingdom round. 78 With this huge mass of men his inroad made The great Miramolin in Portugal. Twelve Moorish Kings he carryed in his Ayd, 'Mongst whom He wears the Crown Imperial. These, having in their march by Parties prey'd, And, where they could, destroy'd the Countrey all, In Santaren Don Sancho close impound: But a sad Seige it will for them be found. 79 Furious assaults th'incensed Moor doth make: A thousand Stratagems in practice puts. In vain huge Stones from horrid Engins brake: In vain the Mine is hid, and the Ram buts. Alphonso's Son is everywhere awake, Here his Care Sheilds, and there his courage cuts. So what with these, and what with martial Art, Stopt is each Meuse, and guarded in each part. 80 But the old man (whose burthen'd Lims, and Head, With years, and Cares, oblig'd him to repose) Retir'd into that City, whose fair Mead To sweet Mondego's streams its verdure ows; Hearing his Son is close beleaguered In Santaren by blind and barb'rous Foes, Flyes from that City to his Ayd: For Age Cramps not his wonted speed, nor cools his rage. 81 He, with his Troops inur'd to warlike Feats, Thund'ring the Reare, and his Son salying out; The Portingal (who now of custom beats) In a short space the Moors doth wholly rout. With Terbants, Cassacks, Faulchions, Coverlets, Cloaks with wrought Capes, the Field is strew'd about: Horses, and their Caparisons (rich Prey) And by the Horses their dead Masters lay. 82 The Lusitanian Bounds the rest forego, Put to a hasty and disordred flight. The great Miramolin, he flyes not though: For before he could flye, he fled the light. To Him, who did this Victory bestow Are rendred thanks and Praises infinite: For in so great, and so apparent odds, The part man acts is the dumb shew to God's. 83 This was the great Alphonso's latest wreath Of Victory (a Prince of vast Renown) When He who forg'd it with his Sword (his breath Deserting him) exchang'd his Mortal Crown. The hand of sickness ush'ring that of death, Toucht his weak Body, and so pusht it down. Thus, whom so many had paid Tribute to, Paid the last tribute unto Nature due. 84 Him did the lofty Promontories moan: With all their streams the widow'd Rivers wept, And (overflowing the Fields, newly sown, With rueful Tears) the next years Harvest swept. But through the world his living Fame is blown: And, where he raign'd, his name so fresh is kept; That there each Hill, and ev'ry ecchoing Plain, Alfonso calls, Alphonso—But in vain. 85 Sancho succeeds (valiant, and in his Spring) True Copy of his Sire, examin'd well By the Original, alive yet being When he with barb'rous blood made Betis swell; And overturn'd the Andalusian King Of the accursed Race of Ishmael: But better; when at Beja's siege he made Them feel the weight of his Victorious Blade. 86 After he ware the Lusitanian Crown (Some years elaps'd since he to reign began) Before the City Silves he sat down Then in possession of the Affrican. Assisted was he to take in this Town By Strangers from the Northern Ocean, With Men, and Arms, for ASIA bound: to joyne In rescue of distressed Palestine. 87 They sayld, to second in the Holy Cause Red Fredrick; who with a potent Hoast To the defence of that plagu'd City draws, By which the Lord Of Life his own life lost: When Guida with his Troops (having their jaws Parcht up with drowth) to the Great Soldan forst Were to surrender, where the Miscreants Have prepossest the Springs which Guido wants. 88 But the fair Navie (forc't upon our shore By adverse Winds, though Sancho's prosperous Star) Assists him willingly against the More, Since one and t'other is a Holy War. As thy great Father, Lisbon took before; Just so, and with the same Auxiliar, From the fierce dwellers tak'st Thou, Silves: This Also, a noble Realm's Metropolis. 89 And, if from the Mahumetans thou hast So many trophies; neither didst thou let The men of Leon (though in Mountains plac't, And nurst in bloody Battail) quiet set: Till thou a Yoke upon the Neck hadst cast Of their proud Tui, adding a Coronet Of Towns her Neighbours, on which Thou didst put (Renowned Sancho) thy triumphant Foot. 90 But death (like a bold Thiefe) did Him assault In his Career of glory. He was heyr'd B'a Son whom many Vertues did exalt: Second Alphonso, of our Kings the Therd. In his Raign was Alcacer Of The Salt Subdu'de again in spight of the Moor's Beard; By whom late took, 'tis now re-took, with great Destruction of them, and four Kings's defeat. 91 Alfonso dead, The Second Sancho came To hold the Scepter; Tame, and negligent: To that degree both negligent, and tame, That for the shadow of Himself he went. Then did Another (fitter for the same) Wrest from his hands that pow'r, he was content To delegate. And why? He having none Himself, his Minion's Crimes were call'd his owne. 92 No, no, our Sancho was not of that mood Lewd Nero was, who married with a Boy; And after (with less guilt he shed her blood) His mother Agrippina did injoy: Nor (like the self-same Nero) piping stood, Then clapt his hands to see his burning Troy: Nor did his daughter, like one King, devour: Nor change his Sex like t'other Emperour. 93 He did not o're his People tyrannize, Like Those who Kings in Syracusa were: Nor hyr'd he men, strange Tortures to devise, Like Phalaris, one of the Tyrants there. But the proud Realm, which too indulgent skyes Had us'd to Kings, who would indure no Peere; That likewise to such niceness did arrive T'indure no King, who had his Peer alive. 94 Therefore Bolonia's Earl the Helm did guide: Which he did after in his own right hold, When his still-sloathful Brother (Sancho) dy'de. He (nam'd Alphonso, and surnam'd the Bold) After he had the Kingdom pacify de; And all sharp humors setled, or controlld; Thinks, how he may enlarge it by his merit: Too small a Circle for so great a spirit. 95 Of the Algarves's land (the conquering Whereof was giv'n him with his Queen in dow'r) He gains in much, outing the Moorish King; On all whose Actions now curst Mars did low'r. But out of Portugal did wholly fling (By Prudence part, and part by martial pow'r.) That pertinacious People, and did chace From that good Land which Lusus left his Race. 96 Now, Denis! worthy his own Parentage: And for whom such a Father should make room. Denis! Who strikes (in the way of Patronage) The fame of Alexander's bounty, dumbe. The Land got breath, and flourisht in that Age (Mild Peace, and, with peace, Justice from Heav'n come) With Constitutions, Laws, and Customes right: Of a calm Kingdome Luminaries bright. 97 He, was the first That made Coymbra shine With Lib'ral Sciences which Pallas taught; By Him, from Helicon the Muses Nine To bruize Mondego's grassie brink were brought; Hither transferr'd Apollo that rich Mine, Which the old Greeks in learned Athens wrought; Here Ivy-Wreaths with Gold he interweaves, And the coy Daphne's never-fading leaves. 98 Now noble Cities from the ground ascend, Castles, and warlike Fortresses secure; Scarce any Corner but this Prince doth mend: Convents he builds, and Towns he doth immure. But Atropos (the Best must have an End) Shearing his golden Thrid in years mature, His Son succeeds; not dutiful (the Fourth Alphonse) but of high courage, and much worth. 99 On proud Casteel he still with Scorn did look: Yet free from malice as 'twas free from feares, Onely men have a custom, in that Nook, To dread no pow'r for being more then theirs. For when the Mauritanian undertook Hesperia's second Conquest; and appeares Just ready now Castilians to invade: The brave Alphonso pow'rs in to their Ayd: 100 Never Semiramis with such an Hoast Did swarm Hydaspes's banks, his Sands out-number; Nor Attila (He, who Himself did boast The Scourge of GOD, and was the fright, and wonder Of Italy) so many Goths ingrost And Northern People: As of Moors were under The Affrick-Moor (with Those Granada yields) At that time mustred in Tartessian Fields. 101 Then the Castilian King (who saw so great And vast a pow'r, against his Countrey bend; Nor weigh'd his life, but the intire defeat Of Spain itself (once lost) did apprehend) Help from the valiant Portingall t'intreat, His dearest Consort to that Court did send: His Wife from whom the Embassie is sent, And his dear daughter unto whom it went. 102 Vertuous Maria, and as fair as good, Enters her Father's Palace (glorious dame!) Lovely, in Grief; nor, though the water stood In her sweet eyes, did that suspend their flame. Her Angel's Tresses with a golden flood Coverd her Ivory shoulders. When she came Before her Sire (He overjoyd and kind) It rain'd down right, and thus she brake her mind. 103 As many Nations as all Affrick bred (A People barbarous and inhumane) Hath the great King of the Morocco's led To take possession of illustrious Spain. So vast a pow'r ne're marcht under one Head Since the dry Earth was compast by the Main. It terrifies the living where it rolls, And ev'n alarums their dead Father's Souls. 104 His frighted subjects to protect and skreen, He, whom thou hast my Lord and Husband made, Stands with small strength exposed to the keen And thirsty edges of the Moorish Blade; And I shall soon depriv'd of all be seen, If thou afford him not thy present ayd: A sad and private Woman, Husbandless. Without a Crown, or Him, or Happiness. 105 Therefore (O King) for very fear of whom The streams of hot Maluco do congeale; Succour, O! quickly to the succour come Of miserable and despis'd Castele. If that deare smile be an assenting dumb, If that thy fatherly affection seal. Run Father; if thou do not, by the More I fear thou'lt find it over-run before. 106 This with the self-same tone Maria said To King Alphonso on her trembling knees, With which sad Venus once her Father pray'd For her Eneas tost on Lybian Seas; At which, with sense of the deep moan she made, Such tender pitty did Jove's bowels seize, (Indulgent Sire!) he let his Thunder fall, And (griev'd she askt no more) granted her all. 107 Streight armed Squadrons, glitt'ring in the Sun, Are mustred in the Fields of Ebora: Scowr'd is the Sword, the Lance, the Murrion: In rich Caparisons the Horses neigh. The Trumpet shrill, with pendant Banner done, Rowzes from peaces down (where long they lay) Their tickled Hearts to disaccustomed Arms; And concave Drums go thund'ring fresh Alarms. 108 Amongst them and above them All appeers Higher by head and shoulders then the rest (And where He goes the Royal Standart veers) Valiant Alphonso with erected Crest. His very look, it animates and cheers (If there are any) ev'n the Coward's Brest. Into Casteel thus marching is he seen With his fair daughter, the Castilian Queen. 109 The two Alphonso's in conclusion joynd, In wide Tarypa's Fields confronting stood The endless numbers of the people blind For vvhom too narrovv are both Plain and Wood. Of ours not one so hardy, but did find Somevvhat of cold and shiv'ring in his blood, Save onely such as cleerly understands Christ fights the battail vvith his People's hands. 110 Derided are the thin-spread Christian-Bands By Bond-Mayd Hagar's Progeny unclean; Who, by anticipation, all their lands Divide amongst the Army Hagarene, Which by false Title in possession stands Of the illustrious Name of Saracene: Just as Another's noble Land they boast Now, for their own; reck'ning without their Host. 111 As that big-bon'd and barb'rous Gyant (whom King Saul so fear'd, and all his Army worse) Seeing a simple Swain against him come, Onely with Peebles arm'd, and a clean force, With haughty language (arrogant and grum) Scorns the poor Boy, and sends him to his Nurse; Whom rounding with his sling, He taught at length The diff'rence betwixt Faith, and humane strength. 112 So the perfidious Moor (advancing) cracks Over the Christian Hoast; nor understands What Pow'r it is that their weak Powers backs, Which Hell with all its Fiends in vain withstands. Helpt by that Pow'r, He of Casteel attacks Morocco's King, who there in Chief commands: The Portingal (who sleights their whole Armada) He takes to Task the Kingdom of Granada. 113 Now crack the Lances, and the Swords cry clink Upon the Armours, Pow'rs incountring Pow'rs; Invoking (when they stand on danger's brink) Theirs Mahomet, and St. Iago ours. The strook strike Heav'n with Cries, making a sink And standing Pool with thick Vermilion show'rs: Where some (half dead) lye drowning where they stood In too much now, who fell for want of blood. 114 With so great blood-shed did the Portingal Make Spoyl and Havock of the Granadine, That in small space he kills, or routs, them All, 'Spight of their Mayles and breast-plates of steel fine. His hungry Blade which will to supper fall In Fez, if in th'Alhambra it did dine) The brave Castilian helps to end the Fray: Who hath the Mauritanian at a Bay. 115 The burning Sun was making his retreat To Thetys's grotts, and the bright Ev'ning Star Drawing that glorious day to it's red Set, Whose memory no time shall ever bar: When the two Kings consummate the defeat Of the Moors's Powers assembled in this War, With so much Tragick slaughter, as no Age Beheld before, or since, on the World's Stage. 116 Not a fourth part rough Marius slew, of Those That lost their lives in this day's Victory, When water dasht with blood of their dead Foes He made his Army drink, which then was dry: Nor He of Carthage (sworn, a child, t'oppose With Fire and Sword the Pride of Italy) When he so many Knights kill'd famous Rome, That their Rings tane did to three Bushels come. 117 And if Thou (noble Titus) couldst alone So many souls to black Cocytus send, When thou the Holy City didst unstone Of that stiff People, never to be wean'd From their abolisht Rytes: This GOD did owne, And christned it his Act, that what was pen'd By the Old Prophets might be verify'de, And JESUS said too, whom they Crucify'de. 118 After this great and prosperous event (Alfonso come to Portugall again, There to injoy in peace and sweet content The spreading Glories he in War did gain) A black and lamentable accident (Worthy in Fame's Memorials to remain) Was on a miserable Lady seen, Who, after she was dead, was made a Queen. 119 Thou, onely Thou (pure Love) with bended bow, Against whose Force no brest whate're can hold, As if thy perjur'd Subject, or Sworn Foe, Did'st cause her death whom all the World condol'd. If Tears (which from a troubled Fountain flow) Quench not thy Thirst, as hath been said of old; It is, that such is thy tyrannick mood, Thou lov'st thy Altars should be bath'd in blood. 120 Thou wer't (fair Ynes) in Repose, of Love's Reflected Fires fost'ring the sweet heat, young; In that sweet Error, that worse Fates removes, Which Fortune never suffers to last long: In sweet Mondego's solitary Groves, Whose streams no day but thou didst weep among: Teaching the lofty Trees, and humble Grass, That Name which printed in thy bosom was. 121 Thy pensive Prince, with thine did sympathize Remembrances, which in his Soul did swim, Bringing thee always fresh before his Eyes, When, from thy fair ones, bus'ness banisht Him: By night, in dreams; that cheat him with sweet lyes: By day, in thoughts; that pencil thy each lim: And all he mus'd, and all he saw in fine, Were dear Idea's of thy Form divine. 122 Of other Ladies fair, and Princesses The tend'red Matches he did vilifie; For, of a Heart 'tis hard to dispossess True Love, that hath had time to fortifie. Upon these highly am'rous passages The Father looking with an old man's Eye (Enrag'd with what the common-people sed And his Son's resolution not to wed) 123 Ynes determines from the World to take, His Son from Her to take, and to remove: Believing, with her blood's ill let-out Lake, To quench the kindled flames of constant love. O! that sure Sword (which had the pow'r to make The Moorish Rage strike saile) what Rage could move Thee, from the honor'd Sheaths, where thou did'st rest, To be new sheath'd in Lady's gentle Brest? 124 The horrid blood-hounds dragg'd her to the King: Whose bowels now to mercy stood inclin'd. But ill-Advisers with false reasoning To her destruction re-inflam'd his mind. Shee (with Heart-breaking language which did spring Onely from sense of Those she left behind In solitude, her Prince, and children deare, Whose Griefe she more, then her own death did feare:) 125 Lifting unto the azure Firmament Her Eyes, which in a Sea of Tears were drown'd; Her Eyes, for one of those malevolent And bloody Instruments her hands had bound; And then, the same on her dear Infants bent, Who Them with smiling innocence surround By whom poor Orphans they will streight be made Unto their cruel Grand-Father thus said. 126 If Beasts themselves (wild Beasts) whose use, and way, By Nature's dire instinct, is not to spare; And vagrant Birds, whose bus'ness 'tis, to prey, And chace their Quarrey through the yielding Ayre; The world hath seen take Babes expos'd, and play The tender Nurses to them with their care, As Ninus's mother once it did befall, And the Twinn-Founders of the Roman Wall: 127 O Thou, whose Superscription speaks thee, Man (That the Contents were suited to the Cover! A feeble Maid thou wouldst not murther than Onely for loving Him, who first did love her) Pitty these Babes (the babes about him ran) In thy hard doom since I am spot all over. Spare, for their sakes, their lives, and mine: And see Whiteness in Them, though thou wilt not in Me. 128 And if (subduing the presumptuous More, How to give death with fire and sword thou know'st, Know, to give life too, to a damsel poore, Who hath done nothing why it should be lost. Let my hid Innocence thus much procure: Exile me to some sad intemperate Coast, Cold Scythia, or burn't Lybia, to remain A weeping Tomb, and never more see Spain. 129 Plant me where nothing grows but Cruelty, 'Mongst Lyons, Bears, and other Savage Beasts: To see, if They that mercy will deny Which I in vain implore from humane Breasts. There, in firm love to Him for whom I dye, I'l breed his Pieces, thou here seest, their guests And my Companions; to slide off with Those Part of the burthen of their mother's woes. 130 Fain would have pardon'd her the gracious King, Mov'd with these words, which made his Bowels yearn: But Fate, and whisp'rers (That fresh Fewel bring) They would not pardon. 'Tis those mens concern (Having begun) to perpetrate the Thing. They strip their steel out of the Scabbard (stern). Out Villains! Butchers! What? imploy your spights, Your swords, against a Lady, and call'd Knights? 131 As at the breast of fair Polixena Condemn'd to death by dire Achilles's shade (The last dear stake of Aged Hecuba) Revengeful Pyrrhus bent his cruel Blade; But with a look that drives ill Ayrs away (Patient, as any Lamb) The Royal Maid, On her mad Mother casting up her Eys, Presents her self a Sacrifice, and dyes: 132 So gentle Ynes's bruitish Murtherers, Ev'n in that Neck (white Atlas of that Head Whose stars, thought set, had influence o're the pow'rs Of Him, That crown'd her after she was dead) Bathing their thirsty Swords, and all the flow'rs Which her fair Eyes had newly watered (Mindless of the insuing Vengeance) stood Like crimson'd Hunters reeking with her blood. 133 Well mightst Thou Phebus from an Act so dire (Pyrous starting) have reverst thy look; As from Thyestes's Table, when the Sire Din'd on the Son, the Uncle being the Cook. You, hollow Vales (which, when she did expire, From her cold lips the dying accents took) Hearing her Pedro nam'd with her last breath, Form'd Pedro, Pedro, after Ynes's death. 134 Like a svveet Rose (vvith party-colours fair) By Virgin's hand beheaded in the Bud To play vvithal, or prick into her Hair, When (sever'd from the stalk on vvhich it stood) Both Scent and beauty vanish into Ayre: So lies the Damzel vvithout breath, or Blood, Her Cheeks fresh Roses ravisht from the Root Both red and white, and the svveet life to boot. 135 This Act of horrour, and black night obscure, Mondego's daughters long resented deep; And, for a lasting Tomb, into a pure Fountain, transformd the Teares which they did weep. The name, they gave it (which doth still indure) Was Ynes's loves, whom Pedro there did keep. No wonder, such sweet Streams water those Flowers: Teares, are the substance; and the Name, A-mours. 136 It was not long ere Pedro found the way To that Revenge which in his breast did boyle; For, taking in his hands the Kingdom's sway Hee takes it on the Murd'rers (who chang'd soyle) With licence of another Pedro. They (Partners in mischief) having made that vile And bloody pact, Augustus did with those He was new Friends with, of exchanging Foes. 137 A rigorous Chastizer was this King Of Thefts, of Murthers, and Adultries blind, The Ill to condigne punishment to bring Was the delight and banquet of his mind. Restraining Cities with rough disciplin, From Vice and Insolence of every kind, He gave more Robbers their deserved meed Then wandring Thesus, or Alcides, did. 138 From the just Pedro, and severe (Behold How Nature sometimes can prevaricate!) Sprang the remisse, the Carelesse, the sheep-sold Fernando: who set all of a Flame straight. Whence the Castilian entring uncomptrold, Went wasting so the weake disnerved State, That at last gaspe it lay: For its seen oft, “A soft King makes a valiant People, soft. 139 Whether it were God's Judgement, for his sin Of taking from her Husband Leonore, And marrying Her; besotten with her win- Ning looks, and by his Flattring Casuists more; Or that faynt Vice (through custom soaking in Into his Breast, thence breathing through each pore) Made him all Pap within: For, tis as true, “Vnlawfull fires make Valiant Kings soft too. 140 “Lust oft hath brought great men to great mishap: God that permitting, and ordaining thus. Witness th'Abettors of fair Helen's Rape: King-Tarquin, and Triumvir-Appius. Why could not holy David judgement scape? Why was destroy'd the Tribe illustrious Of Benjamin? Dinah cost Sichem deer: Nor (Sarah onely wisht) went Pharoah cleer. 141 Then, whether manly Bosoms melt, or not, With fires that are not kindled from Above; Alcmena's Son (who ware a Petticot To please Omphale) well may serve to prove: And Anthony, who lost the fame he got, And the World's Crown for Cleopatra's love. And Thou of Carthage, in full conquest stayd By stumbling on a mean Appulian mayd. 142 But who is priviledg'd from the sweet snare Which Love so subt'ly weaves, and hides it (oh!) In Damask Roses, in bright auburn haire, Transparent alablaster, and warm Snow? Who, from the poyson'd Arrows of the Faire? From a Medusa's head (I term it so) That turns the hearts of them whom she doth tame, Not into Stone (then it were well) but flame? 143 Who sees a crystal Brow, a piercing look, A lushious, and Seraphick excellence, (Transforming Soules into it) That can brook The object, or pretend the least defence? All That have swallow'd Love's bewitching Hook, With poor Fernando's frailty will dispence: And some (as when Mars seen in courser snares The Gods did once) ev'n wish his case were Theirs. End of the third Canto. Fourth Canto. 1 After a pitchie, and a dripping night, Poor Travailers confounding in their way, A glorious Morn (succeeding) glads the sight; And, with the long'd-for Sun, returns the day: After the whistling winds have spent their spight, On the calm'd Sea the wanton Dolphins play: So the afflicted Kingdom it befell When soft Fernando bade the world farewel. 2 And if ours wisht a Champion, to fullfil Their Vengeance upon Those, from whom alone (Using remiss Fernando's favours ill) They make account that all their Ills are grown. Now they I have one according to their will, Putting illustrious John into the Throne, As Pedro's onely Son they could come at: And his true Son, though Illegitimat. 3 That this was Heaven's Ordinance divine By most cleer Tokens evident became, When a young girl, speaking before her time, In Ebora distinctly form'd his name. And as a Herald-Angel sent in fine The Portingall Successour to proclame Lifting i'th'Cradle Body, Hand, and Tone, Cry'd, Portugal For The New King Don John. 4 Such, at this time, was the confus'd Estate Of the poor Realm, and the mad People's spleen; That (to disburthen their conceived Hate) Flat Cruelties in ev'ry part were seen: Killing the Kin, and all that did relate To the adult'rous Earl, and to the Queen, With whom her lewdness (they affirm'd) was more In widowhood, then it had been before. 5 But true, or false, the scandal which they gave Forfeits his Head (and rightly) to the Axe. He dyes for't in her presence: Others have The self-same sawce. It catches like fir'd flax. One, whom religious Orders could not save, Thrown from a Steeple like Astianax: A Second, Orders, Sex, nor th' Altar's Horn: A third dragg'd naked, and to mamocks torn. 6 In long forgetfullness may now be laid Those horrid Massacres, which Rome beheld, By bloody Sylla, and fierce Marius, made, When one another they by turns expel'd. Then Leonóre (whom th'unrevenged shade Of her dear Count with open fury swell'd) Invites Casteel, who did her daughter wed: Saying, the Crown belongeth to her head. 7 Her daughter Beatrice was she, as due To whom, he of Casteel that Crown might clame: Reputed daughter of Fernando too, With the permission of her mother's Fame. Into the Field Castilia therefore drew, To seize the Kingdom in his Consort's name, Amassing men (our Spot to overwhelm) From every Province of his spacious Relm. 8 Troops came (on this occasion) from that Land To which one Brigus gave his name of yore: From Lands recover'd (by their Great Fernand, And greater Cid) from the usurping More. Nor those, who high in Mars his favour stand, Who with their Ploughs (laborious) travaile o're The Hills of Leon, slowly did advance: The ancient Terror of the Moorish Lance. 9 The Vandals came, who to this day confide In Valour which of old they made appeer. Sevilia came (Andaluzia's Pride) So sweetly water'd by Guadalquiveer. The noble Island (which was colonied Sometime by Tyrians) was not wanting here, Who, on their Banners in those days of yore The famous Pillars of Alcides bore. 10 Came likewise Troops from old Toledo's Reame, Whose nimble Tongue the nearest Spanish trolls: And Tagus clasps her with his amorous streame, Which from the Hills of Cuenca sweetly rolls. Nor fear kept you from being joyn'd to Them, Sordid Gallegos (refractory Souls!) That arm your selves again, those swords t'oppose, Of which already ye have felt the blows. 11 Likewise black Furies of the war drives an The Biskayner, A mortal enemy To Complement; nor of a Heart, that can From any stranger brook an injury: He of Guipuscua, and th' Asturian: Fam'd for their Yron-Indies far and nigh: These (arm'd with their own Mines) conducted are To serve their Lord in the denounced War. 12 John, from whose manly Bosom's bristles, grew That courage, Sampson borrow'd of his hairs, Though all his men amount but to a Few, To play the best of a bad Game prepares. Nor, that he's unresolved what to do, Calls the cheif Counsellors in his Affaires; But, to observe how every one inclines: “For among many there are many minds. 13 There want no such, as, ev'n against that Cause They follow, Reasons do insinuate: Whose sence with a Castilian Byas draws From all that's Portingal degenerate. Whom Fear so freezes, and so overaws, That natural love it doth exterminate. Their King, and Countrey, they deny: and wou'd With Peter too, for fear deny their God. 14 Don Nunio (to be sure) was none of Those: But though his Brothers (whom he deerly lov'd) Take t'other side, and big the danger grows, Them whose Faith staggers sharply he reprov'd; And at these People with their I's, and No's; Laying his Hand upon his Hilt (more mov'd Then Eloquent) these words abruptly hurl'd: Threatning the Earth, the Ocean, and the world. 15 What? 'Mongst the Portingal-Nobility Shall there be any less then Sons of Mars? What? in this Realm (victorious far and nigh) Shall there be born, That shun defensive wars? That will their Hearts, their Hands, their Heads deny At such a pinch, their Fortunes, and their Stars? Or who, for any cause that can be thought, Will see their Countrey in subjection brought. 16 What? Are not you then of those worthies bred, Who (fierce and valiant as the Swords they wore) Under the great Henriquez Standart led, O'rethrew this warlike Nation once before? When Them so many routed Squadrons fled, So many Flaggs, that (besides thousands more Of lesser Rank, amongst the opulent Prey) Sev'n potent Earles our Pris'ners were that day? 17 With whom, perpetually were trodden down These, That are now so dreadful in your view, By Denis, and, his Son, of high Renown, But with your Sires, and Grandsires? and if you Were (by the Sins, or weakness, of the Crown) Kept under, in Fernando's days; Renew Your strength with the new King: “For 'tis not strange “(You see) for People with their Kings to change. 18 Ye have one now, that, if your courage rose Equal with his You lifted to the Throne, Ye might o'rethrow the World, how much more Those, Whom ye have oft already overthrown? And if, in short, with Him ye cannot lose Those fears, that seem t'have turn'd you into stone; Stand but like stones (I ask you not one stroke) Whilst I alone resist a forraign yoak. 19 I onely, with my Tenants, and with this— (And at that word he pull'd out half his Blade) Will save from force, and all that shameful is, This Land, which hitherto hath liv'd a Maid. By the King's fire, and mine (lighted at his): Our Countrey's Tears: By Faith (by you not vvaigh'd): Not onely These upon their knees I'l bring, But All that ever shall oppose my King. 20 As when, despairing now, the Youth of Rome (All that survived Cannæ's fatal Field) Stood ready (rallyed in Canusium) Themselves unto the Conquerour to yield, But young Cornelius doth amongst them come, And swears them All upon his sword, compel'd; That they the Roman wars shall never leave, Till life leave them, or Those their lives bereave: 21 So Nunio animates, whom he did force. Whose boyst'rous Rhet'rick such quick flame imparts, Chiefly the Tail and sting of his discourse, As thaws those fears that had congeal'd their hearts. And presently they call to Horse, to Horse, Tossing about their heads Lances, and Darts. They run: and live (with open mouth they cry) The famous King that gives us Liberty! 22 Amongst the fiercer Commons, some up-cry This war, by which their Countrey is assoyl'd: Others scowr up their Armours, and supply What with the rust of peace was eate, and spoyl'd: These, stuff old Murrions; Those, new breast-plates try: Each takes those Arms, he hath most skill to wield. With sev'ral colour'd Garments, others flaunt: Others, Love-Motto's, and devices paint. 23 With all this well-appointed Company, Doth valiant John from fresh Abrantes go: Abrantes, which injoys abundantly The streams, from Cuenca's frozen Caves that flow. The well-arm'd Vanguard is commanded by One, who was fit t'have led against a Foe Those Oriental Forces without Compt, With which King Xerxes past the Hellespont. 24 Don Nunio Alvarez, I mean: the true And fatal scourge of proud Castilians, No less, then once the valiant Hun was to The ancient Gaulls, and the Italians. Another Knight (to whom much praise is due) Leads the right wing of Lusitanians: As skilfull to conduct, as bold in fight, Of Vasconcetos Mem Rodriguez, hight. 25 The other wing, that corresponds with this, Antonio Vasquez of Almaad commands, Who after Conde of Abranchez is: And Hee comes up with the Sinestre Bands. In the Roer-Gard the Standart none can miss, Where (Circling Portugal) Castilia Stands; With Iohn, accomplished in every part: Who makes a dunce of Mars in his own Art. 26 Trembling upon the Battlements, and een Cold (betwixt hope and feare suspended now) Wives, Mothers, Sisters, Mistresses, are seen. Prayers they preferr: Fasts, Pilgrimages, vow. Our Troops (advancing with undaunted meen) Down by the Foe they sit them, brow to brow; Receiv'd with shouts, which rock the Firmament: Yet one, &amp; t'other, doubted the event. 27 The vocall Trumpets challenge, and accept: The Drumms, and whistling Fifes in consort joyne. The dusty Field the flourisht Ensigns swept, Where all the Colours of the Rainbow shine. It was the time, when, Ceres's fruits being reapt, She lends her Lab'rers to the God of Wine: When (into Libra entred August's Sun) Plump Bacchus put sweet Must into the Tun. 28 Castilian Trumpets did the On-set sound, Loud, furious dismall, terrible, and hoarce Heard it Artabor's Mount, and underground Her way did frighted Guadiana force: Heard it the Dvvere, and Alentecho round: Tagus looks back, then hastens on his course: And Mothers (who that baylefull noysedid heare) Claspe to their Breasts their tender Babes for feare. 29 How many Cheeks were there discolourd seen, Whilst to the Heart the frendlie blood repaird? “In great Incounters greater is I ween “The feare of danger, then the danger feard: “But, when the first brunt's over, Rage, and Teen, “Desire of honour, and to Plume the Beard “Of a proud Foe; These take away the sence “Of losing limbs, or dearest life's expence. 30 On either side the first Battalions move: The doubtfull war on either side began: These fighting for their Country, which they love; Those, to possess another's if they can. The great Pereyra, first his force did prove: Summing an Armie's valour in one Man. Hee shocks, strikes down, in fine he makes, their Grave, And with their Corpses sows the Land they crave. 31 Now through the darkned Ayre barbd Arrows fleet, Javelins, with other shott, fly whizzing round; Vnder the fiery Coursers's yron Feet The Earth doth tremble, and the Vales resound: Lances are crackt, and (dropping thick as Sleet) The Horsemen armd come thundring to the ground. Vpon feirce Nunio's Few, fresh Foes are pact: Their Art, to multiply; his, to abstract. 32 Loe now his Brother's swords against him bent (Cruell, and ougly)! But Hee wonders not. For they, who 'gainst their King, and Countrey went, Would never stick to cut a Brother's Throat. Of these Revolters many did present Themselves in the first Ranks: And who so hot To kill their Friends, as They? so kindred Hoasts Of yore incountred in Pharsalian Coasts. 33 O Cataline, and Thou Sertorius bould, Noble Coriolanus, with the rest, Who 'gaynst your Countrey drew your swords of ould From an Impious, though provoked, Brest! If in the darke Abysse of Pluto's Hould Ye find your selves with Furies's whipps opprest, Tell them (to cloake the horrour of your sin) Some Portingalls sometimes have Traytors bin. 34 Ore-whelmd with growing Foes's impetuous flood, Now were the formost of our Squadrons burst, There Nunio, like a rampant Lyon, stood, Whom in her neighb'ring Mountains Ceuta nurst; But now he is invirond with a wood Of Hunters speares, ore Tetuan plains that courst; Those All are bent at Him, His Brows Hee draws, Nor is it Feare, but Anger makes him pause. 35 Musty he looks, nought pleased with the sight, Yet (his wild Nature, and undaunted he art Incompetible with ignoble flight) Himself amongst the thickest he doth dart: So with the blood of Aliens dyes our Knight The Lusitanian Grass. Some fall, some start Ev'n of his own. For, where there is such odds, Strength often fails, and firmest Vertue nods. 36 John saw how hard brave Nunio was put to't: (For, as a wise and careful General, His Eye was in all parts, in all his Foot, His Presence, and his words, gave life to All) As a She-Lyon, and a Nurse to boot, That finds, whilst Hunger, Her from home did call, (Leaving her whelps unto themselves) a bold Massylian shepherd lurcht them from her Hold; 37 Raving she runs, and grinds her Teeth, and rends The Seaven Brother Mountains with her Voice: So John, so runs he (to assist his Frends) To the Head Squadrons with some soldiers choice. O brave Camrades, noble as are your Ends, (How in your matchless Valour I rejoyce)! Defend your Countrey, and defend your Lands: The Hope of Freedom in your Lances stands. 38 See me, your King, your Fellow, and your Head, 'Mongst Darts, 'mongst Arrows, and thick Pikes among, Rush on the Foe! Nor are you sent, but led. Shew, fighting, to what Countrey ye belong. The irrefragable Warriour sed; Who, four times poysing a sharp Lance, and strong; Throws it with force: and through this Throw alone Many a Soule out of her House is throwne. 39 For (loe!) his men with honorable shame Are kindled new and with a noble Ire. Who shall bet most at Mars his bloody Game, Is th'onely Thing to which they All aspire. They Vye, revye, and dip their steel in flame: Break stubborn Mayles, nor leave thick Plates intire. Thus wounds they give, and wounds they take again, Nor doth it grieve them, slaying, to be slain. 40 Many are posted to the Stygian Wave, Into whose Bodies entred Steel, and death. Of St. Iago there the Master brave Dyes fighting stoutly to his last of breath. Another Master dire of Calatrave Pulls Troops down with him to the shades beneath. The Renegade Pereyras likewise dye Reneaguing Heaven and their Destiny. 41 Went thousands of the Vulgar without noat, And nobles too, unenter'd in Fame's rolls, Where that lean dog still gapes with triple throat, Which never can be fill'd with humane souls. And (more to humble them, who, when on float, Thought the whole World must stoop to their controlls) The high Castilian Standart now doth fall, And kiss the foot of that of Portugall. 42 With deaths, with groans, with blood, with gashes dire, The battail cruel above measure grows. The multitude of men, that here expire, Makes all the Flow'rs in colour like the Rose. All fly, or dye: Now out of breath was Ire: Now Valour lost an Arm for want of Foes: Now routed sees himself Castilia's King, And quits the purpose he from home did bring. 43 The Field he leaves unto the Conquerer, Glad that he did leave him his life too. The poor remainder follow: To whom Feare Gave wings, not Feet: nor did they run, but flew. The loss of so much men, and Treasure there, Profoundly in their silent hearts they rue: Hiding the smart, the sorrow; and the soyle, To have Another triumph in their spoyle. 44 Some Him with open mouth blaspheam'd, and curst, Who first invented War mankind to quell; In whose obdurate Breast Ambition first, And Covetise of others goods did dwell; Nor car'd for feeding his hydropick Thirst How many silly soules were pack't to Hell; Who taught the way to shorten humane lives, To orphan Children, and to widow Wives. 45 Victorious John upon the place stays out In martial glory the accustom'd days: With Offrings then, and Pilgrimage devout, To Him, That gave the Conquest, gives the Praise. But Nunio (minding what he was about, As He That knows, a lasting Fame to raise, No way like Arms, which all the world command) Passes his Troops to the Trans-Tagan Land. 46 To Him his stars so favourable were, That the success applauded the designe: For he both conquers, and the spoyls doth weare Of Andalusian Countreys That confine. The Betick Standard of Sevilia there, Under which divers neighb'ring great ones joyn, With small resistance at his feet soon falls, Quell'd by the force, and name, of Portingals. 47 With these, and other Victories opprest A tedious while were the Castilians brave, When Peace, and now by both desired Rest, The vanquisht People from the Victors have: After the King Of Heav'n, for ever blest, To the Foe-Kings in holy-marriage gave Of English Sisters the unequall'd pair, Illustrious, lovely, beautiful, and Fair. 48 But long that Breast, inur'd to bloody Broile, To live without a Foe, could not sustain; So (having none upon the Land to toyle) Goes to extend his Conquests o're the Maine. This is our first of Kings, who doth exile Himself from Spain, to make the Affricane By force of Arms perceive the diff'rence great Betwixt CHRIST's Law, and that of Mahomet. 49 Behold on curled Thetys's silver flood Their wings a thousand swimming Eagles beat, To catch the swelling wind (a moving wood) Where the World's utmost bounds Alcides set. Mount Avila he takes, and the Walls good Of noble Ceuta, outing Mahomet With his blind Worship: and secures all Spaine From Treason of another Juliane. 50 Death envies so great Bliss to Portugall As to injoy the Ages it desires This worthy Prince; and takes him from Earth's Ball, To add a new Voice to the Angells's Quires. But that Good Pow'r, which Him to Heav'n did call, Left his large off-spring to supply their Sire's Lamented want: Princes, who shall command, Augment, and with new Vertues deck the Land. 51 King Edward was not of the happiest, though, The while that He the Regal Throne did fill: “For moody Time goes blending joy with woe: “And with alternate Hand gives good for Ill. “Who ever Happiness did constant know? “Or Fortune with one face continue still? Yet to this Kingdom she, and ev'n this King, More of her honey gave, then of her sting. 52 He saw his Brother Captive (good Fernand) Who had a Soul so publike, and so brave, That, for his Troops, distrest in Affrick-Land, Himself a Pawn unto the Moors he gave. Where, when his ransome was in his own Hand, He (born a Prince) would rather dye a slave: Then that for Him we Ceuta should restore: Freedom he lov'd, but lov'd his Countrey more. 53 Codrus, because the Foe should not o'recome; Deviz'd a noble Stratagem to dye: To save the martial discipline of Rome Did Regulus to Death with Torments flye: Ours, distant fear to keep his Countrey from, Invites himself to endless slavery. Codrus, nor Curtius (so much wonder'd at) Nor loyal Decii, did so much as That. 54 But Edward's onely Son, Alphonso hight, (A lucky Name to our Hesperia) Who, the prowd threatnings of Barbarian night In bord'ring Lands, low as the dust did lay; Would have been doubtless an unconquer'd Knight, Had he forborn t'invade Iberia. Affrick will tell you, 'twas impossible To overcome a King so terrible. 55 To pull the golden Apples was his hap, Which none before him, but Alcides bit, On the feirce Moor he such a Yoake did clap From which they cannot rest their Necks out yit. The Palme and Lawrell green his Temples wrap, Of Victories, he at the Seige did git Of Pop'lous Tancer, Strong Alager's Towers, And tough Arzila, o're the Barb'rous Powers 56 Infine, the ever-conqu'ring Portincall's (The succours beaten) entring These by force, Threw to the ground the adamantine walls, And All that thwarted their Victorious course. Wonders (deserving Pens whence liquor falls Immortalizing with it's Nectar source) Wrought private Swords in this Exployt of fame: Exalting more the Lusitanian name. 57 But after taynted with Ambition, And Rule's sweet Thirst (though soure to Him at last) Fernando he invades of Arragon, About the Kingdom of Castilia vast. Of the proud Nations (which depend thereon) A num'rous Hoast, t'oppose him, is a masst, From Cadiz to the lofty Perynee: All which the King Fernando did obey. 58 The young Prince Iohn disdayns it should be said, Hee is the only idle Man in Spaine; And therefore, his ambitious Sire to ayd Resolves forth with: nor is his Ayd in vaine. The Battayle's bloody period, undismayd, Hee sees; and with a brow serene and plaine. The warlike Father put to totall Rout, Yet leaves the Son the Victory in doubt. 59 For the sublime and truly Royall son (Gay Knight undaunted, confident, and high) Having vast spoyle to the Adversary done, Stays one whole day the Field to justify. Thus was Octauius Cæsar overthrowne, And Victor his companion Anthony: When They or Those, who noble Iulius kil'd, Reveng'd themselves in the Philippick Feild. 60 Alphonso mounted to high Heav'n serene; The Prince, That then the Scepter swayd of right, Was Second Iohn, who made of Kings fifteen Hee (to attain to Glory's utmost hight) Began a Taske, exceeding strength terrene (Whose weight is now by my weake shoulders born) To seek the Cradle of the purple Morn. 61 He sends fit Messengers from his owne Court Through Spaine, France, celebrated Italy: There to imbarque in that illustrious Port Where was interr'd, of old, Parthenope. Naples; which Fortune made her Tennis-Court, By severall Nations held successively, To place it glorious (no more change to feel) In sov'raign Spaniards, who can fix her wheel. 62 Away they sayle through the Calabrian Deep; Passe by the Rodian Island's sandy Bay: Along the Coast of Alexandria keep, For Pompey's death infamous to this day. They travayle Memphis, and those Lands which steep Themselves in Nyle. To Ethiopia They mount, which Egypts upper part doth lock, Where CHRIST hath feeding an out-lying Flock. 63 The Erythrean Sea they likewise crost: Which, dry-foot past the seed of Israel. The Nabathean Mountayn's sight they lost, So named from the Son of Ishmael. The oderiferous Sabean-Coast (Inricht with Teares which from the Mother fell Of fayre Adone.) and Blest Arabia trac't Throughout (the Stony balking; and the Wast;) 64 The Persian Gulph they enter. To This neer, Great Babel's Ruines are yet visible. Swift Tigris mingles with Eufrates heer: Brothers, That with their Fountain's glory swell. Hence they proceed in quest of Indus deer: From which great things Posteritie shall tell, Of Troops, that through long Seas shall passe thereto: Which, even by Land nigh Traian durst not doe. 65 Of India, Tarfe, and Carmanian Hills, The strange and uncoth Nations they beheld: Noating the sev'rall Customes, sev'rall Skills, Which sev'rall Regions doe produce, and yeild. But from such Distant parts (joynd to the Ills Of so rough journeys) Men return but seld. In fine, there did These dye; they stuck fast there: For back they come not to their Country deare. 66 Seems, gracious Heav'n reserv'd for Thee alone, Emanuel, and for thy great desart So hard a worke: For Thee with thoughts high-flown Inspir'd, and cut out fit to act this part. Manuel (succeeding Iohn, both in the Throne, And in the haughty purpose of his Heart) When first he took on Him the Kingdoms Charge, The Conquest undertook oth' Ocean large. 67 Hee, as a person, whom the noble thought Of th' obligation he inherited From his Fore Fathers (who intirely sought The Realm's advancement) hourly combated; When Phebus, quitting the supernal Vault, Vnto the low Antipodes was fled, And setting starrs (which in his place arose) With twinckling eyes invited to repose: 68 Extended now upon his golden Nest (Such are the Beds where thoughts tumultuous brood) And there revolving in his silent Brest The obligation of his place, and blood: Slumber possest his Eyes, nor dispossest His Heart of Cares, which made that station good: For his tyr'd Lidds whilst sleep (resisted) shutts, Morpheus a thousand shapes before him putts. 69 So high above ground seems he lifted heer, That his proud Crown the Firmament doth peirce: From whence new worlds before his eyes appeer, Nations of num'rous people strange and fierce: And yonder (to the springing Morning neer) As through the Ayre his visual Raies disperse, Hee sees, farr off, from high and antient Mountains, Melt down a payre of deep and crystall Fountains 70 With Birds of monstrous Forms, wild-beasts and Flocks, One of those Mountains was inhabited; Where thousand savage Trees with leavie Locks The intercourse of people hindered The shaggie Forrest, and the craggie Rocks's Inextricable Knots, demonstrated, That to those days of ours from Adam's sin, No humane Foot had ever trod therein. 71 Out of these Waters (as to Him appeares) Addressing towards him their hasty pace, Two Fathers rise, both wondrous struck in yeares, With Rustick both, yet venerable, Face. Their Snowy Curles distill in silver Teares Which bathe their Bodyes down in every place. Taun'd were their Skins, and rusty: Their Beards kept Rough and unshorn, with which the ground they swept. 72 The Temples of their heads, were trimly bound With health-restoring Druggs, and Fruits unknown. The one lookt weather-beaten and halfe-drownd, As if a longer voyage Hee had gone; And (fierce, ev'n at his Fountain) underground Seem'd to have stoln from a remoter one: As from Arcadian plains Alpheo sly To Arethusa's bed in Sicily. 73 This (as the more authoriz'd of the Twain) Spake thus (farr off) unto the King. O Thou For whose high Crown, and Empire soveraign, Much World is kept, that's hid from the world, now. Wee (through the Earth so fam'd, whose Necks in vain, Strave others wholly to their yoaks to bow) Are come to wish thee send some Men That may Receive large tributes, we to Thee must pay. 74 I am illustrious Ganges: born and nurst In Paradice: where is my mother-spring. My Mate (That from the Cliffes thou seest, doth burst; Nor other Cradle knows) is Indus King. Yet a severe Warr shall we cost thee first: But Thou (persisting) in the end shalt bring, By Victories prodigious, to the Bitt, All these viewd Nations humbly to submit. 35 The Holy and illustrious River, fed No more: But in a moment vanisht Both. Emanuell wakes surpriz'd with a strange dread, And earthquake in his Bosome. Phebus goeth In the meane time his glittring Cloke to spred Over the World, buried in downe, and sloath. Aurora came: who, when she forth doth rush, Strikes Lilies pale, and makes the Roses blush. 36 The King in hast to councell calls his Lords, To them the figures of the Vision shows; To them repeates the Holy Elder's Words: Whence in them all great admiration grow's. A Navy is resolv'd on by the Board's Vnanimous Voate: In which (magnanimous) Those, Whom hee shall find to plough the Ocean blew, Must seek new Nations out, and Clymates new. 37 I, who despayr'd to see put in effect What had so long been tumbling in my mind: (For my presaging Soule could nere be checkt From prompting great things to mee of this kind) Comprize not for what cause, for what respect, Or for what merit, he in mee could find; But the good King was pleas'd to pick out mee To be this weightie enterprize's Key. 38 And with Intreaties, and with sugard phraise (Which are the pow'rfullest commands of Kings) He sayd to me. “Through deep, and rugged ways, “Vertue attains the best and noblest things. “A Life well lost, or hazarded, to Bays “Of everlasting Honour persons brings: “For (if to sordid Feare it never bends) “The shorter 'tis, the Farther it extends. 39 You have I chose (and all the rest set by) To a Taske fit for you to undergoe: A Taske Heroick, difficult and high, Which (for my sake) you will think light, I know. I could not suffer more: but thus reply, O my dread Leige! through swords, through fire, through snow, For Thee to venture, only is Annoy When I consider life is such a Toy. 80 Put me on Tasks as great as those of yore Suborn'd Euristeus to Alcides gave; The fruitful Hydra, Erimanthian Bore, The Harpies dire, Nemean Lyon brave. In short, to visit the infernal shore Where Styx moats Pluto's House with its black Wave: For Thee (O King) worse dangers, and worse Toyls, My Spirit leaps at, nor my Flesh recoyles. 81 With sumptuous Boons; and words, that those exceed; My good will He doth praise, and gratifie: “For Vertue, spurr'd with praise, doubles her speed; “And is inflam'd to Enterprises high. To second me in this Exployt, agreed (Oblig'd by Nature's, and by Frendship's Tye, Thirsty alike of Honour, and of Fame) My dear and loving Brother Paul De Game. 82 Nich'las Coellio makes a Third: for pains Most indefatigable. And These are My two Supporters strong of Hand, and Brains: Experienc't both, both no less bold in warr. I get me a young Crew of sturdy Swains, Whose budding Valour itcht for martial jarr: All metled Lads; And so, it well appeers, That came to such a business Volunteers. 83 These too have gifts from Manuel's hand, t'equip Themselves, and make the love they bear him more: And with the praising bounty of his Lip, Are arm'd 'gainst All, hard Fates can have in store. Thus man'd King Pelias that prophetick ship In which (through Euxine Seas, unsayl'd before) With Æson's Heyre the vent'rous youth of Greece He sent to Colcos for the Golden Fleece. 84 Now in the famous Port of Lisbon-Town (Where golden Tagus mingles his sweet Flood With the Salt Ocean, and his Sands doth drown) With noble longings, and transported mood, The Ships lye ready. There no sullen frown, No frosty Fear, benmms the youthful blood: For both the Sea-men, and the Land-men there, Will go with me about the World, they sweare. 85 Upon the shore the strutting souldiers sayle In cloathes of sev'rall colour, sev'rall cutt, Their minds, more brave: bent to extend our pale, And plant in lands unknown their daring foot. The gentle wind breathing a tempting Gale, On the tall Shipps the Standarts ope and shutt. The Shipps expect, for this new Navigation, To bee (like Argo) made a Constellation. 86 Wee (fitted and provided thus, with All That such a Voyage doth require and crave) To fit our soules for death devoutly fall: Which Saylers see in ev'ry rounding Wave. From Him, whose presence Beatificall Is all the Food that Saints and Angels have, Favour we beg, for to prepare our way, And to conduct us with his heavenly Ray. 87 Thus of that Temple took we a long leave, Which (on the Margent of our Ocean plac't) From the blest City did it's name receave Where God was born (a Gem in Clay enchac't) I promise thee (O King) how wee did heave Our Anchors from that shore, when I recast; With doubt of ever seeing it again, Scarce can my bridled eyes from Tears refrain. 88 Th'Inhabitants of Lisbon, that sad day (For Frendship some, and some for Kindreds Tyes) Others, as meer spectators, flockt: o dismay, And solitarinesse, writt in their Eyes. And wee (whom thousand Priests upon our way Did bring with Psalms, and all solemnities Of grave procession) praying to our God, Went to take shipping in the Noble Road. 89 In so long Voyage, and so doubtfull ways, The gazing people give us All for lost, This, by their Teares the softer sex bewrays: The Men by Sighs, as they would yeild the Ghost, Sisters, and Mothers; And poor Wives (always Where there is most of love, there feare reigns most.) Increase the doubt upon the gen'rall score, That she shall never see our Faces more. 90 One, following, Cryes: O Son! (the only gage, The prop, the stay, the comfort and the joy, Of this my weake unprofitable Age, Which Floods of bitter Tears drown in Annoy) Why leav'st thou mee in this sad equipage? VVhy wilt thou goe, and leave mee (my deare Boy!) To make the greedy Seas thy Sepulchere, And Fishes feed That take their pastime there? 91 Another (with loose Hayr) O my deer Mate, Without whom Love tells mee my roote must pine! Why wilt thou goe, and venture at this rate That life to Gulphs, which is not thine but mine? How canst thou change, for so uncertain Fate, The chaste embraces of thy constant Vine? Our loves, our joyes (in vain how sweet!) must They To Sea? and with this wind be blown away: 92 In these and other speches of this kind (Which from deer love, and soft compassion rose) Old men and children (to like Ruth inclin'd By diff'rent Ages) imitated Those The neigb'ring mountayns in dull consort joyne: And, melting, bare the burthen of their woes. The golden Sands the Silver Tears bedew'd: Which seemd to strive with them in multitude. 93 Wee (not so much as lifting once our Eyes On VVife, or Mother: though our Soules it grinds) Whereby in vain laments to Sympathize, Or change the purpose of our fixed minds) T'embarque our selves, conceiv'd it was most wise, Without those Farewells to which custom binds: Which (though it bee Love's most indeering way) Galls more, both Those That goe, and Those that stay. 94 But an Ould man of Venerable look (Standing upon the shore amongst the Crowds) His Eyes fixt upon us (on ship-board) shook, His head three times ore-cast with sorrows clowds: And (streining his Voyce more, then well could brook His aged lungs: It rattled in our shrow'ds) Out of a science, practise did Attest, Let fly these words from an oraculous Brest. 95 O Glory of commanding! O vain Thirst Of that same empty nothing, we call Fame! O Ignis fatuus, kindled and nurst With vulgar breath (and this we Honour name)! What Plagues, what stings, what secret scourges curst, Torment those Bosomes which thou doest inflame! What deaths! what dangers! what impetuous storms! What cruelties on them thy Hand performs! 96 Fell Tyrant of the soules! life's swallowing VVave! Mother of Plunders, and black Rapes unchast! The secret miner, and the open Grave, Of Patrimonies, Kingdoms, Empires vast! They call thee noble, and they call thee Brave: (Worthy t'have other names upon thee cast!) They call thee Fame, and Glory soveraign: Titles, with which the foolish Rout is tane. 97 What new disaster dire intendest Thou To lead these Kingdoms, and these Folk into? What deaths, what Horrours must they swallow now, Vnder pretence to spread Religion true? What holdings forth of golden Mines, and how Great Kingdoms shall be conquer'd by a Few? What Fames do'st thou advance? what Histories? What Palms? what Triumphs? and what Victories. 98 But Thou (the lignage of that Foole, who twice Undid thee by his disobedience: Not only when he lost thee Paradice, Into this Vale of Teares exild from thence; But when by growth of his infectious Vice He forfeited thy second Innocence, And Thee, out of a golden exile hurld Into an Iron and contentious world.) 99 Since with this sweet and pleasing vanity Thy giddie Brain is so bewitcht, and drownd; Since bloody Rage and Inhumanity, Valour, and Brav'rie, in thy language sound; Since thou doest valew, and esteem so high, The disesteem of life, which we are bound To cherish, and in great accompt to have it: (Since so much fear'd to loose it, Hee who gave it) 100 Hast thou not, close at hand, the Ishmaelite To cut thee work out, more then thou canst doe? If for the sacred Law of CHRIST thou fight, Th' Arabian's false one does not He pursue? Hath Hee not thousand Citties, Infinite Of Land, if Power's availe, if Wealth's one too? Hath not Hee got in Arms a mighty Name, If Honour, and not Bootie be thy Ayme? 101 Leav'st thou a growing Foe just at thy dore, To goe and seek another Foe so farr, Dispeopling an ould Realm, wasting her store, Quitting thy Countrey, and thy private Lar? That flatt'ring Fame to Heav'n may make thee soare, Through waves uncertain seekst thou certain warr? In thy swoln Style in words at length to find, Arabia, Persia, Ethiopia, Yn'd? 102 Accurst be Hee, who first forsook the Ground, And fastned canvas wings to a dry Tree! Worthy, in endlesse darkness to be bound; If that, which I was taught, Religion bee. May never Judgment, solid and profound, May never Happy Veyn in Poetrie, Retrive his memory, adorn his Fame: But dye, with Him, his Glory, and his Name. 103 The son of Iapet stole from Phebus's Carr Fire, which in humane Breast he did infuse; Fire, which the world did kindle into Warr, Plagues, and debaucheries (a great abuse!) Prometheus, had it not been better farr For Us, and for the world (which wee misuse) Thy noble Statute had excus'd that fire, Which made it with Ambition's wings aspire? 104 Then had not the much pittied youth been driving His Sire's gilt charet; nor that great contriver Through th'empty Ayre sayld with his Son (This giving The sea a name, Hee Fame unto a River) Nothing so high, nothing so barrd the living, Through Fire, Sword, Water, Calm and Cold: what ever: Which Man projecteth, and attempteth not, A strange Condition! an unquiet Lot! End of the fourth Canto. Fifth Canto. 1 The rev'rend Father stood inculcating These Sentences; when Wee to a serene And gentle Gale expand our Canvas wing: When from the loved Port our selves we reane: And sayles unfurling make the Welkin ring (After the manner of Sea-faring Men) With Boon Voyage. Immediatly the Wind Does on the Trunks his Office and his kind. 2 The ever burning Lamp, that rules the day, In the Nemean Bruite began to rage; And the great world (which doth with time decay) Limpt in his Sixt infirm, and crooked Age: Thereof (accompting in the Church 'is way) Of Sol's incessant Race the Thousand stage Four hundred, Ninetie Seav'nth, was running whan, In all their trim the Shipps to saile began. 3 Now by degrees out of our sight did glide Parts of our Countrey, which abode behind. Abode deer Tagus: and we then did hide Fresh Syntra (About this our eyes did wind) In the lov'd Kingdom likewise did abide Our Hearts, whose strings could not be thence untwind, And, when as all the Land did now with draw, The sea and Firmament was all wee saw. 4 Thus went we opening those seas, which (save Our own) no Nation open'd ere before: See those new Isles, and clymates near; which brave Prince Henry shewd unto the world before The Mauritanian Hills, and Strand, which gave, Anteus birth, who there was King of yore, Upon the left hand left (for there is none Upon the right, though now suspected, known) 5 We the great Island of Madera pass, Which from it's Wood's abundance took the name; The first, which planted by our Nation was, Of which the worth is more then the great fame: Nor (though the last place in the world it has) Doth any, Venus loves, excel the same: Who (rather) were it Hers, would lay aside For This, Cythera, Cyprus, Paphos, Gnide. 6 We leave adust Massilias barren Coast, Where Azenegues's lean Heards take their repast: A People, That want water to their Roast; Nor Herbs it self in any plenty tast: A Land in fine, to bear no Fruit dispos'd: Where Birds in their hot stomachs Iron waste: Suff'ring of all things great Necessitie: Which Ethiopia parts from Barbarie. 7 We pass the Bound that hedges out the Sun When to the frozen North he bends his way: Where People dwell, whom Clymene's rash Son Deny'de the sweet Complexion of the day. Here Nations strange are water'd one by one With the fresh Currents of black Senega. Here Arsinarius Aloof is seen, That lost his name: confirm'd by Us Cape Green. 8 Canarian Isles (the same men call'd of old The Fortunate) declined: After These Among the Daughter-Islands we did fall Of aged Hesper, term'd Hesperides. Locks, in the which the Fleets of Portugal To wonders new before had turn'd the Keys. There did we touch with favourable wind, Some fresh provisions for our Ships to find. 9 It's Name the Isle on which we Anchor cast Did from the warlike St. Iago take. The Saint That holp the Spaniard in times past Such cruel havock of the Moors to make. Thence, when the North renew'd his kinder blast, We cut again the circumfused Lake Of the salt Ocean; And that Store-House: leave, From which Refreshment sweet we did receive. 10 Winding withal about your Affrick shore, Where to the East (like a half-moon) it bends; About Jalofo's Province (which doth store The world with Blacks, whom, forc't Aboard, it sends.) The large Mandinga that affords the Ore The which doth make Friends Foes, and of Foes Frends; (Which suck't Gaemea's crooked water laves That disimbogues in the Atlantick Waves) 11 We pass the Gorgades, peopled by faire Sisters, in ancient time residing there: Who (rob'd of seeing) did amongst them share One onely Eye, which they by turns did weare. Thou onely, Thou (the Net of whose curl'd Haire Caught Neptune, like a Fish, in his own Were) Turn'd of them all at last the ugliest Lout, With Vipers sow'dst the burning sands about. 12 Ploughing in fine before a Northern Wind In that vast Gulph the Navy went embayd; Leona's craggie mountains left behind, The Cape Of PALms (so call'd from Palmie shade) And that great River, where the Sea (confin'd) Against the shores, which we had planted, bray'd: With th'Isle that boasts his name, who would not trust Till in the side of God his Hand he thrust. 13 There lyes of Congo the wide-spreading Ream, By Vs (before) converted to Christ's Law; Through which long Zayre glides with crystal stream: A River, this, the Ancients never saw. In fine through this vast Ocean from the Team Of known Bootes I apace withdraw: Having already past upon the Maine The Burning Line that parts the World in twain. 14 There we before us saw by it's own light In this new Epicicle a Star new: Of which the other Nations ne're had sight, And (long in darkness) no such matter knew. The world's Antartick Henge (less gilt, less bright, For want of Stars, then th'Artick) we did view: Beneath the which, a question yet depends, Whether more Land begins, and the Sea ends. 15 Past in this sort those equinoxiall clymes By which his steeds twice yearely drives the sun; Making two Summers, VVinters, Autumns, Primes, Whilst he from one to to'ther Pole doth run: Now tost, now calm'd (A sufferer in all Times: By want, and plenty, equally undone.) I saw both Beares (the little and the Great) Despight of Iuno in the Ocean set. 16 To tell thee all the dangers of the Deep (Which humane Judgment cannot comprehend) Suddain and fearfull storms, the Ayre that sweep; Lightnings, that with the Ayre the Fire doe blend; Black Hurracans; thick Nights; Thunders, that keep The VVorld alarm'd, and threaten the last End: Would be too tedious: indeed vain and mad, Though a brasse Tongue, and Iron lungs I had. 17 I saw those things, which the rude Mariner (Who hath no Mistresse, but Experience) Doth for unquestionable Truths aver, Guided belike by his externall sence: But Academicks (who can never err, Who by pure Wit and Learning's quintessence; Into all Natures secrets dive and pry) Count either Lyes, or coznings of the Eye. 18 I saw (as plain as the sun's midday light) That fire the Sea-man saints (shining out faire In time of Tempest, of feirce winds despight, Of over-clowded Heaven's. and black despayre:) Nor did wee all lesse wonder (and well might, For twas a sight to bristle up the Hayre) To see a sea-born Clowd with a long Cane Suck in the sea, and spout it out againe. 19 I saw with these two eyes) nor can presume That these deceiv'd mee) from the Ocean breathed A little Vapour, or aeriall Fume, With the curld wind (as by a Turner) wreathed. I saw it reach to Heaven from the salt spume, In such thin Pipe, as those where springs are sheathed; That by the Eye it hardly could be deemed: Of the same substance which the Clowds it seemed. 20 By little this and little did augment, And swell'd beyond the Bulk of a thick Mast. Streightning and widening (like a Throat) it went, To gulp into it self the water fast. It wav'd upon the wavy Element. The top thereof (impregnated at last Into a Clowd) expanded more, and more, With the great load of Water which it bore. 21 As a black Horse-leech (mark it in some Pool!) Got to the Lip of an unwary Beast, Which (drinking) suck't it from the water cool, Upon another's blood it self to feast; It swells and swells, and feeds beyond all Rule, And stuffs the paunch; a rude, unsober, Guest: So svvell'd the Pillar (vvith a hideous Crop) It self, and the black Clovvd vvhich it did prop. 22 But, vvhen that novv 'tis full, the Pedestal Dravvs to itself, vvhich in the Sea vvas set; And (flutt'ring through the Ayre) in shovv'rs doth fall: The couchant Water vvith new vvater vvet. It pays the vvaves the borrow'd Waves, but all The Salt thereout did first extract and get. Novv tell me, Scholars, by your Books; vvhat skill, Dame Nature us'd these waters to distil? 23 If old Philosophers (vvho travayld through So many Lands, her secrets out to spye) Had viewd the Miracles vvhich I did vievv, Had sayled vvith so many winds as I; What writings had they left behind! vvhat nevv, Both Starres, and Signs, bequeath'd to Us! What high And strong Influxes! What hid Qualities! And all pure Truths, vvithout allay of Lyes! 24 But vvhen that Planet (vvhich her Court doth keep In the first sphere) five times vvith speedy Race Had, since our Fleet vvas vvand'ring on the Deep, Shevv'd sometimes half, and sometimes all her Face: A quick-eyd Lynx cryes, from the Scuttle steep, Land! Land! vvith that, upon the decks apace Leaps the transported Crew: their Eyes, intent On the Horizon of the Orient. 25 At first the dusky Mountains (of the Land Wee made) like congregated Clowds did look: Seen plain, the heavie Anchors out of hand Wee ready make: Approach'd, our sailes we strook, And (that we might more cleerly understand The parts remote in which we were I took The Astrolabe, a modern Instrument: Which with sharpe Judgment Sages did invent: 26 We disembarke in the most open space: From whence, themselves the rasher Land-men spread (Greedy of Novelties!) through the wyld Place: Which never Stranger's Foot before did tread. But O (not passing the Land's sandie Face) To find out where we are, with Sea-men bred Stay taking the Sun's heigth by th'Ocean curld; And with my Compasse trace the painted World. 27 We found, we had already wholly past Of the halfe-Goate, halfe Fish, the noted Gole: Between the same, and that cold Countrey plac't (If such there be beneath the Southern Pole. When, loe! (lockt in with my Companions fast) I see a Native come, black as the Cole: Whom they had took perforce, as in the Wood Getting out Honey from the Combe he stood. 28 He comes with horrour in his looks: as Hee Who of a snare, like this, could never dreame. Hee understood not Us, neither Him VVee: More savage then the brutish Polypheme. Of Colcos's glistring Fleece I let him see The mettle which of mettles is supreme: Pure Silver; sparckling stones (continuing suite;) But in all these was unconcern'd the Bruite. 29 I bid them shew him lower prized Things Beades of transformed crystall; a fine noyse Of little Bells, thridded on tawdry strings, A red Cap, Colour which Contents, and joys. Streight saw I by his looks and beckonings, That he was wondrous taken with these Toys. Therewith I bid them they should set him free: So to the Village nigh away went Hee. 30 But the next morn (whilst yet the skyes were dim) All naked, and in colour like the shades, To seek such Knacks as had been given to Him, Loe, by the Craggs descending his Camerades! Where now their carriage to us is so trim, So tractable, and plyant; as perswades Velose with them to venture through the Cover, The Fashions of the Countrey to discover. 31 Veloso says, his pledge shall be his Blade, And walks secure in his own Arrogance, But, having now away a good while stayd And, I out-prolling with my countenance To see what signs for our Advent'rer made, Behold him comming with a vengeance Down from the Mountain-top towards the shipps! And faster homeward, then he went, he skips. 32 The long-boate of Coellio made hast To take him in: but, ere arrive that could, An Ethiopian bold his weapon past Full at his bosome, least escape he should. Another, and Another too: Thus chac't Velose and those farr off That help him would, I run, when (just as I an Oare lift up) A Troop of Negroe's hides the mountain-top. 33 A Clowd of Arrows, and sharpe stones they rain, And hayle upon us without any stint: Nor were These uttered to the Ayre in vain, For in this leg I there receiv'd a dint. But wee (as prickt with smart, and with disdayne) Made them a ready answeare, so in print, That (I believe in earnest) with our Rapps Wee made their Heads as crimson as their capps. 34 And now (Veloso, off, with safety brought) Forthwith repayre we to the Fleet agin, Seeing the ougly Malice, the base Thought, This false and brutish people hid within: From whom of India (so desired) nought Of Information could we pick, or win, But that it is remote, So once more I Vnto the Wind let all the Canvas fly. 35 Then to Veloso said a Jybing lad (The rest all laughing in their sleeves) Ho! Frend Velose: the Hill (it seems) was not so bad And hard to be come down, as 'twas t'ascend. True (quoth th' Advent'rer bold) Howe're, I had Not made such haste, but that the Doggs did bend Against the Fleet: And I began to doubt me It might go ill, that you were here without me. 36 He tells us then, he past no sooner was The Mountain's top, but that the people black Forbid him any farther on to pass And threat to kill him if he turn not back; And (turn'd) they lay them down upon the grass In Ambuscade, whereby they Us might pack To the dark Realm, when we in haste should sally To rescue Him, before we well could rally. 37 The Sun five times the Earth had compassed Since We (from thence departed) Seas did plough Where never Canvas wing before was spred, A prosp'rous Gale making the top-yards bow: When on a night (without suspect, or dred, Chatting together in the cutting Prow) Over our Heads appear'd a sable Clowd, Which in thick darkness did the Welkin shrowd. 38 So big it lookt, such stern Grimaces made, As fill'd our Hearts with horror, and appall, Black was the Sea, and at long distance brayd As if it roar'd through Rocks, down Rocks did fall. O Pow'r inhabiting the Heav'ns, I said! What divine threat is? What mystical Imparting of thy will in so new form, For this is a Thing greater then a Storm? 39 I had not ended, when a humane Feature Appear'd to us ith'Ayre, Robustious, ralli'd Of Heterogeneal parts, of boundless Stature, A Clowd in's Face, a Beard prolix and squallid: Cave-Eyes, a gesture that betray'd ill nature, And a worse mood, a clay complexion pallid: His crispt Hayre fill'd with earth, and hard as Wyre, A mouth cole-black, of Teeth two yellow Tyre. 40 Of such portentous Bulk was this Colosse, That I may tell thee (and not tell amiss) Of that of Rhodes it might supply the loss (One of the World's Seav'n Wonders) out of this A Voyce speaks to us: so profound, and grosse, It seems ev'n torn out of the vast Abyss. The Hayre with horror stands on end, of mee And all of us, at what we hear, and see. 41 And this it spake. O you, the boldest Folke That ever in the world great things assayd; Whom such dire Wars, and infinite, the smoke And Toyle of Glory have not weary made; Since these forbidden bounds by you are broke, And my large Seas your daring keeles invade, Which I so long injoy'd, and kept alone, Unplough'd by forreign Vessel, or our owne. 42 Since the hid secrets you are come to spye Of Nature and the humid Element; Never reveal'd to any Mortal's Eye Noble, or Heroes, that before you went: Hear from my mouth, for your presumption high What losses are in store, what Plagues are meant, All the wide Ocean over, and the Land, Which with hard War shall bow to your command. 43 This know; As many Ships as shall persever Boldly to make the Voyage you make now, Shall finde this Poynt their enemie for ever With winds and tempests that no bound shall know: And the first Fleet Of War that shall indeaver Through these inextricable Waves to go, So fearful an example will I make, That men shall say I did more then I spake. 44 Here I expect (unless my hopes have ly'de) On my discov'rer full Revenge to have; Nor shall He (onely) all the Ills abide, Your pertinacious confidences crave: But to your Vessels yearly shall betide (Unless provoked, I in vain do rave) Shipwracks, and losses of each kinde and Race; Amongst which, death shall have the lowest place. 45 And of the first that comes this way (in whom With heighth of Fortune, heighth of Fame shall meet) I'll be a new, and everlasting Tomb, Through God's unfathom'd judgement. At these Feet He shall drop all his Glories, and inhume The glitt'ring Trophies a Turkish Fleet. With me conspire his Ruine, and his Fall, Destroyd Quiloa, and Mombassa's Wall. 46 Another shall come after, of good fame, A Knight, a Lover, and a lib'ral Hand; And with him bring a fair and gentle dame, Knit his by Love, and Hymen's sacred Bond. In an ill hour, and to your loss and shame, Ye come within the Purlews of my land; Which (kindly cruel) from the sea shall free you, Drown'd in a sea of miseries to see you. 47 Sterv'd shall they see to death their Children deare; Be Got, and rear'd, in so great love. The black Rude Cafres (out of Avarice) shall teare The Cloathes from the Angellick Lady's back. Her dainty limbs of Alablaster cleare To Heate, to Cold, to Storm, to Eyes's worse Rack Shall be laid naked; after she hath trod (Long time) with her soft Feet the burning Clod. 48 Besides all this; Their Eyes (whose happier lot Will be to scape from so much miserie) This Yoake of Lovers, out into the hot And unrelenting Thickets turn'd shall see. Ev'n there (when Teares they shall have squeez'd and got From Rocks and Desarts, vvhere no waters be) Embracing (kind) their souls they shall exhale Out of the faire, but miserable, Iayle. 49 The ugly Monster vvent to rake into More, of our Fate; vvhen, starting on my feet, I ask him, Who art Thou? (for to say true Thy hideous Bulk amazes me to see't) Her (vvreathing his black mouth) about him threvv His savvcer-Eyes: And (as his soul vvould fleet) Fetching a dismal groan, replide (as sory, Or vext, or Both, at the Interrogatory.) 50 I am that great and secret Head of Land, Which you the Cape of Tempests well did call; From Strabo, Ptolomee, Pomponius, And Grave Pliny hid, and from the Antients all. I the but-end, that knits wide Affrick's strand; My Promontory is her Moun'd and Wall, To the Antartick Pole: which (neverthelesse) You, only, have the boldness to transgresse. 51 Of the rough sons oth'Earth, was I: and Twin, Brother to Him, that had an hundred Hands, I was call'd Adamastor, and was in The Warr 'gainst Him, That hurls hot Vulcan's Brands. Yet Hills on Hills I heapt not: but (to win That Empire, which the Second Jove commands) Was Generall at Sea; on which did sayle The Fleet of Neptune, which I was to quayle. 52 The love I bare to Peleus's spouse divine Imbarqu'd mee in so wild an Enterprize. The fayrest Goddesse that the Heav'ns inshrine I, for the Princesse of the Waves despise. Vpon a day when out the Sun did shine, With Nereus's daughters (on the Beach) these eyes Beheld her naked: streight I felt a dart Which Time, nor scorns, can pull out of my Heart. 53 I knew't impossible to gain her Love By reason of my great deformitie What force can doe I purpose then to prove: And, Doris call'd, let Her my purpose see. The Goddess (out of feare) did Thetys move On my behalfe: but with a chaste smile shee (As vertuous full, as she is fayre) replide, What Nymph can such a heavy love abide? 54 How ever Wee (to save the sea a part In so dire War) will take it into thought How with our honour we may cure his smart. My Messenger to mee thus answer brought. I, That suspect no stratagem, no Art, (How easily are purblind Lovers caught) Feel my selfe wondrous light with this Return: And fann'd with Hopes, with fresh desire doe hurn. 55 Thus fool'd, thus cheated from the warr begun, On a time (Doris pointing where to meet) I spy the glitt'ring forme, ith'evening dun, Of snowy Thetys with the silver feet. With open Armes (farr off) like mad I run To clip therein my Ioy, my Life, my Sweet: And (clipt) begin those orient Eyes to kis, That Face, that Hayre, that Neck, that All that is. 56 O, how I choake in utt'ring my disgrace! Thinking I Her embrac'd whom I did seek, A Mountain hard I found I did embrace O'regrown with Trees and Bushes nothing sleek. Thus (grapling with a Mountain face to face, Which I stood pressing for her Angel's cheek) I was no Man: No but a stupid Block And grew unto a Rock another Rock. 57 O Nymph (the fayrest of the Ocean's Brood)! Since with my Features thou could'st not be caught, What had it cost to spare me that false good, Were it a Hill, a Clowd, a Dreame, or Thought? Away fling I (with Anger almost wood, Nor lesse with shame of the Affront distraught) To seek another World: That I might live, Where none might laugh, to see me weep, and grieve. 58 By this my Brethren on their Backs were cast, Reduc'd unto the depth of misery: And the vain Gods (all hopes to put them past) On Those, That Mountayns pyl'd, pyl'd Mountains high. Nor I, that mourn'd farr off my deep distast, “(HEAU'N, Hands in vain resist, in vain Feet fly. For my design'd Rebellion, and Rape, The vengeance of pursuing Fate could scape. 59 My solid flesh converteth to tough Clay: My Bones to Rocks are metamorphosed: These leggs, these thighs (behold how large are they!) O're the long sea extended were and spred. In fine into this Cape out of the way My monstrous Trunk, and high-erected Head, The Gods did turn: where (for my greater payn) Thetys doth Tantalize me with the Mayn. 60 Here ends. And (gushing out into a Well Of Tears) forthwith he vanish from our sight. The black Clowd melting, with a hideous yell The Ocean sounded a long way forthright. I (in their presence, who by miracle Had thus far brought us, ev'n the Angells bright) Besought the LORD to shield his Heritage From all that Adamastor did presage. 61 Now Phlegon and Pyrous pulling come (With other Two) the Charet of the Day: When that high Land (to which this Gyant grum Was turn'd) doth to our Eyes it self display. Doubling the point, we take another Rumb; And (coasting) plough the Oriental Sea. Nor had we plough'd it long, when underneath A little) in a Second Port we breath. 62 The People That this Countrey did possess (Though they were likewise Ethiopians All) Did more of humane in their meens express, Then Those, into whose hands we late did fall. Upon the sandy Beach, with cheerfulness They meet us, and with Dances Festival. With them, their Wives: and their mild Flocks of Sheep Which fat and faire, and frisking they did keep. 63 Their Wives upon straw-Pillions (black as Jet) Slow-paced Oxen (like Europa) ride: Beasts, upon which a higher price they set Then all the Cattle of the Field beside. Sweet madrigalls (in Ryme, or Prose compleat, In their own Tongue) to rustick-Reed apply'de, They sing in Parts, as gentle Shepherds use, That imitate of Tytirus the Muse. 64 These (and no less was written in their Faces) Love and Humanity to Us afford: Bringing us Hens, and Muttons, in the places Of Merchandizes which we had Aboard. But, for (in fine) our men could spye no traces (By any Sign they made, or any word From their dark Tongue) of what we wisht to know: Our Anchors weigh'd, to Sea again we go. 65 Now had we giv'n the tother demi wheel About black Affrick, And (the burning Hoope, That girts the World, inquiring with my Keel) To the Antartick Pole I turn'd my Poope. By that small Isle (such emulous Thoughts we feel) Discover'd by a former Fleet, we Soope; Which sought the Cape Of Tempests, and (that found) Pitcht here a Cross; our then Discov'ries's Bound. 66 Thence, many nights, and many sadder days, Betwixt rough Storms, and languid Calmes, we grope Through the great ocean, and explore, new ways: No Lanthorn to pursue, but our high Hope. One time above the rest (as danger Plays At Sea the Protheus) with strange Waves we cope. So strong a Current in those parts we meet, As ev'n obstructs the passage of our Fleet. 67 More violent without comparison (As our reculing Vessels plain did shew) The Sea was, That did there against us run, Then the fresh Gale, that in our favour blew. Notus (disdaining much to be out-done By That; and, as he thought, on purpose too To affront Him) puffs, blusters, reinforces His angry Blasts: and so we pass The Courses. 68 The Sun, reduc'd the solemnized Feast, On which, a King laid in a Cratch to find, Three Kings did come conducted from the East, In which One King, three Kings at once are joyn'd. That day took we another Port (possest By People, like to Those we left behind) In a great River: Giving it the Name Of that great-day when thereinto we came. 69 Here fresh Provisions of the Folks we take: Fresh-water from the River. But in summ, No guess concerning India could we make, By People, unto Us as good as dumb. See (King) how many Countreys we did rake Without a door found out from that rude scumm, Without descrying the least Track, or Scent, Of the so much desired Orient! 70 Imagine, Sir, in what distress of mind, How lost we went, how much perplext with Cares, Broken with Storms, and All with Hunger pin'd, Through Seas unknown, through disagreeing Ayres, (So far from hope, the wished Land to find, As, ev'n with hoping, plung'd into despaires) Through Climates rul'd by other heav'nly Signes; And where no Star, of our acquaintance, shines. 71 The food we have too, spoyl'd; and what we crave As nutriment, ev'n turn'd into our Bane: No Entregens, no news, to make us wave Our Griefs; or feed us with a hope, though vaine. Think'st Thou, if this choyce band of soldiers brave Were other then of Lusitanian straine, They had obedient held to this degree Unto their King, and his Authoritie? 72 Think'st Thou, they had not risen long ago Against their Gen'rall (cross to their desire) Turning Free-booters, forced to be so By black despair, by Hunger, and by Ire? If ever Men were try'de, These are: since no Fatigue, no suff'rings, were of force, to tyre Their great and Lusitanian excellence Of loyalty, and firm Obedience. 73 Leaving, in fine, the sweet fresh-water Flood, And the salt Waves returning to divide; Off from the Land a prety space we stood, Our whole Fleet bent into the Ocean wide: Lest the cold Southern wind (increasing) shou'd Impound us in the Bay and furious Tyde Made in that Quarter by the crooking shore, Which to Sofala sends the golden Ore. 74 This part (and the swift Rudder streight up resign'd To good St. Nich'las, as in case deplor'd) Towards that Part we steered, where the Wind- Possessed Waves against the Beaches roar'd: When the 'twixt hope and fear suspended mind, And which confided in a painted Board, (Faln from small hope to absolute dispaire) Lookt up by an Adventure rare. 75 'Twas thus. When to the Coast so nigh we drew As to see plain the Countrey round about: A River broacht into the Sea we view, Where Barks with Sails went passing in and out. To meet with Men, That Navigation knew Surpriz'd us with great joy, thou canst not doubt: For amongst Them, of things from Vs so hid, We hop't to hear some News: and so we did. 76 These too are Ethiops: yet it should appeare They had in better company been bred. Arabick words we pickt out here and there, By which was reacht the scope of what they sed. A kind of Terbant each of them did weare, Of Cotton fine, pres't close unto his head: Another Cotton-cloth (and this was blew) About those-parts that should be kept from view. 77 In the Arabick-Tongue (which They speak ill, But Fernand Martyn understandeth though) They say; in Ships as great as these we fill, That Sea of theirs is travers't to and fro; Even from the rising of the Sun, untill The Land makes Southward a Full Point, and so Back, from the South, to East: conveying, thus, Folks, of the colour of the Day, like Vs. 78 If with the sight of These so joy'd we were, The news they give us makes us much more glad. This (for the signes by us collected there) We call The River Of Good Signs. We add The Land-mark of A Cross, the which we reare, Whereof some number in our Ships we had For such Intents: This bar the fair Guides's name Who, with Tobiah unto Gabael came. 79 Of Slyme, scales, shell-fish, and such filthy stuff, (The noysome Generation of the Deep) The Ships (that come therevvith sordid, and rough, Through so long Seas) there do vve cleanse, and svveep. From our kind Hosts vve, had supply'de, enough Of the Provisions usual (as sheep, And other things) vvith smooth, and jocund meen, And as cleer hearts: vvhich through their eys vvere seen. 80 But the high pregnant Hopes, we there embraced Bred not a joy unmixt with some Allay. To balance it, in t'other scale was placed A new disaster by Rhamnusia. “Thus gracious Heav'ns their Boons have interlaced: “These are the interfearings, This the way, “Of humane Things. Black sorrow holds the Dye: “Light joy fades in the twinkling of an Eye. 81 And this it was. The loathsom'st, the most fell Disease, that ever these sad eyes beheld, Reft many a life, and left the Bones to dwell For everlasting in a forreign Field. Who will believe (unseen) what I shall tell? In such dire manner would the gumms be swell'd In our mens Mouths; that the black flesh thereby At once did grow, at once did putrifie. 82 With such a horrid stench it putrifide, That it the neighb'ring Ayre infected round. We had no circumspect Physitian try'de: No Lady-handed Surgeon was there found. But by a Carver might have been supply'de The last. 'Twas handling of a dead man's wound. The rawest Novice, with his Instrument Might cut, and never hurt the Patient. 83 In fine, in this wild Land, adieu we bad To our brave Friends (never to see them more) Who in such Ways, in such Adventures sad, With Us an equal burthen ever bore. “How easily a burying place is had! “The least wave of the Sea, any strange shore, “Serve, as to put our Fellows's Reliques in, “So of the bravest Men that e're have bin. 84 Thus, from this fatal Haven we disjoine With more of joy then what we brought, and less: And (coasting upward) seek some farther signe Of India, to make out our present guess. At Mozambique we arriv'd in fine; Of whose false dealing, and hard heartedness, Thou must have heard: as also of the Vile And barb'rous dealing of Mcmbassa's Isle. 85 Then to the Sanctuary of thy Port (Whose soft and Royall Treatment may suffice To heale the sick, to cheer the Alamort,) We were conducted by propitious Skyes. Heer sweet Repose, Heer soveraign support, Heer Quiet to our Breasts, Rest to our Eyes, Thou doest impart. Thus (if thou hast attended) Thou hast thy wish; my Narrative is ended. 86 Judge now (O King) if ever Mortalls went Upon so long, upon so desp'rate ways. Think'st Thou Eneas, and the eloquent Vlysses travayl'd so much World, as These? Durst either (of the watry Element, For all the Verses written in their prayse) See so much through his Prowese, through his Art, As I have seen, and shall, or the eighth part? 87 Thou, who didst drink so deep of Helicone, For whom sev'n Cities did contend in fine, Amongst themselves, Rhodes, Smyrna, Colophone, Wise Athens, Chyos, Argos, Salamine, And Thou, whom Italy is prowd to owne, Whose Voyce, first low, then high (always divine, And sweet) thy native Mincius (hearing) fell Asleep, but Tiber did with glory swell: 88 Sing, and advance with praises to the skye Your Demi-Gods, stretching your twanging lungs With Witches; Circes; Gyants of One Eye; Sirens, to rock and charm them with their songs: More, give them (both with Sayls, and Oars) to fly Ciconians; and that Land, where there mates Tongues With Loto toucht, makes them forget they're slaves; Give them, to drop their pilot in the waves: 89 Project them winds (carried in baggs) to take Out, when they list, Am'rous Calypsoes bold; Harpies, their meat to force them to forsake; Hand them to the Elysian shadowes cold: As fine, and as re-fin'd, as ye doe make Your ales (so sweetly dreampt, and so well told) The pure and naked Truth, I tell, will git. The hand, of all the Fabricks of your Wit. 90 Upon the Captain's honyed lips depends Each gaping Hearer with fresh Appetite; When his long Story he concludes and ends, Fraught with high deeds, with Horror, and delight. The vast Thoughts of our Kings, the King commends: And their Warrs, known where're the Sun gives light. The Nation's ancient Valour he extols: The loyalty, and Brav'ry, of their Souls. 91 The People tell (with admiration strook) To one another, what they noted most. Not one of them can off those People look, That came so far, That such dire Seas have crost. But now the Youth of Delos, who re-took The reins, which Lampetusa's Brother lost, Turns them, to sleep with Thetys in the Deep: The King leaves that, in his own House to sleep. 92 “How sweet is Prayse, and justly purchas't Glory “By one's own Actions, when to Heav'n they soare! “Each nobler Soul will strain, to have his story “Match, if not darken, All That went before. “Envy of other's Fame, not transitory, “Screws up illustrious Actions more, and more. “Such, as contend in honorable deeds, “The Spur of high Applause incites their speeds. 93 Those glorious Things Achylles did in War With Alexander sank not half so deep, As the Great Trumpet That proclam'd them, far And neer; He envies this, This makes him weep. The Marathonian Trophies Larums are, Which suffer'd not Themistocles to sleep: He said, no Musick pleas'd his ear so well, As a good Voyce, that did his prayses tell. 94 Vasco De Gama takes great payns, to show Those Navigations which the World up-cryes Deserve not in such gorgeous Robes to go, As his, which doth astonish Earth, and Skyes. True: But that Worthy (who did foster so With Favours, Gifts Rewards, and Dignities The Mantuan Muse) made that Eneas sing, And set the Roman Glory on her wing. 95 Scipios, and Cæsars; Portugal doth yeild; Yeilds Alexanedrs, and Augustusses: But with those lib'ral Arts it doth not guil'd Them though, which would file off their roughnesses. Octavius made compt Verses in the Feild, Fiillng up so the blanks of Business, Forsaken Fulvia will not let me lye Through Cleopatra's charms on Anthony. 96 Brave Cesar marches conquering all France; Nor was his Learning silenc't by his drumme: But (in this hand a Pen, in that a Lance) To th' eloquence of Tully he did come. Scipio (whose Wit in other's Socks did dance) Wrote plays, ev'n wirh that Hand, which had sav'd Rome. Our Homer doted Alexander so, That th'Iliad was his constant Bedfellow. 97 All, That have ere been famous for Command, Were learned too; or lov'd the Learned All: In Latium, Greece, or the most barb'rous Land, But only in unhappy Portugall. I speak it to our shame; the cause no grand Poets adorn our Countrey, is the small Incouragement to such: For how can He Esteem, That understands not Poetrie? 98 For This, and not for want of Ingenie, Virgil and Homer, are not born with Us: Nor will Eneas, and Achylles, bee, (This feirce, Hee pious) if the World hould thus, But (which is worst of all) for ought I see, Fortune hath shapt our Lords, so boysterous, So rude, so carelesse to be known, or know, That they like well enough it should be so. 99 Thankt let the Muses be, by our De Game, To my deer Countrey that my zeale was such, As to commend her noble Toyles to Fame, And her great deeds with a bould hand to touch: For Hee, That's like him (only in his name) Deserves not of Caliope so much, Or Tagus's Nymphs; That They their golden Loom Should leave, to carve his Ancestors a Tomb. 100 Love to my Brethren, and to do things just, Giving all ortingal-Exploits their dues, To serve the Ladies, to procure their gusts, Are th'onely spurr, and int'rest of the Muse. Therefore, for fear of black Oblivion's Rust, Heroick Actions let no man refuse: For by my hand, or some more lofty strain, Vertue will lead him into Honour's Fane. End of the fifth Canto. Sixth Canto. 1 The Pagan King could never entertain The Navigators well enough he thought, The friendship of the Christian King to gain Of men, whose courage had such wonders wrought. It troubled him, his lot should be, to raign So far from EUROPE, with all good things fraught: And that his happy Station had not bin Where Hercules the Mid-Land-Sea let in. 2 With Games, Masks, Revels, Gambals on the Green; With Moorish-Dances (their sport natural); With jovial Fishings (such as Egipt's Queen Pleas'd the out-witted Anthony withal, When Carbonadoed Fish were hang'd unseen On her dropt Hooks he treats the Portingall Each day; with Bauquets, of unusual Fare; With Frits, with Foules, with Flesh, with Fishes rare. 3 But now the Captain (seeing time spend fast, And that the fresh Wind wooes him to be gon) From the indulgent Land taking in hast Th'appointed Pilots, and Provision, Resolves to quit it: of the Ocean vast Having no little Portion yet to run. His leave now takes he of the Pagan free, Who prays from All a lasting Amitie. 4 He prays them more, that Port (such as it is) That all their Fleets would visit, when they pass: For, greater good he doth not wish, then this; To give such men his Realm, and all he has. And whilst he breathes, whilst, what he has, is his; Whilst the least sand is running in his Glass; He will be always ready to lay down For such a King, and People, Life, and Crown. 5 Gama went not behind, in Complement; And, weighing Anchor without more delay, To the rich Kingdoms of the Orient (Which he so long had sought) pursues his way. Now a direct and certain Course he went: The Fleet, this Pilot means not, to betray. Which (therefore) from the hospitable shore Goes now securer, then it came before. 6 The Oriental Billows they divide Now in the Indian Seas: and (spying than Th'Alcove, whence Phebus rose as from a Bride) See their desires fullfill'd within a span. But spightful Thyoneus (grudging the Tyde Of Happiness, which then to smile began On Portingals, who well had earn'd the same) Repines, fumes, curses, and with Rage doth flame. 7 He saw the Stars unanimous, to make Of Lisbon, a new Rome; and that in vain It was for Him to hope (alone) to shake That, which the Supreme Power did ordain. Desp'rate, in fine, Olympus doth forsake, To seek below what There he could not gain. Enters the humid Realm; and to the Court Of Him, that bears the Trident, doth resort. 8 In the abstrusest Grottoes of the Deep, Where th'Ocean hides his head far under ground; There, whence to play their pranks the Billows creep, When (mocking the lowd Tempests) they resound, Neptune resides. There, wanton Sea-Nymphs keep; And other Gods That haunt the Seas profound: Where arched Waves leave many Cities dry, In which abides each watry Deity. 9 The never fadom'd Bottom doth expand A Levell, gravell'd o're with Silver fine; Where lofty Turrets rise from drayned Land, Of Massive stuff, Transparent, crystalline: To which, the neerer you shall hap to stand, The less will you be able to define If it be crystal which your Eye survays, Or diamond, which cast such glorious Rays. 10 The Gates are Massive Gold, richly imbost With ragged Pearlez in their Mother-shell; In goodly Sculpture wrought, of wondrous cost, On which vext Liber's eyes did feed and dwell. Where first old Chaos (in it own selfe lost) Varied with proper shadowes doth excell. Then the Fovvr Elements (transcribed faire From that foule) Copy in their Colours are. 11 There active Fire got highest on the wing, Which without matter did it selfe sustayn, Till (to give Soule to ev'ry living Thing) By bold Prometheus from the Sun twas tane. Next subtle Ayre with the invisible Ring, Gaping for places (importuning, vain) Now vacant in the world, which that doth not Step streight into, though nere so cold, or hot. 12 Warted with Mountains (then) was the low Earth In her green gown shadow'd with fruitfull Trees: Giving those Creatures, to which she gave hirth, Such sustenance as best with each agrees. The carved Water serves her for a Gyrth, And brancht (like Veyns) ore all her Body is: Innumerable sorts of Fishes breeding; Men with her Fish, Earth with her moysturc feeding. 13 Another door upon it carved has The War, between the Gods, and Gyants bold, Beneath great Etna crusht Tiphoius was, Whence crackling flames in sulphur Batts are roll'd. Neptune himself stood heer, of breathing Brass, Striking the ground, in that contention old, When the first Horse, to the rude world, gave Hee; And Pallas the first peacefull olive-Tree. 14 Lyeu.s's Choler would not let him stay To view the rest; and, passing through this Gate, The God, who (told of his Approach) did stay At th'inner Court, receiv'd him there in state: Accompanyed with Nymphs in bright Array; Of whom, each seems to wonder, with her Mate, To see the Water's King, paid one in fine, Of many Visits made the King of Wine. 15 Neptune (quoth he) O! never think it strange, That Bacchus comes thy succour to implore: “For highest pow'rs, and most secure of change, “'Tis envious Fortune's pride, to triumph o're. Call all thy Peers that in the Ocean range, Ere more I speak (if thou wilt hear me more) Down-weight of misery they shall discern. Let them All hear the wrongs which All concern. 16 Neptune (presuming it some hideous thing He would impart) doth Triton streight command To call the Deities inhabiting The frigid Waves, on one; and t'other hand. Triton, who vaunts himself son of the King By Salacee (ador'd in Lusus's Land) Was a great nasty Clown with all that boast: His Father's Trumpet, and his Father's Poast. 17 His thick bush-beard, and his long hair (which hung Dangling upon his shoulders from his head) Were spungy Weeds; so wet; they might be wrung: Which never Comb seem'd to have harrowed. The nitty points thereof, were tag'd, were strung With dark blew Mussels, of their own filth bred. He had (for a Montera) on his Crown The shell of a red Lobster overgrown. 18 His Body naked, and his genitals, That he might swim with greater speed, and ease: But with Maritine little Animals By Hundreds, cover'd, and all hid, vvere these; As Crayfish, Shrimps, and other Fish that cravvles, (Receiving theirs from the pale Moon's increase) Oysters, and Periwinckles vvith their slyme; Snayles, vvith their Houses on their backs that climbe. 19 His great wreath'd Shell, to his black mouth apply'de, With all the might he had, he now did sound; Whose shrill and piercing noyse (heard far and wide O're all the Sea) from wave to wave did bound. Now all those Gods (without excuses) high d To the bright Palace, from their Quarters round, Of that moist God, who built the Walls of Troy, Which angry Greeks did afterwards destroy. 20 Old Father Ocean first (with all the sons And Daughters, he begat, inviron'd) went: Nereus (That married was to Doris) runs, Who peopled all the Crystal Element: The Prophet Protheus (his Flocks left for once To range the bitter Meade at full content) He likewise came; but He already knew What, Father Bacchus to the Ocean drew. 21 Another way came Neptune's snowy Wife (Uran and Vestas daughter soveraign) Grave in her Gate (yet had her Graveness life) And with a Face, that calmd the wand'ring Main. A Robe of Lawn whose Spinster had a strife With Her, That with Minerva strove in vain) Of her bright limbs was the transparent Lid: For they had too much beauty to be hid. 22 Fair Amphitrite (then the flow'rs in May Fresher, and sweeter) would not wanting bee: The Dolphin (who advis'd her to obay The love of the Seas King) with Her brought Shee. The Sun in all his glory, yields the Day To either's Eyes (more worth then all they see). They marched hand in hand (an equal paire) For Both, the Spouses of one Husband, are. 23 That Queen (who, flying Athamas run mad, Came so to compass an immortal State) Went; and with Her her pretty Infant had. (Him too, the Gods did to their Ranks translate) Toying before his Mother tript the Lad With painted Cockles, which salt Seas create: Whom when the looser sand molests and harms; Fair Panopea bears him in her Arms. 24 Likewise that God, who had been once a Man, And, though a powerfull Hearb he chanc'd to tast, Was chang'd t'a Fish; so from that loss began A glorious life, turn'd Deitie at last; Came adding water to the Ocean, Still weeping the lewd Tricks by Circe past On his lov'd Scylla (Hee belov'd by This): “Hate, where it springs from love, so mortall is. 25 Seated (in short) the Powers that rule the seas In the great Hall, majestick, and divine; On gorgeous Cushions first the Goddesses, The Gods in carved Chayres of crystall fine, The King with gracious gestures All did please; His Throne deviding with the King of Wine. The House is filld with that rich sea-bred masse, Which doth Arabian Frankinsence surpasse. 26 When now the whisprings of the Gods were ceast And ceremonies done between the Kings: Burst Thyoneus began from hidden Breast To powre the Cause out of his sufferings. Knitting his brow a little (which confest His leaded Heart hung heavy on the strings) Hee, that with other's weapons he may slay The men of Lusus, thus his cards did play. 27 Prince, who (of right) from one to t'other pole The angry sea dost awe, and dost command, Thou that all earthly creatures dost comptroll, And bridlest Nations with a roape of sand; And (Father Ocean) Thou whose Billows roll About the world, and circumscribe the Land, Least those meet Bounds which are for All decreed, It's proper dwellers should presume t'exceed. 28 And you, Sea-Gods, that wont not to permit Your Kingdom's high perogatives be broke; But, whoso dar'd to trespass upon It, Felt, what it was your vengeance to provoke: What tameness this? what dull lethargick Fit? Who had such pow'r to stay your Anger's stroke, Ready (with cause) upon mankind to fall, Frayle as the Glasse, yet venturing at All? 29 You saw, with what unheard of Insolence The highest Heav'ns they did invade of yore: You saw, how (against Reason, against sense) They did invade the Sea with Sail and Oare: Actions so Prowd, so daring, so immense, You saw; and We see dayly more, and more: That in few years (I fear) of Heav'n and Sea, Men, will be called Gods; and but men, Wee. 30 You see a little Generation now (Call'd by the name of one that serv'd me too) With haughty Bosom, with undanted Brow, Both you, and me, and all the World subdue. You see, your Sea with winged Oak they Plough. Farther, then Roman Eagles ever flew. You see, your Wealth how they propose to drayn, Your Statutes cancel, and your walks profane. 31 When first the Myniæ went about (ye know) To cut a way through the forbidden Flood, How Boreas, and his Fellow Aquilo, (With all the rest) the Trespass then withstood? If They so stormd, if they concern'd were so, That, as their own, your wrong they understood; You (whom it touches in a neerer way) Why sit ye still? for what do ye delay? 32 Nor think (O Gods) that, for your sole concern, And for the great Affront which put I see On you, I have forsook the Court Supern: But for That likewise which is offer'd me. For, all those Honours which my sword did earn, When (as the World, and you, can witness be) India I quell d, and quell'd the Orient, I by this People see trod down, and rent. 33 For the High Ruler, and his Fates (who deale The under-world, as pleases best their mood) Have markt these men for Glory, Pow'r, and Weale, Greater then ever, in the Ocean-Flood. And (Gods) from you I must not now conceale, That they teach sorrow, ev'n to Gods. 'Tis good: We too are slaves to their prepostrous Will; Which gives Ills to the Good, Goods to the Ill. 34 Now therefore from Olympus am I tost, To seek some Cure, some Balsome for my wound: To see, if that esteem, I there have lost, May happily within your Seas be found. More would have said: But Tears the passage crost, Which (trickling down his Cheek in Ropes, that bound His words) with suddain fury did inspire And set the watry Deities on fire. 35 So rough the billows of their Anger went, So swiftly and so high their rage did mount; That no mature advice it did consent, Permit no pawse, no weighing, no discount. Oraers from Neptune are already sent To mighty Eolus, that without Count He slipt the strugling Winds from their strong Caves, And let no Vessel live upon the waves. 36 Protheus rose twice to speak, and went about His judgement in the matter to propound: Nor Any who were present, made a doubt But that it was some Prophecy profound. But still a rising tumult put him out, And in their sence the Gods did so abound, That Thetys stuck not to exclaime; Will you Be teaching Neptune what he hath to do? 37 Then doth the proud Hippotades enlarge From their close prison the enraged Winds; And them with animating words discharge Against the Men of never-daunted minds. For a thick clowd hides Heav'n (as with a Targe) And Argus's hundred Eyes, that guild it, blinds. The swelling blasts have in a trice o'rethrown Tow'rs, Mountains, Houses.—But of that Anon. 38 Whilst in the Deep was held this Parlament, The wearied Fleet (yet free from sad dismay) Before a gentle Wind pursuing went Thorough the tranquil Ocean their long way. That Time it was, when from the Orient Removed is the Lamp that rules the Day: Those of the first did lay them down to sleep, And others come the second Watch to keep. 39 Conquer'd they come with sleep, and (ill awake) Repose their nodding heads against a saile. Their Cloathes (thin, thin) but weak resistance make To the Night's Ayre, which blows a nipping Gale. Yawning, they stretch their Limbs; themselves they shake; With their Seal'd Eyes to ope can scarce prevaile. Cures against sleep they practise, they devise: Tell thousand Tales, tell thousand Histories. 40 What better spur (said one) to post away, Or pastime to deceive the hours, that creep; Then by some pleasant Tale, wherewith we may Knock off the leaden shackles of dull sleep? Quoth Leonardo then (who, whilst a day He hath to live, will faith to Cupid keep) A pleasant Tale? then what can do so well As one of Love? and That, my self will tell. 41 Reply'de Veloso; 'tis not fit, not just, To treat soft subjects in so hard extreams. For a Sea-life (replenisht with disgust) Permits not love, permits not melting Theames. Our Story be of War, bloody, Robust; For we (the Wefts, and Pilgrims of the streames) Are onely born to horror, and distress: Our future dangers whisper me no less. 42 To This they All agreed: and pray'd Velose, What he commended, that himself would doe. I shall (quoth He); then listen to my Prose: I promise you an old Tale, and a true. And (to incite, with apt examples, Those That hear me, great Beginnings to pursue) Of our own Countrey-men shall treat my story: And let it be the Twelve of England's glory. 43 When John the son of Pedro rul'd our Land (Temp'ring his People's mouths with a soft Bit) After he had with a victorious Hand From potent neighbour's jaws deliver'd it; In merry England which, from Cliffs that stand Like Hills of snow) once Albion's name did git) Erynnis dire rank seeds of strife did sow, Whence Lusitanian Lawrels chanc't to grow. 44 'Twixt the fair damsels of the English Court, And Barons bold That did attend the same, A hot dispute, beginning but in sport, To end at last in down-right-earnest came. The Courtiers (though the Courtship is but short That gives reproachful terms to any Dame) Said: They would prove, that such, and such of Them, Had been too lavish of their Honor's gem. 45 And if with Lance in Rest, or Blade in Fist, To take their parts they had, or Knights, or Lords; That They, in open Field, or closed List, Would do them dye, with Spears, or else with Swords. The weaker Sex (unable to resist With deeds, and less to swallow such base words) Condemning Nature, That deny'de them force, Unto their Kin, and servants, had recourse. 46 But their Accusers (mark you?) being great And potent in the Kingdom; neither Kin, Nor humble servant, durst their Cause abet, As their Fame's Champions, which they should have bin. With beauteous Tears (which, from their blissful seat, Might all the Gods to their assistance win) Distilling down each Alablaster Cheek, Unto the Duke Of Lancaster they seek. 47 This puissant Branch, of England's royal Tree, Had warr'd against Casteel with Portugall; Where his Camrades's great Hearts he try'de did see, And their good stars which bare them out in All; Like proof of their respect to Dames had He, When to that Land his daughter he did call; With whose bright Beautie's beams our Monarch strook, The vertuous Princess for his Consort took. 48 He (loath to give them ayd with his own Hand, Lest, so, he should foment a civil flame) Says: when I past to the Iberian Land, To the Castilian Crown to lay my clayme; Such heavenly parts in Portingalls I scand, Such Courtship, Courage, such high thirst of Fame, That they alone (unless I much mistake) With fire and sword your just defence can make. 49 To them then (injur'd Ladies) if you please Ambassadors from me (for you) shall go, Who, with meet Letters and smooth Sentences, The wrong which you sustain to them may show. Let Letters likewise from your selves, your Seas Of Tears indeare; and from your Pens let flow Nectar of Words, to charm them to your Ayd: For there's your Tow'r, There all your hopes are laid. 50 Th'experienc't Duke the Dames this counsell gave, And streight to them Twelve valiant Knights did name; And, that each Dame may know her Champion brave, Bids them cast Lots, their number being the same: And, by this way of Lottry when they have Descry'de which Knight belongs unto which Dame; To her own Knight, in varied phrase, each writes; The King, to All; the Duke, to King, and Knights. 51 The messenger arives in Portugal: The Novelty doth ravish all that Court: The gallant King would be the first of All, Might it with Regal Majestie comport. Each Courtier longs, it to his chance would fall In such a brave Adventure to consort; And each one's glory doth in this consist, To hear his name from the Lancastrian List. 52 In the old loyal City there, whence took Was the eternal name of Portugall; He, to the Rudder who thereof did look, Bad fit a Frig at light, with Oare, and Sayle. Armours and Cloathes (delays they cannot brook) All, of the fashion that did then prevail, The Twelve provide: Helms, Crests, Knots, Motto's neat. Horses, and gay Caparisons compleat. 53 Leave from that King is had, their sayles to losen And pass out of the celebrated Dwere, By Them that had the honor to be chosen Of famous John Of Gaunt, who knew them there. A better, or a worse, in all the dozen (For skill, or force) there was not: Peers they were. But one (Magryse) in whom new thoughts did rise, Bespake his valiant Fellows in this wise. 54 Brothers in Arms, There hath been long in me A strong desire through forraign Lands to range; More Streams, then Tejo's, and fresh Dwere's, to see; Strange Nations, Cities, Laws, and Manners Strange. Since in the World then many Wonders be, And now I find this purpose cannot change; I'l go before by Land (with your good leave) To meet in England, traversing the Sleeve. 55 And if (arrested by his Iron Mace Who is the period of each mortal thing) I hap to fail th'appointed time and place; To you small damage can my failing bring. Fight for your selves, and me to, in that case. But in my aug'ring Eare a Bird doth sing; Chance, Rivers, Mountains (all their malice meeting) In London-Town shall not prevent our greeting. 56 This said, about his valiant Friends he cast (In fine) his Armes; and, licenc't, went his ways. He past rough Leon: both Casteels he past: Towns, won by Lusitanian Arms, survays: Navarre: With Pyrenean Mountains (plac't 'Twixt Spain, and France, as if to part their Frays): Survay'd (in fine) all that is rare in France, To Belgias great Emporium doth advance. 57 Heer (whether sickness 'twere, or fresh Adventer, Advancing not) He many days did stay. But our lev'n Worthies the salt Ocean enter, And to the Northern Climate plough their way. Arriv'd in the first Port, to the great Center Of populous England (London) travail'd They: Lodg'd by the Duke upon the Bank of Thames; Eggd on, and complemented by the Dames. 58 The day was come, and now the hour at hand, When with the dozen English they must fight: The King secur'd the Lists with an arm'd Band: In compleat Steel begins to cloath each Knight: Before each Dame (her Honour's Shield) did stand A Spanish Mars in dazeling Armour bright: Themselves in Colours, and in Gold did shine, With thousand Jewels, joyful and divine. 59 But she, to whom Magriso (who was not Arrived) fell; in mourning Rayment came; Because to have, it was her hapless lot, No Knight, to be the Champion of her fame. Howe're: th' Elev'n (before they leave the Spot) That they will so behave themselves, proclame; As that the Ladies shall victorious be, Though of their number wanted two or three. 60 Upon a high Tribunal took his place The English King, with all his Court about. The Combattants by Three and Three did face, And fowre, and fowre, their Foes; as it fell out. The Sun, from Ganges, till he ends his Race, Sees not another Twelve more strong, more stout, More highly daring, then those English were, Who the lev'n Portingalls confronted there. 61 The golden Bitts the foaming Palfreys champ: Upon the glitt'ring Armes, the Sun curvets, As when roll'd Cakes of Ice reflect his lamp, Or (mingling Rays) on Daneers gems it beats. Now in the Ladyes's hearts some little damp (The Troops prepar'd to charge) the odds begets Of Twelve t'elev'n; when (Loe!) incontinent, A murm'ring uproare round the Scaffolds went. 62 Unto that common Center, where the Rout Began this tumult, ev'ry Face inclines. Enters a Knight on Horse-back, arm'd throughout, As one, who battail presently designes: Salutes the King; the Dames; faceth about, And, with th' Elev'n, the great Magriso joynes. His greedy Arms upon his Friends he throws (Sure Card) to lay them next upon his Foes. 63 Then she that well perceiv'd this was the Knight Who came her honour to defend and rayse, Cloathes too with Helle's Fleece; which (more then bright Vertue) the brutish soule loves, and obays. The signall giv'n, the Trumpets blasts, incite The warlick minds, inflam'd with rage and praise. Spurrs are clapt to, Reyns slackned in a trice, Spears coucht in Rest, Fire from the struck ground flies. 64 The furious Genets seem, in their Career, To make an Earth-quake with their thund'ring Hooves. The Shock, in All that then Spectators were, At once Fear, Pleasure, Admiration, mooves. This, doth not fall, but flye (dismounted cleer); That, Steed, and all (He better Herseman prooves): One, his white Armour in Vermillion washes: One, with his Helmet's plumes his horse-croop lashes. 65 There fell asleep for ever, more then one, And a short step from life to death did make: Here, runs a Horse (the Man strook down) alone: There, stands a Man, whose Horse the Foe down strake. The English Honor tumbles from it's Throne: For two or three of them the Lists forsake. With Shields, Arms, Maile, Those who to Arms appeale, And Hearts of Spanish mettle, have to deale. 66 To lay out words in counting ev'ry gash, Each cruel thrust in that most bloody Fight, Is of those Prodigals of Time, and Trash, That tell you stories which they dreamt last night. Suffice it, I inform you at one dash, Through courage high, through never-equall'd might, The Victory went on the Ladies's side: Ours crop the Bays, and They are justifide. 67 With Balls the Duke, with Feastings, and with joy, Treats the twelve Victors in his Palace faire; With Cooks, the Bevy of bright Dames imploy Nets, Hounds, and Haulks, in Water, Earth, and Aire. For These, their brave Compurgators, would cloy Each day, and hour, with thousand banquets rare, Whilst they in England are content to roam, Without reverting to their dearest Home. 68 But great Magriso (if we trust reports) Great things abroad still greedy to behold, Clung to those parts: where at the Gallick Courts Highly he serv'd the Flandrian' Countess bold. For there (as one unpractis'd in no sports, To which Thou Mars inur'st thy Schollers old) He, hand to hand a French-Man in the Field (Like Rome's Torquatus, and Corvinus) kill'd. 69 Another of the Twelve launcht out, into High Germany: where with an Alman He Had a fierce Combat, who by means undue Thought to have shorn his thred of destinie. Veloso come to a full point; the Crew Pray him, he would not with such brevitie Pass the French Duel, but be more exact Therein: as likewise, in the German Fact. 70 Just here (to drink his words, they list'ning All) The Master (Loe! (who in the Skye did peepe) His whistle sounds. From ev'ry Corner crawle The Saylors, half-awake; and half-asleepe; And, for the wind augments, he bids them fall The Top-sayles, climbing to the Scuttle steep. Awake (he said) ope, and unseale, your Eyes: From yon black clowd, ye see, the Wind does rise. 71 Not fully lor'd the windy Top-sayles were When a great Gust upon a suddain came. Strike, cry'd the Master, (so that all might hear) Strike, strike, the Main-sheet; thrice he did exclame. The hasty winds (for Tyrants have no Eare) Ere struck it could be, rushing thwart the same, Rend it to rags, with such a hideous rash, As if (the World destroy'd) the Poles did clash. 72 Then did the Men strike Heav'n with a joynt-groane, Themselves with horror struck, and pale dismay: For (the Sayle split) the Vessel, hanging prone, A pow'r of Water scoops up from the Sea. Lighten (the Master cryes with mournful tone) Lighten the Ship: if ye would live, obay, Run others to the Pump (w'are at the Brink Of perishing) unto the Pumpe: We sink: 73 Unto the Pumpe th'undanted Soldiers ran: To which no sooner come, their parts to do: But the Ship (stagg'ring like a drunken Man) Their heels tript up, them to the Larbord threw. Not three the sturdiest of the Saylors can Manage the Helm, with all their strength put to. The Ship is bound with Ropes in every part: The Land-men lose their strength, Sea-men their Art. 74 Such the impetuous winds, that to have shown More force, and fury, they could not devise; Had they at once from all the Quarters blown To throw down Babeli, which did threat the skyes. The Ammirall upon the overgrown Mountains of water, shrinks into the size Of her own cock-boat: wondring her selfe, how She did to live in such a sea till now. 75 The second ship (in which was Paul De Game) Had her main mast snapt in the midst and broke: The people in her (almost drown'd) the name Of Him, that came to save the world invoke, With like vain Ecchoes to the Ayre, exclaime In the Third, all Coellios daunted folk; Although that master so good order took, That, e're the storm ariv'd; her sayles were strook. 76 Now All to Heaven are hoysted by the fury And rage of Neptune, terrible and fell: Now to the bottom of his waves All hurry, As if their keels would knock the Gates of Hell. The East, VVest, South, and Northern winds (to woory The world by turns) from ev'ry corner swell. Her self with Torches the deformed Night (With which the Pole is all on fire) doth light. 77 The Halcion along the ratling shore With strayned voyce cryes in a dolefull Key, Rubbing with this the overplayst'red soare Of her own loss; by like tempestuous sea, The amorous Dolphins hide them, which before Did friske and dance about the watry sea; Flying the cruell storm in Caves obscure, Nor in the very bottom are secure 78 Never such red-hot Thunder-bolts were made, Rebelling Gyants to confound and awe, By that foule Smith, who (by his faire wife pray'd) Forg'd a rich Armour for his son in law: Nor ever (by the Thunderer displayd) That frighted paire such flakes of lightning saw In the great Flood (they only left to mourn) Who stones to people (a hard race) did turn. 79 How many mountains did the waves uncrown, Bouncing against them like a batt'ring Ram! How many aged Trees the wind rusht downe, Which by the Cable-roots at once up came! Little thought They, the earth swept with their crowne, To turn their Heels to Heav'n in the low dam, As little thought the sands, which there were hid, To floate upon the top, as then they did. 80 Vasco De Gama (seeing his Hopes crost, Just at the Butt and end of his desire, Seeing the Billowes now to Hell goe post, Now with fresh fury unto Heav'n aspire: Confus'd with horrour giving All for lost, Seeing no humane Fence against such Ire) To that High Povv're (who is the sov'rain Ayd, And can Impossibilities (thus pray'd. 81 Protector of the Quires Angelicall, Whom Heav'n, and Earth, and angry seas obay; Thou, who the Read-sea mad'st a double wall, Through which thy flying Isr'ell to convay; Thou, who didst keep and save thy servant Paul From open Rocks, and Shelvs that hidden lay. And savd'st (with His) from Cataracks down hurl'd The second Planter of the drowned World: 82 If we have past new dangers numerous Of other Scylla's and Charibdesses; Other dire Syrts, and Quicksands, infamous Acroceraunian Rocks in other seas; Why, in the Close, doest thou relinquish us? Why, throw us off, after such scapes a These, If with our labours thou art not offended, If thy sole service be thereby intended? 83 O happy men, whose lot it was to dye On whetted point of Mauritanian Lance; Whilst, smear'd with beawteous dust of Affrick The Christian Faith they (fighting did advance Whose glorious deeds remain in History, Or carv'd in everlasting Verse perchance, Who losing a short life; a long, did git: Death sweetned with the Fame attending it. 84 Whilst this he says, contending Winds (that roare Like two wild Bulls when one with t'other copes) Augment the horrid Tempest more and more, And (ratling) whistle through the Spiny Ropes. The flashing Light'ning never does give o're; The thund'ring such, that there are now no hopes But that Heav'n's Axles will be streight unbuilt: The Elements at one another tilt. 85 But, see, the amorous star, with twinkling Ray, Conspicuous in the Eastern Hemisphere! Fair Harbinger, and Usher of the Day, It visits Earth, and Sea, with forehead cleare. She, from whom arm'd Orion slinks away, And who this Star sits guiding in her Spheare; Spying what Risk her deare Armada ran, At once with Anger, and with feare, grew wan 86 Here hath been Bacchus (says she) I am sure: Will he ne're leave this rancour? but in vain. He shall not wag the Ruine to procure Of mine, but I will have him in the Train. She stoops like Lightning from Olympus pure Upon the troubled Kingdom of the Mayn; Her Nymphs to crown them (as for wagers) bids With waking Roses that new ope their lids. 87 With thousand-colourd Garlands she commands Their flowing locks a little be comptroll'd: (Who would not judge, Love there, with his own hands, Inamell'd painted flow'rs upon true gold?) Her purpose is, to fetter in those bands Th'inamourd Winds, where there they wander bold: The Faces of those loved Nymphs to shew them (More faire then Stars) to charm and to subdue them. 88 And so it prov'd. For she no sooner did, But presently they faint, they dye away. Under their wings their bashful heads they hid: In humble posture at those feet they lay. The slip, Those take them up in; is the thrid Of that bright Hair, which scorns the mid-day's Ray. Then, to her servant Boreas, thus did say His sweet and bosom friend, Orythia. 89 Fierce Boreas, This is not the way to prove That e're thou lov'dst, as thou pretend'st to doe; For meek, and soft as his wings down, is Love: And fury ill beseems a Lover true, Either this madness from thy mind remove. (What shall I say? couldst thou indure a shrew? I shall be frighted with it, wee must sever: “Feare choler may ingender, but love never. 90 Fayre Galatea likewise lays the case To blustring Notus, who, full well she knows, Hath many a long sigh fetcht for that sweet Face, And is at her devotion doth suppose. The Raunter (scarce believing such a grace) His heart, too ample for his bosome grows. The pleasure of his Mistresse to fullfill, He thinks it a cheap bargain, to sit still. 91 The others take the other winds aside, And her too boystrous lover each reproves. They give them to the Queen of Beautie, tyde, Calme as the Lambs and gentle as her doves. She gives them back to them, and (their faith tryde) Promis'd return eternall of their loves: Worn on the Nymphs's white hands, e're thence they stir, In the whole voyage to be true to Hir. 92 Now rising Sol with gold those Mountayns lips Which Ganges (murmuring) washes: when a Boy From the tall Am'rall's scuttle shews the shipps Land, to the prow; with that (late storm's Annoy, And halfe their Voyage, over (each heart skips, Repriev'd from its vain fears. For now with joy, The Pilot (whom Melindians to them put) Cryes: if I err not, Land of CALICUT. 93 This is that Land (I'm sure) for which y'are bound: This, the true India, which we see before: Then (if your vast desires one world can bound) Quiet your Hearts, ye have what ye explore. Now Gama could not hold, when as he found (To his high joy) the Pilot knew the shore, With Knees sticht to the decks, Hands spread to Heaven, Eternall thanks by him to God are given. 94 Thanks he did give to God (and well be might) Who was not onely pleas'd, to Him to show That Land, which he had sought through so great fright, And for the same such shocks did undergo: But snatcht him with strong Hand that very night From watry Grave, through winds that raged so, Through Thunder's stroke, through blasting Lightning's beame As one awak't out of some horrid dreame. 95 By dreadful dangers, by such Brunts as these, By such Herculean labours, and vast toyles, They That in Glorie's Schools take their degrees, Acquire immortal Lawrels and fat spoyls; Not wholly leaning, against rotten Trees Of ancient Houses, not, on empty Styles; Not, on rich Couches, wrapt in Sables soft, Of the Muscovy Merchant dearly bought. 96 Not, by new-fangled dishes exquisite; Not, by eternal Visits tedious; Not, by successive pleasures infinite, Effeminating Bosomes generous; Not, by a never quenched Appetite: Whereby, old Wantons Fortune makes of us To that degree, We know not how to rise, Or step, to any Vertuous Enterprise. 97 No, but by tearing out of Horror's mouth Honours, which we may truely call our owne; By cloathing Steel, incountring Hunger, Drowth, VVatchings, high winds, and Billows overgrown; Conqu'ring dull cold, in Bosome of the South, T'other extreme of the inflamed Zone; Gulleting in, corrupt and putrid meat, The Spice, and Sawce, with which the Valiant eat. 98 And, by accustoming a Face (where doubt Sate once) secure, serene, fearless of Harm, To march through Bullets whizzing round about, And taking here a leg, and there an Arm. These (Honour's Brawn) make a man proof throughout, Make him scorn Mony, and false Honour's charm: Money, and Honours, which light Fortune made; Not Vertue; who is just, solid, and stayd. 99 Shee, shapes an understanding round, and cleer, Experience the Hammer and the File: Shee constant sits (as in a Throne or Spheare) Regarding busie Mortalls with a smyle: Shee (where discretion doth a Kingdom steer, Nor partiall Favour merit doth beguile) Is suddainly caught up, High Rooms to fill: Not, by her seeking; but, against her will. End of the sixth Canto. Seventh Canto. 1 VVellcom, O wellcom (Friends) to that good Land Which by so many hath been coveted, 'Twixt Indus, and the silver Ganges's strand, In the Terrestriall Heav'n that hides his head. Valiant and Happy men, put forth a Hand To crop the Lawrells which from others fled: For (loe!) ye see; before your faces, loe! The Territory where all Riches flow. 2 To you I speake, ye sons of Lusus old; Who, of the world compose so small a stake. What talk I of the world? of that small fold Belov'd by him, who the round world did make. You, whom from conquering of Nations rold In Vice not only dangers did not take; But neither Avarice, or want of love To Holy Church, whose Head is crown'd Above. 3 You (Portingalls) as stout, as ye are Few; Who never care how small your numbers be: You, who are Usurers of losses: you, Who frayle life chaffer for eternitie Thus Providence was pleas'd That him (who drew The shortest lott) we of more use should see T'extend the Fayth, then all the Christian Kings: “So much thou (CHRIST) exaltest little Things! 4 The haughtie Germans, a great Flock (behold! In a large pasture, into Fastions broke; Who (not to be restrayn'd within one Fold, Nor yet content to justify with stroke Of Argument what sev'rally they hold) Some for, and some against the Roman Yoke, Their fatall pistols in that Quarrell span, Which should be all discharg'd at Ottaman. 5 See England's Monarch, styling himself yit For deeds long past King of the Holy Tovvne, The filthy Ismaelite possessing it (What a reproaching Title to a Crovvne!) How in his frozen Confines he doth sit, Feeding on empty smoake of old Renown; Or gets him new, on Christian Foes alone, Not, by recov'ring what was once his own! 6 Meane time an Unbeleiver is for Him Head of Ierusalem on earth, whilst love Of Earth, hath made him an unusefull lim Of the Ierusalem which is Above. Of the French then, what shall we say, or deem, Who (call'd Most Christian) doth his style disprove. Who doth not only n her Ayd not come: But ev'n invites the scourge of Christendome? 7 To Christian's Lands findst thou thy Title good (Having so fayre a Kingdom of thine own) Not, to Cynifius, and Nyle's sev'nfold Flood, Old Enemies to true Religion? There shouldst thou vent the heate of thy French blood, 'Gainst the Rejectors of the Corner-stone. Levvis, and Charles, left thee their Name and seat: Not that which styl'd one Saint; the other Great 8 In the last place, what shall we judge of Them, Who by base sloath, and Ryot (rather Rot) Shorten their days, drown'd in their own wealth's stream, Their ancient Valour, buried, and forgot? From Lux, Oppression springing; from this stem, Dissensions in a people giv'n to plot: I speake to Thee (O Italie) brought loe With thousand Vices. and thine own worst Foe. 9 Ah, foolish Christians! are you, happilie, Those Teeth which Cadmus did to Earth commit, Self-Bane (for Children of one wombe ye bee, And All one heav'nly Father did begit)? The Holy Sepulcher do ye not see Possest by dogs? how Those, themselves can knit, To wrest from you your old Inheritance, And on your shames their name in Arms advance? 10 Ye see it is a principle of state, A rooted custome, in the Hagarene, Armies on Armies to accumulate Against the people That on CHRIST doe leane. But, amongst you, doth sow rank seeds of Hate, And Tares of strife, the Enemie unclean. How can ye sleep secure, how can ye close Your Eyes, having both them, and you, your Foes? 11 If love of powre, and empire uncomptroll'd. Set you a work to conquer others Lands; Both Hermus and Pactolus's streams behold, Rouling into the Ocean golden sands! Assyria spins, and Lydia, thrids of gold; Affrick's rich Mynes imploy her Negroes hands. Against The Turke let Bootie league you all: If not, to see The Holy City Thrall, 12 That Hellish project of the Iron Age, Those Thunderbolts of Warr (the Cannon-Ball) At Turkish Galleys let them spit their Rage, And batter proud Constantinople's Wall. Thence, to their Holes in Caspian Cliffes, ingage The frighted monsters back again to craw'l, And Scythian Wains, that in your Europe build, With barb'rous spawn her civill Countreys fild. 13 The Thracian, Georgian, Greek, Armenian, Cry out upon you, that ye let them pay (Sad Tribute!) to the brutish Alcoran Their Christian-children, to be bred that way: To scourge the arrogant Mahumetan Your hands unite, your heads together lay. Unwise, ungodly, Glory; cease pursuing: By being valiant to your own undoing. 14 But whilst (mad People) you refuse to see, Whilst thirst of your own blood diverts you All; Christian-Indeavours shall not wanting be In this same little House of Portugall. Strong places upon AFFRICK's Coast has she; In ASIA a Style Monarchicall; Dominions in AMERICA she has; And, were there more Worlds, Thither she would pass. 15 And turn we to behold in the mean while, To our Sea-faring Worthies what befell; After that gentle Venus, with a File Of Beauties, the inamour'd Storm did quell: After they came in sight of that vast soyle, Sought with a purpose so unchangeable, The Christian Faith into the same to bring; To introduce new Laws, and a new King. 16 No sooner come at that new Land, a sort Of little Fisher-barks they light among, Directing them the way into the Port Of Calicut, whereto the same belong. Thither they bend their Prows (being the Court Of Malabar) A City fair, and strong: In which a King his Residence did hold, Who, round about, a spacious Land comptrold. 17 On this side Ganges and the Ynd beyand A large and famous Province is markt forth; On the South bounded by the Ocean-Strand, By the Emodian Mountain on the North, Sundry both Laws and Kings obeyth this Land, Sundry pretended Deities ador'th: Some, beastly Mahomet; some, Idols dead; Some, Living Creatures in that Region bred; 18 In that long Mountain, which all ASIA laces (Running athwart so vast a Continent, And borrowing sev'ral names of sev'ral places Through which it runs) Two Fountains have their vent; Whence Ynd, and Ganges (starting for two Races At the same Post, and at the same length spent) Dye in the Indian Sea: Now This, and I hey, Make the true India a Pen-Insula. 19 'Twixt these expiring Rivers's Mouthez wide From the broad Countrey a long point extends, In fashion not unlike a Piramide, Which (fronting Ceylan's Isle) in th'Ocean ends. And where (first thrust out of the Mountain-side) The great Gangetick Arm a Richness lends, Tradition says; the Folk, That there did dwell, Of dainty flow'rs were nourisht with the smell. 20 But the Inhabitants That now are found (In names and manners diff'ring from the old) Are Deliis, the Patans, who most abound In People, and in Countreys which they hold; The Decanies, the Oriaas; That found Their hopes of beeing sav'd, in what th'are told Of sounding Ganges. Then, Bengala's Land; With which can none in Competition stand. 21 Cambaya's Warlike Kingdom (this of yore Held great King Porus, as the fame doth goe): The Kingdom of Narsinga; pow'rful more In Gold, and Jewels, then against a Foe. Here (from the Indian Ocean's Billows hoare) Discerned is of Mountains a long Rowe; Serving for Nat'ral Walls to Malabar, Inroads of those of Canara to bar. 22 Gate the Countrey's Natives call this Ridge: From foot whereof skirts out a narrow Down, Which (backt by that) is by a natural Seige Of angry Seas affronted. Here the Town Of Calicut (undoubted Sov'raign Liege Of all her Neighbours) reares her lofty Crown: Seat of the Empire, Fair, and Rich; and Him That's Lord thereof, they stile the Samorim. 23 The Fleet arriving close to that rich strand, A Portingall is sent in a long-Boate To let the Pagan Monarch understand Their coming from a Region so remote. He (through the River entering the Land, Which enters there the Sea by a wide Throate) With his strange Colour, Physnomy, Attire, Makes all the flocking Multitude admire. 24 Amongst the Rout, which Him did swarm to see, Comes one, trayn'd up in the Arabian's Lore, Having been born in Land of Barbarie, There, where Anteus was obey'd of yore. Whether, the Lusitanian People, He Knew meerly as a neighbour to that shore; Or (bitten with their Steel) was sent so far On Fortune's errand by the chance of War: 25 The Messenger with jocund Face survay'd, He, in plain Spanish gave him thus the Haile; How, to this World, in name of Heav'n (Cam'rade) So distant from thy native Portugale! Op'ning a passage through rough Seas (he said) Which never mortal Wight before did sayle, We come to seek of Indus the great streame, Whereby to propagate the Gospel's beam. 26 Astonisht at so great a Voyage stood The Moor his name Monsayde) briefly told Their sad disasters on the azure Flood, And hair-breadth Scapes, by this same Lusian bold. But since, his main Affair (he understood) Unto the King alone he would unfold; He tells Him, He at present is not there: Being retir'd into the Countrey neer. 27 So that (until the News at Court have bin Of their prodigions passage through the Mayn) Please him, to make his homely Nest, his Inne; With Victuals of the Land hee'l entertain Him There: and, being well refresht therein, Himself will bring him to the Fleet again. For that, the World hath not a thing more sweet; Then in a distant Land when Neighbours meet. 28 The Portingall with Bosome not ingrate Accepts the Offer, kind Monsayde made. As if their friendship were of ancient date, With Him, he eat, and drank, as he was pray'd. Towards the Ships (that done) return they straight: Which the Moor knew, when he the Build survay'd. They climbe the Am'ral: where both Man and Boy, Receive Monsayde with a gen'ral joy. 29 The Captain (rapt) Him in his Arms did squeeze, Hearing the Musick of the Spanish Tongue; And (seated by him) Shreives him by degrees Touching the Land, and things thereto that long. But, as in Thracian Rhodope the Trees, And Bruits, to hear his golden Lute did throng Who did his lost Euridice deplore: So throng'd the common-men to hear the More. 30 He thus begins. O men! whom Nature plac't Neer to the Nest where I my birth did take; What Chance, or stronger Destiny, so vast So hard a Voyage, made you undertake? For some hid cause from Tagus are ye past, And unknown, Minius, through that horrid Lake On which no Barke before did ever floate, To Kingdoms so conceal'd, and so remote. 31 God, God hath brought you: He hath (sure) some grand And special buis'ness here for you to do. For this alone, he leads you by strong Hand Through Foes, Seas, Stormes, and with a heav'nly Clew. India is this, with sev'ral Nations man'd: Great Nature's bounty All beholding to For glist'ring Gold, for sparkling Stones of price, For oderiferous Gums, for burning Spice. 32 The Province ye are anchor'd now upon, Is called Malabar. In the old way It worships Idols: The Religion That bears in all these parts the greatest sway, Held 'tis, by sev'ral Kings: yet onely one Rul'd it of old, as their Traditions say. The last King, was Sarama Perimal, Who in one Monarchy possest it All. 33 But, certain strangers coming to this Ream From Mecha in the Gulph of Arabie, Who brought the Law of Mahomet with Them (In which my Parents educated me) It so befell with their great skill, and stream Of Eloquence, These to that hot degree This Perimal unto their Faith did win, That he propos'd to dye a Saint therein. 34 Ships he provides and therein (curious) For Off rings lades his richest Merchandize; To turn Monastick, and Religious, There, where our Legislative Prophet lies. Having no Heir, left of the Royal House; Before he parted, he did cantonize His Realm. Those servants, he lov'd best, he brings From want, to wealth; from Subjects, to be Kings. 35 To one, Cochin; t'another, Cananour; Chale, t'a Third; t'a Fourth, the Pepper-Isle; To This, Coulan; To That, gives Cranganour; The rest, to them who most deserv'd his smile. One young man onely (who had mighty pow'r On his Affections) was forgot the while. For whom was left poor Calicut alone, A City since; Rich, great, by Traffick growne. 36 This gives he Him: and (to eke out the same) A shining Title Paramount the Rest. That done, his Voyage takes; his life to frame So, as to raign hereafter with the Blest. And hence remain'd of Samorim the name (By which imperial pow'r, and heigth's exprest) To that young man and to his Heirs: from whom This (who the Empire now injoys) is come. 37 The Natives's manners (poor, as well as rich) Are made up all of Lyes, and vanitie. Naked they go: onely a Cloth they stitch About those Parts which must concealed be. Two Ranks they have, of People; Nobles, which Are Nayres stil'd: and Those of base degree Call'd Poleas. To Both the Law prescribes They shall not marry out of their own Tribes. 38 And Those That have been bred up to one Trade, Out of another may not take a Wife; Nor may their Children any thing be made, But what their Parents have been all their life. To touch a Nayre with their Bodye's shade, A scandal is to his Prerogatife. If themselves chance to touch them as they meet, With thousand Rytes himself he washes sweet: 39 Just so the Jewish People did of yore The touch of a Samaritan Eschew. But, when ye come into the Countrey, more, And things of greater strangeness ye shall view. The Nayres onely go to war: Before Their King, they onely stand a Rampire trew Against his Foes. A Sword they alway weild With their right-hand, and with the left a Sheild. 40 Their Prelates are call'd Bramens (an old name, And (amongst them) of great Preheminence): Of his fam'd Sect, who Wisdom did disclame, And took a stile of a more modest sence. They kill no living thing, and highly blame All flesh to eat with wondrous abstinence: But other flesh their Law doth not forbid, Yet They as prone thereto, as if it did. 41 Their Wives are common: but are so to none Save those, who of their Husbands's Kindred are. (O blessed lot, blest Generation, On whom fierce jealousie doth wage no war!) These are the Customes, but not these alone, Which are receiv'd by Those of Malabar. The Land abounds in Trade of all things; Isle, Or firm-Land yields from China unto Nyle. 42 Thus did the Moor recount. But Gossip Fame Crying the Newes about the City went Of a strange people come, with a strange name: To be inform'd the truth when the King sent. Now, through the gaping streets, invirond came: With either Sex, and Ages different, The noble Men dispatched by the King The Gen'rall of the Fleet to Him to bring. 43 And Hee (thus licenc't by the Samorim To disembarque) departs without delay, The noblest of his Lusians hon'ring Him As his bright Trayn (himself more bright then They) The sweet variety of colours trim Dazles the ravisht people all the way, The compast Oare strikes, leisurely the water Of the Sea first; of the fresh River after. 44 Upon the Key a potent Officere, Whom in their Tongue the Catual they call, Begirt with Nayres, stood to welcome There The brave De Game with Pompe unusuall: Whom in his Arms himselfe to land did beare, Then points him to a Cowch Pontificall: On which (their custome of most antient date) Upon mens shoulders he is born in state. 45 Thus Hee of Lusus, Hee of Malabar, Move to the place where them expects the King. The other Portingalls, and Naryes are Their Infantry advancing in a Ring. The multitudes (like Baggage in a War) Confused, pester one and t'other Wing. They would aske questions, but have not the pow'r: Their mouths were stopt for that in Babel's Tow'r 46 Ride talking Gama, and the Catual, Of things which the Occasion ministred: Monsayde the Interpreter of All, As understanding what by each is sed. Thus marching, and ariving where the tall And sumptuous Fabrick did erect it's head Of a rich Temple in the Citie's Center, At the large two leav'd door abrest they enter. 47 There stand the Figures of their Deities Carv'd in cold stone, in dull and stupid wood: In various shapes presented to the Eyes, In various postures as the Feind thought good. Some, in yet more abominable wise, (Chimera-like) with shapes repugnant stood. The Christians (us'd t'adore God-Man) deride To see Men Beasts, and Monsters deifide. 48 One's humane Head a paire of Horns disgraces (Jupiter Hamon stood in Lybia so): Another had one Body, and two Faces, (Thus the old Romans did old Janus show): A Third, with hundred Hands, fifty embraces (Like Briareus) pretends at once to throw: A Fourth Hee grinns with a dogs Face (the plain. Ador'd Anubis in Memphitick Fane). 49 Here, by the barb'rous people of that Sect Their Superstitious Worship being payd; Their course, without digression Both direct To where the King of these vain Gentiles stayd. The Trayn augments; through Those, who the aspect Of the strange Captain to behold, assay'd. Women, and Boys, from all the Houses gaze: These tyle the Roofs; Their Eyes, the Windows glaze. 50 Now they approach with slow and solemn pace The beautiful and oderiferous Bow'rs, Which barr'd the prospect of the Royal Place; In structure sumptuous, though not high in Tow'rs. For They their nobler Buildings interlace With fanning Groves, and aromatick Flow'rs. Thus liv'd enjoying that rude People's King In City, Countrey; and in Winter, Spring. 51 On the fair Frontispieces, Ours descry The subtlety of a Dædalian Hand, Fig'ring the most remote Antiquity In lasting Sculpture of the Indian-Land. So lively are presented to the Eye Those Ancient Times; That They, who understand From learned Writers what the Actions were, May read the Substance in the Shadow There. 52 Appears a copious Army, which doth tread The Oriental Land, Hydaspes laves. By a sleek ruddy Warriour was it led, Fighting with leavy Javelins curl'd in waves. Nysa stood by her Founder: by Her, slid The River's self, washing her winy Caves. So right the God, that Theban-Semble (Had she been present) would have cry'de; 'Tis Hee. 53 Farther, a vast Assyrian multitude, That drank whole Rivers e're they quencht their thurst. A Woman Captain, with rare Form indude; And of a Valour, great, as was her Lust. By her side (never cold) her Palfrey chew'd The foaming Bit, and (fiery) paw'd the dust, (Her Ninus's Rival) with whom yet 'twas done More innocently, then she lov'd her Son. 53 Yet farther; trembled in the fancied wind The glorious Ensignes, Greece triumphant bore (The worlds Third Monarchy) spreading from Ynd One con'qur'ing wing to the Gangetick shore. A young man led them, of a boundless mind, From head to foot with Lawrells cover'd ore: Who would not bee (so high his Thoughts did rove) The son of Philip, but the son of IOVE. 54 The Lusians feasting with these Acts their eyes, The Catual unto the Captaine sayd, The time draws neer, when other Victoryes, Shall blot these out, which thou hast now survayd, Heer shall be graven, modern Histories Of a strange people, that shall us invade. Such our deep Sages find to be our doom, Poring into the things which are to come. 55 By the black Art they doe moreover tell; That, to prevent so great approaching Ill By humane wisdome, tis impossibel: ‘For vaine, is earthly wit, against Heav'n's will– But, say withall; Those strangers shall excell So much in Martiall and in civill skill; That through the World it will in after story, Be sed: The Conqu'rers are the Conquerds glory. 56 Discoursing thus they enter the gilt Hall, Where leanes that Emperor magnificent On the rich Cowch (which take it worke, and all) Could not be matcht beneath the Firmament. His Face and posture (that Majesticall; And this secure) his Fortune represent: His Robes are cloth of gold: A diadem Upon his head, with many a flaming gem. 57 An old man (at his elbow) with grave meen Upon the knee did ever and anon Of a hot plant present him a leaf green; Which, as of custome, he would chaw upon. Then did a Bramen of no mean esteem, Approach De Gama with slow motion; To presant Him unto the Monarch great: Who there before him, nods him to a seate. 59 De Gama seated neer to the rich Bed (His Eyes keeping off) with quick and hungry, The Samorim upon the Habit fed Of his new Guests, their uncouth hew, and Guyse With an emphatick Voyce from a deep head (Which much his embassie did authorize Both with the King, and all the People there) The Captain thus accosts the Royall eare. 60 A potent King (who governs yonder, where Hev'n's ever-rolling wheeles the day adjourn Benighting earth with earth; that Hemisphere Which the sun leaves mourning till his Return) Hearing from Fame (which makes an Ecchoe there) How this Imperiall Crovvn by Thee is worn. (The sum'd up Majestie of Indian Land) Would enter with thee into Friendship's Band. 61 And (through long windings) to thy Court send me, To let the know; that whatsoever stores Goe on the Land, or goe upon the sea, From Tagus there, to Nyle's inriched shores: All that by Zeland Merchants laden be: By tributary Ethiopian-Mores: From seething River, or from frozen Barr: Heapt up and centerd in his Kingdom, are. 62 Then if thou wilt, with leagues and mutuall Tyes Of Peace and Freindship (stable and divine) Allow commerce of superfluities, Which bounteous Nature gave his Realms and Thine, (For Trade brings Opulence and Rarieties, For which the Poor doe sweat, the Rich doe Pine) Of two great fruits, which will from thence redound, His shall the glory; thine, the Gain be sound. 63 And (if it so fall out, that this fast knot Of Amitie be knit between you two) He will assist thee in all adverse lot Of Warr, which in thy Kingdom may insue, With Soldiers, Arms and Shipps; and coldly, not, But as a Brother in that case would doe, It rests, that thou resolve me in the close, What he may trust to touching this propose. 64 This was the Errand of the Captain bold, To whom the Pagan Monarch answer'd thus: Ambassadours from such farr parts, we hold No little honour to our Crown, and Us, Yet shall not in this case our will unfold) Till with our Councell we the thing discuss: What this King is, informing our self well, The people and the Land whereof you tell. 65 In the mean time repose you from the Quoyle Of labour past, and nauseating Seas: Whom we will back dispatch, within a while, With such an answear as shall not displease. Now Night (Task mistresse of all earthly Toyle) Gives humane labours wonted stint; to ease Exhausted lims with sweet Vicissitude: Eyes, with the leaden Hand of sleep subdude 66 In the most noble lodgings of the Court, The Primere Minister of Indian Land (With the Applause of people of each sort) Did feast De Gama, and his valiant Band: The Catuall (that he may make report To his dread Leige, who gave him in command To find it out; which way the strangers came, What Laws, what Faith, what Countrey, and what name) 67 Soon as he spyes the fired Axel-tree Of the fayre Delian youth the day renew, Sends for Monsayde; upon Thorns, to bee At large informed of this Nation new. Prompt and inquisitive, he asks if Hee Can give him full Intelligence and trew, What these strange people are (for he did heare, That to his Country they are neighbours neer.) 68 A punctuall accompt, of every thing He knew of them, he charg'd him to afford; As that which was a service to the King, Whereby to judge of the propos'd accord. Monsayde answers: That which I can bring Of light thereto, is spoken in a Word. Thus much I know; they are of yond fame Spayn, Where Phebus, and my Nest, bathe in the Mayn. 69 By them a certain Prophet is ador'd, Born of a pure and incorrupted Mayd, Conceiving by the Spirit of the Lord, The Lord of life, by whom the world is swayd. Of them, that which my Parents did Record, Was that of bloody Warr the noble Trade To it's full pitch by their strong Arm is wound: Which to our cost their predecessors found. 70 Them (arm'd with vertue above humane strayne) They threw out of their delectable Seates By golden Tagus, and fresh Guadiane, Through glorious and memorable Feats: Nor so content (ploughing the stormy Mayn Toth' Affrick side) ev'n in our owne Retreates Let us not live secure: but pull us out From our Strong walls, and there our Armies rout. 71 Nor have they shown lesse strength of Hand and Brayn, In whatsoever other warrs did chance With many warlick Nations of their Spayne, And some that fell down by the way of France. So that, in fine, no story doth remayne, That ever they were quelld by forreign Lance; Nor for those Hannibals (I will be bound) As yet, was ever a Marcellus found. 72 But if this Information (as I make Accompt it does) appear to Thee too short, Of them, let them inform thee. Thou mayst take (So doe they hate a lye) their own report. Goe view their Fleet, their Arms, and how they rake With founded Brass, which tames the strongest Fort: And it will please thee, of the Portingall To see the ciuill Arts, and Martiall. 73 To see the things the Moor exalted so, Now the Idolater is of a flame, Calls for his Barge in hast, for he will goe To view the ships in which De Gama came. Together from the cover'd shore they rowe: Cov'ring the sea, the Naynes doe the same. They climbe the strong and goodly Ammirall: By her long side aboard doth hand them Paul. 74 Her waste-cloaths Scarlet, and her Banners are Of the rich Fleece which by a worm is bred: In them are painted glorious deeds, in War Atchiev'd by valiant Hands of Worthies dead. Here a pitcht-Field and there a single jar; Fierce one, and t'other: Pictures full of dread! From which, since them the Pagan first did spye, He never could recal his greedy Eye. 75 To know, the Things he sees, he doth beseech. But first, De Gama prays him sit, and prove A little of those delicacies, which Those of the Sect of Epicurus love. The foaming Goblets with the Liquor rich, Devis'd by Noah, swell, their banks above. The Pagan sits; but cannot Eat (he saith) Truth is, it crost a præcept of his Faith. 76 The Trumpet (which in Peace doth represent War, to the Fancy) rends the Ayre. In Thunder The fired Diabolick-Instrument Speaks audibly to it's infernal Founder. The Pagan observs All: but (most intent On the Defunct) seems to confine his wonder. To those brave Deeds, which in a little Spheare Are by Mute Poetry described there. 77 He starts upon his Feet; with Him (betwixt Whom, he was plac't both the De Games: and, from Vascos ride side Coellio. The Moor fixt His Eyes, upon the warlike Transcript dumb Of an old man, who in his Face had mixt Something divine, nor, till the World's one Tomb, Shall ever dye. Clad in the Greekish mode. A Bough in his right hand, what he was show'd. 78 His right hand held a Bough—But O blind man I! That (unwise, and rude) without your clew (Nymphs of Mondego, and the Tagan Stran) A course so long, so intricate, pursue. I lanch into a boundless Ocean, With Wind so contrary; that, unless you Extend your favours, I have cause to think My brittle Barke will in a moment sink. 79 Behold how long, whilst I strain all my pow'rs Your Tagus singing, and your Portugale; Fortune (new Toyles presenting, and new Sow'rs) Through the World draggs me at her Charets-Tayle): Sometimes committed to Seas's rolling Tow'rs, Sometimes to bloody dangers Marteale! Thus I (like desperate Canacee of old) My Pen in this, my Sword in that hand hold. 80 Now by declin'd and scorned poverty Degraded, at Another's Board to eate. Now (in possession of a Fortune high) Thrown back again, farther then ever yet. Now scapt, with my life onely, which hung by A single Thrid (ev'n that a load too great): That 'tis no less a wonder, I am here, Then Juda's King's new lease of fifteen yeere. 81 Nay more (my Nymphs) I thus being made an Isle And Rock of want (surunded by my Woes) The same, whom I swam singing all that while, Gave me, for all my Verses, but course Prose. Instead of hoped Rest for long Exile, Of Bays to thatch my head (which bald now grows): Unworthy scandals they therein did hayle, Which laid me in a miserable Jayle. 82 See, Nymphs, what learned Lords your Tagus breeds! What Patrons of good Arts we live among! Are these the favors, and are these the meeds, For Him That makes them glorious with his Song? What Precedents are these, what likely seeds To raise in future curious Wits and strong, To register the Acts of all those men, That merit Fame from an immortal Pen? 83 Then in this Flood of Ills let it suffice That your sole grace and favour I obtain; And chiefly here, where such Varieties Of honorable deeds I must explain. Give it me onely you: For (by your Eyes) On any, that deserves it not, one grain I will not spend: not flatter Dukes, nor KINGS, Pain of ungrateful to your sacred springs. 84 Nor think, O Nymphs, I'l waste your pretious Fame On Him, who to his King and Countrey's weal Prefers his private interest (The same Will from the Throne, yea from the Altar, steale). No, no Ambitious man shall hide his shame Under my leaves, who mounts, that he may deale More largely to his Lusts, and exercise His Office, not, but his impieties. 85 No man, That stalks with popularity, Thereby to catch the Prey he hath design'd: Who, with the erring Vulgar to comply, Changeth as oft as Protheus, or the Wind. Nor (Muses) fear, that ever sing will I Whom, with grave Face, grave case, grave pace, I find (To please the King in the new Place he's in) Fleece the poor People to the very skin. 86 Nor Him, who finds it just (and so it is) The King's Laws should be kept in ev'ry thing: But does not find it just (and that's amis) To pay the sweat of those that serve the King. Nor Him, who says his Book, and thinks with This (Though unexperienc't) he hath wit to bring All to his Rules: and, with a niggard Hand, Rates services, he doth not understand. 87 Those (and those Worthies onely) will I sing, Who their dear lives have ventur'd and laid down, First for their GOD, and after for their King; To be repaid with use in due renown. Help me Apollo, and the Muses's Ring, With doubled Rage their Lawrell d heads to crown: Whilst (almost tyr'd) I here take breath a while, So with fresh Spirits to renew my Toyle. End of the seventh Canto. Eighth Canto. 1 On the first Figure stuck the Hagarene, Which in the waving Flag did come and go: Upon a leavie staffe it seem'd to leane, With a long combed Beard, white as the snow. Who this grave Warriour is, and what should meane That same device he bears, he longs to know. Paul tells him: whose wise words which here insue, Monsayde rendred, who both Idioms knew. 2 These Figures all (which, moving, seem alive) As fierce and warlike as they show, for here; By the bright fame that doth of them survive, In truth, and Fact, more fierce and warlike were. They stand far off in time: Through perspective Of cleer Wits yet, they loom both great and neer. This thou now seest, is Lusus, from whom Fame Gives to our Kingdom Lusitania's name. 3 He was that Theban's Son, or else Camrade, Who in so many Lands did Lawrels gaine. Following the Wars (which he did make his Trade) This Lusus built at length a Nest in Spaine, With those delicious Fields so well apaid (Th'Elysian once) 'twixt Dwere, and Guadiane; That there he set up his long Rest. He gave A Name, to Those; and Those, to Him, a Grave. 4 The leavy staffe (he bears for his Device) The Thyrsus is, That Bacchus self did beare; Which is to Us, a letter of Advice And this was his own Son, or Friend as deare. Seest Thou Another, who long Seas did slice With wand'ring Keele, and Lands by Tagus there, Where he a Fane to Pallas sacred calls, And is the Author of eternal Walls? 5 It is Ulysses: who that Temple founded For Her with Eloquence his Tongue that guilded. If he in ASIA here fair Troy confounded, In EUROPE there great Lisbon hath he builded. Who may this other be, which dead and wounded That sows the Field (his sword with both hands weilded) Death and Destruction on great Hoasts that flings; Where painted Eagles flye with true ones wings? 6 Thus said the Pagan. Thus replyes De Game. This, thou now seest, a keeper was of Ewes (And know, that Viriatus was his name) But, better then a Hook, a Sword could use. With this, he did affront the Roman Fame, Invincible: nor Fame once got, did loose. No, Rome had ne're with Him, nor shall (that's more) That luck, with Pyrrhus which she had before. 7 By Valour not, but creeping trechery, They rob'd him of his life. Why doest thou wonder? In desp'rate Cases Magnanimity It self, doth teare it's proper laws in sunder. Behold Another (for Indignity Receiv'd) with Us that did his Countrey thunder! To gain immortal Honour he chose well With whom to do it, if he must rebell. 8 With Us, behold, He likewise puts to flight Those Birds that are the Favourites of Jove! So long ago, Nations of greatest might Knew how to yield, when against ours they strove. See with what wyle, and artificial Slight, Our People he to fight his Quarrel drove, Th'inspiring Hind, that helpt him with Advice! He, is Sertorius: she, is his Device. 9 Behold that other Flag! There painted, see, Of our first Kings the great Progenitor! We make him an Hungarian; but, there bee, That do affirm, he was a Lorraignor. After that overcome the Moors had he, Gallegos, and the Leon-Warrior, Went holy Henry to the Holy War: To sanctifie the Trunk whence our Kings are. 10 Surpriz'd with wonder, who is this (demands) Tell me, who this is (cryes the Catuall) That doth, so many Troops, so many Bands, Destroy and scatter with a Force so small? So many Battailes strikes with his own hands? With whose fierce Rams so many strong Tow'rs fall? That fights in blood up to the Saddle-bow, Whilst Flags and Crowns fall at his feet like snow? 11 'Tis first Alphonso (doth De Game return) Who from the Moor all Portugall did take. Fame by the waters of black Styx hath sworn Ne're more to sing of Roman for his sake. He, lov'd of Heav'n, with love of Heav'n did burn; Whom GOD the scourge of Moors (his Foes) did make: Their Throne and Walls broke down to let Christ in, And nothing left there for his Heyrs to win. 12 Had Cæsar fought, had Alexander Great, With such thin Troops, so slender, and so short, Against such num'rous Armies, as were beat By this brave King, of every kind, and sort: Believe t nor He, nor He, with Jove had eat; Nor their proud Fames made such a lowd report. But leave his Acts (too glorious to unfold!) His Vassails deeds are worthy to be told. 13 This, whom thou seest upon his pupil (broke) All patience lost, casting an angry Face; Bidding him rally up his scatt'red Folke, And turn again to justifie the place; Turns the young man, turns the old man That spoke, And turns with, them the day in a small space: Egas the name, which the brave old man hath, Tutor of Mars, myrrour of Subjects faith. 14 There, how he marcheth with his children, look, (Barefoot, and Ropes about their Necks) t'his end; Because the young man, as he undertook, To pay Casteel low Homage could not bend! He rays'd the Seige with Craft, and Oaths he took, When vain were Arms the Rampire to defend. He pays the forfeit with his Babes, and Wife: And, to preserve his Master, gives his life. 15 Less did that Consull, who through folly was Caught at the Caudine Gallows in a Trap, When Him insulting Samnites forc't to pass Under that shameful yoak they there did clap. He, (brave and constant) did himself disgrace, To save his Army in so sad mishap: This gives to shame, and death, himself, his deer Children, and guiltless Spouse: the last goes neer. 16 Seest thou this man, who from an Ambuscade Beats up a King, besieging a strong Town, The Leaguer's rays'd, the King his pris'ner made: A deed great Mars could wish had been his own! See him again (now Head of an Armade) Massacring Moors upon the watry Down! Boarding their Galleys, carrying cleer away Portugal's mayden Victory at Sea! 17 It is Don Fuas Roupinio; on the Land, And on the Ocean, gaining equal Fame: Which from the fired Galleys (neer the Strand Of Avila) shines glorious in their flame. See, how content he fails by the same Hand, The Fortune alter'd, but the Cause the same! Like Palme (deprest in vain) through shafts of Mores His happy Soule to Heav'n triumphant soares. 18 Seest thou not, landing there in strange Attire From a great Navy, Troops Auxiliar; Not without which, our first King did acquire Lisbon (their Prologue to the Holy-War)! Of these, did Henry (famous Knight) expire. Behold Palms sprouting from his Tomb! They are Christ's supernatural Badge, for Him to weare Who, born a German, dyed a Martyr there. 19 See a Priest brandish (not in vain) his Blade Against Arronchez, with revenge sharp whet, To quit for Leyria, which They taken had Who couch the Speare in Rest for Mahomet! 'Tis Prior Teuton.—But, a Seige is laid To Santaren. Look, how Secure, and Great, That Figure plants upon her scaled wall The ever-winning Cinques of Portugall! 20 Behold once more (where Sancho overthrows In a fierce war the Andalusian Moore.) He kills th' Alferez charging through the Foes, And makes Sevilia's Standard mat the floore. Mem Moniz 'tis; (How like his Sire he shows, The Phenix of his Ashes?) worthy sure The Royal Flag, and This; who his, did put Up, with his Hand; the Foe's feld at his foot. 21 See Him, that by his Lance descending slid With the two Centenells's two heads by night, To where he hath his men in ambush hid, With whom he gains the Town by force and slight! That takes for Arms the Knight, who take that did, And the cold Heads in one hand of the Knight. He, That atchiev'd this unexampled deed, His name, is Gerrard: Surname, without dreed. 22 Doest thou not see a wrong'd Castilian By their ninth King Alphonso (for old gall To those of Lara) to the Moors That ran, Making himself a Foe to Portugall? Abrantes with those Infidels he wan With whom into our Countrey he did fall: But a bold Portingall, with a small Force, Here takes him pris'ner; routed Foot and Horse. 23 Don Martin Lopez is the man, that crops The Lawrels he was grasping. But behold An Apostollick Warriour, That chops For Lance of Steel his Crosiers staffe of gold! See, how erect the stagg'ring minds he props! How hot to fight the Moor, his men grown cold! Behold his Vision in auspicious skyes, With which the few he has, he fortifies! 24 Then Sevill's King, and He of Cordoua, With other two, Loe routed! Nor alone Routed, but slain! The strength that got this Day, Was not of Man: God claim'd it as his owne. See now Alcacer hath no more to say, Though, lin'd with steel, her Battlements of stone. To Matthew (Lisbon's Bishop) she submits: Who Sprigs of Palme into his Miter knits. 29 Behold a Master poud'ring from Casteel (A Portingall by Birth) Algarves Land How he does conquer, his devouring Steel Incount'ring none that can the same withstand. Strong Towns (by broad day scal'd) see, what they feel: Such his good star, so certain is his Hand. Big with Revenge (Loe!) Tavila he takes, And makes it smart for the Sev'n Hunters's sakes. 30 See, how of Sylves Master he became By Stratagem! (the Moor paid dearer for't) Correa Don Pelayo is his name, In whom (to envy) Wit and Force consort. But the Payr-Royal thou o reseest of Fame, That did such Fears in French and Spanish Court. By Justs, and Tournaments, and Duels, there, Immortal Lawrels they did win and weare. 31 Loe, by the name of Knights Adventurers, Into the Kingdom of Casteel they come; Where, in Bellonas sports, not one but beares The prize away (they prove true jests to some)! See, dead, the prow'd Castilian Cavaleers, That challeng'd one of them by sound of drum! Rivers Gonzague was He. Propt with his Sword, His Gyant-Fame did Lethe's River ford. 32 Mark well that Knight, by Fame so lov'd and sung, That her old Theames are scorn'd, are out of date! Of his dear Countrey, by one thrid that hung, On his strong shoulders he sustayn'd the weight. See, where (with Anger dide) a peale he rung To a cowd People, and degenerate, That they a stranger's yoake might from them fling, And take the sweet one of their native King. 33 See, through this Counsel, and his prowess too, Guided by God, and his good star alone, What was impossible in humane view, The vast Castilian Army overthrown! See, through his Valour, force, and care, a new Cleer Victory (inferiour unto none) Over a People, fierce as num'rous, Here 'Twixt Guadoana and Guadalquiveer! 30 Seest thou not There how almost routed is The Lusitanian Hoast, through the retreat Of this Religious Leader (whom they miss) Th'assistance of the Lord of Hoasts t'intreat? See, with pale haste he's now found out by his, Who tell him, there's no dealing with so great A Pow'r; that he himself would look thereto, And with his presence cheer his fainting Crew! 31 But see, with what a holy carelesness He answers them; 'Tis yet too soon to goe: As who, by Faith, already did possess The Victory which God will streight bestow. Pompilius thus (his Kingdom in distress By suddain inroad of a potent Foe) To Them That bring him the ill News, replyes; And I (ye see) am off'ring sacrifice. 32 What his name is thou long'st to know (I see) That with such boldness on his GOD did seize: The Lusitanian Scipio it should bee, Were not a greater Nunio Alvarez. O Countrey blest in such a Son as He, Indeed thy Father! whilst Sol compasses This Globe of Neptune, and of Ceres yellow, To mourn again, thou ne're shalt own his fellow. 33 Victorious, see, in the same war, and Cause, Another Captain of a squadron small! He routs Commendum'd Knights, and lays his paws On the great Prey they marcht away withal. See where his reeking Blade again he draws, Rescuing his Friend from Foes That lead him Thrall: His Friend, a martyr for his loyalty! Pedro Rodriguez Landroal was Hee. 34 See yon Faith-breaker, paying an old score And the base pelfe he up at int'rest took! Gil-Fernand-Elvas plays his Auditore, And with the Debtor's death crosses the Book. Here drowns, in their Castilian Owners gore, The Sherrez-Fields (their sacks they may go look). But see Pereyra; who, like Lightning thrown Upon the Foe's Armada, shields his own! 35 Behold, how poor sev'nteen of Portugall (Upon a Mountain) brave resistance make Against four hundred of Casteel, That wall Them in on ev'ry side, to sweep the Stake! But (to their cost) these find a crew so small More then Defendants in that bloody Wake. A deed deserving everlasting Rimes: Match it elsewhere, in old or modern Times. 36 Of Ours (I grant) three hundred did ingage And rout a thousand Romans, in that Time When Viriatus came upon the Stage, And his Fame lightned through each wond'ring Clime. Whence Those, who follow'd him in that brave Age, Left to their Race this Legacie sublime, Never to fear a Foe for multitude: Which, that we do not, pretty well w'have shew'd. 37 Two Princes here (Pedro, and Henry) see Generous Progenie of our first John! The one, sorc'd Fame into High Germanie To lacquay him (defrauding death of one): T'other, to trumpet Him through the wide Sea For it's discov'rer; and (his Pen by thrown) Makes enter'd Ceuta see on t'other side His Lance can prick the bladder of her Pride. 38 Behold the Earle Don Pedro, holding out Two Seiges, 'gainst the pow'r of Barbarie! Behold another Earle, as strong, as stout, As Mars himself, and fam'd for Chevalrie! Who, not content (with Foes claspt round about) Alcacer to defend most gallantly, Of his King too the pretious life defends; And (as his Bulwark there) his own expends. 39 Many a Figure, in these Flags that wants, The Painter (truly) did to add intend, But Pencils he doth lack, lacks Oyle, and Paints: “Meed, Honour, Favour, are Art's Life, Nurse, Frend. The fault in our degenerating Plants From those high Trunks of which they do descend. Of Vanitie we see sufficient Flow'rs: But where's the good Fruit of their Ancestours? 40 Those truly noble Ancestors of theirs (From whom this swelling greatness had it's Rise) For Vertue's love, digested bitter Cares, And of their Houses to inhance the Price. Blind! to intaile (with wealth) sloath on their Heirs (Vertue supplying fewel unto Vice) Disfig'ring them to boot: For, in this case, “The Founder's Glory is his Seed's disgrace. 41 Others there are, with wealth, and Pow'r that flow Above their Banks; nor nobly born, nor faire. The fault of Kings: who on one Minion throw (Sometimes) more then a thousand worthier share. Of These wouldst thou behold the Pictures? No: It is a vanity their Friends can spare. As monstrous Creatures Myrrors fly, or break: So these men hate the Picture that doth speak. 42 I not deny, but some (whom I could name) Deriv'd from great and worthy Ancestry; By high and honorable Parts proclame, And correspond with, their nobility: Who, if the light of their Fore-Fathers Fame Their brighter Vertue do not clarify; Yet, keep it in they do. But, of this Crew, The Painter tells me there are very few. 43 Thus Paul De Gama blazons those great deeds Which there in various Ink are written faire; Which by a Master's hand (whose skill exceeds) In so cleer Perspective there painted are. Th' intentive Catual distinctly reeds The History, as legible, as rare: A thousand times he askt, a thousand heard, The Battails delicate which there appear'd. 44 But cleft was now the Sun's ambiguous light Between the one and t'other Hemisphere; In neither was it day, in neither night, But morning's twylight here, and Ev'nings there: When, from the warlike Ship, the Favourite And noble Nayres, to the City steer To court dull sleep; which broods all living Things Of sable Night under the downy wings. 45 Mean time the famous Augurs of the Land (Who falsly think, or so are thought at least, To see by magick all things beforehand In entrails of a sacrificed Beast) Do their black office, at the King's command, To scrutinize, what shall befall the East By the arrival through the hansell'd Maine, Of these unheard of Guests from unknown Spaine. 46 Of Lyes the Father shews them here signes true; That a strong yoake, which they should ne're remove, Their endless Bondage, shall, this People new, Their wealth's consumption, and their people's prove. The frighted Augurs with pale horror flew. To tell the King, that which infernal Jove Made legible by their astonisht Eyes In the red letters of the Sacrifice. 47 Confirming This, T'a Priest (a Zealous one, And pillar of the Law of Mahomet, Whose Bosome with that Gall did over-run Wherewith both Sects against CHRIST's Law are set, In that false Prophet's shape, who from the Son Of Bond-mayd Hagar did descend) the yet Inraged Bacchus, and who never cleers His filthy stomack, in a Dream appeers. 48 And, guard you, guard you, People mine (quoth He) From Ills provided for you by the Foe, That cuts a passage to you through the Sea: Guard you, before the danger neerer row. Th amazed Moor starts from his Rest, to see Who gave him this Alarum. Thinking Tho, 'Tis but a Dream (like common Dreams, in deep Of Night) returns into the Arms of sleep. 49 Bacchus returns, and says. Knowst thou not (More) The great Law-Giver, who the Alcoran Shew'd thy Fore-Fathers, without which Thy store Would fail, and half thy Flock be Christian? Rude, do I watch for Thee, and doest thou snore? Well, those white Guests (I'd have thee to know, than) Shall bring great dammage to that Law, my Pen Deliver'd over unto stupid Men. 50 Now whilst this People's strength is not yet knit, Think how ye may resist them by all ways. For, when the Sun is in his nonage yit, Upon his morning Beauty Men may gaze: But let him once up to his Zenith git, He strikes them blind with his Meridian Rays: So blind will ye be, if ye look not too't, If ye permit these Cedars to take root. 51 This said: both he, and sleep, vanish at once. The Moor remains: rockt in his Bed with fright. Th'infused poyson working in his sconce, He starts, and to his servants cryes a light. When the new light (which doth precede the Sun's) Disclos'd it self Angelical, and white: The Chief of that vile Sect he did convoke, To whom his Dreame in every point he spoke. 52 Then sev'ral, and cross Reasons they discourse; As they from others, or themselves, dissent. Secret way-layings, open Feud, and Force, And sev'ral ways of each they do invent. But, when those seem'd too fine, and these too course, To take a middle way is their intent. To do their buis'ness with another's Hand, They mean to bribe the Grandees of the Land. 53 With Gold, and other Presents underhand, The ruling men they to their Partie gaine; Giving them speciously to understand, These Guests will put a period to their Raigne: That of lewd Vagabonds they are a Band, Who, plying to and fro the Western Mayne, Live on Pyratick spoyle, without (on fine) Or King, or Laws, or humane, or divine. 54 O how a Perfect King it doth behove To chuse his Favourites and Councell such As are lin'd through with Vertue, and her love; As feel of Conscience a true inward touch! For He (who in the highest Orb doth move) Of things remote can onely have so much Intelligence, whereby to judge, as They That are his outward Organs will convey. 55 Nor ev'n on Vertue let him so much dote, T'adore't in picture, or without Controule T'imploy't; as some, who in a simple Coat Have trust an Hypocrite (a preying Foule) And, if a Saint indeed, hee'l speak by rote In worldly matters: For the Dove like soule Seeld with an Angell's Quill, hath Eyes to find The way to Heav'n, but to the Earth is blind. 56 But here, these avaritious Catuals, Who did that Pagan-Kingdom rule and sway, Brib'd by infernal People to play false, The Portingal-Dispatches did delay. Now the wise Leader of the Portingals, Of all the Indian Prince can do, or say, Caring for nothing back with him to bring But news of this discov'rie to the King: 57 In this alone takes pains. For well he knew, When he should carry back this news alone, That Navies, Arms, and soldiers would insue From Manuel, who fills the Regal Throne; With which to CHRIST, and Him, he would subdue The Globe of Earth, and Sea: That Himselfe's one Sent out but as a Dove, as a Line hurld, To spy, and sound, this Ocean, and this World. 58 Resolv'd he is, the Pagan King to find, And pray dispatch, that he may take his leave; Which now he sees, those spightful People mind (If they can help it) he shall ne're receave. The King, who with suggestions of that kind Was shook and startled you must needs conceave (Too credulous to ev'ry Augur's word, Much more to All, and when the Moors concurr'd): 59 Freez'd with this fear hath his ignoble Brest. On t'other side the sacred Thirst of Gaine (A Vice in Him that's Paramount the rest) Kindles a fire which thaws that Frost againe. For his advantage he sees manifest, If he with cleer intentions entertaine, And with firm Actions cherish, and pursue, The League which Portugal invites him to. 60 His Councell then commanded to attend, He found no One that did in this comply: Because on Those, who should their judgements spend, Money had done it's office pow'rfully. For the magnanimous Captain he doth send. To whom (arriv'd) with a Majestick Eye; If, here, the pure and naked Truth, to me Thou wilt confess; I pardon thee (quoth He). 61 I am assur'd, th' Ambassage thou hast done To me in thy King's name, is meerly coyn'd: For that, nor King, nor Countrey doest Thou own, But (vagabonding) sayl'dst with ev'ry wind. From farthest Spain's remotest Region Would any King, or Prince (in his right mind) A single ship much less a Navy send, Through so incertain ways to the World's end? 62 And, if thy King support his Majesty Which great and potent Realms, which he commands; Thy unknown Truth to prove and testifie, What pretious presents knit this friendship's bands? “In resents rich, in sumptuous Guifts and high, “Kings speak their loves: Their Rhet'rick's in their Hands. A Hand, that gives not Any falsifies: Nor will a Sea-man's testing it suffice. 63 If banisht from thy native soyle thou be (As many a man hath been of great Renown) Welcom, by Jove, both to my Realms, and me: “For to the Valiant ev'ry Land's his own. Or if, a Pyrat, thou infest the Sea; Spare not through fear, or shame, to make that known: “For in all times, a vital breath to draw, “Necessitie hath been exempt from Law. 64 He said. De Gama (finding this new Face Of Things, is from the greedy Catualls; Suborn'd, by Ishmael's malicious Race, The Royal Ear to poyson with things false) With such a high assurance, as the Case Requir'd, instead of fresh Credentials, (Which Venus Acidalia did inspire) To his wise Breast (surcharged) thus gave fire. 65 If the gilt Cup of Lyes (which Man betrayd Out of his Paradice) had not pledg'd bin By our first Parents, and by them convayd From hand to hand through foul original sin; Till in the hand of Mahomet it stayd, Who suckt the very dreggs that were therein: Most mighty King, thou never had'st receiv'd This Calumny by that damn'd Sect conceiv'd. 66 But, in as much as there's no good that's great Done withour great Contract; and Actions tall (For man his bread in his Brows sweat must eat.) That stand on tiptoe, are tript at by All; Therefore they brand me for a Counterfait, Therefore doest Thou my Truth in question call, Although so cleer, that see it needs thou must, Didst thou not credit whom thou shouldst Mistrust. 67 For, if I liv'd by robbing on the Sea, Or (wreck of Fortune) banisht my dear Home; What need I go so far to seek my Prey? For unknown Mansions need I hither roam. What gain, what hopes, could make me in this way To tempt the fury of the waves that foam, Antartick colds, Heats of the burning line, Where Aries hangs, the Equinoxial sign? 68 If on great Gifts of estimation high The credit due to me thou pin and cast; My comming now was onely to descry Where Nature hath thy ancient Kingdome place: But to my Countrey, and Dread Leige, if I Through Fortune's goodness get, long Seas re-past; At my return I promise thee (O King) That such Credentials never man did bring. 69 If unto Thee an uncouth thing it show, That, where her farthest Arm Hesperia flings, A King should send me to thee, Thou should'st know That nothing possible is hard to Kings. Then Kings of Portugals (if this be so) May be allow'd, for spreading of their wings, Something of greater, and of larger scope, Then what is giv'n for common Kings to hope. 70 Know, that for sev'ral Generations past Our Kings have firmly purpos'd in their hearts, With all those Toyles and Dangers to contrast Wherewith Heroick deeds whole Nature thwarts: And (Enemies to sloath) of th'Ocean vast Piercing into the undiscover'd Parts, Aspir'd to know the end of it, and where The farthest Countreys, which it washes, were. 71 The worthy Project of the learned Branch Of that victorious King, who, to displant From his dear Nest, did through the Sea first lanch, Of Avila the last Inhabitant He joyning one unto another planch, (As far from Idle as from Ignorant.) Discover'd all those Parts, which lighted are By Argo, Hydra, th' Altar, and the Hare. 72 Gath'ring fresh courage then from the event, In that those first endeavours prov'd not vain, Discov'ring farther new Advent'rers went Successively the secrets of the Maine. Th'Inhabitants of Affrick, That frequent Her Southern Cape, and never saw CHARLS WAYN, Were seen by These: leaving behind each Isle, And Continent, which Both the Tropicks broyle. 73 With this so high Resolve, and fixt therein, Our Nation quell'd, and triumpht over Chance: Till I, now ending what Those did begin, The farthest Piller in thy Realm advance. Breaking the Element of molten Tyn, Through horrid storms I lead to thee the Dance; From whom (to carry to my King) I ask Onely a sign that I have done my Task. 74 This is Truth (King) For, for so doubtful gain So inconsiderable a Content, As (were it other) I could hope; so vain A lye, and formal, I would scorn t'invent. No, on the restless Bosome of the Mayn, To set my Rest up, I would first consent Forever; and by Tyracy to get An unjust living out of others swet. 75 So that, O King! if my great Veritie Thou hold (as 'tis) for single and sincere; Dispatch me to my Prince with brevitie, Hold me no longer from my Country deare. But if the scruple still remain in thee, Ponder the Reasons I have render'd Here; I lay them in thy piercing judgements scale Secure: “For great is Truth, and will prevail. 76 The King markt all along the Confidence Which De Game ev'n proved his discourse. A full assurance of his Innocence, A perfect credit did this speech inforce. He weighs the copious Words's magnificence, Th'authoritie with which they fetch their source: Thinks now the Catuall deceived is; But He is brib'd: and so he thinks amis, 77 Added to this, his avaritious Eye Upon the gainful Trade of Portugall Makes him obey; and rather to comply With the brave Captain, then the Moorish gall. In short, he bids De Gama presently Get him aboard his Fleet; and, without all Suspect of harm, whatever Merchandice To send ashore to sell, or truck for Spice. 78 In fine, he bids him send of every thing That in Gangetick Kingdoms is not met; If ought that fits them from that Land he bring Where the Land ends begins the Ocean great Now, from the awful presence of the King, Illustrious Gama parteth; to intreat The Catuall, That of the Ports had charge, (His Own from shore) to order him a Barge. 79 A Barge he prays from this illustrious Lord: But this is more, then he is well content (As ruminating mischiefe) to afford: Pretending this and that impediment. Yet (as in order to his going abord) Far from the Royal Court with Him he went, Where he (unnoted by the King) may write, To Avarice what malice did indite. 80 He tells him, yonder afar off, that He Hath imbarcation fitter for his turn; Or that to morrow it may better be, If he till then his going will adjourn. Now did abused Gama plainly see, By this put off unto another morn, The great one too is in the Moorish plot: Which tiI that instant he suspected not. 81 This Catual was one (and first) of Those That were corrupted by that crooked Sect: And whom the Samorim (that lov'd him) chose Th'Affairs of all his Empire to direct. In Him alone those devils now repose. To bring their plotted Treason to effect. He (who consents to break his Master's faith) Steps not an inch beside their chalked path. 82 To be dispatcht De Gama begs, and prays, But begs in vain, in vain he pray'rs lets fall: Protests th'Embarque; now will this please (he says) The noble Successor of Perimal. Why these Impediments, why these delays, When he should fetch the Goods of Portugal? Since, what commands the Sov'raign of a Land, None hath authority to countermand. 83 The bribed Catuall small reck'ning made Of this Protest: rather in spightful mood Some never-heard of Treason (to be waigh'd Out of the Stygian dam) within did brood. Or, how he may imbrew his cursed Blade In those detested veins, consid'ring stood: Or, how the Ships he may blow up, or burn. That they may never into Spaine return. 84 That's it (ev'n that they never see Spaine more) For which the Moors infernal Junta bribe: That so they may not wealthy India's shore Unto the King of Portugal describe. In fine De Game goes not: the Regidore Forbids, in favour of that barb'rous Tribe. Nor without his permission can it be: For a stop laid on all the Boats had He. 85 To all the Captain's importunities, The Pagan bids him in a word, command (For the more ready truck of Merchandize) To have his Ships brought close up to the Land. It is the way of Thieves, and Enemies (He says) at distance with their Fleets to stand. “No sign so sure of one that Ill intends “As to suspect ill dealings from his Frends. 86 Wise Gama understood by half a word, The Cause the Catual did ne'er desire To have the Ships, was, that with fire and Sword He openly might wreake on them his Ire. 'Twas time (he thought) he now himself bestir'd, That he assemble now his Wits intire. His Fancy musters, to defeat all plots: All things he fears, and all things counterplots. 87 As of a Mirrour, the reflected light, Of burnisht Steel, or Cristal without stain, Which struck by Sol (as if in fell despight) Strikes the next man it meets, or Thing again: And (mov'd by nimble Hand of some young spright About the House, who is in gamesome vain) Skips on the Floor, the Roof, the Wall, the Chaire; And has you here, and There, and ev'ry where. 88 So shot the wav'ring Fancy to and fro Of circumspect De Gama; imagining That possibly the Boats, Coellio Might to the shore (as he had order'd) bring. Back to the Navy (if that were) to row, He sends to Him forthwith advertising; On Him, or That, lest ought attempted be By the Moors cruel Infidelitie. 89 Such should be All, who in war's Trade profound Would imitate and match illustrious men; Fly like the Needle all the Compass round, First divine Dangers, and prevent them then, With martial skill try ev'ry depth, and ground, And for the Foe's one fence play shew Him ten; Believe all is, that may be: For (in briefe) “To say, I thought is ugly in a Chiefe. 90 The Malabar protests, that he shall rot In prison, if he send not for the Ships. He (constant, and with noble Anger hot) His haughty menace weighs not at two chips. All, that base malice dares or do, or plot, When her black trailing bowels forth she rips, A lone hee'l bear, e're he will dis-ensure His King's Armada which he hath secure. 91 All that long night, and part he there was held Of the next day, when to the Samorim He means again to go: but was withheld By a strong Guard plac't in the entry dim. The Pagan (seeing how he still rebell'd, And fearing lest the King should punish Him In case he knew, as know he must e're long, If this restraint proceed, the barb'rous wrong) 92 Bids him then send for, and expose to sale, Not some, but all the Merchandise he brought; That men may buy and truck in open scale: “For where free Trade is barr'd there war is sought, De Gama (though he pierce through this thin vaile And plainly views the Evil of his Thought) Consents thereto: because he well doth see That with his Goods he buys his libertie. 93 Th'agreement is, that Boats the Pagan find Such as are fit to Land the Merchandise, For to send his the Captain doth not mind To be embarqu'd, or sunk by Enemies. To fetch such Spanish wares, as Vend in Ynd, Are soon dispatcht, the Indian Almadies. The Captain to his Brother writes, to lade The Goods with which his Ransom must be payd. 94 Landed they are: which wondrously doth please The Catual's infamous Avarice. Therewith doth Diego stay, and Alvarez: With pow'r to truck, or sell them at a price. That (more, then King, Pray'rs, Honor, or All these, Upon a soul infected with that Vice) A Bribe can do, the Pagan heer doth show: Who, for the Goods did let De Gama go. 95 For Those, he lets Him go: before he quit The Pawn, on which he now hath layd his hand, Meaning a better penny thence to git Then if he kept the Captain still on Land. He (scapt out of the Trap) thinks it no wit On t'other side, to come within command Again: but (safely got aboard his Fleet) In his own Nest takes sleeps secure, and sweet 96 At leisure then he walks upon his Decks To see what Time and Patience will bring forth. No Ruler hath he there to make him vex: Imperious, brib'd, without or shame, or worth. Now let the judging Reader mark what Rex The Idol Gold (which all the World ador'th) Plays both in Poor and Rich: by Money's Thurst All Laws and Tyes (Divine, and Humane) burst. 97 Slain by the Tracian King, to seize a vast Intrusted Treasure, Polidoro was. When stern Acrysius thought his Daughter fast, A Show'r of gold did pierce a Tow'r of Brass. The yellow Bracelets of the Foes, did cast Such tempting beams on the Tarpeian Lass, That she, for Those, the Tow'r of Rome unbarr'd: Who brain'd her with the Bribe for a reward. 98 This strongest Forts subverts, and overthrows: Makes Kindred, Kindred; and Friends, Friends betray. This noble-men ignobly doth dispose: Delivers Captains to their Foes a Prey. This blasts of pure Virginitie the Rose: Trampling on Fame and honour by the way. This bribes ev'n Lib'rall Arts (it's pow'r is such) Makes Judgement have no sight, Conscience no touch. 99 This, in unheard of Sences Text doth take: This makes and unmakes Laws in the same case: This perjures Subjects, and This Kings doth make Stoop to the Lure, like Eagles from their place. Ev'n golden minds (of those That All forsake For GOD) this Antichimist doth debase To vilest mettle: with this Diff'rence though, That still These glister with a holy show. End of the eighth Canto. Ninth Canto. 1 Long in the City the Two Factors lay, Without dispatching off the Merchandize. So many rubbs are scatter'd in their way By the false Infidels, that no man buyes. All, These design thereby; is to delay India's Discov'rers There (whom they call spyes) Arriv'd till they the Fleet of Mecha see, With which this other overwhelm'd may be. 2 At the far end o'th'Erithrean Sea Where (calling it by his dear Sister's name) The goodly City of Arsinoe (Which afterwards to be call'd Suez came) Was founded by Egyptian Ptolome, The Port of Mecha lyes: which hath it's fame From Mahom's superstitious Lavatory, Promising Heav'n through watry Purgatory. 3 Gidda the Port is call'd, in which did meet The Trade of that Red Sea and flourisht most: The Gain whereof was not a little sweet To Egypt's Soldan who then rul'd that Coast. From hence to Malabar a warlike Fleet Of Infidells the Indian Ocean crost Each yeer; in that Emporium to find Health-giving Drugs, and Spices of each kind. 4 The Ships expected by the Moors, are These, With which (not onely great, but built for Fight) Them, who supplant their Traffick in those Seas, To wrap and burn in crackling flames and bright. In this Sure Card themselves they so much please, That, all they wish to gorge their Appetite, Is, that the Strangers will but stay so long Till from fam'd Mecha come this Navy strong. 5 But the Great Governor of Heav'n and Earth (Who, for what He before all Time did doom, Likewise decreed fit means, which to the birth Should bring the same when the full Time should come) Kindled unlikely love on the cold Hearth Of a Moor's breast (Monsaydes) sending whom Before, He to De Gama gave advice Of All, and for his payns had Paradice. 6 This man (of whom the Moors had no suspition, Being one himself, but on the contrary To all their secret junta's gave admission) Did to the Captain this foule play descry. He visits oft the Fleet, and repetition Makes of his visits oft, though far it lye: To heart he lays the danger it is in, Through the black Project of the Saracin. 7 He tells the cautious Gama of the Fleet Which from Arabian Mecha comes each yeere. And how those Countrey men do thirst to see't, As a sure Engin to destroy him there. That it comes stuft with Soldiers, and in It Doth horrid Thunderbolts of Vulcan beare: So that consid'ring, how his own is brusht. It may thereby be overpowr'd and crusht. 8 De Gama, besides this, considering That now the time it self calls him away; And that for better answer from the King (Who loves the Moors) he may till doomsday stay: Sends one ashore, the Factors summoning To come aboard forthwith; and, lest that They Be stopt, if their intent perceiv'd should be; Commands them do it with all secresie. 9 But long it was not e're a rumour went (And it fell out to be a rumour true) That the two Factors were to prison sent, 'Cause from the City they by stealth withdrew. The Captain, seeing which way the world went, Seiz'd (by Reprisal) without more ado Some, That were then aboard his ship, lin'd well With Precious Stones which they desir'd to sell. 10 Grave Citizens, and wealthy were These all; Well known, and well allide in Calicut: Therefore, to see them bound for Portugall, Into an uproare did the City put. For streight to work the sturdy Sea-men fall: The Capstone roles, their sev'ral strengths set to't In sev'ral manners: some the Cable halling, With the Bar others their hard bosoms galling. 11 This, hangs by the main-yard; and now untyes The flowing Saile, with a great cry displayd: When to the Samorim with greater cryes Is told how hastily the Captain waigh'd. Their Wives and Children (trust up in this wise That are) a noyse, as they were murther'd made In the King's hearing; screaming they should lose, These their dear Fathers: their deare Husbands, Those. 12 The Lusitanian Merchants; with the Ware, (There's no delaying) freely he remands, Although thereat the Moors do stamp and stare, Or else his own must visit uncouth Lands. With all excuses, to make things look faire, Sends to his King. De Game (who understands The Restitution, better then the Cringe) Returns some Blacks, and gives the ships their swinge. 13 He coasts it homewards, fully satisfy'de That he in vain solicits with that King A peace and friendship, to be ratify'de By mutual Trade, as he propos'd the thing. But, having now that noble Land descry'de Which lay much hid under the Morning's wing, For his deare Countrey with this news is bound: Carrying sure signes of that which he hath found. 14 He carries Malabars, retain'd by Him Perforce, of Those, who the stopt Factors brought Aboard from the inforced Samorim. He carries burning Pepper, which he brought; Nutmegs (the which their own dry'de flow'rs up trim) From Banda; the black Clove (for which is sought Moluco's Isle) and Cinnamon, through which Ceylan is noble, beautiful, and rich. 15 All these provided by the diligence Of good Monsayde, whom he carries too: Who fir'd with Evangelick influence To have his name writ in Christ's book doth sue. O happy Affrican! whom PROVIDENCE DIVINE, out of infernal darkness drew; And, so far from thy Countrey, found a way To thy true Countrey to reduce thee, stray. 16 Thus vanish from the spicy Territory The happy ships, whose Prows directly stand Of Good Hope pointing at The Promontory (South-Bound of Nature fixt by her own Hand); Bearing the evidence and welcom story To Lisbon of the Oriental Land: Once more committed to the rude annoy Of Seas uncertain betwixt fear and joy. 17 That they are going to their Countrey deare, To their dear Parents, and Aboads at last, To tell their wond'rous Navigation, there, The various Nations seen, and Dangers past; That now the Harvest of their Toyles is neare, The Fruits of their Adventure ripe to tast; Is such a joy as cannot be exprest By their faint Tongue pent in their narrow Brest. 18 But Cyprus's Queen, who by the King of Heav'n Was made the Lusitanians's Patroness, And for a Guardian Angel to them giv'n, To whom she many yeers hath prov'd no less; Glory, for which they have so bravely striv'n, Amends for their so well indur'd distress, Means them by way of earnest beforehand; And in sad Seas the Pleasures of the Land. 19 Having a while revolved in her thought The world of Sea which they have back to pass, The world of Woes, that God on them had brought In Amphionian Thebes twice-born that was: It is her purpose, joys, so dearly bought With Griefs, to fill them in an ample glass; To cook them some delights, find them some nest, Where in the rolling Empire they may rest. 20 In fine an Inn of pleasure by the way To bait and strengthen tyr'd Humanity: To give her gallant Sea-men (not their Pay, But) the use here of fair Eternity. She means to tell't her Son, and well she may; For, with his shafts it is, she makes the high Gods, stoop to the base ground: and, with his fire, Unworthy mortals to bright Heav'n aspire. 21 This well digested, she resolves in fine There, in the middle of the briny frost, To have in readiness an Isle Divine, With flow'rs on green inameld and imbost: For she hath many in those Seas, which joyne To that blest Land which our first mother lost; Besides those sweet ones in the Midland Seas, Impounded by the Gates of Hercules. 22 There will she have th' Aquatick maids prepare To these rare men their graces to impart; All that are honor'd with the name of Faire (The glory of the Eye, Bane of the Heart) With Balls, and Banquets blithe and debonayre: For she inspires into their brests the dart Of secret love, that they with all their might Of their Gallants may study the delight. 23 Such once her Project, for the man she bare To Troy's Anchises neer to Simois's flood; To get him welcome in that City fair Which in the compass of an Oxe-hide stood. Her boy she seeks (for, without Him, her rare Beauty is nothing) Cupid giv'n to blood: That, as to Him of yore she recommends Her sayling son, so now, her sayling Frends. 24 She yoaks those Birds unto her Coach of gold Which sing their own sad Dirge with long white necks: And those, into the which was turn'd of old Peristera, That gather'd flow'rs by pecks. The flying Goddess These in Rings enfold, Exchanging kisses with lascivious Beaks. She, where she passes, makes the Wind to lye With gentle motion, and serenes the skye. 25 Over Idalian Mountains now she hung, The winged Boy residing in that Land, To get an Army up of Bow-men young. For a great War which he hath then in hand Against the rebel World; where late have sprung Much Weeds, as he is giv'n to understand: Loving those things, wherewith 'tis richly stor'd, To be made use of, not to be ador'd. 26 He sees Acteon hunting, so inclin'd To that mad sport, and brutal exercise, That a deform'd wild-beast to follow (blind) The Beauty of a humane Face he flyes: And (to torment him with a Fair Unkind) Shews stript Diana to his gazing eyes. Now, let him take good heed he do not prove A Prey, ev'n to those Hounds he doth so love. 27 He sees the great ones of each Land, that none Have Publike Good so much as in their Eye: Sees they love nothing but themselves alone; Which is part Intrest, and part Philautye. Courtiers he sees (men That besiege a Throne) How for true Doctrine they vent Flattery. 'Tis husbandry these like not in a King To weed the Flow'rs out of his Corn in Spring. 28 He sees, how Those that owe a vowed love To Povertie, and Charitie to Men, Love Riches onely, and to floate Above, Pretending justice, and a Conscience clean. They tell the People, what doth Them behove; Obedience, in the deed, the Tongue, the Pen. Laws they set up in favour of the Crown, Laws in the People's favour they pull down. 29 He sees, in fine, none love that which they should But onely what complies with some vain lust: Therefore his hands can he no longer hold From punishments that may be sharp, yet just. His Captains prickt, his Soldiers are inrol'd Fit for a War which undertake be must, With the misgovern'd World: whereby to quell All that persist against him to rebel. 30 Swarms of these little Hov'rers (newly flown) At sev'ral works, busie as Bees, are all: Some whetting Arrow-Heads on bloody Hone, Others the shafts of Arrows shaving small. Working they sing, and sing of love alone, And then that Love it is Seraphical: In Parts; and in the burthen all do joyne; The Ditty excellent, the Tune Divine. 31 On the immortal Anviles (where their Arts They use, the steeled points to forge, and fit) Instead of Embers there are burning Hearts, Which bring their Bellows with them (panting yit): The streams, with which they temper their steel'd darts, Tears, which from miserable Lovers flit: The sparckling flame, the never quenched fire, (Which burns, and not consumes them) is desire. 32 Some of these Archers exercise their Hand On the hard Bosomes of the Vulgar rude; The bor'd Ayre hiss't (by this we understand The sighings of the wounded multitude); For Sugeons, Nymphs to Cure them ready stand, With Sov'raign Vertue to this end indu'd: Who, to the Hurt not onely life can give, But make, ev'n them that ne're were born to live. 33 Some of these Nymphs are faire, and some are not, According to the Nature of the Wound: Into the blood if once the Taint be got. Oft ugly Treacle gives the Patient sound. There are, whom Spells and Philters do besot; Nayl'd to their Seates, they wiss not how and bound: Where this is, Love hath us'd against fraile Hearts Unlawful weapons, shooting poyson'd darts. 34 From these raw Soldiers, out of ranke and life, A thousand rash, and senceless Darts are sped: A thousand senceless loves are born the while In the low People, to be pittied. Ev'n amongst Those in highest Forms, of vile And horrid Love are thousand patterns read: Biblis, and Myrra, for one sex; for t'other, Th'Assyrian Son, and the Judean Brother. 35 And you (Great Lords) by shepherdesses meane Under the yoke of Love have oft been brought, And you (great Ladies) with rude Clowns uncleane In Vulcan's subtle Nets have oft been caught: Some, watching the dim fall of the Serene; Some, pitchie Night, o're Tiles, or Walls to vaut. Though for these sordid fires (if right we did) More then the Son the Mother should be chid. 36 But the swift Coach now softly on the Green The white Swans (ballanc't in their Harness) put; On which Dione (in whose Cheek is seen The Snow-mixt Rose) sets light her milky foot. The Archer meets her with a jocund meen Who shoots at Heav'n, and doth not miss the But. With Him in Squadron his Sub-Cupids move, To do their Homage to the Queen Of Love. 37 She (not to spend the pretious time in vain) Snatching her Child up, confidently said; Dear Son, in whom, and whose strong Arm, I raign; And the Foundations of my Pow'r are laid; Son, in whom all my strengths always remain; Who feard'st not Them; That made great Jove afraid; I have a special buis'ness to be done, In which I greatly need thy pow'r my Son. 38 The Lusitanian's, harast out, behold! Who are my Care of long Antiquity; Because my Friends (the Fates) to me had told, Wheree're They go, my worshipt name should fly. And, for they imitate my Roman's old In all Heroick Actions, therefore I Resolve, for them to do a Guardian's duty, And raise the Posse of the Realm of Beauty. 39 And, since the malice of the God of Wine Spun them new troubles upon Indian-ground, When from the furies of the swelling Brine They crope out weather-beaten, and half-drown'd; Therefore in middle of the Sea (in fine) Which they their bitter enemies have found, And neer that India, I would have them breathe, And of their Labours the first-fruits receave. 40 As wanton Fishes then therein are strook, So do Thou strike the fair Nereides; That on these Lusitanians they may look With amorous eyes, who carry home the Keys Of their discover'd World. Sick with the Hook Let them on shore an Isle; an Isle (in Seas Immense) which I have deckt with all the Flow'rs Or Zephyrus breathes, out; or Flora, pow'rs. 41 There with a thousand dishes delicate, With oderiferous Wines, and Roses sweet, In crystal Palaces immaculate, In lillie sheets (they whiter then the sheet) In fine with thousand joys past Vulgar rate, Let the obliging Nymphs their Heroes meet (wounded with love) and yield up Nature's treasure, To be all ransackt at the Victor's pleasure. 42 In Neptune's Realm (to which I owe my birth) A fair and manly Off-spring would I have; To serve for pattern to the Bastard-Earth, Which with rebellious Heart thy pow'r doth brave: That men may know, From Thee, the Foe of mirth Hypocrisie, nor walls of brass can save. Ill can it be resisted on the Land, If in the Sea burn thy immortal Brand. 43 She had not ended when the Wag her Son Prepares himself to do as he was told: Calls for his Iv'ry Bow, ingrav'd upon, Whose Arrow-points are tagg'd with heads of Gold. Ravisht with joy the Cyprian Parragon Sets the Boy by her, in her Coach, which troll'd, The rains enlarged to those Birds, whose Song The death of Phaethon laments so long. 44 But we do want a certain necessary Woman, to broke between them Cupid said; Whom, though to Him she had been oft contrary, Yet, of his side, he had as often made: Rash Boaster, who both Lyes and Truths doth carry, Sister to Them that did the Gods invade, Who with a thousand Tongues spreads where she flyes, That which she saw but with a hundred eyes. 45 Her find they out, and make her go before: Who with a ratling Trumpet doth proclame The Praises of the Navigators more Then of all else she e're vouchsaf't to name. Now in the hollows of the Rocks did roare, And the hoarse Waves, the piercing voice of Fame. Truth she relates, and Truth esteem'd to be, For with the Goddess went Credulitie. 46 Brib'd with this Praise, this excellent Report, The Gods (whom Bacchus so inflam'd had erst Against these gallant men, in Neptune's Court) With passion for them are a little pierc't. The female Breasts (that quit with less effort The prejudices they receiv'd at first) Now call it an ill Zeale, a cruel mind, Which to such Vertue made them prove unkind. 47 The bloody Boy strikes while the Iron's hot. Shafts, follow shafs, the Sea roares with his shoots. Some, through the fickle Waves point blanck are shot: Some, hit on Rocks; nor, to be rocks, it boots. Down drop the Nymphs, each hath her deaths wound got, All dart out burning sighs from their heart-Roots; No Face yet seen: “For Shafts, which Love lets flye, “Kill in the Eare as sure as in the Eye. 48 With doubled force the Lad, that tam'd was never, Makes the two horns meet of his Iv'ry Moon. More, then of All, he ayms at Thetys's Liver: For more then All hath she against him done. Now not one shaft is left in all his Quiver, In all the Sea Nymph left alive not one: Or if (being hurt) they live, it is for This, That they may feel how sweet such dying is. 49 Make room, ye azure Billows of the Deep: Loe! Venus comes, and brings the Med'cine with her! The pregnant Sayles on Neptune's surface creep, Like her own Swans, in Gate, out-chest, and Fether. That their desires like equal pace may keep, And neither to great Love complain of either, The Mens bold fires shall press chaste Hymen's bands; The Female-Blush do Beautie's Queen's commands. 50 All the faire Quire of the Nereides Is now prepar'd, and in a lofty Dance (After their loving custome) through the Seas To th'Isle by Venus shew'd, at once advance. The skilful Goddess there erudiates These In all she did, when Love her Breasts did lance. They, whom the Son had conquer'd, are not nice To listen to the Mother's sweet advice. 51 The lofty ships went cutting the vast Sea In their long Voyage to their Countrey deare, Least that, they had, should fail them by the way, Prolling about for water fresh, and cleare. When (to their suddain joy) at break of day Th'inamour'd Isle doth to them All appeare.) Streight Memnon's mother, delicate and faire, Spread all her sweetness through the purged Ayre. 52 They see Aloofe the Island fresh, and green, Which Venus carries floating on the Main, Just as the Wind does their white Sayles; and seen The ships are from the Isle too, but not plain. For, lest by Them o'reshot it should have been, Making her Wish, and Preparations, vain; (What cannot Venus Acidalia do? She mov'd it plum in the Armada's view. 53 But fixt it; when she saw, They saw, and sought The Island with their Keels: so, on the Floods Was Delos fixt, when forth Latona brought Apollo, and the Goddesse Of The Woods. Thither through sliced Seas their way they wrought Where a calm Bay the crooking shore includes, Whose gliss'ning Sands with interfused vains Of purple Cockles Cytherea stains. 54 Three goodly Mountains with a graceful pride Thrust their majestick Heads into the Ayre (With green imbroydred Hangings beautify'de) In this gay Isle delicious, fresh, and fa're. From their three Tops three crystal Springs did glide, Lacing the Liv'ry their rich Margents ware. Jumping on Peebles while their Crystals brake: Such Musick never Water-works did make. 55 In a pure Valley which those Hills divides, As by appointment the three Currents meet, Shaping a Table with proportion'd sides, Broad, and beyond imagination, sweet. A Frenge of Trees hangs over it, and prides It self, in so cleer Glass it self to greet: Now prancks its locks therein, and now retires; Now looks again, and its own form admires. 56 A thousand gallant Trees to Heav'n up-shoot With Apples, odoriferous, and faire: The Orange-tree hath in her sightly fruit The colour Daphne boasted in her Haire: The Citron-tree bends almost to her Root Under the yellow burthen which she bare: The goodly Lemmons with their button-Caps, Hang imitating Virgins fragrant Paps. 57 The savage-trees (That doe the Forest there With leavie-Haire innoble and adorn) Are, Poplars of Alcides; Laurels, deare In vain unto the Golden God Unshorn; Myrtles of Venus; the proud Pine severe, That Cybele for meaner love did scorn. The speared Cypress, from this vale of Vice, Stands pointing at Celestial Paradice: 58 The fruit Pomona gives, Nature bestowes Heer lib'rally, and in the kinds all good; Better then elsewhere it in Gardens growes, 'Tis heer undrest, unplanted in the Wood; The Cherry, that begs outside from the Rose; The Mulberry, stain'd with true-Lovers blood; The Peach, translated from its Mother-soile In Persia, and made better by Exile. 59 Th'ingenuous Pomgranat shews his Heart, With which Thou, Rubie, losest thy esteem: From her lov'd Elme the Vine doth not depart, Her Clusters loading Him, some red, some green: And, Pear pyramidall, if loth thou art To dye before thy time, hide thee between The Leaves; for to anticipate thy Fate Ten thousand feather'd-Minstrels lye in waite. 60 The fine and noble Carpets then (which there Lye to be trod on by the meanest Plant) Make those of Persia, course; and pleasanter These of the gloomy Valley All will grant. Narcissus, there, over the water cleere Hangs his sick head, who what he had, did want. There flaunts the Grand-child-Son of Cynaras, For whom Thou, Paphian Queen, cry'st yet, alas! 61 It was not easie to be understood (The self-same colours seeen in Skyes, and Bow'rs) Whether Aurora lent the Flowers blood, Or borrowed complexion of the Flow'rs There, Zephyrus and Flora painting stood The Vi'let, with the Pale of Paramours; The Flow'r-de-lis, with blew; the lovely Rose, Just such, as in a Virgin's cheek it blows. 62 The Lilly, white; in whose pure snow the print Sits of the Morning's Tears: and Marjorame: The doleful ay, read in the Hyacint; A Flow'r Latona's son loves for the name. Flora bets high Pomona knows no stint, She Vyes with Flow'rs, with fruits This sees the Game: Nor Flow'rs, and Fruits, are All that place affords; The Earth hath Beasts besides, and the Ayre Birds. 63 Along the Lake the snowy Swan did sing, Him Philomela answers from a Bough; Acteon drinks out of the crystal Spring, Nor fears the shadow of his horned Brow. Here the close Hare (to whom her fear gives wing) Starts from her Form; or, from a Brake the Row: The wanton Sparrow, there, to his dear Nest Bears in his Bill the little Chirpers feast. 64 The second Argonauts now disembarke From the tall ships into an Eden green. There, in this Isle, this Forest, or this Parke, The fair Nymphs hide, with purpose to be seen. Some touch the grave Theorba in shades darke, Some the sweet Lute, and gentle Violeen: Others with golden Cross-bows make a show To hunt the Bruits, but do not hunt them though. 65 Thus counsell'd them their Mistress, and her Art's: That so, the more their own desires they Master, And seem a flying prey to their sweethearts, It might make them to follow on the faster. Some (who are Conscious that their skins have darts, And put their trust in naked Alablaster) Bathe in Diaphane streams, their Roabs by-thrown, And ask no Ornament, but what's their own. 66 But the bold Striplings setting on the sand Their nimble feet, which long'd to touch the ground. (For not a man of them but came a land To see what Savage Game might there be found) Dreamt not to finde Game ready to their hand, In that sweet Forest (without snare, or Hound) So Debonayre, so tender, so benigne, As was there hurt by means of Ericine. 67 Some (who with Guns and Cross-bows make account The Royal Stag, and Lordly Buck, to slay) Through the sharp Bushes resolutely mount, And lofty Forest; where no Foot-path lay. Others in Shades (which Phebus's Arrows blount) Walking, or resting, while the Heats away By those sweet Brooks, which (stumbling as they past Over white Peebles) to the Sea did hast. 68 When suddainly, thorow the Green-wood leaves, Variety of Colours they descry; Colours, which soon the judging eye perceives Are not of Roses, or fresh Flow'rs the dye: But, of fine wool; or That, the rich worm weaves: Of which Love makes his Lure, and Sawces high; Of which their Garments Humane Roses make, To make the Bird sell for the Feathers sake. 69 Amaz'd Veloso with a lowd voice cry'd; Strange Game (my masters) in this Forest rise: The ancient Poets Tales are verify'd, And this Isle's sacred to the Deities. Nay, what to humane-fancy is deny'd To hope, or comprehend, see with your Eyes! And see, what wonders, what great blessings then, The world and Nature hide from vulgar men! 70 Chase we these Goddesses; it shall be seen If they be Real or Fantastical. This said (more swift then Bucks o're Pastures green) Through the rough Brakes and Woods darted they All. The Nymphs went flying the thick boughs between, Yet not so Swift, as Artificial. Skreeking, and laughing softly in the close, They let the Greyhounds gain upon the Does. 71 One's golden Tresses up the wind did blow, The light coats of Another as she fled: The desire, kindled by the naked Snow, Upon the dainty Prospect (greedy) fed. This falls on purpose, and whilst she doth go To rise (with kindness, more then Anger, red) He that pursues, falls over her; like one That rubs the Mistress when his Bowle is gone. 72 Others (who Game in other Parts did seek) Chop on the Goddesses that bathing were. These suddainly begin a fearful shreek As if they wonder'd to see Mortals there. Some (sliding through the Laund their Bodies sleek, As who should say; shame less, then force We fear) Scud to the Cops, exposing to the Eye What to the greedy Hand they did deny. 73 There is, That (hiding with a Veile of Glass (Diana-like) if not her Lims, her blushes) Sinks where she stands: There is, That (on the grass Snatching her Cloaths that lye) shoots through the Rushes. Amongst the Rest, an eager Lad there was, Rayments and all, into the Bath that brushes (For, whilst he stript, he feard to lose the Game) To quench in water his tormenting flame. 74 As a rough Water-dog, to fetch and seek That's us'd, and wait upon his Master's gun, Seeing him lay the Steel-Cane to his Cheek, Aym'd at a Duck, or Teal, to him well known; Before the blow, into the stream or creek (Sure of the Quarry) doth impatient run, And, barking, swims: The Lad so, from the shore Swam to the Nymph whom Love had shot before. 75 Another (Leonard) whom Books adorn, Stout, noble, handsom, amorous, and young; On whom God Cupid had not cast one scorn, But all his gall into his potion wrung; So that he well might think, he was not born To any luck in loving; yet, among His faults, 'twas one, that on he still would play (As Gamesters use) in hope 'twould turn one day. 76 'Twas here his fortune, in pursuit to fall Of fair Ephyre (Love's own sister-Twin) But one, who would give dearer then they All, What Nature gave to Her to give agin. On Her, He (spent with running) lowd doth call. O Cruelty, lodg'd in too fair an Inn, If to thy Shrine (quoth he) I'm vowed whole, Stay for my Body, since thou hast my soul! 77 All (out of breath, and weary) Nimph divine, Are yielding to the pressing Enemy. Through Bryers and Thorns Thou onely still fly'st Thine: Who told thee, I am I, that follow thee? If thou were't told it by that star of mine, Which, wheresoe're I fly, shoots after me; Ah! do not credit That: For when as I Did so, thou canst think how it would lye. 78 I tire with tyring Thee, my spirits wast; And if thou fly, thereby to flye my touch, I can assure thee (fair one) stay thou may'st, And yet I ne're the neer, my star is such. Stay, if thou please; and see but (if thou stay'st) The slight of hand, the which my Fate (so much In vain deplor'd) will finde at last, to reare A Wall, between the Sickle and the Eare. 79 O flye me not! So may Time never flye Thy Beauty out of sight. For, do but turn; Dasht with the beams of thy Majestick Eye, No sawcy fire in me will dare to burn. What King could break the force of destiny? What Army conquer it? and mine hath sworn To thwart me still. Yet stay: I'm happy than: And thou shalt do what Kings, nor Armies can. 80 With my malignant star doest Thou take part? To help the stranger is not nobly done. Carriest Thou with thee my Grief-loaden heart? Send it me back, and thou wilt faster run. That Soul of mine, grown heavy with long smart, Hang'd in those Tresses which out-shine the Sun, Does it not clog them? Or, since it came there, Hath it chang'd mood, and weighs but for one Here? 81 With this hope onely thy white feet I trace, That either Thou her weight will not indure, Or she, by being in that heav'nly place, Will change her luck, and better stars procure. And, if that change, flye never such a pace, Love can hit flying I am very sure; And, if he hit, Thou't stay; and, on this score, If thou do stay, of Heav'n I ask no more. 82 The fair Nymph now fled not so much to sell The Jewel dear, for which the Lad pursu'd her; As, the sweet Tunes to hear, that from him fell, And amorous laments with which he woo'd her. Her Eyes (now bath'd in smiles and tractabell) Turn'd upon Him, who with his charms subdu'd her; All melted in pure love, languidly sweet, She lets her self fall at the Victor's feet. 83 O what devouring Kisses (multiply'd) What pretty whimp'rings, did the Grove repeat! What flatt'ring Force! What Anger which did chide Itself, and laught when it began to threat! What more then this the blushing Morning spy'd, And Venus (adding Her's to the Noon's heat) Is better try'd, then guess'd, I must confess: But Those who cannot try it, let them guess. 84 For first with all the Rites of wedlock joyn'd Were the lov'd Sea-men to th'Aquatick Pow'rs: What gentle Tongue, and what white Hand could bind, The Nymphs had added in those sacred Bow'rs. And now their Lovers heads they crowned (kind) With gold, and Lawrel, and abounding Flow'rs: Promise, to keep them company for ever; Whom life, or death with honor, shall not sever. 85 The Chief of them (whom all the rest went after, And did obey in all things her behest, Of Uranus and Holy Vesta Daughter, As by her Face was easie to be guest, Filling with wonderment both Earth, and Water) Th'illustrious Captain, worthy of the Best, With grave and Royal Ceremonies took: Shewing her Greatness in her Pompe and Look. 86 Him (whom she first acquainted with her name, Then, in a kind exordium mixt with state, Gave him to understand she Thither came By the immutable decree of Fate; To Him of the promiscuous Globe and Frame Of the vast Earth, and Ocean, to relate Parts undiscover'd, by Prophetick Spirit: Which He alone, and his brave Spaniards merit) 87 Taking up with her by the hand, she led Unto a Mountain's top, high and divine; Where a rich Pyle erected the prowd head, Of crystal all, with massive gold and fine. Here all the live-long day they rioted In full delight. and sports to sports that joyn. Within the Palace she injoys her love: The others theirs within the flow'ry Grove. 88 Thus, the fair Bevy, thus the Valiant Crew, Divide the How'rs by innocent, by chast Delights, and such as Mortals never knew, In recompence of so long labours past. And thus the meed, to such high Actions due Of noble Prowess; ev'n the World at last Pays (in despight of Envy) with the sound Of a great Name; which Time, nor Place shall bound. 89 For these fair Daughters of the Ocean, Thetys, and the Angellick pensil'd Isle, Are nothing, but sweet Honour, which These wan; With whatsoever makes a life not vile. The priviledges of the Martial Man, The Palm, the Lawrell'd Triumph, the rich spoile; The Admiration purchac't by his sword; These are the joys, this Island doth afford. 90 So those false Godships which Antiquitie, To all illustrious Men a zealous Frend, In Starry Heav'ns created, to which shee Made them on towring wings of Fame t'ascend, For honorable Acts they did, for free And noble Suff'rings (Vertue's path, the end Whereof, is smooth and pleasant like our Isle, Though it self craggie, steep, and full of toile.) 91 What meant they, but an Immortality Giv'n by the World for Actions Soveraign, To such as Arts, or Arms, advanc'd t'a high And heav'nly pitch, being born of humane strain? For Jove, Apollo, Mars, and Mercury, Æneas, Romulus, the Thebans Twain, Juno, Diana, Ceres, Pallas; All Dwell (as you doe) in brittle Earthen Wall. 92 But Fame (the Trumpet of deeds great and good) Gave them new Names and Titles on the Earth; Gods of the whole, and Gods of the half-blood, Gods by Adoption, and Gods by Birth. If ye love Fame then, if make These ye wou'd, (As Men) your patterns, though (as Gods) your Mirth, Fly Sloath; by which the Soule, which Heaven gave To be the Body's Queen, becomes its Slave. 93 Curbe, with a Bit of Iron, Avarice; Ambition curb, to which y'are too too prone; And curb the black and detestable Vice Of Tyranny, and base Oppression. “For these vain Honours, this false Gold, give price “(Unless he have it in himself) to none, “Better deserve them, and to goe without; “Then have them undeserved, without doubt. 94 Either in peace promote impartiall Laws, That so great Fish devour not the small Fry; Or (armed) tear out of the Great Turks jaws The Christians prey, on which he stretcht doth lye. The Kingdoms greatness, by this means ye'll cause; Nor lessen, but augment, your own, thereby. In Riches merited ye will abound; And with true Honor have your Temples crown'd. 95 And to your King ye so pretend to prize, Ye shall bring honour; now, with Councels grave: Now, with your Swords, which will immortalize You, as they have done your Fore-Fathers brave. I ask you not Impossibilities: “He That will, always can. Then, each shall have A Hero's place: or (if that more may move) Be Denizen'd into this Isle Of Love. End of the ninth Canto. Tenth Canto. 1 But now the Larissean Lasses Frend (Who for a wealthier Lover did foregoe The God of Verse) his setting Steeds did bend O're the great Lake of silver Mexico; Sol's burning Rays Favonius did suspend With that cool breath which makes, where it doth blow, Becalmed Jesamines erect their heads, And naked Lillies sit up in their Beds: 2 When the fair Nymphs and Lovers, two abreast, Now Frends and well contented, hand in hand Towards the Palace bright their steps addrest, Which upon Pillars of pure gold did stand; To a most splendid and Opiperous Feast All summon'd thither, by the Queen's command Who had prepar'd it for them, to repaire Consumptive Nature with delicious Fare. 3 There, in rich Chaires of substance crystalline They sit by Two's and Two's, Gallant and dame. At th'upper end, in other of gold fine, Sits the fair Goddesse with renown'd De Game. With Viands delicate in sawce divine (Such as to Cleopatra's Board ne're came) Are heapt the dishes of red burnisht gold: Part of the Treasure which their Seas infold. 4 The fragrant Wines not onely are above Falernian Liquor of Italian growth, But that choice-Nectar sent about by JOVE When Rebel Gyants felt Immortals wroth. In Di'mond-Cups (tempting to mirth, and love) The Ruby sparckles: bubbles the curl'd froth With the powr'd spring. Thus, of their Lovers true The greatest Foe, the watry Nymphs subdue. 5 A thousand pleasant Arguments they touch, Still-laughters pass, quick witty Repartees, 'Twixt dish and dish; whereby, without too much Of Those, to whet the appetite to These. Musical Instruments not wanting (such, As to the damned spirits once gave ease In the dark Vaults of the Infernal Hall) Joyn'd with a Siren's Voice Angelical: 6 The fair Muse sang, and with her shrill Accents (Which from the lofty Battlement rebound) In equal harmony the Instruments, Keeping just time, their softer Notes confound. A suddain Silence curbs the Winds, indents With the hoarse waves to whisper under ground. And the bruit Creatures in their Houses (made By Nature's hand) asleep are sung and playd. 7 With a sweet Voyce she raises to the skies Rare men to come into the world; whose cleare Ideas were beheld by Protheus wise In a Diaphane and Phantastick Sphere, Which in a Dream Jove shew'd to his shut Eyes; And after, He, by Prophecy appeare Made it humid Realms: where this Nymph (took Therewith) got the brave story without book. 8 Matter for Buskin 'tis, and not for Sock, In the Vast Lake that which the Mermaid heard; Beyond what Popas knew, or Demodoke: This King Alcinoo's, That Queen Dido's Bard, Now, my Caliope, I Thee invoke To my last Labour: begging, for reward Of all I write (which I in vain pretend) I may come off with a good tang ith' end. 9 I sink into the Vale of years, and, past My Summer's pride, to Autumn speed amain. And my Wit (more then years) Misfortunes blast; Which Wit I own not now, nor boast my Vein. Sighs blow me to that Port, where all must cast The Anchor never to be weigh'd again. Yet, great Queen of the Muses grant that I May close my Nation's Poem e're I dye. 10 The Siren sang, how from the Tagan shore, Through Seas first open'd by De Gama, now Should Navies come; which all within the Rore Of Indian Seas shall to that Empire bow: And how each Pagan King, who the sweet Lore And yoak those Guests will bring, shall from them throw; With fire and sword by their brave Arm so bit Shall be, that they shall yield to Death, or It. 11 She sang of One, who (being dignify'd, With the High-Priesthood of all Malabar) Because, the knots of Friendship he had ty'd, He would not break with men so singular; Shall let his Fields and Cities be destroy'd With fire and sword, and all the rage of war, Before him, By the potent Samorim: So hateful shall those strangers be to Him. 12 And sings, in Bethlem there, how shipt shall be The Sov'raign remedie of this Disease; The great Pacheco knowing not, that He Carries with Him the Pelian Lance through Seas. But the Sea shall; when, to such great Guests she Unus'd, shall feel his weight: The groaning Trees Of his prowd ship shall know't, which two foot more Shall draw of water, then it did before. 13 But, treading now the Oriental Strand, And left, the Pagan King of spoyld Cochim To ayd, of Portingals with a small Band, Upon the salt and crooked River's Brim; Rout shall he, at the pass of Cambaland, Th'infernal Nayres, That there set on Him: Turning with fear the burning Orient cold, So much done with so little to behold. 14 The Samorim shall raise an Army new; The Kings shall come of Bipur and Tanore From Highlands of Narsinga; what they'll do For their chief Lord, making large Brags before. All the arm'd North he shall assemble too, Which lyes 'twixt Calicut and Cananore, Of both Religions, 'gainst the True that band, The Moors by Sea, the Pagan Powr's by Land. 15 And once more All defeats on Land and Mayn The bold Pacheco, Thunderbolt of War; The multitude unnumberd of the slain Amazing all the Realms of Malabar. The undespairing Emperor again Shall hast to try his Fortune militar; Rating his Men, pouring vain pray'rs and tears To his vain Gods That have nor eyes nor ears. 16 Your Troops shall passes now no more defend, But burn the Pagan's Houses, Towns, and Fanes. The Dog (inrag'd to see they make no end Of laying flat his goodly Towns) ordains His Men, whom he doth prodigally spend, Pacheco's then divided in two Lanes, To charge between them. He together brings His Jaws, and makes two Pincers of his Wings. 17 In person then the Samorim shall come To see what's done, and reinforce his men. Dasht (by a shot which through the Aire doth humme) In his high Chair with blood he shall be then. That Force, nor Policy can overcome This Warriour; now he shall to see begin. Treasons, and Poisons base he shall invent; Which Heav'n (Pacheco's keeper) will prevent. 18 That a sev'nth time he shall return, she sings, To fight the brave unconquer'd Portingall; Whom no Toyls tyre, who dreads no dreadfull Things, Yet this a little discompose him shall. To horrid battail the fell Tyrant brings Engines of Wood, dire and unusuall, To board the Caravels upon the Mayn, Which he till then shall have assay'd in vain. 19 Mountains of Fire shall on the water float The little Navy to consume with flame. The great Pacheco (like himself) this hot And fierce Bravade shall in a trice make vain. No Master in the Art of War (That got Never so high upon the wings of Fame) With all his Palms can neer this Worthy come: Pardon me noble Greece, and nobler Rome. 20 For with a hundred men, or little more, Unto the end so many Battails fought; With such high Stratagems unseen before, On Warlike-Hoasts so many wonders wrought; Seem either Fables dreamt by men that snore, Or that celestial Quires (with Pray'rs down brought) Their Champion in those Exigencies Ayd With Wit, Sleight, Force, and courage undismayd. 21 He, who in Marathonian Fields of old O're vast Darius's pow'rs victorious was; Nor He, who, with three hundred Spartans bold, Of fam'd Thermopilee maintain'd the Pass; Nor Rome's young Cocles, who at bay did hold All the prowd Tuscan pow'r, till cut he has The Bridge behind him: nor old Fabius is Or wise, or valiant, when compar'd with This. 22 But at this point, her high and ratling tone The Nymph abasing, made it hoarse and sad; And with low Voyce (drown'd in her Tears did moan Of so strange Valour a Requital bad. O Belisarius (said she) That art One Who by the Muse will still in price be had; If Mars himself affronted were in Thee, Here is a man that may thy Comfort be. 23 Here thou a Rival hast, as in thy Deeds, So in their cruel and unjust return; In Thee, and Him, misused Vertue bleeds: In Thee, and Him, doth begging Valour mourn: Both Bulwarks of your Kings, Both of your Creeds: Both dye in Hospitals ragged and torn. This those Kings do, whose justice is their will; Their Evidence what Malice shall instill. 24 This those Kings do, who (with smooth Tales misled Of Flatterers, by whom asleep th'are sung, Give the Rewards by Ajax merited Unto the fraudulent Ulysses's tongue. But 'tis reveng'd at full, when, hand o'rehead, They deal their Boons those Sycophants among: By whom, of their ill choice they will be made Ashamed first, and afterwards betraid. 25 But Thou, That such a man couldst leave, to Scorn And Want, O King unjust in this alone! If Thou, to build his Fortunes were't, not born; He was, to give to Thee a potent Throne. And (credit me) whilst Phebus's locks unshorn To light the Earth and Heaven shall be known, Like that Sun glorious shall Pacheco be, And Thou in this Eclipse thy Majestie. 26 Another, loe! (proceeding in her Song) Comes, with a Regal Title, and his Son; Who, on the Sea shall do such things e're long, As by no antient Roman were out-done. They Both, shall win by armed Hand and strong Wealthy Quiloa, and shall sack it, won: Placing therein a mild and loyal King For a false Tyrant, whom they out shall fling. 27 Also, the City of Mombassa (Crown'd With sumptuous Houses, and aerial Spires) Shall by them Both be levell'd with the ground, For an old fault which a new rod requires. But, afterwards, upon the Indian Sound (Cover'd with Ships and Artificial Fires T'o'rewhelm the Portingalls) with Oare, and Sayle, Alone the young Lorenzo shall prevaile. 28 The Caracks of the potent Emperore (Peopling the scorched Ayre with Iron Ball Which from the burning Brass, like Thunder, roare) Tear shall he, Canvas, Rudder, Mast and all. His grappling-books thrown resolutely o're Her lofty Decks, Himself their Admiral Shall enter first; and cleer, with Lance and Sword Four hundred Moors she will have then aboard. 29 But God (whose secret doom is over All: Best judge, of what's his service, and Man's good) Shall bring him then, where Wit nor Prowess shall Have pow'r to stop his Foes prevailing Flood. Neer Choul (where cheaply yet he shall not fall: The purpled Sea there boyling o're with blood). He will be forc't, to leave his life behind, By Fleets of Egypt and Cambaya joyn'd. 30 There shall ennumerable Enemies (Who, with great force alone, great Vertue tire) The Wind that fails. Danger that multiplyes, Upon the Sea; against him All conspire. Now from their Graves let all the Antients rise, A pattern to behold of noble Ire: They shall behold another Sceva, skill'd How to dye piece-meal, but not how to yield. 31 Rob'd of a Thigh (which an unlucky shot In splinters with it through the ayre shall beare) Still does he use his Arms; These fail him not, Nor his great Heart, uncapable of Feare: Until another Bullet breaks the knot Wherewith his Soul and Body marryed were. The prison open, she escapes: and straight Doth find her self in a triumphant state. 32 Soule, go in Peace; from furious War retire, In midst of which Thou inward Peace shalt find. The Body, Him who got it will inspire With high revenge, when he shall see't disjoyn'd. I hear a rumbling storm, I see the fire Of Sacres, Drakes, and Basilisks, combin'd With fell and home-destruction to rebuke The fierce Cambayan and black Mamaluke. 33 Behold! the Father comes a mad man like, In whom for ma st'ry Grief with Fury vyes; Whilst at one time paternal love doth strike Fire on his Heart, pumps water from his Eyes. A noble Anger whispers him, his Pyke Shall blood his Foes, so that the Tyde shall rise In their drown'd Decks knee-deep: Nylus shall bear, Indus shall see his Blows, and Ganges hear. 34 As a Corrival'd Bull, That (practising For a fierce duel) fences with the Oakes; Or, at the Trunck of a broad Beech, doth fling In Thrusts, and with his Horns the Ayre provokes: So Don Francisco (e're his Fleet he bring In swoln Cambaya's Gulph to desp'rate strokes) On Dabul's wealthy City whets his Blade, The Mountain of her Pride a Level made. 35 Then enters (horrid with her blood) the Bay Of Dio: fam'd for Sieges, and pitcht-Fields. The great but Coward-Fleet his look doth fray Of Calicut: which Oars for Lances weilds. That of Melique Yaz (which makes away More slow) with Bolts of Vulcan he unbuilds; To the low bottom of the Ocean sent: Cold mattrice, of the humid Element. 36 But that of Mir Hozem (which with close bords The rowzed wrath of the Avenger stands) Shall swimming see, ith'Ocean of their Lords, Hands without Bodies, Bodies without Hands. The rage-blind Victors, waving their bright Swords, Shall seem to toss so many flaming Brands. What there shall be perceiv'd by Ears, and Eyes, Will be Smoke onely, Iron, Fire, and Cryes. 37 But ah! Of a defeat great Mars might boast (Bound for his Native-Tagus back again) The Fame and glory shall he lose almost By a sad traverse I foresee too plain. The Cape Of Storms (which in it's Desert Coast His Bones and Memory shall ay retain) Shames not to ravish from the world a Soule Whole India could not, and Egypt whole. 38 By savage Cafres, there, shall that be done Which dext'rous Enemies could not perform: And by rude Clubbs (hardned with fire) alone, What Arrows Show'r could not, Bullet's storm. God's secret judgements are not to be known. Vain Gentiles (being a Book above their form) Call it ill Fate, cross Fortune, star maline; Being solely, purely, Providence Divine. 39 O! What new light beginneth there to bud (The Siren said, and rais'd her Voyce thereat) From the Melindian Sea, dy'd with the blood Of Lamo, Ocha, Brava, all laid flat By great De Cunia; who through all the Flood Which laves the Southern-Isles and Shores (but That Of Madagascar chiefly) the wide mouth Of Fame shall fill, and threat the unknown South. 40 This light is of those flames and glitt'ring Arms Wherewith the stubborn Persians of Ormuze, Spurning the yoake, and valiant to their harms, Fierce Alburquerque afterwards subdues. There shall the hissing Shafts (like living swarms) Turn'd in the Ayre, their shooters Helmets bruize; That they may see, with Eyes though ne're so dim, How God will fight for Them, that fight for Him. 41 The Mountains then of Salt will not be able To keep those Bodies from corruption Which on the Coasts shall lye out (miserable) Of Calayat, Mascate, and Gerun; Until the easie yoake and honorable They learn (with all their fierceness) to put on: Forc't by the Conquerours, to pay to Them, Rich Tribute of their Pearles of Baherem. 42 What glorious Palms do I see weaving There, With which his forehead Victory will crown When without shadow or least touch of fear He shall win Goa's Isle of bright renown! But then (the Storm obeying) will not bear So great a Sayle, and takes that Bonet down: To reattempt the thing in fitter season. “Fortune and Mars fear Valour joyn'd with Reason. 43 And (see) he does it; charges undismay'd Through walls, through Pykes, through Bullets, and through fire: Opens the quilted Squadrons with his Blade Of Moors and Pagans knit in Leagues intire! His gallant Soldiers in more blood shall wade Then Lyons pin'd, Bulls prickt with love and Ire; Upon the Feast (as pat as by designe) Of Egypt's Virgin Martyr, Katherine. 44 Nor Him shalt Thou (though potent) scape, and flye, (Though sheltred in the Bosome of the Morn) Malacca (and the Apple of her Eye) Prowd of thy wealthy Dow'r as her first-born. Thy poyson'd Arrows, those Auxiliary Cryses I see (thy Pay That do not scorn) Malaccans amorous, valiant Javans, Shall all obey the Lusitanians. 45 More Stanza's had the Siren in the praise Of the illustrious Albulquerque sung; But she remembers one harsh Act, which weighs Him down, though through the world his Fame be rung. “A great Commander (whom to crop bright Bays “On precipitious Cliffs his Fate hath hung) “Should to his Men a Camrade rather be, “Then a Judge made up of Severitie. 46 But in a time of Famine, and hard Toyle, Of Sickness, Arrows, and of thund'ring Ball, Of Season sad, of discommodious soyle, And the poor Soldier patient under All; It seems to me of Savage Breasts the style, Of an inhumane and insulting Gall, To make a Man for such a fault to dye As Love and humane frailty qualifie. 47 Incest's detested Brand it shall not be, Nor boyst'rous Rape upon a Virgin pure, Nor blot injurious of Adulterie, But with a Slave lascivious and obscure. Then whether fir'd with Zeale, or jealousie, Or else to keep his bloody hands in Ure, Against his own he give his rage the reins, With a black Action his white Fame he stains. 48 With his Campaspe Alexander spy'd Apelles took, and upon Him bestows Her cheerfully: being not his Soldier try'd Nor serving at a Siege of desp'rate Foes. That sowr Araspas in the Rays is fride Of his fair Charge Panthea, Cyrus knows; Having profest to be her Guardian true, And that no ill desire should Him subdue. 49 But the illustrious Persian, seeing love Is in the fault ('gainst whom there's no defence) Acquits him streight, and onely doth remove, Where he may serve him well in recompence. The Iron Baldwin (much his Rank above) By stealth Espouses Judith; yet th'offence Her great Sire pardons (needing such a man) And gives them Flanders, whence those Earls began. 50 But her long Song the Nymph continuing, Of Suarez (who his Standard doth display On the red coast of Arabie) did sing: Abasia's hindmost shore, and Barbora (Neighb'ring Zeyla's Emporium) fear the Thing She feels; nor less then Mecha, and Gidda, Filthy Medina quakes, where Mahomet In his Steel-Hamac lies in a cold swet. 51 Also the noble Isle of Tapobrane: For by that name it was as fam'd of yore As by another now 'tis Soveraign Of the hot fragrant Barke, of which 't has store. Of which, she to the Standart Lusiane Shall pay sweet Tribute: when (percht prowdly o're Columbo's highest steeple) that shall be More fear'd by Her, then by her Neighbours, she. 52 Through the Red-Sea Sequeyra a new way To Thee, vast Land of Prester John, shall show; Candace's Nest, and Her's, who, to survay The Wisdome of great Solomon, did go. From Cisterns water'd, He, shall see Macua: Shall see her neighb'ring Port of Archice: And cause new Isles to be discover'd, which With Modern wonders shall the World inrich. 53 Meneses comes the next, whose sword shall serve In Affrick for the wreaths he here shall weare. He prowd Ormooz (That from her faith will swerve) A double Tribute shall constrain to beare. Thou Gama too (who wilt it well deserve Which two exiles) the third time thou com'st there (An Earl, Vice-Roy, and Admiral) the Land, Which thou hast now discover'd, shalt command. 54 But then that rude Necessitie (which none Can scape, who from a humane womb doth spring) Arrests thee in thy Robes, and painted Throne, Where thou shalt out the person of thy King. Streight will another Mennes (old alone In wisdome) have the Sov'raign managing Of the Affairs: (And Happy Henry shall Behind him leave a name perpetual. 55 For he shall quell not onely Malabars, Razing Panane and Coulet's walls, Incountring Cannon, clapping on Petars, And hurling wild-fire in sulphureous Balls; But (arm'd with Vertues past the Sphere of Mars, Quell the Soule's Enemie's sev'n Generals: Quell Avarice, quell foul Incontinence, In a young man the sum of excellence. 56 His Stars now calling Him to tread on Them, Thou, valiant Maskarenias shouldst succeed: But (if usurpt on) know, a Diadem It self, thy brighter honor will not need. Thy courage, Admiration and Esteem (Although not love) ev'n in thy Foes shall breed, If unjust Fortune shall deny the might, Vertue will give the merit, Law the Right. 57 Great Actions in the Kingdom of Bintan Thou shalt perform, Malacca's Foe: her score Of Ills in one day paying, which That ran Into, for many a hundred year before. With patient courage, more then of a man, Dangers, and Toyles, sharp Spikes, Hills always hoare, Spears, Arrows, Trenches, Bulwarks, Fire and Sword, That thou shalt break, and quell, I pass my word. 58 Meane while Ambition, Avarice to boot, In India setting up with open face Against God, and his justice, are a Root Of discontent to thee, but not disgrace. “To trample on weak Right with a prowd Foot, “Presuming on the pow'r, and upper place, “No Conquest is: He conquers with Renown “Who dares be just ev'n though it lose a Crown. 59 Yet I deny not, but Sampayo shall Be of rare Valour for all this; on Seas Shewing himself a thund'ring Generall, Which he shall people with Foes Carcasses. In Bacanore begins he to appall The Malabar, that he may after tease (Prepar'd with that rough Prologue to submit) Bold Cutiale, and his num'rous Fleet. 40 Ev'n that of Dio (so resolv'd and great That his at Choul will give it self for lost) By Hector Of Silveyra shall he beate, And to peccavi turn their furious boast. The Lusitanian Hector: who shall get, Upon the always-arm'd Cambayck Coast, A name, that He doth Guzarats annoy, No less then Greeks the Hector did of Troy. 41 Cunia is fierce Sampoyo's successour. The Ship of State he long doth wisely steer. Of Chale he erects the lofty Tow'r, Whilst famous Dio quakes to be so neer. The strong Bazain shall render to his pow'r, But with much blood; Melique groaning here To see a way o're his prowd Rampire made By the sole dint of Lusitanian Blade. 42 After Him comes Noronia, whose good Star From Dio the fierce Rumes packing sends: Dio, which the through-practis'd Breast in War Of Anthony Silveyra well defends. Death's Writs upon Noronia served are: When a brave Branch of Thine O (Gama!) bends His shoulders to the Government; the fright Of whose great name shall turn the red Sea white. 43 Out of thy Stephen's hand shall take the rain One in Brasile before high fame that wan; The great French Pyrat overcome and slain, Who shall be terrour of that Ocean. Made after Gen'ral of the Indian Main The no less prowd, then fortifide Daman, He enters first: where, having made a breach, 'Tis clos'd with Flames, and Shafts, his way t'impeach. 64 To Him Cambaya's King, prowd above measure, Of wealthy Dio gives the famous Fort; Against the Great Magul, mighty in treasure, To ayd him his Dominions to support. Then doth he in his yet unquencht displeasure, The Pagan King of Calicut take short That would have past him: with no little loss Sending him home again by weeping cross. 65 Destroy shall He the City Repelim Making her King with many quit the place, And after by the Cape of Comorim Perform a deed that shall the Nine disgrace. The Navy Royal of the Samorim, That thinks it may to all the world give chace, With fire and sword he overcomes, and breaks. In Beadala shall his Blade play Rex. 66 India, thus weeded with his Sword of Foes, He comes to rule with Scepter afterward; Finds dangers none, finds none so bold t'oppose. All hush, All tremble like a Lark that's dar'd. Onely Baticala a longing shows To fare as well as Beadala far'd. She's fill'd with blood and Trunks in dead heaps cast: With fire and Ball disfigur'd and defac't. 67 This shall be Martin, or a little Mars, From whom his Deeds he'l take, as well as name: As stout for execution in all wars, As wise to play the fairest of his Game. Castro succeeds; advancing to the stars Of Portugal the Standart and the Fame. Fit successour to Martin: Dio's Fort The one shall raise, the other shall support. 68 Fierce Persians, Abassins, Rumes (who boast Their name from Rome) complexions various, And various Modes (for to this Leaguer post A thousand Nations keen and furious) Heav'n to the world accuse with labour lost, That so few men should nestle in their House. In blood of Portugalls, by their no faith They swear, their turn'd up whiskers they wil bathe. 69 Drakes, horrid Basilisks, Engines of Wood As bad as either, secret Mines and Plots, Hath Mascarenias with his Men withstood, Meeting their certain Deaths with willing Throats: When, in the utmost stress of Flesh and Blood, Castro (their Freer) his two Sons devotes, That everlasting Honour they may gain, And Sacrifices to their God be slain. 70 Fernand (this lofty Cedar's highest Bough, Where with a hideous crack a close Mine sprung Th'unrooted Wall into the Ayre will blow) Shall in a sheet of Fire to Heav'n be flung. Alvar, when Winter swathes the Earth in Snow, And hath on humid Gates cold Padlocks hung; These burst, through dangers to seek dangers goes, And fights the Elements to fight the Foes. 71 Loe, now the Father follows with full sail, And the Remainder of the Lusian force! He with strong Hand and Head of more avail, Gives a brave lucky Battail to the Mores. Where no way is, he makes one with his Flail; And where there is, the Rampires are his dores. Such that day's Feates, so terrible the Blowes, They will not stand in Verse, nor lye in Prose. 72 Then (loe!) he to the great Cambayan King Presents himself a Victor in the Field: Pale Fear into the Face of him doth fling, And of his furious Horse, which ground shall yield. Nor Hydalcan shall from the Conquering Army, with all his might, his Country sheild. Dabul sack'd on the Coast; In land Ponda Scapes not it self, by being out of the way. 73 These, and the like, into all Quarters hurl'd, (All worthy wonder, and Fame's strongest blast) Making themselves brave Marses in the World, The joyes of Venus's Isle shall fitly tast; Trayling triumphant Standarts through the curl'd Amphitheater of the Ocean vast: And they shall find those Nymphs, these furnisht Bards, Which are the Harvest of Victorious Swords. 74 Heer the Nymph ended: And the others All Give their applause with an Harmonious noyse; Congratulating this grand Nuptiall: Where, look how many Hearts, so many joys. Though Fortune Stands Upon A Tott'ring Ball (They all reiterate as with one Voyce) Renowned People You Shall Never Lack, Wealth, Valor, Fame, till the Worlds Henges Crack: 75 When now Corporeall Necessity Suffic'd with noble Nutriment they had; And seen the Acts the Nymph did prophecy In Musicall Poetick Raptures clad: Thetys, adorn'd with grace and gravity, (That she of glory may new quilats add To the high bliss of that triumphant day) Unto the Happy Gama thus did say. 76 The Supreme Wisdome hath vouchsaf'd thee, Knight, The grace to see with thy corporeall Eyes What the vain Science, what the erring Light, Of miserable Man cannot comprize. Thou, with the rest, up this dark Cops forth-right Follow me, strong and constant, stout and wise. This having said, shee hands him through a Wood, Steep, thick with Thorns, and hard to flesh and blood. 77 They marcht not long, when of the arduous Hill They gain the top; where an inameld Flat (In a Field Em'rauld) powdred Rubies fill, Making them think old Paradice was That Heer, in the Ayre a Globe, (by wondrous skill So fram'd with Thorough Lights) they contemplat, That th'unresisted Eye the Center sees, As plainly as the superficies. 78 The matter of it did their Eye-sight pose: That it consisted yet discern'd they well Of Orbs, which the Divine Hand did compose, And in the middle did the Center dwell. Rouling, it sometimes fell, and sometimes rose, And yet it never rose, it never fell: Throughout one Face, throughout its period, Begins throughout. In fine, the Works of God. 79 Infinite, perfect, uniform, self-poiz'd; Brief, like the Architect that made the same. Seeing this admirable Globe, surpriz'd With wonder and desire was our De Game. To whom the Goddess thus; Epitomiz'd I shew thee heer the Universall Frame, That thou maist read, in Print and Volume small, Whether Thou goest, and shalt goe, and Thine shall. 80 The World's great Fabrick thou dost heer descry Heav'nly and Elementall: for just so 'Twas made, by that All-wisdome, that All-eye, Which no beginning knew, no end shall know: Which interweaved in each part doth lye, And round the fair Work like a Border goe: 'Tis God: But what God is, poses Man's wit, Nor can short Line fathome the Infinit. 81 This, which is first, and doth (as in a Nest Of Boxes) all the other Orbs comprize, Darting such radiant Beames, as Mortall Brest Cannot conceive, much less behold Mans Eyes; Is call'd the Empyrean, where the blest Enjoy that good, the World wants similies To cast a shadow of, and which good None Can understand, except it self alone. 82 There is no true, no glorious God, but There: For Saturn, Janus, Juno, Jove, and I, Vain Creatures only, and blind Figments were Betwixt Mans pride, and Mans Idolatry, To stick as Stars in the Poetick Sphere: From whence again w' are borrow'd, by and by, For to distinguish the true Stars in Heav'n, To which Astronomers our Names have giv'n. 83 As likewise because Holy Providence (Which shadow'd is by Jupiter in Verse) Doth by a thousand Ministers dispence His Gifts to the supported Universe, And sacred Prophets oft impart their sence In mystick Parables which they reherse; And tell us Men are favoured by the good, By the ill spirits hurt, unless withstood: 84 Now comes The Poet, who would teaching please, And pleasing teach, and mix variety; And He the self-same Names bestows on These The Heathens did upon their Genii And feigned Gods; for I can shew with Ease, That Angells ev'n in holy Poetry Are called Gods; nor Sacred Writ denyes That ev'n the Ill this glorious Name belyes. 85 In fine Almighty God (who rules the round World, by his Second Causes) He commands. But (to return to open the profound And heav'nly Operations of his Hands) Within this Spheare, where the pure Soules abound In endless Bliss (which sphere unmoved stands) Another runs so swiftly, and so still, 'Tis not perceiv'd: 'Tis the First Movabil. 86 The motion rapt of this First Mobil draws All the rest after, which with it are linkt. The hurried Sun from his own bent and laws Makes Night and day by this Rapt Ore's instinct. The Ninth moves next, so curb'd, with so great pawse, That whilst Sol's lamp (which never is extinct) Ends it's true course about the Zodiake Two hundred times, This but one step doth make. 87 Behold the Eighth goes under That, imbost With Sleek and radiant Bodies! These likewise Besides the motion rapt with which they post. Move on their proper Axe with twinckling Eyes. See with how rich a Belt this Orb is crost! How broad, how glitt'ring with Embroyderies! Where the twelve Starry Animals do make The Sun's twelve Houses in the Zodiake. 88 Behold in other Parts what knots of Gold This Firmament displays! the Dragon there Behold! Charles-Wayn, and Cynosura cold! Andromeda, and her old Sire severe! Cassiopea's sparckling eyes behold! And turbulent Orion, Sea-mens feare! Behold the Swan, which dying is not mute, The Hare, the Dogs, the Ship, and the sweet, Lute. 89 Under this great and spangled Canopy, Loe, in the Sev'nth dull Saturn takes his place! Propitious Jove inthron'd in the Sixt sky: Next (Foe to Man) Mars rides with fiery Face: Plac't in the Middle is the World's Great Eye: The Queen Of Beauty the Third Orb doth grace: Eloquent Hermes rules the Second Sphear: Three-shapt Diana marches in the Rear. 90 In all these Planets motions different Thou maist perceive, some speedy, and some slow: Now climbing nearer to the Firmament, Now stooping closer to the Earth below, As seemed best to the Omnipotent, Who made the Fire and Ayre, the Wind and Snow: Those (clos'd within the Heav'ns) each other enter, And both the Waves, and Earth: the common Center. 91 Upon this Center is the seat of Man: Who, not content in his presumptuous pride T'expose to all Earth's Mischiefs his life's span, Trusts it to the unconstant Ocean wide. Behold the various Parts that Ocean With interfused dangers doth divide! Where various Nations dwell, various Kings raign, Who various Worships, various Laws maintain. 92 See CHRISTIAN EUROPE, higher by the head In Arms and civill Arts then all the rest! See untill'd AFFRICK, covetous, ill-bred, Wanting ev'n things whereof shee is possest, With her great Cape (by you discovered) Which Nature towards the South-Pole addrest: See all this Neck with People infinite Almost, who neither doe nor know what's right! 93 See the great Empire of Monomotape, With naked savage People black and grim; In which the good Gonsalvo shall not scape A cruell death for CHRIST, who dy'd for Him! In this blinde Hemisphere (short of the Cape) The Mettle grows for which pale Mortals swim Through Seas of Sweat, and Blood. See that great Lake From whence, with Quama, Nyle this way doth make! 94 Behold the Negroes Houses, without doores, Whom both the Poverty of their Straw-nests, The Laws, and justice of their King secures, And the black Candor of their Neighbours Brests. Loe, a vast Army of these bruitish Moores, Like a dark Band of Stares (devouring Guests) Against Sofala's batter'd Fort will bend Their strength, which Naya bravely shall defend. 95 See there the very Spring, and Head of Nyle, Which fled (though dearly sought) the Antients eys! See how it laves (spawning the Crocodyle) The Abbasin, who upon CHRIST relyes! See where (a better Fence then Walls) a File Of Hills they man against their Enemies! See Meroe, an Isle of antient Fame: Which now Nova the Natives of it name! 96 In this In-land a Son of Thine great fame Shall win against the proud Circassian; And Don Cristoval shall be that Son's name: But against Fate can stand no mortal man. See, see, that way thy shatter'd Navy came Melinde's dear and hospitable stran! Mark well the Rapto (Natives call't Obe) Which at Quilmance rouls into the Sea. 97 See the Cape call'd of old Aromata, But Guardafu which now the Dwellers call; Where the Red-Sea (so famous) doth Embay, Dy'd with her Bottome's shade! This is the Wall Or running Boundarie, which ASIA Divides from AFFRICK: And the principal Cities, that on the Affrick-side are seen, Are Archicho, Macua, and (chief) Suanquen. 98 See farthest Suez, Heropolys of old, City of Heroes (so do some conceave) Others, that this was the Arsinoe hold: But Egypt's Navies it doth now receave! The very place great Moses past, behold, When with his Rod he did the Waters cleave! ASIA begins. Her self she doth present In limits vast, in Kingdoms opulent. 99 Mount Sinai see, and tremble ev'ry lim, From whence when Moses came his face did shine! See Toro, and Gidda, in wealth that swim, Yet want Spring-water pure and crystalline! See the Streight's other jaw, having for Brim The Realm of dry Aden; which doth confine With Mountains of Arzira, which (they tell) Are all one Rock, whereon Raine never fell. 100 Behold the Three Arabias, so wide-spred, All Tawny-Moors, All Thieves therein that dwell: Whence come the Horses for the Warriour bred, Of noble Race, Fleet, lasting, terrible. Behold the Coast by which thine Eyes are led T'another Gulph (the Persian) there to swell Into a Cape; which by Fartaque's name (Ow'd to the there known City) shuts the same! 111 See famous Dofar, which did ever boast The sweetest smoke to make the Altar steam. Mark here (where Rosolgat your eye hath lost And barren shores) begins Armuza's Ream! It lyes extended all on the Sea-Coast, And shall fit Fame with an immortal Theam, When Turks's fierce Fleet, and blushing Moons dismayd, Shall see unsheathed Casteleranco's Blade. 112 Behold the Cape Of Asabor, they call At present Mosandan who sail that way; At bottom of the Gulph, which hath for wall Rich Persia here, There Blest Arabia! Mark well Barem, an Island bord'red all With Pearls, whose colour mocks the springing day. In the salt waves commanded by her eye The famous Tigris and Eufrates dye: 113 The noble Empire of great Persia see, Always on horse-back, always in the War: Who think it base to have Artillerie, Or Hands not hardned with the Cymetar! But mark the Isle Gerun, what a proof she Is of the pow'r of Time to make, and mar! Of Ormuze City (which was once elsewhere) She now the glory and the name doth beare. 104 Heer Don Phelipe Of Meneses shall Approve himself a glorious Man at Arms, When with a very few of Portugall He shall at Lara quell whole Persian swarms. Likewise shall Sousa on their Quarters fall, Give them bold charges, give them sharp Allarms, And the Reversion of that Sword, whose dint Struck fire before, on raz'd Ampaza's flint. 105 But let us leave the Streight, and Cape well known Of Jasques (call'd Carpella anciently) With all that Land (which Nature doth not own By any Act of Liberality) Whilom Carmania, Habitation Of the old Itiophagues. Now wipe thine Ey, And see fam'd Indus, born in yonder Mountain, Near which flows Ganges from a higher Fountain: 106 See heer, where Nature prodigall hath bin, The Kingdom of Ulcinde; and the long Bay of Jaquete, where the Waves flow in With speed incredible, as fast out-throng! Cambaya see, where this Gulph doth begin, In wealth and people infinite and strong! A thousand Cities here un-nam'd I leave, Which shall the yoake of Portugall receave. 107 See where the celebrated Indian shore Runs Southward to the Cape of Comoree (Call'd in old time Coree) which lyes right ore Against Ceylan (Traprobane anciently) Along this Sea the Lusian (who, with more Forces shall be dispatched after Thee) Lands, Victories, and Cities shall obtain, In which they many Ages shall remain. 108 Behold in various Countreys (plac'd betwixt These Rivers) Nations almost infinite: Some Pagans, some Mahumetans (well mixt) To whom the Devil did their Laws indite! Behold Narsinga's Realm, to which is fixt A holy Relique of a blessed Wight, St Thomas's body, who was not deny'de To thrust his Fingers into Jesus's side! 109 Heer stood the City call'd Meliopore, Beautifull, wealthy, and magnificent; The Idols ancient she did adore As still doe those of her prophane descent: Farr was she seated then from the Sea-shore, Whenas the Gospel through the whole world sent, Thomas came preaching there; and did the same In all the Provinces through which he came. 110 Arrived preaching, and administring Life to the dead, and health unto the sick; The Sea chanc'd hither on a day to bring A floating Tree, unmeasurably thick. For a vast Pyle in hand desires the King To frame a Beame of this prodigious stick; And makes accompt on shore to drag it then, By force of Engines, Elephants, and Men. 111 So heavy 'tis, All these have not the might To stir the Log that on the Water lyes. But the true Christ's true Nuntio hath a slight To doe it without trouble, without noyse. He draws it to him like some Matter light With a small Cord, which to the Trunk he tyes: Wherewith a sumptuous House for God to raise, To stand a pattern for succeeding days. 112 Full well he knew, with lively faith if Hee Should say unto a Mountain deaf, Remove; Ev'n that deaf Mountain would removed bee: As Christ once said, and Thomas now doth prove. This doe the people stand aghast to see, The Bramens know it must be from Above: Seeing his Miracle, seeing his life, These fear the fall of their prerogatife. 113 They are the Heathens Priests, in whom alone Envie the bowels of her Gall hath shed. A thousand plots and Trains they think upon, How Thomas may be silenc'd, or be dead. A horrid Act performs, as ere was known, The Chief of These That wear the Triple-thred: Which proves, “No Foe so bloody, so severe, “As Hypocritick Vertue to sincere. 114 He murthers his own Son, and charges it Forthwith on Thomas who was innocent: False witness brings (There nothing hard to git) Through which, the Man's condemn'd incontinent. The Saint (having no way to be acquit, But by Appeal to the Omnipotent) Resolves, in presence of the King and Court, To work a Miracle of the great sort. 115 He bids the Corps be laid in view of All, That it may rise and be examin'd There Touching the question'd Fact, and whom that shall Accuse, let him be held the murtherer. In name of Jesus crucifi'd, i' th' Hall They see the Youth stand up, record to bear: Who (thanking Thomas for his life) descride His Father to have been the Homicide. 116 This struck such fear, that streight his Christendome The King receives, and many with the King. Some kiss the Hem of Thomas garment, Some The praises of the God of Thomas sing. The Bramens swell with such an odium, Through Envy's now imposthumating sting, That (thereunto perswading the blind Rout) They vow to put so bright a Taper out. 117 One day, as preaching to the same he was, They feign'd a quarrell 'mongst the multitude (For Christ himself hath sign'd him now his Pass To climbe to Heav'n by way of Martyr-hood) A showre of Stones, which God's commission has, Flyes in his Face: who all their Tempest stood. One (whose Bloud-thirstiness could not abide Delay) with cruell Spear did broach his side. 118 Ganges and Indus did Thee, Thomas, weep; Wept thee the Countreys all which thou hadst trod: But, holy Shepherd, wept thee most thy sheep, Whom thou didst deck with Faith, the Cloth of God). Only the Angels holy-day did keep For Thee, whom God did comfort with his Rod: Laughing, and Singing, These thy Soule transport With golden sailes to her celestiall Port. 119 You then, who claim the honor (like this Saint) To be the great Ambassadours of God; (Pray give me leave) why are ye lame, and faint, When with your Errand ye should go abroad? If, y'are the Salt oth'Earth, and at home taint (No Prophet being esteem'd in his Aboad) Who now shall salt (I bayte you Paganism) So much of Heresie, so much of Scism. 120 But tread we light a bog so dangerous, Returning to the Coast from whence we stray'd. With this great City and illustrious, Begins the Gulph Gangetick to be made; Narsinga, next, lies rich and populous; Next Oryxa her cloth of gold doth lade; Fam'd Ganges at the bottom of the Bay To the Salt Realm doth Silver Tribute pay: 121 Ganges, in which his Borderers dye lav'd; Holding it as a certain principle That (be they ne're such Sinners) they are sav'd, Bath'd in those streams that flow from Sacred Well. The City Cathigan would not be wav'd, The fairest of Bengala: who can tell The plenty of this Province? but it's post (Thou seest) is Eastern, turning the South-Coast. 122 The Realm of Arracan, That of Pegu Behold, with Monsters first inhabited! Monsters, which from a strange commixtion grew: Such ill effects oft Solitude hath bred. Here (though a barb'rous misbegotten Crew) Into her way was erring Nature led By an invention rare, which a Queen fram'd, To cure the Sin, that is not to be nam'd. 123 Behold the City of Tavay, with which The spatious Empire of Sian begins! Tenasseri! Queda: with pepper rich For which the praise she from all other wins! Malacca see before, where ye shall pitch Your great Emporium, and your Magazins: The Rendezvouz of all that Ocean round For Merchandizes rich that there abound. 124 From this ('tis said) the Waves impetuous course, Breaking a passage through, from Main to main, Samatra's noble Isle of old did force, Which then a Neck of Land therewith did chain: That this was Chersonese till that divorce, And from the wealthy mines, that there remain, The Epithite of Golden had annext: Some think, it was the Ophyr in the Text. 125 But, at that Point doth Cingapux appeare: Where the pincht Streight leaves Ships no room to play. Heer the Coast, winding to the Northern Beare, Faces the fair Aurora all the way. See Pan, Patane (ancient Realms that were) And long Syan, which These, and more, obay! The copious River of Menam behold, And the great Lake Chiamay from whence 'tis roll'd! 126 In this vast Tract see an Infinitie Of Names and Nations to your World unknown! Laos, in Land and men That potent bee! Avas, Brainas, in those long Hills o'regrown! In yon far Mountains other Nations see (Gueos they're call'd) and savage ev'ry one! They eat Mans flesh, and paint their own in knots With fire, as ye doe Rooms with watring-pots. 127 The River Mecon (which they Captain style Of Waters) see; Camboya on his brink! He overflows the Land for many a mile: So many other Rivers doth he drink. Set times he hath of flowing (like cool Nyle): The near Inhabitants brutishly think, That pain and glory, after this Life's end Ev'n the brute Creatures of each kind attend. 128 Upon his soft and charitable Brim The wet and ship-wrackt Song receive shall Hee Which in a lamentable plight shall swim From sholes and Quicksands of tempestuous Sea, (The dire effect of Exile) when on Him Is executed the unjust Decree: Whose repercussive Lyre shall have the Fate To be renowned more then Fortunate. 129 Heer, (mark it!) runs the Coast that's call'd Champa, Whose Groves smell hot of Calambuco wood: Heer Cauchinchina, and heer Aynam's Bay; Both One and t'Other little understood. Heer the great Empire (famous for large sway, And its vast Wealth's unfathomable Flood) Of China runs: calling all this her Owne From burning Cancer to the frozen Zone. 130 See the stupendious Monster of a Wall 'Twixt this and the Tartarian Empire set: A witness to the World perpetuall Of Regall Pow'r immeasurably great! The King these have, was born no Prince; nor shall Reign after him the Children he shall get: But one chose by the People of Renown For qualities proportion'd to a Crown. 131 Much of the World being now conceal'd from You A time will come when it shall all be show'd. But by all means the Islands thou must view, Where Nature seems most cost to have bestow'd. This, shadow'd half, which China answers to, (By which, at distance flanking it, 'tis Wood) Japan is, yeelding the best Silver-mine: Which th'Evangellick Furnace shall refine. 132 Through all these Orientall Seas behold, Sown infinite of Isles that have no name! Tidore see! Ternate, whence are roll'd (Holding black Night a Torch) thick Plumes of Fame! See Trees of burning Cloves, that shall be sold For Lusians blood, and water'd with the same! Heer are those golden Birds, which to the ground Never descend, and only dead are found. 133 See Banda's Isles, inameld curiously With various Colours which the red fruit paints; With various Birds, from Tree to Tree that fly, To take their tribute of the Nutmeg-Plants! Behold Borneo likewise, in which dry Coagulated Liquor never wants From a fat Tree which Camfora they name, For which this Isle is in the Book of Fame! 134 There (look you!) is Timor, that sends the Wood Call'd Saunders, Physicall and Odorous. See Sunda, painted at half face, so broad That the South-side lies now quite hid from Us! The Natives here (and Those who from abroad Travail the Land) of a miraculous River report; which, where it slides alone, The wood that falls therein, converts to Stone. 135 In that (which Time, I told you, made an Isle; Which likewise trembling flames with smoke expels) Two wonders see, a Fountain that runs Oyle; And Balsamum that from Another wels, Sweeter then that, Adonis Mother vile Weeps in the Blest Arabia where she dwels. And see, how having these (which none else have) Shee with soft silk too, and fine Gold is brave! 136 See in Ceylan a mountain whose proud Head Above the Cloudy Region doth appear! The Natives count it holy for the tread Of a Man's foot which on a Stone is there. In the Maldiva Isles a Plant is bred (Of vertue under-water) which doth bear The Coco-Apple, against working Bane, An Antidote approved Soveraign. 137 Against the Red-Sea's mouth Socotora Fam'd for the bitter Aloes behold! See other Isles of sandie Affrica, Whose Coast too ye shall conquer! Hither roll'd That Lump is, which Divine Panchaya Out-smels: of unknown birth, more rare then Gold. Behold St Lawrence his renowned Isle, Which otherwise they Madagascar stile! 138 Thus hast thou all the Regions of the East, Which by Thee giv'n unto the World is now: Opening a way with an undaunted Brest Through that vast Sea which none before did plough. But it is likewise reason, in the West That of a Lusian too one Action Thou Shouldst understand; who (angry with his King) Atchieves a great and memorable Thing. 139 See there another World, which from the North Extends it self to the opposed Pole, And shall be one day proud to have brought forth The Ore, that imitates the beams of Sol! Your Friend Casteel (as guerdon of her worth) Shall throw the Collar on this ragged Foale: Where various Nations dwell, various Kings raign, Who various worships, various Laws maintain. 140 But Portugall shall have her share there too, Mark't with red wood, and Santacruz call'd than; Descry'd by the first Fleet, she after you Shall send, by Tempest thrown upon that stran. Alongst this Coast (to find out, and to view The end thereof) shall wander Magellan; Who in reality of Fact shall be A Portingall, but not in loyaltie. 141 When he shall thus have past above half way Towards the Pole Antartick from the Line; Men of Gigantick bulk he shall survay, Inhabiting the parts which there adjoin; And (farther on) that Streight, which shall for ay Be honor'd with his name. This leads in fine To a new Sea, and by a new Land brings, Which the South-wind will hide with his cold wings. 142 Thus farr, O Portingals ye are allow'd Your Nation's future Actions to survay, Which through the Sea by you left ope, her prowd And never wearied Ensigns shall display. Now then, since ye have found not to be bow'd Under Herculean labours, is the way To please your Angell-Spouses bright and fair, That knit immortall Garlands for your Hair. 143 Ye may embarque (for Wind and Weather fit, And the Sea courts you) for your Countrey dear. Thus said shee to them; and they forthwith quit The Isle of Love, the Harbour of good chear. Noble Provisions they take out of It; Take their desir'd desirous Nymphs to bear Them company: Whom nothing shall divorce, Whilst in the Heav'ns the Sun shall run his course. 144 Thus went They ploughing the appeased Main With always prosp'rous Gale, and always fair; Till sight long wisht, much long'd for, they obtain Of that dear Earth where first they suck't the Ayr. Sweet Tagus's Mouth they enter once again: Where to their King, and Master (whom they fear And love) for having sent them, the Renown They give; and add new titles to his Crown. 145 No more, my Muse, no more; my Harp's ill strung, Heavy, and out of tune, and my Voyce hoarse: And, not with singing, but to see I've sung To a deaf people and without remorse. Favor (that wont t'inspire the Poet's tongue) Our Countrey yeilds it not, she minds the Purse Too much, exaling from her gilded Mud Nothing but gross and melancholy blood. 146 Nor know I by what fate, or duller Chance, Men have not now that life, and gen'rall gust, Which made them with a cheerfull countenance Themselves into perpetuall Action thrust. You then, O King! whom Heav'n reserv'd t'advance At this time to the Throne to scoure our Rust; Behold (mark else what other Nations doe) The Best of Subjects doe belong to You! 147 Behold how cheerfully, a thousand ways, Like fearlesse Lions and wilde Bulls they run; Expos'd to watch whole Nights, to fast whole days, To fire and sword, the Arrow and the Gun: To torrid Regions, and to frozen Bays, To Moors, and People that adore the Sun; To unknown perils a new World to find; To Whales, to shipwracks, to tempestuous Wind! 148 To doe and suffer All for You prepar'd; And to obey in the remotest Land (Though ne'r so bitter, and though ne'r so hard, Without Reply, or stop) what You command. With You they'll charge the Devill and his Guard Ev'n to the Gates of Hell, did You but stand A meer Spectator by: and never feare But they will make you too Victorious there. 149 Then warm and glad them with your present Rayes, Sweetly majestick, and severely kind: Their shoulders of their heavie Taxes ease: Thus, thus, the path to Honour you shall find. Men of Experience to your Councell raise, If with Experience they have goodness joyn'd: For such have a more certain Rule to tell The How, the When, the Where to do things well. 150 In their respective Places count'nance All; But choose Men rightly qualifi'd thereto. Let Rev'rend Churchmen to their Prayers fall, That God would bless the Government in you; And (for the Nation's sins in generall) To Disciplines and Fastings: for the true Churchmen (exempted from Ambition's heat) Seeks neither to be Rich, nor to be Great. 151 Your Nobles and your Gentry highly prize, For they their boyling blood undaunted spend, Thereby not only Christianitie's, But ev'n your Empire's limits to extend: And He who to a Clyme so distant flyes Your Royall Service duely to attend, O'recomes two Enemies; the Living first, Excessive Toile the second and the worst. 152 Great Sir, let never the astonisht Gall, The English, German, and Italian, Have cause to say, the fainting Portugall Could not advance the Great Work he began. Let your Advisers be experienc'd All, Such as have seen the World, and studied man. For, though in Science much contained bee, In speciall Cases Practice more doth see. 153 Phormian (an elegant Philosophar) You may have read how Hanniball did foole; When, in his presence, of the Art Of War He made a long Discourse by Square and Rule. No, no, the brave Profession Militar Is not learnt, Sir, by Fancy in the Schoole, Dreaming, contemplating, to spelling held; But seeing, sweating, fighting in the Feild. 154 But I, who speak in rude and humble Ryme, Not known nor dreamt of by my Liege at all; Know yet from mouths of little ones sometime The praise of Great Ones doth compleatly fal. I want not honest studies from my Prime; Nor long Experience since to mix withal; I want not Wit (such as in this you see) Three things, which rarely in Conjunction be. 155 An Arm (to serve you) trayn'd in War have I, A Soul (to sing you) to the Muses bent: Onely I want acceptance in your Eye, Who owe to Vertue fair encouragement. If Heav'n afford me, This; and you, some high And brave Exployt; worthy a Monument Of Verse, as my prophetick Thoughts presage By what I see now in your tender Age: 156 Making Mount-Atlas tremble at your sight, More then at that of dire Medusa's Head; Or putting in Ampleusian Fields to flight The Moors in Fez and black Morocco bred; I'l gage my Muse (then in esteem and plight) You in such manner through the World shall spred, That Alexander shall in you respire, Without envying the Meonian Lyre.
