Syth THE TYME ÞAT CRYST IHESU, Thorough hys grace &amp; vertu, Was in þis world bore Of a mayd withowt hore, And þe world crystendom Among mankynd first becom, Many aduentures hath be wrou?t Þat all men knoweth nou?t. Therfore men shull herken blythe, And it vndirstonde right swythe, For they that were borne or wee Fayre aduenturis hadden they; For euere they louyd sothfastenesse, Faith with trewthe and stedfastnesse. Therfore schulde man with gladde chere Lerne goodnesse, vndirstonde, and here: Who myke it hereth and vndirstondeth it By resoun he shulde bee wyse of witte; And y it holde a fayre mastrye, To occupye wisedome and leue folye. For why as of an Erle j shall yow telle, How of hym it beefelle; And of hys stewarde, withoute lesynge, And of the stewarde sone, a fayre yonge thynge, That gentil was and fayre bee-seen, And how he loued a mayden sheen, The Erles doughter, that was so bryghte, And how he spoused that swete wyghte, And how that he reynbroun beegate— All y kanne tell yow that— And how he wente into wildernesse: All y canne tell yow as it ys. A wyseman it vnto vs seyd That it wrote and in ryme it leyd. I woll it not any longer concell, But open the sentence as ye may fele. In Englonde an Erle was wonnynge In Warrewyke Citee, ryght as I fynde: Ryche he was and grete of myght, Erle he was, and a full stronge knyght, Riche of gold and of syluer bothe, Of clothes of gold and vessell, withoute othe, Of stronge castellis and riche Citees: Thorugh all Englond preised he was. In all Englond ne was ther none That durste in wrath ayenste hym goon. Good knyghtis he loued y-wys, And freely he gaue them of hys, Therfore welbelouyd he was, And grettly doubted in euery place. Erle he was of grete price: All that contree tho was hys; Of oxenford and all that contrey He was gouernoure at that day; Of Bokyngham, and of all that shyre, He was klepyd both lord and syre. That Erle Rohaude hyght, Baroun he was of grete myght. A doughter he had of hys wyue, Hyr grete beaute y can not dyscryue: For the fairest men chesen hir y-wys. That y you telle, sothe it is. Of hir beaute yet a litell wighte: With a faire visage louely in sighte, Hir skynne was white of brighte coloure; Bodied wele and of grete valour; Large tresses, and wele bee-comyng, Browes bente and nose well sittyng; The mouthe so wele sittyng ywys, To kisse it ofte it was grete blys; With grey eyen and nekke white, Hir to see it was grete delite. Hir bodye well sette and shaply; By thoo daies ther was noon suche truely. Gentil she was and as demure As girfauk, or fawkon to lure, That oute of muwe were drawe; So faire was noon, in sothe sawe. She was therto curteys and free ywys, And in the .vii. artes well lerned, withoute mys. All the .vii. artis she kouthe well, Noon better that euere man herde tell. Hir maisters were thider come Oute of Tholouse all and some; White and hoore all they were, Bisy they were that mayden to lere; And they hir lerned of astronomye, Of Ars-meotrik, and of geometrye. Of Sophestrie she was also witty, Of Rethoric, and of other clergye; Lerned she was in musyke; Of clergie was hir noon like. She was a woman of grete corage, Wise and faire and of gaye parage. To haue hir to wif he did hir sende Erles, Dukes, fro the worldes ende; And noon of theim haue she wolde, For that she was so faire holde. Felice .la bele hir name is: Moche she was belouid ywis; Of all faire she was the floure, Noon so faire in halle nor boure As she was; who that soughte So faire to fynde, for noughte he wroughte: He that all hir beaute write wolde, To longe tarying make he sholde. Nowe we shull leue of hir here, And telle you forthe of our matiere. Speke we schull of the Stywarde: Well true he was, and highte Sywarde. This Syward was slighe and wise, Riche of kynde, and of grete prise: In his tyme noon better was, For of grete worship was noon in his caas. Of armes he had been chief on grounde, And therof preised in many a londe; For that he wolde preysed bee, He did him bee knowen in many a contree. In Walyngforde he was borne. All that Contree to him was sworne. A swiche noble man he was, On this half the see noon suche was, That serued his lorde so truely, And in all thinges so worshipfully. The Auchinleck MS. has been followed from line 123. Line numbers have been changed to concur with original the MS. His lord he serued treweliche In al þing manschipeliche. þer was non erl in Inglond þat to ?eines him durst stond, Bot, ?if he wold be wiþ him at on, He wald do nimen him anon, &amp; wiþ strengþe him nim wolde, þei he to Scotlond suwe him scholde. His lordis honour he held worþschipliche, &amp; defended it wele &amp; hardiliche; þer nas kni[?]t in Inglonde þat wiþ wretþe durst him atstonde. þei a man bar an hundred pounde, Opon him, of gold y-grounde, þe[r] nas man in al þis londe þat durst him do schame no schonde, þat bireft him worþ of a slo, So gode pais þer was þo. Þilke steward hadde a sone Trewe &amp; wise atte frome; Al folk he dede him loue, For þat noman schuld him schoue; &amp; riche ?iftes ?iuen he wold, For þat he schuld be fre yhold. þerl Rohaud he serued þo, As he schuld his kinde lorde do; þerl him loued swiþe dere, Ouer al oþer þat þer were. Of his coupe serue he him dede, He was preysed to him in euerich stede: Þerl michel him worþschipede, &amp; for his fader loue to him clepede. Gij of Warwike his name was, In court non better beloued þer nas, So he was among gret lordinges, Litel &amp; michel in al þinges. Gentil he was &amp; of michel mi?t, Ouer al oþer feirest bi si?t: Al þai wonderd strongliche, For his feirhed was so miche; So mani godenes in him were, Al him preysed þer y-fere, Of bordis &amp; turnament y-wis, Kni?tes to hauen &amp; holden of pris. Gij a forster fader hadde, þat him lerd &amp; him radde Of wodes &amp; riuer &amp; oþer game: Herhaud of Ardern was his name. He was hende &amp; wele y-tau?t, Gij to lern for?at he nau?t; Michel he couþe of hauk &amp; hounde, Of estriche faucouns of gret mounde. It was opon a Pentecost day yteld, þerl a gret fest held At Warwike in þat cite, þat þan was y-won to be. þider cam men of miche mi?t, Erls &amp; barouns boþe apli?t, Leuedis &amp; maidens of gret mounde, þat in þe lond wer y-founde. Eueriche maiden ches hir loue Of kni?tes þat wer þider y-come, &amp; euerich kni?t his leman Of þat gentil maiden wiman; When þai were fro chirche y-come, þer ali?t mani a noble gome. þerl to þe mete was sett, Gij stode forn him in þat flett, þat was þe steward sone, þerl to serue it was his wone. To him he cleped Gij, &amp; him hete &amp; comandi þat he in to chaumber went, &amp; grete wele þat maiden gent, &amp; þat he schuld þat ich day Serue wele þat feir may. Gij him answerd freliche: ‘Sir, ichil wel bleþeliche.’ In a kirtel of silk he gan him schrede, Into chaumber wel sone he ?ede. Þe kirtel bicom him swiþe wel, To Amenden þer on was neuer a del; Þe maidens biheld him feir &amp; wel, For þat he was so gentil. Gij on his knes sone him sett, &amp; on hir fader half he hir grett, &amp; seyd he was þider sent To serue hir to hir talent. Felice answerd þan to Gij ‘Bieus amis, molt gramerci.’ &amp; seþþe sche asked him in þe plas Whennes he cam, &amp; what he was. ‘Mi fader,’ he seyd, ‘hat Suward, þat is þi fader steward, þat wiþ him me haþ y-held &amp; forþ y-brou?t, God him for-?eld!’ ‘Artow,’ sche seyd, ‘Suward sone, þat of al godenes haþ þe wone?’ Gij stode stille &amp; seyd nou?t. Wiþ þat was the water forþ brou?t: þai sett hem to mete anon, Erl, baroun, sweyn &amp; grom. Gij was bisy þat ich day To serue wele þat feir may. þat day Gij dede his mi?t To serue þritti maidens bri?t; Al an-amourd on him þai were, &amp; loued Gij for his feir chere. þer of no ?af he ri?t nou?t, Al anoþer it was his þou?t: On Felice þat was so bri?t, Gij hir loued wiþ al his mi?t; So michel sche was in his þou?t, þat neye he was to deþ y-brou?t, He gan to wepe &amp; sore siche, &amp; biment him wel reweliche; &amp; grete wonder he hadde y-wis þat Felice so feir a creatour is. Ac he no dar his loue keþe, No sen hir wel vnneþe, He is in so gret þou?t, His conseyl wil he schewe nou?t. Into þe maidens chaumber he is y-go, At Felice he tok his leue þo, &amp; in his way he goþ apli?t. Vnto his chamber he went ful ri?t, &amp; wepe &amp; made grete wo, For he loued þat maiden so. His men axed him on hy, Whi þat he was so sori? He hem answerd sone anon, þat swiche iuel is comen him on þat he weneþ his liif forgon, Bote no tit him neuer non. In þe court biment was Gij; Mani man for him was sori, For he was won to serue hem wel, &amp; ?if hem mani a iuwel. Now is Gij in gret tempest, Sorwe he makeþ wiþ þe mest Of Felice þat feir may; For hir loue he sorweþ ay. &amp; grete wonder he haþ y-wis Þat him so hard bifallen is; He acursed þe time þat [he] hir say, Felice wiþ hir ey?en gray, Hir gray ey?en, hir nebbis schene: ‘For hir mi liif is miche in wene. To hir ichil tellen al mi þou?t, Whi þat icham in sorwe brou?t. Tide me gode oþer qued, Y nil it hele for no nede, Ri?t to hir that y ne go &amp; schewe hir of mi miche wo. Ac now to hir schewen y nille; Allas, wreche, hou may i duelle? For mi lordes douhter sche is, &amp; ich his nori, forsoþe y-wis; Þerfore ich au?t him treweþe bere, &amp; neuer more him to dere. ?if ich hir loued, &amp; it wist he, &amp; he mi?t ouer-take me, He wald anon mine heued of smite, Oþer heye hong, for that wite, Oþer hewe me wiþ swerdes kene, ?if ich hadde don him þat tene. Allas, wreche, what may y do? Y loue þing y no may com to!’ Now is Gij in sorwe ybrou?t; Of his liif nis him nou?t. He went and trent his bed opon, So man þat is wo bigon; He no may sitt no stonde, No vnneþe drawen his onde; Rest, no take slepeinge, Mete ete, no drinke dringe; No may him noman comforti, Bot euer his song is wo &amp; wi. In so gret þou?t was he þo, &amp; so gret sorwe toke him to, Leuer him wer walk &amp; wende, &amp; dye in trewe loue bende. Þus [Gij] lay in grete turment Til þat þe fest was al to-went. Swiche an iuel is on him fast, Þat he no may it of him cast; He no wil noman his care schewe. His sorwes ben euer aliche newe, Þat he no may his loue haue, Grete strengþe him doþ wiþ-drawe. Þer-fore he seyd, ‘ichil hir schewe, My peyne is euer aliche newe; Of al mi sorwe nis hir nou?t, Ich wold ich were to deþ y-brou?t. Bitide me iuel oþer gode, Ichil it held in mi mode; &amp; ?if sche wil, sche may me spille, Ac for al þat leten y nille.’ Now is Gij to court y-go, As man þat is ful of wo, &amp; on his knes he him dede Bifor Felice in þat stede, &amp; to hir he spac wel euen Wiþ a wel queynt steuen, &amp; seyd, ‘Felice þe feir, merci! For godes loue &amp; our leuedi, Þat y þe no finde mi dedliche fo, For godes loue herken me to! No longer hele y nille, Al that soþe tellen y wille. Þou art þe þing þat y most ?erne, Fro þe no may mine hert terne; Opon al oþer y loue þe, Y no may it lete ded to be. Vnder heuen no þing nis, Noiþer gode no qued y-wis, Þat y for þe don y nolde, To lete þat liif don y wolde. Þou art mi liif, mi ded y-wis, Wiþouten þe haue y no blis; Y loue þe and tow nou?t me, Y dye for þe loue of þe. Bot þou haue merci on me, For sorwe ichil me self sle, For wistestow þe heuinisse, Þe sorwe and þe sorinisse, Þat me is on ni?t and day (Bi trewe loue siggen ich it may)— &amp; tow it mi?t wiþ ey?en se, Þou wost haue merci on me.’ Felice þe feir answerd þo, ‘Artow þis, Gij, so mot þou go, Þe steward sone Suward, Ich wene þou art a fole musard! When þou of loue me hast bisau?t, Al to fole-hardy þou art y-tau?t. Wele þou holdest me for a fole; Þou art y-tau?t to a liþer scole, &amp; icham þi lordes douhter biname; Þan dostow him wel michel schame, When þou of loue bi-sechist me Þat y schold þi leman be. No fond y neuer man me so missede, No me so of loue bede, Noyþer kni?t no baroun, Bot þou þat art a garsoun, &amp; art mi man, &amp; man schalt be. Yuel were mi fairhed sett on þe, &amp; y swiche a grome toke, &amp; so mani grete lordinges for-soke. Erls, doukes of þe best In þis world, &amp; þe richest, Me haue desired apli?t, Þat neuer of me hadde si?t. Þat wer gret deshonour to me! Al to loþ mi liif me schuld be. Al to fole-hardi þou were, When þou me of loue bisou?test here.

His fader was for him sori, Sabin his moder biment Gij, Þerl for him sori was, Þer liked non in that plas: Litel &amp; michel, al &amp; some, Biment Gij att[e] frome. Þerl dede þe leches of-sende Of Gyes iuel to wite þat ende. Þe leches ben to him y-go: Gij þai finde blaike and blo; Hij asked him where his iuel stode.

Vnder heuen [n]is so strong þing So is loue and wowing. Now,’ he seyd, ‘what for þan? Þei ich hir loue, blame me noman; To warant ichil drawe atte frome Þat loue doþ me þider come, &amp; þat loue doþ me go to þe Þat y no may wiþ-hold me.’ With þis Gij arisen is, &amp; to þe gate goþ y-wis. ‘God,’ quod Gij, ‘y do foliliche: Y sle me seluen sikerliche; Mine owhen [deþ] y go now secheinde.

For ich would þatow seye Þe sorwe þat y for þe dreye: Þe strong pine &amp; þe wo Y dreye for þe euer-mo.

Henne forward ne reche y me Of mi liif, whare it be, No of mi deþ neuer þe mo No reche y neuer where y go.’ He ferd as he wer mat, Adoun he fel aswoune wiþ þat; Felice stode &amp; loked him to &amp; biheld his strong wo; To a mayde sche seyd þo: ‘Take him vp in þine armes to, &amp; lay him soft on þe grounde’; &amp; sche dede so in þat stounde. Þat mayden ?ede to him wepeinde, &amp; Gij wel sore biminde: ‘Bi god of heuen,’ sche seyd, &amp; ich wer as feir a mayd, &amp; as riche kinges douhter were As ani in þis warld here, &amp; he of mi loue vnder-nome were, As he is of þine in strong manere, &amp; he wald me so o loue ?erne, Me þenke y no my?t it him nou?t werne.’ Felice the feir answerd þo: ‘Damisel,’ sche seyd, ‘whi seistow so? Þou art to blame, al-so y se, No-þing þer-mid no paistow me. Oft þou hast y-herd in speche Þat we no schal no man biseche, Ac men schul biseche wimen In the feirest maner þat þai can, &amp; fond to speden ?if þai may Boþe bi ni?tes and bi day.’ Of his swouning he vpros þo; Þe maiden him tok in armes to. Felice seyd to Gij, ‘þou dost folie, Þatow wilt for mi loue dye; Schal y do mi fader of-sende? I schal him telle word &amp; ende, Þat tow dost me litel worþschipe, When þou me desirest to schenschipe; In his court he schal deme þe, &amp; al to-lime, to queme me.’ Gij answerd anon þer-to, ‘God ?eue þat it wer y-do, Þat of mi deþ þou haddest wite! Of mi liif is me bot lite; Redi ich am it to vnder-fong, Be it wiþ ri?t, be it wiþ wrong.’ Felice hadde of him gret rewþe: ‘Gij,’ quod [sche], ‘þou louest me in trewþe; Al to michel þou art afoild, Now þi blod it is acoild. Ac o thing y grant þe; More no mi?tow asky me: Þer nis leuedi, no maiden non, In þis cuntre so wide so man may gon, &amp; tow louedest hir astow dost me Þat sche no wold grant hir loue to þe.’ Gij seyd to Felice, ‘now lete þis be; Now me þenke þou scornnest me. Nis me nou?t iuel anou? y-di?t, When þou wilt of me no-wi?t? Now a fole ich-il be &amp; mi witt chaunge for þe!’ ‘Gij,’ seyd Felice, ‘now vnder-stond: For now nil y noþing wond; &amp; þei y say þe al mi wille, No hold it for non vn-skille: No grome louen y no may Fort he be kni?t forsoþ to say, Feir &amp; beld to tellen by, S[t]rong in armes &amp; hardi; &amp; when þou hast armes vnder-fong, &amp; ichaue it vnder-stonde, Þan schaltow haue þe loue of me, ?if þow be swiche as y telle þe.’ When Gij herd þat tiding, For ioie his hert gan to spring; At hir he tok leue anon, In-to the castel he gan to gon; Al so swiþe as he it mi?t do, In-to the court he gan to go: Of euerich day him þought ten Fort he seye his lemen. &amp; when he feld him hole &amp; fere, He went to court wiþ glad chere; Michel ioie wiþ him þai made, &amp; alle þai wer bliþe &amp; glade. To þerl þan went Gij, &amp; gret þat kni?t hardi, &amp; seyd, ‘sir, þine armes ich ax; ?if ich am þer to y-wax, Ich am redi hem to fong, &amp; þe to serue wiþ-outen wrong.’ Þerl answerd, &amp; seyd þo, ‘Bleþeliche, Gij, seþþe þou wilt so.’ Þerl dede anon aparaile Gyes dobing wiþ-outen feyle; Wel richelich he dubbed Gij, &amp; wiþ him felawes tventi, Þat al barouns sones were (For Gyes loue he dubbed hem þere), Þat wiþ þerl Rohaud hadde ben long, In his seruise armes to vnder-fong. It was at þe holy trinite, Þerl dubbed sir Gij þe fre, &amp; wiþ him tventi god gomis, Kni?tes and riche baroun sonis. Of cloth of Tars &amp; riche cendel Was he[r] dobbeing euerich a del; Þe panis al of fow &amp; griis, Þe mantels weren of michel priis, Wiþ riche armour &amp; gode stedes, Þe best þat wer in lond at nedis. Alder-best was Gij y-di?t, Þei he wer an emperour sone, apli?t: So richeliche dobbed was he, Nas no swiche in þis cuntre; Wiþ riche stedes wele erninde, Palfreys, coursours wele bereinde. No was þer noiþer sweyn no knaue, Þat ou?t failed þat he schuld haue. Now is sir Gij dobbed to kni?t; Feir he was and michel of mi?t. To Felice went sir Gij, &amp; gret hir wel curteyslie, &amp; seyd, ‘ichaue don astow seydest me to, For þe ichaue suffred miche wo: Arme for þe ichaue vnder-fong, Þe to se me þou?t long.

Þou schalt kepe mi sone Gij, For he is mi sone &amp; tow mi norri. Loke, Herhaud, þat tow him kepe; &amp; þine felawes þat ben ?epe, Boþe Torold &amp; sir Vrri, On ?ou y trust sikerli; &amp; wiþ Herhaud schul ?e go To kepe mi sone from care &amp; wo.’ &amp; hii answerd sone anon, ‘Hastiliche, sir, wil we wiþ him gon.’ Þai weren boþe strong kni?tes, Bold and hardi in ich fi?tes. Gij tok wiþ him what he wold Boþe of siluer &amp; of gold. To þe se þai ben now y-come, &amp; seyled ouer atte frome.

Swiche no mi?t y neuer werþe To be þe best on þis erþe; Into oþer cuntres ichil go, For þi loue to wirche me wo. For dout of deþ nil y nou?t fle: ?if y dye, it is for þe.’ Sir Gij of hir toke his leue, &amp; kist hir wiþ wepeand eye. Unto his in he goþ snelle; Þer nil he no lenger duelle. To þerl he wil gon, &amp; tak his leue sone anon. Gij him com to court þore, &amp; ali?t atte halle dore; &amp; to þerl he went þo, &amp; schewed him wat he wald do. ‘Sir erl,’ quod Gij, ‘y bid þe, Leue to wende ?if þou me. Ouer þe se ichil now wende; God to gode hauen me sende! Time it is þat ich fond To winne priis in vncouþe lond; Al þe glader ?e mow be ?if we of armes preised be. &amp; ?if þou hast folk of grete mi?t, It is te gret worþschip, y pli?t, For al þe more men schal þe dout Wiþ-in þi lond &amp; eke wiþ-out.’ ‘Sir Gij,’ quod þerl þo, ‘Faileþ þe out þat y mai do? Gold oþer siluer, oþer heye stede? To passe þe se hastow no nede. Sir Gij,’ he seyd, ‘lete ben al þis, Anou? þe worþ þat þe nede is; &amp; to pleyn vnder þe linde, Þe hert to chacen and þe hinde: Of al þinges þou schalt haue plente. Bileue at hom, sir Gi, wiþ me. We schul wende boþe y-fere To play bi wode &amp; bi riuer; Al bi times þou mi?t wende; ?ete no hastow ben here a moneþ to þende.’ ‘Miche þank, sir,’ quod Gij þo; ‘For soþe so no may [y] nou?t do.’ His leue he toke wiþ-outen more; Þerl it of-þou?t swiþe sore. He goþ him to his fader þo, Þat for his wending was ful wo: ‘Gon, fader,’ quod he, ‘ich-ille; For noþing leten y nille; ?if me leue, icham al ?are Ouer þe se for to fare, To winne pris and los al-so, So ?ong man schal in ?ouþe do. Long to bileuen in þis cunt[r]e Nis it nou?t worþ for me; For ?ong man þat is mi?ti In his ?ouþe schal fondi, So þat men may him in erþe preyse, And in eld liue in mirþe &amp; ayse. Þer-whiles icham ?ong &amp; li?t, Los ichil winne bi mi mi?t.’ ‘Leue sone,’ he seyd, ‘leue þat þou?t: Bi mi wil schaltow wende nou?t. Þou schalt bileue here wiþ me; Al þe bliþer we wille be.’ ‘Leue sone,’ his moder him sede, ‘Þou do bi þi faders rede: Soiourne wiþ ous to ?er mo, Y rede þe, sone, þat it be so. Anoþer ?er þou mi?t ouer fare. Bot þou bileue, y dye for care, For we ne haue sonis no mo: ?if we þe schul now for-go, Glad no worþ we neuer mo, For sorwe schul ous selue slo.’ Gij answerd wiþ þat speche, ‘Fader, god y þe biteche, &amp; mi leue moder al-so; For hastiliche ichil nov go.’ Gij forþ goþ, &amp; þai bileue þare, Þat for hym hadde miche care. To þe se he is y-come, Gode winde he haþ atte frome. Y-comen he is in-to Normundye, Kni?tschip he schewed on hye. Þennes he went in-to Speyne; Nis turnament non in-to Almeyne, Þat Gij no haþ þer-at y-be, &amp; michel y-preised so is he. Þennes to Lombardye he went; Þer ben þe iustes &amp; þe turnament, Þer he dede him preyse miche, Þe Lombardes him loued inliche; He was large, curteys, &amp; fre: Of miche mi?t so was he. Of an vnsele y may ?ou telle, &amp; ?e wil a stounde duelle: As he cam fram a turnament Þat was biside Bonevent, In þe bodi wounded he was: Þat sore him greued no wonder it nas. Þan bithou?t him þe douk Otoun, Þat vnwrast was, &amp; feloun, Þat he wald ben awreke þat day Of Gij of Warwike, ?if he may; For he him wounded in a turnament, As ichaue herd telle verrament; Þer-fore Gij him was swiþe loþ, &amp; wel depe he swore his oþ Þat he of him awreke wald be Er þan he wende out of þat cuntre. When þe douke Otus y-seye þat cas, Þat Gij so sore wounded was, Þerl Lambard he cleped to him (A kni?t he was stout &amp; grim), &amp; fiftene kni?tes in his compeynie, Þat were strong men and hardie. On a dern stede he dede hem hide, Þer as Gij schuld cum ride; ‘Lordinges,’ þan seyd þe douk Otoun, ‘Under-stond to mi resoun: Mine men ?e beþ &amp; to me swore, Omage ?e schul me þer-fore. Mine hest ?e schul ful-fille, Þat ich ?ou bid, wiþ gode wille. Me to wreken ?e schul go Of a treytour þat is mi fo, Þat is y-comen vp mi lond (Wer he þenkeþ to bring me an hond), Gij of Warwike þat wounded is Wiþ a swerd þurch þe bodi y-wis. On þe halidom ?e schul me sweri: In þe forest of Pleyns þat is so miri, Þer ?e schul ?ou al hide, Þer Gij of Warwike schal cum ride: His bodi oliue ?e schul me bring, And slen his feren eld &amp; ?ing. Y schal him in mi prisoun do; Out no comeþ he neuer mo. Wiþ sorwe and wo he schal þer ende: Þennes no schal he neuer wende.’ ‘Sir,’ þai seyd, ‘we schul go, &amp; al þine hest we schul do.’ Þai dede hem arme swiþe wel Boþe in iren &amp; in stiel; Vnto þe pas þai wenten snelle, &amp; þer þai houed swiþe stille, As Gij schuld cum sone. No wist he nou?t of þat tresone, No of þat sorwe neuer the mo, Þat him was comand to; For al his felawes þat gode were, Al he for-les hem þere; &amp; his owhen liif he hadde for-lore, No hadde goddes help ben bifore, Þurch þe traitours þat were her fon, Þat kept hem þere for to slon. Now comeþ Gij soft rideing Opon a mulet ambling. His wounde him greueþ swiþe sore, &amp; smert him euer þe lenger þe more. In pais he wende for to wende, Ac þe traitours Lombardes vnhende, Þe helmes þai seyen bri?t schine, Þe stedes nyen, and togider whine. ‘God,’ quod Gij, ‘we ben y-nome! Al we be ded þurch tresone.’ Sir Gij of þat mulet ali?t, &amp; asked his stede, his armes bri?t, &amp; seyd to his felawes snelle, ‘Dere we schul our deþ selle. Our deþ is now al bispeke, Bot we ous manliche awreke; Ich kepe him selue, seþþe it so is, &amp; ichil, while y liue, y-wis: So dere so y may, ich wille To þe treytours mi liif selle.’ ‘Sir,’ seyd Herhaud þo, ‘For godes loue hennes þou go. For þine loue we schul her dye, &amp; defende þis pas, y seye: Leuer ous were her-on be ded, Þan þou wer ded in our ferred.’ Þan answerd Gij anon ri?t, As gode kni?t &amp; ful of mi?t: ‘?if ?e dye, ichil al-so; Nil ich neuer fram ?ou go!’ Wiþ þat come a Lombard ride, A modi man &amp; ful of pride. ‘Gij,’ quod he, ‘?eld þe anon! ?e ben ded now euerichon; To þe douke we han trewþe pli?t To bring him þi bodi þis ni?t.’ With þat ich word wel smert Gij him smot vn-to þe hert; No spard he for no drede, Þat ded he feld him in þe mede. ‘Bi þe trewþe y schal mi leman ?eld, To day no schaltow þi trewþe held!’ Anoþer Lombard he smot anon, Þurch þe bodi þe swerd gan gon: ‘No þou, treytour, no schalt me lede To þe douke that is ful of qued; To his presoun no worþ y for þe brou?t.’ Herhaud smot anoþer and spared nou?t Þurch þe bodi his swerd glod, Ded he fel wiþ-outen abod. Þan com Torald, a gode kni?t, Swiþe gode &amp; hardi in fi?t; Wiþ a Lombard þer he mett, &amp; so wele his strok he sett Þat his heued fram þe bodi flei; He ?ede him laweliche neye. Wiþ þat come Urri prikeinde (A better kni?t no mi?t man finde) A Lombard he smot þo, Þat þurch his bodi þe swerd gan go; So he smot him, for soþ to say, Þat ded he feld him in þe way. Seþþe he seyd, ‘þurch no toun Schal ?e ous lede to no prisoun. Than mi?t men se fi?t aginne, Heuedes cleue vnto þe chinne. Euerich þat day þat Gij oftoke, Sone anon his liif forsoke. Sum he smot opon þe hode, At þe girdel þe swerd astode; And sum he smot þurch þe side, Þat mi?t he neuer go no ride. Was þer non that mi?t astond Dint þat come of Gyes hond. So mi?ti strokes þer wer ?iuen, Þat strong schaftes al to-driuen; No was þer non in þat ferrede Þat of his liif him mi?t adrede. Wiþ þat come ride þerl Lambard, A sterne kni?t and a Lombard; Vrri anon he slou? þar, It oþou?t Gij þo he was war; Wiþ þerl Lambard he wald iusti, &amp; awreke þe gode Vrri. Wiþ swiche hete he smot him to, His armour no was him worþ a slo; Þurch out his hert þe launce he bar, Adoun he feld him ded ri?t þar. Wiþ þat him come forþ Hougoun, Þat was þe doukes neve Otoun: A kni?t he was of gret mi?t, Swiþe gode &amp; hardi in fi?t. Torald he haþ aqueld; Herhaud anon þat biheld. When Herhaud y-seye þis, Þat he doun fel &amp; ded he is, For his deþ he was sori: Him to awreke he haþ gret hy. Neuer ?ete so sori he no was, To-ward Hugoun he made a ras, Als a lyoun he heyed him fast, Þat his prey wold haue on hast. Þurch þe body he him smot Wiþ gret strengþe, god ytot, Þat biforn þe Lombardes alle Of his hors ded he gan falle. When dan Gauter þat y-seye, To Herhaud he stert wel an heye, And wiþ his swerd he smot him so Þat his hauberk rent ato; Þurch his bodi þat swerd ?ede, Al þai wende þat he wer ded. When Gij seye Herhaud y-feld, To-hewen his hauberk &amp; his scheld (&amp; of his hors feld he was, As ded man lay on þe gras; He seye þe blod þat cam him fro), Wonder him þou?t, &amp; seyd þo: ‘Þou lording, to þe y sigge, His deþ þou schalt wel sore abigge! So mot ich euer word speke, Mi maisters deþ ichil awreke, &amp; for a couward ich held þe: Þou slou? him, &amp; lete me be. Bi him þat made sonne &amp; mone, Þou schalt it wite swiþe sone, Þat tow schalt it bi?elp nou?t Þat he is to deþ y-brou?t.’ Gij wiþ spors smot þe stede, As a man þat hadde nede, Þat fire vnder þe fet aros; Nas þer non þat him agros. Wiþ al his mi?t he smot him to, Wel euen he clef his scheld þo, Þurch his bodi þe swerd he þriste: Þo at arst fi?t him liste. In þe sond he feld him doun, &amp; bede him Cristes malisoun, For þat he wald Herhaud slen, And lete him oliues ben. Now is Gij wel hard bifalle, Y-lorn he haþ his felawes alle; So sori he is, he not what to do, He no haþ no wi?t to bimen him to. Bot þre Lombard[es] oliue þer nere, Opon Gij hastiliche þai were; Þe tvay ben hole &amp; sounde, Þe þridde hadde þurch þe bodi a wounde. Gij þat on wiþ his swerd rau?t, His heued of fleye wiþ þat drau?t. Þan com prikeing dan Gwissard, A duhtti kni?t and no couward. ‘Gij,’ quod he, ‘?eld now þe! It no may no noþer be: On þe erþe liþe þi scheld to-dreued, Nou?t o pece is wiþ oþer bileued, &amp; þine helme is al to-hewe, Þine hauberk to-rent þat was newe; &amp; wounded þou art, þou mi?t well se, Long mi?t tow nou?t oliues be. To day ichil ?eld þe to þe douk Otoun, &amp; he þe schal do in his prisoun. Þan seyd Gij, ‘Gwichard, y nille: To ?eld me to þe is nou?t mi wille, Þer-whiles ichaue mi swerd y-grounde, &amp; mi bodi wiþouten wounde.’ Gwichard smot Gij wiþ michel mi?t Opon þe helme þat schon so bri?t, Þat a quarter out fleye; Þe kni?t was boþe queynt &amp; sleye. Opon his scholder þat swerd glod, Of his hauberk it tok a pece brod; God saued Gij þat he nas ded, No for þat dint hadde no qued. When Gij seye him so smite, He was wroþ, ?e may wele wite; Gwichard he wald fond to smite Wiþ his swerd þat wold wele bite; To him he smot swiþe smert Þurch þe bodi ful ney þe hert: Þat gode swerd þurchim þrang, Gwichard wald abide nou?t lang; He turned his stede &amp; gan to fle, &amp; Gij after him, bi mi leute. Gode was þe hors þat Gwichard rod on, &amp; so fast his stede gan gon, Þat Gij mi?t him nou?t atake, Þer-fore he gan sorwe make. Gwichard fleye in his way Toward Paui, so swiþe he may. Þe douk Otous fram hunting com, &amp; with him erles mani on; A kni?t he seye cum prikeing, His armes to-rent, his woundes bledeing. Þe douk Otous duelled aþrowe, What he hadde Gwichard y-knowe: Wele he semed man aferd, Þat hard tiding hadde y-herd. Wiþ þat is Gwichard to him come; Þe douke him oxed atte frome, ‘Gwichard, who haþ wretþed þe, &amp; where hastow in bateyle be? Where is Gij? is he nome? Liues or deþ[es] do him come.’ ‘Ichil ?ou sigge sikerly So michel so y wot of Gij: At a ford we him mett, &amp; strongliche we him bisett, Bot his bodi no nom we nou?t, Ac al to deþ we ben y-brou?t; Bot icham passed as ?e may se.’ ‘Mi nevou Hougoun, whar is he?’ Quod þe douk Otous, ‘tel me raþe.’ ‘Sir, in þe sond he liþe, &amp; þat is scaþe.’ ‘&amp; þerl Lambard, þat gode kni?t?’. ‘Ded he liþe in þat fi?t.’ When douk Otus herd þat, Sori he was &amp; no-þing glad: Þat he haþ his folk for-lore, Sorweful man he was þerfore. Ney?e his hert brast for mode, &amp; for sorwe ?ede ner wode, When he wist his folk y-slawe, &amp; þurch him brou?t o liue dawe. Now haþ Gij miche sorwe made, For his felawes he is vnglade. ‘Allas,’ quod Gii, ‘felawes dere! So wele doand kni?tes ?e were. Al to iuel it fel to me, Felice, þo y was sent to serue þe; For þi loue, Felice, the feir may, Þe flour of kni?tes is sleyn þis day. Ac for þou art a wiman, Y no can nou?t blame þe for þan; For þe last no worþ y nou?t Þat wimen han to gronde y-brou?t. Ac alle oþer may bi me, ?if þai wil, y-warned be. Allas, Herhaud, mi dere frende, What þou were curteys &amp; hende! Who schal me now help in fi?t? Neuer no was no better kni?t. In ich fi?t wele halp thou me, Ful iuel ichaue y-?olden it þe; For me þou hast þi liif forgon, Of þe no tit me neuer help non. How mai ich now fram þe wende? That y no mai dye þe hende! Acursed be þe Lombardes ichon, That slowen þe, and lete me gon! &amp; þat þai hadde y-slawe me, &amp; leten þe oliue be! Wharto lete þai me alon?’ Þus sir Gij biment his mone. ‘Allas! allas! Rohaut, mi lord, Þat y no hadde leued þi word! Þan hadde y nou?t y-passed þe se, Ich hadde bileued at hom wiþ þe; Þus yuel nere me nou?t bifalle, Y no hadde nou?t lorn min felawes alle. Who so nil nou?t do bi his faders red, Oft-siþes it falleþ him qued; For often ichaue herd it say, &amp; y me self it sigge may, “Who þat nil nou?t leue his fader, He schel leue his steffader.”’ What for his woundes þat strong bledeþ, What for his sorwe þat he ledeþ, Al for sorwe &amp; for wo Adoun he fel aswon þo. When he of swoning vp stod, His feren he biheld wiþ drery mod; Þan he lepe opon his stede, To an ermitage he wold ride. ‘Ermite,’ quod he, ‘com wiþ me; Þis hors of priis ?iue y þe; To bodis þou schalt in erþe graue, Þat in þis forest ben y-slawe.’ ‘Bleþeliche, sir,’ þan seyd he; ‘Wende bifore, y folwe þe.’ Þe bodis him scheweþ sir Gij, Boþe Toraud &amp; sir Urry. Seþþe he lepe opon his stede, Herhaud he wil wiþ him lede; &amp; so he dede sikerliche, &amp; seþþe he was heled softliche, Ac no for þan Gij wend wele þere Þat Herhaud to deþ y-wounded were. Now is Gij þennes y-fare; For his felawes he haþ gret care. Herhaudes bodi wiþ him he bar, For he nold it nou?t lete þar. He went him to an abbay Þat was bisiden on the way. Wiþ þe gode abbot þer he mett, &amp; pitouseliche he him gret: ‘Sir abbot, he þe haue &amp; weld, Þat made man wex in-to eld! &amp; for þe loue of þe trinite, Ich þe bidde, par charite, Þat þou þis bodi vnder-fo, &amp; feir biry þou it do. Ful wele y schal ?eld it þe, &amp; y mot haue hele, &amp; liues be.’ ‘Who artow?’ seyd þe abbot, ‘telle it me.’ ‘Bleþeliche,’ seyd Gij, ‘bi mi leute: A kni?t icham of fer cuntre; At a pas asailed wer we Wiþ strong þeues &amp; mani outlawe, Þat mine feren haue y-slawe; &amp; ich me-self am iuel y-wounde, Y wene y liue no stounde; Ac ?if y liue, y ?eld it þe, Þe trauail þat tow dost for me.’ Þabbot answerd þo: ‘Al þi wille it schal be do.’ Now goþ Gij sore desmaid, His woundes him han iuel afreyd. To an ermite he is y-go, Þat he was ere aqueynted to; His woundes þer hele he dede Wiþouten noise in that stede. Miche he him dradde þe douk Otoun, So ful he was of tresoun. Þabot of whom ich er of teld, On Herhaud he hadde gret rewþe to biheld; He dede beren his body Into a chamber to vnarmy. A monk of þe house biheld him, Bodi &amp; heued &amp; ich a lim. Þilke monk sorgien was, Þe vertu he knewe of mani a gras; Þe wounde he biheld stedefastliche, Þat in his body was so griseliche. Bi the wounde he seye y-wis Þat to þe deþ wounded he nis, &amp; seye þat he hym hele mi?t; &amp; so he dede ful wele, y pli?t. Bi þe moneþ ende at eue Gij was al hole &amp; toke his leue From þe gode ermite, he went his way Toward Poile, also þe way lay. To þe king he is icome Þat him bede mani warisone, &amp; miche tresour of siluer &amp; of gold; Ac Gij þerof non haue no wold. At ich plas &amp; turnament Gij hadde þe priis verrament. Was þer non in al þat lond, Þat his dent mi?t astond. Þer-fore men loued him swiþe miche, &amp; vnder-fenge him bleþeliche; Alle gode men he was leue &amp; dere, &amp; wiþ hem alle pleye-fere. Atte king he toke leue þo; Into Sessoyne he is ygo. Now he is comen to þe douk Reyner, Þat him loued and held dere; He him vnder-feng wiþ worþschipe, &amp; dede him miche manschipe. So long in þat cuntre bileued he is, Þat ouer alle oþer he is praised y-wis. Gij him biþou?t þo Þat he hadde þer y-nou? ydo: Into Inglond he wald wende, For to speke wiþ his frende; For it was ago fif ?er Þat he was last þer; In lasse while þan þat was Might falle mani wonder cas. Þurch cuntres has he hadde y-went, Quens and cuntas him haþ of-sent, Ac non of hem he nold sikerliche Bot Felice þat he loued so miche. What for his mi?t and his godenisse, For his nortour and his largesse, Þer nis kni?t þat so miche preysed be Unto Antiage, þat riche cite. Gij him spedde ni?t &amp; day; Into Inglond he toke þe way. Of Gij ichil lete now, And more after y schal tel ?ou; Of Herhaud ichil telle astounde Þat wele is heled of his wounde. When he feld him hole &amp; fere, Of þabot he tok his leue þer; His lord Gij he goþ secheing Ni?t &amp; day, him for to finde: Toward Inglond he tok his way, Crist him saue, so wele he may! At a pinacle bi þe se Gij seye a man of rewly ble Go in pilgrims wede: Þat was Herhaud, so god me spede! Gij him cleped wel swiþe to him, &amp; seyd, ‘wen comestow, pilgrim?’ ‘Sir,’ he seyd, ‘y com fram Lombardy, Of hard y-schaped for þe maistrie; &amp; lorn ichaue mi kinde lord: Gode kni?t he was and bold. Bitraid ous hadde þe douk Otoun: Haue he Cristes malisoun! In þis wise ichil go, &amp; bid for mi lord euer mo.’ ‘Pilgrim, say me trewelich, What hete þe man þou loued so miche?’ ‘Gij of Warwike was his name: A kni?t he was wiþ-outen blame.’ Wiþ þat he gan to sike sore, &amp; wepe wiþ his ey?en þerfore; He him mi?t no lenge at-held. Gij him gan reweliche biheld: ‘Gode man,’ quod Gij, ‘for þi leute, What is þi name? telle thou me.’ ‘Herhaud of Ardern, bi mi leute, Ich was y-born in þat cuntre; Fif ?er þus ichaue y-go To seche Gij y loued so.’ When Gij herd Herhaud speke, Him thou?t his hert wald to-breke, &amp; in his armes he haþ him take, &amp; gret ioie wiþ him gan make; Him he kist wel mani siþe: For ioie he wepe, so was he bliþe. ‘Hayl, Herhaud, maister min! No knowestow nou?t norri þine?’ ‘Certes,’ quod Herhaud, ‘sir, nay: Ded he was for mani a day.’ He him answerd, ‘icham Gij!’ ‘Sir,’ quod Herhaud, ‘merci!’ Sone so Herhaud vnder-stode Þat it was Gij þat was so gode, For ioie he fel aswon anon; Gij him in his armes nome. Þer men mi?t se ioie make Aiþer kni?t for oþer sake; Þer nas non þat it y-seye, Þat he no wepe wiþ his ey?e. Adoun þai sett hem boþe þare, &amp; aiþer teld of oþeres care. Sir Gij haþ Herhaud y-teld Hou he him ladde out of þe feld, For to birry him at on abbay Þat was bisiden on þe way. &amp; seþþen haþ Herhaud y-teld Hou his woundes weren y-heled, And þat mani lond he hadde ouergo, To seche his lord wiþ sorwe &amp; wo. On hors þai lopen anon wiþ þis Vnto a cite wiþ ioie and blis; Þan dede Gij Herhaud baþey &amp; wiþ riche metes comforti. From þennes þai went to þe douk Miloun, And to him þai ben ful welcome; Of her auentours þai teld him þere: Hou þo was gode þat wicke was ere! Þer þai maden her dueling Long anou? to her likeing. At the douke þai token leue þo, For in-to Inglond þai wald go. Þe douke hem wald lenger duelle, Ac it nas no-thing in her wille Þer to bileue wiþ him no more, &amp; þat biþou?t þe douke wel sore. Toward Seynt Omer he is y-go, Herhaud þe gode wiþ him also; Toward þe se þai token her way, So swiþe her hors hem bere may. When þai ben to toun y-come, Her in þai han sone y-nome. To a windowe sir Gij is go, In-to þe strete he loked þo; A palmer he se?e cominge, Messaisliche bi þe strete walkinge. To him haþ y-cleped sir Gij, &amp; curteysliche gan him axi, ‘Weltow herberwe? for it is ni?t; For ferþer go þou no mi?t.’ Þe pilgrim answerd Gij, ‘Swete sir, gramerci!’ Gij doþ him þan bileue, Ferþer he no may, for it was eue; &amp; seþþe he badde he schuld him say Sum soþ tidinges of þe way, ?if he herd neye oþer fer Speken of batayle &amp; of wer. ‘Ichil þe telle,’ he seyd, ‘fot hot Of al þe wer þat y wot: Þerof is mani man aferd; Of stronger sorwe no haue ?e herd.’ Gij seyd to him, ‘telle it me.’ ‘For soþe y graunt,’ þan seyd he. Of Almaine þe riche emperour, Reyner, þat weldeþ þat anour, Þe douke of Lowayn he haþ bisett, His men slain, &amp; þat is vnnett; For his nevou þat he slou?, Wiþ wer he doþ him wo anou?. Almost a ?er it is ago, A turnament þer was y-do; Þe douke Segyn was þer þo, Þat al Lowayn bilongeþ to, Wiþ his kni?tes of his lond, Þider come her mi?t to fond. When þe turnament com to þende, Þe douke Segyn þennes wald wende: Wiþ þat come Sadok prikeing, Þe douke Segyn vnder-secheing; Wiþ þe douke he hadde gret envie, For he was gode kni?t for þe maistrie. Sadok was y-hoten þat gome, Out of Mirabel he was y-come; Of turnamens he was praised þo. His hauberk was of y-do; In sengle armes he was y-di?t. Y-preysed he was for a gode kni?t. To þe douke he seyd, ‘wende tow þe; Ones þou schalt justi wiþ me, As kni?t that wele alosed is; Sone it worþ sen y-wis.’ ‘Sadok,’ seyd Segyn, ‘lete me be, Wiþ gode loue y pray þe; Wiþ þe to justi haue y no wille, For y þe loue, and þat is skille, &amp; to eken þat þou art mi lordes nevou: His soster sone so artow; Unworþschip it wer to me ?if y schuld iusti wiþ þe.

Now ichil þe for a couward held, &amp; for a kni?t vnwrast in feld: Bot þou wilt wiþ me justi, Ichil þe don a vilani. Hennes forward war þe fro me, Þi dedliche fo ichil now be!’ Now Sadok smot to Segyn, &amp; nothing he no spared him; Sadok toforn haþ him smete Of his scheld a quarter wiþ gret hete, Þat he him wounded þurch þat arm, &amp; he him wreþed for that harm; So strong is þat strok y-?iue, Þat his helme is al to-driue. Þe douke him wreþþed for þat smite, &amp; was ful wroþ, ?e mow wele wite, &amp; þurch þe bodi he Sadok smot, Þat ded he fel doun fot hot. Wiþ þat he is out of the place y-went, For þer was ?iuen a sorwe-ful dent. With him he dede þat bodi lede Unto an abbay, and biri it dede. Þe douke Segin anon ri?t Into the cite of Arrascoun him haþ y-di?t: Þer-in he holt him soiourninge For drede of þemperours cominge. &amp; when þemperour herd þis cas, Þat his nevou y-slawe was, Ouer al his lond his hest he bede To com to him for grete nede. &amp; when þai al icomen beþ, Þe douke of Lowayn he sege deþ; No wil he neuer þennes come, Er the douke be ded or nome.’ When þe pilgrim hadde al y-teld, Gij him herkened &amp; biheld; He stont &amp; biþou?t him ?erne, Wheþer he forþ go oþer o?ain terne. He seyd to Herhaud, ‘what rede [?e]? Sum gode conseyl ?if þou me, ?if we forþ in our wai go, Oþer to þe douke him socour to do. Þat tow me redest, don y wille; Þi conseyl forsake y nille.’ Þan seyd Herhaud i-wis, ‘Y ?if conseyl, &amp; gode it is; Hem to help men schul spede Þat to help han gret nede. For los and priis þou mi?t þer winne, &amp; manschip to þe &amp; al þi kinne.’ ‘Sir Herhaud,’ quod Gij þe gode, ‘Þilke lord þat died on rode Þe blisse, &amp; saue þe, For gode conseyl ?if[es]tow me.’ Gij him graiþed &amp; made him ?are Into Loweyne for to fare; &amp; wiþ him oþer fifti kni?t, In feld þe best þat mi?t fi?t. Y-comen þai ben to Arascoun, To þe douke þai ben wel-com. In þe cite þai han her in y-take; Mani wer bliþe for her sake. Gij bi þe morwe aros þo, Ri?t to chirche he is y-go: Matins &amp; masse he herd þere, &amp; seþþe went hom wiþ his fere. Bi þe strete he seye miche folk erne, Hemself to were þai most lerne. Sir Gij to his ost sede, ‘What is al þis? so god þe rede, Bele ost, y bidde, say þou me, What may al þis erning be?’ ‘Sir, ichil þe telle,’ þan seyd he, ‘No word nil ich ly?e þe; It is þemperours steward, A gode kni?t and no coward (Anon to Speyne his better nis), &amp; with him gret compeynie y-wis, An hundred kni?tes gode of ker, Her better no may wepen ber. Þe cite þai han bisett: ?if ani kni?t be out y-mett, He no mai nou?t passe vn-y-nome, Oþer y-slayn atte frome.’ Þan seyd Gij, ‘lordinges, kni?t, O?ains hem we wil ous di?t.’ Sone þai ben in þe way y-don. Þe steward seþ hem anon: Þider-ward he him di?t, Also a kni?t of gret mi?t. His armes þan he ginneþ ri?t, O?aines Gij he ritt apli?t; Anon to-gider þai gun smite, Aiþer spard oþer bot lite. Gij þe steward so hard smot, Of his stede he feld him fot hot; Þan he smot him wiþ his swerd broun A quarter of his helme adoun. Þurch grete strengþe he him wan, &amp; hom wiþ him ladde him þan. When þe Almaines þat y-seye Þat strong wer, and of fi?t sleye, Her lord nomen in þat fi?t, Owai þai priked wiþ al her mi?t. Þer was þirled mani a scheld, Mani a kni?t lay in þe feld; Gij is o?ain went wel sone, &amp; al his feren mid-y-done. Þe Lombardes þai leggen fast opon, Nil þai spare neuer on. When þe kni?tes of þat cite Þis dede alle y-sey?en he, To army he[m] wel fast hy goþ, Gij wel gode socour hij doþ; &amp; seþþen þai went forþ ari?t, &amp; Gij socourd ful wele apli?t. Swiche strokes men mi?t þer se Togider smiten þo kni?tes fre: Boþe wiþ launce and wiþ swerd Thai ?iuen mani strokes herd.

Þan sir Gij anon ri?t Into þe cite he him di?t, Boþe he &amp; his ferred: Þe prisouns wiþ hem þai lede. Into þe cite þai ben y-gon, &amp; to her innes þai wenten ichon. Proude þai ben alle &amp; some Þat þe Almains ben ouer-come, When þe douke yherd þis tidinge, For blis his hert bigan to springe, Þat Gii of Warwike was y-come &amp; hadde þe steward y-nome. On his stede he lepe anon, To Gyes in he is y-gon; ‘Gij,’ he seyd, ‘þou art welcome, As of the warld þe best gome. Toforn al oþer ichaue desired þe: God y-thanked mot he be Þat tow art come wiþ me to ben at nede, For now ich worþ þe more loued &amp; drede Al of mi dedelich fo, Þat al þis lond haþ brou?t in wo.

Bi mi mi?t ichil help þe On ich stede where þat y be.’ Þe steward he ?elt him þan swiþe, Of whom þat he was glad &amp; bliþe; Þurch him he wende acorded be Of þemperour, his lord so fre. Bitvene hem þai tolden tale Of her gode frendes fale. Now sent Gij his sondes about, ?epe men wiþ-outen dout, To cuntres þat he haþ þurch-went. Grete frendes he haþ of-sent, Of barouns and of kni?tes beld Þe best þat mi?t wepen weld, Bi hundred and bi þousinde, Þat al wil ben his helpinde.

When þemperour yherd þis, Þat Gij to þe douke ycomen is, &amp; þat he haþ his men ouercome, Y-slawe &amp; his steward nome, Wroþ &amp; sori he is þer-fore, Þat he haþ so his men forlore. To his barouns þan he sede: ‘Lordinges, what schal me to rede? Neuer no worþ ich glad no bliþe, Bot ich be awreken swiþe Of Segyn &amp; Gij þat is our fo, Þat mi folk haþ brou?t in wo.’ ‘Sir,’ the douk Paui sede, ‘Ther-of þarf þe haue no drede.

Who so to me bring hem to, Mi loue he schal haue for euer mo.’ ‘Sir,’ þai seyd, ‘we willen go Al þine hest for to do.’ Now hij han her way y-nome, To Arascoun þat ben y-come. When þai of þe cite wist hem þare, O?aines hem þai di?t hem ?are; Hastiliche to armes þai ben y-go, Kni?tes and squiers wiþ hem also. When þai wer al redi, &amp; wele y-di?t in her parti, Þe douke cleped Herhaud him to, &amp; swetely seyd to him þo: ‘Sir Herhaud, þou schalt afong Four hundred kni?tes wi?t and strong (Þou schalt ?if þe first asaut Opon þe Almaundes, sir Herhaud); &amp; þou, sir Gij, an hundred to þe Of mi londe þat best be; And ?if þat Herhaud haue nede, Him to help þatow spede, &amp; ichil com wiþouten delay Wiþ al þe strengþe þat y may. Togider wiþ hem we schul fi?t, &amp; hem ouer-com þurch godes mi?t. As ichaue seyd, loke ye don, &amp; goþ and asaileþ hem anon.’ Herhaud ginneþ hem to asaily. Þat fi?t he wil comenci. Of þe douk Otus Herhaud is vnder-nome In þe alder first scheltrome; His fo he is euen forþ his mi?t, For he it haþ deserued þurch ri?t. Herhaud him seyd, ‘Otus of Pauie, Understond tow of þat felonie Þat tow in Lombardi ous dedest, When þou mi lord betreydest. Wele we schul þer-of awreke be, ?if god wil, er þe sonne doun te.’ Otus answerd, ‘þou lexst on me, &amp; þat y schal sone kiþe þe; Gret scorn is here so y go, Y warn þe icham þi fo.’ Togider þai smiten wiþ gode wille, Þat boþe of her hors adoun felle; &amp; after þai drou? her swerdes newe, Wiþ gret envie to-gider þai hewe. Þe douk him wereþ mi?tliche, Herhaud him asaileþ strongliche; Þurch þe feld he goþ him driueinde. Wiþ þat com his folk prikeinde, &amp; her lord rescuweþ þere; The Caius MS has been followed from lines 2032–2207, owing to missing leaves in the Auchinleck MS. And heraude to take they angry were: Bot heraude vpon him werred strongly. With that cometh his folke hastely: With strength they bee forthe goo, And heraude they broughte on hors thoo. Than gan they to-geder smyte: Noon spared other bot a lite. The duke Otes had sorowe gretly, Whan he sawe his folke sleyn so greuously, And seide to his felawes thoo: ‘Lordinges, what shall we nowe doo? See ye not here a man, by name, That me dooth harme and moche shame, That hath nyghe sleyne all my men, Youre frendes and your kynnesmen? Bot ye on him some wreke doo, I shall you neuere loue moo.’ With that they assembled echoon, And to heraude they smyte anoon. There is heraude mysse bee-falle: Loste he hath his men alle, And recouere he shall sone this; For grete socour him cometh ywis. Heraude they dryue strongely, And he werred on him hardily. Whan Guy sawe heraude comyng, Oute of that stronge fighte fleyng, His helme to-dasshed in stedes moo, His sheelde to-hewen all-moste in twoo (And his hors wounded sawe he: In stronge fighte he had bee): With loude steuene than he yede To the Duke and made assaute full quede. He rescowed heraude in the felde, And the other they toke and helde. Whan Otes sawe sir Guyon Come rennyng to him as a lyoun, With highe voice he gan vpbreide, And to the Duke Otes thus he seide: ‘Thou false and disceyuable traitour, Full litell thou thoughte on thyn honour, Whanne thow bee-traidest me, And dud my men with sorowe slee In the forest of playnes, as y forthe come With my felawes, good knyghtes echoone. Fro hense forewarde, y telle the, Thy dedely foo y shalbee. In good poynte to bee y am not like, Tille y haue thyn hede of strike.’ With that either of theim pricked his stede, And in grete wrathe to-gider yede. Otes smote Guy in the sheelde, That euen half flowe in the felde, And Guy gaue Otes a wounde: Thurgh his theighe he thruste his swerde grounde, And his hede he had him benome, Had not grete socour to him the rather come. Two hundred knyghtes assailled Guy, And him wolde haue sleyn wilfully, And he him defended as a man: All that he smote woo theim beecam. There they haue their lorde redde, And all wounded oute of the place ledde. Guy the Almaignes before him wreketh: Many he taketh, and many he sleeth. Guy theim driueth, and fast they flee, As folke that greuously ouerecome bee. With that come the Duke Reyner, And the Constable sir Gaudemer: In a slade they metten Guy, And strongly on him sette they; And Guy him drowe toward the Roume, And all his felawes that with him come; For ther were a thousand knyghtes With theim to mete anone Rightes. ‘Lordinges,’ quoth Guy, ‘herken to me: Thise knyghtis bee comyng as ye may see, The Duke Reyner of Cessoigne And the Duke Gaudemer of Coloigne. In euery side we bee-sette bee, So that we may not hense flee; And though we might y nelle; For forsothe, y shall you telle, Better it is to dye manly Than to flee with shame and vilanye.’ All they answerd in that stede, ‘With the we woll abide veraily in dede.’ To-gider they smyte than faste: Of the Almaignes they were not agaste. There they beganne all newe fighte, Wher-thurgh deide many a good knighte. Guy gooth to smyte Duke Reyner, And of his stede he felled him ther. Heraude smote to Gaudemer there, And oute of his sadell he did him bere. With that cometh forth Gilmyn: Besibbe he was the Duke Segwyn. Than duke Botolf he smote so, That of his hors he felled him tho. Whan that sawe Duke Reyner And the Constable Gaudemer, Before theim their folke sleyne, With grete sorowe and with peyne Their voices lowde they greyde, And assembled ayene with their ayde. With that come the Duke Reyner, And Gilemyn he mette ther, So that the swerde longe and brode Thurgh-oute his hepe it glode. Gilemyn with-drowe abacke fleyng, Ayene-warde faste priking, And is to Duke Segwyn come: Well he him knewe right sone. ‘Sir Duke,’ quoth Gilemyn, Thou abidest to longe, by seynt Martyn. Socour thy folke, and that blyue: The Almaignes begynne fast on vs dryue.’ Whan the Duke of Gilemyn this herde, And of his folke how it ferde, He smote his stede and gan to goon, To his men he seide anoon: Barons, knyghtis, strengthe you Guy wele to socour now; For and Guy bee dede or nome, All we bee thanne ouercome.’ With that come the Duke dryuyng, And the Almaignes fast assailling. The Duke a knyghte smote anone, That dede he did him to grounde goon. Guy they socour well with all: Many a good knyght he did dede down fall. On either side they foughte wele With their launces and swerdes of stele: They smote of hedes, armes, and honde; All to-hewen they lye in the sonde. With that cometh Duke Reyner, Sleyne he hath the good Gayer: In fraunce he was borne, Guyes feere; To Guy he was leef and dere. Whan Guy that sawe he was sory: To the Duke he smote greuously, That of his stede he felled him downe; And than he drowe his swerde browne. Suche a stroke he smote him vpon That dey he wende forth-with anoon. Sone there beganne a straunge shoure: To-geder they smyte knyghtis of valoure. So many strokes yiuen thou might see Of the knightis that smote so free: Bothe with spere and with swerde They yiue many strokes and harde. Ther men might see straye many a stede, And many a knyght shriche and grede. Wherto shuld y make a tale of nought? The Almaignes were to deth brought. Nowe been the Almaignes ouere-come, To dethe wounded, and greuously nome. Toward their hooste they goo fleyng, The Duke and Guy after theim dryuyng. With that come priking Terry full sone, Of Gornoyse Aubries owne sone, Of thirty Knyghtis swithe and snelle Of his owne meyne hardy and felle: All they come armed the hooste fro, The Almaignes socour for to doo. There they haue theim mette: With loude steuene withoute lette, ‘Lordingis,’ he seide, ‘how goo ye? Ayene wende nowe with me To assaille eftsones your foon, Of whom ye bee ouerecome echoon, The Auchinleck MS. has been followed from line 2207, ff. Or ichil telle þemperour ?e han y-don him gret deshonour, When ?e for a fewe men Schul so sone oway flen.’ Þai turned hem anon ri?t, &amp; bi-gun a newe fi?t. Al togider þai gun smite; Semblant of loue þai kidde bot lite. Heteliche to him smot Gyoun; His scheld nas nou?t worþ a botoun, No his tvifold armes halp him nou?t Þat in Loreyn weren y-wrou?t. Strokes hij togider delden ywis On helmes &amp; on bri?t scheldes; So hard þai striken hem bitvene, Þat gode stones fallen þer ben. Aiþer semed a lyoun of mode, So hard þai smiten wiþ swordes gode. Wiþ him smot þe douke Segyn, No lenge mi?t he wiþhelden him; Togider þai smiten hard and wel Wiþ brondes wele wrou?t of stiel. Wiþ þat come prikeand Tirri, Of Gurmoise þerl sone Aubri; Wel sternliche he smitt a kni?t, Þat ded he fel anon ri?t. So sone so douke Segyn seþ þis, Wel wroþ he was wiþ him y-wis; Wroþlich he seyd to Gij, ‘Here is gret scorn sikerly, When þat olepi kni?t Schal ous do so michel vnri?t, &amp; þan wiþ his saut owai flen.’ Gij answerd, ‘turn we o?en, &amp; hardiliche aseyl we hem: Anon turn we o?en.’ Þe Almauns þai go to asayl Wiþ gret strengþe in batayl; Sorweful of hem was þe meteinge Wiþ brondes of stiel wele kerueinge. Anon þe Almaundes gin flen, &amp; þe oþer turnen o?en. Þe douk Segyn o?ain come, Ri?t to his cite þe way he nome, &amp; Gij afterward wiþ him is go, &amp; eke his feren also. Wiþ hem þai habben her prisouns, Doukes, erls, &amp; barouns; Wel glad &amp; bliþe þan ben he, &amp; al þat weren in þat cite. To her innes þai ben y-gon, Wel glad ben hij euerichon. Þe douke goþ in-to þe tour: His prisouns he doþ gret anour, Þerl Reyner of Sessoyne, &amp; þerl Gaudiner of Coloyne, &amp; wiþ hem þe stewerd, Þat gode kni?t was &amp; wel y-herd. Wiþ him eten he hem dede, &amp; more þan himself hem worþschipede. Þe douke his soster cleped him to, Þe fairest maiden þat mi?t go. ‘Þe prisouns þou nim to þe, In þi chamber wiþ þe to be; In þi chaumber kepes me Þis gentil kni?tes hende &amp; fre; &amp; ouer alle oþer þe douke Reyner: In hert he is me lef &amp; dere.’ ‘Sir,’ sche seyd, ‘ichil so Hem to kepe my mi?t y-do.’ Ac þe riche emperour fre, Of þis comberment nist he. Wiþ a kni?t he pleyd atte ches Of Hungri, þat he loved y-wis. Wiþ þat com Tirri prikeinge, In his fest his brond bereinge: His hauberk was al to-tore, &amp; his nasel avaled bifore. Þurch his bodi þe blod ran; Tirri made no semblaunt of þan; His strong scheld al to-hewen was, Nou?t a fot hole þer-of nas. ‘Emperour,’ he seyd, ‘vnder-stond to me: Hard tidinges may y telle þe Of þine barouns þat y-nome be; No schal þai neuer com to þe. Sum be ded &amp; brou?t to grounde, &amp; sum be nomen, &amp; sum be wounde: Y-nomen is þe douk Reyner, &amp; þe constable Gaudiner; Þe douke of Pauie wounded is Wiþ a swerd þurch þe bodi y-wis: Of þe deþ he drat him sore, Hele no worþ him neuer more.’ When þemperour herd þo What þerl Tirri seyd him to, Wel sori he was, &amp; wroþ þer-fore, Þat ney?e he haþ his witt forlore. Y-sworn he haþ a wel gret oþ Bi god almi?ti al for-soþ, Þat neuer bliþe no worþ he, Al what þat cite y-nomen be, &amp; þat þe traitours ben y-slawe, Oþer for-brent, oþer y-flawe. His heste he dede cri anon, His men to arme hem euerichon; His scheltromes anon he di?t, &amp; redi þai ben al to fi?t. Þe feldes þai ben sone ouer-gon Þat were þe tounes bisiden on, Al what hij comen to þe cite. Gaier þan forþ ?ede he Wiþ fif hundred armed kni?tes, Hardi &amp; wele doand in fi?tes.

Þe douke him com forþ wiþ þat, Wele y-armed on stede he sat: ‘Gij,’ he seyd, ‘what schal we do? ?if we go &amp; smite hem to, Or we gon our walles to were, Þat þe Almayns ous nou?t dere?’ Þan spac Sir Gij fot hot, ‘Wele schaltow do, for-soþe y wot: Nim we now an hundred kni?tes, &amp; go asayl hem anon ri?tes. Bifor þe cite y se stond here Gaier, þemperour sone Reyner, &amp; fif hundred kni?tes in her ferred, Wele y-armed on heye stede. Biforn her ost þei ben y-comen, Angwisous ous to nimen; &amp; ?if we habbeþ gret nede, O?ain-ward we mai ous spede.’ Anon þai nomen an hundred kni?tes, Hardi &amp; of most mi?tes; Þai wenten out of þat cite, Wel modi men weren he. Wiþ þe Almauns þai wil iusti, Nil hii nou?t wiþ hem acordi; Togider þai smiten hard &amp; swiþe, Of hors þai fellen mani a siþe. Sir Gij him smot to Gaier, &amp; feld him doun of his destrer, &amp; seþþen he wan him in þat fi?t; Þe oþer oway flowen anon ri?t. Toward þe ost þai flowen snelle, Þe hete was swiþe strong wiþ alle. Mani þai nomen &amp; bounden fast, &amp; ladde into þe cite on hast. When þai of þe ost y-seye þis, Þat her folk ouercomen is, &amp; þat was in þat fi?t y-nome Gaier, þat was þemperour sone, Þan hastiliche þe ost ichon Opon Segyn þat smiten anon.

Þurch pride þan ferd he Fram his ost, and fram his cite. Wele hii deden no þe les, He and Gii þat mi?ti wes, &amp; wiþ hem Herhaud of Arderne; To hem þai smiten swiþe ?erne. Wiþ þat com prikeing Tirri, Þat gode kni?t was &amp; hardi; To þe douk Segyn he smot, &amp; of his hors feld him fot hot; Ac þe douk anon vp stert, As he þat was agremed in hert, &amp; out he drou? his swerd of stiel, &amp; defended him swiþe wel. Whom þat he rau?t, ded he fel; Strong kni?t he was, hardi &amp; snel. Þer he defended him asperliche; Þe Almaunis him asayl hastiliche: Y-loken he was hem amidwerd, To him þai launced boþe spere and swerd. In mani stede wounded is he; Wele he werþe him þei he sailed be. When Gij seye þe douke of fot, For sorwe no wist he no bot; Wel hardiliche he smot a kni?t, Þat ded he feld him anon ri?t.

Lordinges, listeneþ to me now! Of a tresoun ichil telle ?ou: It was opon a somers day, Þemperour hadde eten, soþ to say; His huntes he of-sent þo, &amp; seyd he wald on hunting go Into þe forest erlike, Þat þe douk Segyn nou?t no wite, No his kni?tes neuer þe mo. Þat him herd a spie þo, Þat out of þat ost dede him fast, To þe douke Segyn he com an hast. Þe douke Segyn oxed him snelle What newe tidinges he couþe telle: ‘Sir,’ quod [he], ‘herken to me: Gode tidinges y telle þe, Þat þemperour, sikerliche, Wille huntte to morwe arliche In his forest priueliche Wiþ litel folk &amp; nou?t wiþ miche, Wiþ also litel als he may. Y no gabbe nou?t, for soþe to say.’ Þan he hade seyde þus to Segyn, ‘Bi Seyn Richer! leue frende mine,’ Seyd þe douke, ‘and it so be, An hundred bessauns ?if y þe.’ Þe spie seyd, ‘soþe y sigge: My bodi þerfore in ostage y legge.’ Þan haþ þe douk y-cleped Gij, &amp; Herhaud of Arderne sikerlij, Dan Belin, &amp; dan Gauter, &amp; þe þridde dan Holdimer, &amp; Joceran þat was of Speyne (Was non wiser in-to Almayne A gode conseyl for to ?iue; Þer-fore he was michel to leue). ‘Lordinges,’ he seyd, ‘what rede ?e, Seþþe þat ?e be sworn to me? What is ous best for to done Of our king Reyner? telle me sone.’ Gij to him answerd snelle, ‘Þe best rede ichil þe telle: Kni?tes we schul han a þousinde, &amp; bi þe morwe, ?if we him finde, Ichil him bidde wiþ hert fre Þat he wil acord wiþ þe, &amp; þat he cum wiþ þe at ete; &amp; ?if he seyþ ou?t wiþ hete, Þat he it wil graunt for no þing, Hider we schul bring þe king. &amp; þou schalt here bileue now, Opon þi lord go no schaltow; Þi palays þou schalt grayþi, &amp; riche metes di?t redi.’ Þe douk answerd anon ri?t: ‘So help me god, ful of mi?t, Also þou wilt, þou schalt do.’ Wiþ þat is Gij þennes y-go; In-to þe way he dede him anon Þer þemperour schuld forþ gon. Þemperour bi þe morwe aros, Into his forest he rideþ &amp; gos: A gret bore þai founden, y-wis, &amp; hij vncopled her houndis; Her hornes þai blewe loude &amp; stille, Her houndes vrn wiþ gode wille. Þemperour biheld sone wiþ þan Unto a diche þat water in ran; He seyd, ‘y-treyst we ben here: Sir Tirri, mi frende dere, No sestow hou þat ?onder ride Kni?tes? þai ben of gret pride. On ich halue bisett we beþ, Nis her nou?t bot þe deþ. Felawes þai be þe douke Segyn, Whom þat god ?if iuel fin! Gij of Warwike þer y sey, Y-armed on his stede an hey.’ ‘Sir emperour,’ quod Tirri anon, ‘For þe rode loue þat god was on don, Ich þe bidde, hennes go now, For godes loue no lenge bileue þou! &amp; ichil here bileuen ay, &amp; ?if ich Gij mete may, Wiþ meschaunce y schal him gret, &amp; al his feren þat y mete. Ar ich be ded or nomen be Þou schalt passe al þis cuntre.’ Þemperour seyd, ‘for soþe, y nille: Here ichil wiþ ?ou duelle.’ Hastiliche þai armed hem anon, &amp; lepe her gode stedes opon. Wiþ þat come Gij prikeinde, &amp; a smal tvige in his hond bereinde Of oliue, in token of pais: To þemperour he grad as curteys, &amp; seyd, ‘god, þat alle þing may se, Sir emperour, so loke þe Þiselue, &amp; al þi meyne, Þat in place wiþ þe be! Þe douke Segyn þe sent bi me Þat trewþe &amp; loue he wil to þe, &amp; biddeþ þe als his lord dere, Þeselue, &amp; alle þine fere, Þat wiþ þe ben togider here, Þat ?e come to him to þe dinere; And his gode cite he wil þe ?elde Wiþ al his castels he haþ in welde; &amp; ?if he haue don o?ain skille, He wille amende it to þi wille.’ When þemperour herd him speke so, &amp; so gret loue bede him to, Þe king of Hongrie he cleped þo, And sir Tirri he dede also: ‘Lordinges,’ he seyd, ‘what schal we do? Rede ?e þat we þider go?’ The Caius MS. has been followed from line 2565 to line 2717; text is missing from the Auchinleck MS. Than seide Terry to the Emperour: ‘The Duke you dooth grete honour, Whan he his Citees and Castellis echoone, That stronge been of lyme and stoone, All deliuere at thyn owne wille (Thanke thou owest him by reason and skille), And at thy wille his body doo. Wende ye thider, y rede you so; For, if he doo as thise men haue highte, More Worship the doo he ne mighte; For with strength thou getest this profre neuere, With all the power that thou kan keuer.’ ‘I woll,’ quoth the Emperour, ‘that it so bee, Bot that y him nought see, Till y haue counsailled me With my barons that in their hostage bee.’ With that they gynne for to wende, And of accorde speke the knightis hende. To Ransone they bee come, And richely there they bee vnder-noome; And Guy him dresseth with all his might Well to serue bothe baron and knight: Ther was yoman ne swayne noon, Bot Guy theim yiftes yaue good woon. Whan it was nyghte, to bedde they goo, And erly arise withoute moo. To the Chirche the Emperour is goo, For to here his masse tho. His eerles and barons aboute him gan stonde, That were of many dyuerse londe; And the Duke there was nought, For the Emperour hym hated in his thought. The same daye tymely The Duke aroosse full eerly: Rewthfully he dighte him there In his sherte allone with open heere: A stronge roope he toke thoo, And aboute his nekke he gan it doo. Than to his prisouners he is goon, And theim dooth reson oon by oon: ‘Lordinges, barouns, y bidde you, That ye woll prey for me now To our lorde, so well ye may, That he me foryiue this same day His wrathe and his male-talent.’ And all they him graunte with oon assent. Than he threwe his mantell of: Many man had grete rewthe therof. In his sherte he stode allone: For him was made mikell mone. To the Emperour he gooth soo, An Olyue boughwe in his handes twoo, That pees shuld beetoken betwene theim. All weping his wey forth he doth kenne. Thurgh the strete barefote he gooth And barehede in his sherte forsoth With a roope aboute his swere: Many man behelde him there. Erles and Dukes of grete valour For him they preide to the Emperour: On their knees vpon the stoon For him they besoughte euerychoon, That he wolde haue mercy of Segwyn For goddis loue and seynte Martyn. With that is Segwyn to the Chirche come, On his knees he felle full sone: Of the Emperour he besoughte mercy For goddis loue and oure Lady. ‘Sir Emperour,’ seide Segwyn, ‘This daie is come ending myn, Bot thou haue mercy on me. At thy wille it shal bee. No lenger y ne woll thy wrath dryue, While y am man a-lyue, Bot oute of this londe y shall goo, And neuere ayene to come moo. Here my swerde, thou take it, And myn hede of thou smyte, Or what thy wille is, doo by me (Myn owne Lorde, y woll it so bee) For the folie that y dude, Whan y slowe thy neuiew in that stede.’ Than bespake the Emperoures sone To his fader and seide: ‘sir, of your benesone, Segwyn is a noble baroun. Holden he hath vs in prisoun: To vs he hath bee full kynde, And to you herafter may bee well helping. Bot thou foryiue him thy wrath swithe, Of me thou shalt neuere bee blithe.’ Than seide the Duke Reyner full sone: ‘Sir Segwyn is a noble baron. Sithe he obeyeth him to thy wille, Foryiue him thy wrathe, and that is skille, Of thy neuyew, that he slow by cas; For in his defence, by god, it was. And if any woll contrary that y-sey, Before you to preoue it my gloue y woll ley. And bot if thou haue of him mercy, Euer here-after y shalbee thyn enmy.’ Than come forthe sir Gaudemer, And thus to the Emperour he spake there: ‘Sir, y loue the Duke ouere all thing; For he vs hath doo grete worshipping, And sworne brethern we bee two: And thou hense forewarde him mysdoo, All my people y shall forsende, And in-to Coloigne y shall wende: Thy Castellis and Citees, that been so stronge, Destroye y shall for thy wronge. Bot thou mercy of him haue nowe, All this y shall ayenst thy prowe.’ With that come the Styward forthe: ‘Sir, the Duke is moche worthe, And grete worship he hath vs doo (Neuere more yet come vs vnto), Whan he in bataille vs hath nome, And you hath thus doo hider come. Bot thou of him haue the rather mercy, Euere of me herafter thou shalt failly.’ With that cometh forth Guy Of Warrewik, the Knyght hardy: ‘Sir, for goddis Loue y bidde the, On this Duke thou haue mercy and pitee, And with that y shall your man become To serue the, Lorde, all and some.’ Tirry is than forthe come, Of Gormeyse Aubries sone: ‘Sir, on this Duke ye must haue mercy For loue of thise good men, that stonde you by. Yf thou haue loste thurgh him Sadok the hende, that was thy kyn, In his stede y shall bee, And with all my might serue the. Therfor' at an ende y beseche the, Foryiue him your wrathe with herte free. And bot ye woll that doo, Beleue it well withoute wordes moo.’ So longe they haue the Emperour bede, That he is agreable to their rede. To theim he seith with herte free: ‘Lordes, barons, herken to me. Now ye all haue bidden so, For your loue y shall thus doo, And for sir Guy, that is englissh, That so good knyght and curteys is: All my wrathe y foryiue him For loue of the soules of my kynn, And for y him so mylde see. Vnderstonde nowe and herken to me: For he me crieth mercy withoute pride, Mercy he shall haue to his mede.’ The Auchinleck MS. has been followed from line 2716 ff. ‘Sir emperour, wat hastow do? Is þe acord made bitven ?ou to? Astow þe douke Segyn y-kist, Þe strong traitour &amp; vnwrest? &amp; haþ for-?if al in loue Sadok deþ, þi suster sone?

Ac now þai worþ wiþ þe priue, &amp; better þan alle we. &amp; topen al þis, ?if Gij wer ded, We mi?ten haue þe lesse dred.’ When Gij herd Otus speke so, Als a wilde bore he lepe him to: ‘Otus!’ quaþ Gij, ‘þou schalt daye, When þou of tresoun clepes ous baye, Boþe Segyn &amp; eke me: Þou it schal abie, bi mi leute!’ Him he smot wiþ his fest Amide the teþ, ri?t al in ernest. Ac þe barouns bitvene hem goþ, &amp; þemperour swore his oþ, ?if ani þer were so hardy Þat dede oþer schame oþer vilanie, Bren men him scholde, oþer to-hewe, Oþer al to-hewe at wordes fewe. Þan doþ þai crie þurch þe cuntraye, Þat of þo wordes no man schuld saye; ‘&amp; ?if þer doþ, wiþ-outen no, Hond oþer fot he schal for-go.’ Than seyd þemperour on þis maner To þe douke Segyn oforn hem þer: ‘Sir douke, ichil loue þe: Wiif þou schalt haue bi me. A feir soster ich haue in mi bour Ichil þe ?if,’ quaþ þemperour: ‘Erneborwe hat þat may.’ Anon he hir spoused þat day. Þe bridale was holden wiþ game, y pli?t. Neuer ?et nas non fairer in si?t. He loued hir, &amp; worþ-schiped swiþe: To his cite he ladde hir siþe, He and Ernneborwe his leuedi Þer hii wold soiornij. Anon after þe tende day Of her soiourn, soþe to say, Gij is to þe douke y-go, &amp; at him asked leue þo: ‘Sir douk,’ he seyd, ‘gon ich-ille, In þis cuntre bileue y nille. In wer ich haue serued þe: ?if þou haue euer eft nede to me, After me þou sende sikerliche, &amp; ich com to þe hastiliche.’ ‘Sir,’ quaþ þe douk, ‘gramerci! ?ete haue y nou?t serued þe, sir Gij. Here, ich bid þe, bileue wiþ me: Half mine castels, &amp; half mi cite, Þe worþschip of Lowayn haluen-del, Ich it þe graunt, Gij, fair &amp; wel.’ Gij tok his leue; oway went he: Þe douke wepe sore, &amp; hadde pite. Þemperour þat was so fre, Wiþ him Gij þan ladde he; Castels him bede, &amp; cites, Gret worþschip, &amp; riche fes, Ac he þerof nold afo, For noþing þat he mi?t do. To Almayn went ben he, To Espire þat riche cite. Þemperour worþschiped Gij þe fre; A while wiþ him bileft he. To pleyn hem þai went bi riuer Þat of wilde foule ful were; To her wille an hunting hij gos, To chace þe hert &amp; þe ros. On a day as he cam fram hunting A dromond he seye ariueing. Þider-ward sir Gij is y-gon, &amp; gret þe marchandes euerichon. ‘Lordinges, whennes com ?e, Þat in þis riuer ariued be? Bi ?our semblant y se, y-wisse, Þat ?e ledde gret richesse.’ Among hem alle þer spac on, Þat couþe speke for hem euerichon: ‘Fram Costentine þe noble y-comen we be: Lond of peys þan seche we.

Castel no cite nis him non bileued, Þat altogider þai han to-dreued, &amp; for-brant, &amp; strued, y-wis. Into Costentyn flowen he is; Þer he werþ him o?aines his fon, Þat secheþ on him for to slon. Þritti mile men may riden &amp; gon, Ne schal men finde man non; &amp; we ben aschaped vnneþe, Þat we no were to-hewen to deþe. Y-comen we ben into þis cuntre: Fowe &amp; griis anou? lade we, Gold and siluer, &amp; riche stones, Þat vertu bere mani for þe nones, Gode cloþes of sikelatoun &amp; Alisaundrinis, Peloure of Matre, &amp; pu[r]per &amp; biis, To ?our wille as ?e may se; Swiche be þe tidinges of þat cuntre.’ Gij answerd, ‘mi frende fre, For ?our tidinges blisced ?e be! God, for his name seuene, He bring ?ou to gode heuene!’ When þe marchaundes hadde seyd as y say, Gij bitau?t hem god &amp; gode day. Vnto his in he is y-go, And Herhaud he cleped anon him to. ‘Herhaud, mi frende, wille we gon? At þemperour take we leue anon. Into Costentyn-noble ichil go To help þemperour of his wo: Þat wiþ þe soudan biseged is he, So siggeþ men of þat cuntre; Þat lond destrud &amp; men aqueld, &amp; cristendom þai han michel afeld.’ Herhaud answerd, ‘y graunt it be: Miche worþschipe it worþ to þe.’ At þemperour þai toke leue to go, &amp; he hem graunted vnneþe þo; Anou? he bedeþ hem castels &amp; tours, Riche cites, halles, &amp; bours. Sir Gij toke an hundred of his kni?tes, Strongest and best in fi?tes, Þat he mi?t in Almayne finde, Mest y-preised &amp; best doinde. Now þai ben to schippe y-went: Gode winde god haþ hem lent. To Costentyn-noble þai ben y-come, &amp; in þe cite her in y-nome. Ac when þemperour wist atte frome Þat Gij of Warwike was y-come, Tvay erls he dede after him go, &amp; loueliche he bad hem com him to. &amp; sir Gij him goþ to þemperour fre: ‘Welcome, sir Gij,’ þan seyd he. ‘Of þine help gret nede haue we. Michel ich haue herd speke of þe. Mine men ben sleyn in þis tide, &amp; mi lond destrud in ich a side: Al bot þis ich selue cite Destrud &amp; brent hauen he.

Mine men þai slowe, mi sone also, Wharfore, leue frende, y bede þe to, ?if þou mi?t me of hem wreke, &amp; þe felouns out of mi lond do reke, Mine feyr douhter þou schalt habbe, &amp; half mi lond, wiþ-outen gabbe.’ Þan answerd anon sir Gij, ‘Sir,’ he seyd, ‘gramercij! &amp; y þe sigge, bi mi leute, Þat treweliche ichil serue þe Al þe while þat ich wiþ þe be: Þerof, sir, þou mi?t leue me.’ At þemperour he toke leue anon, Vnto his in he gan to gon. Noyse &amp; cri he herd in þat cite: He gan oxy what it mi?t be. He hem oxed what it were, &amp; what was al þat noise þere. So mani kni?tes he seye to armes go, So mani seriaunce steye to kernels þo. ‘Sir,’ quaþ a burieys, ‘bi seyn Martin, It beþ þe liþer Sarrazin: It is þe amiral Costdram, Þe nevou of þe riche soudan. So strong he is, &amp; of so gret mi?t, In world y wene no better kni?t; For þer nis man no kni?t non Þat wiþ wretþe dar loken him on.

Of þemperour sone þat he slou?, Þat was so gode and stalworþ kni?t, Þat opon hem had ?euen mani fi?t. In þis cite so gode kni?t was non, Þat with wretþe durst loke him on. Comen he is wiþ grete cheualrie, &amp; wiþ him þe riche king of Turkye Wiþ an hundred Turkes strong: Beþ non better in non lond.’ &amp; when sir Gij herd þis Þat his ost seyd to him, y-wis, To his felawes he seyd anon, ‘To armes,’ he seyd, ‘euerichon! Þe Sarrazins we willen agast. For godes loue, smiteþ on fast!’ Hastiliche y-armed hij beþ, Opon her stedes as foule þai fleþ. Forþ þai went &amp; on hem smite Wiþ her swerdes þat wil wel bite. Gij to þe amiral smot so, Scheld no hauberk nas him worþ a slo: Þurch þe body he ?af him wounde, &amp; dede he feld him on þe grounde. Sir Gij his gode swerd out drou?, Þat heued fram þe bodi he slou?. To þemperour he it haþ y-sent, Þat wel glad was of þat present. Herhaud smot þe king of Turkie (Was non feller into Surrie): Þurch þe bodi he him smot, Ded he feld him doun fot hot. Wiþ þat com Tebaud prikeinde, In Fraunce y-bore, a kni?t wel kinde: Wiþ swiche strengþe he smot Helmadan, Al was nou?t worþ he hadde opan. Þurch his bodi þe launce glod; Ded he fel wiþ-outen a-bod. Gauter come prikeing anon ri?t, Of Almayne a wel gode kni?t. Heteliche he smot Redmadan (?e no haue herd speke of no swiche man): Þe bodi atvo he haþ to-deled, Þat he fel doun in þe feld. Wiþ þat come sir Morgadour, Þat was steward wiþ þemperour. Kni?t he was gode &amp; hardi, Ac traitour he was, ful of envie. He smot vnto a Sarrazin, No halp him nou?t his Apolin. Now þai smitte togider comonliche, &amp; fi?t þai agin ardiliche. Þer men mi?t se Gij smite, &amp; þe Sarrazins heuedes of strike, &amp; wiþ him Herhaud also: Boþe þai strengþed hem wele to do. Þe Sarrazins þai strengþed hem for to sle, To-hewen, &amp; iuel to bise. Þe Sarrazins hem ?eld gret fi?t, For strong þai ben, &amp; of gret mi?t. Wiþ þat come Esclandar prikeinde, A Sarrazin &amp; of foule kinde, Þe kinges sone of Birrie, Strong he was for þe maistrie. Dan Tebaud he felled þo, Þurch þe bodi he dede þe launce go; &amp; seþþe he slou? a Freyns kni?t, In Bleyues he was born ari?t. Romiraunt com forþ snelle, A Sarrazin a strong wiþ elle, Y-slawe he haþ dan Guinman, A strong kni?t he was &amp; an Aleman. Wiþ þat come forþ an amireld, A Sarrazin of wicked erd, Dan Gauter he haþ y-slawe, &amp; gode Gilmin his felawe. When Herhaud þat of-seye þo, In his hert him was ful wo; An amiral he smot so, Ded he feld him an hast þo, &amp; mani anoþer he haþ aqueld, &amp; adoun feld in þe feld. Sone so Esclandar y-seye þis, To awreke þe amiral lef him is. To Herhaud he smot heteliche, &amp; he him mett hardiliche; Heteliche þai smiten togider þo, Þat of her hors þai fellen bo. Seþþen þai drou? her brondes of stiel, &amp; smiten togider hard &amp; wel, To-hewe hauberk &amp; scheldes also, Gode bodis þai ben boþe to. Of her helmes þe flours gan fle, So heteliche togider smiten he. Herhaud goþ him driueand fast, His heued to smiten of on hast. Ac so gret socour him com þer, An hundred Turkes &amp; her pouer; Herhaud þai gin alle asaile, &amp; neye hadde slain him in þat bataile, No hadde Gij þat y-seye, þat was sorij; Hastiliche he com him to socourey. His gode brond þan drou? he, Þe heued of a Sarrazin he dede of fle, &amp; anoþer he dede also; Þe þridde to deþ he dede do. Herhaud he socourd in þat nede, &amp; dede him lepe opon his stede. Þe Sarrazins anon gun þai mete, Mani on þer her liif þai lete, Mani on þer dyed in aiþer side, Ac þe Sarrazins wers gan bi-tide. Sir Gij &amp; alle his feren, Þe Griffouns þat gode weren, Han ouer-comen &amp; aqueld; To-hewen þai leyen in the feld. Toward her ost þai ben fleinge, &amp; Gij hem after fast folweinge; Ar hij þe doun were ouer gon, Y-slawe hij ben &amp; to-hewen ichon. Esclandar is oway fleinde, Ouer þe dounes fast erninde, &amp; al to-broken his scheld is, His helme al to-dassched, y-wis. Gij it of-þou?t when he it seye, Þat he so li?teliche oway fleye: ‘Esclandar,’ seyd Gij, ‘wende o?ain to me, &amp; forsoþe al siker þou be; Drede þe of no noþer þan of me, Ones to iusti ich oxi of þe.’ Esclandar seyd, ‘artow Gij? Ich þe defende sikerly. Bi Mahoun þat ich leue opon, Neuer no schal ich oway gon, No neuer schal y bliþe be, Til ich þat heued binim þe; Bihoten ich it haue a maiden of pris, Þe soudans douhter þat wel fair is.’ Her steden þai turned snelle, &amp; to-gider þai smiten wiþ gode wille; Esclandar first smot Gij Þurch þe scheld as kni?t hardi; Gij smot him anon ri?t, Scheld no hauberk halp him no wi?t; He smot him þurch at þat chaunce Þurch þe bodi wiþ his launce. Esclandar fleye forþ a wel gode pas, Sir Gij of-toke him nou?t, þerfor wo him was; To his felawes he is y-go, Ri?t to þe cite he ?ede him þo. Þe Sarrazins were ouer-come, Þerfore þai were bliþe, all and some. Þemperour of-sent Gij him to, &amp; miche honour he haþ him do. ‘Gij,’ quaþ he, ‘þou art me dere, Þou schalt bileue wiþ me here: Mi feir douhter, þat is of pris, Ichil þe ?iue to spouse y-wis; Þou schalt ben emperour after me, Þou art a kni?t of gret bounte. Al þo þat ben to me serueinde, Ichil þai be to þe boweinde.’ ‘Gramerci,’ seyd sir Gij anon; ‘A fair ?ift is þis now on.’ Þe steward come forþ bliue, More treytour nas non oliue; His name was hoten Morgadour, God ?if him euel auentour! Toward Gij he bar gret ond, &amp; seþþe he died þurch his hond. Quaþ Morgadour, ‘sir, þat wil wele be, For Gij is curteys, gentil, &amp; fre; When he schal þi douhter spousy, Ri?t is þat we him onoury.’ Ac what so he seyd bifor Gij þo, ?if he may, to deþ he wille him do. Esclandar went oway fleinde, Toward her ost fast prikeinde; Þurch þe bodi he bar a trounsoun, Wiþ boþe honden he held him to þe arsoun. Boþe bifore &amp; eke bihinde, Þe blod gan out fast winde, His helme in þe on half honginde, &amp; his visage al bledeinde. His scheld to held hadde he no mi?t, He drad him to dye anon ri?t. To þe soudans pauiloun he come, Þe soudan him bi-knewe anon: ‘Esclandar, when comestow?’ seyd he; ‘In strong fi?t þou hast y-be. Were þou alon at þe cite? Say me who haþ þus wounded þe?’ ‘Sir,’ quaþ he, ‘ichil þe telle Of hard tidinges wel snelle: Y-lorn þou hast þe amiral Cosdram Þat leuest þe was of ani man, &amp; þe king of Turkie þou hast forgon, Of hem no tit þe neuer help non. &amp; alle þe best men y-bore Bifor þe cite þou hast forlore.’ Þan answerd þe riche soudan, Þat hadde no gamen of þan: ‘Him is þan sum socour y-come, Whar-þurch mi Turkes be me binome?’ ‘Sir,’ quaþe Esclandar, ‘y-wis, An onwrast gome y-comen þer is; Socour he haþ gret &amp; beld, In þe warld nis swiche a scheld; Gij of Warwike his name it is, Sterner þan ani lyoun, y-wis. His strokes no may noman dreye, Þat he ne most dye on hye. Wiþ him he haþ an hundred kni?tes Of Almayne, þe best in fi?tes; Þurch þe bodi þus me he smot, Dede ich am, wele y wot.’ Þan swore a gret oþ þe soudan Bi Mahoun þat he leued opan, Þat neuer glad no worþ he What he haue y-nome þat cite; For asayle he it wille do Ar þe þridde day be ago. Anon a spie it herd þis, Þat to Gij it nold for-hele y-wis. Sone he com to þe cite; Al þis to Gij þan teld he, Þat þe soudan wiþ his men elle Þe cite wil aseyle snelle. Ac þemperour wist þer-of nou?t Þat so strong tiding þer were y-brou?t. Ac when he wist þe soþe herof, Ernist him þou?t, &amp; no scof. Þemperour made him bliþe þo Þat ouer-comen weren his fo, &amp; Gij to þemperour is y-go, &amp; swiþe feyr he gret him þo. ‘Sir,’ quaþ he, ‘be bliþe &amp; glad; Gode tidinges me haþ ben seyd.’ Þemperour of-sent his foules þo, Oscuriis, faucouns, &amp; ierfaukes also; Gon he wil to þe riuer, Him to solas &amp; play þer. Seþþe he of-sent of his Gregeys, Þat gode weren &amp; curteys. To þe riuer þai ben y-gon Wher foules were mani on. Wiþ þat come forþ sir Morgadour, Þat steward was wiþ þemperour, &amp; seyd to Gij, ‘mi frende dere, Y þe loue in gode manere.’ Ac alle þat he seyd, Gij to bitraye, Þat was wele sen in his last daye. Non no may so wele tresoun do So may he þat his trust is to. ?ete seyd to him Morgadour, ‘Castels ich haue, &amp; mani feir tour, Riche cites, &amp; ful strong, To þine wille þou hem afong; Michel y desire þi loue to haue. Go we togider wiþ game &amp; plawe: Into þe chaumber go we baye, Among þe maidens for to playe; At tables to pleye, &amp; at ches; Wele we may don it y-wis Bifor þi leman Clarice so fre, Þemperours douhter bri?t of ble. &amp; lete we þemperour to wode go, To chace þe hert &amp; þe ro.’ ‘Sir,’ quaþ Gij, ‘wille we go? When þou it wilt, it schal be do.’ Into þe chaumber þai ?ede þo Hond in hond y-fere bo. To þe mayden þai come wel sket, Þat curteysliche hem haþ y-gret. ‘Sir Gij,’ sche seyd, ‘welcome þou be! Cum sitt &amp; pleye þe here wiþ me.’ He toke þe maiden &amp; hir kiste: Þat of-þou?t þe steward vnwreste. He hir hadde loued mani a day, &amp; wende haue spoused þat feir may. Þe cheker þai oxy &amp; þe meyne; Bifor þe maiden þan pleyen he. Y-sett þai han þe first game, Þe steward it les, bi godes name. Seþþe þai han anoþer y-gonne, Anon it haþ Gij y-wonne, &amp; þe þridde ful hastiliche. Þe steward was sori sikerliche; Al mody he ros vp þo: Wroþ &amp; sori he was bo. ‘Gij,’ quaþ he, ‘bi-leue þou here, Þiself &amp; Clarice, þi pleye-fere, Al what ich come now son o?e.’ ‘Anon,’ seyd Gij, ‘it schal so be.’ Out him went Morgadour, At his in he tok a chasour, To þemperour he goþ ri?t. When þemperour hadde of him si?t, O?aines him he is y-gon, &amp; tidinges he oxed him anon. ‘Now forþ, sir steward,’ he sede, ‘Comestow for gode or for qued? Whi comestow so prikiinge? Tel it me wiþ-outen lesinge. ?if þou of Sarrazins hast herd ou?t, Tel it me; for-hele it nou?t.’ ‘Sir,’ quaþ he, ‘y schal þe telle: Þi schame forhele y nille. An soudour þou hast wiþ þe, &amp; wil þat þou y-schent be. Þi douhter, þat so feir is, Forlay he haþ, for-soþe y-wis. Into hir bour wiþ strengþe he ?ede, &amp; bi þi douhter his wille he dede.’ ?if þou ne me leuest, hom þou fare, ?ete þou schalt him finde þare. Þer þou mi?t him finde, y-wis, &amp; þi douhter clippe &amp; kisse. Þerfore y com þe to say, For þi schame forhele y no may. ?if þou him finde in þat stede, Into þi prisoun þou him lede, &amp; in þi court þou deme him do; For treitour he is, y telle þe to: Þe more adouted þou schalt be Of alle þi regne, y telle þe. Þer-fore ne wonde þou no-þing Nou?t for him no his helping; After-ward þat he demed is, &amp; þi court of þat treytour deliuerd is, Into Almayne ichil gon To þemperour Reyner anon; Socour fram him ichil bringe, &amp; deliuer þi lond, wiþouten lesinge, Of alle þine dedeliche fon, Þat þine men haue sleyn ichon.’ ‘Who is þat?’ þemperour sede. ‘Gij of Warwike, so god me rede! Þou do him nim, &amp; binde fast, &amp; in þi prisoun þou do him cast.’ Quaþ þemperour, ‘lat now be, No speke nou?t so of him to me: O?aines me misdo he nold Nou?t for tventi somers of gold, No for to ben al to-hewe: So gode a kni?t he is &amp; trewe. &amp; ?if he is þer-in, wele be it so: Wiþ hir his wille he may do; For mi douhter ichim bi-hote habbe, Nil ich nou?t of couenant gabbe.’ When þe steward him haþ bi-þou?t Þat þemperour nold here him nou?t, Hom to his in he is y-go, &amp; ali?t of his palfrey þo. Anon in-to chaumber he ?ede, &amp; to Gij of Warwike he sede, ‘Gij, þou art ful wele wiþ me, Þerfore ich-il kiþen it þe: To þemperour y-teld it is, Bi þe lord seyn Denis, Þat wiþ strengþe þou com in-to his bour &amp; has forleyn his douhter wiþ desonour. &amp; ?if he þe may ouer-go, He wil þe bren oþer slo. &amp; ich hot þe þat þou hennes fle, Þat he nou?t of-take þe.’ ‘Bi god,’ quaþ Gij, ‘þat were wrong, Þat y schold here mi deþ afong For þing þat ich haue gilt non, No neuer þou?t it to don. An arnemorwe, when he out ?ede, Miche he me o loue bede; Hou schuld ich euer siker be Of ani bi-hest men hotes me? For þemperour me seyd þo, And trewelich me bihete þerto, Þat he me wold gret worþschipe, &amp; now he me wil sle wiþ schenschipe For þe speche of a losanger, &amp; of a feloun pautener.’ Out of þe chaumber he is y-go: Sori &amp; dreri he was þo. To his in he ?ede swiþe, And cleped his felawes bliue. ‘Lordinges,’ he seyd, ‘to armes snelle! Here wil we no longer duelle: To þemperour y-wraid we beþ, Alle he wil don ous to þe deþ. Bi þe treuþe y schal our lord ?eld, Þat heuen and erþe haueþ in weld, Er þan we be nomen &amp; ded, So mani schal dye of her ferred, Þat it worþ abou?t wel strong Þat ich am bi-wrayd wrong!’ To armes þai went wiþ þat ichon; Out of þe cite þai ben y-gon, &amp; went toward þe heþen men, Wiþ þem to holden &amp; to ben, To help þe heþen men ichon. Wiþ þat com þemperour anon: Fram þe riuer he come rideinge, &amp; wiþ his folk fast prikeinge; Feir weder it was, &amp; miri also, Þe bri?t armes he seye þo. Þemperour hem seye, &amp; knewe Gij, For he come hem swiþe neye. At an herhaud þan asked he, ‘This armed folk, what may þis be?’ ‘Sir,’ quaþ he, ‘it is Gij, Þat in wretþe fram þe wil parti; Vnto þe soudan he wil fare, &amp; wirche þe sorwe &amp; michel care Þurch wraying þat teld him is: Wele y wot þat soþe it nis. Wele it semeþ þat wroþ is he; Al armed on his stede ich him se.’ When þemperour herd þis, Alle droupeninde he was y-wis, He gan to prike, &amp; þat anon: As hauk þat fleyþe his hors gan gon. After Gij loude he gradde þo: ‘Abide &amp; speke me now to! For godes loue lete now be; Whi wiltow, sir, go fro me? ?if ich ou?t haue agilt to þe, For godes loue þou say it me; Be it in dede oþer in speche That ani þe han agilt, y þe biseche, To þi wille it schal amended be, &amp; topon al oþer y loue þe. Wele ich wene þat þe soudan, y-wis, To whom al Percie atended is, After þe haþ sent: ich vnderstond so. He þe schal habbe, &amp; y forgo. Gold &amp; siluer he may ?iue þe, &amp; feffe þe wiþ mani a riche cite; Þer-fore þou wilt wiþ him be, &amp; strongliche holden o?aines me.’ ‘Sir,’ quaþ sir Gij to þemperour, ‘No was ich neuer þi traitour, And ?if god wil, y nil nou?t be, Þerwhiles þe lif is in me. Me was y-teld biforn now ri?t Of on þat is þi priue kni?t, Þat þou no hadest to don wiþ mi seruise, &amp; þat y þe serue wiþ feyntise; And þat ich was biwrayd to þe (For þi nold ich no longer here be), And þat þou wost do me to-hewe, &amp; mine barouns, þat ben so trewe. For þi y þou?t þat y go scholde To hem þat mi seruise ?eld me wold; Ac for al Damas &amp; þat cuntre Nold ich haue holden o?aines te.’ Þemperour þan him nome Bitvene his armes, &amp; seyd anon, ‘Nay, sir Gij,’ he seyd, ‘bi seyn Denis, It no was nou?t so, y-wis. Mi dere frende Gij, o?ain þou go (Lordinges, barouns, biddeþ him so); For to þine wille it is alle, Alle þat min is, and ben schal. Ac biwrayed þou war to me, &amp; þer-fore haue he maugre! Neuer eft worþ non loued of me Þat ou?t sigge bot gode of þe.’ Þemperour þan to Gij seyd, ‘Þi wille þou do bi þat mayde.’ Sir Gij kist þemperour þo, &amp; to þe cite þai ben y-go. Þo wist wele Gij bi þan, Bitreyd him hadde his foman; Ac no semblaunt þerof he no made, No no þing to him seyde. An armorwe erliche Þemperour aros, sikerliche; Anon he seyd to Gij his speche: ‘Herken to me, y þe biseche. In þis morning anon We worþ aseyled of our fon, Of Sarrazins þat misbileued be; Alle for soþe y telle it to þe. Þe soudan himselue wil þer be. A spie for soþe teld it me, Þat hij þe cite wil asayli, &amp; þat hij þennes nil parti, Al fort he haue nome þis cite, Or þat it destrued be.’ Þemperour seyd, ‘sir Gij þe fre, Als so þou wilt it schal be. Þe cite alle op þe y do Wiþ Cristes blisceing þer-to. ?if hij ous seyl we schul ous were; Þe cite is strong, þai mow it nou?t dere.’ Gij þat constable cleped him to, Þat gode kni?t was, &amp; wise also: Tristor he hete wiþ þe berd blowe, Lord &amp; douke of Almayne, y trowe. ‘Sir Tristor,’ he seyd, ‘listen to me: Aseyled we worþ, siker þou be. Þer-of þou most birede þe, ?if we wille were þis cite, Oþer we wille o?ain hem te, At paþes that destrued be, &amp; mete we hem þer on þe doune, Acumbre hem &amp; legge hem doune.’ ‘Sir,’ anon seyd the constable, ‘Þis ich speche schal be stable. Do þan grede þurch þe cite Þat alle redy armed be, Alle þat armes may welde, And who so þat feyneþ for couward be helde.’ Bi þe morwe þai ben armed wel, Bi tale .xx. thousend hauberks of stiel, Out of þe cite þai ben y-go Wiþ gret noise &amp; din also. ‘Lordinges,’ quaþ Gij, ‘herkeneþ to me ?e þat here asembled be, Of ?our kinde þat is y-slawe, Of edwite &amp; of missawe, Þat ous is don, thenke we þer-on, &amp; baldeliche aseyl we our fon; For Sarrazins ous aseyle wille, Alle for soþe y ?ou telle. We wil hem mete wiþ spere &amp; scheld At þe narwe paþe bi-tven þe held. Now biþenkeþ ?ou wele to don, &amp; awreke ?our lond of ?our fon. Of ?our londes &amp; ?our citez, Þat destrud &amp; wasted beþ, ?ou to awreke bi-þenkeþ ?ou, &amp; strongliche aseyleþ hem now. Bot ?e were ?ou wele &amp; bliue, &amp; hij mow ?ou of þe feldes driue, Alle we ben ded oþer nome, &amp; in þraldome euer more wone. For þi mete we wiþ hem sone, &amp; strengþe ous alle wele to done; &amp; ich me self wil wiþ ?ou go; Y nil ?ou feyle neuer mo.’ Wele spekeþ now Sir Gij, &amp; alle þai siggeþ, ‘gramerci!’ To þe pas of þe hulles þai ben y-come, &amp; þe Sarrazins han vnder-nome, &amp; seye þe cuntres &amp; þe feld Wiþ bri?t brini and wiþ scheld. Þe soudan cleped after Helman, Þat deined fle for no man; He was coraious &amp; gode kni?t, &amp; michel adouted in euerich fi?t. ‘Sir king,’ quaþ he, ‘come to me. Wiþ .xx. þousende Turkes, ich hot þe, The Cristen ?e schul aseyle anon. Loke ?e nim hem oþer slen ichon; Opon ?on hulle þai ben, lo; Gret harm þai han ous y-do.’ Þe king forþ went wiþ his men ichon, Wiþ strengþe þe helde þai vnder-nome; Wiþ strengþe þai wene þe slade ouer-go; Ac gret combraunce hem com furst to. At þe entring of þe pas Gij gan to grede, ‘Helpeþ, lordinges, alle our ferrede! Biþenkeþ ?ou to winnen wele. &amp; hij o?aines ?ou vndernim þe hille, Yuel ous worþ þan bi-go, Bot god ous on þenke þat al may do; Þai ben bi-neþen &amp; we aboue. Amidde þe pas þai ben to-gider come, &amp; asaileþ hem smerteliche; &amp; to-gider we go now commonliche: Þroweþ wiþ stones, and bowes scheteinge, Launces, swerdes, &amp; dartes kerueinge, Smiteþ wiþ swerdes &amp; speres y-grounde, Scheteþ wiþ piles &amp; ?if hem deþ wounde.’ Mani Sarrazin þer y-slawe is; Þer doþ Gij as þe ri?t wise. Into þe narwe hij come, hem to lett, Bi hundredes foure þai aseyl hem sket; Bi hundred &amp; bi þousende, Þai ben þe Sarrazins quellinde. Gij smot on þis side &amp; on þat: Nas þer non þat his dint sat. Ermine he smot on þurch þe scheld; Almost he feld him in þe feld. Þan come Auþer ouer þuert, A Sarrazin modi of hert: Ermine smot him on þe helme an hey?e, Þat he cleue him to þe teþ; Al ded he made him on þe grounde to lie. Wiþ þat come þe king of Nubie; Toward Herhaud he come prikeinde, &amp; Gij him was o?ain cominde. Wiþ grete strengþe sir Gij him smot Þat he feld him anon fot hot. When þe douke of Tire þat y-seþ, His men dye on so reweliche deþ (An hond he held a dart kerueinde, Þe Cristen þer-wiþ þreteninde), He forþ ?ede, &amp; smot a kni?t, Þat ded he feld him anon ri?t. When Gij o Warwike þat y-seye, Þiderward he drou? him swiþe neye: A gode dart on hond he bar, &amp; to him he launced heteliche þar. Þer-wiþ he smot Ebban þe king, Þat ded he fel wiþouten letting. Þe Sarrazines hij to-heweþ &amp; quelleþ, Bi þe doun hij gredeþ &amp; ?elleþ. When þe soudan seye his folk dye, Bi ten, bi tvelue, in þe waye, He cleped to him þe king of Nubye, Þat was ful of felonie. ‘Sir king,’ he seyd, ‘sest tow nou?t Hou mine men ben to deþ y-brou?t? Descumfit &amp; y-slawe hij beþ, Þe bodis ded wele ?e seþ. Þis Cristen our men to deþ doþ; Ac bi Cariot y swere mi noþ, &amp; bi Apolyn þe grete, Bi Ternagaunt, &amp; bi Mahoun þe swete, Bot we of hem be wreken swiþe, No worþ y neuer glad no bliþe, Bot we hem aseyle biginne, &amp; þe hille wiþ strengþe awinne. An hundred we ben o?ain hem on, &amp; al we schul hem nimen anon.’ Þe helden þai nimeþ about strongliche, &amp; þe Cristen aseyl stalworþliche At þe brode paþe &amp; narwe also; Þe Gregeys wele werd hem þo. On þe Cristen þai gun smite, Þe Sarrazins, boþe miche &amp; lite, &amp; our men hem werd wel Wiþ scharpe speres &amp; grounden stiel: Wiþ axes &amp; swerdes y-grounde, Wiþ gisarmes þai ?if deþes wounde. Þe soudan forþwiþ alder-farst On þe Cristen smot wel fast; On heye on helmes he hem smot Wiþ his fauchon þat wele bot. To?aines Gij he smot þo, &amp; seyd ‘war, ich-il þe slo!’ Gij he smot so ouer þuert, Þat he was sumdel y-hert; Ac Gij wiþ strengþe to him smot Wiþ his swerd þat wele bot. Wel strong was þat ich fi?t, Ac þe soudan wered him wiþ mi?t. Wharto schuld ich ?ou telle more? Þe Sarrazins ouer-comen wore: Wele haþ Gij don þat day, As gode kni?t &amp; verray. At a pas he houed ri?t, As a kni?t of gret mi?t; A gisarme he bar kerueinde, He smot bifore &amp; bi-hinde. Þe Sarra?ins so he agast, Al þat he smot to grounde he cast. His scheld he hadde forlore, To-hewe it lay his fet bifore. So mani Sarrazin he slou? þat day, Þat ich on oþer ded lay; So mani to ded þer he dede, Þat þe hepe lay to his girdel stede. Who so seye þan Herhaud fi?t, Of a gode kni?t ?elp he mi?t. A damsax he bar on his hond: Al þat he rau?t to grounde he wond; Sarrazins he slou? mo þan sexti, &amp; Gij an hundred &amp; fourti. Herhaud þat day so sore swong, Þat þurch his mouþe þe fom it sprong; Al to-hewe was his helme, Þe blod ran out als a welme. What schuld y make tale muche? Þe Sarrazins þai slowen strongliche; Ac euer he was gode, apli?t, Gij of Warwike michel of mi?t, More dede þan ani oþer: His stroke was heui so a foþer. Gij and his feren also Als lyouns þai fou?ten þo, &amp; the Gregeys forþ wiþ hem, Þai wered hem as douhti men. Weynes &amp; cartes þai han y-nome Mo þan fiften þousende atte frome. Y-ioined hij han þe gret piles, Ginnes þai made on selcouþe wise, Sum piles scharpe kerueinde, Al aboute so mani stondinde, Þat ich ne can þe noumbre telle, Noiþer in rime no in spelle. Þer nas man þat þer neye come, Þat he ne was to-corwen anon. So griseliche be þe engins, For to sle þe Sarrazines, In ich half y-sett arawe, Scharpe soules doun of þe hulle y-drawe. Þer-mid þai hewe þe gret stonis, Bi-hewe quarre for þe nonis, So gret so tventie men mi?t drawe, To slen hem of þe heþen lawe. Swiche a þousende for-smiten þai be, Þat neuer after schullen y-the; Wel iuel hem is bifallen þare, Ded þai ben wiþ sorwe &amp; care. Wharto schuld ich tale telle? Þe soudan lepe on hors ful snelle. Gret onde he hadde to Gyoun, &amp; to Herhaud, his compaynoun, For hij han slawe so fel of his. He sat on an hors of pris, Wiþ gret hete he smot to Gij, Opon his helme, sikerly, Þat he feld þat o quarter. To Gij he seyd a bismer: ‘Y-sestow, lord? bi Apolin, Þat was a strok of a Sarrazin!’ Gij to þe soudan smot þo, His helme no was him worþ a slo: Resares euen forþ þe breyn Helme &amp; flesse he carf wiþ meyn. Þan he seyd to him a bismer: ‘Mahoun halp þe litel þer! Bodi &amp; soule no nou?t þer-of No is nou?t worþ a lekes clof. Hou so it go of mi wounde, Of Mahoun þou hast litel help y-founde. Er þou scorndest me, Of mi wounde þou madest þi gle: Leche gode schal ich haue, Þat mi wounde schal to hele drawe; Þou hast a croun schauen to þe bon; Tomorwe þou mi?t sing anon. Wele þou þou?test to ben a prest, When þou of swiche a bischop order berst!’ Now biginneþ þat gret fi?t; Bi þre, bi four, adoun ri?t, Þe Sarrazins ben ouer-come, Oway fleinde þai ben some. Þe ni?t comeþ, þe day is go, Þe Sarrazins han ful michel wo; For so mani y-slawe þer be (So seyd þe folk of þat cuntre), Þat men mi?t wade ouer þe scho hem In þe blod þat of hem kem. So miche folk þer was y-slawe þo, Þat fiftene forlong men mi?t go, Þat þei he kept him neuer so, He most nedes opon men go, Oþer on fot, oþer on hond, Oþer opon arm coruen wiþ brond. Wiþ þat come an amiral prikeinge, Newe dubbed he was, wiþ-outen lesing; To þe soudan he is y-come, Þurch þe bodi he haþ woundes some. ‘Sir,’ he seyd, ‘hennes we go: No sestow al our folk slo? Bi þousendes þou sest hem to deþ ligge; Our godes ous hateþ, for soþe to sigge. Þou sest Mahoun ne Apolin Be nou?t worþ þe brestel of a swin. Anon ri?tes wiþdrawe þou þe, &amp; to þi pauiloun þou fle; Alle þe wounded þou do wiþ þe lede; ?ete þai may þe help &amp; rede. Þi rereban þou do of-sende; To awreke [þe] þou haue in mende.’ Anon þai hem wiþdrawe and ben ouer-come; Sori þai ben alle &amp; some. Þe soudan dede biforn him bring Alle his godes, wiþouten lesing: Toward hem he is wel wroþ, Do he wil hem harm &amp; loþ: ‘A ?e fals godes vnwreste! Sone ?ou tit a liþer feste. O?ain ous ?e ben of wicked mode: Schame ?e don ous &amp; no gode. ?e don ous alder-werst to spede When þat we han mest nede. Fy, fy,’ he seyd, ‘on [þe], Apolin! Þou schalt haue wel iuel fin, &amp; þou, Ternagaunt, also: Michel schame schal com ?ou to; &amp; þou, Mahoun, her alder lord, Þou nart nou?t worþ a tord! Þer-fore þou it schalt abigge Wiþ staues gret opon þi rigge.’ So he gan his godes to cloute, Þat þe erþe dined aboute. Her armes &amp; legges he to-ti?t, &amp; cleped hem wroches anon ri?t: ‘Godenes in ?ou nas neuer y-founde, No more mi?t þan in an hounde.’ Bi þe fet he hem out drou?, And dede hem schame ri?t anou?. Gij dede clepe her cheueteyn Wiþ gode will &amp; hert feyn: ‘Lordinges,’ he seyd, ‘godly-þonked be! Feir grace so habbe we, Þat þe Sarrazins ben ouercome. Wende we to þe cite atte frome.’ &amp; when þai ben comen o?en, To þemperour welcom þai ben, &amp; nameliche Gij, þe gode kni?t, Mest was worþschiped in þat fi?t. When þat y-seye Morgadour, Þat steward was wiþ þemperour, Þat Gij biwreyed vnwrastliche, Þat þemperour loued so miche, He bigan for to asay Hou he mi?t Gij bi-tray. O felonie he haþ him bi-þou?t; Of swiche no haue ?e herd nou?t: He þou?t in his wille þo, Þat Gij o message schuld go. In swiche þou?t &amp; swiche wille An while he held him stille; Anon he went to þemperour, &amp; seyd, ‘sir, par amour, Þe soudan haþ his folk y-sent: Into al peyni his sond is sent. Þer nis noiþer ?ing no eld Þat armes may bere &amp; wepen weld, Alle he is haueþ of-sent, Þe to bisege verrament. To him þou þi sond sende, Alle þi wille, word &amp; ende.’ ‘Who,’ he seyd, ‘durst þider wende?’ ‘Sir Gij, a kni?t hardi &amp; hende Of þine house, &amp; þat y plight: Gij of Warwike of gret mi?t, Herhaud of Arderne, þat oþer best: On hem tveye ?e mow ?ou trest. To þe soudan þou sende þine kni?tes bold, &amp; say þou wilt wiþ him a day hold Of acord in swiche manere.’ ‘Sir steward,’ seyd þemperere, ‘Toward Gij þou berst iuel wille: He no schal nou?t go; þerof be stille. Ac mine barouns ichil of-sende, &amp; wite who wille þider wende.’ His barouns he haþ of-sent: Ouer alle his lond þai ben y-went, Þat þai schuld to þemperour wende. To hem he seyd, ‘mi leue frende, Ich wold sende to the soudan, ?if ich wist euer bi wham. To him to sende ich am in wille, Wiþ him to acord loude oþer stille, ?if ani of ?ou so hardi were, Þat to him þe message bere.’ When þemperour had seyd his resoun, Þer nas noiþer kni?t no baroun Þat him a word answerd þo: Nas þer non þe message durst do. A baroun of þe benche aros: Sir Tristor his name was. ‘Sir emperour, vnder-stond me, For leyer no schal ich holden be; For ich it sigge for gret loue, &amp; þine worþschipe to held aboue: Fif thousende siþe haue he maugre Þat þe conseyl ?af to þe! For he þe loueþ ri?t nou?t Þat in þat wille þe haþ y-brou?t, Þat þou to him ?elde scholdest, Bot þou þi sonde sende woldest. No þenkestow nou?t of þat baroun Þat was of so gret renoun, Hou þou sendest him to? O?ain no come he neuer mo. He þe sent þe heued wiþ-outen more, No durst neuer eft non com þore; In þe world is kni?t non Þat þe message durst don. For arwe no sigge ich it no-wi?t: ?if in min armes were so gret mi?t Also ich hadde, &amp; as ?ong were As ich was hennes an hundred ?ere, Þis ich message don ich wold, For drede of deþ lete y nold. Ac icham now a neld man, Alle mine mi?tes ben now gan; It is now gon mo þan fifti ?er Þat ich on rigge hauberk ber. Ich ?ou sigge for soþe y-wis, To lese a good man gret harm it is, For ?if he ani sendeþ þider, His heued him schal comen hider. Now ich haue mi wille y-sede; Now ?iue anoþer better rede.’ When Tristor hadde y-seyd þis, Wiþ-outen ani oþer abod y-wis, Þer nas nou?t on, litel no miche, Þat durst speke sikerliche. Gij of Warwike vp arist: ‘Sir emperour, bi mi Lord Iesu Crist, Þis message ichil afo, &amp; it þurch godes help do.’ Seyd þemperour, ‘þat schaltow nou?t: Þider to go haue þou no þou?t; Ich it dede mine men to fond, To whom ich mi?t trust in mi lond.’ Þan answerd Gij wel snelle, ‘For soþe, sir, leten y nille, Þat ich þe message wil do, To dye er ich þennes go.’ Wiþ þat he went out of þe halle. Þe Gregeys siked among hem alle, ‘God! what Gij is noble baroun! Iesu, þat suffred passioun, Saue him fram cumberment, &amp; him o?ain bring in sauement.’ Gij cam to his in in a stounde, His felawes droupeing he founde. ‘Lordinges,’ he seyd, ‘hou is it now? Almi?ti god y bi-teche ?ou.’ ‘Sir,’ quaþ Herhaud, ‘ich-il go Bi þine wille wiþ þe also.’ Gij answerd, ‘so no schal it be. Icham y-go: biddeþ for me.’ He oxed his armes hastiliche, And men es him brou?t sikerliche. Hosen of iren he haþ on drawe, Non better nar bi þo dawe. In a strong hauberk he gan him schrede, Who so it wered, þe ded no þurt him drede. An helme he haþ on him don: Better no wered neuer kni?t non; The sercle of gold þer-on was wrou?t, For half a cite no worþ it bou?t: So mani stones þer-in were, Þat were of vertu swiþe dere. Seþþe he gert him wiþ a brond Þat was y-made in eluene lond. His scheld about his nek he tok, On hors he lepe wiþ-outen stirop, On hond he nam a spere kerueinde, Out of þe cite he was rideinde. Alle þat weren of þat cite For him wel sori weren he; No wene þai neuer his ?ain-cominge, Alle þai wene þer his endinge. Now is Gij in þe ri?t way Toward þe Sarrazins, y say, Wele y-armed on his stede, A launce he bar gode at nede.

Þat was þe soudans pauiloun: Haue he Cristes malisoun! In-to þe pauiloun Gij him wond, &amp; an hast þer he fond Alle atte mete þat þer was, &amp; nou?t michel noise þer nas. At þe heye bord eten kinges ten, Þat alle were Gyes fomen.

Sir Gij to þemperour y-comen is, Þe heued he him ?alt, y-wis: Þemperour gret þanke him can, &amp; in þat cite he doþ make onan A piler of gray marbel ston: Þat heued he sett anon þer-on. In swiche wise deuised it was, Þat it was biwreyen in bras, Whar-þurch þat oþer mi?t ben war To come wiþ ani ost more þar. Þan Gij hadde y-don so Þemperour cleped Gij him to: ‘Welcome be þou to me, sir Gij! Hennes for dayes þritti Michel monschip ichil þe do, Mi feir douhter ?iue þe to.’ To þemperour onswerd sir Gij, ‘An hundred siþe, sir, gramerci!’ Þemperour aros amorwe þo, To sen þe cuntre þai ben y-go; Alle þat day þai riden hem so Alle what euen, þai rested hem þo. Þai seye toward a pleyn plas Þat bisiden a doun was. A lyoun þai seye cominde þo, Bot a smal pas no mi?t he go, Wiþ ?enende mouþe, &amp; weri he was. Gij þat seye &amp; seyd, ‘allas!

What schuld y make tales mo? He smot of þe heued, &amp; went oway, &amp; come to þemperour so sone so he may, Gyoun, wiþ ri?t gode wille: Þe lyoun after him folweþ snelle. Biforn him he goþ swiþe sket, &amp; folwed him at his stede fet. His fet he licked, so ?ede he neye, &amp; lepe vp on his stede an heye, &amp; seþþe he lepe adoun anon, &amp; made him gret joie opon. To þemperour is comen Gij, Þat of him was glad, sikerli. Alle þai bihelden þe lyoun, &amp; hadde gret joie bot þe feloun, Morgadour þe steward, Þat euer was Gij o?einward. A liþer tresoun þan þou?t he, Þat he wold þe lyoun sle. Wiþ þat into þe cite þai ben y-gon; Þemperour went vnto his tour of ston, &amp; Gij is to his in y-go: Þe lyoun him folwed euer mo. Biforn his bed he goþ to ligge, Fram him he nold, for soþe to sigge. So long þai riden her jurneys, And þurch riden þe cuntreys, Þat to Costentin þai ben y-come. Þemperour haþ Gij on speche y-nome, &amp; seyd, ‘Gij, make þe redi: Tomorwe þou schalt mi douhter weddi.’ Wel sweteliche him answerd sir Gij, ‘Sir emperour, mow gramerci!’ Amorwe, so sone so it was day, Gij him schred in fou &amp; gray; Wiþ him his felawes also, To chirche þai gon euer to &amp; to. Wiþ þat þai ben to chirche y-come Worþschiplich alle &amp; some, &amp; þat maiden was also; Gret joie hadde al her kin þo. Þe erchebischop was comen also, Redi þe spouseing for to do. Þemperour seyd to Gij þere: ‘Mi douhter ich ?iue þe here, And þritti castels wiþ hir also, Wiþ þe worþschip þat liþ þer-to, And half mi lond ich ?iue þe, Bifor mi barouns þat here be.

Gij fel aswoning in þat plas, &amp; aros vp sone after þas; Gij seyd an heye to þemperour: ‘Sir, y þe pray paramour, Þat þis fest deleyed be Fort efsones, y bidde þe, Þat ich am apassed þis hache, &amp; þat ich in gode hele be.’ Quaþ þemperour, ‘þat reweþ me, Þis sposayl schal delayed be.’ Þennes hij gon alle y-fere, Alle sone wiþ droupeand chere. Þat maiden wepe &amp; was sori, For Gij no mi?t hir spousi, For neuer more hij no wende Wiþ loue com him hende; No ioie ne may comen hir inne, For hij no wende him neuer winne. Sche wrong hir honden &amp; wepe sore, Sorwe made neuer wiman more; Sche wrong hir fingres &amp; tar hir here, &amp; curssed þe time þat moder hir ber, &amp; þe time þat hye bi?eten was; Neuer woman wers nas. Gij is to his in y-go, No wist noman of his wo Bot him self: bi ni?t and day Al a fourten ni?t sike he lay, Þat he no com his bed fram, No out atte dore he no cam. Now wille we of Gij duelle, &amp; of his lyoun ichil ?ou telle; Of his lyoun, hou he fard: Þer while þat Gij lay sike so hard Nold he noiþer ete no drink, Ac sorwe he made and gret morning. Gij cleped Herhaud him to, &amp; alle his conseyl schewed him þo. ‘Sir Herhaud,’ he seyd, ‘conseyl me: Of mi conseyl ich oxi þe, ?if y schal þemperours douhter take, Or ?ete abide forþ &amp; hir for-sake. Ich haue a leman in Inglond (To telle þe nil y nou?t wond), Þerls douhter Rohaut y-wis, Felice, þat feir maiden of pris. Oþer þan hir loue y no may, Sir Herhaud, for soþe to say.’ Herhaud onswerd: ‘ichil ?ou telle Þe best conseyl ich haue in wille. ?if þou þemperours douhter afo Riche þou best euer mo: After him þou best emperour.

More riches þe worþ bi a þousandel Boþe of cites &amp; of riche castel, Forestes ful of hertes beld, Þan þerl Rohaut haþ in weld.’ ‘Stille be þou,’ quaþ Gij, ‘of þat þou?t. Now ich wot þou louest me nou?t, When þou conseyls me mi leman fro. Mi liif to lese, nil ich it do.’ ‘Sir,’ quaþ Herhaud, ‘ich-il be stille, When it is o?ain þi wille.

When þou Felice loues so, Vn-ri?t it were &amp; þou hir for-go.’ Gij aros after þe fourtenni?t Glad &amp; bliþe wiþ hert li?t. He is to þe court y-come, &amp; ful welcome to alle &amp; some. Wiþ him his lyoun to court ?e[de] þo, Þurch whom aros gret sorwe &amp; wo. Þemperour of Gij wel bliþe he was; Into al þe court no noþer þer nas Al bot Morgadour, sikerliche: He hated Gij wel inliche. For þe maiden he hadde Gij in hete. Gij bileft in court atte mete, Him to play &amp; solanci. Þo at þe court bileft sir Gij, Þer whiles þe king ate mete sat, Þe lyoun goþ to play wiþ-outen þe ?at In pais wiþ-outen vilanie. Herkeneþ now, lordinges, gladli: When þemperour hadde y-hete, Gode while Gij haþ bi him sete, Wiþ him to pley in compeynie: Solas he loued wiþouten vilanie. Þat ich while his lyoun ?ede out of þe pauiloun: Al abouten he is y-go, For to resten him in a wro: O?ain þe sonne he slepe in a stede, Gret while of þe day &amp; so he dede. When Gij wold his way he nam, Vnto his in þat he cam. Þe lyoun no folwed him nou?t, In an erber he slepe wel soft. Þan was þe steward goinde, In-to an orchard al-on cominde. Vnder a windowe he him seye Wher þe lyoun lay wel neye, For to resten him in a wro. ‘Bi god,’ quaþ þe steward þo, ‘Þe lyoun liþ here now slepeing,’ Seyd Morgadour in his þou?t þenking.

To Gyes in he is y-go, In a chaumber he fond him þo: At his fete he fel doun in þat stede, To hauen of him socour at nede. His hondes he gan to licky: Þat was his loue, sikerly. When Gij þat lyoun wounded seþ, For sorwe him þou?t his hert clef. ‘O lord,’ he seyd, ‘god almi?t, Who haþ þe so iuel y-di?t? Þat mi lyoun haþ y-slawe me, Y nold it wer don for þis cite, No þat þer-to bilonge. So michel sorwe me haþ afong.’ In swiche wretþe &amp; grame anou?

Wele hij seyen bi his lokeing Þat he is sori &amp; swiþe wroþ: Alle o?aines him þai goþ. ‘Lordinges,’ quaþ Gij, ‘ich ?ou biseche, ?if ani of ?ou me can teche, Who slou? mi lyoun to-day.’ Alle þai seyd, ‘sir, certes, nay.’ Wiþ þat into þe halle he come, A maiden he mett þer anon. ‘Sir Gij,’ she seyd, ‘leue swete, Is þi lyoun ded, or liues ?ete? For þurchout smite ichim seye.’ Þo seyd Gij: ‘mi swete lef, ney, Ich þe bidde, for-hele it nou?t, Who haþ mi lyoun to deþ y-brou?t?’ ‘Sir,’ sche seyd, ‘Morgadour, Þat is steward wiþ þemperour: Þurch þe bodi he him smot.

Whi berstow me on treysoun, Þat ich haue sleyn þi lioun?’ Gij wiþ his kniif smite he wold, Ac Gij him suffri nold: His swerd anon vp he hef, Morgadour doun ri?t he clef Fram þe heued doun to þe fot: Of þat stroke no com him neuer bot. When his nevou y-seye þat cas, Þat his em so smiten was, Him to awreke him þou?t long, &amp; as he schuld his dart afong, His arme atvo smot Gij, &amp; he him anon crid merci.

Whende ichil in-to mi cuntre, Mine frendes to visite &amp; to se.’ Leue he toke wiþ þat speche, &amp; seyd, ‘godes sone y þe biteche.’ When þemperour wiþ-holden him no may (He seþ his wille is to wende o-way), Wepen he gan wiþ his ey?en tvo: Alle þo of þe court dede al-so. His grete tresour he dede forþ bring, &amp; bede it Gij to his likeing, Ac þerof liked him nou?t to take: Anou? he hadde of Sarrazins blake. Al-so a gode man dede þemperour þere: Þer-after to alle Gyes fere Riche tresour þan ?af he, Gold and siluer gret plente, As miche as þai wold vnder-fo; For þemperour it comend so. Gret [pris] þai ?eue þemperour, Þat he was man of gret honour. Gij di?t him wiþ riche dubbeing, Riche wede he dede for him bring. Of þemperour he toke his leue, &amp; he al wepend it him ?eue, &amp; alle þe kni?tes of the cite, Of euerichon leue nam he. Þer mi?t men se sorwe make, For sir Gij wold fram hem rake; Wimen &amp; children mani on, For him þai wepen euerichon: Þer whiles he was in her ferred, Of no wer no stode hem drede. Þemperour cleped Herbaud him to, &amp; aresound him tvene hem tvo: ‘Sir Herhaud, þou schalt bileue wiþ me. Wele ich þe sigge, &amp; siker þou be, Þat ich in þis ?ere wille ?iue þe Þe richest honour þat in mi lond be.’ ‘Sir,’ quaþ Herhaud, ‘gramerci! Wele ?e wite icham wiþ sir Gij.

Y sett hir on a mule amblinde, In þe way we dede ous rideinde. Ac þer ich dede gret child-hod, Þat alto long y þer a-bod. At our wending of þat cite Þe li?t day we mi?ten se: Þer we were y-knowen þo At a brigge as we hadde go. Þat ich for Oisel was y-come, Hir fader it was teld atte frome. Þurch þe cite þe crie was gradde Þe maiden was oway ladde. Þer mi?t men se kni?tes on hors wende, &amp; me þai of-token at þe brugge ende. Þer we stronglich mett wiþ hem: Mani we slowen of her men. Alle þai slou? mine feren, Þat swiþe gode kni?tes weren. Me þai come to nim snelle, Ac y nold no longer duelle: Ich toke mi leman on mi stede, &amp; ouer þat water wiþ hir ich ?ede. Alle þat day þai driuen me, Alle fort þai no mi?t for ni?t y-se. When y was passed þe riuer ari?t In hert y was glad &amp; li?t: Þat water passi þai no durstin, Þan owayward turn þai mostin. In þis forest y come rideinde, Bifor me mi leman ledeinde: Y no dred robours no thef non, Ac al siker ich wende forþ gon. What of wakeing, &amp; of fasting, &amp; eke þat oþer treueyling, Osleped swiþe sore ich was, &amp; lay &amp; slepe in þis plas. Þan com fiftene outlawes strong Wiþ her men, &amp; here me afong.

To þat hulle þou wende anon: Þou hem findes þer ichon. &amp; ?if þat þou so mi?ti be, Þatow may hem alle sle, Winne þou mi?t a maiden fre: In þe warld may non feirer be. &amp; ?ete y may þe more telle: Mi stede þai han, þat is so snelle, Þat wiþ strengþe in Peyneme ich wan Of Solagimis, þe sone soudan. Þer-fore men han y-boden me .Xv. castels, &amp; touns, &amp; riche cite, And .xv. somers of siluer &amp; of gold, Ac for an hundred ?iuen ichit nold. Now þou hast, sir, alle y-herd, Hou ich am bitreyd &amp; amerd.

Grete pite he haþ of þat kni?t: He knewe Tirri for his frende, Þat lay þer in hard bende. ‘Sir,’ he seyd, ‘bi treuþe mine Þat ich haue pli?t in hond þine, Euen forþ mi mi?t ich-il help þe: More mi?t þou nou?t oxi me.’ Wiþ þat haþ Gij his brond y-nome, &amp; his hauberk atte frome, His scheld, &amp; his oþer wede, &amp; to þe hulle in gret periil he ?ede. A loge stonden þer he seye, &amp; þer wiþ-outen a gode stede &amp; heye, Þat was to a bou? y-teyd. Gij þeron his talent leyd: Sterneliche prikeing he come, His swerd he drou? out anon. He ali?t, &amp; seyd at his cominge: ‘Þeues, ?e be ded, wiþouten lesinge. Awarid worþ ?e ichon, Boþe ?our flessche &amp; ?our bon. Whi slou? ?e þat ich kni?t?

Ar ani of hem hem were mi?t, Alle he hem slou?, y ?ou pli?t. Þo he hadde hem slaun ichon, He lepe opon his stede anon. Comen he is to þat mayde, Wel sweteliche to hir he seyde, ‘Na more sori þou no be, Ac arise vp, &amp; com wiþ me: To þi leman y bringe þe sket Vnder þe þorn þer þou him let.’ Opon a mule sche warþ anon, To þe hawe-þorn þai ben y-gon, Ac þai no haue nou?t þe kni?t y-founde: Y-ladde he was owai þat stounde. Þo he fond him nou?t, he was sori; For he wend wel sikerli Þat lyouns him hadde to-drawe. He loked adoun vnder þe wode schawe, If he ou?t y-herd loude or heye: Of hors traces hy þer seye. Þat maiden he lete þare, &amp; after swiþe he is y-fare. So fast he rode, þat he com neye Four kni?tes he þer seye. Gij of-toke sone þat ferrede, &amp; seye þan kn[i]?t wiþ hem lede. Gij, þat heye rode on his stede, ?ernne he bad ?if he mi?t spede. To þe kni?tes sir Gij him sade: ‘Lordinges, þilke lord þat ?ou made, &amp; þe ni?t &amp; þe bri?t day, ?ou do worþschipe so wele he may. ?if it be ?our wille speke wiþ me: To mi speche vnder-stond ?e.

Al for loue ich ?ou biseche His bodi þat ?e me biteche.’ Þat o kni?t went to him ward, Þat was þe douke Otus steward, Þat hadde y-passed þe riuere In a bot þat he fond þere, &amp; seyd to Gij, ‘who artow? Als a fole comen artow now. Comestow now to aski ri?t To haue þe bodi of our kni?t, For his fere we nim þe snelle, To þe douke Otous lede we þe wille, &amp; ?e schul boþe demed be, &amp; heye hong on galwe tre.’ Gij him seyd, ‘þou miseyst, &amp;, bi mine heued, þou it abeyst.’ Opon þe heued Gij him smot, Vnto þe girdel stede þat swerd bot. Anoþer he smot ri?t anon, Spare nold [he] neuer on. Of his hors he has him feld, His heued he dede fleye in þe feld. Wiþ þat come þe gode Hogoun, Þe doukes nevou Otoun: He smot Gij on þe scheld bifore, Þat neye he haþ his swerd forlore. For schame he hadde of þe stroke þare Gij smot Hogoun, and nou?t him for-bare: Ouer-þuert þat swerd glod, &amp; to-clef him wiþouten abod. Wharto schuld y make tale of nou?t? Alle he haþ hem to deþ y-brou?t. He nam Tirri in his armes anon, &amp; sett him his hors opon. To þat hawe-þorn he is y-fare, Þan fond he nou?t þat maiden þare. Lete we now of Gij be stille: More ?e schul here ?if ?e wille Of þat maiden, hou sche was nome: Þan schal we til our tale come. Of Gyes felawes y wille ?ou telle So y finde in mi spelle, Þat so long were in þe cite, Wonder hem þenkeþ where Gij be; For þe mete was alle ?are, Wonder hem þou?t wer Gij ware. Herhaud of Ardern &amp; oþer mo In-to þe forest þai ben y-go: Þai mi?t [him] finde for no secheing. Herhaud cast sone his lokeing: Biside him he herd a mening, Also it were a woman schricheing. Hye bi-gan loude to grede: Herhaud ney?ed &amp; his ferrede. Þe haweþorn þai ?ede wel neye, &amp; þe maiden þer þai seye. Herhaud hir oxed what hij was; Sche no told him nou?t al her cas, Bot þat sche was a wriche wiman Þat michel sorwe so was an; For alle þat sorwe þan hade he, For sche no mi?t hir leman se. Sche forbede him anon ri?t Þat noman sett on hir si?t. Herhaud tok þat mayde wiþ him, &amp; ladde hir hom to his in. Now wende we o?ain to our spelle, Þat ?e me herd er þan telle Of Gij and Tirri, þerls sone, Hou þai ben to þe hawe-þorn come. When hij þider y-comen were, No fond hij nou?t þe maiden þere. Gij bileft þer sir Tirri, &amp; sou?t þat maiden bi &amp; bi: Op and doun he ?ede hir secheinde, &amp; sorwefulliche hir bimeninde. He wende sche were stole wiþ outlawe, Oþer wiþ wilde bestes y-drawe. For hir in hert him was ful wo, Þat he no wist what to do: No wist he what do he mi?t, To þe cite he went anon ri?t; When he hir finde no may, Homward he most take þe way. Þan toke he þat kni?t: On his stede nek he sett him ri?t. Y-comen he is to þe cite: His men al sori findeþ he, &amp;, when hij her lord seye come, Bliþe þai were alle &amp; some. ‘Lordinges,’ he seyd, ‘nimeþ þis bodi, &amp; to þe grounde it lay wel softli.’ Þe bodi þai toke of þat kni?t, Opon a pal leyd it anon ri?t. Gij haþ of-sent leches þere, Þe wisest þat in þat cite were. ‘Lordinges,’ he seyd, ‘vnderstond to me. ?if ?e þis kni?t þat ?e here se, May on him his woundes hele, It worþ ?ou ?olden eueridele. ?if he dede or liues be, Ich bi-hot ?ou, min frende fre, Him to hele ?our mi?t ?e do: An hundred besaunce y ?if þer-to.’ Þai groped his veynes &amp; his wounde, Þai feld hem boþe hole &amp; sounde: Wele hii seþ he nis nou?t dede. Þe leches taken hem to rede, In forward hele him þai wille, In non maner lete þai nille. Þerwhiles of-herd sir Gij Noise, &amp; wepe, &amp; wel gret crie. His chaumberleyn he cleped him to, &amp; alle in wretþe he oxed him þo Who it was þat noise made. ‘Bid hem alle be bliþe &amp; glade.’ ‘Sir,’ he seyd, ‘a maiden it is Þat Herhaud fond, wel feir, y-wis, Vnder an hawe-þorn in þe forest.’ Quaþ Gij, ‘fete hir to me in hast, Swiþe þat ich mi?t hir se. Now hastiliche bringeþ hir to me.’ Þe chaumberleyn is forþ y-gon, &amp; brou?t hir bi-forn hem anon. Gij hir knewe, &amp; gan hir gret, ‘Welcome be þou, mi lef swete,’ As sche was into þe halle y-come, Wepeinde &amp; sorwende vnder-nome. Wiþ þat hij seye þat bodi, y-wis, Liggend on a pal of pris. ‘A, leman Tirri,’ quaþ sche þo, ‘What, y se þi neb al blo, Þat so white of colour was: Þi better neuer y-born nas. In wroched time mi bodi þou say, When þou schalt for me day. Dye ich-il forþ wiþ þe: For sorwe liues no may y be. Bot y may dye ichil me quelle: Leng to libbe is nou?t mi wille. Seþþen þou hast þi deþ for me, For soþe dye ich-il for þe.’ When sche seye Tirri, hir leman, Ouer him sche fel aswon onan. Gij hir in his armes nam, &amp; seyd to hir, ‘mi leue leman, No make þou nou?t sorwe so miche: Þi leman worþ hole hastiliche.’ In þat cite þai bi-leued þere What Tirry was hole &amp; fere. To þe wode þai ben y-go: Miche loue was bitven hem to. On a day, as þai com fram hunting, Gij seyd to Tirry, wiþ-outen lesing: ‘Ich wil þat we be treuþe-pli?t &amp; sworn breþer anon ri?t. Tirri,’ seyd to sir Gyoun, ‘Vnder-stond now to mi resoun, Þat noiþer oþer after þis No faile oþer while he liues is.’ Wiþ þat answerd þerl Tirri, &amp; seyd, ‘wel bleþelich, sir Gij. Now þou louest so miche me, Þat tow mi sworn broþer wil be, No wille ich neuer feyle þe For nou?t þat mai bi-falle me. Gret worþschip þou hast don me: God leue me ?ete þan day y-se Þat ichit þe mow wele ?eld. For gode baroun þou art y-held; Fram deþ þou hast y-warist me; Wel gret wrong it schuld be Bot ich þe loued as mi lord fre. Wel gret worþschip ich ou?t bere þe.’ Treuþe bitven hem is pli?t, &amp; after kist anon ri?t. Seþþen þai went in-to þe cite Wiþ ioye &amp; mirþe, gamen &amp; gle. Now Gij him makeþ him alle ?are Into Inglond for to fare. Tirri he wald lede wiþ him þo &amp; Oysel, his leman, þat he loued so. To þe king þai wold hem aqueynti, &amp; gode þrowe wiþ him soiornni. Biteche he him wille his castels alle, So he him biþou?t, ?if it mi?t falle. It was opon a somers day, Gij out at a windowe lay. To Tirri he spac of her fare, Of her wele &amp; of her care. Wiþ þat com prikeing anon ri?t A kni?t: he semed wele, apli?t, Wele he semed he treuaild were. Gij anon clept to him þere: ‘Sir kni?t,’ he seyd, ‘whennes comestow? &amp; what þou sechest telle me now.’ Þe kni?t answerd, ‘ich-il þe telle, &amp; nou?t þerof ley?en y nille. Tirri of Gurmoise y go secheinde, Þerl sone Aubri wele doinde. In mani londes ich haue him sou?t.’ ‘Wharto?’ quaþ Gij, ‘hele it nou?t.’ ‘Sir,’ quaþ he, ‘y telle þe sone Of a gret sorwe, þat is y-done. Tirri serued þe douke Loyere: Þe douke him loued, and held him dere, &amp; ?af him armes wiþ gret honour: Kni?t he bicome of gret valour. Þe douke hadde a feir douhter for þe meistri, Þat was y-?ouen to þe douke of Paui: Tirri hir loued &amp; oway ladde, Whar-þurch mani man þe deþ hadde. Wiþ strengþe him folwed kni?tes bliue: Y not wher he be ?ete oliue. Þe douke Loyer biþou?t him þo Opon his fader for to go. Þe douke Loyer wiþ him ladde Þe douke of Paui þider he hadde Wiþ his gode cheualrie, Þe best of al Lombardye. In Gormoise þerl bisett han he, And destrud alle his cuntre. Bot god me leue Tirri finde, Þat he be his fader helpinde, Al his lond him tit for-go: No schal he it o?ain win neuer mo. His fader no may armes weld, No no lenge help himself for eld.’ ‘Sir kni?t,’ þan seyd sir Gij, ‘Her wiþ ous þou schalt herberwei, &amp; of þerl Tirri telle y þe ?if ich ou?t can, mi frende fre.’ ‘Gramerci, sir,’ þan seyd he. ‘Of him to here leue war me.’ Gij hete his folk hastiliche Þat hye him vnder-feng curteysliche. ‘Ich-il þe telle,’ quaþ sir Gij, ‘Þat y can of þerl Tirri.’ When þai hadde d[r]onken in þe halle, &amp; glad þai were, y telle ?ou, alle, Þan seyd þerl Tirri: ‘For loue y bidde þe, sir Gij, O?ain to mi cuntre com wiþ me, Als-so we sworn breþer be, Mi fader to help þat we spede; For of help he haþ gret nede.’ ‘Be stille,’ seyd Gij, ‘what seystow me? Þat day to god vnworþi y be, ?if y, sir Tirri, feyle þe, Þerwhiles þat ich haue liif in me.’ ‘Sir Gij,’ he seyd, ‘gramerci: Þilke y sigge þe, sikerly.’ Now sendeþ Gij after kni?tes snelle, Almaines swiþe &amp; of gode wille To him þer come gret plente: Er þe twenti day y-comen be, Fif hundred kni?tes hardi &amp; hende To Tirri come for his frende, &amp; seyd to Tirri, ‘to þi fader we wil gon: Wele we it au?t to don; Wel redi we ben ichon.’ So long þai han forþ y-gon, Y-comen þai ben to Gormoise. In þat cite was gret noise. In an euening þai com to þe cite, Þat hye wiþ-outen aperceiued nar he. Wel glad him was þerl Aubri Of the cominge of his sone Tirri, &amp; of sir Gyes coming, Þat gode kni?t was, wiþ-outen lesing. Her ey?en watred for gladnesse, Alle þai ?ede o?ain him to kisse. ‘Leue fader,’ seyd sir Tirri, ‘Worþschip wele now sir Gij: Felawes we ben treuþe-y-pli?t. Y wil þat ?e it wite now ri?t: Fram deþ he haþ y-heled me.’ Quaþ þerl: ‘god y-þonked mot it be.

A wel eld man ich am, y-wis: Þat y bar armes tventi ?er it is; Y-lorn ich haue cheualrie: Of mi lond haue þou þe meistrie.’ Þan y-herberwed weren he Worþschipliche in þat cite. In þe cite gret noise is made: Of þe barouns com þai ben wel glade. Þer-in is now þerl Aubri, So is sir Gij &amp; sir Tirri. An arnmorwe aros sir Gij, &amp; cleped to him his compeynie. Bifor þerl þan þai ferden, &amp; a gret crie þai herden Of þe barouns of þe cite. Anon oxed Gij þe fre Of þat noise what it was. A squier told him al þat cas: ‘Þe douke steward Loyer For present he comeþ to iusti here ?if he finde wiþ whom to do, Þat ani kni?t durst cum him to.’ Sir Gij answer[d], ‘?if y may Þerof him worþ his fille to day.

In Herhaud &amp; in me trist also. We wil abide in þis cite, In þi nede we schul socour þe.’ Tirri nimeþ wiþ him kni?tes To hundred armed in fi?tes. Out of þe cite he nam his way, Mani scheld he to-drof þat day. Tirri smot wiþ gret mi?t Opon þe helmes, þat schine bri?t. Þan seyd Herhaud, ‘leue sir Gij, Sestow now þe gode erl Tirri? Of grete valour now so is he: His better wot y non bot te. Him to socour we au?t to go.’ Gij him answerd, ‘we schul so.’ Forþ þai ?ede wiþ gode welle: Þe lordinges hij astounded snelle. Wiþ þat com forþ sir Gij, In his hond his swerd blodi. Wel heteliche he smot a kni?t, His bodi he clef adoun ri?t. Anoþer kni?t he smot anon, Þat ded he feld him on þe ston. Sir Gij him smot to Gayer, Þat was þe doukes nevou Loyer: Of his hors he haþ him feld Þurch Tirries help in þe feld. For he smot his felawe, In þe sond he haþ him slawe.

Als Gij com fro chirche go, Into a pleyne he loked þo: He seye þe doukes ost was neye: So mani kni?tes þer he seye. Þan þerl Tirri he cleped him to, &amp; to him wi?tliche spac þo: ‘Sir erl,’ he seyd, ‘what schal we do?

Y no may him loue, he is mi fo: Gret wille me comeþ o?ain him go.’ Þerl seyd, ‘arme we ous euerichon: A þousend kni?tes schul wiþ ous gon.’ Gij him mett wiþ þerl Iordan, Lord he was of alle Melan. Hastiliche he haþ him mett, &amp; at a diche him bisett. He smot him on þe helme bri?t, A quarter of his helme doun ri?t. Þan seyd þe treytour, ‘glotoun, Dye þou schalt wiþ resoun: Ich þe abie in þis stede.’ Herhaud anon to him sede: ‘Þou lexst,’ he seyd, ‘vile losaniour: Þou it abist, bi seyn Sauour.’ Herhaud a strok him rau?t Opon his scheld wiþ gret mau?t: On þe helme þat strok glod, &amp; fel on þe stede þat he on rode. So he mett him in þat stede, Þat his stede knewele he dede. Vp stirt þe stede þat was snelle: Þan come þer bi an hongend hille Þe mi?ti and þe hardi Gyoun: In his hond he bar a trounsoun.

Acorded we ben of þat dede, &amp; for?euen al hatrede.’ Þan haþ þe douke y-kist Tirri For gret traisoun, &amp; nou?t freli.

Þan seyd to Loer þerl Aubri: ‘Þe ich biteche mi sone Tirri. Alder-first Iesu heuen king &amp; þe y biteche mi ?ongling. No may ich for eld trauaily: Hom ichil wende now an hye.’ He bitau?t hem god &amp; gode day, He lete hem þar, &amp; went his way.

In a pleyne þai li?ten hem snelle, Þer þai wald resten &amp; duelle. When þai ali?t þe kni?tes fre, Alle þai wende y-nomen to be. Þan seyd Otus of Paui: ‘Herkeneþ to me, al mi compeynie, Þe Loreins &amp; þe Lombardes ichon, Alle þat in our side riden &amp; gon: Bi þe rede of þe douke Loer Ichot boþe kni?t &amp; squier Þat ?e Gij, Herhaud, &amp; Tirri binde Fast her hondes hem bi-hinde.

Wiþ þat stirt forþ anon ri?t Otus cossyn, an vnwrast kni?t. Gij bi his mantel he drou? so, Þat þe tassels brosten ato. Þan seyd a Tya[y]s to a Lombard: ‘Now is Gij of Warwike a couward. Lo, now he no haþ no mi?t: Lorn he haþ contenaunce, apli?t.’ Wiþ þat þai speken hem þus bitven, Gij seye it mi?t no noþer ben: To him þat him held turned he, And ?af him swiche benedicite, Þat he brak his nek ato. Alle þe oþer on him þresten þo. Þe mantel þat he had opon To cloutes it was drawen anon, So þat ichon oway bar An pece of his mantel þar. Gij werd him fast in þat sturbing: Now helpe him Iesu heuen king. Smer[t]liche þai gun him asaily: He werd him as a kni?t hardy, So þat he ney?ed his stede; For to him he hadde nede. Wiþouten stirop he lepe þer-on: Mani on he made þat liif forgon. When þe douk Otus þat y-seye, Þat Gij on his hors oway fleye, Anon he seyd to his kni?tes: ‘Now to hors wiþ alle ?our mi?tes; For, ?if he passe ous in þis biker, Of mi liif am y nou?t siker; &amp; þerfore nimeþ him anon Als ?e wil haue mi loue ichon. Bot ?e bring him me to, We ben y-schent for euer mo.’ An hors þai lopen þan on hast, And driuen Gij swiþe fast, &amp; Gij no hadde wepen non: Wold god of heuen, þat made man, Þat he hadde his brond kerueing! He no hadde þer no frende him helping. Bi þat o side oway he ginneþ fle; Bot god of him haue pite, Þer he worþ y-slawe anon: Alle abouten him þai ben y-gon. Wiþ þat þer come rideing a kni?t, About his swere his scheld bri?t, &amp; wiþ a spere opon his hond: Toward Gij wel swiþe he wond, &amp; þurch þe bodi smite him wold, Ac god of heuen it suffre nold: Þe strok of þe spere it gan glide Bitven þe arsoun &amp; his side.

Wiþ þat sir Gij forþ him di?t, Ac he mett wiþ anoþer kni?t: Swerd he bar þat wele wald bite, In þe heued he wald Gij smite. Þe strok opon his hors glod Opon þe croupe a fot brod. Þei he war aferd no wonder nas: Gij ferd fram him a fast pas. He seye wiþ þat a grom cominde, To him ward fast erninge: A gret soule in his hond he bar, So wold god þat it war. Gij wel feir him bisou?t ?if him þe staf þat he brou?t. ‘Ichil ?eld it þe ful wel.’ ‘Haue here, sir, bi seyn Mi?hel. Wele ich þi gret nede se: Now god fram schame kepe þe.’ He tok þat soule in his hond, Anon forþ to hem he wond. A Lombard wel sone he mett, And wiþ þe soule so him grett, Þat ded he feld him anon. He tok his hors, &amp; gan to gon, &amp; seyd to þe grom þo: ‘Þou nim þis hors, &amp; gin to go. Wiþ gode wille y ?iue it þe For þe staf þou lentest me.’ Þe knaue him þonked bliue, Oway wiþ þe hors he gan to driue. Þan went forþ Gij þe gode, Nas neuer man of his mode Þat better him werd in his ende. Er he out of þat fi?t gan wende ?ete he slou? on of her felawe. In lasse while he hadde [him] y-slawe, Þen men schold sigge a pater-noster. Y telle it ?ou bi Peter þe apostel Þat neuer swiche nas y-seye non. When he haþ ouer-comen ichon Wel long he werþ him þat day.

To Paui ichil now gon, &amp; spouse þi douhter anon: Riche bridal ichil maki. Wiþ me schal Herhaud &amp; Tirri; Þer þai schul be don in prisoun: Schul þai neuer come to raunsoun.

Y nil nou?t he wiþ þe go: To michel iuel þou wost him do.’ Þan þai token her leue þo: Wiþ gret loue þai kisten hem bo. To Lorein went þe douke Loer, Þat wiþ worþschipe dede kepe þer Herhaud of Arderne, þe marchis: Wele leuer him were be ded, y-wis. When he to Gij com no mi?t, Leue him were dye anon ri?t. Now is Otous to Paui gan, Wiþ him he ledde his feir leman, Also he dede þerl sir Tirri Fast y-fetred, sikerly, Ri?t fast vnder þe hors fet In-to Paui, and þer him let. When Oysel seye him lede so Sore sche wepe for his wo. Ac o þing hir glad, sikerliche: Opon Gij sche trust miche. Seþþe þat he aschaped was, Wele sche þou?t þurch sum cas He schuld Tirri out of prisoun cast, Hir swete leman, wel on hast. Þai com to Paui wiþ þat: Þe douk Otus nou?t for?at, Þat erl Tirri he bond fast, &amp; in-to þester prisoun him cast, Þer he was in sorwe, apli?t: He nist wheþer it wer day or ni?t.

When he was passed þat water sternne He loked about him wel ?ernne, Of his felawes him vnderstode: Wel neye he was for sorwe wode. ‘God,’ he seyd, ‘what schal y do? Weri wreche, whider may y go? Ichaue forlorn þe gode Tirri &amp; Herhaud, for wham icham sori. Amow, sir douk Loer, Hou mi?testow dreye þe bismer, Þat þe fals douk Otoun Dede bifor þe þat traisoun?

For þe ichil mi liif in periil do, Þat y schal his body smite ato Þat þus þis traisoun haþ ous do, &amp; so ichil awreke þe: Dye ichil bot it so be.’ Gij rode forþ in his way Alle þat iche self day, So long þat he a castel seye Opon a roche stode an heye. He þou?t to herberwe þare; For he no mi?t no ferþer fare. Also he to þe gates come A ?ong kni?t he fond þer anon. Michel he was, hende, &amp; fre: Feren he hadde wiþ him þre. Gij sey bi his semblaunt anon Þat he was lord ouer hem ichon. ‘Sir,’ quaþ Gij, ‘vnderstond to me. Þe lord, þat made me and te, Þe loke ?if þi wille be, And miche blisse he ?if þe. A kni?t icham deswarre, Þat in y bid par charite.’ Þe lord answerd sweteliche, ‘Þou it schalt haue, bleþeliche.’ He dede vnder-fong his stede þo, Bi his own he dede it do. Bi þe ri?t hond he toke sir Gij, &amp; went into his halle on hey. A mantel of silk he of-sent on hast, &amp; about him he dede it cast. Wonderliche þai bihelden him alle Kni?tes þat weren in þe halle; For he was michel &amp; wele y-sett. Þai him bihelden wele þe bett. Þe lord wiþ þat to him sede, ‘Ich þe bidde for loue-rede Þat þi name telle þou me, &amp; nou?t forhole it no be.’ Gij answerd wel sweteliche, ‘Mi name y þe telle, sikerliche: Gij of Warwike mi name is. Iuel ich am acumbred, y-wis.’ When þe lord herd þat, Þat it was Gij þat to him spac, ‘Sir,’ he seyd, ‘welcome ?e be: In ?our owhen herberwe ?e. Ful welcome artow to me, &amp; ful wele y knowe þe.

Alle þine kni?tes where ben he?’ ‘Ich-il þe telle,’ þan seyd sir Gij. ‘Now vnder-stond ich am sori.’ Þan teld he him al þat cas, Hou þerl Tirri wounded was, &amp; hou he hadde y-heled his wounde, &amp; socurd his fader, &amp; ost him founde, &amp; hou he passed him self vnnome, &amp; hou þai were þurch traisoun ouer-come, &amp; hou his felawes weren y-nome, &amp; hou þat he was þider y-come, &amp; hou Tirri was y-nomen þo &amp; þe gode Herhaud also, &amp; wiþ hem fif hundred kni?tes, Orped men &amp; gode in fi?tes. ‘Y not ?if þai be liues or dede: Al ich hem sey nimen &amp; lede.’ When Gij hadde y-teld þat cas, Hou iuel him bifallen was, ‘Suffre awhile, sir,’ quaþ he. ‘?if it is þi wille listen to me. Ich haue castels &amp; cites strong Mani and fele in mi lond: Alle ichil bitake þe, Mine kni?tes ichil of-sende to me: Fif hundred ich of-sende may, Þat schal do þi wille ni?t and day.

Amis wiþ him gon wold, Ac he seyd þat he no schold. Amis bileft, þat was sori, &amp; often to god he bad for Gij, Þat for his swete moder loue Leue him harmeles o?ain come. Gij him di?t in a-queyntise, &amp; com to Paui in squier wise. An vnement purchast he Þat made his visage out of ble: His here, þat was ?alu and bri?t, Blac it bicome anon ri?t. Nas no man in þis world so wise of si?t Þat afterward him knowe mi?t. Now to Paui y-comen he is: Of no man aferd he nis. Þe douk Otus he fond þere, &amp; gret him as ?e may here: ‘Sir douk Otus,’ he seyd, ‘god loke þe: Al so ich it wold so mot it be. A man icham o fer cuntre: Hider ich come to seche þe.

Þe douk þat nou?t no wist, Þat Gij was þer-in, bi Crist. Alle his wille he may now do, Non vn-worþschip men seyd him to. Gij into a tour is y-go, A strong prisoun fond he þo: Fourti fadom depe it was. He hadde y-herd cri, ‘allas’: He oxed anon who þat were Þat made þer so reuly bere. ‘Ich,’ he seyd, ‘a wreched man: Me reuweþ sore þat y liues am. Erl Tirri mi nam is: Now icham a wreche, y-wis.

Sone so þe ni?t him come, Gij into þe cite nome: Mete anou? he bou?t þere, And to Tirri he gan it bere. Þus he dede y not hou long, Michel he slaked his pine strong, Alle his bendes doþ oway, And slakeþ his pine so michel so he may. Into a chaumber he goþ on a day, Þerin he fond þat fair may, Þat biment hir strongliche For hir leman sche loued so miche. Gij seyd to hir, ‘maiden fre, Wele þou owest to knowe me: Gij of Warwike mi name is, Icham þi lemanes felawe, y-wis.

When þat þai wer al redi forþ þai wenten hastily. To-ward Gormoise hij goþ, Mani man þai made wel wroþ: Þai nimen castels &amp; cites, &amp; destruen alle þe cuntres.

When Herhaud y-herd þis, Þat Gij and Tirri comen is, Neuer nas he so bliþe: God he þonked mani siþe. ‘Sir Herhaud,’ seyd þe douk Loer, ‘Ichil þe make messanger: To þerl Aubri þou schal go, &amp; Gij, &amp; Tirri, &amp; sigge hem so, Þat ich wiþ hem acord wille Of alle þat þai cun to me telle.

When þai seye Gij &amp; sir Tirri, ‘God,’ quaþ Gij, ‘Herhaud y se &amp; alle min feren, so þenkeþ me: Þai ben out of prisoun y-gon Oþer quite-cleymed ichon.’ To kissen Herhaud þai hem do, Wel gret ioie þai maden þo. ‘Sir Tirri,’ quaþ Herhaud þe fre, ‘Gode conseyl y telle to þe. Þe sent to grete þe douk Loer, Whom ich loue wiþ hert cler: Worþschiped he haþ me miche, And ouer alle oþer loued, sikerliche. Wiþ þe he wil acorded be, And swiþe miche he loueþ þe.

So long þai bisou?t him so, And wiþ hem Amis, þat þer was þo. Þer of acord speken he, Þat it schuld treuwe be. To þe cite þai ben y-gon, &amp; teld þerl Aubri anon Hou þat Herhaud was y-come, And hadde þe acord vnder-nome, Þerl graunted raþe &amp; snelle Þe acord to Herhaudes wille. No soiournd þai nou?t long þo, Bot ri?t to Loreyn þai ben y-go: Þerl Aubri &amp; Tirri his sone, Gij &amp; Herhaud ben þider y-come, &amp; of oþer kni?tes mani also, Þat bliþe were þider to go.

Þe douk ?af Tirri his douhter þo, And half his lond wiþ hir also, Bifor barouns &amp; kni?tes fre, Þat þer were of mani cuntre: Bridal sone þai han y-hold: Of erls, &amp; of barouns bold, &amp; of emperours, &amp; of king Nas neuer non so riche gestening. Þe kni?tes nomen her leue anon, Vnto her cuntres þai ben y-gon: Sir Gij soiournd þare. On a day he is þennes y-fare: Þe douk Loer &amp; mani a man In hunting þai were toward Braban; On hunting went þerl Tirri &amp; mani in his compeynie. Þai comen into a fair forest, Þer þai fond a bore, a wilde best. Þai vncoupled her houndes alle, &amp; lete hem ern swiþ snelle. Þe bore fleing swiþe he geþ, &amp; mani of þe houndes harme he deþ: An hundred he slou? and mo, Out of þat cuntre he is sone y-go. Þe wisest hunt folweþ fast, Huweþ &amp; gredeþ wiþ gret blast. Sone he worþ in a peril strong, Be it wiþ ri?t, be it wiþ wrong. Þo Gij hadde opened þat swine snelle He gan to blowe as y ?ou telle. ‘Bi god,’ quaþ þerl Florentin, ‘Who mai þat be, for seyn Martin, Þat ich here in mi forest blowe? Hert oþer bore he haþ doun þrowe.’ He cleped to him a kni?t ?ing, His sone he was, a feir ?ongling. ‘Sone,’ he seyd, ‘to hors þou go, &amp; who so it be, bring him me to.’ ‘Sir, y graunt þat it be so.’ Anon he lepe on hors þo: Into þe forest he is y-fare, &amp; Gij he fond ful sone þare. An staf he bar of holin tre: Gret wo þer-wiþ wrou?t he. ‘Lording,’ he seyd, ‘who artow In mi lordes forest is comen now Wiþ-outen leue of mi lord? In iuel time þou come, at o word: When þou hast y-nomen his swin No leue haddestow of him. Þat hors anon þou take to me, Þer-on no schaltow ride, y telle þe.’ ‘Leue frende,’ quaþ Gij, ‘þat nille y do. Þat hors no tit þe, so mot y go. Kni?tes ri?t is it non Þat he schuld fer o fot gon. To þi wille ichil wende wiþ þe, To seche þe waiis of þis cuntre. Þis horn þou mi?t wele haue, And tow wiþ loue it wille craue.’ ‘Lording,’ he seyd, ‘oþer is mi þou?t: So astow wenest no schapestow nou?t.’ Long berd he hadde &amp; sterne si?t; A man he semed of michel mi?t. Biforn him anon Gij him dede, &amp; feir he gret him in þat stede. ‘Sir,’ quaþ Gij, ‘vnderstond to me: He þat þe warld made he blisce þe. Icham a kni?t as ?e may se: Y bid þe mete par charite. A meles mete ?if þou me, &amp; seþþen hennes ichil te.’ ‘Leue frende,’ he seyd, ‘sikerly, Þou schalt it haue gladly.’ Þe water he axed þo anon, To wasche his honden Gij is go[n]. To mete he sett him in þat stede, Bred &amp; win biforn him þai dede, &amp; gret plente of oþer mete. When he hadde sumdele y-ete In þe toun he herd belles ring, &amp; loude crie, &amp; miche wepeing, Cloþes to-tere, her to-te: More sorwe no mi?t non be. ‘God,’ quaþ þerl, ‘lord fre, Þis gret sorwe whi it be?’ Into þe halle come þere Tvai men, &amp; a bodi bere: Amid þe flore þai it leyden, y-wis. Quaþ þerl Florentin, ‘mi sone þis is,’ Torent his here, his cloþes he drou?: In his hert was sorwe anou?. ‘Leue sone,’ he seyd, ‘who slou? þe? Now wold god, þat is so fre, Þat he were here in mi beylie! Nold ich it lete for al Romanie, Þat he no were anon y-slawe, For-brent, &amp; þat dust to-blowe.’ Þe kni?tes he slou? þere, Þe best þat in þat court were. ‘Sir Florentin,’ seyd sir Gij, ‘For godes loue now merci! Þou art y-hold so gode a man, Hennes to Rome better nis nan: &amp; þou in þine halle me sle, For traisoun it worþ awist þe. In edwite it worþ þe adrawe, Swiche a man þou schust haue slawe, When þou wiþ þi wille fre Þe mete me ?eue par charite. Were it wiþ wrong, were it wiþ ri?t, For tresoun it worþ þe witt, apli?t; Opon alle þing a þing atte mete, Þer ?e ou?t me to were fram hete. For godes loue, sir, so michel do me, Þat ?e þer-fore blamed no be: Do me deliuer mi stede, &amp; lete me out at þe castel ride, &amp; seþþen þei y slawe be No worþ ?e nou?t y-blamed in þe cuntre.’ Þerl him wiþ-drou? wiþ þat: At his hert gret sorwe sat, Þat he his sone seye ligge ded. Of him no worþ him non oþer red. ‘Sone,’ he seyd, ‘what schal y do, Whenne ich þe haue þus forgo? Who schal now weld after me Mine londes, þat brod be? A man icham swiþe in eld: Dye ichil, bi godes scheld.’ Opon þat bodi he fel anon: Reuþe þai hadden þer-of ichon, Of his gret sorwe þat he made. To his kni?tes no þe les he sade, For his sone he hadde aqueld, And for he was a man so eld. Fiftene ?er weren agon Þat he er in armes come. ‘Sir,’ seyd Gij þer anon, ‘Nim þi stede, &amp; worþ þeron. What wonder dede þe armes bere? To ?er more þou schust rest þe here. Her ich ?iue þe þi stede, For þou ?eue me þe mete at nede.

On ich side he seye come kni?tes, Burieys, and seriaunce redi to fi?tes Wiþ alle þat crie of þat cuntre: Wiþ hem nomen no wold ben he.

Of kni?tes þat wer gode y-nou?. Gij ferd forþ swiþe wiþ-alle Opon his stede, þat bar him snelle. Þurch þe forest swiþe he rode. Þerl him o?ein went wiþouten abode. Michel sorwe he made, y-pli?t, For his sone awreke he no mi?t. His sone anon biri he dede In a chirche bifore þe auter in þat stede. Alle þat day Gij forþ rod, Alle what þe sonne adoun glod: Of alle ni?t he no blan rideinge Fort amorwe in þe daweinge, So þat he to Loreyin com: Þe cuntres he knewe anon. Wel ri?t he ?ede to þat cite: Ichon þer fond he, Alle þe best þat weren þare: For him þai had michel care. When þai him hole &amp; sounde y-seþ Of his coming glad hij beþ. Gij hem told þe soþe, y-wis, Hou he fram þerl aschaped is. Alle þai þonked god þo, Þat deliuerd him of his wo. Seþþen wold he nou?t long duelle, To his cuntre he wold snelle. Gij of þe douke toke his leue, Ac he it him ?af wele vnneþe. Anou? he him bede of siluer &amp; gold, Ac he þerof nou?t nim nold. To þerl Tirri he ?ede þo, &amp; þis wordes seyd him to: ‘Sir erl Tirri,’ seyd Gij, ‘Now ichil gon, sikerli, Vnto mi cuntre into Inglond (Þat way no may y nou?t wiþstond), Mine fader &amp; min frendes to se: Y not ?if þai oliues be.

Al-so sone so it wite our fon, Þat þou art fro me gon, On ich side ous schal arise werre Of Almeyns, Lombardes neye &amp; ferre, Þat ben Otus kinsmen; For he was come of gret ken.

Gret wille ich haue to þat waye: Y no lete it nou?t, þer-fore to daye. No were it for þe loue of mi leman, Nold ich neuer wende þe fram, Ac wiþ þe euer duelle ich wolde, Þat neuer departi we ne scholde.

Alle þe men þat þer were Was for hem sori þere At the departing of to feren: Wel gode kni?tes boþe þai weren. Gij lepe on a mule ambling, Bi þe way he rideþ sorweing. Tirri bileft sorwe makeing, &amp; Gij his felawe bimeninge. So miche sorwe he made day &amp; ni?t, No man mi?t tellen it, y ?ou pli?t. Sir Gij no lan neuer rideing, Til he com to þe se, wiþ-outen lesing. Gode winde he haþ, &amp; passeþ sone, &amp; come in-to Inglond mididone. Now forþ to Warwik he is y-go, King Aþelston þer he fond þo; &amp; when he was to Warwike com, Wiþ ioie þai him vnder-fenge alle &amp; some.

Þe teyle is gret &amp; wel long: In þe warld nis man so strong, &amp; were y-armed neuer so, &amp; he wiþ þe teyle smot him to, Þat he no worþ ded anon: No schuld he neuer ride no gon.’ When þe king haþ y-herd þis Þat þe men him teld, y-wis, An gode while he him bi-þou?t, Er þan þat he speke mou?t. ‘Sir,’ quaþ Gij, ‘no care þou nou?t: Þer-of no haue þou no þou?t.

His felawes he lete þer ichon: Wiþ him most go neuer on Bot Herhaud, þat was gode at nede, &amp; oþer to kni?tes y-armed on stede. So þai come þider on a day, &amp; spired where þat best lay, Gij armed him wel richeliche, &amp; seyd to his felawes hastiliche Þat so hardi þer be non O fot wiþ him for to gon.

At asaut wiþ Gyes partinge Þat wers he hadde at þat wendinge, Þe best him neyed, &amp; smot him Wiþ his vp-coming so fel &amp; grim, Þat he a lappe rent out anon Of his brini, þat alle his trust was on. Now haþ Gij michel to done: To a tre he went him sone; Þer he wille bateyle abide Of þat best, what schaunce so bitide. Þat best bisides him it went, &amp; wiþ his teyle a strok him sent: On þe scheld he smot him an heye, Þat euen ato it to-fleye, Al-so it were wiþ a swerd broun. Well neye Gij him fel adoun. Wiþ his taile he bigirt sir Gij, &amp; him þrest so strongli, Þat þre ribbes he brac atvo; &amp; Gij wiþ strengþe smot him þo: Atvo he him karf smartliche, &amp; deliuerd him seluen manliche.

Þo þat best hirt him feled, Swiþe loude he grad &amp; ?eled, Þat alle þat cuntre dined þere, &amp; als wide as men herd his bere, Nis man in þe werld þat wer þer neye Þat him no mi?t agrise þat it seye. To a tre þan drou?t him sir Gij, &amp; werd him wele for þe maistri. His hauberk was to-rent tofore As a clout þat were al to-tore. Stalworþli sir Gij þer fau?t, Ac wele he seye it gained him nau?t To smite on the bodi bifore: He no mi?t him sle no no man bore. Also þat best him went aboute, Gij him biþou?t he was in doute: Bineþen þe wenge he him smot: Þurch þat bodi þat swerd bot. Þurch þe bodi he him carf atvo: Ded he fel to grounde þo.

Ar ich wald creaunt ?eld me Ich hadde leuer an-hanged be, &amp; brent boþe flesche &amp; bon.’ 124 Þan seyd Amoraunt, ‘at a word, Bi þe treuþe þou owe þi lord, Þat þou louest so dere, Tel me what þi name it be, &amp; leue to drink ?iue y þe Þi fille of þis riuer. Þou seyd þi name is sir Youn: It is nou?t so, bi seyn Mahoun, It is a lesing, fere. ?if þi name were Youn ri?t Þou nere nou?t of so miche mi?t, No þus vnbiknowen here.’ 125 ‘Frende,’ seyd Gij, ‘y schal telle þe: Astow art hendi man &amp; fre, Þou wray me to no wi?t. Gij of Warwike mi name it is: In Inglond y was born, y-wis.

Michel schame þou hast me don: Þi liif þou schalt astite forgon, Þi bodi schal atvinne, &amp; þine heued, bi Teruagaunt, Mi leman schal haue to presaunt, Þat comly is of kinne. Hennes-forward, siker þou be, Leue no tit þe non of me, For al þis warld to winne.’ 127 ‘Allas,’ seyd Gij, ‘what schal y don? Now y no may haue drink non Mine hert brekeþ ato.’ Anon he biþou?t him þenne Ri?t to þe riuer he most renne: He turned him, &amp; gan to go. Amoraunt wiþ swerd on hond He thou?t haue driuen Gij to schond: Wiþ sorwe he wald him slo.

Sir Gij stirt vp in gret dout: For noþing he nold abide, &amp; schoke his heued as kni?t bold. ‘In þis water icham ful cold Wombe, rigge, &amp; side, &amp; no leue, sir, ich hadde of þe, &amp; þer-fore haue þo[u] miche maugre, &amp; iuel þe mot bi-tide.’ 130 Sir Gij stirt vp, wiþouten fayl, &amp; Amoraunt he gan to asayl: To fi?t he was ful boun. Hard togider þai gan to fi?t: Of loue was þer no speche, y pli?t, Bot heweing wiþ swerdes broun. ‘Amoraunt,’ þan seyd Gij, ‘Þou art ful fals, sikerly, &amp; ful-filt of tresoun. No more wil y trust to þe For no bihest þou hotest me: Þou art a fals glotoun.’ 131 Hard togider þai gun fi?t: Fro þe morwe to þe ni?t Þat long somers day, So long þai fou?ten boþe þo. Wiche was þe better of hem to Noman chese no may. Bot at a strok as Amoraunt cast, Sir Gij mett wiþ him in hast, &amp; tau?t him a sori play: Þe ri?t arme wiþ þe swerd fot hot Bi þe scholder of he it smot, To grounde it fleye oway. 132 When Amoraunt feld him to smite In his left hond wiþ michel hete Þe swerd he hent fot hot: As a lyoun þan ferd he, Þritti sautes he made &amp; þre Wiþ his swerd, þat wel bot; Bot for þe blod þat of him ran Amoraunt strengþe slake bigan. When Gij þat soþ wot, Þat Amoraunt was faynting, Sir Gij him folwed wiþouten dueling: Þat oþer hond of he smot. 133 When Amoraunt had boþe hondes forlore A wreche he held him-self þerfore: His wit was alto-dreued. On sir Gij he lepe wiþ alle his mi?t, Þat almast he had feld him doun ri?t, &amp; sir Gij was agreued, &amp; stirt bisiden fot hot, &amp; Amoraunt in þe nek he smot: His mi?t he haþ him bireued.

Seþþe forþ in his way he ?ede Þurch-out mani vncouþe þede: To Costentyn he is y-fare. 142 When Gij in Costentin hadde be Out of þat lond þan went he, Walkand in þe strete On pilgrimage in his iurnay, His bedes bidand ni?t &amp; day, His sinnes for to bete. In Almaine þan went he, y-wis, Þer he was sumtime holden of gret pris. He com to a four way lete Bi?onde Espire, þat riche cite: Under a croice, was maked of tre, A pilgrim he gan mete, 143 Þat wrong his honden, &amp; wepe sore, &amp; curssed þe time þat he was bore: ‘Allas,’ it was his song. ‘Wayleway,’ he seyd, ‘that stounde!

So god ?eue þe ioie to fong, Tel me what þi name it be, &amp; whi þou makest þus gret pite: Meþenke þi paynes strong.’ 144 ‘Godeman,’ seyd þe pilgrim þo, ‘What hastow to frein me so? Swiche sorwe icham in sou?t, Þat, þei y told þe alle mi care, For þe mi?t y neuer þe better fare: To grounde icham so brou?t.’ ‘?is,’ seyd Gij, ‘bi þe gode rode, Conseyl y can ?iue þe gode, &amp; tow telle me þi þou?t; For oft it falleþ vncouþe man Þat gode conseyle ?iue can. Þerfore hele it nou?t.’ 145 ‘For god,’ he seyd, ‘þou seyst ful wel. Sumtime ich was, by seyn Mi?hel, An erl of gret pouste.

Ichaue a pani of old bi?ete: Þou schalt haue half to mede.’ 147 ‘Gramerci, sir,’ þan seyd he; ‘&amp; alle þe soþ y schal telle þe. Erl Tirri is mi name, Of Gormoys þerls sone Aubri. Ich hadde a felawe þat hi?t Gij, A baroun of gode fame. For þe douk of Paui sir Otoun Hadde don him oft gret tresoun, He slou? him wiþ gret grame. Now is his neue þemperour steward, His soster sone, þat hat Berard: He has me don alle þis schame. 148 Þemperour he haþ serued long. For he is wonderliche strong &amp; of michel mi?t, He no comeþ in non batayle Þat he no haþ þe maistri, saunfayl: So egre he is to fi?t. In þis warld is man non Þat o?aines him durst gon, Herl, baroun, no kni?t, &amp; he loked on him wiþ wrake, Þat his hert no mi?t quake: So stern he is of si?t. 149 &amp; for his scherewdhed sir Berard Þemperour haþ made him his steward, To wardi his lond about. Þer nis no douk in al þis lond Þat his hest dar wiþ-stonde: So michel he is dout. ?if a man be loued wiþ him, Be he neuer so pouer of kin, &amp; he wil to him lout, He makeþ hem riche anon ri?t, Douk, erl, baroun, or kni?t, To held wiþ him gret rout. 150 &amp; ?if a man wiþ him hated be, Be he neuer so riche of fe, He flemeþ him out of lond: Anon he schal ben to-drawe, Als tite he schal ben y-slawe, &amp; driuen him al to schond.

Þan sei?e he an ermine com of his mouþe Als swift als winde, þat bloweþ on clouþe, As white as lilii on lake. To an hille he ran wiþouten obade: At þe hole of þe roche in he glade.

Þe barouns weren in þe halle: Þe king seyd, ‘lordinges alle, Mine men ?e ben, verrament. Þerfore ich ax, wiþ-outen fayl, Of þis Danis folk, wil ous aseyl.

Now in al mi lond nis no kni?t O?ains a geant to hold fi?t: Mine hert wil breken on fiue. Allas, of Warwike sir Gij, Y no hadde ?euen þe half mi lond frely, To hold wiþouten striue!

Of al þat ni?t he slepe ri?t nou?t, Bot euer Iesu he bisou?t, Þat was him leue &amp; dere, He schuld him sende þurch his sond A man to fi?t wiþ Colbrond, ?if it is wille were; &amp; Iesus Crist ful of mi?t He sent him a noble kni?t, As ?e may forward here. 243 Þer cam an angel fram heuen li?t, &amp; seyd to þe king ful ri?t Þurch grace of godes sond.

A-morwe he ros vp ful swiþe, &amp; went to þe gate ful ri?t; Tvay erls went wiþ him þo, &amp; tvay bischopes dede also. Þe weder was fair &amp; bri?t. Opon þe day about prime Þe king sei?e cum þe pilgrim. Bi þe sclauayn he him pli?t: ‘Pilgrim,’ he seyd, ‘y pray þe, To court wende þou hom wiþ me, &amp; ostel þer al ni?t.’ 245 ‘Be stille, sir,’ seyd þe pilgrim: ‘It is nou?t ?ete time to take min in, Al-so god me rede.’ Þe king him bisou?t þo, &amp; þe lordinges dede also: To court wiþ hem he ?ede. ‘Pilgrim,’ quaþ þe king, ‘par charite, ?if it be þi wil, vnderstond to me: Y schal schewe þe al our nede. Þe king of Danmark wiþ gret wrong Þurch a geaunt, þat is so strong, Wil strou al our þede. 246 &amp; whe han taken of him batayle, On what maner, saunfayle, Y schal now tellen þe.

Sir Gij biheld þe lordinges alle, &amp; whiche sorwe hem was bi-falle: Sir Gij hadde of hem care. 248 Sir Gij tok vp þe king anon, &amp; bad þe lordinges euerichon Þat þai schuld vp stond, &amp; seyd, ‘for god in trinite &amp; for to make Inglond fre, Þe batayle y nim on hond.’ Þan was þe king ful glad &amp; bliþe, &amp; þonked Gij a þousend siþe &amp; Iesu Cristes sond. To þe king of Danmark he sent þan, &amp; seyd he hadde founden a man To fi?t for Inglond. 249 Þe Danismen busked hem ?are Into batayle for to fare: To fi?t þai war wel fawe. &amp; Gij was armed swiþe wel In a gode hauberk of stiel Wrou?t of þe best lawe. An helme he hadde of michel mi?t With a ce[r]cle of gold, þat schon bri?t, Wiþ precious stones on rawe. In þe frunt stode a char-bukel ston: As bri?t as ani sonne it schon Þat glemes vnder schawe. 250 On þat helme stode a flour: Wrou?t it was of diuers colour; Mirie it was to b[i]hold. Trust &amp; trewe was his ventayle, Gloues, &amp; gambisoun, &amp; hosen of mayle As gode kni?t haue scholde. Girt he was wiþ a gode brond Wele kerueand, bi-forn his hond A targe listed wiþ gold, Portreyd wiþ þre kinges corn, Þat present god when he was born: Mirier was non on mold. 251 &amp; a swift ernand stede Al wrin þai dede him lede: His tire it was ful gay. Sir Gij opon þat stede wond Wiþ a gode glaiue in hond, &amp; priked him forþ his way, &amp;, when he com to þe plas Þer þe batayl loked was, Gij li?t wiþ-outen delay, &amp; fel on knes doun in þat stede, &amp; to god he bad his bede, He schuld ben his help þat day. 252 ‘Lord,’ seyd Gij, ‘þat rered Lazeroun, &amp; for man þoled passioun, &amp; on þe rode gan blede, Þat saued Sussan fram þe feloun, &amp; halp Daniel fram þe lyoun, To-day wisse me &amp; rede: Astow art mi?ti heuen king, To-day graunt me þi blisseing, &amp; help me at þis nede. &amp;, leuedi Mari ful of mi?t, To-day saue Inglondes ri?t, &amp; leue me wele to spede.’ 253 When þe folk was samned bi boþe side, Þe to kinges wiþ michel pride After þe relikes þai sende, Þe corporas, &amp; þe messe gere: On þe halidom þai gun swere Wiþ wordes fre &amp; hende. Þe king of Danmarke swore furst, ywis, ?if þat his geant slayn is, To Danmarke he schal wende, &amp; neuer more Inglond cum wiþinne, No non after him of his kinne Vnto þe warldes ende. 254 Seþþen swore þe king Aþelston, &amp; seyd among hem euerichon Bi god þat al may weld, ?if his man þer slayn be, Or ouer-comen, þat men may se, Recreaunt in þe feld, His man he wil bicom an hond, &amp; alle þe reme of Inglond Of him for to helde, &amp; hold him for lord &amp; king, Wiþ gold, &amp; siluer, &amp; oþer þing Gret trowage him for to ?elde. 255 When þai had sworn &amp; ostage founde, Colbrond stirt vp in þat stounde: To fi?t he was ful felle. He was so michel &amp; so vnrede, Þat non hors mi?t him lede, In gest as y ?ou telle. So mani he hadde of armes gere, Vnneþe a cart mi?t hem bere, Þe Inglisse for to quelle. Swiche armour as he hadde opon, Y-wis, no herd ?e neuer non, Bot as it ware a fende of helle. 256 Of mailes was nou?t his hauberk: It was al of anoþer werk, Þat meruail is to here. Alle it were þicke splentes of stiel, Þicke y-ioined strong &amp; wel, To kepe þat fendes fere. Hossen he hadde also wele y-wrou?t: Oþer þan sp[l]entes was it nou?t Fram his fot to his swere. He was so michel &amp; so strong, &amp; þer-to so wonderliche long: In þe world was non his pere. 257 An helme he hadde on his heued sett, &amp; þer-vnder a þicke bacinet. Unsemly was his wede. A targe he had wrou?t ful wel (Oþer metel was þer non on bot stiel), A michel &amp; vnrede. Al his armour was blac as piche. Wel foule he was &amp; loþliche, A grisely gom to fede. Þe hei?e king þat sitteþ on hei?e, Þat welt þis warld fer &amp; nei?e, Made him wel iuel to spede. 258 A dart he bar in his hond kerueand, &amp; his wepen about him stondand Boþe bihinde &amp; biforn, Ax[e]s, &amp; gisarmes scharp y-grounde, &amp; glaiues for to ?iue wiþ wounde, To hundred &amp; mo þer worn. Þe Inglis biheld him fast: King Aþelston was sore agast, Inglond he schuld haue lorn; For, when Gij sei?e þat wicked hert, He nas neuer so sore aferd Seþþen þat he was born. 259 Sir Gij lepe on his stede fot hot, &amp; wiþ a spere, þat wele bot, To him he gan to ride. &amp; he schet to Gij dartes þre: Of þe tvay þan failed he, Þe þridde he lete to him glide. Þurch Gyes scheld it glod &amp; þurch his armour wiþouten abod Bitvene his arme &amp; side, &amp; quitelich into þe feld it ?ede Þe mountaunce of an acre brede Er þat it wald abide. 260 Sir Gij to him gan to driue, Þat his spere brast afiue On his scheld þat was so bounde. &amp; Colbrond wiþ michel hete On Gyes helme he wald haue smite, &amp; failed of him þat stounde: Bitvix þe sadel &amp; þe arsoun Þe strok of þat feloun glod adoun Wiþouten wem or wounde, Þat sadel &amp; hors atvo he smot, Into þe erþe wele half a fot, &amp; Gij fel doun to grounde. 261 Sir Gij astite vp stirt As man þat was agremed in hert: His stede he hadde for-lore. On his helme he wald hit him þo, Ac he no mi?t nou?t reche þerto Bi to fot &amp; ?ete more, Bot on his schulder þe swerd fel doun, &amp; carf boþe plates &amp; hauberioun Wiþ his grimli gore. Þurch al his armour stern &amp; strong He made him a wounde a spanne long, Þat greued him ful sore. 262 Colbrond was sore aschame, &amp; smot Gij wiþ michel grame: On his helm he hit him þo, Þat his floures euer-ichon &amp; his gode charbukel ston Wel euen he carf atvo: Euen ato he smot his scheld, Þat it fley?e into þe feld. When Gij sey?e it was so, Þat he hadde his scheld forlorn, Half bihinde &amp; half biforn, In hert him was wel wo. 263 &amp; Gij hent his swerd an hond, &amp; heteliche smot to Colbrond: As a child he stode him vnder. Opon þe scheld he ?aue him swiche a dent, Bifor þe stroke þe fiir out went, As it were li?t of þonder. Þe bondes of stiel he carf ichon, &amp; in-to þe scheld a fot &amp; half on Wiþ his swerd he smot asunder. &amp; wiþ þe out-braiding his swerd brast: Þei Gij were þan sore agast It was litel wonder. 264 Þo was Gij sore desmayd, &amp; in his hert wel iuel y-payd, For þe chaunce him was bifalle, &amp; for he hadde lorn his gode brond &amp; his stede opon þe sond. To our leuedi he gan calle. Þan gun þe Danis ost Ich puken oþer &amp; make bost, &amp; seyd among hem alle, ‘Now schal þe Inglis be slain in feld. Gret trouage Inglond schal ous ?eld, &amp; euermore ben our þral.’ 265 ‘Now, sir kni?t,’ seyd Colbrond, ‘Þou hast lorn þi swerd in þine hond, Þi scheld, &amp; eke þi stede. Do now wele, ?eld þe to me, &amp; smertlich vnarme þe: Cri merci, y þe rede; &amp;, for þou art so douhti kni?t, Þou durst o?ain me held fi?t, To mi lord y schal þe lede, &amp; wiþ him þou schalt acorded be: In his court he wil hold þe, &amp; finde þat þe is nede.’ 266 ‘Do way,’ seyd Gij, ‘þerof speke nou?t. Bi him þat al þis world haþ wrou?t, Ich hadde leuer þou were an-hong! Ac þou hast armes gret plente: Y-wis, þou most lene me On of þine axes strong.’ Colbrond swore bi Apolin, ‘Of al þe wepen þat is min Her schaltow non afong. Now þou wilt nou?t do bi mi rede, Þou schalt dye on iuel dede, Er þat it be ou?t long.’ 267 When Gij herd him speke so, Al sone he gan him turn þo, &amp; to his wepen he geþ. Þer his axes stoden bi hem-selue, He kept on wiþ a wel gode helue, Þe best him þou?t he seþ. To Colbron[d] o?ain he ran, &amp; seyd, ‘traitour,’ to him þan, ‘Þou schalt han iuel deþ. Now ich haue of þi wepen plente, Where-wiþ þat y may were me Ri?t maugre al þin teþ.’ 268 Colbrond þan wiþ michel hete On Gyes helme he wald haue smite Wiþ wel gret hert tene, Ac he failed of his dint, &amp; þe swerd into þe erþe went A fot &amp; more, y wene, &amp; wiþ Colbrondes out-drau?t Sir Gij wiþ ax a strok him rau?t, A wounde þat was wele sene. So smertliche he smot to Colbrond, Þat his ri?t arme wiþ alle þe hond He strok of quite &amp; clene. 269 When Colbrond feld him so smite, He was wel wroþ, ?e may wel wite: He gan his swerd vp fond, &amp; in his left hond op it haf, &amp; Gij in þe nek a strok him ?af As he [gan] stoupe for þe brond, Þat his heued fro þe bodi he smot, &amp; into þe erþe half a fot: Þurch grace of godes sond Ded he feld þe glotoun þare. Þe Denis wiþ sorwe &amp; care Þai di?t hem out of lond. 270 Bliþe were þe Inglis men ichon: Erls, barouns, &amp; king Aþelston Þai toke sir Gij þat tide, &amp; ladde him to Winchester toun Wiþ wel fair processioun Ouer al bi ich a side. For ioie belles þai gun ring, ‘Te deum laudamus’ þai gun sing, &amp; play, &amp; michel pride. Sir Gij vnarmed him, &amp; was ful bliþe: His sclauain he axed also swiþe: No lenger he nold abide. 271 ‘Sir pilgrim,’ þan seyd þe king, ‘Whennes þou art, wiþouten lesing, Þou art douhti of dede; For þurch douhtines of þin hond Þou hast saued al Inglond: God quite þe þi mede, &amp; mi treuþe y schal pli?t þe, So wele y schal feffe þe Boþe in lond &amp; lede, Þat of riches in toun &amp; tour Þou schalt be man of mest honour Þat woneþ in al mi þede.’ 272 ‘Sir king,’ seyd þe pilgrim, ‘Of alle þe lond þat is tin Y no kepe þerof na mare; Bot, now ichaue þe geant slain (Þerof, y-wis, icham ful fain), Mi way ichil forþ fare.’ ‘Merci, sir,’ þe king seyd þan, ‘Tel me, for him þat made man (For noþing þou ne spare), Tel me what þi name it be, Whennes þou art, &amp; of what cuntre, Or y schal dye for care.’ 273 ‘Sir king,’ he seyd, ‘y schal tel it þe: What mi ri?t name it be Þou schalt witen anon, Ac þou schalt go wiþ me y-fere, Þat noman of our conseyl here, Bot þou &amp; y alon.’ Þe king him graunted &amp; was bliþe: He comand his folk al so swiþe No wi?t wiþ him to gon. Out of þe toun þan went he Wele half a mile fram þat cite, &amp; þer made Gij his mon. 274 ‘Sir king,’ seyd Gij, ‘vnderstond to me: O þing y schal now pray þe, Astow art curteys and hende, ?if y mi name schal þe sayn, Þat to noman þou no schalt me wrayn, To þis ?ere com to þende. Gij of Warwike mi nam is ri?t: Whilom y was þine owhen kni?t, &amp; held me for þi frende; &amp; now icham swiche astow may see.

For godes loue, say nou?t nay.’ 276 ‘Sir king,’ seyd Gij, ‘y nil nou?t so. Haue þou þi lond for euer-mo, &amp; god y þe bi-teche. Ac, ?if Herhaud to þis lond com, &amp; bring wiþ him Reynbroun, mi sone, Help him, y þe biseche; For þai er boþe hende &amp; fre. On Herhaud þou mi?t trust þe To take of þine fon wreche.’ Þai kisten hem togider þo: Al wepeand þai wenten ato Wiþouten ani more speche. 277 Þe king wel sore wepe for pite, &amp; went him hom to his meyne Wiþ a mournand chere. His folk o?aines him gan gon, &amp; asked þe king sone anon What man þe pilgrim were. Þai seyd, ‘he is a douhti kni?t: Wald Iesu ful of mi?t He wald leue wiþ ous here.’ Þe king seyd, ‘al stille ?e be: What he is ?our non schal wite for me, I-wis, of al þis ?ere.’ 278 Sir Gij went in his way forþ ri?t, Oft he þonked god almi?t Þat þe geaunt was slawe. To Warwike he went, to þat cite Þer he was lord of þat cuntre To hold wiþ ri?t lawe. He nas knowen þer of no man, When he to þe castel ?ates cam: Þerof he was ful fawe. Among þe pouer men he him dede Þer þai weren vp in a stede, &amp; sett him on a rawe. 279 &amp; Feliis þe countas was þer þan: In þis warld was non better wiman, In gest as-so we rede; For þritten pouer men &amp; ?ete mo For hir lordes loue sche loued so Ich day sche gan fede, Wiþ þan god &amp; our leuedi Schuld saue hir lord sir Gij, &amp; help him at his nede.

When þe grace were y-seyd, &amp; þe bordes adoun layd, Out of toun he went his way. Into a forest wenden he gan To an hermite he knewe er þan, To speke him ?if he may. &amp;, when he þider comen was, Þe gode hermite þurch godes grace Was dede &amp; loken in clay. 283 Þan þou?t sir Gij anon Þat wald he neuer þennes gon Þer whiles he war oliue.

Mani batayle he be-gan For þe loue of o wimman Þat was him lef &amp; dere. Siþe Rey[n]broun on hire he wan, Þat was a swiþe dou?ti man, Ase ?e may forþward here. 3 Þay were togedre fifti ni?t, After a spusede þat swete wi?t Wiþ meche melody. Þanne was be-?ete þat baroun, His sone þat was cleped Rey[n]broun, Of þat kni?t sire Gij. Fourti wikes wiþ child ?he was &amp; dilyured þour? [godes] gras And is moder Mari.

Be þat he was seue winter old, He was a fair child and a bold, And of swete chere. So hit befel þat of fer lond Marchauns riche, ich vnder-stond, Hider þai come were: Gold and seluer þai brou?te meche, Badekenes and pane riche, Gris and menyuer, 5 Bras, maslyn, yren, &amp; stel, Wod-wex, selk, and cendel, Gingiuer and galingale, Clowes, quibibes, gren de Paris, Pyper, and comyn, and swet anis, Mani a riche bale, Fykes, reisyn, dates, Almaund, rys, pomme-garnates, Kanel and setewale, Scarlet and grene wel y-wrou?t: More richesse wiþ hem hii brou?t Þan y can tellen in tale. 6 Þai riuede at Londen þat cite: King Aþelstond þan fonden he, Þat her was king wiþ croune. A ?af hem leue in alle wise To wende wiþ her marchaundise In is londe fro toun to toune.

For he was lord of þat cite, Wiþ him hii þou?te wel to be: So þai han him kende. Sire Heraud, for soþ to say, Bad hem ete wiþ him þat day, Er hij þannes wende. Þe marchauns seie þe child goand In þe halle faire pleiande, Þat was so faire and hende. 8 At a kni?t hii askede anon ri?t Whas was þo child so faire of si?t And of swete chere, And he answerde anon, y pli?t, ‘Hit is Gij is sone, þe gode kni?t, Þat Heraud haþ to lere.’ Þe marchauns hem beþou?te, ?if hii þat child haue mou?te, Hii wolde stele him þere; &amp;, ?if hii hadde þat child bolde, Richely in-to her londe þai wolde, And selle hit full dere. 9 Wiþ þe porter þai speke stille, Þat hii hadden al her wille.

Þay gonne saily toward Roussy: Al glad hii were þet londe to sy; Hii þou?te wel to spede. Al siker hii were alond te gon, Ac swiche a strom hem cam upon, Þat sore hem gonne drede. 10 Þe wind began to blowen loude, Þe elmence þikkede on þe cloude: Gret strom hem wex vpon.

Þe marchauns han it vnder-nome, Þat hii beþ into Aufrik come: Hii þou?te þat hii wolde Þe king of þe lond presenti Wiþ þat child þat was so fry And of chere bolde. 12 Of hem hii token marchauns þre Þat noble were, curteis, &amp; fre, Wiþoute more duelling: Þai toke þat child, veraiment, And made þerwiþ a present To Arguus þe king. Þe king hadde a dou?ter fair: Of al Aufrik ?he was air, A swiþe fair ?onling. Meche ?he kouþe of menstralcie, Of harpe, of fiþele, of sautri, Of romaunce reding. 13 So was Reynbroun, for soþ to say, Meche liche þat faire may Of semlaunt and of chere. Besou?t ?he haþ be hir moder rede, &amp; to hire fader king ?he sede, ‘Leue, fader dere, Y mote him in me chaumber norsy: ?et a may me seruy; Norture y schel him lere.’ Þe king him graunted þour? alle þing, For he hire louede wiþ-oute lesing, To ben hire plaie-fere. 14 Whan sire Heraud parseued was Þe child was stole, for þat cas Gret sorwe he gan make. He let seche him in þat cite: Mani man made gret pite For þat childes sake. Wiþ mesagers a sente is sonde To seche him in mani londe ?if hii him mi?te of-take; &amp;, whan hii him finde ne mi?te, Sorwe hii made day &amp; ni?te: For drede þai gonne quake. 15 Hit nas nou?t longe after þan, Þat in Londen held king Aþelstan A riel parlement.

In pourpre pal þei gan him schrede, &amp; founde him al þat was nede, And baþes let him make. On a day sire ameraile Tok Heraud in consaile Wiþ-oute þe castel gate: ‘Now Arguus king werreþ on me, Me nis leued boute þis cite For grete werre &amp; hate. 39 Þe king haþ a kni?t wiþ him Sterne in bataile &amp; swiþe grim: Of swich þow neuer herd.

Þanne answerde an old kni?t, ‘Sire, y nel þe lye no-wi?t: A kni?t of cristene lawe Þemeraile is souder is he.

I ne aske it for no vileinie, Boute for meche courteisie: For loue ich asked þe.’ Wiþ þat Reynbroun wiþ-drou? him þere: Wiþ drery semlaunt &amp; reuful chere To Heraud seide he: ‘Kni?t,’ a seide, ‘thow ert wise, Sle?, and hardi, of gret prise, Be god in trinite. 63 Y nolde haue told it for non awe: Erst ich wolde ben islawe In þis ilche batayle. In Ingelond ich was y-bore, So were min eldren me be-fore, Wiþouten eni faile. Gij a Warwik me fader was: No beter kni?t neuer nas, Ase wid ase man mai saile. A stiward hadde me fader Gioun Þat hi?te Heraud, þe noble baroun, Swiþe hi? of paraile. 64 Lord he was of al Arderne: Ich was take him to lerne To conne of courteisie, And siþe marchaundes stele me (And brou?te me to þis contre) Þat weren of Russie.

Þis dai y bide in min eld, Þat ich me lordes sone se may!’ For ioie a wep al þe day, And swonede in þe feld. Reinbroun hadde of him pite, And seide, ‘sire kni?t, tel what þe be, For god, þat alle þing weld.’ 66 ‘Heraud,’ a seide, ‘me name is: ‘Ich norschede þe, Reinbroun, y-wis; In my nory þow were.’ Sone Reinbroun wiste þis, Þat [he] Heraud of Arderne is, Merci a cride him þere. Sire Heraud tok him vp þo Leuelich in is armes to Wiþ hertte &amp; wel gode chere. On here stedes lopen he, &amp; forþ hii ride to þe cite Wiþ meche ioie y-fere. 67 To þemeraile tolden he How þai acorded be Þour? grace of god almi?te. King Arguus was ouer-come, &amp; al is men y-slawe and nome In þat ilche fi?te. Heraud &amp; Reinbroun toke leue þo Into Ingelond for to go, And in-to schip hem di?te. So longe hii sailede in þe se, Þat in a lond thanne riuede he Þat wonder was of si?te. 68 Hii ne seie castel ne cite: Erst hii wente in al þe contre (So distrued it is), Til it toward þe neuen cam. A castel þei seie fer hem fram: To þe gate þai riden, iwis. Of þe porter Heraud gan craue, ‘Tel me now, so god þe saue, Was þis castel is? Forhel it nou?t, we bedeþ þe: Kni?tes we beþ of fer contre, Ase god ?eue vs blis. 69 Þis in we beddeþ par cherite, For godes loue in trinite, Þat is lord [so] fre.

Ac a leuedi her-in is Ful of del and sorwe, y-wis: Wel sore wepeþ ?he 70 For hire lord þat ?he haþ lore: Ioie ne worþ hire neuer þer-fore For non menstralcie.’ Þe porter in anon gan wende, And tolde tale ord and ende To Amis is leuedy: ‘Madame, her beþ come twei kni?te: Noble men hii be in fi?te. Þai wolde her soiurny Al þis ni?t, for soþ to say, To-morwe wenden in her way: Þarof y nou?t ne lye.’ 71 Þe leuedi seide, ‘let hym in: Þai scholle be serued wel afyn, Be þe grace of god almi?te.’ Þe porter wente a?en anon, &amp; to þe gate he gan gon, &amp; let hem in ful ri?te. Þe kni?tes were kende kore: Whan þai come to halle dore, Adoun þai gonne li?te. Men toke here swerdes, scheld, &amp; spere, Here stedes, and here oþer gere: Ful wel men gan hem di?te. 72 Þe leuedi faire grete hem anon: To vnarme hem hire-selue is gon Wiþ a wel gode chere. Here mete was redi wiþ-outen let: Anon hii were adoun y-set To þe sopere. Heraud askede hire, y-wis, ‘Dame, what þe lordes nam is Fayn ich wolde hire.’ ‘Of þe Montayne he het Amis: Wiþinne Almayne no swich þer nis, Me leue frendes dere. 73 A stiward was wiþ þemperour (To al Almayne he was treitour), Sire Berard of Paui: Me lordes swike euer was he; Þour? him in al þis sorwe we be. For þe loue of sire Gij, Þat me lord louede wel, &amp; sokoured him in is castel, We beþ in gret vileinie. For þe dukes deþ Otoun, Þat was a treitour feloun, He vs gan beli?e, 74 And made vs fle out of þat londe, &amp; in þis contre we beþ astonde, Þat wonder is of si?t: Mechel Arderne cleped it is. A fairy kni?t herin is Þat is of meche mi?t: Wiþ him ones fau?t me lord, &amp; ?af him dentes wiþ is sword Vpon is helm bri?t. Wepne mai him dere non: He is so hard to hewe vpon Ase marbel, y þe pli?t. 75 On a dai me lord honted a best, &amp; drof it out of þe forest Wiþ-inne is merkes stake. Siþþe herde ich of him namore: Þarfore me of-dredeþ sore Þe kni?t him haue take.’ ‘Allas,’ queþ Heraud, ‘is it Amis, Þerl of Montaine of gret pris?’ Gret sorwe he gan make. ‘O,’ a seide, ‘sire Reinbroun, Wel a louede þe fader Gioun: We mote him helpe for is sake.’ 76 Reinbroun seide, ase he was hende, ‘Tomorwe ich wile þerder wende To seche sire Amis.’ ‘Me swete frend,’ queþ þe leuedi, ‘Be þow nou?t to foul-hardi; For gret perel it is.’ Amorwe Reinbroun aros erly, And armede him ful hastely, For to winne pris. A gode stede he bestrod, &amp; forþ a wente wiþ-oute abod To þe forest, ywis. 77 Heraud wiþ him go wolde, Ac he seide þat he ne scholde For non skines nede, &amp; he dradde of him strangliche, &amp; betau?te him god in heuen riche, &amp; in is wey a ?ede. Heraud blefte, &amp; he gan gon: Þe merkes stake a pased anon, Þat was wel vnrede. Al þe dai a tok þe pas, Til it noun apased was, Ridand vpon is stede. 78 An hille he se? before him þere: Gates þeron maked were. Forþ ri?t he rod in. Þe gate a?en anon was spered: Þo was Reinbroun sore afered, &amp; faste blessede him. Nou?t he ne se? boute þesternesse. Half a mile a rod, ywisse: Þe wai was þerk and dim. He rod ase faste ase a mi?te: Þanne he se? more li?te Be a water is brim. 79 To þe water he com sone þas: A riuer be a launde þer was; Þar he gan to li?te. Faire hit was y-growe wiþ gras: A fairer place neuer nas Þat he se? wiþ si?te. On þat place was a paleis on: Swich ne se? he neuer non, Ne of so meche mi?te. Þe walles were of cristal, Þe heling was of fin ruwal Þat schon swiþe bri?te. 80 Þe reftes al cipres be, Þat swote smal casten he Ouer al aboute. Þe resins wer of fin coral, To-gedre iuned wiþ metal Wiþ-inne and ek wiþ-oute. On þe front stod a charbokel ston: Ouer al þe contre it schon, Wiþ-outen eni doute. Postes and laces þat þer were Of iaspe gentil þat was dere, Al of one soute. 81 Þe paleis was beloken al Aboute wiþ a marbel wal Of noble entaile. Vpon eueriche kernal Was ful of speres &amp; of springal, And stoutliche enbataile. Wiþoute þe gate stod a tre Wiþ foules of mani kines gle Singande, wiþ-oute faile. Þe water was so sterne &amp; grim, Mi?te no man come þerin, Boute he hadde schip to saile. 82 Reinbroun dorste nou?t pasy: Wiþ is spere a gan it prouy, How dep hit was beside. He þou?te on is fader fot hot: Þe stede in þe side a smot, &amp; in he gan to ride. Ouer is helm þe water is gon: He nolde haue be þer for ei?te non; Swich aunter him gan betide. Er he vp of þe water ferde, A fond it was þretti mete ?erde: So dep he gan doun glide. 83 Þanne he þou?te on Iesu Crist: His hors was wel swiþe trist, &amp; quikliche swam to londe: His fet fastnede on þe grounde. Reinbroun was glad in þat stounde, And þankede gode[s] sonde. In-to þe pales he him dede: He [be]helde þe est[r]es of þat stede; For no man a nolde wonde. Ac wimman ne man fand he non þere Þat wiþ him speke or confort bere Naiþer sitte ne stonde. 84 And þar-of war a is. Into a chaumber a goþ, y-wis: A knight a se? al-one. A grette him wiþ wordes fre, &amp; seide, ‘sire, god wiþ þe be, Þat sit an he? in trone. Sire,’ a sede, ‘tel þow me ?if þis pales þin owen be: Ich bidde þe a bone. &amp;, ?if þow ert her in prisoun di?t, Tel hit me, so wel þow mi?t: To me now make þe mone.’ 85 Amis answerde to Reinbroun, ‘In Almayne ich was a baroun, And now icham for-lore. Ich was driue out wiþ a feloun, And now y lye her in prisoun: Allas þat ich was bore! Of þis paleis inam no lord. Ich telle þe a soþe word Wiþoute oþ iswore: Hit is a kni?tes of fayri, And al þis forest her-by, A sterne man y-kore. 86 Þis paleys is of swiche mi?t, Her schel no man elde, apli?t, Be he her neuer so longe. Þei he wer her a þosand ?er, In is heued schel hore non her, Ne non elde fonge.’ Reinbroun seide, ‘ert þow Amis, Þerl of Montayne of gret pris? Þow singest a reuly songe. Now ichaue fonde þe, Þow schelt wende now wiþ me Out of þe paines stronge.’ 87 Amis seide, ‘spek nou?t so: Of þe me wondreþ, so mot y go, Þat þow ert hider y-come. Siþe þis world ferst began, In þis paleis ne com noman, Boute ?if a wer i-nome, Boute ?if þe lord him hider ladde, Oþer of him sum leue hadde: Nis non so hardi gome. How mi?test þow lede me, Whan þow mi?t nou?t saue þe? Ich telle þe at þe frome.’ 88 Reinbroun seide, ‘drede nou?t þe; Þar-fore schel hit nou?t lete be. Go we anon ri?t. ?if eni man so hardi were Þat vs wolde at-helde here, His deþ wer y-di?t: Swich a strok ich him ?eue wolde, Þat is heued lese a scholde, Be grace of god almi?t. Þei he wer te bataile boun Ase sterne alse eni lyoun, Wiþ him ich wile fi?t.’ 89 Amis seide, ‘let now be: Swiche stringþe mai nou?t helpe þe A?enes sire Gayere; For noþing ne schel him dere Wiþ no wepne þat man may bere, Naiþer stel ne yre; Ac, ?if þow wilt ouercome him, Þat ilche swerd to þe nym Þat hangeþ a þe pylere.’ Reinbroun braide it out anon ri?t: Þe chaumber was al ful of li?t Þat schon swiþe clere. 90 To þerl Amis anon a wond, &amp; tok him vp be þe hond: No leng hii nolde abide. Out of þe paleys boþe hii ?ede, And lopen on Reinbroun is stede, And forþ þai gonne ride. Nou?t fer þannes beþ hii gon, Þai be-held a?en anon Vpon here ri?t side: Comande hii se?e ride a kni?t Upon a stede gode and li?t, Prikande wiþ pride. 91 Swift ase swalwe he com ride: ‘Kni?tes,’ a seide, ‘?e scholle abide, No forþer þat ?e ne wende. In me paleys þow hast y-be, And me prisoun ledest wiþ þe: Þow dost a dede vn-hende. Her ?e sholle bleue bo In me prisoun for euer-mo Into þe worldes ende, Or þow schelt, Reinbroun, þin hed forgo. Kep for me: icham þe fo; Bataile y wile þe sende.’ 92 Þerl Amys þer ali?te: Arome he drou? him anon ri?te, And Reinbroun Gayer gan smite. Gret strokes hii smite betwene, Þat adoun hii fellen bene: Aiþer sparede oþer lite. Siþe þai drowe brondes on grounde, &amp; hewe to-gedre wiþ grimly wounde Wiþ swerdes þat wolde bite. ?e herde neuer a stringe[r] fi?t. Reinbroun stirede him as gode kni?t: Hit was him nou?t to wite. 93 He þou?te on is fader anon ri?t: Ase fresch a was to fi?t Ase grehonde to hare. Betwene hem twie was gret fi?t: Aiþer smot oþer in helmes bri?t, And delde dentes sare. Þai hewe helm and scheldes bo: Gret fi?t was betwene hem to; Swich herde ?e neuer are. Reinbroun made him to blede, And felde him doun of is stede: Þanne was he out of care. 94 Reinbroun be þe nose him tok, And drou? to him, &amp; faste him schok: Þat greuede him ful sore. His heued benome him he hadde Ner it þat he merci gradde, &amp; seide, ‘sire R[e]inbroun, þin ore, For þe fader loue Gii, Þe beste kni?t, sikerly, Þat euer was y-bore. Wiþ þat þow haue merci on me, Al me prisouns diliured be, And hennes for euermore.’ 95 R[e]inbroun seide, ‘so y schel: In þat forward y graunte wel Þat þow aliue go, So þe prisouns diliured be; Þar-to þe treuþe pli?te me Betwene vs-selue to.’ R[e]inbroun glad &amp; bliþe is: He hadde diliured sire Amis, Þre hondred kni?tes &amp; mo. Into þe castel wenten hii, Þar was Heraud &amp; þe leuedy Ful of sorwe and wo. 96 Þai wer welcomed wiþ fair gle. Whan þe leuedi hire lord gan se, ?he made meche blis, &amp; Heraud, forsoþe, dede also, And herede god almi?ti þo, And Amis he gan kisse. Heraud tolde him al is treye, How he hadde in prisoun leye, For-soþe wiþ-outen misse, Fo[r] me lordes loue Reynbroun, What sorwe he hadde in prisoun, Honger, and þesternesse. 97 ‘Þis is Reinbroun, Gii is sone, Þat haþ set þe out of prisone, And [brou?t] þe out of þe care.’ Al is lif a tolde him þo, How Gij was out of londe y-go, And how hit was y-fare. Among hem gret ioie þer is: In þe castel was meche blis Among alle þare. Euerich of hem oþer gan kisse, And made meche ioie &amp; blisse: For blisse þai wepe ful sare. 98 Wiþ þat þer com a kni?t riding: To þerl Amis a brou?te tiding Fro þat emperur, Þat þe duk Berard ded is: A palmer slou? him, y-wis, Wiþ wel mechel onour. Þemperur hadde sent is sonde A scholde come, and [haue] is londe, Boþe toune and tour; &amp; þat þerl Terry and he Were skyred and maked fre Þour? þe conquerur. 99 Sire Amis wiþ is meyne Wente hom to is contre To þat emperour: A ?af him is londes fre, Boþe castel and cite, Wiþ wel meche onour. Glad of him was þemperur fre: Euer a was to him priue Boþe in halle and bour. And also was þerl Terry, Þat was þerles sone Aubry, A man of gret fauour. 100 Heraud &amp; Reinbroun tok leue þo Into Ingelonde te go: Þanne was þe leuedi in care. Mani iurne þai ride þo Þour? Spayne &amp; þour? londes mo: Into Bourgoyne þai come ware; Þe contre was strued doun ri?t. Heraud askede at a kni?t How hit was y-fare. He seide, ‘þe duk of Marce y-told, Þat is a stout kni?t and bold, Vs haþ y-brou?t in care. 101 Vpon our erl werreþ he: He naþ leued boute þis cite, Þat he naþ y-nome. Ac þis castel is gode engyn: Noblech a wereþ him þer-in Also a dou?ti gome. Wiþ him he haþ a noble kni?t, His souder, siker apli?t, Þat to him is y-come. ?ong a is, so þenkeþ me, Nou?t twenti winter old nis he, Ich telle þe at þe frome. 102 In þis launde her-before An hondred haþ her lif y-lore, Whan he se? hem ride. Her forþ ne schel pase no kni?t, ?if he haþ brenye or stede li?t, Þat he ne schel abide, And for-lese þer þat on, Oþer is heued ri?t anon Be þe wode side. ?if ?e be þat launde gon, Ich telle ?ow be sein Ion, Swich aunture ?ow schel betide.’ 103 ‘O, god be þanked,’ queþ Reinbroun, ‘Ichaue founde me compaynoun, Me felle wiþ to fi?te. ?if he wile haue oure þing, Y schel him teche, wiþ-outen lesing, Þat he doþ vnri?te.’ Nou?t fer þanne ne beþ þai gon, Þai be-helde a?en anon: Hii si?e his armes bri?te Vpon a stede whit so flour; His armes wer of rede kolour, A semede of meche mi?te. 104 ‘Sire Heraud,’ seide Reinbroun, ‘Now y se þat bolde baroun Þat is so stout a fere. Wiþ vs to fi?te he makeþ him ?are: Wiþ him to iusten ich wile fare Emforþ me powere. Ich him asaile, ?if þow wilt so.’ Heraud seide, ‘so þow schelt do, Me leue sone dere.’ Swiþe þeder rod Reinbroun, &amp; he in þe launde com adoun Vpon is deistrere. 105 Aiþer was prout &amp; mody: No word þai speke, sikerly, To-gedres þai gonne driue. Aiþer hitte oþer in þe scheld, Þat boþe hii fellen in þe feld Of here hors beliue. Siþe þai drowe brondes of stel, And hewe togedre hard &amp; wel, And delde dentes riue, &amp; laiden on wiþ swerdes clere: Helm and scheld, þat stronge were, Þai gonne hem al to-schliue. 106 Heraud beheld longe þat fi?t: For Reinbroun a bad te god almi?t Þat he non harm ne fonge. To him-selue a seide þare Swich fi?t ne se? he neuer are Of dentes þat were stronge. ‘Sire kni?t,’ seide Reinbroun, ‘Vnderstand to me resoun, So god þe saule fonge, Ac neuer ne fond ich a kni?t Þat me strokes dri?e mi?t Haluendel so longe. 107 What is þe name? whar wer þe bore?

Wiþ þat strok a stente adoun al, &amp; to þe erþe a is y-fal: His lif ne? he hadde leued. 111 ‘O frend,’ a seide, ‘ich bidde þe lete; For it is meche foly to þrete Eni man aliue.’ &amp; he ascorn bad him lete, And a sterte vpon is fete Hasteliche and bliue. Haslak smot Reinbroun anon, Þat to þe bokel þe schel[d] chon: Ne? a gan doun driue. Strong and gode hii wer boþe: Eiþer kedde þat hii wer wroþe To bringe oþer of liue. 112 Betwene hem strong fi?t þer is: Swich ne herde [?e] neuer, iwis, Siþe þat ?e wer bore. So mi?te nou?t longe be: Þat [on] moste þat oþer sle Of þe kni?tes kende i-core. Heraud be-held þat bataile, How aiþer gan oþer asaile: Wo was him þer-fore. A gret harm him þou?te it were ?if aiþer slou? oþer þere: For hem a wep wel sore. 113 Wiþ þat amonges hem com he, And seide, ‘kni?t, for godes pite, Herkne to me a stounde. Let now ben al ?our fi?t, And a?ild þe to þis kni?t Þat þou hast her y-founde. For he is man of gret power: In al þis world þer nis is per, Ne of so meche mounde.

In Ingelonde ich was bore, So were min eldren me before Boþe he? and lowe.

Boute þretti hors he nadde þo: Now he haþ þre hondred &amp; mo Þat ich in bataile wan.’ 120 Heraud herde þis wordes alle: Byter teres he let doun falle, And seide, ‘what is the name?’ ‘Haslak,’ a seide, ‘þow schelt me calle. Heraud het me fader in halle, &amp; Cristiane het me dame. Now þow wost whar ich was bore, And what ich hatte wiþ-oute more An erneste and agame: To forward þow schelt telle me Whi ich was afered of þe Þat we made er y-same.’ 121 Heraud beheld þe ?onge kni?t, Ac o word speke he ne mi?t For meche ioie and blisse. ‘Heraud is me name, apli?t, And þow Haslak y se wiþ si?t, Me sone, wiþ-oute misse.

[A Londres sont tut dreit ale, Ou le rei Athelstan ont troue. Le rei encontre eus est ale, Od li le meulz de la cite. Mult duement les ad honure, E del suen assez done. A Rainbrun doune sun conte, E si lui acrest mult sun fie. Treis iours i ont soiurne, Al quart ont pris lur congie, A Warewik uunt, la bone cite: Cil del pais sunt mult le. Rainbrun prent de ses hommes feute: Mult par est entre eus ame. Heraud sen ua a Walingeford, A son chastel bon e fort. Desore i uodra soiurner Od sa femme, bone mulier, Kar mult ad son cors trauaille En plusurs lius por sa leaute. De ceste estorie uoil fin faire: Plus nen uoil desore traire. Bel ensaumple i peut em prendre Qui bien la siet e ueut entendre De pruesce amer, leaute tenir, De tuz biens faire e mal gerpir, Orguil, richesces auer en despit: De Guion nus aprent le escrit Ceo est la summe de la ualur, Ke tut guerpi pur sun creatur. E cil qui en la sainte trinite Vn deu est par sa pite Nus doint en terre si servir, Ke ali en glorie puissums venir. Amen.]</field>
