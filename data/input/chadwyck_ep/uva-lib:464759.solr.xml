      <field name="fulltext">In Magnis vel voluisse Sat est. TO THE Truly Honourable LORD CUTTS. The reall Lover, burning for the Fair, Rather than offer up a Fawning Pray'r, Owns his Demerits, owns his Just despair. Crowns her with parting Praises, all her due; Blushing she Hears them, but Believes them true; The Poet so should to his Patron move, And sue to Honour as he sues to Love. No constant Youth a Second charm can Boast, They feel not Fierce desires, who Court the most, Should I lose thee, then every Patron's lost. No more to Greatness would the Poet sue, Honour's indeed A Name, if such in You. All but my constant humble Faith is gone, Yet, my sole Claim, is, I pretend to none. Beneath your Gen'rous smiles assur'd I grow; Who makes me Happy will confirm me so. Well may he own his Fortunes once deprest, Who finds his late past Ills can make him Blest. Let others Quarrell with exalted State, Tis mine to Praise, who know thee more than great. O what return can you, my Lord, receive? Or what can Poets to their Patrons give, What, what shall I who thro' your Favour live. The Muses off'rings to your Fame I owe, That taught me Verse, and to Despise it too. No guift, no recompence, can Fancy make, You only give whence you can never take. Others are pleas'd with Gain, you pleas'd, Bestow, Generous, alone because you Will be so. All I can be, to you, my Lord, is due, Ev'n my best Hopes have been Deriv'd from you. If e're to active Good I bend my Pow'rs, Mine is the Profit, but the Glory yours. The Primitive LOVES. BEING AN IMITATION Of the 4th. BOOK, of MILTONS Paradise LOST. Designing Satan, now in Eden, Sees Tall Spreading Groves, and Ranks of Lofty Trees. Around the walls of Praradise they Grew, And Seem'd delightfull at a distant view, But all within, more Goodly plants appear, Blossoms and Fruits at once their Branches bear, And leafs with Blooming Colours, all the Year. Or'e the high walls, with a Disdainful bound, The Tempter leaps on the yet Happy ground. Thence to the Tree of Life he boldly Flew, Plac'd in the Midst, the Tallest there that grew. Where Proudly Seated he surveys the Fields, And all the Pleasures which the prospect Yields. To him God's Garden no delight can give, He thought it Hell in Paradise to Live. With Scornfull eyes He did from thence behold, The branches Bending with their growing Gold. Beneath him far he View'd the fragrant Bow'rs, Fair, odor'ous Plants, and various Smilling flow'rs. He saw the banks Wash'd by the Chrystall streams, And silent Rivers Silver'd or'e with Beams. He saw the Meads, the Vales, and charming Groves, Saw Eve and Adam, and Observ'd their Loves. For now the Happy pair to Shades retreat, Their Labours past, to Shun the Schorching Heat. Hand Joyn'd in Hand, their eyes dart am'rous Flame Naked they Stood, yet Stood secure from Shame, From purest thoughts their ardent wishes move, They knew no passion, but Excess of Love. Thus past they on, in Close Embraces still, Nor God, nor Angels shun'd, for they conceiv'd no ill. His Curling Hair was or'e his Shoulders Spread, He of a Strong, and Vig'rous Structure made. Her Golden Tresses his in Length Surpast, In Easy waves they Flow'd, behind her Cast, And fell, like a Fair viel, adown Her Slender waste, She, to Whate'er, he Offer'd by Her side, Yeilded with coy Submission, and with Modest Pride. And now arriv'd at Their Appointed Seat, With gratefull thanks their Supper Fruits they eat. The Loaded branches with their Burthens bow, The Fruits, by their unweildy weight complying now, Bend or'e their Heads, and Court them as they Grow. On Flow'ry banks in their Fair Bow'rs they sit, Bow'rs for such Loves, and for such Lovers fit. Around them far and near their Creatures Play, In Mutual fondness Happy too as they. All Beasts before them mild, and Gentle be, And the proud Lyon, Humbly Wooes his Shee. And now fond Adam to his Beauteous Eve, Mixt with his Speech, do's some dear Kisses give. Thus with endearing Words his silence Breaks, And his fair Bride leans Melting while he Speaks, Thy wellfare Chiefly all my thoughts Employs, Sole cause, and Partner of my greatest Joys. 'Tis thou, thou only Giv'st these Sweets I see; My Pleasures and Delights are Centred all in thee, I grow Transported when your charms you Shew, Your Love and Fondness, makes them allways new, This place had not been Paradise, had I wanted you, But now, Dear fair, above Expression Dear, Think who created us, and plac'd us Here, Obey his will, and mind his Fixt decree, Nor dare to Tast of the Forbidden Tree. The tree of Knowledge Still forbear to Know, The Tree of Knowledge is the tree of Woe. Tast not it's Fruits, nor pluck them with thy Hand, This is the Lord's, and this is my command. To us God dayly do's new Joys afford, Then let us thank our God, then let us praise the Lord. For all the Mercies he is Pleas'd to Shew, To prune these Plants is all he bids us do, Which, were it Toylsome, yet were Sweet with you. Thus Eve reply'd; Dear shall thy precepts be, I'll pay Obedience both to God and thee, Thou art my Guide, thou art my whole Delight. My dayly comfort, and my Joy by Night. To Heav'n indeed I all my Praises owe, Heav'n made me thine, and Heav'n did thee bestow. That day I oft remember er'e I rose, When I first wak'd, as if from Soft repose. On a fair bed of Flow'rs, Beneath a shade, I saw my self in a Sweet Grotto lay'd. First my own form I did with wonder View, All caus'd my Wonder then, for all was New. With silent Admiration, as I lay, I View'd the Light, and saw the Shining day. Gently I stir'd Pleas'd with the Gratefull show, Gaz'd at these Locks, which round my Breasts did Flow. And wonder'd what I was, whence Brought, and How. Around I look'd, look'd all around to see If ought else Liv'd, or had a form like me. My wond'ring Eyes long did I cast around, Still view'd my Self, and then the Flow'ry ground. Thoughtfull I rose, and in the Fragrant Blow'rs, With Childish fondness I admir'd the Flow'rs. Just at the Entrance of the Pleasing Shade, I saw mute Creatures which in Pairs were lay'd, By them I pass'd, and on their forms I Gaz'd, Near me, all Fawn'd, and all appear'd Amaz'd. A Murm'ring sound I heard, not far from Thence, Which stay'd my Progress, and allur'd my Sense. This gratefull Noise, rough Issuing waters made, Which pour'd from Caves, and down the Valleys spread. There Gently pass'd, as Rivers to the main, And Flow'd themselves into a Liquid plain. Thither I went, and on it's Banks I stood, Then Lean'd and Look'd into the Silver Flood; Soon as I cast my Eyes upon the Stream, To my Fond view a Beauteous Image came; Frighted, I Started back, it Started too, But soon I turn'd to take a Second View. Calmly I look'd with an Alluring air, And Saw it Smile, Pleas'd too, and Charming there. Long on the Lake I held my constant Eye, The Lake then Seem'd another Painted Sky. There had I pin'd, and dy'd with vain desire, (Such power the Waters had to raise a Fire) But that a Voice in warning accents said, It is thy self thou See'st there, Beauteous Maid. With thee it Comes, and goes, but walk these ways, And I will lead thee where no Shaddow stays. Where one with Fond, and Earnest wishes Waits, To meet, and Bless thee in these Happy Seats. Thoughts of thy Soft embraces fill his Soul, Thou Shal't enjoy him and possess him. whole What could I do but follow? Strangely led, I wishing pass'd along the Flow'ery mead. At last I saw thee Tall indeed and Fair, Beneath a shade you Stood, and view'd me there. Lovely you look'd, and taking Charms you wore, The watry Image Pleas'd me less before. Tho' that more Soft, and amiably mild, Winning and Fair, with Longing Glances Smil'd. Towards me Strait you mov'd, all Charm'd I burn'd, And wish'd, and Blush'd, yet with restraint I turn'd. You following cry'd alou'd, whom Fly'st thou Eve, My fair, thy Lover, and his Loves receive. Forward in hast with Lovely awe you came, And your Eyes Sparkled with a rising flame. With low, Submissive bows my hands you prest, And clasp't me fondly to your Swelling Brest, Thus far your Actions woo'd, and your looks Spoke the rest. With a kind Glance, such as must needs have Charms, I pray'd you quit me from your Folded Arms. Then on the Ground I cast my Bashfull Eyes, Your fixt on mine, Look'd with a fond Surprise. Still wanting power to Speak, you Clasp't me fast. At Lenth, all fir'd, a kinder Glance I cast, And prest you Close to my own Breast at Last. You all in Transport, did some Kisses give, And cry'd my Fair, my best, my Dearest Eve. With fond Embraces first I look'd at you, I saw you Sighing, and I strait Sigh'd too. Then didst thou wish our Blessings to improve, And led me Thence to know the Rights of Love. With an unwilling willingness I Went, And some Dear sigh's as we Past on, I sent. Now at the Bow'er arriv'd, Fond are you us'd, And would enjoy, but Bashfull I refus'd. Sweetly you Pleaded, urg'd by am'rous Fires, And show'd your own, and Heightned my desires. I still deny'd, much Pleas'd to hear you Sue, Saw all your Longings, all your wishes knew; And wish'd my Self with Passion more than you. I mark'd your Loves which Rais'd your Fondness high, Yet could not Grant, nor could I well deny. The Joys you Sought, were sure by Heaven design'd, To be the greatest Blessing Man can find. Yet if no Courtship, and no Pains it cost, I'ts Sweets would soon be Pall'd and all i'ts Pleasures lost. Fondly you Strove, and all your arts you try'd, You saw me Yield at last, yet Yielding I deny'd. With gratefull Force which you did well Employ, You both took from me, and you Gave me Joy. But a Short while the transient Blessings Stay, While in each others arms imparadis'd we lay. So spake our Gen'rall Mother; and with Eyes Sparkling with Love, to Her Charm'd Husband flys. Half of her Swelling Breast he might behold, Free from her Tresses Curls, which Loosely roll'd Naked, and Joyning, his beneath the Flowing Gold. Pleas'd with Her Beauty, and Submissive Charms, He with Superiour Love receives Her in his Arms. Smiling he says, but first Her Lips he prest, The nighr, fair consort, Warns us now to Rest. Sleep's timely dew falls Gently down, and Lyes With soft, and Slumb'rous weight upon our Eyes. Come then, my Love, Soon as the Early Morn, Shall all the Fruits, and Fragrant Flow'rs adorn; We must arise, and to our work prepare, The dropping Gums and Blossoms need our care. Bestrown unseemly, and unsmooth they Lye, Hindring our walks, and Easy passage by. To whom thus Eve, in Smiles and Blushes drest. As you command me, I shall hast to Rest, I shall not e'er beyond thy Pleasure stay, Whate'er thou bidst, unargu'd, I obey. Obedience still thro' all my acts Shall Shine; So God commands, God is thy Law, thou Mine. To know no more, nor Towring thoughts to Raise, Is Woman's Happiest knowledge, and Her praise. With thee Conversing, I all time forget, The Sun unmarkt by me, may Rise or set. Sweet is the Breath of Morn, the Evening sweet, All seasons please me when with thee I meet. The Shining day, and the still, Starry Night, While I have thee, are Gratefull to my Sight, But all without thee could Yeild no Delight. Thus talking Hand in Hand, on new fal'n Flow'ers, They pass, well Pleas'd, towards their Peacefull Bow'ers. Their inmost Grotts of Odo'rous Trees were made, And lofty Plants around them cast their Shade. In statley pride Lawrells, and Myrthes grow, And grace the Entrance with a Double row. Rose trees, and Gessamin at the Doors appear, And high their fragrant, Flourish'd Heads they rear. Eve when espous'd, here did in Close Recess, Her nuptiall Bed with Flow'ers and Garlands dress. Thus at their Grotts arriv'd, they both Ador'd, And thank'd, and Prais'd their ever Bounteous Lord, Then side by side they Lay, nor Turning move But to perform the Sacred Rites of Love. Let others, as they please, Debarr their Joy, And talk austerely, but They did Enjoy. Here Love his best, his Golden shafts Employ'd, This Happy pair still Lov'd, but nere were Cloy'd. Whilst a soft Choir of Birds their Nuptialls sings, Love lights his constant Lamp, and waves his purple wings. Secure they Lay, their Bow'er by Angels kept, And, Lull'd by Nightingales, embracing Slept. The Flow'ry roof their Naked Limbs bestrows, With Show'rs of Violets, and the Fragrant Rose. Thus this Blest Pair's refresh'd, and all the while, Pleas'd do they Sleep, and in their Dreams they Smile. THE BATTEL OF THE ANGELS, Being an Imitation of the 6th. Book of Milton's Paradise Lost. Now Heaven's dread Voice, which late spake loud, was still, And clowds began to Darken all the Hill. In dusky Wreaths, Smoak roll'd reluctant Flame, And peals of Thunder God's wak'd wrath proclaim. With Godlike looks, Bright arming Angells fly, And vast Etherial Trumpets sounded thro' the Sky. In the Horizon, far towards the North, The Prince of Darkness led his Spuadrons forth. In Batt'lous aspect they were stretch out far, Where with proud state They Stood to meet the Warr. Their Flying Banners of bright Clowds were made, Whereon were Boastfull Arguments portray'd. From far appear'd, thro' the Celestiall fields, Beam-pointed Spears, Helmets, and pond'rous shields. Forward the Curs'd Apostate Legions ran, For the Loud shout of Battel now Began. High in the Midst, exalted as a God, Proud Satan in his Sun-bright Chariot Rode. Idol Himself of Majesty Divine, His flaming Cherubim about him Shine. Now Host with Host are met, this Chief alone, Proudly descends from his Exalted Throne. Before the Clowdy, van while Horses pranc'd, Proud Satan now, with Vast, and Haughty strides advanc'd. Whom Heaven's bright Glorious Hosts might well behold Come Tow'ring, arm'd with adamant and Gold. Abbiel, who veiw'd him with a bold disdain, Rush'd forward now, and met him on the Plain. When strait a Noble Stroke he Lifted high, Satan receiv'd the Blow, not us'd to Fly, The blow resounded thro' the upper Sky. Of all his Force, by this assault, despoyl'd, Ten paces huge the rebell back recoyl'd; Down had he Fall'n and Lay'n all prostrate there, If not sustain'd upon his Massie Spear. Stagg'ring some time, forc'd to forsake his Ground, He straite, as if by Thunder struck, Turn'd Round. So, from Beneath the Earth some gushing Flood, Moves a Vast Mountain which had firmly Stood; Born by the Rolling torrent half sunk Down, And the Floods roar to find the Mountain drown. Thus shouted Heaven's bright Hosts; their Chief Commands, Michael, their Godlike Chief, his Foremost bands. Arch-Angells Trumpets, as the Sign is given, Sound dreadfull Loud, thro' all the Vast of Heaven. Hosanna now the Faithfull armies Sung, Whose Joyfull Ecchoes thro' wide Regions Rung. The Legions move, and now the Horrid shock Made Thundring Skyes, with their Engagements, Rock. Fierce storming Fury in both Armies rose, And each confus'dly Charges on his Foes. Dread shouts and Noises now fill all the Air, And Clamours, such as Heav'n ne're us'd to Hear. Arms clash on Armour, and the Madding Wheels Of brazen Chariots rage, while the struck Driver Reels. O'erhead the dismal hiss, where squadrons drew, Of fiery Darts in Flaming vollies flew. No worsted Champions from the fight retire, Tho' flying shafts Vaulted each Host with fire. None here knew Fear, each on Himself rely'd, As if his arm alone could the dread strife decide, All there Fought boldly, none appear'd to Run, And deeds of Everlasting Fame were done. Far wide was Spread the Various Toyl of War, And All encounter'd in the Danger far, Now on Firm Ground a standing fight perform'd, Then, thro' the Scorching Air on soaring Wings they Storm'd. Long time the Battel Hung in even Scale, Nor either side Could or'e his foe Prevaile. Satan that day Prodigious Power had shown, All who approach'd were by his arms Orethrown; But saw his Host to Michaels Sword give way, It drove whole Squadrons with it's Conquering sway. In hast, he Strait oppos'd him in the Field, Under the vast Circumf'rence of his Shield. Around him far it did from Danger Shade, The rocky Orb of tenfold Adamant was Made. At his approach the Great Arch-Angel broke Forth from the Toyls of War, and thus Inflam'd, he spoke. Cease proud, aspiring Fiend, desist from War, Least Heav'n pour Vengeance on thee from afar. These are the Seats of Bliss, the Seats of Love, They bear not Violence, nor it's Works approve; Hence to thy place allotted, hence to Hell, That is thy Doom, and thou Deserv'st it Well. Hast, and be gone, or my Avengefull Sword, Shall act the will of thy Eternall Lord. So spake the Prince of Angels; Satan now Swells vast, and Answers with Contracted brow. With aiery Threats think not to make me Yield, 'Tis time to Treat, when you have gain'd the Field, What canst thou Boast of, where is yet thy Praise, What Trophies can you from your Valour raise. Have ev'n the Least of these Ignobly fled; You shall not Terrour thro' our armies Spread, While I am Chief, and Marching at their Head. Hence thou to Hell, thy self; no more thy Lord, Shall by your Meniall Slavery be ador'd I'll Empty Heav'n of you— Here we our self triumphant, high shall Dwell, Or turn this very Heaven into Hell. Where is thy potent God? Let him appear, Now, by my self, I know he Stays thro' fear. What! do I poorly Boast, a Slave! I see Ev'n thy Allmighty is afraid of me, Not he, but I shall the Allmighty be. This said, both Chiefs with all their utmost might And furious Prowess, now addrest for Fight. Such was the onset, that no Angel's thought Could reach their Godlike courage, for like God's they Fought. Stood they, or mov'd, or Struck on either-side, Fit they appear'd Heaven's Empire to decide. Now, now they wav'd their Flaming Blades in Air, And made dread Streaming, fiery circles there. His glowing Sword each Warriour strongly wields, While two broad Suns Blaz'd opposite, their Shields. With fiercer onsets each return'd the Shock, Their armour clash'd, and Struck like Rock on Rock. Just so, should Nature's Frame to ruine run, Among the Constellations War begun. Two Shining Planets rushing from on high, Would Strike, with Feirce encounter, in the Sky. At the first Shock turning each other Round, Their Combat Soon would Jarring Spheres confound. Now both their Swords alost were Proudly rear'd, And each to make the first Assault prepar'd. At once they Struck, the Sword of Satan broke, And in his Side deep he receiv'd the Stroke. Loud shouts were rais'd, then Satan first knew Pain, And writh'd him, to and fro Convolv'd, in Vain. Fatally sharp the Grinding Sword he found, Thro' him it cut with Discontinuous wound. Ethereal substance must by Nature close, Soon it Grows whole, but from the Gash arose A stream of Necta'rous humour which in Torrents Flows. Such Blood, Cælestiall Sp'rits, when Wounded, Shed; It stain'd his Armour with a paler Red. His Friends, on shields, back to his Chariot bore That conquer'd Chief, who Triumph'd there before, Groaning thro' Pain, and reeking in his Gore. Not far from off the Files of War they came, And lay'd him there, Lost to his Pride, and fame, Gnashing for Anguish, and despight, and Shame. And now their Mightiest quell'd, the Foe retreat, Michael, God's Chief, gave them a full Defeat. The Warlike field with shiver'd armes was Strown, Chariot and Charioteer lay overturn'd, and thrown. Confus'd in Heaps, were shatter'd Armours lay'd, And fiery, Foaming Steed's ran wildly on, and Neigh'd. The Vanquish'd Foe now with the day took Flight, And the Curs'd Prince of Darkness was oblidg'd by Night. Under Her Cloudy covert he retires, And in Her Foggs he rolls his sultry Fires. Michael encamp'd where he Victorious grew, On the same Field he Fought, he Triumph'd too. His Guards, and Watches plac'd, when now he Pray'd, Cherubick, waving Flames his Standards there display'd. Satan in Councill sits all Night to form, Engins with which he hopes God's Throne to Storm. Vast, Dev'lish Cannons he with Sulphur fills, And Mounts them high on Mighty rolling Wheels. With these he comforts his Despairing Friends, And seems assur'd that he shall Gain his Ends. These Dreadful Guns to all his Host he shows, They shall, he says, a Fatall Birth disclose, From far with Thund'ring noise among his flying Foes. God's Saints, he adds, shall to his side Revolt, And think 'tis he has got the Thund'rer's Bolt. Proundly he Slights the great Eternal Name, And Boasting loud, thro' Infamy seeks Fame. And now the Morning dos its dawn Disclose, When up in hast the Victor Angels rose. Not far they look'd, out to the Northern Coast, When they behold the lately Vanquish'd Host, On tow'rds them Slow, yet firm their Squadrons came, Thick as a Cloud, but Lighten'd into Flame, Satan at Head, appear'd in Pompous Show, He caus'd his Drums to beat, his Trumpets blow, And then his dreadfull Cannons thunder'd on his foe. The victor Host, tho' firm as Rocks, and bold, Fell thick, and Angel on Arch-Angel roll'd. The Host Satanick, Boasts they shall Prevail, With their chain'd Thunderbolts, and fiery Hail. Their Guns begin the Cherubim to gore, And they, thro' Joy, Loud as their Engines, roar. God's Angels are, tho' now too late allarm'd, Naked of all Defence, by being Arm'd. Impetuous Shots, upon their armour made, Low on the Ground the doubtfull Seraphs lay'd Which they, as Spirits, might unarm'd, evade. This overthrow to Punish them was giv'n, Their armour should be confidence in Heav'n. Worsted, but not Dismay'd, they ran, they flew, And from them far Armour and Arms they threw. From their Foundations loos'ning to and fro, They pluckt the Seated Hills, and Hurl'd them at the Foe. Shadowing they came, Turn'd downwards with their Floods, While Angels held them by their Branching Woods. Water in Streams from their Dash'd tops distills, As thro' the air Vast Hills encounter'd Hills. Thus, whilst this Wreck was made, and Scatter'd far, They Fought in dismall shade ev'n in the heat of War. Now whilst the falling Mountains dash their Foes, Confusion heapt upon Confusion rose. Now Satan's Hosts fear they have lost the day, Buried Beneath the Hills, their Confidence and they. Legions opprest by the vast Burthens fall, Michael Involving in one ruin all. Batter'd by Rocks, their Armour, bruis'd and crush'd, With grinding Pain into their Substance rush'd. And now their dreaded Guns are Useless grown, By mighty Mountains Rudely overthown, Whilst Satan, Bruis'd himself, hears his hurt Legions Groan. Some, in Confusion, from the Battel fly, And wish in vain the wanted Pow'r to dye. But now their Chief, Proud in his deep despair, Rallies his choicest Bands who scorn to Fear, Flyes to a vast high Mount, and bids Defyance there. Peices of rocks from the dread Height they throw, And Angels fly to Shun the Pond'rous blow. The conqu'ring Hosts in Vain to reach them try, Their Mountains can't so far, tho' Wing'd with forrests, Fly. Now Michael's God hears the proud rebells boasts, And now resolves to Prove the Lord of Hosts, He bids his Son hast to the Dreadfull Fight, And makes him Mightiest in his Father's Might. Go, says the Voice, (while Blest Messiah kneels,) Ascend my Chariot, guide the rapid Wheels; Get my Allmighty arms which Conquer far, My Bow, my Sword and Thunder, all my War. Go thou, and poure thy Force upon the Foe, Go, hast, my Son, full of thy Father, go. He said, and on him Strait with brightest rays, The High, Allmighty's shining Glories blaze. Commanded thus to Triumpth o're his Foes, Messiah, bowing o're his Scepter, rose. Now the third sacred Morn began to Shine, With more than usuall Lustre and with Beams Divine When God's dread Chariot rush'd with Whirlwind sound Flashing thick Flames, and Thund'ring o're the Ground. There, drawn by four Cherubick shapes in State, The great Messiah, as Triumphant, sat. Swiftly these Cherubin ascend the Skys, Each with four wond'rous Faces onward Flys, Their Bodies as with Stars, and Wings beset with Eyes. This shining Chariot bears Heav'ns brightest Sun, Whilst the strong Diamond wheels prodigious, feircely run. He on a Saphir Throne was Seated high, And Angels o're his Head bore up a Chrystall Sky. At his right Hand, which Thunderbolts did hold, Wing'd Vict'ry sat, with visage Nobly bold, Whilst from his Chariot, Flames with Fierce effusion roll'd. Onward he came, far off his comming Shone; He's soon descry'd, and wellcom'd by his Own. The Rebell Hosts now dreaded, all amaz'd, When the great Ensign of Messiah Blaz'd, They saw him coming, Arm'd with flashing Flame, Abash'd, and Thunderstruck, before his Thunder came. With Thousand, Thousand Saints attended far, And with his Father's Chariots, all for War, On wings of Cherub, now Sublime he Rode, Great, and Illustrious, like the Son of God. To him dos Michael all his Legions bring, Dispers'd, and Circumfus'd on either Wing. Before him power Divine prepar'd his way, He bids the Hills retire, the Hills obey. He'ven's face renew'd, each Mountain rears his Pile, And with fresh Flow'rs they and the Valleys smile. Now great Messiah in his Chariot stands, And gives to Michael charge of all his Bands. Alone resolv'd to Thunder from afar And with his own right Hand subdue the War. Satan Inrag'd at this, before he fell, And yet in Heav'n, within him, felt his Hell. Thro' all his troops in driving hast he Flys, Tells them all Hope in this last Battle lyes, And proudly now he shouts— And Blasphemously bold the Son of God defys. Drums beat on both sides, and the Trumpets sound, Whose voice is soon by louder Thunder drown'd. And now Messiah into terrour Grows, His count'nance Changes dreadfull on his Foes. At once the four their Starry Wings spread far, With horrid shade Contiguous, dark'ning all the War. As with the Sound of torrents, Rushing bold, The thund'ring Orbs of his fierce Chariot roll'd. All but the Throne of God i'ts Motion feels, The stedfast Empyrean shook beneath his Burning Wheels. Onward he drove: and near his Foes he came, And now his Chariot flashes Smoaky Flame. In his right-hand his Thunderbolts he bore, Thousands he throws, and now Ten Thousand more, Whilst dash'd Satanick Hosts, loud as the Thunder, roar. Down dropt their Idle weapons; over Sheilds O're armour, Helms, and Arms he Triumphs thro the Fields. O're thrones and mighty Seraphim he rode, And Scatter'd wild destruction far abroad. Whilst routed Legions wish, but wish in vain, The dreadfull Mountains now might be again Thrown on them in huge Heaps, to shelter them from Pain On either side in a Tempestuous show'r, The fourfold-visag'd Four their Fiery arrows pou'r, One Spirit in them rul'd, and all their Eyes Glar'd Light'ning which in dreadfull Flashes flyes. Now Satan thunderstruck, with all his Host, Forsakes the Fight, and owns the Battel lost. Vast Show'rs of Darts fly o're them, as they run, Raising thick Clowds, and Dark'ning all the Sun. Sparkling with Fire, and hissing thro' the Air, They make all Heav'n dreadfull as Hell appear. Like a dispersing Herd, or tim'rous Flock, Satanick Hosts fled from the horrid shock Messiah now has a full Conquest seen, And in mid Vollie holds his Thunder in. Fast he pursues them all with Terrours driv'n, To the remotest parts, and utmost Bounds of Heav'n. Now from the Chrystall wall they might behold The wastfull deep; the wall far inward roll'd. Such Fiends as those Heaven now no longer bore, Down tumbled Thousand Legions, Thousand more Confounded Chaos Loud, did in dread Ecchoes roar. THE Fall of Man. BEING AN IMITATION Of the Ninth BOOK of MILTON's Paradise LOST. Twas Morning now, and Eve the Happy bride, Advis'd her Spouse their Labours to divide, In words like these, while Walking by his Side; Adam, do thou, as Pleases best, remove, The pains we take, so may Successfull prove; But side by side while we together go, The spreading Boughs, fast as we Lop them, Grow. Plac'd near to thee, Perhaps, I work a while, But soon I steal a look, and give a Smile. Either our work, or our soft, Am'rous Play, Or somewhat else we Talk of all the day. Pruning the Trees, as I before you go, That you may Reach me soon, I work but slow. Or if you foremost in the Walk I see, Slightly I pass the Boughs, and Fly to thee. Then with Embraces we the time delay, And with dear Kisses one an other stay. Thus spake Fair Eve, thus spake the Beauteous bride, To her Lov'd Lord, who thus to her reply'd. Well hast thou Motion'd, fair one, hither come; Thy charming Beauties like these Gardens Bloom. Delightfull Blossoms in thy Face I find, And full grown Fruits are rip'ning in thy mind. Dearest, most Priz'd, and above all things Lov'd, Why wou'dst thou be from thy Delight remov'd? Soft, intervening Glances fondness show, And timely smiles from Love and reason Flow. God has impos'd no Task but what may Please, And Labours but to recommend our Ease. Sufficient time is given to Dress the Flow'rs, To lop the growing Plants, and spreading Bow'rs; All but the dayly Task of a few Leisure Hours. But if much Converse cloy thee, I could Yield, To pass some time without thee in the Field. To Pleasure you, tho' I shall Fondly burn, For short Retirement urges Sweet return. Distance will bring us Nearer, not remove, And when we meet, we shall renew our Love. When from afar I see thy Beauteous Charms, I'll hast, and Rush all Transport to thy arms. Whilst thy Bright Eyes shooting out Shining fires, In me shall Kindle fond, yet Fierce desires. Gush'd with delights, I'll fold thee Gently so, Whilst both our Cheeks with rising Blushes glow, I'll kiss, and vow I'll never, never let thee go. But ah! Some suddain thought has Check'd me, Eve, We must not part, I ca'nt without thee Live. We have a foe whom I extreamly fear, Stir not from Hence, but if you Love, Stay here. Together still, we need not be afraid, But may, if Tempted, Yield each other Aid, Yet thou, or I alone, may be Betray'd. Whatever comes, Leave not this faithfull side, That gave thee being, Stay with me, my Bride. The wife, whenever Warn'd of Dang'rous ways; Safest, and Seemliest by her Husband stays. Thus Adam Spake, while Eve attentive Hears, And thus replys; Dispell thy causeless Fears, The truth of what you Warn me, well I know, But do you doubt, because there is a Foe. Sure I can firm against his hatred Prove, Not all his arts my Constancy can move, Angels themselves could not Estrange my Love. Of Death or Pain uncapable we Live, Force can't avail, unless I Please to give. Whate'er is offer'd, if it seem not Well, Either I can't receive, or can repell. So, 'tis the fraud of the close Foe you dread, And think my easy Faith may be Misled. If we Unsafely from each other Go, Eden expos'd, can be no Eden so. To whom thus Adam answer'd; Beauteous Eve, Too Late, I fear, you may my words Believe, Who deceiv'd Angels, may thee too deceive. Warn'd be me thus, scince you your Faith must try, Remember me, and on your God rely. Go then, for now my Hope on this depends, You thus Prepar'd, the Foe may Miss his ends. Whate'er the Tempter, or Temptation be, I charge thee, Touch not the Forbidden Tree. With thy Permission then, says Eve, I Go, Doubt not, my Love, I shall resist the Foe. Then softly drawing from his Hand Her own, She smiling Leaves him, so Secure she's Grown. Quickly, he crys, ah! Quickly, Eve, return, With great concern I shall thy absence Mourn. Well pleas'd, She Promises to see Him Soon, And in the Bow'r to wait him, e'er 'tis noon. With ardent Looks he views Her on Her way, Delighted much, but Wishing more Her stay. Still dos he Gaze while the Dear form he sees, But soon No more perceives Her, hid by Trees. Lost, and Unblest, he must Alas! no more Behold a guiltless Bride all Charming as before. Thro' fragrant shades of Roses does She go, The Roses now in deeper Blushes Glow. Superfluous leafs, which grew Deform'd, She crops And slender Stalks of drooping Flow'rs she Props. But of her self, (fair Flow'r!) She takes no care, Tho' storms are nigh, and She from Succour far. At length the Serpent ranges thro' the Fields, He comes, He tempts, and as He temps, She yields. And now Perswaded by a long Dispute, She boldly Tastes of the forbidden Fruit. Rashly she Eats, then to Debate she fell, Nor knows she yet has she done Ill or well. Now she resolves, what e'er the Danger be, Adam shall Tast the Fruit, made Guilty too as she. In words, like these, she dos her Fondness show, Adam shall share with me in Bliss, or Woe, To Life, or Death, we shall together Go. Should he not Tast, and I by Doom not Live, He would be wedded to another Eve. Then would his Second Fair my Guilt approve, 'Tis death to think he should a Second Love. So saying, strait to Adam she repairs, Contriving reasons to Subdue his fears. Impatient grown, He had a Garland made, Of choicest Flow'rs to Crown her lovely Head Whom lost he finds, and in Amazement stands, To see a bough held Brandish'd in her Hands. Eve with excuses tells what She has done, Urges that he should Equall Hazzard run, And bids him not such Proffer'd Blessings shun. With brisk, alluring Air her Spouse she Warms, Alas! what Woman wants Prevailing Charms! She guilds her Crime with Thousand reasons giv'n, And Damns him with large Promises of Heav'n. Flushing she Spoke, her Cheeks such Blushes wore, As the fair Fruit which in her Hands she bore. Adam awhile, Astonish'd, and amaz'd, Stood speechless by, and on the apples Gaz'd. From his slack Hand the falling Garland shed, The faded Roses, which now lost their Red. At length, all Trembling, silence thus he Breaks, And to his Fatall, but Lov'd Eve, he speaks. How late, vain fair one, Didst thou idly Boast, Yet art thou Lost, yes, on a Suddain Lost. Defac'd, deflowr'd, rob'd of thy Blooming store, Just like those Roses faded— Never! ah, never to be Beauteous more. Doom'd, and Condemn'd, Death must thy Sentence be, Death be it then to both— For thou hast Curst thy self, and with thee, Me. Why should I now propose, or wish to Live, No, not tho' God should form another Eve. No second fair could such a Blessing prove, For, after thee, what could be worth my Love. This, and much more, Extreamly mov'd, he said, While lifeless Paleness thro' his Visage spread. She, all the while, Jocund, in Game-some Mood, Laughs at his Fears, and now holds back the Food. Ten Thousand arts she uses, looks, and Smiles, And now deludes him with her Specious wiles. At last he Yields and rushes to her Arms, Thro' soft Endearments, more her Beauty Warms; What vig'rous Man resists, when naked Woman charms Smelling the Fruit, on Eve his Eyes he cast, She Plucks, and Smiles, and he too Plucks at last. And now together Wantonly they Eat, All o're Transported with the Charming meat. With his Lov'd Eve the flowing Juice he Drinks, The place not Paradise, but Heav'n he thinks. He looks, she Smiles, he Dallies with her Hair, He Clasps her, She Clasps too, but crys Forbear. So when she found him Stagg'ring into Sin, By female Arts, and Wiles she led him in. Before his veiw the tempting Bough she bore, And only held it back, to urge Him on the more. But now their Transports to excesses fly, For soon Endearment works the Passion high. Now more Inflam'd, Closely his Bride he prest, And spread warm Kisses o're her Panting Breast. From her lewd Eyes such eager Glances came, Love's fires they Kill'd, and kindled lustfull Flame. Now to their Bow'r, not distant far, they Hast, And some few Moments do their Pleasures last. For now the transient Blessings quickly Cloy, Their falling Spirits sink, and with them sinks their Joy. Not, as before their Fall, do they possess, When they Enjoy'd to a Divine excess, Nor by enjoying did the Sweets grow less. Now spent, with Languid Eyes they look a while, But no soft Glances cast, to raise a Smile. A Gloomy Slumber dos their sense o'retake, And in their Dreams perplext, with broken Starts they wake. Like Sampson now his Dalilah he views, Close by his Side, but no Endearment shews. With looks estrang'd, he marks her as she lyes, Frowning his Brows, and Angry were his Eyes, While all within Tempestuous Passions rise. Now standing up, he veiws Her with disdain, And crys, vain Creature! beyond Fancy, vain! My strength by thy rash Weakness is Betray'd And thou I find Wer't perfect Woman made. Curse on thy Wiles, Heav'n form'd thee for Deceit, All Imperfections make thy Sex compleat. What wild desire of Wand'ring led thee on, To ruine me, and be thy Self undone? Thou worse than Serpent, Base, deceitfull Eve; The Tempter best might in thy form Deceive. Led tho' strange errours, Traytress, thou hast been, Tho' by the Devill, desirous to be seen. Whilst I, fond I, such Lovers fancies are, Thought nought could Injure thee, so Sweet, and Fair. This said, on Eve he fixt his constant Eyes, Who, now the Crime excusing, thus replys. Look not so harsh on your fond, hapless Bride, Must I have never Parted from thy Side. I might as well a Lifeless Rib remain, Ah! would to Heav'n I were so now again. Why did not you, you who my Failings know, Command me Absolutely not to go, It was thy Fault, not mine, I thought no Ill, Woman is weak in all things, but her Will. Besides, no Enmity between us known, I meant the Foe no harm, so dreaded none. Thus by her Speech her Innocence she Prov'd. Whom Adam answer'd thus, Extreamly mov'd, And Calmer Grows because he knew she Lov'd. Come, to the Figtrees let us strait repair, And hide our Naked parts from one another there, Around them tall, fast rooted Twiggs I see, And Daughters grow about the Mother Tree. Broad are their Leafs, with them Conceal thy Shame, Thus Adam her, and She did Adam blame. Hence it appears her Sex dos Nothing Ill, Their crime is charg'd on their Accuser still, And the Wife blames the Man who should restrain her Will, THE END.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">BELLONA AND ASTREA. Speakers' names have been abbreviated in this text. The abbreviations used for major characters are as follows: For Ast. read Astrea. For Bell. read Bellona. [Ast:] Bellona, stay, forsake not Albion's Shore, Tho' now thou Rav'st in horrid Arms no more. The Conquest mine, mine should the Triumph be, By thy own Victories I vanquish'd thee. Throw not thy Helmet by, nor drop thy Shield, Be thou Astræa's Champion in the Field, For I am Ravish'd if Bellona Yield. [Bell.] Still must I range along the burthen'd Plains, Must I still Fright Brittannia's harrass'd Swains? Beneath my Tread no smiling Corn will Grow, All will be Barren where my Sword shall Plow. Detain me not, or keep me Bound your Slave; You may in time Repent the Power you Gave. [Ast.] With fierce Embrace Bellona was pursu'd, You Nassaw ravish'd, but Astrea woo'd. Tho' now his Bride, still I'm his Mistress too, Only to Yield to me, he Vanquish'd you. When thy large Veins are Swell'd, all's Ravag'd far; And I too Triumph in the Spoyls of War. Sheath thy strong Sword, but Sheath it at thy Side, Be thou the Guard of Albion, I the Guide. Secure of reaping, labouring Hinds shall Sow, Corn with no Burthen, but its own, shall bow; And it shall never fall Unripen'd now. Safe in thy Fence, long shall it Laughing Stand, And, gently bowing, Court the Reaper's hand. Ceres shall pregnant Golden Crops afford, The Rustick hook edg'd by the Souldier's Sword, [Bell.] Rather my Troopsturn Shephards peacefull swains, And where they Conquer'd, now Manure the Plains. At work, the Hinds of Foes shall hear them tell, Thus, thus, they Struck, and thus the others Fell. How did Rome's great Dictator Quinctius bow. He stoop'd to Fight, but Triumph'd to the Plow. How did bold Cadmus Till the patient Earth, And to a warlike Troop give suddain Birth; So may my Forces make kind Tellus bear, And, when Occasion serves, start up to War. [Ast.] Must then the fam'd Brittannia's glory sleep, And Men who sought like Lyons, look to Sheep. O poor Reward for labours, labours lost, Must Souldiers boast to Hinds, and only boast. The mighty Rustick's fame too far you Spread, Who chose to Plow rather than Fight for Bread. Of Cadmus army sprung from Earth you tell; Think, how that Earth-born Army quickly fell. The grov'ling Heroes, not inur'd to Foes, Serv'd but to fat those Furrows, whence they rose. Peasants unus'd to the Alarms of War, Rather would Dye at home, than Conquer far. Let every Artist have his Task assign'd, The fruitfull Earth be harrow'd by the Kind, Let Seamen steer, and watch the changing Wind. In his own Element give each his right, Let Tradesmen gain, and let the souldier Fight. [Bell.] But now the sound of Thund'ring Battel's o're, Soft Peace flows in, let Souldiers be no more. Let me and mine be Banish'd from your Isle, Dwell you in slumbers, free'd from Warlike toyl; Smile on your flow'ry Lawns, and fragrant Meads, All must be Happy where Astræa treads. [Ast.] The mighty Chief, who triumph'd o're the Ball, Kept up those Armies who had Vanquish'd all. Allways in Posture to resist a Foe, So he Gain'd conquests, he Maintain'd them So. They, whom no Quarrells, no disputes divide, Bear still their faithfull Guardian at their side. They who give no Affront, fear no abuse, Wear Swords for ornament, if not for use, This all Brittannia's happy Sons confess, And is her Safety or her Honour less. Can there be one among Astrea's Friends, Who slights his Country, yet himself Defends. Stay then, Bellona, under my command, Thou art more safe than in a Forreign Land. Thy troops in others int'rests Joyn'd, my Pow'rs Might sue too late, and Pray in vain for Yours. Should you Insult Brittannia's Peacefull shore, How should I Court what I had Scorn'd before! O Albion, happy in your Pow'r remain, Prise high your Nassaw's his Astrea's raign. Confide in him! That's sure the Least you owe, And he who Sav'd you, your Defence shall grow. Reward his Souldiers for their Manly toyl. Crown them with Plenty on their Native soyl. Next to their Chief, load them, with Honours too, What could not Brittons led by Nassaw, do. Who, Mighty Prince! can Trace thy Actions o're, Heaven still contrives to make thy Blessings more, Thou now Confirm'st what thou hadst given before. The Guift encreasing seems for ever new, To You from Heav'n Insur'd, to Us from you. Maintain thy Force, to Earth and Seas give Law, And keep not Gallia but the World in awe, Thy pow'rs in Arms; what Mortall Foe shall dare Disturb their Peace, who can at will, make War. Wise is thy rule, as Neptune's o're the Seas, You who Calm'd storms would never Tempests raise. No vengefull Thunder unprovok'd will Fly, Tho' still 'tis Temper'd in the gloomy Sky. When Earth's proud Sons Olympus did invade, Heav'n had been Sack'd, had not Jove's bolts been Made FINIS.</field>
