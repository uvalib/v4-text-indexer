      <field name="fulltext">TO THE RIGHT Honorable the Lady Lucie Comptesse of BEDFORD. To the right Noble and Vertuous Ladie, Lucie Comptesse of BEDFORD. G. Eastland. To I. Dowlands Lute. Lvte arise and charme the aire, Vntill a thousand formes shee beare, Coniure them all that they repaire, Into the circles of hir eare, Euer to dwell in concord there, By this thy tunes may haue accesse, Euen to hir spirit whose flowring treasure, Doth sweetest Harmonie expresse, Filling all eares and hearts with pleasure On earth, obseruing heauenly measure, Right well can shee Iudge and defend them, Doubt not of that for shee can mend them. I. [I Saw my Lady weepe]The following poems are scored for music in the source text. Where poems are not stanzaic, no attempt has been made to capture the metrical lines. Variations for different voices have been ignored. Repetition marks have been ignored. To the most famous, Anthony Holborne. I Saw my Lady weepe I Saw my Lady weepe, And sorrow proud to bee aduanced so: In those faire eies, where all perfections keepe, Hir face was full of woe, full of woe, but such a woe, beleeue me as wins more hearts, Then mirth can doe, with hir, in tysing parts. Sorow was there made faire, And passion wise, eares a delightfull thing, Silence beyond all speech a wisdome rare, Shee made hir sighes to sing, And all things with so sweet a sadnesse moue, As made my heart at once both grieue and loue. O fayrer then ought ells, The world can shew, leaue of in time to grieue, Inough, inough, your ioyfull lookes excells, Teares kills the heart belieue, O striue not to bee excellent in woe, Which onely breeds your beauties ouerthrow. II. Flow my teares fall from your springs Lacrime. Flow my teares fall from your springs Flow my teares fall from your springs, Exilde for euer: Let mee morne where nights black bird hir sad infamy sings, there let mee liue forlorne. Downe vainelights shine you no more, No nights are duk enough for those that in dispaire their Last fortuns deplore, light doth but shame disclose. Neuer may my woes be relieued, since pittie is fled, and teares, and sighes, and grones my wearie dayes, of all ioyes haue depriued. Fr? the highest spire of contentment, my fortune is throwne, and feare, and griefe, and paine for my deserts, are my hopes since hope is gone. Harke you shadowes that in darcknesse dwell, learne to contemne light, Happie, happie they that in hell feele not the worlds despite. III. Sorrow sorrow stay, lend true repentant teares Sorrow sorrow stay, lend true repentant teares Sorrow sorrow stay, lend true repentant teares, to a woefull, wretched wight, hence, dispaire with thy tormenting feares: doe not, O doe not my heart poore heart affright, pitty, help now or neuer, mark me not to endlesse paine, alas I am c?dempne'd, I am condempned euer, no hope, no help, ther doth remaine, but downe, down, down, down I fall, downe and arise, I neuer shall. IIII. Dye not beefore thy day Dye not beefore thy day Dye not beefore thy day, poore poore man condemned, But lift thy low lookes, from the humble earth, Kisse not dispaire &amp; see sweet hope contemned: The hag hath no delight, but mone but mone for mirth, O fye poore fondling, fie fie be willing, to preserue thy self from killing: Hope thy keeper glad to free thee, Bids thee goe and will not see thee, hye thee quickly from thy wrong, so shee endes hir willing song. V Mourne, mourne, day is with darknesse fled Mourne, mourne, day is with darknesse fled Mourne, mourne, day is with darknesse fled, what heauen then gouernes earth, ô none, but hell in heauens stead, choaks with his mistes our mirth. Mourne mourne, looke now for no more day nor night, but that from hell, Then all must as they may in darkenesse learne to dwell. But yet this change, must needes change our delight, that thus the Sunne, the Sun should harbour with the night. VI. Times eldest sonne, olde age the heyre of ease Times eldest sonne Times eldest sonne, olde age the heyre of ease, Str?gths foe, loues woe, and foster to deuotion, bids gallant youths in marshall prowes please, as for himselfe, hee hath no earthly motion, But thinks sighes, teares, vowes, praiers, and sacrifices, As good as showes, maskes, iustes, or tilt deuises. VII. Second part. Then sit thee downe, and say thy Nunc Demittis Then sit thee downe, and say thy Nunc Demittis Then sit thee downe, and say thy Nunc Demittis, with De profundis, Credo, and Te Deum, Chant Miserere for what now so fit is, as that, or this, Paratum est cor meum, O that thy Saint would take in worth thy hart, thou canst not please hir with a better part. VIII. Third part. When others sings Venite exultemus When others sings Venite exultemus When others sings Venite exultemus, stand by and turne to Noli emulari, For quare fremuerunt vse oremus Viuat Eliza, Viuat Eliza, For an aue mari, and teach those swains that liues about thy cell, to say Amen Amen when thou dost pray so well. Heere endeth the Songs of two parts. IX. [Praise blindnesse eies, for seeing is deceit] Praise blindnesse eies, for seeing is deceit, Bee dumbe vaine tongue, words are but flattering windes, Breake hart &amp; bleed for ther is no receit, To purge inconstancy from most mens mindes. Lenuoy: And so I wackt amazd and could not moue, I know my dreame was true, and yet I loue. And if thine eares false Haralds to thy hart, Conuey into thy head hopes to obtaine, Then tell thy hearing thou art deafe by art, Now loue is art that wonted to be plaine, Now none is bald except they see his braines, Affection is not knowne till one be dead, Reward for loue are labours for his paines, Loues quiuer made of gold his shafts of leade. And so I wackt, &amp;c. X. [O sweet woods the delight of solitarinesse] To Maister Hugh Holland. O sweet woods the delight of solitarinesse, O how much doe I loue your solitarinesse. From fames desire, from loues delight retir'd, In these sad groues an Hermits life I led, And those false pleasures which I once admir'd, With sad remembrance of my fall, I dread, To birds, to trees, to earth, impart I this, For shee lesse secret, and as sencelesse is. Experience which repentance onely brings, Doth bid mee now my hart from loue estrange, Loue is disdained when it doth looke at Kings, And loue loe placed base and apt to change: Ther power doth take from him his liberty, Hir want of worth makes him in cradell die. O sweet woods, &amp;c. O how much, &amp;c. You men that giue false worship vnto Loue, And seeke that which you neuer shall obtaine, The endlesse worke of Sisiphus you procure, Whose end is this to know you striue in vaine, Hope and desire which now your Idols bee, You needs must loose and feele dispaire with mee. O sweet woods, &amp;c. O how much, &amp;c. You woods in you the fairest Nimphs haue walked, Nimphes at whose sight all harts did yeeld to Loue, You woods in whom deere louers oft haue talked, How doe you now a place of mourning proue, Wansted my Mistres saith this is the doome, Thou art loues Childbed, Nursery, and Tombe. O sweet woods, &amp;c. O how much, &amp;c. XI. [If fluds of teares could cleanse my follies past] If fluds of teares could cleanse my follies past, And smoakes of sighes might sacrifice for sinne, If groning cries might salue my fault at last, Or endles mone, for error pardon win, Then would I cry, weepe, sigh, and euer mone, Mine errors, fault, sins, follies past and gone. I see my hopes must wither in their bud, I see my fauours are no lasting flowers, I see that woords will breede no better good, Then losse of time and lightening but at houres, Thus when I see then thus I say therefore, That fauours hopes and words, can blinde no more. XII. [Fine knacks for ladies, cheape choise braue and new] Fine knacks for ladies, cheape choise braue and new, Good penniworths but mony cannot moue, I keepe a faier but for the faier to view, A begger may bee liberall of loue, Though all my wares bee trash the hart is true, The hart is true, The hart is true. Great gifts are guiles and looke for gifts againe, My trifles come, as treasures from my minde, It is a precious Iewell to bee plaine, Sometimes in shell th'orienst pearles we finde, Of others take a sheafe, of mee a graine, Of mee a graine, Of mee a graine. Within this packe pinnes points laces &amp; gloues, And diuers toies fitting a country faier, But my hart where duety serues and loues, Turtels &amp; twins, courts brood, a heauenly paier, Happy the hart that thincks of no remoues, Of no remoues, Of no remoues. XIII. [Now cease my wandring eies] Now cease my wandring eies, Strange beauties to admire, In change least comfort lies, Long ioyes yeeld long desire. One faith one loue, Makes our fraile pleasures eternall And in sweetnesse proue. New ioyes, are still with sorrow declining, unto deep anoies. One man hath but one soule, Which art cannot deuide, If all one soule must loue, Two loues most be denide, One soule one loue, By faith and merit vnited cannot remoue, Distracted spirits, Are euer changing &amp; haplesse in their delights. Nature two eyes hath giuen, All beautie to impart, Aswell in earth as heauen, But she hath giuen one hart, That though wee see, Ten thousand beauties yet in vs one should be, One stedfast loue, Because our harts stand fixt although our eies do moue. XIIII. [Come yee heauy states of night] Come yee heauy states of night, Doe my fathers spirit right, Soundings balefull let mee borrow, Burthening my song with sorrow, Come sorrow come hir eis that sings, By thee are turned into springs. Come you Virgins of the night, That in Dirges sad delight, Quier my Anthems, I doe borrow Gold not pearle, but sounds of sorrow: Come sorrow come hir eies that sings, By thee are tourned into springs. XV. [White as Lillies was hir face] [1] White as Lillies was hir face, When she smiled, She beeguiled, Quitting faith with foule disgrace, Vertue seruice thus neglected, Heart with sorrowes hath infected. 2 When I swore my hart hir owne, Shee disdained, I complained, Yet shee left mee ouerthrowen, Careles of my bitter groning, Ruthlesse bent to no relieuing. 3 Vowes and oaths and faith assured, Constant euer, Changing neuer, Yet shee could not bee procured, To beleeue my paines exceeding, From hir scant neglect proceeding. 4 Oh that Loue should haue the art, By surmises, And disguises, To destroy a faithfull hart, Or that wanton looking women, Should reward their friends as foemen. 5 All in vaine is Ladies loue, Quickly choosed, Shortly loosed, For their pride is to remoue, Out alas their looks first won vs, And their pride hath straight vndone vs. 6 To thy selfe the sweetest faier, Thou hast wounded, And confounded, Changles faith with foule dispaier, And my seruice hath enuied, And my succours hath denied. 7 By thine error thou hast lost, Hart vnfained, Truth vnstained, And the swaine that loued most, More assured in loue then many, More dispised in loue then any, 8 For my hart though set at nought, Since you will it, Spoile and kill it, I will neuer change my thoughts, But grieue that beautie ete was borne. XVI. [Wofull hart with griefe oppressed] Wofull hart with griefe oppressed, Since my fortunes most distressed, From my ioyes hath mee remoued, Follow those sweet eies adored, Those sweet eyes wherein are stored, All my pleasures best beeloued. Fly my breast, leaue mee forsaken, Wherein Griefe his seate hath taken, All his arrowes through mee darting, Thou maist liue by hir Sunne-shining, I shall suffer no more pining, By thy losse, then by hir parting. XVII. [A shepheard in a shade, his plaining made] A shepheard in a shade, his plaining made, Of loue and louers wrong, Vnto the fairest lasse, That trode on grasse, And thus beegan his song. Restore, restore my hart againe, Which loue by thy sweet lookes hath slaine, Least that inforst by your disdaine, I sing, Fye fye on loue, it is a foolish thing. Since loue and Fortune will, I honour still, Your faire and louely eye, What conquest will it bee, Sweet Nimph for thee, If I, for sorrow dye. Restore, restore my hart againe, Which loue by thy sweet lookes hath slaine, Least that inforst by your disdaine, I sing, Fye fye on loue, it is a foolish thing. My hart where haue you laid O cruell maide, To kill when you might saue, Why haue yee cast it sorth as nothing worth, Without a tombe or graue. O let it bee intombed and lye, In your sweet minde and memorie, Least I resound on euery warbling string, Fye fye on loue that is a foolish thing. XVIII. [Faction that euer dwels] Faction that euer dwels, In court where wits excells, Hath set defiance, Fortune and loue hath sworne, That they were neuer borne, Of one aliance. 1 Fortune sweares, weakest harts The bookes of Cupids arts Turne with hir wheele, Sences themselues shall proue Venture hir place in loue Aske them that feele. 2 This discord it beget A theist that honour not Nature thought good, Fortune should euer dwell In court where wits excell Loue keepe the vvood. 3 So to the wood vvent I With loue to liue and die Fortune forlorne, Experience of my youth Made mee thinke humble truth In desert borne. 4 My saint is deere to mee, And lone hir selfe is shee Ione faier and true, Ione that doth euer moue, Passions of loue with loue Fortune adiew. XIX. [Shall I sue shall I seeke for grace?] [1] Shall I sue shall I seeke for grace? Shall I pray shall I proue? Shall I striue to a heauenly Ioy, With an earthly loue? Shall I think that a bleeding hart Or a wounded eie, Or a sigh can ascend the cloudes To attaine so hie. 2 Silly wretch forsake these dreames, of a vaine desire, O bethinke what hie regard, holy hopes doe require. Fauour is as faire as things are, treasure is not bought, Fauour is not wonne with words, nor the wish of a thought. 3 Pittie is but a poore defence, for a dying hart, Ladies eies respect no mone, in a meane desert. Shee is to worthie far, for a worth so base, Cruell and but iust is shee, in my iust disgrace. 4 Iustice giues each man his owne, though my loue bee iust, Yet will not shee pittie my griefe, therefore die I must, Silly hart then yeeld to die, perish in dispaire, Witnesse yet how faine I die, When I die for the faire. XX. [Tosse not my soule, O loue twixt hope and feare] for Finding in fields: ye shall finde a better dittie. Tosse not my soule, O loue twixt hope and feare, Shew mee some ground where I may firmely stand Or surely fall, I care not which apeare, So one will close mee in a certaine band. Lenuoy: When once of ill the vttermost is knowen, The strength of sorrow quite is ouer throwne. Take mee Assurance to thy blisfull holde, Or thou Despaire vnto thy darkest Cell, Each hath full rest, the one in ioyes enrolde, Th'other, in that hee feares no more, is well: When once the vttermost of ill is knowne, The strength of sorrow quite is ouerthrowne. The end of the foure parts. XXI. [Cleare or cloudie sweet as Aprill showring, ] Cleare or cloudie sweet as Aprill showring, Smoth or frowning So is hir face to mee, Pleasd or smiling like milde May all flowring, When skies blew silke and medowes carpets bee, Hir speeches notes of that night bird that singeth, Who thought all sweet yet larring notes outringeth. Hir grace like Iune, when earth and trees bee trimde, In best attire of compleat beauties height, Hir loue againe like sommers daies bee dimde, With little cloudes of doubtfull constant faith, Hir trust hir doubt, like raine and heat in Skies, Gently thundring, she lightning to mine eies. Sweet sommer spring that breatheth life and growing, In weedes as into hearbs and flowers, And sees of seruice diuers sorts in sowing, Some haply seeming and some being yours, Raine on your hearbs and flowers that truely serue, And let your weeds lack dew and duely sterue. XXII. [Humor say what mak'st thou heere] A Dialogue. Hvmor say what mak'st thou heere Hvmor say what mak'st thou heere, In the presence of a Queene, Thou art a heauy leaden moode Chorus: But neuer Humor yet was true, but that but that but that that that that that that that which onely onely pleaseth you. 1 O, I am as heauy as earth, Say then who is Humor now. 1 Why then tis I am drownde in woe, But neuer Humor, &amp;c. 1 Mirth then is drownde in sorrowes brim, Oh, in sorrow all things sleepe. 1 In hir presence all things smile, Humor frolike then a while. But neuer Humor, &amp;c. FINIS.</field>
