      <field name="fulltext">Dedicated TO HER ROYAL HIGHNESS THE DUCHESS OF YORK</field>
      <field name="fulltext">THE TENTH MUSE COMPOSED FOR A PRESS ANNIVERSARY I In stately classic time Who built the lofty rhymeâ While yet his hand wandered along the lyre, While the loud prelude lingered, And each quick string he fingered, Not finding fitting outburst of his fireâ Then would he raise First notes of prayer and praise To those great daughters of MnemosynÃ«â The high immortal Nineâ And, swift! the whispered line Leapt to his lip,âcommanding, sounding, free. II Yet I, to-day, Neither to praise nor pray, Sweet Muses! with your sacred names begin This, my unusual song; But if ye still live, strong, Somewhere on heights which poet's verse can reach; If still with mortal eyes ye may be seen By some new Hippocreneâ Some later, nearer AganippÃ«'s fountainâ Then listen, and with sister-arms en-ring Her whom we bring Up the steep slope of your celestial mountain. III Clio! whose tablets keepâ That Gods may laugh and weepâ Full record of men's wars and loves below; Euterpe! with the pipe Set to that rosebud ripe Of thy Greek mouth, some lovely strain to blow; Thalia! laughing as the stroller's task Fits on the comic mask; And sad Melpomene, with tragic eyes, And drawn glaive's glittering blade; Thou, too, Heav'n's pensive maid, Star-crowned Urania! rapt in mysteries! IV And thou, soft Erato! From throat of snow Murmuring a love-verse to the chorded shell; And grave CalliopÃ«, Of epic scrolls to be Deep-meditating how the strain shall swell; Polymnia! cheek on hand Pillowed, while slow and grand The storming organs thunder chant and hymn; TerpsichorÃ«! whose feet Shine whiter while they beat The white wind-flowers by Helicon's green rim. V With bended brow and knee Here bring we, fair to see, And grown to Grecian stateliness and grace, Her whom we serve alway By night, by day, In diverse tongues and many a peopled place: Not grudging among men From toil of brain and pen, The largest she shall ask us, nor the least, So praise come to her name, And power, and fame, And North and South may hail herâWest and East. VI High Muses! be not slow Her rights to know Who comes to sit on the Pierian Hill, Turning your Nine to Ten; Forâborn, albeit, of menâ She, by her high emprise, is Goddess still. The Tenth Muse treads to-day This lofty way, Not less than ye of Heav'nâdivine no less; Room! ye who proudly dwell Here on the asphodel! Your youngest sister greet, the modern PRESS. VII Nay! start not, Erato! Sweet music doth not flow Freer for thee than her, when she bids sing; And, Clio! look! she lacks Neither thy stele, nor wax, To write the tale of all things happening; Euterpe! piping softâ Thy chosen poets oft Pour their melodious souls upon her page; And, light Thalia! thou Dimpling such mouth and brow, Laugh'st side by side with her, on every stage. VIII Melpomene! to thine Her thoughts incline Where, o'er the boards, the tragic players pass When, in the mimic scene, Warrior, and knight, and queen, And woes, and wars, and fates their image glass; Like thee, by nightâby noonâ Of stars, and sun, and moon. The changeful march, Urania! she doth mark; With watchful gaze like thine Muse most divine! Our Lady's eyes shine brightest in the dark. IX CalliopÃ«! regard! Epic and lyric bard Take from her equal hand their laurel-crowns; Those she delights to praise Wear haughtily the bays, Go famous in a thousand towers and towns. Nor scorns our Mistress sweet The tripping feet Of such as worship glad TerpsichorÃ«; The choral song and dance, And woven steps that glance, And swimming limbs, her own gay business be. X Thenâdebonair, demure, In Vestal sindon pureâ With thine, Polymnia! all her mind grows Jove's; In temples, still and dim, She shares the mystic hymn; And puts by wars and crimes and shows and loves. Oh, make good place For our proud Lady's face In the undying circle of your beauty; For see, ye stately Nine! No art, nor charge divine, No gift, nor grace there is, but falls into her duty. XI Aye, Muses! more than this! She whom your lips must kiss, Your new-crowned Sister of this later day, She you shall takeâ For all the people's sakeâ Into your high-born company; and say âEphemera! be free Of heavenly airs, as we!â This sleepless Lady whom her true scribes loveâ A greater purpose holds, A larger deed unfolds, A mightier mandate bears from will of Jove. XII So, if there do remain Some little sable stain On this white faithful hand, these fingers slender, As beautiful as wine Crims'ning a wrist divine, Rosier than rose-leaf on the snow, more tender Than tears on silken lid Those ink-marks deem! Nay, bid Our pale Queen welcome! think her worthy glory Whoâwatchful, night by nightâ For human help and light Sits by her whirling wheels, spinning the wide world's story. XIII The wide world's friend is she With tireless eyes which see Whatever anywhere befalls; with ears Opened, by night, by day, To what men do or say, All the far echoes of all months and years. And what she learns alone Swiftly she maketh known With voice majestic, world-extending, high; So that the rolling sea Hath not a tongue more free, Nor more all-covering is the arching sky. XIV Also her heart is set On hopes, undreamed of yet By those who worshipped once, old bards and sages;â The onward march of Man From what began His uprise, to the goal of all the Ages. The peoples of the plain Your Gods did once disdain From ledge of haught Olympus, 'mid their clouds, For them our Mistress hath Large pity; and hot wrath 'Gainst such as scorn and slight her patient crowds. XV To minister to these 'Neath all the roaring seas, Her messengers, tamed lightnings, come and go; O'er all the busy lands Her duteous eyes and hands Gather up knowledge, that the people know. From them she hath her power, And hour by hour To them she payeth back her debt of greatness, Accomplishing full score With blessings more and more, And service wrought in silence and sedateness. XVI And if, indeed, her hand Wieldeth no fiery brand To strike oppression down, stay the wrong-doer, Chastise the wicked law, And guilty plunder draw From wealthy robbers, and be swift pursuer Of crime and guile; alway, To seize, and smite, and slay, Muses! this plumÃ¨d quill which she doth bear Is keener in the strife, Strikes closer to the life, Than sword of Themis, or AthenÃ«'s spear. XVII Of this the subtle point Pierceth each armour-joint In rich rogues' pride, and evil men's contriving; There stands no shame so strong It shall, for long, Make head against our Lady's ceaseless striving; For, clad in living light, 'Gainst Darkness does she fight; And girt with Knowledge, Ignorance she chases; High Muses! welcome herâ Our World's Interpreterâ Glad and caressing to your heavenly Places. XVII So, in the sacred ranks, For all men's love and thanks, Ephemera, Tenth Muse, sits safe to-day, Our Lady of the Lamp, Whom we, of many a camp, Serve dailyâfor her work's sakeâand obey; Not holding any grace or any gift Too precious to uplift In homage to her; deeming all her right; Nor ever once ashamed So we be named Press-men; Slaves of the Lamp; Servants of Light. THE PASSING OF MUHAMMAD PROPHET OF ARABIA A Dramatic sketch The scene is in the house of Ayesha, Muhammad's favourite wife, at Medina; the date being the month of June,A.D. 632. Muhammad is lying on his bed, sick unto death; his wives, with some other Arab women, attending him.Ayesha By God! we never looked that he should lie This way, like others; weak, and lean, and cold; Moaning in mortal pain, whom we did know The Prophet of the Lord. Maimuna! drive The green fly from his brow! Dost thou recall, Thou, Salma's sister! what a brow it was, How lordly, with its blue vein swollen big When he was wroth, or unbelievers irked? What eyes these sealed eyes were, so keen and stern, That day, the eighth of Dzul Hijj, when we went The pilgrimage to Mecca, we his wives, And five score cattle for the sacrifice, He in the front of all, by Bital led, Riding Al Kaswa (that good beast which found The desert-well, and knelt at Kaaba, Dropped in the season when he wedded thee?) Was it not like to locust-swarms?âthe folk Hung round Mohassir, and on Arafat, Glad eager masses, while he stood aloftâ As 'twere the Angel of the Seal, methoughtâ In Mina, saying aloud: âI have fulfilled The Message! I have left amidst ye here A plain command, the Book of Allah! This If ye hold fast, shall guide aright your feet.â And, lifting up his gaze, he spake aloud: âSee, Lord! I have delivered all Thy will; Witness it for me!â Then what thunder rolled From forty thousand scores of tongues which cried: âAye! Of a truth thou hast!â Did we not deem He clomb too near to heav'n in those great hours Ever to fall like this to us and death? By Allah! have ye thought it could be so?Maimuna. Nay, and how bright with life this wan cheek was When he came back from Mecca, all his heart Full of God's peace; the seven due circuits done, The Zemzem-water quaffed, and each thing set In just ensample for the days to be When all men wend to Mecca! Ayesha! Thou wert on Arafat that dawn he spake The sunrise prayerâand afterwards the verse From his fifth Sura: âThis day have I made Truth finished for ye; this day have fulfilled My mercy toward ye; this day do appoint Islam your faith for ever.â Oh, that night I did not dare caress him when he passed Into my tent; I let the date-water Spill from my leathern-bowl, afeard to speak, He was so rapt. I chafed his feet, and dropped My eyesâashamed of such far-seeing eyes.Asma (sister to Maimuna). For me, I held him most majestical, Surest of years, that day when ZeÃ¯d's son OsÃ¢ma, took command for Syria. How, like a conqueror, did our Lord unroll The banner of black wool, and bind the sword Which flashed at Beder, on OsÃ¢ma's thigh, Saying: âFight thou with this, under my flag, In Allah's name for Allah's truth, and smite, And break the unbelievers!â Then, indeed, Who would have dreamed our Master nigh to death?Ayesha. Yet he fell sick next night. Oh, had we marked, There lacked not signs. Fatma! bear'st thou in mind How Abu Bekr met him two moons back In the Mosque-gate, and, noting that his beard Grizzled amid its flowing ravenâspake Full sorrowfully, in a sudden grief: âThouâwho than father or than mother art More dear to allâalack! I see grey hairs Are hastening in upon thee!â and his eyes Brimmed with quick tear-drops. For, the Prophet raised With both thin hands his beard, gazing thereon, And answered: âYea! 'tis travail of the Word Hath wrought deep signs upon me: night and day The saying of the âSuras Terrible,â âHud,â and âThe Striking,â and âThe Inevitable,â Have burned my strength to ashes.âFatma. Yes! 'twas so; Yet sought we ever what might bring him rest; His uncle Abbas, seeing how the folk Thronged round him in the Mosque, said, âIf we build A lofty seat for thee, they shall not throng.â But sweet reply our Lord gave: âKinsman kind! I will not cease from moving in their midst, Dragging my abbas through the press of them, My feet stained with their dust, till Allah's call Bring me my time of peace.âAyesha. Ah, Fatma! moist His lips with honey, for I think they move, And, peradventure, 'twill be Allah's will This weakness shall go by. Yet, latterly Of times he did recite, as if 'twere due, That Sura which doth say: âWhen God's help comes And victory, and thou shalt see all tribes Entering by troops the gateways of the Faith, Then celebrate the praises of thy Lord, And seek His mercy Who is merciful.âFatma. Aunt! When that same great Sura was writ down, He called me; spake to me with quiet eyes, âMy daughter! it is opened I shall die.â At which hard word mine eyes broke into floods Like rain on Yemen in the sowing time. But he said softly: âNay! KhadÃ®ja's child! Weep not; be comforted; since, verily Thou shalt join first with me in Paradise.â Thereat no more I wept, but in my heart Joy gleamed like sun-breaks when the showers are done.Maimuna. Most happy Fatma! if it were to me He had spoke so, this sorrow would not lie Crushing my heart, as when her too great load Keeps crooked the camel's knee. I, too,recall Howâwhen it was my night, and naught he loved Soothed him, not date-cakes, nor the rabab's string, Nor perfumes of the myrrh and ambergris, Nor kissesâand ye women know he liked Women and scents and sweetsâhe rose from me, Wrapped his striped izar-cloth about his head, And, lifting up the inner curtain, paced Into the jewelled stillness of the night. With fearful steps I dared to follow him. Ah, Sisters! not to spy! solicitous Lest wandering beast or sinful robber hurt The Prophet of the Lord. But he came straight, Quick-striding, resolute, to where our dead Sleep by the city-wall. There, 'mid the tombs, Long leaned he on his cedar-staff, intent, Deep meditating, silent. At the end A jackal barked; whereon, as if the cry Roused him, I heard him, in right gentle tones, Speak to the Dead: âVerily, ye and I Have found fulfilment of what Allah pledged; BlessÃ¨d are ye, and blessÃ¨d is your lot Beyond the lot of those left in this world! Sleep well, till God's great daybreak wakens you. O Lord! show mercy to these slumberers, And grant Thy grace to me!â At that he turned And hastened back with such assurÃ¨d strides Scarce I had space to outrun him, and to quench The kindled lamp, and cast my sandals by, And seem to slumber, when he crept again Chilled to my side, and whispered, âThis good night Allah hath proffered me which thing I wouldâ Long life, or else to meet my Lord betimes; And I have chosen very soon to die.âAyesha. That was the week my brows ached; and I moaned, âOh, head! my head!â not wotting he was nigh. Then entered he, his own brows knit with pain And lightly spake: â'Tis I might cry âmy head!â So bitter is this heat that scorcheth me! But thou, Omm Raman's child! were it not sweetâ If Allah willedâthou didst die first; so I That loved thee best, might speak the prayers for thee And wrap thee in thy grave-cloth, Ayesha! And lay thee safe, till I came too, Gazelle?â âNow God forbid!â quoth I, as who would turn A heaviness to merriment, âthy wish, I fear me, Prophet! is to find some eyes Brighter than Ayesha's, when I am gone, Giving the love that hath been mine to her.â But wistfully he smiled, and silent went.Maimuna. Yea! yea! we know he loved you best. You came New to him from the goat's milk, and child-games. But I, and Haphsa, Zeinab, and the rest Dwelled in the outer garden of his love. It was his wish: we grudge thee not; 'tis meet He lie now in thy chamber, Ayesha! Sinceâsave Khadidjaâthou in all these years Held his heart most. But, oh! take heed to him, He strives to speak! [Muhammad awakens. Muhammad. Ayesha! Ayesha! Hath yet OsÃ¢ma marched?Ayesha. My Lord! sweet Lord! He stands without, waiting to speak farewell.Muhammad. Cover your faces then, and bid him come. [OsÃ¢ma enters, and, kneeling by the couch, kisses the sick man's face.OsÃ¢ma. Prophet! how fierce a fever burneth thee!Muhammad. I swear by Him in whose hand lies my life There suffereth no Believer, but his woes Cause sins to shed away, as the hot wind Strips dead leaves off, that new green leaves may grow. I, here consuming, cheat my fever's flame Praising the Lord; but thou, why tarriest thou? Smite me the Unbelievers! Fall at dawn Upon those dogs of Obna! Let assault Clamour first tidings of thee! Send forth scouts, And Allah give thee victory! Guide my palm That I may lay it on thy head, and leave A blessing there. Go in God's peace! [OsÃ¢ma departs. My girl! Where is that gold I gave into thy hands? Part it among the âpeople of the Bench,â Heav'n's poor ones.Ayesha. Master! 'tis the last we have; We owe for wood and sesamum.Muhammad. Give! give! That were ill-done if I should meet my Lord With dinars in my hand. Maimuna! reach My izar down. I hear the Muazzan Calling to prayer! Ya! ya! Ash 'had do an La illah 'l-lul-la-ho. Ye faithful! know There is no God save God: hya-ul-as-salaat! Wend unto prayer! [A pause, while he tries to rise.] Nay, nay! I have not force! I cannot stand! this fever burns my brain; Lay me once more upon the camel-skin.Ayesha. Sweet Lord! thou doest ill to vex thy strength. Enough is wrought. Ah, rest! Saith not the Book, âWe have forgiven to thee all thy sins, The former and the latter.âMuhammad. Ayesha! Except God's mercy cover me with grace, I, that am called the Prophet of the Lord, I shall not enter into Paradise. Hath yet OsÃ¢ma marched? It will not ease, This fierce hot aching, till I hear his drums. Ah! set the door wide back; I faint! I faint!Maimuna. Make wet his holy lips with date-water, Zeinab! Fan quickly, Fatma! See, he swoons; Our Master's eyes are shut. He hath desired Too ardently to lead the evening prayer.Ayesha. 'Twas Monday's Azan brought him to first point Of mortal feebleness.Zeinab. I did not know; How fell that, Abu Bekr's daughter?Ayesha. Weakâ Though not, as now, to edge of deathâhe lay. And I, who oft before, in time of strait, Heard him ask Allah for deliverance, Knelt heartsick by the bed, because he prayed, Saying, âO Soul! my Soul! why seekest thou Another refuge save in God alone?â 'Twas then that first he no more craved to live.Zeinab. Inshallah!Ayesha. But the morn broke, rose and gold, And the cool air was like a spring to drink, While, in the ways, the footfalls of the folk Made clatter, and the pigeons on the roof Cooed, and the well-ropes creaked, awakening him. So, stronger for his sleep, andâhearing then, As now, the Muazzanâhe would arise And gird himself to go. My father served ImÃ¢m that day, and told us what befell.Zeinab. Impart it, Sister!Ayesha. All the Mosque was filled To its corner flag-stones; and the first rakaat Was finished; and the people stood to make The second form; when our Lord entered in, His arm about the neck of Abba's son. Then, in the House of God, that weakness fled; Glad grew his face; his wan lips warmed; he said Softly to Fadhl, âAllah granteth me Cooling of eyes by this good breath of prayer.â And the folk parted on the right and left To make way for him to the Mimbar-rail, Where Abu Bekr would have yielded place, But our Lord motioned âno,â and on the mats Sate, till my father ended morning-prayer. Then he arose, and while the eyes of men Fed on his looks, and eager fingers caught His robe's hem to fond lipsâhe cried aloud, The fever crimson in his cheek, his mouth Dry with the blast of Death, and this dear front Shadowed with Azrael's over-hanging wing; Aye!âAbu Bekr saidâhe gazed around And spake:âMen of Medina, where I lived Coming and going, testifying God, I shall die soon. I pray ye answer me, Is there among ye here one I have wronged? I have borne rule, judging in Allah's name, That am a man, and sinful; have I judged Unrighteously or wrathfully, or pressed Too hard in the amend? Let who saith âyeaâ Make his âyeaâ good before the people here And I will bare my back that he may smite. I have borne testimony for the truth, Not sparing sinners: speak, if there be one Wronged by my hid misdoing; let him shame His Prophet now, telling the ill I wrought Before the Assembly. I have gathered dues, Declare if I defrauded any here Buying or selling.â And no answer came Except the noise of sobs and weeping men, Because our Lord spake thus. But one arose, A hamal, with his cord across his back And porter's knot (Zeinab! thou knowest him, 'Tis Hassan, from the last shop in the lane Behind the Mosque), who cried:âAbdullah's son, Three silver pieces owest thou to me For wood I bore thee after Ramadhan.â And softly said our Lord,âGood friend! much thanks Because thou didst demand thy money now, And not before the judgment-seat of God. Ill is it if men thither carry debts.â Therewith he paid that debt, kissing the hand Wherein the dirhams dropped; and so came home To lay his head upon my lap; my lap. But, Zeinab, look! Maimuna, look! our Lord Stirreth anew! What saith he? let me come! Ayesha's ear shall knowâ [Kneeling at the bedside. 'Tis Ayesha Hearkens, dear Master!Muhammad. Give me drink, my girl! Hath yet OsÃ¢ma marched? Be those his drums? I dieâat last I die! breathe on my eyes And chafe my hands. Well know I that I die. Listen! this for thine earâfor thee aloneâ [He whispers. Three days agone Allah's high messenger Came to meâGabrielâand he asked of me, âServant of God! how is it with thee here?â âTrouble is with me, and sore agony,â Replied I. Then he spake,âA little while Have patience;â and departed. Once again With selfsame speech he came, enquired; and I With the same words made answer. And again Even now, whilst ye did watch, th' Archangel stood Here, in thy room,âanother shining one Behind him,âand he said,âServant of God! This is the Lord of Death, dread Azrael, He hath not sought before from any man Leave to come in, and never afterwards Shall seek from anyâbut to-day he stands Waiting thy pleasure; suffer that he come.â Then spake I,âEnter, Allah's Messenger!â And Azrael said:âMuhammad, I am sent To take thy soul, if so thou wilt; or else, If so thou wilt, to leave thee whole again. I that command, am at command of thee.â Whereon a little pondering I was 'ware Of Gabriel's whisper:âVerily, our Lord Desireth thee.â And thereupon I spake, âDo thou the will of Allah, Azrael!â [A pause.Zeinab. What saith he, Ayesha?Ayesha. Be still, be still! O Prophet of the Lord! O Master, stay.Muhammad. No! take thy lips awayâthey cannot help! Speak, if thou canst, my Sura writ for death:â Kiss me no more, I say; Azrael's mouth Is on my lips. O Allah! pardon me! Join me with the companionship on high! Hist! I see Paradise! Ah, Gabriel! lend Thy hand a little more. I testify There is no God but God! [He dies.Ayesha. Now, women, cry! Gone! our resource, our glory! Wel-wel-eh! Our Lord is dead and gone! A-lal-lal-lai! ON THE DEATH OF LORD TENNYSON No âmoaning of the bar!â Compare Lord Tennyson's late poem:ââAnd may there be no moaning of the bar When I put out to sea.â Sail forth, strong Ship! Into that gloom which has God's face for far light; Not dirge, but proud farewell, from each fond lip; And praiseâabounding praise; and fame's faint starlight Lamping thy tuneful soul to that large noon Where thou shalt quire with angels. Words of woe Are for the unfulfilledânot thee, whose moon Of genius sinks full-orbed, glorious, aglow. No âmoaning of the bar!â Musical drifting Of Time's waves, turning to the Eternal Sea; Death's soft wind all thy gallant canvas lifting, And Christ thy Pilot to the Peace to be. October 6, 1892. WRITTEN IN THE BIRTHDAY BOOK OF H.R.H. THE DUCHESS OF YORK (THEN PRINCESS VICTORIA MARY OF TECK)The Princess bids me write! what happy wit Were fair enough this fair page to befit? In Gulistan there lived a nightingale Who, in 'mid singing, felt his music fail, And said:âTo Roses I make melody, But, Rose of Roses!

CRATHIE CHURCH WRITTEN FOR THE ROYAL BAZAAR AT BALMORAL (At desire of H.R.H. The Princess BEATRICE) Far back in memory's vistasâfar! I mind a day when, to Braemar From Ballater, by winding Dee, Two college-comrades walked with me. We tramped by bridge, and birk, and cairn; Looked down Glen Muick and wild Glen Gairn; Passed Craigendarroch's hanging glade, Nor at grey Abergeldie stayed; Till, on the right,âere you espy Balmoral's turrets break the skyâ There rose, 'mid rowan-trees and birch, The plain front of a parish church, So lowly, featureless, and mean, That when one said,â'Tis where the Queen Goes to her prayers,â the other cried, âThat Crathie? on yon mountain side Of Lochnagar, purple and blue, A stately shrine should soar to view Fitter for kneeling Majesty! You lassie! Can this really be Our Queen's church?ââ To a Highland maid So he put question; and she said: âIt's Crathie Kirk! the door's nae steek'd, Gang in, and when ye weel have keeked For the Queen's pewâgin ye sall look, Ye'll see her cushion and her book!â So those pass in. But Iâless bold, Or more contemplativeâwithhold My soiled shoes from that sacred floor, Waiting beside the open door. Whereat the lassie, wondering, says: âWull you na' see where the Queen prays?â I called her near and took her hand, And said:âHow shall you understand, My little maid, what makes me wait Content, apart, outside this gate? Yet, listen! In the Indian land Where many a splendid mosque doth stand, One, I remember, white as snow, Supremely reared, above, below, With domes which in the blue air rise Like rounded clouds; and rich device Of plinth and frieze; and minarets Piercing the sky; and diamond jets Of fountains; and a sweeping flight Of stairs laid broad with lazulite And jasper slabs, leading the feet To where, beneath the porch, 'tis meet Men put aside their slippers. There, Written upon the marble clear, In Persian letters, one might read IHTIRÃM,âword for âTake thou heed!â âWhat made them write it?â I will say:â 'Twas there that Akbar came to pray: Akbar the Great, in Agra King, Lord of the East, all-conquering. One day his stately head he bent Within that marble mosque, intent The names of Allah to intone,â Ninety and nineâfor each, one stone Upon his turquoise rosary; And next, upon his face, to be Suppliant of Heaven for grace and peace On India, and his Realm's increase; With happy issue of that war His Moslem Omrahs waged afar. Then, while the wise Prince prayed, there came One of his captains, like a flame Of gold and jewels, from the field Bringing great news. The foe did yield; The mighty forts had fall'n; the towns Opened, with spoil of thrones and crowns; So, loud he cried:âShow me the King! Since goodly tidings do I bring.â And to the nail his Arab tied, Taking the steps at one great stride. But the blind porter at the gate Crossed his palm-staff, and murmured:âWait! Whate'er thy news! Akbar is met Inside with Allah! weightier yet Than any words of man can be, Or noise of earthly victory, Is what the King speaks in this place For him and us, and what the grace Of Heaven may answer. Take not thou Taint of thy worldly doings now Into such presence.â So that Lord Unbuckled shield, and helm, and sword, And sate, awaiting, meek. And there Upon the marbleâclear and fair In silver scriptâthey did inlay âIHTIRÃM,â and that word doth say:â âHere halted, out of modesty, The herald, e'en of victory.ââ Her blue eyes opened all their blue: But still, I think, she partly knew Why I, one of those English three, The Church of Crathie did not see.11th June 1894. THE STORY OF THE SNAKE BEING THE DOCTRINE OF KARMA (Translated from the Sanskrit of the MahÃ¢bhÃ¢rata) The following translation from the Sanskrit of what has never yet been placed before Western eyes, opens one of the most curious and striking passages of the many which are to be met with in that alternately wonderful and monstrous âMahÃ¢bhÃ¢rata,â the chief epic poem of India, out of the heart whereof, like gold from a prodigious mountain, I myself have many a time carried away poetic spoil. The passage occurs in the beginning of the AnushÃ¢sana Parva, the thirteenth book of this vast epic, and treats upon the eternal problem opened by âthose eighteen upon whom the Tower of Siloam fell.â Whence is it that we suffer? Why is it that we inflict upon each other, or upon ourselves, unnumbered woes, sometimes willingly, sometimes involuntarily? What is the origin, after all, of evil? An answer is given from the Vedantic period to such questions in this remarkable section of the AnushÃ¢sana, which must be ancient, and may be far older than Christianity. The character of the Sanskrit text hereabouts is certainly not to be distinguished from portions clearly authentic, known to be written more than two thousand years ago, and in any case the passage deserves to be made known to Western thinkers, if only for its strange dramatic metaphysics. After commencing with the usual invocation to Narayan and Nara, and to the goddess Saraswati, the book opens with a speech from the Prince Yudhisthira, addressing the hero Bhishma, who is lying wounded to death upon a bed of arrow-points, vanquished in war by Yudhisthira himself, the most virtuous and the most valiant of the Pandavas. The Prince, great in mind and good of heart, is grieved at the sight of his suffering enemy. He reproaches himself bitterly for having brought about the downfall of so renowned a warrior. In his distress and remorse, he wishes that he himself had fallen upon the field along with the vanquished. It is characteristic of this interminable Hindoo poem that immensely long episodes are introduced at moments when modern poetic art would demand swift and continuous action, or succession of events. Bhishma, dying on his hard battle bed, has already discoursed upon various topics at enormous length. Yet when Prince Yudhisthira implores some spiritual comfort so that his perturbed soul may recover itself from deep remorse and be cleansed from what the Prince thinks is sin, Bhishma proceeds to relate to him the apologue here transcribed, freely but faithfully, from the Sanskrit text. Bhishma. Why, happy Prince! wilt thou so deem thy soul Cause of its actions, seeing that thy soul Is instrument, not cause? That this stands true Sense cannot learn, being too deep a thing, Too imperceptible. Yet, on such head Hear thou a bygone story of the talk Held between Mrityu and Gautami, And KÃ¢la, and the Fowler, and the Snake. Know, Kunti's son! the lady Gautami Was of a governed and a tranquil mind: One day she saw her only son fall dead Bit by a serpent, which a fowler seizedâ By name Arjunakoâand bound that worm With knotted string, and brought to Gautami, Saying,âThis cursÃ¨d snake hath been the means Of thy son's death, most noble lady! Speak; Say swiftly how the wretch should be destroyed. Were't better that I fling it in the flames, Or hack it into gobbets. Of a truth This base destroyer of thy child must die.âGautami. Arjunako! Thou understandest ill; Set free the serpent. Thee it hath not wronged, But only me. And who will dare contemn The unshunnÃ¨d law that measures harm for harm, Sinking their souls to darkness by sin's load? Look! like a ship that bravely breasts the wave, They that sail light by casting sins away Cross o'er the ocean of existence safe; But they that take for cargo evil deeds, Go to the bottom, as its iron head Drags down a spear in water. Killing this Will not bring back my boy; letting it live Doth thee and me no harm. Why should we earn Death for ourselves, dooming the snake to death?The Fowler. Great lady! I have seen high-minded ones Knowing all truths, like thee, thus tender-souled Unto the meanest things that grieve. Such words Howbeit, suit best for those whose hearts are calm, Not for an angered man. I'll kill this snake. Let mild souls, if they may, write all debts down To Fate or Chance; but plain men right themselves By making foemen pay. What dream is here That we miss heaven by hurting such as hurt? See now, 'twill comfort thee if I stamp out The reptile's life.Gautami. If thou wert of my mood, 'Twould move thee otherwise. A good man's thought Meditates virtue always. This my child Was, woe is me! predestined unto death; Therefore I will not have thee slay the snake. Anger is poison; poison hurts. Good friend! Forgive as I forgive! Let the wretch go!The Fowler. Nay! nay! I say, by slaying him we earn Merit hereafter, great and measureless, Even as a man doth well and gaineth praise By sacrifices on the altar. Praise Is won, slaughtering a foe. Bid me to kill, And that shall bring us both credit and peace.Gautami. What comfort is there if we rack and slay An enemy? And what good were not lost By not releasing where we can release? Thou bear'st a goodly presence. Be thyself! Pardon this snake with me, and earn desert.The Fowler. One snake bites many a man. Let us protect The many from this one, preferring them. The righteous make the evil meet their doom, Now, therefore, bid me slay him.Gautami. Killing him, O Fowler! gives not life back to my son, Nor any other fruit save bitterness. Therefore, thou Man of Blood, let this beast go!The Fowler. By killing Vritra, DevarÃ¢j made gain, And dread MahÃ¢dev won his sacrifice. Do thou, like them, straightway destroy this worm Without misgivings. âNone the more for this,â Spake Bhishma,âdid the high-souled lady bend Her spirit to the sinful deed. Thereon The serpent, by the cord painfully bound, Hard-breathing, and sore-striving to be calm, Uttered these words, as men and women talk, Slowly and sorrowful.âThe Snake. Arjunako! What fault is mine in this, thou foolish one? No wit have I, nor of myself do act. 'Twas Mrityu sent me hither. By Death's word I bit this child, and not from choice of mine; So, Fowler, if sin be, the sin is Death's.The Fowler. If thou hast done this evil, set thereto By mandate of another, 'tis thy sin, Being the instrument. The potter moulds His pot of clay, but in that deed is helped By wheel and stick, which also of that pot Were causes. Thus art thou, Serpent, a cause. Who slays must die. Thou didst slay! 'Twas thy word. So will I slay thee.The Snake. But the potter's wheel, And stick, and all his gear, made not that pot; Only obeyed in making; helpless meansâ As I was helpless. Therefore, mighty Sir! No fault is mine in this, as thou should'st own. If otherwise thou deemest, then at worst Those were but causes working under cause, The greatest being the first. And, reckoned so, How am I guilty in this deed of death? Cause primary is guilty, if guilt be. Let potter speak for wheel!The Fowler. If not the head, Thou wert the hand in this: thine the fell fang That nipped this tender life. So thou shalt die! What, Serpent! think'st thou, when a wrong is done, The evil doer of the evil deed Stands not to pay therein? Prepare to die! Making no better plea.The Snake. My plea is good; Cause and effect have interholding links: I was but agent. If thou wilt see just, The sinfulness of this rests not on me But on the one that sent me.The Fowler. Wretched worm! Not meet to live. Thou glozing chatterer! why List I so long? Prepare to die. 'Twas vile Biting this little one.The Snake. The priests, great Lord, Who offer sacrifices do not win The merit or demerit. So then I Ought not to bear what was high Mrityu's deed. âAt this,â said Bhishma,âbeing named by name, Appeared red Mrityu's self, with noose, and eyes Of terror, and in this wise did she speak.â Mrityu. Serpent! thy words are true. I sent thee here, And thou art not the cause of this child's death. Nor I, that bade thee slay. Th' Omnipotent, He was the cause, God KÃ¢la. As the wind Drives the weak clouds whither it will, so I Hither and thither pass, by KÃ¢la blown. All that is Sattwa, RÃ¢jas, Tamas; all Which influences, which predominates, Which operates in creatures, have for source The will of KÃ¢la. All this Universe Thrills to His will. All thoughts, and acts, and words, And what doth spring from them, are KÃ¢la's work. The water, and the wind, sky, fire, and earth; Surya and Soma, Vishnu, DevarÃ¢j, Vritra, Parjanya; all the streams, and seas, Aditi, and the Vasus; what exists, Or did exist, or will, are KÃ¢la's deed. Why, therefore, Serpent! dost thou blame me here? If fault attach to me, to thee as well Fault would attach.The Snake. I do not blame thee, Death! Nor call thee blameless. This alone I say, That what I did I did of thee. If sin May lie on mighty KÃ¢la, or not lie, How shall a serpent see, how can it know? As I am innocent it liketh me Death, too, is innocent. But, Fowler! thou Hast heard the words of Mrityu: loose me then, It is not meet to vex a guiltless one, Tying him with this cord.The Fowler. Aye! I have heard Thee and thy Mrityu, yet I deem thee not Any more guiltless. Thou and Death wert cause; And cruel Death, who brings kind eyes to tears, I cannot force to suffer. Thee I can, And thee now will I slay for guiltiness.Mrityu. Thou wilt be sinful, Fowler! he and I Worked no will of our own: KÃ¢la is Lord, And all that's done is done by KÃ¢la's will. Neither the snake nor I deserve from thee These bitter words! But Bhishma said, âHereon, Look! KÃ¢la entered, God of Gods; and took Speech as of man; and spoke to Mrityu, Arjunako the Fowler, and the Snake.âKÃ¢la. Not Death, nor this vile reptile, nor Myself Stand guilty anywhere at any time Of any creature's dying. They and Iâ Yea! even Iâare all but go-betweens. Arjunako! thou Fowler! comprehend! The Karma of this child did kill this child, No other cause was there that brought its end; Of Karma he did die. That which he wrought In many lives ere this, led hereunto Implicitly. What he had wrought before Made this, and nothing else, the outcoming Of what was done; nor otherwise the Snake Thereto was led by Karma, and by that Mrityu; yea, I Myself. For will makes deeds, And deeds make Karma, and the Karma makes The outcoming. As when ye press the clay This way and that, and see it harden, so Men for themselves shape Fate. Shadow and light Are not more surely tied each unto each Than man to Karma, and to Karma, man; Therefore perceive and ponder! Therefore know Not I, nor Mrityu, nor the Snake, nor she, The Brahman mother, brought this death about; The child did bring it: 'twas his doing, his, Fixed from the flowing past, inevitable. Then Bhishma finished, saying: âThus the God And Mrityu, and the Snake, loosed from his cord, And Gautami, consoled in heart and mind, Went, with Arjunako the Fowler, home. And thou, too, puissant King! hearing this tale, Forget all grief, and reach to peace of mind; For Heaven and Hell and all things come to all By Karma. What has fall'n upon me here Is not thy doing, nor Duryodhana's; It was to be, because of what hath been.â SOHNI A TALE OF INDUS Dub mÃ»iââDead of drowningââis the legend on the stone, Standing grey, beneath the thorn-tree, by the river's brim, alone; With a woman's name carvedââSOHNIââand, below, cut, round and well, Just a common water chatty! Know you what it means, Patel? Head of the village. Yes! he knowsâthe village knows it! all those rags a-flutter see On the branches, and those votive shards piled round the bÃ¢bul-tree. None passes Sohni's death-place, but ties, for pious fear, Strips from his cloth or girdle, or casts a pebble there. For lovelierâso he tells usâall Indus' bank beside Than Sohni, the JÃ¢t maiden, no maiden might be spied; The cypress not so slim and straight, the musk-deer not so light As Sohni with the milk-pots bringing home the goats at night. He saysâthis village ancientâthat for love and joy to see Her dark eyes shining jewel-like, and footsteps passing free, And to hear the bangles tattling pleasant music round her feet, They changed her name of Sohni, to âJungle-Honey Sweet.â But ever by the river, growing up so fair and fineâ Daughter, besides, of Damadar, who owned a score of kineâ The great ones did desire her; and Sohni's youth and grace Were sought by Govind, soucar, Soucar: a native money-lender. of evil soul and face. And all because that soucar held half the village bound With debts at heavy usury, men trembled if he frowned; So Sohni must be Govind's wife, the next new moon but three; Yet Sohniâmilking, singingâwist not that this would be. Her mind was with her Indian boy, beyond the yellow stream, Who played the bansulÃ® BansulÃ®: Hindoo flute. so sweet he might God Krishna seem, So had he piped her heart away, and when the moon grew dim Sohni would swim the Indus, to find her heart, and him. To sit, before 'twas sunrise, under the peepal-tree And listen to his songs of love upon the bansulÃ®, And make him better music yet, with sighs and whispered words, Till time came they must sunder, and drive afield their herds. Then Sohni, with a last embrace, bound underneath her breasts The round black chatty, stopped with grass, whereon the fisher rests What time he spreads his river-nets; and, so, stemming the tide, Came back upon the chatty safe once more to her side. Then to the cover of the reeds the friendly jar she drew, And lightly tripped a-milking, till love's star gleamed anew; Full many a glad and secret night, when Luximan did blow, Sohni swam o'er the Indus, to meet her lover so. But once it fell that Govindâtoo early gone abroadâ Saw Sohni with her chatty, breasting the watery roadâ A lotus-blossom drifting! Ah! Govind's angry eyes Marked; and his evil spirit an ill deed did devise. From out its place of keeping fair Sohni's jar he drags, And hides another like it amidst the reeds and flags. Oh! trick of cruel cunning! 'tis a pot of unbaked clay, Will soften in the water-flood and swiftly melt away. And, when again the month grew dark, Luximan's bansulÃ® Sounds; and fond Sohni hears it, and hastens to her tree; There clasps the traitorous chatty, and plunges from the brink, Butâhalf acrossâfeels fatally the false clay yield and sink. A little while, for love and life, her brown hands beat the wave; But broad and strong runs Indus, and none is near to save: Down in the dark swift river, her slender limbs are drawnâ The soucar and the jackals hear that dying scream! At dawn Yonderâupon the sandy spitâlies Sohni, stiff and cold, The water-grasses tangled round the heart that was so bold; Dub mÃ»iââdrowned;â and so we set her deathstone by her tree Cursing the soucar Govind, who wrought such villainy. MY GUESTS Gallant and gay, in their doublets of grey All at a flashâlike the dartings of flame,â Chattering Arabic, African, Indianâ Certain of springtime, my swallows came! Doublets of grey silk, and surcoats of purple, And ruffs of russet round each white throat, Garmented brave they had crossed the waters, Mariners sailing with never a boat! Sailing a sea than the bluest deep bluer, Vaster to traverse than any which rolls 'Neath kelson of warship, or bilge of trader, Betwixt the brinks of the frozen Poles; Cleaving the clouds with their moon-edged pinions High over city and vineyard and mart; April to pilot themâMay tripping after; And each bird's compass his small stout heart. Meet it seemed such rovers to welcome, Travellers lordly, and bold, and wise; I doffed my hat on that golden morning To the first of their band who met my eyes; Saying, âAl sabah al khaireh, Swallow! If you're from Egypt, of Nile what news?â âChitra! chitra!â he cheeped, quick flying; â'Tis Hindi, then, that your worship would use,ââ âAp ki mihrban'ââbut he would not listen, Scouring the daisies in headlong flight; You'd want some breakfast, too, if you travelled From Ebro to Thames in a single night! Still I think that he held me civil, For he came again; and my foreign friend, Glossy, and plump, and familiar, and loving, A fair she-swallow did then attend. Ah! of the air what an Atalanta! How should we fare if our mistresses flew A mile in an eye-wink to mock a lover; With bright Hippomenes chasing, too! Yet all in good time they roved together, Paired like a doubled lightning-flash, Birds of one heart and one mind and one feather;â Lastly, she sate on my window-sash, Lord! such a Lady-Bird! eyes so shining, Feet so dainty, and mien so proud! Judging her Spanishâsome small SeÃ±oraâ âLa casa e sua!â I said, and bowed. Yes! and forthwith at my word she took me; Made a home of my house; surveyed A sheltered nook in the porch; and entered Into possession. There, unafraid, Day after day her nest she moulded, Building, with magicâand loveâand mudâ A grey cup, made by a thousand journeys, And the tiny beak was the trowel and hod. Then,âno more chatter, and no more twitter Till Silence and Night saw the cup contain Four pearlsâLove's treasures! 'tis âeggsâ men call them, Yet, if we would ponder a miracle plain, Think on the speed, and the strength, and the glory, The wings to be, and the jubilant life, Shut in those exquisite secrets she brooded, My Guest's small consort, the swallow's wife! Nay, and no southern Lazzarone, No lazy desert-bred Beddawee, Was her glossy husband! five hundred forays 'Twixt morning and evening accomplished he, Hawking the gnats, and raiding the midges, And darting home from his dipping bath With meat in his mouth for the wife and children; A Lord more gentle no Lady hath! A Lady more faithful no Lord could boast of; But the full pride came when, above the nest, Peeped four little birdlings, in purple and russet, And the gleam of as many a white satin breast. âA los niÃ±os que duermen,â I sang, in her Spanish, âDios los bendice!â She flirted away The better to show me her jewel-eyed darlings Along the edge of the cup of clay. Now, dawn after dawn, there are painstaking lessons To teach sky-science, and wing's delight; Soon will they follow the swift feet of Summer; Oh! SeÃ±or Swallow! I envy your flight! Ah! Golondrina! I grieve you are going! Say greetings for me to my East so dear! You have paid your rent with your silvery cheepings, âLa casa e sua!â Come back next year! THE END</field>
