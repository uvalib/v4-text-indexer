      <field name="fulltext">A Rule for Women to brynge vp their Daughters. Ye Mothers that your Daughters wyll brynge vp and nurture well: These Rules do keepe, &amp; them obserue, Whiche I shall here nowe tell. If they wyll go or gad abrode, their legges let broken bee: Put out their eyes if they wyll looke or gase vndecentlye. If they their eares wyll gyue to hark what other men do saye: Stoppe them vp quyte, if geue or take, then cut their handes awaye. If they dare lyghtly vse to talke, their lyppes together sowe: If they wyll ought lyghtly entende, lette Grasse vpon them growe. And at a worde, if she be yll, let her yll aunswers haue: And for her dower geue sharpe wordes and for her house a graue. Therfore ye Mothers, if ye vse and kepe my Rules in mynde: Daughters you shall haue none at all, or those of Phenyx kynde. Finis. The Historie of Theseus and Ariadne. There dwelt somtyme in Crete a kyng; that mightie Minos hight: Who had to wife Pasiphae, a passyng wylye wight. This carefull Quene bewayled sore, her husbandes absence longe: She did lament with pensiue thought. her iniurie and wronge. And moste for that dame Uenus sport she wanted suche a space: There was no man in all her Court, that could deserue her grace. They were eche one to base of bloud, or of to lowe degree: As that they might obtayne or haue so peerelesse a Ladie. And why? she did mutche more esteeme her honour and her fame: Then that she list to hasard them, with sutche reproche and shame. Thus did therfore her broylyng breast, inuent to put in vre: Least that her ardent secrete flames, shuld not be kept in sure. A Cowe of wodde for to be made, shee did therfore deuise: Compacte with connyng handycrafte, and perfite Artifice. For Dedalus the Carpenter, did frame it in sutche sorte: As it once seene, you would in dede, a very Cowe reporte. For if one were within the wood, the gynnes were trimmed so, That if they were pluckt aright, the Cowe would walke or go. This worke when it was finisshed, the quene for her solace, would oftimes get into the same, and sitte in it a space. Tyl that the Gynnes she could once turne and rule them as she lyst: Then she to worke her wanton wyll, begyns as she thynkes best. Somtymes she goes, somtimes she ronnes somtymes she lyeth styll: And finally she doth eche thynge, that pleases her wicked wyll. Then smellynge oyntments doth she take and doth annoynt this Cowe: For to prouoke the boysterous Bull, as women knowe well howe. This done she goeth into the same, the Bull also is brought: And there betwixt the Bull and Cowe is pretie pastime wrought. Pasiphae thus hath her wyll, except I be beguylde: Soone after this congresse was done, the Quene was founde with childe, Shortlye after, the kynge retournde and did lye by this quene, And she was great of kynge and Bull, at once, as then was seene. For when she should be brought to bed, came foorth a Monster fell: That had both shape of man and beast as auncient Stories tell. The Fame of this deformed Beast harde Countreies neare and farre, And for bycause two formes he had, men called him Mynotare. This furyous Feende, this hungry thing would eate nought els but men, Wherfore from all the sorye Landes, that Mynes conquerd then. There c?meth many men by lotte, this hungrye Beast to feede, And howe they speede for to reherse, ywys it is no neede. Till at the last noble Theseus, Good king Egeus sonne: Who for his sake from Turrets top, In sea headlong did ronne. Came into Crete to Laberynthe, Wherin this monster was: There for to ende his gloryous lyfe, from wealth to woe to passe: Where he once put with clamours huge, gan to extoll his crye: Bewaylyng muche his fatall fall, and present myserye. With these, or other suche lyke wordes, he did begin his mone: Salted with sighes and bytter teares, he was so woe begone. What do auayle my warlyke prowesse, my strength and hautie hart: They can not in this ieoberdye, at all releas my smarte. oh wretche full of calamytie, alas what hap haue I? In Crete thus in the Laberynthe, in pryson stronge to dye. Why dyd I not submytte my selfe, to Tygres tirranye? Or rampynge Lyons dagynge teeth, or ennemies crueltie. Why dyd not Giaunts me subdue? or Wolues in wyldernes: or Serpentes stynge in tyme tofore, ryd me from this distresse. Why didst not thou Hippolite, thyne ennemie ouerthrowe: Whiche nowe is in extremetie, in myserie and woe? Why didst thou not threeheaded Dog, thou Porter of Hell gate: Destroye me quite, when I did thee so cruellye assaute? Why did I not some poyson take, to ryd me of my lyfe: Why did not cruell dynt of sworde, stynt all this hatefull strife? Oh all ye Gods that all thyngs guyde, whom men do gentell call: Why do ye not pety my griefe, and rayse me from this fall. Remember me whom ye haue made, a kynges sonne lo I am: In warlyke force and hardines, surmountynge euery man. In flower of youthe without redresse, Oh cruell Destenie: Do lye in feare, alas the whyle, lookynge when I must dye. My weapons all are raught from me, wherwith I me defende: Well, weale awaye, I saye no more, but thus wyll make an ende. This sayd, the bytter teares and sighes, his senses do oppresse: So that ye neuer sawe a man, in so mutche heauynesse. All this complaynt and wofull crye, kynge Mynos Daughters harde: And were in mynde, if that they might, to take him out of warde. And therof spake thelder mayde, vnto her sister deare: Doste thou not here this man quoth she, that makes this ruthefull cheare? I heare quoth she, and do bewayle this wofull wretches case: What shall we do to helpe alas, we haue no tyme nor space? Well, well: quoth Ariadne thoe, (that was the Elders name:) I wyll prouyde some spedye helpe, come what wyll of the same. And thou my sister Phedra deare, assist me as thou can: For I must either die therfore, or els enioye this man. For I do loue with suche a zeale, and with so feruent loue: That I can not abyde suche flames, I sweare by the Gods aboue. This sayd: the yonger sister saide, alas what wilt thou do? Oh sister deare, nowe rule thy selfe, and let suche folye goe. Remember thou kynge Mynos wrathe, remember thyne owne fame: And how the worlde wyll speake of thee both vyllanie and shame. Oh canst thou not content thy selfe, with thyne happye state? Why wilt thou cast awaye thy selfe? why dost thou thy wealth hate? Dost thou not knowe that no Realme is safe from kynge Mynos sight? Dost thou not know that all the world, is subiect to his might. Whiche way wilt thou thy selfe conuay where he shall not thee finde? Therfore let this thy folye go and put it out of mynde. Dost thou not know y? kyngs are wonte longe handes to exercise? Dost thou not know that kyngs are said that they haue Lynxes eyes. Dost thou not knowe that Mynos is of nature very fell? Thou knowest all his qualyties, I neade them not thee tell. But put the case thou haue thy wyll, marke well what I thee saye: He wyll at length forsake thee quite, and cast thee cleane awaye. Example take by Sylla fayre, kynge Nysus Daughter deare, Who vpon promysse made to her, by Mynos kynge or sier. Who promysed to cary her with hym into his lande: If that she woulde her father geue, and Citie to his hande. She did with haste and dilygence, perfourme his whole request: But he alas vnto her payne, did frustrat his behest. Did not Medea by her meanes, yonge Iasons lyfe preserue: What curtesye and gentlenes did her good wyll deserue? She kept hym safe from ennemies force, from Dragons stynge also, She slewe her Brother for his sake. and with him she did go. Yet he at length did cast her of, suche is the Greekysh kynde: And wilte thou nowe a Greeke beleue, who hath bewitcht thy mynde? Do thou therfore suche foolysshe toyes, out of thy mynde let slyde: And neuer let suche fancies force, thy vnconstant head to guide. This sayd, her sister waxed redde, and looked lowryngly: As though that she displeased were, yet kepte it secretly. Least that her Syster shoulde disclose, her pryuie enterpryse: Whiche she wold not shuld come to pas in any maner wyse. And spake with silent voyce againe, what panges of dolfulnesse Do I susteyne? what weepynge wayles can halfe ynoughe expresse? The flames that I do hydden keepe within my burnynge breast? Oh sister deare assiste thou me, that I maye get some rest. I do not weye kynge Mynos wrathe, I do it not regarde: So that I maye my Theseeus delyuer out of warde. What do I care, what men do saye, of mee, when I am gone: So that I neuer here their talke, and I shall leaue to mone. And so should I be happy then, whiche nowe vnhappy proue: Then shuld I saue my selfe which now do languysh, lost in loue. I do not care for Mynos might, as myghty men as he: Haue mist their wyll of meaner men then Theseus and mee. I knowe that Mynos might is great, yet loue is greater muche: And suche as feare his Ire or wrath, leaue of to loue let suche. I knowe that kynges haue armes longe and that they can see farre: Yet Loue is farre without their reache: they can not see so farre. I knowe that Mynos is both fell, and of great crueltie: And if that he vs apprehende, I knowe that we must dye. But come or happe what wyll to mee, I care not for his might: For if that I might Theseus haue, I were a blessed wight. Thou oughtest not (sister) to compare Mynos with Theseus: The one is roughe and hastie both: the other curteous. I knowe not what yonge Iason was: ne of what stocke he came: But if he dyd, as you reporte, he hath deserued blame. But sure I am that Theseus, his promys made, wyll keepe. And I twyse happy should then be, in his sweete armes to sleepe. But I alone, do I, I saye alone attempt by flight: My loue to haue, and him enioye: is this so straunge a sight? Hath not such chaunces chaunced before for Louers to haue ioye? Did not Dame Helene companye, sir Parys vnto Troye? Did not trusty Theagenes, conuaye Cariclea: Untyll they came with muche adoe, to Ethiopia. Where after many sturdye stormes, and burnynge broylynge past: They did enioye eche other bothe, longe looked for at last. I could reherse thee many moe, if I had tyme and space: But all to longe I feare alas we tarye in this place. These wordes did quayle her sister well and foorth they go both two: Unto the Denne where Theseus was, in myserye and wo. They call the Porter vnto them, and byd hym ope the doore: And in they go together bothe and stoode Theseus before. And Ariadne spake to hym, and said sir howe fare ye? Alas Madame but yll quoth hee, in this extremytie. And in suche sorte they talke awhyle, then did she speake agayne: And would you gladly sir quoth shee, be eased of this payne? If you wyll promys mee one thynge, and graunt mee my behest: That when I shall desyre you, you wyll graunt mee my request. We wyll seeke meanes all that we may for to delyuer you: We wyll assiste you as we can, this Monster to subdue. When Theseus harde so ioyfull newes, he fell vpon his knee: And did request her of her ayde, and that right spedelye. And I quoth he, wyll all thynges do, that you can me commande: I wyll be yours, all that I haue I put into your hande. Therfore Madame, helpe me I praye, that am your owne at wyll, Loe I am yours at all assayes, to saue, or els to spyll. Therfore saye on Oh curteous Quene, here saye what is your wyll: Some seruyce do to mee commaunde, and I wyll it fulfyll. Nought els I wyll of thee quoth shee, but that thou promys here: That thou wilt carye vs with thee, into thy countrey dere. And that thou shalt mee take to wyfe, and lyue with me for ay: This sure, and thou delyuered, shalt be this present daye. Oh Ladye fayre, happye were I, yea thryse happye I saye: If you would mee accept your man, and your seruaunte alwaye. And as for Mariage, I suppose, that you will not bestowe your selfe on mee: whome here tofore, you haue not seene ne knowe. And as for me, I do confesse, I am to base of blood: As that I maye attayne vnto so fayre a Queene and good. Alas, what is poore Theseus? what is Egeus sonne. Whose fate is suche, that styll he must, his myserie bemone. But if you wyll vouchesafe taccepte mee, for your man or slaue: As I that in your mercye lyes, either to lose or saue. I were mutche bounde vnto your grace, I were muche bounde I saye: And I nowe am, and styll shalbe your owne, at eche assaye. Leaue of quoth she these words, &amp; swere I knowe well what thou arte: Come of, and do as I request, and ease my payne and smarte And thou streyght waye shalbe exempte from pryson and from warde: Do as I saye, if thou hast ought vpon thy selfe regarde. Well than quoth he, sith me your make you wyll vouchsafe to haue: Whiche would be glad, if you so would to be your page or slaue. Marke well and harke what I wyll say, myne aunswere thus shalbe, Whiche I wyll styll auouche and keepe what so betyde of me. I sweare to you by all the Goddes, and powers in heauens hye: By all the spyrytes that hell do rule, the earth and sterry skye. That I wyll be your man and make, both nowe and eke for aye: Styll you to loue, and none but you, if you saue me this daye. And these also, that you do brynge, I wyll them styll defende: From tyme to tyme as nede shalbe, vntyll my lyfe shall ende. When in suche sorte his othe he made, Oh Lorde howe glad was shee, Her bloud did come, her hart did leape, she gan to waxe merye. Then by and by they take in hande, this Monster for to kyll: And Balles of Heere &amp; Pitch they make to gyue to hym his fyll. None was so earnest in this worke, none laboured so mutche: As Ariadne did, as whome these wisshed Ioyes did tutche. And to be shorte, with trauell great, and with great toyle and payne: This disformed Beast, this Feend so fel was murthered and slayne. Then speede they make vnto their ships whyle as it was yet daye, And Phebe had not with her starres chased the lyght awaye. With haste they get a boorde eche one, they labour all the nyght: All do put to their helpynge handes, to further this their flight. Untyll Aurora did them tell, that Phebus was at hande: And therby founde gesse that they approched to some Lande. In dede these Damselles could not well abyde the ragynge Seas: Therfore they labour to get lande, theron them selues to ease. And then aboute the tyme that Sole, approched to the place: Where from the hiest heauens toppe, he shewes his shynyng face. Thei leaue their ships, and find a Land where pleasures do abounde: Where they lye downe to take their rest vpon that fruitfull grounde. And those that sleepe did not oppresse, they gather flowers gaye: Or els did walke into the woods, to dryue their cares awaye. Nothynge there was in all the Lande, that could not moue their spirites: Their eyes, their eares and senses all, moued them to braue delytes. But Aryadne had good cause not to haue slepte at all: Although it were to her vnknowen, what should to her befall. For Theseus, Oh traytour lyke, when she so surely slepte: Awaye from her as secretelye as he could, from her crepte. He gathered his men to hym, that wandred in the woode: Were rangyng here, and walking there as eche of them thought good. And hastely they went aboorde, and lancht into the deepe: And left not one with her a shore, where she alas did sleepe. Forgettynge quyte her benefytes, whiche she to hym had done: And howe she had her countrey loste, and parentes left eche one. But so soone as she did awake, and felt that he was gone: She starteth vp, and stares aboute, but men she seeth none. She ronneth streight vnto the place, where as the shyps did stande: Where she a farre into the sea, did looke from Naxus lande. And when she had espyed the shyppes, where they awaye did sayle. She wept and wrange her hands apace but what did teares auayle? And so soone as her teares did cease, amyd her myserye: She dyd begyn with pyteous playnt for to extoll her crye. What tyme quod she, this Theseus by cruell fates constraynt: Within my father Mynos Realme, did vtter his complaynt. In daunger with dispayre, a lothsome lyfe he led: With scaldyng sighes and bytter teares desyrynge to be deade. But I poore wretche, alas I dyd laye playsters to his sore: That he had neuer after cause, to weepe or wayle no more. I dyd repayre his crased shyppes, I dyd him treasure gyue: I dyd my selfe bequeath to hym, styll with hym for to lyue. I bancketted this Traytours men, I vittayled them with store: I shewed them suche pleasure, as they neuer had before. I dyd my loued countrey lothe, my parentes I forsooke: To go with hym vnto his land, all paynes I vndertooke. And he lykewyse dyd swere to mee, by Goddes and heauens hye: That he alwayes wolde be my man, with me to lyue and dye. Yet he my merytes dothe, with falshed recompence: Whiche loue and loyaltie he doth dispytefullye dispence. Amyd a Forest wylde and wyde, for Beares or Wolues a pray He leaueth me a sleepe, and he falsely doth go his waye. His trustlesse trueth, his treason tryed, his fayth, his falshed founde: And I a wofull wretche in care, as any on the grounde. To you ye Goddes, I do complayne, to you this tale I tell: Sithe y? he hath your names blasphemd that he may hange in hell. Reuenge my cause, sithe none but you my whole estate do knowe: That you be Goddes, and wyll reuenge to Theseus do showe. And you also that here of mee, that be of Iudgement pure: Beware to fisshe in Fancies floud, or els to drowne be sure. Beware, be wyse, example take, by Ariadnes payne: Whiche helpyng hym who helples was she helples doth remayne. This sayd: the Goddes did her translate into the starrye skye: And gaue her place amonge the starres, where she shall neuer die. FINIS. Th. Vn.</field>
