      <field name="fulltext">CERTAIGNE PSALMES OR SONGUES OF DAVID OUT OF THE PSALME 102. Benedic Anima mea Domino. Of gods mercie. Mercifull he is, and full of pitie the Lorde, Long ere he be angrie, and easie to accorde. For he doth not his wrathe to thend endeuer, Nor he doth not threaten ous for euer. After our offences he doth not with vs deale, Nor according to our synnes paieth he vs our meale. For as heaven from earth in space is most distaunt, So to them that feare him, is his mercie most abundaunt. So far as is the rising from the setting of the sone, So far away from vs our synnes hath he done. And as the fathers hart is tender, yea ouer his wanton child, So is the Lords ouer us, though we be synfull and wild; For he remembreth the Creature, that himself hath wrought, And knoweth vs to be dust, and thinges of nought. For what is a man, but as gras and haie, As the floure in the feeld, so fadeth he away, Which falleth down, and withereth, as the wind on it doth blowe, It is cast away, and the place of it no man after doth knowe. But the mercie of the Lorde is that, that doth for euer endure, And to them that feare him, is most certain and sure. His rightuousnes and promises, to their childerns childern shall remain, That thinkes on his commaundementes, and studies them to main. THE PSALME 152. Voce mea ad Dominum clamaui. To thee o Lorde I crie and call, and my voice I do exalte, To thee, o God, on my knees I fall, looking when help me thou shalt. To thee, o God, my complainct I powre, and salt teares I do shed. I shew my Supplicacion, o Lorde, thee before, and desire it of thee to be redd. In hevynes when my sprite was drownd, of my walk thou wert aware, And knewe in the way where I was bownd, thei had laied for me a snare. On my right hande I prie and toote, and look for freendship of men, Alas I see there is no boote, now no man will me ken. I haue no place wherto to flee, wherin I shuld have refuge. No man careth for my lief I see, my grief be great and huge. Therfore, O Lorde, to thee I crie, thou art my hope alone. Thow art my porcion I say boldely, in the land of the living one (sic). Consider, o Lorde, this my complainct, and this my sorrowes grief. I am brought lowe, I am full fainct, and in a great mischief. Help, aid, o God, for thei are to stronge, that my lief doth seek and pursue, For me to resist, and be among their terrible crie and hue. Of prison, o Lord, bring my bodie out, that I may give prais to thi name, And iust men will without any doubt resort to my company again. THE PSALME 142. Domine exaudi. Heare me, o Lorde, when I do pray, And consider, o God, what I do say. O, for thi rightuousnes and truthes sak Answer the peticion, which I do mak. Enter not into iudgement with me, thi servaunt, Nor according to thi iustice do not me scaunt; For no man liuing is so perfect and well tried That in thi sight he may be iustified. But thenemie my soule doth still pursue, He smiteth my lief, the woundes doth acrue, He laieth me in darknes, where comfort is small, Like the deade of this world, which doth me apall. Sore vexed within me, therfore is my sprite. My hart is desolate and in moorning doth delite. Yet do I remembre the tyme that is past And muse upon thi woorke bothe first and last. Thus hither and thither thoughtdriven in a dolefull wise, In the worke of thi handes I do my self exercise. My handes vnto thee with sighes I do stretch, My soule gaping vnto thee, as out of a drought doth retch. Help me, o Lorde, and that sone with speede; For my sprite waxeth faint, of succour I haue neede. Turne to me, o Lorde, thi face from me do not hide; Ells shall I be like vnto them, that into the pit do slide. Oh, let me heare, o God, thi kindnes most louing, As my trust is in thee, betimes in the morning, My soule I lift vp to thee, to me now shew and talk Of that blessed way, in which thou wilt have me walk. From myn enemies devises, now, o Lorde, me deliuer; I resort vnto thee, my God, I know not ells whither. Teach me, o Lorde, what will thee please, For thou art my God, that canest me ease. Let thi Loving sprite me streightfort leade To the Lande of the rightuous, where I can not be deade; Giue me comfort and lief again for the honour of thi name, And for thi iustice sake bring me out of trouble and blame. Dissipate thou and scater myne enemies abrode, Confounde and destroye them, that my death doth abode; Let them haue shame at the last, and nothing wheron to vaunt, That seeketh my vexacion, for I am thi servaunt. THE PSALME 119. Ad dominum cum tribularer clamaui. When I was in trouble on the Lorde I called, and he answered me prest, As who wold say, Sone be not apalled, all will I turne to the best. From the lyeng lippes this is my songe, o Lorde thou me deliuer, And from that craftie deceitfull tongue, that furst hath brought me hither. What shalbe thi rewarde o tongue so craftie, and what shalbe thine hire? Even arowes strong, sharp and mightie, and coles of burning fire. Alas for me this is my chaunce, my banishement still to endure, In prison strong so long to daunce, in a cabon of sorowes ure. My lief hath long dwelt now I see, among such maner of men, That for to let peace and unitie, did what thei coulde agen. I labored for peace most busely, discorde to put away farr; Whiles I travailed therin most earnestly, thei prepared against me the war. THE PSALME 85. Inclina Domine. Bow down thine eare to me, o Lorde, and harken to my crie, For destitute of all comfort, a poore man am I. Keepe thou my lief both sure and fast, for holie be thet I am; Help me, thi servaunt, that I be not agast, for in thee is my trust and no man. O Lorde to me be mercifull, for I call on thee ech day; Comfort my soule now dolefull, which I yeld to thee alway. For thou art easie to forgive blame; and most gratious of all, To every man that for the same, vpon thee will earnestly call. Give eare, o Lorde, to my prayers all, and ponder my request; In the time of my trouble to thee I call, for thou doest heare me best. Of all gods, o Lorde, thou art alone, there is none lik vnto thee; As thou doest there can do none, thi workes so wounderfull bee. All nations, o God, whom thou haest mad, shall fall down thee before; Thi name with praises thei shall lade and glorifie it evermore. For thou, my Lord, art a great one, and wounders thou doest mak; There is no god but thou alone, whom heaven and earth doth quak. Leade me, o Lorde, in thi patheway, that in thi truth I may walk; Let my hart delite in thi name alway, that with feare of it I may talk. Great thankes, o Lorde, I giue to thee, alwais I will praise thi name; Great is thi mercie thou haest shewed me, I shall euer remembre the same. Great mercie, Lorde, thou haest me shewed, and my soule thou haest fetched out; From the deepe hell where it was tewed, in the sorowfull pange of doubte. The company of the mightie seeketh my lief, the proude against me do rise; Vniustly, o Lorde, thei seek this strief, thou art not before their eyes. But thow full of compassion art, and mercifull I knowe, Long suffering, and patient on thi part, and for to ponishe slowe. Great is thi goodnes, great, o Lorde, great is thi truthe and pure, Let me alwais in them acorde, and in thi faith be sure. Turne to me, o God, and myne enimies daunt, and on me let thi mercie ron, Strengthen me, o Lorde, thin own servaunt, and help thi handmaides son. Some token for good vpon me shewe, o my Lorde, my comfort and my trust, That myn haters may be ashamed, and know, that help and defende me thou dust. THE PSALME 30. In te Domine speraui. In thee, o Lorde, I put my trust, let me be confounded neuer. In thee is my hope, which art so iust, help me, o God, and deliuer To me, o God, bow down thine eares, and harken whan I pray. Thei be sore men that now me feares, hast, help me from them away. Be a god to me and a protector, and an howse of sauf refuge; Be now myne help, never neede was more, in thes daungers great and huge. For thou art my God, my strength and defence, and for thi holie name, Thow shalt me deliuer and bring hence, and set me again in frame. From this snare, o Lorde, thou shalt loose me, that thei have laied me for to tak; For my defendor I only have thee, I have none other to mak. Into thi handes I comend my sprite, have mercie upon me and ruthe; Thow haest redemed me and given me light, o Lord, the God of truthe. Thow hatest, o Lorde, I do well knowe, and hast them far from thi mynd, That after vanities do seek and blowe, and be to thee unkind. But I will trust even in the Lorde, I shall reioyce therfore and be glad With other which be of the same acord, and tast in his mercie haue had. For thou hast looked on my weekenes, and saved my soule ov live, And helped me from great distres, and mad me glad and blive. Thou wilt not shit me in myn enimies hand, but keepe me as a charge, And set my feete where they shall stand, abrode again at large. O Lorde of me tak now pitie, for in great trouble I am; For hevines wasted is myn eye, my face and bodie wan. Sadnes hath made my lief waxe old, with lamentacions great; In moorning be spent my yeres bold, with sighes and teares weat. My sprite beginneth me for to faile, for thes new cares and wheint; Deuersitie maketh my strength to quaile, and all my bones feint. I am becom a very reprofe, and a woundering stock I am made; My neighbours gettes from me aloof, and myn acquaintaunce of me are afraid. I have heard the sclaunder that against me doth ron, I am abhorred of every man; To counsell against me thei haue begon, they will rid me to death if thei can. But my hope in thee is set I say, in thee it is set fast; Thou art my God I crie alway, that wilt help me furst or last. My time, o Lorde, is in thi hand, from myn enimies power me rid; Let me be deliuer from my foes band, and from my pursuers hid. The light of thi countenaunce shew me, thi servaunt, wherin is all my trust For thi mercies sake now succour me graunt, o Lord, that art so iust. Let not me be confounded now and marred, for on the, o Lorde, I call; Let thungodlie rather be tired and terned, and into the pit down fall. Let the lyeng lippes to silence be shut, which with crueltie and disdain Against the rightuous so falsely doth put, and railes on them so fain. Oh how great and manifold, be the good thinges, o Lorde, That thou haest to them prepared and tolde, that in thi feare doth acorde. What wounderfull thinges bringes thou to pas, to them that trustes in thee, The greatest wounders that euer was, for all man-kinde to see. Suche men thou doest hide priuely, in thi presence from the proud; In thi tent thou kepest them secretely, from the tongues that lieth so lowd. Most hartie thankes therfore I give, to the Lorde that shall fetch me hence, By whose mervailous kindnes now I live, in a citie of strong defence. For whan the sodein feare upon me cam, I was a most rufull wight; Alas, said I, now dead I am, I am cast out of thi sight. But thou, good Lorde, my prayers didest heare, whan I lamentably cried to the; To my peticon thou didest giue care, and madest hast to deliuer me O love ye the Lorde, all ye his sainctes, for the faithfull he doth keep and guard; Accordingly he doth heare all you complaintes, and the proud he doth reward. Be strong therfore, and take good hart, all ye that trustes in him; He both can and will ease all your smart, and defend you both lief and lym. THE PSALME 40. Beatus qui intelligit super egenum et pauperem. Blessid is he, that considereth the poore, the Lord shall him deliuer, And in his trouble aide him euermore, with help and comfort togither. The Lorde alive shall him keepe, and on earth make him prosper; To his enimies will, that doth him sek, he will not him give ouer. In his bed the Lord shall him refresh, where he lieth sick and in grief; Yea he will make it for him soft and nesh, and help him with much relief. Therefore, said I, my Lorde thou art, be mercifull vnto me, And heale thou now my soules smart, for I have synned but unto thee. Yet myne enimies do speake very evill of me, thei look, and still apace gape; Whan shall he perish? whan shall he die? and his name an eand ous mak. Though he cam to me as to comfort, yet falsely he meant in his hart, In trecherie he did resort, still heaping craft and smart. All suche men now which do me hate, together against me thei ron; Thei seek to ruine myn estate, and imagine what hurt may be done. A wicked sentence thei haue given, and vpon me thus thei devise, Now he is laid, and is thus driven, he shall neuer after arise. Yea my freend, on whom I trusted most, who hath eaten of my bread, Hath lift vp his heale, and against me doth bost, and is on[e] that wold haue me dead. But, Lorde, to me thi mercie shew, and raise me vp again; If thou be so, thoough freendes be few, yet I may reward them again. By this I know most certainly, that thou, Lorde, doest me fauer, That thou wilt not suffer myne enimie, thus me to triumph ouer. For myne innocencie sak thou haest held me, and kept me all this space, And euer thus, thou shalt succour me, and hold me before thi face. The Lorde of Israel blessid be, the Lorde my God I say, From henceforth to eternitie, for now and euer and aye. THE PSALME 70. In te Domine speravi. In thee, o Lorde, I put my trust, Let not me be confounded or quaile But rid me for Thi mercies sak For thi iustice do not me faile Encline thine eare To my request And help me in this stound. If I haue not help Of thee my God, None other is to be found. Be thou my strength And my fortres, Wherto I may now flie. Though mightely Pursued still Yet saufely in thee to lye. Thou art my guarrison, O my good God, Thou art my tower and castell. When I crie on thee, Thou haest promised me, That nothing shall me quell From the hande of thungodlie Save me, o God. Let not their power stretch hither. Saue me, o Lorde, From the cruell, Thunrightuous and bloodie to-gither. For thou, o Lorde, My god art he For whose kingdom from my youth I haue longed; Myn hope hath alwais Bene in thee And to this tyme it is prolonged. Sith I was born I haue lenid on thee Even from my mothers bely; To thee I have lived, Thou haest me kept, Therfore now praise thee shall I. I am made a wonder And a gasing stock For the people on me to look; Yet did I not fall From my hope in thee But hold on thi mercie I tok. Let my mouthe be filled With thi honour, o God, And thi praise all the day long. To give the thankes For my great ioyes And for my sorowes among. Cast not me away In my weekenes Whan my strength now doth me faile; Forsak me not My Lorde my God When myn enimies doth me assaile. Myn enimies now Consultes togither, Lyeth in waite, and thus thei mean: Take him, say thei, And hold him fast; God hath forsaken him cleane. On him, say thei, Who can him aid? For now there is none left To succour him; Of all comfort, And help he is bereft Go not to far From me, o God, Go not to far away. Hast now, o Lorde, To succour me And help me even this day. Confound thou them, My Lorde, my God, And mak their counsell vain That workes again My lief and soule And seekes my blood so fain. Let them receive Dishonour, my Lorde, Let them be couerid with shame That by their great Iniustice do Thus cruelly seeke my blame. But for my part I will quiet me, And with patience I will abid. I wil look while thou Deliuerest me, And thi praise I will not hide. My mouth shall speak Of thi iustice, Thine helth and saving name, All my lieflong Without ceasing To love and praise the same. From my youth till now, O Lord, my God Thou haest me taught and lerned Thi workes infinite And wounders so great, Which can not be discernid. Therfore now will I shew them forth And teach them yong and old, That thei may giue glorie And praise to thee For thi wounders so manifold. Forsak me not Now, my good Lord, In this my time of age, When hoore heares comes Of care and thought And of the sorowes rage. Till I have shewed To my childerns childern, which herafter born shalbe, Thi mightie hand And declared thi power To all posteritie. Great is thi rightuousnes, O most holie Lord, Great bi thi workes and mightie, That thou doest work, Everliving God, Who can be lik vnto thee. To what great troubles, O my good God To what griefe hast thou me put, To what anguish, And sorow of mynde, O Lord, haest thou me shut. Yet wilt thou turne And refresh me, And comfort me again, And lift me up From the pittes brinck And from the deadlie pain. To promotions great And great honour, O Lord, thou haest me brought; In aduersities On euery sid For my comfort haest thou wrought. Therfore will I New still praise thee, And of thi faithfulnes tell; Of lute and harpe I will play to thee, O thou holie of Israell. My lippes wold fain Give Laudes to thee, And so wold my soule also; My hart with thee Wold ioyfull bee, Whom thou haest rid out of woo. My tongue wold still Of thi goodnes talk And clater all the long day, That thei are brought To shame that sought My hurt, and gon away. THE PSALME 54. Exaudi deus orationem meam. Do thou, o Lorde, My prayer heare, Thine help I do abid; To my peticion Encline thin eare, Do not thee from me hid. Take heed to me, My God, I say And heare me in my pain, How piteously I moorn and pray And lamentably complain. The enimie Crieth on me so, Thungodlie cometh on me so fast; Thei mind to me Great mischief to do, Which maketh me agast. My hart is hevie Within my brest, As heavye as ever was lead; With feare of death I am sore prest, I were as good be deade. For feare I tremble Now and quak As a ship that hath lost her helme; An horrible dread Maketh my hart ak, And doth me ouerwhelme. O that I had winges, I said, lik a dove, That I might flie to some nest, And convey my self By the skie aboue To a place where I might rest. Then wold I hence Get me away farr, And for a tyme remain, And wilderness Wolde I mak my barr To saue me from this pain. Tavoide this blustering Stormie wind I wold mak right great hast, And hid me where Thei shuld not me find Till the tempest were ouerpast. O Lord, my God, Destroy those tongues And divid them into partes; I se iniustice then Them amonges In the citie spitefull hartes. Lies and sclaunders Both day and night All about the walles doth fill, Mischief and murdre And bloodwite And vice in the midds of it still Vngodlie wickednes Is therin, Falsehod, crafte, and deceite; Trecherie and gile Is not thyn But full in every streight. If it were myn enimie, I wolde it beare, Or one that I did knowe To have born me ill will, I wolde not feare Tavoid this ouerthrowe. But now it is Even thou I see My compaignion, guide, and freend, Myn olde familiar That hurtes me, That makes me doubt theend. Sweet comunicacions Haue we had togither, And secretely have we talked; In the howse of the Lord Hither and thither Full lovingly haue we walked For my part I will On the Lord call, And my moone to him I will mak; Help me, I know, Than my God shall And pitie vpon me tak. In the even and morn And at noone day I will moorn and complain; For he doth heare My voice alway And ease me of my pain. It is he that keepeth My soule in peace From them that lieth in waite; Thei lay many snares, But he will me release And snatche away their baite. Even God that sittes On high, I say, And of heaven holdeth the crown, Will heare me, when To him I pray, And bring myn enimie down. For thei will not turne And whi say yow? For God thei do not feare. To his great iustice Thei will not bow Nor his comaundementes heare. Upon such as he loueth Thei lay their handes; And such as be at peace With God, thei cast Streight into bandes; Gods promis thei do release. Their mouthes than butter Be more softe, Yet battail thei beare in their mynd; Smoother than oile Their woords be wrought, Yet wordes ye shall them find Well, cast thi care Vpon the Lorde, He will thee nourish and keepe; He will not long Leave the in this cord, Nor suffer his rightuous to weepe. But them, o God, Thou shalt cast down, And thrust into the pit, That thus do stande Against thi crown; Their malice shall them hitt. Thei that thurst blood And deceitefull bee Shall not live half their daies; But my trust, o Lord, Is fixed on thee, And so shall it be alwais. PSALMES OF THANKSGIVING. Exaltabo te, Deus meus. Rex. 144. Thee, o Lord, will I magnifie, To that me will I endeuer; Thee, o my God and my King, say I, Thee will I praise for ever. Eche day will I give thankes to thee, To that me will I endeuer; To laude thi name my work shalbe, For that I will studie for ever. Great, oh great, is the Lord, Yea, great, of a wounderfull bend, Worthie to be praised of all acord, Of his greatnes there is none eand. One generacion shall tell to an other Thi workes in euery hower, The daughter shalbe taught even of her mother. The sonne of his father, thi power. For my part my tongue shall ay still walk; Of thi glorie, I will not lyn. I will of thi wurship, and praise talk, And of thi wounderfull workes begyn. So that all the world shall ring again, Of that thei shall of me heare Of thi marvelous actes, and power mayn Of thi great, and hig[h]est feare. Thi louing kyndnes, and most abundant, And thi mercies so manifold, Thi high iustice that all men can daunt, And pitie shalbe song and told. Oh, gratious and pitefull is the Lord, His mercie, and sufferaunce is great, Most readie to forgiue, and be at acord, Though our synfulnes might him freate. The Lord is louing to euery man, No person he doth repell, His workes be as great as any can, Yet doth his mercie all them excell. O Lord, all thi workes do thee praise, Yea thi sainctes, that be most holie, Give most high thankes to thee alwais, For pardoning of their folie. Thei shew the glorie of thi kingdom, Of thi mercie and power thei talk, Thei shew the terriblenes of thi dome, And of thi most gratious walk. That thi power so great, and glorie bright, Might be knowen clene ouer all, And of thi holie kingdom the mervailous might Might all mens prid apall. Thi kyngdom is a kyngdom euerlasting, Thi rule endureth for euer Through all age without failyng; Thi dominion shall cease neuer. The Lord vpholdeth eche one that doth fall, Setting vnder his most holie hand; Yea, those that be down, he lifteth vp all, If thei be of this faithfull band. The eies of all creatures on thee do waite, To thee thei crie and gape; In season thou givest them meate and bait Tu suck, and eate, and lape. Thou openest thi hand, which is so blissed, And fillest all thing living With plentie of such thinges as be missed, Wherof thei may haue feeding. Blissed is the Lord in all his giftes, And in all his workes holie; He is he that saveth vs, and liftes From all our synnes and folie. He is nigh to all them that on him do call, Such as call with faith and trust; He is readie to save them that thei do not fall And to raise them out of the dust. He doth fulfill all their desire That doth his godhed feare; He doth fetche them out of the mire And quickely their cries heare. The Lorde doth ay kepe and preserue All them, that doth him love; He scatereth thungodlie, and lette hem sterue Suche from him he doth remove. My mouth therfore shall speak the praise Of that most blessed Lorde; So let all flesh giue thankes alwais To his name with one acord. THE PSALME 145. Lauda anima mea Dominum. Praise the Lord, oh my soule and sprite, Even while I shall haue my living, While my lief shall last, I shall haue most delite of praises to my Lord my God to be singing. Never in princes, put yow your trust, Nor yowr confidence in the sonnes of man Thei will not help yow, thei will leave yow in the dust, Thei be not those, that help yow can. As sone as mans breath way doth pas, To earth again he is turned and brought; He is deade, he is caron, he is nothing, alas; So vain be his thoughtes, in deede worthe nought. But happie is hee, that for his help hath God, The God of Jacob, for his hope and defence; He is only able to defende the rodd And to kepe all stormes of the wicked thence. God who hath made both heaven and earth, The salt seas, and all that in them is, Who is readie at tymes both of plentie and dearth, And in that he doth promis, neuer yet did mys. God who doth help them to their right, That iniurie do suffer, and great wrong; God who doth help them, which ells might Sterue for hungre, and crie a most wofull songe. The Lord looseth men out of prison stroung, The Lord giueth sight to the blind, The Lord helpeth them that most daungers are among, The Lord at need, o rightuous, ye shall alwais find. The Lord careth for the straungers and widowes, And the fatherles he will defend; The vngodlie shall do nothing, that at the last dowes, God will turne their fansies upsydown in theend. O Sion, thi Lorde is Lord God and King And most mightely I say, he will rule therfore. He will all wicked to subiection bring And rule all nations for euermore. [What meane thei thus to fret and fume?] What meane thei thus to fret and fume? What meane thei thus to fare? What meane thei thus on me to glume? Whi was I not of it aware? Thou knowest, o Lorde, how I haue walked, Thow knowest what I haue doon, Thou art not ignorant how I haue talked, To thee I make my moone. If I have gone about to hurt any man, Or for to sowe discorde, Than let them hurt me as thei can, And help me not, o Lorde. But if I haue alwais sought for peace, And labored discord to remove, Than help me thou, though thei do not cease To pursewe me, for thi loue. From lyeng lippes, and sclaunderous tongues Now Lorde thou me defend. Confound and stop thenvious longues, And bring my troble to an end. Than shall I be glad, and in the reioyce, Than shall I praise thi name, Than shall I thee lavd with my sprite and voice For delyvering me from blame. AN-OTHER PSALME. [Whie shall we still in this prison abid?] Whie shall we still in this prison abid? Shall we still in these cabons remayn? Wilt thou yet from vs thi face away hid? And keepe us continually in this disdayn? If we have offended, as thei do to vs laye, And as the brute doth go about, Let them vs kill, let our lives decaye, Let vs never herafter alive com out. What meane thes tales? What meane thes talkes? Whi do thei thus vpon us lye? Is there no God that now on earth walkes, Suche false sclaunderours for to espie? I had thus conceived, in my mynde. The wicked flaterer, speedith best. Thei save themself most, that be vnkinde. The iust man hath, I see, no rest. Whan troble cometh, than most is his part Whan welth retorneth, he is most suspect He is lest pleasaunt, that hath a true hart Still flaterie is preferrid, and truthe is reiect. I will, I said, if I do escape this, Turne my lie an-other waye Be pleasaunt, and a flaterer, as some other is; What neede I tell truth, and my self cast away. The wicked I see doth gaine, most riches. The wethercock scapeth best, every wind. What neede I, needles, cast me in distres? The perills of death, or grief of mynd. I can, I think, scape, as well as the best I knowe all the waies, to the wood. I can hold my peace, or I can say lest, And I can, if I will, be most milde of mood. God doth not regarde, God doth not see, God lettith the world, goo on wheeles. All true-harted men, maie learne of me, Seyng such daungiers, following their heeles. Thus in my folie, I semed to speak, But God me than, did reprehend, Thow doest not regarde, the latter wreak, Thow doest not consider, what is theend. If with patience I suffer, them for to call And make myn examples, variable, Wilt thou from my grace, streightway fall With a mynde so doubtfull, and so vnstable. Whose is riches, whose is need? Whose is to mak sad? Whose to make fain? Whose to giue comfort? Whose to make the hart bleed? Whose to poure on honour? And whose to giue disdain? Is there any thou doest trust, better than me? Or whom thou doest tak, to be more wise? Is there any, thinkes thou, more carefull of thee? That can let thee fall easelier, and soner arise. I was ashamed of myself, and I moorned in myn hart, I crie thee, o Lorde, most humbly mercie Pardon me, o God, heale my soules smart, To thi goodnes I submitte, my cause hoolye. I haue no God, but thee alone, I haue no father, cousyn, nor freend, I haue no master, to whom I shuld moone, Therfore thou, o Lorde, shalt make my eend. AN-OTHER PSALME. [Euerie man knoweth his own faulte] Euerie man knoweth his own faulte, The gessinges of men, be but doubtfull, He that is most high, is most nere thassault, The fortunes of men be so wounderfull. This day made new Duke, Marques, Earle, or Baron, Yet maie the ax, stand next the dore, Euerie thing is not ended, as it is begone, God will haue the strok, either after or before. Is there any thing in this world suer or fast That death or iniurie can not break? Look but on this yeare, and yeares before past, And wey Gods iudgement, and his fearfull wreak. Mercie, Lord God, look upon this poore Isle. Let not truthe be oppressed, nor innocentes slayn, Look on thi lovers, do not frowne on vs but smile, And all that seek thee, will be glad and fain. False reaport and sclaunderous lyes goeth betwixte Daunger, doubte, and deadlie feare, thei haue mad Litle truth with most shamfull lyes, be mixt. Whi should now this still, thin innocentes lad? Repent, o repent, and others so iudge. As yow your self wold be iudged again Here is no byding place, we must all away trudge From hence by accompt, either to ioye or pain. An end of this troble, o Lorde God make, Reconcile the parties lovingly togither. This will mak our ennemies for to quak And gladnes with mirthe to retorne hither This graunt, o Lord, which haest given vs knowledge Of thi gospell, whose sprite all truthe doth bring Thus shalt thou save, I dare, right well alledge This Isle, and comfort our most loving King.</field>
